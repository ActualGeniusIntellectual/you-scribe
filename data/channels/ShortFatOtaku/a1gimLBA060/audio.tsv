0	9480	Cibs is taking off as a full-time streamer and is now developing a video game.
9480	10480	Taking off?
10480	12480	That's what you're talking about.
12480	13480	Flying away.
13480	14480	He's like, no, come back!
14480	15480	No, come back!
15480	17760	Alright, Cibs, I have to sabotage you.
17760	22760	See, I didn't think if I could do the full stream full-time and make it full streaming,
22760	26800	but it turns out I can, and apparently grow.
26800	30520	I don't know why I didn't do the zoom.
30520	37160	The only thing holding me back at this point is my inability to work steadily.
37160	39680	Is your inability to develop a worth-gethic?
39680	40880	That's correct, though.
40880	46560	Because, uh, well, like, if I put out videos every day for a few weeks, my channel, like,
46560	50360	the algorithm revs up and my channel just goes wild, I can put out anything I want.
50360	54960	Right now, I'm suffering from fucking allergies.
54960	55960	You know what?
56120	58960	When I was growing up, I never had allergies.
58960	59960	Ever.
59960	60960	Right?
60960	63480	Spring, fall, didn't matter.
63480	68360	But now that I'm in my 30s, holy shit, I feel like I'm shutting down for weeks at a time.
68360	74960	My head is just swollen up, and I can't breathe, and I can't think, and I'm just like, ughhh.
74960	80080	Over the last 30 days, Dev has published 16 videos.
80080	81600	That's your issue.
81600	83880	You only publish videos half the day.
83880	85880	You need to do more work, Dev.
85880	87360	Yes, I know.
87360	91240	But when my head is like this, I can't write anything, I can barely think.
91240	93440	Who cares about writing things, Dev?
93440	94440	Spring!
94440	95440	No!
95440	99560	No, I have to- Listen, if I just put out shit, no one's gonna like it.
99560	101760	I gotta actually think about the videos that I do.
101760	109360	The past three days has just been me, like, holding my head, trying to get a thought together
109360	116320	in it, completely fucking failing, you know, popping Benadryl, trying to, like, fucking
116320	117320	get awake.
117320	119440	Jesus, I hate fucking allergies.
119440	120440	I hate them.
120440	124440	If Tofflebest could have behaved like you, he would have died of cancer.
124440	125440	Wait.
125440	129240	He did, which means sorry, Dev.
129240	130960	I guess I'm on my way out.
130960	134020	Don't make the joke about it either, you'll get it.
134020	137680	That's how it happens, when you joke about it.
137680	138680	It's very tragic.
138840	143640	I would never think about joking about it.
143640	149200	I'm just hoping that I'll be fit for thinking and writing again.
149200	151520	Come tomorrow, because I feel like I'm coming to the end of it.
151520	152520	Christ.
152520	153800	You're still sick?
153800	155840	Not sick, I have allergies right now.
155840	156840	Okay.
156840	158560	The fall is happening.
158560	159560	All the leaves are coming down.
159560	160560	Wrong culture.
160560	165200	Being sick and then going on a trip and then having allergies, I've missed out on, like,
165200	167120	two weeks worth of news cycles.
167120	168120	Fuck.
168160	169160	Better.
169160	170160	Loser.
170160	171160	Goddamnit.
171160	172160	Fuck you.
172160	175160	Sounds like a skill issue.
175160	176160	A skill issue?
176160	181280	Speaking of low fucking standards, Dev, I'm shitting on Google Stadia.
181280	182280	Fucking hell, Dev.
182280	183280	Jesus Christ, Dev.
183280	184280	Yeah, what's wrong with that?
184280	185440	You're talking about low hanging fucking fruit.
185440	186440	Jesus Christ.
186440	187960	Hey, listen, that was a decent video that I made.
187960	189120	Jesus Christ, Dev.
189120	198040	I saved up links since 2019 to compile a little mini history of the stadia from, like, announcement
198040	204360	to launch to ending, and I put it all into a nice little 12-minute package, you know?
204360	205760	That was a decent little video.
205760	206760	I stand by it.
206760	209800	It could have been a two-minute video, Dev.
209800	211880	Um, Google Stadia sucks.
211880	213080	It was always gonna suck.
213080	214680	Well, yeah, of course.
214680	215680	Goodbye.
215680	216920	But I wanted to have details.
216920	221000	I wanted to have deep lore.
221000	223040	This is why you failed, Dev.
223040	224140	Why?
224140	227360	This is why your last video was three days ago, not one day ago.
227680	231240	No, my last video three days ago, because I've been lying in head with it.
231240	234200	I've been lying in my bed with an inflated head.
234200	240400	I want to point out that this series that I do here with you guys, my friends, this
240400	244320	is easily the least watched thing on my channel.
244320	252560	It's probably tanking my channel in the algorithm, but I don't care, because I have fun doing it.
252560	255600	We're still gonna watch some garbage show after this one's done.
255600	259440	This kind of series, what this does is this is for your core audience, because your core
259440	262080	audience that are there for you will watch this.
262080	263080	Yeah.
263080	264080	Yeah.
264080	267160	It strengthens your core audience, so it's worth doing and investing.
267160	270760	And I promise you, I need a strengthened core, that's for sure.
270760	271760	Enough nonsense.
271760	273220	We're gonna get to it.
273220	274220	Let's go.
274220	275220	Press the button.
275220	276220	Before...
276220	278560	No, not yet, Kibs.
278560	281560	Impatient Kibs.
281560	283960	As always, there's a few things to discuss real quick.
283960	287520	So we probably should have talked about this last week, but it kind of flew over my head.
287520	292440	Did you all see this where the Amazon analyst said that he fell asleep watching Rings of
292440	293440	Power?
293440	294440	No.
294440	295440	No.
295440	296440	I have not.
296440	297440	Didn't pay him enough.
297440	298440	Yeah.
298440	304160	So he basically, there's a guy who is hired to like watch the show and he fell asleep
304160	305160	during it.
305160	306160	It's like, oh, well.
306160	310200	And yeah, Amazon is actually quite worried about the show, about how much of a bust that
310200	311200	it is.
311200	315960	To the point that they're finally slicing those disgusting Twitch streamers' salaries.
315960	316960	Fuck those people.
316960	319960	Hey, I'm one of those people.
319960	320960	Yeah, me too.
320960	321960	How dare you?
321960	322960	How dare you?
322960	323960	Like I'm saying.
323960	324960	How fucking dare you?
324960	325960	Where's my paycheck?
325960	328960	Yeah, Kibs, you stream on Twitch too!
328960	332960	Oh, yeah, I do get a paycheck from him.
332960	333960	Yay.
333960	334960	Not anymore, you don't.
334960	339600	Speaking of streamers though, Arch, do you guys remember the Rings of Power superfans?
339600	340600	Yes.
341000	347560	Think back, think back, we're talking like six months ago, Amazon hired three influencers,
347560	348560	specifically influencers.
348560	350600	The fellowship of influencers.
350600	354820	To come in and talk about how good the Rings of Power looked like it was going to be after
354820	357000	that first trailer dropped.
357000	360480	With absolutely no gun pointed behind your heads.
360480	363040	Wasn't a gun, it was a giant fat paycheck.
363040	366640	Every time I was like, okay, take a breath, something new would happen and it was, huh,
366640	367640	huh, huh.
367640	368640	It's middle earth, it's never peace, right?
368880	369880	Like Sauron is hot.
369880	372560	I feel like people will be like, I can fix him.
372560	374040	Middle earth had like a club.
374040	375680	Yo, this tune is banking.
375680	378080	Awestruck, mystified and scatstruck.
378080	379080	Wow.
379080	384080	So I decided to look them up because they're, you know, they, they are influencers on YouTube
384080	387400	and like, I think one of them has a couple hundred thousand subs or something like, I
387400	390240	think maybe one of them was like primarily a TikToker, I don't know.
390240	394420	These three influencers who were paid so much to come on and promote the Lord of the Rings,
394420	395840	the Rings of Power.
395840	400280	Since that promotion all those months ago and throughout the entire run of the show,
400280	402920	they have not said a single fucking thing about it.
402920	403920	Isn't that funny?
403920	405920	Because they were never interested.
405920	409720	You know what makes me mad about this is, there are actually dedicated Lord of the Rings
409720	413640	YouTubers out there that talk about the lore, that talk about the games.
413640	418040	They're actually a Lord of the Rings YouTubing community or content creator community.
418040	420520	Why did they reach out to them?
420520	422120	Why didn't they reach out?
422120	423120	Okay, Kyle.
423400	426000	I know you're very, very retarded.
426000	427000	You idiot.
427000	428000	Let me lay this out for you.
428000	429000	Quit being literal.
429000	430000	You know what I mean?
430000	433720	I already know what I mean, but I'm pointing it out.
433720	435360	It's because they wanted out of it.
435360	437400	Like, that's the same reason why they haven't talked about it.
437400	439480	This was a fucking ad.
439480	443180	It came out yesterday that Rings of Power has been slipping massively in the ratings.
443180	445880	So has House of the Dragon, but not nearly as much.
445880	451840	And that, funnily enough, Cobra Kai has overtaken both of them.
452600	455480	Like Cobra Kai was actually not bad.
455480	457440	Like, granted, it's cliched as fuck.
457440	460920	It is a stupid, stupid goddamn show.
460920	462920	And I hate so much about it.
462920	463920	Yeah, exactly.
463920	464920	That's the thing.
464920	465920	It's supposed to be.
465920	470000	Like, it fully embraces the fact that it's supposed to be a very retarded show.
470000	477180	It's just funny to see that this is basically how Rings of Power has been tumbling over
477180	479560	the course of these past eight weeks.
479560	482960	The thing is, that is the great failure of the Rings of Power.
482960	487520	This is how you know that it is an absolute failure.
487520	492000	The Rings of Power has managed to achieve what George R. R. Martin always wanted.
492000	494620	To be better than Tolkien.
494620	496440	And he's finally done it.
496440	499960	He has a show that's better than a Lord of the Rings show.
499960	505240	Not only the normies, but even the people who are themselves ideologically captured.
505240	506520	They're turning on this.
506520	510360	So on Polygon, the Rings of Power is holding Galadriel back.
510360	514600	Amazon's show hasn't earned the elf warrior's emotional journey.
514600	519680	So like, even, even, you know, Polygon's a shit website run by shit people.
519680	522720	But even they are seeing that, yeah, this is actually really bad.
522720	524720	This is actually a really bad show.
524720	526480	And you see another one like this.
526480	529480	It's time to admit that Rings of Power is just fan fiction.
529480	536480	Everyone, even people who are, let's say, politically aligned to see this show succeed.
536520	539360	Even they are saying, no, it's a failure.
539360	540680	Well, two reasons.
540680	543600	One, their position is by now thoroughly indefensible.
543600	547600	Like episode seven is one of the worst pieces of television ever fucking created from virtually
547600	549640	every single standpoint.
549640	553080	And so it is simply far more profitable to attack it.
553080	556120	Besides, it's almost over and Amazon payscheque isn't coming.
556120	557580	There's no reason not to.
557580	564120	And two, to the Rings of Power's credit, limited but maybe, it has not been particularly woke.
564120	568120	It hasn't been banging the drum in the actual story.
568120	571880	It did so in casting, sure as hell.
571880	575740	But in the end, in the actual story, it's, well, it hasn't been political.
575740	577120	It's just been shit.
577120	578120	Yep.
578120	582560	Oh, I guess one last thing before we start, since I don't know if, I don't know if you
582560	586040	mentioned it during the recording or before I turned it on or whatever.
586040	588600	My head's not exactly in there, right?
588600	592000	It's I'm currently floating away on on medication.
592000	594520	But Taft isn't here with us.
594520	596960	She she's she's not feeling well.
596960	597960	R.I.P.
597960	600960	Hopefully, she'll be back for the next show.
600960	602200	But this is the finale.
602200	603200	She's dead.
603200	604200	She's dead.
604200	605200	OK.
605200	606200	Not joking.
606200	607200	This is it, Kibbs.
607200	612040	The final time you get to press play, unless you want to watch season two of this thing.
612040	613040	You insist.
613040	614040	It's two years away.
614040	615040	Look, it's Amazon.
615040	616040	Oh, my God.
616040	617040	Wow.
617040	619040	It's a little smiley face.
619040	623680	I hit the recap button.
623680	626520	Look, it's poppies.
626520	627960	We're in Afghanistan.
627960	629960	It's raining, actually.
629960	632400	It rains in Afghanistan.
632400	633400	No, it doesn't.
633400	634400	Never.
634400	635400	It does.
635400	636400	So what do you do, Kibbs?
636400	637400	It doesn't.
637400	640300	That was a neat establishing job.
640300	643120	That's probably the best part of this whole episode, I bet.
643120	644840	Came humping a rock for two seconds.
644840	645840	Yeah, basically.
645840	646840	Listen, the bar's low.
646840	651120	You know, I always feel bad for actors like this.
651120	655080	You know, they're given a soaked piece of cloth and just be like, go huddle in the rain
655080	656080	for five minutes.
656080	659560	Like, oh, I don't feel that bad considering how much they're paid.
659560	665720	And five minutes is like five hours because, you know, they have to get all the shots.
665720	666720	Like 50 takes.
666720	667720	Yeah.
667720	668720	No, wait.
668720	671720	It's just an apple.
671720	678680	That's a remarkably neat look.
678680	679680	You cut out there, Kibbs.
679680	680680	What'd you say?
680680	682640	I said, how the fuck did the apple get over there?
682640	684280	It's like 30 feet away.
684280	685280	It rolled, man.
685280	686280	It rolled down the hill.
686280	690120	You ever like, you're at your desk and you drop something and then you look down and
690120	694080	it's like across the room and out into the hallway and you're like, fuck.
694080	695080	Yeah, what happens?
695080	697520	Oh, look, it's an apparition.
697520	698520	See?
698520	699520	I called it.
699520	701160	It was an apparition.
701160	702160	It's evil.
702160	703160	Kill it.
703160	706080	It's actually that short haired, white haired girl.
706080	707080	Yep.
707080	708080	Yeah.
708080	717480	A real slim shady ha-doom-doom-doom.
717480	722840	Would you like an apple?
722840	727160	Nobody bad has ever offered an apple.
727160	730080	I really hate the armor of that chick in particular.
730080	740480	So, somebody owes me a blowjob, Dev.
740480	741480	Down.
741480	742480	No.
742480	743480	Hold on.
743480	744480	Down, Dev.
744480	745480	Come now.
745480	751360	Wait, wait, wait.
751360	752520	I was the one who-
752520	753520	Down, Dev.
753520	754520	No, no.
754520	756560	I was the one who bet Mauler that this would be-
756560	759520	Yeah, but you were doubting.
759520	761160	I was never doubting.
761160	763400	I was always strong in my faith.
763400	764400	I don't know.
764400	770280	You were on the Gandalf train a little bit, weren't you?
770280	771280	God no.
771280	775320	I didn't think it was Gandalf, but I thought I could have sworn this motherfucker would-
775320	777320	like that would be too obvious.
777320	781480	Well, Kyle, you two are going to have to get down on your fucking knees.
781480	782480	No, no.
782480	785040	Well, the most interesting plot has been revealed.
785040	786040	I don't want to watch anymore.
786040	787040	Oh, no.
787040	788040	Yes, quit.
788560	791160	No, no, no.
791160	796600	Like I said at the beginning, this is why the hobbits are remarkably resistant to the
796600	797680	rings of power.
797680	803240	That's so stupid, though, because Sauron is like, I feel bad for that one fucking little
803240	804240	like hobbit thing I did-
804240	805240	Wait a second.
805240	806240	Wait, Arch-
806240	807240	But the Harfoot's not even hobbits.
807240	809600	Arch, didn't I say that back then?
809600	810600	No.
810600	812600	Are you taking all my good takes for yourself?
812600	813600	Son of a slut.
813600	814600	You're stealing my takes.
814600	815600	Yep, Dev agreed.
816160	817160	Horse shit, Dev Rudy.
817160	818160	Hold on.
818160	821160	Lilith, Lilith, you got to break the tie here.
821160	823160	Come on, Lilith.
823160	825160	We already broke the tie.
825160	826160	Dev's right.
826160	829160	I'm pretty sure you said something along the lines, Dev.
829160	831160	Yeah, he said something after I said it.
831160	833360	He parroted me, like the little pig that he is.
833360	835360	I think Arch is a parroter.
835360	839800	Wait, can't the elves just mine it themselves?
839800	841240	You guys know how to mine, right?
841240	843240	The land belongs to the dorists.
843240	844240	No.
844880	846880	How could we possibly match the powers that rule?
846880	847880	Oh, simple.
847880	848880	We just make rings.
848880	850880	Oh, then my guy's going to make the rings of power with this?
850880	851880	Are you serious?
851880	852880	Yes.
852880	854880	Wait, were the rings of power made out of mithril?
854880	855880	No.
855880	856880	No.
856880	857880	Oh.
857880	858880	They were cracked with magic.
858880	860680	Don't explain to us how the rings are made.
860680	862680	Don't explain to us how the rings are made.
862680	863680	I can't explain.
863680	865680	It's in the fucking title you much much.
865680	866680	Ah.
866680	867680	Okay, so-
867680	868680	Ah.
868680	871800	Okay, hold, hold, hold, hold, hold, hold, hold, hold, hold.
871800	874000	How Bran seems fucked.
874000	877920	How far did she just ride?
877920	880160	A few hundred miles at least.
880160	883080	They just galloped all the way to elf capital.
883080	884080	Was it Lindon?
884080	885080	Six days.
885080	887120	They have to get there by ship?
887120	891560	He survived a week on a horseback.
891560	893760	There's no way they traveled that far in six days.
893760	895160	Oh, fuck me gently.
895160	897760	Listen, he's just a gigachad, all right?
897760	901840	I'm pretty sure that's over 600 miles, or 300 at the very least.
901840	904400	They just fell that way just for bed in a hospital bed.
904400	905400	Yep.
905400	907280	Let me open up a map of Middle-earth on the second page.
907280	911840	Couldn't they have just moved the healers over there?
911840	912840	They just fast-traveled.
912840	913840	They just fast-traveled.
913840	916000	There are no enemies nearby.
916000	918560	Oh, God, she's right.
918560	919560	Of course she is.
919560	920560	She was always right, Dev.
920560	921560	No.
921560	922560	Whatever the fuck that is.
922560	923560	Dev.
923560	924560	Dev.
924560	925560	Okay, Lindon, 200.
925560	926560	400.
926560	927560	600.
927560	928560	Dude, that's like-
929280	932440	That's like almost 1,000 miles, if I'm doing that correctly.
932440	934840	That's a fast horse.
934840	938400	There's no way.
938400	941400	No way.
941400	942400	Yeah, I know.
942400	947560	We watched you swim for, like, a whole fucking episode, and it was retarded.
947560	949560	It was really bad.
949560	951280	You know what upsets me?
951280	954520	That style of makeup that makes their pores look enormous.
954520	957560	It just kind of makes me feel like I'm developing tryctophobia.
958560	959560	Sweet.
960560	962560	Their faces look very holey now.
962560	964560	Yeah, don't they?
964560	968560	Like it's that lighting, that makeup style, and they just look like they're bumpy.
968560	971560	Well, they are ascended beings, Kibbs.
971560	973560	Make it cold so their pores close.
973560	975560	But you don't get it, do you?
975560	977560	I don't care about getting it.
977560	978560	I don't want their pores to close.
978560	983560	I remember when in movies where Galadriel just looked completely flawless and, like, shiny
983560	985560	because that's what elves are supposed to be.
985560	986560	That's just photoshopped.
986560	989560	I mean, that's the point, though.
989560	991560	Unrealistic beauty standards.
991560	994560	All of Galadriel's OnlyFans pics are photoshopped.
994560	996560	What is this place?
996560	998560	This is my forge.
998560	1000560	What's the workshop of Celebrimbor?
1000560	1002560	The Thor arches are curved.
1002560	1003560	Come on, now.
1003560	1004560	Now, okay.
1004560	1006560	Hammer home how right I was.
1006560	1011560	Let's add in a time differential as well.
1011560	1014560	Let's make Halbrand Sauron, too.
1014560	1016560	Oh, God.
1016560	1018560	Because now he's in the forge.
1018560	1025560	Now he's like, oh, but maybe I could make a ring that could, like, yes, maybe.
1025560	1030560	The master I apprenticed to used to speak of the wonders of your craft.
1030560	1031560	See?
1031560	1033560	He's a smith, too.
1033560	1034560	Oh.
1034560	1035560	Oh, my God.
1035560	1037560	So they're going to have two Saurons.
1037560	1038560	Wait, you know what it'll be?
1038560	1039560	It'll be like...
1039560	1040560	Oh, no.
1040560	1044560	No, I feel like the Hobo could be a red herring.
1044560	1045560	Maybe.
1045560	1046560	It still is a red herring.
1046560	1049560	Or they could be, like, both Saurons, and you've got to combine them into, like, one
1049560	1051560	guy, like a fusion dance.
1051560	1054560	Oh, God, he's splintered his soul or something?
1054560	1055560	Yeah.
1059560	1061560	I'm super smart, by the way.
1061560	1066560	Somebody needs to be, once again, begging Arch for forgiveness and calling him smart.
1066560	1068560	He's fucking Sauron, too.
1068560	1070560	Arch is wrong again.
1070560	1071560	Listen to me.
1071560	1072560	I'm Halbrand.
1072560	1073560	I come from Mordor.
1073560	1077560	I know everything about magic, metal, and shit, which you, the ten thousand year old
1077560	1079560	smith, would never know.
1079560	1080560	Retard.
1080560	1081560	A gift.
1081560	1083560	Sticky Sauron, too.
1083560	1084560	A gift.
1084560	1085560	They're all Sauron.
1085560	1086560	Everyone's Sauron.
1086560	1087560	I'm a Sauron.
1087560	1088560	It's like Battlestar Galactica.
1088560	1090560	We're all Sirens.
1090560	1092560	We're all Sirens.
1092560	1096560	I hear online that this Phaseron guy is also Sauron.
1096560	1097560	This, like, marks here.
1097560	1101560	No, Phaseron is not Sauron.
1101560	1105560	He was manipulated by Sauron.
1105560	1109560	Okay, so who's gonna start talking to him and manipulating him?
1109560	1113560	Well, I'm sure Halbrand will probably pop him again soon or something.
1113560	1118560	Or, I think they've just dropped the entire Numenor plotline.
1118560	1120560	Maybe she's Sauron, too.
1123560	1126560	Their understanding of art is really advanced.
1127560	1132560	And, now they've got paper instead of that fucking papyrus shit they were having earlier.
1132560	1137560	I want to see mommy milkers one more time before I go.
1137560	1142560	Let me, let me feel with my hand.
1142560	1149560	By the way, for all of the flaws of House of the Dragon, they did a much better Dying
1149560	1152560	King set of scenes than this show did.
1152560	1153560	You're mistaken.
1153560	1154560	Wait, what?
1154560	1155560	What do you mean next up?
1155560	1156560	Next up, fuck off.
1158560	1160560	Sorry, that's too pop up.
1162560	1164560	Sink, but yes.
1164560	1165560	I mean, this king is about dying.
1165560	1167560	I don't make this mistake, too, in paratrauma.
1167560	1168560	Like, our ship is falling.
1168560	1169560	No, Kyle, it's sinking.
1169560	1170560	The king!
1170560	1171560	Help!
1171560	1173560	Well, it falls to the ocean bottom.
1173560	1175560	Oh my god, the rings of power.
1175560	1177560	Is he gonna die in time?
1177560	1179560	Wait, he vanished.
1181560	1182560	Uh oh.
1182560	1183560	Maybe he's Sauron.
1183560	1186560	He got spry all of a sudden.
1186560	1189560	This is a rather random plot point.
1189560	1191560	This is.
1191560	1195560	I feel like this only exists so we have some reason to care about whomever this is.
1195560	1200560	Yeah, because to be honest, besides her boobs, there's not much else to her.
1200560	1202560	And her tits could be bigger.
1202560	1203560	Yeah, they could use a-
1203560	1205560	They could CGI those up a little bit.
1205560	1206560	Well, you don't want it too big.
1206560	1207560	Otherwise they'd get droopy and say-
1207560	1208560	I don't know.
1208560	1210560	They could be larger.
1210560	1212560	What manner of object?
1212560	1213560	A ring!
1222560	1223560	He's a cringe.
1234560	1235560	This is so stupid.
1235560	1236560	God help her.
1236560	1237560	Yeah, how rings work.
1237560	1240560	All that power upon the brow of one being.
1240560	1242560	You've just ruined the mystery.
1246560	1249560	Suggestions were but the key that unlocked the dam.
1249560	1251560	We are on the cusp of-
1252560	1254560	Jesus, they really want to-
1254560	1255560	Okay.
1255560	1257560	Strength but of spirit.
1257560	1260560	Not of the flesh, but over flesh.
1262560	1264560	Galadriel's gaydar is tingling.
1264560	1265560	Wait, hold on.
1265560	1267560	Are you a traitorous faggot?
1268560	1270560	Are you Sauron?
1271560	1273560	Again, the fucking story telling.
1273560	1276560	Do we need a rebellious moment here?
1276560	1278560	Do we need the scene where he goes like,
1278560	1280560	No, I'll do it anyways.
1280560	1281560	Do we need that?
1281560	1283560	Why the fuck do we need that?
1283560	1286560	We need more drama to keep the viewers engaged.
1289560	1290560	Drama no matter what.
1290560	1293560	That's probably what the school taught them.
1294560	1296560	Wherever writing school they came from.
1296560	1298560	If they went to school.
1305560	1308560	Oh my god, the fucking mithril's making him do it.
1308560	1309560	Does it matter?
1309560	1311560	Of course.
1311560	1312560	Oh wait, so wait.
1312560	1313560	What does it matter?
1313560	1316560	All mithril has the same corrupting powers?
1316560	1317560	That'd be ridiculous.
1317560	1319560	At least Frodo was wearing a shirt of that shit.
1319560	1321560	I mowed that much.
1321560	1326560	No, no, I think they're suggesting that Halbrand somehow talked him into it.
1326560	1331560	The problem is, all of this bullshit drama is replacing the drama we should have.
1331560	1338560	Which is Halbrand very, very, very slowly talking the elves into this idea.
1338560	1341560	Like suggesting, hinting.
1341560	1343560	Instead he just walks in there and goes like,
1343560	1345560	Why have you made it into a ring?
1345560	1347560	Like, oh, brilliant.
1348560	1352560	I love how Halbrand's just a part of the smithing crew now.
1353560	1355560	Like, you told me something incredibly obvious.
1355560	1356560	Be my apprentice.
1356560	1359560	Yeah, we needed like three scenes.
1359560	1364560	Three or four scenes of him talking to that guy and like getting him warmed up to it.
1364560	1366560	Not just, oh, he's here now.
1366560	1374560	What gets to me is just like, until now we've never even heard of Halbrand being like a ring maker or metal worker much.
1374560	1381560	We saw him like one scene doing it in, um, fuck, what was it called?
1381560	1382560	The island.
1382560	1385560	He's fucked around with the foraging like twice.
1385560	1386560	Yeah, I can see how the...
1386560	1388560	Okay, maybe I just didn't remember.
1388560	1394560	But like, I don't think it was like ever stated that he was like a super expert at it, so.
1394560	1395560	Just that he wanted to do it.
1395560	1399560	Well, so far he's been a traveler, a sailor, a smith, a king.
1402560	1403560	Someone like me.
1404560	1405560	Yeah.
1406560	1407560	Yeah.
1407560	1408560	Someone like me, Sauron.
1408560	1410560	Right next to you, Galadriel.
1410560	1412560	You've been looking for me for so long.
1422560	1423560	She saved Sauron's life.
1425560	1426560	No.
1428560	1429560	Yes.
1433560	1434560	He believed in me.
1434560	1436560	Oh my god, that's true, she did.
1437560	1439560	He pushed me to heights that no one else could have.
1439560	1441560	See, oh my god.
1441560	1447560	This, in a better show, this would have been an excellent fucking scene.
1450560	1457560	See, if this was in a show where you never suspected who this guy was, this would have been a fucking good scene.
1457560	1459560	But it isn't, it's in the rings of power.
1459560	1465560	It would be one of those scenes where like on your second watch through you could see all the little things.
1465560	1470560	Yep, and he's like, you believed in me, you pushed me, you made me stronger.
1470560	1475560	Like that would have been a fucking chill scene if it wasn't in the rings of power.
1489560	1493560	See, they're trying to fucking do the two thing.
1494560	1495560	Me stars!
1511560	1513560	I don't think that's how that works.
1514560	1518560	You fell from the stars, yet you are greater than they.
1518560	1520560	Why is everyone echoing?
1521560	1522560	Because it's dramatic.
1523560	1529560	In time he will learn to control his powers, for now bind him.
1530560	1531560	They're messing up my hair.
1531560	1535560	Oh look, it's a little concept on YouTube.
1536560	1537560	It's a horror flute.
1538560	1540560	Oh god, I hate the horror flute so much.
1540560	1541560	Totally bad.
1542560	1543560	Now's our chance.
1545560	1547560	To get what, fucking killed?
1548560	1550560	Yeah, well I expected to against him.
1552560	1553560	They're just gonna set you on fire.
1554560	1557560	They're harfoots, they've got guerilla memes, okay.
1558560	1560560	I'm afraid they're like little Vietnamese people.
1561560	1563560	See like the Ewoks, like they'll swing logs down.
1564560	1570560	When the trees start speaking harfoot, oh they just, they just left, they just left him okay, nevermind.
1570560	1572560	Well they didn't, then we're gonna get out.
1573560	1575560	The third person is gonna show up at the last second.
1576560	1577560	Gotcha kids.
1578560	1580560	She's gonna show off, off screen.
1581560	1582560	Watch this.
1583560	1586560	Oh no, the third person is the bad bitch.
1587560	1589560	Thank you, that was kind of a clever double.
1590560	1595560	It doesn't make sense because the harfoots were looking straight at them when they did this, but details, details.
1600560	1601560	Run.
1602560	1604560	Oh no, a tiny harfoot is uh.
1605560	1606560	Oh no.
1606560	1607560	Nice.
1607560	1608560	Yes.
1609560	1610560	Goodbye.
1610560	1611560	Thank you.
1611560	1612560	Now twist the knife, make sure.
1612560	1614560	No, he fell off screen, he's still alive, no.
1614560	1616560	That's unfortunate, he is still alive.
1617560	1618560	Fuck.
1619560	1620560	Well that was a good choice.
1620560	1621560	Black man dies, archers.
1624560	1625560	Actually you know what?
1626560	1633560	So on Andor this week, of the six main characters there was two black guys and they killed them both.
1634560	1636560	All the black people are dying on TV right now.
1637560	1639560	But tragically both lesbians survived.
1640560	1642560	Hey listen, they're both kind of cute.
1643560	1644560	I don't know about that.
1645560	1646560	I do.
1647560	1648560	Deadeye force push.
1655560	1656560	I'm sorry.
1657560	1659560	How is that troll sticking to your head there woman?
1660560	1661560	It's a bit weird.
1662560	1664560	Wait, how is Sauron losing the mage fight?
1665560	1667560	I just noticed her staff is the eye.
1670560	1671560	Look at her staff, it's the eye.
1672560	1673560	Well yes Dev.
1675560	1676560	Are you some kind of dev?
1677560	1678560	Oh cool, Batarangs.
1685560	1686560	Okay, that was pretty funny.
1687560	1688560	That was good.
1689560	1690560	The little lottery.
1697560	1698560	Batarangs.
1699560	1701560	That's why there's just a fuck you master.
1702560	1703560	Yeah, exactly.
1708560	1710560	If I were Sauron, I'd say that's a good choice.
1710560	1716560	If I were Sauron, I'd just be like, you're fired.
1725560	1726560	Look at the stoners.
1727560	1728560	Defeated by nuts and berries.
1730560	1731560	Oh, she can't detect them anymore.
1734560	1736560	I'm really mad, I'm going to burn all of you.
1737560	1740560	They're hidden behind leaves, everybody.
1742560	1743560	Uh oh.
1744560	1747560	Couldn't she just light everything on fire like she did before?
1748560	1749560	Yep, that's what she needed to do.
1750560	1751560	Oh shit.
1754560	1757560	Come on, please kill at least one of the harplets, I pray.
1758560	1759560	One of them at least.
1760560	1761560	Nah, they got too much plot armor.
1767560	1770560	Oh no, my harpits, they're burning.
1771560	1775560	This is just a normal California summer, after a gender reveal party.
1776560	1784560	See, now, if anything, I'm slowly growing more skeptical, because they're laying on the herring a little bit too thick right now.
1785560	1786560	It's very thick.
1787560	1788560	This is the problem though.
1789560	1791560	It reveals that this is how Gandalf was formed.
1791560	1798560	The issue is, they're double layering the story so thick that neither outcome makes sense anymore.
1799560	1800560	Yeah.
1801560	1802560	My $20 is in limbo.
1804560	1805560	Wait, is he just surviving?
1806560	1807560	After getting stabbed in the gut?
1808560	1811560	I mean, you fuckers still have knives, you could just stab them.
1812560	1814560	Check with the Batarangs, could throw them.
1822560	1826560	Suck it! Get on your knees!
1827560	1828560	I'm good.
1835560	1836560	Oh, they're ringwraiths.
1837560	1838560	Wait, how?
1839560	1840560	They can't be ringwraiths.
1841560	1842560	Oh, personally can be ringwraiths.
1847560	1848560	They're moths.
1849560	1850560	Yeah.
1851560	1852560	Barge.
1855560	1856560	Ooh, that ringwraith style.
1857560	1858560	He's Nistar.
1859560	1860560	Okay, so which wizard is he then?
1861560	1862560	Nothing.
1863560	1864560	I hope it's the white wizard.
1865560	1866560	Saruman?
1867560	1868560	Yep, Saruman.
1870560	1873560	Before he became a, you know, black-filled wizard.
1877560	1878560	Oh, thank god he's gonna die.
1879560	1880560	Oh, he's gonna be saved by magic.
1881560	1883560	Please, TV show, at least give me this.
1886560	1887560	They're gonna.
1888560	1890560	You don't think the maid is gonna heal him?
1891560	1892560	Nope, because he just nodded.
1893560	1894560	He's like, yep, I'm not healing you.
1897560	1899560	He pissed off the priest one too many times in the dungeon.
1900560	1902560	Oh god, that's quick. He's going fast.
1907560	1908560	He's going sitting up?
1911560	1912560	Yeah.
1917560	1919560	And he still, some still say his skeletons are there to this day.
1920560	1921560	You know, I'm having fun with this episode.
1922560	1926560	The thing is, I'm still not even sold that he's a wizard.
1927560	1931560	Because the problem is, he can't be a wizard from the timeline.
1932560	1938560	And they have doubled back on what he is so many times.
1938560	1941560	He can be, because they're just making shit up at this point.
1942560	1947560	Oh they are, but the thing is, they've doubled back on this like twelve times now.
1948560	1950560	From good to evil to evil to good to good to evil.
1951560	1952560	Keep your guessing, right?
1954560	1963560	What they're doing is, you know, they made the Balrog show up, and the wizard show up, and Mount Doom first erupt.
1963560	1970560	In the same week. And these things did not happen anywhere close to each other in the timeline.
1973560	1976560	This is very convenient that they all happen all at once, Dev.
1979560	1984560	The issue is too though, the wizards are out in the third age.
1985560	1990560	Which means that Amazon literally does not have the rights to the wizards.
1990560	1997560	Hey wait a second. She's down in the hold of the ship practicing.
1998560	2005560	I mean the implication is that she's practicing being blind in public so that no one knows she's blind.
2006560	2007560	That's what it seems like is happening right now.
2008560	2013560	But in the last episode there was that scene of her on the deck of the ship with her blindfold on.
2014560	2015560	Yes.
2016560	2017560	Yes, Dev.
2017560	2020560	Yes, Dev. Yes, it doesn't make sense, Dev. Come here, Dev.
2021560	2022560	Dev, Dev, Dev.
2027560	2030560	This is the rings of power in a nutshell right here.
2031560	2041560	This is why even that theoretically great scene with Halbrand is actually shit, because this is what the show does normally.
2042560	2048560	Maybe Taftash had the right idea, getting sick and bowing out.
2049560	2052560	This entire blind plotline is...
2053560	2060560	It feels like one of the two showrunners wrote half of it and the other guy wrote the other half and they never spoke about it.
2061560	2064560	So one's like, oh she'll be a really strong queen because she'll pretend not to be blind.
2065560	2068560	And the other guy's like, well she's blind now, I guess she's got a blindfold.
2068560	2071560	You gotta make her a demon hunter from Warcraft.
2074560	2080560	Kibbs gets it, because he's actually playing Warcraft right now, you fucking Blizzard shill traitor.
2081560	2086560	This episode's actually been the most entertaining. Not for any good reasons, but because it's very funny.
2088560	2091560	I'm just very glad that at least one of the Harfords is finally dead.
2092560	2095560	This is the first time I've enjoyed the show. Like, wow.
2096560	2101560	I'm just very glad the show's almost fucking over. Are we really doing season two?
2102560	2106560	Yeah, but it's in two years time, so I wouldn't worry about it.
2107560	2110560	And by then we'll be dead. One of us will have died of old age.
2111560	2112560	My bet is on Dev.
2113560	2114560	I can't fucking wait.
2115560	2118560	Time to pretend to not be blind in front of all the people who have seen me with a blindfold.
2119560	2120560	No, she has a blindfold.
2121560	2122560	Alright.
2125560	2128560	Oh, hi. Oh, Jesus. Alright, well, never mind.
2133560	2136560	So, what specifically was she practicing down there?
2137560	2139560	She was practicing pissing me off.
2142560	2145560	Black flags, ma'am. You're fucking dead's dead.
2146560	2147560	Ta-da!
2147560	2149560	You're right. Black flags.
2156560	2160560	I feel bad for the guy who didn't go up to that fucking mountain to do that one.
2161560	2162560	Just hanging there.
2163560	2165560	He's like, Jim, I'm gonna need you to go up there. Like, please, no.
2166560	2167560	It's a living.
2168560	2171560	Man, I would have felt really bad if I knew who the fuck this guy was.
2172560	2173560	It's Santa.
2174560	2175560	If only he had any screen time.
2176560	2177560	Staring at him with loving eyes.
2180560	2181560	Oh, they died.
2182560	2183560	What the fuck happened?
2183560	2185560	No, no, this is the elves again.
2186560	2188560	They're making the rings and they're fucking up a bit.
2189560	2190560	Oh, you idiots.
2191560	2194560	Oh my god, I thought it was a terrorist attack. Like, they're 9-11 in the Numenor.
2195560	2196560	Also, hold the fuck on.
2197560	2199560	Who puts their smith at the top of a tower?
2202560	2203560	Thank you.
2204560	2205560	Galadriel.
2205560	2207560	Pushing ourselves too high.
2212560	2213560	That's it.
2214560	2215560	Oh god, it is.
2216560	2217560	Of course it is.
2217560	2218560	Fucking hell.
2220560	2221560	That's it.
2221560	2222560	I've got it now.
2222560	2224560	Why did I think of that?
2225560	2226560	Drawn or coaxed.
2227560	2230560	God damn, Galadriel just has to do everything in this show.
2230560	2231560	Everything inside out.
2233560	2235560	Yes, because this is how metal works.
2236560	2240560	Sometimes you gotta pet the metal and then it'll just, you know, bind with other metals.
2241560	2242560	That's how this works.
2243560	2244560	That's how it's doing a good job.
2247560	2248560	Here's this thing.
2250560	2254560	Stroke it gently and then it'll become iron and that's how steel is made.
2255560	2259560	You whisper gently into the ears of iron and copper and steel.
2261560	2262560	Armor.
2264560	2267560	God, I just read something really shocking.
2267560	2268560	Stupid.
2269560	2271560	And it rolled away from me because it's on a scroll.
2274560	2275560	Gasparuni.
2284560	2285560	Uh oh.
2290560	2293560	The last man to bear your crest died over a thousand years ago.
2295560	2296560	He had no heir.
2298560	2299560	I read there, he had no heir.
2301560	2303560	No, on the raft you saved me.
2303560	2305560	On the raft, you saved me.
2305560	2307560	You convinced Myrios to save the men of Middle-earth.
2308560	2309560	Oh.
2309560	2310560	Isaron.
2311560	2314560	The evil music is revealing it to us.
2315560	2316560	And mine.
2321560	2322560	Tell me your name.
2325560	2328560	I have been awake since before the breaking of the first silence.
2330560	2331560	And outside.
2332560	2333560	I have had many names.
2334560	2336560	Why would you reveal it here, though?
2340560	2345560	Again, you know, this should be a good scene, but the acting is fucking up a bit here.
2345560	2346560	Like, Letter's actually doing okay.
2347560	2348560	But.
2349560	2350560	He, like.
2351560	2353560	There should have been a bit more of a smile on his face.
2353560	2355560	He should have been a little bit more sinister.
2355560	2356560	They should have shaded him a bit more.
2357560	2358560	Also.
2359560	2360560	He hasn't made the rings yet.
2361560	2362560	This isn't when you...
2362560	2363560	Oh God, alright.
2364560	2366560	Well, he's made her into a common as it's fine.
2369560	2371560	Hello, I'm the brother from episode one.
2371560	2375560	I've had a grand total of five seconds of screen time, but you should remember me.
2376560	2377560	He was seeking a power.
2379560	2381560	Not to destroy Middle Earth.
2382560	2383560	But to heal it.
2386560	2387560	He's the good guy.
2387560	2388560	If it was your fellow elves.
2389560	2391560	Why would you say such a thing?
2391560	2393560	Damn them CGI tears.
2396560	2398560	You can't even get the actors to actually cry anymore.
2398560	2399560	Geez.
2400560	2401560	Look at me!
2404560	2405560	Oh, now we're on the ship.
2406560	2407560	Well, the ship.
2409560	2410560	You know who I am.
2413560	2414560	I am your friend.
2415560	2416560	I want her to start pulling on the thing again.
2417560	2418560	He's just gaslighting.
2421560	2424560	This is like, oh, I'm going to take you to the fantasy world to gaslight you non-stop.
2425560	2427560	I told you that I had done evil and you did not care.
2428560	2431560	Because you knew that our past meant nothing.
2432560	2433560	Weighed against our future.
2435560	2436560	Wait.
2437560	2438560	Wait.
2439560	2440560	So women make him evil?
2441560	2442560	Someone's actually good.
2443560	2446560	He got dumped by Galadriel and that's why he turns evil.
2447560	2448560	He's an incel.
2451560	2452560	I get it now.
2456560	2458560	That was a forced scene. I didn't like that.
2458560	2459560	Yeah.
2462560	2466560	There is, there is fucking meat to this.
2467560	2469560	That's what annoys me, but there's no setup.
2470560	2471560	And I really,
2474560	2477560	I fucking hate his actor when it comes to this.
2478560	2482560	Like he doesn't have that charisma that he really should have here.
2483560	2484560	That gravitas.
2485560	2486560	Oh my God.
2487560	2489560	Taking that line from the fucking movie.
2499560	2507560	I mean, I think this guy could do it, but they just needed an actual show behind it and not just this nonsense.
2508560	2511560	The romance thing is really cringe though, I will say that much.
2512560	2513560	I see.
2521560	2531560	I don't mind that because he's the one trying to seduce her and there's no indication that he actually necessarily gives a shit, but he wants her power and she's got him by the walls.
2541560	2543560	Yeah, that too was just a fuck.
2545560	2549560	He doesn't look like Sauron because you give him slit eyes. Like this isn't how this works.
2550560	2551560	Not gonna lie.
2552560	2553560	This is really dumb.
2554560	2558560	No, no, no, no, no. This is the cleverest the show has ever been, which is sad.
2559560	2561560	Clever for a show, terrible for Lord of the Rings.
2562560	2564560	But the thing is, this works.
2565560	2571560	If only it had been constructed better. If only it had been acted better, shot better.
2572560	2573560	If only it wasn't this.
2574560	2582560	Like, this is a genuinely fine story point, but very poorly delivered.
2592560	2599560	Oh, Arch, the comments corrected us from last week. Elrond apparently always was a half-elf.
2600560	2610560	Also, wait a second. How does that prove that Elrond's real if that's something that Galadriel knows and Sauron can just take it from her mind?
2611560	2614560	Can he take it from her mind? Does he have that Jedi power?
2615560	2616560	Yeah, that's what we've been doing this whole time.
2616560	2627560	Like, you'd have to ask a question that you didn't know the answer to, but would sound real to you when they gave it to you.
2635560	2636560	Just tell him.
2636560	2638560	You are making that promise very difficult to keep.
2639560	2641560	Very easy. It would not require trust.
2642560	2645560	Really, bitch? You're gonna just sweep this one under the rug?
2646560	2650560	Why wouldn't you tell everyone? This was Sauron.
2651560	2656560	She has to be mysterious. She has to be cryptic for no reason.
2657560	2658560	Three?
2660560	2661560	I want one. That's why.
2663560	2664560	Two will divide.
2664560	2667560	But with three, there is balance.
2673560	2674560	And we each get one.
2674560	2675560	There is no sense.
2676560	2678560	Must be for the elves alone.
2679560	2681560	Untouched by other hands.
2682560	2687560	Oh, shit. We've literally rewritten the entire fucking origin of the Rings of Power.
2688560	2690560	You have potential, Arch.
2691560	2693560	I need gold and silver.
2694560	2696560	The most exquisite quality.
2698560	2700560	I need gold and silver from Valinor.
2704560	2709560	True creation requires a dagger sacrifice.
2710560	2715560	Oh, God. Now she can melt that down to cut herself from her brother. Oh, God, that's okay.
2717560	2719560	Do you remember anything more yet?
2720560	2721560	Fragments.
2722560	2729560	Oh, look, the Harfoots are settling down to farm like nomadic communities usually do.
2730560	2733560	This is the origin story as to why the hobbits started to settle.
2734560	2736560	It's awful, but you know.
2737560	2739560	In your tongue, that means wise one.
2741560	2742560	Oh.
2743560	2745560	Wizard.
2746560	2747560	Yeah.
2748560	2749560	Arch, you were wrong.
2749560	2751560	No, I'm still not admitting it.
2752560	2753560	You can't. You've been defeated.
2754560	2758560	I can. I absolutely can, because they've made him good and then evil and then evil and then good again and again.
2759560	2760560	This is just another part of it.
2761560	2762560	So which...
2764560	2766560	Because he can't be a wizard. Literally.
2767560	2768560	There is no way he can be.
2769560	2770560	Why?
2771560	2774560	Because the wizard was specifically sent as a response to Sauron.
2775560	2776560	Yeah.
2776560	2778560	And they were sent in the third age.
2779560	2782560	Sorry, Arch, but that's old lore. It's been changed.
2783560	2785560	Yeah, give it the time, boomer.
2790560	2792560	At least we're almost done, I think.
2793560	2794560	Okay, let's hover over it.
2795560	2796560	It's like 20 minutes left.
2797560	2798560	Arch, jump out a window.
2800560	2802560	I would rather do something else.
2804560	2807560	The funny parts are over. I'm no longer enjoying this.
2810560	2811560	I don't.
2812560	2814560	I'm quite happy we killed at least one half-foot.
2815560	2817560	One casualty is a good start.
2818560	2820560	It's a beginning. We've got a long way to go.
2821560	2823560	Is he the only named character that's dead?
2824560	2825560	In the entire season?
2828560	2829560	I think so.
2830560	2831560	Well, the king was named.
2832560	2834560	Well, but he wasn't a character character.
2835560	2836560	That's true.
2836560	2839560	So technically, the black guy dicked a hearse.
2840560	2843560	Oh, good. So she's only going to follow her story with this star.
2844560	2847560	We're not going to fucking watch the rest of them in season two.
2848560	2852560	Well, I'm going on an adventure.
2853560	2856560	Maybe all of the others will be wiped out off-screen.
2857560	2858560	Hopefully.
2858560	2864560	The best part is, what they've done here is they basically said that it was actually women were the first adventuring hobbits.
2867560	2869560	Little girl. What the fuck? Where'd she come from?
2872560	2874560	They just breed real fast.
2875560	2876560	Jesus Christ.
2877560	2880560	You know, after sex, an acorn pops out of the woman's vagina.
2881560	2885560	In two or three weeks after planting, it'll just sprout right up.
2886560	2888560	Ain't no stuff. Not a vagina. That'd be weird.
2889560	2891560	Like a gross barge. I know it's hard for you.
2891560	2894560	We're birds has preferences.
2897560	2900560	I feel bad for these poor actors. They were like, oh, that's going to be great for my career.
2901560	2902560	It's going to look great.
2903560	2904560	Rest in peace, bro.
2905560	2906560	Like a sign language thing.
2907560	2912560	I will actually say one good thing about the Harfoot's their music, their aesthetic, their accents.
2913560	2917560	It reminds me a lot of that GameCube game, Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles.
2918560	2919560	It's the exact same like theming.
2920560	2922560	Irish. And dirty.
2923560	2924560	Yeah.
2925560	2927560	Sick of the Harfoot's now. Kill them all. Move on.
2928560	2932560	They're dirty hair. They're dirty hands. They're dirty faces.
2933560	2937560	It feels like they've done this, this goodbye scene, like three big hugs now.
2938560	2942560	They kind of have, because there's also different stories where they're doing like goodbye things.
2943560	2946560	I had to get one for every story. We have yet to get one for the black elf.
2946560	2948560	Or maybe hit the way he's over.
2949560	2953560	By the way, there's some race mixing going on here and yet all of the children are white. Explain.
2954560	2956560	One gene is stronger than the other, apparently.
2957560	2959560	Oh, no. Fat Sam.
2960560	2962560	Well, Sam was always kind of fat.
2963560	2967560	Ploppé. Actually, Ploppé would be a better name. Ploppé.
2968560	2970560	Don't come with. Don't come with.
2971560	2974560	Why does everyone I love the most always have to go away?
2974560	2977560	I don't know. It's never happened before, so, you know.
2978560	2979560	Is she going to come along?
2980560	2981560	No, please.
2982560	2983560	Oh, Ploppé.
2986560	2988560	It sounds like she's, she's not. Okay.
2989560	2999560	See, the whole reason that you had to have Frodo and Sam is, is thematically, is because by the end of the journey when, when Frodo couldn't do it, Sam could do the rest of it.
3000560	3003560	And he was supposed to be the anchor back to the ordinary world.
3004560	3006560	That was the point of their friendship.
3007560	3011560	Well, it's, Jesus Christ Arch. It's, it's more that like, there's that final...
3012560	3013560	No, no. He literally was a manservant.
3014560	3019560	He was, he was. But there was that final scene where Frodo says, there's no veil between me and the Ring of Fire.
3020560	3027560	And he's basically saying that the Ring's influence has made him forget everything good in life and he is absorbed by nihilism.
3028560	3031560	And Sam had to be that anchor back to what was meaningful in life.
3031560	3035560	Constantly reminding him about the strawberries and everything else and good in the world.
3036560	3041560	Yeah. Yeah. But you don't need a Sam character for this kind of journey.
3046560	3047560	Always follow your nose.
3048560	3049560	Always follow your nose.
3050560	3051560	God damn it, Arch. How do you know?
3052560	3054560	It's a saying. How do you not know, Dev?
3056560	3059560	It's Gandalf. Fuck me. I hate it.
3061560	3065560	I love it because Barch is me and he is.
3066560	3067560	Thing is, I'm still not sold on it either.
3068560	3070560	You will be. Because Sauron was a Maiar as well.
3071560	3073560	Yeah, but he's a different Maiar. He's almost...
3074560	3075560	No. No, they're not.
3076560	3077560	The Maiar or the Maiar?
3078560	3081560	On the double fake, it's over, Barch. You lost. You got to have one.
3082560	3083560	Maiar or the Maiar?
3084560	3086560	I'm going to put Kibbs in my $20.
3087560	3090560	Listen, Dev. It was that or defeating Barch?
3091560	3092560	A worthy sacrifice.
3093560	3097560	You know, he really should have removed the blade from that first.
3098560	3100560	That's going to fuck up the composition of something awful.
3101560	3105560	Yeah, but the implication is that the handle is the gold and the blade is the silver.
3106560	3110560	Yep. Dev, do I need to teach you about how soft silver is?
3111560	3114560	Oh no, I know. But the show doesn't know. The show doesn't know.
3115560	3119560	And even then, you wouldn't mix the silver and the fucking gold. That's dumb too.
3119560	3125560	Well, the idea is they're mixing silver, gold, and mithril to make the magic of the rings.
3126560	3128560	Yeah, but they do not mix really, though.
3129560	3131560	Hold on, though. Hold on a second.
3133560	3139560	So, the original story was that they made all the rings. There was nine, five, and three at the same time.
3140560	3143560	But also that Sauron made a hidden ring at the same time.
3144560	3145560	Yes.
3146560	3147560	But they're already making three right now?
3147560	3148560	Yes.
3149560	3150560	They're making them at different times now.
3151560	3155560	That's why we've got to have like five fucking seasons so they can make the rings little by little.
3159560	3160560	Just drop that shit in.
3161560	3166560	This is how you make an alloy right here. You just fucking plump that bitch down there and voila.
3167560	3168560	It's like a magical...
3169560	3170560	Look, it's an eye!
3171560	3172560	Oh my god, it's evil.
3173560	3174560	Making cabbage soup.
3174560	3177560	There you go. It didn't need pressure, it just needed light stirring.
3181560	3182560	Like most metallic alloys.
3184560	3186560	They got to bend them.
3187560	3191560	Oh, that's brilliant. That's actually brilliant.
3196560	3201560	I prefer the scene in the movies where there are like five elves wailing on it with hammers.
3202560	3205560	Elrond is getting suspicious.
3206560	3208560	He's doing his CSI thing.
3209560	3213560	That paper would not be legible after this.
3214560	3215560	Yeah.
3216560	3217560	It's magic ink. Don't think about it.
3218560	3219560	Magic paper.
3220560	3222560	Oh, don't help. This isn't who he said he was.
3225560	3229560	Ah yes, completely uncut gems. Brilliant.
3230560	3231560	It's just pop rocks.
3235560	3239560	Whoops, I'm too late. Bitch already corrupted. Well, fuck.
3241560	3242560	Wait, how is it corrupted?
3243560	3245560	Wait, what if that's...
3247560	3248560	Sauron was just like...
3248560	3249560	Those are Sauron's rings.
3250560	3255560	Sauron was just like, listen, if you use gold and silver, it'll actually make them my rings.
3256560	3257560	Why?
3260560	3266560	Yes, you've already shown us this shot. You missed your opportunity to end credit screen.
3267560	3270560	Although, that being said, end credit screen in...
3271560	3272560	What, ten seconds?
3273560	3274560	We need to see what Halbran's doing.
3275560	3276560	He's going to Mordor, of course.
3278560	3281560	Yes, I'd like a tower right over there.
3282560	3284560	No, a little bit more to the right.
3284560	3291560	Now end credit in five, four, three, two, one.
3292560	3293560	Blackness.
3296560	3298560	Nice hovering your mouse ahead, Barch.
3301560	3302560	You little shit.
3303560	3308560	I like how they're now singing, how they were actually made, and they've shown that, no, they didn't do that.
3309560	3311560	I feel like I just had an hour-long aneurysm.
3312560	3313560	This is more funny.
3314560	3323560	No, no, the issue is, once more, they've completely violated absolutely everything.
3324560	3328560	There's no reason for the story to progress at this point.
3329560	3335560	The elves have made their rings completely separate from anything else.
3335560	3340560	Halbran had no influence on these three rings whatsoever beyond going,
3341560	3343560	maybe you should put them in a centrifuge instead.
3344560	3347560	There is no reason or rationale for him to have any power over them.
3348560	3357560	It was very specifically made clear in the original that the rings were made by Sauron's direction.
3358560	3363560	He'd pre-planned this. He had written it into those rings that they would be bound by the Wand Ring.
3363560	3367560	It's literally coded into them, but there's no reason for these rings to be.
3368560	3371560	Now, what is the rationale for making more?
3372560	3374560	They'll make up a rationale.
3375560	3378560	That's exactly the problem. They will just make it the fuck up.
3379560	3382560	Well, that's been the whole problem with the entire show since episode one.
3383560	3388560	It's all made up. None of this matters. None of this has mattered since the beginning.
3389560	3390560	None of this mattered now.
3390560	3396560	Let's assume that you wanted to do the exact same plot line, but good.
3397560	3402560	The plot already sucks, but let's assume all the major plot beats are going to be in place.
3403560	3408560	We're talking that the elves still need the mithril to stay alive.
3409560	3418560	Halbran is still going to be Sauron in the end and still finds Galadriel.
3418560	3421560	How would you do this show but better?
3422560	3429560	Well, you'd actually have to take more time and develop an actual blossoming relationship between Galadriel and Halbran.
3430560	3432560	There would have to be a real seduction there.
3433560	3437560	He would actually have to worm his way into places a little bit more.
3438560	3442560	He did that a bit on Numenor. He didn't do it anywhere else.
3442560	3449560	And honestly, it feels like they had to do that big battle scene in the Southlands to turn it into Mordor,
3450560	3459560	and they had to get Halbran from Mordor to Lindon to have the let's corrupt the elves bit to make the rings,
3460560	3463560	and then have him reveal himself. They just rushed it all. They had it all in one episode.
3464560	3467560	That should have been a full season on its own, Halbran with the elves.
3468560	3471560	This I'm about to agree with you, and so this is a question about time.
3472560	3479560	Halbran's character needed far more development, but it's a question of using the time.
3480560	3486560	The show has so much time, but it's wasted on stupid shit.
3487560	3492560	The problem is too, Halbran was sus from the beginning because he's a king of the Southlands.
3493560	3499560	We know that's not true. He's been set adrift by corsairs. We know that's not true.
3499560	3504560	This is an era of unrivalled peace, and he's in the middle of nowhere.
3505560	3515560	The setup is far too suspect for anyone to ever look at Halbran with a neutral view, because he's set up that way.
3516560	3522560	The show falls into its own trap, where it's like, okay, we need everyone to think that everybody's Sauron,
3523560	3529560	but that just means that your Sauron reveal will fall flat regardless of which character you make Sauron.
3530560	3536560	It's the same problem with the wizard. They've gone back and forth on him being good and evil like six or seven times,
3537560	3545560	and even now, the only claim to him being good is that he says that he's an Istar, and then there's a Maiar more correctly,
3546560	3547560	which, again, Sauron's a Maiar too.
3547560	3553560	There's also the obvious copyright problems here, and this is one of the things where Amazon is just going to do this
3554560	3562560	because they know the Tolkien estate can't challenge them, but the wizards are specifically a Third Age property.
3563560	3571560	Amazon does not have the copyright to them in the same way that they do not have the copyright to the hobbits, which is why they're harfoots.
3572560	3578560	Well, Arch, these are just going to be some new wizards that we haven't seen before, and they're all going to die before the Third Age.
3580560	3582560	That would be the way they'd have to do it.
3583560	3589560	This is something that I've seen with a lot of shows. Any show that has been made in the past five years,
3590560	3595560	that you see a lot of YouTube channels watching and complaining about, and it's like, oh my god, it's so bad.
3595560	3606560	I see this. I can see, deep within all the shit, the foundation of a possibly good show if they just did everything differently.
3607560	3615560	Ironically, the scenes between Halbaran and Galadriel in this show should have been the culmination of a story.
3616560	3621560	Instead, he recites a handful of times where Galadriel did a handful of things,
3621560	3626560	and that entire story could probably be compacted into a single hour or less.
3627560	3630560	It's not enough time, and there's not enough subtlety in the plot.
3631560	3635560	It needed more time to develop, and it needed more subtlety.
3636560	3641560	It should have been, what they should have done, that entire scene where Halbaran was like, okay, you made me strong, etc.
3642560	3649560	That should have been the big reveal. It shouldn't then have had a second reveal scene afterwards.
3649560	3654560	That should have been the big reveal, because they undermined the second reveal massively as well.
3655560	3665560	What you do is, you put them two up, you have like, oh, you know, you drove me, and then you hear the hammer blow of the rings being crafted like dum.
3666560	3672560	And then you have a flashback to Galadriel chasing him and driving him off so that he ended up on that raft.
3673560	3677560	You were the one who made me strong and had the dum of the rings being crafted.
3678560	3683560	And showing her, like, forcing him to run around and become strong and blah blah blah.
3684560	3685560	Make up something like that, yeah?
3686560	3690560	That would have been good, because at that point it would have been too fucking late.
3691560	3695560	Galadriel would have realised her error as it was already too late.
3696560	3701560	The rings were already crafted, Sauron's plot was already complete, and there's nothing she can do about it.
3702560	3708560	Instead now, we have to have some roundabout plot where a bunch of more rings need to be crafted.
3709560	3718560	It will require Galadriel to stay silent about this plot she knows is in the offing, for god only knows how many more seasons.
3719560	3726560	And it will require Halibrand to also make another master ring without any involvement in the other rings.
3727560	3731560	If the secret ingredients is Mithril, we should make another ring.
3732560	3738560	Just make a ring that says, like, 14 rings, and in the light bind them. Haha!
3739560	3749560	Just the new version. I also realised we didn't see the black elf, and we didn't see the dwarves this time around.
3750560	3752560	I guess they're just out. They're done.
3753560	3756560	I do think that the black elf storyline is complete though, because that sword arc is over.
3757560	3760560	His arc is gone. He has no reason to be on the show anymore.
3760560	3763560	They'll have to come up with one.
3764560	3773560	They won't. I think the story's moving on past that. I think he was just an introductory, like, to the whole fucking back lore as to why Mordor's foundation is.
3774560	3777560	Because there's an obsession with, we have to demystify everything and show you everything.
3778560	3787560	Well no, the problem now is, Halbrand's in Mordor, so now there's going to be a conflict with him and Adar, because Adar said specifically that he didn't want to serve Sauron.
3787560	3791560	And then there'll have to be a redemption arc for him, which will include black elf.
3792560	3797560	Well, we've got four more seasons to go to see.
3798560	3808560	You know what's exciting though? The next season's going to be great, and here's why. Because you know their budget's going to be lower, so there's going to be a serious quality drop in everything.
3809560	3813560	As the show goes on, it'll probably be comical, I had to hope, right?
3813560	3820560	Probably. Because already, the only thing that's really impressive about this show is the occasional visuals.
3821560	3827560	God, the problem too is the shooting. The shooting is so fucking bad.
3828560	3836560	Halbrand, when he is revealing that he is Sauron, you should be shooting him, you should have a slight shadow on his face.
3836560	3842560	Or he should look beatific, like he should look angelic almost, with a hint of darkness.
3843560	3848560	You should be shooting him from below and up, making him look sinister, and the actor too.
3849560	3858560	The actor does not deliver here, in the slightest. He looks weak, soft, fleshy, human, shitty.
3859560	3864560	I don't know if that's necessarily the actor's fault, or more so on the...
3865560	3871560	Because they waste the special effects. They should do more with it, with the elves. They should do more with it, with the Sauron reveal.
3872560	3883560	Because imagine if they used all that art and CG effort to really show dark tendrils wrapping around him, and then slowly wrapping around Gladiel, showing that his influence was, he was trying to corrupt her.
3883560	3890560	Again, you do this scene, you have the hammering of the ring in the background, you have the dark speak beginning to whisper, etc.
3891560	3903560	You could make this a fucking impactful scene, and already, already with the shit ingredients we have, already this is a fairly impactful scene.
3904560	3906560	Imagine if they'd done it well.
3907560	3911560	Imagine all the people.
3911560	3916560	But even if they did it well, it still undermines the entire story.
3917560	3925560	I just realized, the priestess character looks more otherworldly than anyone else in the show.
3926560	3931560	She does. It's because of the makeup they have her wear, and the fact that they shorten her hair and give her her contact lenses.
3932560	3937560	Yeah. The way she moves around and stuff, she actually looks like she's a creature from another world.
3937560	3943560	You know, I think the actress that played the main witch lady, she did a pretty good job, she was kind of creepy.
3944560	3951560	But the problem is, I feel bad for all these actors and actresses, even the good ones, is that, you know, what a waste.
3952560	3956560	What a waste of talent with a waste of skill.
3957560	3959560	Same for the CG artists and everyone else on board this project.
3960560	3965560	Like damn, all that fucking stuff wasted, because some fucking moron writers had to change a few things.
3965560	3972560	The Rings of Power audience is actually coping right now, because they are using that, like, at least it's not as bad as Tolkien's work.
3973560	3979560	And these are like, this is the Rings of Power audience, which goes to show that it's mostly made up of zoomers, because they're like, oh okay.
3980560	3984560	Lord of the Rings to them is Rings of Power. Like that's the Lord of the Rings.
3985560	3986560	I don't even think that's the case.
3987560	3991560	It's tragic, but it's true. A lot of people know, a lot of the newer generations, and I know them.
3991560	4000560	And my brothers, like, they're a decade younger than me. Do you ask them what Lord of the Rings is? Peter Jackson films? They'll be like, the what? The who?
4001560	4002560	Well hold on, hold on.
4003560	4004560	Wow, those are classics.
4005560	4006560	They still hold up to this day.
4007560	4008560	They do.
4009560	4014560	My girlfriend's a zoomer, and she's like, oh yeah, I watched the original LOPRs again.
4015560	4016560	Yeah, because you told them.
4017560	4018560	Oh no, she knew it before me.
4018560	4020560	Hmm, well you lucked out. You got a good dice roll.
4021560	4026560	Most people probably do know, but this is exactly what Amazon wants. Like, I keep making this point.
4027560	4032560	This will be the future. Amazon is trying to claim the Rings of Power, but Lord of the Rings. That's what they're trying to do.
4033560	4035560	They're trying to make this the Lord of the Rings.
4036560	4041560	And they would have succeeded if they'd put even the barest amount of effort into it.
4041560	4049560	Because people don't remember. Hell, if people don't remember the Peter Jackson movies, they don't remember the goddamn books. Like, Jesus Christ. None of these people have read the books.
4050560	4059560	Oh yeah, the books even more so. Like, you're lucky if they've seen the Lord of the Rings trilogy, or the Hobbit trilogy. You're even more lucky if they've read the books.
4060560	4066560	Amazon had an opportunity here to take over the Lord of the Rings, because they're already doing it. They're already redefining the Lord of the Rings.
4066560	4070560	They're already rewriting the story. They're already making shit out of whole cloth.
4071560	4076560	They have an opportunity here to just take it, and own it forever.
4077560	4086560	But they hired two fucking randoms off the goddamn street. I mean, they must give amazing blowjobs is the only explanation I can possibly posit.
4087560	4092560	You know what's interesting? They're doing exactly what Disney did to, like, the old Grimm's tales and stuff like that.
4093560	4107560	Where they're basically taking these ideas, because in the intellectual property sphere, if you take something that's in the, what do you call it, the free space, public domain, and you redefine it, and you make it your own, you can monetise it.
4107560	4117560	I mean, they do that with Conan all the time. The Conan video games that are coming out lately are a direct result of that, because Conan's in the public domain, if I'm 100% correct there, which I'm pretty sure it is.
4118560	4120560	Right now Winnie the Pooh is in the public domain now too.
4121560	4126560	Yep, so it means you can go and you can turn it into your own stuff, and then you can actually monetise it.
4126560	4140560	So technically, yes. What they're going to do is what Disney did. They're going to take those public domain ideas, and what they're going to try to do is warp it and twist it enough for the newer generations, by changing the lore and making it their own, that it will splinter as its own identity.
4141560	4159560	Yes. Now granted, there's a little bit of a difference here, because what Disney did was not take public domain. Disney took the things during a time when copyright basically didn't exist, and they changed it just enough to not make it the same thing, and they trademarked it specifically.
4159560	4169560	Like, Disney has no trademark over the original fairy tale, but they do have a trademark over their version of the fairy tale.
4170560	4180560	It was a clever distinction, which everybody even at the time saw was predatory, but there was no legal framework to stop them, and so, voila.
4181560	4188560	Whereas now, if you try to make a Snow White story, oh, you best believe there will be some mouse-haired lawyers under your door.
4189560	4194560	The problem with that is that the IP is actually enforced now, because it's been established under Disney.
4195560	4197560	Yes, it's enforced by a company.
4198560	4203560	Wait, so you can't make a story about Snow White, even though it's like...
4204560	4210560	You can technically do it in the fairy-use sense, but you can't monetize it or stuff like that.
4211560	4220560	What if you just don't use Disney design? The story of Snow White predates Disney.
4221560	4223560	There have been people that do that.
4224560	4229560	Like, the Alice games by American McGee, they didn't run afoul of Disney at all.
4230560	4232560	I'm not familiar with those.
4233560	4240560	You need to make it so substantially different that it is obviously different.
4241560	4246560	And even then, you are running a certain amount of risk. You are running a certain amount of gambit.
4247560	4252560	I just think American McGee might have run into some problem if he made Alice Blonde.
4253560	4261560	And the thing is, American McGee's Alice revamps the character, the setting, the story, everything.
4262560	4268560	It has virtually nothing to do with Alice anymore beyond the generalized aesthetics of Wonderland.
4269560	4273560	Yeah, that's true. They made it into Tim Burton's Wonderland, almost.
4273560	4282560	You need to be able to hold out the two products, and then you need to clearly be like, this is not the same as this.
4283560	4290560	Listen, though, listen. There's some quality hentai out there of American McGee's Alice getting with Disney's Alice.
4290560	4293560	My God, the merger's happening.
4294560	4300560	There was a point where this show seemed like it might have been good, but then they just dropped the ball so hard.
4301560	4306560	That just makes no sense to even somebody who isn't particularly familiar with the lore.
4307560	4312560	This show tries way too hard to explain everything of these big events that happened.
4312560	4319560	There's no real reason for us to really need to see it, but then the show just goes out of its way to be like,
4320560	4324560	Oh, look, look at the thing. Remember in the movies or the books?
4325560	4332560	Well, this is how the sausage is made, and you're left with the same sort of disgust.
4333560	4340560	I do like that it kept people guessing with the wizard thing. Maybe they did that thing a bit way too hard, though.
4340560	4341560	You liked that?
4342560	4356560	No, I liked a little bit how the wizard was behaving and stuff. I thought it was pretty funny, whether intentionally or unintentionally.
4357560	4367560	I also feel like they definitely introduced a bit too much and not spent enough time in places where they should have spent just to develop the more important aspects of the show.
4367560	4378560	Yeah, you know what I've realized about this? So I think we're all kind of in agreement that there's like a skeleton of a story that could have been good had they actually done it competently here.
4379560	4390560	I think what they're banking on is that like in 25 years after the show is done, and the zoomers are like middle aged, looking back with nostalgia goggles,
4390560	4395560	haven't seen the show since it first came out, they're going to think, oh, man, that was a good show.
4396560	4402560	You know, the seduction of Galadriel by Halbrand. Man, that was that that was really cool back in the day.
4403560	4410560	You know, oh, you had that neat scene where like the the wizard, he was he was bumbling around because he's like a newborn in an adult's body.
4411560	4418560	And like he he has to hang out with the very innocent Harfoot's like, oh, that was like there was some cool character interaction there.
4418560	4424560	And they're going to like be remembering a completely different show than the actual show that we just watched.
4425560	4429560	You're thinking it'll get the the Star Wars prequels kind of treatment.
4430560	4447560	But yeah, I don't think so. Because the thing is, if you rewatch the Star Wars prequels, they actually do have all of the setup required to deliver Palpatine is actually a pretty fucking conniving and shrewd political coup maker, you know.
4448560	4457560	All of the steps required to tell that story is there. They should have focused a lot more on it and they should have made a lot more out of it.
4458560	4470560	But here, the ingredients for Halbrand's seduction of Galadriel basically doesn't exist because he wasn't trying to seduce her up until the point where he was.
4470560	4478560	Like there was really no point previously where he was actively flirting with her or trying. Like suddenly it's like, be my queen.
4479560	4486560	What? This wasn't for if they had if they had had an actual romantic relationships previously.
4487560	4494560	OK, but they haven't. Like at what point previously have Halbrand and Galadriel interacted in that way?
4495560	4499560	Like the closest we get is them being sassy at one another occasionally.
4500560	4505560	There was that one scene, I think after the fight, and they were both sitting down on the logs.
4506560	4516560	And they kind of like had a weird look where she said, I felt it too. That was I think a couple episodes ago. That was it. It was one scene.
4517560	4519560	I don't even remember that fucking scene.
4519560	4529560	There were a couple scenes throughout the show that they tried to allude to the fact that they were kind of liking each other in a way, but they never really went far with it.
4530560	4539560	And they also never really did much with it other than they kept doing it. They planted the seeds for it, but they weren't like doing a really good job building it up.
4540560	4549560	Now, I do agree that that's what the showrunners think that they have done, because they've literally said so in interviews like 20 years. People totally love this. I don't think so.
4550560	4560560	I think in 20 years nobody will even remember that this was a thing. Or if they do, they'll just be like, remember when Amazon did something really stupid and it destroyed their studio? Yeah.
4560560	4562560	I remember.
4563560	4571560	There's a lot of epics that have come out, you know, in terms of TV shows and movies. Lord of the Rings, pretty epic.
4572560	4577560	Harry Potter, I think, qualifies as something that people will still rewatch 10, 20, 50 years down the road.
4578560	4588560	You know, there's a lot of these shows and a lot of these stories, you know, the original Game of Thrones in the last season, but you know, there's this stuff that will stand the test of time.
4589560	4595560	Stuff that you could dig up years and years and years later. People will still watch and be like, that was good. Maybe a little bit dated, you know.
4596560	4602560	I recently rewatched the original Lord of the Rings trilogy. It's slightly dated, but you know what? It's still really, really good.
4602560	4615560	This show, I think, will be forgotten about. No one watches it in 20 years. No one gives a fuck. No one's going back to their old DVD box sets or whatever. This show will just be gone.
4616560	4621560	If it will be remembered at all, it will be remembered as Amazon's epic failure.
4622560	4635560	Yes. It will be remembered for that $5 billion price tag, where they just burnt a giant pile of money like the Joker. What a waste of time this was. God damn it.
4637560	4639560	I don't know what you were expecting.
