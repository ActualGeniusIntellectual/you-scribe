1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,260
It's October 1st, and you know what that means?

2
00:00:02,260 --> 00:00:03,260
Halloween.

3
00:00:03,260 --> 00:00:08,240
If you're not on the Short Fight Otaku Community Minecraft server yet, get yourself in there.

4
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:13,640
Join the SFO Discord, get on the server, because we are doing a community Halloween event.

5
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:19,020
You have one month to build something cool and Halloween themed on the Halloween map.

6
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:22,780
And at the end of the month, on the 31st, I'll stream everyone's builds and we'll

7
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:23,780
have a good time with it.

8
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:25,060
So get yourself in there.

9
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:31,820
The month begins.

10
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:38,180
For anyone who keeps a pulse on leftist discourse online, you probably noticed this slow trend

11
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:40,640
build up over the past couple months.

12
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:44,740
Not large enough to become the mainstream discourse, not big enough to be a meme, but

13
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:47,340
certainly bubbling in the background.

14
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:51,340
And it is anti-bedtime action.

15
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:52,340
That's right.

16
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:58,280
A reminder that bedtimes are not trans-historical, they're a capitalist concept invented in

17
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:02,060
Victorian England in order to enforce labor discipline.

18
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:05,740
Before capitalism, people could choose when they wanted to go to bed, and it will be the

19
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:07,640
same under communism.

20
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:10,720
We have to liberate children from bedtimes, guys.

21
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:15,460
There can be no emancipation without the abolition of a circadian rhythm.

22
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:17,500
Teenagers of the world unite.

23
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:20,420
You have nothing to lose but your curfews.

24
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:24,460
Much like with other oppressive systems, which folks are calling for the abolition

25
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:29,700
of, it's not about simply getting rid of bedtime, but about addressing the other issues

26
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:34,820
that require bedtimes, that is, the work and school systems that aren't properly built

27
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:35,820
for humans.

28
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:39,980
Okay, so you want to be able to sleep in until like 10 or 11, go to work, come home at what,

29
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:43,340
8 or 9 after, you know, an 8 hour day's work?

30
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:44,460
Have even less time?

31
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:48,060
Because I guarantee you, you probably sleep 12 hours, you're still going to bed before

32
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:49,060
midnight.

33
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:53,340
The night has caused a schism, believe it or not, on the left.

34
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:54,780
Here's this person here.

35
00:01:54,780 --> 00:02:00,940
This bear eats fascists, a libertarian socialist, a mutualist, and a dad, I assume dad is why

36
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:02,620
he has this opinion.

37
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:09,140
Capitalism is a construct, race is a construct, gender is a construct, but bedtime is real.

38
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:12,300
Technically it's still a construct.

39
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:16,820
It's real and absolutely essential for health and the well-being of tiny people who do not

40
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:18,620
have the capacity to self-regulate.

41
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:21,420
If you aren't a parent, I don't give a fuck about anything you have to say on the

42
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:22,420
topic.

43
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:24,100
Oh, it's very interesting, isn't it?

44
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:28,460
Obvious constructs are suddenly real when you have use for them.

45
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:29,460
Hmm.

46
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:33,340
And this logic here, you can't have an opinion unless you're part of a certain group that

47
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:35,300
actually cares about the topic, eh?

48
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:39,500
Well, what if the owners of the means of production said, if you're not a capitalist, I don't

49
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:42,300
give a fuck about anything you have to say on the topic of capitalism.

50
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:43,300
Same logic.

51
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:45,920
Here's from the antisocial social anarchist.

52
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:49,120
Why is there so much conflict over bedtime abolition?

53
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:53,020
Like isn't it well-known that forcing people to get up out of their natural circadian rhythms

54
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:54,020
is unhealthy?

55
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:56,980
I absolutely refuse to believe that these people are real, like this has to be a troll

56
00:02:56,980 --> 00:02:59,520
account or fucking something.

57
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:00,520
Hold on.

58
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:04,440
This account is operated by nine-year-old federal agents, so maybe it is a troll account.

59
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:06,640
Wait, maybe it's not.

60
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:07,640
Nope.

61
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:09,080
Maybe, maybe it's not.

62
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:11,400
Oh god, here's a fucking essay on it.

63
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:15,440
Always confused by self-described radicals who see a radical or abolitionist proposal

64
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:18,600
about something they are unfamiliar with or haven't considered and respond by rejecting

65
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:19,600
it out of hand.

66
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:22,040
Seems to be a much more of a conservative reaction than a radical one.

67
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:26,040
I think an actual radical response to something like that is, even if the idea isn't fully

68
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:30,360
thought through or contains contradictions, to materially analyze it and to draw out the

69
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:32,060
essential critique at its strongest.

70
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:35,840
This can be for anything really, as dominant social conditioning positions, even the most

71
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,840
established and well-researched ideas as absurd.

72
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:41,860
It's actually important that people who think that they run counter to that to actually

73
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:44,680
do so and not fall back into the same easy dismissals.

74
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:49,640
So the next time when you see radical teenagers and even outright children talk about bedtime

75
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:56,320
abolition, maybe use that as an opportunity to talk about the oppressive nature of capitalist

76
00:03:56,320 --> 00:04:02,520
time, not dismiss kids reacting to their very real unfreedoms with the right impulses.

77
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:09,040
Okay, um, firstly, capitalist time, guys.

78
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,840
Time is a capitalist construct.

79
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:16,680
But also, this whole thing basically reads, if you hear a really dumbfuck idea, don't

80
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:19,320
dismiss it as the dumbfuck idea that it is.

81
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:24,320
This is the people who deconstruct everything without any skills to actually reconstruct

82
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,320
anything out of it.

83
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:26,320
It's not just bedtime, though.

84
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:29,000
I don't understand why some people insist on treating children like they should have

85
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,640
no voice just because they're children.

86
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:32,160
Eat what I make or you don't eat.

87
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,040
Doesn't that sound crazy to y'all?

88
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,040
No.

89
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,040
The kids aren't buying the food.

90
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,920
The kids aren't making the food.

91
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:45,080
If your child makes a bit of money on the side and then buys his own food, fine.

92
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:46,720
That's his food.

93
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:52,720
But if he's eating on your dime, he eats what you make.

94
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:53,720
This is insane.

95
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:56,320
I think it's because these people don't actually respect labor.

96
00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:00,480
If you really wanted to go down the rabbit hole logically, and there's not an ounce of

97
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:02,520
logic in these people's brains, but fuck it.

98
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:05,720
They don't actually respect labor because the parents have to labor to provide for the

99
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:06,720
children.

100
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:09,640
And because they don't actually respect labor, which is why they talk about stealing property

101
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:14,520
and collectivizing labor all the time, they don't give a shit that parents have to work

102
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:15,940
to provide for their kids.

103
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:17,360
The kids should get what they want.

104
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,360
It's amazing.

105
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,360
Look at this dude.

106
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,360
Look at this fucking guy.

107
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,360
Are you an adult?

108
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,360
It looks like it.

109
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,360
And you're still talking like this?

110
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,360
It's wild to me.

111
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:29,320
I can't believe this is where leftist discourse has gone, at least in this corner of the internet.

112
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:33,900
As soon as the anarchists are done dismantling the oppressive framework of having a bedtime,

113
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:38,000
I assume their next target is going after the fascism of being told not to eat all their

114
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,780
Halloween candy in one sitting?

115
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:40,900
Watch out, Sargon.

116
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:45,620
The insurrectionary autonomous commune of Daniel's room is going to lead the world towards

117
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:50,120
a brighter future which is free of the oppressive hierarchy of the parenting class.

118
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:52,660
No bedtime, no veggies, no masters.

119
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:54,260
Oh yeah, there's this dude.

120
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:55,260
This guy's a tankie.

121
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:56,940
He's like a straight up Marxist-Leninist.

122
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:57,940
I was following him for a while.

123
00:05:57,940 --> 00:06:01,380
I asked very good faith, honest questions, and he just eventually just blocked me because

124
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:04,180
he got tired of having to answer for all of his nonsense.

125
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:07,140
Under capitalism, the parents are the child's first oppressor.

126
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:09,100
School is the second and workplace is the third.

127
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:13,620
Funny as fuck coming from a Soviet fan, somebody who stands one of the most oppressive governments

128
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:14,700
in history.

129
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:17,840
But still, this guy sounds like he's stuck in that phase that teenagers get in when they

130
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:19,700
rebel against their parents.

131
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:20,700
Look at this.

132
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:21,700
This is so fucking weird.

133
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:24,500
This guy's like a sociopath or something.

134
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:26,340
Will your parents get the wall?

135
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:29,060
Yes, no, or gulag instead?

136
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:30,260
Read this, read this.

137
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:32,940
My dad will get the wall because of his Reagan rhetoric.

138
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:37,340
Due to the lines of patriarchy, mothers are less extreme conspirators to the authoritarian

139
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:38,340
fascists.

140
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:40,340
They're dead, but no re-education camp.

141
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:43,620
My mother is a landlord, but I think if the revolution comes, I could get her to renounce

142
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:44,620
her evil ways.

143
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:45,960
Hopefully, comrade.

144
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:49,300
These people are, I don't want to say insane, they're not insane.

145
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:52,140
They are of sound mind, but they're homicidal.

146
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:57,340
They're so deep into their own nonsense that they've basically given themselves the perfect

147
00:06:57,340 --> 00:07:02,300
reason to hate other people and to oppress other people and feel good about it.

148
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:03,820
My dad was an investment banker.

149
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:05,280
My mom was a VP at Exxon.

150
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,780
I write about social justice regarding women.

151
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:10,540
No one has any idea how that happened.

152
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:16,060
Listen, everybody knows how that works, with the exception of you and your family.

153
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:17,060
We all know what happened.

154
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:21,200
You're a spoiled, rich kid who wanted to rebel against your parents, ended up doing

155
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:25,920
something completely different, got radicalized, and now you likely don't have a real relationship

156
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:26,920
with them.

157
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,560
Bored, trust-fund kids always end up turning into champagne socialists and talking all

158
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:32,560
about it on Twitter.

159
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,560
25.

160
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:35,480
A BA in journalism.

161
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:37,560
Communist, politics, and Star Trek.

162
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:40,580
Disabled, neurodivergent, bisexual, she-they.

163
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:43,280
I grew up extremely wealthy.

164
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:44,280
Of course you did.

165
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:47,400
That's the only way you can afford to have a bio like that.

166
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:52,620
A few days ago, I took a medium dose of acid and wrote for several hours straight and admitted

167
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:54,640
some things to myself, mostly about money.

168
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,080
Let's start here.

169
00:07:56,080 --> 00:08:01,720
Last August, my mom gave me $100,000 for my birthday.

170
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:06,800
I resented her for this, and also suppressed the resentment.

171
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,080
Oh my fucking god.

172
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:13,080
Yes, you are a magnificent adult baby, dude, jesus.

173
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:17,760
When you are the bourgeoisie and your socialist radicalization makes you hate yourself for

174
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:18,760
it.

175
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:22,360
I wrote for maybe 12 hours straight and eventually turned into a sort of spontaneous dialogue

176
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:25,440
between the person I am on acid and the person I am sober.

177
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:28,460
He told me a bunch of things I needed to hear but didn't want to.

178
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:33,040
He told me, you've been feeling social pressure to pretend like you have a financial health

179
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:37,160
that is entirely about your savings and your income, and it's just not true at all.

180
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:40,120
The truth is that if you ran out of money, your parents would send you more because they

181
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,120
love you.

182
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:44,160
The truth is, your finances aren't separate from your parents' finances, and they never

183
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:45,160
have been.

184
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:48,880
You resent your mom for sending you $100,000 because she forcefully reminded you of this

185
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:49,880
fact.

186
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:55,360
Man, if I could get $100,000 for my birthday, I would blow this business of mine up no

187
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,360
problem.

188
00:08:56,360 --> 00:09:00,520
It's almost like he never learned what money was, how much it was actually worth, how to

189
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:02,000
properly use it.

190
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,560
The truth is that for you, money is a game you play with your parents.

191
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:09,600
The most important thing you do to get money is to not piss off your parents so much that

192
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,800
they cut you off.

193
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,760
And then I was like, oh my god, am I a spoiled rich kid?

194
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,480
Am I a trust-fun baby kind of?

195
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:17,600
That's even worse, jesus.

196
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,600
Yes.

197
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:24,400
So we have a group of emotionally stunted rich kid socialists who believe that part

198
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:30,820
of their ideology, their grand scheme of equalization, means abolishing things that children need.

199
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:34,360
Like bedtimes, or healthy food, or structure in their lives.

200
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:37,560
Of course you can also just straight up abolish the family too, that's something socialists

201
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:39,760
have been talking about for a very long time.

202
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:43,640
Abolish the nuclear family has been a part of the left since the radical feminists of

203
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:44,640
the 1970s.

204
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:49,440
And if you want to see how extreme this mentality goes, all you have to do is read the Commune

205
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:52,560
magazine's 6 Steps to Abolish the Family.

206
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:53,560
1.

207
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:54,560
Set up a protest kitchen.

208
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:57,160
The best starting point to abolish the family is a massive insurrection.

209
00:09:57,160 --> 00:10:00,960
Come together with others at protest camps, street barricades, square occupations, seized

210
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:06,400
factories, building takeovers, and other liberated zones.

211
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:10,320
There generate the means of collective survival, expanding the insurrection.

212
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:13,280
Begin with a collective protest kitchen, feeding any and all.

213
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:17,040
Yeah, we saw how well the Chaz grew food, eh?

214
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,040
2.

215
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:20,760
Expand insurgent social reproduction.

216
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:22,840
You're literally seizing the means of reproduction.

217
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:25,120
I know it's an old joke, but it's fucking right here.

218
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:29,380
As the insurgency grows, continue the process of family abolition by deepening shared practices

219
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:30,600
of mutual care.

220
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:34,360
Make the protest camp, rebel territory, the collective farm, or the housing block committee

221
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:37,040
capable of welcoming and supporting many new people.

222
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:40,120
Form self-organized shared sleeping areas for safety.

223
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:42,520
That sounds like it'd be the most unsafe fucking thing.

224
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:46,960
Shit, set up cooperative childcare to support the full involvement of parents.

225
00:10:46,960 --> 00:11:04,760
3.

226
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:05,760
Build communes.

227
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:09,440
As new communist production begins in factories and farms, family abolition can take root

228
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,860
in permanent communes of collective social reproduction.

229
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:15,500
The protest kitchen becomes a permanent canteen where everyone in the area cooks and eats

230
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:16,500
their meals.

231
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:19,220
The protest tent becomes a center for all regular medical care.

232
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:24,420
Childcare areas become criches where children can learn and grow together over years.

233
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:28,020
Private groups of bedrooms are still available for people that want to form intimate family-like

234
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:32,540
units or live with their kids, but most of life takes place in shared collective space.

235
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:37,660
The old, atomized, single-family homes dependent on constant car use and individual consumption

236
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:38,660
are ended.

237
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:41,420
On this basis, humanity can collectively address climate change.

238
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:46,680
It literally sounds like anarcho-primitivism, reversing all the progress that we've made

239
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:49,880
and going back to living in, like, tents in the bush.

240
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:50,880
No thank you.

241
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:54,380
Additionally, it also sounds like an environment where you have no privacy, because remember,

242
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:58,580
these people don't respect privacy because the personal is political.

243
00:11:58,580 --> 00:11:59,580
4.

244
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:01,420
Combat the return of the family.

245
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:04,820
Defend the commune as the most free way of organizing social reproduction.

246
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:07,500
Yeah, so when you pair bond…

247
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:12,820
When you pair bond, as humans, generally, but not always, you want to keep that relationship

248
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:15,340
at least somewhat exclusive, and you care for your own kids.

249
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:20,780
I have the feeling this would have to be rigorously enforced on people who kinda just want exclusive

250
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:25,380
monogamous relationships.

251
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:28,700
Those seeking a return to the family as an isolated economic unit are counter-revolutionaries.

252
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:34,140
Alright, alright, so if you want your GF and you want to have your kids, you're a counter-revolutionary,

253
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:35,140
guys.

254
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:36,140
5.

255
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:37,420
The children of the commune.

256
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:39,680
Through the commune, offer a better world for children.

257
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:42,620
As a neighbor and friend in a world where the nuclear family no longer disposes of the

258
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:47,340
lives of children, everyone is called upon to creatively and collectively intervene into

259
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:49,120
abusive parental relationships.

260
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:52,600
Through the commune, a parent or child not dependent on the family can opt out of a messed

261
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:55,460
up dynamic when it isn't working knowing everyone will be cared for.

262
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:58,500
If you've reached this step, you have succeeded in abolishing the family.

263
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:02,680
You have freed queer love and feminist care to create a basis for human flourishing.

264
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:07,720
None of this is true or accurate to how people live or want to live.

265
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:13,040
If I were a parent, I wouldn't want a complete and total lack of privacy, or the ability

266
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:18,600
of a mob with absolutely no accountability coming in and just taking my kids.

267
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:19,600
6.

268
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,220
Expand opportunities for chosen survival.

269
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:26,400
If global communizing insurgency doesn't emerge, do your best with the imperfect options available.

270
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:29,640
Fight to destroy the white supremacist states which reinforce the violence of the family.

271
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:32,480
You know what, this sounds like it was written by somebody who was just like beat by their

272
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:33,760
parents or something.

273
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:37,860
Or you know, like the previous people, they're a rich kid who despises being rich.

274
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:39,360
So let's go down the list here.

275
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,160
These people hate their parents.

276
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:43,100
They hate their kids when they have them.

277
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:44,260
They hate their families.

278
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:46,780
They hate all of the things that families do.

279
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:48,000
They hate rules.

280
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,440
They hate mealtimes.

281
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:50,440
They hate bedtimes.

282
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:53,560
I haven't found any evidence of this yet, but they probably hate bath times too.

283
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:56,200
We're not talking about adult human beings here.

284
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:59,480
We're talking about old infants, it sounds like.

285
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:03,320
People who never really progressed out of that phase of their life.

286
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:08,320
And so now they're 30 or 35 and they're stuck on Twitter constantly crying about how awful

287
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:11,440
it was that when they were 10 their parents put them to bed and maybe they could have

288
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:15,160
stayed up another half an hour and so they're lying in bed in the darkness just not falling

289
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:16,740
asleep and being grumpy about it.

290
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:19,520
These people are hilariously ridiculous.

291
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:23,200
And thank god their ideas are never coming to pass because they would fuck up children

292
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:27,060
way harder than anything the modern world has done so far.

293
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:29,280
Like you think TikTok zoomers are obnoxious?

294
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:35,240
Imagine an entire generation of kids who believe that rebelling against bedtime is praxis.

295
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:37,480
Alright guys, that about does it for me.

296
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:42,060
Because it's October 1st, Halloween streams begin tonight on Game Boomers Live, twitch.tv

297
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:43,560
slash game boomers.

298
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:47,400
My girlfriend and I are going to play American McGee's Alice.

299
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:50,040
So make sure to drop in tonight or else you're banned.

300
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:51,040
I'll see you there.

301
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:51,880
I love you.
