0	2260	It's October 1st, and you know what that means?
2260	3260	Halloween.
3260	8240	If you're not on the Short Fight Otaku Community Minecraft server yet, get yourself in there.
8240	13640	Join the SFO Discord, get on the server, because we are doing a community Halloween event.
13640	19020	You have one month to build something cool and Halloween themed on the Halloween map.
19020	22780	And at the end of the month, on the 31st, I'll stream everyone's builds and we'll
22780	23780	have a good time with it.
23780	25060	So get yourself in there.
25060	31820	The month begins.
31820	38180	For anyone who keeps a pulse on leftist discourse online, you probably noticed this slow trend
38180	40640	build up over the past couple months.
40640	44740	Not large enough to become the mainstream discourse, not big enough to be a meme, but
44740	47340	certainly bubbling in the background.
47340	51340	And it is anti-bedtime action.
51340	52340	That's right.
52340	58280	A reminder that bedtimes are not trans-historical, they're a capitalist concept invented in
58280	62060	Victorian England in order to enforce labor discipline.
62060	65740	Before capitalism, people could choose when they wanted to go to bed, and it will be the
65740	67640	same under communism.
67640	70720	We have to liberate children from bedtimes, guys.
70720	75460	There can be no emancipation without the abolition of a circadian rhythm.
75460	77500	Teenagers of the world unite.
77500	80420	You have nothing to lose but your curfews.
80420	84460	Much like with other oppressive systems, which folks are calling for the abolition
84460	89700	of, it's not about simply getting rid of bedtime, but about addressing the other issues
89700	94820	that require bedtimes, that is, the work and school systems that aren't properly built
94820	95820	for humans.
95820	99980	Okay, so you want to be able to sleep in until like 10 or 11, go to work, come home at what,
99980	103340	8 or 9 after, you know, an 8 hour day's work?
103340	104460	Have even less time?
104460	108060	Because I guarantee you, you probably sleep 12 hours, you're still going to bed before
108060	109060	midnight.
109060	113340	The night has caused a schism, believe it or not, on the left.
113340	114780	Here's this person here.
114780	120940	This bear eats fascists, a libertarian socialist, a mutualist, and a dad, I assume dad is why
120940	122620	he has this opinion.
122620	129140	Capitalism is a construct, race is a construct, gender is a construct, but bedtime is real.
129140	132300	Technically it's still a construct.
132300	136820	It's real and absolutely essential for health and the well-being of tiny people who do not
136820	138620	have the capacity to self-regulate.
138620	141420	If you aren't a parent, I don't give a fuck about anything you have to say on the
141420	142420	topic.
142420	144100	Oh, it's very interesting, isn't it?
144100	148460	Obvious constructs are suddenly real when you have use for them.
148460	149460	Hmm.
149460	153340	And this logic here, you can't have an opinion unless you're part of a certain group that
153340	155300	actually cares about the topic, eh?
155300	159500	Well, what if the owners of the means of production said, if you're not a capitalist, I don't
159500	162300	give a fuck about anything you have to say on the topic of capitalism.
162300	163300	Same logic.
163300	165920	Here's from the antisocial social anarchist.
165920	169120	Why is there so much conflict over bedtime abolition?
169120	173020	Like isn't it well-known that forcing people to get up out of their natural circadian rhythms
173020	174020	is unhealthy?
174020	176980	I absolutely refuse to believe that these people are real, like this has to be a troll
176980	179520	account or fucking something.
179520	180520	Hold on.
180520	184440	This account is operated by nine-year-old federal agents, so maybe it is a troll account.
184440	186640	Wait, maybe it's not.
186640	187640	Nope.
187640	189080	Maybe, maybe it's not.
189080	191400	Oh god, here's a fucking essay on it.
191400	195440	Always confused by self-described radicals who see a radical or abolitionist proposal
195480	198600	about something they are unfamiliar with or haven't considered and respond by rejecting
198600	199600	it out of hand.
199600	202040	Seems to be a much more of a conservative reaction than a radical one.
202040	206040	I think an actual radical response to something like that is, even if the idea isn't fully
206040	210360	thought through or contains contradictions, to materially analyze it and to draw out the
210360	212060	essential critique at its strongest.
212060	215840	This can be for anything really, as dominant social conditioning positions, even the most
215840	218840	established and well-researched ideas as absurd.
218840	221860	It's actually important that people who think that they run counter to that to actually
221860	224680	do so and not fall back into the same easy dismissals.
224920	229640	So the next time when you see radical teenagers and even outright children talk about bedtime
229640	236320	abolition, maybe use that as an opportunity to talk about the oppressive nature of capitalist
236320	242520	time, not dismiss kids reacting to their very real unfreedoms with the right impulses.
242520	249040	Okay, um, firstly, capitalist time, guys.
249040	250840	Time is a capitalist construct.
251360	256680	But also, this whole thing basically reads, if you hear a really dumbfuck idea, don't
256680	259320	dismiss it as the dumbfuck idea that it is.
259320	264320	This is the people who deconstruct everything without any skills to actually reconstruct
264320	265320	anything out of it.
265320	266320	It's not just bedtime, though.
266320	269000	I don't understand why some people insist on treating children like they should have
269000	270640	no voice just because they're children.
270640	272160	Eat what I make or you don't eat.
272160	274040	Doesn't that sound crazy to y'all?
274040	275040	No.
275040	277040	The kids aren't buying the food.
277040	278920	The kids aren't making the food.
279520	285080	If your child makes a bit of money on the side and then buys his own food, fine.
285080	286720	That's his food.
286720	292720	But if he's eating on your dime, he eats what you make.
292720	293720	This is insane.
293720	296320	I think it's because these people don't actually respect labor.
296320	300480	If you really wanted to go down the rabbit hole logically, and there's not an ounce of
300480	302520	logic in these people's brains, but fuck it.
302520	305720	They don't actually respect labor because the parents have to labor to provide for the
305720	306720	children.
306720	309640	And because they don't actually respect labor, which is why they talk about stealing property
309640	314520	and collectivizing labor all the time, they don't give a shit that parents have to work
314520	315940	to provide for their kids.
315940	317360	The kids should get what they want.
317360	318360	It's amazing.
318360	319360	Look at this dude.
319360	320360	Look at this fucking guy.
320360	321360	Are you an adult?
321360	322360	It looks like it.
322360	323360	And you're still talking like this?
323360	324360	It's wild to me.
324360	329320	I can't believe this is where leftist discourse has gone, at least in this corner of the internet.
329320	333900	As soon as the anarchists are done dismantling the oppressive framework of having a bedtime,
333900	338000	I assume their next target is going after the fascism of being told not to eat all their
338000	339780	Halloween candy in one sitting?
339780	340900	Watch out, Sargon.
340900	345620	The insurrectionary autonomous commune of Daniel's room is going to lead the world towards
345620	350120	a brighter future which is free of the oppressive hierarchy of the parenting class.
350120	352660	No bedtime, no veggies, no masters.
352660	354260	Oh yeah, there's this dude.
354260	355260	This guy's a tankie.
355260	356940	He's like a straight up Marxist-Leninist.
356940	357940	I was following him for a while.
357940	361380	I asked very good faith, honest questions, and he just eventually just blocked me because
361380	364180	he got tired of having to answer for all of his nonsense.
364180	367140	Under capitalism, the parents are the child's first oppressor.
367140	369100	School is the second and workplace is the third.
369100	373620	Funny as fuck coming from a Soviet fan, somebody who stands one of the most oppressive governments
373620	374700	in history.
374700	377840	But still, this guy sounds like he's stuck in that phase that teenagers get in when they
377840	379700	rebel against their parents.
379700	380700	Look at this.
380700	381700	This is so fucking weird.
381700	384500	This guy's like a sociopath or something.
384500	386340	Will your parents get the wall?
386340	389060	Yes, no, or gulag instead?
389060	390260	Read this, read this.
390260	392940	My dad will get the wall because of his Reagan rhetoric.
392940	397340	Due to the lines of patriarchy, mothers are less extreme conspirators to the authoritarian
397340	398340	fascists.
398340	400340	They're dead, but no re-education camp.
400340	403620	My mother is a landlord, but I think if the revolution comes, I could get her to renounce
403620	404620	her evil ways.
404620	405960	Hopefully, comrade.
405960	409300	These people are, I don't want to say insane, they're not insane.
409300	412140	They are of sound mind, but they're homicidal.
412140	417340	They're so deep into their own nonsense that they've basically given themselves the perfect
417340	422300	reason to hate other people and to oppress other people and feel good about it.
422300	423820	My dad was an investment banker.
423820	425280	My mom was a VP at Exxon.
425280	427780	I write about social justice regarding women.
427780	430540	No one has any idea how that happened.
430540	436060	Listen, everybody knows how that works, with the exception of you and your family.
436060	437060	We all know what happened.
437060	441200	You're a spoiled, rich kid who wanted to rebel against your parents, ended up doing
441200	445920	something completely different, got radicalized, and now you likely don't have a real relationship
445920	446920	with them.
447000	451560	Bored, trust-fund kids always end up turning into champagne socialists and talking all
451560	452560	about it on Twitter.
452560	453560	25.
453560	455480	A BA in journalism.
455480	457560	Communist, politics, and Star Trek.
457560	460580	Disabled, neurodivergent, bisexual, she-they.
460580	463280	I grew up extremely wealthy.
463280	464280	Of course you did.
464280	467400	That's the only way you can afford to have a bio like that.
467400	472620	A few days ago, I took a medium dose of acid and wrote for several hours straight and admitted
472620	474640	some things to myself, mostly about money.
474640	476080	Let's start here.
476080	481720	Last August, my mom gave me $100,000 for my birthday.
481720	486800	I resented her for this, and also suppressed the resentment.
486800	489080	Oh my fucking god.
489080	493080	Yes, you are a magnificent adult baby, dude, jesus.
493080	497760	When you are the bourgeoisie and your socialist radicalization makes you hate yourself for
497760	498760	it.
498760	502360	I wrote for maybe 12 hours straight and eventually turned into a sort of spontaneous dialogue
502360	505440	between the person I am on acid and the person I am sober.
505440	508460	He told me a bunch of things I needed to hear but didn't want to.
508460	513040	He told me, you've been feeling social pressure to pretend like you have a financial health
513040	517160	that is entirely about your savings and your income, and it's just not true at all.
517160	520120	The truth is that if you ran out of money, your parents would send you more because they
520120	521120	love you.
521120	524160	The truth is, your finances aren't separate from your parents' finances, and they never
524160	525160	have been.
525160	528880	You resent your mom for sending you $100,000 because she forcefully reminded you of this
528880	529880	fact.
529880	535360	Man, if I could get $100,000 for my birthday, I would blow this business of mine up no
535360	536360	problem.
536360	540520	It's almost like he never learned what money was, how much it was actually worth, how to
540520	542000	properly use it.
542000	545560	The truth is that for you, money is a game you play with your parents.
545560	549600	The most important thing you do to get money is to not piss off your parents so much that
549600	550800	they cut you off.
550800	553760	And then I was like, oh my god, am I a spoiled rich kid?
553760	555480	Am I a trust-fun baby kind of?
555480	557600	That's even worse, jesus.
557600	558600	Yes.
558600	564400	So we have a group of emotionally stunted rich kid socialists who believe that part
564440	570820	of their ideology, their grand scheme of equalization, means abolishing things that children need.
570820	574360	Like bedtimes, or healthy food, or structure in their lives.
574360	577560	Of course you can also just straight up abolish the family too, that's something socialists
577560	579760	have been talking about for a very long time.
579760	583640	Abolish the nuclear family has been a part of the left since the radical feminists of
583640	584640	the 1970s.
584640	589440	And if you want to see how extreme this mentality goes, all you have to do is read the Commune
589440	592560	magazine's 6 Steps to Abolish the Family.
592560	593560	1.
593560	594560	Set up a protest kitchen.
594560	597160	The best starting point to abolish the family is a massive insurrection.
597160	600960	Come together with others at protest camps, street barricades, square occupations, seized
600960	606400	factories, building takeovers, and other liberated zones.
606400	610320	There generate the means of collective survival, expanding the insurrection.
610320	613280	Begin with a collective protest kitchen, feeding any and all.
613280	617040	Yeah, we saw how well the Chaz grew food, eh?
617040	618040	2.
618040	620760	Expand insurgent social reproduction.
620760	622840	You're literally seizing the means of reproduction.
622840	625120	I know it's an old joke, but it's fucking right here.
625120	629380	As the insurgency grows, continue the process of family abolition by deepening shared practices
629380	630600	of mutual care.
630600	634360	Make the protest camp, rebel territory, the collective farm, or the housing block committee
634360	637040	capable of welcoming and supporting many new people.
637040	640120	Form self-organized shared sleeping areas for safety.
640120	642520	That sounds like it'd be the most unsafe fucking thing.
642520	646960	Shit, set up cooperative childcare to support the full involvement of parents.
646960	664760	3.
664760	665760	Build communes.
665760	669440	As new communist production begins in factories and farms, family abolition can take root
669440	671860	in permanent communes of collective social reproduction.
671860	675500	The protest kitchen becomes a permanent canteen where everyone in the area cooks and eats
675500	676500	their meals.
676540	679220	The protest tent becomes a center for all regular medical care.
679220	684420	Childcare areas become criches where children can learn and grow together over years.
684420	688020	Private groups of bedrooms are still available for people that want to form intimate family-like
688020	692540	units or live with their kids, but most of life takes place in shared collective space.
692540	697660	The old, atomized, single-family homes dependent on constant car use and individual consumption
697660	698660	are ended.
698660	701420	On this basis, humanity can collectively address climate change.
701420	706680	It literally sounds like anarcho-primitivism, reversing all the progress that we've made
706680	709880	and going back to living in, like, tents in the bush.
709880	710880	No thank you.
710880	714380	Additionally, it also sounds like an environment where you have no privacy, because remember,
714380	718580	these people don't respect privacy because the personal is political.
718580	719580	4.
719580	721420	Combat the return of the family.
721420	724820	Defend the commune as the most free way of organizing social reproduction.
724820	727500	Yeah, so when you pair bond…
727500	732820	When you pair bond, as humans, generally, but not always, you want to keep that relationship
732820	735340	at least somewhat exclusive, and you care for your own kids.
735340	740780	I have the feeling this would have to be rigorously enforced on people who kinda just want exclusive
740780	745380	monogamous relationships.
745380	748700	Those seeking a return to the family as an isolated economic unit are counter-revolutionaries.
748700	754140	Alright, alright, so if you want your GF and you want to have your kids, you're a counter-revolutionary,
754140	755140	guys.
755140	756140	5.
756140	757420	The children of the commune.
757420	759680	Through the commune, offer a better world for children.
759680	762620	As a neighbor and friend in a world where the nuclear family no longer disposes of the
762620	767340	lives of children, everyone is called upon to creatively and collectively intervene into
767340	769120	abusive parental relationships.
769120	772600	Through the commune, a parent or child not dependent on the family can opt out of a messed
772600	775460	up dynamic when it isn't working knowing everyone will be cared for.
775460	778500	If you've reached this step, you have succeeded in abolishing the family.
778500	782680	You have freed queer love and feminist care to create a basis for human flourishing.
782680	787720	None of this is true or accurate to how people live or want to live.
787720	793040	If I were a parent, I wouldn't want a complete and total lack of privacy, or the ability
793040	798600	of a mob with absolutely no accountability coming in and just taking my kids.
798600	799600	6.
799600	801220	Expand opportunities for chosen survival.
801220	806400	If global communizing insurgency doesn't emerge, do your best with the imperfect options available.
806400	809640	Fight to destroy the white supremacist states which reinforce the violence of the family.
809640	812480	You know what, this sounds like it was written by somebody who was just like beat by their
812480	813760	parents or something.
813760	817860	Or you know, like the previous people, they're a rich kid who despises being rich.
817860	819360	So let's go down the list here.
819360	821160	These people hate their parents.
821160	823100	They hate their kids when they have them.
823100	824260	They hate their families.
824260	826780	They hate all of the things that families do.
826780	828000	They hate rules.
828000	829440	They hate mealtimes.
829440	830440	They hate bedtimes.
830440	833560	I haven't found any evidence of this yet, but they probably hate bath times too.
833560	836200	We're not talking about adult human beings here.
836200	839480	We're talking about old infants, it sounds like.
839480	843320	People who never really progressed out of that phase of their life.
843320	848320	And so now they're 30 or 35 and they're stuck on Twitter constantly crying about how awful
