00:00.000 --> 00:02.260
It's October 1st, and you know what that means?

00:02.260 --> 00:03.260
Halloween.

00:03.260 --> 00:08.240
If you're not on the Short Fight Otaku Community Minecraft server yet, get yourself in there.

00:08.240 --> 00:13.640
Join the SFO Discord, get on the server, because we are doing a community Halloween event.

00:13.640 --> 00:19.020
You have one month to build something cool and Halloween themed on the Halloween map.

00:19.020 --> 00:22.780
And at the end of the month, on the 31st, I'll stream everyone's builds and we'll

00:22.780 --> 00:23.780
have a good time with it.

00:23.780 --> 00:25.060
So get yourself in there.

00:25.060 --> 00:31.820
The month begins.

00:31.820 --> 00:38.180
For anyone who keeps a pulse on leftist discourse online, you probably noticed this slow trend

00:38.180 --> 00:40.640
build up over the past couple months.

00:40.640 --> 00:44.740
Not large enough to become the mainstream discourse, not big enough to be a meme, but

00:44.740 --> 00:47.340
certainly bubbling in the background.

00:47.340 --> 00:51.340
And it is anti-bedtime action.

00:51.340 --> 00:52.340
That's right.

00:52.340 --> 00:58.280
A reminder that bedtimes are not trans-historical, they're a capitalist concept invented in

00:58.280 --> 01:02.060
Victorian England in order to enforce labor discipline.

01:02.060 --> 01:05.740
Before capitalism, people could choose when they wanted to go to bed, and it will be the

01:05.740 --> 01:07.640
same under communism.

01:07.640 --> 01:10.720
We have to liberate children from bedtimes, guys.

01:10.720 --> 01:15.460
There can be no emancipation without the abolition of a circadian rhythm.

01:15.460 --> 01:17.500
Teenagers of the world unite.

01:17.500 --> 01:20.420
You have nothing to lose but your curfews.

01:20.420 --> 01:24.460
Much like with other oppressive systems, which folks are calling for the abolition

01:24.460 --> 01:29.700
of, it's not about simply getting rid of bedtime, but about addressing the other issues

01:29.700 --> 01:34.820
that require bedtimes, that is, the work and school systems that aren't properly built

01:34.820 --> 01:35.820
for humans.

01:35.820 --> 01:39.980
Okay, so you want to be able to sleep in until like 10 or 11, go to work, come home at what,

01:39.980 --> 01:43.340
8 or 9 after, you know, an 8 hour day's work?

01:43.340 --> 01:44.460
Have even less time?

01:44.460 --> 01:48.060
Because I guarantee you, you probably sleep 12 hours, you're still going to bed before

01:48.060 --> 01:49.060
midnight.

01:49.060 --> 01:53.340
The night has caused a schism, believe it or not, on the left.

01:53.340 --> 01:54.780
Here's this person here.

01:54.780 --> 02:00.940
This bear eats fascists, a libertarian socialist, a mutualist, and a dad, I assume dad is why

02:00.940 --> 02:02.620
he has this opinion.

02:02.620 --> 02:09.140
Capitalism is a construct, race is a construct, gender is a construct, but bedtime is real.

02:09.140 --> 02:12.300
Technically it's still a construct.

02:12.300 --> 02:16.820
It's real and absolutely essential for health and the well-being of tiny people who do not

02:16.820 --> 02:18.620
have the capacity to self-regulate.

02:18.620 --> 02:21.420
If you aren't a parent, I don't give a fuck about anything you have to say on the

02:21.420 --> 02:22.420
topic.

02:22.420 --> 02:24.100
Oh, it's very interesting, isn't it?

02:24.100 --> 02:28.460
Obvious constructs are suddenly real when you have use for them.

02:28.460 --> 02:29.460
Hmm.

02:29.460 --> 02:33.340
And this logic here, you can't have an opinion unless you're part of a certain group that

02:33.340 --> 02:35.300
actually cares about the topic, eh?

02:35.300 --> 02:39.500
Well, what if the owners of the means of production said, if you're not a capitalist, I don't

02:39.500 --> 02:42.300
give a fuck about anything you have to say on the topic of capitalism.

02:42.300 --> 02:43.300
Same logic.

02:43.300 --> 02:45.920
Here's from the antisocial social anarchist.

02:45.920 --> 02:49.120
Why is there so much conflict over bedtime abolition?

02:49.120 --> 02:53.020
Like isn't it well-known that forcing people to get up out of their natural circadian rhythms

02:53.020 --> 02:54.020
is unhealthy?

02:54.020 --> 02:56.980
I absolutely refuse to believe that these people are real, like this has to be a troll

02:56.980 --> 02:59.520
account or fucking something.

02:59.520 --> 03:00.520
Hold on.

03:00.520 --> 03:04.440
This account is operated by nine-year-old federal agents, so maybe it is a troll account.

03:04.440 --> 03:06.640
Wait, maybe it's not.

03:06.640 --> 03:07.640
Nope.

03:07.640 --> 03:09.080
Maybe, maybe it's not.

03:09.080 --> 03:11.400
Oh god, here's a fucking essay on it.

03:11.400 --> 03:15.440
Always confused by self-described radicals who see a radical or abolitionist proposal

03:15.480 --> 03:18.600
about something they are unfamiliar with or haven't considered and respond by rejecting

03:18.600 --> 03:19.600
it out of hand.

03:19.600 --> 03:22.040
Seems to be a much more of a conservative reaction than a radical one.

03:22.040 --> 03:26.040
I think an actual radical response to something like that is, even if the idea isn't fully

03:26.040 --> 03:30.360
thought through or contains contradictions, to materially analyze it and to draw out the

03:30.360 --> 03:32.060
essential critique at its strongest.

03:32.060 --> 03:35.840
This can be for anything really, as dominant social conditioning positions, even the most

03:35.840 --> 03:38.840
established and well-researched ideas as absurd.

03:38.840 --> 03:41.860
It's actually important that people who think that they run counter to that to actually

03:41.860 --> 03:44.680
do so and not fall back into the same easy dismissals.

03:44.920 --> 03:49.640
So the next time when you see radical teenagers and even outright children talk about bedtime

03:49.640 --> 03:56.320
abolition, maybe use that as an opportunity to talk about the oppressive nature of capitalist

03:56.320 --> 04:02.520
time, not dismiss kids reacting to their very real unfreedoms with the right impulses.

04:02.520 --> 04:09.040
Okay, um, firstly, capitalist time, guys.

04:09.040 --> 04:10.840
Time is a capitalist construct.

04:11.360 --> 04:16.680
But also, this whole thing basically reads, if you hear a really dumbfuck idea, don't

04:16.680 --> 04:19.320
dismiss it as the dumbfuck idea that it is.

04:19.320 --> 04:24.320
This is the people who deconstruct everything without any skills to actually reconstruct

04:24.320 --> 04:25.320
anything out of it.

04:25.320 --> 04:26.320
It's not just bedtime, though.

04:26.320 --> 04:29.000
I don't understand why some people insist on treating children like they should have

04:29.000 --> 04:30.640
no voice just because they're children.

04:30.640 --> 04:32.160
Eat what I make or you don't eat.

04:32.160 --> 04:34.040
Doesn't that sound crazy to y'all?

04:34.040 --> 04:35.040
No.

04:35.040 --> 04:37.040
The kids aren't buying the food.

04:37.040 --> 04:38.920
The kids aren't making the food.

04:39.520 --> 04:45.080
If your child makes a bit of money on the side and then buys his own food, fine.

04:45.080 --> 04:46.720
That's his food.

04:46.720 --> 04:52.720
But if he's eating on your dime, he eats what you make.

04:52.720 --> 04:53.720
This is insane.

04:53.720 --> 04:56.320
I think it's because these people don't actually respect labor.

04:56.320 --> 05:00.480
If you really wanted to go down the rabbit hole logically, and there's not an ounce of

05:00.480 --> 05:02.520
logic in these people's brains, but fuck it.

05:02.520 --> 05:05.720
They don't actually respect labor because the parents have to labor to provide for the

05:05.720 --> 05:06.720
children.

05:06.720 --> 05:09.640
And because they don't actually respect labor, which is why they talk about stealing property

05:09.640 --> 05:14.520
and collectivizing labor all the time, they don't give a shit that parents have to work

05:14.520 --> 05:15.940
to provide for their kids.

05:15.940 --> 05:17.360
The kids should get what they want.

05:17.360 --> 05:18.360
It's amazing.

05:18.360 --> 05:19.360
Look at this dude.

05:19.360 --> 05:20.360
Look at this fucking guy.

05:20.360 --> 05:21.360
Are you an adult?

05:21.360 --> 05:22.360
It looks like it.

05:22.360 --> 05:23.360
And you're still talking like this?

05:23.360 --> 05:24.360
It's wild to me.

05:24.360 --> 05:29.320
I can't believe this is where leftist discourse has gone, at least in this corner of the internet.

05:29.320 --> 05:33.900
As soon as the anarchists are done dismantling the oppressive framework of having a bedtime,

05:33.900 --> 05:38.000
I assume their next target is going after the fascism of being told not to eat all their

05:38.000 --> 05:39.780
Halloween candy in one sitting?

05:39.780 --> 05:40.900
Watch out, Sargon.

05:40.900 --> 05:45.620
The insurrectionary autonomous commune of Daniel's room is going to lead the world towards

05:45.620 --> 05:50.120
a brighter future which is free of the oppressive hierarchy of the parenting class.

05:50.120 --> 05:52.660
No bedtime, no veggies, no masters.

05:52.660 --> 05:54.260
Oh yeah, there's this dude.

05:54.260 --> 05:55.260
This guy's a tankie.

05:55.260 --> 05:56.940
He's like a straight up Marxist-Leninist.

05:56.940 --> 05:57.940
I was following him for a while.

05:57.940 --> 06:01.380
I asked very good faith, honest questions, and he just eventually just blocked me because

06:01.380 --> 06:04.180
he got tired of having to answer for all of his nonsense.

06:04.180 --> 06:07.140
Under capitalism, the parents are the child's first oppressor.

06:07.140 --> 06:09.100
School is the second and workplace is the third.

06:09.100 --> 06:13.620
Funny as fuck coming from a Soviet fan, somebody who stands one of the most oppressive governments

06:13.620 --> 06:14.700
in history.

06:14.700 --> 06:17.840
But still, this guy sounds like he's stuck in that phase that teenagers get in when they

06:17.840 --> 06:19.700
rebel against their parents.

06:19.700 --> 06:20.700
Look at this.

06:20.700 --> 06:21.700
This is so fucking weird.

06:21.700 --> 06:24.500
This guy's like a sociopath or something.

06:24.500 --> 06:26.340
Will your parents get the wall?

06:26.340 --> 06:29.060
Yes, no, or gulag instead?

06:29.060 --> 06:30.260
Read this, read this.

06:30.260 --> 06:32.940
My dad will get the wall because of his Reagan rhetoric.

06:32.940 --> 06:37.340
Due to the lines of patriarchy, mothers are less extreme conspirators to the authoritarian

06:37.340 --> 06:38.340
fascists.

06:38.340 --> 06:40.340
They're dead, but no re-education camp.

06:40.340 --> 06:43.620
My mother is a landlord, but I think if the revolution comes, I could get her to renounce

06:43.620 --> 06:44.620
her evil ways.

06:44.620 --> 06:45.960
Hopefully, comrade.

06:45.960 --> 06:49.300
These people are, I don't want to say insane, they're not insane.

06:49.300 --> 06:52.140
They are of sound mind, but they're homicidal.

06:52.140 --> 06:57.340
They're so deep into their own nonsense that they've basically given themselves the perfect

06:57.340 --> 07:02.300
reason to hate other people and to oppress other people and feel good about it.

07:02.300 --> 07:03.820
My dad was an investment banker.

07:03.820 --> 07:05.280
My mom was a VP at Exxon.

07:05.280 --> 07:07.780
I write about social justice regarding women.

07:07.780 --> 07:10.540
No one has any idea how that happened.

07:10.540 --> 07:16.060
Listen, everybody knows how that works, with the exception of you and your family.

07:16.060 --> 07:17.060
We all know what happened.

07:17.060 --> 07:21.200
You're a spoiled, rich kid who wanted to rebel against your parents, ended up doing

07:21.200 --> 07:25.920
something completely different, got radicalized, and now you likely don't have a real relationship

07:25.920 --> 07:26.920
with them.

07:27.000 --> 07:31.560
Bored, trust-fund kids always end up turning into champagne socialists and talking all

07:31.560 --> 07:32.560
about it on Twitter.

07:32.560 --> 07:33.560
25.

07:33.560 --> 07:35.480
A BA in journalism.

07:35.480 --> 07:37.560
Communist, politics, and Star Trek.

07:37.560 --> 07:40.580
Disabled, neurodivergent, bisexual, she-they.

07:40.580 --> 07:43.280
I grew up extremely wealthy.

07:43.280 --> 07:44.280
Of course you did.

07:44.280 --> 07:47.400
That's the only way you can afford to have a bio like that.

07:47.400 --> 07:52.620
A few days ago, I took a medium dose of acid and wrote for several hours straight and admitted

07:52.620 --> 07:54.640
some things to myself, mostly about money.

07:54.640 --> 07:56.080
Let's start here.

07:56.080 --> 08:01.720
Last August, my mom gave me $100,000 for my birthday.

08:01.720 --> 08:06.800
I resented her for this, and also suppressed the resentment.

08:06.800 --> 08:09.080
Oh my fucking god.

08:09.080 --> 08:13.080
Yes, you are a magnificent adult baby, dude, jesus.

08:13.080 --> 08:17.760
When you are the bourgeoisie and your socialist radicalization makes you hate yourself for

08:17.760 --> 08:18.760
it.

08:18.760 --> 08:22.360
I wrote for maybe 12 hours straight and eventually turned into a sort of spontaneous dialogue

08:22.360 --> 08:25.440
between the person I am on acid and the person I am sober.

08:25.440 --> 08:28.460
He told me a bunch of things I needed to hear but didn't want to.

08:28.460 --> 08:33.040
He told me, you've been feeling social pressure to pretend like you have a financial health

08:33.040 --> 08:37.160
that is entirely about your savings and your income, and it's just not true at all.

08:37.160 --> 08:40.120
The truth is that if you ran out of money, your parents would send you more because they

08:40.120 --> 08:41.120
love you.

08:41.120 --> 08:44.160
The truth is, your finances aren't separate from your parents' finances, and they never

08:44.160 --> 08:45.160
have been.

08:45.160 --> 08:48.880
You resent your mom for sending you $100,000 because she forcefully reminded you of this

08:48.880 --> 08:49.880
fact.

08:49.880 --> 08:55.360
Man, if I could get $100,000 for my birthday, I would blow this business of mine up no

08:55.360 --> 08:56.360
problem.

08:56.360 --> 09:00.520
It's almost like he never learned what money was, how much it was actually worth, how to

09:00.520 --> 09:02.000
properly use it.

09:02.000 --> 09:05.560
The truth is that for you, money is a game you play with your parents.

09:05.560 --> 09:09.600
The most important thing you do to get money is to not piss off your parents so much that

09:09.600 --> 09:10.800
they cut you off.

09:10.800 --> 09:13.760
And then I was like, oh my god, am I a spoiled rich kid?

09:13.760 --> 09:15.480
Am I a trust-fun baby kind of?

09:15.480 --> 09:17.600
That's even worse, jesus.

09:17.600 --> 09:18.600
Yes.

09:18.600 --> 09:24.400
So we have a group of emotionally stunted rich kid socialists who believe that part

09:24.440 --> 09:30.820
of their ideology, their grand scheme of equalization, means abolishing things that children need.

09:30.820 --> 09:34.360
Like bedtimes, or healthy food, or structure in their lives.

09:34.360 --> 09:37.560
Of course you can also just straight up abolish the family too, that's something socialists

09:37.560 --> 09:39.760
have been talking about for a very long time.

09:39.760 --> 09:43.640
Abolish the nuclear family has been a part of the left since the radical feminists of

09:43.640 --> 09:44.640
the 1970s.

09:44.640 --> 09:49.440
And if you want to see how extreme this mentality goes, all you have to do is read the Commune

09:49.440 --> 09:52.560
magazine's 6 Steps to Abolish the Family.

09:52.560 --> 09:53.560
1.

09:53.560 --> 09:54.560
Set up a protest kitchen.

09:54.560 --> 09:57.160
The best starting point to abolish the family is a massive insurrection.

09:57.160 --> 10:00.960
Come together with others at protest camps, street barricades, square occupations, seized

10:00.960 --> 10:06.400
factories, building takeovers, and other liberated zones.

10:06.400 --> 10:10.320
There generate the means of collective survival, expanding the insurrection.

10:10.320 --> 10:13.280
Begin with a collective protest kitchen, feeding any and all.

10:13.280 --> 10:17.040
Yeah, we saw how well the Chaz grew food, eh?

10:17.040 --> 10:18.040
2.

10:18.040 --> 10:20.760
Expand insurgent social reproduction.

10:20.760 --> 10:22.840
You're literally seizing the means of reproduction.

10:22.840 --> 10:25.120
I know it's an old joke, but it's fucking right here.

10:25.120 --> 10:29.380
As the insurgency grows, continue the process of family abolition by deepening shared practices

10:29.380 --> 10:30.600
of mutual care.

10:30.600 --> 10:34.360
Make the protest camp, rebel territory, the collective farm, or the housing block committee

10:34.360 --> 10:37.040
capable of welcoming and supporting many new people.

10:37.040 --> 10:40.120
Form self-organized shared sleeping areas for safety.

10:40.120 --> 10:42.520
That sounds like it'd be the most unsafe fucking thing.

10:42.520 --> 10:46.960
Shit, set up cooperative childcare to support the full involvement of parents.

10:46.960 --> 11:04.760
3.

11:04.760 --> 11:05.760
Build communes.

11:05.760 --> 11:09.440
As new communist production begins in factories and farms, family abolition can take root

11:09.440 --> 11:11.860
in permanent communes of collective social reproduction.

11:11.860 --> 11:15.500
The protest kitchen becomes a permanent canteen where everyone in the area cooks and eats

11:15.500 --> 11:16.500
their meals.

11:16.540 --> 11:19.220
The protest tent becomes a center for all regular medical care.

11:19.220 --> 11:24.420
Childcare areas become criches where children can learn and grow together over years.

11:24.420 --> 11:28.020
Private groups of bedrooms are still available for people that want to form intimate family-like

11:28.020 --> 11:32.540
units or live with their kids, but most of life takes place in shared collective space.

11:32.540 --> 11:37.660
The old, atomized, single-family homes dependent on constant car use and individual consumption

11:37.660 --> 11:38.660
are ended.

11:38.660 --> 11:41.420
On this basis, humanity can collectively address climate change.

11:41.420 --> 11:46.680
It literally sounds like anarcho-primitivism, reversing all the progress that we've made

11:46.680 --> 11:49.880
and going back to living in, like, tents in the bush.

11:49.880 --> 11:50.880
No thank you.

11:50.880 --> 11:54.380
Additionally, it also sounds like an environment where you have no privacy, because remember,

11:54.380 --> 11:58.580
these people don't respect privacy because the personal is political.

11:58.580 --> 11:59.580
4.

11:59.580 --> 12:01.420
Combat the return of the family.

12:01.420 --> 12:04.820
Defend the commune as the most free way of organizing social reproduction.

12:04.820 --> 12:07.500
Yeah, so when you pair bond…

12:07.500 --> 12:12.820
When you pair bond, as humans, generally, but not always, you want to keep that relationship

12:12.820 --> 12:15.340
at least somewhat exclusive, and you care for your own kids.

12:15.340 --> 12:20.780
I have the feeling this would have to be rigorously enforced on people who kinda just want exclusive

12:20.780 --> 12:25.380
monogamous relationships.

12:25.380 --> 12:28.700
Those seeking a return to the family as an isolated economic unit are counter-revolutionaries.

12:28.700 --> 12:34.140
Alright, alright, so if you want your GF and you want to have your kids, you're a counter-revolutionary,

12:34.140 --> 12:35.140
guys.

12:35.140 --> 12:36.140
5.

12:36.140 --> 12:37.420
The children of the commune.

12:37.420 --> 12:39.680
Through the commune, offer a better world for children.

12:39.680 --> 12:42.620
As a neighbor and friend in a world where the nuclear family no longer disposes of the

12:42.620 --> 12:47.340
lives of children, everyone is called upon to creatively and collectively intervene into

12:47.340 --> 12:49.120
abusive parental relationships.

12:49.120 --> 12:52.600
Through the commune, a parent or child not dependent on the family can opt out of a messed

12:52.600 --> 12:55.460
up dynamic when it isn't working knowing everyone will be cared for.

12:55.460 --> 12:58.500
If you've reached this step, you have succeeded in abolishing the family.

12:58.500 --> 13:02.680
You have freed queer love and feminist care to create a basis for human flourishing.

13:02.680 --> 13:07.720
None of this is true or accurate to how people live or want to live.

13:07.720 --> 13:13.040
If I were a parent, I wouldn't want a complete and total lack of privacy, or the ability

13:13.040 --> 13:18.600
of a mob with absolutely no accountability coming in and just taking my kids.

13:18.600 --> 13:19.600
6.

13:19.600 --> 13:21.220
Expand opportunities for chosen survival.

13:21.220 --> 13:26.400
If global communizing insurgency doesn't emerge, do your best with the imperfect options available.

13:26.400 --> 13:29.640
Fight to destroy the white supremacist states which reinforce the violence of the family.

13:29.640 --> 13:32.480
You know what, this sounds like it was written by somebody who was just like beat by their

13:32.480 --> 13:33.760
parents or something.

13:33.760 --> 13:37.860
Or you know, like the previous people, they're a rich kid who despises being rich.

13:37.860 --> 13:39.360
So let's go down the list here.

13:39.360 --> 13:41.160
These people hate their parents.

13:41.160 --> 13:43.100
They hate their kids when they have them.

13:43.100 --> 13:44.260
They hate their families.

13:44.260 --> 13:46.780
They hate all of the things that families do.

13:46.780 --> 13:48.000
They hate rules.

13:48.000 --> 13:49.440
They hate mealtimes.

13:49.440 --> 13:50.440
They hate bedtimes.

13:50.440 --> 13:53.560
I haven't found any evidence of this yet, but they probably hate bath times too.

13:53.560 --> 13:56.200
We're not talking about adult human beings here.

13:56.200 --> 13:59.480
We're talking about old infants, it sounds like.

13:59.480 --> 14:03.320
People who never really progressed out of that phase of their life.

14:03.320 --> 14:08.320
And so now they're 30 or 35 and they're stuck on Twitter constantly crying about how awful

14:08.320 --> 14:11.440
it was that when they were 10 their parents put them to bed and maybe they could have

14:11.440 --> 14:15.160
stayed up another half an hour and so they're lying in bed in the darkness just not falling

14:15.160 --> 14:16.740
asleep and being grumpy about it.

14:16.740 --> 14:19.520
These people are hilariously ridiculous.

14:19.520 --> 14:23.200
And thank god their ideas are never coming to pass because they would fuck up children

14:23.200 --> 14:27.060
way harder than anything the modern world has done so far.

14:27.060 --> 14:29.280
Like you think TikTok zoomers are obnoxious?

14:29.280 --> 14:35.240
Imagine an entire generation of kids who believe that rebelling against bedtime is praxis.

14:35.240 --> 14:37.480
Alright guys, that about does it for me.

14:37.480 --> 14:42.060
Because it's October 1st, Halloween streams begin tonight on Game Boomers Live, twitch.tv

14:42.060 --> 14:43.560
slash game boomers.

14:43.560 --> 14:47.400
My girlfriend and I are going to play American McGee's Alice.

14:47.400 --> 14:50.040
So make sure to drop in tonight or else you're banned.

14:50.040 --> 14:51.040
I'll see you there.

14:51.040 --> 14:51.880
I love you.
