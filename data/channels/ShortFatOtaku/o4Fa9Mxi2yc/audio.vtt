00:00.000 --> 00:05.280
I did a stream with a good friend of mine and famous Pokemon YouTuber, MadriBread yesterday.

00:05.280 --> 00:08.000
If you haven't seen it yet, I recommend you go check it out.

00:08.000 --> 00:11.600
There's not much in the way of visuals to it, so just throw it on in the background

00:11.600 --> 00:13.440
and listen to it like a podcast.

00:13.440 --> 00:17.600
He likes to come on my channel and talk politics because, being a Pokemon YouTuber and Let's

00:17.600 --> 00:20.160
Player, he keeps his stuff relatively apolitical.

00:20.160 --> 00:23.320
That being said, I made a comment on that stream that I don't think came out right

00:23.320 --> 00:27.200
because, well, it's a stream, and I'm not that great without a script.

00:27.200 --> 00:30.160
I can only imagine what I'm going to sound like at Joe Biden's age, god.

00:30.160 --> 00:35.160
We were talking about professional wrestling, the WWE stuff, sports entertainment, the stuff

00:35.160 --> 00:36.600
that is half fake.

00:36.600 --> 00:41.000
I say half because while the outcomes of the matches, as well as other events, are scripted

00:41.000 --> 00:45.080
ahead of time, and the wrestlers all play characters, there's also a lot of serious

00:45.080 --> 00:48.600
physical work that goes into the actual performance of professional wrestling.

00:48.600 --> 00:51.120
Those are real hits, they suffer real injuries.

00:51.120 --> 00:55.460
DryBread described it, I think, as anime for Westerners, and I can see it because it follows

00:55.460 --> 00:58.240
a similar structure to a lot of the long running shounen series.

00:58.240 --> 01:02.680
I said something along the lines of, wrestling is Shakespeare for people who are not predisposed

01:02.680 --> 01:04.220
to like Shakespeare.

01:04.220 --> 01:08.140
That makes it sound like I'm saying wrestling is for people who are too dumb to like Shakespeare,

01:08.140 --> 01:11.820
and that's absolutely not what I meant, sorry about that wrestling fans.

01:11.820 --> 01:15.140
I know very intelligent people do in fact enjoy wrestling.

01:15.140 --> 01:19.500
What I meant is more like this, there's drama of different levels of sophistication

01:19.500 --> 01:21.120
for different people.

01:21.120 --> 01:24.800
Wrestling drama may not be the most sophisticated, but that doesn't make it any less truthful

01:24.800 --> 01:25.800
or valuable.

01:25.800 --> 01:30.240
It's often said that religious instruction contains its truth for all levels of society

01:30.240 --> 01:34.760
regardless of intelligence or occupation or class, and that it's equally important

01:34.760 --> 01:39.320
that every person, regardless of their own natural proclivities, receive some source

01:39.320 --> 01:40.320
of wisdom.

01:40.320 --> 01:44.360
It's kind of like this, most people don't read, most people don't watch movies, most

01:44.360 --> 01:48.840
people don't play video games, most people don't watch anime or soap operas or reality

01:48.840 --> 01:54.440
TV or professional wrestling, but most people do at least one of those things.

01:55.000 --> 01:57.640
This still sounds like I'm insulting wrestling fans, doesn't it?

01:57.640 --> 01:59.000
I don't mean to.

01:59.000 --> 02:02.760
Maybe there's some correlation between wrestling fans and intelligence, but I think it's

02:02.760 --> 02:07.760
more like there's probably a strong correlation between wrestling fans and learning style.

02:07.760 --> 02:12.660
Consider this, the less sophisticated the genre of drama, the more it is like real life.

02:12.660 --> 02:17.480
The more sophisticated the genre of drama, the more it has abstracted out across multiple

02:17.480 --> 02:22.280
different experiences of real life the fundamental lessons it's trying to impart onto the consumer.

02:22.320 --> 02:27.000
For example, wrestling is more like real life, it's relatable, we've all been in a competition

02:27.000 --> 02:30.760
in school where we've wanted to win, sports or otherwise, or we've had to deal with

02:30.760 --> 02:32.760
a bully or something like that.

02:32.760 --> 02:38.320
Meanwhile a highly fantastical movie, like say Harry Potter, is not at all realistic,

02:38.320 --> 02:42.540
but it can amalgamate multiple instances of the same truths into a more archetypal story.

02:42.540 --> 02:46.200
The former is more relatable, but the latter applies across a wider scope.

02:46.200 --> 02:51.320
And imparting the fundamental truths is the whole point why cultures develop heroic narratives.

02:51.360 --> 02:54.680
Maybe you have a problem, you gotta pay your rent, or you have to get some food to eat,

02:54.680 --> 02:59.120
or you have to find a girlfriend or something, but that's not the real problem you have.

02:59.120 --> 03:04.400
The real problem is that problems exist, and your current problem is only one piece of

03:04.400 --> 03:05.760
the meta problem.

03:05.760 --> 03:09.960
If you can solve your current problem by embodying the qualities of a hero, as laid out for you

03:09.960 --> 03:12.320
by the media you consume, then great!

03:12.320 --> 03:15.960
But it's better to try and solve the meta problem, which means that you need to not

03:15.960 --> 03:20.300
simply understand how to be strong, or how to be smart, or how to be kind, but how to

03:20.300 --> 03:22.440
be all of the qualities of a hero.

03:22.440 --> 03:26.600
People think the proverb, give a man a fish and he eats for a day, teach a man to fish

03:26.600 --> 03:30.920
and he feeds himself for a lifetime, refers to the value of education, and it does.

03:30.920 --> 03:35.860
But even more so, it refers to humanity's constant quest to generalize wisdom such that

03:35.860 --> 03:40.500
as many people as possible can inherit it, while simultaneously making that wisdom apply

03:40.500 --> 03:43.080
to as many individual problems as possible.

03:43.080 --> 03:47.580
In other words, maximizing the number of pieces of the meta problem that it can tackle.

03:47.580 --> 03:51.880
And the goal is something like, it's not about how you solve your problem, it's about

03:51.880 --> 03:56.500
how do you behave that you can start actually tackling the meta problem of life itself.

03:56.500 --> 03:58.540
Wrestling imparts this knowledge in a great way.

03:58.540 --> 04:00.560
Like I said before, it's quite relatable.

04:00.560 --> 04:03.600
Wrestling stories are classic good versus evil, but they're not verbalized, they're

04:03.600 --> 04:06.480
not conceptualized, they're acted out instead.

04:06.480 --> 04:10.220
And wrestling teaches an important lesson about solving the meta problem of life.

04:10.220 --> 04:15.660
It's not enough to only be strong, or only be wise, or only be generous, or only be just,

04:15.660 --> 04:17.060
or only be kind.

04:17.060 --> 04:19.980
You have to be all of those things to be a good person.

04:19.980 --> 04:24.420
A hero has to be physically strong, but if the only virtue that a character in any narrative

04:24.420 --> 04:29.100
has is strength, then that character will either suffer and grow, or that character

04:29.100 --> 04:30.780
will stop being a hero.

04:30.780 --> 04:36.260
Unless you're John Cena, but that's why everybody except the youngest of kids find him boring.

04:36.260 --> 04:37.260
No offense.

04:37.260 --> 04:39.180
And we see this all the time in wrestling.

04:39.180 --> 04:41.860
The weak hero loses in a straight fight against the villain.

04:41.860 --> 04:46.580
A strong hero who isn't wise will get ambushed backstage by three dudes who kick the shit

04:46.580 --> 04:47.580
out of him.

04:47.580 --> 04:51.540
A strong, wise hero who isn't kind will discover that during a critical moment of

04:51.540 --> 04:56.540
the match, his best friend has turned on him, charged the ring, and bashed his head in with

04:56.540 --> 04:57.620
a folding chair.

04:57.620 --> 05:00.460
And the lesson that the audience is meant to take away is clear.

05:00.460 --> 05:03.340
You have to have all of these qualities to be heroic.

05:03.340 --> 05:07.220
And if the wrestling narrative is any good, the hero may be knocked off of his game for

05:07.220 --> 05:11.980
a while, but he'll learn, grow, heal up, and return to reclaim his belt in a climactic

05:11.980 --> 05:15.180
final battle, generally during the pay-per-view.

05:15.180 --> 05:16.700
The lesson's clear.

05:16.700 --> 05:20.940
Strength is your best virtue for a single battle, but relying only on strength for a

05:20.940 --> 05:23.920
long-term war is a sure way to lose that war.

05:23.920 --> 05:28.020
Of course, people like to cry that wrestling's fake, and the physicality of the sport aside,

05:28.020 --> 05:32.580
which is quite real, it doesn't actually matter if wrestling is fake, because it's a heroic

05:32.580 --> 05:33.580
narrative.

05:33.580 --> 05:36.260
Do you believe that movies are fake while you're watching them?

05:36.300 --> 05:39.580
If they're good, you're too sucked into the story to even consider it.

05:39.580 --> 05:42.620
And yeah, we psychologically react as if these things were real.

05:42.620 --> 05:46.740
When you lose a fight in real life with another person, your testosterone goes down and the

05:46.740 --> 05:47.740
winners goes up.

05:47.740 --> 05:52.460
But if your favorite sports team loses a championship and you were really into the game, your testosterone

05:52.460 --> 05:54.300
also goes down in a similar way.

05:54.300 --> 05:57.740
And it's because sports is another similar heroic narrative.

05:57.740 --> 06:00.980
When you see the captain of a sports team holding up the championship cup, that's

06:00.980 --> 06:06.100
not only the hero of the team, his team is a team of heroes of an entire league of teams.

06:06.100 --> 06:09.460
It is simultaneously both the problem and the meta-problem.

06:09.460 --> 06:10.460
It's all a hierarchy.

06:10.460 --> 06:15.620
And as a cheeky aside, this is why any anarchist, communist or socialist, that talks about eliminating

06:15.620 --> 06:20.260
hierarchy and implementing pure undifferentiated equality across all 7 point whatever billion

06:20.260 --> 06:22.680
humans will never actually manage to do it.

06:22.680 --> 06:24.620
They're fighting our biology.

06:24.620 --> 06:28.120
Consider that when we observe pack animals behaving in a specific way that creates a

06:28.120 --> 06:32.980
semblance of order within the pack, we view them through a human lens as following rules.

06:32.980 --> 06:34.500
But they're not actually following rules.

06:34.540 --> 06:38.500
There's actually not enough cognition there for them to be sophisticated enough to understand

06:38.500 --> 06:39.820
what a rule is.

06:39.820 --> 06:44.100
What they're doing is replicating a series of behaviors, partially from their genetics,

06:44.100 --> 06:48.220
and partially socialized into them from other pack members, that create a stable society

06:48.220 --> 06:49.220
of animals.

06:49.220 --> 06:50.320
And that's not the same thing.

06:50.320 --> 06:54.340
A rule is a human verbalization of a stable pack behavior.

06:54.340 --> 06:56.180
It is not the pack behavior itself.

06:56.180 --> 07:00.420
We see these behaviors in wolves, in lions, in chimps and gorillas.

07:00.420 --> 07:04.500
The alpha of the pack may rule, but the alpha who doesn't let others eat, or who doesn't

07:04.500 --> 07:08.800
engage in reciprocal grooming, or engage in play, or doesn't pay enough attention to

07:08.800 --> 07:13.220
his mates and his offspring, will see himself torn to pieces by the rest of the pack regardless

07:13.220 --> 07:14.500
of how strong he is.

07:14.500 --> 07:19.500
In other words, even animals have figured out on some small level that strength is not

07:19.500 --> 07:21.340
enough of a virtue on its own.

07:21.340 --> 07:27.000
So yes, hierarchy is in our biology, but also so is a concept of fairness and compassion,

07:27.000 --> 07:31.060
and even justice, which is where the fascists and the most cutthroat of corporatists have

07:31.060 --> 07:33.040
it just as wrong as the radical left.

07:33.040 --> 07:37.660
In much the same way, successful political regimes do not rely on only strength, because

07:37.660 --> 07:39.920
if they do they become destabilized.

07:39.920 --> 07:44.220
This is why authoritarian regimes, regardless of their political affiliation, have to constantly

07:44.220 --> 07:47.420
conduct purges of even loyalists within the party.

07:47.420 --> 07:51.560
In much the same way, this is also why idealist revolutionaries who are totally not like the

07:51.560 --> 07:55.380
previous ones we promise, are always hidden authoritarians.

07:55.380 --> 07:59.000
And even if they are truly as good as they claim to be, they'll find themselves with

07:59.000 --> 08:02.880
a knife sticking out of their throat in the middle of the night, not long after they overthrow

08:02.880 --> 08:05.580
the liberal power structure that was protecting their life.

08:05.580 --> 08:09.300
This is because the archetypal hero, when brought to the sophistication level of the

08:09.300 --> 08:15.200
political realm, is the one who leads a stable, free, fair, and prosperous state.

08:15.200 --> 08:20.300
And just like every other level of sophistication, from pack alpha, to sports hero, to action

08:20.300 --> 08:22.820
star, strength is not enough.

08:22.820 --> 08:26.740
All heroic narratives, if they're actually worth consuming, will try to impart some kind

08:26.740 --> 08:28.140
of universal truth.

08:28.140 --> 08:32.160
Without spoiling too much here, the lesson of Harry Potter was, do not fear death so

08:32.160 --> 08:34.340
much that you become a tyrant in the name of safety.

08:34.340 --> 08:38.780
The lesson of Attack on Titan is, do not judge people by the sins of their ancestors.

08:38.780 --> 08:42.000
And now you know why the white fragility lefty types hate that show.

08:42.000 --> 08:46.300
Frozen's was, do not obsess over those things about you that you can't change.

08:46.300 --> 08:50.660
The Lion King's was, do not let past traumas prevent you from growing and confronting the

08:50.660 --> 08:51.660
tyrant.

08:51.660 --> 08:56.420
This one, in fact, is one of the most common hero stories, from Hamlet, to Rocky, to professional

08:56.420 --> 08:57.420
wrestling.

08:57.420 --> 09:00.900
There's a reason why most ancient gods were gods of sight and speech.

09:00.900 --> 09:05.300
There's a reason the Christian God, or his angels, are often depicted by an all-seeing

09:05.300 --> 09:08.060
eye, and why God creates through speaking.

09:08.060 --> 09:12.840
Our ancient ancestors understood that the foremost qualities of heroic ideal were vision

09:12.840 --> 09:13.840
and truth.

09:13.840 --> 09:18.500
That's why those heroes who lack those qualities, even if they're strong, or smart, or kind,

09:18.500 --> 09:20.180
end up suffering throughout their narratives.

09:20.220 --> 09:24.660
And in fact, the narratives that resonate the most with us are the ones where the heroes

09:24.660 --> 09:28.820
suffer and have their eyes opened and learn the truth as a result of it.

09:28.820 --> 09:33.940
These lessons need to be dramatized and acted out, not simply understood intellectually,

09:33.940 --> 09:35.980
because humans aren't actually intellectual creatures.

09:35.980 --> 09:38.400
We like to think we are, but we're really not.

09:38.400 --> 09:42.500
We often behave in ways that we don't fully understand, but we do it because we know it

09:42.500 --> 09:43.500
works.

09:43.500 --> 09:47.480
That's why I talked about animals earlier, because even our closest ancestors behave

09:47.480 --> 09:50.860
in ways that they don't understand, they only know that it works.

09:50.860 --> 09:55.020
We were behaving creatures long before we were thinking creatures, and we described

09:55.020 --> 09:58.660
those behaviors in drama long before we understood what they truly meant.

09:58.660 --> 10:00.040
And we still do that now.

10:00.040 --> 10:05.060
There's been an ongoing evolutionary feedback loop happening since before humans were even

10:05.060 --> 10:06.440
a distinct species.

10:06.440 --> 10:10.720
Our biology informs us of the basic heroic knowledge in a primitive way.

10:10.720 --> 10:14.640
That knowledge is diffused throughout all of us and our behaviors, creating the cultural

10:14.640 --> 10:19.840
hero myth, and then each of us on an individual level bring that back into ourselves and try

10:19.840 --> 10:22.360
to achieve the ideal through our own habits.

10:22.360 --> 10:25.520
At least you do that if you're trying to make a good faith effort to build and improve.

10:25.520 --> 10:29.400
And once you can articulate that ideal, then you have a hierarchy between the current you

10:29.400 --> 10:31.080
and the person you wish to be.

10:31.080 --> 10:34.880
And whenever you look up to another person, you're saying, in your subjective view of

10:34.880 --> 10:38.080
the current hierarchy that you inhabit, that the person you're looking up to is at the

10:38.080 --> 10:39.980
top of that hierarchy.

10:39.980 --> 10:43.900
This is who you will have to become in order to get to where you want to go.

10:43.900 --> 10:49.060
In my opinion, this is why the liberal individualist mindset, as opposed to the collectivist mindset

10:49.060 --> 10:54.740
of the socialist or fascist, has created the most prosperous society that has ever existed.

10:54.740 --> 10:58.500
Because while we recognize that the collective is important, it's what sustains us, it's

10:58.500 --> 11:03.620
what socializes us, it's the driving force of the individual that reincorporates new

11:03.620 --> 11:08.660
knowledge back into the collective by embodying the next iteration of the hero.

11:08.660 --> 11:12.140
It's not enough for us to be told what good and evil are.

11:12.140 --> 11:16.620
We have to be shown examples of good and evil, we have to be shown their consequences, and

11:16.620 --> 11:20.680
we have to be shown it in a way that is engaging to us on a personal level.

11:20.680 --> 11:25.260
And that is, just like any other art form, the moral value of professional wrestling.
