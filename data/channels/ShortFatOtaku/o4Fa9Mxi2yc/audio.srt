00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,280
I did a stream with a good friend of mine and famous Pokemon YouTuber, MadriBread yesterday.

2
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:08,000
If you haven't seen it yet, I recommend you go check it out.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,600
There's not much in the way of visuals to it, so just throw it on in the background

4
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:13,440
and listen to it like a podcast.

5
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:17,600
He likes to come on my channel and talk politics because, being a Pokemon YouTuber and Let's

6
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:20,160
Player, he keeps his stuff relatively apolitical.

7
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:23,320
That being said, I made a comment on that stream that I don't think came out right

8
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:27,200
because, well, it's a stream, and I'm not that great without a script.

9
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:30,160
I can only imagine what I'm going to sound like at Joe Biden's age, god.

10
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:35,160
We were talking about professional wrestling, the WWE stuff, sports entertainment, the stuff

11
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:36,600
that is half fake.

12
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:41,000
I say half because while the outcomes of the matches, as well as other events, are scripted

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,080
ahead of time, and the wrestlers all play characters, there's also a lot of serious

14
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:48,600
physical work that goes into the actual performance of professional wrestling.

15
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:51,120
Those are real hits, they suffer real injuries.

16
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:55,460
DryBread described it, I think, as anime for Westerners, and I can see it because it follows

17
00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:58,240
a similar structure to a lot of the long running shounen series.

18
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:02,680
I said something along the lines of, wrestling is Shakespeare for people who are not predisposed

19
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:04,220
to like Shakespeare.

20
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:08,140
That makes it sound like I'm saying wrestling is for people who are too dumb to like Shakespeare,

21
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:11,820
and that's absolutely not what I meant, sorry about that wrestling fans.

22
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:15,140
I know very intelligent people do in fact enjoy wrestling.

23
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:19,500
What I meant is more like this, there's drama of different levels of sophistication

24
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:21,120
for different people.

25
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:24,800
Wrestling drama may not be the most sophisticated, but that doesn't make it any less truthful

26
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:25,800
or valuable.

27
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:30,240
It's often said that religious instruction contains its truth for all levels of society

28
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:34,760
regardless of intelligence or occupation or class, and that it's equally important

29
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:39,320
that every person, regardless of their own natural proclivities, receive some source

30
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:40,320
of wisdom.

31
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:44,360
It's kind of like this, most people don't read, most people don't watch movies, most

32
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:48,840
people don't play video games, most people don't watch anime or soap operas or reality

33
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:54,440
TV or professional wrestling, but most people do at least one of those things.

34
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,640
This still sounds like I'm insulting wrestling fans, doesn't it?

35
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:59,000
I don't mean to.

36
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,760
Maybe there's some correlation between wrestling fans and intelligence, but I think it's

37
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:07,760
more like there's probably a strong correlation between wrestling fans and learning style.

38
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:12,660
Consider this, the less sophisticated the genre of drama, the more it is like real life.

39
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:17,480
The more sophisticated the genre of drama, the more it has abstracted out across multiple

40
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:22,280
different experiences of real life the fundamental lessons it's trying to impart onto the consumer.

41
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:27,000
For example, wrestling is more like real life, it's relatable, we've all been in a competition

42
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,760
in school where we've wanted to win, sports or otherwise, or we've had to deal with

43
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:32,760
a bully or something like that.

44
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:38,320
Meanwhile a highly fantastical movie, like say Harry Potter, is not at all realistic,

45
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:42,540
but it can amalgamate multiple instances of the same truths into a more archetypal story.

46
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:46,200
The former is more relatable, but the latter applies across a wider scope.

47
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:51,320
And imparting the fundamental truths is the whole point why cultures develop heroic narratives.

48
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,680
Maybe you have a problem, you gotta pay your rent, or you have to get some food to eat,

49
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:59,120
or you have to find a girlfriend or something, but that's not the real problem you have.

50
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:04,400
The real problem is that problems exist, and your current problem is only one piece of

51
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,760
the meta problem.

52
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:09,960
If you can solve your current problem by embodying the qualities of a hero, as laid out for you

53
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:12,320
by the media you consume, then great!

54
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:15,960
But it's better to try and solve the meta problem, which means that you need to not

55
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:20,300
simply understand how to be strong, or how to be smart, or how to be kind, but how to

56
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:22,440
be all of the qualities of a hero.

57
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:26,600
People think the proverb, give a man a fish and he eats for a day, teach a man to fish

58
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:30,920
and he feeds himself for a lifetime, refers to the value of education, and it does.

59
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:35,860
But even more so, it refers to humanity's constant quest to generalize wisdom such that

60
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:40,500
as many people as possible can inherit it, while simultaneously making that wisdom apply

61
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:43,080
to as many individual problems as possible.

62
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:47,580
In other words, maximizing the number of pieces of the meta problem that it can tackle.

63
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:51,880
And the goal is something like, it's not about how you solve your problem, it's about

64
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:56,500
how do you behave that you can start actually tackling the meta problem of life itself.

65
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:58,540
Wrestling imparts this knowledge in a great way.

66
00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:00,560
Like I said before, it's quite relatable.

67
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:03,600
Wrestling stories are classic good versus evil, but they're not verbalized, they're

68
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:06,480
not conceptualized, they're acted out instead.

69
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:10,220
And wrestling teaches an important lesson about solving the meta problem of life.

70
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:15,660
It's not enough to only be strong, or only be wise, or only be generous, or only be just,

71
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:17,060
or only be kind.

72
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:19,980
You have to be all of those things to be a good person.

73
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:24,420
A hero has to be physically strong, but if the only virtue that a character in any narrative

74
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:29,100
has is strength, then that character will either suffer and grow, or that character

75
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:30,780
will stop being a hero.

76
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:36,260
Unless you're John Cena, but that's why everybody except the youngest of kids find him boring.

77
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:37,260
No offense.

78
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:39,180
And we see this all the time in wrestling.

79
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:41,860
The weak hero loses in a straight fight against the villain.

80
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:46,580
A strong hero who isn't wise will get ambushed backstage by three dudes who kick the shit

81
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:47,580
out of him.

82
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:51,540
A strong, wise hero who isn't kind will discover that during a critical moment of

83
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:56,540
the match, his best friend has turned on him, charged the ring, and bashed his head in with

84
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:57,620
a folding chair.

85
00:04:57,620 --> 00:05:00,460
And the lesson that the audience is meant to take away is clear.

86
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:03,340
You have to have all of these qualities to be heroic.

87
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:07,220
And if the wrestling narrative is any good, the hero may be knocked off of his game for

88
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:11,980
a while, but he'll learn, grow, heal up, and return to reclaim his belt in a climactic

89
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:15,180
final battle, generally during the pay-per-view.

90
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:16,700
The lesson's clear.

91
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:20,940
Strength is your best virtue for a single battle, but relying only on strength for a

92
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:23,920
long-term war is a sure way to lose that war.

93
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:28,020
Of course, people like to cry that wrestling's fake, and the physicality of the sport aside,

94
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:32,580
which is quite real, it doesn't actually matter if wrestling is fake, because it's a heroic

95
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:33,580
narrative.

96
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:36,260
Do you believe that movies are fake while you're watching them?

97
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:39,580
If they're good, you're too sucked into the story to even consider it.

98
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:42,620
And yeah, we psychologically react as if these things were real.

99
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:46,740
When you lose a fight in real life with another person, your testosterone goes down and the

100
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:47,740
winners goes up.

101
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:52,460
But if your favorite sports team loses a championship and you were really into the game, your testosterone

102
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:54,300
also goes down in a similar way.

103
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:57,740
And it's because sports is another similar heroic narrative.

104
00:05:57,740 --> 00:06:00,980
When you see the captain of a sports team holding up the championship cup, that's

105
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:06,100
not only the hero of the team, his team is a team of heroes of an entire league of teams.

106
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:09,460
It is simultaneously both the problem and the meta-problem.

107
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:10,460
It's all a hierarchy.

108
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:15,620
And as a cheeky aside, this is why any anarchist, communist or socialist, that talks about eliminating

109
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:20,260
hierarchy and implementing pure undifferentiated equality across all 7 point whatever billion

110
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:22,680
humans will never actually manage to do it.

111
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:24,620
They're fighting our biology.

112
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:28,120
Consider that when we observe pack animals behaving in a specific way that creates a

113
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:32,980
semblance of order within the pack, we view them through a human lens as following rules.

114
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:34,500
But they're not actually following rules.

115
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:38,500
There's actually not enough cognition there for them to be sophisticated enough to understand

116
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:39,820
what a rule is.

117
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:44,100
What they're doing is replicating a series of behaviors, partially from their genetics,

118
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:48,220
and partially socialized into them from other pack members, that create a stable society

119
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:49,220
of animals.

120
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:50,320
And that's not the same thing.

121
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:54,340
A rule is a human verbalization of a stable pack behavior.

122
00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:56,180
It is not the pack behavior itself.

123
00:06:56,180 --> 00:07:00,420
We see these behaviors in wolves, in lions, in chimps and gorillas.

124
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:04,500
The alpha of the pack may rule, but the alpha who doesn't let others eat, or who doesn't

125
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:08,800
engage in reciprocal grooming, or engage in play, or doesn't pay enough attention to

126
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:13,220
his mates and his offspring, will see himself torn to pieces by the rest of the pack regardless

127
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:14,500
of how strong he is.

128
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:19,500
In other words, even animals have figured out on some small level that strength is not

129
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:21,340
enough of a virtue on its own.

130
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:27,000
So yes, hierarchy is in our biology, but also so is a concept of fairness and compassion,

131
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,060
and even justice, which is where the fascists and the most cutthroat of corporatists have

132
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:33,040
it just as wrong as the radical left.

133
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:37,660
In much the same way, successful political regimes do not rely on only strength, because

134
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:39,920
if they do they become destabilized.

135
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:44,220
This is why authoritarian regimes, regardless of their political affiliation, have to constantly

136
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:47,420
conduct purges of even loyalists within the party.

137
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:51,560
In much the same way, this is also why idealist revolutionaries who are totally not like the

138
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:55,380
previous ones we promise, are always hidden authoritarians.

139
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:59,000
And even if they are truly as good as they claim to be, they'll find themselves with

140
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,880
a knife sticking out of their throat in the middle of the night, not long after they overthrow

141
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:05,580
the liberal power structure that was protecting their life.

142
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:09,300
This is because the archetypal hero, when brought to the sophistication level of the

143
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:15,200
political realm, is the one who leads a stable, free, fair, and prosperous state.

144
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:20,300
And just like every other level of sophistication, from pack alpha, to sports hero, to action

145
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:22,820
star, strength is not enough.

146
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:26,740
All heroic narratives, if they're actually worth consuming, will try to impart some kind

147
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:28,140
of universal truth.

148
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:32,160
Without spoiling too much here, the lesson of Harry Potter was, do not fear death so

149
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:34,340
much that you become a tyrant in the name of safety.

150
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:38,780
The lesson of Attack on Titan is, do not judge people by the sins of their ancestors.

151
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:42,000
And now you know why the white fragility lefty types hate that show.

152
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,300
Frozen's was, do not obsess over those things about you that you can't change.

153
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:50,660
The Lion King's was, do not let past traumas prevent you from growing and confronting the

154
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:51,660
tyrant.

155
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:56,420
This one, in fact, is one of the most common hero stories, from Hamlet, to Rocky, to professional

156
00:08:56,420 --> 00:08:57,420
wrestling.

157
00:08:57,420 --> 00:09:00,900
There's a reason why most ancient gods were gods of sight and speech.

158
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:05,300
There's a reason the Christian God, or his angels, are often depicted by an all-seeing

159
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:08,060
eye, and why God creates through speaking.

160
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:12,840
Our ancient ancestors understood that the foremost qualities of heroic ideal were vision

161
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:13,840
and truth.

162
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:18,500
That's why those heroes who lack those qualities, even if they're strong, or smart, or kind,

163
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:20,180
end up suffering throughout their narratives.

164
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:24,660
And in fact, the narratives that resonate the most with us are the ones where the heroes

165
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:28,820
suffer and have their eyes opened and learn the truth as a result of it.

166
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:33,940
These lessons need to be dramatized and acted out, not simply understood intellectually,

167
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:35,980
because humans aren't actually intellectual creatures.

168
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:38,400
We like to think we are, but we're really not.

169
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:42,500
We often behave in ways that we don't fully understand, but we do it because we know it

170
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:43,500
works.

171
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:47,480
That's why I talked about animals earlier, because even our closest ancestors behave

172
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:50,860
in ways that they don't understand, they only know that it works.

173
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:55,020
We were behaving creatures long before we were thinking creatures, and we described

174
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:58,660
those behaviors in drama long before we understood what they truly meant.

175
00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:00,040
And we still do that now.

176
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:05,060
There's been an ongoing evolutionary feedback loop happening since before humans were even

177
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:06,440
a distinct species.

178
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:10,720
Our biology informs us of the basic heroic knowledge in a primitive way.

179
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:14,640
That knowledge is diffused throughout all of us and our behaviors, creating the cultural

180
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:19,840
hero myth, and then each of us on an individual level bring that back into ourselves and try

181
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:22,360
to achieve the ideal through our own habits.

182
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:25,520
At least you do that if you're trying to make a good faith effort to build and improve.

183
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:29,400
And once you can articulate that ideal, then you have a hierarchy between the current you

184
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:31,080
and the person you wish to be.

185
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:34,880
And whenever you look up to another person, you're saying, in your subjective view of

186
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:38,080
the current hierarchy that you inhabit, that the person you're looking up to is at the

187
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,980
top of that hierarchy.

188
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:43,900
This is who you will have to become in order to get to where you want to go.

189
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:49,060
In my opinion, this is why the liberal individualist mindset, as opposed to the collectivist mindset

190
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:54,740
of the socialist or fascist, has created the most prosperous society that has ever existed.

191
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:58,500
Because while we recognize that the collective is important, it's what sustains us, it's

192
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:03,620
what socializes us, it's the driving force of the individual that reincorporates new

193
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:08,660
knowledge back into the collective by embodying the next iteration of the hero.

194
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:12,140
It's not enough for us to be told what good and evil are.

195
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:16,620
We have to be shown examples of good and evil, we have to be shown their consequences, and

196
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:20,680
we have to be shown it in a way that is engaging to us on a personal level.

197
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:25,260
And that is, just like any other art form, the moral value of professional wrestling.
