0	5280	I did a stream with a good friend of mine and famous Pokemon YouTuber, MadriBread yesterday.
5280	8000	If you haven't seen it yet, I recommend you go check it out.
8000	11600	There's not much in the way of visuals to it, so just throw it on in the background
11600	13440	and listen to it like a podcast.
13440	17600	He likes to come on my channel and talk politics because, being a Pokemon YouTuber and Let's
17600	20160	Player, he keeps his stuff relatively apolitical.
20160	23320	That being said, I made a comment on that stream that I don't think came out right
23320	27200	because, well, it's a stream, and I'm not that great without a script.
27200	30160	I can only imagine what I'm going to sound like at Joe Biden's age, god.
30160	35160	We were talking about professional wrestling, the WWE stuff, sports entertainment, the stuff
35160	36600	that is half fake.
36600	41000	I say half because while the outcomes of the matches, as well as other events, are scripted
41000	45080	ahead of time, and the wrestlers all play characters, there's also a lot of serious
45080	48600	physical work that goes into the actual performance of professional wrestling.
48600	51120	Those are real hits, they suffer real injuries.
51120	55460	DryBread described it, I think, as anime for Westerners, and I can see it because it follows
55460	58240	a similar structure to a lot of the long running shounen series.
58240	62680	I said something along the lines of, wrestling is Shakespeare for people who are not predisposed
62680	64220	to like Shakespeare.
64220	68140	That makes it sound like I'm saying wrestling is for people who are too dumb to like Shakespeare,
68140	71820	and that's absolutely not what I meant, sorry about that wrestling fans.
71820	75140	I know very intelligent people do in fact enjoy wrestling.
75140	79500	What I meant is more like this, there's drama of different levels of sophistication
79500	81120	for different people.
81120	84800	Wrestling drama may not be the most sophisticated, but that doesn't make it any less truthful
84800	85800	or valuable.
85800	90240	It's often said that religious instruction contains its truth for all levels of society
90240	94760	regardless of intelligence or occupation or class, and that it's equally important
94760	99320	that every person, regardless of their own natural proclivities, receive some source
99320	100320	of wisdom.
100320	104360	It's kind of like this, most people don't read, most people don't watch movies, most
104360	108840	people don't play video games, most people don't watch anime or soap operas or reality
108840	114440	TV or professional wrestling, but most people do at least one of those things.
115000	117640	This still sounds like I'm insulting wrestling fans, doesn't it?
117640	119000	I don't mean to.
119000	122760	Maybe there's some correlation between wrestling fans and intelligence, but I think it's
122760	127760	more like there's probably a strong correlation between wrestling fans and learning style.
127760	132660	Consider this, the less sophisticated the genre of drama, the more it is like real life.
132660	137480	The more sophisticated the genre of drama, the more it has abstracted out across multiple
137480	142280	different experiences of real life the fundamental lessons it's trying to impart onto the consumer.
142320	147000	For example, wrestling is more like real life, it's relatable, we've all been in a competition
147000	150760	in school where we've wanted to win, sports or otherwise, or we've had to deal with
150760	152760	a bully or something like that.
152760	158320	Meanwhile a highly fantastical movie, like say Harry Potter, is not at all realistic,
158320	162540	but it can amalgamate multiple instances of the same truths into a more archetypal story.
162540	166200	The former is more relatable, but the latter applies across a wider scope.
166200	171320	And imparting the fundamental truths is the whole point why cultures develop heroic narratives.
171360	174680	Maybe you have a problem, you gotta pay your rent, or you have to get some food to eat,
174680	179120	or you have to find a girlfriend or something, but that's not the real problem you have.
179120	184400	The real problem is that problems exist, and your current problem is only one piece of
184400	185760	the meta problem.
185760	189960	If you can solve your current problem by embodying the qualities of a hero, as laid out for you
189960	192320	by the media you consume, then great!
192320	195960	But it's better to try and solve the meta problem, which means that you need to not
195960	200300	simply understand how to be strong, or how to be smart, or how to be kind, but how to
200300	202440	be all of the qualities of a hero.
202440	206600	People think the proverb, give a man a fish and he eats for a day, teach a man to fish
206600	210920	and he feeds himself for a lifetime, refers to the value of education, and it does.
210920	215860	But even more so, it refers to humanity's constant quest to generalize wisdom such that
215860	220500	as many people as possible can inherit it, while simultaneously making that wisdom apply
220500	223080	to as many individual problems as possible.
223080	227580	In other words, maximizing the number of pieces of the meta problem that it can tackle.
227580	231880	And the goal is something like, it's not about how you solve your problem, it's about
231880	236500	how do you behave that you can start actually tackling the meta problem of life itself.
236500	238540	Wrestling imparts this knowledge in a great way.
238540	240560	Like I said before, it's quite relatable.
240560	243600	Wrestling stories are classic good versus evil, but they're not verbalized, they're
243600	246480	not conceptualized, they're acted out instead.
246480	250220	And wrestling teaches an important lesson about solving the meta problem of life.
250220	255660	It's not enough to only be strong, or only be wise, or only be generous, or only be just,
255660	257060	or only be kind.
257060	259980	You have to be all of those things to be a good person.
259980	264420	A hero has to be physically strong, but if the only virtue that a character in any narrative
264420	269100	has is strength, then that character will either suffer and grow, or that character
269100	270780	will stop being a hero.
270780	276260	Unless you're John Cena, but that's why everybody except the youngest of kids find him boring.
276260	277260	No offense.
277260	279180	And we see this all the time in wrestling.
279180	281860	The weak hero loses in a straight fight against the villain.
281860	286580	A strong hero who isn't wise will get ambushed backstage by three dudes who kick the shit
286580	287580	out of him.
287580	291540	A strong, wise hero who isn't kind will discover that during a critical moment of
291540	296540	the match, his best friend has turned on him, charged the ring, and bashed his head in with
296540	297620	a folding chair.
297620	300460	And the lesson that the audience is meant to take away is clear.
300460	303340	You have to have all of these qualities to be heroic.
303340	307220	And if the wrestling narrative is any good, the hero may be knocked off of his game for
307220	311980	a while, but he'll learn, grow, heal up, and return to reclaim his belt in a climactic
311980	315180	final battle, generally during the pay-per-view.
315180	316700	The lesson's clear.
316700	320940	Strength is your best virtue for a single battle, but relying only on strength for a
320940	323920	long-term war is a sure way to lose that war.
323920	328020	Of course, people like to cry that wrestling's fake, and the physicality of the sport aside,
328020	332580	which is quite real, it doesn't actually matter if wrestling is fake, because it's a heroic
332580	333580	narrative.
333580	336260	Do you believe that movies are fake while you're watching them?
336300	339580	If they're good, you're too sucked into the story to even consider it.
339580	342620	And yeah, we psychologically react as if these things were real.
342620	346740	When you lose a fight in real life with another person, your testosterone goes down and the
346740	347740	winners goes up.
347740	352460	But if your favorite sports team loses a championship and you were really into the game, your testosterone
352460	354300	also goes down in a similar way.
354300	357740	And it's because sports is another similar heroic narrative.
357740	360980	When you see the captain of a sports team holding up the championship cup, that's
360980	366100	not only the hero of the team, his team is a team of heroes of an entire league of teams.
366100	369460	It is simultaneously both the problem and the meta-problem.
369460	370460	It's all a hierarchy.
370460	375620	And as a cheeky aside, this is why any anarchist, communist or socialist, that talks about eliminating
375620	380260	hierarchy and implementing pure undifferentiated equality across all 7 point whatever billion
380260	382680	humans will never actually manage to do it.
382680	384620	They're fighting our biology.
384620	388120	Consider that when we observe pack animals behaving in a specific way that creates a
388120	392980	semblance of order within the pack, we view them through a human lens as following rules.
392980	394500	But they're not actually following rules.
394540	398500	There's actually not enough cognition there for them to be sophisticated enough to understand
398500	399820	what a rule is.
399820	404100	What they're doing is replicating a series of behaviors, partially from their genetics,
404100	408220	and partially socialized into them from other pack members, that create a stable society
408220	409220	of animals.
409220	410320	And that's not the same thing.
410320	414340	A rule is a human verbalization of a stable pack behavior.
414340	416180	It is not the pack behavior itself.
416180	420420	We see these behaviors in wolves, in lions, in chimps and gorillas.
420420	424500	The alpha of the pack may rule, but the alpha who doesn't let others eat, or who doesn't
424500	428800	engage in reciprocal grooming, or engage in play, or doesn't pay enough attention to
428800	433220	his mates and his offspring, will see himself torn to pieces by the rest of the pack regardless
433220	434500	of how strong he is.
434500	439500	In other words, even animals have figured out on some small level that strength is not
439500	441340	enough of a virtue on its own.
441340	447000	So yes, hierarchy is in our biology, but also so is a concept of fairness and compassion,
447000	451060	and even justice, which is where the fascists and the most cutthroat of corporatists have
451060	453040	it just as wrong as the radical left.
453040	457660	In much the same way, successful political regimes do not rely on only strength, because
457660	459920	if they do they become destabilized.
459920	464220	This is why authoritarian regimes, regardless of their political affiliation, have to constantly
464220	467420	conduct purges of even loyalists within the party.
467420	471560	In much the same way, this is also why idealist revolutionaries who are totally not like the
471560	475380	previous ones we promise, are always hidden authoritarians.
475380	479000	And even if they are truly as good as they claim to be, they'll find themselves with
479000	482880	a knife sticking out of their throat in the middle of the night, not long after they overthrow
482880	485580	the liberal power structure that was protecting their life.
485580	489300	This is because the archetypal hero, when brought to the sophistication level of the
489300	495200	political realm, is the one who leads a stable, free, fair, and prosperous state.
495200	500300	And just like every other level of sophistication, from pack alpha, to sports hero, to action
500300	502820	star, strength is not enough.
502820	506740	All heroic narratives, if they're actually worth consuming, will try to impart some kind
506740	508140	of universal truth.
508140	512160	Without spoiling too much here, the lesson of Harry Potter was, do not fear death so
512160	514340	much that you become a tyrant in the name of safety.
514340	518780	The lesson of Attack on Titan is, do not judge people by the sins of their ancestors.
518780	522000	And now you know why the white fragility lefty types hate that show.
522000	526300	Frozen's was, do not obsess over those things about you that you can't change.
526300	530660	The Lion King's was, do not let past traumas prevent you from growing and confronting the
530660	531660	tyrant.
531660	536420	This one, in fact, is one of the most common hero stories, from Hamlet, to Rocky, to professional
536420	537420	wrestling.
537420	540900	There's a reason why most ancient gods were gods of sight and speech.
540900	545300	There's a reason the Christian God, or his angels, are often depicted by an all-seeing
545300	548060	eye, and why God creates through speaking.
548060	552840	Our ancient ancestors understood that the foremost qualities of heroic ideal were vision
552840	553840	and truth.
553840	558500	That's why those heroes who lack those qualities, even if they're strong, or smart, or kind,
558500	560180	end up suffering throughout their narratives.
560220	564660	And in fact, the narratives that resonate the most with us are the ones where the heroes
564660	568820	suffer and have their eyes opened and learn the truth as a result of it.
568820	573940	These lessons need to be dramatized and acted out, not simply understood intellectually,
573940	575980	because humans aren't actually intellectual creatures.
575980	578400	We like to think we are, but we're really not.
578400	582500	We often behave in ways that we don't fully understand, but we do it because we know it
582500	583500	works.
583500	587480	That's why I talked about animals earlier, because even our closest ancestors behave
587480	590860	in ways that they don't understand, they only know that it works.
590860	595020	We were behaving creatures long before we were thinking creatures, and we described
595020	598660	those behaviors in drama long before we understood what they truly meant.
598660	600040	And we still do that now.
600040	605060	There's been an ongoing evolutionary feedback loop happening since before humans were even
605060	606440	a distinct species.
606440	610720	Our biology informs us of the basic heroic knowledge in a primitive way.
610720	614640	That knowledge is diffused throughout all of us and our behaviors, creating the cultural
614640	619840	hero myth, and then each of us on an individual level bring that back into ourselves and try
619840	622360	to achieve the ideal through our own habits.
622360	625520	At least you do that if you're trying to make a good faith effort to build and improve.
625520	629400	And once you can articulate that ideal, then you have a hierarchy between the current you
629400	631080	and the person you wish to be.
631080	634880	And whenever you look up to another person, you're saying, in your subjective view of
634880	638080	the current hierarchy that you inhabit, that the person you're looking up to is at the
638080	639980	top of that hierarchy.
639980	643900	This is who you will have to become in order to get to where you want to go.
643900	649060	In my opinion, this is why the liberal individualist mindset, as opposed to the collectivist mindset
649060	654740	of the socialist or fascist, has created the most prosperous society that has ever existed.
654740	658500	Because while we recognize that the collective is important, it's what sustains us, it's
658500	663620	what socializes us, it's the driving force of the individual that reincorporates new
663620	668660	knowledge back into the collective by embodying the next iteration of the hero.
668660	672140	It's not enough for us to be told what good and evil are.
672140	676620	We have to be shown examples of good and evil, we have to be shown their consequences, and
676620	680680	we have to be shown it in a way that is engaging to us on a personal level.
680680	685260	And that is, just like any other art form, the moral value of professional wrestling.
