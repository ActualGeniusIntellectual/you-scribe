1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,320
Justin Trudeau called an election and you know what that means it's another SFO

2
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:14,640
Trudeau video. I've done a few of these now over the course of the history of my

3
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:19,120
channel and we vote in the 20th so now is as good a time as any. First of all I

4
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:23,140
want to make it clear that absolutely nobody wanted this election and it's

5
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:27,440
almost insane that Justin Trudeau would call it because the ball was in his

6
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:30,320
court. For those of you who don't know Canada works on the British

7
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:34,600
parliamentary system. The idea is if you have a majority of the seats in the

8
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:39,840
House of Commons your party is locked in for five years and so when Justin Trudeau

9
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:44,760
won a majority in 2015 he was locked in for five years. The next election saw him

10
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:48,200
win a minority. A minority government is when you don't have enough seats to form

11
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:51,920
the majority but other parties decide to prop you up in the coalition and

12
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:55,840
generally a minority government topples because those other parties have

13
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:59,400
withdrawn support triggering an election. Didn't happen this time though

14
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:04,520
this time Trudeau just triggered one out of the blue and even now nobody seems to

15
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:08,360
know why it just seems like he thinks he's really popular and he can try and

16
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:12,720
get another majority. It really feels like a power grab and so far it's kind

17
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:17,400
of been backfiring in his face. So a few months ago this motion went through

18
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:22,200
Parliament. Now a motion is not a a legally binding document it's not a law

19
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:27,080
it's just Parliament's declaration of intent and the motion reads that the

20
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:30,580
House remind the government that a general election was held in October

21
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:37,100
2019 and sadly note that more than 1.3 million Canadians including almost 360

22
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:42,560
thousand Quebecers have been infected with COVID-19 and that nearly 25,000

23
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:47,400
people have died as a result and in the opinion of the House holding an election

24
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:51,480
during a pandemic would be irresponsible and that it is the responsibility of the

25
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:54,680
government to make every effort to ensure that voters are not called to

26
00:01:54,680 --> 00:02:00,000
the polls as long as this pandemic continues. And nearly everybody agreed to

27
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:07,120
this motion 320 yeses one no including all the liberals including Trudeau

28
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:10,880
himself and yet just a few months later on August 19th Trudeau called his

29
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:15,760
election. I can't emphasize enough how how dumb this seems to be like there was

30
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:20,080
no reason to do it Trudeau's popularity was already down his opponents are

31
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:23,920
actually stronger than they were in 2019 regardless of how you feel about

32
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:28,480
coronavirus the population here in Canada certainly does not want to be

33
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:33,880
voting during the pandemic this has been a deeply unpopular move and it has

34
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:38,200
exposed Trudeau's baldness in trying to consolidate power Trudeau's public

35
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:42,480
events have been marred by protesters.

36
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:57,600
To stand up for people here and you know what we did it we won you guys are

37
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:04,200
still able to export to the United States on privileged terms thanks to our

38
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:07,560
collective success then.

39
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:24,600
At one point his campaign bus was blocked in by angry people

40
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:39,600
Oh

41
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:12,760
At another event people threw rocks at him and by the way that's assault guys

42
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:22,680
don't don't go throwing rocks at anybody all right. He has had to cancel events

43
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:27,360
due to how deeply unpopular he is. Hey Trudeau remember how liberal leaders

44
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:32,360
used to deal with protesters in their way? I sure do. Over the course of the

45
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:36,520
campaign the Canadian polls have looked something like this the Liberals down

46
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:41,040
the Conservatives up the NDP sitting in a comfortable third place as they always

47
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:45,760
do a complete destruction of the Green Party and the PPC is slowly rising up

48
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:49,260
however now that we're closer to the polling day the Liberals and

49
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:53,340
Conservative are both neck and neck but not because the Liberals went up but the

50
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:58,400
Conservatives went down instead the PPC is rising now I'm not somebody who's

51
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:02,920
breathing in a shit ton of copium there is no chance the PPC forms a government

52
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:06,280
they might get a seat or two here or there but at this point the race is

53
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:10,800
basically neck-to-neck during a campaign stop Trudeau is asked about his own

54
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:16,360
campaign violating COVID restrictions by jamming so many supporters and

55
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:21,280
journalists into the same room at once and in the usual Trudeau fashion he

56
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:24,720
completely dodges the question yes the videos from Rebel News and I don't like

57
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:28,600
those guys either but they pulled it from CPAC this is not some kind of a

58
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,640
trick this is the real deal check it out

59
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:03,560
I'm not sure that was an answer to my question so did you get special clearance to hold an

60
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:07,800
event that exceeds current crowd capacity in Ontario indoors we're going

61
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:13,800
to continue to do everything we can to keep people safe we will always follow

62
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:18,940
public health guidance we will follow the best recommendations of the public

63
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:23,720
health experts advising our campaign and the first and most fundamental thing we

64
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:27,920
do is to be able to look at Canadians and say every single one of our

65
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:33,160
candidates is doing the right thing and speaking of chrono bars Trudeau was

66
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:37,600
basically on the same train as Nancy Pelosi back before it hit you were a

67
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:41,840
racist for worrying about it and lockdowns or other measures were just

68
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:46,760
conspiracy theories how dare you even say that we do them in fact Canada was

69
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:52,160
so sure of that position that Ottawa sent 16 tons of personal protective

70
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:57,520
equipment to China in February of 2020 of course like everyone else a year

71
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:02,400
later he had changed his tune rolling lockdowns restrictions mask mandates

72
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:07,200
and now vaccines and keep in mind I'm not an anti-vaxxer I've said this many

73
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:11,600
times all across the internet and I'll say it again at this point I'm pretty

74
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:15,760
sure the vaccines are safe yes there are side effects there are complications the

75
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:19,480
chances of you having a complication from the vaccine are lower than the

76
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:22,880
chances of you having a complication from naturally catching the corona

77
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:29,240
virus so generally for most people you should get the vaccine but it is 100%

78
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:33,760
government overreach for them to demand that you get the vaccine for them to

79
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:37,320
force you to for them to insist that you show your papers just to go outside of

80
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:41,240
your house that is not a scientific conversation it's a political one and

81
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:45,200
the people who are endorsing it are tyrants and just like with every other

82
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:49,760
tyrant the rules don't apply to them here's January 26th 2021 Trudeau is

83
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:53,960
warning about new travel restrictions coming to Canada and Canada's exposure

84
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:58,480
notification app and while his official Twitter account was tweeting this he was

85
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:02,640
vacationing in the Caribbean Trudeau has repeatedly lied about the status of

86
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:05,960
Canadian readiness when it comes to stuff like personal protective

87
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:10,880
equipment masks and hospitals and other most famously though he lied about local

88
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:15,720
vaccine production he announced that it would be ready in 2021 but the company

89
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:19,320
that his government enlisted soon after clarified they won't be producing

90
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:24,000
doses until 2022 nonetheless Trudeau's government is demanding that all

91
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:29,680
government workers get the vaccine this page dropped August 13th 2021 and

92
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:34,280
actually was quickly taken down when Trudeau decided that he wanted to call

93
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:38,400
an election and he realized this would be a very unpopular move so it went up

94
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:41,720
and then down and it's been scrubbed from the internet and just in case I

95
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:47,480
couldn't be more clear about my contempt for Justin Trudeau this explicit threat

96
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:54,000
by sitting Prime Minister is disgusting and is completely 100% unacceptable in a

97
00:08:54,000 --> 00:09:00,280
free open and democratic society but the bottom line is if anyone who doesn't

98
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:06,040
have a legitimate medical reason for not getting fully vaccinated chooses to not

99
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:09,960
get vaccinated there will be consequences as I've said I'm no

100
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:13,520
anti-vaxxer and the vaccines work but if this is how the government is going to

101
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:17,240
behave I will play chicken with you right up until the end of course it's

102
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:20,840
not just Trudeau in the Liberal Party all of Canada's left-leaning politicians

103
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:25,880
want to force-vax people at some point I will need to do a video on Jagmeet Singh

104
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:29,080
because at the end of the day he's a terrorist sympathizer a communist

105
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:32,960
mass-murder sympathizer and a Sikh supremacist as well as the leader of

106
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:39,120
Canada's NDP but for the purposes of this video he is 100% on board with

107
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:43,360
fucking people who don't comply with the government we know that the vast

108
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:47,200
majority Canadians want to do their part to keep people safe and want to get

109
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:51,520
vaccinated and we also know that the vast majority Canadians believe in in

110
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:55,880
having some way to prove that that vaccination having a vaccine passport

111
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:58,840
and we know that people on the front line that are providing care or

112
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:03,160
providing services directly to Canadians can pose the higher risk and should be

113
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:07,480
vaccinated so we would work with unions and work with the workers on the ground

114
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:11,200
to make sure we establish a way to move forward but we absolutely believe that

115
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:14,360
there needs to be mandatory vaccines and there would be consequences for those

116
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:18,800
who are not able to or not willing to do that thankfully the most poll he

117
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:24,680
actually has is streaming jackbox on twitch where he draws Justin Trudeau

118
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:30,000
losing an election to him keep dreaming buddy the coronavirus has hit everyone

119
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,480
economically quite badly including Canada Trudeau's plans for a carbon tax

120
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:39,680
increase have basically been destroyed due to the pandemic and pandemic spending

121
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:43,840
just like every other Western nation has destroyed our economy Canada's current

122
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:48,000
deficit level will be unsustainable within one to two years and it's been a

123
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,280
year since this was published so we are on the verge of being fucked right now

124
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:57,920
and despite the call for more taxes more taxes more taxes taxes remain the

125
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:02,800
largest expense for Canadian families with the average Canadian household

126
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:06,680
earning ninety six thousand three hundred and thirty three dollars and

127
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:12,720
paying thirty five thousand and forty seven dollars in taxes that's thirty

128
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:17,480
six point four percent of their income going to taxes compared to thirty five

129
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:22,880
point four percent going to housing food and clothing combined and although I'm

130
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:27,080
not necessarily a believer in grand conspiracy theories I do at the very

131
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:32,240
least like to keep a pulse on them and Trudeau is absolutely 100% on board with

132
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:37,000
the great reset building back better means getting support to the most

133
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:41,280
vulnerable while maintaining our momentum on reaching the 2030 agenda for

134
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:46,920
sustainable development and the SDGs Canada is here to listen and to help

135
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:51,920
this pandemic has provided an opportunity for a reset this is our

136
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:56,640
chance to accelerate our pre-pandemic efforts to reimagine economic systems

137
00:11:56,640 --> 00:12:01,240
that actually address global challenges like extreme poverty inequality and

138
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:05,120
climate change but considering Justin Trudeau's dim-witted nature I don't

139
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:09,320
actually think this is part of some kind of grand Bilderberg lizard men

140
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:13,000
conspiracy theory of trying to create a one-world government I think Trudeau

141
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:17,680
thinks it sounds good and appeals to his base and so he's virtue signaling

142
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:22,520
because almost the entirety of Trudeau's government has been about virtue

143
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:26,760
signaling this is a man who will appeal to every single issue in the book

144
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:33,160
anti-semitism Islamophobia women's rights LGBTQ rights French language

145
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:37,680
rights classism even fat phobia it doesn't matter he is a pure

146
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:42,600
intersectionalist and so when sometimes these intersections come into conflict

147
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:47,240
Trudeau is often left holding his dick this was a scandal over a year ago when

148
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:53,800
Trudeau defended not publicly supporting LGBTQ rights in Senegal and taking a

149
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:58,160
photo of him bowing towards an Iranian minister who is known for being quite

150
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:04,080
anti LGBTQ it turns out you cannot be on the right side of every single issue

151
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:06,920
because they come into conflict all the time

152
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:11,080
Trudeau has given taxpayer money to support black Canadian entrepreneurs

153
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:16,120
again leaning into intersectional race based bullshit surely we should just be

154
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:20,640
supporting Canadian entrepreneurs regardless of their skin color a member

155
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:25,800
of Trudeau's cabinet attended an arranged marriage ceremony where a young

156
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:30,040
woman was auctioned to the highest bidder I guess despite the feminist

157
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:35,000
leanings of Justin Trudeau selling women is okay as long as it's a beautiful

158
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:39,280
native culture that's doing it meanwhile at the same time another member of

159
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:44,000
Trudeau's cabinet when talking about the current Afghanistan crisis referred to

160
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:50,520
the Taliban as our brothers Trudeau's government put forward bill c6 back in

161
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:56,440
2017 making it so that people who immigrated to Canada became terrorists

162
00:13:56,440 --> 00:14:01,440
and committed terrorist attacks cannot be stripped of their citizenship and

163
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:05,720
sent back by the Canadian government and just like in the United States the

164
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:10,160
Canadian government has authorized the tearing down of statues related to our

165
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:13,800
history but unlike the United States these aren't Confederate statues or

166
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:17,720
something this is Sir John A Macdonald Canada's first prime minister this is an

167
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:22,560
erasure of our history our identity our culture as Canadians by our own

168
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:26,320
government I know in one of those previous Trudeau videos I don't remember

169
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:32,000
which I made fun of Trudeau saying people kind not mankind well here's some

170
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:38,520
more recent cringe for you enjoy it is exactly the example of the kinds of

171
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:43,440
things you need to do to counter the she said the she session and turn it into a

172
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:48,240
she-covery just like with every other woke oid Justin Trudeau's virtue

173
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:53,240
signaling is an act designed to hide exactly how he does not live up to his

174
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:57,480
own principles for example despite Trudeau's lip service on environmental

175
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:01,520
issues his party has designated environmental protesters as federal

176
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:05,840
security threats additionally during this election cycle the Liberals have

177
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:11,040
promised to build 1.4 million new homes and ban foreign home ownership both

178
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:15,560
ideas that are popular but also both that they had six years implement so far

179
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:19,400
meanwhile the Liberals of Vancouver candidate a city where the housing

180
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:23,880
squeeze has hit people the hardest is known for flipping dozens of homes a

181
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:28,200
topic which Justin Trudeau has absolutely nothing to say about his

182
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:32,760
candidate sure does though how much have you profited on those 25 in the past

183
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:40,200
decade I mean I'm not you know I think it's important to talk about I'm gonna

184
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:43,840
answer that question again so I don't be sure yeah how much have you profited on

185
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:46,280
those sales

186
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:52,720
I when you ask I'm gonna give me a second to just make sure I have the

187
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:58,920
right okay so sorry ask me the question yes sir yeah yeah how much have you

188
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:03,800
profited personally or business-wise on the sales of those 25 properties in the

189
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:08,920
last decade while I can't give you an exact number what I can tell you is that

190
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:12,680
it is by no means the number that has been bit forward but what I can also

191
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:16,440
tell you is that I am absolutely committed to any and all measures that

192
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:23,160
we have put forward that would that would apply I am still waiting for a

193
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:27,360
number outside here if he has one a bottom line he doesn't seem to think or

194
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:30,920
won't say that his past business dealings are part of this unafford

195
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:35,160
unaffordability problem another of his candidates I think it's pronounced Raj

196
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:41,360
Saini has been accused for six years now of multiple instances of sexual

197
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:46,400
misconduct and despite those accusations despite Trudeau's feminist credentials

198
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:50,520
and his glowing support of the me2 movement his party has still allowed him

199
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:55,800
to run at least until another set of more recent allegations dropped and

200
00:16:55,800 --> 00:17:00,160
Trudeau finally asked Saini to step down not without the Liberal Party giving him

201
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:05,040
$93,000 though of course there are actually more legitimate scandals

202
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:08,760
surrounding Trudeau's government not just virtue signaling and hypocrisy but

203
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:13,600
actually violating the law the most recent high-profile scandal revolves

204
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:18,440
around the we organization which paid hundreds of thousands of dollars in

205
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:24,520
speaking fees to Trudeau's wife mother and brother and completely coincidentally

206
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:30,280
I'm sure later received a 900 million dollar contract with the Canadian

207
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:34,800
federal government during a remote only session of Parliament because this was

208
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:38,840
early in the pandemic Trudeau had to give testimony about his involvement

209
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:45,200
with the we charity and it did not look good for him yes or no question mr. chair

210
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:51,640
prime minister you twice were found guilty of breaking the ethics act after

211
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:57,880
those two convictions did you decide to read the act you got 14 seconds prime

212
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:02,480
minister yes I have read the act a number of times are you aware of section

213
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:08,800
21 yes since I've read the act I'm aware of section what does it say I can pull

214
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:12,080
it up for you but if you have it in front of you well it says a public

215
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:15,840
office holder of which you are one shall recuse himself or herself from any

216
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:21,640
discussion to decision debate or vote in any matter in which in respect of

217
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:25,520
which he or she would be in a conflict of interest now what you've admitted

218
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:30,560
today is not just that you were in a conflict of interest but that you

219
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:35,720
consciously recognized in your May cabinet meeting that such a conflict

220
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:40,640
might exist that it didn't just slide by your desk that you were consciously

221
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:45,800
aware that there was a an inappropriate link to your family that would put

222
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:51,760
you in a conflict why did you at that moment not call the ethics commissioner

223
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:59,560
and recuse yourself that is simply not true mr. Paul yeah the issue of

224
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:05,120
advancing issues for one's own and by the way the ethics commissioner is

225
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:09,520
looking into this right now and I fully trust his judgment on on determining it

226
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:14,040
but at the same time my concern around accusing myself was a question around

227
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:19,120
perceptions because I know well that this Canada summer students grant for

228
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:25,400
16 to directly benefit my mother or my brother your 16 seconds are obvious

229
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:30,600
your 16 seconds are up I'm gonna ask you again because you know nobody nobody

230
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:35,360
believes you when you say you don't know how much money your family has got from

231
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:39,640
the wheat group you've had a month to look into that you knew you were going

232
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:46,000
to testify here again how much money total have your brother mother and

233
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:52,280
spouse received from this organization how much that information has been

234
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:58,080
publicly shared but I will tell you what it is how much has just the dollar

235
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:02,320
figure throughout her life the dollar figure prime minister this ways and is

236
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:06,980
how much of the work that she's done and I'm proud of how much I'm looking for a

237
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:10,700
dollar figure we can get that number for you if you like it's been in out in

238
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:15,660
the media it's been in the media but you don't know it you don't know how much

239
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:18,860
your family has received from this organization which you tried to give a

240
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:26,620
half billion dollars really I'm waiting you haven't done an answer so far let's

241
00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:34,260
make this the first one my mother has worked as an advocate the dollar figure

242
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:57,620
speaker good organizations across the country I do not feel that into the

243
00:20:57,620 --> 00:21:03,540
work my mother is doing and eventually he had to come out and

244
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:09,420
apologize for not recusing himself in the we charity contract decision but

245
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:13,700
this sort of government corruption where money's changing hands all the time is

246
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:18,060
not something that Justin Trudeau is a stranger to everyone at this point

247
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:22,820
remembers the SNC lava Lynn scandal and if you don't to be honest it's an

248
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:26,900
extremely complicated topic that I've already done a deep dive into so if you

249
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:30,700
want to know what's going on please go watch that video but Trudeau has been

250
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:36,580
blocking the investigation into him and his party every way he can

251
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:15,740
she said that she then committed to revisit and look into the decision once

252
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:22,300
again mr. speaker all these are elements in the testimony examined exhaustively

253
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:27,220
now the Prime Minister has caught himself in a trap of his own making he

254
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:33,860
came out on February 15th and compliant said that no one had come forward to

255
00:22:33,860 --> 00:22:40,500
raise any concerns about his conduct and now he admits on the floor of the House

256
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:46,780
of Commons that way before in September his own Attorney General asked him to

257
00:22:46,780 --> 00:22:49,180
his face

258
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:55,820
prime minister having so much difficulty remembering his story is it because it's

259
00:22:55,820 --> 00:23:03,140
simply not true and Jody Wilson Raybould the person who ultimately blew the

260
00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:07,380
whistle on Trudeau's wrongdoing has finally been allowed to publish a book

261
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:11,620
on what she knows now that the investigation is wrapping up let me read

262
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:15,180
a short excerpt from the book for you I know the Prime Minister had always

263
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:19,700
considered me a challenge not political enough too independent-minded and

264
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:24,580
ultimately not part of the inner liberal crowd I think I was foreign and

265
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:29,660
incomprehensible to him after all I was from the other side of the tracks I was

266
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:34,100
an indigenous girl from a small fishing village Cape Mudge on the southern tip

267
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:39,140
of Quadra Island just off Vancouver Island I am Jesus this word dude

268
00:23:39,140 --> 00:23:48,060
kawaka wacko okay quack wacka wacko quack wack wack all right the Prime

269
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:51,660
Minister did not grow up in my neighborhoods with the kids I grew up

270
00:23:51,660 --> 00:23:55,420
with none of his family went to residential schools my childhood

271
00:23:55,420 --> 00:23:59,500
memories are closer to commox and Cape Mudge than rock cliff my political point

272
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:03,460
of reference was the big house not the House of Commons to be fair he did not

273
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:08,700
choose how and where he grew up or who his parents were but liberals political

274
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:12,940
parties not my world there is no question in my mind that the Prime

275
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:16,220
Minister knew there were attempts to pressure me to avoid a criminal

276
00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:21,640
prosecution of SNC lavalin and while those attempts failed thankfully they

277
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:25,960
were wrong and he knew it instead of simply addressing the issue publicly and

278
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:29,560
accurately the government was sending out talking heads to make comments that

279
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:34,280
evidence has now shown were not accurate or right I told him that he should be

280
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:38,400
telling Canadians the truth the Prime Minister seemed to be listening intently

281
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:43,920
I never directed he said referring to interfering in my role as the Attorney

282
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:48,840
General in relation to the SNC lavalin prosecution his public lines started

283
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:52,680
coming which were designed to deny responsibility and culpability there

284
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:56,440
are differences between pressure and direction he emphasized we talked about

285
00:24:56,440 --> 00:25:00,560
our soon-to-be infamous meeting with the clerk of the Privy Council on September

286
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:06,680
17th 2018 riot asked him directly when SNC lavalin was raised are you

287
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:11,760
politically interfering with my role my decision as the Attorney General I would

288
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:16,280
strongly advise against it he repeated in that Airport room that I was not

289
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:20,000
shuffled from being Minister of Justice and Attorney General because of SNC

290
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:25,080
lavalin as he went on I suddenly blurred it out I don't want you to say anything

291
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:29,520
further about what happened after September 17th to this day I'm still

292
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:33,880
surprised I said it I know why I did it and why I wanted him to stop talking I

293
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:38,480
was trying to leave space open for a constructive solution to the mess the PM

294
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:42,800
in his office had created and that in my overly optimistic opinion could still be

295
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:46,560
found either the Prime Minister knew everything that had happened and did not

296
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:50,640
care and was clearly lying to me in the country or he didn't know what had been

297
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:54,600
happening during the months after September 17th to try to exert pressure

298
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:59,120
on me and was not in control of his office as I had in the past I gave the

299
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:03,240
Prime Minister the benefit of the doubt for what would be the last time I made

300
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:07,240
it very clear I did not trust the people around him and that he was being badly

301
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:10,880
advised in this situation he made it equally clear to me that he would never

302
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:14,760
fire some of them so I laid out the only other options that existed the

303
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:18,200
Prime Minister's office stuck with its current approach of changing its story

304
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:22,160
over and over again which would only make things worse in which case I would

305
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:26,960
resign or he came out and came clean and we placed our trust in the truth and in

306
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:31,980
Canadians I pushed the second option he said he would think about it and that we

307
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:35,720
would talk again we met again on February 11th and proceeded to cover the

308
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:40,200
same ground as the day before I recounted again the incidents where

309
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:45,080
pressure was attempted and he again had excuses or answers for everything he

310
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:49,320
repeated that he would not clean house or fire anyone and then he offered up if

311
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:53,640
we did we would not be in government in October I replied I would be surprised

312
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:56,880
if we were in government if you did not clean at least some of the house in some

313
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:02,280
way and call some type of investigation I added after all if you're confident

314
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:05,740
you did nothing wrong then why would you not want to do this this was about the

315
00:27:05,740 --> 00:27:09,280
maintenance of the rule of law and the fundamental tenets of our democracy

316
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:14,400
surely this was worthy of our attention he again insisted no one would be fired

317
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:18,800
I could see the agitation visibly building in the Prime Minister his mood

318
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:22,960
was shifting I remember seeing it I remember feeling it I had seen and felt

319
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:26,760
this before in a few occasions when he would get frustrated and angry but this

320
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:31,200
was different he had become strident and disputed everything I had said he made

321
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:34,280
it clear that everyone in his office was telling the truth and that I and by

322
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:38,420
extension at Jessica Prince my chief of staff and others were not he told me I

323
00:27:38,420 --> 00:27:42,340
had not experienced what I said I did he used the line that would later become

324
00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:46,140
public that I had experienced things differently I knew what he was really

325
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:52,020
asking what he was saying in that moment I knew he wanted me to lie to attest

326
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:55,740
that what had occurred had not occurred for me this was just more evidence that

327
00:27:55,740 --> 00:28:00,940
he did not know me did not know who I was or where I was from me lie to

328
00:28:00,940 --> 00:28:05,820
protect a crown government acting badly a political party a leader who was not

329
00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:11,100
taking responsibility he must be delusional Jody Wilson-Raybould in her

330
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:15,380
capacity as Attorney General attempted to see justice done in retaliation

331
00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:20,140
Trudeau protecting himself and others removed her from her office and the

332
00:28:20,140 --> 00:28:25,420
Liberal Party and in my opinion it is quite notable that despite being

333
00:28:25,420 --> 00:28:31,580
expelled from the party in 2019 she ran and won her seat as an independent and

334
00:28:31,580 --> 00:28:36,020
even though I personally do have some differences of opinion with her over

335
00:28:36,020 --> 00:28:40,460
other political topics I can certainly respect her for her conviction jumping

336
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:45,300
off of that topic I think it's now probably important to talk about the

337
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:49,460
aspects of Justin Trudeau's government that are this point just openly

338
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:54,860
tyrannical we'll start with the easy one free speech has limits Canada's Trudeau

339
00:28:54,860 --> 00:29:00,220
says if it did then it would not be free Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau

340
00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:04,860
defended free speech on Friday but added that it was not without limits and

341
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:09,420
should not arbitrarily and needlessly hurt certain communities we owe it to

342
00:29:09,420 --> 00:29:13,980
ourselves to act with respect for others and to seek not to arbitrarily or

343
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:18,020
unnecessarily injure those with whom we are sharing a society and a planet we do

344
00:29:18,020 --> 00:29:21,700
not have the right for example to shout fire in a movie theater crowded with

345
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:26,580
people there are always limits sure but what certain communities are affected by

346
00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:31,700
this in a pluralist diverse and respectful society like ours we owe it

347
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:35,660
to ourselves to be aware of the impact of our words of our actions and others

348
00:29:35,660 --> 00:29:39,820
particularly these communities and populations who still experience a great

349
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:44,020
deal of discrimination kind of like how in my book burning video the Germans

350
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:50,180
would ban speech that denigrated Germany or the German Volk no this is tyrannical

351
00:29:50,180 --> 00:29:55,340
freedom of speech means the freedom to insult people period the Canadian

352
00:29:55,340 --> 00:29:59,860
military wants to establish a new organization to use propaganda and other

353
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:04,940
techniques to influence Canadians we are more specifically talking about here the

354
00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:09,620
weaponization of the military's public affairs branch the initiative involves

355
00:30:09,620 --> 00:30:13,660
the creation of new research capabilities established to analyze and

356
00:30:13,660 --> 00:30:18,100
collect information from the social media accounts of Canadians non

357
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:22,900
governmental organizations industry and the news media the Canadian Radio

358
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:27,060
Television and Telecommunications Commission is now seeking to regulate

359
00:30:27,060 --> 00:30:32,380
all content online including online videos what we're talking about is bill

360
00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:38,140
c10 and it applies to any online account that has a large enough following and is

361
00:30:38,140 --> 00:30:44,460
based in Canada despite bill c10 being deeply unpopular parliament moved to

362
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:49,260
limit debate and push the bill through thankfully the bill died in committee in

363
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:53,300
the Canadian Senate but the Trudeau government wants to control guide and

364
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:56,860
direct the content that you watch in your free time the government believes

365
00:30:56,860 --> 00:30:59,940
you're not watching the right things and so they will try to force you to do so

366
00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:04,220
thankfully at least this time they're not going to get the chance another bill

367
00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:09,500
bill c36 also currently seems to be in limbo but it would see Canada make

368
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:15,180
online hate speech a crime punishable by a $16,000 fine and just in case you want

369
00:31:15,180 --> 00:31:20,220
to know how draconian and terrible this bit of legislation is the wording of the

370
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:25,380
bill would allow for example Catherine McKenna to seek damages against the

371
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:30,860
person online who called her a climate Barbie here is part of the rationale that

372
00:31:30,860 --> 00:31:34,620
the Canadian government published for this new hate speech legislation

373
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:38,820
Canadians expect to be safe and free from hate speech and hate crimes online

374
00:31:38,820 --> 00:31:42,020
and offline well the truth is no we don't because hate speech is still free

375
00:31:42,020 --> 00:31:44,740
speech and if there's something that we don't like we can always choose not to

376
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:48,300
listen to it too many people in communities in Canada are harmed and

377
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:53,340
victimized by hate speech which is often amplified and spread online online hate

378
00:31:53,340 --> 00:31:56,620
can turn into offline hate with devastating impacts on communities and

379
00:31:56,620 --> 00:32:01,580
families sending a tweet I can't believe I have to say this sending a tweet is

380
00:32:01,580 --> 00:32:05,540
not the same classification of thing as assaulting somebody offline and

381
00:32:05,540 --> 00:32:10,580
assaulting somebody offline is already illegal hate speech is free speech

382
00:32:10,580 --> 00:32:15,460
people should be allowed to say the most objectionable things they want

383
00:32:15,460 --> 00:32:20,260
that's the point a medical journal in Canada has claimed that the Trudeau

384
00:32:20,260 --> 00:32:24,860
government has muzzled scientists this is rich because Stephen Harper the

385
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:28,640
previous Prime Minister and the leader of the Conservatives back then did the

386
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:33,580
same thing he also muzzled scientists and Trudeau lambasted him for it and

387
00:32:33,580 --> 00:32:38,480
frankly so did everyone else nobody in Canada liked that and yet Trudeau is

388
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:43,880
doing the same thing to the point that Justin Trudeau's Liberal Party has the

389
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:48,880
gall to take a speaker of the house to court to block the release of

390
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:54,400
unredacted records about those same scientists the liberal the liberal

391
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:57,960
government is taking the House of Commons a speaker to court in an

392
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:02,080
unprecedented move to prevent the release of uncensored documents to

393
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:07,000
members of Parliament that offer insight into the firing of two scientists from

394
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:10,920
Canada's top infectious disease laboratory I can't believe this has to

395
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:15,480
be said but a sitting Prime Minister does not take the speaker of the house

396
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:20,120
to court for a political reason like this and to me most telling of all is

397
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:24,980
Justin Trudeau's outright admission that what his government has learned from the

398
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:30,020
coronavirus crisis meaning the ability to centralize all power control the

399
00:33:30,020 --> 00:33:34,680
lives of the citizens lock down segments of the economy at will basically how to

400
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:39,280
be an authoritarian those aren't powers he intends to give up once coronavirus

401
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:44,520
is over but his government intends to use those powers on future problems they

402
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:51,680
face what we learnt from this climate this COVID crisis we will be applying to

403
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:57,060
the climate crisis to the housing crisis to reconciliation to making sure that

404
00:33:57,060 --> 00:34:00,920
everyone has good jobs and careers that carry them through and create

405
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:04,400
opportunities for their kids I mentioned early in the video I am pro

406
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:10,440
vax but anti lockdown and anti vaccine passport what really bothers me are the

407
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:15,000
number of people that proclaim to be liberal and yet they support these

408
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:18,720
illiberal authoritarian measures coming out of the Canadian government right now

409
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:22,840
and it's not it's not just with vaccine passports those are bad enough on their

410
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:29,240
own in 2015 Trudeau ran on electoral reform it was the thing that got him

411
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:34,080
elected and as soon as he realized that it would hurt his own chances at future

412
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:38,800
elections he abandoned it actually while I was editing the video yeah literally

413
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:43,680
at the 11th hour here it's the evening of the 18th Trudeau has actually come

414
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:48,960
out and said if he's reelected he will revisit electoral reform it is the most

415
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:54,520
popular thing he's ever run on but I have no idea why two days before people

416
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:58,680
go to vote you would remind the electorate of your most embarrassing

417
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:03,240
failure I don't get it Trudeau wants to have the power to regulate not only what

418
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:07,200
you say online but what content you consume online Trudeau wants to

419
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:12,720
confiscate by force legally owned guns from firearm owners Trudeau supports

420
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:17,640
using heavy-handed government tactics to force people to be vaccinated even if

421
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:22,520
they don't consent Trudeau refuses to end Canada's war on drugs the list goes

422
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:29,000
on all of this in addition to his use of the powers of his office to bully his

423
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:33,280
own Attorney General to bully the Speaker of the House and invade the

424
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:39,040
jurisdiction of how the House of Commons is run to blatantly lie about almost

425
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:44,000
every single thing he's ever said and yet Justin Trudeau still has the nerve

426
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:49,360
to call himself a liberal this man is not a liberal the Liberal Party under

427
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:54,600
his leadership is not liberal Trudeau is a tyrant he's always been one but he

428
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:58,360
just really needed an excuse to really come out of the closet and kovat 19 has

429
00:35:58,360 --> 00:36:03,120
given him one and I expect now that his grasp on power grows more unsteady by

430
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:07,420
the day he will become more and more tyrannical in order to keep it that is

431
00:36:07,420 --> 00:36:12,440
your personal business nobody needs to know but you the only thing I'll say is

432
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:20,040
I will never ever vote for Justin Trudeau they are putting at risk their

433
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:26,720
own kids and they're putting at risk our kids as well are putting us all at risk

434
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:32,560
trying to bring people together is not always compatible with science with

435
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:37,640
respect for human rights with the best way to move things forward I mean when

436
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:41,480
Aaron O'Toole talks about oh yes we need to unite people we need to bring people

437
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:48,760
together he's talking about defending the rights of people who are anti-vax if

438
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:54,760
anyone who doesn't have a legitimate medical reason for not getting fully

439
00:36:54,760 --> 00:37:00,400
vaccinated chooses to not get vaccinated there will be consequences
