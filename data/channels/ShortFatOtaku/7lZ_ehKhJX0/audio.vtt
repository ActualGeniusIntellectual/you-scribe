WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:10.320
Justin Trudeau called an election and you know what that means it's another SFO

00:10.320 --> 00:14.640
Trudeau video. I've done a few of these now over the course of the history of my

00:14.640 --> 00:19.120
channel and we vote in the 20th so now is as good a time as any. First of all I

00:19.120 --> 00:23.140
want to make it clear that absolutely nobody wanted this election and it's

00:23.140 --> 00:27.440
almost insane that Justin Trudeau would call it because the ball was in his

00:27.440 --> 00:30.320
court. For those of you who don't know Canada works on the British

00:30.320 --> 00:34.600
parliamentary system. The idea is if you have a majority of the seats in the

00:34.600 --> 00:39.840
House of Commons your party is locked in for five years and so when Justin Trudeau

00:39.840 --> 00:44.760
won a majority in 2015 he was locked in for five years. The next election saw him

00:44.760 --> 00:48.200
win a minority. A minority government is when you don't have enough seats to form

00:48.200 --> 00:51.920
the majority but other parties decide to prop you up in the coalition and

00:51.920 --> 00:55.840
generally a minority government topples because those other parties have

00:55.840 --> 00:59.400
withdrawn support triggering an election. Didn't happen this time though

00:59.400 --> 01:04.520
this time Trudeau just triggered one out of the blue and even now nobody seems to

01:04.520 --> 01:08.360
know why it just seems like he thinks he's really popular and he can try and

01:08.360 --> 01:12.720
get another majority. It really feels like a power grab and so far it's kind

01:12.720 --> 01:17.400
of been backfiring in his face. So a few months ago this motion went through

01:17.400 --> 01:22.200
Parliament. Now a motion is not a a legally binding document it's not a law

01:22.200 --> 01:27.080
it's just Parliament's declaration of intent and the motion reads that the

01:27.080 --> 01:30.580
House remind the government that a general election was held in October

01:30.580 --> 01:37.100
2019 and sadly note that more than 1.3 million Canadians including almost 360

01:37.100 --> 01:42.560
thousand Quebecers have been infected with COVID-19 and that nearly 25,000

01:42.560 --> 01:47.400
people have died as a result and in the opinion of the House holding an election

01:47.400 --> 01:51.480
during a pandemic would be irresponsible and that it is the responsibility of the

01:51.480 --> 01:54.680
government to make every effort to ensure that voters are not called to

01:54.680 --> 02:00.000
the polls as long as this pandemic continues. And nearly everybody agreed to

02:00.000 --> 02:07.120
this motion 320 yeses one no including all the liberals including Trudeau

02:07.120 --> 02:10.880
himself and yet just a few months later on August 19th Trudeau called his

02:10.880 --> 02:15.760
election. I can't emphasize enough how how dumb this seems to be like there was

02:15.760 --> 02:20.080
no reason to do it Trudeau's popularity was already down his opponents are

02:20.080 --> 02:23.920
actually stronger than they were in 2019 regardless of how you feel about

02:23.920 --> 02:28.480
coronavirus the population here in Canada certainly does not want to be

02:28.480 --> 02:33.880
voting during the pandemic this has been a deeply unpopular move and it has

02:33.880 --> 02:38.200
exposed Trudeau's baldness in trying to consolidate power Trudeau's public

02:38.200 --> 02:42.480
events have been marred by protesters.

02:50.080 --> 02:57.600
To stand up for people here and you know what we did it we won you guys are

02:57.600 --> 03:04.200
still able to export to the United States on privileged terms thanks to our

03:04.200 --> 03:07.560
collective success then.

03:07.560 --> 03:24.600
At one point his campaign bus was blocked in by angry people

03:37.560 --> 03:39.600
Oh

04:07.800 --> 04:12.760
At another event people threw rocks at him and by the way that's assault guys

04:12.760 --> 04:22.680
don't don't go throwing rocks at anybody all right. He has had to cancel events

04:22.680 --> 04:27.360
due to how deeply unpopular he is. Hey Trudeau remember how liberal leaders

04:27.360 --> 04:32.360
used to deal with protesters in their way? I sure do. Over the course of the

04:32.360 --> 04:36.520
campaign the Canadian polls have looked something like this the Liberals down

04:36.520 --> 04:41.040
the Conservatives up the NDP sitting in a comfortable third place as they always

04:41.040 --> 04:45.760
do a complete destruction of the Green Party and the PPC is slowly rising up

04:45.760 --> 04:49.260
however now that we're closer to the polling day the Liberals and

04:49.260 --> 04:53.340
Conservative are both neck and neck but not because the Liberals went up but the

04:53.340 --> 04:58.400
Conservatives went down instead the PPC is rising now I'm not somebody who's

04:58.400 --> 05:02.920
breathing in a shit ton of copium there is no chance the PPC forms a government

05:02.920 --> 05:06.280
they might get a seat or two here or there but at this point the race is

05:06.280 --> 05:10.800
basically neck-to-neck during a campaign stop Trudeau is asked about his own

05:10.800 --> 05:16.360
campaign violating COVID restrictions by jamming so many supporters and

05:16.360 --> 05:21.280
journalists into the same room at once and in the usual Trudeau fashion he

05:21.280 --> 05:24.720
completely dodges the question yes the videos from Rebel News and I don't like

05:24.720 --> 05:28.600
those guys either but they pulled it from CPAC this is not some kind of a

05:28.600 --> 05:30.640
trick this is the real deal check it out

05:58.600 --> 06:03.560
I'm not sure that was an answer to my question so did you get special clearance to hold an

06:03.560 --> 06:07.800
event that exceeds current crowd capacity in Ontario indoors we're going

06:07.800 --> 06:13.800
to continue to do everything we can to keep people safe we will always follow

06:13.800 --> 06:18.940
public health guidance we will follow the best recommendations of the public

06:18.940 --> 06:23.720
health experts advising our campaign and the first and most fundamental thing we

06:23.720 --> 06:27.920
do is to be able to look at Canadians and say every single one of our

06:27.920 --> 06:33.160
candidates is doing the right thing and speaking of chrono bars Trudeau was

06:33.160 --> 06:37.600
basically on the same train as Nancy Pelosi back before it hit you were a

06:37.600 --> 06:41.840
racist for worrying about it and lockdowns or other measures were just

06:41.840 --> 06:46.760
conspiracy theories how dare you even say that we do them in fact Canada was

06:46.760 --> 06:52.160
so sure of that position that Ottawa sent 16 tons of personal protective

06:52.160 --> 06:57.520
equipment to China in February of 2020 of course like everyone else a year

06:57.520 --> 07:02.400
later he had changed his tune rolling lockdowns restrictions mask mandates

07:02.400 --> 07:07.200
and now vaccines and keep in mind I'm not an anti-vaxxer I've said this many

07:07.200 --> 07:11.600
times all across the internet and I'll say it again at this point I'm pretty

07:11.600 --> 07:15.760
sure the vaccines are safe yes there are side effects there are complications the

07:15.760 --> 07:19.480
chances of you having a complication from the vaccine are lower than the

07:19.480 --> 07:22.880
chances of you having a complication from naturally catching the corona

07:22.880 --> 07:29.240
virus so generally for most people you should get the vaccine but it is 100%

07:29.240 --> 07:33.760
government overreach for them to demand that you get the vaccine for them to

07:33.760 --> 07:37.320
force you to for them to insist that you show your papers just to go outside of

07:37.320 --> 07:41.240
your house that is not a scientific conversation it's a political one and

07:41.240 --> 07:45.200
the people who are endorsing it are tyrants and just like with every other

07:45.200 --> 07:49.760
tyrant the rules don't apply to them here's January 26th 2021 Trudeau is

07:49.760 --> 07:53.960
warning about new travel restrictions coming to Canada and Canada's exposure

07:53.960 --> 07:58.480
notification app and while his official Twitter account was tweeting this he was

07:58.480 --> 08:02.640
vacationing in the Caribbean Trudeau has repeatedly lied about the status of

08:02.640 --> 08:05.960
Canadian readiness when it comes to stuff like personal protective

08:05.960 --> 08:10.880
equipment masks and hospitals and other most famously though he lied about local

08:10.880 --> 08:15.720
vaccine production he announced that it would be ready in 2021 but the company

08:15.720 --> 08:19.320
that his government enlisted soon after clarified they won't be producing

08:19.320 --> 08:24.000
doses until 2022 nonetheless Trudeau's government is demanding that all

08:24.000 --> 08:29.680
government workers get the vaccine this page dropped August 13th 2021 and

08:29.680 --> 08:34.280
actually was quickly taken down when Trudeau decided that he wanted to call

08:34.280 --> 08:38.400
an election and he realized this would be a very unpopular move so it went up

08:38.400 --> 08:41.720
and then down and it's been scrubbed from the internet and just in case I

08:41.720 --> 08:47.480
couldn't be more clear about my contempt for Justin Trudeau this explicit threat

08:47.480 --> 08:54.000
by sitting Prime Minister is disgusting and is completely 100% unacceptable in a

08:54.000 --> 09:00.280
free open and democratic society but the bottom line is if anyone who doesn't

09:00.280 --> 09:06.040
have a legitimate medical reason for not getting fully vaccinated chooses to not

09:06.040 --> 09:09.960
get vaccinated there will be consequences as I've said I'm no

09:09.960 --> 09:13.520
anti-vaxxer and the vaccines work but if this is how the government is going to

09:13.520 --> 09:17.240
behave I will play chicken with you right up until the end of course it's

09:17.240 --> 09:20.840
not just Trudeau in the Liberal Party all of Canada's left-leaning politicians

09:20.840 --> 09:25.880
want to force-vax people at some point I will need to do a video on Jagmeet Singh

09:25.880 --> 09:29.080
because at the end of the day he's a terrorist sympathizer a communist

09:29.080 --> 09:32.960
mass-murder sympathizer and a Sikh supremacist as well as the leader of

09:32.960 --> 09:39.120
Canada's NDP but for the purposes of this video he is 100% on board with

09:39.120 --> 09:43.360
fucking people who don't comply with the government we know that the vast

09:43.360 --> 09:47.200
majority Canadians want to do their part to keep people safe and want to get

09:47.200 --> 09:51.520
vaccinated and we also know that the vast majority Canadians believe in in

09:51.520 --> 09:55.880
having some way to prove that that vaccination having a vaccine passport

09:55.880 --> 09:58.840
and we know that people on the front line that are providing care or

09:58.840 --> 10:03.160
providing services directly to Canadians can pose the higher risk and should be

10:03.160 --> 10:07.480
vaccinated so we would work with unions and work with the workers on the ground

10:07.480 --> 10:11.200
to make sure we establish a way to move forward but we absolutely believe that

10:11.200 --> 10:14.360
there needs to be mandatory vaccines and there would be consequences for those

10:14.360 --> 10:18.800
who are not able to or not willing to do that thankfully the most poll he

10:18.800 --> 10:24.680
actually has is streaming jackbox on twitch where he draws Justin Trudeau

10:24.680 --> 10:30.000
losing an election to him keep dreaming buddy the coronavirus has hit everyone

10:30.000 --> 10:34.480
economically quite badly including Canada Trudeau's plans for a carbon tax

10:34.480 --> 10:39.680
increase have basically been destroyed due to the pandemic and pandemic spending

10:39.680 --> 10:43.840
just like every other Western nation has destroyed our economy Canada's current

10:43.840 --> 10:48.000
deficit level will be unsustainable within one to two years and it's been a

10:48.000 --> 10:52.280
year since this was published so we are on the verge of being fucked right now

10:52.280 --> 10:57.920
and despite the call for more taxes more taxes more taxes taxes remain the

10:57.920 --> 11:02.800
largest expense for Canadian families with the average Canadian household

11:02.800 --> 11:06.680
earning ninety six thousand three hundred and thirty three dollars and

11:06.680 --> 11:12.720
paying thirty five thousand and forty seven dollars in taxes that's thirty

11:12.720 --> 11:17.480
six point four percent of their income going to taxes compared to thirty five

11:17.480 --> 11:22.880
point four percent going to housing food and clothing combined and although I'm

11:22.880 --> 11:27.080
not necessarily a believer in grand conspiracy theories I do at the very

11:27.080 --> 11:32.240
least like to keep a pulse on them and Trudeau is absolutely 100% on board with

11:32.240 --> 11:37.000
the great reset building back better means getting support to the most

11:37.000 --> 11:41.280
vulnerable while maintaining our momentum on reaching the 2030 agenda for

11:41.280 --> 11:46.920
sustainable development and the SDGs Canada is here to listen and to help

11:46.920 --> 11:51.920
this pandemic has provided an opportunity for a reset this is our

11:51.920 --> 11:56.640
chance to accelerate our pre-pandemic efforts to reimagine economic systems

11:56.640 --> 12:01.240
that actually address global challenges like extreme poverty inequality and

12:01.480 --> 12:05.120
climate change but considering Justin Trudeau's dim-witted nature I don't

12:05.120 --> 12:09.320
actually think this is part of some kind of grand Bilderberg lizard men

12:09.320 --> 12:13.000
conspiracy theory of trying to create a one-world government I think Trudeau

12:13.000 --> 12:17.680
thinks it sounds good and appeals to his base and so he's virtue signaling

12:17.680 --> 12:22.520
because almost the entirety of Trudeau's government has been about virtue

12:22.520 --> 12:26.760
signaling this is a man who will appeal to every single issue in the book

12:26.760 --> 12:33.160
anti-semitism Islamophobia women's rights LGBTQ rights French language

12:33.160 --> 12:37.680
rights classism even fat phobia it doesn't matter he is a pure

12:37.680 --> 12:42.600
intersectionalist and so when sometimes these intersections come into conflict

12:42.600 --> 12:47.240
Trudeau is often left holding his dick this was a scandal over a year ago when

12:47.240 --> 12:53.800
Trudeau defended not publicly supporting LGBTQ rights in Senegal and taking a

12:53.800 --> 12:58.160
photo of him bowing towards an Iranian minister who is known for being quite

12:58.160 --> 13:04.080
anti LGBTQ it turns out you cannot be on the right side of every single issue

13:04.080 --> 13:06.920
because they come into conflict all the time

13:06.920 --> 13:11.080
Trudeau has given taxpayer money to support black Canadian entrepreneurs

13:11.080 --> 13:16.120
again leaning into intersectional race based bullshit surely we should just be

13:16.120 --> 13:20.640
supporting Canadian entrepreneurs regardless of their skin color a member

13:20.640 --> 13:25.800
of Trudeau's cabinet attended an arranged marriage ceremony where a young

13:25.800 --> 13:30.040
woman was auctioned to the highest bidder I guess despite the feminist

13:30.040 --> 13:35.000
leanings of Justin Trudeau selling women is okay as long as it's a beautiful

13:35.000 --> 13:39.280
native culture that's doing it meanwhile at the same time another member of

13:39.280 --> 13:44.000
Trudeau's cabinet when talking about the current Afghanistan crisis referred to

13:44.000 --> 13:50.520
the Taliban as our brothers Trudeau's government put forward bill c6 back in

13:50.520 --> 13:56.440
2017 making it so that people who immigrated to Canada became terrorists

13:56.440 --> 14:01.440
and committed terrorist attacks cannot be stripped of their citizenship and

14:01.440 --> 14:05.720
sent back by the Canadian government and just like in the United States the

14:05.720 --> 14:10.160
Canadian government has authorized the tearing down of statues related to our

14:10.160 --> 14:13.800
history but unlike the United States these aren't Confederate statues or

14:13.800 --> 14:17.720
something this is Sir John A Macdonald Canada's first prime minister this is an

14:17.720 --> 14:22.560
erasure of our history our identity our culture as Canadians by our own

14:22.560 --> 14:26.320
government I know in one of those previous Trudeau videos I don't remember

14:26.320 --> 14:32.000
which I made fun of Trudeau saying people kind not mankind well here's some

14:32.000 --> 14:38.520
more recent cringe for you enjoy it is exactly the example of the kinds of

14:38.520 --> 14:43.440
things you need to do to counter the she said the she session and turn it into a

14:43.520 --> 14:48.240
she-covery just like with every other woke oid Justin Trudeau's virtue

14:48.240 --> 14:53.240
signaling is an act designed to hide exactly how he does not live up to his

14:53.240 --> 14:57.480
own principles for example despite Trudeau's lip service on environmental

14:57.480 --> 15:01.520
issues his party has designated environmental protesters as federal

15:01.520 --> 15:05.840
security threats additionally during this election cycle the Liberals have

15:05.840 --> 15:11.040
promised to build 1.4 million new homes and ban foreign home ownership both

15:11.040 --> 15:15.560
ideas that are popular but also both that they had six years implement so far

15:15.560 --> 15:19.400
meanwhile the Liberals of Vancouver candidate a city where the housing

15:19.400 --> 15:23.880
squeeze has hit people the hardest is known for flipping dozens of homes a

15:23.880 --> 15:28.200
topic which Justin Trudeau has absolutely nothing to say about his

15:28.200 --> 15:32.760
candidate sure does though how much have you profited on those 25 in the past

15:32.760 --> 15:40.200
decade I mean I'm not you know I think it's important to talk about I'm gonna

15:40.240 --> 15:43.840
answer that question again so I don't be sure yeah how much have you profited on

15:43.840 --> 15:46.280
those sales

15:47.960 --> 15:52.720
I when you ask I'm gonna give me a second to just make sure I have the

15:52.720 --> 15:58.920
right okay so sorry ask me the question yes sir yeah yeah how much have you

15:58.920 --> 16:03.800
profited personally or business-wise on the sales of those 25 properties in the

16:03.800 --> 16:08.920
last decade while I can't give you an exact number what I can tell you is that

16:08.920 --> 16:12.680
it is by no means the number that has been bit forward but what I can also

16:12.680 --> 16:16.440
tell you is that I am absolutely committed to any and all measures that

16:16.440 --> 16:23.160
we have put forward that would that would apply I am still waiting for a

16:23.160 --> 16:27.360
number outside here if he has one a bottom line he doesn't seem to think or

16:27.360 --> 16:30.920
won't say that his past business dealings are part of this unafford

16:30.920 --> 16:35.160
unaffordability problem another of his candidates I think it's pronounced Raj

16:35.240 --> 16:41.360
Saini has been accused for six years now of multiple instances of sexual

16:41.360 --> 16:46.400
misconduct and despite those accusations despite Trudeau's feminist credentials

16:46.400 --> 16:50.520
and his glowing support of the me2 movement his party has still allowed him

16:50.520 --> 16:55.800
to run at least until another set of more recent allegations dropped and

16:55.800 --> 17:00.160
Trudeau finally asked Saini to step down not without the Liberal Party giving him

17:00.160 --> 17:05.040
$93,000 though of course there are actually more legitimate scandals

17:05.040 --> 17:08.760
surrounding Trudeau's government not just virtue signaling and hypocrisy but

17:08.760 --> 17:13.600
actually violating the law the most recent high-profile scandal revolves

17:13.600 --> 17:18.440
around the we organization which paid hundreds of thousands of dollars in

17:18.440 --> 17:24.520
speaking fees to Trudeau's wife mother and brother and completely coincidentally

17:24.520 --> 17:30.280
I'm sure later received a 900 million dollar contract with the Canadian

17:30.280 --> 17:34.800
federal government during a remote only session of Parliament because this was

17:34.800 --> 17:38.840
early in the pandemic Trudeau had to give testimony about his involvement

17:38.840 --> 17:45.200
with the we charity and it did not look good for him yes or no question mr. chair

17:45.200 --> 17:51.640
prime minister you twice were found guilty of breaking the ethics act after

17:51.640 --> 17:57.880
those two convictions did you decide to read the act you got 14 seconds prime

17:57.880 --> 18:02.480
minister yes I have read the act a number of times are you aware of section

18:02.480 --> 18:08.800
21 yes since I've read the act I'm aware of section what does it say I can pull

18:08.800 --> 18:12.080
it up for you but if you have it in front of you well it says a public

18:12.080 --> 18:15.840
office holder of which you are one shall recuse himself or herself from any

18:15.840 --> 18:21.640
discussion to decision debate or vote in any matter in which in respect of

18:21.640 --> 18:25.520
which he or she would be in a conflict of interest now what you've admitted

18:25.520 --> 18:30.560
today is not just that you were in a conflict of interest but that you

18:30.560 --> 18:35.720
consciously recognized in your May cabinet meeting that such a conflict

18:35.720 --> 18:40.640
might exist that it didn't just slide by your desk that you were consciously

18:40.640 --> 18:45.800
aware that there was a an inappropriate link to your family that would put

18:45.800 --> 18:51.760
you in a conflict why did you at that moment not call the ethics commissioner

18:51.760 --> 18:59.560
and recuse yourself that is simply not true mr. Paul yeah the issue of

18:59.560 --> 19:05.120
advancing issues for one's own and by the way the ethics commissioner is

19:05.120 --> 19:09.520
looking into this right now and I fully trust his judgment on on determining it

19:09.520 --> 19:14.040
but at the same time my concern around accusing myself was a question around

19:14.040 --> 19:19.120
perceptions because I know well that this Canada summer students grant for

19:19.120 --> 19:25.400
16 to directly benefit my mother or my brother your 16 seconds are obvious

19:25.400 --> 19:30.600
your 16 seconds are up I'm gonna ask you again because you know nobody nobody

19:30.600 --> 19:35.360
believes you when you say you don't know how much money your family has got from

19:35.360 --> 19:39.640
the wheat group you've had a month to look into that you knew you were going

19:39.640 --> 19:46.000
to testify here again how much money total have your brother mother and

19:46.000 --> 19:52.280
spouse received from this organization how much that information has been

19:52.280 --> 19:58.080
publicly shared but I will tell you what it is how much has just the dollar

19:58.080 --> 20:02.320
figure throughout her life the dollar figure prime minister this ways and is

20:02.320 --> 20:06.980
how much of the work that she's done and I'm proud of how much I'm looking for a

20:06.980 --> 20:10.700
dollar figure we can get that number for you if you like it's been in out in

20:10.700 --> 20:15.660
the media it's been in the media but you don't know it you don't know how much

20:15.660 --> 20:18.860
your family has received from this organization which you tried to give a

20:18.860 --> 20:26.620
half billion dollars really I'm waiting you haven't done an answer so far let's

20:26.620 --> 20:34.260
make this the first one my mother has worked as an advocate the dollar figure

20:34.260 --> 20:57.620
speaker good organizations across the country I do not feel that into the

20:57.620 --> 21:03.540
work my mother is doing and eventually he had to come out and

21:03.540 --> 21:09.420
apologize for not recusing himself in the we charity contract decision but

21:09.420 --> 21:13.700
this sort of government corruption where money's changing hands all the time is

21:13.700 --> 21:18.060
not something that Justin Trudeau is a stranger to everyone at this point

21:18.060 --> 21:22.820
remembers the SNC lava Lynn scandal and if you don't to be honest it's an

21:22.820 --> 21:26.900
extremely complicated topic that I've already done a deep dive into so if you

21:26.900 --> 21:30.700
want to know what's going on please go watch that video but Trudeau has been

21:30.700 --> 21:36.580
blocking the investigation into him and his party every way he can

22:00.700 --> 22:15.740
she said that she then committed to revisit and look into the decision once

22:15.740 --> 22:22.300
again mr. speaker all these are elements in the testimony examined exhaustively

22:22.300 --> 22:27.220
now the Prime Minister has caught himself in a trap of his own making he

22:27.220 --> 22:33.860
came out on February 15th and compliant said that no one had come forward to

22:33.860 --> 22:40.500
raise any concerns about his conduct and now he admits on the floor of the House

22:40.500 --> 22:46.780
of Commons that way before in September his own Attorney General asked him to

22:46.780 --> 22:49.180
his face

22:50.340 --> 22:55.820
prime minister having so much difficulty remembering his story is it because it's

22:55.820 --> 23:03.140
simply not true and Jody Wilson Raybould the person who ultimately blew the

23:03.140 --> 23:07.380
whistle on Trudeau's wrongdoing has finally been allowed to publish a book

23:07.380 --> 23:11.620
on what she knows now that the investigation is wrapping up let me read

23:11.620 --> 23:15.180
a short excerpt from the book for you I know the Prime Minister had always

23:15.180 --> 23:19.700
considered me a challenge not political enough too independent-minded and

23:19.700 --> 23:24.580
ultimately not part of the inner liberal crowd I think I was foreign and

23:24.580 --> 23:29.660
incomprehensible to him after all I was from the other side of the tracks I was

23:29.660 --> 23:34.100
an indigenous girl from a small fishing village Cape Mudge on the southern tip

23:34.100 --> 23:39.140
of Quadra Island just off Vancouver Island I am Jesus this word dude

23:39.140 --> 23:48.060
kawaka wacko okay quack wacka wacko quack wack wack all right the Prime

23:48.060 --> 23:51.660
Minister did not grow up in my neighborhoods with the kids I grew up

23:51.660 --> 23:55.420
with none of his family went to residential schools my childhood

23:55.420 --> 23:59.500
memories are closer to commox and Cape Mudge than rock cliff my political point

23:59.500 --> 24:03.460
of reference was the big house not the House of Commons to be fair he did not

24:03.460 --> 24:08.700
choose how and where he grew up or who his parents were but liberals political

24:08.700 --> 24:12.940
parties not my world there is no question in my mind that the Prime

24:12.940 --> 24:16.220
Minister knew there were attempts to pressure me to avoid a criminal

24:16.220 --> 24:21.640
prosecution of SNC lavalin and while those attempts failed thankfully they

24:21.640 --> 24:25.960
were wrong and he knew it instead of simply addressing the issue publicly and

24:25.960 --> 24:29.560
accurately the government was sending out talking heads to make comments that

24:29.560 --> 24:34.280
evidence has now shown were not accurate or right I told him that he should be

24:34.280 --> 24:38.400
telling Canadians the truth the Prime Minister seemed to be listening intently

24:38.400 --> 24:43.920
I never directed he said referring to interfering in my role as the Attorney

24:43.920 --> 24:48.840
General in relation to the SNC lavalin prosecution his public lines started

24:48.840 --> 24:52.680
coming which were designed to deny responsibility and culpability there

24:52.680 --> 24:56.440
are differences between pressure and direction he emphasized we talked about

24:56.440 --> 25:00.560
our soon-to-be infamous meeting with the clerk of the Privy Council on September

25:00.560 --> 25:06.680
17th 2018 riot asked him directly when SNC lavalin was raised are you

25:06.680 --> 25:11.760
politically interfering with my role my decision as the Attorney General I would

25:11.760 --> 25:16.280
strongly advise against it he repeated in that Airport room that I was not

25:16.320 --> 25:20.000
shuffled from being Minister of Justice and Attorney General because of SNC

25:20.000 --> 25:25.080
lavalin as he went on I suddenly blurred it out I don't want you to say anything

25:25.080 --> 25:29.520
further about what happened after September 17th to this day I'm still

25:29.520 --> 25:33.880
surprised I said it I know why I did it and why I wanted him to stop talking I

25:33.880 --> 25:38.480
was trying to leave space open for a constructive solution to the mess the PM

25:38.480 --> 25:42.800
in his office had created and that in my overly optimistic opinion could still be

25:42.800 --> 25:46.560
found either the Prime Minister knew everything that had happened and did not

25:46.560 --> 25:50.640
care and was clearly lying to me in the country or he didn't know what had been

25:50.640 --> 25:54.600
happening during the months after September 17th to try to exert pressure

25:54.600 --> 25:59.120
on me and was not in control of his office as I had in the past I gave the

25:59.120 --> 26:03.240
Prime Minister the benefit of the doubt for what would be the last time I made

26:03.240 --> 26:07.240
it very clear I did not trust the people around him and that he was being badly

26:07.240 --> 26:10.880
advised in this situation he made it equally clear to me that he would never

26:10.880 --> 26:14.760
fire some of them so I laid out the only other options that existed the

26:14.760 --> 26:18.200
Prime Minister's office stuck with its current approach of changing its story

26:18.200 --> 26:22.160
over and over again which would only make things worse in which case I would

26:22.160 --> 26:26.960
resign or he came out and came clean and we placed our trust in the truth and in

26:26.960 --> 26:31.980
Canadians I pushed the second option he said he would think about it and that we

26:31.980 --> 26:35.720
would talk again we met again on February 11th and proceeded to cover the

26:35.720 --> 26:40.200
same ground as the day before I recounted again the incidents where

26:40.200 --> 26:45.080
pressure was attempted and he again had excuses or answers for everything he

26:45.080 --> 26:49.320
repeated that he would not clean house or fire anyone and then he offered up if

26:49.320 --> 26:53.640
we did we would not be in government in October I replied I would be surprised

26:53.640 --> 26:56.880
if we were in government if you did not clean at least some of the house in some

26:56.880 --> 27:02.280
way and call some type of investigation I added after all if you're confident

27:02.280 --> 27:05.740
you did nothing wrong then why would you not want to do this this was about the

27:05.740 --> 27:09.280
maintenance of the rule of law and the fundamental tenets of our democracy

27:09.280 --> 27:14.400
surely this was worthy of our attention he again insisted no one would be fired

27:14.400 --> 27:18.800
I could see the agitation visibly building in the Prime Minister his mood

27:18.800 --> 27:22.960
was shifting I remember seeing it I remember feeling it I had seen and felt

27:22.960 --> 27:26.760
this before in a few occasions when he would get frustrated and angry but this

27:26.760 --> 27:31.200
was different he had become strident and disputed everything I had said he made

27:31.200 --> 27:34.280
it clear that everyone in his office was telling the truth and that I and by

27:34.280 --> 27:38.420
extension at Jessica Prince my chief of staff and others were not he told me I

27:38.420 --> 27:42.340
had not experienced what I said I did he used the line that would later become

27:42.340 --> 27:46.140
public that I had experienced things differently I knew what he was really

27:46.140 --> 27:52.020
asking what he was saying in that moment I knew he wanted me to lie to attest

27:52.020 --> 27:55.740
that what had occurred had not occurred for me this was just more evidence that

27:55.740 --> 28:00.940
he did not know me did not know who I was or where I was from me lie to

28:00.940 --> 28:05.820
protect a crown government acting badly a political party a leader who was not

28:05.820 --> 28:11.100
taking responsibility he must be delusional Jody Wilson-Raybould in her

28:11.100 --> 28:15.380
capacity as Attorney General attempted to see justice done in retaliation

28:15.380 --> 28:20.140
Trudeau protecting himself and others removed her from her office and the

28:20.140 --> 28:25.420
Liberal Party and in my opinion it is quite notable that despite being

28:25.420 --> 28:31.580
expelled from the party in 2019 she ran and won her seat as an independent and

28:31.580 --> 28:36.020
even though I personally do have some differences of opinion with her over

28:36.020 --> 28:40.460
other political topics I can certainly respect her for her conviction jumping

28:40.460 --> 28:45.300
off of that topic I think it's now probably important to talk about the

28:45.300 --> 28:49.460
aspects of Justin Trudeau's government that are this point just openly

28:49.460 --> 28:54.860
tyrannical we'll start with the easy one free speech has limits Canada's Trudeau

28:54.860 --> 29:00.220
says if it did then it would not be free Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau

29:00.220 --> 29:04.860
defended free speech on Friday but added that it was not without limits and

29:04.860 --> 29:09.420
should not arbitrarily and needlessly hurt certain communities we owe it to

29:09.420 --> 29:13.980
ourselves to act with respect for others and to seek not to arbitrarily or

29:13.980 --> 29:18.020
unnecessarily injure those with whom we are sharing a society and a planet we do

29:18.020 --> 29:21.700
not have the right for example to shout fire in a movie theater crowded with

29:21.700 --> 29:26.580
people there are always limits sure but what certain communities are affected by

29:26.580 --> 29:31.700
this in a pluralist diverse and respectful society like ours we owe it

29:31.700 --> 29:35.660
to ourselves to be aware of the impact of our words of our actions and others

29:35.660 --> 29:39.820
particularly these communities and populations who still experience a great

29:39.820 --> 29:44.020
deal of discrimination kind of like how in my book burning video the Germans

29:44.020 --> 29:50.180
would ban speech that denigrated Germany or the German Volk no this is tyrannical

29:50.180 --> 29:55.340
freedom of speech means the freedom to insult people period the Canadian

29:55.340 --> 29:59.860
military wants to establish a new organization to use propaganda and other

29:59.860 --> 30:04.940
techniques to influence Canadians we are more specifically talking about here the

30:04.940 --> 30:09.620
weaponization of the military's public affairs branch the initiative involves

30:09.620 --> 30:13.660
the creation of new research capabilities established to analyze and

30:13.660 --> 30:18.100
collect information from the social media accounts of Canadians non

30:18.100 --> 30:22.900
governmental organizations industry and the news media the Canadian Radio

30:22.900 --> 30:27.060
Television and Telecommunications Commission is now seeking to regulate

30:27.060 --> 30:32.380
all content online including online videos what we're talking about is bill

30:32.380 --> 30:38.140
c10 and it applies to any online account that has a large enough following and is

30:38.140 --> 30:44.460
based in Canada despite bill c10 being deeply unpopular parliament moved to

30:44.460 --> 30:49.260
limit debate and push the bill through thankfully the bill died in committee in

30:49.260 --> 30:53.300
the Canadian Senate but the Trudeau government wants to control guide and

30:53.300 --> 30:56.860
direct the content that you watch in your free time the government believes

30:56.860 --> 30:59.940
you're not watching the right things and so they will try to force you to do so

30:59.940 --> 31:04.220
thankfully at least this time they're not going to get the chance another bill

31:04.220 --> 31:09.500
bill c36 also currently seems to be in limbo but it would see Canada make

31:09.500 --> 31:15.180
online hate speech a crime punishable by a $16,000 fine and just in case you want

31:15.180 --> 31:20.220
to know how draconian and terrible this bit of legislation is the wording of the

31:20.220 --> 31:25.380
bill would allow for example Catherine McKenna to seek damages against the

31:25.380 --> 31:30.860
person online who called her a climate Barbie here is part of the rationale that

31:30.860 --> 31:34.620
the Canadian government published for this new hate speech legislation

31:34.620 --> 31:38.820
Canadians expect to be safe and free from hate speech and hate crimes online

31:38.820 --> 31:42.020
and offline well the truth is no we don't because hate speech is still free

31:42.020 --> 31:44.740
speech and if there's something that we don't like we can always choose not to

31:44.820 --> 31:48.300
listen to it too many people in communities in Canada are harmed and

31:48.300 --> 31:53.340
victimized by hate speech which is often amplified and spread online online hate

31:53.340 --> 31:56.620
can turn into offline hate with devastating impacts on communities and

31:56.620 --> 32:01.580
families sending a tweet I can't believe I have to say this sending a tweet is

32:01.580 --> 32:05.540
not the same classification of thing as assaulting somebody offline and

32:05.540 --> 32:10.580
assaulting somebody offline is already illegal hate speech is free speech

32:10.580 --> 32:15.460
people should be allowed to say the most objectionable things they want

32:15.460 --> 32:20.260
that's the point a medical journal in Canada has claimed that the Trudeau

32:20.260 --> 32:24.860
government has muzzled scientists this is rich because Stephen Harper the

32:24.860 --> 32:28.640
previous Prime Minister and the leader of the Conservatives back then did the

32:28.640 --> 32:33.580
same thing he also muzzled scientists and Trudeau lambasted him for it and

32:33.580 --> 32:38.480
frankly so did everyone else nobody in Canada liked that and yet Trudeau is

32:38.480 --> 32:43.880
doing the same thing to the point that Justin Trudeau's Liberal Party has the

32:43.880 --> 32:48.880
gall to take a speaker of the house to court to block the release of

32:48.880 --> 32:54.400
unredacted records about those same scientists the liberal the liberal

32:54.400 --> 32:57.960
government is taking the House of Commons a speaker to court in an

32:57.960 --> 33:02.080
unprecedented move to prevent the release of uncensored documents to

33:02.080 --> 33:07.000
members of Parliament that offer insight into the firing of two scientists from

33:07.000 --> 33:10.920
Canada's top infectious disease laboratory I can't believe this has to

33:10.920 --> 33:15.480
be said but a sitting Prime Minister does not take the speaker of the house

33:15.480 --> 33:20.120
to court for a political reason like this and to me most telling of all is

33:20.120 --> 33:24.980
Justin Trudeau's outright admission that what his government has learned from the

33:24.980 --> 33:30.020
coronavirus crisis meaning the ability to centralize all power control the

33:30.020 --> 33:34.680
lives of the citizens lock down segments of the economy at will basically how to

33:34.680 --> 33:39.280
be an authoritarian those aren't powers he intends to give up once coronavirus

33:39.280 --> 33:44.520
is over but his government intends to use those powers on future problems they

33:44.520 --> 33:51.680
face what we learnt from this climate this COVID crisis we will be applying to

33:51.680 --> 33:57.060
the climate crisis to the housing crisis to reconciliation to making sure that

33:57.060 --> 34:00.920
everyone has good jobs and careers that carry them through and create

34:00.920 --> 34:04.400
opportunities for their kids I mentioned early in the video I am pro

34:04.400 --> 34:10.440
vax but anti lockdown and anti vaccine passport what really bothers me are the

34:10.440 --> 34:15.000
number of people that proclaim to be liberal and yet they support these

34:15.000 --> 34:18.720
illiberal authoritarian measures coming out of the Canadian government right now

34:18.720 --> 34:22.840
and it's not it's not just with vaccine passports those are bad enough on their

34:22.840 --> 34:29.240
own in 2015 Trudeau ran on electoral reform it was the thing that got him

34:29.240 --> 34:34.080
elected and as soon as he realized that it would hurt his own chances at future

34:34.080 --> 34:38.800
elections he abandoned it actually while I was editing the video yeah literally

34:38.800 --> 34:43.680
at the 11th hour here it's the evening of the 18th Trudeau has actually come

34:43.680 --> 34:48.960
out and said if he's reelected he will revisit electoral reform it is the most

34:48.960 --> 34:54.520
popular thing he's ever run on but I have no idea why two days before people

34:54.520 --> 34:58.680
go to vote you would remind the electorate of your most embarrassing

34:58.680 --> 35:03.240
failure I don't get it Trudeau wants to have the power to regulate not only what

35:03.240 --> 35:07.200
you say online but what content you consume online Trudeau wants to

35:07.200 --> 35:12.720
confiscate by force legally owned guns from firearm owners Trudeau supports

35:12.720 --> 35:17.640
using heavy-handed government tactics to force people to be vaccinated even if

35:17.640 --> 35:22.520
they don't consent Trudeau refuses to end Canada's war on drugs the list goes

35:22.520 --> 35:29.000
on all of this in addition to his use of the powers of his office to bully his

35:29.000 --> 35:33.280
own Attorney General to bully the Speaker of the House and invade the

35:33.280 --> 35:39.040
jurisdiction of how the House of Commons is run to blatantly lie about almost

35:39.040 --> 35:44.000
every single thing he's ever said and yet Justin Trudeau still has the nerve

35:44.000 --> 35:49.360
to call himself a liberal this man is not a liberal the Liberal Party under

35:49.360 --> 35:54.600
his leadership is not liberal Trudeau is a tyrant he's always been one but he

35:54.600 --> 35:58.360
just really needed an excuse to really come out of the closet and kovat 19 has

35:58.360 --> 36:03.120
given him one and I expect now that his grasp on power grows more unsteady by

36:03.120 --> 36:07.420
the day he will become more and more tyrannical in order to keep it that is

36:07.420 --> 36:12.440
your personal business nobody needs to know but you the only thing I'll say is

36:12.440 --> 36:20.040
I will never ever vote for Justin Trudeau they are putting at risk their

36:20.040 --> 36:26.720
own kids and they're putting at risk our kids as well are putting us all at risk

36:26.720 --> 36:32.560
trying to bring people together is not always compatible with science with

36:32.560 --> 36:37.640
respect for human rights with the best way to move things forward I mean when

36:37.640 --> 36:41.480
Aaron O'Toole talks about oh yes we need to unite people we need to bring people

36:41.480 --> 36:48.760
together he's talking about defending the rights of people who are anti-vax if

36:48.760 --> 36:54.760
anyone who doesn't have a legitimate medical reason for not getting fully

36:54.760 --> 37:00.400
vaccinated chooses to not get vaccinated there will be consequences
