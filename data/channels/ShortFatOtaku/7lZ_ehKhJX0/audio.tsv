0	10320	Justin Trudeau called an election and you know what that means it's another SFO
10320	14640	Trudeau video. I've done a few of these now over the course of the history of my
14640	19120	channel and we vote in the 20th so now is as good a time as any. First of all I
19120	23140	want to make it clear that absolutely nobody wanted this election and it's
23140	27440	almost insane that Justin Trudeau would call it because the ball was in his
27440	30320	court. For those of you who don't know Canada works on the British
30320	34600	parliamentary system. The idea is if you have a majority of the seats in the
34600	39840	House of Commons your party is locked in for five years and so when Justin Trudeau
39840	44760	won a majority in 2015 he was locked in for five years. The next election saw him
44760	48200	win a minority. A minority government is when you don't have enough seats to form
48200	51920	the majority but other parties decide to prop you up in the coalition and
51920	55840	generally a minority government topples because those other parties have
55840	59400	withdrawn support triggering an election. Didn't happen this time though
59400	64520	this time Trudeau just triggered one out of the blue and even now nobody seems to
64520	68360	know why it just seems like he thinks he's really popular and he can try and
68360	72720	get another majority. It really feels like a power grab and so far it's kind
72720	77400	of been backfiring in his face. So a few months ago this motion went through
77400	82200	Parliament. Now a motion is not a a legally binding document it's not a law
82200	87080	it's just Parliament's declaration of intent and the motion reads that the
87080	90580	House remind the government that a general election was held in October
90580	97100	2019 and sadly note that more than 1.3 million Canadians including almost 360
97100	102560	thousand Quebecers have been infected with COVID-19 and that nearly 25,000
102560	107400	people have died as a result and in the opinion of the House holding an election
107400	111480	during a pandemic would be irresponsible and that it is the responsibility of the
111480	114680	government to make every effort to ensure that voters are not called to
114680	120000	the polls as long as this pandemic continues. And nearly everybody agreed to
120000	127120	this motion 320 yeses one no including all the liberals including Trudeau
127120	130880	himself and yet just a few months later on August 19th Trudeau called his
130880	135760	election. I can't emphasize enough how how dumb this seems to be like there was
135760	140080	no reason to do it Trudeau's popularity was already down his opponents are
140080	143920	actually stronger than they were in 2019 regardless of how you feel about
143920	148480	coronavirus the population here in Canada certainly does not want to be
148480	153880	voting during the pandemic this has been a deeply unpopular move and it has
153880	158200	exposed Trudeau's baldness in trying to consolidate power Trudeau's public
158200	162480	events have been marred by protesters.
170080	177600	To stand up for people here and you know what we did it we won you guys are
177600	184200	still able to export to the United States on privileged terms thanks to our
184200	187560	collective success then.
187560	204600	At one point his campaign bus was blocked in by angry people
217560	219600	Oh
247800	252760	At another event people threw rocks at him and by the way that's assault guys
252760	262680	don't don't go throwing rocks at anybody all right. He has had to cancel events
262680	267360	due to how deeply unpopular he is. Hey Trudeau remember how liberal leaders
267360	272360	used to deal with protesters in their way? I sure do. Over the course of the
272360	276520	campaign the Canadian polls have looked something like this the Liberals down
276520	281040	the Conservatives up the NDP sitting in a comfortable third place as they always
281040	285760	do a complete destruction of the Green Party and the PPC is slowly rising up
285760	289260	however now that we're closer to the polling day the Liberals and
289260	293340	Conservative are both neck and neck but not because the Liberals went up but the
293340	298400	Conservatives went down instead the PPC is rising now I'm not somebody who's
298400	302920	breathing in a shit ton of copium there is no chance the PPC forms a government
302920	306280	they might get a seat or two here or there but at this point the race is
306280	310800	basically neck-to-neck during a campaign stop Trudeau is asked about his own
310800	316360	campaign violating COVID restrictions by jamming so many supporters and
316360	321280	journalists into the same room at once and in the usual Trudeau fashion he
321280	324720	completely dodges the question yes the videos from Rebel News and I don't like
324720	328600	those guys either but they pulled it from CPAC this is not some kind of a
328600	330640	trick this is the real deal check it out
358600	363560	I'm not sure that was an answer to my question so did you get special clearance to hold an
363560	367800	event that exceeds current crowd capacity in Ontario indoors we're going
367800	373800	to continue to do everything we can to keep people safe we will always follow
373800	378940	public health guidance we will follow the best recommendations of the public
378940	383720	health experts advising our campaign and the first and most fundamental thing we
383720	387920	do is to be able to look at Canadians and say every single one of our
387920	393160	candidates is doing the right thing and speaking of chrono bars Trudeau was
393160	397600	basically on the same train as Nancy Pelosi back before it hit you were a
397600	401840	racist for worrying about it and lockdowns or other measures were just
401840	406760	conspiracy theories how dare you even say that we do them in fact Canada was
406760	412160	so sure of that position that Ottawa sent 16 tons of personal protective
412160	417520	equipment to China in February of 2020 of course like everyone else a year
417520	422400	later he had changed his tune rolling lockdowns restrictions mask mandates
422400	427200	and now vaccines and keep in mind I'm not an anti-vaxxer I've said this many
427200	431600	times all across the internet and I'll say it again at this point I'm pretty
431600	435760	sure the vaccines are safe yes there are side effects there are complications the
435760	439480	chances of you having a complication from the vaccine are lower than the
439480	442880	chances of you having a complication from naturally catching the corona
442880	449240	virus so generally for most people you should get the vaccine but it is 100%
449240	453760	government overreach for them to demand that you get the vaccine for them to
453760	457320	force you to for them to insist that you show your papers just to go outside of
457320	461240	your house that is not a scientific conversation it's a political one and
461240	465200	the people who are endorsing it are tyrants and just like with every other
465200	469760	tyrant the rules don't apply to them here's January 26th 2021 Trudeau is
469760	473960	warning about new travel restrictions coming to Canada and Canada's exposure
473960	478480	notification app and while his official Twitter account was tweeting this he was
478480	482640	vacationing in the Caribbean Trudeau has repeatedly lied about the status of
482640	485960	Canadian readiness when it comes to stuff like personal protective
485960	490880	equipment masks and hospitals and other most famously though he lied about local
490880	495720	vaccine production he announced that it would be ready in 2021 but the company
495720	499320	that his government enlisted soon after clarified they won't be producing
499320	504000	doses until 2022 nonetheless Trudeau's government is demanding that all
504000	509680	government workers get the vaccine this page dropped August 13th 2021 and
509680	514280	actually was quickly taken down when Trudeau decided that he wanted to call
514280	518400	an election and he realized this would be a very unpopular move so it went up
518400	521720	and then down and it's been scrubbed from the internet and just in case I
521720	527480	couldn't be more clear about my contempt for Justin Trudeau this explicit threat
527480	534000	by sitting Prime Minister is disgusting and is completely 100% unacceptable in a
534000	540280	free open and democratic society but the bottom line is if anyone who doesn't
540280	546040	have a legitimate medical reason for not getting fully vaccinated chooses to not
546040	549960	get vaccinated there will be consequences as I've said I'm no
549960	553520	anti-vaxxer and the vaccines work but if this is how the government is going to
553520	557240	behave I will play chicken with you right up until the end of course it's
557240	560840	not just Trudeau in the Liberal Party all of Canada's left-leaning politicians
560840	565880	want to force-vax people at some point I will need to do a video on Jagmeet Singh
565880	569080	because at the end of the day he's a terrorist sympathizer a communist
569080	572960	mass-murder sympathizer and a Sikh supremacist as well as the leader of
572960	579120	Canada's NDP but for the purposes of this video he is 100% on board with
579120	583360	fucking people who don't comply with the government we know that the vast
583360	587200	majority Canadians want to do their part to keep people safe and want to get
587200	591520	vaccinated and we also know that the vast majority Canadians believe in in
591520	595880	having some way to prove that that vaccination having a vaccine passport
595880	598840	and we know that people on the front line that are providing care or
598840	603160	providing services directly to Canadians can pose the higher risk and should be
603160	607480	vaccinated so we would work with unions and work with the workers on the ground
607480	611200	to make sure we establish a way to move forward but we absolutely believe that
611200	614360	there needs to be mandatory vaccines and there would be consequences for those
614360	618800	who are not able to or not willing to do that thankfully the most poll he
618800	624680	actually has is streaming jackbox on twitch where he draws Justin Trudeau
624680	630000	losing an election to him keep dreaming buddy the coronavirus has hit everyone
630000	634480	economically quite badly including Canada Trudeau's plans for a carbon tax
634480	639680	increase have basically been destroyed due to the pandemic and pandemic spending
639680	643840	just like every other Western nation has destroyed our economy Canada's current
643840	648000	deficit level will be unsustainable within one to two years and it's been a
648000	652280	year since this was published so we are on the verge of being fucked right now
652280	657920	and despite the call for more taxes more taxes more taxes taxes remain the
657920	662800	largest expense for Canadian families with the average Canadian household
662800	666680	earning ninety six thousand three hundred and thirty three dollars and
666680	672720	paying thirty five thousand and forty seven dollars in taxes that's thirty
672720	677480	six point four percent of their income going to taxes compared to thirty five
677480	682880	point four percent going to housing food and clothing combined and although I'm
682880	687080	not necessarily a believer in grand conspiracy theories I do at the very
687080	692240	least like to keep a pulse on them and Trudeau is absolutely 100% on board with
692240	697000	the great reset building back better means getting support to the most
697000	701280	vulnerable while maintaining our momentum on reaching the 2030 agenda for
701280	706920	sustainable development and the SDGs Canada is here to listen and to help
706920	711920	this pandemic has provided an opportunity for a reset this is our
711920	716640	chance to accelerate our pre-pandemic efforts to reimagine economic systems
716640	721240	that actually address global challenges like extreme poverty inequality and
721480	725120	climate change but considering Justin Trudeau's dim-witted nature I don't
725120	729320	actually think this is part of some kind of grand Bilderberg lizard men
729320	733000	conspiracy theory of trying to create a one-world government I think Trudeau
733000	737680	thinks it sounds good and appeals to his base and so he's virtue signaling
737680	742520	because almost the entirety of Trudeau's government has been about virtue
742520	746760	signaling this is a man who will appeal to every single issue in the book
746760	753160	anti-semitism Islamophobia women's rights LGBTQ rights French language
753160	757680	rights classism even fat phobia it doesn't matter he is a pure
757680	762600	intersectionalist and so when sometimes these intersections come into conflict
762600	767240	Trudeau is often left holding his dick this was a scandal over a year ago when
767240	773800	Trudeau defended not publicly supporting LGBTQ rights in Senegal and taking a
773800	778160	photo of him bowing towards an Iranian minister who is known for being quite
778160	784080	anti LGBTQ it turns out you cannot be on the right side of every single issue
784080	786920	because they come into conflict all the time
786920	791080	Trudeau has given taxpayer money to support black Canadian entrepreneurs
791080	796120	again leaning into intersectional race based bullshit surely we should just be
796120	800640	supporting Canadian entrepreneurs regardless of their skin color a member
800640	805800	of Trudeau's cabinet attended an arranged marriage ceremony where a young
805800	810040	woman was auctioned to the highest bidder I guess despite the feminist
810040	815000	leanings of Justin Trudeau selling women is okay as long as it's a beautiful
815000	819280	native culture that's doing it meanwhile at the same time another member of
819280	824000	Trudeau's cabinet when talking about the current Afghanistan crisis referred to
824000	830520	the Taliban as our brothers Trudeau's government put forward bill c6 back in
830520	836440	2017 making it so that people who immigrated to Canada became terrorists
836440	841440	and committed terrorist attacks cannot be stripped of their citizenship and
841440	845720	sent back by the Canadian government and just like in the United States the
845720	850160	Canadian government has authorized the tearing down of statues related to our
850160	853800	history but unlike the United States these aren't Confederate statues or
853800	857720	something this is Sir John A Macdonald Canada's first prime minister this is an
857720	862560	erasure of our history our identity our culture as Canadians by our own
862560	866320	government I know in one of those previous Trudeau videos I don't remember
866320	872000	which I made fun of Trudeau saying people kind not mankind well here's some
872000	878520	more recent cringe for you enjoy it is exactly the example of the kinds of
878520	883440	things you need to do to counter the she said the she session and turn it into a
883520	888240	she-covery just like with every other woke oid Justin Trudeau's virtue
888240	893240	signaling is an act designed to hide exactly how he does not live up to his
893240	897480	own principles for example despite Trudeau's lip service on environmental
897480	901520	issues his party has designated environmental protesters as federal
901520	905840	security threats additionally during this election cycle the Liberals have
905840	911040	promised to build 1.4 million new homes and ban foreign home ownership both
911040	915560	ideas that are popular but also both that they had six years implement so far
915560	919400	meanwhile the Liberals of Vancouver candidate a city where the housing
919400	923880	squeeze has hit people the hardest is known for flipping dozens of homes a
923880	928200	topic which Justin Trudeau has absolutely nothing to say about his
928200	932760	candidate sure does though how much have you profited on those 25 in the past
932760	940200	decade I mean I'm not you know I think it's important to talk about I'm gonna
940240	943840	answer that question again so I don't be sure yeah how much have you profited on
943840	946280	those sales
947960	952720	I when you ask I'm gonna give me a second to just make sure I have the
952720	958920	right okay so sorry ask me the question yes sir yeah yeah how much have you
958920	963800	profited personally or business-wise on the sales of those 25 properties in the
963800	968920	last decade while I can't give you an exact number what I can tell you is that
968920	972680	it is by no means the number that has been bit forward but what I can also
972680	976440	tell you is that I am absolutely committed to any and all measures that
976440	983160	we have put forward that would that would apply I am still waiting for a
983160	987360	number outside here if he has one a bottom line he doesn't seem to think or
987360	990920	won't say that his past business dealings are part of this unafford
990920	995160	unaffordability problem another of his candidates I think it's pronounced Raj
995240	1001360	Saini has been accused for six years now of multiple instances of sexual
1001360	1006400	misconduct and despite those accusations despite Trudeau's feminist credentials
1006400	1010520	and his glowing support of the me2 movement his party has still allowed him
1010520	1015800	to run at least until another set of more recent allegations dropped and
1015800	1020160	Trudeau finally asked Saini to step down not without the Liberal Party giving him
1020160	1025040	$93,000 though of course there are actually more legitimate scandals
1025040	1028760	surrounding Trudeau's government not just virtue signaling and hypocrisy but
1028760	1033600	actually violating the law the most recent high-profile scandal revolves
1033600	1038440	around the we organization which paid hundreds of thousands of dollars in
1038440	1044520	speaking fees to Trudeau's wife mother and brother and completely coincidentally
1044520	1050280	I'm sure later received a 900 million dollar contract with the Canadian
1050280	1054800	federal government during a remote only session of Parliament because this was
1054800	1058840	early in the pandemic Trudeau had to give testimony about his involvement
1058840	1065200	with the we charity and it did not look good for him yes or no question mr. chair
1065200	1071640	prime minister you twice were found guilty of breaking the ethics act after
1071640	1077880	those two convictions did you decide to read the act you got 14 seconds prime
1077880	1082480	minister yes I have read the act a number of times are you aware of section
1082480	1088800	21 yes since I've read the act I'm aware of section what does it say I can pull
1088800	1092080	it up for you but if you have it in front of you well it says a public
1092080	1095840	office holder of which you are one shall recuse himself or herself from any
1095840	1101640	discussion to decision debate or vote in any matter in which in respect of
1101640	1105520	which he or she would be in a conflict of interest now what you've admitted
1105520	1110560	today is not just that you were in a conflict of interest but that you
1110560	1115720	consciously recognized in your May cabinet meeting that such a conflict
1115720	1120640	might exist that it didn't just slide by your desk that you were consciously
1120640	1125800	aware that there was a an inappropriate link to your family that would put
1125800	1131760	you in a conflict why did you at that moment not call the ethics commissioner
1131760	1139560	and recuse yourself that is simply not true mr. Paul yeah the issue of
1139560	1145120	advancing issues for one's own and by the way the ethics commissioner is
1145120	1149520	looking into this right now and I fully trust his judgment on on determining it
1149520	1154040	but at the same time my concern around accusing myself was a question around
1154040	1159120	perceptions because I know well that this Canada summer students grant for
1159120	1165400	16 to directly benefit my mother or my brother your 16 seconds are obvious
1165400	1170600	your 16 seconds are up I'm gonna ask you again because you know nobody nobody
1170600	1175360	believes you when you say you don't know how much money your family has got from
1175360	1179640	the wheat group you've had a month to look into that you knew you were going
1179640	1186000	to testify here again how much money total have your brother mother and
1186000	1192280	spouse received from this organization how much that information has been
1192280	1198080	publicly shared but I will tell you what it is how much has just the dollar
1198080	1202320	figure throughout her life the dollar figure prime minister this ways and is
1202320	1206980	how much of the work that she's done and I'm proud of how much I'm looking for a
1206980	1210700	dollar figure we can get that number for you if you like it's been in out in
1210700	1215660	the media it's been in the media but you don't know it you don't know how much
1215660	1218860	your family has received from this organization which you tried to give a
1218860	1226620	half billion dollars really I'm waiting you haven't done an answer so far let's
1226620	1234260	make this the first one my mother has worked as an advocate the dollar figure
1234260	1257620	speaker good organizations across the country I do not feel that into the
1257620	1263540	work my mother is doing and eventually he had to come out and
1263540	1269420	apologize for not recusing himself in the we charity contract decision but
1269420	1273700	this sort of government corruption where money's changing hands all the time is
1273700	1278060	not something that Justin Trudeau is a stranger to everyone at this point
1278060	1282820	remembers the SNC lava Lynn scandal and if you don't to be honest it's an
1282820	1286900	extremely complicated topic that I've already done a deep dive into so if you
1286900	1290700	want to know what's going on please go watch that video but Trudeau has been
1290700	1296580	blocking the investigation into him and his party every way he can
1320700	1335740	she said that she then committed to revisit and look into the decision once
1335740	1342300	again mr. speaker all these are elements in the testimony examined exhaustively
1342300	1347220	now the Prime Minister has caught himself in a trap of his own making he
1347220	1353860	came out on February 15th and compliant said that no one had come forward to
1353860	1360500	raise any concerns about his conduct and now he admits on the floor of the House
1360500	1366780	of Commons that way before in September his own Attorney General asked him to
1366780	1369180	his face
1370340	1375820	prime minister having so much difficulty remembering his story is it because it's
1375820	1383140	simply not true and Jody Wilson Raybould the person who ultimately blew the
1383140	1387380	whistle on Trudeau's wrongdoing has finally been allowed to publish a book
1387380	1391620	on what she knows now that the investigation is wrapping up let me read
1391620	1395180	a short excerpt from the book for you I know the Prime Minister had always
1395180	1399700	considered me a challenge not political enough too independent-minded and
1399700	1404580	ultimately not part of the inner liberal crowd I think I was foreign and
1404580	1409660	incomprehensible to him after all I was from the other side of the tracks I was
1409660	1414100	an indigenous girl from a small fishing village Cape Mudge on the southern tip
1414100	1419140	of Quadra Island just off Vancouver Island I am Jesus this word dude
1419140	1428060	kawaka wacko okay quack wacka wacko quack wack wack all right the Prime
1428060	1431660	Minister did not grow up in my neighborhoods with the kids I grew up
1431660	1435420	with none of his family went to residential schools my childhood
1435420	1439500	memories are closer to commox and Cape Mudge than rock cliff my political point
1439500	1443460	of reference was the big house not the House of Commons to be fair he did not
1443460	1448700	choose how and where he grew up or who his parents were but liberals political
1448700	1452940	parties not my world there is no question in my mind that the Prime
1452940	1456220	Minister knew there were attempts to pressure me to avoid a criminal
1456220	1461640	prosecution of SNC lavalin and while those attempts failed thankfully they
1461640	1465960	were wrong and he knew it instead of simply addressing the issue publicly and
1465960	1469560	accurately the government was sending out talking heads to make comments that
1469560	1474280	evidence has now shown were not accurate or right I told him that he should be
1474280	1478400	telling Canadians the truth the Prime Minister seemed to be listening intently
1478400	1483920	I never directed he said referring to interfering in my role as the Attorney
1483920	1488840	General in relation to the SNC lavalin prosecution his public lines started
1488840	1492680	coming which were designed to deny responsibility and culpability there
1492680	1496440	are differences between pressure and direction he emphasized we talked about
1496440	1500560	our soon-to-be infamous meeting with the clerk of the Privy Council on September
1500560	1506680	17th 2018 riot asked him directly when SNC lavalin was raised are you
1506680	1511760	politically interfering with my role my decision as the Attorney General I would
1511760	1516280	strongly advise against it he repeated in that Airport room that I was not
1516320	1520000	shuffled from being Minister of Justice and Attorney General because of SNC
1520000	1525080	lavalin as he went on I suddenly blurred it out I don't want you to say anything
1525080	1529520	further about what happened after September 17th to this day I'm still
1529520	1533880	surprised I said it I know why I did it and why I wanted him to stop talking I
1533880	1538480	was trying to leave space open for a constructive solution to the mess the PM
1538480	1542800	in his office had created and that in my overly optimistic opinion could still be
1542800	1546560	found either the Prime Minister knew everything that had happened and did not
1546560	1550640	care and was clearly lying to me in the country or he didn't know what had been
1550640	1554600	happening during the months after September 17th to try to exert pressure
1554600	1559120	on me and was not in control of his office as I had in the past I gave the
1559120	1563240	Prime Minister the benefit of the doubt for what would be the last time I made
1563240	1567240	it very clear I did not trust the people around him and that he was being badly
1567240	1570880	advised in this situation he made it equally clear to me that he would never
1570880	1574760	fire some of them so I laid out the only other options that existed the
1574760	1578200	Prime Minister's office stuck with its current approach of changing its story
1578200	1582160	over and over again which would only make things worse in which case I would
1582160	1586960	resign or he came out and came clean and we placed our trust in the truth and in
1586960	1591980	Canadians I pushed the second option he said he would think about it and that we
1591980	1595720	would talk again we met again on February 11th and proceeded to cover the
1595720	1600200	same ground as the day before I recounted again the incidents where
1600200	1605080	pressure was attempted and he again had excuses or answers for everything he
1605080	1609320	repeated that he would not clean house or fire anyone and then he offered up if
1609320	1613640	we did we would not be in government in October I replied I would be surprised
1613640	1616880	if we were in government if you did not clean at least some of the house in some
1616880	1622280	way and call some type of investigation I added after all if you're confident
1622280	1625740	you did nothing wrong then why would you not want to do this this was about the
1625740	1629280	maintenance of the rule of law and the fundamental tenets of our democracy
1629280	1634400	surely this was worthy of our attention he again insisted no one would be fired
1634400	1638800	I could see the agitation visibly building in the Prime Minister his mood
1638800	1642960	was shifting I remember seeing it I remember feeling it I had seen and felt
1642960	1646760	this before in a few occasions when he would get frustrated and angry but this
1646760	1651200	was different he had become strident and disputed everything I had said he made
1651200	1654280	it clear that everyone in his office was telling the truth and that I and by
1654280	1658420	extension at Jessica Prince my chief of staff and others were not he told me I
1658420	1662340	had not experienced what I said I did he used the line that would later become
1662340	1666140	public that I had experienced things differently I knew what he was really
1666140	1672020	asking what he was saying in that moment I knew he wanted me to lie to attest
1672020	1675740	that what had occurred had not occurred for me this was just more evidence that
1675740	1680940	he did not know me did not know who I was or where I was from me lie to
1680940	1685820	protect a crown government acting badly a political party a leader who was not
1685820	1691100	taking responsibility he must be delusional Jody Wilson-Raybould in her
1691100	1695380	capacity as Attorney General attempted to see justice done in retaliation
1695380	1700140	Trudeau protecting himself and others removed her from her office and the
1700140	1705420	Liberal Party and in my opinion it is quite notable that despite being
1705420	1711580	expelled from the party in 2019 she ran and won her seat as an independent and
1711580	1716020	even though I personally do have some differences of opinion with her over
1716020	1720460	other political topics I can certainly respect her for her conviction jumping
1720460	1725300	off of that topic I think it's now probably important to talk about the
1725300	1729460	aspects of Justin Trudeau's government that are this point just openly
1729460	1734860	tyrannical we'll start with the easy one free speech has limits Canada's Trudeau
1734860	1740220	says if it did then it would not be free Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau
1740220	1744860	defended free speech on Friday but added that it was not without limits and
1744860	1749420	should not arbitrarily and needlessly hurt certain communities we owe it to
1749420	1753980	ourselves to act with respect for others and to seek not to arbitrarily or
1753980	1758020	unnecessarily injure those with whom we are sharing a society and a planet we do
1758020	1761700	not have the right for example to shout fire in a movie theater crowded with
1761700	1766580	people there are always limits sure but what certain communities are affected by
1766580	1771700	this in a pluralist diverse and respectful society like ours we owe it
1771700	1775660	to ourselves to be aware of the impact of our words of our actions and others
1775660	1779820	particularly these communities and populations who still experience a great
1779820	1784020	deal of discrimination kind of like how in my book burning video the Germans
1784020	1790180	would ban speech that denigrated Germany or the German Volk no this is tyrannical
1790180	1795340	freedom of speech means the freedom to insult people period the Canadian
1795340	1799860	military wants to establish a new organization to use propaganda and other
1799860	1804940	techniques to influence Canadians we are more specifically talking about here the
1804940	1809620	weaponization of the military's public affairs branch the initiative involves
1809620	1813660	the creation of new research capabilities established to analyze and
1813660	1818100	collect information from the social media accounts of Canadians non
1818100	1822900	governmental organizations industry and the news media the Canadian Radio
1822900	1827060	Television and Telecommunications Commission is now seeking to regulate
1827060	1832380	all content online including online videos what we're talking about is bill
1832380	1838140	c10 and it applies to any online account that has a large enough following and is
1838140	1844460	based in Canada despite bill c10 being deeply unpopular parliament moved to
1844460	1849260	limit debate and push the bill through thankfully the bill died in committee in
1849260	1853300	the Canadian Senate but the Trudeau government wants to control guide and
1853300	1856860	direct the content that you watch in your free time the government believes
1856860	1859940	you're not watching the right things and so they will try to force you to do so
1859940	1864220	thankfully at least this time they're not going to get the chance another bill
1864220	1869500	bill c36 also currently seems to be in limbo but it would see Canada make
1869500	1875180	online hate speech a crime punishable by a $16,000 fine and just in case you want
1875180	1880220	to know how draconian and terrible this bit of legislation is the wording of the
1880220	1885380	bill would allow for example Catherine McKenna to seek damages against the
1885380	1890860	person online who called her a climate Barbie here is part of the rationale that
1890860	1894620	the Canadian government published for this new hate speech legislation
1894620	1898820	Canadians expect to be safe and free from hate speech and hate crimes online
1898820	1902020	and offline well the truth is no we don't because hate speech is still free
1902020	1904740	speech and if there's something that we don't like we can always choose not to
1904820	1908300	listen to it too many people in communities in Canada are harmed and
1908300	1913340	victimized by hate speech which is often amplified and spread online online hate
1913340	1916620	can turn into offline hate with devastating impacts on communities and
1916620	1921580	families sending a tweet I can't believe I have to say this sending a tweet is
1921580	1925540	not the same classification of thing as assaulting somebody offline and
1925540	1930580	assaulting somebody offline is already illegal hate speech is free speech
1930580	1935460	people should be allowed to say the most objectionable things they want
1935460	1940260	that's the point a medical journal in Canada has claimed that the Trudeau
1940260	1944860	government has muzzled scientists this is rich because Stephen Harper the
1944860	1948640	previous Prime Minister and the leader of the Conservatives back then did the
1948640	1953580	same thing he also muzzled scientists and Trudeau lambasted him for it and
1953580	1958480	frankly so did everyone else nobody in Canada liked that and yet Trudeau is
1958480	1963880	doing the same thing to the point that Justin Trudeau's Liberal Party has the
1963880	1968880	gall to take a speaker of the house to court to block the release of
1968880	1974400	unredacted records about those same scientists the liberal the liberal
1974400	1977960	government is taking the House of Commons a speaker to court in an
1977960	1982080	unprecedented move to prevent the release of uncensored documents to
1982080	1987000	members of Parliament that offer insight into the firing of two scientists from
1987000	1990920	Canada's top infectious disease laboratory I can't believe this has to
1990920	1995480	be said but a sitting Prime Minister does not take the speaker of the house
1995480	2000120	to court for a political reason like this and to me most telling of all is
2000120	2004980	Justin Trudeau's outright admission that what his government has learned from the
2004980	2010020	coronavirus crisis meaning the ability to centralize all power control the
2010020	2014680	lives of the citizens lock down segments of the economy at will basically how to
2014680	2019280	be an authoritarian those aren't powers he intends to give up once coronavirus
2019280	2024520	is over but his government intends to use those powers on future problems they
2024520	2031680	face what we learnt from this climate this COVID crisis we will be applying to
2031680	2037060	the climate crisis to the housing crisis to reconciliation to making sure that
2037060	2040920	everyone has good jobs and careers that carry them through and create
2040920	2044400	opportunities for their kids I mentioned early in the video I am pro
2044400	2050440	vax but anti lockdown and anti vaccine passport what really bothers me are the
2050440	2055000	number of people that proclaim to be liberal and yet they support these
2055000	2058720	illiberal authoritarian measures coming out of the Canadian government right now
2058720	2062840	and it's not it's not just with vaccine passports those are bad enough on their
2062840	2069240	own in 2015 Trudeau ran on electoral reform it was the thing that got him
2069240	2074080	elected and as soon as he realized that it would hurt his own chances at future
2074080	2078800	elections he abandoned it actually while I was editing the video yeah literally
2078800	2083680	at the 11th hour here it's the evening of the 18th Trudeau has actually come
2083680	2088960	out and said if he's reelected he will revisit electoral reform it is the most
2088960	2094520	popular thing he's ever run on but I have no idea why two days before people
2094520	2098680	go to vote you would remind the electorate of your most embarrassing
2098680	2103240	failure I don't get it Trudeau wants to have the power to regulate not only what
2103240	2107200	you say online but what content you consume online Trudeau wants to
2107200	2112720	confiscate by force legally owned guns from firearm owners Trudeau supports
2112720	2117640	using heavy-handed government tactics to force people to be vaccinated even if
2117640	2122520	they don't consent Trudeau refuses to end Canada's war on drugs the list goes
2122520	2129000	on all of this in addition to his use of the powers of his office to bully his
2129000	2133280	own Attorney General to bully the Speaker of the House and invade the
2133280	2139040	jurisdiction of how the House of Commons is run to blatantly lie about almost
2139040	2144000	every single thing he's ever said and yet Justin Trudeau still has the nerve
2144000	2149360	to call himself a liberal this man is not a liberal the Liberal Party under
2149360	2154600	his leadership is not liberal Trudeau is a tyrant he's always been one but he
2154600	2158360	just really needed an excuse to really come out of the closet and kovat 19 has
2158360	2163120	given him one and I expect now that his grasp on power grows more unsteady by
2163120	2167420	the day he will become more and more tyrannical in order to keep it that is
2167420	2172440	your personal business nobody needs to know but you the only thing I'll say is
2172440	2180040	I will never ever vote for Justin Trudeau they are putting at risk their
2180040	2186720	own kids and they're putting at risk our kids as well are putting us all at risk
2186720	2192560	trying to bring people together is not always compatible with science with
2192560	2197640	respect for human rights with the best way to move things forward I mean when
2197640	2201480	Aaron O'Toole talks about oh yes we need to unite people we need to bring people
2201480	2208760	together he's talking about defending the rights of people who are anti-vax if
2208760	2214760	anyone who doesn't have a legitimate medical reason for not getting fully
2214760	2220400	vaccinated chooses to not get vaccinated there will be consequences
