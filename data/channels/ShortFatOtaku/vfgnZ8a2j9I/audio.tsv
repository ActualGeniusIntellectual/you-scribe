0	10640	Oh boy, it's time for the MrBeast discourse, because I don't value my remaining brain
10640	12320	cells enough apparently.
12320	18720	On January 28th, 2023, MrBeast, a YouTuber with 131 million subs, in case you don't
18720	24240	know who he is, put out this video, 1000 Blind People See For The First Time, and this video
24240	26120	is exactly what the title describes.
26120	31200	MrBeast found 1000 blind people with a specific type of blindness that can be cured by extracting
31200	34840	the clouded natural lens of the eye and replacing it with an artificial lens.
34840	38400	The video is full of feel-good moments that you'd expect to see from this sort of thing,
38400	43020	punctuated with that highly energetic effects and editing that ZoomerHumor is known for.
43020	47560	MrBeast often blows a ton of money on his videos, sometimes by giving away exorbitant
47560	51800	prizes, sometimes by going on extravagant trips, sometimes just by taking a big pile
51800	53220	of money and destroying it.
53220	55260	But he also regularly does charity work.
55260	58700	He's helped clean the oceans, plant trees, give away tons of food.
58700	63020	In fact, he has a side channel, Beast Philanthropy, where all he does is show where the money's
63020	64020	going.
64020	67180	And with these sort of view counts, where a few million hits is considered a failure
67180	71460	on the main channel, he's absolutely got truckloads of money coming in from AdSense.
71460	75780	MrBeast has gone on record multiple times, in tons of interviews, stating that all the
75780	78980	charity work he does is his way of giving back.
78980	84520	But despite all of MrBeast's previous philanthropy, this time the curing 1,000 cases of blindness
84520	87580	video, the leftoids on Twitter decided to lash out about it.
87580	92300	Normally, Lance has enough cancerous tumors strangling his brain stem that a coherent
92300	96340	thought can't actually make it from his mind down to his fingertips and keyboard,
96340	101160	but he did finally manage to pull it off a couple days ago, going viral with this garbage
101160	102160	take.
102160	104180	People are honestly praising MrBeast yet again.
104180	106660	The guy does poverty tourism for cash.
106660	111380	If he pays a person's medical bills lottery-style without informing anyone with his platform
111380	115660	that it's fucked he needs to do that, he's just profiting off of his ability to do so.
115660	120540	What makes this take exceptionally retarded is that hours before, MrBeast did exactly
120540	121540	this.
121540	123260	I don't understand why curable blindness is a thing.
123260	124900	Why don't governments step in and help?
124900	128100	Even if you're thinking purely from a financial standpoint, it's hard to see how they don't
128100	131700	get a return on investment on taxes from people being able to work again.
131700	136900	Lance got so much backlash for his stupidity that he actually caught the eye of MrBeast,
136900	138260	who replied to him with,
138260	141220	It did raise awareness and get tons of people talking.
141220	142620	Also, what profits?
142620	147080	The average MrBeast video lost $1.5 million last year lol.
147080	150620	This was enough for Lance to delete the tweet out of embarrassment, but not enough to know
150620	151620	when to quit.
151620	155660	His video about how he's paying for medical costs should have been focused on how government
155660	157100	should be funding healthcare.
157100	161260	His episode on prison should have been about how solitary confinement is torture, not renting
161300	163420	out an old one for his friends for the lulz.
163420	167020	Wait, are you literally just mad he's not doing politics videos?
167020	170100	Basing the episode in solitary confinement or renting out an old prison to see how long
170100	172180	your friends can last in it is political.
172180	175980	And of course the conversation devolves from there, with the Normies saying it's just entertainment,
175980	178200	and the Pragues saying everything is political.
178200	180500	We know where this rabbit hole goes already.
180500	184460	Lance was the one who got burned by MrBeast directly, but he's not the only breadtuber
184460	188500	who decided that MrBeast uses his platform irresponsibly, by their standards.
188500	189940	Put on your sped helmets, kids.
189940	191940	You're gonna need them after I subject you to these clips.
219940	226260	One YouTube guy to decide to make content out of it that people who are too poor can't
226260	227820	just fucking see.
227820	229140	That's insane.
229140	234700	The lefties on Twitter, those darn lefties, were saying, yeah, but MrBeast still sucks.
234700	235700	This sucks.
235700	237580	Like, this video sucks.
237580	243140	And some people are like, how can you even pretend to be a leftie when finally a rich
243140	247860	person is living the values that you say we should have and paying for people's medical
247860	248860	care?
248860	251660	And, like, it's missing the point.
251660	258940	We're seeing people's healthcare be used as, like, clout harvest, as, like, virtue signaling,
258940	266820	as content, and he's paying for this, but he's making up 55 million views or some shit
266820	267820	in two days.
267820	271380	Yeah, I mean, he already made the money back, and more.
271380	275020	Like, this is the formula for this guy.
275020	279580	He spends a little money, and he makes it at this point, and, like, he's the philanthropist
279580	280580	YouTube guy.
280580	287340	And you see people do this type of content where they essentially exploit impoverished
287340	296020	people for content, harvesting their fucking tears and their struggle for the enrichment
296020	299300	of themselves, for pittance, in their opinion.
299300	306100	And it doesn't attack the central, like, problem.
306100	309660	Like he still participates in all of this.
309660	320980	Like, this video could be used as, like, explicit political action, and he could still do this,
320980	324900	and it would start to be better.
324900	330340	And like, I can hear, like, the liberal being like, that's not what it's about, it's, like,
330340	333580	wholesome content and stuff, and I'm like, I know.
333580	341400	And there's a fundamental problem with us viewing this interaction as a wholesome one.
341400	343060	This is disgusting.
343060	350320	There is an air of disingenuousness that hangs over MrBeast videos, where it feels as though
350320	357760	the fact that he is making profit off of showcasing the struggles of poor people, it
357760	362160	feels as though this is a rich person getting rich off of the struggles of poor people,
362160	366220	and while, yes, he is helping them, he is at the end of the day not solving the poor
366220	373380	people problem, so the concept of poor people existing will always remain a sort of necessity
373380	376280	for him to make his content and for him to make his profit.
376280	381160	And so he has a business model off of monetizing poor people, and while, yes, he is making
381160	388640	those individuals feel better, have better lives, he is still monetizing poor people,
388640	392800	and he needs there to be poor people, and thus, as he has in the past, he will continue
392800	397000	to defend capitalism, because there needs to be capitalism, well, there doesn't need
397000	400800	to be capitalism for there to be poor people, but as long as there is capitalism, then there
400800	402120	will be poor people.
402120	406560	Here's an example of a really big difference, okay?
406560	411320	The ways in which people who have wealth socially legitimize that wealth.
411320	418440	So for example, back a thousand years ago, if you were like a king or a queen or an emperor,
418440	423920	or even just a very, very wealthy merchant, there was usually a kind of imagined, often
423920	427440	divine self-justification to power that people held.
427440	433840	The idea that kings and queens were divinely chosen was kind of broadly accepted, and oftentimes
433840	437400	very wealthy people were considered to have been blessed or gifted by God.
437400	442500	As societies have become more and more concerned with the idea of social equity, you know,
442500	447500	like maybe things should be fair, maybe a little bit kind of, the idea of extreme amounts
447500	452160	of wealth being concentrated in the hands of some people while other people starve has
452160	460440	been seen as more and more of like something that has to be addressed from an optics perspective,
460440	461440	you know?
461440	465520	Nowadays, however, the idea that ultra-wealthy people have to in some way contribute to the
465520	471000	social good, that's actually a well-accepted normative idea.
471000	476160	The problem that a lot of lefties have with philanthropy, as a rule, even if the outcome
476160	486280	of that philanthropy is good, is that it is often considered to be a kind of last defense
486280	490200	mechanism for the inequities of capitalism.
490200	496560	Charity can't really like maintain that level of care over people, the state can, the state
496560	497560	is capable of this.
497560	500720	For those of you who didn't make it through, my thoughts and prayers are with you.
500720	504460	And Mr. Beast offers way more than thoughts and prayers every time he does charity work,
504460	505460	so what gives?
505460	509640	Well the reason behind all of this is kind of scattered around my previous videos.
509640	512860	One of them is literally called, why do socialists hate charity?
512860	516920	Where their position on the topic is encapsulated in the phrase, solidarity, not charity.
516920	521620	The complaint is that charity relies on the goodwill of the rich, while solidarity means
521620	524960	that all people have a right to health care, or food, or shelter, or whatever.
524960	527780	And because it's a right, the government has an obligation to provide it.
527780	530640	If the government has to tax it out of the rich, then fine, they don't want the rich
530640	531780	to exist anyway.
531780	536420	The issue ultimately is, despite the claims of the libertarian socialists to be decentralized
536420	540720	and oppose the state, the very things they advocate for place more power into the hands
540720	541720	of the state.
541720	545260	You need a centralized bureaucracy to manage any sort of redistribution.
545260	549360	This leads into a second video that I made last year, this time all about why leftists
549360	551040	hate small business owners.
551040	555060	This time, the idea is encapsulated in the famous Trotsky quote, a particle of Hitler
555060	558600	is lodged in every exasperated petty bourgeois.
558600	561720	According to socialist theory, the petty bourgeois are the class of people who work
561720	565400	the means of production, like the proletariat, but also own the means of production, like
565400	566400	the bourgeois.
566400	569920	They don't sit by doing nothing, extracting profit through right of ownership, like the
569920	571400	bourgeois, they still work.
571400	575160	But they're not wage slaves either, who must exchange their labor for pay, like the
575160	576160	proletariat.
576160	578740	In a liberal sense, these are the small shop owners.
578740	582760	And there's a lot of well documented leftist hate for them that I presented in that video.
582760	587320	The reason for that hate also basically boils down to centralized connection and control.
587320	592100	A truly socialist system is a totalitarian one, where everything is interconnected, everybody
592100	595680	is a component of the superstructure that dictates and directs all production, everything
595680	600680	is political, you might say, all within the state, and concepts like privacy or independence
600680	602080	run against this goal.
602080	606080	If you own your own business, you're a bit more unplugged from the superstructure, you're
606080	609880	a bit less reliant on the interconnectivity, and the whole thing doesn't work if people
609880	611200	can just opt out of it.
611200	615360	Both the charity thing and the self-employment thing show that the socialist true goal isn't
615360	619160	to care for the poor or to see that individuals own the means of production, no matter what
619160	620160	they might say.
620160	624720	Their aim is to encapsulate everything into one unified structure where everyone is connected,
624720	627920	everything is political, and there is no such thing as individualism.
627920	631080	Or at least, that's the aim in terms of socialist political theory.
631080	633600	But none of these socialists actually want socialism.
633600	636920	Hassan doesn't want real socialism, because then he wouldn't have been able to buy himself
636920	640760	a multi-million dollar mansion and fly out to Germany to fuck sex slaves.
640760	644800	Meanwhile, Lance's own charitable endeavors ended up funding a Palestinian terrorist
644800	647520	organization, something I covered in detail in another video.
647520	651520	And Vosch is out here complaining about MrBeast making money off his charitable work, money
651520	655120	that is required to be able to perform the next charitable work by the way, while at
655120	659560	the same time admitting that the reason he performs his own charitable work is to make
659560	663260	connections with larger content creators and grow his own brand.
663260	670100	You know, I really hope that this big livestream, the charity, the positivity, all of it, I
670100	677420	hope that it encourages some people who are on the fence about me to be more open to working
677420	679220	with me in the future.
679220	682820	Working with me, I mean, you know, speaking amicably, that would be nice I think.
682820	686180	No, these people don't want socialism, they don't want to help the poor, they just want
686180	687180	to get rich.
687180	691100	The reason they hate the rich isn't because of some sense of justice, it's simply jealousy.
691100	692100	That's it.
692100	695260	That's why they're completely fine with a socialist getting super rich within a capitalist
695260	696260	system.
696260	700660	I don't think there's anything wrong with an individual maximizing their outcomes within
700660	706340	an unethical system like capitalism, especially if they're a socialist, because it increases
706340	710140	the likelihood that they'll be able to achieve political and economic power.
710140	711140	Does that mean-
711140	717000	I would love it if we had socialists who were go-getter business majors, so when the day
717000	722800	comes or something, we have people in legitimate positions of power, as opposed to a bunch
722800	725060	of college students.
725060	726060	You hear that?
726060	730340	That's between Mr. Beast and ItWasPhilosophyTube in this example, but it can be any rich socialist,
730340	731340	really.
731340	733020	Hassan, whoever, is simply their politics.
733020	734020	That's it.
734020	737140	If you're not a socialist and you're rich, your charitable works don't matter because
737140	740140	you're a collaborator with capitalism and your existence is part of the problem.
740140	744420	If you are a socialist, you have the moral license to maximize yourself under capitalism
744420	746420	because you have the correct beliefs.
746420	749540	This is nothing more than a privilege for following the correct religion.
749540	753600	Saying OMG it's so tragic that healthcare costs money, this is an injustice, it's
753600	755720	all well and good, but that's the level one baby analysis.
755720	758840	It doesn't matter if you have a universal healthcare service or not.
758840	763320	Fact of the matter is, healthcare costs resources, it costs labor and materials, and those people
763320	764320	need to be paid.
764320	767880	You cannot simply tax the compensation from the wealthy because there's eventually a
767880	771700	breaking point where it becomes easier to simply up and fucking leave.
771700	775360	The procs like to point at the Nordic model and wonder why America can't do that, but
775360	777360	newsflash, not all countries are the same.
777360	780320	You can't behave like everyone and everything is a replaceable cog.
780320	784400	There's huge differences between America and Norway or Canada or Japan or any other
784400	785400	place.
785400	788960	Differences in productivity, in natural resources, in population, in political stability, and
788960	791320	yes in ethnicity and cohesiveness too.
791320	795080	Though that variable is way less of the equation than the dissident right likes to pretend
795080	796080	it is.
796080	799360	The point is though, eat the rich doesn't work, it's never worked, and attempts to
799360	801640	do so has always made things worse.
801640	803040	Here, let me show you what I mean.
803040	807240	Let's talk about a different MrBeast charity event, this one from three months ago.
807360	810860	MrBeast had decided to show up at a random grocery store in Greenville, North Carolina
810860	812560	and pay for everybody's groceries.
812560	816680	However, the news somehow leaked to the local population that he was going to be there.
816680	817680	And look at what happened.
817680	823680	If anybody needs to get groceries on the regular, please proceed through the line.
823680	831120	MrBeast is not coming today due to security issues, and I'm the one to get to tell y'all
831120	832120	so.
832120	833120	Oh God, get up!
834000	839000	Anybody intending on getting groceries on the regular, MrBeast is not coming today.
839000	843000	There are security issues, he can't even get you.
846000	850000	I didn't even know about this until last night, so I have no idea what's going on, they just
850000	851000	called me in.
851000	854320	You have people loading up garbage bags with the entire meat department?
854320	855880	People loading up multiple carts?
855880	860560	The purpose of MrBeast's visit was to pay for people's regular purchases, just surprise
860560	864480	them with a gift, not to let opportunists buy up a whole store.
864480	868320	After the leak, MrBeast decided to volunteer at a local soup kitchen instead, and once
868320	873080	the word got out that MrBeast was in fact not coming, everyone just abandoned all the
873080	874320	stuff at the store.
874320	878920	The store ended up having to spend a lot of labor hours putting everything back, and lost
878920	883800	a fair bit of stock due to damaged items and fresh or frozen food warming to above the
883800	885560	safe temperature for sale.
885560	889760	This is what happens when things don't actually cost the end consumer anything to
889760	890760	obtain.
890760	894840	People stock up, they waste, they take way more than they need, because it is human nature
894840	896840	to save extra for a rainy day.
896840	898880	We saw this with pandemic buying as well.
898880	902320	If the people they're buying from, and the people footing the bill, are strangers to
902320	905200	the end user, they will simply take whatever they can get.
905200	908860	Any collectivization scheme that encompasses a group of people larger than a family unit
908860	911480	will always fall prey to the free rider problem.
911480	916240	And the socialist only has two possible replies to humanity's natural tendency to stockpile
916240	918680	for later and disregard the needs of outsiders.
918680	921360	First, they socially shame them for their greed.
921360	925380	And second, when that doesn't work, and it rarely does, they must use force.
925380	929240	Their problem with MrBeast ultimately boils down to the fact that he is free to do with
929240	931140	his wealth what he likes.
931140	935120	Even if he chooses to do good with it, they believe nobody should have the choice in the
935120	936120	first place.
936120	940060	Except them, of course, after they enrich themselves by becoming communist party leader.
940060	943460	And at the end of the day, regardless of who has the correct politics, regardless of
943460	947620	what socialist theory says, regardless of all of the anger and screeching and gnashing
947620	951200	of teeth of the Twitter nobodies, MrBeast has helped 1,000 people.
951200	954540	And that's 1,000 people more than any leftist activist.
