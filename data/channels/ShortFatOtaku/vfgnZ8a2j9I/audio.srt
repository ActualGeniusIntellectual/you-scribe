1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,640
Oh boy, it's time for the MrBeast discourse, because I don't value my remaining brain

2
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:12,320
cells enough apparently.

3
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:18,720
On January 28th, 2023, MrBeast, a YouTuber with 131 million subs, in case you don't

4
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:24,240
know who he is, put out this video, 1000 Blind People See For The First Time, and this video

5
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:26,120
is exactly what the title describes.

6
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:31,200
MrBeast found 1000 blind people with a specific type of blindness that can be cured by extracting

7
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:34,840
the clouded natural lens of the eye and replacing it with an artificial lens.

8
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:38,400
The video is full of feel-good moments that you'd expect to see from this sort of thing,

9
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:43,020
punctuated with that highly energetic effects and editing that ZoomerHumor is known for.

10
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:47,560
MrBeast often blows a ton of money on his videos, sometimes by giving away exorbitant

11
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:51,800
prizes, sometimes by going on extravagant trips, sometimes just by taking a big pile

12
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:53,220
of money and destroying it.

13
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:55,260
But he also regularly does charity work.

14
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:58,700
He's helped clean the oceans, plant trees, give away tons of food.

15
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:03,020
In fact, he has a side channel, Beast Philanthropy, where all he does is show where the money's

16
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:04,020
going.

17
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:07,180
And with these sort of view counts, where a few million hits is considered a failure

18
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:11,460
on the main channel, he's absolutely got truckloads of money coming in from AdSense.

19
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:15,780
MrBeast has gone on record multiple times, in tons of interviews, stating that all the

20
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:18,980
charity work he does is his way of giving back.

21
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:24,520
But despite all of MrBeast's previous philanthropy, this time the curing 1,000 cases of blindness

22
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:27,580
video, the leftoids on Twitter decided to lash out about it.

23
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:32,300
Normally, Lance has enough cancerous tumors strangling his brain stem that a coherent

24
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:36,340
thought can't actually make it from his mind down to his fingertips and keyboard,

25
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:41,160
but he did finally manage to pull it off a couple days ago, going viral with this garbage

26
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:42,160
take.

27
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:44,180
People are honestly praising MrBeast yet again.

28
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:46,660
The guy does poverty tourism for cash.

29
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:51,380
If he pays a person's medical bills lottery-style without informing anyone with his platform

30
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:55,660
that it's fucked he needs to do that, he's just profiting off of his ability to do so.

31
00:01:55,660 --> 00:02:00,540
What makes this take exceptionally retarded is that hours before, MrBeast did exactly

32
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:01,540
this.

33
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:03,260
I don't understand why curable blindness is a thing.

34
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:04,900
Why don't governments step in and help?

35
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:08,100
Even if you're thinking purely from a financial standpoint, it's hard to see how they don't

36
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:11,700
get a return on investment on taxes from people being able to work again.

37
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:16,900
Lance got so much backlash for his stupidity that he actually caught the eye of MrBeast,

38
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:18,260
who replied to him with,

39
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:21,220
It did raise awareness and get tons of people talking.

40
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:22,620
Also, what profits?

41
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:27,080
The average MrBeast video lost $1.5 million last year lol.

42
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:30,620
This was enough for Lance to delete the tweet out of embarrassment, but not enough to know

43
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:31,620
when to quit.

44
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:35,660
His video about how he's paying for medical costs should have been focused on how government

45
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:37,100
should be funding healthcare.

46
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:41,260
His episode on prison should have been about how solitary confinement is torture, not renting

47
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:43,420
out an old one for his friends for the lulz.

48
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:47,020
Wait, are you literally just mad he's not doing politics videos?

49
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:50,100
Basing the episode in solitary confinement or renting out an old prison to see how long

50
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:52,180
your friends can last in it is political.

51
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:55,980
And of course the conversation devolves from there, with the Normies saying it's just entertainment,

52
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:58,200
and the Pragues saying everything is political.

53
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:00,500
We know where this rabbit hole goes already.

54
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:04,460
Lance was the one who got burned by MrBeast directly, but he's not the only breadtuber

55
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:08,500
who decided that MrBeast uses his platform irresponsibly, by their standards.

56
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:09,940
Put on your sped helmets, kids.

57
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:11,940
You're gonna need them after I subject you to these clips.

58
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:46,260
One YouTube guy to decide to make content out of it that people who are too poor can't

59
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:47,820
just fucking see.

60
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:49,140
That's insane.

61
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:54,700
The lefties on Twitter, those darn lefties, were saying, yeah, but MrBeast still sucks.

62
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:55,700
This sucks.

63
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:57,580
Like, this video sucks.

64
00:03:57,580 --> 00:04:03,140
And some people are like, how can you even pretend to be a leftie when finally a rich

65
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:07,860
person is living the values that you say we should have and paying for people's medical

66
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:08,860
care?

67
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:11,660
And, like, it's missing the point.

68
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:18,940
We're seeing people's healthcare be used as, like, clout harvest, as, like, virtue signaling,

69
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:26,820
as content, and he's paying for this, but he's making up 55 million views or some shit

70
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:27,820
in two days.

71
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:31,380
Yeah, I mean, he already made the money back, and more.

72
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:35,020
Like, this is the formula for this guy.

73
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:39,580
He spends a little money, and he makes it at this point, and, like, he's the philanthropist

74
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:40,580
YouTube guy.

75
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:47,340
And you see people do this type of content where they essentially exploit impoverished

76
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:56,020
people for content, harvesting their fucking tears and their struggle for the enrichment

77
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:59,300
of themselves, for pittance, in their opinion.

78
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:06,100
And it doesn't attack the central, like, problem.

79
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:09,660
Like he still participates in all of this.

80
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:20,980
Like, this video could be used as, like, explicit political action, and he could still do this,

81
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:24,900
and it would start to be better.

82
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:30,340
And like, I can hear, like, the liberal being like, that's not what it's about, it's, like,

83
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:33,580
wholesome content and stuff, and I'm like, I know.

84
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:41,400
And there's a fundamental problem with us viewing this interaction as a wholesome one.

85
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:43,060
This is disgusting.

86
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:50,320
There is an air of disingenuousness that hangs over MrBeast videos, where it feels as though

87
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:57,760
the fact that he is making profit off of showcasing the struggles of poor people, it

88
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:02,160
feels as though this is a rich person getting rich off of the struggles of poor people,

89
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:06,220
and while, yes, he is helping them, he is at the end of the day not solving the poor

90
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:13,380
people problem, so the concept of poor people existing will always remain a sort of necessity

91
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:16,280
for him to make his content and for him to make his profit.

92
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:21,160
And so he has a business model off of monetizing poor people, and while, yes, he is making

93
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:28,640
those individuals feel better, have better lives, he is still monetizing poor people,

94
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:32,800
and he needs there to be poor people, and thus, as he has in the past, he will continue

95
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:37,000
to defend capitalism, because there needs to be capitalism, well, there doesn't need

96
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,800
to be capitalism for there to be poor people, but as long as there is capitalism, then there

97
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,120
will be poor people.

98
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:46,560
Here's an example of a really big difference, okay?

99
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:51,320
The ways in which people who have wealth socially legitimize that wealth.

100
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:58,440
So for example, back a thousand years ago, if you were like a king or a queen or an emperor,

101
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:03,920
or even just a very, very wealthy merchant, there was usually a kind of imagined, often

102
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:07,440
divine self-justification to power that people held.

103
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:13,840
The idea that kings and queens were divinely chosen was kind of broadly accepted, and oftentimes

104
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:17,400
very wealthy people were considered to have been blessed or gifted by God.

105
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:22,500
As societies have become more and more concerned with the idea of social equity, you know,

106
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:27,500
like maybe things should be fair, maybe a little bit kind of, the idea of extreme amounts

107
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:32,160
of wealth being concentrated in the hands of some people while other people starve has

108
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:40,440
been seen as more and more of like something that has to be addressed from an optics perspective,

109
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:41,440
you know?

110
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:45,520
Nowadays, however, the idea that ultra-wealthy people have to in some way contribute to the

111
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:51,000
social good, that's actually a well-accepted normative idea.

112
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:56,160
The problem that a lot of lefties have with philanthropy, as a rule, even if the outcome

113
00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:06,280
of that philanthropy is good, is that it is often considered to be a kind of last defense

114
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:10,200
mechanism for the inequities of capitalism.

115
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:16,560
Charity can't really like maintain that level of care over people, the state can, the state

116
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,560
is capable of this.

117
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:20,720
For those of you who didn't make it through, my thoughts and prayers are with you.

118
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:24,460
And Mr. Beast offers way more than thoughts and prayers every time he does charity work,

119
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:25,460
so what gives?

120
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:29,640
Well the reason behind all of this is kind of scattered around my previous videos.

121
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:32,860
One of them is literally called, why do socialists hate charity?

122
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:36,920
Where their position on the topic is encapsulated in the phrase, solidarity, not charity.

123
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:41,620
The complaint is that charity relies on the goodwill of the rich, while solidarity means

124
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:44,960
that all people have a right to health care, or food, or shelter, or whatever.

125
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:47,780
And because it's a right, the government has an obligation to provide it.

126
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:50,640
If the government has to tax it out of the rich, then fine, they don't want the rich

127
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:51,780
to exist anyway.

128
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:56,420
The issue ultimately is, despite the claims of the libertarian socialists to be decentralized

129
00:08:56,420 --> 00:09:00,720
and oppose the state, the very things they advocate for place more power into the hands

130
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:01,720
of the state.

131
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:05,260
You need a centralized bureaucracy to manage any sort of redistribution.

132
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:09,360
This leads into a second video that I made last year, this time all about why leftists

133
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,040
hate small business owners.

134
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:15,060
This time, the idea is encapsulated in the famous Trotsky quote, a particle of Hitler

135
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:18,600
is lodged in every exasperated petty bourgeois.

136
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:21,720
According to socialist theory, the petty bourgeois are the class of people who work

137
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:25,400
the means of production, like the proletariat, but also own the means of production, like

138
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:26,400
the bourgeois.

139
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:29,920
They don't sit by doing nothing, extracting profit through right of ownership, like the

140
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:31,400
bourgeois, they still work.

141
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:35,160
But they're not wage slaves either, who must exchange their labor for pay, like the

142
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:36,160
proletariat.

143
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:38,740
In a liberal sense, these are the small shop owners.

144
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:42,760
And there's a lot of well documented leftist hate for them that I presented in that video.

145
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:47,320
The reason for that hate also basically boils down to centralized connection and control.

146
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:52,100
A truly socialist system is a totalitarian one, where everything is interconnected, everybody

147
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:55,680
is a component of the superstructure that dictates and directs all production, everything

148
00:09:55,680 --> 00:10:00,680
is political, you might say, all within the state, and concepts like privacy or independence

149
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:02,080
run against this goal.

150
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:06,080
If you own your own business, you're a bit more unplugged from the superstructure, you're

151
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:09,880
a bit less reliant on the interconnectivity, and the whole thing doesn't work if people

152
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:11,200
can just opt out of it.

153
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:15,360
Both the charity thing and the self-employment thing show that the socialist true goal isn't

154
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:19,160
to care for the poor or to see that individuals own the means of production, no matter what

155
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,160
they might say.

156
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:24,720
Their aim is to encapsulate everything into one unified structure where everyone is connected,

157
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:27,920
everything is political, and there is no such thing as individualism.

158
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:31,080
Or at least, that's the aim in terms of socialist political theory.

159
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:33,600
But none of these socialists actually want socialism.

160
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:36,920
Hassan doesn't want real socialism, because then he wouldn't have been able to buy himself

161
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:40,760
a multi-million dollar mansion and fly out to Germany to fuck sex slaves.

162
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:44,800
Meanwhile, Lance's own charitable endeavors ended up funding a Palestinian terrorist

163
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:47,520
organization, something I covered in detail in another video.

164
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:51,520
And Vosch is out here complaining about MrBeast making money off his charitable work, money

165
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:55,120
that is required to be able to perform the next charitable work by the way, while at

166
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:59,560
the same time admitting that the reason he performs his own charitable work is to make

167
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:03,260
connections with larger content creators and grow his own brand.

168
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:10,100
You know, I really hope that this big livestream, the charity, the positivity, all of it, I

169
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:17,420
hope that it encourages some people who are on the fence about me to be more open to working

170
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:19,220
with me in the future.

171
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:22,820
Working with me, I mean, you know, speaking amicably, that would be nice I think.

172
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:26,180
No, these people don't want socialism, they don't want to help the poor, they just want

173
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:27,180
to get rich.

174
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:31,100
The reason they hate the rich isn't because of some sense of justice, it's simply jealousy.

175
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:32,100
That's it.

176
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:35,260
That's why they're completely fine with a socialist getting super rich within a capitalist

177
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:36,260
system.

178
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:40,660
I don't think there's anything wrong with an individual maximizing their outcomes within

179
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:46,340
an unethical system like capitalism, especially if they're a socialist, because it increases

180
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:50,140
the likelihood that they'll be able to achieve political and economic power.

181
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:51,140
Does that mean-

182
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:57,000
I would love it if we had socialists who were go-getter business majors, so when the day

183
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:02,800
comes or something, we have people in legitimate positions of power, as opposed to a bunch

184
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:05,060
of college students.

185
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:06,060
You hear that?

186
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:10,340
That's between Mr. Beast and ItWasPhilosophyTube in this example, but it can be any rich socialist,

187
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:11,340
really.

188
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:13,020
Hassan, whoever, is simply their politics.

189
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:14,020
That's it.

190
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:17,140
If you're not a socialist and you're rich, your charitable works don't matter because

191
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:20,140
you're a collaborator with capitalism and your existence is part of the problem.

192
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:24,420
If you are a socialist, you have the moral license to maximize yourself under capitalism

193
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:26,420
because you have the correct beliefs.

194
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:29,540
This is nothing more than a privilege for following the correct religion.

195
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:33,600
Saying OMG it's so tragic that healthcare costs money, this is an injustice, it's

196
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,720
all well and good, but that's the level one baby analysis.

197
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:38,840
It doesn't matter if you have a universal healthcare service or not.

198
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:43,320
Fact of the matter is, healthcare costs resources, it costs labor and materials, and those people

199
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:44,320
need to be paid.

200
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:47,880
You cannot simply tax the compensation from the wealthy because there's eventually a

201
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:51,700
breaking point where it becomes easier to simply up and fucking leave.

202
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:55,360
The procs like to point at the Nordic model and wonder why America can't do that, but

203
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,360
newsflash, not all countries are the same.

204
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:00,320
You can't behave like everyone and everything is a replaceable cog.

205
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:04,400
There's huge differences between America and Norway or Canada or Japan or any other

206
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:05,400
place.

207
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:08,960
Differences in productivity, in natural resources, in population, in political stability, and

208
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:11,320
yes in ethnicity and cohesiveness too.

209
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:15,080
Though that variable is way less of the equation than the dissident right likes to pretend

210
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:16,080
it is.

211
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:19,360
The point is though, eat the rich doesn't work, it's never worked, and attempts to

212
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,640
do so has always made things worse.

213
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:23,040
Here, let me show you what I mean.

214
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:27,240
Let's talk about a different MrBeast charity event, this one from three months ago.

215
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:30,860
MrBeast had decided to show up at a random grocery store in Greenville, North Carolina

216
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:32,560
and pay for everybody's groceries.

217
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:36,680
However, the news somehow leaked to the local population that he was going to be there.

218
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:37,680
And look at what happened.

219
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:43,680
If anybody needs to get groceries on the regular, please proceed through the line.

220
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:51,120
MrBeast is not coming today due to security issues, and I'm the one to get to tell y'all

221
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,120
so.

222
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:53,120
Oh God, get up!

223
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Anybody intending on getting groceries on the regular, MrBeast is not coming today.

224
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:03,000
There are security issues, he can't even get you.

225
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,000
I didn't even know about this until last night, so I have no idea what's going on, they just

226
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
called me in.

227
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,320
You have people loading up garbage bags with the entire meat department?

228
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,880
People loading up multiple carts?

229
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:20,560
The purpose of MrBeast's visit was to pay for people's regular purchases, just surprise

230
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:24,480
them with a gift, not to let opportunists buy up a whole store.

231
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:28,320
After the leak, MrBeast decided to volunteer at a local soup kitchen instead, and once

232
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:33,080
the word got out that MrBeast was in fact not coming, everyone just abandoned all the

233
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,320
stuff at the store.

234
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:38,920
The store ended up having to spend a lot of labor hours putting everything back, and lost

235
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:43,800
a fair bit of stock due to damaged items and fresh or frozen food warming to above the

236
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,560
safe temperature for sale.

237
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:49,760
This is what happens when things don't actually cost the end consumer anything to

238
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:50,760
obtain.

239
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:54,840
People stock up, they waste, they take way more than they need, because it is human nature

240
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:56,840
to save extra for a rainy day.

241
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:58,880
We saw this with pandemic buying as well.

242
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:02,320
If the people they're buying from, and the people footing the bill, are strangers to

243
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:05,200
the end user, they will simply take whatever they can get.

244
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:08,860
Any collectivization scheme that encompasses a group of people larger than a family unit

245
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:11,480
will always fall prey to the free rider problem.

246
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:16,240
And the socialist only has two possible replies to humanity's natural tendency to stockpile

247
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:18,680
for later and disregard the needs of outsiders.

248
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:21,360
First, they socially shame them for their greed.

249
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:25,380
And second, when that doesn't work, and it rarely does, they must use force.

250
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:29,240
Their problem with MrBeast ultimately boils down to the fact that he is free to do with

251
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:31,140
his wealth what he likes.

252
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:35,120
Even if he chooses to do good with it, they believe nobody should have the choice in the

253
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,120
first place.

254
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:40,060
Except them, of course, after they enrich themselves by becoming communist party leader.

255
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:43,460
And at the end of the day, regardless of who has the correct politics, regardless of

256
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:47,620
what socialist theory says, regardless of all of the anger and screeching and gnashing

257
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:51,200
of teeth of the Twitter nobodies, MrBeast has helped 1,000 people.

258
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:54,540
And that's 1,000 people more than any leftist activist.
