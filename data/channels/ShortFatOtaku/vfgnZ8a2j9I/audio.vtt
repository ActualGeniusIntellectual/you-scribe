00:00.000 --> 00:10.640
Oh boy, it's time for the MrBeast discourse, because I don't value my remaining brain

00:10.640 --> 00:12.320
cells enough apparently.

00:12.320 --> 00:18.720
On January 28th, 2023, MrBeast, a YouTuber with 131 million subs, in case you don't

00:18.720 --> 00:24.240
know who he is, put out this video, 1000 Blind People See For The First Time, and this video

00:24.240 --> 00:26.120
is exactly what the title describes.

00:26.120 --> 00:31.200
MrBeast found 1000 blind people with a specific type of blindness that can be cured by extracting

00:31.200 --> 00:34.840
the clouded natural lens of the eye and replacing it with an artificial lens.

00:34.840 --> 00:38.400
The video is full of feel-good moments that you'd expect to see from this sort of thing,

00:38.400 --> 00:43.020
punctuated with that highly energetic effects and editing that ZoomerHumor is known for.

00:43.020 --> 00:47.560
MrBeast often blows a ton of money on his videos, sometimes by giving away exorbitant

00:47.560 --> 00:51.800
prizes, sometimes by going on extravagant trips, sometimes just by taking a big pile

00:51.800 --> 00:53.220
of money and destroying it.

00:53.220 --> 00:55.260
But he also regularly does charity work.

00:55.260 --> 00:58.700
He's helped clean the oceans, plant trees, give away tons of food.

00:58.700 --> 01:03.020
In fact, he has a side channel, Beast Philanthropy, where all he does is show where the money's

01:03.020 --> 01:04.020
going.

01:04.020 --> 01:07.180
And with these sort of view counts, where a few million hits is considered a failure

01:07.180 --> 01:11.460
on the main channel, he's absolutely got truckloads of money coming in from AdSense.

01:11.460 --> 01:15.780
MrBeast has gone on record multiple times, in tons of interviews, stating that all the

01:15.780 --> 01:18.980
charity work he does is his way of giving back.

01:18.980 --> 01:24.520
But despite all of MrBeast's previous philanthropy, this time the curing 1,000 cases of blindness

01:24.520 --> 01:27.580
video, the leftoids on Twitter decided to lash out about it.

01:27.580 --> 01:32.300
Normally, Lance has enough cancerous tumors strangling his brain stem that a coherent

01:32.300 --> 01:36.340
thought can't actually make it from his mind down to his fingertips and keyboard,

01:36.340 --> 01:41.160
but he did finally manage to pull it off a couple days ago, going viral with this garbage

01:41.160 --> 01:42.160
take.

01:42.160 --> 01:44.180
People are honestly praising MrBeast yet again.

01:44.180 --> 01:46.660
The guy does poverty tourism for cash.

01:46.660 --> 01:51.380
If he pays a person's medical bills lottery-style without informing anyone with his platform

01:51.380 --> 01:55.660
that it's fucked he needs to do that, he's just profiting off of his ability to do so.

01:55.660 --> 02:00.540
What makes this take exceptionally retarded is that hours before, MrBeast did exactly

02:00.540 --> 02:01.540
this.

02:01.540 --> 02:03.260
I don't understand why curable blindness is a thing.

02:03.260 --> 02:04.900
Why don't governments step in and help?

02:04.900 --> 02:08.100
Even if you're thinking purely from a financial standpoint, it's hard to see how they don't

02:08.100 --> 02:11.700
get a return on investment on taxes from people being able to work again.

02:11.700 --> 02:16.900
Lance got so much backlash for his stupidity that he actually caught the eye of MrBeast,

02:16.900 --> 02:18.260
who replied to him with,

02:18.260 --> 02:21.220
It did raise awareness and get tons of people talking.

02:21.220 --> 02:22.620
Also, what profits?

02:22.620 --> 02:27.080
The average MrBeast video lost $1.5 million last year lol.

02:27.080 --> 02:30.620
This was enough for Lance to delete the tweet out of embarrassment, but not enough to know

02:30.620 --> 02:31.620
when to quit.

02:31.620 --> 02:35.660
His video about how he's paying for medical costs should have been focused on how government

02:35.660 --> 02:37.100
should be funding healthcare.

02:37.100 --> 02:41.260
His episode on prison should have been about how solitary confinement is torture, not renting

02:41.300 --> 02:43.420
out an old one for his friends for the lulz.

02:43.420 --> 02:47.020
Wait, are you literally just mad he's not doing politics videos?

02:47.020 --> 02:50.100
Basing the episode in solitary confinement or renting out an old prison to see how long

02:50.100 --> 02:52.180
your friends can last in it is political.

02:52.180 --> 02:55.980
And of course the conversation devolves from there, with the Normies saying it's just entertainment,

02:55.980 --> 02:58.200
and the Pragues saying everything is political.

02:58.200 --> 03:00.500
We know where this rabbit hole goes already.

03:00.500 --> 03:04.460
Lance was the one who got burned by MrBeast directly, but he's not the only breadtuber

03:04.460 --> 03:08.500
who decided that MrBeast uses his platform irresponsibly, by their standards.

03:08.500 --> 03:09.940
Put on your sped helmets, kids.

03:09.940 --> 03:11.940
You're gonna need them after I subject you to these clips.

03:39.940 --> 03:46.260
One YouTube guy to decide to make content out of it that people who are too poor can't

03:46.260 --> 03:47.820
just fucking see.

03:47.820 --> 03:49.140
That's insane.

03:49.140 --> 03:54.700
The lefties on Twitter, those darn lefties, were saying, yeah, but MrBeast still sucks.

03:54.700 --> 03:55.700
This sucks.

03:55.700 --> 03:57.580
Like, this video sucks.

03:57.580 --> 04:03.140
And some people are like, how can you even pretend to be a leftie when finally a rich

04:03.140 --> 04:07.860
person is living the values that you say we should have and paying for people's medical

04:07.860 --> 04:08.860
care?

04:08.860 --> 04:11.660
And, like, it's missing the point.

04:11.660 --> 04:18.940
We're seeing people's healthcare be used as, like, clout harvest, as, like, virtue signaling,

04:18.940 --> 04:26.820
as content, and he's paying for this, but he's making up 55 million views or some shit

04:26.820 --> 04:27.820
in two days.

04:27.820 --> 04:31.380
Yeah, I mean, he already made the money back, and more.

04:31.380 --> 04:35.020
Like, this is the formula for this guy.

04:35.020 --> 04:39.580
He spends a little money, and he makes it at this point, and, like, he's the philanthropist

04:39.580 --> 04:40.580
YouTube guy.

04:40.580 --> 04:47.340
And you see people do this type of content where they essentially exploit impoverished

04:47.340 --> 04:56.020
people for content, harvesting their fucking tears and their struggle for the enrichment

04:56.020 --> 04:59.300
of themselves, for pittance, in their opinion.

04:59.300 --> 05:06.100
And it doesn't attack the central, like, problem.

05:06.100 --> 05:09.660
Like he still participates in all of this.

05:09.660 --> 05:20.980
Like, this video could be used as, like, explicit political action, and he could still do this,

05:20.980 --> 05:24.900
and it would start to be better.

05:24.900 --> 05:30.340
And like, I can hear, like, the liberal being like, that's not what it's about, it's, like,

05:30.340 --> 05:33.580
wholesome content and stuff, and I'm like, I know.

05:33.580 --> 05:41.400
And there's a fundamental problem with us viewing this interaction as a wholesome one.

05:41.400 --> 05:43.060
This is disgusting.

05:43.060 --> 05:50.320
There is an air of disingenuousness that hangs over MrBeast videos, where it feels as though

05:50.320 --> 05:57.760
the fact that he is making profit off of showcasing the struggles of poor people, it

05:57.760 --> 06:02.160
feels as though this is a rich person getting rich off of the struggles of poor people,

06:02.160 --> 06:06.220
and while, yes, he is helping them, he is at the end of the day not solving the poor

06:06.220 --> 06:13.380
people problem, so the concept of poor people existing will always remain a sort of necessity

06:13.380 --> 06:16.280
for him to make his content and for him to make his profit.

06:16.280 --> 06:21.160
And so he has a business model off of monetizing poor people, and while, yes, he is making

06:21.160 --> 06:28.640
those individuals feel better, have better lives, he is still monetizing poor people,

06:28.640 --> 06:32.800
and he needs there to be poor people, and thus, as he has in the past, he will continue

06:32.800 --> 06:37.000
to defend capitalism, because there needs to be capitalism, well, there doesn't need

06:37.000 --> 06:40.800
to be capitalism for there to be poor people, but as long as there is capitalism, then there

06:40.800 --> 06:42.120
will be poor people.

06:42.120 --> 06:46.560
Here's an example of a really big difference, okay?

06:46.560 --> 06:51.320
The ways in which people who have wealth socially legitimize that wealth.

06:51.320 --> 06:58.440
So for example, back a thousand years ago, if you were like a king or a queen or an emperor,

06:58.440 --> 07:03.920
or even just a very, very wealthy merchant, there was usually a kind of imagined, often

07:03.920 --> 07:07.440
divine self-justification to power that people held.

07:07.440 --> 07:13.840
The idea that kings and queens were divinely chosen was kind of broadly accepted, and oftentimes

07:13.840 --> 07:17.400
very wealthy people were considered to have been blessed or gifted by God.

07:17.400 --> 07:22.500
As societies have become more and more concerned with the idea of social equity, you know,

07:22.500 --> 07:27.500
like maybe things should be fair, maybe a little bit kind of, the idea of extreme amounts

07:27.500 --> 07:32.160
of wealth being concentrated in the hands of some people while other people starve has

07:32.160 --> 07:40.440
been seen as more and more of like something that has to be addressed from an optics perspective,

07:40.440 --> 07:41.440
you know?

07:41.440 --> 07:45.520
Nowadays, however, the idea that ultra-wealthy people have to in some way contribute to the

07:45.520 --> 07:51.000
social good, that's actually a well-accepted normative idea.

07:51.000 --> 07:56.160
The problem that a lot of lefties have with philanthropy, as a rule, even if the outcome

07:56.160 --> 08:06.280
of that philanthropy is good, is that it is often considered to be a kind of last defense

08:06.280 --> 08:10.200
mechanism for the inequities of capitalism.

08:10.200 --> 08:16.560
Charity can't really like maintain that level of care over people, the state can, the state

08:16.560 --> 08:17.560
is capable of this.

08:17.560 --> 08:20.720
For those of you who didn't make it through, my thoughts and prayers are with you.

08:20.720 --> 08:24.460
And Mr. Beast offers way more than thoughts and prayers every time he does charity work,

08:24.460 --> 08:25.460
so what gives?

08:25.460 --> 08:29.640
Well the reason behind all of this is kind of scattered around my previous videos.

08:29.640 --> 08:32.860
One of them is literally called, why do socialists hate charity?

08:32.860 --> 08:36.920
Where their position on the topic is encapsulated in the phrase, solidarity, not charity.

08:36.920 --> 08:41.620
The complaint is that charity relies on the goodwill of the rich, while solidarity means

08:41.620 --> 08:44.960
that all people have a right to health care, or food, or shelter, or whatever.

08:44.960 --> 08:47.780
And because it's a right, the government has an obligation to provide it.

08:47.780 --> 08:50.640
If the government has to tax it out of the rich, then fine, they don't want the rich

08:50.640 --> 08:51.780
to exist anyway.

08:51.780 --> 08:56.420
The issue ultimately is, despite the claims of the libertarian socialists to be decentralized

08:56.420 --> 09:00.720
and oppose the state, the very things they advocate for place more power into the hands

09:00.720 --> 09:01.720
of the state.

09:01.720 --> 09:05.260
You need a centralized bureaucracy to manage any sort of redistribution.

09:05.260 --> 09:09.360
This leads into a second video that I made last year, this time all about why leftists

09:09.360 --> 09:11.040
hate small business owners.

09:11.040 --> 09:15.060
This time, the idea is encapsulated in the famous Trotsky quote, a particle of Hitler

09:15.060 --> 09:18.600
is lodged in every exasperated petty bourgeois.

09:18.600 --> 09:21.720
According to socialist theory, the petty bourgeois are the class of people who work

09:21.720 --> 09:25.400
the means of production, like the proletariat, but also own the means of production, like

09:25.400 --> 09:26.400
the bourgeois.

09:26.400 --> 09:29.920
They don't sit by doing nothing, extracting profit through right of ownership, like the

09:29.920 --> 09:31.400
bourgeois, they still work.

09:31.400 --> 09:35.160
But they're not wage slaves either, who must exchange their labor for pay, like the

09:35.160 --> 09:36.160
proletariat.

09:36.160 --> 09:38.740
In a liberal sense, these are the small shop owners.

09:38.740 --> 09:42.760
And there's a lot of well documented leftist hate for them that I presented in that video.

09:42.760 --> 09:47.320
The reason for that hate also basically boils down to centralized connection and control.

09:47.320 --> 09:52.100
A truly socialist system is a totalitarian one, where everything is interconnected, everybody

09:52.100 --> 09:55.680
is a component of the superstructure that dictates and directs all production, everything

09:55.680 --> 10:00.680
is political, you might say, all within the state, and concepts like privacy or independence

10:00.680 --> 10:02.080
run against this goal.

10:02.080 --> 10:06.080
If you own your own business, you're a bit more unplugged from the superstructure, you're

10:06.080 --> 10:09.880
a bit less reliant on the interconnectivity, and the whole thing doesn't work if people

10:09.880 --> 10:11.200
can just opt out of it.

10:11.200 --> 10:15.360
Both the charity thing and the self-employment thing show that the socialist true goal isn't

10:15.360 --> 10:19.160
to care for the poor or to see that individuals own the means of production, no matter what

10:19.160 --> 10:20.160
they might say.

10:20.160 --> 10:24.720
Their aim is to encapsulate everything into one unified structure where everyone is connected,

10:24.720 --> 10:27.920
everything is political, and there is no such thing as individualism.

10:27.920 --> 10:31.080
Or at least, that's the aim in terms of socialist political theory.

10:31.080 --> 10:33.600
But none of these socialists actually want socialism.

10:33.600 --> 10:36.920
Hassan doesn't want real socialism, because then he wouldn't have been able to buy himself

10:36.920 --> 10:40.760
a multi-million dollar mansion and fly out to Germany to fuck sex slaves.

10:40.760 --> 10:44.800
Meanwhile, Lance's own charitable endeavors ended up funding a Palestinian terrorist

10:44.800 --> 10:47.520
organization, something I covered in detail in another video.

10:47.520 --> 10:51.520
And Vosch is out here complaining about MrBeast making money off his charitable work, money

10:51.520 --> 10:55.120
that is required to be able to perform the next charitable work by the way, while at

10:55.120 --> 10:59.560
the same time admitting that the reason he performs his own charitable work is to make

10:59.560 --> 11:03.260
connections with larger content creators and grow his own brand.

11:03.260 --> 11:10.100
You know, I really hope that this big livestream, the charity, the positivity, all of it, I

11:10.100 --> 11:17.420
hope that it encourages some people who are on the fence about me to be more open to working

11:17.420 --> 11:19.220
with me in the future.

11:19.220 --> 11:22.820
Working with me, I mean, you know, speaking amicably, that would be nice I think.

11:22.820 --> 11:26.180
No, these people don't want socialism, they don't want to help the poor, they just want

11:26.180 --> 11:27.180
to get rich.

11:27.180 --> 11:31.100
The reason they hate the rich isn't because of some sense of justice, it's simply jealousy.

11:31.100 --> 11:32.100
That's it.

11:32.100 --> 11:35.260
That's why they're completely fine with a socialist getting super rich within a capitalist

11:35.260 --> 11:36.260
system.

11:36.260 --> 11:40.660
I don't think there's anything wrong with an individual maximizing their outcomes within

11:40.660 --> 11:46.340
an unethical system like capitalism, especially if they're a socialist, because it increases

11:46.340 --> 11:50.140
the likelihood that they'll be able to achieve political and economic power.

11:50.140 --> 11:51.140
Does that mean-

11:51.140 --> 11:57.000
I would love it if we had socialists who were go-getter business majors, so when the day

11:57.000 --> 12:02.800
comes or something, we have people in legitimate positions of power, as opposed to a bunch

12:02.800 --> 12:05.060
of college students.

12:05.060 --> 12:06.060
You hear that?

12:06.060 --> 12:10.340
That's between Mr. Beast and ItWasPhilosophyTube in this example, but it can be any rich socialist,

12:10.340 --> 12:11.340
really.

12:11.340 --> 12:13.020
Hassan, whoever, is simply their politics.

12:13.020 --> 12:14.020
That's it.

12:14.020 --> 12:17.140
If you're not a socialist and you're rich, your charitable works don't matter because

12:17.140 --> 12:20.140
you're a collaborator with capitalism and your existence is part of the problem.

12:20.140 --> 12:24.420
If you are a socialist, you have the moral license to maximize yourself under capitalism

12:24.420 --> 12:26.420
because you have the correct beliefs.

12:26.420 --> 12:29.540
This is nothing more than a privilege for following the correct religion.

12:29.540 --> 12:33.600
Saying OMG it's so tragic that healthcare costs money, this is an injustice, it's

12:33.600 --> 12:35.720
all well and good, but that's the level one baby analysis.

12:35.720 --> 12:38.840
It doesn't matter if you have a universal healthcare service or not.

12:38.840 --> 12:43.320
Fact of the matter is, healthcare costs resources, it costs labor and materials, and those people

12:43.320 --> 12:44.320
need to be paid.

12:44.320 --> 12:47.880
You cannot simply tax the compensation from the wealthy because there's eventually a

12:47.880 --> 12:51.700
breaking point where it becomes easier to simply up and fucking leave.

12:51.700 --> 12:55.360
The procs like to point at the Nordic model and wonder why America can't do that, but

12:55.360 --> 12:57.360
newsflash, not all countries are the same.

12:57.360 --> 13:00.320
You can't behave like everyone and everything is a replaceable cog.

13:00.320 --> 13:04.400
There's huge differences between America and Norway or Canada or Japan or any other

13:04.400 --> 13:05.400
place.

13:05.400 --> 13:08.960
Differences in productivity, in natural resources, in population, in political stability, and

13:08.960 --> 13:11.320
yes in ethnicity and cohesiveness too.

13:11.320 --> 13:15.080
Though that variable is way less of the equation than the dissident right likes to pretend

13:15.080 --> 13:16.080
it is.

13:16.080 --> 13:19.360
The point is though, eat the rich doesn't work, it's never worked, and attempts to

13:19.360 --> 13:21.640
do so has always made things worse.

13:21.640 --> 13:23.040
Here, let me show you what I mean.

13:23.040 --> 13:27.240
Let's talk about a different MrBeast charity event, this one from three months ago.

13:27.360 --> 13:30.860
MrBeast had decided to show up at a random grocery store in Greenville, North Carolina

13:30.860 --> 13:32.560
and pay for everybody's groceries.

13:32.560 --> 13:36.680
However, the news somehow leaked to the local population that he was going to be there.

13:36.680 --> 13:37.680
And look at what happened.

13:37.680 --> 13:43.680
If anybody needs to get groceries on the regular, please proceed through the line.

13:43.680 --> 13:51.120
MrBeast is not coming today due to security issues, and I'm the one to get to tell y'all

13:51.120 --> 13:52.120
so.

13:52.120 --> 13:53.120
Oh God, get up!

13:54.000 --> 13:59.000
Anybody intending on getting groceries on the regular, MrBeast is not coming today.

13:59.000 --> 14:03.000
There are security issues, he can't even get you.

14:06.000 --> 14:10.000
I didn't even know about this until last night, so I have no idea what's going on, they just

14:10.000 --> 14:11.000
called me in.

14:11.000 --> 14:14.320
You have people loading up garbage bags with the entire meat department?

14:14.320 --> 14:15.880
People loading up multiple carts?

14:15.880 --> 14:20.560
The purpose of MrBeast's visit was to pay for people's regular purchases, just surprise

14:20.560 --> 14:24.480
them with a gift, not to let opportunists buy up a whole store.

14:24.480 --> 14:28.320
After the leak, MrBeast decided to volunteer at a local soup kitchen instead, and once

14:28.320 --> 14:33.080
the word got out that MrBeast was in fact not coming, everyone just abandoned all the

14:33.080 --> 14:34.320
stuff at the store.

14:34.320 --> 14:38.920
The store ended up having to spend a lot of labor hours putting everything back, and lost

14:38.920 --> 14:43.800
a fair bit of stock due to damaged items and fresh or frozen food warming to above the

14:43.800 --> 14:45.560
safe temperature for sale.

14:45.560 --> 14:49.760
This is what happens when things don't actually cost the end consumer anything to

14:49.760 --> 14:50.760
obtain.

14:50.760 --> 14:54.840
People stock up, they waste, they take way more than they need, because it is human nature

14:54.840 --> 14:56.840
to save extra for a rainy day.

14:56.840 --> 14:58.880
We saw this with pandemic buying as well.

14:58.880 --> 15:02.320
If the people they're buying from, and the people footing the bill, are strangers to

15:02.320 --> 15:05.200
the end user, they will simply take whatever they can get.

15:05.200 --> 15:08.860
Any collectivization scheme that encompasses a group of people larger than a family unit

15:08.860 --> 15:11.480
will always fall prey to the free rider problem.

15:11.480 --> 15:16.240
And the socialist only has two possible replies to humanity's natural tendency to stockpile

15:16.240 --> 15:18.680
for later and disregard the needs of outsiders.

15:18.680 --> 15:21.360
First, they socially shame them for their greed.

15:21.360 --> 15:25.380
And second, when that doesn't work, and it rarely does, they must use force.

15:25.380 --> 15:29.240
Their problem with MrBeast ultimately boils down to the fact that he is free to do with

15:29.240 --> 15:31.140
his wealth what he likes.

15:31.140 --> 15:35.120
Even if he chooses to do good with it, they believe nobody should have the choice in the

15:35.120 --> 15:36.120
first place.

15:36.120 --> 15:40.060
Except them, of course, after they enrich themselves by becoming communist party leader.

15:40.060 --> 15:43.460
And at the end of the day, regardless of who has the correct politics, regardless of

15:43.460 --> 15:47.620
what socialist theory says, regardless of all of the anger and screeching and gnashing

15:47.620 --> 15:51.200
of teeth of the Twitter nobodies, MrBeast has helped 1,000 people.

15:51.200 --> 15:54.540
And that's 1,000 people more than any leftist activist.
