00:00.000 --> 00:09.280
While I was making the Skullgirls video, which by the way is actually really good, and you

00:09.280 --> 00:12.800
should go watch it if you haven't already, one moment in one of the many side stories

00:12.800 --> 00:15.100
of the whole drama piqued my interest.

00:15.100 --> 00:20.500
In the Atrox Chobatsu chat logs, where he's justifying the 2023 censorship of risque content

00:20.500 --> 00:24.920
from the 2011 video game Skullgirls in order to update it to modern standards, he makes

00:24.920 --> 00:28.200
this point, 2011 was such a different time.

00:28.400 --> 00:32.080
What's being said here is that the risque content in Skullgirls, the fan service that

00:32.080 --> 00:37.680
it made its name off of, and that people generally appreciated, was acceptable in 2011, but it's

00:37.680 --> 00:40.080
no longer acceptable in 2023.

00:40.080 --> 00:43.880
I considered making this part of the Skullgirls video proper, but I realized it's actually

00:43.880 --> 00:47.100
its own thing and worthy of discussing in a wider context.

00:47.100 --> 00:51.800
This is what terminally online culture warriors call the current year phenomenon.

00:51.800 --> 00:56.800
Urban Dictionary defines it as a term often used in a derogatory manner to refer to comments

00:56.800 --> 01:02.520
and rebuttals about the current year in the actual or expected state of being for a society.

01:02.520 --> 01:04.080
It comes in two forms.

01:04.080 --> 01:08.800
The first is when asked why something is the way it is, the reply given is its current

01:08.800 --> 01:09.800
year.

01:09.800 --> 01:14.040
So the answer to the question, why is the risque content being removed from Skullgirls

01:14.040 --> 01:16.340
is because it's 2023.

01:16.340 --> 01:20.560
The second form of the argument is when asked why something is being changed, the reply

01:20.560 --> 01:23.820
is because the previous year isn't the current year.

01:23.820 --> 01:27.740
Some example, why did Skullgirls have risque content in the first place?

01:27.740 --> 01:31.460
The answer is because 2011 is not 2023.

01:31.460 --> 01:35.340
What's funny about the current year phenomenon is that the actual current year is always

01:35.340 --> 01:36.340
changing.

01:36.340 --> 01:40.180
This video is being made in 2023, but if you're watching it in, say, 2025, it's going to

01:40.180 --> 01:41.540
sound a little bit strange.

01:41.540 --> 01:43.740
To you, 2023 isn't the current year.

01:43.740 --> 01:47.860
2023 is in the past, with all of its flaws and controversies, while the current year

01:47.860 --> 01:49.260
is 2025.

01:49.260 --> 01:53.700
This is why when people mock this idea, they don't actually insert a specific year.

01:53.700 --> 01:57.820
They simply say the words current year as a way to slight the people who actually think

01:57.820 --> 01:58.820
this way.

01:58.820 --> 02:03.620
The heels versus babyface starfield controversy is a recent noteworthy example of what I'm

02:03.620 --> 02:04.620
talking about.

02:04.620 --> 02:08.900
I love nothing more than with all of that laid out in front of me.

02:08.900 --> 02:15.540
I love nothing more than to be dragged out at every fucking conceivable opportunity so

02:15.540 --> 02:17.580
you can fucking current day us.

02:17.580 --> 02:19.900
Sorry, did you want to get immersed in our world?

02:19.900 --> 02:21.780
Yeah, well, guess what?

02:21.780 --> 02:24.220
Fucking pronouns.

02:24.220 --> 02:26.740
Fucking gender ambiguity.

02:26.740 --> 02:32.980
Fucking current day Californian shit because that's all we fucking know because we're boring.

02:32.980 --> 02:36.460
We're so fucking boring.

02:36.460 --> 02:40.860
When people genuinely use this argument and time marches past the year they've set as

02:40.860 --> 02:44.560
the current year, going back and listening to it sounds very strange.

02:44.560 --> 02:49.020
The modern version of this meme started with John Oliver back in 2015, where he would regularly

02:49.020 --> 02:53.600
talk about the European migrant crisis and respond to the European right wing's criticism

02:53.600 --> 02:57.340
of migration by saying, come on, people, it's 2015.

02:57.340 --> 03:00.500
There's tons of compilations on YouTube making fun of this from back in the day.

03:03.900 --> 03:08.580
If I hear there are a lot of terrorists coming my way, I'm going to be delighted.

03:08.580 --> 03:10.100
I'm going to be delighted.

03:10.100 --> 03:11.660
I'm going to be delighted.

03:11.660 --> 03:13.180
I'm going to be delighted.

03:13.180 --> 03:14.700
I'm going to be delighted.

03:14.700 --> 03:18.300
While each story is unique, many of them are heartbreaking.

03:18.300 --> 03:21.060
Nojeen is 16 and from Kobane in Syria.

03:21.060 --> 03:26.060
And so many like her and so many like her and so many like her.

03:26.060 --> 03:30.400
Fun fact, though, the one clip that everyone uses of John Oliver saying the praise as the

03:30.400 --> 03:31.500
main meme.

03:32.500 --> 03:34.900
Yeah, that one.

03:34.900 --> 03:39.260
The context of it actually isn't John Oliver critiquing the right wing by simply naming

03:39.260 --> 03:40.260
the current year.

03:40.260 --> 03:44.180
Rather, it's from a segment where he explains that he doesn't want to care about the 2016

03:44.180 --> 03:46.500
presidential election until it's actually 2016.

04:01.500 --> 04:14.300
Presumably, this clip became the go-to for the meme because, even if it's not actually

04:14.300 --> 04:18.460
from a segment where John Oliver makes a current year argument, he does make that argument

04:18.460 --> 04:19.460
a lot.

04:19.460 --> 04:24.020
And it was the cleanest instance of him saying the words, it's 2015 from an audio perspective.

04:24.020 --> 04:28.980
John Oliver saying it's 2015 as a criticism of the right is one half of why current year

04:28.980 --> 04:30.180
became a meme.

04:30.180 --> 04:34.000
The other half is the Canadian Prime Minister, the hyper progressive Justin Trudeau, saying

04:34.000 --> 04:53.140
the same thing in the same year.

04:53.140 --> 04:57.260
Both Trudeau and Oliver approached the topic with the same progressive smugness, which

04:57.260 --> 04:59.760
is probably why mocking it became so popular.

04:59.760 --> 05:03.040
When listening to these clips in 2023, it sounds strange, doesn't it?

05:03.040 --> 05:06.760
Just like to our future viewer, it's not 2023 anymore, it's 2025.

05:06.760 --> 05:09.660
To us, it's not 2015, it's 2023.

05:09.660 --> 05:14.800
What makes 2015 so special that simply uttering its name was considered a coherent argument?

05:14.800 --> 05:17.700
Remember earlier I said the current year argument takes two forms.

05:17.700 --> 05:21.580
The first is to justify the current state of affairs by saying it's the current year.

05:21.580 --> 05:26.440
The second is to justify a change by saying the previous year's standard was problematic.

05:26.440 --> 05:31.000
But it's not hard to find examples of a year being considered both problematic and modern,

05:31.000 --> 05:33.600
and once you do that, everything starts to fall apart.

05:33.600 --> 05:36.800
Here's an article from a month ago, where the voice actress for Quiet from Metal Gear

05:36.800 --> 05:42.480
Solid 5, Stephanie Joosten, voices her disapproval for Quiet's revealing attire during the game.

05:42.480 --> 05:47.400
She specifically said, This game came out in 2015, and I think the video game landscape

05:47.400 --> 05:49.600
has changed quite a lot since then.

05:49.600 --> 05:51.760
People are looking for more representation, and I really get it.

05:51.760 --> 05:55.320
For those of you who don't know, from the initial reveal of Quiet during I think an

05:55.320 --> 06:01.000
E3 2013 presentation, up until the game's launch in 2015, feminists online were blasting

06:01.000 --> 06:04.540
her character design for being objectifying and degrading towards women.

06:04.540 --> 06:07.920
The few religious boomers who were still talking about video games agreed with them in their

06:07.920 --> 06:10.120
own way, saying they were corrupting the youth.

06:10.120 --> 06:15.840
Meanwhile, it was a coalition of normal, unaligned gamers, smug fedora-tipping reddit liberals,

06:15.840 --> 06:20.560
and the few sex-positive feminists that existed back then coming together to say no, it's

06:20.560 --> 06:24.740
actually fine to have an attractive woman with her tits out, stop acting like a puritan.

06:24.740 --> 06:29.080
But with regards to her portrayal of Quiet, Joosten is using a current year argument.

06:29.080 --> 06:33.680
Metal Gear Solid 5 came out in 2015, it's now 2023, standards have changed in the past

06:33.680 --> 06:34.680
seven years.

06:34.680 --> 06:38.480
What was good is now bad, including, by the way, her initial defense of it.

06:38.480 --> 06:42.900
Joosten gave an interview in April of 2015 on Yongye's channel, never thought I'd say

06:42.900 --> 06:46.800
his name again, where she says that she's not bothered by Quiet's outfit.

06:46.800 --> 06:52.980
A lot of people took notice of Quiet's attire, or lack thereof, some would say.

06:52.980 --> 07:00.520
Were you nervous about the character, how she would be received as a result of what

07:00.520 --> 07:05.560
she's wearing, and what kind of feedback did you get after Quiet was unveiled?

07:05.560 --> 07:16.460
Um, well, I was really expecting there to be this kind of reaction there was, for lots

07:16.460 --> 07:17.460
of controversy.

07:17.460 --> 07:28.980
Because of course, when I got to see her dying at first, I was shocked too, because especially

07:28.980 --> 07:35.020
since everybody didn't get to hear her story yet.

07:35.020 --> 07:45.280
I can understand people are angry about it, or saying it's shown too much, but I'm not

07:45.280 --> 07:46.280
bothered by it.

07:46.280 --> 07:47.560
Here's what's so funny to me.

07:47.560 --> 07:52.280
If we're to listen to say, John Oliver or Justin Trudeau, 2015 was an era of progressive

07:52.280 --> 07:53.280
morality.

07:53.280 --> 07:57.840
They were making explicitly progressive proclamations, and justifying them by simply saying, it's

07:57.840 --> 07:58.840
2015.

07:58.840 --> 08:00.440
Of course this is what we're doing.

08:00.440 --> 08:05.060
In that context, suddenly seeing 2015 uses an exclamation of a past era where things

08:05.060 --> 08:08.880
were not progressive, in fact they were the regressive dark ages that we've thankfully

08:08.880 --> 08:12.640
moved past, the cognitive dissonance starts to come into focus.

08:12.640 --> 08:14.740
Here's another example going back even further.

08:14.740 --> 08:17.740
I used this on a weekly sip a few months ago, but I think it actually works better than

08:17.740 --> 08:18.860
the Quiet example.

08:18.860 --> 08:24.420
Eddie Murphy's two blowout stand-up comedy specials of the 1980s, Delirious in 1983,

08:24.420 --> 08:29.740
and Raw in 1987, contained tons of homophobic slurs and remarks, stereotypes about gay people's

08:29.740 --> 08:32.880
sexual practices, stereotypes about AIDS, it was fucking brutal.

08:32.880 --> 08:36.700
But they were also hilarious, and they're considered some of the best stand-up comedy

08:36.700 --> 08:38.220
sets of all time.

08:38.220 --> 08:44.920
In 1996, the San Francisco news website SFGate, yes Zoomers, the internet existed in 1996,

08:44.920 --> 08:50.020
published an article titled, After 15 Years, Actor Apologizes for Gay Slurs.

08:50.020 --> 08:53.320
Gay activists at the time were demanding that Eddie Murphy's appearance in The Late Show

08:53.320 --> 08:57.640
with David Letterman be cancelled because of his homophobic remarks from a decade ago.

08:57.640 --> 09:01.440
In response, Murphy released a public statement saying, Just like the rest of the world, I

09:01.440 --> 09:05.660
am more educated about AIDS in 1996 than I was in 1981.

09:05.660 --> 09:09.560
I think it's unfair to take the words of a misinformed 21-year-old and apply them to

09:09.560 --> 09:11.680
an informed 35-year-old man.

09:11.680 --> 09:14.560
I know how serious an issue AIDS is the world over.

09:14.560 --> 09:16.180
I know AIDS isn't funny.

09:16.180 --> 09:19.320
It's 1996, and I'm a lot smarter about AIDS now.

09:19.320 --> 09:21.040
This is a current year argument.

09:21.040 --> 09:26.320
Only now, the current year in question, the peak of modern progressive morality is 1996,

09:26.320 --> 09:28.820
and the regressive dark ages is 1981.

09:28.820 --> 09:34.280
Do you think that progressives nowadays believe 1996 was a peak of modern progressive morality?

09:34.280 --> 09:35.280
We all know they don't.

09:35.280 --> 09:38.680
They go to great lengths to talk about how the 90s sucked and was full of bigotry every

09:38.680 --> 09:39.680
chance they get.

09:39.680 --> 09:45.520
Kind of like how Oliver and Trudeau and Justin were pro-2015 until 2015 became the past,

09:45.520 --> 09:46.520
now they're anti-2015.

09:46.520 --> 09:52.300
Oh, also, unlike modern progressive activists, back in 1996, activists actually accepted

09:52.300 --> 09:53.840
Murphy's apology.

09:53.840 --> 09:57.480
Progressive activists nowadays tend to just want people to be cancelled forever, and in

09:57.480 --> 10:01.980
fact, modern progressives still occasionally dredge this shit back up to demand Eddie Murphy

10:01.980 --> 10:03.720
be cancelled yet again.

10:03.720 --> 10:04.720
So what's going on here?

10:04.720 --> 10:09.040
There's two separate things, the logic of the current year argument and the people employing

10:09.040 --> 10:10.120
the current year argument.

10:10.120 --> 10:12.180
Let's start with the logic first.

10:12.180 --> 10:16.000
What a current year argument appeals to is the idea of morality changing over time.

10:16.000 --> 10:19.540
Yeah, I can hear you saying right now, no shit, Dev, but just let me explain it.

10:19.540 --> 10:23.920
If somebody were to say the phrase, black people shouldn't be allowed to vote in 2023,

10:23.920 --> 10:27.220
it would be reasonable to look at that person strangely and to consider what he says to

10:27.220 --> 10:28.460
be immoral and offensive.

10:28.460 --> 10:33.100
But if he were to say that phrase back in 1963, two years before the Voting Rights Act

10:33.100 --> 10:36.820
of 1965, you would find it to be a reasonably popular position.

10:36.820 --> 10:40.580
Even if we consider it immoral today, even if we would have been a part of that segment

10:40.580 --> 10:44.620
of the population that considered it immoral back then, there was a decent chunk of the

10:44.620 --> 10:46.640
American public that agreed with it.

10:46.640 --> 10:50.800
The general morality of our culture has changed from then to now, and talking about the current

10:50.800 --> 10:54.200
year is a shorthand way of referencing that moral change.

10:54.200 --> 10:58.200
Now, imagine an argument between somebody who genuinely believes that black people shouldn't

10:58.200 --> 11:01.400
be allowed to vote in 2023 and someone who disagrees.

11:01.400 --> 11:04.320
Assuming they were both reasonable people and it didn't come to violence, it would

11:04.320 --> 11:06.280
probably go something like this.

11:06.280 --> 11:09.240
Person A says, I don't think black people should be allowed to vote.

11:09.240 --> 11:11.520
Person B says, that's fucking stupid.

11:11.520 --> 11:13.360
Person A says, that's an ad hominem.

11:13.360 --> 11:17.240
You're attacking me as a person, not actually presenting a counterargument as to why black

11:17.240 --> 11:19.080
people should be allowed to vote.

11:19.080 --> 11:21.740
Person B would then say, because it's 2023.

11:21.740 --> 11:25.440
When Person B brings up the current year, they're not actually making a literal claim

11:25.440 --> 11:29.080
that the calendar year somehow influences what moral code we should follow.

11:29.080 --> 11:34.380
It's 2023 is shorthand for, your position is so stupid, so indefensible in the face

11:34.380 --> 11:38.040
of the evidence that humanity has managed to collect over the years on this topic, that

11:38.040 --> 11:41.840
by merely stating it, you have demonstrated that you lack the ability to understand any

11:41.840 --> 11:44.460
rational argument I could give you in response.

11:44.460 --> 11:48.140
It's like saying, I don't think gravity exists or I think the earth is flat.

11:48.140 --> 11:51.720
What's really interesting about this logic is that when Justin Trudeau used it, it was

11:51.720 --> 11:54.960
actually exactly what he should have said from his position.

11:54.960 --> 11:59.660
Justin Trudeau ran his 2015 campaign with a promise of gender parity in his cabinet.

11:59.660 --> 12:03.780
He could have very easily responded to that reporter's question with, well, I ran my campaign

12:03.780 --> 12:05.760
with a promise of gender parity in my cabinet.

12:05.760 --> 12:07.720
I was elected with a majority government.

12:07.720 --> 12:09.720
Very clearly the people want me to do this.

12:09.720 --> 12:11.400
It's popular and it's immoral.

12:11.400 --> 12:15.440
Those few people who disagree with me are not only immoral, but unpopular.

12:15.440 --> 12:18.560
Therefore you should direct your question to them, but that doesn't have the makings

12:18.560 --> 12:19.840
of a viral soundbite.

12:19.840 --> 12:24.060
The phrase it's 2015 wraps all of that logic up into just a few seconds.

12:24.060 --> 12:28.880
A lot of the initial criticisms of the current year meme were therefore criticisms of progressive

12:28.880 --> 12:30.360
smugness.

12:30.360 --> 12:33.540
Progressives back then didn't feel the need to explain this logic.

12:33.540 --> 12:36.920
They simply presented it as fact in the most condescending way possible, making it seem

12:36.920 --> 12:42.220
like those who questioned their ideas were simply low IQ, backwards, regressive troglodytes

12:42.220 --> 12:44.360
that could be dismissed out of hand.

12:44.360 --> 12:48.800
Making fun of current yearisms is entertaining, but it also doesn't refute their logic.

12:48.800 --> 12:54.440
Shitting on Trudeau for saying it's 2015 isn't the same thing as actually examining his 2015

12:54.440 --> 12:56.880
cabinet picks and analyzing them for any deficiencies.

12:56.880 --> 13:01.640
If he actually did that and found glaring problems, his smug statement immediately deflates.

13:01.640 --> 13:05.840
His exclamation of it's 2015 now sounds like he's wholly out of touch.

13:05.880 --> 13:08.240
However, it's not 2015 anymore.

13:08.240 --> 13:12.680
Nowadays, a lot of people don't actually pack in all of that logic into the usage of current

13:12.680 --> 13:13.680
year.

13:13.680 --> 13:16.740
They simply exclaim it's the current year without thinking and then leave it at that.

13:16.740 --> 13:18.440
Like here, I see this sentiment a lot.

13:18.440 --> 13:19.440
It's 2023.

13:19.440 --> 13:21.040
Why doesn't America have universal health care?

13:21.040 --> 13:22.520
I think America should, by the way.

13:22.520 --> 13:26.000
But what underlying logic is beneath the use of 2023 here?

13:26.000 --> 13:27.120
What's beneath the hood?

13:27.120 --> 13:32.360
The answer is a belief in unyielding progress that things should get better over time, will

13:32.360 --> 13:33.820
get better over time.

13:33.820 --> 13:37.940
It's simply the natural way of the world, and those who impede this march are the enemies

13:37.940 --> 13:40.060
of a universal humanity.

13:40.060 --> 13:43.140
Explaining this mindset, what it gets right and what it gets wrong, is too big of a topic

13:43.140 --> 13:44.140
for this video.

13:44.140 --> 13:47.440
But most people who invoke the current year think like this.

13:47.440 --> 13:49.920
As time marches on, things should get better.

13:49.920 --> 13:51.780
And by better, they mean more progressive.

13:51.780 --> 13:55.520
And by more progressive, they mean whatever it is that they prefer in the current moment.

13:55.520 --> 13:57.360
Which leads us to the other half of the argument.

13:57.360 --> 13:59.740
The people employing the current year logic.

13:59.740 --> 14:03.660
Joosten, at 35 years old, came out against how quiet was dressed.

14:03.660 --> 14:05.480
She defended it back when she was 27.

14:05.480 --> 14:07.120
Mariel Cartwright from the Skullgirls video.

14:07.120 --> 14:10.600
She was in her early 20s when she defended her sexual expression through her artwork

14:10.600 --> 14:13.840
as being sex-positive and progressive and authentically her.

14:13.840 --> 14:17.720
She was in her mid-30s when she decided that old artwork needed to be censored.

14:17.720 --> 14:21.740
This is, once again, the instance of Egoraptor pulling the ladder up behind him, using slurs

14:21.740 --> 14:24.700
when he was younger and edgier to establish a career, and then shitting on people who

14:24.700 --> 14:28.900
now use slurs because he's older and tamer and more established.

14:28.900 --> 14:31.820
Some feedback that I received in the Skullgirls video made the argument that this is just

14:31.820 --> 14:33.420
the normal aging process.

14:33.420 --> 14:37.280
We do know that psychologically, when you're young, you're in the exploratory phase of

14:37.280 --> 14:38.300
your life.

14:38.300 --> 14:42.940
People tend to spend this time exploring radical ideas, or visiting new locations, or enjoying

14:42.940 --> 14:44.660
very romantic partners.

14:44.660 --> 14:48.680
But once you're a bit older, in your 30s and your 40s, the exploratory period is over.

14:48.680 --> 14:50.760
You've largely settled into who you're going to be.

14:50.760 --> 14:54.720
And what exists beyond the bounds of your society is generally viewed as less appealing

14:54.720 --> 14:56.340
as it did when you were younger.

14:56.340 --> 15:01.420
Most people tend to stop enjoying edgy humor, or overt sexuality, or novel experiences as

15:01.420 --> 15:02.420
they get older.

15:02.420 --> 15:05.820
And when older people do enjoy those things again, they often remark about how young they

15:05.820 --> 15:06.940
feel when they do it.

15:06.940 --> 15:08.900
So yeah, some of this is just maturing.

15:08.900 --> 15:11.020
But with maturation should come wisdom.

15:11.020 --> 15:14.860
These people should know that even if sexual content, or edgy humor, or whatever else is

15:14.860 --> 15:19.100
no longer to their taste, there's a new crop of young people coming up who are in the prime

15:19.100 --> 15:22.780
of their exploratory phase, who are going to enjoy it just as they did.

15:22.780 --> 15:26.040
But instead of that understanding, we simply see repression.

15:26.040 --> 15:30.080
Just as the parents of millennials view Dungeons and Dragons, and video games, and modern music

15:30.080 --> 15:35.500
as degenerate and destroying America's children, the parents of zoomers view anti-LGBT acceptance,

15:35.500 --> 15:39.360
or edgy jokes about progressive politics, as evidence that fascism is in full bloom

15:39.360 --> 15:40.360
once again.

15:40.360 --> 15:44.240
This is different language used to describe the same psychological process.

15:44.240 --> 15:48.580
Young people are bad because they're doing stuff that I find to be morally reprehensible.

15:48.580 --> 15:53.180
Even though when I was their age, I did stuff that older people found to be morally reprehensible.

15:53.180 --> 15:54.700
It's not just maturing.

15:54.700 --> 15:57.620
If it were, they'd be able to see what's going on here more objectively.

15:57.620 --> 16:02.520
It's the belief that the aforementioned march of progress also includes them on a personal level.

16:02.520 --> 16:06.060
If progressivism means that things should get better over time, then as progressive

16:06.060 --> 16:11.060
people, whatever moral changes they go through over time is necessarily getting better.

16:11.060 --> 16:15.100
Even if that effect is inconsistent between individuals or generations.

16:15.100 --> 16:20.020
A millennial progressive who was born in 1990 at 20 years old in 2010 probably believed

16:20.020 --> 16:24.320
that being edgy and sexual and irreverent towards authority was progressive activism

16:24.320 --> 16:28.760
because that's what the exploratory phase feels like when filtered through progressivism.

16:28.760 --> 16:33.480
That same person, as a 33 year old progressive in 2023, likely feels that what progressivism

16:33.480 --> 16:37.420
is now is stamping out problematic behavior through censorship, social shaming, maybe

16:37.420 --> 16:39.240
even deplatforming or canceling.

16:39.240 --> 16:42.220
Because they've moved out of the exploratory phase of their lives.

16:42.220 --> 16:45.760
And now their psychology is calling for stability, not exploration.

16:45.760 --> 16:49.920
In other words, the normal maturation process has become hijacked by the ideology.

16:49.920 --> 16:53.540
And as the progressive progresses through life, what they view as the proper progressive

16:53.540 --> 16:56.900
politics will shift in order to match their own life's era.

16:56.900 --> 17:01.380
This also explains why these people tend to use previous years as an insult.

17:01.380 --> 17:02.460
You see it a lot.

17:02.460 --> 17:06.980
People will say that the gamergate manbabies are stuck in 2014, anti-immigration activists

17:06.980 --> 17:10.740
in Britain are stuck in 2015, Trump fans are stuck in 2016.

17:10.740 --> 17:13.660
I was recently told that I was stuck in 2018.

17:13.660 --> 17:17.740
They regularly fail to recognize that the same logic applies to them.

17:17.740 --> 17:20.780
People who are still screaming about COVID are stuck in 2020.

17:20.780 --> 17:25.420
People who complain about the neo cons or the religious right are stuck in fucking 2008.

17:25.420 --> 17:29.540
But more importantly, there's a baked in assumption that newer is better, more modern,

17:29.540 --> 17:32.560
more progressive, more moral, and that if you haven't caught up to the current standard,

17:32.560 --> 17:36.660
you're somehow inferior, even if the current standard is actually worse than the previous

17:36.660 --> 17:37.660
one.

17:37.660 --> 17:40.420
When a person like this says it's the current year, what they're basically saying is that

17:40.420 --> 17:44.300
they had a utopian expectation of where society should be by the time they grew up.

17:44.300 --> 17:46.800
And now that they've grown up and realize we're not there, and in many cases will

17:46.800 --> 17:48.880
never be there, they're bitter.

17:48.880 --> 17:52.200
Sometimes that bitterness drives them towards more extreme politics in a desperate attempt

17:52.200 --> 17:54.120
to bring about that utopia.

17:54.120 --> 17:57.900
Sometimes it leads them to stagnating or regressing in life, believing that if the future only

17:57.900 --> 18:00.860
arrives when they're an adult and the future isn't here yet, then they have to still

18:00.860 --> 18:04.440
be young, even if they're actually just a 40 year old man baby.

18:04.440 --> 18:06.960
And sometimes they just stop being progressives.

18:06.960 --> 18:11.120
In any case, a lot of modern progressivism is a refusal to deal with the world as it

18:11.120 --> 18:12.120
is.

18:12.120 --> 18:16.520
And most current year arguments are basically the speaker voicing their frustration that

18:16.520 --> 18:20.320
their life hasn't turned out the way they wanted it to, and that it's everyone else's

18:20.320 --> 18:21.320
fault.

18:21.320 --> 18:25.760
Probably the most pure, blatant, mask-off version of this logic is Moviebob's Twitter

18:25.760 --> 18:26.760
feed.

18:26.760 --> 18:30.160
I am genuinely convinced that what he's saying openly is what simmers onto the surface

18:30.160 --> 18:32.580
of every radicalized, bitter utopian.

18:32.580 --> 18:36.040
We all be better off recognizing that just because time marches on, whatever it brings

18:36.040 --> 18:37.940
is not automatically going to be good.

18:37.940 --> 18:41.120
That progress looks differently to different people, because to progress means to move

18:41.120 --> 18:42.120
towards a goal.

18:42.120 --> 18:45.280
And if different people have different goals, then movement will look very different from

18:45.280 --> 18:46.680
each point of view.

18:46.680 --> 18:50.880
Sometimes we do luck out and discover a new way that is just blanket better than the previous.

18:50.880 --> 18:53.720
But for most things, change is not automatically good.

18:53.720 --> 18:55.520
Progress is not automatically good.

18:55.520 --> 19:01.000
Option B is not a blanket upgrade from option A. It simply has different positives and negatives

19:01.000 --> 19:04.880
that we need to weigh, and everyone will come to a different answer based on their own interests.

19:04.880 --> 19:06.700
Here's an example of what I mean.

19:06.700 --> 19:09.840
Is the world better now that we can order anything we like off of Amazon?

19:09.840 --> 19:11.480
I mean, yeah, that's progress.

19:11.480 --> 19:16.320
I can now pay less money to get a toolkit delivered to my house than it cost me 30 years

19:16.320 --> 19:20.320
ago to go out and buy a less advanced version of those same tools.

19:20.320 --> 19:25.200
That is 100% an improvement of my material conditions as a working class guy.

19:25.200 --> 19:29.280
Looking at this in terms of progress, the new way is better than the old, simple as.

19:29.280 --> 19:30.400
But is it really?

19:30.400 --> 19:32.100
What's been lost that I'm not considering?

19:32.100 --> 19:34.880
I no longer have to ask my neighbor to borrow his tools.

19:34.880 --> 19:37.200
That's less humiliating for me and less annoying for him.

19:37.200 --> 19:41.920
But now I also have one less material reason to maintain a relationship with him.

19:41.920 --> 19:45.720
Close-knit communities are partially based on material need, where relationships are

19:45.720 --> 19:50.040
maintained because that guy is your toolkit, and that guy can fix your car, and in return

19:50.040 --> 19:53.120
you babysit their kids or you tutor them or something.

19:53.120 --> 19:56.560
Increased economic productiveness has brought about the disintegration of close-knit communities

19:56.560 --> 20:00.060
because relationships of necessity are no longer necessary.

20:00.060 --> 20:01.060
Is this good?

20:01.060 --> 20:02.060
I don't know.

20:02.060 --> 20:05.080
It might actually be better this way, but it is a trade-off.

20:05.080 --> 20:10.160
We gained something, more access to material goods, but we also lost something, a close-knit

20:10.160 --> 20:14.360
community, and to simply declare that because it's newer it is therefore blanket better

20:14.360 --> 20:15.360
is stupid.

20:15.360 --> 20:19.540
When I made my nostalgia as fascism video, I also discussed this idea.

20:19.540 --> 20:23.440
Things are not simply better because they're new, and things were not bad simply because

20:23.440 --> 20:24.440
they were old.

20:24.440 --> 20:28.560
The reason you see attempts online to discredit the past is because progressive ideology demands

20:28.560 --> 20:29.560
it.

20:29.560 --> 20:33.160
The future must be better, therefore the past must be worse, and anything from the past

20:33.160 --> 20:37.240
that could have been better, even if only to some people, has to be erased.

20:37.240 --> 20:41.360
The radical has to make it so that their new regime is the only regime even throughout

20:41.360 --> 20:42.360
history.

20:42.360 --> 20:46.320
This is why Islamists destroy Buddhist monuments, communists restart the calendar at the new

20:46.320 --> 20:50.320
year zero, progressives tear down statues of America's founding fathers, and Nazis

20:50.320 --> 20:51.320
burn books.

20:51.320 --> 20:55.040
And yes, although it's at a much smaller scale, the same psychological impulse is why

20:55.040 --> 20:59.680
people censor old edgy content in video games because their current politics doesn't approve

20:59.680 --> 21:00.680
of them.

21:00.680 --> 21:04.440
What motivates all of this is a belief that the current year is the enlightened utopia,

21:04.440 --> 21:08.800
the previous year is the regressive dark age, and when time marches on, the calendar flips

21:08.800 --> 21:12.560
over, what was once the enlightened utopia will become the regressive dark age, even

21:12.560 --> 21:16.720
if nothing's actually changed, even if things have gotten worse, because the only time that

21:16.720 --> 21:18.960
exists for these people is right now.

21:18.960 --> 21:22.960
In replacing tradition with progress, they've replaced a continuum that stretches across

21:22.960 --> 21:27.160
the ages in both directions, of which they are only a small part, with a single moment

21:27.160 --> 21:31.280
centered on them, existing eternally, right up until the final second before reality comes

21:31.280 --> 21:31.880
crashing down.
