0	9280	While I was making the Skullgirls video, which by the way is actually really good, and you
9280	12800	should go watch it if you haven't already, one moment in one of the many side stories
12800	15100	of the whole drama piqued my interest.
15100	20500	In the Atrox Chobatsu chat logs, where he's justifying the 2023 censorship of risque content
20500	24920	from the 2011 video game Skullgirls in order to update it to modern standards, he makes
24920	28200	this point, 2011 was such a different time.
28400	32080	What's being said here is that the risque content in Skullgirls, the fan service that
32080	37680	it made its name off of, and that people generally appreciated, was acceptable in 2011, but it's
37680	40080	no longer acceptable in 2023.
40080	43880	I considered making this part of the Skullgirls video proper, but I realized it's actually
43880	47100	its own thing and worthy of discussing in a wider context.
47100	51800	This is what terminally online culture warriors call the current year phenomenon.
51800	56800	Urban Dictionary defines it as a term often used in a derogatory manner to refer to comments
56800	62520	and rebuttals about the current year in the actual or expected state of being for a society.
62520	64080	It comes in two forms.
64080	68800	The first is when asked why something is the way it is, the reply given is its current
68800	69800	year.
69800	74040	So the answer to the question, why is the risque content being removed from Skullgirls
74040	76340	is because it's 2023.
76340	80560	The second form of the argument is when asked why something is being changed, the reply
80560	83820	is because the previous year isn't the current year.
83820	87740	Some example, why did Skullgirls have risque content in the first place?
87740	91460	The answer is because 2011 is not 2023.
91460	95340	What's funny about the current year phenomenon is that the actual current year is always
95340	96340	changing.
96340	100180	This video is being made in 2023, but if you're watching it in, say, 2025, it's going to
100180	101540	sound a little bit strange.
101540	103740	To you, 2023 isn't the current year.
103740	107860	2023 is in the past, with all of its flaws and controversies, while the current year
107860	109260	is 2025.
109260	113700	This is why when people mock this idea, they don't actually insert a specific year.
113700	117820	They simply say the words current year as a way to slight the people who actually think
117820	118820	this way.
118820	123620	The heels versus babyface starfield controversy is a recent noteworthy example of what I'm
123620	124620	talking about.
124620	128900	I love nothing more than with all of that laid out in front of me.
128900	135540	I love nothing more than to be dragged out at every fucking conceivable opportunity so
135540	137580	you can fucking current day us.
137580	139900	Sorry, did you want to get immersed in our world?
139900	141780	Yeah, well, guess what?
141780	144220	Fucking pronouns.
144220	146740	Fucking gender ambiguity.
146740	152980	Fucking current day Californian shit because that's all we fucking know because we're boring.
152980	156460	We're so fucking boring.
156460	160860	When people genuinely use this argument and time marches past the year they've set as
160860	164560	the current year, going back and listening to it sounds very strange.
164560	169020	The modern version of this meme started with John Oliver back in 2015, where he would regularly
169020	173600	talk about the European migrant crisis and respond to the European right wing's criticism
173600	177340	of migration by saying, come on, people, it's 2015.
177340	180500	There's tons of compilations on YouTube making fun of this from back in the day.
183900	188580	If I hear there are a lot of terrorists coming my way, I'm going to be delighted.
188580	190100	I'm going to be delighted.
190100	191660	I'm going to be delighted.
191660	193180	I'm going to be delighted.
193180	194700	I'm going to be delighted.
194700	198300	While each story is unique, many of them are heartbreaking.
198300	201060	Nojeen is 16 and from Kobane in Syria.
201060	206060	And so many like her and so many like her and so many like her.
206060	210400	Fun fact, though, the one clip that everyone uses of John Oliver saying the praise as the
210400	211500	main meme.
212500	214900	Yeah, that one.
214900	219260	The context of it actually isn't John Oliver critiquing the right wing by simply naming
219260	220260	the current year.
220260	224180	Rather, it's from a segment where he explains that he doesn't want to care about the 2016
224180	226500	presidential election until it's actually 2016.
241500	254300	Presumably, this clip became the go-to for the meme because, even if it's not actually
254300	258460	from a segment where John Oliver makes a current year argument, he does make that argument
258460	259460	a lot.
259460	264020	And it was the cleanest instance of him saying the words, it's 2015 from an audio perspective.
264020	268980	John Oliver saying it's 2015 as a criticism of the right is one half of why current year
268980	270180	became a meme.
270180	274000	The other half is the Canadian Prime Minister, the hyper progressive Justin Trudeau, saying
274000	293140	the same thing in the same year.
293140	297260	Both Trudeau and Oliver approached the topic with the same progressive smugness, which
297260	299760	is probably why mocking it became so popular.
299760	303040	When listening to these clips in 2023, it sounds strange, doesn't it?
303040	306760	Just like to our future viewer, it's not 2023 anymore, it's 2025.
306760	309660	To us, it's not 2015, it's 2023.
309660	314800	What makes 2015 so special that simply uttering its name was considered a coherent argument?
314800	317700	Remember earlier I said the current year argument takes two forms.
317700	321580	The first is to justify the current state of affairs by saying it's the current year.
321580	326440	The second is to justify a change by saying the previous year's standard was problematic.
326440	331000	But it's not hard to find examples of a year being considered both problematic and modern,
331000	333600	and once you do that, everything starts to fall apart.
333600	336800	Here's an article from a month ago, where the voice actress for Quiet from Metal Gear
336800	342480	Solid 5, Stephanie Joosten, voices her disapproval for Quiet's revealing attire during the game.
342480	347400	She specifically said, This game came out in 2015, and I think the video game landscape
347400	349600	has changed quite a lot since then.
349600	351760	People are looking for more representation, and I really get it.
351760	355320	For those of you who don't know, from the initial reveal of Quiet during I think an
355320	361000	E3 2013 presentation, up until the game's launch in 2015, feminists online were blasting
361000	364540	her character design for being objectifying and degrading towards women.
364540	367920	The few religious boomers who were still talking about video games agreed with them in their
367920	370120	own way, saying they were corrupting the youth.
370120	375840	Meanwhile, it was a coalition of normal, unaligned gamers, smug fedora-tipping reddit liberals,
375840	380560	and the few sex-positive feminists that existed back then coming together to say no, it's
380560	384740	actually fine to have an attractive woman with her tits out, stop acting like a puritan.
384740	389080	But with regards to her portrayal of Quiet, Joosten is using a current year argument.
389080	393680	Metal Gear Solid 5 came out in 2015, it's now 2023, standards have changed in the past
393680	394680	seven years.
394680	398480	What was good is now bad, including, by the way, her initial defense of it.
398480	402900	Joosten gave an interview in April of 2015 on Yongye's channel, never thought I'd say
402900	406800	his name again, where she says that she's not bothered by Quiet's outfit.
406800	412980	A lot of people took notice of Quiet's attire, or lack thereof, some would say.
412980	420520	Were you nervous about the character, how she would be received as a result of what
420520	425560	she's wearing, and what kind of feedback did you get after Quiet was unveiled?
425560	436460	Um, well, I was really expecting there to be this kind of reaction there was, for lots
436460	437460	of controversy.
437460	448980	Because of course, when I got to see her dying at first, I was shocked too, because especially
448980	455020	since everybody didn't get to hear her story yet.
455020	465280	I can understand people are angry about it, or saying it's shown too much, but I'm not
465280	466280	bothered by it.
466280	467560	Here's what's so funny to me.
467560	472280	If we're to listen to say, John Oliver or Justin Trudeau, 2015 was an era of progressive
472280	473280	morality.
473280	477840	They were making explicitly progressive proclamations, and justifying them by simply saying, it's
477840	478840	2015.
478840	480440	Of course this is what we're doing.
480440	485060	In that context, suddenly seeing 2015 uses an exclamation of a past era where things
485060	488880	were not progressive, in fact they were the regressive dark ages that we've thankfully
488880	492640	moved past, the cognitive dissonance starts to come into focus.
492640	494740	Here's another example going back even further.
494740	497740	I used this on a weekly sip a few months ago, but I think it actually works better than
497740	498860	the Quiet example.
498860	504420	Eddie Murphy's two blowout stand-up comedy specials of the 1980s, Delirious in 1983,
504420	509740	and Raw in 1987, contained tons of homophobic slurs and remarks, stereotypes about gay people's
509740	512880	sexual practices, stereotypes about AIDS, it was fucking brutal.
512880	516700	But they were also hilarious, and they're considered some of the best stand-up comedy
516700	518220	sets of all time.
518220	524920	In 1996, the San Francisco news website SFGate, yes Zoomers, the internet existed in 1996,
524920	530020	published an article titled, After 15 Years, Actor Apologizes for Gay Slurs.
530020	533320	Gay activists at the time were demanding that Eddie Murphy's appearance in The Late Show
533320	537640	with David Letterman be cancelled because of his homophobic remarks from a decade ago.
537640	541440	In response, Murphy released a public statement saying, Just like the rest of the world, I
541440	545660	am more educated about AIDS in 1996 than I was in 1981.
545660	549560	I think it's unfair to take the words of a misinformed 21-year-old and apply them to
549560	551680	an informed 35-year-old man.
551680	554560	I know how serious an issue AIDS is the world over.
554560	556180	I know AIDS isn't funny.
556180	559320	It's 1996, and I'm a lot smarter about AIDS now.
559320	561040	This is a current year argument.
561040	566320	Only now, the current year in question, the peak of modern progressive morality is 1996,
566320	568820	and the regressive dark ages is 1981.
568820	574280	Do you think that progressives nowadays believe 1996 was a peak of modern progressive morality?
574280	575280	We all know they don't.
575280	578680	They go to great lengths to talk about how the 90s sucked and was full of bigotry every
578680	579680	chance they get.
579680	585520	Kind of like how Oliver and Trudeau and Justin were pro-2015 until 2015 became the past,
585520	586520	now they're anti-2015.
586520	592300	Oh, also, unlike modern progressive activists, back in 1996, activists actually accepted
592300	593840	Murphy's apology.
593840	597480	Progressive activists nowadays tend to just want people to be cancelled forever, and in
597480	601980	fact, modern progressives still occasionally dredge this shit back up to demand Eddie Murphy
601980	603720	be cancelled yet again.
603720	604720	So what's going on here?
604720	609040	There's two separate things, the logic of the current year argument and the people employing
609040	610120	the current year argument.
610120	612180	Let's start with the logic first.
612180	616000	What a current year argument appeals to is the idea of morality changing over time.
616000	619540	Yeah, I can hear you saying right now, no shit, Dev, but just let me explain it.
619540	623920	If somebody were to say the phrase, black people shouldn't be allowed to vote in 2023,
623920	627220	it would be reasonable to look at that person strangely and to consider what he says to
627220	628460	be immoral and offensive.
628460	633100	But if he were to say that phrase back in 1963, two years before the Voting Rights Act
633100	636820	of 1965, you would find it to be a reasonably popular position.
636820	640580	Even if we consider it immoral today, even if we would have been a part of that segment
640580	644620	of the population that considered it immoral back then, there was a decent chunk of the
644620	646640	American public that agreed with it.
646640	650800	The general morality of our culture has changed from then to now, and talking about the current
650800	654200	year is a shorthand way of referencing that moral change.
654200	658200	Now, imagine an argument between somebody who genuinely believes that black people shouldn't
658200	661400	be allowed to vote in 2023 and someone who disagrees.
661400	664320	Assuming they were both reasonable people and it didn't come to violence, it would
664320	666280	probably go something like this.
666280	669240	Person A says, I don't think black people should be allowed to vote.
669240	671520	Person B says, that's fucking stupid.
671520	673360	Person A says, that's an ad hominem.
673360	677240	You're attacking me as a person, not actually presenting a counterargument as to why black
677240	679080	people should be allowed to vote.
679080	681740	Person B would then say, because it's 2023.
681740	685440	When Person B brings up the current year, they're not actually making a literal claim
685440	689080	that the calendar year somehow influences what moral code we should follow.
689080	694380	It's 2023 is shorthand for, your position is so stupid, so indefensible in the face
694380	698040	of the evidence that humanity has managed to collect over the years on this topic, that
698040	701840	by merely stating it, you have demonstrated that you lack the ability to understand any
701840	704460	rational argument I could give you in response.
704460	708140	It's like saying, I don't think gravity exists or I think the earth is flat.
708140	711720	What's really interesting about this logic is that when Justin Trudeau used it, it was
711720	714960	actually exactly what he should have said from his position.
714960	719660	Justin Trudeau ran his 2015 campaign with a promise of gender parity in his cabinet.
719660	723780	He could have very easily responded to that reporter's question with, well, I ran my campaign
723780	725760	with a promise of gender parity in my cabinet.
725760	727720	I was elected with a majority government.
727720	729720	Very clearly the people want me to do this.
729720	731400	It's popular and it's immoral.
731400	735440	Those few people who disagree with me are not only immoral, but unpopular.
735440	738560	Therefore you should direct your question to them, but that doesn't have the makings
738560	739840	of a viral soundbite.
739840	744060	The phrase it's 2015 wraps all of that logic up into just a few seconds.
744060	748880	A lot of the initial criticisms of the current year meme were therefore criticisms of progressive
748880	750360	smugness.
750360	753540	Progressives back then didn't feel the need to explain this logic.
753540	756920	They simply presented it as fact in the most condescending way possible, making it seem
756920	762220	like those who questioned their ideas were simply low IQ, backwards, regressive troglodytes
762220	764360	that could be dismissed out of hand.
764360	768800	Making fun of current yearisms is entertaining, but it also doesn't refute their logic.
768800	774440	Shitting on Trudeau for saying it's 2015 isn't the same thing as actually examining his 2015
774440	776880	cabinet picks and analyzing them for any deficiencies.
776880	781640	If he actually did that and found glaring problems, his smug statement immediately deflates.
781640	785840	His exclamation of it's 2015 now sounds like he's wholly out of touch.
785880	788240	However, it's not 2015 anymore.
788240	792680	Nowadays, a lot of people don't actually pack in all of that logic into the usage of current
792680	793680	year.
793680	796740	They simply exclaim it's the current year without thinking and then leave it at that.
796740	798440	Like here, I see this sentiment a lot.
798440	799440	It's 2023.
799440	801040	Why doesn't America have universal health care?
801040	802520	I think America should, by the way.
802520	806000	But what underlying logic is beneath the use of 2023 here?
806000	807120	What's beneath the hood?
807120	812360	The answer is a belief in unyielding progress that things should get better over time, will
812360	813820	get better over time.
813820	817940	It's simply the natural way of the world, and those who impede this march are the enemies
817940	820060	of a universal humanity.
820060	823140	Explaining this mindset, what it gets right and what it gets wrong, is too big of a topic
823140	824140	for this video.
824140	827440	But most people who invoke the current year think like this.
827440	829920	As time marches on, things should get better.
829920	831780	And by better, they mean more progressive.
831780	835520	And by more progressive, they mean whatever it is that they prefer in the current moment.
835520	837360	Which leads us to the other half of the argument.
837360	839740	The people employing the current year logic.
839740	843660	Joosten, at 35 years old, came out against how quiet was dressed.
843660	845480	She defended it back when she was 27.
845480	847120	Mariel Cartwright from the Skullgirls video.
847120	850600	She was in her early 20s when she defended her sexual expression through her artwork
850600	853840	as being sex-positive and progressive and authentically her.
853840	857720	She was in her mid-30s when she decided that old artwork needed to be censored.
857720	861740	This is, once again, the instance of Egoraptor pulling the ladder up behind him, using slurs
861740	864700	when he was younger and edgier to establish a career, and then shitting on people who
864700	868900	now use slurs because he's older and tamer and more established.
868900	871820	Some feedback that I received in the Skullgirls video made the argument that this is just
871820	873420	the normal aging process.
873420	877280	We do know that psychologically, when you're young, you're in the exploratory phase of
877280	878300	your life.
878300	882940	People tend to spend this time exploring radical ideas, or visiting new locations, or enjoying
882940	884660	very romantic partners.
884660	888680	But once you're a bit older, in your 30s and your 40s, the exploratory period is over.
888680	890760	You've largely settled into who you're going to be.
890760	894720	And what exists beyond the bounds of your society is generally viewed as less appealing
894720	896340	as it did when you were younger.
896340	901420	Most people tend to stop enjoying edgy humor, or overt sexuality, or novel experiences as
901420	902420	they get older.
902420	905820	And when older people do enjoy those things again, they often remark about how young they
905820	906940	feel when they do it.
906940	908900	So yeah, some of this is just maturing.
908900	911020	But with maturation should come wisdom.
911020	914860	These people should know that even if sexual content, or edgy humor, or whatever else is
914860	919100	no longer to their taste, there's a new crop of young people coming up who are in the prime
919100	922780	of their exploratory phase, who are going to enjoy it just as they did.
922780	926040	But instead of that understanding, we simply see repression.
926040	930080	Just as the parents of millennials view Dungeons and Dragons, and video games, and modern music
930080	935500	as degenerate and destroying America's children, the parents of zoomers view anti-LGBT acceptance,
935500	939360	or edgy jokes about progressive politics, as evidence that fascism is in full bloom
939360	940360	once again.
940360	944240	This is different language used to describe the same psychological process.
944240	948580	Young people are bad because they're doing stuff that I find to be morally reprehensible.
948580	953180	Even though when I was their age, I did stuff that older people found to be morally reprehensible.
953180	954700	It's not just maturing.
954700	957620	If it were, they'd be able to see what's going on here more objectively.
957620	962520	It's the belief that the aforementioned march of progress also includes them on a personal level.
962520	966060	If progressivism means that things should get better over time, then as progressive
966060	971060	people, whatever moral changes they go through over time is necessarily getting better.
971060	975100	Even if that effect is inconsistent between individuals or generations.
975100	980020	A millennial progressive who was born in 1990 at 20 years old in 2010 probably believed
980020	984320	that being edgy and sexual and irreverent towards authority was progressive activism
984320	988760	because that's what the exploratory phase feels like when filtered through progressivism.
988760	993480	That same person, as a 33 year old progressive in 2023, likely feels that what progressivism
993480	997420	is now is stamping out problematic behavior through censorship, social shaming, maybe
997420	999240	even deplatforming or canceling.
999240	1002220	Because they've moved out of the exploratory phase of their lives.
1002220	1005760	And now their psychology is calling for stability, not exploration.
1005760	1009920	In other words, the normal maturation process has become hijacked by the ideology.
1009920	1013540	And as the progressive progresses through life, what they view as the proper progressive
1013540	1016900	politics will shift in order to match their own life's era.
1016900	1021380	This also explains why these people tend to use previous years as an insult.
1021380	1022460	You see it a lot.
1022460	1026980	People will say that the gamergate manbabies are stuck in 2014, anti-immigration activists
1026980	1030740	in Britain are stuck in 2015, Trump fans are stuck in 2016.
1030740	1033660	I was recently told that I was stuck in 2018.
1033660	1037740	They regularly fail to recognize that the same logic applies to them.
1037740	1040780	People who are still screaming about COVID are stuck in 2020.
1040780	1045420	People who complain about the neo cons or the religious right are stuck in fucking 2008.
1045420	1049540	But more importantly, there's a baked in assumption that newer is better, more modern,
1049540	1052560	more progressive, more moral, and that if you haven't caught up to the current standard,
1052560	1056660	you're somehow inferior, even if the current standard is actually worse than the previous
1056660	1057660	one.
1057660	1060420	When a person like this says it's the current year, what they're basically saying is that
1060420	1064300	they had a utopian expectation of where society should be by the time they grew up.
1064300	1066800	And now that they've grown up and realize we're not there, and in many cases will
1066800	1068880	never be there, they're bitter.
1068880	1072200	Sometimes that bitterness drives them towards more extreme politics in a desperate attempt
1072200	1074120	to bring about that utopia.
1074120	1077900	Sometimes it leads them to stagnating or regressing in life, believing that if the future only
1077900	1080860	arrives when they're an adult and the future isn't here yet, then they have to still
1080860	1084440	be young, even if they're actually just a 40 year old man baby.
1084440	1086960	And sometimes they just stop being progressives.
1086960	1091120	In any case, a lot of modern progressivism is a refusal to deal with the world as it
1091120	1092120	is.
1092120	1096520	And most current year arguments are basically the speaker voicing their frustration that
1096520	1100320	their life hasn't turned out the way they wanted it to, and that it's everyone else's
1100320	1101320	fault.
1101320	1105760	Probably the most pure, blatant, mask-off version of this logic is Moviebob's Twitter
1105760	1106760	feed.
1106760	1110160	I am genuinely convinced that what he's saying openly is what simmers onto the surface
1110160	1112580	of every radicalized, bitter utopian.
1112580	1116040	We all be better off recognizing that just because time marches on, whatever it brings
1116040	1117940	is not automatically going to be good.
1117940	1121120	That progress looks differently to different people, because to progress means to move
1121120	1122120	towards a goal.
1122120	1125280	And if different people have different goals, then movement will look very different from
1125280	1126680	each point of view.
1126680	1130880	Sometimes we do luck out and discover a new way that is just blanket better than the previous.
1130880	1133720	But for most things, change is not automatically good.
1133720	1135520	Progress is not automatically good.
1135520	1141000	Option B is not a blanket upgrade from option A. It simply has different positives and negatives
1141000	1144880	that we need to weigh, and everyone will come to a different answer based on their own interests.
1144880	1146700	Here's an example of what I mean.
1146700	1149840	Is the world better now that we can order anything we like off of Amazon?
1149840	1151480	I mean, yeah, that's progress.
1151480	1156320	I can now pay less money to get a toolkit delivered to my house than it cost me 30 years
1156320	1160320	ago to go out and buy a less advanced version of those same tools.
1160320	1165200	That is 100% an improvement of my material conditions as a working class guy.
1165200	1169280	Looking at this in terms of progress, the new way is better than the old, simple as.
1169280	1170400	But is it really?
1170400	1172100	What's been lost that I'm not considering?
1172100	1174880	I no longer have to ask my neighbor to borrow his tools.
1174880	1177200	That's less humiliating for me and less annoying for him.
1177200	1181920	But now I also have one less material reason to maintain a relationship with him.
1181920	1185720	Close-knit communities are partially based on material need, where relationships are
1185720	1190040	maintained because that guy is your toolkit, and that guy can fix your car, and in return
1190040	1193120	you babysit their kids or you tutor them or something.
1193120	1196560	Increased economic productiveness has brought about the disintegration of close-knit communities
1196560	1200060	because relationships of necessity are no longer necessary.
1200060	1201060	Is this good?
1201060	1202060	I don't know.
1202060	1205080	It might actually be better this way, but it is a trade-off.
1205080	1210160	We gained something, more access to material goods, but we also lost something, a close-knit
1210160	1214360	community, and to simply declare that because it's newer it is therefore blanket better
1214360	1215360	is stupid.
1215360	1219540	When I made my nostalgia as fascism video, I also discussed this idea.
1219540	1223440	Things are not simply better because they're new, and things were not bad simply because
1223440	1224440	they were old.
1224440	1228560	The reason you see attempts online to discredit the past is because progressive ideology demands
1228560	1229560	it.
1229560	1233160	The future must be better, therefore the past must be worse, and anything from the past
1233160	1237240	that could have been better, even if only to some people, has to be erased.
1237240	1241360	The radical has to make it so that their new regime is the only regime even throughout
1241360	1242360	history.
1242360	1246320	This is why Islamists destroy Buddhist monuments, communists restart the calendar at the new
1246320	1250320	year zero, progressives tear down statues of America's founding fathers, and Nazis
1250320	1251320	burn books.
1251320	1255040	And yes, although it's at a much smaller scale, the same psychological impulse is why
1255040	1259680	people censor old edgy content in video games because their current politics doesn't approve
1259680	1260680	of them.
1260680	1264440	What motivates all of this is a belief that the current year is the enlightened utopia,
1264440	1268800	the previous year is the regressive dark age, and when time marches on, the calendar flips
1268800	1272560	over, what was once the enlightened utopia will become the regressive dark age, even
1272560	1276720	if nothing's actually changed, even if things have gotten worse, because the only time that
1276720	1278960	exists for these people is right now.
1278960	1282960	In replacing tradition with progress, they've replaced a continuum that stretches across
1282960	1287160	the ages in both directions, of which they are only a small part, with a single moment
1287160	1291280	centered on them, existing eternally, right up until the final second before reality comes
1291280	1291880	crashing down.
