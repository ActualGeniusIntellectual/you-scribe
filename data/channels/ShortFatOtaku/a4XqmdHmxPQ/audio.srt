1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,280
While I was making the Skullgirls video, which by the way is actually really good, and you

2
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:12,800
should go watch it if you haven't already, one moment in one of the many side stories

3
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:15,100
of the whole drama piqued my interest.

4
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:20,500
In the Atrox Chobatsu chat logs, where he's justifying the 2023 censorship of risque content

5
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:24,920
from the 2011 video game Skullgirls in order to update it to modern standards, he makes

6
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:28,200
this point, 2011 was such a different time.

7
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:32,080
What's being said here is that the risque content in Skullgirls, the fan service that

8
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:37,680
it made its name off of, and that people generally appreciated, was acceptable in 2011, but it's

9
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:40,080
no longer acceptable in 2023.

10
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:43,880
I considered making this part of the Skullgirls video proper, but I realized it's actually

11
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:47,100
its own thing and worthy of discussing in a wider context.

12
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:51,800
This is what terminally online culture warriors call the current year phenomenon.

13
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:56,800
Urban Dictionary defines it as a term often used in a derogatory manner to refer to comments

14
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:02,520
and rebuttals about the current year in the actual or expected state of being for a society.

15
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:04,080
It comes in two forms.

16
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:08,800
The first is when asked why something is the way it is, the reply given is its current

17
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:09,800
year.

18
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:14,040
So the answer to the question, why is the risque content being removed from Skullgirls

19
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:16,340
is because it's 2023.

20
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:20,560
The second form of the argument is when asked why something is being changed, the reply

21
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:23,820
is because the previous year isn't the current year.

22
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:27,740
Some example, why did Skullgirls have risque content in the first place?

23
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:31,460
The answer is because 2011 is not 2023.

24
00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:35,340
What's funny about the current year phenomenon is that the actual current year is always

25
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:36,340
changing.

26
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:40,180
This video is being made in 2023, but if you're watching it in, say, 2025, it's going to

27
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:41,540
sound a little bit strange.

28
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:43,740
To you, 2023 isn't the current year.

29
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:47,860
2023 is in the past, with all of its flaws and controversies, while the current year

30
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:49,260
is 2025.

31
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:53,700
This is why when people mock this idea, they don't actually insert a specific year.

32
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:57,820
They simply say the words current year as a way to slight the people who actually think

33
00:01:57,820 --> 00:01:58,820
this way.

34
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:03,620
The heels versus babyface starfield controversy is a recent noteworthy example of what I'm

35
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:04,620
talking about.

36
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:08,900
I love nothing more than with all of that laid out in front of me.

37
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:15,540
I love nothing more than to be dragged out at every fucking conceivable opportunity so

38
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:17,580
you can fucking current day us.

39
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:19,900
Sorry, did you want to get immersed in our world?

40
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:21,780
Yeah, well, guess what?

41
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:24,220
Fucking pronouns.

42
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:26,740
Fucking gender ambiguity.

43
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:32,980
Fucking current day Californian shit because that's all we fucking know because we're boring.

44
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:36,460
We're so fucking boring.

45
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:40,860
When people genuinely use this argument and time marches past the year they've set as

46
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:44,560
the current year, going back and listening to it sounds very strange.

47
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:49,020
The modern version of this meme started with John Oliver back in 2015, where he would regularly

48
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:53,600
talk about the European migrant crisis and respond to the European right wing's criticism

49
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:57,340
of migration by saying, come on, people, it's 2015.

50
00:02:57,340 --> 00:03:00,500
There's tons of compilations on YouTube making fun of this from back in the day.

51
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:08,580
If I hear there are a lot of terrorists coming my way, I'm going to be delighted.

52
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:10,100
I'm going to be delighted.

53
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:11,660
I'm going to be delighted.

54
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:13,180
I'm going to be delighted.

55
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:14,700
I'm going to be delighted.

56
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:18,300
While each story is unique, many of them are heartbreaking.

57
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:21,060
Nojeen is 16 and from Kobane in Syria.

58
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:26,060
And so many like her and so many like her and so many like her.

59
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:30,400
Fun fact, though, the one clip that everyone uses of John Oliver saying the praise as the

60
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,500
main meme.

61
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:34,900
Yeah, that one.

62
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:39,260
The context of it actually isn't John Oliver critiquing the right wing by simply naming

63
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:40,260
the current year.

64
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:44,180
Rather, it's from a segment where he explains that he doesn't want to care about the 2016

65
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:46,500
presidential election until it's actually 2016.

66
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:14,300
Presumably, this clip became the go-to for the meme because, even if it's not actually

67
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:18,460
from a segment where John Oliver makes a current year argument, he does make that argument

68
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:19,460
a lot.

69
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:24,020
And it was the cleanest instance of him saying the words, it's 2015 from an audio perspective.

70
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:28,980
John Oliver saying it's 2015 as a criticism of the right is one half of why current year

71
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:30,180
became a meme.

72
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:34,000
The other half is the Canadian Prime Minister, the hyper progressive Justin Trudeau, saying

73
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:53,140
the same thing in the same year.

74
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:57,260
Both Trudeau and Oliver approached the topic with the same progressive smugness, which

75
00:04:57,260 --> 00:04:59,760
is probably why mocking it became so popular.

76
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:03,040
When listening to these clips in 2023, it sounds strange, doesn't it?

77
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:06,760
Just like to our future viewer, it's not 2023 anymore, it's 2025.

78
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:09,660
To us, it's not 2015, it's 2023.

79
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:14,800
What makes 2015 so special that simply uttering its name was considered a coherent argument?

80
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,700
Remember earlier I said the current year argument takes two forms.

81
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:21,580
The first is to justify the current state of affairs by saying it's the current year.

82
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:26,440
The second is to justify a change by saying the previous year's standard was problematic.

83
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:31,000
But it's not hard to find examples of a year being considered both problematic and modern,

84
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,600
and once you do that, everything starts to fall apart.

85
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,800
Here's an article from a month ago, where the voice actress for Quiet from Metal Gear

86
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:42,480
Solid 5, Stephanie Joosten, voices her disapproval for Quiet's revealing attire during the game.

87
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:47,400
She specifically said, This game came out in 2015, and I think the video game landscape

88
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:49,600
has changed quite a lot since then.

89
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,760
People are looking for more representation, and I really get it.

90
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:55,320
For those of you who don't know, from the initial reveal of Quiet during I think an

91
00:05:55,320 --> 00:06:01,000
E3 2013 presentation, up until the game's launch in 2015, feminists online were blasting

92
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,540
her character design for being objectifying and degrading towards women.

93
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:07,920
The few religious boomers who were still talking about video games agreed with them in their

94
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:10,120
own way, saying they were corrupting the youth.

95
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:15,840
Meanwhile, it was a coalition of normal, unaligned gamers, smug fedora-tipping reddit liberals,

96
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:20,560
and the few sex-positive feminists that existed back then coming together to say no, it's

97
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:24,740
actually fine to have an attractive woman with her tits out, stop acting like a puritan.

98
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:29,080
But with regards to her portrayal of Quiet, Joosten is using a current year argument.

99
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:33,680
Metal Gear Solid 5 came out in 2015, it's now 2023, standards have changed in the past

100
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:34,680
seven years.

101
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:38,480
What was good is now bad, including, by the way, her initial defense of it.

102
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:42,900
Joosten gave an interview in April of 2015 on Yongye's channel, never thought I'd say

103
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:46,800
his name again, where she says that she's not bothered by Quiet's outfit.

104
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:52,980
A lot of people took notice of Quiet's attire, or lack thereof, some would say.

105
00:06:52,980 --> 00:07:00,520
Were you nervous about the character, how she would be received as a result of what

106
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:05,560
she's wearing, and what kind of feedback did you get after Quiet was unveiled?

107
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:16,460
Um, well, I was really expecting there to be this kind of reaction there was, for lots

108
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:17,460
of controversy.

109
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:28,980
Because of course, when I got to see her dying at first, I was shocked too, because especially

110
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:35,020
since everybody didn't get to hear her story yet.

111
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:45,280
I can understand people are angry about it, or saying it's shown too much, but I'm not

112
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:46,280
bothered by it.

113
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:47,560
Here's what's so funny to me.

114
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:52,280
If we're to listen to say, John Oliver or Justin Trudeau, 2015 was an era of progressive

115
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:53,280
morality.

116
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:57,840
They were making explicitly progressive proclamations, and justifying them by simply saying, it's

117
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:58,840
2015.

118
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:00,440
Of course this is what we're doing.

119
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:05,060
In that context, suddenly seeing 2015 uses an exclamation of a past era where things

120
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:08,880
were not progressive, in fact they were the regressive dark ages that we've thankfully

121
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:12,640
moved past, the cognitive dissonance starts to come into focus.

122
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:14,740
Here's another example going back even further.

123
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:17,740
I used this on a weekly sip a few months ago, but I think it actually works better than

124
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:18,860
the Quiet example.

125
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:24,420
Eddie Murphy's two blowout stand-up comedy specials of the 1980s, Delirious in 1983,

126
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:29,740
and Raw in 1987, contained tons of homophobic slurs and remarks, stereotypes about gay people's

127
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:32,880
sexual practices, stereotypes about AIDS, it was fucking brutal.

128
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:36,700
But they were also hilarious, and they're considered some of the best stand-up comedy

129
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:38,220
sets of all time.

130
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:44,920
In 1996, the San Francisco news website SFGate, yes Zoomers, the internet existed in 1996,

131
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:50,020
published an article titled, After 15 Years, Actor Apologizes for Gay Slurs.

132
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:53,320
Gay activists at the time were demanding that Eddie Murphy's appearance in The Late Show

133
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:57,640
with David Letterman be cancelled because of his homophobic remarks from a decade ago.

134
00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:01,440
In response, Murphy released a public statement saying, Just like the rest of the world, I

135
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:05,660
am more educated about AIDS in 1996 than I was in 1981.

136
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:09,560
I think it's unfair to take the words of a misinformed 21-year-old and apply them to

137
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:11,680
an informed 35-year-old man.

138
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:14,560
I know how serious an issue AIDS is the world over.

139
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,180
I know AIDS isn't funny.

140
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:19,320
It's 1996, and I'm a lot smarter about AIDS now.

141
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:21,040
This is a current year argument.

142
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:26,320
Only now, the current year in question, the peak of modern progressive morality is 1996,

143
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,820
and the regressive dark ages is 1981.

144
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:34,280
Do you think that progressives nowadays believe 1996 was a peak of modern progressive morality?

145
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:35,280
We all know they don't.

146
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:38,680
They go to great lengths to talk about how the 90s sucked and was full of bigotry every

147
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:39,680
chance they get.

148
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:45,520
Kind of like how Oliver and Trudeau and Justin were pro-2015 until 2015 became the past,

149
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:46,520
now they're anti-2015.

150
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:52,300
Oh, also, unlike modern progressive activists, back in 1996, activists actually accepted

151
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:53,840
Murphy's apology.

152
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:57,480
Progressive activists nowadays tend to just want people to be cancelled forever, and in

153
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:01,980
fact, modern progressives still occasionally dredge this shit back up to demand Eddie Murphy

154
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:03,720
be cancelled yet again.

155
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:04,720
So what's going on here?

156
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:09,040
There's two separate things, the logic of the current year argument and the people employing

157
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:10,120
the current year argument.

158
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:12,180
Let's start with the logic first.

159
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:16,000
What a current year argument appeals to is the idea of morality changing over time.

160
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,540
Yeah, I can hear you saying right now, no shit, Dev, but just let me explain it.

161
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:23,920
If somebody were to say the phrase, black people shouldn't be allowed to vote in 2023,

162
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:27,220
it would be reasonable to look at that person strangely and to consider what he says to

163
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:28,460
be immoral and offensive.

164
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:33,100
But if he were to say that phrase back in 1963, two years before the Voting Rights Act

165
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:36,820
of 1965, you would find it to be a reasonably popular position.

166
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:40,580
Even if we consider it immoral today, even if we would have been a part of that segment

167
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:44,620
of the population that considered it immoral back then, there was a decent chunk of the

168
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:46,640
American public that agreed with it.

169
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:50,800
The general morality of our culture has changed from then to now, and talking about the current

170
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:54,200
year is a shorthand way of referencing that moral change.

171
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:58,200
Now, imagine an argument between somebody who genuinely believes that black people shouldn't

172
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:01,400
be allowed to vote in 2023 and someone who disagrees.

173
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:04,320
Assuming they were both reasonable people and it didn't come to violence, it would

174
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,280
probably go something like this.

175
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:09,240
Person A says, I don't think black people should be allowed to vote.

176
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:11,520
Person B says, that's fucking stupid.

177
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:13,360
Person A says, that's an ad hominem.

178
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:17,240
You're attacking me as a person, not actually presenting a counterargument as to why black

179
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:19,080
people should be allowed to vote.

180
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:21,740
Person B would then say, because it's 2023.

181
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:25,440
When Person B brings up the current year, they're not actually making a literal claim

182
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:29,080
that the calendar year somehow influences what moral code we should follow.

183
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:34,380
It's 2023 is shorthand for, your position is so stupid, so indefensible in the face

184
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:38,040
of the evidence that humanity has managed to collect over the years on this topic, that

185
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:41,840
by merely stating it, you have demonstrated that you lack the ability to understand any

186
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:44,460
rational argument I could give you in response.

187
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:48,140
It's like saying, I don't think gravity exists or I think the earth is flat.

188
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:51,720
What's really interesting about this logic is that when Justin Trudeau used it, it was

189
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:54,960
actually exactly what he should have said from his position.

190
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:59,660
Justin Trudeau ran his 2015 campaign with a promise of gender parity in his cabinet.

191
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:03,780
He could have very easily responded to that reporter's question with, well, I ran my campaign

192
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:05,760
with a promise of gender parity in my cabinet.

193
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,720
I was elected with a majority government.

194
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:09,720
Very clearly the people want me to do this.

195
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:11,400
It's popular and it's immoral.

196
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:15,440
Those few people who disagree with me are not only immoral, but unpopular.

197
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:18,560
Therefore you should direct your question to them, but that doesn't have the makings

198
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:19,840
of a viral soundbite.

199
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:24,060
The phrase it's 2015 wraps all of that logic up into just a few seconds.

200
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:28,880
A lot of the initial criticisms of the current year meme were therefore criticisms of progressive

201
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,360
smugness.

202
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:33,540
Progressives back then didn't feel the need to explain this logic.

203
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:36,920
They simply presented it as fact in the most condescending way possible, making it seem

204
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:42,220
like those who questioned their ideas were simply low IQ, backwards, regressive troglodytes

205
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:44,360
that could be dismissed out of hand.

206
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:48,800
Making fun of current yearisms is entertaining, but it also doesn't refute their logic.

207
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:54,440
Shitting on Trudeau for saying it's 2015 isn't the same thing as actually examining his 2015

208
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,880
cabinet picks and analyzing them for any deficiencies.

209
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:01,640
If he actually did that and found glaring problems, his smug statement immediately deflates.

210
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:05,840
His exclamation of it's 2015 now sounds like he's wholly out of touch.

211
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:08,240
However, it's not 2015 anymore.

212
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:12,680
Nowadays, a lot of people don't actually pack in all of that logic into the usage of current

213
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:13,680
year.

214
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:16,740
They simply exclaim it's the current year without thinking and then leave it at that.

215
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:18,440
Like here, I see this sentiment a lot.

216
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:19,440
It's 2023.

217
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,040
Why doesn't America have universal health care?

218
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,520
I think America should, by the way.

219
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:26,000
But what underlying logic is beneath the use of 2023 here?

220
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,120
What's beneath the hood?

221
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:32,360
The answer is a belief in unyielding progress that things should get better over time, will

222
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:33,820
get better over time.

223
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:37,940
It's simply the natural way of the world, and those who impede this march are the enemies

224
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:40,060
of a universal humanity.

225
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:43,140
Explaining this mindset, what it gets right and what it gets wrong, is too big of a topic

226
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:44,140
for this video.

227
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:47,440
But most people who invoke the current year think like this.

228
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,920
As time marches on, things should get better.

229
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,780
And by better, they mean more progressive.

230
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:55,520
And by more progressive, they mean whatever it is that they prefer in the current moment.

231
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:57,360
Which leads us to the other half of the argument.

232
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:59,740
The people employing the current year logic.

233
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:03,660
Joosten, at 35 years old, came out against how quiet was dressed.

234
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:05,480
She defended it back when she was 27.

235
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:07,120
Mariel Cartwright from the Skullgirls video.

236
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:10,600
She was in her early 20s when she defended her sexual expression through her artwork

237
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:13,840
as being sex-positive and progressive and authentically her.

238
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:17,720
She was in her mid-30s when she decided that old artwork needed to be censored.

239
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:21,740
This is, once again, the instance of Egoraptor pulling the ladder up behind him, using slurs

240
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:24,700
when he was younger and edgier to establish a career, and then shitting on people who

241
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:28,900
now use slurs because he's older and tamer and more established.

242
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:31,820
Some feedback that I received in the Skullgirls video made the argument that this is just

243
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:33,420
the normal aging process.

244
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:37,280
We do know that psychologically, when you're young, you're in the exploratory phase of

245
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:38,300
your life.

246
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:42,940
People tend to spend this time exploring radical ideas, or visiting new locations, or enjoying

247
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:44,660
very romantic partners.

248
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:48,680
But once you're a bit older, in your 30s and your 40s, the exploratory period is over.

249
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:50,760
You've largely settled into who you're going to be.

250
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:54,720
And what exists beyond the bounds of your society is generally viewed as less appealing

251
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,340
as it did when you were younger.

252
00:14:56,340 --> 00:15:01,420
Most people tend to stop enjoying edgy humor, or overt sexuality, or novel experiences as

253
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:02,420
they get older.

254
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:05,820
And when older people do enjoy those things again, they often remark about how young they

255
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:06,940
feel when they do it.

256
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:08,900
So yeah, some of this is just maturing.

257
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:11,020
But with maturation should come wisdom.

258
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:14,860
These people should know that even if sexual content, or edgy humor, or whatever else is

259
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:19,100
no longer to their taste, there's a new crop of young people coming up who are in the prime

260
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:22,780
of their exploratory phase, who are going to enjoy it just as they did.

261
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:26,040
But instead of that understanding, we simply see repression.

262
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:30,080
Just as the parents of millennials view Dungeons and Dragons, and video games, and modern music

263
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:35,500
as degenerate and destroying America's children, the parents of zoomers view anti-LGBT acceptance,

264
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:39,360
or edgy jokes about progressive politics, as evidence that fascism is in full bloom

265
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:40,360
once again.

266
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:44,240
This is different language used to describe the same psychological process.

267
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:48,580
Young people are bad because they're doing stuff that I find to be morally reprehensible.

268
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:53,180
Even though when I was their age, I did stuff that older people found to be morally reprehensible.

269
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:54,700
It's not just maturing.

270
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:57,620
If it were, they'd be able to see what's going on here more objectively.

271
00:15:57,620 --> 00:16:02,520
It's the belief that the aforementioned march of progress also includes them on a personal level.

272
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:06,060
If progressivism means that things should get better over time, then as progressive

273
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:11,060
people, whatever moral changes they go through over time is necessarily getting better.

274
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:15,100
Even if that effect is inconsistent between individuals or generations.

275
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:20,020
A millennial progressive who was born in 1990 at 20 years old in 2010 probably believed

276
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:24,320
that being edgy and sexual and irreverent towards authority was progressive activism

277
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:28,760
because that's what the exploratory phase feels like when filtered through progressivism.

278
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:33,480
That same person, as a 33 year old progressive in 2023, likely feels that what progressivism

279
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:37,420
is now is stamping out problematic behavior through censorship, social shaming, maybe

280
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:39,240
even deplatforming or canceling.

281
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:42,220
Because they've moved out of the exploratory phase of their lives.

282
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:45,760
And now their psychology is calling for stability, not exploration.

283
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:49,920
In other words, the normal maturation process has become hijacked by the ideology.

284
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:53,540
And as the progressive progresses through life, what they view as the proper progressive

285
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:56,900
politics will shift in order to match their own life's era.

286
00:16:56,900 --> 00:17:01,380
This also explains why these people tend to use previous years as an insult.

287
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:02,460
You see it a lot.

288
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:06,980
People will say that the gamergate manbabies are stuck in 2014, anti-immigration activists

289
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:10,740
in Britain are stuck in 2015, Trump fans are stuck in 2016.

290
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:13,660
I was recently told that I was stuck in 2018.

291
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:17,740
They regularly fail to recognize that the same logic applies to them.

292
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:20,780
People who are still screaming about COVID are stuck in 2020.

293
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:25,420
People who complain about the neo cons or the religious right are stuck in fucking 2008.

294
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:29,540
But more importantly, there's a baked in assumption that newer is better, more modern,

295
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:32,560
more progressive, more moral, and that if you haven't caught up to the current standard,

296
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:36,660
you're somehow inferior, even if the current standard is actually worse than the previous

297
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:37,660
one.

298
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:40,420
When a person like this says it's the current year, what they're basically saying is that

299
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:44,300
they had a utopian expectation of where society should be by the time they grew up.

300
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:46,800
And now that they've grown up and realize we're not there, and in many cases will

301
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:48,880
never be there, they're bitter.

302
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:52,200
Sometimes that bitterness drives them towards more extreme politics in a desperate attempt

303
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:54,120
to bring about that utopia.

304
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:57,900
Sometimes it leads them to stagnating or regressing in life, believing that if the future only

305
00:17:57,900 --> 00:18:00,860
arrives when they're an adult and the future isn't here yet, then they have to still

306
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:04,440
be young, even if they're actually just a 40 year old man baby.

307
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:06,960
And sometimes they just stop being progressives.

308
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:11,120
In any case, a lot of modern progressivism is a refusal to deal with the world as it

309
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:12,120
is.

310
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:16,520
And most current year arguments are basically the speaker voicing their frustration that

311
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:20,320
their life hasn't turned out the way they wanted it to, and that it's everyone else's

312
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:21,320
fault.

313
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:25,760
Probably the most pure, blatant, mask-off version of this logic is Moviebob's Twitter

314
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:26,760
feed.

315
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:30,160
I am genuinely convinced that what he's saying openly is what simmers onto the surface

316
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,580
of every radicalized, bitter utopian.

317
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:36,040
We all be better off recognizing that just because time marches on, whatever it brings

318
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:37,940
is not automatically going to be good.

319
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:41,120
That progress looks differently to different people, because to progress means to move

320
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,120
towards a goal.

321
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:45,280
And if different people have different goals, then movement will look very different from

322
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:46,680
each point of view.

323
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:50,880
Sometimes we do luck out and discover a new way that is just blanket better than the previous.

324
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:53,720
But for most things, change is not automatically good.

325
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:55,520
Progress is not automatically good.

326
00:18:55,520 --> 00:19:01,000
Option B is not a blanket upgrade from option A. It simply has different positives and negatives

327
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,880
that we need to weigh, and everyone will come to a different answer based on their own interests.

328
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,700
Here's an example of what I mean.

329
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:09,840
Is the world better now that we can order anything we like off of Amazon?

330
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:11,480
I mean, yeah, that's progress.

331
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:16,320
I can now pay less money to get a toolkit delivered to my house than it cost me 30 years

332
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:20,320
ago to go out and buy a less advanced version of those same tools.

333
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:25,200
That is 100% an improvement of my material conditions as a working class guy.

334
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:29,280
Looking at this in terms of progress, the new way is better than the old, simple as.

335
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:30,400
But is it really?

336
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,100
What's been lost that I'm not considering?

337
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:34,880
I no longer have to ask my neighbor to borrow his tools.

338
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:37,200
That's less humiliating for me and less annoying for him.

339
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:41,920
But now I also have one less material reason to maintain a relationship with him.

340
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:45,720
Close-knit communities are partially based on material need, where relationships are

341
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:50,040
maintained because that guy is your toolkit, and that guy can fix your car, and in return

342
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:53,120
you babysit their kids or you tutor them or something.

343
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:56,560
Increased economic productiveness has brought about the disintegration of close-knit communities

344
00:19:56,560 --> 00:20:00,060
because relationships of necessity are no longer necessary.

345
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:01,060
Is this good?

346
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:02,060
I don't know.

347
00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:05,080
It might actually be better this way, but it is a trade-off.

348
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:10,160
We gained something, more access to material goods, but we also lost something, a close-knit

349
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:14,360
community, and to simply declare that because it's newer it is therefore blanket better

350
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:15,360
is stupid.

351
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:19,540
When I made my nostalgia as fascism video, I also discussed this idea.

352
00:20:19,540 --> 00:20:23,440
Things are not simply better because they're new, and things were not bad simply because

353
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:24,440
they were old.

354
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:28,560
The reason you see attempts online to discredit the past is because progressive ideology demands

355
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:29,560
it.

356
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:33,160
The future must be better, therefore the past must be worse, and anything from the past

357
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:37,240
that could have been better, even if only to some people, has to be erased.

358
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:41,360
The radical has to make it so that their new regime is the only regime even throughout

359
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:42,360
history.

360
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:46,320
This is why Islamists destroy Buddhist monuments, communists restart the calendar at the new

361
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:50,320
year zero, progressives tear down statues of America's founding fathers, and Nazis

362
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:51,320
burn books.

363
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:55,040
And yes, although it's at a much smaller scale, the same psychological impulse is why

364
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:59,680
people censor old edgy content in video games because their current politics doesn't approve

365
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:00,680
of them.

366
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:04,440
What motivates all of this is a belief that the current year is the enlightened utopia,

367
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:08,800
the previous year is the regressive dark age, and when time marches on, the calendar flips

368
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:12,560
over, what was once the enlightened utopia will become the regressive dark age, even

369
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:16,720
if nothing's actually changed, even if things have gotten worse, because the only time that

370
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,960
exists for these people is right now.

371
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:22,960
In replacing tradition with progress, they've replaced a continuum that stretches across

372
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:27,160
the ages in both directions, of which they are only a small part, with a single moment

373
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:31,280
centered on them, existing eternally, right up until the final second before reality comes

374
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:31,880
crashing down.
