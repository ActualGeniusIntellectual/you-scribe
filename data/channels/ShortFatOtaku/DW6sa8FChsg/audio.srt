1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,720
No announcements. No, nothing to talk about.

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:05,040
Let's get right to the TikToks.

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:07,120
Thanks for everyone who sent these to me, by the way.

4
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:09,360
I... I kind of appreciate it.

5
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:11,600
Well, good morning, guys.

6
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:12,080
Good morning.

7
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:13,840
So we are day two post-op.

8
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:18,720
My surgeon came in earlier this morning, and he...

9
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:20,240
Oh, is this like a trans man?

10
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:21,360
I haven't seen a picture of it yet, but I'm like...

11
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:22,400
Like female to male?

12
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:23,520
No, I haven't even seen it yet.

13
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:28,240
Well, he pulled out his phone, showed me a picture of what my

14
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:30,720
new vagina looked like.

15
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:31,220
What?

16
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:33,200
Directly after surgery.

17
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,640
And I gotta say, I...

18
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:36,880
New vagina?

19
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:40,000
It's beautiful.

20
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:42,480
It looks real.

21
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:47,280
It looks like I was alone when it seemed to belong with it, but...

22
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:50,560
He's amazing.

23
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:52,000
His work is absolutely amazing.

24
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:54,480
I want you guys to know that I'm doing great.

25
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,240
I'm a little uncomfortable, but...

26
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:57,380
Uh-huh.

27
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:00,480
I'm feeling kind of uncomfortable too, buddy.

28
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:01,280
That was...

29
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:02,320
That was a roller coaster.

30
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:02,560
Okay.

31
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:03,360
So when...

32
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:04,800
Oh, my God.

33
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:09,360
When the TikTok started, I thought that we were looking at a trans man.

34
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:10,880
So a female to male person, right?

35
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:14,240
So someone who was born female and then gets a sex change to have, like,

36
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:17,760
a Franken-dick put in in order to be more masculine.

37
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:21,520
Because, you know, the facial hair, the face structure, the voice,

38
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:23,280
it all screamed masculine to me.

39
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:24,960
So I thought this was a female to male.

40
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:29,680
But no, this is a guy, like, a biological male who had a vagina put in,

41
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,360
but he didn't even transition.

42
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,280
Like, he's not, like, appearing as a woman.

43
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:36,960
He's not, like, pulling a Blair White or something where he actually, like, passes.

44
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,960
It's just a guy with a vagina.

45
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:45,440
People are getting alternate genitals put in now without even attempting to pass.

46
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:47,040
Like, this isn't a trans woman.

47
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,480
This is a man with a vagina.

48
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:51,060
Okay.

49
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,680
Oh, police on your action.

50
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:56,240
Wait, lady.

51
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,040
Well, you didn't put your car, like, what the-

52
00:01:59,040 --> 00:01:59,540
Damn!

53
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,040
What the fuck?

54
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,160
You didn't put your car in park?

55
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,040
Girl, I thought you had a partner.

56
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:09,840
Get on your knees.

57
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:11,600
Stay on your knees.

58
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:13,600
Say I need me to get up and get on your knees.

59
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:14,960
Damn, I wish you would hit my car.

60
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,360
Oh my god.

61
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,480
What a shit show.

62
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:21,840
I know for a fact there's been some decent, like, female police officers.

63
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:24,320
But all the new female police officers that are coming up

64
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:28,560
that keep going viral, they're all, like, one, really bad at being cops.

65
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,320
And two, they're all kind of overweight.

66
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:31,280
Like, what the fuck?

67
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,600
You think there'd be a mandatory physical you have to pass to be a cop

68
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,680
because you have to, like, chase down suspects sometimes.

69
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:39,840
Like, there's no way this chick is catching anyone in a chase.

70
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,640
This one doesn't have sound and it was named

71
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:45,760
whitewoman.mov when the person sent it to me.

72
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:46,720
Let's see what this is.

73
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:49,360
Walk out naked in front of your boyfriend challenge.

74
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,080
All right.

75
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,840
I don't have a boyfriend so I did it for my family.

76
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:52,400
No!

77
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,120
No, don't do it.

78
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:56,800
Oh, it's...

79
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,640
The dog pill returns.

80
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:03,200
You know what?

81
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:08,240
Okay, so the dog pill video, it was banned off of the main channel by YouTube.

82
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:11,760
It was banned off of the demonetized channel by YouTube.

83
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,280
It's only on Bitchute.

84
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:13,920
But you know what?

85
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:19,760
I've been saving up sources and links and, like, resources for

86
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:23,680
Dog Pill 2 coming soon to an SFO near you.

87
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:24,960
Whoa!

88
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:29,120
People stealing merch during an active shooting?

89
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:32,800
Wow, holy shit.

90
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,080
Yep, they're just...

91
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:41,280
They're just looting the place dry, man.

92
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,640
They're stealing everything.

93
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:49,600
Damn, dude.

94
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:54,960
People just don't give a shit anymore.

95
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:55,760
That's all it is, man.

96
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:56,240
That's all it is.

97
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,440
People just don't give a shit anymore.

98
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:57,840
I haven't...

99
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:01,520
I've spoken a lot about, you know, low and high trust societies on this channel.

100
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:04,320
You guys know what's going on at this point, but there's just like...

101
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:06,400
Yeah, there's just no sense of decency now.

102
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:10,000
The psychological idea here is that if you actually believe the world's going to end

103
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,520
soon, there is no future.

104
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:14,000
Like, everything is just unstable and falling apart.

105
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,560
Why wouldn't you just get while the getting's good?

106
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,880
Why wouldn't you just pursue the short-term immediate benefit?

107
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:22,400
That makes sense if you believe that there's no point in saving up for a rainy day.

108
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:25,280
But the natural side effect of that is this sort of lawlessness, right?

109
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:29,040
Part of having a high trust society is having confidence in the system.

110
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,880
Because if people did, they wouldn't be acting like this.

111
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,280
Oh, it's a robbery.

112
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,240
No one's doing shit.

113
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:50,400
Well, he got one phone out of it.

114
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,440
He got one phone out of it.

115
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,920
Yeah, no one gives a fuck, dude.

116
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,640
Yep, just walk right out.

117
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:05,200
I feel like I might have reacted to this one in a previous TikTok Tuesday.

118
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:07,280
Or maybe it was just on Twitter or something, I don't know.

119
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:09,680
Man, how jaded do you have to be?

120
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:12,960
You just don't care when someone bursts into screaming, giving you all the money.

121
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:16,320
And also, how pathetic do you have to be, as a robber,

122
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,960
that you just, like, sigh and give up and walk away?

123
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:19,920
He did get one phone out of it.

124
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:22,080
He grabbed that one woman's phone out of her hand.

125
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,600
She probably should have just, like, put it away and been like,

126
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,560
I don't have anything, sorry.

127
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:28,240
What's going on here is that people know he doesn't have a gun underneath that purse.

128
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,480
And people also know he's not gonna shoot them even if he did.

129
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:32,160
What a pathetic state of affairs.

130
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:35,840
Hold on, hold on, the music, the music.

131
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:36,800
I gotta meet the music, okay.

132
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,720
I gotta meet the music so I don't get copyright.

133
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,640
What the fuck am I looking at?

134
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:42,160
It looks like an animatronic.

135
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,360
That face, dude.

136
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:48,240
It looked like, man, I don't know, like, a Star Trek alien makeup or something.

137
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,200
I don't know, man.

138
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,880
Oh, Jesus, that scared me a little bit.

139
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,480
Vibrator on the drawing mat.

140
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,680
Oh, God, what is this?

141
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:02,880
Oh, God, living with women.

142
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,080
Now, listen, hold on, like, if you're in, like, a relationship

143
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,400
and it's like a guy and a girl and they live together,

144
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:11,760
that can, you know, generally be okay as long as your relationship is decent,

145
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:12,640
your partner is decent.

146
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:16,000
But, like, a bunch of guys living together, like, during college or after college,

147
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,120
they can be a little bit messy.

148
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,280
But listen, for those of you guys who don't know,

149
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:23,760
a bunch of girls living together, like, during or shortly after college,

150
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:25,600
they can be fucking foul.

151
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,880
Like, they can be disgusting.

152
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,720
This is, like, this is kind of related to the whole, like,

153
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:32,800
girls' private washrooms are actually just as disgusting, if not more so,

154
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,320
than boys' private washrooms.

155
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:35,280
Same kind of idea.

156
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:39,280
Imagine what kind of a person you have to be to, like,

157
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:43,760
wash your vibrator and then dry it in the drawing rack in the kitchen.

158
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:46,640
Like, what the fuck?

159
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:49,940
What?

160
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,200
Oh, I know you want me.

161
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:54,580
No!

162
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:57,440
No, I don't.

163
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:00,800
Yeah, I am.

164
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:01,840
Come and get me.

165
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,120
She has a front butt.

166
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:07,280
Guys, like, I should probably start screening these before I start doing them on the show.

167
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:09,200
What the fuck are you guys sending me?

168
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:12,160
Like, it's not even something I can really comment on.

169
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:12,960
It's just, like, here.

170
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:18,480
Here's 10 seconds of freakishness so that Dev and all the viewers will have nightmares tonight.

171
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,120
Thanks.

172
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,480
You guys are the best fans.

173
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:26,080
Holy shit!

174
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,600
Like, she's really cute, but-

175
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,080
What the fuck?

176
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:36,820
Jesus.

177
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:41,200
Hold on, hold on.

178
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:41,920
I got stunned.

179
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,680
I gotta watch that final bit again.

180
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:44,240
Hold on.

181
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,200
There is no price limit.

182
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,160
Whatever I pick out.

183
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:50,160
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

184
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,800
Let me recompose myself.

185
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:56,480
I'm about to go, like, full misogynist mode.

186
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:59,120
Okay, so, straight up, that first girl is cute.

187
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,080
9 out of 10 level.

188
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:00,720
But I don't care.

189
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,080
I don't care how cute you are.

190
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:06,160
That screaming $500,000, use all your savings.

191
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:10,640
She instantly went from, like, 9 out of 10 looks to 0 out of 10 personality.

192
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:11,600
Fuck this bitch.

193
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:16,000
And then that chick at the end, who is not nearly as cute as her friend,

194
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,080
that jaw of hers slides into frame and is like, there's actually no price limit.

195
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,440
Whatever I pick out, you buy.

196
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:22,960
Fuck these women, dude.

197
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:23,840
You know that song?

198
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:26,080
If you want to be happy for the rest of your life.

199
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,680
Yes, choose the ugly girl.

200
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,920
Because at least they won't give you headaches like this.

201
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:32,400
Their youth and their beauty will eventually fade.

202
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:34,720
But a good personality will last.

203
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,400
Doesn't matter if she's a 9 out of 10.

204
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:38,160
Doesn't matter if she's a 10 out of 10.

205
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:39,680
She ain't worth this.

206
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:40,400
Period.

207
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:40,960
Cheese.

208
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,480
You make an entire mac and cheese, baby.

209
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,360
They don't finish it.

210
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,960
I always ended up throwing it away.

211
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:48,000
But let me show you something that will absolutely change your life.

212
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,480
Do not throw away the leftover mac and cheese.

213
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:53,440
What you're going to do is take any containers you guys have,

214
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:56,480
put them in the containers, cover them with some saran wrap.

215
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,720
You invented leftovers, lady.

216
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:01,600
I know leftover mac and cheese might sound gross.

217
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,840
I promise you, it is not.

218
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,680
You're going to take them and put them in the freezer.

219
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:06,240
Oh my God.

220
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,480
Now, honestly, the first time I did this hack, I'm like,

221
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,920
Oh, it's a hack now?

222
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:12,640
It's a hack to fucking save your goddamn food?

223
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:17,680
Now have serving size cups fit in any microwavable safe dish.

224
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:17,920
Yeah.

225
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:18,880
It pops out really easy.

226
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:19,600
You heat it up.

227
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,360
Especially if it's a plastic container you put it in.

228
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,520
Put in the microwave for 30 second intervals.

229
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:24,080
Oh my God.

230
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:27,040
Then you add a splash of water just so it can retain that moisture.

231
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:29,360
And you've got mac and cheese.

232
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:33,760
Three easy, ready to go lunches for my toddler that I know she won't refuse.

233
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:36,160
What kind of life does this person fucking come from?

234
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:37,760
They don't know what leftovers are.

235
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,840
Like I'm genuinely stunned at this.

236
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:41,440
I actually knew someone like this.

237
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,680
I had a roommate back in college.

238
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:46,480
Basically the house that I lived in in college was kind of a revolving door.

239
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,000
Like a bunch of people coming in and out.

240
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,280
You know how it is sometimes.

241
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:54,560
And one girl showed up for one semester and she never saved any leftovers.

242
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:55,680
She would just throw it out.

243
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,120
She'd make a whole pot of spaghetti.

244
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,680
She'd have like one bowl for dinner.

245
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:00,880
And then she just dump it.

246
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,080
I'm like, what the fuck?

247
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,680
You don't put it in the fridge?

248
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:04,880
She's like, I don't like leftovers.

249
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,800
She's like, well, why do you cook that much then?

250
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:09,040
It was astonishing to me.

251
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:14,400
Like I can only assume that she came from a life so pampered that she didn't have to

252
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:15,680
worry about a grocery budget.

253
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:18,160
All right, my friends, that's the end of TikTok Tuesday.

254
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,680
Another week crossed off.

255
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:22,000
Thanks very much to everyone who's been giving me these things.

256
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,400
By the way, if you want to send them to me, send them to me on Twitter,

257
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:25,360
send them to me on Discord.

258
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,720
The two best places to do it.

259
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:29,280
Some people have been asking me, Dev, how do I send these TikToks to you?

260
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:30,240
That's where you do it, man.

261
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,520
DM me on Discord.

262
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:32,640
Post them at me on Twitter.

263
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:33,680
I'll make sure to see them.

264
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:37,520
In any case, have a good rest of your day, my friends.

265
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:39,120
Oh, drop by the stream tonight, OK?

266
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,000
Come by and say hi.

267
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:40,800
Have a good one.

268
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:41,360
I love you.
