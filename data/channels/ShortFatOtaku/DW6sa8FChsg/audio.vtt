00:00.000 --> 00:02.720
No announcements. No, nothing to talk about.

00:02.720 --> 00:05.040
Let's get right to the TikToks.

00:05.040 --> 00:07.120
Thanks for everyone who sent these to me, by the way.

00:07.120 --> 00:09.360
I... I kind of appreciate it.

00:09.360 --> 00:11.600
Well, good morning, guys.

00:11.600 --> 00:12.080
Good morning.

00:12.080 --> 00:13.840
So we are day two post-op.

00:15.840 --> 00:18.720
My surgeon came in earlier this morning, and he...

00:18.720 --> 00:20.240
Oh, is this like a trans man?

00:20.240 --> 00:21.360
I haven't seen a picture of it yet, but I'm like...

00:21.360 --> 00:22.400
Like female to male?

00:22.400 --> 00:23.520
No, I haven't even seen it yet.

00:24.720 --> 00:28.240
Well, he pulled out his phone, showed me a picture of what my

00:29.200 --> 00:30.720
new vagina looked like.

00:30.720 --> 00:31.220
What?

00:31.680 --> 00:33.200
Directly after surgery.

00:33.200 --> 00:34.640
And I gotta say, I...

00:35.840 --> 00:36.880
New vagina?

00:39.280 --> 00:40.000
It's beautiful.

00:41.280 --> 00:42.480
It looks real.

00:42.480 --> 00:47.280
It looks like I was alone when it seemed to belong with it, but...

00:49.840 --> 00:50.560
He's amazing.

00:50.560 --> 00:52.000
His work is absolutely amazing.

00:52.640 --> 00:54.480
I want you guys to know that I'm doing great.

00:54.480 --> 00:56.240
I'm a little uncomfortable, but...

00:56.880 --> 00:57.380
Uh-huh.

00:58.560 --> 01:00.480
I'm feeling kind of uncomfortable too, buddy.

01:00.480 --> 01:01.280
That was...

01:01.280 --> 01:02.320
That was a roller coaster.

01:02.320 --> 01:02.560
Okay.

01:02.560 --> 01:03.360
So when...

01:04.080 --> 01:04.800
Oh, my God.

01:04.800 --> 01:09.360
When the TikTok started, I thought that we were looking at a trans man.

01:09.360 --> 01:10.880
So a female to male person, right?

01:10.880 --> 01:14.240
So someone who was born female and then gets a sex change to have, like,

01:14.240 --> 01:17.760
a Franken-dick put in in order to be more masculine.

01:17.760 --> 01:21.520
Because, you know, the facial hair, the face structure, the voice,

01:21.520 --> 01:23.280
it all screamed masculine to me.

01:23.280 --> 01:24.960
So I thought this was a female to male.

01:24.960 --> 01:29.680
But no, this is a guy, like, a biological male who had a vagina put in,

01:29.680 --> 01:31.360
but he didn't even transition.

01:31.360 --> 01:33.280
Like, he's not, like, appearing as a woman.

01:33.280 --> 01:36.960
He's not, like, pulling a Blair White or something where he actually, like, passes.

01:36.960 --> 01:38.960
It's just a guy with a vagina.

01:38.960 --> 01:45.440
People are getting alternate genitals put in now without even attempting to pass.

01:45.440 --> 01:47.040
Like, this isn't a trans woman.

01:47.040 --> 01:48.480
This is a man with a vagina.

01:50.560 --> 01:51.060
Okay.

01:52.400 --> 01:53.680
Oh, police on your action.

01:55.440 --> 01:56.240
Wait, lady.

01:57.280 --> 01:59.040
Well, you didn't put your car, like, what the-

01:59.040 --> 01:59.540
Damn!

02:00.320 --> 02:01.040
What the fuck?

02:02.560 --> 02:04.160
You didn't put your car in park?

02:07.520 --> 02:09.040
Girl, I thought you had a partner.

02:09.040 --> 02:09.840
Get on your knees.

02:10.880 --> 02:11.600
Stay on your knees.

02:11.600 --> 02:13.600
Say I need me to get up and get on your knees.

02:13.600 --> 02:14.960
Damn, I wish you would hit my car.

02:16.160 --> 02:17.360
Oh my god.

02:17.360 --> 02:18.480
What a shit show.

02:18.480 --> 02:21.840
I know for a fact there's been some decent, like, female police officers.

02:21.840 --> 02:24.320
But all the new female police officers that are coming up

02:24.320 --> 02:28.560
that keep going viral, they're all, like, one, really bad at being cops.

02:28.560 --> 02:30.320
And two, they're all kind of overweight.

02:30.320 --> 02:31.280
Like, what the fuck?

02:31.280 --> 02:33.600
You think there'd be a mandatory physical you have to pass to be a cop

02:33.600 --> 02:35.680
because you have to, like, chase down suspects sometimes.

02:35.680 --> 02:39.840
Like, there's no way this chick is catching anyone in a chase.

02:39.840 --> 02:42.640
This one doesn't have sound and it was named

02:42.640 --> 02:45.760
whitewoman.mov when the person sent it to me.

02:45.760 --> 02:46.720
Let's see what this is.

02:46.720 --> 02:49.360
Walk out naked in front of your boyfriend challenge.

02:49.360 --> 02:50.080
All right.

02:50.080 --> 02:51.840
I don't have a boyfriend so I did it for my family.

02:51.840 --> 02:52.400
No!

02:52.400 --> 02:53.120
No, don't do it.

02:53.760 --> 02:56.800
Oh, it's...

03:00.800 --> 03:02.640
The dog pill returns.

03:02.640 --> 03:03.200
You know what?

03:03.840 --> 03:08.240
Okay, so the dog pill video, it was banned off of the main channel by YouTube.

03:08.240 --> 03:11.760
It was banned off of the demonetized channel by YouTube.

03:11.760 --> 03:13.280
It's only on Bitchute.

03:13.280 --> 03:13.920
But you know what?

03:14.480 --> 03:19.760
I've been saving up sources and links and, like, resources for

03:19.760 --> 03:23.680
Dog Pill 2 coming soon to an SFO near you.

03:24.640 --> 03:24.960
Whoa!

03:26.160 --> 03:29.120
People stealing merch during an active shooting?

03:30.880 --> 03:32.800
Wow, holy shit.

03:37.360 --> 03:38.080
Yep, they're just...

03:38.880 --> 03:41.280
They're just looting the place dry, man.

03:41.280 --> 03:42.640
They're stealing everything.

03:42.640 --> 03:49.600
Damn, dude.

03:53.440 --> 03:54.960
People just don't give a shit anymore.

03:54.960 --> 03:55.760
That's all it is, man.

03:55.760 --> 03:56.240
That's all it is.

03:56.240 --> 03:57.440
People just don't give a shit anymore.

03:57.440 --> 03:57.840
I haven't...

03:57.840 --> 04:01.520
I've spoken a lot about, you know, low and high trust societies on this channel.

04:01.520 --> 04:04.320
You guys know what's going on at this point, but there's just like...

04:04.320 --> 04:06.400
Yeah, there's just no sense of decency now.

04:06.400 --> 04:10.000
The psychological idea here is that if you actually believe the world's going to end

04:10.000 --> 04:11.520
soon, there is no future.

04:11.520 --> 04:14.000
Like, everything is just unstable and falling apart.

04:14.000 --> 04:16.560
Why wouldn't you just get while the getting's good?

04:16.560 --> 04:18.880
Why wouldn't you just pursue the short-term immediate benefit?

04:18.880 --> 04:22.400
That makes sense if you believe that there's no point in saving up for a rainy day.

04:22.400 --> 04:25.280
But the natural side effect of that is this sort of lawlessness, right?

04:25.280 --> 04:29.040
Part of having a high trust society is having confidence in the system.

04:29.040 --> 04:30.880
Because if people did, they wouldn't be acting like this.

04:32.320 --> 04:33.280
Oh, it's a robbery.

04:37.120 --> 04:38.240
No one's doing shit.

04:40.000 --> 04:50.400
Well, he got one phone out of it.

04:50.400 --> 04:51.440
He got one phone out of it.

04:54.400 --> 04:55.920
Yeah, no one gives a fuck, dude.

04:59.040 --> 05:00.640
Yep, just walk right out.

05:01.520 --> 05:05.200
I feel like I might have reacted to this one in a previous TikTok Tuesday.

05:05.200 --> 05:07.280
Or maybe it was just on Twitter or something, I don't know.

05:07.280 --> 05:09.680
Man, how jaded do you have to be?

05:09.680 --> 05:12.960
You just don't care when someone bursts into screaming, giving you all the money.

05:12.960 --> 05:16.320
And also, how pathetic do you have to be, as a robber,

05:16.320 --> 05:18.960
that you just, like, sigh and give up and walk away?

05:18.960 --> 05:19.920
He did get one phone out of it.

05:19.920 --> 05:22.080
He grabbed that one woman's phone out of her hand.

05:22.080 --> 05:23.600
She probably should have just, like, put it away and been like,

05:23.600 --> 05:24.560
I don't have anything, sorry.

05:24.560 --> 05:28.240
What's going on here is that people know he doesn't have a gun underneath that purse.

05:28.240 --> 05:30.480
And people also know he's not gonna shoot them even if he did.

05:30.480 --> 05:32.160
What a pathetic state of affairs.

05:34.720 --> 05:35.840
Hold on, hold on, the music, the music.

05:35.840 --> 05:36.800
I gotta meet the music, okay.

05:36.800 --> 05:38.720
I gotta meet the music so I don't get copyright.

05:38.720 --> 05:40.640
What the fuck am I looking at?

05:40.640 --> 05:42.160
It looks like an animatronic.

05:42.160 --> 05:43.360
That face, dude.

05:43.360 --> 05:48.240
It looked like, man, I don't know, like, a Star Trek alien makeup or something.

05:48.240 --> 05:49.200
I don't know, man.

05:49.200 --> 05:50.880
Oh, Jesus, that scared me a little bit.

05:50.880 --> 05:52.480
Vibrator on the drawing mat.

05:52.480 --> 05:53.680
Oh, God, what is this?

06:00.480 --> 06:02.880
Oh, God, living with women.

06:04.240 --> 06:06.080
Now, listen, hold on, like, if you're in, like, a relationship

06:06.080 --> 06:08.400
and it's like a guy and a girl and they live together,

06:08.400 --> 06:11.760
that can, you know, generally be okay as long as your relationship is decent,

06:11.760 --> 06:12.640
your partner is decent.

06:12.640 --> 06:16.000
But, like, a bunch of guys living together, like, during college or after college,

06:16.000 --> 06:17.120
they can be a little bit messy.

06:17.120 --> 06:19.280
But listen, for those of you guys who don't know,

06:19.280 --> 06:23.760
a bunch of girls living together, like, during or shortly after college,

06:23.760 --> 06:25.600
they can be fucking foul.

06:25.600 --> 06:26.880
Like, they can be disgusting.

06:26.880 --> 06:28.720
This is, like, this is kind of related to the whole, like,

06:28.720 --> 06:32.800
girls' private washrooms are actually just as disgusting, if not more so,

06:32.800 --> 06:34.320
than boys' private washrooms.

06:34.320 --> 06:35.280
Same kind of idea.

06:35.280 --> 06:39.280
Imagine what kind of a person you have to be to, like,

06:39.280 --> 06:43.760
wash your vibrator and then dry it in the drawing rack in the kitchen.

06:43.760 --> 06:46.640
Like, what the fuck?

06:49.440 --> 06:49.940
What?

06:51.360 --> 06:53.200
Oh, I know you want me.

06:54.080 --> 06:54.580
No!

06:56.640 --> 06:57.440
No, I don't.

06:59.840 --> 07:00.800
Yeah, I am.

07:00.800 --> 07:01.840
Come and get me.

07:01.840 --> 07:03.120
She has a front butt.

07:03.120 --> 07:07.280
Guys, like, I should probably start screening these before I start doing them on the show.

07:07.280 --> 07:09.200
What the fuck are you guys sending me?

07:09.200 --> 07:12.160
Like, it's not even something I can really comment on.

07:12.160 --> 07:12.960
It's just, like, here.

07:12.960 --> 07:18.480
Here's 10 seconds of freakishness so that Dev and all the viewers will have nightmares tonight.

07:18.480 --> 07:19.120
Thanks.

07:19.120 --> 07:20.480
You guys are the best fans.

07:25.440 --> 07:26.080
Holy shit!

07:27.920 --> 07:29.600
Like, she's really cute, but-

07:33.440 --> 07:34.080
What the fuck?

07:36.320 --> 07:36.820
Jesus.

07:40.320 --> 07:41.200
Hold on, hold on.

07:41.200 --> 07:41.920
I got stunned.

07:41.920 --> 07:43.680
I gotta watch that final bit again.

07:43.680 --> 07:44.240
Hold on.

07:44.240 --> 07:45.200
There is no price limit.

07:45.200 --> 07:46.160
Whatever I pick out.

07:47.360 --> 07:50.160
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

07:50.160 --> 07:52.800
Let me recompose myself.

07:53.440 --> 07:56.480
I'm about to go, like, full misogynist mode.

07:56.480 --> 07:59.120
Okay, so, straight up, that first girl is cute.

07:59.120 --> 08:00.080
9 out of 10 level.

08:00.080 --> 08:00.720
But I don't care.

08:00.720 --> 08:02.080
I don't care how cute you are.

08:02.080 --> 08:06.160
That screaming $500,000, use all your savings.

08:06.160 --> 08:10.640
She instantly went from, like, 9 out of 10 looks to 0 out of 10 personality.

08:10.640 --> 08:11.600
Fuck this bitch.

08:11.600 --> 08:16.000
And then that chick at the end, who is not nearly as cute as her friend,

08:16.000 --> 08:20.080
that jaw of hers slides into frame and is like, there's actually no price limit.

08:20.080 --> 08:21.440
Whatever I pick out, you buy.

08:21.440 --> 08:22.960
Fuck these women, dude.

08:22.960 --> 08:23.840
You know that song?

08:23.840 --> 08:26.080
If you want to be happy for the rest of your life.

08:26.080 --> 08:27.680
Yes, choose the ugly girl.

08:27.680 --> 08:29.920
Because at least they won't give you headaches like this.

08:29.920 --> 08:32.400
Their youth and their beauty will eventually fade.

08:32.400 --> 08:34.720
But a good personality will last.

08:34.720 --> 08:36.400
Doesn't matter if she's a 9 out of 10.

08:36.400 --> 08:38.160
Doesn't matter if she's a 10 out of 10.

08:38.160 --> 08:39.680
She ain't worth this.

08:39.680 --> 08:40.400
Period.

08:40.400 --> 08:40.960
Cheese.

08:40.960 --> 08:42.480
You make an entire mac and cheese, baby.

08:42.480 --> 08:43.360
They don't finish it.

08:43.360 --> 08:44.960
I always ended up throwing it away.

08:44.960 --> 08:48.000
But let me show you something that will absolutely change your life.

08:48.000 --> 08:50.480
Do not throw away the leftover mac and cheese.

08:50.480 --> 08:53.440
What you're going to do is take any containers you guys have,

08:53.440 --> 08:56.480
put them in the containers, cover them with some saran wrap.

08:56.480 --> 08:58.720
You invented leftovers, lady.

08:58.720 --> 09:01.600
I know leftover mac and cheese might sound gross.

09:01.600 --> 09:03.840
I promise you, it is not.

09:03.840 --> 09:05.680
You're going to take them and put them in the freezer.

09:05.680 --> 09:06.240
Oh my God.

09:06.240 --> 09:08.480
Now, honestly, the first time I did this hack, I'm like,

09:08.480 --> 09:09.920
Oh, it's a hack now?

09:09.920 --> 09:12.640
It's a hack to fucking save your goddamn food?

09:12.640 --> 09:17.680
Now have serving size cups fit in any microwavable safe dish.

09:17.680 --> 09:17.920
Yeah.

09:17.920 --> 09:18.880
It pops out really easy.

09:18.880 --> 09:19.600
You heat it up.

09:19.600 --> 09:21.360
Especially if it's a plastic container you put it in.

09:21.360 --> 09:23.520
Put in the microwave for 30 second intervals.

09:23.520 --> 09:24.080
Oh my God.

09:24.080 --> 09:27.040
Then you add a splash of water just so it can retain that moisture.

09:27.520 --> 09:29.360
And you've got mac and cheese.

09:29.360 --> 09:33.760
Three easy, ready to go lunches for my toddler that I know she won't refuse.

09:33.760 --> 09:36.160
What kind of life does this person fucking come from?

09:36.160 --> 09:37.760
They don't know what leftovers are.

09:37.760 --> 09:39.840
Like I'm genuinely stunned at this.

09:39.840 --> 09:41.440
I actually knew someone like this.

09:41.440 --> 09:43.680
I had a roommate back in college.

09:43.680 --> 09:46.480
Basically the house that I lived in in college was kind of a revolving door.

09:46.480 --> 09:48.000
Like a bunch of people coming in and out.

09:48.000 --> 09:49.280
You know how it is sometimes.

09:49.280 --> 09:54.560
And one girl showed up for one semester and she never saved any leftovers.

09:54.560 --> 09:55.680
She would just throw it out.

09:55.760 --> 09:57.120
She'd make a whole pot of spaghetti.

09:57.120 --> 09:59.680
She'd have like one bowl for dinner.

09:59.680 --> 10:00.880
And then she just dump it.

10:00.880 --> 10:02.080
I'm like, what the fuck?

10:02.080 --> 10:03.680
You don't put it in the fridge?

10:03.680 --> 10:04.880
She's like, I don't like leftovers.

10:04.880 --> 10:06.800
She's like, well, why do you cook that much then?

10:06.800 --> 10:09.040
It was astonishing to me.

10:09.040 --> 10:14.400
Like I can only assume that she came from a life so pampered that she didn't have to

10:14.400 --> 10:15.680
worry about a grocery budget.

10:15.680 --> 10:18.160
All right, my friends, that's the end of TikTok Tuesday.

10:18.160 --> 10:19.680
Another week crossed off.

10:19.680 --> 10:22.000
Thanks very much to everyone who's been giving me these things.

10:22.000 --> 10:24.400
By the way, if you want to send them to me, send them to me on Twitter,

10:24.400 --> 10:25.360
send them to me on Discord.

10:25.360 --> 10:26.720
The two best places to do it.

10:26.720 --> 10:29.280
Some people have been asking me, Dev, how do I send these TikToks to you?

10:29.280 --> 10:30.240
That's where you do it, man.

10:30.240 --> 10:31.520
DM me on Discord.

10:31.520 --> 10:32.640
Post them at me on Twitter.

10:32.640 --> 10:33.680
I'll make sure to see them.

10:33.680 --> 10:37.520
In any case, have a good rest of your day, my friends.

10:37.520 --> 10:39.120
Oh, drop by the stream tonight, OK?

10:39.120 --> 10:40.000
Come by and say hi.

10:40.000 --> 10:40.800
Have a good one.

10:40.800 --> 10:41.360
I love you.
