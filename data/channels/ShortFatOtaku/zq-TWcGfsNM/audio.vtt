00:00.000 --> 00:04.960
What is a reactionary? That is the topic for today's video.

00:04.960 --> 00:07.360
And it's something I've been mulling over for a couple of months.

00:07.360 --> 00:09.200
I mean, not consistently, but you know what I mean.

00:09.760 --> 00:12.960
Back in April, I did this video, the new counterculture.

00:12.960 --> 00:17.360
It was basically a video about how punk, you know, the music, the aesthetic,

00:17.360 --> 00:20.960
the scene was primarily about being irreverent

00:20.960 --> 00:23.920
and therefore did not have any particular political slant.

00:23.920 --> 00:26.960
You can be irreverent towards the left, you can be irreverent towards the right,

00:26.960 --> 00:28.960
you can be irreverent towards anything.

00:28.960 --> 00:32.720
If your goal is to make somebody who is overly sensitive clutch their pearls,

00:32.720 --> 00:35.120
that is rather apolitical in the end.

00:35.120 --> 00:40.480
And the video was basically about how there's been a lot of radical left astroturfing of punk,

00:40.480 --> 00:44.400
conveniently forgetting that the 90s had a lot of Nazi punks in fact.

00:44.400 --> 00:48.320
But this video led Vosch, who I guess he's a punk, I don't know,

00:48.880 --> 00:52.640
to make a counter video to it, to be a reply girl in fact,

00:52.640 --> 00:56.720
and call me a fascist, I think maybe also an alt writer or a Nazi, I'm not sure,

00:56.720 --> 00:59.360
but definitely called me a reactionary, you know,

00:59.360 --> 01:01.920
reactionary conservatism or something along those lines.

01:02.560 --> 01:04.880
But basically the term reactionary was used quite a bit,

01:04.880 --> 01:07.120
which made it all the more funny when he ended the video with,

01:07.120 --> 01:08.800
you know, if this guy wants to come talk to me, it's fine.

01:09.440 --> 01:12.640
Yeah, uh, when you poison the well that badly,

01:12.640 --> 01:15.440
I don't know if that's really a conversation in good faith.

01:15.440 --> 01:18.240
But my point is, as soon as Vosch made his video,

01:18.240 --> 01:21.760
a whole bunch of his fans decided to start posting comments on mine,

01:21.760 --> 01:25.520
and they all used the same terminology, reactionary.

01:25.520 --> 01:27.200
Here's Master Adam 100,

01:27.200 --> 01:29.680
we have a word for people who consider themselves punk,

01:29.680 --> 01:32.960
but think it only means to offend people in general, posers.

01:33.520 --> 01:35.840
Punks punch up, not down.

01:35.840 --> 01:39.440
Reactionary conservatism is literally what punk stood against from the beginning.

01:40.160 --> 01:43.440
I asked, what do you mean by reactionary, and they didn't reply.

01:43.440 --> 01:46.800
But of course it's the whole punks punch up, not down thing,

01:46.800 --> 01:48.800
because it's all about power politics to them.

01:48.800 --> 01:52.240
It's all about one set of rules for thee and another for me.

01:52.240 --> 01:54.480
No bad tactics, only bad targets.

01:54.560 --> 01:56.400
As any good radical would say.

01:56.400 --> 02:00.800
I feel as though the tone driven by this video is very reactionary.

02:00.800 --> 02:04.640
I say that because for a while I would frequent KIA or other boards,

02:04.640 --> 02:08.480
and genuinely I don't think of them as hotspots for incel extremism or whatever,

02:08.480 --> 02:11.520
but they do complain in a similar way about people they have a problem with.

02:11.520 --> 02:14.240
Hey look, more reactionary YouTube filth.

02:14.240 --> 02:16.640
And it's always a treat when somebody hates you so much

02:16.640 --> 02:18.560
that they bleed over into your other avenues.

02:18.560 --> 02:20.720
This comment wasn't even left on that video,

02:20.720 --> 02:24.320
but in fact was a reply to my playing Hollow Knight on my gaming channel,

02:24.320 --> 02:26.320
calling me a dull reactionary.

02:26.320 --> 02:28.880
He, of course, also refused to define the term.

02:28.880 --> 02:31.520
Well I'm sorry that I didn't redistribute my geo, dude.

02:31.520 --> 02:33.200
This guy ends his post with,

02:33.200 --> 02:36.000
sorry this is a bit rambly but I'm high as shit right now,

02:36.000 --> 02:38.960
and to that I say, yeah I think we can tell.

02:38.960 --> 02:41.440
You seem to really misunderstand punk and its politics.

02:41.440 --> 02:44.080
Firstly, you are describing liberals, not leftists.

02:44.080 --> 02:47.200
Just because they are somewhat tolerant on social issues,

02:47.200 --> 02:51.760
and might want a slightly increased welfare state, does not make them leftist.

02:51.760 --> 02:54.480
I actually agree with that, which is why whenever the right says,

02:54.480 --> 02:58.320
those damn liberals are, no, no, liberals are the center.

02:58.320 --> 03:03.040
I suppose the internet right, the incels, the alt-right, the alt-light, etc,

03:03.040 --> 03:08.240
could be considered counter-cultural, but only in the same way as the Nazi punks of the 80s.

03:08.240 --> 03:12.560
Against the mainstream, but acting as reactionaries, not revolutionaries.

03:12.560 --> 03:15.200
You seem to be seeing current social issues,

03:15.200 --> 03:18.240
and instead of confronting them and going forward,

03:18.240 --> 03:21.360
wanting to instead go backwards to a previous time,

03:21.360 --> 03:25.040
where they were less present, but instead other issues were present instead.

03:25.040 --> 03:28.240
And then to say we did manage to move society back to that time,

03:28.240 --> 03:32.800
what is to say the same forces that led us to the present, won't act again, creating a cycle.

03:33.360 --> 03:37.520
What I'm trying to say is, the main politics of punk was anarchism,

03:37.520 --> 03:43.360
and that real anarchists still exist, and we need to organize to create the world we desire.

03:43.360 --> 03:46.560
Okay, real anarchists need to organize.

03:46.960 --> 03:54.560
I hope everyone else finds that as funny as I do, every single time I fucking read it.

03:55.760 --> 04:01.200
But it's this comment that really shows off the problem behind the phrase reactionary,

04:01.200 --> 04:02.720
especially how these people use it.

04:02.720 --> 04:08.400
This guy characterizes politics as going forward or going backwards, assuming that there is a

04:08.400 --> 04:12.080
correct political path for human advancement, when there actually isn't.

04:12.080 --> 04:15.040
Left wing is not forward, right wing is not backward.

04:15.040 --> 04:18.640
And even though time may be linear, politics isn't.

04:18.640 --> 04:21.920
I mentioned this on a podcast that I was on a couple months ago,

04:21.920 --> 04:24.720
and I'll be back on it again by the way, in a couple weeks.

04:24.720 --> 04:28.240
It was British Knights podcast, if you know the YouTuber.

04:28.240 --> 04:33.920
But basically, on that podcast I mentioned that a lot of these people have an oversimplified view of

04:34.880 --> 04:39.120
human advancement, whether it's technological, political, philosophical, whatever.

04:39.120 --> 04:42.000
They believe it works like a skill tree in civilization,

04:42.000 --> 04:45.520
where you just level up and choose the next path and it's all kind of linear.

04:45.520 --> 04:47.440
But that is absolutely not how it works.

04:47.440 --> 04:49.760
In the same vein, he uses the phrase acting like

04:49.760 --> 04:52.400
revolutionaries under the assumption that that is inherently good,

04:52.960 --> 04:56.880
and acting like reactionaries under the assumption that's inherently bad,

04:56.880 --> 05:01.280
when there are plenty of examples of bad revolutions and good reactions.

05:01.280 --> 05:02.720
And I'll get into that in a little bit.

05:02.720 --> 05:05.760
This is not a video about calling out shitty commenters, I swear.

05:05.760 --> 05:07.200
I'm using these to illustrate a point.

05:07.200 --> 05:08.400
And this is the last one.

05:08.400 --> 05:10.640
I pinned this comment on the video for a reason.

05:10.640 --> 05:14.000
I'm sorry, name the date we stopped bombing the shit out of the Middle East.

05:14.000 --> 05:18.320
Name the date the US was able to receive universal healthcare and tuition-free college.

05:18.320 --> 05:21.200
For fuck's sake, name the President of the United States.

05:21.200 --> 05:25.760
If you don't think the left is still fighting the establishment, you suffer from headass.

05:25.760 --> 05:27.440
Trump is Bush 2.0.

05:27.440 --> 05:31.040
He is a corporatist vulture who is bailing out every financial institution

05:31.040 --> 05:32.800
at the expense of the working man.

05:32.800 --> 05:33.680
He loves Israel.

05:33.680 --> 05:34.720
He loves war.

05:34.720 --> 05:38.320
He ran on an anti-establishment message and failed to deliver on any of it.

05:38.320 --> 05:43.120
Now, regardless of how you actually feel about Trump, if you think Trump is like Bush,

05:43.120 --> 05:46.320
you have such a limited understanding of politics and history

05:46.320 --> 05:48.320
that you really shouldn't be having this conversation.

05:48.320 --> 05:53.040
Do you guys recall maybe a year ago or whatever when Trump wanted to pull out of Syria,

05:53.040 --> 05:55.360
which by the way is part of pulling out of the Middle East,

05:55.360 --> 05:58.800
and the leftist war hawks shrieked about abandoning the Kurds?

05:58.800 --> 06:03.920
Why did Trump meet with North Korea's dictator, something that no US president has ever done?

06:03.920 --> 06:06.800
Why did he actually begin building the border wall?

06:06.800 --> 06:09.040
Now, you might not like the border wall, that's legitimate.

06:09.040 --> 06:12.240
There's actually a discussion to be had there whether you should be pro or anti-wall,

06:12.240 --> 06:16.000
but the point is immigration reform was promised by Bush,

06:16.000 --> 06:19.520
Clinton, and Obama at some point during their political careers,

06:19.520 --> 06:22.960
and Trump is the only one who took those words and translated them into action.

06:22.960 --> 06:28.000
There are very obvious ways that Trump is not cut from the same cloth as the previous presidents,

06:28.000 --> 06:33.600
and it's because he's not part of the neoliberal, neo-con, two sides of the same coin dynamic.

06:33.600 --> 06:36.240
And I will say, just for completionist's sake,

06:36.240 --> 06:39.920
you have a guy here screaming about universal healthcare and tuition-free college.

06:39.920 --> 06:44.000
When did punk abandon its hyper-individualistic, do-it-yourself ethic,

06:44.000 --> 06:47.200
and begin screaming for the man to throw them a few scraps?

06:47.200 --> 06:49.040
I guess you're a fucking sellout, dude.

06:49.040 --> 06:54.000
But if you need any more proof that it's the left continuing the Middle East wars and not Trump,

06:54.000 --> 06:55.360
this happened last week.

06:55.360 --> 06:59.760
House panel, controlled by the Democrats, votes to constrain Afghan drawdown,

06:59.760 --> 07:02.640
asks for assessment on incentives to attack US troops.

07:02.640 --> 07:06.000
The House Armed Services Committee voted Wednesday to put roadblocks

07:06.000 --> 07:09.200
on President Trump's ability to withdraw from Afghanistan,

07:09.200 --> 07:12.880
including requiring an assessment on whether any country has offered incentives

07:12.880 --> 07:15.600
for the Taliban to attack US and coalition troops.

07:15.600 --> 07:19.920
It is both the neo-libs and neo-cons that want eternal war in the Middle East.

07:19.920 --> 07:22.880
Trump is not one of them, and that's why they're road blocking him.

07:22.880 --> 07:27.040
But we still haven't gotten to the actual definition of reactionary yet, have we?

07:27.040 --> 07:28.960
And I know I can just go and look it up.

07:28.960 --> 07:31.200
But you know how these people work with definitions, right?

07:31.200 --> 07:33.680
If the dictionary definition does not play into their favour,

07:33.680 --> 07:34.960
then they'll scream and cry about it.

07:34.960 --> 07:37.600
They'll say that it's not real because it's white supremacist or whatever.

07:37.600 --> 07:40.320
So I want to get the definition from their mouths.

07:40.320 --> 07:41.520
And I finally got it.

07:41.520 --> 07:44.160
This comment was posted on a video on modern day debate.

07:44.160 --> 07:48.800
It was Sargon versus Brenton talking about should trans women be able to compete in women's sports.

07:48.800 --> 07:50.160
And here's the comment thread.

07:50.160 --> 07:54.880
So Sargon gets to answer the how do you know that question with because every human knows that.

07:54.880 --> 07:58.160
But meanwhile, when he chooses to ask the same question, how do you know that?

07:58.160 --> 08:01.680
And Brenton follows it up with peer reviewed publication in a scientific journal.

08:01.680 --> 08:02.960
Sargon just shrugs it off.

08:02.960 --> 08:06.480
Pretty much all Sargon does that's even close to being productive is just a bunch of scoffs

08:06.480 --> 08:07.760
and disrespectful smirks.

08:07.760 --> 08:10.960
Sargon, why is your goal evidently to be a complete putz,

08:10.960 --> 08:12.880
appealing to a double standard every step of the way?

08:12.880 --> 08:14.560
I haven't watched the whole debate yet.

08:14.560 --> 08:18.160
And this might actually be a legitimate question to ask Sargon

08:18.160 --> 08:22.800
if it turns out that Sargon is in fact ignoring data coming out of studies.

08:22.800 --> 08:23.840
That's not the point.

08:23.840 --> 08:25.600
The point is Jacob's reply.

08:25.600 --> 08:28.240
This is what reactionaries do in every debate.

08:28.240 --> 08:33.120
They are anti-intellectual and there's a reason nobody in academics takes them seriously

08:33.120 --> 08:36.640
and the world will continue to progress while they jerk off to their feelings.

08:36.640 --> 08:40.480
I will have a video on anti-intellectualism coming soon

08:40.480 --> 08:43.920
because it is not the reactionaries that are burning books right now.

08:43.920 --> 08:46.960
But nonetheless, seeing an opportunity, I decided to jump in.

08:47.520 --> 08:49.120
Jacob, what's a reactionary?

08:50.480 --> 08:54.160
Emma here says someone who dares to say no to bullshit.

08:54.160 --> 08:55.600
Okay, okay.

08:55.600 --> 08:58.400
Jacob says you should know you literally are one.

08:58.400 --> 09:02.560
And this is when you can kind of tell that this guy probably watches Vosh.

09:02.560 --> 09:08.080
Yeah, these guys, they always just view reactionary as an insult they can sling around.

09:08.080 --> 09:09.920
In fact, they react in saying it.

09:09.920 --> 09:10.880
It's kind of strange.

09:10.880 --> 09:13.280
I say, no, no, no, seriously, I'm asking in good faith.

09:13.280 --> 09:15.440
What is your definition of the term reactionary?

09:15.440 --> 09:18.960
And he says a person or entity holding political views

09:18.960 --> 09:22.160
that favor a return to a previous political state of society

09:22.160 --> 09:24.320
that they believe possessed characteristics

09:24.320 --> 09:27.600
that are negatively absent from the contemporary status quo of society.

09:28.480 --> 09:32.400
So that's when you get people like in the 70s looking at, you know,

09:32.400 --> 09:35.760
all the hippies and all the drugs and sex and rock and roll.

09:35.760 --> 09:38.640
And they're like, man, the nifty 50s, they were so much better.

09:38.640 --> 09:41.120
There's a morality that's missing in contemporary society.

09:41.120 --> 09:43.920
That is what it sounds like a reactionary is to these people.

09:43.920 --> 09:45.200
And okay, fair enough.

09:45.200 --> 09:48.320
And in fact, as you can see from the very first sentence

09:48.320 --> 09:51.040
of the Wikipedia article on reactionary,

09:51.040 --> 09:53.200
he simply copied what was on Wikipedia.

09:53.200 --> 09:55.760
It sounds like what's written here is probably okay for him.

09:56.640 --> 10:00.080
As an adjective, the word reactionary describes points of view

10:00.080 --> 10:03.280
and policies meant to restore a past status quo.

10:03.280 --> 10:08.000
The word reactionary is often used in the context of the left-right political spectrum

10:08.000 --> 10:10.640
and is one tradition in right-wing politics.

10:10.640 --> 10:15.120
In popular usage, it is commonly used to refer to a highly traditional position,

10:15.120 --> 10:17.600
one opposed to social or political change.

10:17.600 --> 10:21.760
A reactionary yearns to overturn a present condition of perceived decadence

10:21.760 --> 10:23.760
and recover an idealized past.

10:23.760 --> 10:27.920
Such reactionary individuals and policies favor societal transformation,

10:27.920 --> 10:32.080
in contrast to conservative individuals or policies that seek incremental change

10:32.080 --> 10:33.920
or to preserve what exists in the present.

10:33.920 --> 10:39.680
What's interesting is that this does not seem like it is inherently right-wing.

10:39.680 --> 10:42.400
Conservatives generally want incremental change.

10:42.400 --> 10:45.600
They don't want radical change, whether it's a radical leap forward

10:45.600 --> 10:47.680
or radically regressing backwards.

10:47.680 --> 10:50.240
Basically, conservatives want to take things slow,

10:50.240 --> 10:52.960
while reactionaries seem to want to do things quite quickly.

10:52.960 --> 10:56.560
And the use of the term in this context has been picking up steam.

10:56.560 --> 10:59.600
You'll find it in the bios of these far-left Twitter nutjobs,

10:59.600 --> 11:02.160
just like you'll find it in the comments of YouTube videos.

11:02.160 --> 11:04.800
A quick search of Vosch himself using the term

11:04.800 --> 11:07.520
seems to show that it's one of his most popular of all time.

11:07.520 --> 11:09.920
I'm going to be seeing that Twitch deer girl

11:09.920 --> 11:13.200
in reactionary YouTube thumbnails for the next six months, aren't I?

11:13.840 --> 11:17.200
You know, it's almost like somebody did something wrong

11:17.200 --> 11:19.760
and people are reasonable to react to that.

11:19.760 --> 11:22.480
Like, if somebody burst into my house,

11:22.480 --> 11:25.600
jumped up on top of my kitchen table and started taking a shit,

11:25.600 --> 11:27.600
is the fact that I'm reacting to it negative?

11:28.160 --> 11:29.360
I don't know, dude.

11:29.360 --> 11:34.480
And of course, he views being labeled a reactionary as such a terrible thing

11:35.120 --> 11:37.760
that he has to quantify it.

11:37.760 --> 11:42.320
Like, I don't think you're a reactionary or I don't think this is reactionary.

11:42.400 --> 11:47.360
As if having a reasonable reaction to a negative state of affairs is a bad thing.

11:47.360 --> 11:49.680
Of course, he conflates conservatives and reactionaries

11:49.680 --> 11:52.480
because to a revolutionary, somebody who wants to go slow

11:52.480 --> 11:54.800
is the same thing as somebody who wants to go back.

11:54.800 --> 11:56.560
But the funniest one of all is this one.

11:56.560 --> 12:01.040
I'm done pretending tankies are just a quirky, harmless outlier to leftist communities.

12:01.040 --> 12:04.400
From now on, I'll be treating them like the reactionaries they are.

12:04.400 --> 12:05.120
The tankies?

12:05.680 --> 12:07.280
They are your natural end result.

12:07.840 --> 12:08.960
I know you don't like it.

12:08.960 --> 12:10.080
I know you don't believe it.

12:10.080 --> 12:10.960
I know you don't want to hear it.

12:11.520 --> 12:14.560
But all communism, if given enough time

12:14.560 --> 12:18.160
and enough room to advance and reach its natural end result,

12:18.160 --> 12:20.080
it will always turn into the USSR.

12:20.080 --> 12:21.520
It will always turn into China.

12:21.520 --> 12:25.040
Anarcho-communism does not and cannot exist.

12:25.040 --> 12:27.360
Anarcho-anything cannot exist.

12:27.360 --> 12:30.960
As you like to say, human behavior trends towards cooperation.

12:30.960 --> 12:34.800
And cooperation eventually is going to require some kind of hierarchy,

12:34.800 --> 12:36.080
some kind of organization.

12:36.080 --> 12:40.080
But more importantly than that, as soon as you have some kind of revolution

12:40.080 --> 12:41.920
and somebody doesn't want to go along with you,

12:41.920 --> 12:44.880
you will have to use state force in order to make them go along with you.

12:44.880 --> 12:48.560
And that will necessitate an authoritarian communist state.

12:48.560 --> 12:51.840
Vash, the tankies are just you in about 10 years.

12:52.400 --> 12:55.360
So we have our definition of reactionary.

12:55.360 --> 12:59.840
To these people, it's somebody who idealizes a previous political paradigm

12:59.840 --> 13:01.120
and wants a return to that.

13:01.120 --> 13:04.960
And in order to make that return happen, they want to reverse progress.

13:04.960 --> 13:07.920
Of course, that means that I'm reactionary, according to these people,

13:07.920 --> 13:10.320
even though there's really no evidence for that.

13:10.320 --> 13:12.320
Just like there's no evidence for me being right-wing.

13:12.320 --> 13:14.640
And a whole bunch of evidence for me not being right-wing.

13:14.640 --> 13:16.240
But they don't really care about that.

13:16.240 --> 13:19.280
But remember Vash conflating conservative and reactionary?

13:19.280 --> 13:22.000
Conflating go slow with go backwards?

13:22.000 --> 13:26.720
That is part of the you can't stand still on a moving train type of philosophy.

13:26.720 --> 13:29.600
The point of the metaphor is that when a train is going forward,

13:29.600 --> 13:33.120
even if you stand still while you're on it, you're still going forward.

13:33.120 --> 13:34.880
And you really only have two choices.

13:34.880 --> 13:37.200
Either go forward with the train or go backward.

13:37.200 --> 13:39.600
This idea came from, I think, Howard Zinn.

13:39.600 --> 13:40.160
He wrote,

13:40.160 --> 13:43.840
You're on a train and somebody unseen is driving it somewhere bad.

13:43.840 --> 13:44.960
You can jump off.

13:44.960 --> 13:46.240
You can try to stop it.

13:46.240 --> 13:49.200
Or you can sit there with your head down, minding your own business,

13:49.200 --> 13:50.480
trying to stay out of trouble.

13:50.480 --> 13:51.600
Neutrality.

13:51.600 --> 13:53.440
Except you can't be neutral.

13:53.440 --> 13:56.640
The train's moving and like it or not, you happen to be on it.

13:56.640 --> 13:58.640
You're either resisting or complicit.

13:58.640 --> 14:01.520
To this kind of radicalism, there can be no neutrality.

14:01.520 --> 14:07.120
Which is why it will always be amusing to me to hear this come out of

14:08.000 --> 14:12.080
when it was actually a hallmark of rightist thought during the George Bush era.

14:12.800 --> 14:17.680
Every nation in every region now has a decision to make.

14:18.960 --> 14:23.040
Either you are with us or you are with the terrorists.

14:24.400 --> 14:28.080
Either you're with us, either you love freedom,

14:28.080 --> 14:31.760
and with nations which embrace freedom, or you're with the enemy.

14:31.760 --> 14:32.880
There's no in between.

14:32.880 --> 14:34.320
You're either with us or you're with the enemy.

14:34.320 --> 14:35.200
That's clear.

14:35.200 --> 14:36.640
I will continue to make that clear.

14:37.760 --> 14:42.080
If you're not with me, then you're my enemy.

14:42.640 --> 14:46.960
But because Howard Zinn's idea states that there is no neutral,

14:46.960 --> 14:49.600
only forward or backward, only pro or against,

14:49.600 --> 14:54.000
that also means that in such conditions where there are many different options,

14:54.000 --> 15:00.000
you know, like far right, right, center right, centrist, center left, left, far left,

15:00.000 --> 15:06.240
in situations where in reality your choices consist of a wide spectrum of available options,

15:06.240 --> 15:09.840
then everything gets boiled down to forward or backward by this philosophy.

15:09.840 --> 15:13.280
And forward becomes everything that the speaker wants to be the truth,

15:13.280 --> 15:19.120
or wants to be good, or personally advocates for, and backward becomes everything else.

15:19.120 --> 15:22.160
That is how you get ridiculous posts like this,

15:22.160 --> 15:25.520
where the radical views this to be the perception, you know,

15:25.520 --> 15:28.720
all the various political figures on the political spectrum,

15:28.720 --> 15:32.400
and they think the reality is everyone is jammed over towards the right,

15:32.880 --> 15:38.640
Bernie Sanders is a centrist, and there is this fantasy land beyond the far left,

15:38.640 --> 15:40.240
which is where they exist.

15:40.240 --> 15:44.800
You have to have fully bought into this theory if you think this is the reality.

15:44.800 --> 15:46.880
That's also how you get this diagram.

15:46.880 --> 15:49.280
This is something that I used in one of my previous videos,

15:49.280 --> 15:52.400
but it basically shows how my normal center left views

15:52.400 --> 15:56.960
became alt right or far right or Nazi to the extremists on the left.

15:56.960 --> 16:00.480
And in fact, one of the commie idiots tweeting at me a few months ago

16:00.480 --> 16:02.720
really went into the nitty gritty of how this works.

16:03.360 --> 16:05.120
Left has always been left.

16:05.120 --> 16:10.560
Center left is just lip service while keeping the same damaging capitalist system flowing,

16:10.560 --> 16:15.520
just like the right wing both give lip service to their sets of morals and keeps the rich rich.

16:15.520 --> 16:18.720
This person views center left as right wing,

16:18.720 --> 16:22.880
even though there are obvious differences between them, because it is all or nothing for them.

16:22.880 --> 16:27.840
As time goes on and we progress, old left wing views turn right,

16:27.840 --> 16:31.120
and those stuck in them try to conserve them even when they're wrong.

16:31.120 --> 16:35.280
She is outright admitting that the shifting of the overton window,

16:35.280 --> 16:40.720
the pushing of things ever more leftward, and the transformation of far left positions,

16:40.720 --> 16:46.880
say 50 years ago, into center right or right wing is deliberate and intentional by these people.

16:46.880 --> 16:48.640
This is why they will never stop.

16:48.640 --> 16:51.680
It's why they will always descend into purity spirals,

16:51.680 --> 16:56.960
expelling those who are not pure enough and splintering off into ever smaller special interest groups.

16:56.960 --> 17:00.320
It's why their activists, even if they get everything that they want,

17:00.320 --> 17:03.360
will invent new grievances and continue to push for them.

17:03.360 --> 17:06.880
On the practical side of things it's because they've become a bureaucracy and just want more money.

17:06.880 --> 17:10.320
But on the ideological side of things it's because they truly believe

17:10.320 --> 17:13.760
that all things left are good and all things right are bad,

17:13.760 --> 17:17.520
and that society is meant to trend ever more leftward over time.

17:17.520 --> 17:20.960
And if you disagree with that you're just a reactionary.

17:20.960 --> 17:24.160
Of course this person doesn't really know what they're talking about because

17:24.160 --> 17:26.400
they immediately contradict themselves.

17:26.400 --> 17:29.920
Literally your whole channel is right wing lol, you're against everything left.

17:29.920 --> 17:31.840
Right to bear arms is also a left wing thing.

17:31.840 --> 17:36.080
Well okay, even if we accept the idea that the right to bear arms is also a left wing thing,

17:36.080 --> 17:38.320
well I believe in the right to bear arms.

17:38.320 --> 17:42.160
So how can I possibly be against everything left by your own definition?

17:42.800 --> 17:44.240
It's almost like you're an idiot.

17:44.240 --> 17:48.960
The problem with their formulation of reactionary is that they don't understand that sometimes

17:49.600 --> 17:53.440
if things are going badly it's actually a good idea to react to them.

17:53.440 --> 17:56.800
Right now the left is going absolutely wild in the name of progress,

17:56.800 --> 17:59.600
even though there's no actual progress to be had in what they're doing.

17:59.600 --> 18:02.400
And if reasonable people, acting in good faith,

18:02.400 --> 18:05.840
disagree with what the left is doing and in fact think that it's harmful,

18:05.840 --> 18:07.920
is it not reasonable to react to that?

18:07.920 --> 18:10.400
Self-defense is fundamentally reactionary.

18:10.400 --> 18:14.720
If somebody's attacking you, you're reacting to that, but we consider that to be legitimate.

18:14.720 --> 18:17.760
Stopping a thief or a rapist is reactionary.

18:17.760 --> 18:21.600
You are reacting to a bad situation, but we consider that to be legitimate.

18:21.600 --> 18:25.600
In reality, the word reactionary is a label they slap onto those

18:25.600 --> 18:27.840
who they think is opposed to the revolution.

18:27.840 --> 18:32.640
If they use that label in a way that shows that they believe it to be completely interchangeable

18:32.640 --> 18:37.040
with right-wing or conservative or center-right or even centrist, like someone like Vosch,

18:37.040 --> 18:41.600
then that person has basically shown themselves to only believe in one type of politics,

18:41.600 --> 18:44.400
the correct politics, as if there could ever be a thing.

18:44.400 --> 18:48.320
They have shown that they don't believe in spectrums, in degrees of things,

18:48.320 --> 18:51.440
that everything is in fact either with them or against them.

18:51.440 --> 18:54.880
And yes, I know that these people give lip service to the idea of the whole

18:54.880 --> 18:56.160
gender is a spectrum thing.

18:56.160 --> 18:58.960
Let's be honest, they don't really believe that either.

18:58.960 --> 19:02.240
That's why when you get biological males transitioning and becoming trans women,

19:02.240 --> 19:03.440
they're completely okay with it.

19:03.440 --> 19:07.280
But as soon as you get a lot of biological women transitioning to be trans men,

19:07.280 --> 19:09.760
then suddenly it becomes a big fucking crisis.

19:09.760 --> 19:13.840
If this article said, why do so many teenage boys want to change gender,

19:13.840 --> 19:18.160
and what's behind it and has the NHS been too quick to find a solution?

19:18.160 --> 19:21.360
This website would be shut down for transphobia immediately.

19:21.360 --> 19:24.480
But it's because they really don't believe in gender as a spectrum.

19:24.480 --> 19:28.000
They see things in terms of male and non-male, and that's it.

19:28.000 --> 19:31.360
And non-male includes women, it includes genderqueer people,

19:31.360 --> 19:34.240
it includes non-binary people, and it includes trans women.

19:34.240 --> 19:37.600
To them, any avenue that takes you away from maleness is legitimate,

19:37.600 --> 19:40.480
and any avenue that brings you towards maleness is not.

19:40.480 --> 19:43.200
Therefore, trans women are fine and trans men are a problem.

19:43.200 --> 19:46.000
In this way, the left is actually remarkably transphobic.

19:46.000 --> 19:49.360
There is also another great critique of their concept of reactionary.

19:49.360 --> 19:51.920
It is that they are all themselves reactionary.

19:51.920 --> 19:55.840
The person who uses the term to label their political opponents as reactionary,

19:55.840 --> 19:57.440
they are reactionaries themselves.

19:57.440 --> 19:59.600
For example, communism is a dead ideology.

19:59.600 --> 20:02.080
It was conceived of like 150 years ago,

20:02.080 --> 20:05.840
in reaction to a problem within capitalism that has largely been solved.

20:05.840 --> 20:07.760
Seriously, go talk to a commie on Twitter.

20:07.760 --> 20:11.920
They'll talk about working conditions in factories like there are still factories in the West.

20:11.920 --> 20:14.720
Like the economy hasn't changed in 150 years.

20:14.720 --> 20:16.640
They are part of a previous political paradigm,

20:16.640 --> 20:19.280
and they don't understand that capitalism has moved past them.

20:19.680 --> 20:21.120
Look at the definition again.

20:21.120 --> 20:24.960
It's literally somebody who pines for a previous political paradigm.

20:24.960 --> 20:29.120
So would that mean that a communist in modern day Russia is a reactionary?

20:29.120 --> 20:32.480
Because Russia transitioned away from communism after the fall of the Soviet Union?

20:32.480 --> 20:34.960
Would that mean that somebody in Nazi Germany

20:34.960 --> 20:37.760
was a reactionary if they wanted to go back to the Weimar Republic?

20:37.760 --> 20:40.240
By their own definition, yeah, kinda.

20:40.240 --> 20:45.520
The previous political paradigm ran basically from Bush Senior through the two Clinton terms,

20:45.520 --> 20:48.880
through the two Bush Junior terms, and then through the two Obama terms.

20:48.880 --> 20:54.080
That was the paradigm of Neolibs and Neocons basically being two sides of the same coin.

20:54.080 --> 20:56.000
They only really differed on social issues,

20:56.000 --> 20:59.360
but on economic issues, on foreign policy, they were pretty much the same.

20:59.360 --> 21:03.760
That is why, by the way, Obama expanded on a lot of George Bush's programs.

21:03.760 --> 21:07.600
He kept the wars up, the drone strikes up, a lot of the economic policies were similar.

21:07.600 --> 21:12.080
Obama did a lot of superficial stuff, there were a few social advancements made,

21:12.080 --> 21:15.920
but for the most part he was just George Bush terms three and four.

21:15.920 --> 21:17.040
But Trump is different.

21:17.600 --> 21:22.320
Better or worse, regardless of whether or not you like him, he is a different kind of politician.

21:22.320 --> 21:25.280
He is not part of the Neolib-Neocon consensus.

21:25.280 --> 21:29.840
And the immense amount of backlash he's received for the past four years

21:29.840 --> 21:34.880
has been in part because the left has become an entirely reactionary force.

21:34.880 --> 21:36.960
We all know that when push comes to shove,

21:36.960 --> 21:41.520
people like Vashj, people on the far left, will hold their nose and vote for Biden.

21:41.520 --> 21:42.880
They will cuck out.

21:42.880 --> 21:44.880
They will not stand by their principles.

21:44.880 --> 21:48.720
They will throw their lot in with the Neolibs even as they talk about hating them.

21:48.720 --> 21:51.840
And to be honest, everything that's been happening recently has all been

21:51.840 --> 21:54.880
a neoliberal counter-revolution to use their term.

21:54.880 --> 21:56.320
It's all been reactionary.

21:56.320 --> 22:00.640
When Trump got elected, that class of Neolibs and Neocons

22:00.640 --> 22:06.080
that had acquired positions and money and power and influence as a result of globalist policies

22:06.080 --> 22:09.920
were, for the first time in decades, thrown out of power.

22:09.920 --> 22:13.040
Voters across the world chose Brexit, they chose Trump,

22:13.040 --> 22:17.440
they chose populism, and they chose, in a sense, conservative nationalism.

22:17.440 --> 22:19.280
That is the direction politics have gone.

22:19.280 --> 22:23.600
But it's not simply Nazism or fascism just because it's nationalist.

22:23.600 --> 22:25.600
It is a different kind of politics.

22:25.600 --> 22:29.200
The only way you would view it as fascism is if you actually believe

22:29.200 --> 22:32.000
that everything is either you or not you.

22:32.000 --> 22:33.920
If you are that much of a tribalist.

22:33.920 --> 22:36.560
If you believe that you can't be neutral on a moving train.

22:36.560 --> 22:38.720
But because it is a new political era,

22:38.720 --> 22:42.320
the left losing its shit for the past four years has been reactionary.

22:42.320 --> 22:46.480
And those people on the ground, you know, the rioters, the people in Chaz, the protesters,

22:46.480 --> 22:50.080
even the peaceful protesters, YouTubers like Vosh, idiots on Twitter,

22:50.080 --> 22:54.560
even if they spout Marxist rhetoric, even if they genuinely believe that they are communists,

22:54.560 --> 22:57.280
and they want to implement communism upon the world and the whole thing,

22:57.280 --> 23:00.640
their rhetoric and their beliefs even don't actually matter that much.

23:00.640 --> 23:07.200
Because they are simply being used by the old Neolib-Neocon establishment as reactionaries.

23:07.200 --> 23:09.760
That's why the biggest push has come from the institutions.

23:09.760 --> 23:16.640
Academia, media, large corporations, experts, whatever the fuck those are, big tech,

23:16.640 --> 23:19.760
you know, money is pouring into Black Lives Matter, pouring into all these groups.

23:19.760 --> 23:24.240
When these large monoliths are lining up behind the rank and file protesters

23:24.240 --> 23:29.360
and chanting Viva La Revolution, we know it's not a revolution, it is a reaction.

23:29.360 --> 23:31.920
These groups do not seek a radically new arrangement.

23:32.560 --> 23:36.320
They seek a return to the pre-Trump, pre-Brexit status quo.

23:36.320 --> 23:37.680
That's why they back Biden.

23:37.680 --> 23:40.800
And as much as you have people crying about how terrible Biden is,

23:40.800 --> 23:45.120
and how they're never voting for Biden, and how the DNC screwed them and all that,

23:45.120 --> 23:50.560
and how he's not socialist enough or whatever the fuck, they will still cuck out and vote for him.

23:50.560 --> 23:54.960
We are ultimately facing a leftist counter-revolution, as strange as it sounds,

23:54.960 --> 23:57.600
because counter-revolution is a communist term.

23:57.600 --> 24:01.200
And it makes sense because the way that the communists use reactionary,

24:01.200 --> 24:03.040
they simply mean counter-revolutionary.

24:03.040 --> 24:06.240
If you are a person who opposes communism for one of the many,

24:06.240 --> 24:11.440
many different reasons that various groups oppose communism, you are a counter-revolutionary.

24:11.440 --> 24:15.200
And they basically use the term reactionary to refer to counter-revolutionary.

24:15.200 --> 24:19.040
But there are so many examples of these people being reactionaries themselves,

24:19.040 --> 24:21.120
that it would take me way too long to go through them all.

24:21.120 --> 24:22.480
This video is already long enough.

24:22.480 --> 24:25.520
How many of you have seen this, the Democracy Matters Strategic Plan for Action?

24:26.160 --> 24:27.600
Apparently it's private and confidential.

24:27.600 --> 24:28.160
Uh, oops.

24:29.840 --> 24:31.680
And it comes out of Media Matters for America.

24:32.320 --> 24:34.560
This is not what we plan, but it's what we're built for.

24:34.560 --> 24:35.760
Like, listen to this.

24:35.760 --> 24:39.600
Trump has the legal authority, but we have the moral authority

24:39.600 --> 24:42.240
and the moral responsibility to oppose him.

24:42.240 --> 24:45.600
We are going to resist the normalization of Donald Trump.

24:45.600 --> 24:47.760
These are the words of a reactionary.

24:47.760 --> 24:51.520
These are the words of people who want to go back to the previous political paradigm.

24:51.520 --> 24:54.160
The old era where neo-libs and neo-cons ran everything.

24:54.160 --> 24:55.520
Well, we're not in that era anymore.

24:56.080 --> 24:57.200
We have advanced.

24:57.200 --> 24:59.200
We have moved forward, as you would say.

24:59.200 --> 25:04.160
And using your logic, if you don't get on board with the present, then you are a force of the past.

25:04.160 --> 25:07.520
By their own definition, they are reactionaries.

25:07.520 --> 25:14.640
They still believe that the GOP is like the 1990s neo-con party run by Pat Robertson types

25:14.640 --> 25:18.080
who want to censor rap music and video games like Jack Thompson or something.

25:18.080 --> 25:19.200
But that's not the case.

25:19.200 --> 25:20.960
The political landscape has changed.

25:20.960 --> 25:23.200
Those old guard neo-cons are gone.

25:23.760 --> 25:25.600
The last one left is what, Mitt Romney?

25:25.600 --> 25:27.360
No one gives a shit about Mitt Romney anymore.

25:27.360 --> 25:29.120
Trump has successfully routed them.

25:29.120 --> 25:31.280
Meanwhile, the neo-libs are globalists.

25:31.280 --> 25:34.640
They have that in common with the communists, who want global communism.

25:34.640 --> 25:39.840
And so, every single leftist movement, supported by every single leftist YouTuber and commentator

25:39.840 --> 25:43.760
and reactionary, want to go back to that previous status quo.

25:43.760 --> 25:47.840
Even if they say they don't, the end result of their efforts will either be a reactionary

25:47.840 --> 25:52.560
return to normalcy, as Biden likes to call it, the return to the old neo-lib status quo

25:52.560 --> 25:57.280
that we have since moved past, or alternatively, a return much further backward.

25:57.280 --> 25:59.680
A return to the failed system of communism.

25:59.680 --> 26:04.400
A return to the gulags, to the millions of deaths, to the complete squalor of the entire

26:04.400 --> 26:05.280
human race.

26:05.280 --> 26:09.600
Because no matter how often they talk about being anarcho-anything, it will always end

26:09.600 --> 26:10.960
up looking like the Soviet Union.

26:10.960 --> 26:12.720
So, that is what a reactionary is.

26:13.440 --> 26:16.560
If someone calls you a reactionary, it's because they're a revolutionary.

26:16.560 --> 26:21.680
It's because they believe that all things under the sun, all of politics, can be boiled

26:21.680 --> 26:24.080
down to either them or the fascists.

26:24.080 --> 26:26.720
And if you're not them, then you're the fascists.

26:26.720 --> 26:31.360
It's because they believe that politics has a moral arc, and that if you don't have

26:31.360 --> 26:33.920
the correct politics, you need to be purged.

26:33.920 --> 26:38.320
And it's because, regardless of what they believe, they want to implement totalitarian

26:38.320 --> 26:39.200
communism.

26:39.200 --> 26:40.400
And we have to stop them.

26:40.400 --> 26:41.840
Alright guys, I'm getting out of here.

26:41.840 --> 26:42.640
It's a nice day.

26:42.640 --> 26:43.840
Naomi and I are going to the beach.

26:44.560 --> 26:45.760
I'll talk to you soon.

26:45.760 --> 26:46.560
I love you.
