00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,960
What is a reactionary? That is the topic for today's video.

2
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:07,360
And it's something I've been mulling over for a couple of months.

3
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:09,200
I mean, not consistently, but you know what I mean.

4
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:12,960
Back in April, I did this video, the new counterculture.

5
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:17,360
It was basically a video about how punk, you know, the music, the aesthetic,

6
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:20,960
the scene was primarily about being irreverent

7
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:23,920
and therefore did not have any particular political slant.

8
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:26,960
You can be irreverent towards the left, you can be irreverent towards the right,

9
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:28,960
you can be irreverent towards anything.

10
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:32,720
If your goal is to make somebody who is overly sensitive clutch their pearls,

11
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:35,120
that is rather apolitical in the end.

12
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:40,480
And the video was basically about how there's been a lot of radical left astroturfing of punk,

13
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:44,400
conveniently forgetting that the 90s had a lot of Nazi punks in fact.

14
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:48,320
But this video led Vosch, who I guess he's a punk, I don't know,

15
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:52,640
to make a counter video to it, to be a reply girl in fact,

16
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:56,720
and call me a fascist, I think maybe also an alt writer or a Nazi, I'm not sure,

17
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:59,360
but definitely called me a reactionary, you know,

18
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:01,920
reactionary conservatism or something along those lines.

19
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:04,880
But basically the term reactionary was used quite a bit,

20
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:07,120
which made it all the more funny when he ended the video with,

21
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:08,800
you know, if this guy wants to come talk to me, it's fine.

22
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:12,640
Yeah, uh, when you poison the well that badly,

23
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:15,440
I don't know if that's really a conversation in good faith.

24
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:18,240
But my point is, as soon as Vosch made his video,

25
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:21,760
a whole bunch of his fans decided to start posting comments on mine,

26
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:25,520
and they all used the same terminology, reactionary.

27
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:27,200
Here's Master Adam 100,

28
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,680
we have a word for people who consider themselves punk,

29
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:32,960
but think it only means to offend people in general, posers.

30
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:35,840
Punks punch up, not down.

31
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:39,440
Reactionary conservatism is literally what punk stood against from the beginning.

32
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:43,440
I asked, what do you mean by reactionary, and they didn't reply.

33
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:46,800
But of course it's the whole punks punch up, not down thing,

34
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:48,800
because it's all about power politics to them.

35
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:52,240
It's all about one set of rules for thee and another for me.

36
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:54,480
No bad tactics, only bad targets.

37
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,400
As any good radical would say.

38
00:01:56,400 --> 00:02:00,800
I feel as though the tone driven by this video is very reactionary.

39
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:04,640
I say that because for a while I would frequent KIA or other boards,

40
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:08,480
and genuinely I don't think of them as hotspots for incel extremism or whatever,

41
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:11,520
but they do complain in a similar way about people they have a problem with.

42
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:14,240
Hey look, more reactionary YouTube filth.

43
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:16,640
And it's always a treat when somebody hates you so much

44
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,560
that they bleed over into your other avenues.

45
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,720
This comment wasn't even left on that video,

46
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:24,320
but in fact was a reply to my playing Hollow Knight on my gaming channel,

47
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:26,320
calling me a dull reactionary.

48
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:28,880
He, of course, also refused to define the term.

49
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:31,520
Well I'm sorry that I didn't redistribute my geo, dude.

50
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:33,200
This guy ends his post with,

51
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:36,000
sorry this is a bit rambly but I'm high as shit right now,

52
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,960
and to that I say, yeah I think we can tell.

53
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:41,440
You seem to really misunderstand punk and its politics.

54
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:44,080
Firstly, you are describing liberals, not leftists.

55
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:47,200
Just because they are somewhat tolerant on social issues,

56
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:51,760
and might want a slightly increased welfare state, does not make them leftist.

57
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:54,480
I actually agree with that, which is why whenever the right says,

58
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:58,320
those damn liberals are, no, no, liberals are the center.

59
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:03,040
I suppose the internet right, the incels, the alt-right, the alt-light, etc,

60
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:08,240
could be considered counter-cultural, but only in the same way as the Nazi punks of the 80s.

61
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:12,560
Against the mainstream, but acting as reactionaries, not revolutionaries.

62
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:15,200
You seem to be seeing current social issues,

63
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:18,240
and instead of confronting them and going forward,

64
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:21,360
wanting to instead go backwards to a previous time,

65
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:25,040
where they were less present, but instead other issues were present instead.

66
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:28,240
And then to say we did manage to move society back to that time,

67
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:32,800
what is to say the same forces that led us to the present, won't act again, creating a cycle.

68
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:37,520
What I'm trying to say is, the main politics of punk was anarchism,

69
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:43,360
and that real anarchists still exist, and we need to organize to create the world we desire.

70
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:46,560
Okay, real anarchists need to organize.

71
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:54,560
I hope everyone else finds that as funny as I do, every single time I fucking read it.

72
00:03:55,760 --> 00:04:01,200
But it's this comment that really shows off the problem behind the phrase reactionary,

73
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,720
especially how these people use it.

74
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:08,400
This guy characterizes politics as going forward or going backwards, assuming that there is a

75
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:12,080
correct political path for human advancement, when there actually isn't.

76
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:15,040
Left wing is not forward, right wing is not backward.

77
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:18,640
And even though time may be linear, politics isn't.

78
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:21,920
I mentioned this on a podcast that I was on a couple months ago,

79
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:24,720
and I'll be back on it again by the way, in a couple weeks.

80
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:28,240
It was British Knights podcast, if you know the YouTuber.

81
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:33,920
But basically, on that podcast I mentioned that a lot of these people have an oversimplified view of

82
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:39,120
human advancement, whether it's technological, political, philosophical, whatever.

83
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:42,000
They believe it works like a skill tree in civilization,

84
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,520
where you just level up and choose the next path and it's all kind of linear.

85
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,440
But that is absolutely not how it works.

86
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,760
In the same vein, he uses the phrase acting like

87
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:52,400
revolutionaries under the assumption that that is inherently good,

88
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:56,880
and acting like reactionaries under the assumption that's inherently bad,

89
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:01,280
when there are plenty of examples of bad revolutions and good reactions.

90
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:02,720
And I'll get into that in a little bit.

91
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:05,760
This is not a video about calling out shitty commenters, I swear.

92
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:07,200
I'm using these to illustrate a point.

93
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,400
And this is the last one.

94
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,640
I pinned this comment on the video for a reason.

95
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:14,000
I'm sorry, name the date we stopped bombing the shit out of the Middle East.

96
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,320
Name the date the US was able to receive universal healthcare and tuition-free college.

97
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:21,200
For fuck's sake, name the President of the United States.

98
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:25,760
If you don't think the left is still fighting the establishment, you suffer from headass.

99
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:27,440
Trump is Bush 2.0.

100
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:31,040
He is a corporatist vulture who is bailing out every financial institution

101
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,800
at the expense of the working man.

102
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:33,680
He loves Israel.

103
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:34,720
He loves war.

104
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:38,320
He ran on an anti-establishment message and failed to deliver on any of it.

105
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:43,120
Now, regardless of how you actually feel about Trump, if you think Trump is like Bush,

106
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:46,320
you have such a limited understanding of politics and history

107
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,320
that you really shouldn't be having this conversation.

108
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:53,040
Do you guys recall maybe a year ago or whatever when Trump wanted to pull out of Syria,

109
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:55,360
which by the way is part of pulling out of the Middle East,

110
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:58,800
and the leftist war hawks shrieked about abandoning the Kurds?

111
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:03,920
Why did Trump meet with North Korea's dictator, something that no US president has ever done?

112
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:06,800
Why did he actually begin building the border wall?

113
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,040
Now, you might not like the border wall, that's legitimate.

114
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:12,240
There's actually a discussion to be had there whether you should be pro or anti-wall,

115
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:16,000
but the point is immigration reform was promised by Bush,

116
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,520
Clinton, and Obama at some point during their political careers,

117
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:22,960
and Trump is the only one who took those words and translated them into action.

118
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:28,000
There are very obvious ways that Trump is not cut from the same cloth as the previous presidents,

119
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:33,600
and it's because he's not part of the neoliberal, neo-con, two sides of the same coin dynamic.

120
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,240
And I will say, just for completionist's sake,

121
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:39,920
you have a guy here screaming about universal healthcare and tuition-free college.

122
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:44,000
When did punk abandon its hyper-individualistic, do-it-yourself ethic,

123
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,200
and begin screaming for the man to throw them a few scraps?

124
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:49,040
I guess you're a fucking sellout, dude.

125
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:54,000
But if you need any more proof that it's the left continuing the Middle East wars and not Trump,

126
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,360
this happened last week.

127
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:59,760
House panel, controlled by the Democrats, votes to constrain Afghan drawdown,

128
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:02,640
asks for assessment on incentives to attack US troops.

129
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:06,000
The House Armed Services Committee voted Wednesday to put roadblocks

130
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,200
on President Trump's ability to withdraw from Afghanistan,

131
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:12,880
including requiring an assessment on whether any country has offered incentives

132
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:15,600
for the Taliban to attack US and coalition troops.

133
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:19,920
It is both the neo-libs and neo-cons that want eternal war in the Middle East.

134
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:22,880
Trump is not one of them, and that's why they're road blocking him.

135
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:27,040
But we still haven't gotten to the actual definition of reactionary yet, have we?

136
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,960
And I know I can just go and look it up.

137
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:31,200
But you know how these people work with definitions, right?

138
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:33,680
If the dictionary definition does not play into their favour,

139
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:34,960
then they'll scream and cry about it.

140
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:37,600
They'll say that it's not real because it's white supremacist or whatever.

141
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:40,320
So I want to get the definition from their mouths.

142
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:41,520
And I finally got it.

143
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:44,160
This comment was posted on a video on modern day debate.

144
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:48,800
It was Sargon versus Brenton talking about should trans women be able to compete in women's sports.

145
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,160
And here's the comment thread.

146
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:54,880
So Sargon gets to answer the how do you know that question with because every human knows that.

147
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:58,160
But meanwhile, when he chooses to ask the same question, how do you know that?

148
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:01,680
And Brenton follows it up with peer reviewed publication in a scientific journal.

149
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:02,960
Sargon just shrugs it off.

150
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:06,480
Pretty much all Sargon does that's even close to being productive is just a bunch of scoffs

151
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:07,760
and disrespectful smirks.

152
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:10,960
Sargon, why is your goal evidently to be a complete putz,

153
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,880
appealing to a double standard every step of the way?

154
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:14,560
I haven't watched the whole debate yet.

155
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:18,160
And this might actually be a legitimate question to ask Sargon

156
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:22,800
if it turns out that Sargon is in fact ignoring data coming out of studies.

157
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:23,840
That's not the point.

158
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,600
The point is Jacob's reply.

159
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:28,240
This is what reactionaries do in every debate.

160
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:33,120
They are anti-intellectual and there's a reason nobody in academics takes them seriously

161
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:36,640
and the world will continue to progress while they jerk off to their feelings.

162
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:40,480
I will have a video on anti-intellectualism coming soon

163
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:43,920
because it is not the reactionaries that are burning books right now.

164
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:46,960
But nonetheless, seeing an opportunity, I decided to jump in.

165
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:49,120
Jacob, what's a reactionary?

166
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:54,160
Emma here says someone who dares to say no to bullshit.

167
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,600
Okay, okay.

168
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:58,400
Jacob says you should know you literally are one.

169
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:02,560
And this is when you can kind of tell that this guy probably watches Vosh.

170
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:08,080
Yeah, these guys, they always just view reactionary as an insult they can sling around.

171
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,920
In fact, they react in saying it.

172
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:10,880
It's kind of strange.

173
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:13,280
I say, no, no, no, seriously, I'm asking in good faith.

174
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:15,440
What is your definition of the term reactionary?

175
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:18,960
And he says a person or entity holding political views

176
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:22,160
that favor a return to a previous political state of society

177
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:24,320
that they believe possessed characteristics

178
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:27,600
that are negatively absent from the contemporary status quo of society.

179
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:32,400
So that's when you get people like in the 70s looking at, you know,

180
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:35,760
all the hippies and all the drugs and sex and rock and roll.

181
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:38,640
And they're like, man, the nifty 50s, they were so much better.

182
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:41,120
There's a morality that's missing in contemporary society.

183
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,920
That is what it sounds like a reactionary is to these people.

184
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,200
And okay, fair enough.

185
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:48,320
And in fact, as you can see from the very first sentence

186
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:51,040
of the Wikipedia article on reactionary,

187
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:53,200
he simply copied what was on Wikipedia.

188
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,760
It sounds like what's written here is probably okay for him.

189
00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:00,080
As an adjective, the word reactionary describes points of view

190
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:03,280
and policies meant to restore a past status quo.

191
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:08,000
The word reactionary is often used in the context of the left-right political spectrum

192
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,640
and is one tradition in right-wing politics.

193
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:15,120
In popular usage, it is commonly used to refer to a highly traditional position,

194
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,600
one opposed to social or political change.

195
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:21,760
A reactionary yearns to overturn a present condition of perceived decadence

196
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,760
and recover an idealized past.

197
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:27,920
Such reactionary individuals and policies favor societal transformation,

198
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:32,080
in contrast to conservative individuals or policies that seek incremental change

199
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,920
or to preserve what exists in the present.

200
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:39,680
What's interesting is that this does not seem like it is inherently right-wing.

201
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:42,400
Conservatives generally want incremental change.

202
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:45,600
They don't want radical change, whether it's a radical leap forward

203
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,680
or radically regressing backwards.

204
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:50,240
Basically, conservatives want to take things slow,

205
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,960
while reactionaries seem to want to do things quite quickly.

206
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:56,560
And the use of the term in this context has been picking up steam.

207
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:59,600
You'll find it in the bios of these far-left Twitter nutjobs,

208
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:02,160
just like you'll find it in the comments of YouTube videos.

209
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,800
A quick search of Vosch himself using the term

210
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:07,520
seems to show that it's one of his most popular of all time.

211
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:09,920
I'm going to be seeing that Twitch deer girl

212
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:13,200
in reactionary YouTube thumbnails for the next six months, aren't I?

213
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:17,200
You know, it's almost like somebody did something wrong

214
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,760
and people are reasonable to react to that.

215
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:22,480
Like, if somebody burst into my house,

216
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:25,600
jumped up on top of my kitchen table and started taking a shit,

217
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,600
is the fact that I'm reacting to it negative?

218
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:29,360
I don't know, dude.

219
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:34,480
And of course, he views being labeled a reactionary as such a terrible thing

220
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:37,760
that he has to quantify it.

221
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:42,320
Like, I don't think you're a reactionary or I don't think this is reactionary.

222
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:47,360
As if having a reasonable reaction to a negative state of affairs is a bad thing.

223
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:49,680
Of course, he conflates conservatives and reactionaries

224
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:52,480
because to a revolutionary, somebody who wants to go slow

225
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,800
is the same thing as somebody who wants to go back.

226
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,560
But the funniest one of all is this one.

227
00:11:56,560 --> 00:12:01,040
I'm done pretending tankies are just a quirky, harmless outlier to leftist communities.

228
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:04,400
From now on, I'll be treating them like the reactionaries they are.

229
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:05,120
The tankies?

230
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,280
They are your natural end result.

231
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:08,960
I know you don't like it.

232
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:10,080
I know you don't believe it.

233
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:10,960
I know you don't want to hear it.

234
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:14,560
But all communism, if given enough time

235
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:18,160
and enough room to advance and reach its natural end result,

236
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,080
it will always turn into the USSR.

237
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,520
It will always turn into China.

238
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:25,040
Anarcho-communism does not and cannot exist.

239
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:27,360
Anarcho-anything cannot exist.

240
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:30,960
As you like to say, human behavior trends towards cooperation.

241
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:34,800
And cooperation eventually is going to require some kind of hierarchy,

242
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,080
some kind of organization.

243
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:40,080
But more importantly than that, as soon as you have some kind of revolution

244
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:41,920
and somebody doesn't want to go along with you,

245
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:44,880
you will have to use state force in order to make them go along with you.

246
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:48,560
And that will necessitate an authoritarian communist state.

247
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:51,840
Vash, the tankies are just you in about 10 years.

248
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:55,360
So we have our definition of reactionary.

249
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:59,840
To these people, it's somebody who idealizes a previous political paradigm

250
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:01,120
and wants a return to that.

251
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:04,960
And in order to make that return happen, they want to reverse progress.

252
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:07,920
Of course, that means that I'm reactionary, according to these people,

253
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:10,320
even though there's really no evidence for that.

254
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,320
Just like there's no evidence for me being right-wing.

255
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,640
And a whole bunch of evidence for me not being right-wing.

256
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:16,240
But they don't really care about that.

257
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:19,280
But remember Vash conflating conservative and reactionary?

258
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:22,000
Conflating go slow with go backwards?

259
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,720
That is part of the you can't stand still on a moving train type of philosophy.

260
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:29,600
The point of the metaphor is that when a train is going forward,

261
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:33,120
even if you stand still while you're on it, you're still going forward.

262
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,880
And you really only have two choices.

263
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:37,200
Either go forward with the train or go backward.

264
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,600
This idea came from, I think, Howard Zinn.

265
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:40,160
He wrote,

266
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:43,840
You're on a train and somebody unseen is driving it somewhere bad.

267
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:44,960
You can jump off.

268
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:46,240
You can try to stop it.

269
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:49,200
Or you can sit there with your head down, minding your own business,

270
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,480
trying to stay out of trouble.

271
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:51,600
Neutrality.

272
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,440
Except you can't be neutral.

273
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:56,640
The train's moving and like it or not, you happen to be on it.

274
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:58,640
You're either resisting or complicit.

275
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:01,520
To this kind of radicalism, there can be no neutrality.

276
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:07,120
Which is why it will always be amusing to me to hear this come out of

277
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:12,080
when it was actually a hallmark of rightist thought during the George Bush era.

278
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:17,680
Every nation in every region now has a decision to make.

279
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:23,040
Either you are with us or you are with the terrorists.

280
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:28,080
Either you're with us, either you love freedom,

281
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:31,760
and with nations which embrace freedom, or you're with the enemy.

282
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:32,880
There's no in between.

283
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:34,320
You're either with us or you're with the enemy.

284
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:35,200
That's clear.

285
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,640
I will continue to make that clear.

286
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:42,080
If you're not with me, then you're my enemy.

287
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:46,960
But because Howard Zinn's idea states that there is no neutral,

288
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:49,600
only forward or backward, only pro or against,

289
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:54,000
that also means that in such conditions where there are many different options,

290
00:14:54,000 --> 00:15:00,000
you know, like far right, right, center right, centrist, center left, left, far left,

291
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:06,240
in situations where in reality your choices consist of a wide spectrum of available options,

292
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:09,840
then everything gets boiled down to forward or backward by this philosophy.

293
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:13,280
And forward becomes everything that the speaker wants to be the truth,

294
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:19,120
or wants to be good, or personally advocates for, and backward becomes everything else.

295
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:22,160
That is how you get ridiculous posts like this,

296
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:25,520
where the radical views this to be the perception, you know,

297
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:28,720
all the various political figures on the political spectrum,

298
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:32,400
and they think the reality is everyone is jammed over towards the right,

299
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:38,640
Bernie Sanders is a centrist, and there is this fantasy land beyond the far left,

300
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:40,240
which is where they exist.

301
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:44,800
You have to have fully bought into this theory if you think this is the reality.

302
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,880
That's also how you get this diagram.

303
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:49,280
This is something that I used in one of my previous videos,

304
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:52,400
but it basically shows how my normal center left views

305
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:56,960
became alt right or far right or Nazi to the extremists on the left.

306
00:15:56,960 --> 00:16:00,480
And in fact, one of the commie idiots tweeting at me a few months ago

307
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,720
really went into the nitty gritty of how this works.

308
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:05,120
Left has always been left.

309
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:10,560
Center left is just lip service while keeping the same damaging capitalist system flowing,

310
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:15,520
just like the right wing both give lip service to their sets of morals and keeps the rich rich.

311
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:18,720
This person views center left as right wing,

312
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:22,880
even though there are obvious differences between them, because it is all or nothing for them.

313
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:27,840
As time goes on and we progress, old left wing views turn right,

314
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:31,120
and those stuck in them try to conserve them even when they're wrong.

315
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:35,280
She is outright admitting that the shifting of the overton window,

316
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:40,720
the pushing of things ever more leftward, and the transformation of far left positions,

317
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:46,880
say 50 years ago, into center right or right wing is deliberate and intentional by these people.

318
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,640
This is why they will never stop.

319
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:51,680
It's why they will always descend into purity spirals,

320
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:56,960
expelling those who are not pure enough and splintering off into ever smaller special interest groups.

321
00:16:56,960 --> 00:17:00,320
It's why their activists, even if they get everything that they want,

322
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:03,360
will invent new grievances and continue to push for them.

323
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:06,880
On the practical side of things it's because they've become a bureaucracy and just want more money.

324
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:10,320
But on the ideological side of things it's because they truly believe

325
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:13,760
that all things left are good and all things right are bad,

326
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:17,520
and that society is meant to trend ever more leftward over time.

327
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:20,960
And if you disagree with that you're just a reactionary.

328
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:24,160
Of course this person doesn't really know what they're talking about because

329
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:26,400
they immediately contradict themselves.

330
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:29,920
Literally your whole channel is right wing lol, you're against everything left.

331
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:31,840
Right to bear arms is also a left wing thing.

332
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:36,080
Well okay, even if we accept the idea that the right to bear arms is also a left wing thing,

333
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:38,320
well I believe in the right to bear arms.

334
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:42,160
So how can I possibly be against everything left by your own definition?

335
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:44,240
It's almost like you're an idiot.

336
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:48,960
The problem with their formulation of reactionary is that they don't understand that sometimes

337
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:53,440
if things are going badly it's actually a good idea to react to them.

338
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:56,800
Right now the left is going absolutely wild in the name of progress,

339
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:59,600
even though there's no actual progress to be had in what they're doing.

340
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:02,400
And if reasonable people, acting in good faith,

341
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:05,840
disagree with what the left is doing and in fact think that it's harmful,

342
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:07,920
is it not reasonable to react to that?

343
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:10,400
Self-defense is fundamentally reactionary.

344
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:14,720
If somebody's attacking you, you're reacting to that, but we consider that to be legitimate.

345
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:17,760
Stopping a thief or a rapist is reactionary.

346
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:21,600
You are reacting to a bad situation, but we consider that to be legitimate.

347
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:25,600
In reality, the word reactionary is a label they slap onto those

348
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,840
who they think is opposed to the revolution.

349
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:32,640
If they use that label in a way that shows that they believe it to be completely interchangeable

350
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:37,040
with right-wing or conservative or center-right or even centrist, like someone like Vosch,

351
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:41,600
then that person has basically shown themselves to only believe in one type of politics,

352
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:44,400
the correct politics, as if there could ever be a thing.

353
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:48,320
They have shown that they don't believe in spectrums, in degrees of things,

354
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:51,440
that everything is in fact either with them or against them.

355
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:54,880
And yes, I know that these people give lip service to the idea of the whole

356
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,160
gender is a spectrum thing.

357
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:58,960
Let's be honest, they don't really believe that either.

358
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:02,240
That's why when you get biological males transitioning and becoming trans women,

359
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,440
they're completely okay with it.

360
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:07,280
But as soon as you get a lot of biological women transitioning to be trans men,

361
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:09,760
then suddenly it becomes a big fucking crisis.

362
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:13,840
If this article said, why do so many teenage boys want to change gender,

363
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:18,160
and what's behind it and has the NHS been too quick to find a solution?

364
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:21,360
This website would be shut down for transphobia immediately.

365
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:24,480
But it's because they really don't believe in gender as a spectrum.

366
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:28,000
They see things in terms of male and non-male, and that's it.

367
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,360
And non-male includes women, it includes genderqueer people,

368
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:34,240
it includes non-binary people, and it includes trans women.

369
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:37,600
To them, any avenue that takes you away from maleness is legitimate,

370
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:40,480
and any avenue that brings you towards maleness is not.

371
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:43,200
Therefore, trans women are fine and trans men are a problem.

372
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:46,000
In this way, the left is actually remarkably transphobic.

373
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,360
There is also another great critique of their concept of reactionary.

374
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:51,920
It is that they are all themselves reactionary.

375
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:55,840
The person who uses the term to label their political opponents as reactionary,

376
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:57,440
they are reactionaries themselves.

377
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,600
For example, communism is a dead ideology.

378
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:02,080
It was conceived of like 150 years ago,

379
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:05,840
in reaction to a problem within capitalism that has largely been solved.

380
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:07,760
Seriously, go talk to a commie on Twitter.

381
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:11,920
They'll talk about working conditions in factories like there are still factories in the West.

382
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:14,720
Like the economy hasn't changed in 150 years.

383
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,640
They are part of a previous political paradigm,

384
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:19,280
and they don't understand that capitalism has moved past them.

385
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:21,120
Look at the definition again.

386
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:24,960
It's literally somebody who pines for a previous political paradigm.

387
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:29,120
So would that mean that a communist in modern day Russia is a reactionary?

388
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:32,480
Because Russia transitioned away from communism after the fall of the Soviet Union?

389
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:34,960
Would that mean that somebody in Nazi Germany

390
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:37,760
was a reactionary if they wanted to go back to the Weimar Republic?

391
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:40,240
By their own definition, yeah, kinda.

392
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:45,520
The previous political paradigm ran basically from Bush Senior through the two Clinton terms,

393
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:48,880
through the two Bush Junior terms, and then through the two Obama terms.

394
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:54,080
That was the paradigm of Neolibs and Neocons basically being two sides of the same coin.

395
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:56,000
They only really differed on social issues,

396
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,360
but on economic issues, on foreign policy, they were pretty much the same.

397
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:03,760
That is why, by the way, Obama expanded on a lot of George Bush's programs.

398
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:07,600
He kept the wars up, the drone strikes up, a lot of the economic policies were similar.

399
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:12,080
Obama did a lot of superficial stuff, there were a few social advancements made,

400
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:15,920
but for the most part he was just George Bush terms three and four.

401
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:17,040
But Trump is different.

402
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:22,320
Better or worse, regardless of whether or not you like him, he is a different kind of politician.

403
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:25,280
He is not part of the Neolib-Neocon consensus.

404
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:29,840
And the immense amount of backlash he's received for the past four years

405
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:34,880
has been in part because the left has become an entirely reactionary force.

406
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,960
We all know that when push comes to shove,

407
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:41,520
people like Vashj, people on the far left, will hold their nose and vote for Biden.

408
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:42,880
They will cuck out.

409
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:44,880
They will not stand by their principles.

410
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:48,720
They will throw their lot in with the Neolibs even as they talk about hating them.

411
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:51,840
And to be honest, everything that's been happening recently has all been

412
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:54,880
a neoliberal counter-revolution to use their term.

413
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,320
It's all been reactionary.

414
00:21:56,320 --> 00:22:00,640
When Trump got elected, that class of Neolibs and Neocons

415
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:06,080
that had acquired positions and money and power and influence as a result of globalist policies

416
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:09,920
were, for the first time in decades, thrown out of power.

417
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:13,040
Voters across the world chose Brexit, they chose Trump,

418
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:17,440
they chose populism, and they chose, in a sense, conservative nationalism.

419
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:19,280
That is the direction politics have gone.

420
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:23,600
But it's not simply Nazism or fascism just because it's nationalist.

421
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:25,600
It is a different kind of politics.

422
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:29,200
The only way you would view it as fascism is if you actually believe

423
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:32,000
that everything is either you or not you.

424
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,920
If you are that much of a tribalist.

425
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:36,560
If you believe that you can't be neutral on a moving train.

426
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:38,720
But because it is a new political era,

427
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:42,320
the left losing its shit for the past four years has been reactionary.

428
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:46,480
And those people on the ground, you know, the rioters, the people in Chaz, the protesters,

429
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:50,080
even the peaceful protesters, YouTubers like Vosh, idiots on Twitter,

430
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:54,560
even if they spout Marxist rhetoric, even if they genuinely believe that they are communists,

431
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:57,280
and they want to implement communism upon the world and the whole thing,

432
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:00,640
their rhetoric and their beliefs even don't actually matter that much.

433
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:07,200
Because they are simply being used by the old Neolib-Neocon establishment as reactionaries.

434
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:09,760
That's why the biggest push has come from the institutions.

435
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:16,640
Academia, media, large corporations, experts, whatever the fuck those are, big tech,

436
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:19,760
you know, money is pouring into Black Lives Matter, pouring into all these groups.

437
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:24,240
When these large monoliths are lining up behind the rank and file protesters

438
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:29,360
and chanting Viva La Revolution, we know it's not a revolution, it is a reaction.

439
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:31,920
These groups do not seek a radically new arrangement.

440
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:36,320
They seek a return to the pre-Trump, pre-Brexit status quo.

441
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:37,680
That's why they back Biden.

442
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:40,800
And as much as you have people crying about how terrible Biden is,

443
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:45,120
and how they're never voting for Biden, and how the DNC screwed them and all that,

444
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:50,560
and how he's not socialist enough or whatever the fuck, they will still cuck out and vote for him.

445
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:54,960
We are ultimately facing a leftist counter-revolution, as strange as it sounds,

446
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:57,600
because counter-revolution is a communist term.

447
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:01,200
And it makes sense because the way that the communists use reactionary,

448
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:03,040
they simply mean counter-revolutionary.

449
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:06,240
If you are a person who opposes communism for one of the many,

450
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:11,440
many different reasons that various groups oppose communism, you are a counter-revolutionary.

451
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:15,200
And they basically use the term reactionary to refer to counter-revolutionary.

452
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:19,040
But there are so many examples of these people being reactionaries themselves,

453
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:21,120
that it would take me way too long to go through them all.

454
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:22,480
This video is already long enough.

455
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:25,520
How many of you have seen this, the Democracy Matters Strategic Plan for Action?

456
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:27,600
Apparently it's private and confidential.

457
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:28,160
Uh, oops.

458
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:31,680
And it comes out of Media Matters for America.

459
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:34,560
This is not what we plan, but it's what we're built for.

460
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:35,760
Like, listen to this.

461
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:39,600
Trump has the legal authority, but we have the moral authority

462
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:42,240
and the moral responsibility to oppose him.

463
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:45,600
We are going to resist the normalization of Donald Trump.

464
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,760
These are the words of a reactionary.

465
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:51,520
These are the words of people who want to go back to the previous political paradigm.

466
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:54,160
The old era where neo-libs and neo-cons ran everything.

467
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:55,520
Well, we're not in that era anymore.

468
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:57,200
We have advanced.

469
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:59,200
We have moved forward, as you would say.

470
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:04,160
And using your logic, if you don't get on board with the present, then you are a force of the past.

471
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:07,520
By their own definition, they are reactionaries.

472
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:14,640
They still believe that the GOP is like the 1990s neo-con party run by Pat Robertson types

473
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:18,080
who want to censor rap music and video games like Jack Thompson or something.

474
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,200
But that's not the case.

475
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:20,960
The political landscape has changed.

476
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:23,200
Those old guard neo-cons are gone.

477
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:25,600
The last one left is what, Mitt Romney?

478
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,360
No one gives a shit about Mitt Romney anymore.

479
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:29,120
Trump has successfully routed them.

480
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:31,280
Meanwhile, the neo-libs are globalists.

481
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:34,640
They have that in common with the communists, who want global communism.

482
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:39,840
And so, every single leftist movement, supported by every single leftist YouTuber and commentator

483
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:43,760
and reactionary, want to go back to that previous status quo.

484
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:47,840
Even if they say they don't, the end result of their efforts will either be a reactionary

485
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:52,560
return to normalcy, as Biden likes to call it, the return to the old neo-lib status quo

486
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:57,280
that we have since moved past, or alternatively, a return much further backward.

487
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:59,680
A return to the failed system of communism.

488
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:04,400
A return to the gulags, to the millions of deaths, to the complete squalor of the entire

489
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:05,280
human race.

490
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:09,600
Because no matter how often they talk about being anarcho-anything, it will always end

491
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:10,960
up looking like the Soviet Union.

492
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:12,720
So, that is what a reactionary is.

493
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:16,560
If someone calls you a reactionary, it's because they're a revolutionary.

494
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:21,680
It's because they believe that all things under the sun, all of politics, can be boiled

495
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:24,080
down to either them or the fascists.

496
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:26,720
And if you're not them, then you're the fascists.

497
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:31,360
It's because they believe that politics has a moral arc, and that if you don't have

498
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:33,920
the correct politics, you need to be purged.

499
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:38,320
And it's because, regardless of what they believe, they want to implement totalitarian

500
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:39,200
communism.

501
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:40,400
And we have to stop them.

502
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:41,840
Alright guys, I'm getting out of here.

503
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:42,640
It's a nice day.

504
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:43,840
Naomi and I are going to the beach.

505
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:45,760
I'll talk to you soon.

506
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:46,560
I love you.
