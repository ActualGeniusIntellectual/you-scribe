0	4960	What is a reactionary? That is the topic for today's video.
4960	7360	And it's something I've been mulling over for a couple of months.
7360	9200	I mean, not consistently, but you know what I mean.
9760	12960	Back in April, I did this video, the new counterculture.
12960	17360	It was basically a video about how punk, you know, the music, the aesthetic,
17360	20960	the scene was primarily about being irreverent
20960	23920	and therefore did not have any particular political slant.
23920	26960	You can be irreverent towards the left, you can be irreverent towards the right,
26960	28960	you can be irreverent towards anything.
28960	32720	If your goal is to make somebody who is overly sensitive clutch their pearls,
32720	35120	that is rather apolitical in the end.
35120	40480	And the video was basically about how there's been a lot of radical left astroturfing of punk,
40480	44400	conveniently forgetting that the 90s had a lot of Nazi punks in fact.
44400	48320	But this video led Vosch, who I guess he's a punk, I don't know,
48880	52640	to make a counter video to it, to be a reply girl in fact,
52640	56720	and call me a fascist, I think maybe also an alt writer or a Nazi, I'm not sure,
56720	59360	but definitely called me a reactionary, you know,
59360	61920	reactionary conservatism or something along those lines.
62560	64880	But basically the term reactionary was used quite a bit,
64880	67120	which made it all the more funny when he ended the video with,
67120	68800	you know, if this guy wants to come talk to me, it's fine.
69440	72640	Yeah, uh, when you poison the well that badly,
72640	75440	I don't know if that's really a conversation in good faith.
75440	78240	But my point is, as soon as Vosch made his video,
78240	81760	a whole bunch of his fans decided to start posting comments on mine,
81760	85520	and they all used the same terminology, reactionary.
85520	87200	Here's Master Adam 100,
87200	89680	we have a word for people who consider themselves punk,
89680	92960	but think it only means to offend people in general, posers.
93520	95840	Punks punch up, not down.
95840	99440	Reactionary conservatism is literally what punk stood against from the beginning.
100160	103440	I asked, what do you mean by reactionary, and they didn't reply.
103440	106800	But of course it's the whole punks punch up, not down thing,
106800	108800	because it's all about power politics to them.
108800	112240	It's all about one set of rules for thee and another for me.
112240	114480	No bad tactics, only bad targets.
114560	116400	As any good radical would say.
116400	120800	I feel as though the tone driven by this video is very reactionary.
120800	124640	I say that because for a while I would frequent KIA or other boards,
124640	128480	and genuinely I don't think of them as hotspots for incel extremism or whatever,
128480	131520	but they do complain in a similar way about people they have a problem with.
131520	134240	Hey look, more reactionary YouTube filth.
134240	136640	And it's always a treat when somebody hates you so much
136640	138560	that they bleed over into your other avenues.
138560	140720	This comment wasn't even left on that video,
140720	144320	but in fact was a reply to my playing Hollow Knight on my gaming channel,
144320	146320	calling me a dull reactionary.
146320	148880	He, of course, also refused to define the term.
148880	151520	Well I'm sorry that I didn't redistribute my geo, dude.
151520	153200	This guy ends his post with,
153200	156000	sorry this is a bit rambly but I'm high as shit right now,
156000	158960	and to that I say, yeah I think we can tell.
158960	161440	You seem to really misunderstand punk and its politics.
161440	164080	Firstly, you are describing liberals, not leftists.
164080	167200	Just because they are somewhat tolerant on social issues,
167200	171760	and might want a slightly increased welfare state, does not make them leftist.
171760	174480	I actually agree with that, which is why whenever the right says,
174480	178320	those damn liberals are, no, no, liberals are the center.
178320	183040	I suppose the internet right, the incels, the alt-right, the alt-light, etc,
183040	188240	could be considered counter-cultural, but only in the same way as the Nazi punks of the 80s.
188240	192560	Against the mainstream, but acting as reactionaries, not revolutionaries.
192560	195200	You seem to be seeing current social issues,
195200	198240	and instead of confronting them and going forward,
198240	201360	wanting to instead go backwards to a previous time,
201360	205040	where they were less present, but instead other issues were present instead.
205040	208240	And then to say we did manage to move society back to that time,
208240	212800	what is to say the same forces that led us to the present, won't act again, creating a cycle.
213360	217520	What I'm trying to say is, the main politics of punk was anarchism,
217520	223360	and that real anarchists still exist, and we need to organize to create the world we desire.
223360	226560	Okay, real anarchists need to organize.
226960	234560	I hope everyone else finds that as funny as I do, every single time I fucking read it.
235760	241200	But it's this comment that really shows off the problem behind the phrase reactionary,
241200	242720	especially how these people use it.
242720	248400	This guy characterizes politics as going forward or going backwards, assuming that there is a
248400	252080	correct political path for human advancement, when there actually isn't.
252080	255040	Left wing is not forward, right wing is not backward.
255040	258640	And even though time may be linear, politics isn't.
258640	261920	I mentioned this on a podcast that I was on a couple months ago,
261920	264720	and I'll be back on it again by the way, in a couple weeks.
264720	268240	It was British Knights podcast, if you know the YouTuber.
268240	273920	But basically, on that podcast I mentioned that a lot of these people have an oversimplified view of
274880	279120	human advancement, whether it's technological, political, philosophical, whatever.
279120	282000	They believe it works like a skill tree in civilization,
282000	285520	where you just level up and choose the next path and it's all kind of linear.
285520	287440	But that is absolutely not how it works.
287440	289760	In the same vein, he uses the phrase acting like
289760	292400	revolutionaries under the assumption that that is inherently good,
292960	296880	and acting like reactionaries under the assumption that's inherently bad,
296880	301280	when there are plenty of examples of bad revolutions and good reactions.
301280	302720	And I'll get into that in a little bit.
302720	305760	This is not a video about calling out shitty commenters, I swear.
305760	307200	I'm using these to illustrate a point.
307200	308400	And this is the last one.
308400	310640	I pinned this comment on the video for a reason.
310640	314000	I'm sorry, name the date we stopped bombing the shit out of the Middle East.
314000	318320	Name the date the US was able to receive universal healthcare and tuition-free college.
318320	321200	For fuck's sake, name the President of the United States.
321200	325760	If you don't think the left is still fighting the establishment, you suffer from headass.
325760	327440	Trump is Bush 2.0.
327440	331040	He is a corporatist vulture who is bailing out every financial institution
331040	332800	at the expense of the working man.
332800	333680	He loves Israel.
333680	334720	He loves war.
334720	338320	He ran on an anti-establishment message and failed to deliver on any of it.
338320	343120	Now, regardless of how you actually feel about Trump, if you think Trump is like Bush,
343120	346320	you have such a limited understanding of politics and history
346320	348320	that you really shouldn't be having this conversation.
348320	353040	Do you guys recall maybe a year ago or whatever when Trump wanted to pull out of Syria,
353040	355360	which by the way is part of pulling out of the Middle East,
355360	358800	and the leftist war hawks shrieked about abandoning the Kurds?
358800	363920	Why did Trump meet with North Korea's dictator, something that no US president has ever done?
363920	366800	Why did he actually begin building the border wall?
366800	369040	Now, you might not like the border wall, that's legitimate.
369040	372240	There's actually a discussion to be had there whether you should be pro or anti-wall,
372240	376000	but the point is immigration reform was promised by Bush,
376000	379520	Clinton, and Obama at some point during their political careers,
379520	382960	and Trump is the only one who took those words and translated them into action.
382960	388000	There are very obvious ways that Trump is not cut from the same cloth as the previous presidents,
388000	393600	and it's because he's not part of the neoliberal, neo-con, two sides of the same coin dynamic.
393600	396240	And I will say, just for completionist's sake,
396240	399920	you have a guy here screaming about universal healthcare and tuition-free college.
399920	404000	When did punk abandon its hyper-individualistic, do-it-yourself ethic,
404000	407200	and begin screaming for the man to throw them a few scraps?
407200	409040	I guess you're a fucking sellout, dude.
409040	414000	But if you need any more proof that it's the left continuing the Middle East wars and not Trump,
414000	415360	this happened last week.
415360	419760	House panel, controlled by the Democrats, votes to constrain Afghan drawdown,
419760	422640	asks for assessment on incentives to attack US troops.
422640	426000	The House Armed Services Committee voted Wednesday to put roadblocks
426000	429200	on President Trump's ability to withdraw from Afghanistan,
429200	432880	including requiring an assessment on whether any country has offered incentives
432880	435600	for the Taliban to attack US and coalition troops.
435600	439920	It is both the neo-libs and neo-cons that want eternal war in the Middle East.
439920	442880	Trump is not one of them, and that's why they're road blocking him.
442880	447040	But we still haven't gotten to the actual definition of reactionary yet, have we?
447040	448960	And I know I can just go and look it up.
448960	451200	But you know how these people work with definitions, right?
451200	453680	If the dictionary definition does not play into their favour,
453680	454960	then they'll scream and cry about it.
454960	457600	They'll say that it's not real because it's white supremacist or whatever.
457600	460320	So I want to get the definition from their mouths.
460320	461520	And I finally got it.
461520	464160	This comment was posted on a video on modern day debate.
464160	468800	It was Sargon versus Brenton talking about should trans women be able to compete in women's sports.
468800	470160	And here's the comment thread.
470160	474880	So Sargon gets to answer the how do you know that question with because every human knows that.
474880	478160	But meanwhile, when he chooses to ask the same question, how do you know that?
478160	481680	And Brenton follows it up with peer reviewed publication in a scientific journal.
481680	482960	Sargon just shrugs it off.
482960	486480	Pretty much all Sargon does that's even close to being productive is just a bunch of scoffs
486480	487760	and disrespectful smirks.
487760	490960	Sargon, why is your goal evidently to be a complete putz,
490960	492880	appealing to a double standard every step of the way?
492880	494560	I haven't watched the whole debate yet.
494560	498160	And this might actually be a legitimate question to ask Sargon
498160	502800	if it turns out that Sargon is in fact ignoring data coming out of studies.
502800	503840	That's not the point.
503840	505600	The point is Jacob's reply.
505600	508240	This is what reactionaries do in every debate.
508240	513120	They are anti-intellectual and there's a reason nobody in academics takes them seriously
513120	516640	and the world will continue to progress while they jerk off to their feelings.
516640	520480	I will have a video on anti-intellectualism coming soon
520480	523920	because it is not the reactionaries that are burning books right now.
523920	526960	But nonetheless, seeing an opportunity, I decided to jump in.
527520	529120	Jacob, what's a reactionary?
530480	534160	Emma here says someone who dares to say no to bullshit.
534160	535600	Okay, okay.
535600	538400	Jacob says you should know you literally are one.
538400	542560	And this is when you can kind of tell that this guy probably watches Vosh.
542560	548080	Yeah, these guys, they always just view reactionary as an insult they can sling around.
548080	549920	In fact, they react in saying it.
549920	550880	It's kind of strange.
550880	553280	I say, no, no, no, seriously, I'm asking in good faith.
553280	555440	What is your definition of the term reactionary?
555440	558960	And he says a person or entity holding political views
558960	562160	that favor a return to a previous political state of society
562160	564320	that they believe possessed characteristics
564320	567600	that are negatively absent from the contemporary status quo of society.
568480	572400	So that's when you get people like in the 70s looking at, you know,
572400	575760	all the hippies and all the drugs and sex and rock and roll.
575760	578640	And they're like, man, the nifty 50s, they were so much better.
578640	581120	There's a morality that's missing in contemporary society.
581120	583920	That is what it sounds like a reactionary is to these people.
583920	585200	And okay, fair enough.
585200	588320	And in fact, as you can see from the very first sentence
588320	591040	of the Wikipedia article on reactionary,
591040	593200	he simply copied what was on Wikipedia.
593200	595760	It sounds like what's written here is probably okay for him.
596640	600080	As an adjective, the word reactionary describes points of view
600080	603280	and policies meant to restore a past status quo.
603280	608000	The word reactionary is often used in the context of the left-right political spectrum
608000	610640	and is one tradition in right-wing politics.
610640	615120	In popular usage, it is commonly used to refer to a highly traditional position,
615120	617600	one opposed to social or political change.
617600	621760	A reactionary yearns to overturn a present condition of perceived decadence
621760	623760	and recover an idealized past.
623760	627920	Such reactionary individuals and policies favor societal transformation,
627920	632080	in contrast to conservative individuals or policies that seek incremental change
632080	633920	or to preserve what exists in the present.
633920	639680	What's interesting is that this does not seem like it is inherently right-wing.
639680	642400	Conservatives generally want incremental change.
642400	645600	They don't want radical change, whether it's a radical leap forward
645600	647680	or radically regressing backwards.
647680	650240	Basically, conservatives want to take things slow,
650240	652960	while reactionaries seem to want to do things quite quickly.
652960	656560	And the use of the term in this context has been picking up steam.
656560	659600	You'll find it in the bios of these far-left Twitter nutjobs,
659600	662160	just like you'll find it in the comments of YouTube videos.
662160	664800	A quick search of Vosch himself using the term
664800	667520	seems to show that it's one of his most popular of all time.
667520	669920	I'm going to be seeing that Twitch deer girl
669920	673200	in reactionary YouTube thumbnails for the next six months, aren't I?
673840	677200	You know, it's almost like somebody did something wrong
677200	679760	and people are reasonable to react to that.
679760	682480	Like, if somebody burst into my house,
682480	685600	jumped up on top of my kitchen table and started taking a shit,
685600	687600	is the fact that I'm reacting to it negative?
688160	689360	I don't know, dude.
689360	694480	And of course, he views being labeled a reactionary as such a terrible thing
695120	697760	that he has to quantify it.
697760	702320	Like, I don't think you're a reactionary or I don't think this is reactionary.
702400	707360	As if having a reasonable reaction to a negative state of affairs is a bad thing.
707360	709680	Of course, he conflates conservatives and reactionaries
709680	712480	because to a revolutionary, somebody who wants to go slow
712480	714800	is the same thing as somebody who wants to go back.
714800	716560	But the funniest one of all is this one.
716560	721040	I'm done pretending tankies are just a quirky, harmless outlier to leftist communities.
721040	724400	From now on, I'll be treating them like the reactionaries they are.
724400	725120	The tankies?
725680	727280	They are your natural end result.
727840	728960	I know you don't like it.
728960	730080	I know you don't believe it.
730080	730960	I know you don't want to hear it.
731520	734560	But all communism, if given enough time
734560	738160	and enough room to advance and reach its natural end result,
738160	740080	it will always turn into the USSR.
740080	741520	It will always turn into China.
741520	745040	Anarcho-communism does not and cannot exist.
745040	747360	Anarcho-anything cannot exist.
747360	750960	As you like to say, human behavior trends towards cooperation.
750960	754800	And cooperation eventually is going to require some kind of hierarchy,
754800	756080	some kind of organization.
756080	760080	But more importantly than that, as soon as you have some kind of revolution
760080	761920	and somebody doesn't want to go along with you,
761920	764880	you will have to use state force in order to make them go along with you.
764880	768560	And that will necessitate an authoritarian communist state.
768560	771840	Vash, the tankies are just you in about 10 years.
772400	775360	So we have our definition of reactionary.
775360	779840	To these people, it's somebody who idealizes a previous political paradigm
779840	781120	and wants a return to that.
781120	784960	And in order to make that return happen, they want to reverse progress.
784960	787920	Of course, that means that I'm reactionary, according to these people,
787920	790320	even though there's really no evidence for that.
790320	792320	Just like there's no evidence for me being right-wing.
792320	794640	And a whole bunch of evidence for me not being right-wing.
794640	796240	But they don't really care about that.
796240	799280	But remember Vash conflating conservative and reactionary?
799280	802000	Conflating go slow with go backwards?
802000	806720	That is part of the you can't stand still on a moving train type of philosophy.
806720	809600	The point of the metaphor is that when a train is going forward,
809600	813120	even if you stand still while you're on it, you're still going forward.
813120	814880	And you really only have two choices.
814880	817200	Either go forward with the train or go backward.
817200	819600	This idea came from, I think, Howard Zinn.
819600	820160	He wrote,
820160	823840	You're on a train and somebody unseen is driving it somewhere bad.
823840	824960	You can jump off.
824960	826240	You can try to stop it.
826240	829200	Or you can sit there with your head down, minding your own business,
829200	830480	trying to stay out of trouble.
830480	831600	Neutrality.
831600	833440	Except you can't be neutral.
833440	836640	The train's moving and like it or not, you happen to be on it.
836640	838640	You're either resisting or complicit.
838640	841520	To this kind of radicalism, there can be no neutrality.
841520	847120	Which is why it will always be amusing to me to hear this come out of
848000	852080	when it was actually a hallmark of rightist thought during the George Bush era.
852800	857680	Every nation in every region now has a decision to make.
858960	863040	Either you are with us or you are with the terrorists.
864400	868080	Either you're with us, either you love freedom,
868080	871760	and with nations which embrace freedom, or you're with the enemy.
871760	872880	There's no in between.
872880	874320	You're either with us or you're with the enemy.
874320	875200	That's clear.
875200	876640	I will continue to make that clear.
877760	882080	If you're not with me, then you're my enemy.
882640	886960	But because Howard Zinn's idea states that there is no neutral,
886960	889600	only forward or backward, only pro or against,
889600	894000	that also means that in such conditions where there are many different options,
894000	900000	you know, like far right, right, center right, centrist, center left, left, far left,
900000	906240	in situations where in reality your choices consist of a wide spectrum of available options,
906240	909840	then everything gets boiled down to forward or backward by this philosophy.
909840	913280	And forward becomes everything that the speaker wants to be the truth,
913280	919120	or wants to be good, or personally advocates for, and backward becomes everything else.
919120	922160	That is how you get ridiculous posts like this,
922160	925520	where the radical views this to be the perception, you know,
925520	928720	all the various political figures on the political spectrum,
928720	932400	and they think the reality is everyone is jammed over towards the right,
932880	938640	Bernie Sanders is a centrist, and there is this fantasy land beyond the far left,
938640	940240	which is where they exist.
940240	944800	You have to have fully bought into this theory if you think this is the reality.
944800	946880	That's also how you get this diagram.
946880	949280	This is something that I used in one of my previous videos,
949280	952400	but it basically shows how my normal center left views
952400	956960	became alt right or far right or Nazi to the extremists on the left.
956960	960480	And in fact, one of the commie idiots tweeting at me a few months ago
960480	962720	really went into the nitty gritty of how this works.
963360	965120	Left has always been left.
965120	970560	Center left is just lip service while keeping the same damaging capitalist system flowing,
970560	975520	just like the right wing both give lip service to their sets of morals and keeps the rich rich.
975520	978720	This person views center left as right wing,
978720	982880	even though there are obvious differences between them, because it is all or nothing for them.
982880	987840	As time goes on and we progress, old left wing views turn right,
987840	991120	and those stuck in them try to conserve them even when they're wrong.
991120	995280	She is outright admitting that the shifting of the overton window,
995280	1000720	the pushing of things ever more leftward, and the transformation of far left positions,
1000720	1006880	say 50 years ago, into center right or right wing is deliberate and intentional by these people.
1006880	1008640	This is why they will never stop.
1008640	1011680	It's why they will always descend into purity spirals,
1011680	1016960	expelling those who are not pure enough and splintering off into ever smaller special interest groups.
1016960	1020320	It's why their activists, even if they get everything that they want,
1020320	1023360	will invent new grievances and continue to push for them.
1023360	1026880	On the practical side of things it's because they've become a bureaucracy and just want more money.
1026880	1030320	But on the ideological side of things it's because they truly believe
1030320	1033760	that all things left are good and all things right are bad,
1033760	1037520	and that society is meant to trend ever more leftward over time.
1037520	1040960	And if you disagree with that you're just a reactionary.
1040960	1044160	Of course this person doesn't really know what they're talking about because
1044160	1046400	they immediately contradict themselves.
1046400	1049920	Literally your whole channel is right wing lol, you're against everything left.
1049920	1051840	Right to bear arms is also a left wing thing.
1051840	1056080	Well okay, even if we accept the idea that the right to bear arms is also a left wing thing,
1056080	1058320	well I believe in the right to bear arms.
1058320	1062160	So how can I possibly be against everything left by your own definition?
1062800	1064240	It's almost like you're an idiot.
1064240	1068960	The problem with their formulation of reactionary is that they don't understand that sometimes
1069600	1073440	if things are going badly it's actually a good idea to react to them.
1073440	1076800	Right now the left is going absolutely wild in the name of progress,
1076800	1079600	even though there's no actual progress to be had in what they're doing.
1079600	1082400	And if reasonable people, acting in good faith,
1082400	1085840	disagree with what the left is doing and in fact think that it's harmful,
1085840	1087920	is it not reasonable to react to that?
1087920	1090400	Self-defense is fundamentally reactionary.
1090400	1094720	If somebody's attacking you, you're reacting to that, but we consider that to be legitimate.
1094720	1097760	Stopping a thief or a rapist is reactionary.
1097760	1101600	You are reacting to a bad situation, but we consider that to be legitimate.
1101600	1105600	In reality, the word reactionary is a label they slap onto those
1105600	1107840	who they think is opposed to the revolution.
1107840	1112640	If they use that label in a way that shows that they believe it to be completely interchangeable
1112640	1117040	with right-wing or conservative or center-right or even centrist, like someone like Vosch,
1117040	1121600	then that person has basically shown themselves to only believe in one type of politics,
1121600	1124400	the correct politics, as if there could ever be a thing.
1124400	1128320	They have shown that they don't believe in spectrums, in degrees of things,
1128320	1131440	that everything is in fact either with them or against them.
1131440	1134880	And yes, I know that these people give lip service to the idea of the whole
1134880	1136160	gender is a spectrum thing.
1136160	1138960	Let's be honest, they don't really believe that either.
1138960	1142240	That's why when you get biological males transitioning and becoming trans women,
1142240	1143440	they're completely okay with it.
1143440	1147280	But as soon as you get a lot of biological women transitioning to be trans men,
1147280	1149760	then suddenly it becomes a big fucking crisis.
1149760	1153840	If this article said, why do so many teenage boys want to change gender,
1153840	1158160	and what's behind it and has the NHS been too quick to find a solution?
1158160	1161360	This website would be shut down for transphobia immediately.
1161360	1164480	But it's because they really don't believe in gender as a spectrum.
1164480	1168000	They see things in terms of male and non-male, and that's it.
1168000	1171360	And non-male includes women, it includes genderqueer people,
1171360	1174240	it includes non-binary people, and it includes trans women.
1174240	1177600	To them, any avenue that takes you away from maleness is legitimate,
1177600	1180480	and any avenue that brings you towards maleness is not.
1180480	1183200	Therefore, trans women are fine and trans men are a problem.
1183200	1186000	In this way, the left is actually remarkably transphobic.
1186000	1189360	There is also another great critique of their concept of reactionary.
1189360	1191920	It is that they are all themselves reactionary.
1191920	1195840	The person who uses the term to label their political opponents as reactionary,
1195840	1197440	they are reactionaries themselves.
1197440	1199600	For example, communism is a dead ideology.
1199600	1202080	It was conceived of like 150 years ago,
1202080	1205840	in reaction to a problem within capitalism that has largely been solved.
1205840	1207760	Seriously, go talk to a commie on Twitter.
1207760	1211920	They'll talk about working conditions in factories like there are still factories in the West.
1211920	1214720	Like the economy hasn't changed in 150 years.
1214720	1216640	They are part of a previous political paradigm,
1216640	1219280	and they don't understand that capitalism has moved past them.
1219680	1221120	Look at the definition again.
1221120	1224960	It's literally somebody who pines for a previous political paradigm.
1224960	1229120	So would that mean that a communist in modern day Russia is a reactionary?
1229120	1232480	Because Russia transitioned away from communism after the fall of the Soviet Union?
1232480	1234960	Would that mean that somebody in Nazi Germany
1234960	1237760	was a reactionary if they wanted to go back to the Weimar Republic?
1237760	1240240	By their own definition, yeah, kinda.
1240240	1245520	The previous political paradigm ran basically from Bush Senior through the two Clinton terms,
1245520	1248880	through the two Bush Junior terms, and then through the two Obama terms.
1248880	1254080	That was the paradigm of Neolibs and Neocons basically being two sides of the same coin.
1254080	1256000	They only really differed on social issues,
1256000	1259360	but on economic issues, on foreign policy, they were pretty much the same.
1259360	1263760	That is why, by the way, Obama expanded on a lot of George Bush's programs.
1263760	1267600	He kept the wars up, the drone strikes up, a lot of the economic policies were similar.
1267600	1272080	Obama did a lot of superficial stuff, there were a few social advancements made,
1272080	1275920	but for the most part he was just George Bush terms three and four.
1275920	1277040	But Trump is different.
1277600	1282320	Better or worse, regardless of whether or not you like him, he is a different kind of politician.
1282320	1285280	He is not part of the Neolib-Neocon consensus.
1285280	1289840	And the immense amount of backlash he's received for the past four years
1289840	1294880	has been in part because the left has become an entirely reactionary force.
1294880	1296960	We all know that when push comes to shove,
1296960	1301520	people like Vashj, people on the far left, will hold their nose and vote for Biden.
1301520	1302880	They will cuck out.
1302880	1304880	They will not stand by their principles.
1304880	1308720	They will throw their lot in with the Neolibs even as they talk about hating them.
1308720	1311840	And to be honest, everything that's been happening recently has all been
1311840	1314880	a neoliberal counter-revolution to use their term.
1314880	1316320	It's all been reactionary.
1316320	1320640	When Trump got elected, that class of Neolibs and Neocons
1320640	1326080	that had acquired positions and money and power and influence as a result of globalist policies
1326080	1329920	were, for the first time in decades, thrown out of power.
1329920	1333040	Voters across the world chose Brexit, they chose Trump,
1333040	1337440	they chose populism, and they chose, in a sense, conservative nationalism.
1337440	1339280	That is the direction politics have gone.
1339280	1343600	But it's not simply Nazism or fascism just because it's nationalist.
1343600	1345600	It is a different kind of politics.
1345600	1349200	The only way you would view it as fascism is if you actually believe
1349200	1352000	that everything is either you or not you.
1352000	1353920	If you are that much of a tribalist.
1353920	1356560	If you believe that you can't be neutral on a moving train.
1356560	1358720	But because it is a new political era,
1358720	1362320	the left losing its shit for the past four years has been reactionary.
1362320	1366480	And those people on the ground, you know, the rioters, the people in Chaz, the protesters,
1366480	1370080	even the peaceful protesters, YouTubers like Vosh, idiots on Twitter,
1370080	1374560	even if they spout Marxist rhetoric, even if they genuinely believe that they are communists,
1374560	1377280	and they want to implement communism upon the world and the whole thing,
1377280	1380640	their rhetoric and their beliefs even don't actually matter that much.
1380640	1387200	Because they are simply being used by the old Neolib-Neocon establishment as reactionaries.
1387200	1389760	That's why the biggest push has come from the institutions.
1389760	1396640	Academia, media, large corporations, experts, whatever the fuck those are, big tech,
1396640	1399760	you know, money is pouring into Black Lives Matter, pouring into all these groups.
1399760	1404240	When these large monoliths are lining up behind the rank and file protesters
1404240	1409360	and chanting Viva La Revolution, we know it's not a revolution, it is a reaction.
1409360	1411920	These groups do not seek a radically new arrangement.
1412560	1416320	They seek a return to the pre-Trump, pre-Brexit status quo.
1416320	1417680	That's why they back Biden.
1417680	1420800	And as much as you have people crying about how terrible Biden is,
1420800	1425120	and how they're never voting for Biden, and how the DNC screwed them and all that,
1425120	1430560	and how he's not socialist enough or whatever the fuck, they will still cuck out and vote for him.
1430560	1434960	We are ultimately facing a leftist counter-revolution, as strange as it sounds,
1434960	1437600	because counter-revolution is a communist term.
1437600	1441200	And it makes sense because the way that the communists use reactionary,
1441200	1443040	they simply mean counter-revolutionary.
1443040	1446240	If you are a person who opposes communism for one of the many,
1446240	1451440	many different reasons that various groups oppose communism, you are a counter-revolutionary.
1451440	1455200	And they basically use the term reactionary to refer to counter-revolutionary.
1455200	1459040	But there are so many examples of these people being reactionaries themselves,
1459040	1461120	that it would take me way too long to go through them all.
1461120	1462480	This video is already long enough.
1462480	1465520	How many of you have seen this, the Democracy Matters Strategic Plan for Action?
1466160	1467600	Apparently it's private and confidential.
1467600	1468160	Uh, oops.
1469840	1471680	And it comes out of Media Matters for America.
1472320	1474560	This is not what we plan, but it's what we're built for.
1474560	1475760	Like, listen to this.
1475760	1479600	Trump has the legal authority, but we have the moral authority
1479600	1482240	and the moral responsibility to oppose him.
1482240	1485600	We are going to resist the normalization of Donald Trump.
1485600	1487760	These are the words of a reactionary.
1487760	1491520	These are the words of people who want to go back to the previous political paradigm.
1491520	1494160	The old era where neo-libs and neo-cons ran everything.
1494160	1495520	Well, we're not in that era anymore.
1496080	1497200	We have advanced.
1497200	1499200	We have moved forward, as you would say.
1499200	1504160	And using your logic, if you don't get on board with the present, then you are a force of the past.
1504160	1507520	By their own definition, they are reactionaries.
1507520	1514640	They still believe that the GOP is like the 1990s neo-con party run by Pat Robertson types
1514640	1518080	who want to censor rap music and video games like Jack Thompson or something.
1518080	1519200	But that's not the case.
1519200	1520960	The political landscape has changed.
1520960	1523200	Those old guard neo-cons are gone.
1523760	1525600	The last one left is what, Mitt Romney?
1525600	1527360	No one gives a shit about Mitt Romney anymore.
1527360	1529120	Trump has successfully routed them.
1529120	1531280	Meanwhile, the neo-libs are globalists.
1531280	1534640	They have that in common with the communists, who want global communism.
1534640	1539840	And so, every single leftist movement, supported by every single leftist YouTuber and commentator
1539840	1543760	and reactionary, want to go back to that previous status quo.
1543760	1547840	Even if they say they don't, the end result of their efforts will either be a reactionary
1547840	1552560	return to normalcy, as Biden likes to call it, the return to the old neo-lib status quo
1552560	1557280	that we have since moved past, or alternatively, a return much further backward.
1557280	1559680	A return to the failed system of communism.
1559680	1564400	A return to the gulags, to the millions of deaths, to the complete squalor of the entire
1564400	1565280	human race.
1565280	1569600	Because no matter how often they talk about being anarcho-anything, it will always end
1569600	1570960	up looking like the Soviet Union.
1570960	1572720	So, that is what a reactionary is.
1573440	1576560	If someone calls you a reactionary, it's because they're a revolutionary.
1576560	1581680	It's because they believe that all things under the sun, all of politics, can be boiled
1581680	1584080	down to either them or the fascists.
1584080	1586720	And if you're not them, then you're the fascists.
1586720	1591360	It's because they believe that politics has a moral arc, and that if you don't have
1591360	1593920	the correct politics, you need to be purged.
1593920	1598320	And it's because, regardless of what they believe, they want to implement totalitarian
1598320	1599200	communism.
1599200	1600400	And we have to stop them.
1600400	1601840	Alright guys, I'm getting out of here.
1601840	1602640	It's a nice day.
1602640	1603840	Naomi and I are going to the beach.
1604560	1605760	I'll talk to you soon.
1605760	1606560	I love you.
