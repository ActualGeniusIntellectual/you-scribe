0	4840	Alright my friends, the Project Melody video is recorded and mostly edited, however the
4840	9080	reason it's not coming out today is because basically I commissioned some art for it and
9080	13560	the artwork is not ready yet, so I guess we'll do the weekly coronavirus update instead.
13560	21100	Here's how things are looking, 75,752 cases, again, most of them are in China, only triple
21100	25440	digits, others, whatever others is, probably take those ships that are anchored off the
25440	29040	coast of Japan or whatever, and 104 in South Korea.
29040	33040	Most other places don't have that many cases in fact.
33040	37080	Canada is still at 8, UK is still at 9, the US is at 15.
37080	42800	Most places are probably not going to experience such a widespread outbreak as China has.
42800	46840	However, keep in mind, we still know that this virus can survive for several weeks outside
46840	51040	of the body, and we also know that it incubates for several weeks inside the body before you
51040	54960	actually start showing symptoms, and during that entire time you are infectious.
54960	57080	So who knows how far this thing's going to go?
57080	61220	Also maybe you'll notice here in the corner that there's this weird graph regarding the
61220	65440	actual explosion of cases and how it spikes up here.
65440	70320	What's going on is that China's basically been routinely and repeatedly fucking with
70320	75140	how they report their cases, the methodology that they use to say that this is a case or
75140	79200	this isn't a case, and they're doing this to try and basically put the best possible
79200	84080	light on it because it's becoming very clear that China's been absolutely terrible this
84080	86920	whole time, and they don't really want that to get out, and so they're just trying to
86920	89400	put the best possible spin on the whole situation.
89400	92440	Unfortunately for them, it hasn't actually made the situation any better.
92440	95280	I'm sure at this point you guys have noticed that underneath every YouTube video about
95280	99320	the coronavirus there's a YouTube-sponsored link leading you to the website of the World
99320	100320	Health Organization.
100320	104320	I'm also sure you've noticed that if you search on Twitter or Google or something, it'll also
104320	109400	either send you to the WHO's website or it'll send you to your local health website.
109400	111360	If you're in the UK, it'll send you to the NHS.
111360	113760	If you're in Canada, it'll send you to the Ministry of Health.
113760	116760	Obviously social media is really clamping down on this topic in a way that they didn't
116760	121760	with Ebola or bird flu or swine flu or SARS or anything like that.
121760	126440	They really want to make sure that only authoritative sources appear at the top of the search.
126440	130640	And here is what that heralded WHO has to say for themselves.
130640	150600	There's no other way to put it, man.
150600	152000	Like what are we supposed to admire?
152000	156920	We're supposed to admire of doctors who warn the citizens and the world of the peril and
156920	161560	they get censored or quietly poisoned or they get infected themselves and they're just
161560	162560	left to die.
162560	166220	Should we applaud the censorship of journalists or the welding of people's doors shut or the
166220	170800	turning off of elevators in these apartment blocks or any of the other scummy things that
170800	171800	China has done?
171800	174560	The WHO is a fucking joke at this point, dude.
174560	178120	Also thanks to some independent journalists over there, we do have at least trickles of
178120	179120	news.
179120	180360	This is really a bombshell.
180360	184580	Naval University of Engineering in Wuhan, one of the five comprehensive military universities
184580	190120	of the PLA, issued a lockdown notice on January 2nd, 18 days before the government admitted
190120	191120	there was an epidemic.
191120	194980	There's also rumors that if you're part of the military or you're part of the Communist
194980	199480	Party and you get infected, your chance of surviving the infection is much higher, as
199480	201260	is your quality of care.
201260	202860	Who's surprised?
202860	206820	They definitely knew beforehand and they definitely did their own prep before letting everyone
206820	210780	else know, just so that they could ensure that the power structure of China remains
210780	211780	intact.
211980	215540	William Yang also has a running thread on Twitter talking about latest cases and latest
215540	216900	news.
216900	221460	Singapore had nine new cases on Friday, adding the total case to 67.
221460	225460	So they do have native transmission over there, as in not people from China, but going from
225460	226940	person to person.
226940	231740	Japan added two more cases, one is a 16-year-old man who had cold symptoms since February 3rd
231740	233740	and it turned into pneumonia.
233740	237180	The other patient is in his 50s and receiving treatment.
237180	240500	Beijing announced a 14-day self-quarantine or concentrated quarantine on anyone returning
240500	241700	to Beijing.
241700	245620	Those refusing to comply with the quarantine will face legal consequences.
245620	248540	Of course China, of course.
248540	252660	Since returning to work this week, four companies in China have reported group infection cases,
252660	256940	one in Chongqing, one in Shuzhou, one in Hunan, and one in Shaanxi.
256940	261660	Southern India reported a suspected case, causing 3,218 people being quarantined and
261660	266760	the local government is monitoring another 3,252 people, 34 were quarantined in hospitals.
266760	269300	The local government has set off a major epidemic coping mechanism.
269300	274140	So it does seem like slowly more and more people are losing their heads over this thing.
274140	277660	I don't think it can be contained anymore, I think it's now just out there and we're
277660	280940	just going to have to deal with it on a case-by-case basis.
280940	283420	There is no more quarantine for this, I don't think.
283420	288060	And for all those people out there who just love Trump, keep in mind that he's still Trump
288060	292740	and he still makes all the same mistakes, gaffes, and blunders that he usually makes.
292740	297740	Trump defends China's alleged cover-up because you don't want the world to go crazy.
297740	302060	And he also claimed, without evidence, that the disease will go away by April.
302060	304800	Yeah, Trump.
304800	307820	You know, I can say with a straight face that this is one of those times where I actually
307820	309060	disagree with Trump.
309060	312220	I think this is probably not the right take to have here, dude.
312220	315220	I think they want to put their best face on it, so you know what I mean, if somebody,
315220	318340	if you're running it, you probably wouldn't want to run it into the world and go crazy
318340	321460	and start saying whatever it is because you don't want to create a panic.
321460	324660	Yeah, but I mean, we've seen the alternative, though, Trump.
324660	327340	We've seen what China's been doing and it's not better.
327340	328340	It's certainly worse.
328340	332460	And yeah, he says the virus will likely go away by April and that Beijing has handled
332460	334260	the epidemic very professionally.
334260	338300	Yeah, this is one time where I have to say no, Trump.
338300	339300	No.
339300	340940	Hey, you guys want to see how retarded Vox is?
340940	341940	I do.
341940	345460	The coronavirus exposes the history of racism and cleanliness.
345460	349260	While the epidemic may be new, xenophobia has been intertwined with public health discourse
349260	350260	for a very long time.
350260	351940	Yeah, see, I understand what they're going for.
351940	356220	They're going to talk about, like, what was it called?
356220	357220	Mad cow disease.
357220	358220	Right.
358220	362740	Where recently, within the past 20 or 30 years, we had mad cow disease because farmers were
362740	365340	feeding cow parts to other cows.
365340	368220	And basically the point of this article is to, I'm not going to go over it because it's
368220	373300	literally just Vox stupidity, but the point of this article is to talk about how dirty
373300	378420	Western culture has also been in its past and therefore we shouldn't be calling Chinese
378420	381940	culture dirty because that's racism and it's xenophobia.
381940	386620	And it's like, well, you know, it was Western culture that developed germ theory and most
386620	388100	medical advances.
388100	390540	The dirtiness of our past that was in the past.
390540	393700	Meanwhile, traditional Chinese culture is quite dirty right now.
393700	396580	It's not consistent to compare our past with somebody else's present.
396580	401360	In any case, this was Vox's take on February 7th, February 14th, one week later, why the
401360	404140	coronavirus outbreak might be much bigger than we know.
404140	409260	Oh, Vox, are you suddenly bigoted now?
409260	413140	Are you suddenly being xenophobic and sinophobic against those Chinese people?
413140	415740	Here's probably the most important bit of news though.
415740	420060	South China university of technology biologist has exposed that the coronavirus might have
420060	425300	originated from an animal research lab 280 meters away from the epicenter of the outbreak.
425300	429340	The scientists were reportedly bitten by bats used for a test.
429340	432140	The possible origins of the coronavirus.
432140	435660	Two descriptions of the virus published on nature this week indicated that the genome
435660	442900	sequences from patients were 96% or 89% identical to the bat coronavirus originally found in
442900	443900	the lab.
443900	447920	It was critical to study where the pathogen came from and how it passed on to humans.
447920	451260	The market was suspected to be the origin of the epidemic and was shut down according
451260	453060	to the rule of quarantine.
453060	457480	The bats carrying the virus were originally found in Yunnan or Zhejiang province, both
457480	461580	of which were more than 900 kilometers away from the seafood market.
461580	465400	Bats are normally found to live in caves and trees, but the seafood market is a densely
465400	467320	populated district of Wuhan.
467320	470280	The probability was very low that bats could fly to the market.
470280	474120	According to municipal reports and the testimonies of 31 residents and 28 visitors, the bat was
474120	477760	never a food source in the city and no bat was traded in the market.
477760	482400	In summary, somebody was entangled with the evolution of the coronavirus.
482400	486760	In addition to the origins of natural recombination intermediate host, the killer coronavirus
486760	489400	probably originated from a laboratory in Wuhan.
489400	493400	Safety levels may need to be reinforced in high risk biohazardous laboratories.
493400	494880	NO SHIT DUDE.
494880	499880	In one of the studies, 155 bats were captured in Hubei province and another 450 bats were
499880	501540	captured in Zhejiang province.
501540	505740	The expert in collection was broadcasted for collecting viruses on nationwide newspapers
505740	508020	and websites in 2017 and 2019.
508020	512720	He described that he was once attacked by bats and the blood of a bat shot on his skin.
512720	516200	He knew the extreme danger of infection so he quarantined himself for 14 days.
516200	520000	In another incident, he quarantined himself again because bats peed on him.
520000	522880	He was once thrilled for capturing a bat carrying a live tick.
522880	527280	And of course, here's the map, there's the Wuhan Center for Disease Control and Prevention,
527280	529220	and there's the Hunanan Seafood Market.
529220	533120	They are 277 meters or 911 feet away from each other.
533120	536620	I guarantee you what happened is that somebody was studying bats in there, something transmitted
536620	540600	from a bat to a human while these scientists were working, then they decided to go and
540600	541960	have lunch at the seafood market.
541960	543960	I'm pretty sure that's what happened guys.
543960	548080	But as the months go on, we continue to discover more and more about what this virus may potentially
548080	549080	do.
549080	552240	This is not completely confirmed yet but these are the initial reports.
552240	555520	Various research published by Chinese scientists say coronavirus might render certain male
555520	557660	patients infertile.
557660	561240	So if you get it, you recover from it, you might not be having kids.
561240	566680	Doctor in Hubei, China warns Wuhan novel coronavirus causes sudden heart attack during second infection.
566680	570400	As the antibodies against the virus do not work during the second infection, the infection
570400	573440	can cause heart failure and further sudden death.
573440	577920	This might actually explain why despite the reported symptoms that we keep hearing about,
577920	582120	there have been those dramatic videos of people in China who just like dropped dead because
582120	586600	they might have had the coronavirus before and they have like maybe a little flu or something
586600	589920	they just stayed in bed for a few days thought it was fine and they catch it again and they
589920	591020	fucking die.
591020	595600	And despite this being, you know, China, Chinese scientists are finally speaking out in mass
595600	599920	saying that it probably came from the government bioweapons research facility in Wuhan and
599920	603800	that it's probably a lot more dangerous than everyone has been saying so far.
603800	606280	Meanwhile scientists are disappearing.
606280	611360	There was a renowned law professor who spoke out against the president, Xi Jinping.
611360	612360	He disappeared.
612360	613900	Journalists are disappearing.
613900	615880	China is just trying to make this go away.
615880	617900	So where does that leave us?
617900	620080	Is this truly the end of days or something?
620080	621580	No, I still don't think so.
621580	625940	These are initial reports, not necessarily confirmed by multiple sources yet.
625940	629020	And even if they are confirmed, that makes this a very deadly virus that we have to watch
629020	630020	out for.
630020	631840	But I don't think it means the end of human civilization.
631840	635080	It might mean the end of China, but certainly not the rest of us.
635080	639560	But as shipping from China starts to close down and travel is being blocked by more and
639560	643960	more nations, even the Russians have decided to block travel to China today, in fact.
643960	647260	I'll leave you with the same advice that I've left you in the previous videos.
647260	648260	Don't panic.
648260	651140	Stock up on some food just in case there's local shortages.
651140	655280	Keep some dried beans and dried rice, maybe some canned food hanging around your house.
655280	659040	Enough to last for a few weeks in case there's a local shortage because that is what's likely
659040	661260	to hurt you at this point, not the virus.
661260	665680	Let's say you live in a medium sized city and there's one case of coronavirus in your
665680	667680	city and the guy goes to the hospital.
667680	668960	He's quarantined.
668960	672060	He's treated properly and there is no outbreak.
672060	673780	During that time, people will be panicking.
673780	675220	There will be riots at grocery stores.
675220	676220	The shelves might be empty.
676220	678200	There might be no shipping for a couple of weeks even.
678200	682840	Your best bet is to have some food in storage so that you could basically ride it out if
682840	683840	you had to.
683840	688060	I've got like a 10 pound sack of rice and then maybe five pounds of red kidney beans
688060	689060	or so.
689060	692280	That stuff will just stay on the shelf and it's good for the next couple of years, that
692280	693280	kind of stuff.
693280	695240	So even if there is no problem, we just have some food saved up.
695240	696240	It's not a big deal.
696240	699360	The sub-ree starts getting hit with the coronavirus and suddenly all the grocery stores have no
699360	701160	food in them because everyone's grabbing stuff.
701160	702760	You don't want to be out there in that mob.
702760	707280	So yeah, keep your cool, don't lose your head over it, stock up on some basic supplies
707280	710080	and you know, we're all probably going to make it.
710080	711080	Don't worry about it.
711080	712080	I love you.
712080	712100	Good luck.
