00:00.000 --> 00:04.840
Alright my friends, the Project Melody video is recorded and mostly edited, however the

00:04.840 --> 00:09.080
reason it's not coming out today is because basically I commissioned some art for it and

00:09.080 --> 00:13.560
the artwork is not ready yet, so I guess we'll do the weekly coronavirus update instead.

00:13.560 --> 00:21.100
Here's how things are looking, 75,752 cases, again, most of them are in China, only triple

00:21.100 --> 00:25.440
digits, others, whatever others is, probably take those ships that are anchored off the

00:25.440 --> 00:29.040
coast of Japan or whatever, and 104 in South Korea.

00:29.040 --> 00:33.040
Most other places don't have that many cases in fact.

00:33.040 --> 00:37.080
Canada is still at 8, UK is still at 9, the US is at 15.

00:37.080 --> 00:42.800
Most places are probably not going to experience such a widespread outbreak as China has.

00:42.800 --> 00:46.840
However, keep in mind, we still know that this virus can survive for several weeks outside

00:46.840 --> 00:51.040
of the body, and we also know that it incubates for several weeks inside the body before you

00:51.040 --> 00:54.960
actually start showing symptoms, and during that entire time you are infectious.

00:54.960 --> 00:57.080
So who knows how far this thing's going to go?

00:57.080 --> 01:01.220
Also maybe you'll notice here in the corner that there's this weird graph regarding the

01:01.220 --> 01:05.440
actual explosion of cases and how it spikes up here.

01:05.440 --> 01:10.320
What's going on is that China's basically been routinely and repeatedly fucking with

01:10.320 --> 01:15.140
how they report their cases, the methodology that they use to say that this is a case or

01:15.140 --> 01:19.200
this isn't a case, and they're doing this to try and basically put the best possible

01:19.200 --> 01:24.080
light on it because it's becoming very clear that China's been absolutely terrible this

01:24.080 --> 01:26.920
whole time, and they don't really want that to get out, and so they're just trying to

01:26.920 --> 01:29.400
put the best possible spin on the whole situation.

01:29.400 --> 01:32.440
Unfortunately for them, it hasn't actually made the situation any better.

01:32.440 --> 01:35.280
I'm sure at this point you guys have noticed that underneath every YouTube video about

01:35.280 --> 01:39.320
the coronavirus there's a YouTube-sponsored link leading you to the website of the World

01:39.320 --> 01:40.320
Health Organization.

01:40.320 --> 01:44.320
I'm also sure you've noticed that if you search on Twitter or Google or something, it'll also

01:44.320 --> 01:49.400
either send you to the WHO's website or it'll send you to your local health website.

01:49.400 --> 01:51.360
If you're in the UK, it'll send you to the NHS.

01:51.360 --> 01:53.760
If you're in Canada, it'll send you to the Ministry of Health.

01:53.760 --> 01:56.760
Obviously social media is really clamping down on this topic in a way that they didn't

01:56.760 --> 02:01.760
with Ebola or bird flu or swine flu or SARS or anything like that.

02:01.760 --> 02:06.440
They really want to make sure that only authoritative sources appear at the top of the search.

02:06.440 --> 02:10.640
And here is what that heralded WHO has to say for themselves.

02:10.640 --> 02:30.600
There's no other way to put it, man.

02:30.600 --> 02:32.000
Like what are we supposed to admire?

02:32.000 --> 02:36.920
We're supposed to admire of doctors who warn the citizens and the world of the peril and

02:36.920 --> 02:41.560
they get censored or quietly poisoned or they get infected themselves and they're just

02:41.560 --> 02:42.560
left to die.

02:42.560 --> 02:46.220
Should we applaud the censorship of journalists or the welding of people's doors shut or the

02:46.220 --> 02:50.800
turning off of elevators in these apartment blocks or any of the other scummy things that

02:50.800 --> 02:51.800
China has done?

02:51.800 --> 02:54.560
The WHO is a fucking joke at this point, dude.

02:54.560 --> 02:58.120
Also thanks to some independent journalists over there, we do have at least trickles of

02:58.120 --> 02:59.120
news.

02:59.120 --> 03:00.360
This is really a bombshell.

03:00.360 --> 03:04.580
Naval University of Engineering in Wuhan, one of the five comprehensive military universities

03:04.580 --> 03:10.120
of the PLA, issued a lockdown notice on January 2nd, 18 days before the government admitted

03:10.120 --> 03:11.120
there was an epidemic.

03:11.120 --> 03:14.980
There's also rumors that if you're part of the military or you're part of the Communist

03:14.980 --> 03:19.480
Party and you get infected, your chance of surviving the infection is much higher, as

03:19.480 --> 03:21.260
is your quality of care.

03:21.260 --> 03:22.860
Who's surprised?

03:22.860 --> 03:26.820
They definitely knew beforehand and they definitely did their own prep before letting everyone

03:26.820 --> 03:30.780
else know, just so that they could ensure that the power structure of China remains

03:30.780 --> 03:31.780
intact.

03:31.980 --> 03:35.540
William Yang also has a running thread on Twitter talking about latest cases and latest

03:35.540 --> 03:36.900
news.

03:36.900 --> 03:41.460
Singapore had nine new cases on Friday, adding the total case to 67.

03:41.460 --> 03:45.460
So they do have native transmission over there, as in not people from China, but going from

03:45.460 --> 03:46.940
person to person.

03:46.940 --> 03:51.740
Japan added two more cases, one is a 16-year-old man who had cold symptoms since February 3rd

03:51.740 --> 03:53.740
and it turned into pneumonia.

03:53.740 --> 03:57.180
The other patient is in his 50s and receiving treatment.

03:57.180 --> 04:00.500
Beijing announced a 14-day self-quarantine or concentrated quarantine on anyone returning

04:00.500 --> 04:01.700
to Beijing.

04:01.700 --> 04:05.620
Those refusing to comply with the quarantine will face legal consequences.

04:05.620 --> 04:08.540
Of course China, of course.

04:08.540 --> 04:12.660
Since returning to work this week, four companies in China have reported group infection cases,

04:12.660 --> 04:16.940
one in Chongqing, one in Shuzhou, one in Hunan, and one in Shaanxi.

04:16.940 --> 04:21.660
Southern India reported a suspected case, causing 3,218 people being quarantined and

04:21.660 --> 04:26.760
the local government is monitoring another 3,252 people, 34 were quarantined in hospitals.

04:26.760 --> 04:29.300
The local government has set off a major epidemic coping mechanism.

04:29.300 --> 04:34.140
So it does seem like slowly more and more people are losing their heads over this thing.

04:34.140 --> 04:37.660
I don't think it can be contained anymore, I think it's now just out there and we're

04:37.660 --> 04:40.940
just going to have to deal with it on a case-by-case basis.

04:40.940 --> 04:43.420
There is no more quarantine for this, I don't think.

04:43.420 --> 04:48.060
And for all those people out there who just love Trump, keep in mind that he's still Trump

04:48.060 --> 04:52.740
and he still makes all the same mistakes, gaffes, and blunders that he usually makes.

04:52.740 --> 04:57.740
Trump defends China's alleged cover-up because you don't want the world to go crazy.

04:57.740 --> 05:02.060
And he also claimed, without evidence, that the disease will go away by April.

05:02.060 --> 05:04.800
Yeah, Trump.

05:04.800 --> 05:07.820
You know, I can say with a straight face that this is one of those times where I actually

05:07.820 --> 05:09.060
disagree with Trump.

05:09.060 --> 05:12.220
I think this is probably not the right take to have here, dude.

05:12.220 --> 05:15.220
I think they want to put their best face on it, so you know what I mean, if somebody,

05:15.220 --> 05:18.340
if you're running it, you probably wouldn't want to run it into the world and go crazy

05:18.340 --> 05:21.460
and start saying whatever it is because you don't want to create a panic.

05:21.460 --> 05:24.660
Yeah, but I mean, we've seen the alternative, though, Trump.

05:24.660 --> 05:27.340
We've seen what China's been doing and it's not better.

05:27.340 --> 05:28.340
It's certainly worse.

05:28.340 --> 05:32.460
And yeah, he says the virus will likely go away by April and that Beijing has handled

05:32.460 --> 05:34.260
the epidemic very professionally.

05:34.260 --> 05:38.300
Yeah, this is one time where I have to say no, Trump.

05:38.300 --> 05:39.300
No.

05:39.300 --> 05:40.940
Hey, you guys want to see how retarded Vox is?

05:40.940 --> 05:41.940
I do.

05:41.940 --> 05:45.460
The coronavirus exposes the history of racism and cleanliness.

05:45.460 --> 05:49.260
While the epidemic may be new, xenophobia has been intertwined with public health discourse

05:49.260 --> 05:50.260
for a very long time.

05:50.260 --> 05:51.940
Yeah, see, I understand what they're going for.

05:51.940 --> 05:56.220
They're going to talk about, like, what was it called?

05:56.220 --> 05:57.220
Mad cow disease.

05:57.220 --> 05:58.220
Right.

05:58.220 --> 06:02.740
Where recently, within the past 20 or 30 years, we had mad cow disease because farmers were

06:02.740 --> 06:05.340
feeding cow parts to other cows.

06:05.340 --> 06:08.220
And basically the point of this article is to, I'm not going to go over it because it's

06:08.220 --> 06:13.300
literally just Vox stupidity, but the point of this article is to talk about how dirty

06:13.300 --> 06:18.420
Western culture has also been in its past and therefore we shouldn't be calling Chinese

06:18.420 --> 06:21.940
culture dirty because that's racism and it's xenophobia.

06:21.940 --> 06:26.620
And it's like, well, you know, it was Western culture that developed germ theory and most

06:26.620 --> 06:28.100
medical advances.

06:28.100 --> 06:30.540
The dirtiness of our past that was in the past.

06:30.540 --> 06:33.700
Meanwhile, traditional Chinese culture is quite dirty right now.

06:33.700 --> 06:36.580
It's not consistent to compare our past with somebody else's present.

06:36.580 --> 06:41.360
In any case, this was Vox's take on February 7th, February 14th, one week later, why the

06:41.360 --> 06:44.140
coronavirus outbreak might be much bigger than we know.

06:44.140 --> 06:49.260
Oh, Vox, are you suddenly bigoted now?

06:49.260 --> 06:53.140
Are you suddenly being xenophobic and sinophobic against those Chinese people?

06:53.140 --> 06:55.740
Here's probably the most important bit of news though.

06:55.740 --> 07:00.060
South China university of technology biologist has exposed that the coronavirus might have

07:00.060 --> 07:05.300
originated from an animal research lab 280 meters away from the epicenter of the outbreak.

07:05.300 --> 07:09.340
The scientists were reportedly bitten by bats used for a test.

07:09.340 --> 07:12.140
The possible origins of the coronavirus.

07:12.140 --> 07:15.660
Two descriptions of the virus published on nature this week indicated that the genome

07:15.660 --> 07:22.900
sequences from patients were 96% or 89% identical to the bat coronavirus originally found in

07:22.900 --> 07:23.900
the lab.

07:23.900 --> 07:27.920
It was critical to study where the pathogen came from and how it passed on to humans.

07:27.920 --> 07:31.260
The market was suspected to be the origin of the epidemic and was shut down according

07:31.260 --> 07:33.060
to the rule of quarantine.

07:33.060 --> 07:37.480
The bats carrying the virus were originally found in Yunnan or Zhejiang province, both

07:37.480 --> 07:41.580
of which were more than 900 kilometers away from the seafood market.

07:41.580 --> 07:45.400
Bats are normally found to live in caves and trees, but the seafood market is a densely

07:45.400 --> 07:47.320
populated district of Wuhan.

07:47.320 --> 07:50.280
The probability was very low that bats could fly to the market.

07:50.280 --> 07:54.120
According to municipal reports and the testimonies of 31 residents and 28 visitors, the bat was

07:54.120 --> 07:57.760
never a food source in the city and no bat was traded in the market.

07:57.760 --> 08:02.400
In summary, somebody was entangled with the evolution of the coronavirus.

08:02.400 --> 08:06.760
In addition to the origins of natural recombination intermediate host, the killer coronavirus

08:06.760 --> 08:09.400
probably originated from a laboratory in Wuhan.

08:09.400 --> 08:13.400
Safety levels may need to be reinforced in high risk biohazardous laboratories.

08:13.400 --> 08:14.880
NO SHIT DUDE.

08:14.880 --> 08:19.880
In one of the studies, 155 bats were captured in Hubei province and another 450 bats were

08:19.880 --> 08:21.540
captured in Zhejiang province.

08:21.540 --> 08:25.740
The expert in collection was broadcasted for collecting viruses on nationwide newspapers

08:25.740 --> 08:28.020
and websites in 2017 and 2019.

08:28.020 --> 08:32.720
He described that he was once attacked by bats and the blood of a bat shot on his skin.

08:32.720 --> 08:36.200
He knew the extreme danger of infection so he quarantined himself for 14 days.

08:36.200 --> 08:40.000
In another incident, he quarantined himself again because bats peed on him.

08:40.000 --> 08:42.880
He was once thrilled for capturing a bat carrying a live tick.

08:42.880 --> 08:47.280
And of course, here's the map, there's the Wuhan Center for Disease Control and Prevention,

08:47.280 --> 08:49.220
and there's the Hunanan Seafood Market.

08:49.220 --> 08:53.120
They are 277 meters or 911 feet away from each other.

08:53.120 --> 08:56.620
I guarantee you what happened is that somebody was studying bats in there, something transmitted

08:56.620 --> 09:00.600
from a bat to a human while these scientists were working, then they decided to go and

09:00.600 --> 09:01.960
have lunch at the seafood market.

09:01.960 --> 09:03.960
I'm pretty sure that's what happened guys.

09:03.960 --> 09:08.080
But as the months go on, we continue to discover more and more about what this virus may potentially

09:08.080 --> 09:09.080
do.

09:09.080 --> 09:12.240
This is not completely confirmed yet but these are the initial reports.

09:12.240 --> 09:15.520
Various research published by Chinese scientists say coronavirus might render certain male

09:15.520 --> 09:17.660
patients infertile.

09:17.660 --> 09:21.240
So if you get it, you recover from it, you might not be having kids.

09:21.240 --> 09:26.680
Doctor in Hubei, China warns Wuhan novel coronavirus causes sudden heart attack during second infection.

09:26.680 --> 09:30.400
As the antibodies against the virus do not work during the second infection, the infection

09:30.400 --> 09:33.440
can cause heart failure and further sudden death.

09:33.440 --> 09:37.920
This might actually explain why despite the reported symptoms that we keep hearing about,

09:37.920 --> 09:42.120
there have been those dramatic videos of people in China who just like dropped dead because

09:42.120 --> 09:46.600
they might have had the coronavirus before and they have like maybe a little flu or something

09:46.600 --> 09:49.920
they just stayed in bed for a few days thought it was fine and they catch it again and they

09:49.920 --> 09:51.020
fucking die.

09:51.020 --> 09:55.600
And despite this being, you know, China, Chinese scientists are finally speaking out in mass

09:55.600 --> 09:59.920
saying that it probably came from the government bioweapons research facility in Wuhan and

09:59.920 --> 10:03.800
that it's probably a lot more dangerous than everyone has been saying so far.

10:03.800 --> 10:06.280
Meanwhile scientists are disappearing.

10:06.280 --> 10:11.360
There was a renowned law professor who spoke out against the president, Xi Jinping.

10:11.360 --> 10:12.360
He disappeared.

10:12.360 --> 10:13.900
Journalists are disappearing.

10:13.900 --> 10:15.880
China is just trying to make this go away.

10:15.880 --> 10:17.900
So where does that leave us?

10:17.900 --> 10:20.080
Is this truly the end of days or something?

10:20.080 --> 10:21.580
No, I still don't think so.

10:21.580 --> 10:25.940
These are initial reports, not necessarily confirmed by multiple sources yet.

10:25.940 --> 10:29.020
And even if they are confirmed, that makes this a very deadly virus that we have to watch

10:29.020 --> 10:30.020
out for.

10:30.020 --> 10:31.840
But I don't think it means the end of human civilization.

10:31.840 --> 10:35.080
It might mean the end of China, but certainly not the rest of us.

10:35.080 --> 10:39.560
But as shipping from China starts to close down and travel is being blocked by more and

10:39.560 --> 10:43.960
more nations, even the Russians have decided to block travel to China today, in fact.

10:43.960 --> 10:47.260
I'll leave you with the same advice that I've left you in the previous videos.

10:47.260 --> 10:48.260
Don't panic.

10:48.260 --> 10:51.140
Stock up on some food just in case there's local shortages.

10:51.140 --> 10:55.280
Keep some dried beans and dried rice, maybe some canned food hanging around your house.

10:55.280 --> 10:59.040
Enough to last for a few weeks in case there's a local shortage because that is what's likely

10:59.040 --> 11:01.260
to hurt you at this point, not the virus.

11:01.260 --> 11:05.680
Let's say you live in a medium sized city and there's one case of coronavirus in your

11:05.680 --> 11:07.680
city and the guy goes to the hospital.

11:07.680 --> 11:08.960
He's quarantined.

11:08.960 --> 11:12.060
He's treated properly and there is no outbreak.

11:12.060 --> 11:13.780
During that time, people will be panicking.

11:13.780 --> 11:15.220
There will be riots at grocery stores.

11:15.220 --> 11:16.220
The shelves might be empty.

11:16.220 --> 11:18.200
There might be no shipping for a couple of weeks even.

11:18.200 --> 11:22.840
Your best bet is to have some food in storage so that you could basically ride it out if

11:22.840 --> 11:23.840
you had to.

11:23.840 --> 11:28.060
I've got like a 10 pound sack of rice and then maybe five pounds of red kidney beans

11:28.060 --> 11:29.060
or so.

11:29.060 --> 11:32.280
That stuff will just stay on the shelf and it's good for the next couple of years, that

11:32.280 --> 11:33.280
kind of stuff.

11:33.280 --> 11:35.240
So even if there is no problem, we just have some food saved up.

11:35.240 --> 11:36.240
It's not a big deal.

11:36.240 --> 11:39.360
The sub-ree starts getting hit with the coronavirus and suddenly all the grocery stores have no

11:39.360 --> 11:41.160
food in them because everyone's grabbing stuff.

11:41.160 --> 11:42.760
You don't want to be out there in that mob.

11:42.760 --> 11:47.280
So yeah, keep your cool, don't lose your head over it, stock up on some basic supplies

11:47.280 --> 11:50.080
and you know, we're all probably going to make it.

11:50.080 --> 11:51.080
Don't worry about it.

11:51.080 --> 11:52.080
I love you.

11:52.080 --> 11:52.100
Good luck.
