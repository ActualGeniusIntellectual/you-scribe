1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,840
Alright my friends, the Project Melody video is recorded and mostly edited, however the

2
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:09,080
reason it's not coming out today is because basically I commissioned some art for it and

3
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:13,560
the artwork is not ready yet, so I guess we'll do the weekly coronavirus update instead.

4
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:21,100
Here's how things are looking, 75,752 cases, again, most of them are in China, only triple

5
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:25,440
digits, others, whatever others is, probably take those ships that are anchored off the

6
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:29,040
coast of Japan or whatever, and 104 in South Korea.

7
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:33,040
Most other places don't have that many cases in fact.

8
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:37,080
Canada is still at 8, UK is still at 9, the US is at 15.

9
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:42,800
Most places are probably not going to experience such a widespread outbreak as China has.

10
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:46,840
However, keep in mind, we still know that this virus can survive for several weeks outside

11
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:51,040
of the body, and we also know that it incubates for several weeks inside the body before you

12
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:54,960
actually start showing symptoms, and during that entire time you are infectious.

13
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:57,080
So who knows how far this thing's going to go?

14
00:00:57,080 --> 00:01:01,220
Also maybe you'll notice here in the corner that there's this weird graph regarding the

15
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:05,440
actual explosion of cases and how it spikes up here.

16
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:10,320
What's going on is that China's basically been routinely and repeatedly fucking with

17
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:15,140
how they report their cases, the methodology that they use to say that this is a case or

18
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:19,200
this isn't a case, and they're doing this to try and basically put the best possible

19
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:24,080
light on it because it's becoming very clear that China's been absolutely terrible this

20
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:26,920
whole time, and they don't really want that to get out, and so they're just trying to

21
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:29,400
put the best possible spin on the whole situation.

22
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:32,440
Unfortunately for them, it hasn't actually made the situation any better.

23
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:35,280
I'm sure at this point you guys have noticed that underneath every YouTube video about

24
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:39,320
the coronavirus there's a YouTube-sponsored link leading you to the website of the World

25
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:40,320
Health Organization.

26
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:44,320
I'm also sure you've noticed that if you search on Twitter or Google or something, it'll also

27
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:49,400
either send you to the WHO's website or it'll send you to your local health website.

28
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:51,360
If you're in the UK, it'll send you to the NHS.

29
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,760
If you're in Canada, it'll send you to the Ministry of Health.

30
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:56,760
Obviously social media is really clamping down on this topic in a way that they didn't

31
00:01:56,760 --> 00:02:01,760
with Ebola or bird flu or swine flu or SARS or anything like that.

32
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:06,440
They really want to make sure that only authoritative sources appear at the top of the search.

33
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:10,640
And here is what that heralded WHO has to say for themselves.

34
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:30,600
There's no other way to put it, man.

35
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,000
Like what are we supposed to admire?

36
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,920
We're supposed to admire of doctors who warn the citizens and the world of the peril and

37
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:41,560
they get censored or quietly poisoned or they get infected themselves and they're just

38
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:42,560
left to die.

39
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:46,220
Should we applaud the censorship of journalists or the welding of people's doors shut or the

40
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:50,800
turning off of elevators in these apartment blocks or any of the other scummy things that

41
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:51,800
China has done?

42
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:54,560
The WHO is a fucking joke at this point, dude.

43
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:58,120
Also thanks to some independent journalists over there, we do have at least trickles of

44
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,120
news.

45
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,360
This is really a bombshell.

46
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:04,580
Naval University of Engineering in Wuhan, one of the five comprehensive military universities

47
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:10,120
of the PLA, issued a lockdown notice on January 2nd, 18 days before the government admitted

48
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:11,120
there was an epidemic.

49
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:14,980
There's also rumors that if you're part of the military or you're part of the Communist

50
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:19,480
Party and you get infected, your chance of surviving the infection is much higher, as

51
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:21,260
is your quality of care.

52
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:22,860
Who's surprised?

53
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:26,820
They definitely knew beforehand and they definitely did their own prep before letting everyone

54
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:30,780
else know, just so that they could ensure that the power structure of China remains

55
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:31,780
intact.

56
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:35,540
William Yang also has a running thread on Twitter talking about latest cases and latest

57
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:36,900
news.

58
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:41,460
Singapore had nine new cases on Friday, adding the total case to 67.

59
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:45,460
So they do have native transmission over there, as in not people from China, but going from

60
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:46,940
person to person.

61
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:51,740
Japan added two more cases, one is a 16-year-old man who had cold symptoms since February 3rd

62
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:53,740
and it turned into pneumonia.

63
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:57,180
The other patient is in his 50s and receiving treatment.

64
00:03:57,180 --> 00:04:00,500
Beijing announced a 14-day self-quarantine or concentrated quarantine on anyone returning

65
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:01,700
to Beijing.

66
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:05,620
Those refusing to comply with the quarantine will face legal consequences.

67
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:08,540
Of course China, of course.

68
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:12,660
Since returning to work this week, four companies in China have reported group infection cases,

69
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:16,940
one in Chongqing, one in Shuzhou, one in Hunan, and one in Shaanxi.

70
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:21,660
Southern India reported a suspected case, causing 3,218 people being quarantined and

71
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:26,760
the local government is monitoring another 3,252 people, 34 were quarantined in hospitals.

72
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:29,300
The local government has set off a major epidemic coping mechanism.

73
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:34,140
So it does seem like slowly more and more people are losing their heads over this thing.

74
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:37,660
I don't think it can be contained anymore, I think it's now just out there and we're

75
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:40,940
just going to have to deal with it on a case-by-case basis.

76
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:43,420
There is no more quarantine for this, I don't think.

77
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:48,060
And for all those people out there who just love Trump, keep in mind that he's still Trump

78
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:52,740
and he still makes all the same mistakes, gaffes, and blunders that he usually makes.

79
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:57,740
Trump defends China's alleged cover-up because you don't want the world to go crazy.

80
00:04:57,740 --> 00:05:02,060
And he also claimed, without evidence, that the disease will go away by April.

81
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:04,800
Yeah, Trump.

82
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,820
You know, I can say with a straight face that this is one of those times where I actually

83
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:09,060
disagree with Trump.

84
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:12,220
I think this is probably not the right take to have here, dude.

85
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:15,220
I think they want to put their best face on it, so you know what I mean, if somebody,

86
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:18,340
if you're running it, you probably wouldn't want to run it into the world and go crazy

87
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:21,460
and start saying whatever it is because you don't want to create a panic.

88
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:24,660
Yeah, but I mean, we've seen the alternative, though, Trump.

89
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:27,340
We've seen what China's been doing and it's not better.

90
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:28,340
It's certainly worse.

91
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:32,460
And yeah, he says the virus will likely go away by April and that Beijing has handled

92
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:34,260
the epidemic very professionally.

93
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:38,300
Yeah, this is one time where I have to say no, Trump.

94
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:39,300
No.

95
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:40,940
Hey, you guys want to see how retarded Vox is?

96
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:41,940
I do.

97
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:45,460
The coronavirus exposes the history of racism and cleanliness.

98
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:49,260
While the epidemic may be new, xenophobia has been intertwined with public health discourse

99
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:50,260
for a very long time.

100
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:51,940
Yeah, see, I understand what they're going for.

101
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:56,220
They're going to talk about, like, what was it called?

102
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:57,220
Mad cow disease.

103
00:05:57,220 --> 00:05:58,220
Right.

104
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:02,740
Where recently, within the past 20 or 30 years, we had mad cow disease because farmers were

105
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:05,340
feeding cow parts to other cows.

106
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:08,220
And basically the point of this article is to, I'm not going to go over it because it's

107
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:13,300
literally just Vox stupidity, but the point of this article is to talk about how dirty

108
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:18,420
Western culture has also been in its past and therefore we shouldn't be calling Chinese

109
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:21,940
culture dirty because that's racism and it's xenophobia.

110
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:26,620
And it's like, well, you know, it was Western culture that developed germ theory and most

111
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:28,100
medical advances.

112
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:30,540
The dirtiness of our past that was in the past.

113
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:33,700
Meanwhile, traditional Chinese culture is quite dirty right now.

114
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:36,580
It's not consistent to compare our past with somebody else's present.

115
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:41,360
In any case, this was Vox's take on February 7th, February 14th, one week later, why the

116
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:44,140
coronavirus outbreak might be much bigger than we know.

117
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:49,260
Oh, Vox, are you suddenly bigoted now?

118
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:53,140
Are you suddenly being xenophobic and sinophobic against those Chinese people?

119
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:55,740
Here's probably the most important bit of news though.

120
00:06:55,740 --> 00:07:00,060
South China university of technology biologist has exposed that the coronavirus might have

121
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:05,300
originated from an animal research lab 280 meters away from the epicenter of the outbreak.

122
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:09,340
The scientists were reportedly bitten by bats used for a test.

123
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:12,140
The possible origins of the coronavirus.

124
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:15,660
Two descriptions of the virus published on nature this week indicated that the genome

125
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:22,900
sequences from patients were 96% or 89% identical to the bat coronavirus originally found in

126
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:23,900
the lab.

127
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:27,920
It was critical to study where the pathogen came from and how it passed on to humans.

128
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:31,260
The market was suspected to be the origin of the epidemic and was shut down according

129
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:33,060
to the rule of quarantine.

130
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:37,480
The bats carrying the virus were originally found in Yunnan or Zhejiang province, both

131
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:41,580
of which were more than 900 kilometers away from the seafood market.

132
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:45,400
Bats are normally found to live in caves and trees, but the seafood market is a densely

133
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:47,320
populated district of Wuhan.

134
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:50,280
The probability was very low that bats could fly to the market.

135
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:54,120
According to municipal reports and the testimonies of 31 residents and 28 visitors, the bat was

136
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:57,760
never a food source in the city and no bat was traded in the market.

137
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:02,400
In summary, somebody was entangled with the evolution of the coronavirus.

138
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:06,760
In addition to the origins of natural recombination intermediate host, the killer coronavirus

139
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:09,400
probably originated from a laboratory in Wuhan.

140
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:13,400
Safety levels may need to be reinforced in high risk biohazardous laboratories.

141
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:14,880
NO SHIT DUDE.

142
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:19,880
In one of the studies, 155 bats were captured in Hubei province and another 450 bats were

143
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:21,540
captured in Zhejiang province.

144
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:25,740
The expert in collection was broadcasted for collecting viruses on nationwide newspapers

145
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:28,020
and websites in 2017 and 2019.

146
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:32,720
He described that he was once attacked by bats and the blood of a bat shot on his skin.

147
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:36,200
He knew the extreme danger of infection so he quarantined himself for 14 days.

148
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:40,000
In another incident, he quarantined himself again because bats peed on him.

149
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,880
He was once thrilled for capturing a bat carrying a live tick.

150
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:47,280
And of course, here's the map, there's the Wuhan Center for Disease Control and Prevention,

151
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:49,220
and there's the Hunanan Seafood Market.

152
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:53,120
They are 277 meters or 911 feet away from each other.

153
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:56,620
I guarantee you what happened is that somebody was studying bats in there, something transmitted

154
00:08:56,620 --> 00:09:00,600
from a bat to a human while these scientists were working, then they decided to go and

155
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:01,960
have lunch at the seafood market.

156
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:03,960
I'm pretty sure that's what happened guys.

157
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:08,080
But as the months go on, we continue to discover more and more about what this virus may potentially

158
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,080
do.

159
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:12,240
This is not completely confirmed yet but these are the initial reports.

160
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:15,520
Various research published by Chinese scientists say coronavirus might render certain male

161
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:17,660
patients infertile.

162
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:21,240
So if you get it, you recover from it, you might not be having kids.

163
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:26,680
Doctor in Hubei, China warns Wuhan novel coronavirus causes sudden heart attack during second infection.

164
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:30,400
As the antibodies against the virus do not work during the second infection, the infection

165
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:33,440
can cause heart failure and further sudden death.

166
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:37,920
This might actually explain why despite the reported symptoms that we keep hearing about,

167
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:42,120
there have been those dramatic videos of people in China who just like dropped dead because

168
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:46,600
they might have had the coronavirus before and they have like maybe a little flu or something

169
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:49,920
they just stayed in bed for a few days thought it was fine and they catch it again and they

170
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,020
fucking die.

171
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:55,600
And despite this being, you know, China, Chinese scientists are finally speaking out in mass

172
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:59,920
saying that it probably came from the government bioweapons research facility in Wuhan and

173
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:03,800
that it's probably a lot more dangerous than everyone has been saying so far.

174
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:06,280
Meanwhile scientists are disappearing.

175
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:11,360
There was a renowned law professor who spoke out against the president, Xi Jinping.

176
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,360
He disappeared.

177
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:13,900
Journalists are disappearing.

178
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:15,880
China is just trying to make this go away.

179
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:17,900
So where does that leave us?

180
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:20,080
Is this truly the end of days or something?

181
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,580
No, I still don't think so.

182
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:25,940
These are initial reports, not necessarily confirmed by multiple sources yet.

183
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:29,020
And even if they are confirmed, that makes this a very deadly virus that we have to watch

184
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:30,020
out for.

185
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:31,840
But I don't think it means the end of human civilization.

186
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:35,080
It might mean the end of China, but certainly not the rest of us.

187
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:39,560
But as shipping from China starts to close down and travel is being blocked by more and

188
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:43,960
more nations, even the Russians have decided to block travel to China today, in fact.

189
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:47,260
I'll leave you with the same advice that I've left you in the previous videos.

190
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:48,260
Don't panic.

191
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:51,140
Stock up on some food just in case there's local shortages.

192
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:55,280
Keep some dried beans and dried rice, maybe some canned food hanging around your house.

193
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:59,040
Enough to last for a few weeks in case there's a local shortage because that is what's likely

194
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:01,260
to hurt you at this point, not the virus.

195
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:05,680
Let's say you live in a medium sized city and there's one case of coronavirus in your

196
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,680
city and the guy goes to the hospital.

197
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:08,960
He's quarantined.

198
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:12,060
He's treated properly and there is no outbreak.

199
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:13,780
During that time, people will be panicking.

200
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:15,220
There will be riots at grocery stores.

201
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:16,220
The shelves might be empty.

202
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:18,200
There might be no shipping for a couple of weeks even.

203
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:22,840
Your best bet is to have some food in storage so that you could basically ride it out if

204
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:23,840
you had to.

205
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:28,060
I've got like a 10 pound sack of rice and then maybe five pounds of red kidney beans

206
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:29,060
or so.

207
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:32,280
That stuff will just stay on the shelf and it's good for the next couple of years, that

208
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:33,280
kind of stuff.

209
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:35,240
So even if there is no problem, we just have some food saved up.

210
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:36,240
It's not a big deal.

211
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:39,360
The sub-ree starts getting hit with the coronavirus and suddenly all the grocery stores have no

212
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,160
food in them because everyone's grabbing stuff.

213
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:42,760
You don't want to be out there in that mob.

214
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:47,280
So yeah, keep your cool, don't lose your head over it, stock up on some basic supplies

215
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:50,080
and you know, we're all probably going to make it.

216
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:51,080
Don't worry about it.

217
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:52,080
I love you.

218
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:52,100
Good luck.
