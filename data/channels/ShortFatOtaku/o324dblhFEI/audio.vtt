Hey guys, Dev here and I'm currently filming a giant pile of junk.

00:04.160 --> 00:07.840
Recently we've been going online and making a whole bunch of purchases for show equipment.

00:07.840 --> 00:13.040
We've been reinvesting a lot of money that we've gotten out of this and there will be more in-depth

00:13.040 --> 00:17.360
videos regarding some of the stuff we've gotten. Like we're building a new computer and we're

00:17.360 --> 00:22.480
going to show a vlog about that. We got a very nice microphone which I'll just grab right here

00:22.480 --> 00:26.240
and we're going to make an in-depth video about this thing in the near future. But for the time

00:26.240 --> 00:31.040
being we're just basically waiting for some other parts to come in. There's some more junk over

00:31.040 --> 00:35.680
there. And when some of these projects are completed we'll actually have videos on them

00:35.680 --> 00:42.400
for you. Second thing of note is that it's Christmas time! Yeah! Our channel's Christmas

00:42.400 --> 00:49.280
videos will start coming out around I think December 15th, I think, and they'll go until

00:49.280 --> 00:55.360
December 26th. The reason for the 26th, for you Americans who don't know this, in Canada the 26th

00:55.360 --> 01:02.240
is Boxing Day which is a holiday after Christmas. The first video series we're going to put out is

01:02.240 --> 01:08.800
Snowboard Kids on the N64 which is going to be a lot of fun. Additionally we have some videos that

01:08.800 --> 01:14.080
were actually recorded for last year's Christmas that just didn't get out. So we're going to put

01:14.080 --> 01:20.800
them out this year. It actually made our workload a little bit easier just because, well, we didn't

01:20.800 --> 01:25.200
have to film as much this year. I guess another thing of note is that I've actually been streaming

01:26.080 --> 01:34.960
Otaku to Twitch channel over at twitch.tv. I did my first stream about a week ago or so. It was

01:34.960 --> 01:39.120
Hearthstone and it was actually quite fun. I think I'll be doing more of these in the future.

01:39.920 --> 01:44.800
When the holiday season's over and when January begins I'd like to actually start getting a

01:46.000 --> 01:51.040
regular streaming schedule up because it's just really enjoyable. And actually we do have a number

01:51.040 --> 01:56.880
of new projects coming out in January. Yes, I know we've said this for like a year but we're

01:56.880 --> 02:02.000
actually getting back to proper anime reviews and other types of videos. That's all coming

02:02.000 --> 02:07.680
after Christmas. We have a very large break, all three of us, and we're going to use that to just

02:07.680 --> 02:11.200
basically get a whole bunch of shit done and ready to go. So stay tuned to all this.

02:12.080 --> 02:17.920
If you want to come say hi to me in relative person compared to this video go over to Twitch.tv

02:17.920 --> 02:21.840
next time I stream. It might be in the next couple days actually and I'll see you there.
