0	4160	Hey guys, Dev here and I'm currently filming a giant pile of junk.
4160	7840	Recently we've been going online and making a whole bunch of purchases for show equipment.
7840	13040	We've been reinvesting a lot of money that we've gotten out of this and there will be more in-depth
13040	17360	videos regarding some of the stuff we've gotten. Like we're building a new computer and we're
17360	22480	going to show a vlog about that. We got a very nice microphone which I'll just grab right here
22480	26240	and we're going to make an in-depth video about this thing in the near future. But for the time
26240	31040	being we're just basically waiting for some other parts to come in. There's some more junk over
31040	35680	there. And when some of these projects are completed we'll actually have videos on them
35680	42400	for you. Second thing of note is that it's Christmas time! Yeah! Our channel's Christmas
42400	49280	videos will start coming out around I think December 15th, I think, and they'll go until
49280	55360	December 26th. The reason for the 26th, for you Americans who don't know this, in Canada the 26th
55360	62240	is Boxing Day which is a holiday after Christmas. The first video series we're going to put out is
62240	68800	Snowboard Kids on the N64 which is going to be a lot of fun. Additionally we have some videos that
68800	74080	were actually recorded for last year's Christmas that just didn't get out. So we're going to put
74080	80800	them out this year. It actually made our workload a little bit easier just because, well, we didn't
80800	85200	have to film as much this year. I guess another thing of note is that I've actually been streaming
86080	94960	Otaku to Twitch channel over at twitch.tv. I did my first stream about a week ago or so. It was
94960	99120	Hearthstone and it was actually quite fun. I think I'll be doing more of these in the future.
99920	104800	When the holiday season's over and when January begins I'd like to actually start getting a
106000	111040	regular streaming schedule up because it's just really enjoyable. And actually we do have a number
111040	116880	of new projects coming out in January. Yes, I know we've said this for like a year but we're
116880	122000	actually getting back to proper anime reviews and other types of videos. That's all coming
122000	127680	after Christmas. We have a very large break, all three of us, and we're going to use that to just
127680	131200	basically get a whole bunch of shit done and ready to go. So stay tuned to all this.
132080	137920	If you want to come say hi to me in relative person compared to this video go over to Twitch.tv
137920	141840	next time I stream. It might be in the next couple days actually and I'll see you there.
