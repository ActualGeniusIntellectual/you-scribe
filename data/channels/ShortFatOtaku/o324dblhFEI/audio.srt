Hey guys, Dev here and I'm currently filming a giant pile of junk.

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:07,840
Recently we've been going online and making a whole bunch of purchases for show equipment.

3
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:13,040
We've been reinvesting a lot of money that we've gotten out of this and there will be more in-depth

4
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:17,360
videos regarding some of the stuff we've gotten. Like we're building a new computer and we're

5
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:22,480
going to show a vlog about that. We got a very nice microphone which I'll just grab right here

6
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:26,240
and we're going to make an in-depth video about this thing in the near future. But for the time

7
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:31,040
being we're just basically waiting for some other parts to come in. There's some more junk over

8
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:35,680
there. And when some of these projects are completed we'll actually have videos on them

9
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:42,400
for you. Second thing of note is that it's Christmas time! Yeah! Our channel's Christmas

10
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:49,280
videos will start coming out around I think December 15th, I think, and they'll go until

11
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:55,360
December 26th. The reason for the 26th, for you Americans who don't know this, in Canada the 26th

12
00:00:55,360 --> 00:01:02,240
is Boxing Day which is a holiday after Christmas. The first video series we're going to put out is

13
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:08,800
Snowboard Kids on the N64 which is going to be a lot of fun. Additionally we have some videos that

14
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:14,080
were actually recorded for last year's Christmas that just didn't get out. So we're going to put

15
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:20,800
them out this year. It actually made our workload a little bit easier just because, well, we didn't

16
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:25,200
have to film as much this year. I guess another thing of note is that I've actually been streaming

17
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:34,960
Otaku to Twitch channel over at twitch.tv. I did my first stream about a week ago or so. It was

18
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:39,120
Hearthstone and it was actually quite fun. I think I'll be doing more of these in the future.

19
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:44,800
When the holiday season's over and when January begins I'd like to actually start getting a

20
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,040
regular streaming schedule up because it's just really enjoyable. And actually we do have a number

21
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:56,880
of new projects coming out in January. Yes, I know we've said this for like a year but we're

22
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:02,000
actually getting back to proper anime reviews and other types of videos. That's all coming

23
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:07,680
after Christmas. We have a very large break, all three of us, and we're going to use that to just

24
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:11,200
basically get a whole bunch of shit done and ready to go. So stay tuned to all this.

25
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:17,920
If you want to come say hi to me in relative person compared to this video go over to Twitch.tv

26
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:21,840
next time I stream. It might be in the next couple days actually and I'll see you there.
