0	7000	Hello my friends, welcome to SJ Weekly. I'm sick again. Fucking somehow. Thankfully this time I'm on the tail end of it.
7000	17000	If you happened to watch the stream last Tuesday, where Dave and I played Lisa the Painful with a patron supporter.
17000	22000	We cut the stream off a little bit early because I started to have a scratchy throat.
22000	27000	It turned out that I had strep throat. And I still kinda have it.
27000	31000	And then Dave got it, and then his girlfriend got it, and then my girlfriend got it.
31000	35000	So it has been a shitty fucking week I must tell you.
35000	44000	Today I am drinking green tea with lemon juice and honey in it. Because it's the only thing I can stomach right now.
49000	53000	It's pretty good. I'm thankfully on the end, the tail end of this sickness.
53000	60000	So with any luck I'll be over it in a day or two. But Jesus Christ I seem to get sick like once a month. It fucking sucks.
60000	67000	But let's start SJ Weekly by looking at, not an article this time, but these are pictures that somebody sent me.
67000	76000	It's from Pride Montreal, and they're doing a pride march. Or rather they did a pride march on the 19th of August.
76000	82000	And he had signed up to attend it, and this is some of the correspondence they sent him.
82000	87000	So this is all normal stuff right, like where the march is taking place.
87000	96000	But then under dress code it says we invite you to wear your company slash groups logo as long as it has been approved by Pride Montreal. See the list below.
96000	100000	And that's a bit strange, so if we go to the next picture.
101000	117000	The approved logos for our group are EA Motive, Ubisoft, Eidos, Square Enix, WB, Keywords, Unity, Kitfox Games, Serapod Studio, Clever Endeavor Games, Casa Rera Studio, Mescalanium Studio, Pixels and Dawson College.
117000	125000	Most of these are video game developers. Some of them are indie, some of them are big names like EA and Ubisoft and Square Enix.
126000	134000	But it seems like this pride march was mostly sponsored by video game developers that have studios in Montreal.
134000	141000	And here's the interesting part. Please note that any unapproved logo might lead to an important extra fee.
141000	149000	So they're actually going to charge you if you attend this public gathering wearing a logo that is not from that list.
149000	161000	So if you wear like, I don't know, a beer shirt, or you wear like a shirt with like a different company on it like Nintendo or something, or you wear like a Nike shirt, they're gonna charge you.
161000	173000	It's almost like the pride march is less about pride and more about advertising.
173000	187000	It's almost like this is an advertisement march. And in fact, they mentioned this several times like in the rules list, like okay, you can't use water guns, you can't throw confetti, you can use soap bubbles, you can't use alcohol or drugs, you can't hand things out to the public.
188000	203000	Only logos of authorized companies can be worn and displayed in the parade. Why? If it were just a regular pride parade sponsored by certain companies, you think they might have like a little float, or somebody might hold a banner or something.
203000	214000	But why are you prohibiting other companies? This doesn't seem right. It doesn't seem like a regular pride parade. It's almost like they bought exclusivity of the pride parade.
214000	226000	It's almost like it's more about promoting these companies and less about pride. And it just, it's almost like capitalism has co-opted their social justice structure here and it's kind of funny.
226000	231000	But let's move on to the New York Times article, how can I cure my white guilt?
232000	244000	This has been floating around Twitter the past week and I must say, I found it absolutely hilarious. I mean, I don't have any white guilt because I haven't done anything.
244000	256000	You know, like, I don't even think anybody in my family history has actually done anything. I'm sure if you go back far enough, everyone has somebody who acted ridiculously, but my family never owned slaves.
256000	268000	My family didn't do any of the things that you should have white guilt for. And even then it doesn't matter because that should be like my ancestors problem, not mine.
269000	282000	Dear sugars, I'm riddled with shame, white shame. This isn't helpful to me or to anyone, especially people of color. I feel like there is no me outside of my white upper middle class cisgender identity.
282000	296000	I feel like my literal existence hurts people, like I'm always taking up space that should belong to someone else. I consider myself an ally. I research proper etiquette, read writers of color, vote in a way that will not harm POCs and other vulnerable people.
296000	306000	I engage in conversations about privilege with other white people. I take courses that will further educate me. I donate to Black Lives Matter, yet I fear that nothing is enough.
306000	315000	Part of my fear comes from the fact that privilege is invisible to itself. What if I'm doing or saying insensitive things without realizing it?
315000	327000	Well, everything you've described here comes from two sources. One is that from the point of view of black people, you can never do enough. You will always need to do more.
327000	337000	That's why whenever you see like a list of things of how to not be racist as a white person, the final point on the list is always recognize that you're racist anyway.
337000	344000	If you've been indoctrinated with this point of view, that means that no matter what you do, you are always going to feel inadequate.
344000	353000	And the second source of this would probably come from the black social justice warriors around you who are reinforcing what you already have internally learned.
353000	359000	Basically, you've decided to wear the mantle of the sins of your entire race.
359000	365000	Unjustly, by the way, you don't have to do this, but you've chosen to do it and now you're feeling the consequences.
365000	369000	Another part of it is that I'm currently immersed in the whitest environment I've ever been in.
369000	381000	My family has lived in the same apartment in East Harlem for four generations. Every school I attended elementary through high school was minority white, but now I'm attending an elite private college that is 75% white.
381000	386000	I know who I am, but I realize how people perceive me and this perception feels unfair.
386000	395000	I don't talk about my feelings because it's hard to justify doing so while people of color are dying due to systemic racism and making this conversation about me would be again centering whiteness.
395000	401000	Yet bottling it up makes me feel an existential anger that I have a hard time channeling since I don't know my place.
401000	407000	Instead of harnessing my privilege for greater good, I'm curled up in a ball of shame. How can I be more than my heritage?
407000	419000	This honestly seems like a form of survivor's guilt, almost.
419000	430000	If her family has lived in that same apartment in East Harlem for four generations and she's finally pulled herself out of the muck, she's also probably spending some time looking back at all those people she left behind.
430000	439000	There might be a situation of how come I deserve to make it out and they're still back there? I think there's definitely a survivor's guilt component to this.
439000	442000	Here's Steve Allman's reply.
442000	450000	Shame and anger are powerful emotions, Whitey, and yet your central struggle is around identity. You write that you don't know your place.
450000	455000	In fact, your letter describes your place as a kind of a prison cell of privilege.
455000	460000	What you really feel is trapped within an identity that marks you inescapably as an oppressor.
460000	468000	Yes, this is true so far. Steve seems to understand this, that she's put herself in this box of oppressor and there's no way for her to get out of it.
468000	475000	This feeling is especially acute right now, I suspect, because you're suddenly immersed in a milieu that reflects your privilege back to you.
475000	485000	We do live in a culture steeped in white supremacy and class bigotry—okay, he's off the rails now—as well as patriarchal values, but the solution to this injustice isn't to wallow in self-hatred.
486000	489000	Instead, heed the words of the writer bell hooks.
489000	494000	Privilege is not in and of itself bad, what matters is what we do with privilege.
494000	500000	We have to share our resources and take direction about how to use our privilege in ways that empower those who lack it.
500000	504000	You're not going to empower others by disempowering yourself.
504000	510000	See, you can actually come to this conclusion without claiming that we live in a white supremacy or a patriarchy or whatever.
510000	520000	You can just quite literally say, you know, people who have more should, at the very least, try to help people who have less.
520000	530000	And it shouldn't be a legal precept, we shouldn't have like a communist society where people who have more are forced to do so.
530000	535000	But it should be a moral precept, you know, I think it should be voluntary, but I think people should generally do it.
535000	541000	That's why we always look to rich individuals to perform philanthropy.
541000	548000	And why we think it's generally a good thing, better than the government taking the money and trying to do it themselves.
548000	551000	Here's the second writer, Cheryl Strayed.
551000	560000	I think Steve's onto something when he notes that your anxiety is acute now because the racial mix at your college is reflecting your privilege back to you, but I'll go even further.
560000	563000	My hunch is that you're truly seeing it for the first time.
563000	567000	You grew up in a neighborhood and attended schools where you were one of the relatively few whites.
567000	574000	It's possible your status as a situational racial minority gave you the illusion that you didn't have much in the way of racial privilege.
574000	590000	Now that you're living in a community that at 75% white roughly mirrors that of the American population, you're feeling the full force of what it means to be white in a white supremacist culture and it makes you feel uncomfortable because up till now, in some unconscious way, you'd exonerated yourself from it.
590000	594000	You were the good white person because you grew up among people of color.
594000	598000	Now you're another white face in the crowd at your elite college and ashamed of it.
598000	614000	Oh god, okay, shut up. I mean, these replies, they like, start with like a nugget of truth, like a seed of goodness, and then it just grows into this fucking monstrosity.
614000	619000	Really, I think the only solution for this person is a complete change of framework.
619000	632000	If they continuously buy into a mode of looking at the world that makes them feel guilty, no amount of extra work is going to help that.
632000	635000	You have to basically give up social justice.
635000	647000	I've mentioned a few times before, I've always had an idea for like a social justice self-help video because social justice at its core is completely against the idea of self-help.
647000	654000	You know, they expect society to change to help them. They expect the government to step in and help them.
654000	660000	And they believe that it's oppressive to help yourself, but really, that's the way out.
660000	666000	If you're in a shit situation, you have to help yourself. You have to do some hard work yourself.
666000	683000	And this person is guilty because they've absorbed, or rather, this person feels guilty because they've absorbed this mindset that places them in a position where no matter what they do, they're always going to be considered oppressive.
683000	689000	And so they're going to feel guilty about it. And the only solution, none of the stuff that they talk about is a solution.
689000	693000	The only solution is to give up that mindset because it's not true. It's not reflective of reality.
693000	697000	You have to start doing some hard work on your own and figuring it out.
697000	707000	And just because you do hard work and some other people don't do hard work, when you gain the benefits of your hard work, that's not oppressive. That's how it should be.
707000	716000	But that wasn't the most ridiculous race-based article in this video. We have, Is Cold Weather Racist by Damon Young?
716000	722000	I can't fucking believe this, but this is a real article. It's on the root.
722000	732000	This morning, after walking my dog, I went back outside, popped open the trunk of my car, and removed some workout items that were still in there for my trip to LA Fitness Wednesday evening.
732000	738000	A sleeveless hoodie, a white t-shirt, a pair of white socks, and some grey shorts.
738000	746000	I usually don't like to leave sweaty clothes in my trunk that long, but I had forgotten they were still in there and was reminded when trying to remember this morning where that hoodie was.
746000	755000	I wasn't, however, prepared for the clothes to have changed form. You see, it was 2 degrees in Pittsburgh yesterday morning and managed to climb up to 12 degrees today.
755000	763000	It was so cold that my clothes were frozen. The hoodie, which had balled up in a gym bag, was now basically a head of lettuce.
763000	768000	The white t-shirt was a fucking ironing board. My socks were flaccid popsicles.
768000	779000	As I hurried back into the house, clutching my frozen clothing and cursing at the cold nipping at my nipples, one thought came to mind. This is some racist ass shit.
779000	790000	This person seems to live quite a privileged life. They have a house, a car, they have a dog to walk. They live in a suburb, it sounds like. They have a gym membership at LA Fitness.
790000	799000	I don't know if they're really suffering underneath the white patriarchy so much.
799000	805000	And they think that the cold is racist. Yes, you read that correctly.
805000	815000	Cold weather racially profiles, segregates, gentrifies, colonizes, appropriates, and is responsible for at least 90% of the unseasoned meats brought to company potlucks this month.
815000	821000	It also possesses a changing agent that somehow makes black people even blacker.
821000	831000	My first time reading this, I thought that this paragraph was kind of the mark in which you should see this article and think, okay, this is obviously satire.
831000	837000	But it's not satire. This is not actually satire. This person actually believes this, and I'll show you how later.
837000	846000	The mere hint of a chill seeping and sneaking into my bones transforms me into an awkward melange of every blaxploitation protagonist and Richard Pryor.
846000	865000	I've called the wind a jive turkey, a splash of slush in my boots a goddamn good for nothing cracka, a lone snowflake somehow breaking from formation and finding its way past my parka, beneath my hoodie and down my neck, a sucka ass nigga.
865000	874000	How exactly is cold weather racist, you ask? Where's my proof? Well, first, fuck you for asking me to provide proof of racism.
874000	882000	But since we're here, the proof is that cold weather hates black people, even though black people have been so nice and kind to cold weather that we don't bother it where it lives.
882000	892000	If you saw a map of the planet and you wanted to immediately know where on earth to find the niggas, all you have to do is check each region's average temperature and boom.
892000	896000	Your nigga finding expedition is over.
896000	908000	I wish this was a fucking fake article. I wish this was something on like The Onion or The Beaverton or something, but this is real. This is real.
908000	916000	Aside from your boogie ass Kappa cousins taking ski trips and sleigh riding on ascots, we collectively let cold weather rock.
916000	920000	If cold weather is walking down our side of the street, we cross the street.
920000	925000	We're even nice enough to stay in the house for months while cold weather is out getting its groove on it.
925000	929000	Despite all these concessions that we've made, cold weather still hates us.
929000	935000	And the word for that type of undeserved hate of black people is racism. So, yes, cold weather is racist.
935000	941000	So this was a ridiculous article, right?
941000	945000	But this guy, he wrote a book called What Doesn't Kill You Makes You Blacker.
945000	948000	And it's a lot of this stuff in that book.
948000	957000	However, if you go to his actual posts, he does this routinely.
957000	961000	Why you just can't trust a man with a weak dap explained.
961000	968000	Ten probably not all that interesting reasons why I got the title of my book tattooed on my arm.
968000	974000	Why do black Republicans usually have such bad haircuts and important expose?
974000	979000	Yeah, telling black women to carry pepper spray to fight street harassment is missing the point.
979000	981000	He does it all kind of tongue in cheek.
981000	988000	But underneath that that surface layer of comedy, there's a lot of seriousness in his articles.
988000	993000	And I think Damon Young is legitimately just like a Tariq Nasheed clone.
993000	997000	But it's not just black identitarians that have gone insane this week.
997000	1003000	No, we have white supremacist rally leader gets yelled at by his dad during a live stream.
1003000	1011000	Jason Kessler was interrupted while filming a live stream on Tuesday by his father who scolded his son for recording in his bedroom.
1011000	1018000	Kessler was filming an interview with Patrick Little, a neo-Nazi who ran an unsuccessful campaign for Senate in California.
1018000	1023000	Hey, you get out of my room. Kessler's father was heard to shout during the live stream clip of which was shared on Vox.
1023000	1028000	I want this to stop in my room, Jason. This is my room, Kessler's father says.
1028000	1038000	So this neo-Nazi apparently, and I'll play the clip in a minute, but apparently this neo-Nazi, he still lives with his parents.
1038000	1044000	And he wanted to record out of his parents' room to make his place look nicer, I guess, for the video.
1044000	1047000	Here, let's watch this video, okay?
1048000	1050000	Oh.
1050000	1053000	Big Orthodox cross is on their chest, as Dr. Duke likes to point out.
1053000	1056000	It's Jewish, the breaking houses are in Israel.
1056000	1059000	Hey, you get out of my room!
1059000	1061000	Hey, sorry, I'm having an initiative here.
1061000	1064000	Oh, you got a drunk roommate there?
1064000	1066000	Something like that.
1066000	1068000	What's going on in my room?
1069000	1077000	I've got somebody who supports Orthodox Israeli.
1077000	1082000	We're at a crosshairs on that stuff, I don't agree with that.
1082000	1084000	Look at his face.
1086000	1088000	He's so fucking embarrassed.
1088000	1092000	Clean your room. I'm going to assume that's a parent there, I'm not sure.
1093000	1099000	Uh, Jason, why are you not staying with an Orthodox Jew, are you?
1099000	1106000	No, it's my father. Basically, the deal is, my family watches American History Channel,
1106000	1110000	and it's constant anti-German propaganda.
1110000	1115000	The Nazis, the Jews, like, and the dude.
1115000	1121000	I'm stuck in a situation where I have to stay with my family because I'm paying for all these laws.
1121000	1126000	I'm paying for all these lawsuits, and I can't afford to do that without staying with my family.
1126000	1128000	But they're cuffed.
1128000	1131000	Life has been pretty expensive the last few months.
1131000	1137000	Okay, so that's the alt-right for you.
1137000	1142000	I guess this is, are these the kind of people that make up the alt-right? I'm not sure.
1142000	1146000	I haven't, doesn't Millennial Woes live in his parents' basement as well?
1146000	1155000	I haven't really met an alt-writer that is wildly successful, so I don't know.
1156000	1160000	The last thing to bring up is the voting from two weeks ago.
1160000	1169000	So, on the SJ Weekly from two weeks back, I said I was going to make one of six videos, right?
1169000	1177000	And they were journalists are not a protected class, forced civility, islamophobia origin, Boogie, Anthony Burch,
1177000	1182000	and there's one more down here that didn't really get that many votes.
1182000	1185000	Cultural appropriation, I only got 35 votes.
1185000	1191000	Somebody voted all of them, which got a lot of votes too, for not being a selection.
1191000	1196000	Dynasty Star won a new Gamergate video, and I think I have one coming.
1196000	1200000	It's going to be about a get woke go broke. That'll eventually happen.
1200000	1205000	But of the six for the next video, the one that got the most votes was on Boogie.
1205000	1212000	And I've been looking into it. I don't think there's enough for a full video yet.
1212000	1216000	There's a lot of stuff, but I might wait until more happens.
1216000	1219000	I know you guys voted, and I'm not turning my back on the vote.
1219000	1223000	It's just that if I did the video right now, I think you guys would be very disappointed.
1224000	1232000	The next highest one was journalists are not a protected class, and I can start working on that one.
1232000	1239000	I'm sure I will eventually do a Boogie video, it's just that there's not enough right now.
1239000	1245000	I have enough for like maybe a ten minute video, but I want it to be a decent length.
1245000	1248000	And it wouldn't even cover the full story.
1248000	1253000	So let's wait for some developments to continue happening, to continue coming in.
1253000	1257000	And I'll work on journalists are not a protected class.
1257000	1260000	Of course, I'll eventually do all six of these.
1260000	1266000	But I just wanted to try out this voting thing, just to see what you guys wanted, where your interests lied.
1266000	1269000	And thank you very much for participating.
1269000	1280000	And I almost forgot to mention, tonight, probably between 7 and 8 p.m. EST, we're having the August community stream on this channel.
1280000	1285000	So drop by, we're going to show off some packages that were sent to us over the month.
1285000	1290000	Show off some fan art that was done of us over the course of the last month.
1290000	1298000	And we're going to watch a shitty movie together with Twitch subs and Patreon supporters in a voice call with us.
1298000	1302000	Having a good time and riffing on this shitty movie.
1302000	1307000	We do one of these every month and this month is tonight, if you're watching this video the day it came out.
1307000	1311000	So drop by tonight and say hi, I hope to see you. I love you.
