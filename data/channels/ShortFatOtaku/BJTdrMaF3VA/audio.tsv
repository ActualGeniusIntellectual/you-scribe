0	8760	I received an Amazon package today, as you sometimes do, and I noticed that the packing
8760	15800	tape was Lord of the Rings, Rings of Power packing tape wrapped around the box.
15800	17800	That's not a good sign, Des.
17800	20140	And I'm just like, oh Jesus, so hold on.
20140	22280	Every package Amazon's sending out.
22280	25740	Because Naomi and I went for a walk today and we saw like packages and like other porches
25740	26740	and stuff.
26740	29540	And I'm not a porch pirate, but I kind of went up because like during the day everyone's
29540	32100	out to work and I'm a lazy YouTuber sitting at home.
32100	34020	So you know, the suburbs are emptied of people.
34020	37940	So I walk up onto this porch of somebody else's house and I just look and it's like here's
37940	41500	Amazon package and it has Rings of Power tape and then here's another one with Rings of
41500	42500	Power tape.
42500	43500	And I'm just like...
43500	48540	Imagine being an OHE making $15.50 and just like your upper up just comes up, okay, now
48540	54820	you gotta use this packing tape and just endless Lord of the Rings, Lord of the Rings, Lord
54820	55820	of the Rings.
55820	60020	I can't think of any other Prime Video show that's done this, where they've just converted
60020	62340	all the Amazon boxes to advertise for it.
62340	66300	I think they did one time before, but I can't remember what it was for.
66300	70780	I remember seeing some advertisement stickers for something on the like the little duct
70780	71780	tape they use.
71780	72780	Normally they advertise...
72780	75300	This is also, this is their big thing.
75300	76860	This is the big thing.
76860	81200	If this fails, they've basically said that Amazon Studios fails, which is why they've
81200	84620	also basically said that they'll do anything to make it succeed.
84620	88100	I don't know if you saw, but there's been two claims I've seen.
88100	94480	One suggested that it had like 1.8 million actual views, but not tracking all devices.
94480	98700	And then Amazon claims that they got 28 million views.
98700	102900	That's one hell of a discrepancy and if you look at the reviews themselves, last time
102900	105820	I checked, I think there was like 10, 12, 13,000?
105820	108220	Hold on, Kibbs, you have it up.
108220	109780	What does it say on yours?
109780	112420	It was like 3.3 or something like that.
112420	113420	Here, hold on.
114420	118620	The Amazon rating is currently at 3.3 out of 5.
118620	119620	Yeah.
119620	121900	And that's out of 13,000 global ratings.
121900	128960	So 25 million views, 13,000 people bothered to give it a rating.
128960	129960	I don't know.
129960	134600	There should probably be more reviews than that, but it kind of feels like, this is just
134600	138700	me being a conspiracy brain here, but it kind of feels like they're only letting through
138700	145660	enough reviews, like approving certain reviews, just to keep the number like above three.
145660	146660	Probably.
146660	152980	I will say on IMDb, the reverse review bombing campaign has, well, it has been gaining ground
152980	157580	over the negative reviews, which is why I keep saying people need to review it.
157580	163200	It's at 6.9 now and this is a genuine cultural battleground.
163200	164660	And here's the reason why we know that.
164700	171820	I don't know if you three have seen this article published by somebody named Stephen Colbert.
171820	173260	It's just a coincidence.
173260	176900	It's not Stephen Colbert, just a coincidence.
176900	183460	This article is, the rings of power viewership numbers proves audience ratings are useless.
183460	184580	I did see that one.
184580	188700	I try to avoid the screen round whenever I can, but I didn't see that title.
188700	189700	Yeah.
189700	190700	Already bracing it.
190700	191700	Yep.
191780	196260	This article, it's promoting, first of all, it's promoting She-Hulk and it's promoting
196260	201260	House of the Dragon and it's promoting the 25 million viewers watching rings of power.
201260	207260	And it's saying basically that all of the places where, where viewers can put in their
207260	213500	own reviews, Rotten Tomatoes, IMDb, Amazon itself, it's all just being review bombed
213500	215260	and the reviews don't matter.
215260	219300	Obviously from their perspective, this is the first step in trying to get rid of reviews
219300	222060	because this is an obvious signal to people.
222060	225860	That's why I keep saying we do need to review it because the norm is just look at the rating.
225860	230380	If there wasn't a rating, the only narrative around rings of power was that anyone who
230380	234420	hates it is a racist and that Amazon had 25 million viewers.
234420	238060	There's also, I've seen varying usage of language.
238060	244180	Like I've seen, for example, they say 25 million or 28 million viewers, not views, which makes
244180	250420	me think like, okay, were there just 25 million people logged into prime at that time?
250420	254300	Or maybe they're, they're like estimating like, oh, well on average, one person's watching
254300	255300	it with someone else.
255300	256300	So that's two viewers.
256300	259340	If there's one click, I guess the last thing to talk about too, before we get into the
259340	265900	video real quick is what they're using to defend what exactly what's happening, a statement
265900	271260	issued by prime video and the cast of the show just straight up said middle earth is
271260	278860	not all white and they refuse to ignore or tolerate harassment and abuse from fans directed
278860	280500	at performers of color.
280500	282180	They're correct.
282180	286580	Middle earth is not all white, but they chose to place their story in the place where there
286580	288540	are nothing but white people.
288540	295100	So they came out and said that Tolkien created a world which by definition is multicultural,
295100	301100	a world in which free peoples from different races and cultures joined together in a fellowship
301100	303140	to defeat the forces of evil.
303140	306620	Our world has never been all white, fantasy has never been all white and middle earth
306620	308820	is not all white.
308820	314860	So I'm just like, that's interesting because that's not canon because the fellowship fails.
314860	315860	That's true.
315860	316860	The fellowship does fail.
316860	320480	So, so they're multiracial, multiethnic, you know, Alliance falls apart.
320480	321480	That's true.
321480	324940	At the same time though, you know, the fact that you had Aragorn and Gimli and Legolas
324940	327660	altogether, that was kind of a unique situation in the lore.
327660	329460	So I get, I get, I get their point.
329460	330460	Fair enough.
330820	337680	That's my point for that, but the overall, you know, story and lore and setting of Lord
337680	342400	of the Rings is that, yeah, it is a multicultural world, but all of these cultures, they kind
342400	349480	of have this desire to remain separate and not be brought under, let's say one, one banner,
349480	355300	one empire, one multiethnic empire, like Sauron's for example.
355300	360580	The thing is too, the focus was never on the cultures or the race.
360580	366300	Like that is a, it is an irrelevancy because it is good versus evil, which is why the men
366300	372220	of the East are portrayed as evil because in the story, that's all they need.
372220	375580	Honestly, Lord of the Rings is kind of like a world full of ethnostates.
375580	381180	Uh, unironically, yes, and after the war ends, it kind of remains that way.
381180	387180	When they reformed the kingdom of Arnor and Gondor, when they combine, uh, King Aragorn
387180	393900	basically grants the Shire as a, a, uh, sovereign state within his new kingdom and also forbids
393900	395500	men from entering it.
395500	399220	It is actually unironically an ethnostate.
399220	404700	So wait, does that mean that we can't go down there and get any, any hubbitusi?
404700	406840	Basically, yeah.
406840	408780	And the problem is always remains also though.
408780	409780	Okay.
409780	410780	All right.
410780	411780	Sure.
411780	412780	Absolutely.
412780	413780	And it was never all one.
413780	414780	All right.
414780	415780	Fine as well.
415780	420060	Uh, why didn't you place your story there then like, why aren't you telling the tale
420060	421060	of the Haradrin?
421060	423640	Uh, some of them might've been resisting Sauron.
423640	424860	You can make this shit up.
424860	430020	You own the rights to it now or in, um, Cund or in Uruun.
430020	431860	Why isn't there any of the story placed there?
431860	432860	Oh, that's right.
432860	434220	Because nobody fucking cares.
434220	435540	That's the hard truth.
435540	440700	And making us care is as the rings of power has demonstrated well beyond the capabilities
440700	442500	of the current show it on us.
442500	443500	Okay.
443500	445780	I think it's time for us to Jesus Christ.
445780	447980	Look at the episodes are getting longer.
447980	451860	One hour, five, one hour, seven, one hour, an hour, 11 minutes.
451860	458020	Holy shit guys finale will be two hours at some point.
458020	465420	Sorry arch, you know, why don't you just let's procrastinate, arch, why don't you just sleep
465420	467300	and get up at like five or something?
467900	471500	Here's me while I lean into my microphone here just for a second.
471500	476940	Oh God, let me just take my headphones out.
476940	480940	Because that'll really fuck up my sleep schedule, Dev.
480940	484100	It was still loud even with the mom.
484100	488220	Wait, what's your normal sleep schedule?
488220	489220	Not good.
489220	490740	And this looked like it was.
490740	493660	Meanwhile, Lilith, you sleep for about 18 hours a day.
493660	494660	Oh my God.
494660	495660	That's not true.
495660	500620	I sleep 20 hours a day.
500620	506100	Lord of the Rings, the Rings of Power, episode four.
506100	507660	What's the title, Gibbs?
507660	508660	The Great Wave.
508660	509660	The Great Wave.
509660	510660	Okay.
510660	511660	That's the plan.
511660	512660	Maybe someone will drown.
512660	513660	That'd be funny.
513660	516500	Maybe it'll be me.
516500	517500	Oh God, a gun.
517500	518500	I wish I had one.
518500	519500	Marshalls.
519500	520500	Wham.
520500	523940	I tried to watch that show there, by the way.
523940	525700	She was like, oh, action show.
525700	526700	That's cool.
526700	527700	It's just porn for women.
527700	532660	And I was sitting there like, I realized that this is what this is.
532660	533660	Oh my God.
533660	535380	They're just undressed men all the time.
535380	536380	Yes.
536380	538980	How come we don't get that for men?
538980	541820	Well, that's because we're misogynists.
541820	544900	But unfortunately I showed my mother the first episode and she said, this is a very good
544900	545900	TV show.
545900	546900	I was like, mm-hmm.
546900	547900	I guess.
547900	554460	God, I hate that fucking plot twist so much, by the way.
554460	556460	Should I get your map?
556460	557460	Just a map of Mordor.
557460	558460	Where?
558460	560940	A fucking orc can figure it out, but a Galadriel's like, huh.
560940	565420	The cliche with like, uh, people don't know what's going on with the math board until
565420	567500	some random woman scribbles it.
567500	568500	Yeah.
568500	569500	It's upside down.
569500	570500	Oh, shoot.
570500	571500	Oh.
571500	573140	Whoops the board upside down.
573140	574140	All right.
574140	575540	We can skip this this time.
575540	576540	Fuck it.
576540	577540	Let's get through it.
578180	579180	Watch it.
579180	580180	Like the fucking button.
580180	581180	Are you positive?
581180	585980	Like the fucking devs needs to be tortured with the interim.
585980	588260	Oh, they don't need to skip parts of it.
588260	590380	Yeah, we still got it.
590380	591380	We had to see the big name.
591380	593180	That way it's burned into a redness.
593180	595180	Hey, look, it's Minas Tiras.
595180	597300	Wait, are they doing that?
597300	598300	Yeah.
598300	600300	Didn't you see the, the house outstretched?
600300	601300	Yeah.
601300	602300	Yeah.
602300	605020	Are they, are they saying this is like, no, it's not the same place, but like the same
605020	607020	architecture, I guess.
607020	610820	This is literally for the foreigner.
610820	611820	It's too bad.
611820	612820	There wasn't an R in that name.
612820	613820	She could have rolled it.
613820	615620	I think my nose broke from the symbolism again.
615620	618620	Oh no, the island's going to sink.
618620	619620	Yeah.
619620	623340	And in case you were wondering, this is going to be a dream sequence, isn't it?
623340	625220	It's going to be like a premonition to the future.
625220	628860	She's going to wake up and like, Oh my God, my island's collapsing.
628860	636420	This fall of Númenor, this will be a sudden escalation if it wasn't.
636820	638820	Now that tower wasn't actually touched by anything.
638820	641700	So that just, that was just, you know, shoddy building.
641700	643700	That is a massive ass bed.
643700	645020	For one person to sleep on.
645020	646020	Yeah.
646020	647020	She wasn't even sleeping on it.
647020	650180	She's on a chair and she's fully dressed.
650180	654980	I had a comment on one of my videos basically saying, wouldn't it be amazing if Númenor
654980	657540	was just filled with chads and stacies, et cetera.
657540	663380	And yes, it would like like a chance in Amazon's, I think just lots of beautiful, massive, muscular
663380	664380	people.
664380	667500	Cause these are supposed to be a superior race to humans.
667500	671500	Like it should literally be filled with just massive ass Hercules dudes.
671500	674340	They're long lived, very, you know, healthy.
674340	677260	Aren't they like humans though, but like better humans?
677260	678260	They were.
678260	679260	Yeah.
679260	680780	These people are what we would call Arians.
680780	686340	Which is a bit cruel, dear, but yes, that is theoretically correct.
686340	692620	Hey, listen, nothing wrong with loving elves.
692620	700820	The only thing they're good for.
700820	703820	You tell them, Karl Marx.
703820	710340	Oh no, I think I got a little book for you.
710340	713340	I think he's the bad guy.
713340	716860	Bad guy always says, trust me.
716860	719340	Wait, from where?
719340	723180	Oh, they're just going to bring them out from somewhere?
723180	724180	Magic.
724180	734300	Here's the thing, whenever I, at this point, whenever I see a character like this in a
734300	736820	modern show, I always wonder like, are they going to do a Trump?
736820	738820	Are they going to make him like a Trump style guy?
738820	741980	He's at a podium and like rallying up a crowd.
741980	743980	Make Númenor great again.
743980	762060	And they got away, both of them.
762060	763060	I like that.
763060	764060	Okay.
764060	774780	You're not going to comment on the fact that everyone believes Sauron died like a couple
774780	775780	hundred years ago?
775780	776780	No?
776780	777780	Okay.
777780	778780	Nope.
778780	789260	They're going to skip over the, I don't believe Sauron's back, part of the story.
789260	798020	Now you jumped off a boat and almost got eaten by a big fish.
798020	799020	Well, that didn't work out.
799020	800020	You're in jail.
800020	801020	You know what?
801020	802020	I don't mind that.
802020	804020	Like this is, this is okay.
804020	805020	Okay.
805020	806020	There's a few good things.
806020	810980	I think it's mildly funny, but at the same time, this is supposed to be Galadriel.
810980	816060	Like she isn't just an angry wench.
816060	820860	She has to show how empowered she is, Starch.
820860	822860	Are you a sexist?
822860	823860	Yes.
823860	835980	If I let go of this rope, the ASMR voice will whisper to me again.
835980	836980	Oops.
836980	837980	Yeah.
837980	841700	Haven't we seen this scene already?
841700	848740	I think he thought about it last time and he didn't do it.
848740	849740	That was deliberate.
849740	850740	Correct.
850740	851740	Beat him.
851740	852740	What?
852740	853740	All three of you.
853740	854740	What?
854740	855740	What?
855740	856740	What?
856740	857740	It's a bit cruel.
857740	858740	Bit extreme.
858740	859740	Oh, he's Batman.
859740	860740	Oh no.
860740	861740	I don't care about this guy.
861740	862740	God dammit.
862740	863740	Ah.
863740	864740	The white power auras again.
864740	865740	Was that supposed to be intimidating?
865740	866740	I thought that was funny.
866740	881260	He's like, I'm a elf orc, an orfk.
881260	882540	Some chubby ears there, my boy.
882540	885820	You should get that looked at.
885820	886820	Is it going to be force healing?
886820	889940	He's going to stab his neck.
889940	890940	Doubt it.
890940	891940	Mm-hmm.
892140	895140	Stabs deeper.
895140	903140	I remember how much the Orcs cared about their own.
903140	905140	Yeah, they ate him.
905140	916940	Remember when they got up the head and were like, Meatwag on the menu.
916940	917940	I like this guy.
917940	921940	He's a better actor than the main characters so far.
921940	923940	Oh, Jesus.
923940	925940	Oh, well, well, again.
925940	929940	Thank God, Vargapug lived.
929940	934540	See, this actually kind of makes it worse because his performance is actually pretty
934540	935540	damn good here.
935540	938940	And then you've got portion of you can do it just half interestingly.
938940	940780	Where are you?
940780	943180	Like a monster or something?
943180	946620	The watchtower is perfectly intact.
947620	949620	By the humans.
949620	956620	So, I guess when the elves disengaged and left, they were just caught on the road.
956620	961620	Yes, they just decided to leave without Black Elf.
961620	965620	Well, he wasn't worth much to them, was he?
965620	968620	Ah, five potatoes.
968620	970620	You didn't pack food?
970620	974620	Why did you not pack food?
974620	980620	You can kind of see his ears poking through the hair.
980620	982620	And they look kind of elven.
982620	984620	Yeah, that's a hidden thing.
984620	988620	I don't know how he would have been able to hide that for so long.
988620	991620	Just Justin Bieber hair for like ten years.
991620	998620	Well, they don't seem to be doing any efforts of sneaking or hiding or any subterfuge whatsoever,
998620	1000620	so why wasn't this a good idea?
1000620	1001620	They show no fear whatsoever.
1001620	1003620	They just wandered in here.
1003620	1005620	Hey, one of them's showing fear.
1005620	1006620	The other guy's careless.
1006620	1009620	He feels like he has protagonist immunity.
1009620	1013620	He's got a magic sword, so he's going to use magic bullshit to be okay.
1013620	1016620	It feels like he's sneaking to the cookie jar.
1016620	1019620	I just hate the fact that they didn't bring the food.
1019620	1020620	Like, why?
1020620	1021620	What possible reason?
1021620	1022620	They just left it there.
1022620	1024620	They were in a rush, okay?
1024620	1026620	He's going to die.
1026620	1029620	Other guy's going to run back with a cart full of food.
1029620	1031620	Rowan might be in deep shit.
1034620	1037620	The orcs aren't fucking movie monsters, Jesus Christ.
1037620	1039620	They're not stealthy.
1040620	1042620	Are there anything but subtle?
1042620	1044620	Hey, I can see his arm.
1046620	1048620	That wasn't even scary.
1049620	1051620	He was just standing there.
1051620	1054620	He was waiting for the dramatic reveal.
1060620	1062620	You recognize that, don't you?
1063620	1064620	Excuse me.
1064620	1065620	Whoa!
1065620	1069620	Hey, when did you learn to do that?
1069620	1071620	He just stabbed himself with it.
1071620	1073620	Just let it drop blood, I guess.
1073620	1075620	Yeah, that was a bad idea, wasn't it?
1075620	1079620	If that's able to activate like a lightsaber just every time you stab yourself.
1079620	1081620	It's like a bad place to hide.
1082620	1084620	This is a pretty bad place to hide.
1084620	1087620	It's like Saddam Hussein's hidey hole.
1088620	1090620	His gamer cave.
1091620	1092620	Yeah.
1093620	1095620	Oh, that was grunted.
1095620	1096620	That's rare.
1103620	1106620	Were you expecting to stab to the bottom of the well or something?
1109620	1111620	No, that's loud, by the way.
1111620	1112620	Yeah, that.
1114620	1115620	Splash!
1116620	1118620	That goes up the fucking thing.
1119620	1121620	Is that the tower battle on their building there?
1121620	1125620	Oh, we skipped over the negotiation and the dwarves are just helping now.
1125620	1127620	They've been constructing for a few years now.
1127620	1130620	Well, it only takes them five minutes to get there, so it's not a big deal.
1132620	1133620	Dwarves are fast builders.
1133620	1137620	They try too hard to sound poetic, don't they?
1137620	1138620	They do.
1138620	1140620	And they fail horribly.
1141620	1147620	You know, on my end, that kind of sounded like you saying, Arch, they try so hard to sound robotic.
1147620	1149620	You're back.
1149620	1151620	It really is a five minute walk.
1151620	1152620	Yep.
1156620	1159620	I feel like that's the edge of the set they built.
1159620	1160620	It is.
1162620	1164620	No fun allowed.
1164620	1171620	We're getting a bit of that House of Dragons problem here, where there are scenes that just appear and we're supposed to know things that have happened.
1172620	1175620	They're rushed to tell a story yet again.
1175620	1176620	Yeah.
1177620	1180620	Did the dwarves forget the elves have great hearing, by the way?
1182620	1183620	Yes.
1184620	1186620	I was going to say, like, the elves have fantastic hearing.
1191620	1192620	Their face was...
1192620	1195620	Okay, that was very stupid, but funny.
1195620	1197620	How does that even work?
1203620	1204620	Why the hell?
1204620	1207620	So are they alluding to them digging up the balrog?
1207620	1208620	Yes.
1208620	1210620	That's probably what they're heading for.
1210620	1215620	Now, we're going to do it in Spain is a while off in the story, but never fucking mind that.
1215620	1217620	They're just going to do it anyway.
1217620	1221620	I mean, the show has already broken the lore, so...
1221620	1222620	You know what they'll do?
1222620	1223620	You know what they'll do?
1223620	1224620	Okay.
1224620	1225620	What?
1225620	1231620	They're going to do a thing where Gandalf, someone's going to, either the stranger or whoever is going to be Gandalf,
1231620	1234620	and he's going to duel the balrog early.
1236620	1238620	We're going to Kenobi this shit, are we?
1238620	1239620	Yep.
1239620	1240620	They're going to just...
1240620	1243620	They're going to do what they did with Darth Maul and just start making shit up.
1243620	1248620	Like, oh yeah, he's alive and, like, they've had this long history for, like, ever.
1248620	1250620	It's like, okay, so you just want to milk it.
1250620	1251620	Like, yes, basically.
1251620	1254620	For no reason other than fan service.
1254620	1255620	Yeah.
1259620	1260620	That was easy.
1260620	1261620	That was easy.
1261620	1268620	His, uh, his children have access to the secret password, as you would expect.
1274620	1276620	You don't recognize it.
1276620	1277620	I guess the elves don't know about it.
1277620	1280620	The elves most, uh, definitely do.
1283620	1285620	It won't even go to my brain.
1285620	1288620	He just, like, dunes them out as he tells them.
1291620	1292620	Uranium.
1293620	1294620	No.
1296620	1299620	It does feel like more times past than we know.
1299620	1305620	This feels like months, maybe even years since the last scene we saw with them.
1305620	1306620	At the same time...
1306620	1307620	It does.
1307620	1311620	At the same time, the black elf, he has been in that orc camp for years.
1311620	1312620	No way.
1313620	1315620	He's been there for five whole minutes.
1321620	1322620	What?
1322620	1323620	Four dwarves down there.
1323620	1325620	They haven't been on this island for years either.
1325620	1327620	Something weird is going on with the timeline.
1327620	1331620	I'm pretty sure this is different timelines spread apart by quite a bit.
1331620	1333620	That's why there's going to be lots of sardons.
1333620	1336620	Or, it's terrible writing.
1336620	1337620	Alternatively.
1344620	1346620	Well, I guess I've been smooth-talked.
1348620	1349620	Okay.
1349620	1353620	No offense to that actor, but he's not good looking enough to make that line work.
1353620	1354620	Damn.
1354620	1356620	Dev's like, step aside, I got you.
1364620	1366620	She's gotta pee, but there's no pot.
1380620	1383620	Durr, glad we aren't stupid.
1391620	1393620	You'll be deported.
1393620	1396620	They really are keeping immigrants in cages.
1402620	1404620	Well, that was easy.
1404620	1406620	I'm convinced.
1406620	1408620	Yeah, that's three armed men.
1408620	1409620	Yeah.
1409620	1410620	Not much of a problem, really.
1410620	1411620	Jesus.
1411620	1412620	Okay.
1412620	1413620	What the fuck?
1415620	1416620	We've got a girl boss scene.
1416620	1417620	One down.
1417620	1418620	You know, many more to go.
1418620	1419620	Actually, two.
1419620	1423620	Hey, it was still a better fight scene than the one in Kenobi where the traitor woman
1423620	1425620	slapped the stormtrooper on the helmet.
1425620	1427620	He just fell over?
1427620	1428620	Yep.
1428620	1429620	It was a powerful slap.
1429620	1433620	I wonder how she'll get out of the heavily guarded tower, though.
1433620	1435620	Actually, I don't think about it.
1435620	1436620	I know exactly how.
1436620	1438620	Yes, by not thinking about it.
1438620	1441620	Yeah, they'll just scene cut and she'll be somewhere else.
1447620	1449620	You climbed the entire fucking...
1449620	1451620	Of course you did.
1451620	1453620	She was gonna swim across the ocean.
1457620	1459620	Oh no, Santa.
1459620	1461620	Not enough kids believe in Christmas anymore.
1461620	1465620	One last time, I'd like to test elf.
1467620	1470620	I would like some elf lucy.
1470620	1473620	This one was passed to my father.
1473620	1475620	And with it, a secret.
1475620	1478620	The secret's called the song of ice and fire.
1478620	1480620	Debbie made me cringe.
1489620	1491620	Aw, she didn't get the budget this time.
1491620	1493620	Only the water.
1493620	1496620	CG's expensive, okay?
1500620	1502620	Girlboss moment.
1502620	1506620	Literally, the only people who know the plot are the women.
1506620	1508620	Girlboss to girlboss.
1508620	1511620	Listen, Muriel, we're passing the backyard test right now,
1511620	1513620	so please stand with me.
1517620	1519620	Alongside the elves?
1519620	1521620	Bitch, the elves don't like you.
1521620	1523620	They told you to go away.
1523620	1525620	This puts you on a boat.
1525620	1527620	Ah yes, Theo, come out during the night.
1527620	1530620	The orcs are less active during the night, you see.
1530620	1533620	The orcs are more active at night, yeah.
1533620	1535620	And have greater strength at night. Oh no!
1535620	1538620	You can see better, but you can see worse.
1538620	1540620	Perfect timing.
1540620	1543620	Don't worry, it'll only be applicable one way.
1543620	1545620	Oh, still grabbing food.
1545620	1547620	Alright, bit of a chat.
1547620	1549620	Are they fucking one another?
1551620	1553620	Oh no, they're randomly killing one another.
1553620	1556620	I like that they established they couldn't smell him earlier,
1556620	1558620	but now none of them could.
1558620	1561620	See, the water is masking his scent.
1561620	1564620	This is literally a stealth scene from The Last of Us,
1564620	1567620	where you're just in a bit of grass.
1567620	1570620	Don't remind me of that goddamn king.
1570620	1572620	Thought we were gonna get a spooky scene.
1572620	1576620	I like how he doesn't even try to go into the shadows.
1576620	1578620	Don't worry, we're safe.
1578620	1580620	Don't worry.
1580620	1582620	It's not black, is it?
1582620	1584620	Oh god damn it, it is! How?
1584620	1586620	I can tell you why.
1586620	1589620	Because they need the character arcs to merge.
1589620	1591620	He escaped off camera.
1591620	1594620	What's his name? Adar? Adel?
1594620	1596620	Yeah, Adar let him go.
1596620	1599620	Fully armed, of course, not Irish.
1599620	1601620	I mean, he might have let him go,
1601620	1603620	but the other orcs might not know.
1603620	1605620	Okay, I'll take it they don't know.
1605620	1607620	No they're not.
1607620	1609620	They look so stupid, why are they white?
1609620	1611620	Why are you slowing down for him?
1614620	1616620	Did you just kick him?
1616620	1618620	He's like, my slide's broken!
1619620	1623620	You kicked him so that you could catch an arrow that would otherwise have missed it.
1623620	1625620	He's kind of a dick, actually.
1625620	1627620	Yes, yes he is.
1627620	1629620	I got a sickle!
1632620	1634620	How did you know they were there?
1634620	1639620	Should I run into, like, orcs shooting arrows on an off chance he's here?
1642620	1644620	360 no, Sko.
1646620	1651620	And then the sun breaks through because night's really short in Middle-earth.
1651620	1653620	Oh, my kangol!
1653620	1657620	They're not black enough, I shall defeat them with my tights.
1659620	1661620	The sun!
1661620	1663620	My god!
1663620	1668620	I know the orcs were chasing me in the sun earlier today when I was escaping from the quarry,
1668620	1670620	but I'm pretty sure it'll repel them this time.
1670620	1672620	What do you know?
1672620	1674620	Arch, is the sun rising outside right now?
1675620	1677620	It's been rising for a while, actually, yeah.
1677620	1679620	Oh, god.
1679620	1681620	Don't go outside, you'll stink, you'll melt.
1681620	1683620	Also, you've got a...
1683620	1686620	Is that a crossbow? How the hell did you get a crossbow? Never mind.
1686620	1688620	You could fire it at the elf.
1690620	1692620	You could shoot.
1692620	1694620	Yeah, they'd have arrows.
1702620	1704620	His dad actually got a new wife.
1704620	1707620	And this is just, like, the most convoluted possible story.
1707620	1709620	I turned into a star, son.
1709620	1711620	Is that the way elves go out for cigarettes?
1711620	1712620	Yes.
1712620	1714620	They are still the best part of this show.
1714620	1716620	Yeah, but not by much.
1716620	1718620	I do like their dynamic a lot.
1718620	1720620	Nice castle, bro.
1720620	1724620	Wait, this was the elves' garrison, this is their tower.
1724620	1726620	Shouldn't it look nicer than this?
1727620	1728620	Nope.
1728620	1731620	No, listen, they didn't have time to maintain it,
1731620	1733620	as they were so busy, uh,
1733620	1736620	staring off into the middle distance and seducing village women.
1737620	1741620	Man, I wish you elves had taken better care of this fucking fortress.
1742620	1743620	What kind of shit?
1743620	1745620	That would have been handy right about now.
1745620	1747620	It's not gonna really defend us, actually.
1747620	1749620	I think it's gonna fall over.
1751620	1753620	Oh, Jesus.
1763620	1765620	The sword is the ring.
1765620	1766620	Yay.
1766620	1768620	It is Sauron.
1768620	1770620	Mauler is wrong.
1770620	1772620	What did Mauler say?
1772620	1776620	Mauler said that that was Gandalf, not Sauron, the stranger.
1776620	1780620	It's pretty obvious from the way that he killed the fireflies that he was, like...
1780620	1781620	Mm-hmm.
1781620	1782620	Oh, wait a minute.
1782620	1784620	Was he like...
1784620	1786620	Was Adar controlling that human?
1786620	1788620	But I think he would be like, after that, be like,
1788620	1790620	What happened? My head hurts.
1790620	1793620	We do know that sorcerers have the ability to do that.
1793620	1794620	Like with Theoden.
1794620	1796620	To at least influence people.
1797620	1799620	Wait, this is the whole ship, is it?
1800620	1802620	We're gonna battle in the middle of this.
1802620	1805620	No, I assume it's gonna take her to a bigger boat.
1805620	1807620	Wanna just row back to the mainland?
1808620	1810620	It's what you deserve, elf.
1810620	1812620	They're just like, No, swim.
1812620	1814620	Just keep swimming. You can make it, right?
1814620	1818620	Like all elves, she prefers to stand in the fucking mountains.
1819620	1821620	Decemberism.
1823620	1826620	They gotta get punished for their racism.
1826620	1828620	I made the wrong decision.
1830620	1832620	We can just order them to stop still.
1833620	1834620	Yeah.
1834620	1836620	Rade, just come back!
1836620	1839620	She calls her back, and then the tree just immediately stops shedding.
1839620	1841620	It's like, okay, good.
1842620	1843620	Wait a minute.
1844620	1847620	So, they just change their mind after seeing that, I guess?
1847620	1848620	Actually?
1849620	1850620	Yep.
1850620	1853620	Well, I guess that's the most reasonable thing to do, actually.
1853620	1854620	Yeah?
1854620	1855620	Yeah.
1855620	1857620	I didn't see that coming.
1857620	1859620	And they're travelling to the Southlands.
1859620	1861620	Whom they apparently know is under threat.
1861620	1862620	I will serve.
1863620	1865620	I know that because of the map thing.
1867620	1869620	Are they seagulling, March?
1869620	1870620	Oh my god!
1871620	1872620	Hard up!
1873620	1875620	Cancelled. Cancelled.
1876620	1877620	Aces.
1878620	1880620	I was in a sudden turn for the darkness.
1881620	1883620	Hold on, his rings of power are based?
1886620	1887620	Well, there we go.
1887620	1888620	Yeah.
1888620	1891620	The plot suddenly sped up massively.
1891620	1893620	A lot of skipping.
1893620	1897620	I mean, at least interesting things are happening, but a lot of skipping.
1898620	1901620	It's become a show, and not just a train wreck.
1901620	1904620	I feel like it's probably too little too late, but...
1904620	1909620	The biggest problem is, it feels like I'm reading the script right now.
1911620	1914620	And it obviously has nothing to do with the actual Lord of the Rings.
1914620	1916620	So the trees start shedding, and she goes like,
1916620	1919620	Ah, this is what my daddy told me about! Jesus!
1919620	1920620	Yeah, so I was like...
1920620	1922620	Galadriel too has completely changed the tune.
1922620	1924620	It's no longer looking for Sauron.
1924620	1925620	He's not a potential threat.
1925620	1926620	No, no, no.
1926620	1928620	He's attacking the Southlands.
1928620	1929620	Alright.
1929620	1930620	Because, why?
1930620	1932620	Because you looked at the map and went like,
1932620	1934620	Huh, scribbles kind of look like that.
1934620	1935620	Basically...
1935620	1937620	There's a seagull that's...
1937620	1940620	And she has no reason to believe that there's an army there.
1940620	1942620	She thinks that maybe the orcs are moving there.
1942620	1944620	That Sauron might have a base there.
1944620	1946620	As far as she knows, it's simply a waypoint.
1946620	1947620	But no, it's like,
1947620	1949620	Ah, they're under siege.
1949620	1950620	They're under siege?
1950620	1952620	I'm the king of the Southlands, by the way.
1952620	1954620	I found him on the sea.
1954620	1957620	They do know that because of the character they found on the sea.
1957620	1960620	Because he tells her that they're under siege, and they're under attack.
1960620	1961620	And that they're being killed.
1961620	1963620	So it's all just based on his say-so, I guess?
1963620	1965620	Because he was there.
1965620	1966620	No, he wasn't.
1966620	1967620	Yeah, he was.
1967620	1969620	He said that he was driven from the lands.
1969620	1971620	No, he was talking about enemies and courses.
1972620	1975620	Like, the orcs haven't started attacking until recently.
1975620	1977620	Like, Black Elf literally was saying,
1977620	1980620	Like, oh gosh, I haven't seen shit for 70 years.
1980620	1983620	I could have sworn the dude at the sea, whatever his name is,
1983620	1987620	Said that they were under attack, and people were being pushed out of their land.
1987620	1990620	What if this is all part of his ploy?
1990620	1994620	What they'll do is they'll move all of the forces off of the island,
1994620	1996620	And then something bad will happen on the island.
1996620	1998620	See...
1998620	2001620	Judging by the story, as I know...
2003620	2005620	Arch?
2005620	2006620	Arch?
2006620	2008620	Arch has been judged.
2008620	2010620	Oh no.
2010620	2011620	Basil's down.
2011620	2014620	Oh, you know what I will say then, while we wait for Arch to return?
2014620	2015620	I'll say this.
2015620	2017620	No Harfoots this time.
2017620	2019620	You know what? I'm happy for that.
2019620	2021620	You're okay with that?
2021620	2027620	Instead of, like, awful Harfoot scenes, we got less awful dwarf scenes.
2027620	2031620	Just means we're gonna see lots of Harfoots next episode, probably.
2031620	2033620	Oh god. Yeah, we are.
2033620	2035620	Oh no, Arch dropped out!
2035620	2039620	Kibs, usually you record your thing after we've done this, right?
2039620	2041620	Mm-hmm.
2041620	2043620	Arch is gonna be gone.
2043620	2044620	Yeah.
2044620	2046620	Oh shit, what are you guys gonna do?
2046620	2050620	Well, we'll have to wait and see if he wakes up,
2050620	2052620	And if he doesn't, then I have to go to bed.
2052620	2054620	Then we do it tomorrow.
2054620	2056620	Oh no!
2057620	2062620	He might be back, because what he has to do is he goes out and resets his internet thingy.
2062620	2065620	Wait, he goes out? He goes outside?
2065620	2067620	It's in a separate building, apparently.
2067620	2068620	Oh Jesus, okay.
2068620	2071620	Well, in terms of the dwarven stuff, it was actually pretty good.
2071620	2074620	That story is a story that's very character-driven, right?
2074620	2081620	It's about the relationship between the dwarf prince and his wife, and Elrond, and...
2081620	2084620	There's a fun little thing going on there, and I'm enjoying it.
2084620	2086620	And now they added the king into the mix?
2086620	2090620	There's a bunch of character moments in there that are pretty satisfying.
2090620	2091620	Yes.
2091620	2094620	It's sort of like a touchback to Legolas and Gimli.
2094620	2095620	Welcome back.
2095620	2097620	Hi, welcome back.
2097620	2099620	I'm gonna call it right now.
2099620	2102620	Theo is Halbrand.
2103620	2105620	What makes you think that?
2105620	2110620	Because of the weird disjointed nature of all of this.
2110620	2112620	Okay, as you mentioned, right?
2112620	2114620	Halbrand has been driven from his home.
2114620	2119620	Now, I'm pretty sure he mentions corsairs, but he might have just mentioned enemies,
2119620	2123620	which I remember commenting on because it didn't make sense because, like, the world's at peace.
2123620	2125620	What fucking enemies?
2125620	2132620	But at the same time, Black Elf has been specifically placed in the Southlands to look for signs of the enemy.
2132620	2138620	They haven't seen shit for 70 years, and only now are there vague hints with the cows going mad.
2138620	2145620	So, there's no indication or reason to suggest that the Orcs were widespread or obvious,
2145620	2147620	so they couldn't have been attacking them.
2147620	2149620	So what drove them from their lands?
2149620	2152620	Well, maybe that was a different timeline.
2152620	2156620	Like, I'm really starting to lean towards the different timeline interpretation.
2156620	2161620	Yeah, so it's like what the Witcher did, basically, with everything happening at different times.
2161620	2167620	So, you think that the young kid, who has, like, the hilt of Sauron or whatever,
2167620	2170620	he's going to end up being Halbrand as an adult?
2170620	2175620	Perhaps. I don't have much basis for that, mind you. It's just a wild theory.
2175620	2176620	I mean, it could have...
2176620	2178620	He should have darker skin, if so.
2178620	2179620	It kind of feels...
2179620	2182620	Because I remember what shows it is. It's true.
2182620	2188620	You know what? That actually kind of feels right because the Black Elf story,
2188620	2191620	he's kind of, like, disjointed from everything else, you know?
2191620	2195620	Because we know that Galadriel's story is happening at the same time as Elrond's because they met up.
2195620	2197620	So, that's happening at the same time.
2197620	2203620	However, we also know that the Harfoot story is happening at the same time as the Black Elf story
2203620	2207620	because the guy just mentioned three weeks ago there was that meteor.
2207620	2212620	So, maybe this story is happening at two different time frames.
2212620	2216620	And, interestingly, nobody else is mentioning the meteor.
2216620	2219620	Like, Galadriel hasn't seen it. The new Noryns haven't seen it.
2219620	2222620	Now, maybe you could argue geography, but...
2222620	2224620	Yeah.
2224620	2225620	No, this makes sense.
2225620	2228620	Especially, yeah, because the kid gets corrupted with the Sauron Blade
2228620	2232620	and then he ends up somehow being the king.
2232620	2234620	Or maybe, who knows?
2234620	2237620	And then is found on the sea as an adult.
2237620	2242620	And he's already pretty Sauron-like as an adult.
2243620	2246620	It depends on whether he goes with the elves or stays.
2246620	2251620	Because what's going to happen now is that in the absence of the progressive woman queen,
2251620	2254620	whoever stays behind, be it Farazhon or Halibrand,
2254620	2260620	they're going to start properly corrupting people and Numenor is going to fall while she's away.
2260620	2265620	Because, obviously, she can't make a mistake. That'd be silly.
2265620	2273620	It's because of her absence that they're corrupted into believing that the elves are holding out in Valar.
2273620	2275620	They're prevented from having immortality.
2276620	2281620	Yes, then they'll return briefly. They'll get a few survivors, maybe, and then escape.
2281620	2285620	Or maybe this is the escape and then the island will just sink off-screen somewhere.
2285620	2288620	Everybody died and the people that made it come back are like,
2288620	2291620	Why is there just ocean everywhere?
2291620	2296620	Oh god, can you imagine? They used all the CG for the dream and they don't even show it in real life.
2296620	2299620	Oh, well, I mean, they did show it technically.
2299620	2301620	Don't worry, let's recycle the scenes even.
2301620	2303620	Oh god.
2303620	2306620	It was expensive, dammit.
2308620	2315620	The show is picking up. There's things happening and there's some enjoyable parts. It's not great.
2315620	2318620	But I still think House of the Dragons is better.
2318620	2324620	But, I mean, at least I'm not bored to fucking tears like I was to the first two hours of it, you know?
2324620	2328620	My opinion is actually this is more interesting than the previous episode of House of the Dragons.
2328620	2333620	Most of the stuff was actually happening and some of the character interactions were actually tolerable.
2333620	2336620	Specifically, Elrond and the Dwarf.
2336620	2338620	Yes, they remain the best part of the show.
2338620	2343620	They are the only part I enjoy. The show also has an enormous problem.
2343620	2347620	Now that the imagery is Adan, Adan actually does a pretty good job.
2347620	2353620	He is displaying actual emotions. He still tries too hard to be poetic.
2353620	2356620	You can see the script is still fucking struggling.
2356620	2358620	But he delivers it better than most.
2358620	2364620	And when he then acts opposite Mr. Puerto Rican who has one fucking facial expression.
2364620	2366620	Yep, it's like Galadriel ass.
2366620	2368620	It really hammers it home, isn't it?
2368620	2372620	It's like, wow, you have an actor and then you have this dude who's a model.
2372620	2377620	Yep, there's some really good talent here being wasted, which is tragic.
2377620	2380620	And it's being wasted because of the diversity hires.
2380620	2387620	Elrond is passable due to his chemistry with Durin, but Elrond himself is not very interesting.
2387620	2391620	He doesn't look like Elrond. He doesn't carry himself like Elrond.
2391620	2396620	At this point, though, I'm kind of a bit past worrying about the lore of it because you already know the lore is just...
2396620	2397620	It's already raped.
2397620	2400620	The Rufi has already run its course on the lore of the show.
2400620	2402620	It's basically irredeemable, you know?
2402620	2403620	Yeah.
2403620	2409620	But if we're going to forget about the lore and just talk about the quality of the show itself, it is at least improving.
2409620	2413620	Just give Helbren more screen time and I'll be happy.
2413620	2417620	Wait, hold on. Do you just have the hot spring or what?
2417620	2420620	I just like his character. And maybe...
2420620	2422620	Jesus.
2422620	2426620	Maybe Helbren talking some sense into Galadriel.
2426620	2427620	I assume this is a...
2427620	2430620	God damn it. That so badly should not...
2430620	2436620	She is already thousands of years old. She's already an accomplished diplomat.
2436620	2439620	And here he is like, bitch!
2439620	2449620	All he's saying is, don't fuck it up. You come into her house, you're rude as shit, and now you're surprised people are...
2449620	2452620	And now you're surprised you're in a cellar for sedition.
2452620	2460620	You're supposed to be a guest. You're supposed to be like a representative of the elves for the first time in how many years for these people?
2460620	2461620	Yeah, hang on.
2462620	2466620	And she's acting like the most insufferable, bastard-y, badgenable.
2466620	2469620	And then she's like, why are they jailing me? I don't understand.
2469620	2472620	And he goes like, why did they jail you, though?
2472620	2475620	Oh.
2475620	2478620	Hmm. Maybe I shouldn't have been on their floor.
2478620	2488620	You know, there's like a decent comedy skit here where you could have like Helbren just in jail, watching Galadriel get released and then put back in multiple times to go back again, eh?
2488620	2489620	Alright.
2489620	2498620	You know what? I do like the fact that they're focusing the story a little more and leaving the hardfoot stuff behind for this one.
2498620	2505620	Oh, god. You mention it, and suddenly I realize we didn't see those disgusting things all episode.
2505620	2509620	Which means next episode's gonna be all about them.
2509620	2518620	Don't you wanna know about their star signs and their culture and how they move and leave behind people?
2518620	2521620	Just a fucking rot?
2521620	2524620	Yeah, we talked about the hardfoots while you were gone, Arch.
2524620	2529620	We don't like you, sir. You're going all the way to the back.
2529620	2531620	Yep, back of the bus.
2531620	2535620	And that's why the episode felt better. No hardfoots.
2535620	2541620	Yeah, Arch, to be fair, we already talked about the hardfoots. You were left behind because you were offline at the moment.
2541620	2546620	Okay, so I think that might be it. At least for this video.
2546620	2550620	Welcome back next week and do some more, unfortunately.
2550620	2552620	Yep, more grinding.
2552620	2554620	We'll do it again.
2554620	2560620	We'll do it. I like how, Arch, you've been like, for like three years, you've been like, Dev, let me on your channel.
2560620	2563620	And this is what we're doing.
2563620	2565620	This was my thanks.
