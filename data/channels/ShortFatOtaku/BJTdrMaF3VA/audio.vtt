WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:08.760
I received an Amazon package today, as you sometimes do, and I noticed that the packing

00:08.760 --> 00:15.800
tape was Lord of the Rings, Rings of Power packing tape wrapped around the box.

00:15.800 --> 00:17.800
That's not a good sign, Des.

00:17.800 --> 00:20.140
And I'm just like, oh Jesus, so hold on.

00:20.140 --> 00:22.280
Every package Amazon's sending out.

00:22.280 --> 00:25.740
Because Naomi and I went for a walk today and we saw like packages and like other porches

00:25.740 --> 00:26.740
and stuff.

00:26.740 --> 00:29.540
And I'm not a porch pirate, but I kind of went up because like during the day everyone's

00:29.540 --> 00:32.100
out to work and I'm a lazy YouTuber sitting at home.

00:32.100 --> 00:34.020
So you know, the suburbs are emptied of people.

00:34.020 --> 00:37.940
So I walk up onto this porch of somebody else's house and I just look and it's like here's

00:37.940 --> 00:41.500
Amazon package and it has Rings of Power tape and then here's another one with Rings of

00:41.500 --> 00:42.500
Power tape.

00:42.500 --> 00:43.500
And I'm just like...

00:43.500 --> 00:48.540
Imagine being an OHE making $15.50 and just like your upper up just comes up, okay, now

00:48.540 --> 00:54.820
you gotta use this packing tape and just endless Lord of the Rings, Lord of the Rings, Lord

00:54.820 --> 00:55.820
of the Rings.

00:55.820 --> 01:00.020
I can't think of any other Prime Video show that's done this, where they've just converted

01:00.020 --> 01:02.340
all the Amazon boxes to advertise for it.

01:02.340 --> 01:06.300
I think they did one time before, but I can't remember what it was for.

01:06.300 --> 01:10.780
I remember seeing some advertisement stickers for something on the like the little duct

01:10.780 --> 01:11.780
tape they use.

01:11.780 --> 01:12.780
Normally they advertise...

01:12.780 --> 01:15.300
This is also, this is their big thing.

01:15.300 --> 01:16.860
This is the big thing.

01:16.860 --> 01:21.200
If this fails, they've basically said that Amazon Studios fails, which is why they've

01:21.200 --> 01:24.620
also basically said that they'll do anything to make it succeed.

01:24.620 --> 01:28.100
I don't know if you saw, but there's been two claims I've seen.

01:28.100 --> 01:34.480
One suggested that it had like 1.8 million actual views, but not tracking all devices.

01:34.480 --> 01:38.700
And then Amazon claims that they got 28 million views.

01:38.700 --> 01:42.900
That's one hell of a discrepancy and if you look at the reviews themselves, last time

01:42.900 --> 01:45.820
I checked, I think there was like 10, 12, 13,000?

01:45.820 --> 01:48.220
Hold on, Kibbs, you have it up.

01:48.220 --> 01:49.780
What does it say on yours?

01:49.780 --> 01:52.420
It was like 3.3 or something like that.

01:52.420 --> 01:53.420
Here, hold on.

01:54.420 --> 01:58.620
The Amazon rating is currently at 3.3 out of 5.

01:58.620 --> 01:59.620
Yeah.

01:59.620 --> 02:01.900
And that's out of 13,000 global ratings.

02:01.900 --> 02:08.960
So 25 million views, 13,000 people bothered to give it a rating.

02:08.960 --> 02:09.960
I don't know.

02:09.960 --> 02:14.600
There should probably be more reviews than that, but it kind of feels like, this is just

02:14.600 --> 02:18.700
me being a conspiracy brain here, but it kind of feels like they're only letting through

02:18.700 --> 02:25.660
enough reviews, like approving certain reviews, just to keep the number like above three.

02:25.660 --> 02:26.660
Probably.

02:26.660 --> 02:32.980
I will say on IMDb, the reverse review bombing campaign has, well, it has been gaining ground

02:32.980 --> 02:37.580
over the negative reviews, which is why I keep saying people need to review it.

02:37.580 --> 02:43.200
It's at 6.9 now and this is a genuine cultural battleground.

02:43.200 --> 02:44.660
And here's the reason why we know that.

02:44.700 --> 02:51.820
I don't know if you three have seen this article published by somebody named Stephen Colbert.

02:51.820 --> 02:53.260
It's just a coincidence.

02:53.260 --> 02:56.900
It's not Stephen Colbert, just a coincidence.

02:56.900 --> 03:03.460
This article is, the rings of power viewership numbers proves audience ratings are useless.

03:03.460 --> 03:04.580
I did see that one.

03:04.580 --> 03:08.700
I try to avoid the screen round whenever I can, but I didn't see that title.

03:08.700 --> 03:09.700
Yeah.

03:09.700 --> 03:10.700
Already bracing it.

03:10.700 --> 03:11.700
Yep.

03:11.780 --> 03:16.260
This article, it's promoting, first of all, it's promoting She-Hulk and it's promoting

03:16.260 --> 03:21.260
House of the Dragon and it's promoting the 25 million viewers watching rings of power.

03:21.260 --> 03:27.260
And it's saying basically that all of the places where, where viewers can put in their

03:27.260 --> 03:33.500
own reviews, Rotten Tomatoes, IMDb, Amazon itself, it's all just being review bombed

03:33.500 --> 03:35.260
and the reviews don't matter.

03:35.260 --> 03:39.300
Obviously from their perspective, this is the first step in trying to get rid of reviews

03:39.300 --> 03:42.060
because this is an obvious signal to people.

03:42.060 --> 03:45.860
That's why I keep saying we do need to review it because the norm is just look at the rating.

03:45.860 --> 03:50.380
If there wasn't a rating, the only narrative around rings of power was that anyone who

03:50.380 --> 03:54.420
hates it is a racist and that Amazon had 25 million viewers.

03:54.420 --> 03:58.060
There's also, I've seen varying usage of language.

03:58.060 --> 04:04.180
Like I've seen, for example, they say 25 million or 28 million viewers, not views, which makes

04:04.180 --> 04:10.420
me think like, okay, were there just 25 million people logged into prime at that time?

04:10.420 --> 04:14.300
Or maybe they're, they're like estimating like, oh, well on average, one person's watching

04:14.300 --> 04:15.300
it with someone else.

04:15.300 --> 04:16.300
So that's two viewers.

04:16.300 --> 04:19.340
If there's one click, I guess the last thing to talk about too, before we get into the

04:19.340 --> 04:25.900
video real quick is what they're using to defend what exactly what's happening, a statement

04:25.900 --> 04:31.260
issued by prime video and the cast of the show just straight up said middle earth is

04:31.260 --> 04:38.860
not all white and they refuse to ignore or tolerate harassment and abuse from fans directed

04:38.860 --> 04:40.500
at performers of color.

04:40.500 --> 04:42.180
They're correct.

04:42.180 --> 04:46.580
Middle earth is not all white, but they chose to place their story in the place where there

04:46.580 --> 04:48.540
are nothing but white people.

04:48.540 --> 04:55.100
So they came out and said that Tolkien created a world which by definition is multicultural,

04:55.100 --> 05:01.100
a world in which free peoples from different races and cultures joined together in a fellowship

05:01.100 --> 05:03.140
to defeat the forces of evil.

05:03.140 --> 05:06.620
Our world has never been all white, fantasy has never been all white and middle earth

05:06.620 --> 05:08.820
is not all white.

05:08.820 --> 05:14.860
So I'm just like, that's interesting because that's not canon because the fellowship fails.

05:14.860 --> 05:15.860
That's true.

05:15.860 --> 05:16.860
The fellowship does fail.

05:16.860 --> 05:20.480
So, so they're multiracial, multiethnic, you know, Alliance falls apart.

05:20.480 --> 05:21.480
That's true.

05:21.480 --> 05:24.940
At the same time though, you know, the fact that you had Aragorn and Gimli and Legolas

05:24.940 --> 05:27.660
altogether, that was kind of a unique situation in the lore.

05:27.660 --> 05:29.460
So I get, I get, I get their point.

05:29.460 --> 05:30.460
Fair enough.

05:30.820 --> 05:37.680
That's my point for that, but the overall, you know, story and lore and setting of Lord

05:37.680 --> 05:42.400
of the Rings is that, yeah, it is a multicultural world, but all of these cultures, they kind

05:42.400 --> 05:49.480
of have this desire to remain separate and not be brought under, let's say one, one banner,

05:49.480 --> 05:55.300
one empire, one multiethnic empire, like Sauron's for example.

05:55.300 --> 06:00.580
The thing is too, the focus was never on the cultures or the race.

06:00.580 --> 06:06.300
Like that is a, it is an irrelevancy because it is good versus evil, which is why the men

06:06.300 --> 06:12.220
of the East are portrayed as evil because in the story, that's all they need.

06:12.220 --> 06:15.580
Honestly, Lord of the Rings is kind of like a world full of ethnostates.

06:15.580 --> 06:21.180
Uh, unironically, yes, and after the war ends, it kind of remains that way.

06:21.180 --> 06:27.180
When they reformed the kingdom of Arnor and Gondor, when they combine, uh, King Aragorn

06:27.180 --> 06:33.900
basically grants the Shire as a, a, uh, sovereign state within his new kingdom and also forbids

06:33.900 --> 06:35.500
men from entering it.

06:35.500 --> 06:39.220
It is actually unironically an ethnostate.

06:39.220 --> 06:44.700
So wait, does that mean that we can't go down there and get any, any hubbitusi?

06:44.700 --> 06:46.840
Basically, yeah.

06:46.840 --> 06:48.780
And the problem is always remains also though.

06:48.780 --> 06:49.780
Okay.

06:49.780 --> 06:50.780
All right.

06:50.780 --> 06:51.780
Sure.

06:51.780 --> 06:52.780
Absolutely.

06:52.780 --> 06:53.780
And it was never all one.

06:53.780 --> 06:54.780
All right.

06:54.780 --> 06:55.780
Fine as well.

06:55.780 --> 07:00.060
Uh, why didn't you place your story there then like, why aren't you telling the tale

07:00.060 --> 07:01.060
of the Haradrin?

07:01.060 --> 07:03.640
Uh, some of them might've been resisting Sauron.

07:03.640 --> 07:04.860
You can make this shit up.

07:04.860 --> 07:10.020
You own the rights to it now or in, um, Cund or in Uruun.

07:10.020 --> 07:11.860
Why isn't there any of the story placed there?

07:11.860 --> 07:12.860
Oh, that's right.

07:12.860 --> 07:14.220
Because nobody fucking cares.

07:14.220 --> 07:15.540
That's the hard truth.

07:15.540 --> 07:20.700
And making us care is as the rings of power has demonstrated well beyond the capabilities

07:20.700 --> 07:22.500
of the current show it on us.

07:22.500 --> 07:23.500
Okay.

07:23.500 --> 07:25.780
I think it's time for us to Jesus Christ.

07:25.780 --> 07:27.980
Look at the episodes are getting longer.

07:27.980 --> 07:31.860
One hour, five, one hour, seven, one hour, an hour, 11 minutes.

07:31.860 --> 07:38.020
Holy shit guys finale will be two hours at some point.

07:38.020 --> 07:45.420
Sorry arch, you know, why don't you just let's procrastinate, arch, why don't you just sleep

07:45.420 --> 07:47.300
and get up at like five or something?

07:47.900 --> 07:51.500
Here's me while I lean into my microphone here just for a second.

07:51.500 --> 07:56.940
Oh God, let me just take my headphones out.

07:56.940 --> 08:00.940
Because that'll really fuck up my sleep schedule, Dev.

08:00.940 --> 08:04.100
It was still loud even with the mom.

08:04.100 --> 08:08.220
Wait, what's your normal sleep schedule?

08:08.220 --> 08:09.220
Not good.

08:09.220 --> 08:10.740
And this looked like it was.

08:10.740 --> 08:13.660
Meanwhile, Lilith, you sleep for about 18 hours a day.

08:13.660 --> 08:14.660
Oh my God.

08:14.660 --> 08:15.660
That's not true.

08:15.660 --> 08:20.620
I sleep 20 hours a day.

08:20.620 --> 08:26.100
Lord of the Rings, the Rings of Power, episode four.

08:26.100 --> 08:27.660
What's the title, Gibbs?

08:27.660 --> 08:28.660
The Great Wave.

08:28.660 --> 08:29.660
The Great Wave.

08:29.660 --> 08:30.660
Okay.

08:30.660 --> 08:31.660
That's the plan.

08:31.660 --> 08:32.660
Maybe someone will drown.

08:32.660 --> 08:33.660
That'd be funny.

08:33.660 --> 08:36.500
Maybe it'll be me.

08:36.500 --> 08:37.500
Oh God, a gun.

08:37.500 --> 08:38.500
I wish I had one.

08:38.500 --> 08:39.500
Marshalls.

08:39.500 --> 08:40.500
Wham.

08:40.500 --> 08:43.940
I tried to watch that show there, by the way.

08:43.940 --> 08:45.700
She was like, oh, action show.

08:45.700 --> 08:46.700
That's cool.

08:46.700 --> 08:47.700
It's just porn for women.

08:47.700 --> 08:52.660
And I was sitting there like, I realized that this is what this is.

08:52.660 --> 08:53.660
Oh my God.

08:53.660 --> 08:55.380
They're just undressed men all the time.

08:55.380 --> 08:56.380
Yes.

08:56.380 --> 08:58.980
How come we don't get that for men?

08:58.980 --> 09:01.820
Well, that's because we're misogynists.

09:01.820 --> 09:04.900
But unfortunately I showed my mother the first episode and she said, this is a very good

09:04.900 --> 09:05.900
TV show.

09:05.900 --> 09:06.900
I was like, mm-hmm.

09:06.900 --> 09:07.900
I guess.

09:07.900 --> 09:14.460
God, I hate that fucking plot twist so much, by the way.

09:14.460 --> 09:16.460
Should I get your map?

09:16.460 --> 09:17.460
Just a map of Mordor.

09:17.460 --> 09:18.460
Where?

09:18.460 --> 09:20.940
A fucking orc can figure it out, but a Galadriel's like, huh.

09:20.940 --> 09:25.420
The cliche with like, uh, people don't know what's going on with the math board until

09:25.420 --> 09:27.500
some random woman scribbles it.

09:27.500 --> 09:28.500
Yeah.

09:28.500 --> 09:29.500
It's upside down.

09:29.500 --> 09:30.500
Oh, shoot.

09:30.500 --> 09:31.500
Oh.

09:31.500 --> 09:33.140
Whoops the board upside down.

09:33.140 --> 09:34.140
All right.

09:34.140 --> 09:35.540
We can skip this this time.

09:35.540 --> 09:36.540
Fuck it.

09:36.540 --> 09:37.540
Let's get through it.

09:38.180 --> 09:39.180
Watch it.

09:39.180 --> 09:40.180
Like the fucking button.

09:40.180 --> 09:41.180
Are you positive?

09:41.180 --> 09:45.980
Like the fucking devs needs to be tortured with the interim.

09:45.980 --> 09:48.260
Oh, they don't need to skip parts of it.

09:48.260 --> 09:50.380
Yeah, we still got it.

09:50.380 --> 09:51.380
We had to see the big name.

09:51.380 --> 09:53.180
That way it's burned into a redness.

09:53.180 --> 09:55.180
Hey, look, it's Minas Tiras.

09:55.180 --> 09:57.300
Wait, are they doing that?

09:57.300 --> 09:58.300
Yeah.

09:58.300 --> 10:00.300
Didn't you see the, the house outstretched?

10:00.300 --> 10:01.300
Yeah.

10:01.300 --> 10:02.300
Yeah.

10:02.300 --> 10:05.020
Are they, are they saying this is like, no, it's not the same place, but like the same

10:05.020 --> 10:07.020
architecture, I guess.

10:07.020 --> 10:10.820
This is literally for the foreigner.

10:10.820 --> 10:11.820
It's too bad.

10:11.820 --> 10:12.820
There wasn't an R in that name.

10:12.820 --> 10:13.820
She could have rolled it.

10:13.820 --> 10:15.620
I think my nose broke from the symbolism again.

10:15.620 --> 10:18.620
Oh no, the island's going to sink.

10:18.620 --> 10:19.620
Yeah.

10:19.620 --> 10:23.340
And in case you were wondering, this is going to be a dream sequence, isn't it?

10:23.340 --> 10:25.220
It's going to be like a premonition to the future.

10:25.220 --> 10:28.860
She's going to wake up and like, Oh my God, my island's collapsing.

10:28.860 --> 10:36.420
This fall of Númenor, this will be a sudden escalation if it wasn't.

10:36.820 --> 10:38.820
Now that tower wasn't actually touched by anything.

10:38.820 --> 10:41.700
So that just, that was just, you know, shoddy building.

10:41.700 --> 10:43.700
That is a massive ass bed.

10:43.700 --> 10:45.020
For one person to sleep on.

10:45.020 --> 10:46.020
Yeah.

10:46.020 --> 10:47.020
She wasn't even sleeping on it.

10:47.020 --> 10:50.180
She's on a chair and she's fully dressed.

10:50.180 --> 10:54.980
I had a comment on one of my videos basically saying, wouldn't it be amazing if Númenor

10:54.980 --> 10:57.540
was just filled with chads and stacies, et cetera.

10:57.540 --> 11:03.380
And yes, it would like like a chance in Amazon's, I think just lots of beautiful, massive, muscular

11:03.380 --> 11:04.380
people.

11:04.380 --> 11:07.500
Cause these are supposed to be a superior race to humans.

11:07.500 --> 11:11.500
Like it should literally be filled with just massive ass Hercules dudes.

11:11.500 --> 11:14.340
They're long lived, very, you know, healthy.

11:14.340 --> 11:17.260
Aren't they like humans though, but like better humans?

11:17.260 --> 11:18.260
They were.

11:18.260 --> 11:19.260
Yeah.

11:19.260 --> 11:20.780
These people are what we would call Arians.

11:20.780 --> 11:26.340
Which is a bit cruel, dear, but yes, that is theoretically correct.

11:26.340 --> 11:32.620
Hey, listen, nothing wrong with loving elves.

11:32.620 --> 11:40.820
The only thing they're good for.

11:40.820 --> 11:43.820
You tell them, Karl Marx.

11:43.820 --> 11:50.340
Oh no, I think I got a little book for you.

11:50.340 --> 11:53.340
I think he's the bad guy.

11:53.340 --> 11:56.860
Bad guy always says, trust me.

11:56.860 --> 11:59.340
Wait, from where?

11:59.340 --> 12:03.180
Oh, they're just going to bring them out from somewhere?

12:03.180 --> 12:04.180
Magic.

12:04.180 --> 12:14.300
Here's the thing, whenever I, at this point, whenever I see a character like this in a

12:14.300 --> 12:16.820
modern show, I always wonder like, are they going to do a Trump?

12:16.820 --> 12:18.820
Are they going to make him like a Trump style guy?

12:18.820 --> 12:21.980
He's at a podium and like rallying up a crowd.

12:21.980 --> 12:23.980
Make Númenor great again.

12:23.980 --> 12:42.060
And they got away, both of them.

12:42.060 --> 12:43.060
I like that.

12:43.060 --> 12:44.060
Okay.

12:44.060 --> 12:54.780
You're not going to comment on the fact that everyone believes Sauron died like a couple

12:54.780 --> 12:55.780
hundred years ago?

12:55.780 --> 12:56.780
No?

12:56.780 --> 12:57.780
Okay.

12:57.780 --> 12:58.780
Nope.

12:58.780 --> 13:09.260
They're going to skip over the, I don't believe Sauron's back, part of the story.

13:09.260 --> 13:18.020
Now you jumped off a boat and almost got eaten by a big fish.

13:18.020 --> 13:19.020
Well, that didn't work out.

13:19.020 --> 13:20.020
You're in jail.

13:20.020 --> 13:21.020
You know what?

13:21.020 --> 13:22.020
I don't mind that.

13:22.020 --> 13:24.020
Like this is, this is okay.

13:24.020 --> 13:25.020
Okay.

13:25.020 --> 13:26.020
There's a few good things.

13:26.020 --> 13:30.980
I think it's mildly funny, but at the same time, this is supposed to be Galadriel.

13:30.980 --> 13:36.060
Like she isn't just an angry wench.

13:36.060 --> 13:40.860
She has to show how empowered she is, Starch.

13:40.860 --> 13:42.860
Are you a sexist?

13:42.860 --> 13:43.860
Yes.

13:43.860 --> 13:55.980
If I let go of this rope, the ASMR voice will whisper to me again.

13:55.980 --> 13:56.980
Oops.

13:56.980 --> 13:57.980
Yeah.

13:57.980 --> 14:01.700
Haven't we seen this scene already?

14:01.700 --> 14:08.740
I think he thought about it last time and he didn't do it.

14:08.740 --> 14:09.740
That was deliberate.

14:09.740 --> 14:10.740
Correct.

14:10.740 --> 14:11.740
Beat him.

14:11.740 --> 14:12.740
What?

14:12.740 --> 14:13.740
All three of you.

14:13.740 --> 14:14.740
What?

14:14.740 --> 14:15.740
What?

14:15.740 --> 14:16.740
What?

14:16.740 --> 14:17.740
It's a bit cruel.

14:17.740 --> 14:18.740
Bit extreme.

14:18.740 --> 14:19.740
Oh, he's Batman.

14:19.740 --> 14:20.740
Oh no.

14:20.740 --> 14:21.740
I don't care about this guy.

14:21.740 --> 14:22.740
God dammit.

14:22.740 --> 14:23.740
Ah.

14:23.740 --> 14:24.740
The white power auras again.

14:24.740 --> 14:25.740
Was that supposed to be intimidating?

14:25.740 --> 14:26.740
I thought that was funny.

14:26.740 --> 14:41.260
He's like, I'm a elf orc, an orfk.

14:41.260 --> 14:42.540
Some chubby ears there, my boy.

14:42.540 --> 14:45.820
You should get that looked at.

14:45.820 --> 14:46.820
Is it going to be force healing?

14:46.820 --> 14:49.940
He's going to stab his neck.

14:49.940 --> 14:50.940
Doubt it.

14:50.940 --> 14:51.940
Mm-hmm.

14:52.140 --> 14:55.140
Stabs deeper.

14:55.140 --> 15:03.140
I remember how much the Orcs cared about their own.

15:03.140 --> 15:05.140
Yeah, they ate him.

15:05.140 --> 15:16.940
Remember when they got up the head and were like, Meatwag on the menu.

15:16.940 --> 15:17.940
I like this guy.

15:17.940 --> 15:21.940
He's a better actor than the main characters so far.

15:21.940 --> 15:23.940
Oh, Jesus.

15:23.940 --> 15:25.940
Oh, well, well, again.

15:25.940 --> 15:29.940
Thank God, Vargapug lived.

15:29.940 --> 15:34.540
See, this actually kind of makes it worse because his performance is actually pretty

15:34.540 --> 15:35.540
damn good here.

15:35.540 --> 15:38.940
And then you've got portion of you can do it just half interestingly.

15:38.940 --> 15:40.780
Where are you?

15:40.780 --> 15:43.180
Like a monster or something?

15:43.180 --> 15:46.620
The watchtower is perfectly intact.

15:47.620 --> 15:49.620
By the humans.

15:49.620 --> 15:56.620
So, I guess when the elves disengaged and left, they were just caught on the road.

15:56.620 --> 16:01.620
Yes, they just decided to leave without Black Elf.

16:01.620 --> 16:05.620
Well, he wasn't worth much to them, was he?

16:05.620 --> 16:08.620
Ah, five potatoes.

16:08.620 --> 16:10.620
You didn't pack food?

16:10.620 --> 16:14.620
Why did you not pack food?

16:14.620 --> 16:20.620
You can kind of see his ears poking through the hair.

16:20.620 --> 16:22.620
And they look kind of elven.

16:22.620 --> 16:24.620
Yeah, that's a hidden thing.

16:24.620 --> 16:28.620
I don't know how he would have been able to hide that for so long.

16:28.620 --> 16:31.620
Just Justin Bieber hair for like ten years.

16:31.620 --> 16:38.620
Well, they don't seem to be doing any efforts of sneaking or hiding or any subterfuge whatsoever,

16:38.620 --> 16:40.620
so why wasn't this a good idea?

16:40.620 --> 16:41.620
They show no fear whatsoever.

16:41.620 --> 16:43.620
They just wandered in here.

16:43.620 --> 16:45.620
Hey, one of them's showing fear.

16:45.620 --> 16:46.620
The other guy's careless.

16:46.620 --> 16:49.620
He feels like he has protagonist immunity.

16:49.620 --> 16:53.620
He's got a magic sword, so he's going to use magic bullshit to be okay.

16:53.620 --> 16:56.620
It feels like he's sneaking to the cookie jar.

16:56.620 --> 16:59.620
I just hate the fact that they didn't bring the food.

16:59.620 --> 17:00.620
Like, why?

17:00.620 --> 17:01.620
What possible reason?

17:01.620 --> 17:02.620
They just left it there.

17:02.620 --> 17:04.620
They were in a rush, okay?

17:04.620 --> 17:06.620
He's going to die.

17:06.620 --> 17:09.620
Other guy's going to run back with a cart full of food.

17:09.620 --> 17:11.620
Rowan might be in deep shit.

17:14.620 --> 17:17.620
The orcs aren't fucking movie monsters, Jesus Christ.

17:17.620 --> 17:19.620
They're not stealthy.

17:20.620 --> 17:22.620
Are there anything but subtle?

17:22.620 --> 17:24.620
Hey, I can see his arm.

17:26.620 --> 17:28.620
That wasn't even scary.

17:29.620 --> 17:31.620
He was just standing there.

17:31.620 --> 17:34.620
He was waiting for the dramatic reveal.

17:40.620 --> 17:42.620
You recognize that, don't you?

17:43.620 --> 17:44.620
Excuse me.

17:44.620 --> 17:45.620
Whoa!

17:45.620 --> 17:49.620
Hey, when did you learn to do that?

17:49.620 --> 17:51.620
He just stabbed himself with it.

17:51.620 --> 17:53.620
Just let it drop blood, I guess.

17:53.620 --> 17:55.620
Yeah, that was a bad idea, wasn't it?

17:55.620 --> 17:59.620
If that's able to activate like a lightsaber just every time you stab yourself.

17:59.620 --> 18:01.620
It's like a bad place to hide.

18:02.620 --> 18:04.620
This is a pretty bad place to hide.

18:04.620 --> 18:07.620
It's like Saddam Hussein's hidey hole.

18:08.620 --> 18:10.620
His gamer cave.

18:11.620 --> 18:12.620
Yeah.

18:13.620 --> 18:15.620
Oh, that was grunted.

18:15.620 --> 18:16.620
That's rare.

18:23.620 --> 18:26.620
Were you expecting to stab to the bottom of the well or something?

18:29.620 --> 18:31.620
No, that's loud, by the way.

18:31.620 --> 18:32.620
Yeah, that.

18:34.620 --> 18:35.620
Splash!

18:36.620 --> 18:38.620
That goes up the fucking thing.

18:39.620 --> 18:41.620
Is that the tower battle on their building there?

18:41.620 --> 18:45.620
Oh, we skipped over the negotiation and the dwarves are just helping now.

18:45.620 --> 18:47.620
They've been constructing for a few years now.

18:47.620 --> 18:50.620
Well, it only takes them five minutes to get there, so it's not a big deal.

18:52.620 --> 18:53.620
Dwarves are fast builders.

18:53.620 --> 18:57.620
They try too hard to sound poetic, don't they?

18:57.620 --> 18:58.620
They do.

18:58.620 --> 19:00.620
And they fail horribly.

19:01.620 --> 19:07.620
You know, on my end, that kind of sounded like you saying, Arch, they try so hard to sound robotic.

19:07.620 --> 19:09.620
You're back.

19:09.620 --> 19:11.620
It really is a five minute walk.

19:11.620 --> 19:12.620
Yep.

19:16.620 --> 19:19.620
I feel like that's the edge of the set they built.

19:19.620 --> 19:20.620
It is.

19:22.620 --> 19:24.620
No fun allowed.

19:24.620 --> 19:31.620
We're getting a bit of that House of Dragons problem here, where there are scenes that just appear and we're supposed to know things that have happened.

19:32.620 --> 19:35.620
They're rushed to tell a story yet again.

19:35.620 --> 19:36.620
Yeah.

19:37.620 --> 19:40.620
Did the dwarves forget the elves have great hearing, by the way?

19:42.620 --> 19:43.620
Yes.

19:44.620 --> 19:46.620
I was going to say, like, the elves have fantastic hearing.

19:51.620 --> 19:52.620
Their face was...

19:52.620 --> 19:55.620
Okay, that was very stupid, but funny.

19:55.620 --> 19:57.620
How does that even work?

20:03.620 --> 20:04.620
Why the hell?

20:04.620 --> 20:07.620
So are they alluding to them digging up the balrog?

20:07.620 --> 20:08.620
Yes.

20:08.620 --> 20:10.620
That's probably what they're heading for.

20:10.620 --> 20:15.620
Now, we're going to do it in Spain is a while off in the story, but never fucking mind that.

20:15.620 --> 20:17.620
They're just going to do it anyway.

20:17.620 --> 20:21.620
I mean, the show has already broken the lore, so...

20:21.620 --> 20:22.620
You know what they'll do?

20:22.620 --> 20:23.620
You know what they'll do?

20:23.620 --> 20:24.620
Okay.

20:24.620 --> 20:25.620
What?

20:25.620 --> 20:31.620
They're going to do a thing where Gandalf, someone's going to, either the stranger or whoever is going to be Gandalf,

20:31.620 --> 20:34.620
and he's going to duel the balrog early.

20:36.620 --> 20:38.620
We're going to Kenobi this shit, are we?

20:38.620 --> 20:39.620
Yep.

20:39.620 --> 20:40.620
They're going to just...

20:40.620 --> 20:43.620
They're going to do what they did with Darth Maul and just start making shit up.

20:43.620 --> 20:48.620
Like, oh yeah, he's alive and, like, they've had this long history for, like, ever.

20:48.620 --> 20:50.620
It's like, okay, so you just want to milk it.

20:50.620 --> 20:51.620
Like, yes, basically.

20:51.620 --> 20:54.620
For no reason other than fan service.

20:54.620 --> 20:55.620
Yeah.

20:59.620 --> 21:00.620
That was easy.

21:00.620 --> 21:01.620
That was easy.

21:01.620 --> 21:08.620
His, uh, his children have access to the secret password, as you would expect.

21:14.620 --> 21:16.620
You don't recognize it.

21:16.620 --> 21:17.620
I guess the elves don't know about it.

21:17.620 --> 21:20.620
The elves most, uh, definitely do.

21:23.620 --> 21:25.620
It won't even go to my brain.

21:25.620 --> 21:28.620
He just, like, dunes them out as he tells them.

21:31.620 --> 21:32.620
Uranium.

21:33.620 --> 21:34.620
No.

21:36.620 --> 21:39.620
It does feel like more times past than we know.

21:39.620 --> 21:45.620
This feels like months, maybe even years since the last scene we saw with them.

21:45.620 --> 21:46.620
At the same time...

21:46.620 --> 21:47.620
It does.

21:47.620 --> 21:51.620
At the same time, the black elf, he has been in that orc camp for years.

21:51.620 --> 21:52.620
No way.

21:53.620 --> 21:55.620
He's been there for five whole minutes.

22:01.620 --> 22:02.620
What?

22:02.620 --> 22:03.620
Four dwarves down there.

22:03.620 --> 22:05.620
They haven't been on this island for years either.

22:05.620 --> 22:07.620
Something weird is going on with the timeline.

22:07.620 --> 22:11.620
I'm pretty sure this is different timelines spread apart by quite a bit.

22:11.620 --> 22:13.620
That's why there's going to be lots of sardons.

22:13.620 --> 22:16.620
Or, it's terrible writing.

22:16.620 --> 22:17.620
Alternatively.

22:24.620 --> 22:26.620
Well, I guess I've been smooth-talked.

22:28.620 --> 22:29.620
Okay.

22:29.620 --> 22:33.620
No offense to that actor, but he's not good looking enough to make that line work.

22:33.620 --> 22:34.620
Damn.

22:34.620 --> 22:36.620
Dev's like, step aside, I got you.

22:44.620 --> 22:46.620
She's gotta pee, but there's no pot.

23:00.620 --> 23:03.620
Durr, glad we aren't stupid.

23:11.620 --> 23:13.620
You'll be deported.

23:13.620 --> 23:16.620
They really are keeping immigrants in cages.

23:22.620 --> 23:24.620
Well, that was easy.

23:24.620 --> 23:26.620
I'm convinced.

23:26.620 --> 23:28.620
Yeah, that's three armed men.

23:28.620 --> 23:29.620
Yeah.

23:29.620 --> 23:30.620
Not much of a problem, really.

23:30.620 --> 23:31.620
Jesus.

23:31.620 --> 23:32.620
Okay.

23:32.620 --> 23:33.620
What the fuck?

23:35.620 --> 23:36.620
We've got a girl boss scene.

23:36.620 --> 23:37.620
One down.

23:37.620 --> 23:38.620
You know, many more to go.

23:38.620 --> 23:39.620
Actually, two.

23:39.620 --> 23:43.620
Hey, it was still a better fight scene than the one in Kenobi where the traitor woman

23:43.620 --> 23:45.620
slapped the stormtrooper on the helmet.

23:45.620 --> 23:47.620
He just fell over?

23:47.620 --> 23:48.620
Yep.

23:48.620 --> 23:49.620
It was a powerful slap.

23:49.620 --> 23:53.620
I wonder how she'll get out of the heavily guarded tower, though.

23:53.620 --> 23:55.620
Actually, I don't think about it.

23:55.620 --> 23:56.620
I know exactly how.

23:56.620 --> 23:58.620
Yes, by not thinking about it.

23:58.620 --> 24:01.620
Yeah, they'll just scene cut and she'll be somewhere else.

24:07.620 --> 24:09.620
You climbed the entire fucking...

24:09.620 --> 24:11.620
Of course you did.

24:11.620 --> 24:13.620
She was gonna swim across the ocean.

24:17.620 --> 24:19.620
Oh no, Santa.

24:19.620 --> 24:21.620
Not enough kids believe in Christmas anymore.

24:21.620 --> 24:25.620
One last time, I'd like to test elf.

24:27.620 --> 24:30.620
I would like some elf lucy.

24:30.620 --> 24:33.620
This one was passed to my father.

24:33.620 --> 24:35.620
And with it, a secret.

24:35.620 --> 24:38.620
The secret's called the song of ice and fire.

24:38.620 --> 24:40.620
Debbie made me cringe.

24:49.620 --> 24:51.620
Aw, she didn't get the budget this time.

24:51.620 --> 24:53.620
Only the water.

24:53.620 --> 24:56.620
CG's expensive, okay?

25:00.620 --> 25:02.620
Girlboss moment.

25:02.620 --> 25:06.620
Literally, the only people who know the plot are the women.

25:06.620 --> 25:08.620
Girlboss to girlboss.

25:08.620 --> 25:11.620
Listen, Muriel, we're passing the backyard test right now,

25:11.620 --> 25:13.620
so please stand with me.

25:17.620 --> 25:19.620
Alongside the elves?

25:19.620 --> 25:21.620
Bitch, the elves don't like you.

25:21.620 --> 25:23.620
They told you to go away.

25:23.620 --> 25:25.620
This puts you on a boat.

25:25.620 --> 25:27.620
Ah yes, Theo, come out during the night.

25:27.620 --> 25:30.620
The orcs are less active during the night, you see.

25:30.620 --> 25:33.620
The orcs are more active at night, yeah.

25:33.620 --> 25:35.620
And have greater strength at night. Oh no!

25:35.620 --> 25:38.620
You can see better, but you can see worse.

25:38.620 --> 25:40.620
Perfect timing.

25:40.620 --> 25:43.620
Don't worry, it'll only be applicable one way.

25:43.620 --> 25:45.620
Oh, still grabbing food.

25:45.620 --> 25:47.620
Alright, bit of a chat.

25:47.620 --> 25:49.620
Are they fucking one another?

25:51.620 --> 25:53.620
Oh no, they're randomly killing one another.

25:53.620 --> 25:56.620
I like that they established they couldn't smell him earlier,

25:56.620 --> 25:58.620
but now none of them could.

25:58.620 --> 26:01.620
See, the water is masking his scent.

26:01.620 --> 26:04.620
This is literally a stealth scene from The Last of Us,

26:04.620 --> 26:07.620
where you're just in a bit of grass.

26:07.620 --> 26:10.620
Don't remind me of that goddamn king.

26:10.620 --> 26:12.620
Thought we were gonna get a spooky scene.

26:12.620 --> 26:16.620
I like how he doesn't even try to go into the shadows.

26:16.620 --> 26:18.620
Don't worry, we're safe.

26:18.620 --> 26:20.620
Don't worry.

26:20.620 --> 26:22.620
It's not black, is it?

26:22.620 --> 26:24.620
Oh god damn it, it is! How?

26:24.620 --> 26:26.620
I can tell you why.

26:26.620 --> 26:29.620
Because they need the character arcs to merge.

26:29.620 --> 26:31.620
He escaped off camera.

26:31.620 --> 26:34.620
What's his name? Adar? Adel?

26:34.620 --> 26:36.620
Yeah, Adar let him go.

26:36.620 --> 26:39.620
Fully armed, of course, not Irish.

26:39.620 --> 26:41.620
I mean, he might have let him go,

26:41.620 --> 26:43.620
but the other orcs might not know.

26:43.620 --> 26:45.620
Okay, I'll take it they don't know.

26:45.620 --> 26:47.620
No they're not.

26:47.620 --> 26:49.620
They look so stupid, why are they white?

26:49.620 --> 26:51.620
Why are you slowing down for him?

26:54.620 --> 26:56.620
Did you just kick him?

26:56.620 --> 26:58.620
He's like, my slide's broken!

26:59.620 --> 27:03.620
You kicked him so that you could catch an arrow that would otherwise have missed it.

27:03.620 --> 27:05.620
He's kind of a dick, actually.

27:05.620 --> 27:07.620
Yes, yes he is.

27:07.620 --> 27:09.620
I got a sickle!

27:12.620 --> 27:14.620
How did you know they were there?

27:14.620 --> 27:19.620
Should I run into, like, orcs shooting arrows on an off chance he's here?

27:22.620 --> 27:24.620
360 no, Sko.

27:26.620 --> 27:31.620
And then the sun breaks through because night's really short in Middle-earth.

27:31.620 --> 27:33.620
Oh, my kangol!

27:33.620 --> 27:37.620
They're not black enough, I shall defeat them with my tights.

27:39.620 --> 27:41.620
The sun!

27:41.620 --> 27:43.620
My god!

27:43.620 --> 27:48.620
I know the orcs were chasing me in the sun earlier today when I was escaping from the quarry,

27:48.620 --> 27:50.620
but I'm pretty sure it'll repel them this time.

27:50.620 --> 27:52.620
What do you know?

27:52.620 --> 27:54.620
Arch, is the sun rising outside right now?

27:55.620 --> 27:57.620
It's been rising for a while, actually, yeah.

27:57.620 --> 27:59.620
Oh, god.

27:59.620 --> 28:01.620
Don't go outside, you'll stink, you'll melt.

28:01.620 --> 28:03.620
Also, you've got a...

28:03.620 --> 28:06.620
Is that a crossbow? How the hell did you get a crossbow? Never mind.

28:06.620 --> 28:08.620
You could fire it at the elf.

28:10.620 --> 28:12.620
You could shoot.

28:12.620 --> 28:14.620
Yeah, they'd have arrows.

28:22.620 --> 28:24.620
His dad actually got a new wife.

28:24.620 --> 28:27.620
And this is just, like, the most convoluted possible story.

28:27.620 --> 28:29.620
I turned into a star, son.

28:29.620 --> 28:31.620
Is that the way elves go out for cigarettes?

28:31.620 --> 28:32.620
Yes.

28:32.620 --> 28:34.620
They are still the best part of this show.

28:34.620 --> 28:36.620
Yeah, but not by much.

28:36.620 --> 28:38.620
I do like their dynamic a lot.

28:38.620 --> 28:40.620
Nice castle, bro.

28:40.620 --> 28:44.620
Wait, this was the elves' garrison, this is their tower.

28:44.620 --> 28:46.620
Shouldn't it look nicer than this?

28:47.620 --> 28:48.620
Nope.

28:48.620 --> 28:51.620
No, listen, they didn't have time to maintain it,

28:51.620 --> 28:53.620
as they were so busy, uh,

28:53.620 --> 28:56.620
staring off into the middle distance and seducing village women.

28:57.620 --> 29:01.620
Man, I wish you elves had taken better care of this fucking fortress.

29:02.620 --> 29:03.620
What kind of shit?

29:03.620 --> 29:05.620
That would have been handy right about now.

29:05.620 --> 29:07.620
It's not gonna really defend us, actually.

29:07.620 --> 29:09.620
I think it's gonna fall over.

29:11.620 --> 29:13.620
Oh, Jesus.

29:23.620 --> 29:25.620
The sword is the ring.

29:25.620 --> 29:26.620
Yay.

29:26.620 --> 29:28.620
It is Sauron.

29:28.620 --> 29:30.620
Mauler is wrong.

29:30.620 --> 29:32.620
What did Mauler say?

29:32.620 --> 29:36.620
Mauler said that that was Gandalf, not Sauron, the stranger.

29:36.620 --> 29:40.620
It's pretty obvious from the way that he killed the fireflies that he was, like...

29:40.620 --> 29:41.620
Mm-hmm.

29:41.620 --> 29:42.620
Oh, wait a minute.

29:42.620 --> 29:44.620
Was he like...

29:44.620 --> 29:46.620
Was Adar controlling that human?

29:46.620 --> 29:48.620
But I think he would be like, after that, be like,

29:48.620 --> 29:50.620
What happened? My head hurts.

29:50.620 --> 29:53.620
We do know that sorcerers have the ability to do that.

29:53.620 --> 29:54.620
Like with Theoden.

29:54.620 --> 29:56.620
To at least influence people.

29:57.620 --> 29:59.620
Wait, this is the whole ship, is it?

30:00.620 --> 30:02.620
We're gonna battle in the middle of this.

30:02.620 --> 30:05.620
No, I assume it's gonna take her to a bigger boat.

30:05.620 --> 30:07.620
Wanna just row back to the mainland?

30:08.620 --> 30:10.620
It's what you deserve, elf.

30:10.620 --> 30:12.620
They're just like, No, swim.

30:12.620 --> 30:14.620
Just keep swimming. You can make it, right?

30:14.620 --> 30:18.620
Like all elves, she prefers to stand in the fucking mountains.

30:19.620 --> 30:21.620
Decemberism.

30:23.620 --> 30:26.620
They gotta get punished for their racism.

30:26.620 --> 30:28.620
I made the wrong decision.

30:30.620 --> 30:32.620
We can just order them to stop still.

30:33.620 --> 30:34.620
Yeah.

30:34.620 --> 30:36.620
Rade, just come back!

30:36.620 --> 30:39.620
She calls her back, and then the tree just immediately stops shedding.

30:39.620 --> 30:41.620
It's like, okay, good.

30:42.620 --> 30:43.620
Wait a minute.

30:44.620 --> 30:47.620
So, they just change their mind after seeing that, I guess?

30:47.620 --> 30:48.620
Actually?

30:49.620 --> 30:50.620
Yep.

30:50.620 --> 30:53.620
Well, I guess that's the most reasonable thing to do, actually.

30:53.620 --> 30:54.620
Yeah?

30:54.620 --> 30:55.620
Yeah.

30:55.620 --> 30:57.620
I didn't see that coming.

30:57.620 --> 30:59.620
And they're travelling to the Southlands.

30:59.620 --> 31:01.620
Whom they apparently know is under threat.

31:01.620 --> 31:02.620
I will serve.

31:03.620 --> 31:05.620
I know that because of the map thing.

31:07.620 --> 31:09.620
Are they seagulling, March?

31:09.620 --> 31:10.620
Oh my god!

31:11.620 --> 31:12.620
Hard up!

31:13.620 --> 31:15.620
Cancelled. Cancelled.

31:16.620 --> 31:17.620
Aces.

31:18.620 --> 31:20.620
I was in a sudden turn for the darkness.

31:21.620 --> 31:23.620
Hold on, his rings of power are based?

31:26.620 --> 31:27.620
Well, there we go.

31:27.620 --> 31:28.620
Yeah.

31:28.620 --> 31:31.620
The plot suddenly sped up massively.

31:31.620 --> 31:33.620
A lot of skipping.

31:33.620 --> 31:37.620
I mean, at least interesting things are happening, but a lot of skipping.

31:38.620 --> 31:41.620
It's become a show, and not just a train wreck.

31:41.620 --> 31:44.620
I feel like it's probably too little too late, but...

31:44.620 --> 31:49.620
The biggest problem is, it feels like I'm reading the script right now.

31:51.620 --> 31:54.620
And it obviously has nothing to do with the actual Lord of the Rings.

31:54.620 --> 31:56.620
So the trees start shedding, and she goes like,

31:56.620 --> 31:59.620
Ah, this is what my daddy told me about! Jesus!

31:59.620 --> 32:00.620
Yeah, so I was like...

32:00.620 --> 32:02.620
Galadriel too has completely changed the tune.

32:02.620 --> 32:04.620
It's no longer looking for Sauron.

32:04.620 --> 32:05.620
He's not a potential threat.

32:05.620 --> 32:06.620
No, no, no.

32:06.620 --> 32:08.620
He's attacking the Southlands.

32:08.620 --> 32:09.620
Alright.

32:09.620 --> 32:10.620
Because, why?

32:10.620 --> 32:12.620
Because you looked at the map and went like,

32:12.620 --> 32:14.620
Huh, scribbles kind of look like that.

32:14.620 --> 32:15.620
Basically...

32:15.620 --> 32:17.620
There's a seagull that's...

32:17.620 --> 32:20.620
And she has no reason to believe that there's an army there.

32:20.620 --> 32:22.620
She thinks that maybe the orcs are moving there.

32:22.620 --> 32:24.620
That Sauron might have a base there.

32:24.620 --> 32:26.620
As far as she knows, it's simply a waypoint.

32:26.620 --> 32:27.620
But no, it's like,

32:27.620 --> 32:29.620
Ah, they're under siege.

32:29.620 --> 32:30.620
They're under siege?

32:30.620 --> 32:32.620
I'm the king of the Southlands, by the way.

32:32.620 --> 32:34.620
I found him on the sea.

32:34.620 --> 32:37.620
They do know that because of the character they found on the sea.

32:37.620 --> 32:40.620
Because he tells her that they're under siege, and they're under attack.

32:40.620 --> 32:41.620
And that they're being killed.

32:41.620 --> 32:43.620
So it's all just based on his say-so, I guess?

32:43.620 --> 32:45.620
Because he was there.

32:45.620 --> 32:46.620
No, he wasn't.

32:46.620 --> 32:47.620
Yeah, he was.

32:47.620 --> 32:49.620
He said that he was driven from the lands.

32:49.620 --> 32:51.620
No, he was talking about enemies and courses.

32:52.620 --> 32:55.620
Like, the orcs haven't started attacking until recently.

32:55.620 --> 32:57.620
Like, Black Elf literally was saying,

32:57.620 --> 33:00.620
Like, oh gosh, I haven't seen shit for 70 years.

33:00.620 --> 33:03.620
I could have sworn the dude at the sea, whatever his name is,

33:03.620 --> 33:07.620
Said that they were under attack, and people were being pushed out of their land.

33:07.620 --> 33:10.620
What if this is all part of his ploy?

33:10.620 --> 33:14.620
What they'll do is they'll move all of the forces off of the island,

33:14.620 --> 33:16.620
And then something bad will happen on the island.

33:16.620 --> 33:18.620
See...

33:18.620 --> 33:21.620
Judging by the story, as I know...

33:23.620 --> 33:25.620
Arch?

33:25.620 --> 33:26.620
Arch?

33:26.620 --> 33:28.620
Arch has been judged.

33:28.620 --> 33:30.620
Oh no.

33:30.620 --> 33:31.620
Basil's down.

33:31.620 --> 33:34.620
Oh, you know what I will say then, while we wait for Arch to return?

33:34.620 --> 33:35.620
I'll say this.

33:35.620 --> 33:37.620
No Harfoots this time.

33:37.620 --> 33:39.620
You know what? I'm happy for that.

33:39.620 --> 33:41.620
You're okay with that?

33:41.620 --> 33:47.620
Instead of, like, awful Harfoot scenes, we got less awful dwarf scenes.

33:47.620 --> 33:51.620
Just means we're gonna see lots of Harfoots next episode, probably.

33:51.620 --> 33:53.620
Oh god. Yeah, we are.

33:53.620 --> 33:55.620
Oh no, Arch dropped out!

33:55.620 --> 33:59.620
Kibs, usually you record your thing after we've done this, right?

33:59.620 --> 34:01.620
Mm-hmm.

34:01.620 --> 34:03.620
Arch is gonna be gone.

34:03.620 --> 34:04.620
Yeah.

34:04.620 --> 34:06.620
Oh shit, what are you guys gonna do?

34:06.620 --> 34:10.620
Well, we'll have to wait and see if he wakes up,

34:10.620 --> 34:12.620
And if he doesn't, then I have to go to bed.

34:12.620 --> 34:14.620
Then we do it tomorrow.

34:14.620 --> 34:16.620
Oh no!

34:17.620 --> 34:22.620
He might be back, because what he has to do is he goes out and resets his internet thingy.

34:22.620 --> 34:25.620
Wait, he goes out? He goes outside?

34:25.620 --> 34:27.620
It's in a separate building, apparently.

34:27.620 --> 34:28.620
Oh Jesus, okay.

34:28.620 --> 34:31.620
Well, in terms of the dwarven stuff, it was actually pretty good.

34:31.620 --> 34:34.620
That story is a story that's very character-driven, right?

34:34.620 --> 34:41.620
It's about the relationship between the dwarf prince and his wife, and Elrond, and...

34:41.620 --> 34:44.620
There's a fun little thing going on there, and I'm enjoying it.

34:44.620 --> 34:46.620
And now they added the king into the mix?

34:46.620 --> 34:50.620
There's a bunch of character moments in there that are pretty satisfying.

34:50.620 --> 34:51.620
Yes.

34:51.620 --> 34:54.620
It's sort of like a touchback to Legolas and Gimli.

34:54.620 --> 34:55.620
Welcome back.

34:55.620 --> 34:57.620
Hi, welcome back.

34:57.620 --> 34:59.620
I'm gonna call it right now.

34:59.620 --> 35:02.620
Theo is Halbrand.

35:03.620 --> 35:05.620
What makes you think that?

35:05.620 --> 35:10.620
Because of the weird disjointed nature of all of this.

35:10.620 --> 35:12.620
Okay, as you mentioned, right?

35:12.620 --> 35:14.620
Halbrand has been driven from his home.

35:14.620 --> 35:19.620
Now, I'm pretty sure he mentions corsairs, but he might have just mentioned enemies,

35:19.620 --> 35:23.620
which I remember commenting on because it didn't make sense because, like, the world's at peace.

35:23.620 --> 35:25.620
What fucking enemies?

35:25.620 --> 35:32.620
But at the same time, Black Elf has been specifically placed in the Southlands to look for signs of the enemy.

35:32.620 --> 35:38.620
They haven't seen shit for 70 years, and only now are there vague hints with the cows going mad.

35:38.620 --> 35:45.620
So, there's no indication or reason to suggest that the Orcs were widespread or obvious,

35:45.620 --> 35:47.620
so they couldn't have been attacking them.

35:47.620 --> 35:49.620
So what drove them from their lands?

35:49.620 --> 35:52.620
Well, maybe that was a different timeline.

35:52.620 --> 35:56.620
Like, I'm really starting to lean towards the different timeline interpretation.

35:56.620 --> 36:01.620
Yeah, so it's like what the Witcher did, basically, with everything happening at different times.

36:01.620 --> 36:07.620
So, you think that the young kid, who has, like, the hilt of Sauron or whatever,

36:07.620 --> 36:10.620
he's going to end up being Halbrand as an adult?

36:10.620 --> 36:15.620
Perhaps. I don't have much basis for that, mind you. It's just a wild theory.

36:15.620 --> 36:16.620
I mean, it could have...

36:16.620 --> 36:18.620
He should have darker skin, if so.

36:18.620 --> 36:19.620
It kind of feels...

36:19.620 --> 36:22.620
Because I remember what shows it is. It's true.

36:22.620 --> 36:28.620
You know what? That actually kind of feels right because the Black Elf story,

36:28.620 --> 36:31.620
he's kind of, like, disjointed from everything else, you know?

36:31.620 --> 36:35.620
Because we know that Galadriel's story is happening at the same time as Elrond's because they met up.

36:35.620 --> 36:37.620
So, that's happening at the same time.

36:37.620 --> 36:43.620
However, we also know that the Harfoot story is happening at the same time as the Black Elf story

36:43.620 --> 36:47.620
because the guy just mentioned three weeks ago there was that meteor.

36:47.620 --> 36:52.620
So, maybe this story is happening at two different time frames.

36:52.620 --> 36:56.620
And, interestingly, nobody else is mentioning the meteor.

36:56.620 --> 36:59.620
Like, Galadriel hasn't seen it. The new Noryns haven't seen it.

36:59.620 --> 37:02.620
Now, maybe you could argue geography, but...

37:02.620 --> 37:04.620
Yeah.

37:04.620 --> 37:05.620
No, this makes sense.

37:05.620 --> 37:08.620
Especially, yeah, because the kid gets corrupted with the Sauron Blade

37:08.620 --> 37:12.620
and then he ends up somehow being the king.

37:12.620 --> 37:14.620
Or maybe, who knows?

37:14.620 --> 37:17.620
And then is found on the sea as an adult.

37:17.620 --> 37:22.620
And he's already pretty Sauron-like as an adult.

37:23.620 --> 37:26.620
It depends on whether he goes with the elves or stays.

37:26.620 --> 37:31.620
Because what's going to happen now is that in the absence of the progressive woman queen,

37:31.620 --> 37:34.620
whoever stays behind, be it Farazhon or Halibrand,

37:34.620 --> 37:40.620
they're going to start properly corrupting people and Numenor is going to fall while she's away.

37:40.620 --> 37:45.620
Because, obviously, she can't make a mistake. That'd be silly.

37:45.620 --> 37:53.620
It's because of her absence that they're corrupted into believing that the elves are holding out in Valar.

37:53.620 --> 37:55.620
They're prevented from having immortality.

37:56.620 --> 38:01.620
Yes, then they'll return briefly. They'll get a few survivors, maybe, and then escape.

38:01.620 --> 38:05.620
Or maybe this is the escape and then the island will just sink off-screen somewhere.

38:05.620 --> 38:08.620
Everybody died and the people that made it come back are like,

38:08.620 --> 38:11.620
Why is there just ocean everywhere?

38:11.620 --> 38:16.620
Oh god, can you imagine? They used all the CG for the dream and they don't even show it in real life.

38:16.620 --> 38:19.620
Oh, well, I mean, they did show it technically.

38:19.620 --> 38:21.620
Don't worry, let's recycle the scenes even.

38:21.620 --> 38:23.620
Oh god.

38:23.620 --> 38:26.620
It was expensive, dammit.

38:28.620 --> 38:35.620
The show is picking up. There's things happening and there's some enjoyable parts. It's not great.

38:35.620 --> 38:38.620
But I still think House of the Dragons is better.

38:38.620 --> 38:44.620
But, I mean, at least I'm not bored to fucking tears like I was to the first two hours of it, you know?

38:44.620 --> 38:48.620
My opinion is actually this is more interesting than the previous episode of House of the Dragons.

38:48.620 --> 38:53.620
Most of the stuff was actually happening and some of the character interactions were actually tolerable.

38:53.620 --> 38:56.620
Specifically, Elrond and the Dwarf.

38:56.620 --> 38:58.620
Yes, they remain the best part of the show.

38:58.620 --> 39:03.620
They are the only part I enjoy. The show also has an enormous problem.

39:03.620 --> 39:07.620
Now that the imagery is Adan, Adan actually does a pretty good job.

39:07.620 --> 39:13.620
He is displaying actual emotions. He still tries too hard to be poetic.

39:13.620 --> 39:16.620
You can see the script is still fucking struggling.

39:16.620 --> 39:18.620
But he delivers it better than most.

39:18.620 --> 39:24.620
And when he then acts opposite Mr. Puerto Rican who has one fucking facial expression.

39:24.620 --> 39:26.620
Yep, it's like Galadriel ass.

39:26.620 --> 39:28.620
It really hammers it home, isn't it?

39:28.620 --> 39:32.620
It's like, wow, you have an actor and then you have this dude who's a model.

39:32.620 --> 39:37.620
Yep, there's some really good talent here being wasted, which is tragic.

39:37.620 --> 39:40.620
And it's being wasted because of the diversity hires.

39:40.620 --> 39:47.620
Elrond is passable due to his chemistry with Durin, but Elrond himself is not very interesting.

39:47.620 --> 39:51.620
He doesn't look like Elrond. He doesn't carry himself like Elrond.

39:51.620 --> 39:56.620
At this point, though, I'm kind of a bit past worrying about the lore of it because you already know the lore is just...

39:56.620 --> 39:57.620
It's already raped.

39:57.620 --> 40:00.620
The Rufi has already run its course on the lore of the show.

40:00.620 --> 40:02.620
It's basically irredeemable, you know?

40:02.620 --> 40:03.620
Yeah.

40:03.620 --> 40:09.620
But if we're going to forget about the lore and just talk about the quality of the show itself, it is at least improving.

40:09.620 --> 40:13.620
Just give Helbren more screen time and I'll be happy.

40:13.620 --> 40:17.620
Wait, hold on. Do you just have the hot spring or what?

40:17.620 --> 40:20.620
I just like his character. And maybe...

40:20.620 --> 40:22.620
Jesus.

40:22.620 --> 40:26.620
Maybe Helbren talking some sense into Galadriel.

40:26.620 --> 40:27.620
I assume this is a...

40:27.620 --> 40:30.620
God damn it. That so badly should not...

40:30.620 --> 40:36.620
She is already thousands of years old. She's already an accomplished diplomat.

40:36.620 --> 40:39.620
And here he is like, bitch!

40:39.620 --> 40:49.620
All he's saying is, don't fuck it up. You come into her house, you're rude as shit, and now you're surprised people are...

40:49.620 --> 40:52.620
And now you're surprised you're in a cellar for sedition.

40:52.620 --> 41:00.620
You're supposed to be a guest. You're supposed to be like a representative of the elves for the first time in how many years for these people?

41:00.620 --> 41:01.620
Yeah, hang on.

41:02.620 --> 41:06.620
And she's acting like the most insufferable, bastard-y, badgenable.

41:06.620 --> 41:09.620
And then she's like, why are they jailing me? I don't understand.

41:09.620 --> 41:12.620
And he goes like, why did they jail you, though?

41:12.620 --> 41:15.620
Oh.

41:15.620 --> 41:18.620
Hmm. Maybe I shouldn't have been on their floor.

41:18.620 --> 41:28.620
You know, there's like a decent comedy skit here where you could have like Helbren just in jail, watching Galadriel get released and then put back in multiple times to go back again, eh?

41:28.620 --> 41:29.620
Alright.

41:29.620 --> 41:38.620
You know what? I do like the fact that they're focusing the story a little more and leaving the hardfoot stuff behind for this one.

41:38.620 --> 41:45.620
Oh, god. You mention it, and suddenly I realize we didn't see those disgusting things all episode.

41:45.620 --> 41:49.620
Which means next episode's gonna be all about them.

41:49.620 --> 41:58.620
Don't you wanna know about their star signs and their culture and how they move and leave behind people?

41:58.620 --> 42:01.620
Just a fucking rot?

42:01.620 --> 42:04.620
Yeah, we talked about the hardfoots while you were gone, Arch.

42:04.620 --> 42:09.620
We don't like you, sir. You're going all the way to the back.

42:09.620 --> 42:11.620
Yep, back of the bus.

42:11.620 --> 42:15.620
And that's why the episode felt better. No hardfoots.

42:15.620 --> 42:21.620
Yeah, Arch, to be fair, we already talked about the hardfoots. You were left behind because you were offline at the moment.

42:21.620 --> 42:26.620
Okay, so I think that might be it. At least for this video.

42:26.620 --> 42:30.620
Welcome back next week and do some more, unfortunately.

42:30.620 --> 42:32.620
Yep, more grinding.

42:32.620 --> 42:34.620
We'll do it again.

42:34.620 --> 42:40.620
We'll do it. I like how, Arch, you've been like, for like three years, you've been like, Dev, let me on your channel.

42:40.620 --> 42:43.620
And this is what we're doing.

42:43.620 --> 42:45.620
This was my thanks.
