1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,760
I received an Amazon package today, as you sometimes do, and I noticed that the packing

2
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:15,800
tape was Lord of the Rings, Rings of Power packing tape wrapped around the box.

3
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:17,800
That's not a good sign, Des.

4
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:20,140
And I'm just like, oh Jesus, so hold on.

5
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:22,280
Every package Amazon's sending out.

6
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:25,740
Because Naomi and I went for a walk today and we saw like packages and like other porches

7
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:26,740
and stuff.

8
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:29,540
And I'm not a porch pirate, but I kind of went up because like during the day everyone's

9
00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:32,100
out to work and I'm a lazy YouTuber sitting at home.

10
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:34,020
So you know, the suburbs are emptied of people.

11
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:37,940
So I walk up onto this porch of somebody else's house and I just look and it's like here's

12
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:41,500
Amazon package and it has Rings of Power tape and then here's another one with Rings of

13
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:42,500
Power tape.

14
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:43,500
And I'm just like...

15
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:48,540
Imagine being an OHE making $15.50 and just like your upper up just comes up, okay, now

16
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:54,820
you gotta use this packing tape and just endless Lord of the Rings, Lord of the Rings, Lord

17
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:55,820
of the Rings.

18
00:00:55,820 --> 00:01:00,020
I can't think of any other Prime Video show that's done this, where they've just converted

19
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:02,340
all the Amazon boxes to advertise for it.

20
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:06,300
I think they did one time before, but I can't remember what it was for.

21
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:10,780
I remember seeing some advertisement stickers for something on the like the little duct

22
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:11,780
tape they use.

23
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:12,780
Normally they advertise...

24
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:15,300
This is also, this is their big thing.

25
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:16,860
This is the big thing.

26
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:21,200
If this fails, they've basically said that Amazon Studios fails, which is why they've

27
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:24,620
also basically said that they'll do anything to make it succeed.

28
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:28,100
I don't know if you saw, but there's been two claims I've seen.

29
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:34,480
One suggested that it had like 1.8 million actual views, but not tracking all devices.

30
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:38,700
And then Amazon claims that they got 28 million views.

31
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:42,900
That's one hell of a discrepancy and if you look at the reviews themselves, last time

32
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:45,820
I checked, I think there was like 10, 12, 13,000?

33
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:48,220
Hold on, Kibbs, you have it up.

34
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:49,780
What does it say on yours?

35
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:52,420
It was like 3.3 or something like that.

36
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:53,420
Here, hold on.

37
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:58,620
The Amazon rating is currently at 3.3 out of 5.

38
00:01:58,620 --> 00:01:59,620
Yeah.

39
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:01,900
And that's out of 13,000 global ratings.

40
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:08,960
So 25 million views, 13,000 people bothered to give it a rating.

41
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:09,960
I don't know.

42
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:14,600
There should probably be more reviews than that, but it kind of feels like, this is just

43
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:18,700
me being a conspiracy brain here, but it kind of feels like they're only letting through

44
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:25,660
enough reviews, like approving certain reviews, just to keep the number like above three.

45
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:26,660
Probably.

46
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:32,980
I will say on IMDb, the reverse review bombing campaign has, well, it has been gaining ground

47
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:37,580
over the negative reviews, which is why I keep saying people need to review it.

48
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:43,200
It's at 6.9 now and this is a genuine cultural battleground.

49
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,660
And here's the reason why we know that.

50
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:51,820
I don't know if you three have seen this article published by somebody named Stephen Colbert.

51
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:53,260
It's just a coincidence.

52
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:56,900
It's not Stephen Colbert, just a coincidence.

53
00:02:56,900 --> 00:03:03,460
This article is, the rings of power viewership numbers proves audience ratings are useless.

54
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:04,580
I did see that one.

55
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:08,700
I try to avoid the screen round whenever I can, but I didn't see that title.

56
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:09,700
Yeah.

57
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:10,700
Already bracing it.

58
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:11,700
Yep.

59
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:16,260
This article, it's promoting, first of all, it's promoting She-Hulk and it's promoting

60
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:21,260
House of the Dragon and it's promoting the 25 million viewers watching rings of power.

61
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:27,260
And it's saying basically that all of the places where, where viewers can put in their

62
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:33,500
own reviews, Rotten Tomatoes, IMDb, Amazon itself, it's all just being review bombed

63
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:35,260
and the reviews don't matter.

64
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:39,300
Obviously from their perspective, this is the first step in trying to get rid of reviews

65
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:42,060
because this is an obvious signal to people.

66
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:45,860
That's why I keep saying we do need to review it because the norm is just look at the rating.

67
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:50,380
If there wasn't a rating, the only narrative around rings of power was that anyone who

68
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:54,420
hates it is a racist and that Amazon had 25 million viewers.

69
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:58,060
There's also, I've seen varying usage of language.

70
00:03:58,060 --> 00:04:04,180
Like I've seen, for example, they say 25 million or 28 million viewers, not views, which makes

71
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:10,420
me think like, okay, were there just 25 million people logged into prime at that time?

72
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:14,300
Or maybe they're, they're like estimating like, oh, well on average, one person's watching

73
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:15,300
it with someone else.

74
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:16,300
So that's two viewers.

75
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:19,340
If there's one click, I guess the last thing to talk about too, before we get into the

76
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:25,900
video real quick is what they're using to defend what exactly what's happening, a statement

77
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:31,260
issued by prime video and the cast of the show just straight up said middle earth is

78
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:38,860
not all white and they refuse to ignore or tolerate harassment and abuse from fans directed

79
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:40,500
at performers of color.

80
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,180
They're correct.

81
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:46,580
Middle earth is not all white, but they chose to place their story in the place where there

82
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:48,540
are nothing but white people.

83
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:55,100
So they came out and said that Tolkien created a world which by definition is multicultural,

84
00:04:55,100 --> 00:05:01,100
a world in which free peoples from different races and cultures joined together in a fellowship

85
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:03,140
to defeat the forces of evil.

86
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:06,620
Our world has never been all white, fantasy has never been all white and middle earth

87
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:08,820
is not all white.

88
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:14,860
So I'm just like, that's interesting because that's not canon because the fellowship fails.

89
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:15,860
That's true.

90
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:16,860
The fellowship does fail.

91
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:20,480
So, so they're multiracial, multiethnic, you know, Alliance falls apart.

92
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:21,480
That's true.

93
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:24,940
At the same time though, you know, the fact that you had Aragorn and Gimli and Legolas

94
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:27,660
altogether, that was kind of a unique situation in the lore.

95
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:29,460
So I get, I get, I get their point.

96
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:30,460
Fair enough.

97
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:37,680
That's my point for that, but the overall, you know, story and lore and setting of Lord

98
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:42,400
of the Rings is that, yeah, it is a multicultural world, but all of these cultures, they kind

99
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:49,480
of have this desire to remain separate and not be brought under, let's say one, one banner,

100
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:55,300
one empire, one multiethnic empire, like Sauron's for example.

101
00:05:55,300 --> 00:06:00,580
The thing is too, the focus was never on the cultures or the race.

102
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:06,300
Like that is a, it is an irrelevancy because it is good versus evil, which is why the men

103
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:12,220
of the East are portrayed as evil because in the story, that's all they need.

104
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:15,580
Honestly, Lord of the Rings is kind of like a world full of ethnostates.

105
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:21,180
Uh, unironically, yes, and after the war ends, it kind of remains that way.

106
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:27,180
When they reformed the kingdom of Arnor and Gondor, when they combine, uh, King Aragorn

107
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:33,900
basically grants the Shire as a, a, uh, sovereign state within his new kingdom and also forbids

108
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:35,500
men from entering it.

109
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:39,220
It is actually unironically an ethnostate.

110
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:44,700
So wait, does that mean that we can't go down there and get any, any hubbitusi?

111
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:46,840
Basically, yeah.

112
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:48,780
And the problem is always remains also though.

113
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:49,780
Okay.

114
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:50,780
All right.

115
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:51,780
Sure.

116
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:52,780
Absolutely.

117
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:53,780
And it was never all one.

118
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:54,780
All right.

119
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:55,780
Fine as well.

120
00:06:55,780 --> 00:07:00,060
Uh, why didn't you place your story there then like, why aren't you telling the tale

121
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:01,060
of the Haradrin?

122
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:03,640
Uh, some of them might've been resisting Sauron.

123
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:04,860
You can make this shit up.

124
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:10,020
You own the rights to it now or in, um, Cund or in Uruun.

125
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:11,860
Why isn't there any of the story placed there?

126
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:12,860
Oh, that's right.

127
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:14,220
Because nobody fucking cares.

128
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:15,540
That's the hard truth.

129
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:20,700
And making us care is as the rings of power has demonstrated well beyond the capabilities

130
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:22,500
of the current show it on us.

131
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:23,500
Okay.

132
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:25,780
I think it's time for us to Jesus Christ.

133
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:27,980
Look at the episodes are getting longer.

134
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:31,860
One hour, five, one hour, seven, one hour, an hour, 11 minutes.

135
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:38,020
Holy shit guys finale will be two hours at some point.

136
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:45,420
Sorry arch, you know, why don't you just let's procrastinate, arch, why don't you just sleep

137
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:47,300
and get up at like five or something?

138
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:51,500
Here's me while I lean into my microphone here just for a second.

139
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:56,940
Oh God, let me just take my headphones out.

140
00:07:56,940 --> 00:08:00,940
Because that'll really fuck up my sleep schedule, Dev.

141
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:04,100
It was still loud even with the mom.

142
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:08,220
Wait, what's your normal sleep schedule?

143
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:09,220
Not good.

144
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:10,740
And this looked like it was.

145
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:13,660
Meanwhile, Lilith, you sleep for about 18 hours a day.

146
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:14,660
Oh my God.

147
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:15,660
That's not true.

148
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:20,620
I sleep 20 hours a day.

149
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:26,100
Lord of the Rings, the Rings of Power, episode four.

150
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:27,660
What's the title, Gibbs?

151
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:28,660
The Great Wave.

152
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:29,660
The Great Wave.

153
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:30,660
Okay.

154
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:31,660
That's the plan.

155
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:32,660
Maybe someone will drown.

156
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:33,660
That'd be funny.

157
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:36,500
Maybe it'll be me.

158
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:37,500
Oh God, a gun.

159
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:38,500
I wish I had one.

160
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:39,500
Marshalls.

161
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:40,500
Wham.

162
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:43,940
I tried to watch that show there, by the way.

163
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:45,700
She was like, oh, action show.

164
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:46,700
That's cool.

165
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:47,700
It's just porn for women.

166
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:52,660
And I was sitting there like, I realized that this is what this is.

167
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:53,660
Oh my God.

168
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:55,380
They're just undressed men all the time.

169
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:56,380
Yes.

170
00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:58,980
How come we don't get that for men?

171
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:01,820
Well, that's because we're misogynists.

172
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:04,900
But unfortunately I showed my mother the first episode and she said, this is a very good

173
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:05,900
TV show.

174
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:06,900
I was like, mm-hmm.

175
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:07,900
I guess.

176
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:14,460
God, I hate that fucking plot twist so much, by the way.

177
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:16,460
Should I get your map?

178
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:17,460
Just a map of Mordor.

179
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:18,460
Where?

180
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:20,940
A fucking orc can figure it out, but a Galadriel's like, huh.

181
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:25,420
The cliche with like, uh, people don't know what's going on with the math board until

182
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:27,500
some random woman scribbles it.

183
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:28,500
Yeah.

184
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:29,500
It's upside down.

185
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:30,500
Oh, shoot.

186
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:31,500
Oh.

187
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,140
Whoops the board upside down.

188
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:34,140
All right.

189
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:35,540
We can skip this this time.

190
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:36,540
Fuck it.

191
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:37,540
Let's get through it.

192
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:39,180
Watch it.

193
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:40,180
Like the fucking button.

194
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:41,180
Are you positive?

195
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:45,980
Like the fucking devs needs to be tortured with the interim.

196
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:48,260
Oh, they don't need to skip parts of it.

197
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:50,380
Yeah, we still got it.

198
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:51,380
We had to see the big name.

199
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:53,180
That way it's burned into a redness.

200
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:55,180
Hey, look, it's Minas Tiras.

201
00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:57,300
Wait, are they doing that?

202
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:58,300
Yeah.

203
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:00,300
Didn't you see the, the house outstretched?

204
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:01,300
Yeah.

205
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:02,300
Yeah.

206
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:05,020
Are they, are they saying this is like, no, it's not the same place, but like the same

207
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:07,020
architecture, I guess.

208
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:10,820
This is literally for the foreigner.

209
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:11,820
It's too bad.

210
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:12,820
There wasn't an R in that name.

211
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:13,820
She could have rolled it.

212
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:15,620
I think my nose broke from the symbolism again.

213
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:18,620
Oh no, the island's going to sink.

214
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:19,620
Yeah.

215
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:23,340
And in case you were wondering, this is going to be a dream sequence, isn't it?

216
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:25,220
It's going to be like a premonition to the future.

217
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:28,860
She's going to wake up and like, Oh my God, my island's collapsing.

218
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:36,420
This fall of Númenor, this will be a sudden escalation if it wasn't.

219
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:38,820
Now that tower wasn't actually touched by anything.

220
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:41,700
So that just, that was just, you know, shoddy building.

221
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:43,700
That is a massive ass bed.

222
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:45,020
For one person to sleep on.

223
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:46,020
Yeah.

224
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:47,020
She wasn't even sleeping on it.

225
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:50,180
She's on a chair and she's fully dressed.

226
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:54,980
I had a comment on one of my videos basically saying, wouldn't it be amazing if Númenor

227
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:57,540
was just filled with chads and stacies, et cetera.

228
00:10:57,540 --> 00:11:03,380
And yes, it would like like a chance in Amazon's, I think just lots of beautiful, massive, muscular

229
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:04,380
people.

230
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:07,500
Cause these are supposed to be a superior race to humans.

231
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:11,500
Like it should literally be filled with just massive ass Hercules dudes.

232
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:14,340
They're long lived, very, you know, healthy.

233
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:17,260
Aren't they like humans though, but like better humans?

234
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:18,260
They were.

235
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:19,260
Yeah.

236
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:20,780
These people are what we would call Arians.

237
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:26,340
Which is a bit cruel, dear, but yes, that is theoretically correct.

238
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:32,620
Hey, listen, nothing wrong with loving elves.

239
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:40,820
The only thing they're good for.

240
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:43,820
You tell them, Karl Marx.

241
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:50,340
Oh no, I think I got a little book for you.

242
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:53,340
I think he's the bad guy.

243
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:56,860
Bad guy always says, trust me.

244
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:59,340
Wait, from where?

245
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:03,180
Oh, they're just going to bring them out from somewhere?

246
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:04,180
Magic.

247
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:14,300
Here's the thing, whenever I, at this point, whenever I see a character like this in a

248
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:16,820
modern show, I always wonder like, are they going to do a Trump?

249
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:18,820
Are they going to make him like a Trump style guy?

250
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:21,980
He's at a podium and like rallying up a crowd.

251
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:23,980
Make Númenor great again.

252
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:42,060
And they got away, both of them.

253
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:43,060
I like that.

254
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:44,060
Okay.

255
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:54,780
You're not going to comment on the fact that everyone believes Sauron died like a couple

256
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:55,780
hundred years ago?

257
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:56,780
No?

258
00:12:56,780 --> 00:12:57,780
Okay.

259
00:12:57,780 --> 00:12:58,780
Nope.

260
00:12:58,780 --> 00:13:09,260
They're going to skip over the, I don't believe Sauron's back, part of the story.

261
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:18,020
Now you jumped off a boat and almost got eaten by a big fish.

262
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:19,020
Well, that didn't work out.

263
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:20,020
You're in jail.

264
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:21,020
You know what?

265
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:22,020
I don't mind that.

266
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:24,020
Like this is, this is okay.

267
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:25,020
Okay.

268
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:26,020
There's a few good things.

269
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:30,980
I think it's mildly funny, but at the same time, this is supposed to be Galadriel.

270
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:36,060
Like she isn't just an angry wench.

271
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:40,860
She has to show how empowered she is, Starch.

272
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:42,860
Are you a sexist?

273
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:43,860
Yes.

274
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:55,980
If I let go of this rope, the ASMR voice will whisper to me again.

275
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:56,980
Oops.

276
00:13:56,980 --> 00:13:57,980
Yeah.

277
00:13:57,980 --> 00:14:01,700
Haven't we seen this scene already?

278
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:08,740
I think he thought about it last time and he didn't do it.

279
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:09,740
That was deliberate.

280
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:10,740
Correct.

281
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:11,740
Beat him.

282
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:12,740
What?

283
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:13,740
All three of you.

284
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:14,740
What?

285
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:15,740
What?

286
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:16,740
What?

287
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:17,740
It's a bit cruel.

288
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:18,740
Bit extreme.

289
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:19,740
Oh, he's Batman.

290
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:20,740
Oh no.

291
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:21,740
I don't care about this guy.

292
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:22,740
God dammit.

293
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:23,740
Ah.

294
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:24,740
The white power auras again.

295
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:25,740
Was that supposed to be intimidating?

296
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:26,740
I thought that was funny.

297
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:41,260
He's like, I'm a elf orc, an orfk.

298
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:42,540
Some chubby ears there, my boy.

299
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:45,820
You should get that looked at.

300
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:46,820
Is it going to be force healing?

301
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:49,940
He's going to stab his neck.

302
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:50,940
Doubt it.

303
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:51,940
Mm-hmm.

304
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:55,140
Stabs deeper.

305
00:14:55,140 --> 00:15:03,140
I remember how much the Orcs cared about their own.

306
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:05,140
Yeah, they ate him.

307
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:16,940
Remember when they got up the head and were like, Meatwag on the menu.

308
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:17,940
I like this guy.

309
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:21,940
He's a better actor than the main characters so far.

310
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:23,940
Oh, Jesus.

311
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:25,940
Oh, well, well, again.

312
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:29,940
Thank God, Vargapug lived.

313
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:34,540
See, this actually kind of makes it worse because his performance is actually pretty

314
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:35,540
damn good here.

315
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:38,940
And then you've got portion of you can do it just half interestingly.

316
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:40,780
Where are you?

317
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:43,180
Like a monster or something?

318
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:46,620
The watchtower is perfectly intact.

319
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:49,620
By the humans.

320
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:56,620
So, I guess when the elves disengaged and left, they were just caught on the road.

321
00:15:56,620 --> 00:16:01,620
Yes, they just decided to leave without Black Elf.

322
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:05,620
Well, he wasn't worth much to them, was he?

323
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:08,620
Ah, five potatoes.

324
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:10,620
You didn't pack food?

325
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:14,620
Why did you not pack food?

326
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:20,620
You can kind of see his ears poking through the hair.

327
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:22,620
And they look kind of elven.

328
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:24,620
Yeah, that's a hidden thing.

329
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:28,620
I don't know how he would have been able to hide that for so long.

330
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:31,620
Just Justin Bieber hair for like ten years.

331
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:38,620
Well, they don't seem to be doing any efforts of sneaking or hiding or any subterfuge whatsoever,

332
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:40,620
so why wasn't this a good idea?

333
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:41,620
They show no fear whatsoever.

334
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:43,620
They just wandered in here.

335
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:45,620
Hey, one of them's showing fear.

336
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:46,620
The other guy's careless.

337
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:49,620
He feels like he has protagonist immunity.

338
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:53,620
He's got a magic sword, so he's going to use magic bullshit to be okay.

339
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:56,620
It feels like he's sneaking to the cookie jar.

340
00:16:56,620 --> 00:16:59,620
I just hate the fact that they didn't bring the food.

341
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:00,620
Like, why?

342
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:01,620
What possible reason?

343
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:02,620
They just left it there.

344
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:04,620
They were in a rush, okay?

345
00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:06,620
He's going to die.

346
00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:09,620
Other guy's going to run back with a cart full of food.

347
00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:11,620
Rowan might be in deep shit.

348
00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:17,620
The orcs aren't fucking movie monsters, Jesus Christ.

349
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:19,620
They're not stealthy.

350
00:17:20,620 --> 00:17:22,620
Are there anything but subtle?

351
00:17:22,620 --> 00:17:24,620
Hey, I can see his arm.

352
00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:28,620
That wasn't even scary.

353
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:31,620
He was just standing there.

354
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:34,620
He was waiting for the dramatic reveal.

355
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:42,620
You recognize that, don't you?

356
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:44,620
Excuse me.

357
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:45,620
Whoa!

358
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:49,620
Hey, when did you learn to do that?

359
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:51,620
He just stabbed himself with it.

360
00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:53,620
Just let it drop blood, I guess.

361
00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:55,620
Yeah, that was a bad idea, wasn't it?

362
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:59,620
If that's able to activate like a lightsaber just every time you stab yourself.

363
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:01,620
It's like a bad place to hide.

364
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:04,620
This is a pretty bad place to hide.

365
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:07,620
It's like Saddam Hussein's hidey hole.

366
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:10,620
His gamer cave.

367
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:12,620
Yeah.

368
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:15,620
Oh, that was grunted.

369
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:16,620
That's rare.

370
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:26,620
Were you expecting to stab to the bottom of the well or something?

371
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:31,620
No, that's loud, by the way.

372
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:32,620
Yeah, that.

373
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:35,620
Splash!

374
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:38,620
That goes up the fucking thing.

375
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:41,620
Is that the tower battle on their building there?

376
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:45,620
Oh, we skipped over the negotiation and the dwarves are just helping now.

377
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:47,620
They've been constructing for a few years now.

378
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:50,620
Well, it only takes them five minutes to get there, so it's not a big deal.

379
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:53,620
Dwarves are fast builders.

380
00:18:53,620 --> 00:18:57,620
They try too hard to sound poetic, don't they?

381
00:18:57,620 --> 00:18:58,620
They do.

382
00:18:58,620 --> 00:19:00,620
And they fail horribly.

383
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:07,620
You know, on my end, that kind of sounded like you saying, Arch, they try so hard to sound robotic.

384
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:09,620
You're back.

385
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:11,620
It really is a five minute walk.

386
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:12,620
Yep.

387
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:19,620
I feel like that's the edge of the set they built.

388
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:20,620
It is.

389
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:24,620
No fun allowed.

390
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:31,620
We're getting a bit of that House of Dragons problem here, where there are scenes that just appear and we're supposed to know things that have happened.

391
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:35,620
They're rushed to tell a story yet again.

392
00:19:35,620 --> 00:19:36,620
Yeah.

393
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:40,620
Did the dwarves forget the elves have great hearing, by the way?

394
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:43,620
Yes.

395
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:46,620
I was going to say, like, the elves have fantastic hearing.

396
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:52,620
Their face was...

397
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:55,620
Okay, that was very stupid, but funny.

398
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:57,620
How does that even work?

399
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:04,620
Why the hell?

400
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:07,620
So are they alluding to them digging up the balrog?

401
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:08,620
Yes.

402
00:20:08,620 --> 00:20:10,620
That's probably what they're heading for.

403
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:15,620
Now, we're going to do it in Spain is a while off in the story, but never fucking mind that.

404
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:17,620
They're just going to do it anyway.

405
00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:21,620
I mean, the show has already broken the lore, so...

406
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:22,620
You know what they'll do?

407
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:23,620
You know what they'll do?

408
00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:24,620
Okay.

409
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:25,620
What?

410
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:31,620
They're going to do a thing where Gandalf, someone's going to, either the stranger or whoever is going to be Gandalf,

411
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:34,620
and he's going to duel the balrog early.

412
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:38,620
We're going to Kenobi this shit, are we?

413
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:39,620
Yep.

414
00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:40,620
They're going to just...

415
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:43,620
They're going to do what they did with Darth Maul and just start making shit up.

416
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:48,620
Like, oh yeah, he's alive and, like, they've had this long history for, like, ever.

417
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:50,620
It's like, okay, so you just want to milk it.

418
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:51,620
Like, yes, basically.

419
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:54,620
For no reason other than fan service.

420
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:55,620
Yeah.

421
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:00,620
That was easy.

422
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:01,620
That was easy.

423
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:08,620
His, uh, his children have access to the secret password, as you would expect.

424
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:16,620
You don't recognize it.

425
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:17,620
I guess the elves don't know about it.

426
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:20,620
The elves most, uh, definitely do.

427
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:25,620
It won't even go to my brain.

428
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:28,620
He just, like, dunes them out as he tells them.

429
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:32,620
Uranium.

430
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:34,620
No.

431
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:39,620
It does feel like more times past than we know.

432
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:45,620
This feels like months, maybe even years since the last scene we saw with them.

433
00:21:45,620 --> 00:21:46,620
At the same time...

434
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:47,620
It does.

435
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:51,620
At the same time, the black elf, he has been in that orc camp for years.

436
00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:52,620
No way.

437
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:55,620
He's been there for five whole minutes.

438
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:02,620
What?

439
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:03,620
Four dwarves down there.

440
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:05,620
They haven't been on this island for years either.

441
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:07,620
Something weird is going on with the timeline.

442
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:11,620
I'm pretty sure this is different timelines spread apart by quite a bit.

443
00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:13,620
That's why there's going to be lots of sardons.

444
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:16,620
Or, it's terrible writing.

445
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:17,620
Alternatively.

446
00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:26,620
Well, I guess I've been smooth-talked.

447
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:29,620
Okay.

448
00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:33,620
No offense to that actor, but he's not good looking enough to make that line work.

449
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:34,620
Damn.

450
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:36,620
Dev's like, step aside, I got you.

451
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:46,620
She's gotta pee, but there's no pot.

452
00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:03,620
Durr, glad we aren't stupid.

453
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:13,620
You'll be deported.

454
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:16,620
They really are keeping immigrants in cages.

455
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:24,620
Well, that was easy.

456
00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:26,620
I'm convinced.

457
00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:28,620
Yeah, that's three armed men.

458
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:29,620
Yeah.

459
00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:30,620
Not much of a problem, really.

460
00:23:30,620 --> 00:23:31,620
Jesus.

461
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:32,620
Okay.

462
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:33,620
What the fuck?

463
00:23:35,620 --> 00:23:36,620
We've got a girl boss scene.

464
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:37,620
One down.

465
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:38,620
You know, many more to go.

466
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:39,620
Actually, two.

467
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:43,620
Hey, it was still a better fight scene than the one in Kenobi where the traitor woman

468
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:45,620
slapped the stormtrooper on the helmet.

469
00:23:45,620 --> 00:23:47,620
He just fell over?

470
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:48,620
Yep.

471
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:49,620
It was a powerful slap.

472
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:53,620
I wonder how she'll get out of the heavily guarded tower, though.

473
00:23:53,620 --> 00:23:55,620
Actually, I don't think about it.

474
00:23:55,620 --> 00:23:56,620
I know exactly how.

475
00:23:56,620 --> 00:23:58,620
Yes, by not thinking about it.

476
00:23:58,620 --> 00:24:01,620
Yeah, they'll just scene cut and she'll be somewhere else.

477
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:09,620
You climbed the entire fucking...

478
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:11,620
Of course you did.

479
00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:13,620
She was gonna swim across the ocean.

480
00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:19,620
Oh no, Santa.

481
00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:21,620
Not enough kids believe in Christmas anymore.

482
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:25,620
One last time, I'd like to test elf.

483
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:30,620
I would like some elf lucy.

484
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:33,620
This one was passed to my father.

485
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:35,620
And with it, a secret.

486
00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:38,620
The secret's called the song of ice and fire.

487
00:24:38,620 --> 00:24:40,620
Debbie made me cringe.

488
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:51,620
Aw, she didn't get the budget this time.

489
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:53,620
Only the water.

490
00:24:53,620 --> 00:24:56,620
CG's expensive, okay?

491
00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:02,620
Girlboss moment.

492
00:25:02,620 --> 00:25:06,620
Literally, the only people who know the plot are the women.

493
00:25:06,620 --> 00:25:08,620
Girlboss to girlboss.

494
00:25:08,620 --> 00:25:11,620
Listen, Muriel, we're passing the backyard test right now,

495
00:25:11,620 --> 00:25:13,620
so please stand with me.

496
00:25:17,620 --> 00:25:19,620
Alongside the elves?

497
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:21,620
Bitch, the elves don't like you.

498
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:23,620
They told you to go away.

499
00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:25,620
This puts you on a boat.

500
00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:27,620
Ah yes, Theo, come out during the night.

501
00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:30,620
The orcs are less active during the night, you see.

502
00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:33,620
The orcs are more active at night, yeah.

503
00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:35,620
And have greater strength at night. Oh no!

504
00:25:35,620 --> 00:25:38,620
You can see better, but you can see worse.

505
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:40,620
Perfect timing.

506
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:43,620
Don't worry, it'll only be applicable one way.

507
00:25:43,620 --> 00:25:45,620
Oh, still grabbing food.

508
00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:47,620
Alright, bit of a chat.

509
00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:49,620
Are they fucking one another?

510
00:25:51,620 --> 00:25:53,620
Oh no, they're randomly killing one another.

511
00:25:53,620 --> 00:25:56,620
I like that they established they couldn't smell him earlier,

512
00:25:56,620 --> 00:25:58,620
but now none of them could.

513
00:25:58,620 --> 00:26:01,620
See, the water is masking his scent.

514
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:04,620
This is literally a stealth scene from The Last of Us,

515
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:07,620
where you're just in a bit of grass.

516
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:10,620
Don't remind me of that goddamn king.

517
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:12,620
Thought we were gonna get a spooky scene.

518
00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:16,620
I like how he doesn't even try to go into the shadows.

519
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:18,620
Don't worry, we're safe.

520
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:20,620
Don't worry.

521
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:22,620
It's not black, is it?

522
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:24,620
Oh god damn it, it is! How?

523
00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:26,620
I can tell you why.

524
00:26:26,620 --> 00:26:29,620
Because they need the character arcs to merge.

525
00:26:29,620 --> 00:26:31,620
He escaped off camera.

526
00:26:31,620 --> 00:26:34,620
What's his name? Adar? Adel?

527
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:36,620
Yeah, Adar let him go.

528
00:26:36,620 --> 00:26:39,620
Fully armed, of course, not Irish.

529
00:26:39,620 --> 00:26:41,620
I mean, he might have let him go,

530
00:26:41,620 --> 00:26:43,620
but the other orcs might not know.

531
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:45,620
Okay, I'll take it they don't know.

532
00:26:45,620 --> 00:26:47,620
No they're not.

533
00:26:47,620 --> 00:26:49,620
They look so stupid, why are they white?

534
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:51,620
Why are you slowing down for him?

535
00:26:54,620 --> 00:26:56,620
Did you just kick him?

536
00:26:56,620 --> 00:26:58,620
He's like, my slide's broken!

537
00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:03,620
You kicked him so that you could catch an arrow that would otherwise have missed it.

538
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:05,620
He's kind of a dick, actually.

539
00:27:05,620 --> 00:27:07,620
Yes, yes he is.

540
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:09,620
I got a sickle!

541
00:27:12,620 --> 00:27:14,620
How did you know they were there?

542
00:27:14,620 --> 00:27:19,620
Should I run into, like, orcs shooting arrows on an off chance he's here?

543
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:24,620
360 no, Sko.

544
00:27:26,620 --> 00:27:31,620
And then the sun breaks through because night's really short in Middle-earth.

545
00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:33,620
Oh, my kangol!

546
00:27:33,620 --> 00:27:37,620
They're not black enough, I shall defeat them with my tights.

547
00:27:39,620 --> 00:27:41,620
The sun!

548
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:43,620
My god!

549
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:48,620
I know the orcs were chasing me in the sun earlier today when I was escaping from the quarry,

550
00:27:48,620 --> 00:27:50,620
but I'm pretty sure it'll repel them this time.

551
00:27:50,620 --> 00:27:52,620
What do you know?

552
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:54,620
Arch, is the sun rising outside right now?

553
00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:57,620
It's been rising for a while, actually, yeah.

554
00:27:57,620 --> 00:27:59,620
Oh, god.

555
00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:01,620
Don't go outside, you'll stink, you'll melt.

556
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:03,620
Also, you've got a...

557
00:28:03,620 --> 00:28:06,620
Is that a crossbow? How the hell did you get a crossbow? Never mind.

558
00:28:06,620 --> 00:28:08,620
You could fire it at the elf.

559
00:28:10,620 --> 00:28:12,620
You could shoot.

560
00:28:12,620 --> 00:28:14,620
Yeah, they'd have arrows.

561
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:24,620
His dad actually got a new wife.

562
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:27,620
And this is just, like, the most convoluted possible story.

563
00:28:27,620 --> 00:28:29,620
I turned into a star, son.

564
00:28:29,620 --> 00:28:31,620
Is that the way elves go out for cigarettes?

565
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:32,620
Yes.

566
00:28:32,620 --> 00:28:34,620
They are still the best part of this show.

567
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:36,620
Yeah, but not by much.

568
00:28:36,620 --> 00:28:38,620
I do like their dynamic a lot.

569
00:28:38,620 --> 00:28:40,620
Nice castle, bro.

570
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:44,620
Wait, this was the elves' garrison, this is their tower.

571
00:28:44,620 --> 00:28:46,620
Shouldn't it look nicer than this?

572
00:28:47,620 --> 00:28:48,620
Nope.

573
00:28:48,620 --> 00:28:51,620
No, listen, they didn't have time to maintain it,

574
00:28:51,620 --> 00:28:53,620
as they were so busy, uh,

575
00:28:53,620 --> 00:28:56,620
staring off into the middle distance and seducing village women.

576
00:28:57,620 --> 00:29:01,620
Man, I wish you elves had taken better care of this fucking fortress.

577
00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:03,620
What kind of shit?

578
00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:05,620
That would have been handy right about now.

579
00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:07,620
It's not gonna really defend us, actually.

580
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:09,620
I think it's gonna fall over.

581
00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:13,620
Oh, Jesus.

582
00:29:23,620 --> 00:29:25,620
The sword is the ring.

583
00:29:25,620 --> 00:29:26,620
Yay.

584
00:29:26,620 --> 00:29:28,620
It is Sauron.

585
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:30,620
Mauler is wrong.

586
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:32,620
What did Mauler say?

587
00:29:32,620 --> 00:29:36,620
Mauler said that that was Gandalf, not Sauron, the stranger.

588
00:29:36,620 --> 00:29:40,620
It's pretty obvious from the way that he killed the fireflies that he was, like...

589
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:41,620
Mm-hmm.

590
00:29:41,620 --> 00:29:42,620
Oh, wait a minute.

591
00:29:42,620 --> 00:29:44,620
Was he like...

592
00:29:44,620 --> 00:29:46,620
Was Adar controlling that human?

593
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:48,620
But I think he would be like, after that, be like,

594
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:50,620
What happened? My head hurts.

595
00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:53,620
We do know that sorcerers have the ability to do that.

596
00:29:53,620 --> 00:29:54,620
Like with Theoden.

597
00:29:54,620 --> 00:29:56,620
To at least influence people.

598
00:29:57,620 --> 00:29:59,620
Wait, this is the whole ship, is it?

599
00:30:00,620 --> 00:30:02,620
We're gonna battle in the middle of this.

600
00:30:02,620 --> 00:30:05,620
No, I assume it's gonna take her to a bigger boat.

601
00:30:05,620 --> 00:30:07,620
Wanna just row back to the mainland?

602
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:10,620
It's what you deserve, elf.

603
00:30:10,620 --> 00:30:12,620
They're just like, No, swim.

604
00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:14,620
Just keep swimming. You can make it, right?

605
00:30:14,620 --> 00:30:18,620
Like all elves, she prefers to stand in the fucking mountains.

606
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:21,620
Decemberism.

607
00:30:23,620 --> 00:30:26,620
They gotta get punished for their racism.

608
00:30:26,620 --> 00:30:28,620
I made the wrong decision.

609
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:32,620
We can just order them to stop still.

610
00:30:33,620 --> 00:30:34,620
Yeah.

611
00:30:34,620 --> 00:30:36,620
Rade, just come back!

612
00:30:36,620 --> 00:30:39,620
She calls her back, and then the tree just immediately stops shedding.

613
00:30:39,620 --> 00:30:41,620
It's like, okay, good.

614
00:30:42,620 --> 00:30:43,620
Wait a minute.

615
00:30:44,620 --> 00:30:47,620
So, they just change their mind after seeing that, I guess?

616
00:30:47,620 --> 00:30:48,620
Actually?

617
00:30:49,620 --> 00:30:50,620
Yep.

618
00:30:50,620 --> 00:30:53,620
Well, I guess that's the most reasonable thing to do, actually.

619
00:30:53,620 --> 00:30:54,620
Yeah?

620
00:30:54,620 --> 00:30:55,620
Yeah.

621
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:57,620
I didn't see that coming.

622
00:30:57,620 --> 00:30:59,620
And they're travelling to the Southlands.

623
00:30:59,620 --> 00:31:01,620
Whom they apparently know is under threat.

624
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:02,620
I will serve.

625
00:31:03,620 --> 00:31:05,620
I know that because of the map thing.

626
00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:09,620
Are they seagulling, March?

627
00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:10,620
Oh my god!

628
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:12,620
Hard up!

629
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:15,620
Cancelled. Cancelled.

630
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:17,620
Aces.

631
00:31:18,620 --> 00:31:20,620
I was in a sudden turn for the darkness.

632
00:31:21,620 --> 00:31:23,620
Hold on, his rings of power are based?

633
00:31:26,620 --> 00:31:27,620
Well, there we go.

634
00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:28,620
Yeah.

635
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:31,620
The plot suddenly sped up massively.

636
00:31:31,620 --> 00:31:33,620
A lot of skipping.

637
00:31:33,620 --> 00:31:37,620
I mean, at least interesting things are happening, but a lot of skipping.

638
00:31:38,620 --> 00:31:41,620
It's become a show, and not just a train wreck.

639
00:31:41,620 --> 00:31:44,620
I feel like it's probably too little too late, but...

640
00:31:44,620 --> 00:31:49,620
The biggest problem is, it feels like I'm reading the script right now.

641
00:31:51,620 --> 00:31:54,620
And it obviously has nothing to do with the actual Lord of the Rings.

642
00:31:54,620 --> 00:31:56,620
So the trees start shedding, and she goes like,

643
00:31:56,620 --> 00:31:59,620
Ah, this is what my daddy told me about! Jesus!

644
00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:00,620
Yeah, so I was like...

645
00:32:00,620 --> 00:32:02,620
Galadriel too has completely changed the tune.

646
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:04,620
It's no longer looking for Sauron.

647
00:32:04,620 --> 00:32:05,620
He's not a potential threat.

648
00:32:05,620 --> 00:32:06,620
No, no, no.

649
00:32:06,620 --> 00:32:08,620
He's attacking the Southlands.

650
00:32:08,620 --> 00:32:09,620
Alright.

651
00:32:09,620 --> 00:32:10,620
Because, why?

652
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:12,620
Because you looked at the map and went like,

653
00:32:12,620 --> 00:32:14,620
Huh, scribbles kind of look like that.

654
00:32:14,620 --> 00:32:15,620
Basically...

655
00:32:15,620 --> 00:32:17,620
There's a seagull that's...

656
00:32:17,620 --> 00:32:20,620
And she has no reason to believe that there's an army there.

657
00:32:20,620 --> 00:32:22,620
She thinks that maybe the orcs are moving there.

658
00:32:22,620 --> 00:32:24,620
That Sauron might have a base there.

659
00:32:24,620 --> 00:32:26,620
As far as she knows, it's simply a waypoint.

660
00:32:26,620 --> 00:32:27,620
But no, it's like,

661
00:32:27,620 --> 00:32:29,620
Ah, they're under siege.

662
00:32:29,620 --> 00:32:30,620
They're under siege?

663
00:32:30,620 --> 00:32:32,620
I'm the king of the Southlands, by the way.

664
00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:34,620
I found him on the sea.

665
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:37,620
They do know that because of the character they found on the sea.

666
00:32:37,620 --> 00:32:40,620
Because he tells her that they're under siege, and they're under attack.

667
00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:41,620
And that they're being killed.

668
00:32:41,620 --> 00:32:43,620
So it's all just based on his say-so, I guess?

669
00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:45,620
Because he was there.

670
00:32:45,620 --> 00:32:46,620
No, he wasn't.

671
00:32:46,620 --> 00:32:47,620
Yeah, he was.

672
00:32:47,620 --> 00:32:49,620
He said that he was driven from the lands.

673
00:32:49,620 --> 00:32:51,620
No, he was talking about enemies and courses.

674
00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:55,620
Like, the orcs haven't started attacking until recently.

675
00:32:55,620 --> 00:32:57,620
Like, Black Elf literally was saying,

676
00:32:57,620 --> 00:33:00,620
Like, oh gosh, I haven't seen shit for 70 years.

677
00:33:00,620 --> 00:33:03,620
I could have sworn the dude at the sea, whatever his name is,

678
00:33:03,620 --> 00:33:07,620
Said that they were under attack, and people were being pushed out of their land.

679
00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:10,620
What if this is all part of his ploy?

680
00:33:10,620 --> 00:33:14,620
What they'll do is they'll move all of the forces off of the island,

681
00:33:14,620 --> 00:33:16,620
And then something bad will happen on the island.

682
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:18,620
See...

683
00:33:18,620 --> 00:33:21,620
Judging by the story, as I know...

684
00:33:23,620 --> 00:33:25,620
Arch?

685
00:33:25,620 --> 00:33:26,620
Arch?

686
00:33:26,620 --> 00:33:28,620
Arch has been judged.

687
00:33:28,620 --> 00:33:30,620
Oh no.

688
00:33:30,620 --> 00:33:31,620
Basil's down.

689
00:33:31,620 --> 00:33:34,620
Oh, you know what I will say then, while we wait for Arch to return?

690
00:33:34,620 --> 00:33:35,620
I'll say this.

691
00:33:35,620 --> 00:33:37,620
No Harfoots this time.

692
00:33:37,620 --> 00:33:39,620
You know what? I'm happy for that.

693
00:33:39,620 --> 00:33:41,620
You're okay with that?

694
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:47,620
Instead of, like, awful Harfoot scenes, we got less awful dwarf scenes.

695
00:33:47,620 --> 00:33:51,620
Just means we're gonna see lots of Harfoots next episode, probably.

696
00:33:51,620 --> 00:33:53,620
Oh god. Yeah, we are.

697
00:33:53,620 --> 00:33:55,620
Oh no, Arch dropped out!

698
00:33:55,620 --> 00:33:59,620
Kibs, usually you record your thing after we've done this, right?

699
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:01,620
Mm-hmm.

700
00:34:01,620 --> 00:34:03,620
Arch is gonna be gone.

701
00:34:03,620 --> 00:34:04,620
Yeah.

702
00:34:04,620 --> 00:34:06,620
Oh shit, what are you guys gonna do?

703
00:34:06,620 --> 00:34:10,620
Well, we'll have to wait and see if he wakes up,

704
00:34:10,620 --> 00:34:12,620
And if he doesn't, then I have to go to bed.

705
00:34:12,620 --> 00:34:14,620
Then we do it tomorrow.

706
00:34:14,620 --> 00:34:16,620
Oh no!

707
00:34:17,620 --> 00:34:22,620
He might be back, because what he has to do is he goes out and resets his internet thingy.

708
00:34:22,620 --> 00:34:25,620
Wait, he goes out? He goes outside?

709
00:34:25,620 --> 00:34:27,620
It's in a separate building, apparently.

710
00:34:27,620 --> 00:34:28,620
Oh Jesus, okay.

711
00:34:28,620 --> 00:34:31,620
Well, in terms of the dwarven stuff, it was actually pretty good.

712
00:34:31,620 --> 00:34:34,620
That story is a story that's very character-driven, right?

713
00:34:34,620 --> 00:34:41,620
It's about the relationship between the dwarf prince and his wife, and Elrond, and...

714
00:34:41,620 --> 00:34:44,620
There's a fun little thing going on there, and I'm enjoying it.

715
00:34:44,620 --> 00:34:46,620
And now they added the king into the mix?

716
00:34:46,620 --> 00:34:50,620
There's a bunch of character moments in there that are pretty satisfying.

717
00:34:50,620 --> 00:34:51,620
Yes.

718
00:34:51,620 --> 00:34:54,620
It's sort of like a touchback to Legolas and Gimli.

719
00:34:54,620 --> 00:34:55,620
Welcome back.

720
00:34:55,620 --> 00:34:57,620
Hi, welcome back.

721
00:34:57,620 --> 00:34:59,620
I'm gonna call it right now.

722
00:34:59,620 --> 00:35:02,620
Theo is Halbrand.

723
00:35:03,620 --> 00:35:05,620
What makes you think that?

724
00:35:05,620 --> 00:35:10,620
Because of the weird disjointed nature of all of this.

725
00:35:10,620 --> 00:35:12,620
Okay, as you mentioned, right?

726
00:35:12,620 --> 00:35:14,620
Halbrand has been driven from his home.

727
00:35:14,620 --> 00:35:19,620
Now, I'm pretty sure he mentions corsairs, but he might have just mentioned enemies,

728
00:35:19,620 --> 00:35:23,620
which I remember commenting on because it didn't make sense because, like, the world's at peace.

729
00:35:23,620 --> 00:35:25,620
What fucking enemies?

730
00:35:25,620 --> 00:35:32,620
But at the same time, Black Elf has been specifically placed in the Southlands to look for signs of the enemy.

731
00:35:32,620 --> 00:35:38,620
They haven't seen shit for 70 years, and only now are there vague hints with the cows going mad.

732
00:35:38,620 --> 00:35:45,620
So, there's no indication or reason to suggest that the Orcs were widespread or obvious,

733
00:35:45,620 --> 00:35:47,620
so they couldn't have been attacking them.

734
00:35:47,620 --> 00:35:49,620
So what drove them from their lands?

735
00:35:49,620 --> 00:35:52,620
Well, maybe that was a different timeline.

736
00:35:52,620 --> 00:35:56,620
Like, I'm really starting to lean towards the different timeline interpretation.

737
00:35:56,620 --> 00:36:01,620
Yeah, so it's like what the Witcher did, basically, with everything happening at different times.

738
00:36:01,620 --> 00:36:07,620
So, you think that the young kid, who has, like, the hilt of Sauron or whatever,

739
00:36:07,620 --> 00:36:10,620
he's going to end up being Halbrand as an adult?

740
00:36:10,620 --> 00:36:15,620
Perhaps. I don't have much basis for that, mind you. It's just a wild theory.

741
00:36:15,620 --> 00:36:16,620
I mean, it could have...

742
00:36:16,620 --> 00:36:18,620
He should have darker skin, if so.

743
00:36:18,620 --> 00:36:19,620
It kind of feels...

744
00:36:19,620 --> 00:36:22,620
Because I remember what shows it is. It's true.

745
00:36:22,620 --> 00:36:28,620
You know what? That actually kind of feels right because the Black Elf story,

746
00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:31,620
he's kind of, like, disjointed from everything else, you know?

747
00:36:31,620 --> 00:36:35,620
Because we know that Galadriel's story is happening at the same time as Elrond's because they met up.

748
00:36:35,620 --> 00:36:37,620
So, that's happening at the same time.

749
00:36:37,620 --> 00:36:43,620
However, we also know that the Harfoot story is happening at the same time as the Black Elf story

750
00:36:43,620 --> 00:36:47,620
because the guy just mentioned three weeks ago there was that meteor.

751
00:36:47,620 --> 00:36:52,620
So, maybe this story is happening at two different time frames.

752
00:36:52,620 --> 00:36:56,620
And, interestingly, nobody else is mentioning the meteor.

753
00:36:56,620 --> 00:36:59,620
Like, Galadriel hasn't seen it. The new Noryns haven't seen it.

754
00:36:59,620 --> 00:37:02,620
Now, maybe you could argue geography, but...

755
00:37:02,620 --> 00:37:04,620
Yeah.

756
00:37:04,620 --> 00:37:05,620
No, this makes sense.

757
00:37:05,620 --> 00:37:08,620
Especially, yeah, because the kid gets corrupted with the Sauron Blade

758
00:37:08,620 --> 00:37:12,620
and then he ends up somehow being the king.

759
00:37:12,620 --> 00:37:14,620
Or maybe, who knows?

760
00:37:14,620 --> 00:37:17,620
And then is found on the sea as an adult.

761
00:37:17,620 --> 00:37:22,620
And he's already pretty Sauron-like as an adult.

762
00:37:23,620 --> 00:37:26,620
It depends on whether he goes with the elves or stays.

763
00:37:26,620 --> 00:37:31,620
Because what's going to happen now is that in the absence of the progressive woman queen,

764
00:37:31,620 --> 00:37:34,620
whoever stays behind, be it Farazhon or Halibrand,

765
00:37:34,620 --> 00:37:40,620
they're going to start properly corrupting people and Numenor is going to fall while she's away.

766
00:37:40,620 --> 00:37:45,620
Because, obviously, she can't make a mistake. That'd be silly.

767
00:37:45,620 --> 00:37:53,620
It's because of her absence that they're corrupted into believing that the elves are holding out in Valar.

768
00:37:53,620 --> 00:37:55,620
They're prevented from having immortality.

769
00:37:56,620 --> 00:38:01,620
Yes, then they'll return briefly. They'll get a few survivors, maybe, and then escape.

770
00:38:01,620 --> 00:38:05,620
Or maybe this is the escape and then the island will just sink off-screen somewhere.

771
00:38:05,620 --> 00:38:08,620
Everybody died and the people that made it come back are like,

772
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:11,620
Why is there just ocean everywhere?

773
00:38:11,620 --> 00:38:16,620
Oh god, can you imagine? They used all the CG for the dream and they don't even show it in real life.

774
00:38:16,620 --> 00:38:19,620
Oh, well, I mean, they did show it technically.

775
00:38:19,620 --> 00:38:21,620
Don't worry, let's recycle the scenes even.

776
00:38:21,620 --> 00:38:23,620
Oh god.

777
00:38:23,620 --> 00:38:26,620
It was expensive, dammit.

778
00:38:28,620 --> 00:38:35,620
The show is picking up. There's things happening and there's some enjoyable parts. It's not great.

779
00:38:35,620 --> 00:38:38,620
But I still think House of the Dragons is better.

780
00:38:38,620 --> 00:38:44,620
But, I mean, at least I'm not bored to fucking tears like I was to the first two hours of it, you know?

781
00:38:44,620 --> 00:38:48,620
My opinion is actually this is more interesting than the previous episode of House of the Dragons.

782
00:38:48,620 --> 00:38:53,620
Most of the stuff was actually happening and some of the character interactions were actually tolerable.

783
00:38:53,620 --> 00:38:56,620
Specifically, Elrond and the Dwarf.

784
00:38:56,620 --> 00:38:58,620
Yes, they remain the best part of the show.

785
00:38:58,620 --> 00:39:03,620
They are the only part I enjoy. The show also has an enormous problem.

786
00:39:03,620 --> 00:39:07,620
Now that the imagery is Adan, Adan actually does a pretty good job.

787
00:39:07,620 --> 00:39:13,620
He is displaying actual emotions. He still tries too hard to be poetic.

788
00:39:13,620 --> 00:39:16,620
You can see the script is still fucking struggling.

789
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:18,620
But he delivers it better than most.

790
00:39:18,620 --> 00:39:24,620
And when he then acts opposite Mr. Puerto Rican who has one fucking facial expression.

791
00:39:24,620 --> 00:39:26,620
Yep, it's like Galadriel ass.

792
00:39:26,620 --> 00:39:28,620
It really hammers it home, isn't it?

793
00:39:28,620 --> 00:39:32,620
It's like, wow, you have an actor and then you have this dude who's a model.

794
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:37,620
Yep, there's some really good talent here being wasted, which is tragic.

795
00:39:37,620 --> 00:39:40,620
And it's being wasted because of the diversity hires.

796
00:39:40,620 --> 00:39:47,620
Elrond is passable due to his chemistry with Durin, but Elrond himself is not very interesting.

797
00:39:47,620 --> 00:39:51,620
He doesn't look like Elrond. He doesn't carry himself like Elrond.

798
00:39:51,620 --> 00:39:56,620
At this point, though, I'm kind of a bit past worrying about the lore of it because you already know the lore is just...

799
00:39:56,620 --> 00:39:57,620
It's already raped.

800
00:39:57,620 --> 00:40:00,620
The Rufi has already run its course on the lore of the show.

801
00:40:00,620 --> 00:40:02,620
It's basically irredeemable, you know?

802
00:40:02,620 --> 00:40:03,620
Yeah.

803
00:40:03,620 --> 00:40:09,620
But if we're going to forget about the lore and just talk about the quality of the show itself, it is at least improving.

804
00:40:09,620 --> 00:40:13,620
Just give Helbren more screen time and I'll be happy.

805
00:40:13,620 --> 00:40:17,620
Wait, hold on. Do you just have the hot spring or what?

806
00:40:17,620 --> 00:40:20,620
I just like his character. And maybe...

807
00:40:20,620 --> 00:40:22,620
Jesus.

808
00:40:22,620 --> 00:40:26,620
Maybe Helbren talking some sense into Galadriel.

809
00:40:26,620 --> 00:40:27,620
I assume this is a...

810
00:40:27,620 --> 00:40:30,620
God damn it. That so badly should not...

811
00:40:30,620 --> 00:40:36,620
She is already thousands of years old. She's already an accomplished diplomat.

812
00:40:36,620 --> 00:40:39,620
And here he is like, bitch!

813
00:40:39,620 --> 00:40:49,620
All he's saying is, don't fuck it up. You come into her house, you're rude as shit, and now you're surprised people are...

814
00:40:49,620 --> 00:40:52,620
And now you're surprised you're in a cellar for sedition.

815
00:40:52,620 --> 00:41:00,620
You're supposed to be a guest. You're supposed to be like a representative of the elves for the first time in how many years for these people?

816
00:41:00,620 --> 00:41:01,620
Yeah, hang on.

817
00:41:02,620 --> 00:41:06,620
And she's acting like the most insufferable, bastard-y, badgenable.

818
00:41:06,620 --> 00:41:09,620
And then she's like, why are they jailing me? I don't understand.

819
00:41:09,620 --> 00:41:12,620
And he goes like, why did they jail you, though?

820
00:41:12,620 --> 00:41:15,620
Oh.

821
00:41:15,620 --> 00:41:18,620
Hmm. Maybe I shouldn't have been on their floor.

822
00:41:18,620 --> 00:41:28,620
You know, there's like a decent comedy skit here where you could have like Helbren just in jail, watching Galadriel get released and then put back in multiple times to go back again, eh?

823
00:41:28,620 --> 00:41:29,620
Alright.

824
00:41:29,620 --> 00:41:38,620
You know what? I do like the fact that they're focusing the story a little more and leaving the hardfoot stuff behind for this one.

825
00:41:38,620 --> 00:41:45,620
Oh, god. You mention it, and suddenly I realize we didn't see those disgusting things all episode.

826
00:41:45,620 --> 00:41:49,620
Which means next episode's gonna be all about them.

827
00:41:49,620 --> 00:41:58,620
Don't you wanna know about their star signs and their culture and how they move and leave behind people?

828
00:41:58,620 --> 00:42:01,620
Just a fucking rot?

829
00:42:01,620 --> 00:42:04,620
Yeah, we talked about the hardfoots while you were gone, Arch.

830
00:42:04,620 --> 00:42:09,620
We don't like you, sir. You're going all the way to the back.

831
00:42:09,620 --> 00:42:11,620
Yep, back of the bus.

832
00:42:11,620 --> 00:42:15,620
And that's why the episode felt better. No hardfoots.

833
00:42:15,620 --> 00:42:21,620
Yeah, Arch, to be fair, we already talked about the hardfoots. You were left behind because you were offline at the moment.

834
00:42:21,620 --> 00:42:26,620
Okay, so I think that might be it. At least for this video.

835
00:42:26,620 --> 00:42:30,620
Welcome back next week and do some more, unfortunately.

836
00:42:30,620 --> 00:42:32,620
Yep, more grinding.

837
00:42:32,620 --> 00:42:34,620
We'll do it again.

838
00:42:34,620 --> 00:42:40,620
We'll do it. I like how, Arch, you've been like, for like three years, you've been like, Dev, let me on your channel.

839
00:42:40,620 --> 00:42:43,620
And this is what we're doing.

840
00:42:43,620 --> 00:42:45,620
This was my thanks.
