0	7000	Are you a safety valve for people who are stewing about all kinds of stuff, or are you dangerous?
7000	12000	I don't know whether I'm dangerous. I just say what I think, and it's the way I think.
12000	16000	You could say it's bigotry if you want. I don't think it is.
16000	21000	I'm pro-Canadian, more so than I'm anti-Soviet or anti-Sweet.
21000	25000	I wish more Canadians were like me.
25000	29000	That really plays in the country these days, but where is it going to end?
29000	32000	Where is it going to end if we get into that kind of politics?
32000	36000	Whether it's in sport, whether it's to do with jobs.
36000	40000	We let people come in and take our fish, and the people are starving down there.
40000	43000	Then people come in and wreck everything on us.
43000	46000	They come in, and it wouldn't happen if I was a part of it.
46000	50000	There's not a party in Canada that would take you today with what you're talking about and what you believe in.
50000	51000	I've been asked by two.
51000	52000	Which ones?
52000	54000	Liberal and Conservative.
54000	57000	And they want Don Cherry in there talking about, complaining about the immigrants.
57000	61000	They want people that people like, that people like on TV.
61000	65000	How could you not like me on TV if you're Canadian? Good old boy like me.
65000	69000	From the back benches, he'll clean up metric and more.
69000	71000	I'll tell you, I'll straighten those guys out.
71000	73000	I want to be in the back, hollering and yelling.
73000	76000	I'll be great. I'll be as great in politics.
76000	80000	Imagine me going down to Newfoundland, going down there.
80000	81000	What would happen?
81000	87000	I'd go down there and I'd say, look, vote me in, and I guarantee you, as I stand here,
87000	91000	no foreign trawler would come in and touch one fish.
91000	95000	And foreign aid, if you want to get into that, here we got people dying.
95000	99000	Here we got people dying for want of beds, and we're giving money to the foreigners.
99000	103000	No way. It'd be Canada first, and Canada only.
103000	105000	That's what I am, a nationalist.
105000	107000	I'm going to start a new power, the nationalist.
107000	111000	And isolating ourselves in trade, and isolating ourselves and the rest of the world
111000	116000	will do just as much good as going out and punching somebody in the nose
116000	118000	before the end of the third period.
118000	123000	75% of our trade is with good old USA, and they like us strong.
123000	125000	They want us strong, not to be wimps.
