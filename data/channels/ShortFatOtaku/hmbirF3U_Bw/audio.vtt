00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
Are you a safety valve for people who are stewing about all kinds of stuff, or are you dangerous?

00:07.000 --> 00:12.000
I don't know whether I'm dangerous. I just say what I think, and it's the way I think.

00:12.000 --> 00:16.000
You could say it's bigotry if you want. I don't think it is.

00:16.000 --> 00:21.000
I'm pro-Canadian, more so than I'm anti-Soviet or anti-Sweet.

00:21.000 --> 00:25.000
I wish more Canadians were like me.

00:25.000 --> 00:29.000
That really plays in the country these days, but where is it going to end?

00:29.000 --> 00:32.000
Where is it going to end if we get into that kind of politics?

00:32.000 --> 00:36.000
Whether it's in sport, whether it's to do with jobs.

00:36.000 --> 00:40.000
We let people come in and take our fish, and the people are starving down there.

00:40.000 --> 00:43.000
Then people come in and wreck everything on us.

00:43.000 --> 00:46.000
They come in, and it wouldn't happen if I was a part of it.

00:46.000 --> 00:50.000
There's not a party in Canada that would take you today with what you're talking about and what you believe in.

00:50.000 --> 00:51.000
I've been asked by two.

00:51.000 --> 00:52.000
Which ones?

00:52.000 --> 00:54.000
Liberal and Conservative.

00:54.000 --> 00:57.000
And they want Don Cherry in there talking about, complaining about the immigrants.

00:57.000 --> 01:01.000
They want people that people like, that people like on TV.

01:01.000 --> 01:05.000
How could you not like me on TV if you're Canadian? Good old boy like me.

01:05.000 --> 01:09.000
From the back benches, he'll clean up metric and more.

01:09.000 --> 01:11.000
I'll tell you, I'll straighten those guys out.

01:11.000 --> 01:13.000
I want to be in the back, hollering and yelling.

01:13.000 --> 01:16.000
I'll be great. I'll be as great in politics.

01:16.000 --> 01:20.000
Imagine me going down to Newfoundland, going down there.

01:20.000 --> 01:21.000
What would happen?

01:21.000 --> 01:27.000
I'd go down there and I'd say, look, vote me in, and I guarantee you, as I stand here,

01:27.000 --> 01:31.000
no foreign trawler would come in and touch one fish.

01:31.000 --> 01:35.000
And foreign aid, if you want to get into that, here we got people dying.

01:35.000 --> 01:39.000
Here we got people dying for want of beds, and we're giving money to the foreigners.

01:39.000 --> 01:43.000
No way. It'd be Canada first, and Canada only.

01:43.000 --> 01:45.000
That's what I am, a nationalist.

01:45.000 --> 01:47.000
I'm going to start a new power, the nationalist.

01:47.000 --> 01:51.000
And isolating ourselves in trade, and isolating ourselves and the rest of the world

01:51.000 --> 01:56.000
will do just as much good as going out and punching somebody in the nose

01:56.000 --> 01:58.000
before the end of the third period.

01:58.000 --> 02:03.000
75% of our trade is with good old USA, and they like us strong.

02:03.000 --> 02:05.000
They want us strong, not to be wimps.
