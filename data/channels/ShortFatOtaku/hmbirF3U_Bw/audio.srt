1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Are you a safety valve for people who are stewing about all kinds of stuff, or are you dangerous?

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
I don't know whether I'm dangerous. I just say what I think, and it's the way I think.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
You could say it's bigotry if you want. I don't think it is.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
I'm pro-Canadian, more so than I'm anti-Soviet or anti-Sweet.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
I wish more Canadians were like me.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
That really plays in the country these days, but where is it going to end?

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Where is it going to end if we get into that kind of politics?

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Whether it's in sport, whether it's to do with jobs.

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
We let people come in and take our fish, and the people are starving down there.

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Then people come in and wreck everything on us.

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
They come in, and it wouldn't happen if I was a part of it.

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
There's not a party in Canada that would take you today with what you're talking about and what you believe in.

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I've been asked by two.

14
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Which ones?

15
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Liberal and Conservative.

16
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
And they want Don Cherry in there talking about, complaining about the immigrants.

17
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
They want people that people like, that people like on TV.

18
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
How could you not like me on TV if you're Canadian? Good old boy like me.

19
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
From the back benches, he'll clean up metric and more.

20
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I'll tell you, I'll straighten those guys out.

21
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I want to be in the back, hollering and yelling.

22
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'll be great. I'll be as great in politics.

23
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Imagine me going down to Newfoundland, going down there.

24
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
What would happen?

25
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I'd go down there and I'd say, look, vote me in, and I guarantee you, as I stand here,

26
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
no foreign trawler would come in and touch one fish.

27
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
And foreign aid, if you want to get into that, here we got people dying.

28
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Here we got people dying for want of beds, and we're giving money to the foreigners.

29
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
No way. It'd be Canada first, and Canada only.

30
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
That's what I am, a nationalist.

31
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I'm going to start a new power, the nationalist.

32
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
And isolating ourselves in trade, and isolating ourselves and the rest of the world

33
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,000
will do just as much good as going out and punching somebody in the nose

34
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
before the end of the third period.

35
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,000
75% of our trade is with good old USA, and they like us strong.

36
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
They want us strong, not to be wimps.
