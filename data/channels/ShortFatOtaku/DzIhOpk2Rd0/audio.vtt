00:00.000 --> 00:16.320
So, Dave and I spent a bunch of time with Saints Row, the reboot, on stream yesterday,

00:16.320 --> 00:20.320
featuring our blue-skinned, non-binary, genderqueer, Groose replica.

00:20.320 --> 00:22.100
Yeah, that's zur right there.

00:22.100 --> 00:23.100
And you know what?

00:23.100 --> 00:24.760
It's as bad as everyone's making it out to be.

00:24.760 --> 00:28.220
If you weren't along for the ride with us, I'll just quickly confirm all of those viral

00:28.220 --> 00:30.540
posts about how bad the game is right now.

00:30.540 --> 00:34.020
There's this clip from another streamer, where the opening of the game is just the main character

00:34.020 --> 00:38.320
cringily swearing up a storm like the game is written by a 40-year-old sex pest who is

00:38.320 --> 00:41.780
role-playing as a child who just discovered that they can curse in private and their parents

00:41.780 --> 00:42.780
won't hear them

00:42.780 --> 00:43.780
Insanity!

00:43.780 --> 00:46.780
You didn't get a bonus.

00:46.780 --> 00:47.780
And...

00:47.780 --> 00:48.780
Excuse me.

00:48.780 --> 00:49.780
You would never believe...

00:49.780 --> 00:50.780
Oh...

00:50.780 --> 00:51.780
Yeah.

00:51.780 --> 01:03.860
I'm guessing there might be some music playing right now, if you...

01:03.860 --> 01:06.060
I turned off the live music.

01:06.060 --> 01:09.060
There might be some music right now.

01:09.060 --> 01:10.060
I don't know.

01:10.060 --> 01:11.060
Probably is.

01:11.060 --> 01:13.780
Yeah, this is actually how the game starts.

01:13.780 --> 01:17.740
Though I will say, if you choose the British voice, she says Codswallop, which is kind

01:17.740 --> 01:18.740
of funny.

01:18.740 --> 01:22.180
There's this clip about how character models just glitch out or T-pose constantly.

01:22.180 --> 01:24.060
Yep, this is actually how the game looks.

01:24.060 --> 01:28.220
However, I will add the most egregious thing we encountered was that not a single finishing

01:28.220 --> 01:30.020
move ever actually worked.

01:30.020 --> 01:34.060
The targets would ragdoll or glitch out as our big blueberry just clumsily swiped at

01:34.060 --> 01:35.060
the air.

01:35.060 --> 01:36.060
No, I go!

01:36.060 --> 01:37.060
And you're dead.

01:37.060 --> 01:38.060
Oh, yeah.

01:38.060 --> 01:39.060
You're dead!

01:39.060 --> 01:40.060
And you're dead.

01:41.060 --> 01:42.060
And you're dead.

01:42.060 --> 01:43.060
And you're dead.

01:43.060 --> 01:44.060
And you're dead.

01:44.060 --> 01:46.740
We didn't get one finisher to work in that entire stream.

01:46.740 --> 01:50.660
There's pictures of placeholder alerts popping in, and not only does this actually happen,

01:50.660 --> 01:53.980
sometimes the wrong alert appears, or there's no alert at all for something that really

01:53.980 --> 01:54.980
should have one.

01:54.980 --> 01:59.040
There's clips like this, where how you can no longer hold up or shoot or rob from the

01:59.040 --> 02:00.140
shopkeepers anymore.

02:00.140 --> 02:04.900
Yes, the friendly NPCs can no longer be hurt and barely even react to having a gun pulled

02:04.900 --> 02:05.900
on them.

02:05.940 --> 02:10.620
As far back as Saints Row 1 on the Xbox fucking 360, they had an entire mechanic where you

02:10.620 --> 02:14.740
could rob stores and take clerks hostage, getting free money and equipment in exchange

02:14.740 --> 02:18.300
for a shit-ton of attention brought down on you, but that's just not an option anymore.

02:18.300 --> 02:21.920
And speaking of the older games, after playing the new one for a while, it really looks like

02:21.920 --> 02:25.860
they just stole the movement animations from Saints Row 3 and attached them to their new

02:25.860 --> 02:28.520
models, sometimes with really janky effects.

02:28.520 --> 02:32.340
I understand that in a game like God of War Ragnarok, they're reusing some of the same

02:32.340 --> 02:35.700
animations, but that's only a couple of years later in the same engine.

02:35.700 --> 02:38.820
The other Saints games are a decade old, what are you lazy fucks doing?

02:38.820 --> 02:42.960
There's written reviews out there describing how the actual heist missions don't involve

02:42.960 --> 02:44.420
you doing an actual heist.

02:44.420 --> 02:48.860
Instead, you complete the setup phase by taking surveillance photos of security cameras and

02:48.860 --> 02:52.420
at entrances at the target facility, only to be forced to wait in the car while the

02:52.420 --> 02:56.820
rest of your gang straps on ex-presidents masks and goes inside to commit the crime.

02:56.820 --> 03:01.060
And yeah, for a lot of the game's action, you actually are relegated to getaway driver

03:01.060 --> 03:02.380
and amateur photographer.

03:02.380 --> 03:06.580
In fact, unlocking the game's fast travel points are done by going to a specific scenic

03:06.580 --> 03:09.100
location on the map and taking a selfie.

03:09.100 --> 03:12.820
There's complaints that all of the old Saints Row humor has been neutered, and yes, it's

03:12.820 --> 03:13.820
all true.

03:13.820 --> 03:17.700
The garage where you tune up your car, rim jobs, has been renamed to Jim Rob's, because

03:17.700 --> 03:21.460
the owner is named Jim and he's a capitalist and he charges you way too much money.

03:21.460 --> 03:25.380
The restaurant chain, Freckle Bitches, no longer features a pig-tailed ginger in a bathing

03:25.380 --> 03:29.900
suit serving you food, but instead has been centered to FBs, with a short-haired woman

03:29.900 --> 03:31.160
in a chef's frock.

03:31.160 --> 03:35.160
You actually are criminals because you're trying to make rent and pay off your student

03:35.160 --> 03:39.120
loans because fuck capitalism and fuck money and we all want to live on the commune.

03:39.120 --> 03:42.560
That's not a joke like everyone on Twitter thought it was a few months ago, that's

03:42.560 --> 03:44.040
actually in the game.

03:44.040 --> 03:45.800
And that is probably the worst part.

03:45.800 --> 03:50.320
The glitches are bad and I hate the just-patch-it-later mentality that's infected AAA gaming for

03:50.320 --> 03:55.440
the past decade, but what's far worse is that Saints Row is just neutered at this point.

03:55.440 --> 04:00.100
The well-worn path of woke Karen millennials hijacking a franchise and subverting it by

04:00.100 --> 04:04.620
stripping away all its edgy humor and in its place trying to appeal to Gen Z's awful

04:04.620 --> 04:09.500
sense of comedy, with constant self-referential quips and Marvel references and that god-awful

04:09.500 --> 04:12.640
segment where your character is depressed and you need to mash buttons to make them

04:12.640 --> 04:16.380
get out of bed and shamble over to the freezer to eat a single frozen waffle they can't

04:16.380 --> 04:17.380
even toast?

04:17.380 --> 04:19.000
Yes, that's actually in the game too.

04:19.000 --> 04:23.220
This isn't funny, it's not interesting, it's not entertaining, and it's not fun

04:23.220 --> 04:24.220
to play.

04:24.220 --> 04:25.720
It's just cringe.

04:25.720 --> 04:29.940
To sum it up, the Saints Row reboot is about a game of hipster, law-breaking gangsters

04:29.940 --> 04:33.540
who hate capitalism and want to tear down the system because they're in debt due to

04:33.540 --> 04:37.780
their own bad life choices, and in order to actually play out this socialist fever dream,

04:37.780 --> 04:41.300
your part in it is that you can't actually rob stores or kill store owners, you've

04:41.300 --> 04:45.020
got to sit in the car and watch the AI play the game, and when you are the one fighting

04:45.020 --> 04:46.020
it's a buggy mess.

04:46.020 --> 04:48.200
Yeah, this is pretty on par for 2022.

04:48.200 --> 04:50.320
So the question must be asked, why?

04:50.320 --> 04:54.020
Why take a beloved franchise and subvert it and burn it to the ground, creating a game

04:54.020 --> 04:55.660
that nobody likes and nobody wants?

04:55.660 --> 04:58.580
Yeah, yeah, if you've watched my videos recently you know the answer is Gramsci.

04:58.580 --> 05:00.340
We don't gotta go down that rabbit hole again.

05:00.340 --> 05:03.740
But let's have a more practical conversation this time, less about political theory.

05:03.740 --> 05:08.100
If the developers are so scared of their own past identity that they have to neuter everything,

05:08.100 --> 05:10.540
even the most tame of sex puns, then why even bother?

05:10.540 --> 05:14.260
They've gotta know at this point, with how many times a subverted property is completely

05:14.260 --> 05:16.700
self-destructed, they're not going to make much money on this.

05:16.700 --> 05:18.140
The writing's on the wall now.

05:18.140 --> 05:21.820
Everyone knows that if you release a buggy, unfinished mess, and then try to hand-wave

05:21.820 --> 05:25.940
it away with being woke and sassy on Twitter towards your own fans who are complaining

05:25.940 --> 05:28.460
about the problems, it's not going to end well for you.

05:28.460 --> 05:37.580
Why would you purposefully and publicly set yourself on fire like this?

05:37.580 --> 05:40.660
And of course, there are also retards coming out of the woodwork claiming that Saints Row

05:40.660 --> 05:42.300
was always woke and anti-capitalist.

05:42.300 --> 05:47.060
Motherfucker, the Saints became the CEOs of a mega-corporation that ruled over a dystopian

05:47.060 --> 05:48.060
city.

05:48.060 --> 05:49.060
Twice.

05:49.060 --> 05:50.060
It's the An-Caps' dream.

05:50.060 --> 05:53.100
Oh, and then in Saints Row 4, they became the overlords of a galactic empire.

05:53.100 --> 05:55.220
But let's not talk about Saints Row 4.

05:55.220 --> 05:57.740
Actually wait, it's no longer the worst one in the series anymore.

05:57.740 --> 06:00.740
Maybe we've judged it too harshly, not knowing what was coming next.

06:00.740 --> 06:04.900
But the Progs always try to either whitewash the past, like with dumb shit articles like

06:04.900 --> 06:09.740
Saints Row was always woke and hurr durr durr I'm in danger of choking on my own tongue,

06:09.740 --> 06:12.460
or if they can't do that if it's just too much of a stretch, they'll tell you that

06:12.460 --> 06:14.380
the old works were bad or problematic.

06:14.380 --> 06:18.140
Those old 80s and 90s movies and games you like were bad because they've got titties

06:18.140 --> 06:20.320
and sex jokes.

06:20.320 --> 06:24.780
The current political climate has outgrown the old Saints Row games.

06:24.820 --> 06:28.500
The developer of Saints Row agrees with Anita Sarkeesian's take on their game!

06:28.500 --> 06:30.540
Hey wait, this was back in 2014.

06:30.540 --> 06:33.820
If Saints Row was always woke, why was Anita complaining about it 8 years ago?

06:33.820 --> 06:35.220
It really makes you think.

06:35.220 --> 06:36.220
Well, guess what?

06:36.220 --> 06:39.700
You didn't back down to criticism that your game feels like a soulless husk, with all

06:39.700 --> 06:43.980
the fun cool things from before ripped out and replaced with corpo-wokeness, and I have

06:43.980 --> 06:46.060
a feeling it's not going to turn out well for you.

06:46.060 --> 06:50.340
The stock price of the developer is already tumbling in response to massive fan dissatisfaction.

06:50.340 --> 06:53.580
And though there's no real data yet on how much this piece of shit sold, I'm willing

06:53.580 --> 06:54.860
to bet it's not much.

06:54.860 --> 06:58.820
I told this story on stream yesterday, but the TLDR is, but when I was at GameStop buying

06:58.820 --> 07:03.700
my copy, the guy there said he had only one unclaimed PS5 copy left.

07:03.700 --> 07:04.700
The rest were all preordered.

07:04.700 --> 07:07.300
I asked him, damn, are there that many preorders for this game?

07:07.300 --> 07:09.940
And he said no, actually, there's almost no preorders.

07:09.940 --> 07:14.140
But corporate only allows them to order so many copies of a game on release day based

07:14.140 --> 07:17.320
on how many preorders they get, since that's how they judge popularity.

07:17.320 --> 07:22.120
And he had only one copy of the game to sell, because he had almost no preorders.

07:22.120 --> 07:26.960
He had more display cases of the game on the shelf than he had total copies for sale

07:26.960 --> 07:28.160
in the store.

07:28.160 --> 07:31.560
And just in case you think you can forget about Saints Row and just fall back to Grand

07:31.560 --> 07:36.900
Theft Auto, nuh-uh, think again, GTA 5 has been released and re-released more times than

07:36.900 --> 07:38.160
Skyrim at this point.

07:38.160 --> 07:43.320
We've been playing the same fucking game since the PS3, but finally Rockstar has announced

07:43.320 --> 07:44.560
GTA 6.

07:44.560 --> 07:45.560
And guess what?

07:45.560 --> 07:49.360
It's going to have a female Latinx protagonist, and it's going to scale back all those pesky

07:49.360 --> 07:51.160
racist and sexist jokes.

07:51.200 --> 07:53.600
Man, does everyone want to lose money nowadays?

07:53.600 --> 07:56.600
Where is the money?

07:56.600 --> 07:57.600
Maybe this is purposeful.

07:57.600 --> 08:01.080
Maybe this is part of the socialist subversion, where you literally destroy the system from

08:01.080 --> 08:05.520
the inside by poison-pilling the company so hard, they financially collapse due to their

08:05.520 --> 08:06.520
own suicide.

08:06.520 --> 08:08.680
I guess that's one way to stick it to the man.

08:08.680 --> 08:13.180
Jason Schreier, resident middle-aged gamergate butt-buddy, proclaimed this series of events

08:13.180 --> 08:14.360
as a triumphant victory.

08:14.360 --> 08:18.560
Rockstar Games cleaned up its frat boy culture, becoming a kinder, more progressive game dev

08:18.560 --> 08:19.560
company.

08:19.560 --> 08:20.560
And now it's time to clean up Grand Theft Auto.

08:20.960 --> 08:21.960
Hey, numbnuts.

08:21.960 --> 08:25.600
The reason we fuck around in GTA is because we can't fuck around in real life.

08:25.600 --> 08:29.080
Most of us aren't getting into a shootout with cops, or railing hookers and then killing

08:29.080 --> 08:30.320
them to get our money back.

08:30.320 --> 08:31.380
Uh, hopefully.

08:31.380 --> 08:32.380
And you know what?

08:32.380 --> 08:33.560
It's pretty fun to do that shit in a video game.

08:33.560 --> 08:38.040
It's fun to play as someone that we're not, in the confines of a game where no one's hurt.

08:38.040 --> 08:40.480
And no, online virtual rape doesn't count.

08:40.480 --> 08:46.200
The graphics are so good, this attack is eerily realistic, but this is virtual rape.

08:46.200 --> 08:49.120
Why would anyone want to play as Twitter's main character?

08:49.120 --> 08:52.920
We want to escape all of the woke shit, not dive headfirst into it.

08:52.920 --> 08:53.920
You know what?

08:53.920 --> 08:56.180
I don't even actually care about the Latina playable character.

08:56.180 --> 08:59.920
In fact, that would even be a shit-ton of fun, if they make the game as raunchy as the

08:59.920 --> 09:00.920
previous ones.

09:00.920 --> 09:04.460
Imagine doing all of the over-the-top sexual stuff you could do in other GTA or Saints

09:04.460 --> 09:05.460
Row games.

09:05.460 --> 09:08.520
You fuck hookers, objectify dancers, ogle at bitches walking around the party with their

09:08.520 --> 09:09.960
tits out, but you play as a girl.

09:09.960 --> 09:11.120
That would be awesome.

09:11.120 --> 09:12.980
Harness that raw tomboy energy, dude.

09:12.980 --> 09:16.240
In fact, that's what made the original Hey Ash Whatcha Playin' episode kinda funny.

09:16.240 --> 09:21.240
Yeah, Ashley Burch is a woke wine-ant nightmare nowadays, but back then she was a spunky tomboy

09:21.240 --> 09:22.520
objectifying other women.

09:22.520 --> 09:23.520
And that shit's pretty cool.

09:23.520 --> 09:27.040
Listen, progressives, you're not gonna like this, but objectifying other people, guys

09:27.040 --> 09:28.720
and girls, is fun.

09:28.720 --> 09:31.280
Normal people like to do it, and they like to have it done to them.

09:31.280 --> 09:34.300
People like to be seen as sexually desirable in a fun setting.

09:34.300 --> 09:35.880
And a girl who does it to other girls?

09:35.880 --> 09:36.880
Ten out of ten.

09:36.880 --> 09:37.880
You want to call that problematic?

09:37.880 --> 09:39.200
Great, fine by me.

09:39.200 --> 09:42.320
Doing something that is taboo and unacceptable makes it even more fun.

09:42.320 --> 09:43.880
Anyway, that's my short review.

09:43.880 --> 09:44.880
Saints Row sucks.

09:44.880 --> 09:45.880
Don't buy it.

09:45.880 --> 09:48.320
You can keep streaming it if you want to keep watching it, but it's a dumpster fire.

09:48.320 --> 09:50.480
Don't hold your breath for GTA 6 either.

09:50.480 --> 09:52.400
In fact, just stop caring about new games.

09:52.400 --> 09:56.280
Aside from Nintendo and the occasional indie release, and of course Elden Ring, every new

09:56.280 --> 09:57.280
game sucks now.

09:57.280 --> 10:01.240
And that's pretty bad, but there's literally 40 years of video game history sitting back

10:01.240 --> 10:02.640
in the past you can enjoy.
