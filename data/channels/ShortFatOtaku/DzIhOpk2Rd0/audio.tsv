0	16320	So, Dave and I spent a bunch of time with Saints Row, the reboot, on stream yesterday,
16320	20320	featuring our blue-skinned, non-binary, genderqueer, Groose replica.
20320	22100	Yeah, that's zur right there.
22100	23100	And you know what?
23100	24760	It's as bad as everyone's making it out to be.
24760	28220	If you weren't along for the ride with us, I'll just quickly confirm all of those viral
28220	30540	posts about how bad the game is right now.
30540	34020	There's this clip from another streamer, where the opening of the game is just the main character
34020	38320	cringily swearing up a storm like the game is written by a 40-year-old sex pest who is
38320	41780	role-playing as a child who just discovered that they can curse in private and their parents
41780	42780	won't hear them
42780	43780	Insanity!
43780	46780	You didn't get a bonus.
46780	47780	And...
47780	48780	Excuse me.
48780	49780	You would never believe...
49780	50780	Oh...
50780	51780	Yeah.
51780	63860	I'm guessing there might be some music playing right now, if you...
63860	66060	I turned off the live music.
66060	69060	There might be some music right now.
69060	70060	I don't know.
70060	71060	Probably is.
71060	73780	Yeah, this is actually how the game starts.
73780	77740	Though I will say, if you choose the British voice, she says Codswallop, which is kind
77740	78740	of funny.
78740	82180	There's this clip about how character models just glitch out or T-pose constantly.
82180	84060	Yep, this is actually how the game looks.
84060	88220	However, I will add the most egregious thing we encountered was that not a single finishing
88220	90020	move ever actually worked.
90020	94060	The targets would ragdoll or glitch out as our big blueberry just clumsily swiped at
94060	95060	the air.
95060	96060	No, I go!
96060	97060	And you're dead.
97060	98060	Oh, yeah.
98060	99060	You're dead!
99060	100060	And you're dead.
101060	102060	And you're dead.
102060	103060	And you're dead.
103060	104060	And you're dead.
104060	106740	We didn't get one finisher to work in that entire stream.
106740	110660	There's pictures of placeholder alerts popping in, and not only does this actually happen,
110660	113980	sometimes the wrong alert appears, or there's no alert at all for something that really
113980	114980	should have one.
114980	119040	There's clips like this, where how you can no longer hold up or shoot or rob from the
119040	120140	shopkeepers anymore.
120140	124900	Yes, the friendly NPCs can no longer be hurt and barely even react to having a gun pulled
124900	125900	on them.
125940	130620	As far back as Saints Row 1 on the Xbox fucking 360, they had an entire mechanic where you
130620	134740	could rob stores and take clerks hostage, getting free money and equipment in exchange
134740	138300	for a shit-ton of attention brought down on you, but that's just not an option anymore.
138300	141920	And speaking of the older games, after playing the new one for a while, it really looks like
141920	145860	they just stole the movement animations from Saints Row 3 and attached them to their new
145860	148520	models, sometimes with really janky effects.
148520	152340	I understand that in a game like God of War Ragnarok, they're reusing some of the same
152340	155700	animations, but that's only a couple of years later in the same engine.
155700	158820	The other Saints games are a decade old, what are you lazy fucks doing?
158820	162960	There's written reviews out there describing how the actual heist missions don't involve
162960	164420	you doing an actual heist.
164420	168860	Instead, you complete the setup phase by taking surveillance photos of security cameras and
168860	172420	at entrances at the target facility, only to be forced to wait in the car while the
172420	176820	rest of your gang straps on ex-presidents masks and goes inside to commit the crime.
176820	181060	And yeah, for a lot of the game's action, you actually are relegated to getaway driver
181060	182380	and amateur photographer.
182380	186580	In fact, unlocking the game's fast travel points are done by going to a specific scenic
186580	189100	location on the map and taking a selfie.
189100	192820	There's complaints that all of the old Saints Row humor has been neutered, and yes, it's
192820	193820	all true.
193820	197700	The garage where you tune up your car, rim jobs, has been renamed to Jim Rob's, because
197700	201460	the owner is named Jim and he's a capitalist and he charges you way too much money.
201460	205380	The restaurant chain, Freckle Bitches, no longer features a pig-tailed ginger in a bathing
205380	209900	suit serving you food, but instead has been centered to FBs, with a short-haired woman
209900	211160	in a chef's frock.
211160	215160	You actually are criminals because you're trying to make rent and pay off your student
215160	219120	loans because fuck capitalism and fuck money and we all want to live on the commune.
219120	222560	That's not a joke like everyone on Twitter thought it was a few months ago, that's
222560	224040	actually in the game.
224040	225800	And that is probably the worst part.
225800	230320	The glitches are bad and I hate the just-patch-it-later mentality that's infected AAA gaming for
230320	235440	the past decade, but what's far worse is that Saints Row is just neutered at this point.
235440	240100	The well-worn path of woke Karen millennials hijacking a franchise and subverting it by
240100	244620	stripping away all its edgy humor and in its place trying to appeal to Gen Z's awful
244620	249500	sense of comedy, with constant self-referential quips and Marvel references and that god-awful
249500	252640	segment where your character is depressed and you need to mash buttons to make them
252640	256380	get out of bed and shamble over to the freezer to eat a single frozen waffle they can't
256380	257380	even toast?
257380	259000	Yes, that's actually in the game too.
259000	263220	This isn't funny, it's not interesting, it's not entertaining, and it's not fun
263220	264220	to play.
264220	265720	It's just cringe.
265720	269940	To sum it up, the Saints Row reboot is about a game of hipster, law-breaking gangsters
269940	273540	who hate capitalism and want to tear down the system because they're in debt due to
273540	277780	their own bad life choices, and in order to actually play out this socialist fever dream,
277780	281300	your part in it is that you can't actually rob stores or kill store owners, you've
281300	285020	got to sit in the car and watch the AI play the game, and when you are the one fighting
285020	286020	it's a buggy mess.
286020	288200	Yeah, this is pretty on par for 2022.
288200	290320	So the question must be asked, why?
290320	294020	Why take a beloved franchise and subvert it and burn it to the ground, creating a game
294020	295660	that nobody likes and nobody wants?
295660	298580	Yeah, yeah, if you've watched my videos recently you know the answer is Gramsci.
298580	300340	We don't gotta go down that rabbit hole again.
300340	303740	But let's have a more practical conversation this time, less about political theory.
303740	308100	If the developers are so scared of their own past identity that they have to neuter everything,
308100	310540	even the most tame of sex puns, then why even bother?
310540	314260	They've gotta know at this point, with how many times a subverted property is completely
314260	316700	self-destructed, they're not going to make much money on this.
316700	318140	The writing's on the wall now.
318140	321820	Everyone knows that if you release a buggy, unfinished mess, and then try to hand-wave
321820	325940	it away with being woke and sassy on Twitter towards your own fans who are complaining
325940	328460	about the problems, it's not going to end well for you.
328460	337580	Why would you purposefully and publicly set yourself on fire like this?
337580	340660	And of course, there are also retards coming out of the woodwork claiming that Saints Row
340660	342300	was always woke and anti-capitalist.
342300	347060	Motherfucker, the Saints became the CEOs of a mega-corporation that ruled over a dystopian
347060	348060	city.
348060	349060	Twice.
349060	350060	It's the An-Caps' dream.
350060	353100	Oh, and then in Saints Row 4, they became the overlords of a galactic empire.
353100	355220	But let's not talk about Saints Row 4.
355220	357740	Actually wait, it's no longer the worst one in the series anymore.
357740	360740	Maybe we've judged it too harshly, not knowing what was coming next.
360740	364900	But the Progs always try to either whitewash the past, like with dumb shit articles like
364900	369740	Saints Row was always woke and hurr durr durr I'm in danger of choking on my own tongue,
369740	372460	or if they can't do that if it's just too much of a stretch, they'll tell you that
372460	374380	the old works were bad or problematic.
374380	378140	Those old 80s and 90s movies and games you like were bad because they've got titties
378140	380320	and sex jokes.
380320	384780	The current political climate has outgrown the old Saints Row games.
384820	388500	The developer of Saints Row agrees with Anita Sarkeesian's take on their game!
388500	390540	Hey wait, this was back in 2014.
390540	393820	If Saints Row was always woke, why was Anita complaining about it 8 years ago?
393820	395220	It really makes you think.
395220	396220	Well, guess what?
396220	399700	You didn't back down to criticism that your game feels like a soulless husk, with all
399700	403980	the fun cool things from before ripped out and replaced with corpo-wokeness, and I have
403980	406060	a feeling it's not going to turn out well for you.
406060	410340	The stock price of the developer is already tumbling in response to massive fan dissatisfaction.
410340	413580	And though there's no real data yet on how much this piece of shit sold, I'm willing
413580	414860	to bet it's not much.
414860	418820	I told this story on stream yesterday, but the TLDR is, but when I was at GameStop buying
418820	423700	my copy, the guy there said he had only one unclaimed PS5 copy left.
423700	424700	The rest were all preordered.
424700	427300	I asked him, damn, are there that many preorders for this game?
427300	429940	And he said no, actually, there's almost no preorders.
429940	434140	But corporate only allows them to order so many copies of a game on release day based
434140	437320	on how many preorders they get, since that's how they judge popularity.
437320	442120	And he had only one copy of the game to sell, because he had almost no preorders.
442120	446960	He had more display cases of the game on the shelf than he had total copies for sale
446960	448160	in the store.
448160	451560	And just in case you think you can forget about Saints Row and just fall back to Grand
451560	456900	Theft Auto, nuh-uh, think again, GTA 5 has been released and re-released more times than
456900	458160	Skyrim at this point.
458160	463320	We've been playing the same fucking game since the PS3, but finally Rockstar has announced
463320	464560	GTA 6.
464560	465560	And guess what?
465560	469360	It's going to have a female Latinx protagonist, and it's going to scale back all those pesky
469360	471160	racist and sexist jokes.
471200	473600	Man, does everyone want to lose money nowadays?
473600	476600	Where is the money?
476600	477600	Maybe this is purposeful.
477600	481080	Maybe this is part of the socialist subversion, where you literally destroy the system from
481080	485520	the inside by poison-pilling the company so hard, they financially collapse due to their
485520	486520	own suicide.
486520	488680	I guess that's one way to stick it to the man.
488680	493180	Jason Schreier, resident middle-aged gamergate butt-buddy, proclaimed this series of events
493180	494360	as a triumphant victory.
494360	498560	Rockstar Games cleaned up its frat boy culture, becoming a kinder, more progressive game dev
498560	499560	company.
499560	500560	And now it's time to clean up Grand Theft Auto.
500960	501960	Hey, numbnuts.
501960	505600	The reason we fuck around in GTA is because we can't fuck around in real life.
505600	509080	Most of us aren't getting into a shootout with cops, or railing hookers and then killing
509080	510320	them to get our money back.
510320	511380	Uh, hopefully.
511380	512380	And you know what?
512380	513560	It's pretty fun to do that shit in a video game.
513560	518040	It's fun to play as someone that we're not, in the confines of a game where no one's hurt.
518040	520480	And no, online virtual rape doesn't count.
520480	526200	The graphics are so good, this attack is eerily realistic, but this is virtual rape.
526200	529120	Why would anyone want to play as Twitter's main character?
529120	532920	We want to escape all of the woke shit, not dive headfirst into it.
532920	533920	You know what?
533920	536180	I don't even actually care about the Latina playable character.
536180	539920	In fact, that would even be a shit-ton of fun, if they make the game as raunchy as the
539920	540920	previous ones.
540920	544460	Imagine doing all of the over-the-top sexual stuff you could do in other GTA or Saints
544460	545460	Row games.
545460	548520	You fuck hookers, objectify dancers, ogle at bitches walking around the party with their
548520	549960	tits out, but you play as a girl.
549960	551120	That would be awesome.
551120	552980	Harness that raw tomboy energy, dude.
552980	556240	In fact, that's what made the original Hey Ash Whatcha Playin' episode kinda funny.
556240	561240	Yeah, Ashley Burch is a woke wine-ant nightmare nowadays, but back then she was a spunky tomboy
561240	562520	objectifying other women.
562520	563520	And that shit's pretty cool.
563520	567040	Listen, progressives, you're not gonna like this, but objectifying other people, guys
567040	568720	and girls, is fun.
568720	571280	Normal people like to do it, and they like to have it done to them.
571280	574300	People like to be seen as sexually desirable in a fun setting.
574300	575880	And a girl who does it to other girls?
575880	576880	Ten out of ten.
576880	577880	You want to call that problematic?
577880	579200	Great, fine by me.
579200	582320	Doing something that is taboo and unacceptable makes it even more fun.
582320	583880	Anyway, that's my short review.
583880	584880	Saints Row sucks.
584880	585880	Don't buy it.
585880	588320	You can keep streaming it if you want to keep watching it, but it's a dumpster fire.
588320	590480	Don't hold your breath for GTA 6 either.
590480	592400	In fact, just stop caring about new games.
592400	596280	Aside from Nintendo and the occasional indie release, and of course Elden Ring, every new
596280	597280	game sucks now.
597280	601240	And that's pretty bad, but there's literally 40 years of video game history sitting back
601240	602640	in the past you can enjoy.
602640	605880	Enough video games have been released that if you never played a new one for the rest
605880	608140	of your life, you would not lack for entertainment.
608140	609140	So fuck it.
609140	610920	Stop giving these people money until they smarten up.
