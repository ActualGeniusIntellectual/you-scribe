00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,320
So, Dave and I spent a bunch of time with Saints Row, the reboot, on stream yesterday,

2
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:20,320
featuring our blue-skinned, non-binary, genderqueer, Groose replica.

3
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:22,100
Yeah, that's zur right there.

4
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:23,100
And you know what?

5
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:24,760
It's as bad as everyone's making it out to be.

6
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:28,220
If you weren't along for the ride with us, I'll just quickly confirm all of those viral

7
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:30,540
posts about how bad the game is right now.

8
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:34,020
There's this clip from another streamer, where the opening of the game is just the main character

9
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:38,320
cringily swearing up a storm like the game is written by a 40-year-old sex pest who is

10
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:41,780
role-playing as a child who just discovered that they can curse in private and their parents

11
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:42,780
won't hear them

12
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:43,780
Insanity!

13
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:46,780
You didn't get a bonus.

14
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:47,780
And...

15
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:48,780
Excuse me.

16
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:49,780
You would never believe...

17
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:50,780
Oh...

18
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:51,780
Yeah.

19
00:00:51,780 --> 00:01:03,860
I'm guessing there might be some music playing right now, if you...

20
00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:06,060
I turned off the live music.

21
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:09,060
There might be some music right now.

22
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:10,060
I don't know.

23
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:11,060
Probably is.

24
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:13,780
Yeah, this is actually how the game starts.

25
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:17,740
Though I will say, if you choose the British voice, she says Codswallop, which is kind

26
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:18,740
of funny.

27
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:22,180
There's this clip about how character models just glitch out or T-pose constantly.

28
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:24,060
Yep, this is actually how the game looks.

29
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:28,220
However, I will add the most egregious thing we encountered was that not a single finishing

30
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:30,020
move ever actually worked.

31
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:34,060
The targets would ragdoll or glitch out as our big blueberry just clumsily swiped at

32
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:35,060
the air.

33
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:36,060
No, I go!

34
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:37,060
And you're dead.

35
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:38,060
Oh, yeah.

36
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:39,060
You're dead!

37
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:40,060
And you're dead.

38
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:42,060
And you're dead.

39
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:43,060
And you're dead.

40
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:44,060
And you're dead.

41
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:46,740
We didn't get one finisher to work in that entire stream.

42
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:50,660
There's pictures of placeholder alerts popping in, and not only does this actually happen,

43
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:53,980
sometimes the wrong alert appears, or there's no alert at all for something that really

44
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:54,980
should have one.

45
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:59,040
There's clips like this, where how you can no longer hold up or shoot or rob from the

46
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,140
shopkeepers anymore.

47
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:04,900
Yes, the friendly NPCs can no longer be hurt and barely even react to having a gun pulled

48
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:05,900
on them.

49
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:10,620
As far back as Saints Row 1 on the Xbox fucking 360, they had an entire mechanic where you

50
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:14,740
could rob stores and take clerks hostage, getting free money and equipment in exchange

51
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:18,300
for a shit-ton of attention brought down on you, but that's just not an option anymore.

52
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:21,920
And speaking of the older games, after playing the new one for a while, it really looks like

53
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:25,860
they just stole the movement animations from Saints Row 3 and attached them to their new

54
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:28,520
models, sometimes with really janky effects.

55
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:32,340
I understand that in a game like God of War Ragnarok, they're reusing some of the same

56
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:35,700
animations, but that's only a couple of years later in the same engine.

57
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:38,820
The other Saints games are a decade old, what are you lazy fucks doing?

58
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:42,960
There's written reviews out there describing how the actual heist missions don't involve

59
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,420
you doing an actual heist.

60
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:48,860
Instead, you complete the setup phase by taking surveillance photos of security cameras and

61
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:52,420
at entrances at the target facility, only to be forced to wait in the car while the

62
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:56,820
rest of your gang straps on ex-presidents masks and goes inside to commit the crime.

63
00:02:56,820 --> 00:03:01,060
And yeah, for a lot of the game's action, you actually are relegated to getaway driver

64
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:02,380
and amateur photographer.

65
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:06,580
In fact, unlocking the game's fast travel points are done by going to a specific scenic

66
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:09,100
location on the map and taking a selfie.

67
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:12,820
There's complaints that all of the old Saints Row humor has been neutered, and yes, it's

68
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:13,820
all true.

69
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:17,700
The garage where you tune up your car, rim jobs, has been renamed to Jim Rob's, because

70
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:21,460
the owner is named Jim and he's a capitalist and he charges you way too much money.

71
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:25,380
The restaurant chain, Freckle Bitches, no longer features a pig-tailed ginger in a bathing

72
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:29,900
suit serving you food, but instead has been centered to FBs, with a short-haired woman

73
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:31,160
in a chef's frock.

74
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:35,160
You actually are criminals because you're trying to make rent and pay off your student

75
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:39,120
loans because fuck capitalism and fuck money and we all want to live on the commune.

76
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:42,560
That's not a joke like everyone on Twitter thought it was a few months ago, that's

77
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,040
actually in the game.

78
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:45,800
And that is probably the worst part.

79
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:50,320
The glitches are bad and I hate the just-patch-it-later mentality that's infected AAA gaming for

80
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:55,440
the past decade, but what's far worse is that Saints Row is just neutered at this point.

81
00:03:55,440 --> 00:04:00,100
The well-worn path of woke Karen millennials hijacking a franchise and subverting it by

82
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:04,620
stripping away all its edgy humor and in its place trying to appeal to Gen Z's awful

83
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:09,500
sense of comedy, with constant self-referential quips and Marvel references and that god-awful

84
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:12,640
segment where your character is depressed and you need to mash buttons to make them

85
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:16,380
get out of bed and shamble over to the freezer to eat a single frozen waffle they can't

86
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:17,380
even toast?

87
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:19,000
Yes, that's actually in the game too.

88
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,220
This isn't funny, it's not interesting, it's not entertaining, and it's not fun

89
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:24,220
to play.

90
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:25,720
It's just cringe.

91
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:29,940
To sum it up, the Saints Row reboot is about a game of hipster, law-breaking gangsters

92
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:33,540
who hate capitalism and want to tear down the system because they're in debt due to

93
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:37,780
their own bad life choices, and in order to actually play out this socialist fever dream,

94
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:41,300
your part in it is that you can't actually rob stores or kill store owners, you've

95
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:45,020
got to sit in the car and watch the AI play the game, and when you are the one fighting

96
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:46,020
it's a buggy mess.

97
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:48,200
Yeah, this is pretty on par for 2022.

98
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:50,320
So the question must be asked, why?

99
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:54,020
Why take a beloved franchise and subvert it and burn it to the ground, creating a game

100
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:55,660
that nobody likes and nobody wants?

101
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:58,580
Yeah, yeah, if you've watched my videos recently you know the answer is Gramsci.

102
00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:00,340
We don't gotta go down that rabbit hole again.

103
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:03,740
But let's have a more practical conversation this time, less about political theory.

104
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:08,100
If the developers are so scared of their own past identity that they have to neuter everything,

105
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:10,540
even the most tame of sex puns, then why even bother?

106
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:14,260
They've gotta know at this point, with how many times a subverted property is completely

107
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:16,700
self-destructed, they're not going to make much money on this.

108
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:18,140
The writing's on the wall now.

109
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:21,820
Everyone knows that if you release a buggy, unfinished mess, and then try to hand-wave

110
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:25,940
it away with being woke and sassy on Twitter towards your own fans who are complaining

111
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:28,460
about the problems, it's not going to end well for you.

112
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:37,580
Why would you purposefully and publicly set yourself on fire like this?

113
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:40,660
And of course, there are also retards coming out of the woodwork claiming that Saints Row

114
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:42,300
was always woke and anti-capitalist.

115
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:47,060
Motherfucker, the Saints became the CEOs of a mega-corporation that ruled over a dystopian

116
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:48,060
city.

117
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:49,060
Twice.

118
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:50,060
It's the An-Caps' dream.

119
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:53,100
Oh, and then in Saints Row 4, they became the overlords of a galactic empire.

120
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:55,220
But let's not talk about Saints Row 4.

121
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:57,740
Actually wait, it's no longer the worst one in the series anymore.

122
00:05:57,740 --> 00:06:00,740
Maybe we've judged it too harshly, not knowing what was coming next.

123
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:04,900
But the Progs always try to either whitewash the past, like with dumb shit articles like

124
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:09,740
Saints Row was always woke and hurr durr durr I'm in danger of choking on my own tongue,

125
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:12,460
or if they can't do that if it's just too much of a stretch, they'll tell you that

126
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:14,380
the old works were bad or problematic.

127
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:18,140
Those old 80s and 90s movies and games you like were bad because they've got titties

128
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:20,320
and sex jokes.

129
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:24,780
The current political climate has outgrown the old Saints Row games.

130
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:28,500
The developer of Saints Row agrees with Anita Sarkeesian's take on their game!

131
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:30,540
Hey wait, this was back in 2014.

132
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:33,820
If Saints Row was always woke, why was Anita complaining about it 8 years ago?

133
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:35,220
It really makes you think.

134
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:36,220
Well, guess what?

135
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:39,700
You didn't back down to criticism that your game feels like a soulless husk, with all

136
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:43,980
the fun cool things from before ripped out and replaced with corpo-wokeness, and I have

137
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:46,060
a feeling it's not going to turn out well for you.

138
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:50,340
The stock price of the developer is already tumbling in response to massive fan dissatisfaction.

139
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:53,580
And though there's no real data yet on how much this piece of shit sold, I'm willing

140
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:54,860
to bet it's not much.

141
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:58,820
I told this story on stream yesterday, but the TLDR is, but when I was at GameStop buying

142
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:03,700
my copy, the guy there said he had only one unclaimed PS5 copy left.

143
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:04,700
The rest were all preordered.

144
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:07,300
I asked him, damn, are there that many preorders for this game?

145
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:09,940
And he said no, actually, there's almost no preorders.

146
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:14,140
But corporate only allows them to order so many copies of a game on release day based

147
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:17,320
on how many preorders they get, since that's how they judge popularity.

148
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:22,120
And he had only one copy of the game to sell, because he had almost no preorders.

149
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:26,960
He had more display cases of the game on the shelf than he had total copies for sale

150
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,160
in the store.

151
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:31,560
And just in case you think you can forget about Saints Row and just fall back to Grand

152
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:36,900
Theft Auto, nuh-uh, think again, GTA 5 has been released and re-released more times than

153
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:38,160
Skyrim at this point.

154
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:43,320
We've been playing the same fucking game since the PS3, but finally Rockstar has announced

155
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:44,560
GTA 6.

156
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,560
And guess what?

157
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:49,360
It's going to have a female Latinx protagonist, and it's going to scale back all those pesky

158
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,160
racist and sexist jokes.

159
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:53,600
Man, does everyone want to lose money nowadays?

160
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:56,600
Where is the money?

161
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:57,600
Maybe this is purposeful.

162
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:01,080
Maybe this is part of the socialist subversion, where you literally destroy the system from

163
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:05,520
the inside by poison-pilling the company so hard, they financially collapse due to their

164
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:06,520
own suicide.

165
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:08,680
I guess that's one way to stick it to the man.

166
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:13,180
Jason Schreier, resident middle-aged gamergate butt-buddy, proclaimed this series of events

167
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:14,360
as a triumphant victory.

168
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:18,560
Rockstar Games cleaned up its frat boy culture, becoming a kinder, more progressive game dev

169
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:19,560
company.

170
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:20,560
And now it's time to clean up Grand Theft Auto.

171
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:21,960
Hey, numbnuts.

172
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:25,600
The reason we fuck around in GTA is because we can't fuck around in real life.

173
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:29,080
Most of us aren't getting into a shootout with cops, or railing hookers and then killing

174
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:30,320
them to get our money back.

175
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:31,380
Uh, hopefully.

176
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:32,380
And you know what?

177
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:33,560
It's pretty fun to do that shit in a video game.

178
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:38,040
It's fun to play as someone that we're not, in the confines of a game where no one's hurt.

179
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:40,480
And no, online virtual rape doesn't count.

180
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:46,200
The graphics are so good, this attack is eerily realistic, but this is virtual rape.

181
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:49,120
Why would anyone want to play as Twitter's main character?

182
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:52,920
We want to escape all of the woke shit, not dive headfirst into it.

183
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:53,920
You know what?

184
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:56,180
I don't even actually care about the Latina playable character.

185
00:08:56,180 --> 00:08:59,920
In fact, that would even be a shit-ton of fun, if they make the game as raunchy as the

186
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:00,920
previous ones.

187
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:04,460
Imagine doing all of the over-the-top sexual stuff you could do in other GTA or Saints

188
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:05,460
Row games.

189
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:08,520
You fuck hookers, objectify dancers, ogle at bitches walking around the party with their

190
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:09,960
tits out, but you play as a girl.

191
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,120
That would be awesome.

192
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,980
Harness that raw tomboy energy, dude.

193
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:16,240
In fact, that's what made the original Hey Ash Whatcha Playin' episode kinda funny.

194
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:21,240
Yeah, Ashley Burch is a woke wine-ant nightmare nowadays, but back then she was a spunky tomboy

195
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,520
objectifying other women.

196
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:23,520
And that shit's pretty cool.

197
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:27,040
Listen, progressives, you're not gonna like this, but objectifying other people, guys

198
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,720
and girls, is fun.

199
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:31,280
Normal people like to do it, and they like to have it done to them.

200
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:34,300
People like to be seen as sexually desirable in a fun setting.

201
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:35,880
And a girl who does it to other girls?

202
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:36,880
Ten out of ten.

203
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:37,880
You want to call that problematic?

204
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:39,200
Great, fine by me.

205
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:42,320
Doing something that is taboo and unacceptable makes it even more fun.

206
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,880
Anyway, that's my short review.

207
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:44,880
Saints Row sucks.

208
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:45,880
Don't buy it.

209
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:48,320
You can keep streaming it if you want to keep watching it, but it's a dumpster fire.

210
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,480
Don't hold your breath for GTA 6 either.

211
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,400
In fact, just stop caring about new games.

212
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:56,280
Aside from Nintendo and the occasional indie release, and of course Elden Ring, every new

213
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:57,280
game sucks now.

214
00:09:57,280 --> 00:10:01,240
And that's pretty bad, but there's literally 40 years of video game history sitting back

215
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,640
in the past you can enjoy.

216
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:05,880
Enough video games have been released that if you never played a new one for the rest

217
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:08,140
of your life, you would not lack for entertainment.

218
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:09,140
So fuck it.

219
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:10,920
Stop giving these people money until they smarten up.
