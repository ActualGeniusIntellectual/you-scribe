0	4320	People have been asking me for a while now, when am I going to talk about Limited Run Games?
5280	9920	I guess the answer to that is today. Now for those of you who don't know, Limited Run Games
9920	16000	is a company that releases physical copies of normally digital only games. So usually we're
16000	20640	talking indie games or games released by small studios or games released with a limited run,
20640	25760	which is why they're called Limited Run Games. I actually really appreciate their service because
25760	31440	frankly, considering how the Wii shop went offline recently, the DS shop went offline
31440	36480	a few years ago, eventually all of these stores that I've bought online games on will go offline.
36480	41520	I don't think Steam's going anywhere on PC, but if it's a console and it's a store,
41520	45440	I think they'll be disappearing eventually. Which means that all those games that we've all bought,
46000	50800	they're disappearing too. But if you buy them from Limited Run Games, then you have a physical copy.
50800	55280	No problem. So I think there's definitely a niche in the market for a company like Limited Run
55280	60160	Games. And I also think that they're doing a pretty good service in terms of preserving games
60160	64560	that might in the future disappear unless you pirate them or something. At the same time,
64560	70560	it also seems to be common knowledge that Limited Run Games is staffed by purple haired SJWs.
70560	76080	Unfortunately, you guys remember when this happened? THQ Nordic holds AMA on image board
76080	82160	known for child porn. They're talking about 8chan, by the way, and 8chan wasn't really known
82160	86000	for child porn. They did their best to stamp that shit out. It's the same as the mainstream
86000	91520	media calling Gab a hate speech platform or an alt-right platform, even though places like
91520	96880	Twitter and Facebook also have hate speech and also serve the alt-right. Today, Darksiders
96880	103040	publisher THQ Nordic opted to host an Ask Me Anything AMA session to offer its audience an
103040	107600	opportunity to have questions about its business and games answered. This would be utterly
107600	114400	unremarkable had it not opted to host said AMA on 8chan, an image board known for not-safe-for-work
114400	120080	content of all kinds, including hate speech, child pornography, harassment, and abuse.
120080	126160	Yeah, see, one of those things is not like the other. But yeah, THQ Nordic said we're doing an
126160	131040	8chan AMA and we have no idea why. Come join us. So they posted it on V and they say,
131040	135040	the opportunity was here and we took it. We got approached in a very friendly and polite manner
135040	139360	and were assured said person would take care of the nasty stuff. So here we are.
139360	144960	So yeah, they saw a form, it might have been an anonymous form, but they saw a popular form
144960	148880	devoted to video games and said, you know what, we're releasing a Darksiders game, let's do an
148880	154000	AMA about it. Well, where does Limited Run Games come into this? Well, as it turns out,
154720	161440	around the same time as this 8chan AMA, Limited Run Games has been partnered with THQ Nordic
161440	166080	to bring the game Red Faction to physical format for the PlayStation 4. It's not even the same
166080	170560	game, it wasn't a Darksiders game, it was Red Faction. But nonetheless, this earned the ire
170560	176400	of the idiots over at Reset Era. And posting on Reset Era, Limited Run Games' official account
176400	181760	said, to be clear, we are overjoyed to bring Red Faction to physical format. Agreed that it was
181760	186320	bad wording for the tweet and for that we apologize, it should have been clear. We are not
186320	191760	overjoyed with THQ Nordic's AMA on 8chan, to say the least, and in no way endorse it.
191760	197840	Now, the screeching crybabies on Reset Era are not the main audience of a company like
197840	202800	Limited Run Games, but because they're ideologically aligned, that's who they bow to.
202800	208480	Oh, by the way, in case you need some evidence of what kind of place Reset Era is, this person
208480	215360	got banned for a series of insincere drive-by posts across multiple related threads.
216080	220480	And what he said was, do we have any indication of price or release date yet?
220480	224800	What this person actually did was, in these various threads on Reset Era about Limited
224800	230320	Run Games and THQ Nordic, he refused to jump on the cancel culture bandwagon
230320	234640	and simply asked about the games. He was an outrage, so he was banned.
234640	239680	Now, I personally see no problem with a company like THQ Nordic, or any other company,
239680	245840	running an AMA on a place like 8chan, or 4chan, or reddit, or twitter, or anywhere else. In my
245840	251360	opinion, it's just a forum to talk to fans. The idea that you shouldn't utilize a site
251920	257120	because of some kind of political affiliation that is completely unrelated to your own business
257680	261920	is just absurd to me. But I mean, here we are, welcome to 2019.
261920	267600	The pressure wasn't just on from Limited Run Games or the SJWs over at Reset Era, however.
267600	270800	Here's a Shannon Loftus working for Microsoft Studios,
270800	274960	tweeting at THQ Nordic, why do you still have this link up?
274960	278000	Know your place, pleb. Get back in your lane.
278000	282960	I think what really pissed everyone off, though, was the fact that even though THQ Nordic came out
282960	288160	and apologized under all that pressure, during that actual AMA on 8chan, you can tell the person
288480	291200	who did it was kinda shitlord-y. It was pretty fun.
291200	296000	Here's my old acquaintance, Brad Brown, of the webcomics Blaster Nation and Rockcocks,
296000	302160	also the 4chan v. Tripfag of old, Donkey Kong. Now, I talked about him during my video, Who I
302160	308240	Miss, as being an old friend who I've lost to Trump Derangement Syndrome. And I do say former
308240	314640	acquaintance at this point, because since I made that video, He's blocked me. So very quickly,
314640	318960	he blocked me because he makes porn comics, and I made the argument to him that
318960	325280	being somebody who produces NSFW content, he should probably be more respectful of free speech
325280	329440	rights than he actually is, because free speech rights is the only thing standing between him
329440	333920	and unemployment. But I guess since free speech is a conservative position nowadays or something,
333920	337360	he blocked me for it. So, that's the final end of that friendship.
337360	343120	But anyway, back during the whole AMA, he says, THQ Nordic, or at least their PR guy,
343120	347680	has issued an apology saying they didn't do their research and don't condone the things
347680	354000	that 8chan openly celebrates. Here's their actual posts from their AMA. Don't buy that shit for a
354000	359920	second. This is the guy, this is the guy who used to revel in 4chan culture. And now that he's had
359920	365200	his kicks, and he's grown up a little bit, now he's poo-pooing everybody else who engages in it.
365200	368960	It's kind of like the hippies who smoke weed, and then when they're in their 40s and 50s tell
368960	373200	their kids not to smoke weed and they become like super puritans. It's weird, man.
373200	378240	Anyway, because Brad is now an SJW cuck, unfortunately, he links to Patrick Klepek,
378240	382960	who has provided these four screenshots of that THQ AMA.
382960	387360	Please don't censor any games nor appeal to the social justice crowd. You guys are doing fine
387360	392480	as is. Thanks, we'll try to stay that way. Admitting that the SJWs are encroaching on
392480	397200	gaming and saying that you will resist at all costs? I guess that's worth shaming them
397200	404240	publicly for. Where's the big titty lollies at? You got them already, we'd say. Oh no,
404240	410640	this is the absolute worst crime you could possibly commit. You know, post a picture
411280	418000	of two girls, who are clothed by the way, and then they reply with just a nonsense, nothing reply,
418000	424240	other than public condemnation and shaming and oh, how dare you? THQ didn't clutch their pearls
424240	430560	hard enough. Yeah, Brad, I have no idea how you can endorse this. You draw porn, for fuck's sake.
430560	435760	But back on the main point, Limited Run Games ended up throwing THQ Nordic under the bus
435760	440960	when Cancel Culture came for them, unfortunately, because, you know, I like Limited Run Games. I
440960	446160	have a copy on PS4 of Night Trap. I really enjoyed the fact that they announced all of the old Star
446160	451600	Wars games, like the N64 Shadows of the Empire, other games like that, to be, to be coming to
451600	455920	Limited Run Games. You know, they've done some pretty good work. But, you know, I kind of forgot
455920	461440	about them until this. This just went down like yesterday. Limited Run Games cancelled a customer's
461440	467280	orders, refunded his money, and banned him. Here's why. On November 20th, 2019, it was brought to the
467280	473600	attention of Jeremy Hambley, aka The Quartering, aka My Guy, that Limited Run Games had cancelled
474240	479920	a fan named Brybot's orders, refunded his money, and banned this customer from ordering future
479920	485040	games. Jeremy went ahead and put the information he was sent together and made a video blasting
485040	489200	Limited Run Games for their behaviour. I have actually watched this video, in fact. After
489200	493760	speaking with several people who were in the same Facebook groups as Brybot, I can 100% say that he
493760	498960	did in fact get banned, had his orders cancelled, and was refunded. That is not being disputed by
498960	504240	anyone. However, the why is not because of a meme like Jeremy Hambley states in his video, but
504240	509760	rather for spreading false information. Let's look at the facts. So the story as I understand it,
510400	516880	this person named Brybot was posting memes to I think a fan Facebook group that was run by
516880	520640	Limited Run Games or Limited Run Games was involved, it was about them or something,
520640	527040	and an employee named Sarah from Limited Run Games, she decides to post saying,
527040	535680	I enjoy trolling as much as the next guy, but just a heads up guys, spreading false info and
535680	542720	using company assets is likely to get you banned, if not worse. Uh oh. So what did they actually do?
542720	547280	So this guy, Brybot, he made a meme, which is what the courting asserted in his video.
547280	551280	Now the actual situation is that Limited Run Games is releasing Tetris Effect,
551280	557360	and that's not really an indie game, it's not really a game that needs the clout of a company
557360	562720	like Limited Run Games. So the joke is that, well, if they're not releasing games that require
562720	568080	Limited Run, if they're not releasing games that are indie, why not make it Skyrim? You know?
568080	574560	So he photoshopped it to be Skyrim. Why not make it another game called Return of the Bird King?
574560	579600	Well, here it is, he photoshopped that one too. This is a meme. I know the writer of this article
579600	583760	said that he wasn't banned for memes, he was banned for, what was it, for spreading false
583760	590240	information, but I mean, come on. Yeah, the information in this meme is obviously false,
590240	594240	so I guess that's technically true, but it's still a meme, it's still a joke,
594240	599360	it's still clowning on Limited Run Games. But that was enough to get Brybot banned,
600080	606160	and to have all of his orders refunded by Limited Run Games. And then that same person, Sarah,
606160	611840	decides to post this on the Facebook group. Dude, you got banned for exactly the reasons I warned
611840	616800	you about. I tried, shrug, but yeah, your orders were refunded from what I can see.
616800	621040	Usually takes three to five days to post back to whatever the original payment method was.
621040	625040	Honestly, if I were you, I'd leave it, because if you keep pushing, you'll likely light a fire
625040	629360	under our lawyer's ass. There's a difference between free speech and fragrant misinformation.
630160	636240	What a fucking asshole, dude. Like, this is wild. Imagine when, like, the big Chungus meme came out,
636240	639920	you know, like the really fat Bugs Bunny? Warner Brothers showed up and said, ah,
639920	644080	don't you go posting that meme, because you know what? It uses our original assets,
644160	648960	it uses our company material, so you know what? That's flagrant misinformation.
648960	653120	So the author of this article was technically right, and that, yeah, he was spreading false
653120	659920	information, but it was, like, knowingly false. It was obviously false, you know? When, like,
659920	664480	some terrible comedian shows up on late night TV or whatever, and they're wearing, like, an orange
664480	669120	wig, and they do, like, a really bad Trump impression, and they pretend to be Donald Trump,
669120	674080	and they say all this ridiculous shit, no one thinks that's actually Donald Trump.
674080	678240	We all know that it's a parody, because that's the context of the joke, is that it's a parody.
678240	682800	It looks like the original thing, because that's what makes it funny. So no, it is a meme,
682800	688720	and this is Limited Run Games getting pissed at customers for making memes about them.
688720	692880	And he goes ahead, and he shows off these refunded, refunded, refunded things, you know?
692880	697280	Now, you have to ask, how do we know that these are real, and not just him getting refunds
697280	701760	himself? How do you know he's not just faking all these screenshots and, and drumming it all up?
701760	708720	Well, as it turns out, while I was recording this video, this just happened. From Twitter user
708720	715600	WolfDaddyTX, it's been 13 months since you forked over money. Yeah, it's on us to fulfill our end
715600	720080	of the contract, but since you want to use consumer protection laws against predators like us,
720080	725920	we'll just ban you and sue you. And he's talking about Limited Run Games. This tweet was sent,
726160	731600	let's just see here. It was sent about a half hour ago, at least in terms of this recording. Jesus.
731600	736320	Let's read this ticket thread of his. Hello, I would like to request a cancellation for this
736320	741120	order, as it's now been 13 months since I paid this order, and there seems to be no clear
741120	745280	indication from the developers when it will be ready for manufacture. I've since lost interest
745280	749680	in owning this game, so I would like to request a full refund of my order, including the shipping
749680	756480	costs. Now, in my opinion, that's fair, frankly, if you buy something and it hasn't shipped in 13
756480	761440	months in over a year, get your money back. Yeah. Then here's a Limited Run Games reply.
762240	768640	Hi, unfortunately, per our policy in our FAQ, all sales are considered final. We are unable to
768640	774320	cancel or do a partial refund of your order. Link to this below. I do apologize for the inconvenience.
774320	779440	Well, this confirms that Limited Run Games doesn't actually do refunds. It is a long standing policy
779680	785200	that no refunds are allowed. So I guess that previous guy who has refunds must have come
785200	790400	from them. There's no way he got them himself. But anyway, our friend here replies, as per Australian
790400	795920	consumer law, when a business accepts your payment for products or services, they must supply them to
795920	800800	you within the timeframe they have indicated, or if no timeframe was specified within a reasonable
800800	805280	time. Please, I'd prefer not to have to pursue legal action. I'd like a full refund. And then
805280	810160	Limited Run Games replies with, if you try any legal action, you will be banned from ordering
810160	815920	us again. Wow. Take your money. Don't deliver the product. And then when you bring up that that's,
815920	821520	you know, illegal, they just tell you to fuck off. I have contacted the ACCC, and we'll get
821520	829600	back to you once I've received further advice. And then he just says, sure. Wow. Okay. Limited
829600	834080	Run Games is a piece of shit company. You know, if it was just one, you know, one bad event,
834080	837840	I would understand it, you know, we all have bad days. But this has now become a pattern of
837840	841840	behavior. And it's honestly quite disgusting at this point. You know, this is a company that I
841840	846320	had some serious respect for. I've, I've dropped some money on their products in the past, not
846320	850880	nearly as much as Jeremy. Holy shit, dude. I don't know if you're watching this quartering, but I saw
850880	854720	that collection years. That's a bit nuts. I like the iconic class, but not that much. But yeah,
854720	860880	we are at the point where it just seems like this company is not only run by SJWs. It's run
860880	865840	by completely disingenuous people who will shank their own customers in the back for a buck.
865840	870160	You know, I'm recording this a day before it comes out. I'm recording in the evening
870160	875120	of last night, in fact. And earlier tonight, I was streaming on Game Boomers, Shenmue 3,
875120	880240	which is by the way, a game that I am enjoying very much. But somebody came into the chat room
880240	886080	and said, Hey, hey, Dev, why is it that all the fans of Earthbound are all, they all seem to be
886080	891040	raging SJWs? And I didn't really have a serious answer for him. You know, I didn't, I didn't
891040	896800	really quite get grasped the question because you know what? I am a raging fan of Earthbound. It's
896800	901440	my favorite game of all time. I don't know if you've noticed, but it's in the Super Nintendo
901440	906400	in this video's artwork, you know, that, that is my game. And I had to think about it for a minute.
907120	914160	And I realized it's because Earthbound is a game primarily about childhood and it's bright and
914160	920080	colorful. And it, it really hearkens back to a kid growing up in the nineties. But at the same time,
920080	925920	it's also a very serious game. When push comes to shove, that game is not afraid to thematically
925920	930880	throw down with the best of the adult games, even though it's definitely a game made for kids. And
930880	936240	then I began to think like we have, okay, the stereotype of the 30 year old soy boy with the
936240	942240	giant mouth as he holds his Nintendo switch, you know, Bing Bing wahoo. There's definitely
942240	947760	a market for stuff that looks like it's made for kids, but adults consume it.
948960	953680	That includes Earthbound. That includes Mario. That definitely includes limited run games and
953680	958880	most of their catalog. It includes a lot of indie games. And I had to mull over this a little bit,
958880	964160	but I think if I had to give an answer to that initial question, it would be that these things
964160	970240	attract SJWs basically because SJWs haven't grown up. And I don't know what that says about me
970240	975520	because these things also attract me. And yet I don't necessarily consider myself to be an SJW.
975520	980240	And I'm definitely not somebody who is consistently childish all the time. You know,
980240	984880	we all have our childish tendencies. We all have those moments where we kind of revert to a very
984880	989600	enthusiastic 12 year old when something special comes along. Maybe it's just a difference between
990720	993920	people clinging to their childhood because they don't feel like they have any kind of
993920	998960	serious future and people appreciating their childhood for what it was. And then maybe
998960	1004640	part of maturity is learning how to synthesize your current self with your past self rather
1004640	1008560	than simply overindulging it constantly. I don't know. Maybe I'm rambling a little
1008560	1013440	bit too much for this video. In any case, limited run game sucks. Don't buy from them ever again.
1014320	1016880	Fuck them. I'll talk to you guys later. I love you.
