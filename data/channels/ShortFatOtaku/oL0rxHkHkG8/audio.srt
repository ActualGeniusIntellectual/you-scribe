1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,320
People have been asking me for a while now, when am I going to talk about Limited Run Games?

2
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:09,920
I guess the answer to that is today. Now for those of you who don't know, Limited Run Games

3
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:16,000
is a company that releases physical copies of normally digital only games. So usually we're

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,640
talking indie games or games released by small studios or games released with a limited run,

5
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:25,760
which is why they're called Limited Run Games. I actually really appreciate their service because

6
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:31,440
frankly, considering how the Wii shop went offline recently, the DS shop went offline

7
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:36,480
a few years ago, eventually all of these stores that I've bought online games on will go offline.

8
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:41,520
I don't think Steam's going anywhere on PC, but if it's a console and it's a store,

9
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:45,440
I think they'll be disappearing eventually. Which means that all those games that we've all bought,

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,800
they're disappearing too. But if you buy them from Limited Run Games, then you have a physical copy.

11
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:55,280
No problem. So I think there's definitely a niche in the market for a company like Limited Run

12
00:00:55,280 --> 00:01:00,160
Games. And I also think that they're doing a pretty good service in terms of preserving games

13
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:04,560
that might in the future disappear unless you pirate them or something. At the same time,

14
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:10,560
it also seems to be common knowledge that Limited Run Games is staffed by purple haired SJWs.

15
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:16,080
Unfortunately, you guys remember when this happened? THQ Nordic holds AMA on image board

16
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:22,160
known for child porn. They're talking about 8chan, by the way, and 8chan wasn't really known

17
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:26,000
for child porn. They did their best to stamp that shit out. It's the same as the mainstream

18
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,520
media calling Gab a hate speech platform or an alt-right platform, even though places like

19
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:36,880
Twitter and Facebook also have hate speech and also serve the alt-right. Today, Darksiders

20
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:43,040
publisher THQ Nordic opted to host an Ask Me Anything AMA session to offer its audience an

21
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:47,600
opportunity to have questions about its business and games answered. This would be utterly

22
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:54,400
unremarkable had it not opted to host said AMA on 8chan, an image board known for not-safe-for-work

23
00:01:54,400 --> 00:02:00,080
content of all kinds, including hate speech, child pornography, harassment, and abuse.

24
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:06,160
Yeah, see, one of those things is not like the other. But yeah, THQ Nordic said we're doing an

25
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:11,040
8chan AMA and we have no idea why. Come join us. So they posted it on V and they say,

26
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:15,040
the opportunity was here and we took it. We got approached in a very friendly and polite manner

27
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:19,360
and were assured said person would take care of the nasty stuff. So here we are.

28
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:24,960
So yeah, they saw a form, it might have been an anonymous form, but they saw a popular form

29
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:28,880
devoted to video games and said, you know what, we're releasing a Darksiders game, let's do an

30
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:34,000
AMA about it. Well, where does Limited Run Games come into this? Well, as it turns out,

31
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:41,440
around the same time as this 8chan AMA, Limited Run Games has been partnered with THQ Nordic

32
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:46,080
to bring the game Red Faction to physical format for the PlayStation 4. It's not even the same

33
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:50,560
game, it wasn't a Darksiders game, it was Red Faction. But nonetheless, this earned the ire

34
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:56,400
of the idiots over at Reset Era. And posting on Reset Era, Limited Run Games' official account

35
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:01,760
said, to be clear, we are overjoyed to bring Red Faction to physical format. Agreed that it was

36
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:06,320
bad wording for the tweet and for that we apologize, it should have been clear. We are not

37
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:11,760
overjoyed with THQ Nordic's AMA on 8chan, to say the least, and in no way endorse it.

38
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:17,840
Now, the screeching crybabies on Reset Era are not the main audience of a company like

39
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:22,800
Limited Run Games, but because they're ideologically aligned, that's who they bow to.

40
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:28,480
Oh, by the way, in case you need some evidence of what kind of place Reset Era is, this person

41
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:35,360
got banned for a series of insincere drive-by posts across multiple related threads.

42
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:40,480
And what he said was, do we have any indication of price or release date yet?

43
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:44,800
What this person actually did was, in these various threads on Reset Era about Limited

44
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:50,320
Run Games and THQ Nordic, he refused to jump on the cancel culture bandwagon

45
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:54,640
and simply asked about the games. He was an outrage, so he was banned.

46
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:59,680
Now, I personally see no problem with a company like THQ Nordic, or any other company,

47
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:05,840
running an AMA on a place like 8chan, or 4chan, or reddit, or twitter, or anywhere else. In my

48
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:11,360
opinion, it's just a forum to talk to fans. The idea that you shouldn't utilize a site

49
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:17,120
because of some kind of political affiliation that is completely unrelated to your own business

50
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:21,920
is just absurd to me. But I mean, here we are, welcome to 2019.

51
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:27,600
The pressure wasn't just on from Limited Run Games or the SJWs over at Reset Era, however.

52
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,800
Here's a Shannon Loftus working for Microsoft Studios,

53
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:34,960
tweeting at THQ Nordic, why do you still have this link up?

54
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:38,000
Know your place, pleb. Get back in your lane.

55
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,960
I think what really pissed everyone off, though, was the fact that even though THQ Nordic came out

56
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:48,160
and apologized under all that pressure, during that actual AMA on 8chan, you can tell the person

57
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:51,200
who did it was kinda shitlord-y. It was pretty fun.

58
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:56,000
Here's my old acquaintance, Brad Brown, of the webcomics Blaster Nation and Rockcocks,

59
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:02,160
also the 4chan v. Tripfag of old, Donkey Kong. Now, I talked about him during my video, Who I

60
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:08,240
Miss, as being an old friend who I've lost to Trump Derangement Syndrome. And I do say former

61
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:14,640
acquaintance at this point, because since I made that video, He's blocked me. So very quickly,

62
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:18,960
he blocked me because he makes porn comics, and I made the argument to him that

63
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:25,280
being somebody who produces NSFW content, he should probably be more respectful of free speech

64
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:29,440
rights than he actually is, because free speech rights is the only thing standing between him

65
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:33,920
and unemployment. But I guess since free speech is a conservative position nowadays or something,

66
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:37,360
he blocked me for it. So, that's the final end of that friendship.

67
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:43,120
But anyway, back during the whole AMA, he says, THQ Nordic, or at least their PR guy,

68
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:47,680
has issued an apology saying they didn't do their research and don't condone the things

69
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:54,000
that 8chan openly celebrates. Here's their actual posts from their AMA. Don't buy that shit for a

70
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:59,920
second. This is the guy, this is the guy who used to revel in 4chan culture. And now that he's had

71
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:05,200
his kicks, and he's grown up a little bit, now he's poo-pooing everybody else who engages in it.

72
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:08,960
It's kind of like the hippies who smoke weed, and then when they're in their 40s and 50s tell

73
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:13,200
their kids not to smoke weed and they become like super puritans. It's weird, man.

74
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:18,240
Anyway, because Brad is now an SJW cuck, unfortunately, he links to Patrick Klepek,

75
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:22,960
who has provided these four screenshots of that THQ AMA.

76
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:27,360
Please don't censor any games nor appeal to the social justice crowd. You guys are doing fine

77
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:32,480
as is. Thanks, we'll try to stay that way. Admitting that the SJWs are encroaching on

78
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:37,200
gaming and saying that you will resist at all costs? I guess that's worth shaming them

79
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:44,240
publicly for. Where's the big titty lollies at? You got them already, we'd say. Oh no,

80
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:50,640
this is the absolute worst crime you could possibly commit. You know, post a picture

81
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:58,000
of two girls, who are clothed by the way, and then they reply with just a nonsense, nothing reply,

82
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:04,240
other than public condemnation and shaming and oh, how dare you? THQ didn't clutch their pearls

83
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:10,560
hard enough. Yeah, Brad, I have no idea how you can endorse this. You draw porn, for fuck's sake.

84
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:15,760
But back on the main point, Limited Run Games ended up throwing THQ Nordic under the bus

85
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:20,960
when Cancel Culture came for them, unfortunately, because, you know, I like Limited Run Games. I

86
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:26,160
have a copy on PS4 of Night Trap. I really enjoyed the fact that they announced all of the old Star

87
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:31,600
Wars games, like the N64 Shadows of the Empire, other games like that, to be, to be coming to

88
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:35,920
Limited Run Games. You know, they've done some pretty good work. But, you know, I kind of forgot

89
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:41,440
about them until this. This just went down like yesterday. Limited Run Games cancelled a customer's

90
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:47,280
orders, refunded his money, and banned him. Here's why. On November 20th, 2019, it was brought to the

91
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:53,600
attention of Jeremy Hambley, aka The Quartering, aka My Guy, that Limited Run Games had cancelled

92
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:59,920
a fan named Brybot's orders, refunded his money, and banned this customer from ordering future

93
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:05,040
games. Jeremy went ahead and put the information he was sent together and made a video blasting

94
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:09,200
Limited Run Games for their behaviour. I have actually watched this video, in fact. After

95
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:13,760
speaking with several people who were in the same Facebook groups as Brybot, I can 100% say that he

96
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:18,960
did in fact get banned, had his orders cancelled, and was refunded. That is not being disputed by

97
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:24,240
anyone. However, the why is not because of a meme like Jeremy Hambley states in his video, but

98
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:29,760
rather for spreading false information. Let's look at the facts. So the story as I understand it,

99
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:36,880
this person named Brybot was posting memes to I think a fan Facebook group that was run by

100
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:40,640
Limited Run Games or Limited Run Games was involved, it was about them or something,

101
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:47,040
and an employee named Sarah from Limited Run Games, she decides to post saying,

102
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:55,680
I enjoy trolling as much as the next guy, but just a heads up guys, spreading false info and

103
00:08:55,680 --> 00:09:02,720
using company assets is likely to get you banned, if not worse. Uh oh. So what did they actually do?

104
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:07,280
So this guy, Brybot, he made a meme, which is what the courting asserted in his video.

105
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:11,280
Now the actual situation is that Limited Run Games is releasing Tetris Effect,

106
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:17,360
and that's not really an indie game, it's not really a game that needs the clout of a company

107
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:22,720
like Limited Run Games. So the joke is that, well, if they're not releasing games that require

108
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:28,080
Limited Run, if they're not releasing games that are indie, why not make it Skyrim? You know?

109
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:34,560
So he photoshopped it to be Skyrim. Why not make it another game called Return of the Bird King?

110
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:39,600
Well, here it is, he photoshopped that one too. This is a meme. I know the writer of this article

111
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:43,760
said that he wasn't banned for memes, he was banned for, what was it, for spreading false

112
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:50,240
information, but I mean, come on. Yeah, the information in this meme is obviously false,

113
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:54,240
so I guess that's technically true, but it's still a meme, it's still a joke,

114
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:59,360
it's still clowning on Limited Run Games. But that was enough to get Brybot banned,

115
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:06,160
and to have all of his orders refunded by Limited Run Games. And then that same person, Sarah,

116
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:11,840
decides to post this on the Facebook group. Dude, you got banned for exactly the reasons I warned

117
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:16,800
you about. I tried, shrug, but yeah, your orders were refunded from what I can see.

118
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:21,040
Usually takes three to five days to post back to whatever the original payment method was.

119
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:25,040
Honestly, if I were you, I'd leave it, because if you keep pushing, you'll likely light a fire

120
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:29,360
under our lawyer's ass. There's a difference between free speech and fragrant misinformation.

121
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:36,240
What a fucking asshole, dude. Like, this is wild. Imagine when, like, the big Chungus meme came out,

122
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:39,920
you know, like the really fat Bugs Bunny? Warner Brothers showed up and said, ah,

123
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:44,080
don't you go posting that meme, because you know what? It uses our original assets,

124
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:48,960
it uses our company material, so you know what? That's flagrant misinformation.

125
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:53,120
So the author of this article was technically right, and that, yeah, he was spreading false

126
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:59,920
information, but it was, like, knowingly false. It was obviously false, you know? When, like,

127
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:04,480
some terrible comedian shows up on late night TV or whatever, and they're wearing, like, an orange

128
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:09,120
wig, and they do, like, a really bad Trump impression, and they pretend to be Donald Trump,

129
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:14,080
and they say all this ridiculous shit, no one thinks that's actually Donald Trump.

130
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:18,240
We all know that it's a parody, because that's the context of the joke, is that it's a parody.

131
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:22,800
It looks like the original thing, because that's what makes it funny. So no, it is a meme,

132
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:28,720
and this is Limited Run Games getting pissed at customers for making memes about them.

133
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:32,880
And he goes ahead, and he shows off these refunded, refunded, refunded things, you know?

134
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:37,280
Now, you have to ask, how do we know that these are real, and not just him getting refunds

135
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:41,760
himself? How do you know he's not just faking all these screenshots and, and drumming it all up?

136
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:48,720
Well, as it turns out, while I was recording this video, this just happened. From Twitter user

137
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:55,600
WolfDaddyTX, it's been 13 months since you forked over money. Yeah, it's on us to fulfill our end

138
00:11:55,600 --> 00:12:00,080
of the contract, but since you want to use consumer protection laws against predators like us,

139
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:05,920
we'll just ban you and sue you. And he's talking about Limited Run Games. This tweet was sent,

140
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:11,600
let's just see here. It was sent about a half hour ago, at least in terms of this recording. Jesus.

141
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:16,320
Let's read this ticket thread of his. Hello, I would like to request a cancellation for this

142
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:21,120
order, as it's now been 13 months since I paid this order, and there seems to be no clear

143
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:25,280
indication from the developers when it will be ready for manufacture. I've since lost interest

144
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:29,680
in owning this game, so I would like to request a full refund of my order, including the shipping

145
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:36,480
costs. Now, in my opinion, that's fair, frankly, if you buy something and it hasn't shipped in 13

146
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:41,440
months in over a year, get your money back. Yeah. Then here's a Limited Run Games reply.

147
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:48,640
Hi, unfortunately, per our policy in our FAQ, all sales are considered final. We are unable to

148
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:54,320
cancel or do a partial refund of your order. Link to this below. I do apologize for the inconvenience.

149
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:59,440
Well, this confirms that Limited Run Games doesn't actually do refunds. It is a long standing policy

150
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:05,200
that no refunds are allowed. So I guess that previous guy who has refunds must have come

151
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:10,400
from them. There's no way he got them himself. But anyway, our friend here replies, as per Australian

152
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:15,920
consumer law, when a business accepts your payment for products or services, they must supply them to

153
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:20,800
you within the timeframe they have indicated, or if no timeframe was specified within a reasonable

154
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:25,280
time. Please, I'd prefer not to have to pursue legal action. I'd like a full refund. And then

155
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:30,160
Limited Run Games replies with, if you try any legal action, you will be banned from ordering

156
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:35,920
us again. Wow. Take your money. Don't deliver the product. And then when you bring up that that's,

157
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:41,520
you know, illegal, they just tell you to fuck off. I have contacted the ACCC, and we'll get

158
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:49,600
back to you once I've received further advice. And then he just says, sure. Wow. Okay. Limited

159
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:54,080
Run Games is a piece of shit company. You know, if it was just one, you know, one bad event,

160
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:57,840
I would understand it, you know, we all have bad days. But this has now become a pattern of

161
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:01,840
behavior. And it's honestly quite disgusting at this point. You know, this is a company that I

162
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:06,320
had some serious respect for. I've, I've dropped some money on their products in the past, not

163
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:10,880
nearly as much as Jeremy. Holy shit, dude. I don't know if you're watching this quartering, but I saw

164
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:14,720
that collection years. That's a bit nuts. I like the iconic class, but not that much. But yeah,

165
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:20,880
we are at the point where it just seems like this company is not only run by SJWs. It's run

166
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:25,840
by completely disingenuous people who will shank their own customers in the back for a buck.

167
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:30,160
You know, I'm recording this a day before it comes out. I'm recording in the evening

168
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:35,120
of last night, in fact. And earlier tonight, I was streaming on Game Boomers, Shenmue 3,

169
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:40,240
which is by the way, a game that I am enjoying very much. But somebody came into the chat room

170
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:46,080
and said, Hey, hey, Dev, why is it that all the fans of Earthbound are all, they all seem to be

171
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:51,040
raging SJWs? And I didn't really have a serious answer for him. You know, I didn't, I didn't

172
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:56,800
really quite get grasped the question because you know what? I am a raging fan of Earthbound. It's

173
00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:01,440
my favorite game of all time. I don't know if you've noticed, but it's in the Super Nintendo

174
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:06,400
in this video's artwork, you know, that, that is my game. And I had to think about it for a minute.

175
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:14,160
And I realized it's because Earthbound is a game primarily about childhood and it's bright and

176
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:20,080
colorful. And it, it really hearkens back to a kid growing up in the nineties. But at the same time,

177
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:25,920
it's also a very serious game. When push comes to shove, that game is not afraid to thematically

178
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:30,880
throw down with the best of the adult games, even though it's definitely a game made for kids. And

179
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:36,240
then I began to think like we have, okay, the stereotype of the 30 year old soy boy with the

180
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:42,240
giant mouth as he holds his Nintendo switch, you know, Bing Bing wahoo. There's definitely

181
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:47,760
a market for stuff that looks like it's made for kids, but adults consume it.

182
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:53,680
That includes Earthbound. That includes Mario. That definitely includes limited run games and

183
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:58,880
most of their catalog. It includes a lot of indie games. And I had to mull over this a little bit,

184
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:04,160
but I think if I had to give an answer to that initial question, it would be that these things

185
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:10,240
attract SJWs basically because SJWs haven't grown up. And I don't know what that says about me

186
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:15,520
because these things also attract me. And yet I don't necessarily consider myself to be an SJW.

187
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:20,240
And I'm definitely not somebody who is consistently childish all the time. You know,

188
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:24,880
we all have our childish tendencies. We all have those moments where we kind of revert to a very

189
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:29,600
enthusiastic 12 year old when something special comes along. Maybe it's just a difference between

190
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:33,920
people clinging to their childhood because they don't feel like they have any kind of

191
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:38,960
serious future and people appreciating their childhood for what it was. And then maybe

192
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:44,640
part of maturity is learning how to synthesize your current self with your past self rather

193
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:48,560
than simply overindulging it constantly. I don't know. Maybe I'm rambling a little

194
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:53,440
bit too much for this video. In any case, limited run game sucks. Don't buy from them ever again.

195
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:56,880
Fuck them. I'll talk to you guys later. I love you.
