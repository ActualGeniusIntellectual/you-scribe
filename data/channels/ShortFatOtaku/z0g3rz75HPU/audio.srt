1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,560
Hey guys, Dev here.

2
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:19,260
I'm a bit sick, everyone here is right now, but I think I'm well enough to get through

3
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:20,580
doing this video.

4
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:25,360
For our first new Indefensible video since September, we decided to just dip our toes

5
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:27,600
into the waters of Gamergate at first.

6
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:31,680
There will be more investigative videos in the future, but for now I think it's important

7
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:35,040
to discuss where we are and what we should be doing.

8
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:39,960
Everybody remembers Internet aristocrat's self-destruction on his way out of Gamergate.

9
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:44,160
I know it's a bit old, but I'd like to address a few of his points.

10
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:48,600
And to be frank with you, the whole Gamergate thing is depressing.

11
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:53,960
It was the opportunity to finally kick the teeth in of social justice warriors and tumblorettes

12
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:58,940
and draw a fucking line in the sand and push back against all these hypersensitive cunts.

13
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:02,280
And for a while it was working really, really well.

14
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:03,980
All you had to do was attack.

15
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:05,800
Now I'm going to use an analogy here.

16
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:10,780
I understand there's a major difference in scale, like millions of orders of magnitude

17
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:14,960
difference in scale, but the basic social mechanisms are identical.

18
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:20,080
When you have, say, a nation undergoing social upheaval, the social structure is generally

19
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:25,180
made up of elites at the top, running government and society, and the mass of common people

20
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:29,900
at the bottom, living within a social system that does not benefit them.

21
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:35,720
This division is primarily class-based, but is commonly, but not always, also racially

22
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:39,820
based, gender-based, religious-based, or ethnically based.

23
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:44,760
When commoners rise up against social power, there's three ways for it to end.

24
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:49,400
One, the elites come down hard on the people and their strength ends the revolt.

25
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:52,560
This generally leads to more oppression than before.

26
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,580
Two, reformation.

27
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:58,920
The people work within the current system and fix it to be more fair and just.

28
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,820
Three, revolution.

29
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:05,460
The people determine that the old system cannot be reformed, and they must build a new one

30
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:10,120
to take its place, and in the case of a nation, this often requires armed conflict.

31
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:14,800
However, when the commoners are unwilling to take option three, even when option two

32
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:20,380
has been exhausted, like we've recently seen in Egypt during the Arab Spring, for example,

33
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:22,400
inevitably option one is what will happen.

34
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:28,540
Now, let me reiterate, Gamergate is obviously not a cause worth taking up arms for, nor

35
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:33,200
would any good actually come of it if some deranged lunatic did actually do that.

36
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:37,340
However, the social structure and the forces within are still the same.

37
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:42,720
When Internet aristocrat says, all you had to do was attack, he's saying, keep up option

38
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:43,720
two.

39
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:44,720
Eventually.

40
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:45,900
But it won't.

41
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:50,820
All a corrupt government has to do to avoid non-violent protests is to hole up behind

42
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:55,440
their walls, and all a corrupt publication has to do is circle their wagons.

43
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:59,660
We have proven journalists to be corrupt, and their bosses would rather protect their

44
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:03,800
corrupt employees instead of step up and do what ethics would require of them.

45
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:08,960
We have proven entire publications to be corrupt, and they simply wear it as armor.

46
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:13,340
You cannot just keep attacking and expect the system to suddenly see the reason in your

47
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:15,360
point of view and reform itself.

48
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:20,160
Your just keep attacking mentality seems more like something from a 4chan raid designed

49
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:24,080
to troll everybody rather than actually doing something constructive.

50
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:29,520
For Gamergate, option three, that is, tearing down the old system and building a new one

51
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:34,920
in its place, is our only course of action, with special emphasis on building a new one

52
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:35,920
in its place.

53
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:40,800
It is not enough to just drive Gawker bankrupt or run Destructoid out of business, though

54
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,480
that is an important step.

55
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:45,980
Despite what naysayers may be throwing around, we are doing just that.

56
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:49,580
There's an article on Clocked that talks about traffic numbers of the relevant websites

57
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:50,860
in greater detail.

58
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:55,140
Alexa numbers for these publications since Gamergate began do show a lot of decreases

59
00:03:55,140 --> 00:04:01,180
in activity, but also some increases, leading many people, most famously Angry Joe of all

60
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:05,420
individuals, to believe that Gamergate is having no effect of the traffic of these sites

61
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:22,480
and is largely a violent, misogynistic vocal minority.

62
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:29,440
Even though a statistical analysis, run by Chris von Svalve, has shown that Gamergate

63
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:35,020
is most likely a movement made up of over 150,000 individuals, with only a dozen or

64
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:38,420
so of them actually sending violent or threatening messages.

65
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:42,300
The discovery of which got him sent death threats by people opposed to Gamergate, by

66
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:43,300
the way.

67
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:47,300
However, the Clocked article describes in detail how using Alexa numbers, the way most

68
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:50,780
of us have been thus far, pro or anti, is flawed.

69
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:55,460
I'll let you read it yourself, but basically the bounce rate of these websites, that is,

70
00:04:55,460 --> 00:05:00,520
the people who immediately leave a site upon opening it up, has been rising consistently,

71
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:04,480
for all publications since Gamergate began, while the numbers of consistent readers has

72
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:06,040
been steadily decreasing.

73
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:09,280
To me, this sounds like more and more people who are getting clickbaited into reading an

74
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:14,500
article on Kotaku or something are noticing where that link brought them and immediately

75
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:15,760
are leaving.

76
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:21,360
So yes, we are hurting them, they are losing money, and we are succeeding, and it's necessary

77
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:25,440
that all efforts regarding the boycott of these unethical publications continue.

78
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:30,280
Now at the risk of alienating a lot of you, this is why I believe in social justice.

79
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:36,360
Not what Tumblr or Twitter thinks social justice is, not what SJWs or SRS cultists scream about.

80
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:41,740
I promise you, when somebody's Twitter profile says social justice warrior or social justice

81
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:45,440
dog or whatever, they don't know what social justice is.

82
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:49,680
Social justice is, in essence, the process of reform and revolution.

83
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:53,600
It's when the common people realize the elites have set up a social system in which commoners

84
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,320
are exploited and elites are advantaged.

85
00:05:56,320 --> 00:06:01,360
This can be nationwide, this can be within a small community, it can be within a subculture.

86
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,400
That is the mechanism by which social justice is achieved.

87
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,280
And this is what Gamergate is doing.

88
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:08,320
Remember my criteria from earlier in this video?

89
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:12,160
There is a social system in which a group of elites are privileged, and they all help

90
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,760
maintain each other's privilege.

91
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:16,400
The game journal pros list seems to fit that bill.

92
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:20,400
The elites are largely divided from us among class lines.

93
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:24,720
But with most game journals and developers within the elite group being able to afford

94
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:28,840
living in the more expensive urban centers in North America, with many of them being

95
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:33,840
trust fund babies, they are also divided from us along lines of race as well, most of them

96
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:34,840
being white.

97
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:39,620
Tearing down their ivory tower and building a system more equitable to all is the core

98
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:41,920
tenet of actual social justice.

99
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:45,720
In fact, this is what Smash the Patriarchy originally meant.

100
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:50,320
Second Wave feminists knew they couldn't simply smash the patriarchy without constructing

101
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:52,660
a more equitable system to take its place.

102
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:56,320
But Third Wave feminists are only interested in the destruction, completely leaving the

103
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:57,840
reconstructing out of it.

104
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:01,840
This is how I know that when people like Maya Kramer show up with their cuties killing video

105
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:06,480
games merchandise, or when Lea Alexander and whoever else talks about gamers being dead

106
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:10,360
or over, they fundamentally don't understand social justice.

107
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:14,000
Because they're only interested in the killing, in hurting other people, in tearing things

108
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
down.

109
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,840
They don't recognize that feminism requires building anew as well.

110
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:23,320
They glorify destruction and spurn any reconstructive efforts that would lead to lasting equality.

111
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:28,120
In short, Gamergate is actually performing the actions that social justice and feminism

112
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:31,760
require for a social revolution to take place within the subculture of gaming.

113
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:35,160
And I think this is the main reason why we have received so much pushback.

114
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:39,820
The establishment, the elites, the journals and the developers talk all day about social

115
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:42,320
justice but don't actually do anything about it.

116
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:46,400
And when us, the common people, the people without class privilege come along and try

117
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:51,320
to do actual social justice, they fight us, because they know in terms of actual social

118
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:53,720
justice, they're the oppressor.

119
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:57,200
Internet aristocrat was right about just one thing.

120
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,840
We can't be like them.

121
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:01,360
We can't simply tear down and not rebuild.

122
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:05,680
However, rebuilding an entirely new framework takes time, energy, and frankly money.

123
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:08,000
I don't know what you expect when you say this.

124
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,600
Go look at the people who are prominent figures right now in Gamergate, and see how many

125
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:15,680
of them have Indiegogo campaigns, how many of them have Kickstarter campaigns, how many

126
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:20,720
of them have Patreons, how many have ad revenue on their fucking videos.

127
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,160
Everybody's making a buck.

128
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:26,600
Do you think people should just build a completely alternate system of games journalism and travel

129
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:29,880
to events and report on news all for free?

130
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:30,880
No.

131
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:32,840
The truth of it is we must all pitch in.

132
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:37,200
It is not enough to boycott Gawker and Destructoid on RPS and Gamasutra.

133
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,960
We also need to frequent sites with actual ethical standards.

134
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:43,760
Everybody's talking about TechRaptor right now due to the Pinsauf interview.

135
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:47,400
NewsNosh and NicheGamer were held up at the beginning of Gamergate as being some of

136
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:50,520
the only websites willing to even allow discussion of it.

137
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:55,280
Do you want to see these sites grow in size and staff and viewership to be the new replacements

138
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:57,520
for the old corrupt publications?

139
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:59,680
That takes money and patronage, man.

140
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:03,760
BasedGamer is another great example of this, of people within Gamergate coming together

141
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:08,040
to create a Rotten Tomatoes-style aggregator, something that games journalism desperately

142
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:09,040
needs.

143
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:12,960
On one of IA's streams, of which I was a part of actually, Milo said to all of us

144
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:17,600
that people within Gamergate should consider creating an independent body to judge the

145
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:22,120
ethical practices of all games journalism publications on an annual basis, similar to

146
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:24,460
the one that exists within the mainstream media.

147
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:26,740
It is not enough to tear down the old systems.

148
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:28,920
We also must build their replacements.

149
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:31,460
And it's not enough to simply wish for it to happen.

150
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:33,960
We have to be willing to do it by our own hands.

151
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:37,680
Speaking of Angry Joe, his video was actually pretty fair, but there are a few things I'd

152
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:38,680
like to talk about.

153
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:42,920
He mentions early on that you can be for ethics in journalism and not be a part of Gamergate.

154
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:47,120
You can be for gaming ethics, I have been for gaming ethics, TotalBiscuit has been for

155
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:52,960
gaming ethics before the creation of the Gamergate hashtag, and we will be after.

156
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:59,400
You can be for gaming ethics without self-identifying with a stupid hashtag on Twitter.

157
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:03,520
I suppose that's true, in much the same way that you can be for gender equality and not

158
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:04,580
be a feminist.

159
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:08,800
This is mostly a semantic point, but I've always thought semantic points are actually

160
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:12,920
very important, because use of labels shows how we see the world.

161
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:16,600
A feminist, by the dictionary definition, is somebody who believes in gender equality.

162
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:29,320
Therefore, if you believe in gender equality, you are a feminist.

163
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:33,440
A person who believes in gender equality, but says I'm not a feminist, is technically

164
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:37,800
a feminist by definition, but wants to avoid being associated with a political group called

165
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:38,800
feminism.

166
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,840
I think Angry Joe is in this camp.

167
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,840
He believes in ethical journalism.

168
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:44,240
He thinks corruption is bad.

169
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:46,820
By that definition, that makes him a gamergator.

170
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:48,840
But he says he's neutral to gamergate.

171
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:53,480
His ideas on the topic align with gamergate the philosophy, but he has no desire to be

172
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:55,720
part of gamergate the political movement.

173
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:59,160
I know some people have seen this as cowardly or whatever, but I think it's fine.

174
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:01,640
I think this actually describes the vast majority of gamers.

175
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:04,940
And Joe, I'm a fan, and as much as I like your videos, I gotta correct a few things

176
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:05,940
you've said here.

177
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:13,660
Zoe Quinn, a female developer, her angry, jealous boyfriend fucking put all their dirty

178
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:19,220
laundry on the internet, just completely fucking doxxed all of her information, and accused

179
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:24,780
her of sleeping and cheating with numerous guys, and she confirmed it as well, sleeping

180
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:25,780
with a few other people.

181
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:27,860
Aaron didn't actually doxx anybody.

182
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:31,500
He put up their relationship drama, sure, and it's within his rights to do so no matter

183
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:33,020
what anybody thinks of it.

184
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:37,740
On a personal level, the Zoe post described a person who was emotionally abused in their

185
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:41,020
relationship, describing the abuse he suffered at the hands of his abuser.

186
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:45,420
Like you said, that's ultimately not our business, but when you go to a subreddit like Raised

187
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:50,300
by Narcissists, where children describe how their parents abused them, that's also not

188
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:54,460
anybody else's business, but people willingly provide their story.

189
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:59,500
Victims of abuse often find some comfort and healing in recounting their story.

190
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:04,340
However, Aaron didn't put up Zoe's address, a real name, or her porn pics, or anything

191
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:05,340
like that.

192
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:08,900
Other people did a whois on her website to see who it was registered to, and somebody

193
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:12,700
on 4chan spent the 10 bucks and bought her porn pics legally.

194
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:42,620
Saying that Aaron did that is just inaccurate.

195
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:59,820
Individuals within gamergate are largely left-wing and anti-authoritarian, which goes

196
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:04,860
to show just how far gamers were pushed when they all went flocking to the right-wing press

197
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:09,140
to receive actual coverage of gamergate, since those publications were the only ones willing

198
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:10,780
to tell the entire story.

199
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:14,400
It's no surprise that left-wingers will generally stick around left-wing publications to get

200
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:19,020
their news, but when left-wing authoritarians in charge of these outlets begin assassinating

201
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:24,940
their own left-wing anti-authoritarian fanbases for not falling in line, they drove them right

202
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:28,420
into the waiting arms of far-right extremists.

203
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:32,860
Gamergate became so viciously polarized, not because of right-wingers like Adam Baldwin

204
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:33,860
or Milo.

205
00:13:33,860 --> 00:14:02,140
It was because the left tried to eat itself.

206
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:05,980
Asking for proof of unsubstantiated claims isn't a bad thing.

207
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:08,100
This photo is not a conspiracy theory, dude.

208
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:11,940
Brianna talks constantly about being forced to leave her house when she didn't actually

209
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:15,520
go anywhere, and that's something you just sort of hand-wave in your video.

210
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:20,820
Any name in gamergate, big or small, including myself, rejects the harassment of these people

211
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:23,100
whether done in our name or not.

212
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:26,900
But you act like questioning some of their more outrageous claims is tantamount to a

213
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:29,980
conspiracy theory when it's really just good practices.

214
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:34,620
Anyway, Joe, I doubt you'll see this, but if you end up watching it someday, don't

215
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:36,100
take this as an attack on you.

216
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:40,200
I think your video is mostly pretty fair, and I recommend everybody else go see it if

217
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,200
they haven't already.

218
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,540
I'll end the video off with this.

219
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:48,260
Eric Kane wrote an article entitled What Gamergate is Actually About, that I think best describes

220
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:52,500
what gamergate is, and in doing so highlights exactly where gamergate needs to go.

221
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:57,100
According to him, gamergate is not entirely a consumer movement, nor is it entirely about

222
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:58,100
ethics.

223
00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:03,600
It's not a hate group, it's not about anti-SJWs, and it's not about conservativism in video

224
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:04,600
games either.

225
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:08,540
Rather, it's about a toxic relationship that's formed between the video game press and gamers

226
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:12,760
themselves, one that's been bubbling and brewing for years, not months.

227
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:14,540
This is the core of the issue.

228
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:16,900
Gaming is fundamentally a meritocracy.

229
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:19,340
Nothing matters aside from how well you do at the game.

230
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:23,540
Even if somebody sends you a slur over Xbox Live because you're a girl who's wrecking

231
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:28,060
their shit, at the end of the match it'll be you at the top of the scoreboard, not them.

232
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:30,220
Even in development it's a meritocracy.

233
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:34,380
Women have been part of some of the best games to ever come out in the past 30 years.

234
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:39,060
Nobody took a look at Mega Man or Bayonetta or Castlevania or Street Fighter or Mario

235
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:45,020
RPG or any of the other billions of games that women have worked on and said, oh wow,

236
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:47,060
those games are worse because women help make them.

237
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:48,460
No, nobody gives a shit.

238
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:49,900
It's based on the merit of the game.

239
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:53,580
The current elite at the top of the social structure, the journalists and developers

240
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:56,500
in their clique, they're left-wing authoritarians.

241
00:15:56,500 --> 00:16:01,180
They ultimately want the gaming space to be run not on meritocracy, but rather on their

242
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:02,180
autocracy.

243
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:05,620
They don't care about getting women into games, they care about getting their women

244
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:06,660
into games.

245
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:09,900
They don't care about giving exposure to indie devs, they care about giving exposure

246
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:11,900
to their indie devs.

247
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:17,100
This has been proven time and again with biased coverage, illegal blacklists and rigged award

248
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:18,100
shows.

249
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:19,100
Eric was right.

250
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:22,380
There's a toxic relationship between the people who play games and people who report

251
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:23,380
on games.

252
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:26,060
And it's been building up for far longer than Gamergate's been around.

253
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:30,520
The toxic relationship began because gamers value competition and merit, while the journalists

254
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:35,180
wanted to control the message we receive with an iron fist instead of simply allowing merit

255
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:36,980
to bubble to the surface.

256
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:41,620
Just as I would tell somebody being abused in their relationship that they need to escape

257
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:45,580
from their authoritarian partner and find a safe space to heal, all people who play

258
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:50,660
video games need to leave these publications behind and rebuild our safe space where we

259
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:52,580
can freely be gamers again.

260
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:54,700
Because make no mistake, they're trying to take that from us.

261
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:58,180
They commonly say, oh we don't want to take away your games, we just want to diversify

262
00:16:58,180 --> 00:16:59,420
games.

263
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:00,800
Don't believe them.

264
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:04,100
Diversifying games is good, and there are games that have been improved by its diverse

265
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:05,140
cast.

266
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:06,740
But this isn't their goal.

267
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:11,580
As soon as they got even the smallest semblance of a foothold, they moved to try and get games

268
00:17:11,580 --> 00:17:16,180
like HuniePop kicked off Steam due to their subjective, sexist idea of what offensive

269
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:17,780
content is.

270
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:21,640
Diversifying games is good, and they talk about it, but it's not their goal.

271
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:24,060
Their goal is banning games they disapprove of.

272
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:28,540
But this is the future of Gamergate, abandoning the corrupt publications, boycotting them,

273
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:32,300
spreading the word about their practices, and rebuilding gaming again from the ground

274
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:37,680
up with new developers, new journalists, new ways to talk about games, ways that benefit

275
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:39,660
all of us, not just the privileged few.

276
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:43,960
Anyway, I know this video has meandered quite a bit, it's our channel's first real posting

277
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:47,980
on Gamergate in months, and I wanted to cover a number of topics that we sort of missed.

278
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:51,900
Camera's working on a more investigative style video discussing The Escapist, which should

279
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:55,540
be out in just over a week or so, so I hope you'll stick around and check it out.

280
00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:59,260
Because I'm a shill, feel free to check out our other videos we do as well.

281
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:00,260
I hope you like them.

282
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:03,540
And I hope you liked this.

283
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:04,340
See you later, guys.
