WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:14.560
Hey guys, Dev here.

00:14.560 --> 00:19.260
I'm a bit sick, everyone here is right now, but I think I'm well enough to get through

00:19.260 --> 00:20.580
doing this video.

00:20.580 --> 00:25.360
For our first new Indefensible video since September, we decided to just dip our toes

00:25.360 --> 00:27.600
into the waters of Gamergate at first.

00:27.600 --> 00:31.680
There will be more investigative videos in the future, but for now I think it's important

00:31.680 --> 00:35.040
to discuss where we are and what we should be doing.

00:35.040 --> 00:39.960
Everybody remembers Internet aristocrat's self-destruction on his way out of Gamergate.

00:39.960 --> 00:44.160
I know it's a bit old, but I'd like to address a few of his points.

00:44.160 --> 00:48.600
And to be frank with you, the whole Gamergate thing is depressing.

00:48.600 --> 00:53.960
It was the opportunity to finally kick the teeth in of social justice warriors and tumblorettes

00:53.960 --> 00:58.940
and draw a fucking line in the sand and push back against all these hypersensitive cunts.

00:58.940 --> 01:02.280
And for a while it was working really, really well.

01:02.280 --> 01:03.980
All you had to do was attack.

01:03.980 --> 01:05.800
Now I'm going to use an analogy here.

01:05.800 --> 01:10.780
I understand there's a major difference in scale, like millions of orders of magnitude

01:10.780 --> 01:14.960
difference in scale, but the basic social mechanisms are identical.

01:14.960 --> 01:20.080
When you have, say, a nation undergoing social upheaval, the social structure is generally

01:20.080 --> 01:25.180
made up of elites at the top, running government and society, and the mass of common people

01:25.180 --> 01:29.900
at the bottom, living within a social system that does not benefit them.

01:29.900 --> 01:35.720
This division is primarily class-based, but is commonly, but not always, also racially

01:35.720 --> 01:39.820
based, gender-based, religious-based, or ethnically based.

01:39.820 --> 01:44.760
When commoners rise up against social power, there's three ways for it to end.

01:44.760 --> 01:49.400
One, the elites come down hard on the people and their strength ends the revolt.

01:49.400 --> 01:52.560
This generally leads to more oppression than before.

01:52.560 --> 01:54.580
Two, reformation.

01:54.580 --> 01:58.920
The people work within the current system and fix it to be more fair and just.

01:58.920 --> 02:00.820
Three, revolution.

02:00.820 --> 02:05.460
The people determine that the old system cannot be reformed, and they must build a new one

02:05.460 --> 02:10.120
to take its place, and in the case of a nation, this often requires armed conflict.

02:10.120 --> 02:14.800
However, when the commoners are unwilling to take option three, even when option two

02:14.800 --> 02:20.380
has been exhausted, like we've recently seen in Egypt during the Arab Spring, for example,

02:20.380 --> 02:22.400
inevitably option one is what will happen.

02:22.400 --> 02:28.540
Now, let me reiterate, Gamergate is obviously not a cause worth taking up arms for, nor

02:28.540 --> 02:33.200
would any good actually come of it if some deranged lunatic did actually do that.

02:33.200 --> 02:37.340
However, the social structure and the forces within are still the same.

02:37.340 --> 02:42.720
When Internet aristocrat says, all you had to do was attack, he's saying, keep up option

02:42.720 --> 02:43.720
two.

02:43.720 --> 02:44.720
Eventually.

02:44.720 --> 02:45.900
But it won't.

02:45.900 --> 02:50.820
All a corrupt government has to do to avoid non-violent protests is to hole up behind

02:50.820 --> 02:55.440
their walls, and all a corrupt publication has to do is circle their wagons.

02:55.440 --> 02:59.660
We have proven journalists to be corrupt, and their bosses would rather protect their

02:59.660 --> 03:03.800
corrupt employees instead of step up and do what ethics would require of them.

03:03.800 --> 03:08.960
We have proven entire publications to be corrupt, and they simply wear it as armor.

03:08.960 --> 03:13.340
You cannot just keep attacking and expect the system to suddenly see the reason in your

03:13.340 --> 03:15.360
point of view and reform itself.

03:15.360 --> 03:20.160
Your just keep attacking mentality seems more like something from a 4chan raid designed

03:20.160 --> 03:24.080
to troll everybody rather than actually doing something constructive.

03:24.080 --> 03:29.520
For Gamergate, option three, that is, tearing down the old system and building a new one

03:29.520 --> 03:34.920
in its place, is our only course of action, with special emphasis on building a new one

03:34.920 --> 03:35.920
in its place.

03:35.920 --> 03:40.800
It is not enough to just drive Gawker bankrupt or run Destructoid out of business, though

03:40.800 --> 03:42.480
that is an important step.

03:42.480 --> 03:45.980
Despite what naysayers may be throwing around, we are doing just that.

03:45.980 --> 03:49.580
There's an article on Clocked that talks about traffic numbers of the relevant websites

03:49.580 --> 03:50.860
in greater detail.

03:50.860 --> 03:55.140
Alexa numbers for these publications since Gamergate began do show a lot of decreases

03:55.140 --> 04:01.180
in activity, but also some increases, leading many people, most famously Angry Joe of all

04:01.180 --> 04:05.420
individuals, to believe that Gamergate is having no effect of the traffic of these sites

04:05.420 --> 04:22.480
and is largely a violent, misogynistic vocal minority.

04:22.480 --> 04:29.440
Even though a statistical analysis, run by Chris von Svalve, has shown that Gamergate

04:29.440 --> 04:35.020
is most likely a movement made up of over 150,000 individuals, with only a dozen or

04:35.020 --> 04:38.420
so of them actually sending violent or threatening messages.

04:38.420 --> 04:42.300
The discovery of which got him sent death threats by people opposed to Gamergate, by

04:42.300 --> 04:43.300
the way.

04:43.300 --> 04:47.300
However, the Clocked article describes in detail how using Alexa numbers, the way most

04:47.300 --> 04:50.780
of us have been thus far, pro or anti, is flawed.

04:50.780 --> 04:55.460
I'll let you read it yourself, but basically the bounce rate of these websites, that is,

04:55.460 --> 05:00.520
the people who immediately leave a site upon opening it up, has been rising consistently,

05:00.520 --> 05:04.480
for all publications since Gamergate began, while the numbers of consistent readers has

05:04.480 --> 05:06.040
been steadily decreasing.

05:06.040 --> 05:09.280
To me, this sounds like more and more people who are getting clickbaited into reading an

05:09.280 --> 05:14.500
article on Kotaku or something are noticing where that link brought them and immediately

05:14.500 --> 05:15.760
are leaving.

05:15.760 --> 05:21.360
So yes, we are hurting them, they are losing money, and we are succeeding, and it's necessary

05:21.360 --> 05:25.440
that all efforts regarding the boycott of these unethical publications continue.

05:25.440 --> 05:30.280
Now at the risk of alienating a lot of you, this is why I believe in social justice.

05:30.280 --> 05:36.360
Not what Tumblr or Twitter thinks social justice is, not what SJWs or SRS cultists scream about.

05:36.360 --> 05:41.740
I promise you, when somebody's Twitter profile says social justice warrior or social justice

05:41.740 --> 05:45.440
dog or whatever, they don't know what social justice is.

05:45.440 --> 05:49.680
Social justice is, in essence, the process of reform and revolution.

05:49.680 --> 05:53.600
It's when the common people realize the elites have set up a social system in which commoners

05:53.600 --> 05:56.320
are exploited and elites are advantaged.

05:56.320 --> 06:01.360
This can be nationwide, this can be within a small community, it can be within a subculture.

06:01.360 --> 06:04.400
That is the mechanism by which social justice is achieved.

06:04.400 --> 06:06.280
And this is what Gamergate is doing.

06:06.280 --> 06:08.320
Remember my criteria from earlier in this video?

06:08.320 --> 06:12.160
There is a social system in which a group of elites are privileged, and they all help

06:12.160 --> 06:13.760
maintain each other's privilege.

06:13.760 --> 06:16.400
The game journal pros list seems to fit that bill.

06:16.400 --> 06:20.400
The elites are largely divided from us among class lines.

06:20.400 --> 06:24.720
But with most game journals and developers within the elite group being able to afford

06:24.720 --> 06:28.840
living in the more expensive urban centers in North America, with many of them being

06:28.840 --> 06:33.840
trust fund babies, they are also divided from us along lines of race as well, most of them

06:33.840 --> 06:34.840
being white.

06:34.840 --> 06:39.620
Tearing down their ivory tower and building a system more equitable to all is the core

06:39.620 --> 06:41.920
tenet of actual social justice.

06:41.920 --> 06:45.720
In fact, this is what Smash the Patriarchy originally meant.

06:45.720 --> 06:50.320
Second Wave feminists knew they couldn't simply smash the patriarchy without constructing

06:50.320 --> 06:52.660
a more equitable system to take its place.

06:52.660 --> 06:56.320
But Third Wave feminists are only interested in the destruction, completely leaving the

06:56.320 --> 06:57.840
reconstructing out of it.

06:57.840 --> 07:01.840
This is how I know that when people like Maya Kramer show up with their cuties killing video

07:01.840 --> 07:06.480
games merchandise, or when Lea Alexander and whoever else talks about gamers being dead

07:06.480 --> 07:10.360
or over, they fundamentally don't understand social justice.

07:10.360 --> 07:14.000
Because they're only interested in the killing, in hurting other people, in tearing things

07:14.000 --> 07:15.000
down.

07:15.000 --> 07:17.840
They don't recognize that feminism requires building anew as well.

07:17.840 --> 07:23.320
They glorify destruction and spurn any reconstructive efforts that would lead to lasting equality.

07:23.320 --> 07:28.120
In short, Gamergate is actually performing the actions that social justice and feminism

07:28.120 --> 07:31.760
require for a social revolution to take place within the subculture of gaming.

07:31.760 --> 07:35.160
And I think this is the main reason why we have received so much pushback.

07:35.160 --> 07:39.820
The establishment, the elites, the journals and the developers talk all day about social

07:39.820 --> 07:42.320
justice but don't actually do anything about it.

07:42.320 --> 07:46.400
And when us, the common people, the people without class privilege come along and try

07:46.400 --> 07:51.320
to do actual social justice, they fight us, because they know in terms of actual social

07:51.320 --> 07:53.720
justice, they're the oppressor.

07:53.720 --> 07:57.200
Internet aristocrat was right about just one thing.

07:57.200 --> 07:58.840
We can't be like them.

07:58.840 --> 08:01.360
We can't simply tear down and not rebuild.

08:01.360 --> 08:05.680
However, rebuilding an entirely new framework takes time, energy, and frankly money.

08:05.680 --> 08:08.000
I don't know what you expect when you say this.

08:08.000 --> 08:11.600
Go look at the people who are prominent figures right now in Gamergate, and see how many

08:11.600 --> 08:15.680
of them have Indiegogo campaigns, how many of them have Kickstarter campaigns, how many

08:15.680 --> 08:20.720
of them have Patreons, how many have ad revenue on their fucking videos.

08:20.720 --> 08:22.160
Everybody's making a buck.

08:22.160 --> 08:26.600
Do you think people should just build a completely alternate system of games journalism and travel

08:26.600 --> 08:29.880
to events and report on news all for free?

08:29.880 --> 08:30.880
No.

08:30.880 --> 08:32.840
The truth of it is we must all pitch in.

08:32.840 --> 08:37.200
It is not enough to boycott Gawker and Destructoid on RPS and Gamasutra.

08:37.200 --> 08:39.960
We also need to frequent sites with actual ethical standards.

08:39.960 --> 08:43.760
Everybody's talking about TechRaptor right now due to the Pinsauf interview.

08:43.760 --> 08:47.400
NewsNosh and NicheGamer were held up at the beginning of Gamergate as being some of

08:47.400 --> 08:50.520
the only websites willing to even allow discussion of it.

08:50.520 --> 08:55.280
Do you want to see these sites grow in size and staff and viewership to be the new replacements

08:55.280 --> 08:57.520
for the old corrupt publications?

08:57.520 --> 08:59.680
That takes money and patronage, man.

08:59.680 --> 09:03.760
BasedGamer is another great example of this, of people within Gamergate coming together

09:03.760 --> 09:08.040
to create a Rotten Tomatoes-style aggregator, something that games journalism desperately

09:08.040 --> 09:09.040
needs.

09:09.040 --> 09:12.960
On one of IA's streams, of which I was a part of actually, Milo said to all of us

09:12.960 --> 09:17.600
that people within Gamergate should consider creating an independent body to judge the

09:17.600 --> 09:22.120
ethical practices of all games journalism publications on an annual basis, similar to

09:22.120 --> 09:24.460
the one that exists within the mainstream media.

09:24.460 --> 09:26.740
It is not enough to tear down the old systems.

09:26.740 --> 09:28.920
We also must build their replacements.

09:28.920 --> 09:31.460
And it's not enough to simply wish for it to happen.

09:31.460 --> 09:33.960
We have to be willing to do it by our own hands.

09:33.960 --> 09:37.680
Speaking of Angry Joe, his video was actually pretty fair, but there are a few things I'd

09:37.680 --> 09:38.680
like to talk about.

09:38.680 --> 09:42.920
He mentions early on that you can be for ethics in journalism and not be a part of Gamergate.

09:42.920 --> 09:47.120
You can be for gaming ethics, I have been for gaming ethics, TotalBiscuit has been for

09:47.120 --> 09:52.960
gaming ethics before the creation of the Gamergate hashtag, and we will be after.

09:52.960 --> 09:59.400
You can be for gaming ethics without self-identifying with a stupid hashtag on Twitter.

09:59.400 --> 10:03.520
I suppose that's true, in much the same way that you can be for gender equality and not

10:03.520 --> 10:04.580
be a feminist.

10:04.580 --> 10:08.800
This is mostly a semantic point, but I've always thought semantic points are actually

10:08.800 --> 10:12.920
very important, because use of labels shows how we see the world.

10:12.920 --> 10:16.600
A feminist, by the dictionary definition, is somebody who believes in gender equality.

10:16.600 --> 10:29.320
Therefore, if you believe in gender equality, you are a feminist.

10:29.320 --> 10:33.440
A person who believes in gender equality, but says I'm not a feminist, is technically

10:33.440 --> 10:37.800
a feminist by definition, but wants to avoid being associated with a political group called

10:37.800 --> 10:38.800
feminism.

10:38.800 --> 10:40.840
I think Angry Joe is in this camp.

10:40.840 --> 10:42.840
He believes in ethical journalism.

10:42.840 --> 10:44.240
He thinks corruption is bad.

10:44.240 --> 10:46.820
By that definition, that makes him a gamergator.

10:46.820 --> 10:48.840
But he says he's neutral to gamergate.

10:48.840 --> 10:53.480
His ideas on the topic align with gamergate the philosophy, but he has no desire to be

10:53.480 --> 10:55.720
part of gamergate the political movement.

10:55.720 --> 10:59.160
I know some people have seen this as cowardly or whatever, but I think it's fine.

10:59.160 --> 11:01.640
I think this actually describes the vast majority of gamers.

11:01.640 --> 11:04.940
And Joe, I'm a fan, and as much as I like your videos, I gotta correct a few things

11:04.940 --> 11:05.940
you've said here.

11:05.940 --> 11:13.660
Zoe Quinn, a female developer, her angry, jealous boyfriend fucking put all their dirty

11:13.660 --> 11:19.220
laundry on the internet, just completely fucking doxxed all of her information, and accused

11:19.220 --> 11:24.780
her of sleeping and cheating with numerous guys, and she confirmed it as well, sleeping

11:24.780 --> 11:25.780
with a few other people.

11:25.780 --> 11:27.860
Aaron didn't actually doxx anybody.

11:27.860 --> 11:31.500
He put up their relationship drama, sure, and it's within his rights to do so no matter

11:31.500 --> 11:33.020
what anybody thinks of it.

11:33.020 --> 11:37.740
On a personal level, the Zoe post described a person who was emotionally abused in their

11:37.740 --> 11:41.020
relationship, describing the abuse he suffered at the hands of his abuser.

11:41.020 --> 11:45.420
Like you said, that's ultimately not our business, but when you go to a subreddit like Raised

11:45.420 --> 11:50.300
by Narcissists, where children describe how their parents abused them, that's also not

11:50.300 --> 11:54.460
anybody else's business, but people willingly provide their story.

11:54.460 --> 11:59.500
Victims of abuse often find some comfort and healing in recounting their story.

11:59.500 --> 12:04.340
However, Aaron didn't put up Zoe's address, a real name, or her porn pics, or anything

12:04.340 --> 12:05.340
like that.

12:05.340 --> 12:08.900
Other people did a whois on her website to see who it was registered to, and somebody

12:08.900 --> 12:12.700
on 4chan spent the 10 bucks and bought her porn pics legally.

12:12.700 --> 12:42.620
Saying that Aaron did that is just inaccurate.

12:42.620 --> 12:59.820
Individuals within gamergate are largely left-wing and anti-authoritarian, which goes

12:59.820 --> 13:04.860
to show just how far gamers were pushed when they all went flocking to the right-wing press

13:04.860 --> 13:09.140
to receive actual coverage of gamergate, since those publications were the only ones willing

13:09.140 --> 13:10.780
to tell the entire story.

13:10.780 --> 13:14.400
It's no surprise that left-wingers will generally stick around left-wing publications to get

13:14.400 --> 13:19.020
their news, but when left-wing authoritarians in charge of these outlets begin assassinating

13:19.020 --> 13:24.940
their own left-wing anti-authoritarian fanbases for not falling in line, they drove them right

13:24.940 --> 13:28.420
into the waiting arms of far-right extremists.

13:28.420 --> 13:32.860
Gamergate became so viciously polarized, not because of right-wingers like Adam Baldwin

13:32.860 --> 13:33.860
or Milo.

13:33.860 --> 14:02.140
It was because the left tried to eat itself.

14:02.140 --> 14:05.980
Asking for proof of unsubstantiated claims isn't a bad thing.

14:05.980 --> 14:08.100
This photo is not a conspiracy theory, dude.

14:08.100 --> 14:11.940
Brianna talks constantly about being forced to leave her house when she didn't actually

14:11.940 --> 14:15.520
go anywhere, and that's something you just sort of hand-wave in your video.

14:15.520 --> 14:20.820
Any name in gamergate, big or small, including myself, rejects the harassment of these people

14:20.820 --> 14:23.100
whether done in our name or not.

14:23.100 --> 14:26.900
But you act like questioning some of their more outrageous claims is tantamount to a

14:26.900 --> 14:29.980
conspiracy theory when it's really just good practices.

14:29.980 --> 14:34.620
Anyway, Joe, I doubt you'll see this, but if you end up watching it someday, don't

14:34.620 --> 14:36.100
take this as an attack on you.

14:36.100 --> 14:40.200
I think your video is mostly pretty fair, and I recommend everybody else go see it if

14:40.200 --> 14:41.200
they haven't already.

14:41.200 --> 14:42.540
I'll end the video off with this.

14:42.540 --> 14:48.260
Eric Kane wrote an article entitled What Gamergate is Actually About, that I think best describes

14:48.260 --> 14:52.500
what gamergate is, and in doing so highlights exactly where gamergate needs to go.

14:52.500 --> 14:57.100
According to him, gamergate is not entirely a consumer movement, nor is it entirely about

14:57.100 --> 14:58.100
ethics.

14:58.100 --> 15:03.600
It's not a hate group, it's not about anti-SJWs, and it's not about conservativism in video

15:03.600 --> 15:04.600
games either.

15:04.600 --> 15:08.540
Rather, it's about a toxic relationship that's formed between the video game press and gamers

15:08.540 --> 15:12.760
themselves, one that's been bubbling and brewing for years, not months.

15:12.760 --> 15:14.540
This is the core of the issue.

15:14.540 --> 15:16.900
Gaming is fundamentally a meritocracy.

15:16.900 --> 15:19.340
Nothing matters aside from how well you do at the game.

15:19.340 --> 15:23.540
Even if somebody sends you a slur over Xbox Live because you're a girl who's wrecking

15:23.540 --> 15:28.060
their shit, at the end of the match it'll be you at the top of the scoreboard, not them.

15:28.060 --> 15:30.220
Even in development it's a meritocracy.

15:30.220 --> 15:34.380
Women have been part of some of the best games to ever come out in the past 30 years.

15:34.380 --> 15:39.060
Nobody took a look at Mega Man or Bayonetta or Castlevania or Street Fighter or Mario

15:39.060 --> 15:45.020
RPG or any of the other billions of games that women have worked on and said, oh wow,

15:45.020 --> 15:47.060
those games are worse because women help make them.

15:47.060 --> 15:48.460
No, nobody gives a shit.

15:48.460 --> 15:49.900
It's based on the merit of the game.

15:49.900 --> 15:53.580
The current elite at the top of the social structure, the journalists and developers

15:53.580 --> 15:56.500
in their clique, they're left-wing authoritarians.

15:56.500 --> 16:01.180
They ultimately want the gaming space to be run not on meritocracy, but rather on their

16:01.180 --> 16:02.180
autocracy.

16:02.180 --> 16:05.620
They don't care about getting women into games, they care about getting their women

16:05.620 --> 16:06.660
into games.

16:06.660 --> 16:09.900
They don't care about giving exposure to indie devs, they care about giving exposure

16:09.900 --> 16:11.900
to their indie devs.

16:11.900 --> 16:17.100
This has been proven time and again with biased coverage, illegal blacklists and rigged award

16:17.100 --> 16:18.100
shows.

16:18.100 --> 16:19.100
Eric was right.

16:19.100 --> 16:22.380
There's a toxic relationship between the people who play games and people who report

16:22.380 --> 16:23.380
on games.

16:23.380 --> 16:26.060
And it's been building up for far longer than Gamergate's been around.

16:26.060 --> 16:30.520
The toxic relationship began because gamers value competition and merit, while the journalists

16:30.520 --> 16:35.180
wanted to control the message we receive with an iron fist instead of simply allowing merit

16:35.180 --> 16:36.980
to bubble to the surface.

16:36.980 --> 16:41.620
Just as I would tell somebody being abused in their relationship that they need to escape

16:41.620 --> 16:45.580
from their authoritarian partner and find a safe space to heal, all people who play

16:45.580 --> 16:50.660
video games need to leave these publications behind and rebuild our safe space where we

16:50.660 --> 16:52.580
can freely be gamers again.

16:52.580 --> 16:54.700
Because make no mistake, they're trying to take that from us.

16:54.700 --> 16:58.180
They commonly say, oh we don't want to take away your games, we just want to diversify

16:58.180 --> 16:59.420
games.

16:59.420 --> 17:00.800
Don't believe them.

17:00.800 --> 17:04.100
Diversifying games is good, and there are games that have been improved by its diverse

17:04.100 --> 17:05.140
cast.

17:05.140 --> 17:06.740
But this isn't their goal.

17:06.740 --> 17:11.580
As soon as they got even the smallest semblance of a foothold, they moved to try and get games

17:11.580 --> 17:16.180
like HuniePop kicked off Steam due to their subjective, sexist idea of what offensive

17:16.180 --> 17:17.780
content is.

17:17.780 --> 17:21.640
Diversifying games is good, and they talk about it, but it's not their goal.

17:21.640 --> 17:24.060
Their goal is banning games they disapprove of.

17:24.060 --> 17:28.540
But this is the future of Gamergate, abandoning the corrupt publications, boycotting them,

17:28.540 --> 17:32.300
spreading the word about their practices, and rebuilding gaming again from the ground

17:32.300 --> 17:37.680
up with new developers, new journalists, new ways to talk about games, ways that benefit

17:37.680 --> 17:39.660
all of us, not just the privileged few.

17:39.660 --> 17:43.960
Anyway, I know this video has meandered quite a bit, it's our channel's first real posting

17:43.960 --> 17:47.980
on Gamergate in months, and I wanted to cover a number of topics that we sort of missed.

17:47.980 --> 17:51.900
Camera's working on a more investigative style video discussing The Escapist, which should

17:51.900 --> 17:55.540
be out in just over a week or so, so I hope you'll stick around and check it out.

17:55.540 --> 17:59.260
Because I'm a shill, feel free to check out our other videos we do as well.

17:59.260 --> 18:00.260
I hope you like them.

18:00.260 --> 18:03.540
And I hope you liked this.

18:03.540 --> 18:04.340
See you later, guys.
