0	14560	Hey guys, Dev here.
14560	19260	I'm a bit sick, everyone here is right now, but I think I'm well enough to get through
19260	20580	doing this video.
20580	25360	For our first new Indefensible video since September, we decided to just dip our toes
25360	27600	into the waters of Gamergate at first.
27600	31680	There will be more investigative videos in the future, but for now I think it's important
31680	35040	to discuss where we are and what we should be doing.
35040	39960	Everybody remembers Internet aristocrat's self-destruction on his way out of Gamergate.
39960	44160	I know it's a bit old, but I'd like to address a few of his points.
44160	48600	And to be frank with you, the whole Gamergate thing is depressing.
48600	53960	It was the opportunity to finally kick the teeth in of social justice warriors and tumblorettes
53960	58940	and draw a fucking line in the sand and push back against all these hypersensitive cunts.
58940	62280	And for a while it was working really, really well.
62280	63980	All you had to do was attack.
63980	65800	Now I'm going to use an analogy here.
65800	70780	I understand there's a major difference in scale, like millions of orders of magnitude
70780	74960	difference in scale, but the basic social mechanisms are identical.
74960	80080	When you have, say, a nation undergoing social upheaval, the social structure is generally
80080	85180	made up of elites at the top, running government and society, and the mass of common people
85180	89900	at the bottom, living within a social system that does not benefit them.
89900	95720	This division is primarily class-based, but is commonly, but not always, also racially
95720	99820	based, gender-based, religious-based, or ethnically based.
99820	104760	When commoners rise up against social power, there's three ways for it to end.
104760	109400	One, the elites come down hard on the people and their strength ends the revolt.
109400	112560	This generally leads to more oppression than before.
112560	114580	Two, reformation.
114580	118920	The people work within the current system and fix it to be more fair and just.
118920	120820	Three, revolution.
120820	125460	The people determine that the old system cannot be reformed, and they must build a new one
125460	130120	to take its place, and in the case of a nation, this often requires armed conflict.
130120	134800	However, when the commoners are unwilling to take option three, even when option two
134800	140380	has been exhausted, like we've recently seen in Egypt during the Arab Spring, for example,
140380	142400	inevitably option one is what will happen.
142400	148540	Now, let me reiterate, Gamergate is obviously not a cause worth taking up arms for, nor
148540	153200	would any good actually come of it if some deranged lunatic did actually do that.
153200	157340	However, the social structure and the forces within are still the same.
157340	162720	When Internet aristocrat says, all you had to do was attack, he's saying, keep up option
162720	163720	two.
163720	164720	Eventually.
164720	165900	But it won't.
165900	170820	All a corrupt government has to do to avoid non-violent protests is to hole up behind
170820	175440	their walls, and all a corrupt publication has to do is circle their wagons.
175440	179660	We have proven journalists to be corrupt, and their bosses would rather protect their
179660	183800	corrupt employees instead of step up and do what ethics would require of them.
183800	188960	We have proven entire publications to be corrupt, and they simply wear it as armor.
188960	193340	You cannot just keep attacking and expect the system to suddenly see the reason in your
193340	195360	point of view and reform itself.
195360	200160	Your just keep attacking mentality seems more like something from a 4chan raid designed
200160	204080	to troll everybody rather than actually doing something constructive.
204080	209520	For Gamergate, option three, that is, tearing down the old system and building a new one
209520	214920	in its place, is our only course of action, with special emphasis on building a new one
214920	215920	in its place.
215920	220800	It is not enough to just drive Gawker bankrupt or run Destructoid out of business, though
220800	222480	that is an important step.
222480	225980	Despite what naysayers may be throwing around, we are doing just that.
225980	229580	There's an article on Clocked that talks about traffic numbers of the relevant websites
229580	230860	in greater detail.
230860	235140	Alexa numbers for these publications since Gamergate began do show a lot of decreases
235140	241180	in activity, but also some increases, leading many people, most famously Angry Joe of all
241180	245420	individuals, to believe that Gamergate is having no effect of the traffic of these sites
245420	262480	and is largely a violent, misogynistic vocal minority.
262480	269440	Even though a statistical analysis, run by Chris von Svalve, has shown that Gamergate
269440	275020	is most likely a movement made up of over 150,000 individuals, with only a dozen or
275020	278420	so of them actually sending violent or threatening messages.
278420	282300	The discovery of which got him sent death threats by people opposed to Gamergate, by
282300	283300	the way.
283300	287300	However, the Clocked article describes in detail how using Alexa numbers, the way most
287300	290780	of us have been thus far, pro or anti, is flawed.
290780	295460	I'll let you read it yourself, but basically the bounce rate of these websites, that is,
295460	300520	the people who immediately leave a site upon opening it up, has been rising consistently,
300520	304480	for all publications since Gamergate began, while the numbers of consistent readers has
304480	306040	been steadily decreasing.
306040	309280	To me, this sounds like more and more people who are getting clickbaited into reading an
309280	314500	article on Kotaku or something are noticing where that link brought them and immediately
314500	315760	are leaving.
315760	321360	So yes, we are hurting them, they are losing money, and we are succeeding, and it's necessary
321360	325440	that all efforts regarding the boycott of these unethical publications continue.
325440	330280	Now at the risk of alienating a lot of you, this is why I believe in social justice.
330280	336360	Not what Tumblr or Twitter thinks social justice is, not what SJWs or SRS cultists scream about.
336360	341740	I promise you, when somebody's Twitter profile says social justice warrior or social justice
341740	345440	dog or whatever, they don't know what social justice is.
345440	349680	Social justice is, in essence, the process of reform and revolution.
349680	353600	It's when the common people realize the elites have set up a social system in which commoners
353600	356320	are exploited and elites are advantaged.
356320	361360	This can be nationwide, this can be within a small community, it can be within a subculture.
361360	364400	That is the mechanism by which social justice is achieved.
364400	366280	And this is what Gamergate is doing.
366280	368320	Remember my criteria from earlier in this video?
368320	372160	There is a social system in which a group of elites are privileged, and they all help
372160	373760	maintain each other's privilege.
373760	376400	The game journal pros list seems to fit that bill.
376400	380400	The elites are largely divided from us among class lines.
380400	384720	But with most game journals and developers within the elite group being able to afford
384720	388840	living in the more expensive urban centers in North America, with many of them being
388840	393840	trust fund babies, they are also divided from us along lines of race as well, most of them
393840	394840	being white.
394840	399620	Tearing down their ivory tower and building a system more equitable to all is the core
399620	401920	tenet of actual social justice.
401920	405720	In fact, this is what Smash the Patriarchy originally meant.
405720	410320	Second Wave feminists knew they couldn't simply smash the patriarchy without constructing
410320	412660	a more equitable system to take its place.
412660	416320	But Third Wave feminists are only interested in the destruction, completely leaving the
416320	417840	reconstructing out of it.
417840	421840	This is how I know that when people like Maya Kramer show up with their cuties killing video
421840	426480	games merchandise, or when Lea Alexander and whoever else talks about gamers being dead
426480	430360	or over, they fundamentally don't understand social justice.
430360	434000	Because they're only interested in the killing, in hurting other people, in tearing things
434000	435000	down.
435000	437840	They don't recognize that feminism requires building anew as well.
437840	443320	They glorify destruction and spurn any reconstructive efforts that would lead to lasting equality.
443320	448120	In short, Gamergate is actually performing the actions that social justice and feminism
448120	451760	require for a social revolution to take place within the subculture of gaming.
451760	455160	And I think this is the main reason why we have received so much pushback.
455160	459820	The establishment, the elites, the journals and the developers talk all day about social
459820	462320	justice but don't actually do anything about it.
462320	466400	And when us, the common people, the people without class privilege come along and try
466400	471320	to do actual social justice, they fight us, because they know in terms of actual social
471320	473720	justice, they're the oppressor.
473720	477200	Internet aristocrat was right about just one thing.
477200	478840	We can't be like them.
478840	481360	We can't simply tear down and not rebuild.
481360	485680	However, rebuilding an entirely new framework takes time, energy, and frankly money.
485680	488000	I don't know what you expect when you say this.
488000	491600	Go look at the people who are prominent figures right now in Gamergate, and see how many
491600	495680	of them have Indiegogo campaigns, how many of them have Kickstarter campaigns, how many
495680	500720	of them have Patreons, how many have ad revenue on their fucking videos.
500720	502160	Everybody's making a buck.
502160	506600	Do you think people should just build a completely alternate system of games journalism and travel
506600	509880	to events and report on news all for free?
509880	510880	No.
510880	512840	The truth of it is we must all pitch in.
512840	517200	It is not enough to boycott Gawker and Destructoid on RPS and Gamasutra.
517200	519960	We also need to frequent sites with actual ethical standards.
519960	523760	Everybody's talking about TechRaptor right now due to the Pinsauf interview.
523760	527400	NewsNosh and NicheGamer were held up at the beginning of Gamergate as being some of
527400	530520	the only websites willing to even allow discussion of it.
530520	535280	Do you want to see these sites grow in size and staff and viewership to be the new replacements
535280	537520	for the old corrupt publications?
537520	539680	That takes money and patronage, man.
539680	543760	BasedGamer is another great example of this, of people within Gamergate coming together
543760	548040	to create a Rotten Tomatoes-style aggregator, something that games journalism desperately
548040	549040	needs.
549040	552960	On one of IA's streams, of which I was a part of actually, Milo said to all of us
552960	557600	that people within Gamergate should consider creating an independent body to judge the
557600	562120	ethical practices of all games journalism publications on an annual basis, similar to
562120	564460	the one that exists within the mainstream media.
564460	566740	It is not enough to tear down the old systems.
566740	568920	We also must build their replacements.
568920	571460	And it's not enough to simply wish for it to happen.
571460	573960	We have to be willing to do it by our own hands.
573960	577680	Speaking of Angry Joe, his video was actually pretty fair, but there are a few things I'd
577680	578680	like to talk about.
578680	582920	He mentions early on that you can be for ethics in journalism and not be a part of Gamergate.
582920	587120	You can be for gaming ethics, I have been for gaming ethics, TotalBiscuit has been for
587120	592960	gaming ethics before the creation of the Gamergate hashtag, and we will be after.
592960	599400	You can be for gaming ethics without self-identifying with a stupid hashtag on Twitter.
599400	603520	I suppose that's true, in much the same way that you can be for gender equality and not
603520	604580	be a feminist.
604580	608800	This is mostly a semantic point, but I've always thought semantic points are actually
608800	612920	very important, because use of labels shows how we see the world.
612920	616600	A feminist, by the dictionary definition, is somebody who believes in gender equality.
616600	629320	Therefore, if you believe in gender equality, you are a feminist.
629320	633440	A person who believes in gender equality, but says I'm not a feminist, is technically
633440	637800	a feminist by definition, but wants to avoid being associated with a political group called
637800	638800	feminism.
638800	640840	I think Angry Joe is in this camp.
640840	642840	He believes in ethical journalism.
642840	644240	He thinks corruption is bad.
644240	646820	By that definition, that makes him a gamergator.
646820	648840	But he says he's neutral to gamergate.
648840	653480	His ideas on the topic align with gamergate the philosophy, but he has no desire to be
653480	655720	part of gamergate the political movement.
655720	659160	I know some people have seen this as cowardly or whatever, but I think it's fine.
659160	661640	I think this actually describes the vast majority of gamers.
661640	664940	And Joe, I'm a fan, and as much as I like your videos, I gotta correct a few things
664940	665940	you've said here.
665940	673660	Zoe Quinn, a female developer, her angry, jealous boyfriend fucking put all their dirty
673660	679220	laundry on the internet, just completely fucking doxxed all of her information, and accused
679220	684780	her of sleeping and cheating with numerous guys, and she confirmed it as well, sleeping
684780	685780	with a few other people.
685780	687860	Aaron didn't actually doxx anybody.
687860	691500	He put up their relationship drama, sure, and it's within his rights to do so no matter
691500	693020	what anybody thinks of it.
693020	697740	On a personal level, the Zoe post described a person who was emotionally abused in their
697740	701020	relationship, describing the abuse he suffered at the hands of his abuser.
701020	705420	Like you said, that's ultimately not our business, but when you go to a subreddit like Raised
705420	710300	by Narcissists, where children describe how their parents abused them, that's also not
710300	714460	anybody else's business, but people willingly provide their story.
714460	719500	Victims of abuse often find some comfort and healing in recounting their story.
719500	724340	However, Aaron didn't put up Zoe's address, a real name, or her porn pics, or anything
724340	725340	like that.
725340	728900	Other people did a whois on her website to see who it was registered to, and somebody
728900	732700	on 4chan spent the 10 bucks and bought her porn pics legally.
732700	762620	Saying that Aaron did that is just inaccurate.
762620	779820	Individuals within gamergate are largely left-wing and anti-authoritarian, which goes
779820	784860	to show just how far gamers were pushed when they all went flocking to the right-wing press
784860	789140	to receive actual coverage of gamergate, since those publications were the only ones willing
789140	790780	to tell the entire story.
790780	794400	It's no surprise that left-wingers will generally stick around left-wing publications to get
794400	799020	their news, but when left-wing authoritarians in charge of these outlets begin assassinating
799020	804940	their own left-wing anti-authoritarian fanbases for not falling in line, they drove them right
804940	808420	into the waiting arms of far-right extremists.
808420	812860	Gamergate became so viciously polarized, not because of right-wingers like Adam Baldwin
812860	813860	or Milo.
813860	842140	It was because the left tried to eat itself.
842140	845980	Asking for proof of unsubstantiated claims isn't a bad thing.
845980	848100	This photo is not a conspiracy theory, dude.
848100	851940	Brianna talks constantly about being forced to leave her house when she didn't actually
851940	855520	go anywhere, and that's something you just sort of hand-wave in your video.
855520	860820	Any name in gamergate, big or small, including myself, rejects the harassment of these people
860820	863100	whether done in our name or not.
863100	866900	But you act like questioning some of their more outrageous claims is tantamount to a
866900	869980	conspiracy theory when it's really just good practices.
869980	874620	Anyway, Joe, I doubt you'll see this, but if you end up watching it someday, don't
874620	876100	take this as an attack on you.
876100	880200	I think your video is mostly pretty fair, and I recommend everybody else go see it if
880200	881200	they haven't already.
881200	882540	I'll end the video off with this.
882540	888260	Eric Kane wrote an article entitled What Gamergate is Actually About, that I think best describes
888260	892500	what gamergate is, and in doing so highlights exactly where gamergate needs to go.
892500	897100	According to him, gamergate is not entirely a consumer movement, nor is it entirely about
897100	898100	ethics.
898100	903600	It's not a hate group, it's not about anti-SJWs, and it's not about conservativism in video
903600	904600	games either.
904600	908540	Rather, it's about a toxic relationship that's formed between the video game press and gamers
908540	912760	themselves, one that's been bubbling and brewing for years, not months.
912760	914540	This is the core of the issue.
914540	916900	Gaming is fundamentally a meritocracy.
916900	919340	Nothing matters aside from how well you do at the game.
919340	923540	Even if somebody sends you a slur over Xbox Live because you're a girl who's wrecking
923540	928060	their shit, at the end of the match it'll be you at the top of the scoreboard, not them.
928060	930220	Even in development it's a meritocracy.
930220	934380	Women have been part of some of the best games to ever come out in the past 30 years.
934380	939060	Nobody took a look at Mega Man or Bayonetta or Castlevania or Street Fighter or Mario
939060	945020	RPG or any of the other billions of games that women have worked on and said, oh wow,
945020	947060	those games are worse because women help make them.
947060	948460	No, nobody gives a shit.
948460	949900	It's based on the merit of the game.
949900	953580	The current elite at the top of the social structure, the journalists and developers
953580	956500	in their clique, they're left-wing authoritarians.
956500	961180	They ultimately want the gaming space to be run not on meritocracy, but rather on their
961180	962180	autocracy.
962180	965620	They don't care about getting women into games, they care about getting their women
965620	966660	into games.
966660	969900	They don't care about giving exposure to indie devs, they care about giving exposure
969900	971900	to their indie devs.
971900	977100	This has been proven time and again with biased coverage, illegal blacklists and rigged award
977100	978100	shows.
978100	979100	Eric was right.
979100	982380	There's a toxic relationship between the people who play games and people who report
982380	983380	on games.
983380	986060	And it's been building up for far longer than Gamergate's been around.
986060	990520	The toxic relationship began because gamers value competition and merit, while the journalists
990520	995180	wanted to control the message we receive with an iron fist instead of simply allowing merit
995180	996980	to bubble to the surface.
996980	1001620	Just as I would tell somebody being abused in their relationship that they need to escape
1001620	1005580	from their authoritarian partner and find a safe space to heal, all people who play
1005580	1010660	video games need to leave these publications behind and rebuild our safe space where we
1010660	1012580	can freely be gamers again.
1012580	1014700	Because make no mistake, they're trying to take that from us.
1014700	1018180	They commonly say, oh we don't want to take away your games, we just want to diversify
1018180	1019420	games.
1019420	1020800	Don't believe them.
1020800	1024100	Diversifying games is good, and there are games that have been improved by its diverse
1024100	1025140	cast.
1025140	1026740	But this isn't their goal.
1026740	1031580	As soon as they got even the smallest semblance of a foothold, they moved to try and get games
1031580	1036180	like HuniePop kicked off Steam due to their subjective, sexist idea of what offensive
1036180	1037780	content is.
1037780	1041640	Diversifying games is good, and they talk about it, but it's not their goal.
1041640	1044060	Their goal is banning games they disapprove of.
1044060	1048540	But this is the future of Gamergate, abandoning the corrupt publications, boycotting them,
1048540	1052300	spreading the word about their practices, and rebuilding gaming again from the ground
1052300	1057680	up with new developers, new journalists, new ways to talk about games, ways that benefit
1057680	1059660	all of us, not just the privileged few.
1059660	1063960	Anyway, I know this video has meandered quite a bit, it's our channel's first real posting
1063960	1067980	on Gamergate in months, and I wanted to cover a number of topics that we sort of missed.
1067980	1071900	Camera's working on a more investigative style video discussing The Escapist, which should
1071900	1075540	be out in just over a week or so, so I hope you'll stick around and check it out.
1075540	1079260	Because I'm a shill, feel free to check out our other videos we do as well.
1079260	1080260	I hope you like them.
1080260	1083540	And I hope you liked this.
1083540	1084340	See you later, guys.
