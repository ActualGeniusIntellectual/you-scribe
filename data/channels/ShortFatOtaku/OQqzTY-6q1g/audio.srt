1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,160
I am very sure that if you're watching my channel, you know what the Gadsden flag is.

2
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:13,040
I'm not a libertarian, but I have a feeling a good chunk of you might be.

3
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:14,880
Nonetheless, here's a quick rundown.

4
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:18,600
The Gadsden flag is that yellow flag that you see libertarians flying all the time,

5
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:21,240
with the coiled snake in the Don't Tread On Me caption.

6
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:25,960
It was designed during the American Revolutionary War by Christopher Gadsden, a Brigadier General

7
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:27,260
in the Continental Army.

8
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:31,740
He gave the flag to Commodore Esek Hopkins, who took it as his personal banner.

9
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:35,620
Hopkins continued to use it after his promotion to Commander-in-Chief of the Continental Navy,

10
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:38,000
where it rapidly spread in popularity.

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,700
As one of America's first flag designs, it has a special place in the history books alongside

12
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:44,540
the colonial flag, the first national flag, and others.

13
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:48,780
In my previous video on flags, I talked about them in the context of them being national

14
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:49,780
symbols.

15
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:53,540
But the Gadsden flag is a symbol of a specific type of defiant ethic that is common in the

16
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:54,540
United States.

17
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:58,300
The idea is that the snake is not necessarily the most dangerous animal out there, but that

18
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:01,280
if you mess with it, you will most certainly be bit by it.

19
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:05,020
This represents the basic individualist ethic of the United States.

20
00:01:05,020 --> 00:01:09,380
You might be able to use overwhelming centralized force to trample on the individual, but he

21
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:13,000
is going to give you so much trouble that your victory will not have been worth it.

22
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,300
There's almost a defeatist defiance here.

23
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:18,480
It's not the same kind of thing as an army marching off to a glorious victory.

24
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:22,140
The message is more like, if you come for me, I might not be able to beat you, but I

25
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:25,860
will destroy both of us if you try, which is a fitting sentiment for people who value

26
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:30,340
individual autonomy and liberty more than safe compliance like the Americans do.

27
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:35,300
In the modern era, it's been taken up by mostly libertarians, though occasionally leftoids

28
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:37,860
too, as a symbol of defiance against the government.

29
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:40,180
Here's what's really funny as a non-American.

30
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:43,980
When I was growing up, the Confederate flag didn't really have the connotations of slavery

31
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:44,980
attached to it.

32
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:49,180
Yes, we knew here that the American South was pro-slavery, but there was a non-distinct

33
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:53,740
cultural sense that the Confederate flag was primarily a generic symbol of defiance

34
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:56,780
against the government, which is what the Gadsden flag actually was.

35
00:01:56,780 --> 00:02:00,020
Personally, I'm going to blame Dukes of Hazzard reruns for that one.

36
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:04,900
However, there has been a push to reclassify the Gadsden flag as a contemporary political

37
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:09,260
symbol rather than a military or historic one after its widespread use by the Tea Party

38
00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:10,620
in 2009.

39
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:13,100
If you're too young to remember what the Tea Party was all about, here's a brief

40
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:14,340
primer on that too.

41
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:18,940
Obama won the election in 2008, and some rightoids in America weren't too happy about it.

42
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:23,920
A lot of their rejection of Obama was based in defiance of left-wing economic policies

43
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,300
that he wanted to implement.

44
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:29,140
There was some socially conservative stuff in there too, but economics was the movement's

45
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:30,260
primary focus.

46
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:34,260
A lot of left-wing commentators at the time replied to the Tea Party by simply describing

47
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:38,700
them as racist, partially because Obama is black, and partially because welfare programs

48
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:42,220
tend to benefit more non-whites than whites in the United States.

49
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:46,140
And yeah, there absolutely was some racism in the Tea Party, but again, it wasn't the

50
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:47,140
main focus.

51
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:52,060
For example, a paper in the Social Science Quarterly titled Tea Leaves and Southern Politics

52
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:55,980
determined that Tea Party supporters weren't driven by racial animosity but instead by

53
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:57,180
religious evangelism.

54
00:02:57,180 --> 00:03:01,500
Nonetheless, it's after the Tea Party that the idea of the Gadsden flag representing

55
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:05,100
racism began to take hold in the modern cultural zeitgeist.

56
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:09,300
And to be honest, seeing it flown at both Charlottesville and the January 6th riot at

57
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:11,220
the Capitol did not help the image.

58
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:15,440
The Washington Post famously declared that the Gadsden flag is a Confederate icon, which

59
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:18,580
has just retarded since it predated the Confederacy by quite a bit.

60
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:20,480
But here's how they squared away.

61
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:24,460
Little is said about the Gadsden flag's ties to Confederates, who embraced it in their

62
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:26,580
own fight against federal authority.

63
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:32,600
From 1860 to 1862, the battle over Gadsden's symbols resembled modern meme wars.

64
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:37,220
Ultimately, the Union sacrificed Gadsden's Rattler because the Confederates had irreparably

65
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:38,220
tainted it.

66
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:41,100
This is very interesting to me because, like I said before, outside of America, when I

67
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:45,780
was growing up, there was this fuzzy cultural acceptance of the Confederate flag as a generic

68
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:49,800
symbol of defiance against the state, divorced from the particulars of Southern slavery.

69
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:52,860
The culture has since shifted, of course, it's now considered a flag of slavery here

70
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:56,520
too, and that process is now repeating itself with the Gadsden flag.

71
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:58,520
Do you see the logic being used here?

72
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:01,580
The Confederates were evil, the Confederacy rebelled against the government, the Confederacy

73
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:05,960
utilized symbols of rebellion against the government, therefore those symbols are tainted

74
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,640
with the evil of the Confederacy.

75
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:12,020
The issue is, ultimately, that the Gadsden flag has other meanings and was used by many

76
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:16,500
other movements before and after the American Civil War, while the Confederate flag really

77
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:19,700
doesn't have anything else going on for it other than its connection to the Confederacy.

78
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:21,980
A great example of what I mean is the Facies.

79
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:26,300
The Facies has been used as a symbol of legitimate political authority since the Roman era.

80
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:30,100
The Americans use it, the French use it, but also the Italian Fascists used it.

81
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:35,440
While its use associated with Fascism is representative of the bad guys of World War II, its use outside

82
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,900
of that time and place means something very different.

83
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:41,980
Nonetheless, that doesn't stop anarchists from declaring America as a Fascist state,

84
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:43,340
partially due to this connection.

85
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:47,500
The reason I'm talking about this topic today is because this kid went viral last

86
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:48,500
week.

87
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:52,340
Meet 12-year-old Jaden, who was kicked out of class yesterday in Colorado Springs for

88
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:57,120
having a Gadsden flag patch, which the school claims has origins with slavery.

89
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,980
To be honest, this kid seems like a memester.

90
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:03,700
There's not only a Gadsden flag on his camo backpack, but also a doge and a J-Rod for

91
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:33,560
the VP Revolution, based, okay, let's watch the video.

92
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:42,220
The Gadsden flag, the don't tread on me, okay, which is the Gadsden flag, okay, so

93
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:51,080
he, he, um, he, what's going to happen if he doesn't take it off, he, I mean, he is

94
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:55,680
able to go, I was actually just telling him, like, I was upset that he was missing so much

95
00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:00,200
school, I'm like, ah, so I asked him, can he just take his stuff out of his bag and

96
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,200
go back to class?

97
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:04,800
And I just wanted him to go back to class, the bag can't go back, it's got a patch on

98
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,320
it, because we can't have that in and around other kids.

99
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:10,000
So that's what I was trying to, and then he said you were close, so I was like, oh, okay.

100
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Yeah, it has nothing to do with slavery, that's like the revolutionary war patch that was

101
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,600
displayed when they were fighting the British, like, that wasn't, that's the revolution,

102
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:24,000
maybe you're thinking of, like, the, um, the Confederate, our Confederate flag?

103
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Okay, I, so, I am just here to, I am here to enforce the policy that was, that was,

104
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:38,600
that was provided by the district, and definitely, you have every right to not agree with it,

105
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,600
I mean, yeah.

106
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:43,760
Because the ACLU says that he's allowed to wear that if you, like, go on their website.

107
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:48,120
So firstly, this woman here, I don't think she even has the authority to argue the point.

108
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:51,860
It sounds like she's been sent in to enforce the policy, whether or not she agrees with

109
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:53,000
it or understands it.

110
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,160
I don't blame her for not wanting to lose her job and just keeping her head down, but

111
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,440
that doesn't make it right.

112
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,920
So let's go over the email exchange with the school board.

113
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:03,980
The rationale they provide for judging the Gadsden flag as an unacceptable symbol comes

114
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:05,920
from a Washington Post article.

115
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:10,480
That article is about a 2014 suit with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, where

116
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:14,300
a workplace complaint was fired over a hat with the Gadsden flag on it.

117
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:18,280
The complaint was that the symbol was racially insensitive because Christopher Gadsden was

118
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:20,160
a slave owner and a slave trader.

119
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:24,160
He did, in fact, own slaves, as many American industrialists at the time did, but he was

120
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,880
ultimately in favor of abolishing slavery.

121
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:30,840
He simply wanted a gradual approach towards it in order to not disrupt the economy.

122
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:36,160
The EEOC concluded that the Gadsden flag originated in the Revolutionary War in a non-racial context

123
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:40,740
and that the flag and its slogans have been used to express various non-racial sentiments.

124
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:45,160
Why the school board cited this article as proof the flag is unacceptable is beyond my

125
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:46,160
understanding.

126
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:49,880
The school board then claimed that the Gadsden flag is tied to the Confederate flag and other

127
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:54,360
white supremacist groups and Patriot groups, this time citing an article about the January

128
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:57,440
6th Capitol riot, listing off the various flags present.

129
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:00,900
Number two on the list is the yellow Gadsden flag, giving the same justification as the

130
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:01,900
previous article.

131
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:05,600
The history of Gadsden himself, plus the other flag it's commonly flown with nowadays.

132
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:10,000
By the way, it's not exactly clear, but I think the reason this article says the yellow

133
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,200
Gadsden flag is specifically to differentiate it from its red variant.

134
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:18,740
All red, alligator instead of a snake, with the same font saying fuck around find out.

135
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:22,960
This is an anarcho-communist adaptation of the Gadsden flag, with the same anti-government

136
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:26,560
sentiment but this time in service of socialism instead of libertarianism.

137
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,680
It's a modern invention from the past five years.

138
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:33,200
There's a gimmick account on Twitter called Gators Daily, which began by posting pictures

139
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:36,640
and articles about alligators, exactly as you think, but it turned political sometime

140
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:39,140
around 2020 like so many other things did.

141
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:42,280
The original design of the red flag variant came out of this account, and they sell it

142
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:45,920
on their store alongside other lefty gator-themed merch.

143
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:48,460
The post that inspired the flag is still really funny though.

144
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:52,120
Going back to the school board, they eventually claimed that Jayden was violating this rule

145
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:54,680
with his Gadsden flag backpack patch.

146
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:59,240
Bringing to school clothing, paraphernalia, grooming, jewelry, etc. etc. that contains

147
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:04,480
advertisements, symbols, etc. etc. that refers to drugs, tobacco, alcohol, or weapons.

148
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:08,880
I assume that they mean weapons, since it's a Revolutionary War-era flag made by a military

149
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:13,360
man and used by the military meant to convey a sense of defiance against authority.

150
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,260
That's still a very tenuous connection.

151
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:18,880
In the end, Jayden kept showing up to school with his Gadsden flag patch, and the school

152
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:22,080
board eventually allowed him to keep it, ultimately claiming that they proudly support the concept

153
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:25,860
of the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, and that the flag has historic significance.

154
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:29,920
Was this a case of the school board bending to public pressure after the story went viral?

155
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:34,000
Or was it a case of some middle manager finding the flag offensive, and as soon as the higher-ups

156
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,240
learned of what was going on, they reversed the decision?

157
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,240
Who knows?

158
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:41,820
The problem is that some activists on the left, again radical crazy types, don't simply

159
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:45,440
view the Gadsden flag as a confederate symbol, and the confederates were evil, therefore

160
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,520
the symbol is evil.

161
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:50,960
To them, the Gadsden flag represents rebellion against the centralized authority of the government,

162
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:54,340
and because the centralized authority of the government is currently progressive, rebellion

163
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:55,780
is therefore evil.

164
00:09:55,780 --> 00:09:57,520
This logic takes several forms.

165
00:09:57,520 --> 00:10:02,040
For some really radical progressives out there, because the state is currently progressive-oriented,

166
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:03,760
rejecting the state means rejecting progressivism.

167
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:08,480
Therefore, the Gadsden flag is a symbol of racism, because the progressive state is anti-racist,

168
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,680
and if you reject the progressive state, you must be pro-racist.

169
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:15,600
Meanwhile, there's also revolutionary socialists who want to overthrow the liberal democratic

170
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:19,760
capitalist state, but also pearl clutch at the rightoids who rioted in the capital on

171
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:20,760
January 6th.

172
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:24,640
It's simply that their revolt against power is good, and their enemies' revolt against

173
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:25,640
power is bad.

174
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:28,080
That's why they're cool with the red variant of the flag.

175
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:32,560
The only other logic that I've seen some progs use to justify this is that they're

176
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,680
simply keeping political symbols out of schools.

177
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:38,120
I'm actually okay with this, keep political symbols out of schools, but considering the

178
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:43,280
constant flood of middle school teachers putting up pride flags and BLM flags and whatever

179
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:47,300
the fuck else in their classrooms, saying that they suddenly want to be apolitical now

180
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:51,380
that it's a Gadsden flag, has to be the most blatantly hypocritical position I've

181
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:52,380
ever seen.

182
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:55,680
Of course, they will simply say that their flags aren't political, they're normal.

183
00:10:55,680 --> 00:11:00,680
They represent normal, good moral ideas, while the Gadsden flag is political.

184
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:04,420
There is power in claiming what gets to be normal and therefore allowed, versus what

185
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:06,600
is political and therefore controversial.

186
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:09,340
But again, this just reeks of hypocrisy.

187
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:13,940
Even in the most charitable interpretation, BLM and Pride are political movements, just

188
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:16,900
as any other civil rights-based movements are.

189
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:19,560
And again, everything is political, after all.

190
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:21,420
Their hypocrisy is the point.

191
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:24,900
Their politics good, their enemies' politics bad, simple as.

192
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:29,580
All of this is a sign that what I've said before about counterculture-ism is correct.

193
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:33,180
That progressives have become, in many important ways, the dominant culture.

194
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:38,100
That the old traditional culture of 50 years ago is now on the outside, it's now the counterculture.

195
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:40,280
Whether or not you think that's a good thing is besides the point.

196
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:44,100
What matters here is that the counterculture gets to claim the moral authority of being

197
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:47,360
the underdog, of being a downtrodden minority.

198
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:48,980
Conservatism is a weak enemy right now.

199
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:53,220
Nobody blinks an eye when you make fun of those old backwards Christians, or those weird

200
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:54,700
off-the-grid gun nuts.

201
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:57,140
That's just par for the course, that's just normal.

202
00:11:57,140 --> 00:12:01,140
But if you make fun of progressive morals and ideals in the same way, suddenly you begin

203
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:05,560
to run afoul of some very powerful machinery in our current society, which is all too happy

204
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:07,840
to see you deplatformed and unemployed.

205
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:10,460
The standard should be the same for both.

206
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:11,560
Everything should be mocked.

207
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:15,600
If that means I have to temporarily and superficially support right-wing movements until they become

208
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,040
dominant again, then so be it.

209
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,080
I'm not here for the left or for the right.

210
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:20,080
I'm here for balance.

211
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,600
I'm here for the laughs, fundamentally.

212
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:24,200
Anyway, I'm happy the kid got to keep his Gadsden flag.

213
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:26,440
And if you think it's a symbol of racism, then you're retarded.
