0	10160	I am very sure that if you're watching my channel, you know what the Gadsden flag is.
10160	13040	I'm not a libertarian, but I have a feeling a good chunk of you might be.
13040	14880	Nonetheless, here's a quick rundown.
14880	18600	The Gadsden flag is that yellow flag that you see libertarians flying all the time,
18600	21240	with the coiled snake in the Don't Tread On Me caption.
21240	25960	It was designed during the American Revolutionary War by Christopher Gadsden, a Brigadier General
25960	27260	in the Continental Army.
27260	31740	He gave the flag to Commodore Esek Hopkins, who took it as his personal banner.
31740	35620	Hopkins continued to use it after his promotion to Commander-in-Chief of the Continental Navy,
35620	38000	where it rapidly spread in popularity.
38000	41700	As one of America's first flag designs, it has a special place in the history books alongside
41700	44540	the colonial flag, the first national flag, and others.
44540	48780	In my previous video on flags, I talked about them in the context of them being national
48780	49780	symbols.
49780	53540	But the Gadsden flag is a symbol of a specific type of defiant ethic that is common in the
53540	54540	United States.
54540	58300	The idea is that the snake is not necessarily the most dangerous animal out there, but that
58300	61280	if you mess with it, you will most certainly be bit by it.
61280	65020	This represents the basic individualist ethic of the United States.
65020	69380	You might be able to use overwhelming centralized force to trample on the individual, but he
69380	73000	is going to give you so much trouble that your victory will not have been worth it.
73000	75300	There's almost a defeatist defiance here.
75300	78480	It's not the same kind of thing as an army marching off to a glorious victory.
78480	82140	The message is more like, if you come for me, I might not be able to beat you, but I
82140	85860	will destroy both of us if you try, which is a fitting sentiment for people who value
85860	90340	individual autonomy and liberty more than safe compliance like the Americans do.
90340	95300	In the modern era, it's been taken up by mostly libertarians, though occasionally leftoids
95300	97860	too, as a symbol of defiance against the government.
97860	100180	Here's what's really funny as a non-American.
100180	103980	When I was growing up, the Confederate flag didn't really have the connotations of slavery
103980	104980	attached to it.
104980	109180	Yes, we knew here that the American South was pro-slavery, but there was a non-distinct
109180	113740	cultural sense that the Confederate flag was primarily a generic symbol of defiance
113740	116780	against the government, which is what the Gadsden flag actually was.
116780	120020	Personally, I'm going to blame Dukes of Hazzard reruns for that one.
120020	124900	However, there has been a push to reclassify the Gadsden flag as a contemporary political
124900	129260	symbol rather than a military or historic one after its widespread use by the Tea Party
129260	130620	in 2009.
130620	133100	If you're too young to remember what the Tea Party was all about, here's a brief
133100	134340	primer on that too.
134340	138940	Obama won the election in 2008, and some rightoids in America weren't too happy about it.
138940	143920	A lot of their rejection of Obama was based in defiance of left-wing economic policies
143920	145300	that he wanted to implement.
145300	149140	There was some socially conservative stuff in there too, but economics was the movement's
149140	150260	primary focus.
150260	154260	A lot of left-wing commentators at the time replied to the Tea Party by simply describing
154260	158700	them as racist, partially because Obama is black, and partially because welfare programs
158700	162220	tend to benefit more non-whites than whites in the United States.
162220	166140	And yeah, there absolutely was some racism in the Tea Party, but again, it wasn't the
166140	167140	main focus.
167140	172060	For example, a paper in the Social Science Quarterly titled Tea Leaves and Southern Politics
172060	175980	determined that Tea Party supporters weren't driven by racial animosity but instead by
175980	177180	religious evangelism.
177180	181500	Nonetheless, it's after the Tea Party that the idea of the Gadsden flag representing
181500	185100	racism began to take hold in the modern cultural zeitgeist.
185100	189300	And to be honest, seeing it flown at both Charlottesville and the January 6th riot at
189300	191220	the Capitol did not help the image.
191220	195440	The Washington Post famously declared that the Gadsden flag is a Confederate icon, which
195440	198580	has just retarded since it predated the Confederacy by quite a bit.
198580	200480	But here's how they squared away.
200480	204460	Little is said about the Gadsden flag's ties to Confederates, who embraced it in their
204460	206580	own fight against federal authority.
206580	212600	From 1860 to 1862, the battle over Gadsden's symbols resembled modern meme wars.
212600	217220	Ultimately, the Union sacrificed Gadsden's Rattler because the Confederates had irreparably
217220	218220	tainted it.
218220	221100	This is very interesting to me because, like I said before, outside of America, when I
221100	225780	was growing up, there was this fuzzy cultural acceptance of the Confederate flag as a generic
225780	229800	symbol of defiance against the state, divorced from the particulars of Southern slavery.
229800	232860	The culture has since shifted, of course, it's now considered a flag of slavery here
232860	236520	too, and that process is now repeating itself with the Gadsden flag.
236520	238520	Do you see the logic being used here?
238520	241580	The Confederates were evil, the Confederacy rebelled against the government, the Confederacy
241580	245960	utilized symbols of rebellion against the government, therefore those symbols are tainted
245960	247640	with the evil of the Confederacy.
247640	252020	The issue is, ultimately, that the Gadsden flag has other meanings and was used by many
252020	256500	other movements before and after the American Civil War, while the Confederate flag really
256500	259700	doesn't have anything else going on for it other than its connection to the Confederacy.
259700	261980	A great example of what I mean is the Facies.
261980	266300	The Facies has been used as a symbol of legitimate political authority since the Roman era.
266300	270100	The Americans use it, the French use it, but also the Italian Fascists used it.
270100	275440	While its use associated with Fascism is representative of the bad guys of World War II, its use outside
275440	277900	of that time and place means something very different.
277900	281980	Nonetheless, that doesn't stop anarchists from declaring America as a Fascist state,
281980	283340	partially due to this connection.
283340	287500	The reason I'm talking about this topic today is because this kid went viral last
287500	288500	week.
288500	292340	Meet 12-year-old Jaden, who was kicked out of class yesterday in Colorado Springs for
292340	297120	having a Gadsden flag patch, which the school claims has origins with slavery.
297120	298980	To be honest, this kid seems like a memester.
298980	303700	There's not only a Gadsden flag on his camo backpack, but also a doge and a J-Rod for
303700	333560	the VP Revolution, based, okay, let's watch the video.
333560	342220	The Gadsden flag, the don't tread on me, okay, which is the Gadsden flag, okay, so
342220	351080	he, he, um, he, what's going to happen if he doesn't take it off, he, I mean, he is
351080	355680	able to go, I was actually just telling him, like, I was upset that he was missing so much
355680	360200	school, I'm like, ah, so I asked him, can he just take his stuff out of his bag and
360200	361200	go back to class?
361200	364800	And I just wanted him to go back to class, the bag can't go back, it's got a patch on
364800	367320	it, because we can't have that in and around other kids.
367320	370000	So that's what I was trying to, and then he said you were close, so I was like, oh, okay.
370000	374000	Yeah, it has nothing to do with slavery, that's like the revolutionary war patch that was
374000	377600	displayed when they were fighting the British, like, that wasn't, that's the revolution,
377600	384000	maybe you're thinking of, like, the, um, the Confederate, our Confederate flag?
384000	391000	Okay, I, so, I am just here to, I am here to enforce the policy that was, that was,
391000	398600	that was provided by the district, and definitely, you have every right to not agree with it,
398600	399600	I mean, yeah.
399600	403760	Because the ACLU says that he's allowed to wear that if you, like, go on their website.
403760	408120	So firstly, this woman here, I don't think she even has the authority to argue the point.
408120	411860	It sounds like she's been sent in to enforce the policy, whether or not she agrees with
411860	413000	it or understands it.
413000	416160	I don't blame her for not wanting to lose her job and just keeping her head down, but
416160	417440	that doesn't make it right.
417440	419920	So let's go over the email exchange with the school board.
419960	423980	The rationale they provide for judging the Gadsden flag as an unacceptable symbol comes
423980	425920	from a Washington Post article.
425920	430480	That article is about a 2014 suit with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, where
430480	434300	a workplace complaint was fired over a hat with the Gadsden flag on it.
434300	438280	The complaint was that the symbol was racially insensitive because Christopher Gadsden was
438280	440160	a slave owner and a slave trader.
440160	444160	He did, in fact, own slaves, as many American industrialists at the time did, but he was
444160	446880	ultimately in favor of abolishing slavery.
446880	450840	He simply wanted a gradual approach towards it in order to not disrupt the economy.
450840	456160	The EEOC concluded that the Gadsden flag originated in the Revolutionary War in a non-racial context
456160	460740	and that the flag and its slogans have been used to express various non-racial sentiments.
460740	465160	Why the school board cited this article as proof the flag is unacceptable is beyond my
465160	466160	understanding.
466160	469880	The school board then claimed that the Gadsden flag is tied to the Confederate flag and other
469880	474360	white supremacist groups and Patriot groups, this time citing an article about the January
474360	477440	6th Capitol riot, listing off the various flags present.
477440	480900	Number two on the list is the yellow Gadsden flag, giving the same justification as the
480900	481900	previous article.
481900	485600	The history of Gadsden himself, plus the other flag it's commonly flown with nowadays.
485600	490000	By the way, it's not exactly clear, but I think the reason this article says the yellow
490000	494200	Gadsden flag is specifically to differentiate it from its red variant.
494200	498740	All red, alligator instead of a snake, with the same font saying fuck around find out.
498740	502960	This is an anarcho-communist adaptation of the Gadsden flag, with the same anti-government
502960	506560	sentiment but this time in service of socialism instead of libertarianism.
506560	508680	It's a modern invention from the past five years.
508680	513200	There's a gimmick account on Twitter called Gators Daily, which began by posting pictures
513200	516640	and articles about alligators, exactly as you think, but it turned political sometime
516640	519140	around 2020 like so many other things did.
519140	522280	The original design of the red flag variant came out of this account, and they sell it
522280	525920	on their store alongside other lefty gator-themed merch.
525920	528460	The post that inspired the flag is still really funny though.
528460	532120	Going back to the school board, they eventually claimed that Jayden was violating this rule
532120	534680	with his Gadsden flag backpack patch.
534680	539240	Bringing to school clothing, paraphernalia, grooming, jewelry, etc. etc. that contains
539240	544480	advertisements, symbols, etc. etc. that refers to drugs, tobacco, alcohol, or weapons.
544480	548880	I assume that they mean weapons, since it's a Revolutionary War-era flag made by a military
548880	553360	man and used by the military meant to convey a sense of defiance against authority.
553360	555260	That's still a very tenuous connection.
555260	558880	In the end, Jayden kept showing up to school with his Gadsden flag patch, and the school
558880	562080	board eventually allowed him to keep it, ultimately claiming that they proudly support the concept
562120	565860	of the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, and that the flag has historic significance.
565860	569920	Was this a case of the school board bending to public pressure after the story went viral?
569920	574000	Or was it a case of some middle manager finding the flag offensive, and as soon as the higher-ups
574000	576240	learned of what was going on, they reversed the decision?
576240	577240	Who knows?
577240	581820	The problem is that some activists on the left, again radical crazy types, don't simply
581820	585440	view the Gadsden flag as a confederate symbol, and the confederates were evil, therefore
585440	586520	the symbol is evil.
586520	590960	To them, the Gadsden flag represents rebellion against the centralized authority of the government,
590960	594340	and because the centralized authority of the government is currently progressive, rebellion
594340	595780	is therefore evil.
595780	597520	This logic takes several forms.
597520	602040	For some really radical progressives out there, because the state is currently progressive-oriented,
602040	603760	rejecting the state means rejecting progressivism.
603760	608480	Therefore, the Gadsden flag is a symbol of racism, because the progressive state is anti-racist,
608480	610680	and if you reject the progressive state, you must be pro-racist.
610680	615600	Meanwhile, there's also revolutionary socialists who want to overthrow the liberal democratic
615600	619760	capitalist state, but also pearl clutch at the rightoids who rioted in the capital on
619760	620760	January 6th.
620760	624640	It's simply that their revolt against power is good, and their enemies' revolt against
624640	625640	power is bad.
625640	628080	That's why they're cool with the red variant of the flag.
628080	632560	The only other logic that I've seen some progs use to justify this is that they're
632560	634680	simply keeping political symbols out of schools.
634680	638120	I'm actually okay with this, keep political symbols out of schools, but considering the
638120	643280	constant flood of middle school teachers putting up pride flags and BLM flags and whatever
643280	647300	the fuck else in their classrooms, saying that they suddenly want to be apolitical now
647300	651380	that it's a Gadsden flag, has to be the most blatantly hypocritical position I've
651380	652380	ever seen.
652380	655680	Of course, they will simply say that their flags aren't political, they're normal.
655680	660680	They represent normal, good moral ideas, while the Gadsden flag is political.
660680	664420	There is power in claiming what gets to be normal and therefore allowed, versus what
664420	666600	is political and therefore controversial.
666600	669340	But again, this just reeks of hypocrisy.
669340	673940	Even in the most charitable interpretation, BLM and Pride are political movements, just
673940	676900	as any other civil rights-based movements are.
676900	679560	And again, everything is political, after all.
679560	681420	Their hypocrisy is the point.
681420	684900	Their politics good, their enemies' politics bad, simple as.
684900	689580	All of this is a sign that what I've said before about counterculture-ism is correct.
689580	693180	That progressives have become, in many important ways, the dominant culture.
693180	698100	That the old traditional culture of 50 years ago is now on the outside, it's now the counterculture.
698100	700280	Whether or not you think that's a good thing is besides the point.
700280	704100	What matters here is that the counterculture gets to claim the moral authority of being
704100	707360	the underdog, of being a downtrodden minority.
707360	708980	Conservatism is a weak enemy right now.
708980	713220	Nobody blinks an eye when you make fun of those old backwards Christians, or those weird
713220	714700	off-the-grid gun nuts.
714700	717140	That's just par for the course, that's just normal.
717140	721140	But if you make fun of progressive morals and ideals in the same way, suddenly you begin
721140	725560	to run afoul of some very powerful machinery in our current society, which is all too happy
725560	727840	to see you deplatformed and unemployed.
727840	730460	The standard should be the same for both.
730460	731560	Everything should be mocked.
731560	735600	If that means I have to temporarily and superficially support right-wing movements until they become
735600	737040	dominant again, then so be it.
737040	739080	I'm not here for the left or for the right.
739080	740080	I'm here for balance.
740080	741600	I'm here for the laughs, fundamentally.
741600	744200	Anyway, I'm happy the kid got to keep his Gadsden flag.
744200	746440	And if you think it's a symbol of racism, then you're retarded.
