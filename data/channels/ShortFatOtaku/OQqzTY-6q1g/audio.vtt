00:00.000 --> 00:10.160
I am very sure that if you're watching my channel, you know what the Gadsden flag is.

00:10.160 --> 00:13.040
I'm not a libertarian, but I have a feeling a good chunk of you might be.

00:13.040 --> 00:14.880
Nonetheless, here's a quick rundown.

00:14.880 --> 00:18.600
The Gadsden flag is that yellow flag that you see libertarians flying all the time,

00:18.600 --> 00:21.240
with the coiled snake in the Don't Tread On Me caption.

00:21.240 --> 00:25.960
It was designed during the American Revolutionary War by Christopher Gadsden, a Brigadier General

00:25.960 --> 00:27.260
in the Continental Army.

00:27.260 --> 00:31.740
He gave the flag to Commodore Esek Hopkins, who took it as his personal banner.

00:31.740 --> 00:35.620
Hopkins continued to use it after his promotion to Commander-in-Chief of the Continental Navy,

00:35.620 --> 00:38.000
where it rapidly spread in popularity.

00:38.000 --> 00:41.700
As one of America's first flag designs, it has a special place in the history books alongside

00:41.700 --> 00:44.540
the colonial flag, the first national flag, and others.

00:44.540 --> 00:48.780
In my previous video on flags, I talked about them in the context of them being national

00:48.780 --> 00:49.780
symbols.

00:49.780 --> 00:53.540
But the Gadsden flag is a symbol of a specific type of defiant ethic that is common in the

00:53.540 --> 00:54.540
United States.

00:54.540 --> 00:58.300
The idea is that the snake is not necessarily the most dangerous animal out there, but that

00:58.300 --> 01:01.280
if you mess with it, you will most certainly be bit by it.

01:01.280 --> 01:05.020
This represents the basic individualist ethic of the United States.

01:05.020 --> 01:09.380
You might be able to use overwhelming centralized force to trample on the individual, but he

01:09.380 --> 01:13.000
is going to give you so much trouble that your victory will not have been worth it.

01:13.000 --> 01:15.300
There's almost a defeatist defiance here.

01:15.300 --> 01:18.480
It's not the same kind of thing as an army marching off to a glorious victory.

01:18.480 --> 01:22.140
The message is more like, if you come for me, I might not be able to beat you, but I

01:22.140 --> 01:25.860
will destroy both of us if you try, which is a fitting sentiment for people who value

01:25.860 --> 01:30.340
individual autonomy and liberty more than safe compliance like the Americans do.

01:30.340 --> 01:35.300
In the modern era, it's been taken up by mostly libertarians, though occasionally leftoids

01:35.300 --> 01:37.860
too, as a symbol of defiance against the government.

01:37.860 --> 01:40.180
Here's what's really funny as a non-American.

01:40.180 --> 01:43.980
When I was growing up, the Confederate flag didn't really have the connotations of slavery

01:43.980 --> 01:44.980
attached to it.

01:44.980 --> 01:49.180
Yes, we knew here that the American South was pro-slavery, but there was a non-distinct

01:49.180 --> 01:53.740
cultural sense that the Confederate flag was primarily a generic symbol of defiance

01:53.740 --> 01:56.780
against the government, which is what the Gadsden flag actually was.

01:56.780 --> 02:00.020
Personally, I'm going to blame Dukes of Hazzard reruns for that one.

02:00.020 --> 02:04.900
However, there has been a push to reclassify the Gadsden flag as a contemporary political

02:04.900 --> 02:09.260
symbol rather than a military or historic one after its widespread use by the Tea Party

02:09.260 --> 02:10.620
in 2009.

02:10.620 --> 02:13.100
If you're too young to remember what the Tea Party was all about, here's a brief

02:13.100 --> 02:14.340
primer on that too.

02:14.340 --> 02:18.940
Obama won the election in 2008, and some rightoids in America weren't too happy about it.

02:18.940 --> 02:23.920
A lot of their rejection of Obama was based in defiance of left-wing economic policies

02:23.920 --> 02:25.300
that he wanted to implement.

02:25.300 --> 02:29.140
There was some socially conservative stuff in there too, but economics was the movement's

02:29.140 --> 02:30.260
primary focus.

02:30.260 --> 02:34.260
A lot of left-wing commentators at the time replied to the Tea Party by simply describing

02:34.260 --> 02:38.700
them as racist, partially because Obama is black, and partially because welfare programs

02:38.700 --> 02:42.220
tend to benefit more non-whites than whites in the United States.

02:42.220 --> 02:46.140
And yeah, there absolutely was some racism in the Tea Party, but again, it wasn't the

02:46.140 --> 02:47.140
main focus.

02:47.140 --> 02:52.060
For example, a paper in the Social Science Quarterly titled Tea Leaves and Southern Politics

02:52.060 --> 02:55.980
determined that Tea Party supporters weren't driven by racial animosity but instead by

02:55.980 --> 02:57.180
religious evangelism.

02:57.180 --> 03:01.500
Nonetheless, it's after the Tea Party that the idea of the Gadsden flag representing

03:01.500 --> 03:05.100
racism began to take hold in the modern cultural zeitgeist.

03:05.100 --> 03:09.300
And to be honest, seeing it flown at both Charlottesville and the January 6th riot at

03:09.300 --> 03:11.220
the Capitol did not help the image.

03:11.220 --> 03:15.440
The Washington Post famously declared that the Gadsden flag is a Confederate icon, which

03:15.440 --> 03:18.580
has just retarded since it predated the Confederacy by quite a bit.

03:18.580 --> 03:20.480
But here's how they squared away.

03:20.480 --> 03:24.460
Little is said about the Gadsden flag's ties to Confederates, who embraced it in their

03:24.460 --> 03:26.580
own fight against federal authority.

03:26.580 --> 03:32.600
From 1860 to 1862, the battle over Gadsden's symbols resembled modern meme wars.

03:32.600 --> 03:37.220
Ultimately, the Union sacrificed Gadsden's Rattler because the Confederates had irreparably

03:37.220 --> 03:38.220
tainted it.

03:38.220 --> 03:41.100
This is very interesting to me because, like I said before, outside of America, when I

03:41.100 --> 03:45.780
was growing up, there was this fuzzy cultural acceptance of the Confederate flag as a generic

03:45.780 --> 03:49.800
symbol of defiance against the state, divorced from the particulars of Southern slavery.

03:49.800 --> 03:52.860
The culture has since shifted, of course, it's now considered a flag of slavery here

03:52.860 --> 03:56.520
too, and that process is now repeating itself with the Gadsden flag.

03:56.520 --> 03:58.520
Do you see the logic being used here?

03:58.520 --> 04:01.580
The Confederates were evil, the Confederacy rebelled against the government, the Confederacy

04:01.580 --> 04:05.960
utilized symbols of rebellion against the government, therefore those symbols are tainted

04:05.960 --> 04:07.640
with the evil of the Confederacy.

04:07.640 --> 04:12.020
The issue is, ultimately, that the Gadsden flag has other meanings and was used by many

04:12.020 --> 04:16.500
other movements before and after the American Civil War, while the Confederate flag really

04:16.500 --> 04:19.700
doesn't have anything else going on for it other than its connection to the Confederacy.

04:19.700 --> 04:21.980
A great example of what I mean is the Facies.

04:21.980 --> 04:26.300
The Facies has been used as a symbol of legitimate political authority since the Roman era.

04:26.300 --> 04:30.100
The Americans use it, the French use it, but also the Italian Fascists used it.

04:30.100 --> 04:35.440
While its use associated with Fascism is representative of the bad guys of World War II, its use outside

04:35.440 --> 04:37.900
of that time and place means something very different.

04:37.900 --> 04:41.980
Nonetheless, that doesn't stop anarchists from declaring America as a Fascist state,

04:41.980 --> 04:43.340
partially due to this connection.

04:43.340 --> 04:47.500
The reason I'm talking about this topic today is because this kid went viral last

04:47.500 --> 04:48.500
week.

04:48.500 --> 04:52.340
Meet 12-year-old Jaden, who was kicked out of class yesterday in Colorado Springs for

04:52.340 --> 04:57.120
having a Gadsden flag patch, which the school claims has origins with slavery.

04:57.120 --> 04:58.980
To be honest, this kid seems like a memester.

04:58.980 --> 05:03.700
There's not only a Gadsden flag on his camo backpack, but also a doge and a J-Rod for

05:03.700 --> 05:33.560
the VP Revolution, based, okay, let's watch the video.

05:33.560 --> 05:42.220
The Gadsden flag, the don't tread on me, okay, which is the Gadsden flag, okay, so

05:42.220 --> 05:51.080
he, he, um, he, what's going to happen if he doesn't take it off, he, I mean, he is

05:51.080 --> 05:55.680
able to go, I was actually just telling him, like, I was upset that he was missing so much

05:55.680 --> 06:00.200
school, I'm like, ah, so I asked him, can he just take his stuff out of his bag and

06:00.200 --> 06:01.200
go back to class?

06:01.200 --> 06:04.800
And I just wanted him to go back to class, the bag can't go back, it's got a patch on

06:04.800 --> 06:07.320
it, because we can't have that in and around other kids.

06:07.320 --> 06:10.000
So that's what I was trying to, and then he said you were close, so I was like, oh, okay.

06:10.000 --> 06:14.000
Yeah, it has nothing to do with slavery, that's like the revolutionary war patch that was

06:14.000 --> 06:17.600
displayed when they were fighting the British, like, that wasn't, that's the revolution,

06:17.600 --> 06:24.000
maybe you're thinking of, like, the, um, the Confederate, our Confederate flag?

06:24.000 --> 06:31.000
Okay, I, so, I am just here to, I am here to enforce the policy that was, that was,

06:31.000 --> 06:38.600
that was provided by the district, and definitely, you have every right to not agree with it,

06:38.600 --> 06:39.600
I mean, yeah.

06:39.600 --> 06:43.760
Because the ACLU says that he's allowed to wear that if you, like, go on their website.

06:43.760 --> 06:48.120
So firstly, this woman here, I don't think she even has the authority to argue the point.

06:48.120 --> 06:51.860
It sounds like she's been sent in to enforce the policy, whether or not she agrees with

06:51.860 --> 06:53.000
it or understands it.

06:53.000 --> 06:56.160
I don't blame her for not wanting to lose her job and just keeping her head down, but

06:56.160 --> 06:57.440
that doesn't make it right.

06:57.440 --> 06:59.920
So let's go over the email exchange with the school board.

06:59.960 --> 07:03.980
The rationale they provide for judging the Gadsden flag as an unacceptable symbol comes

07:03.980 --> 07:05.920
from a Washington Post article.

07:05.920 --> 07:10.480
That article is about a 2014 suit with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, where

07:10.480 --> 07:14.300
a workplace complaint was fired over a hat with the Gadsden flag on it.

07:14.300 --> 07:18.280
The complaint was that the symbol was racially insensitive because Christopher Gadsden was

07:18.280 --> 07:20.160
a slave owner and a slave trader.

07:20.160 --> 07:24.160
He did, in fact, own slaves, as many American industrialists at the time did, but he was

07:24.160 --> 07:26.880
ultimately in favor of abolishing slavery.

07:26.880 --> 07:30.840
He simply wanted a gradual approach towards it in order to not disrupt the economy.

07:30.840 --> 07:36.160
The EEOC concluded that the Gadsden flag originated in the Revolutionary War in a non-racial context

07:36.160 --> 07:40.740
and that the flag and its slogans have been used to express various non-racial sentiments.

07:40.740 --> 07:45.160
Why the school board cited this article as proof the flag is unacceptable is beyond my

07:45.160 --> 07:46.160
understanding.

07:46.160 --> 07:49.880
The school board then claimed that the Gadsden flag is tied to the Confederate flag and other

07:49.880 --> 07:54.360
white supremacist groups and Patriot groups, this time citing an article about the January

07:54.360 --> 07:57.440
6th Capitol riot, listing off the various flags present.

07:57.440 --> 08:00.900
Number two on the list is the yellow Gadsden flag, giving the same justification as the

08:00.900 --> 08:01.900
previous article.

08:01.900 --> 08:05.600
The history of Gadsden himself, plus the other flag it's commonly flown with nowadays.

08:05.600 --> 08:10.000
By the way, it's not exactly clear, but I think the reason this article says the yellow

08:10.000 --> 08:14.200
Gadsden flag is specifically to differentiate it from its red variant.

08:14.200 --> 08:18.740
All red, alligator instead of a snake, with the same font saying fuck around find out.

08:18.740 --> 08:22.960
This is an anarcho-communist adaptation of the Gadsden flag, with the same anti-government

08:22.960 --> 08:26.560
sentiment but this time in service of socialism instead of libertarianism.

08:26.560 --> 08:28.680
It's a modern invention from the past five years.

08:28.680 --> 08:33.200
There's a gimmick account on Twitter called Gators Daily, which began by posting pictures

08:33.200 --> 08:36.640
and articles about alligators, exactly as you think, but it turned political sometime

08:36.640 --> 08:39.140
around 2020 like so many other things did.

08:39.140 --> 08:42.280
The original design of the red flag variant came out of this account, and they sell it

08:42.280 --> 08:45.920
on their store alongside other lefty gator-themed merch.

08:45.920 --> 08:48.460
The post that inspired the flag is still really funny though.

08:48.460 --> 08:52.120
Going back to the school board, they eventually claimed that Jayden was violating this rule

08:52.120 --> 08:54.680
with his Gadsden flag backpack patch.

08:54.680 --> 08:59.240
Bringing to school clothing, paraphernalia, grooming, jewelry, etc. etc. that contains

08:59.240 --> 09:04.480
advertisements, symbols, etc. etc. that refers to drugs, tobacco, alcohol, or weapons.

09:04.480 --> 09:08.880
I assume that they mean weapons, since it's a Revolutionary War-era flag made by a military

09:08.880 --> 09:13.360
man and used by the military meant to convey a sense of defiance against authority.

09:13.360 --> 09:15.260
That's still a very tenuous connection.

09:15.260 --> 09:18.880
In the end, Jayden kept showing up to school with his Gadsden flag patch, and the school

09:18.880 --> 09:22.080
board eventually allowed him to keep it, ultimately claiming that they proudly support the concept

09:22.120 --> 09:25.860
of the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, and that the flag has historic significance.

09:25.860 --> 09:29.920
Was this a case of the school board bending to public pressure after the story went viral?

09:29.920 --> 09:34.000
Or was it a case of some middle manager finding the flag offensive, and as soon as the higher-ups

09:34.000 --> 09:36.240
learned of what was going on, they reversed the decision?

09:36.240 --> 09:37.240
Who knows?

09:37.240 --> 09:41.820
The problem is that some activists on the left, again radical crazy types, don't simply

09:41.820 --> 09:45.440
view the Gadsden flag as a confederate symbol, and the confederates were evil, therefore

09:45.440 --> 09:46.520
the symbol is evil.

09:46.520 --> 09:50.960
To them, the Gadsden flag represents rebellion against the centralized authority of the government,

09:50.960 --> 09:54.340
and because the centralized authority of the government is currently progressive, rebellion

09:54.340 --> 09:55.780
is therefore evil.

09:55.780 --> 09:57.520
This logic takes several forms.

09:57.520 --> 10:02.040
For some really radical progressives out there, because the state is currently progressive-oriented,

10:02.040 --> 10:03.760
rejecting the state means rejecting progressivism.

10:03.760 --> 10:08.480
Therefore, the Gadsden flag is a symbol of racism, because the progressive state is anti-racist,

10:08.480 --> 10:10.680
and if you reject the progressive state, you must be pro-racist.

10:10.680 --> 10:15.600
Meanwhile, there's also revolutionary socialists who want to overthrow the liberal democratic

10:15.600 --> 10:19.760
capitalist state, but also pearl clutch at the rightoids who rioted in the capital on

10:19.760 --> 10:20.760
January 6th.

10:20.760 --> 10:24.640
It's simply that their revolt against power is good, and their enemies' revolt against

10:24.640 --> 10:25.640
power is bad.

10:25.640 --> 10:28.080
That's why they're cool with the red variant of the flag.

10:28.080 --> 10:32.560
The only other logic that I've seen some progs use to justify this is that they're

10:32.560 --> 10:34.680
simply keeping political symbols out of schools.

10:34.680 --> 10:38.120
I'm actually okay with this, keep political symbols out of schools, but considering the

10:38.120 --> 10:43.280
constant flood of middle school teachers putting up pride flags and BLM flags and whatever

10:43.280 --> 10:47.300
the fuck else in their classrooms, saying that they suddenly want to be apolitical now

10:47.300 --> 10:51.380
that it's a Gadsden flag, has to be the most blatantly hypocritical position I've

10:51.380 --> 10:52.380
ever seen.

10:52.380 --> 10:55.680
Of course, they will simply say that their flags aren't political, they're normal.

10:55.680 --> 11:00.680
They represent normal, good moral ideas, while the Gadsden flag is political.

11:00.680 --> 11:04.420
There is power in claiming what gets to be normal and therefore allowed, versus what

11:04.420 --> 11:06.600
is political and therefore controversial.

11:06.600 --> 11:09.340
But again, this just reeks of hypocrisy.

11:09.340 --> 11:13.940
Even in the most charitable interpretation, BLM and Pride are political movements, just

11:13.940 --> 11:16.900
as any other civil rights-based movements are.

11:16.900 --> 11:19.560
And again, everything is political, after all.

11:19.560 --> 11:21.420
Their hypocrisy is the point.

11:21.420 --> 11:24.900
Their politics good, their enemies' politics bad, simple as.

11:24.900 --> 11:29.580
All of this is a sign that what I've said before about counterculture-ism is correct.

11:29.580 --> 11:33.180
That progressives have become, in many important ways, the dominant culture.

11:33.180 --> 11:38.100
That the old traditional culture of 50 years ago is now on the outside, it's now the counterculture.

11:38.100 --> 11:40.280
Whether or not you think that's a good thing is besides the point.

11:40.280 --> 11:44.100
What matters here is that the counterculture gets to claim the moral authority of being

11:44.100 --> 11:47.360
the underdog, of being a downtrodden minority.

11:47.360 --> 11:48.980
Conservatism is a weak enemy right now.

11:48.980 --> 11:53.220
Nobody blinks an eye when you make fun of those old backwards Christians, or those weird

11:53.220 --> 11:54.700
off-the-grid gun nuts.

11:54.700 --> 11:57.140
That's just par for the course, that's just normal.

11:57.140 --> 12:01.140
But if you make fun of progressive morals and ideals in the same way, suddenly you begin

12:01.140 --> 12:05.560
to run afoul of some very powerful machinery in our current society, which is all too happy

12:05.560 --> 12:07.840
to see you deplatformed and unemployed.

12:07.840 --> 12:10.460
The standard should be the same for both.

12:10.460 --> 12:11.560
Everything should be mocked.

12:11.560 --> 12:15.600
If that means I have to temporarily and superficially support right-wing movements until they become

12:15.600 --> 12:17.040
dominant again, then so be it.

12:17.040 --> 12:19.080
I'm not here for the left or for the right.

12:19.080 --> 12:20.080
I'm here for balance.

12:20.080 --> 12:21.600
I'm here for the laughs, fundamentally.

12:21.600 --> 12:24.200
Anyway, I'm happy the kid got to keep his Gadsden flag.

12:24.200 --> 12:26.440
And if you think it's a symbol of racism, then you're retarded.
