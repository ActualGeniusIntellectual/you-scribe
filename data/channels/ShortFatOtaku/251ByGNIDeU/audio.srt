1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Hey guys, Dev here.

2
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,180
Now I know we said other gamergate videos were coming out first, and they're all still

3
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:28,180
coming.

4
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:32,460
But Camera Lady wanted this one rushed out just because of how ridiculous this all is.

5
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:33,820
Let me tell you about my evening.

6
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:39,340
I came home, recorded a rather enjoyable session of Borderlands 2 Let's Plays with Lindsay,

7
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:40,340
Ian, and Dave.

8
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:43,340
Went outside, troubled the driveway.

9
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:46,860
As I was finishing up, Camera Lady was coming home.

10
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:51,340
She told me there was an absolutely riveting hour of TV that we had to check out.

11
00:00:51,340 --> 00:01:19,340
So let's see what's on the old telly tonight, shall we?

12
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:36,660
One of the players Ravi played with got carried away and killed him.

13
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:38,780
Well, that's kind of far out.

14
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:43,740
Mazes and monsters is a far out game.

15
00:01:43,740 --> 00:02:02,020
Well, that seems about right.

16
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:04,740
Was anybody seriously surprised at this?

17
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:09,300
Mainstream media has shown time and again whenever it tries to tackle not just gaming

18
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:12,820
but any kind of subculture, it fails miserably.

19
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:17,460
Everybody knew this was going to be a shitshow, especially coming from Law and Order, a show

20
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:21,540
that I've only seen my retiree father to ever actually watch.

21
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:24,860
But let's take a good look at just how ridiculous this gets.

22
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:29,440
Right off the bat, we've got the number one trope of any shitty episodic police drama.

23
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:35,140
Any time one of these shows decides to ham-fistedly do a story on a subculture, this tired technique

24
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:36,140
is trotted out.

25
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:41,140
We've got one guy, Ice-T this time, who's in the know about the subculture.

26
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:44,980
Well not really, but he's paid to poorly act like he's in the know.

27
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:47,920
Look at his fucking face, he's got no idea what he's saying.

28
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:51,740
So he rambles on about games, sprinkling in a bit of lingo here and there, which allows

29
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:57,820
middle-aged Samus Aran to ask, as she's not at all into games but at least wants to have

30
00:02:57,820 --> 00:02:59,980
some knowledge of what's going on around her.

31
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:03,340
This dynamic on its own isn't necessarily bad.

32
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:08,300
Every story needs exposition to establish itself, and one of the easiest and overused

33
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:12,780
ways is to bring in a clueless character willing to ask the questions an equally clueless

34
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:14,500
audience is also asking.

35
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:17,940
However, what spells trouble is pro-Jared over here.

36
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:27,820
Check him out.

37
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:32,460
See he's in the dark as much as she is, but his role in this dynamic is to react negatively

38
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:37,700
to any exposition given, as if to say, no matter what you actually say, this subculture

39
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:39,380
is bad, we disapprove.

40
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:44,260
When your clueless character exposition scene includes one of these guys, it's an immediate

41
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:49,140
red flag that this story has an agenda it wants to push, accuracy be damned.

42
00:03:49,140 --> 00:04:03,820
Oh shit, it's a 45 year old voice in a 20 year old body.

43
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:07,060
You know nobody's really talking about this line, but I think it's actually one of the

44
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:10,980
more telling ways on how out of touch this whole show is on its subject matter.

45
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:14,140
I get that the writers have an anti-gamer gate chip on their shoulder.

46
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:18,440
I get that they've swallowed the media narrative of sexism and harassment over the truth of

47
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:19,560
corruption and ethics.

48
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:22,860
I get that they're trying to tell a story that depicts women's struggles in predominantly

49
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:26,940
male spaces, trying and failing, but trying nonetheless.

50
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:32,060
But if you actually knew anything not only about the subculture you're attacking, but

51
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:36,340
the position you are taking to attack that subculture, why didn't you have your wardrobe

52
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:38,500
department put a fedora on this guy?

53
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:41,020
What's too insult here, just a ball cap?

54
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:45,100
As the scene stands, her line makes absolutely no sense.

55
00:04:45,100 --> 00:05:02,220
Woah woah woah hold up, pause it right there.

56
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:03,500
Is that the Zelda font?

57
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:04,500
I think it is.

58
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:08,500
Okay, I know from the story structure of this episode, as well as the agenda the writers

59
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:12,460
are trying to push, that the female indie developer is likely meant to be either Brianna

60
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:17,580
Wu or Zoe Quinn, and you're actually comparing their work to the Legend of Zelda?

61
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:20,980
I don't want to ever downplay physical rape or sexual assault.

62
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:25,340
I can confidently speak for every single member of gamergate when I say that, if and when

63
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:30,060
this type of thing happens in real life, we don't support it and we want to see the perpetrators

64
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:31,180
brought to justice.

65
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:35,180
But the show sets it up like this is simply what video game culture is.

66
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:38,860
Real life, women getting raped in a bathroom as a normal and accepted occurrence.

67
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:42,140
Angry Joe recently had the best reply to something like this.

68
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:46,180
That's not fucking gaming culture, that's shitty people culture.

69
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:47,180
What happened?

70
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:51,340
These guys, they just can't stand women and gaming.

71
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:55,820
Now here's the first real obvious clue that the writers had an ideological axe to grind.

72
00:05:55,820 --> 00:06:00,380
This line, they can't stand women and gaming, is lifted directly from the anti-gamergate

73
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:01,740
straw manual.

74
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:06,620
In real life, it's a blatantly and provably untrue claim, used when the unethical want

75
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:08,000
to hide their crimes.

76
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,820
But in the show, they just slap it on to the end of an attempted rape and call it a day.

77
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:17,180
In essence, the show, in concocting its fiction, is trying to give further credence in the

78
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:21,100
real world to the use of sexism as a scapegoat to hide unethical behavior.

79
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:24,940
What did they do to you?

80
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:29,180
They leveled up.

81
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:30,180
Oh come on.

82
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:34,500
Ignoring the fact that, unless you're fucking camera lady, it's really unlikely for you

83
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:37,120
to mouth off a quip after an attempted rape?

84
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,460
This sort of thing happens all over this episode.

85
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:42,220
If you die in the game, you die for real guys.

86
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:47,980
How many cliched, hackneyed pieces of garbage tackling gaming used puns involving game over,

87
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:50,020
next level, or reset button?

88
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:52,780
How do these people still have jobs writing such drivel?

89
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:57,220
Well in their world, developers like guys, and some guys aren't ready to give a girl

90
00:06:57,220 --> 00:06:58,220
that power.

91
00:06:58,260 --> 00:07:01,300
I'm not sure if developers are really considered gods by gamers.

92
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:03,060
Kamiya gets shit on constantly.

93
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:06,420
Kojima is considered a brilliant nutjob megalomaniac.

94
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:10,940
Gamers seem to look down on devs more often than not, especially the shitty devs who cut

95
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:11,940
corners.

96
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:14,140
The only one who's really considered a god is Miyamoto.

97
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:18,100
And when you look at this list of actual women in gaming instead of only listening to the

98
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:23,260
ones screaming loudly on Twitter 24-7, a lot of these women actually get treated just as

99
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:24,940
well as their male counterparts.

100
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:30,660
In fact, if there's any harassment, it's from sex-negative Western women directed towards

101
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:33,660
Asian women developers for daring to work on projects like Bayonetta.

102
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:37,660
Did she also tell you these creeps have a grudge against you and your game?

103
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:39,660
There's nothing in the game for them to be angry about.

104
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:40,660
You can choose how you play.

105
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:45,660
You can wage peace or war, have a patriarchy or a matriarchy, be eco-conscious or industrialized.

106
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:46,660
I know.

107
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:51,660
I read on Kotaku that it's better than Civ V with the Brave New World expansion pack.

108
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:52,660
I read on Kotaku.

109
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:54,660
Oh man, read on Kotaku?

110
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:56,660
Better than Civ V?

111
00:07:56,660 --> 00:08:01,660
What's worse, the fact that Ice-T reads Kotaku vigilantly, that he's enough of a plebeian

112
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:03,660
that he doesn't recognize the mastery of Civ IV.

113
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:06,660
This is really just another one of those hit pieces done by people who know absolutely

114
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:08,660
nothing about games, isn't it?

115
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:11,660
With a couple of added anti-Gamergate narrative sprinkles on top.

116
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:16,660
This is Reina Punjabi, the indie dev in charge of Amazonian Warriors, a game that, according

117
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:18,660
to the story, everybody hates.

118
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:23,660
Now, if Amazonian Warriors were actually hated as much as the story lets on, and this were

119
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:26,660
the real world, here's what would happen.

120
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:32,660
If Punjabi were a member, or friends with members of Game Journal pros, Amazonian Warriors

121
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:36,660
would be getting disproportionate press on Kotaku, Polygon, etc.

122
00:08:36,660 --> 00:08:41,660
Gamergate would protest a game due to its lack of quality and due to the apparent collusion

123
00:08:41,660 --> 00:08:43,660
regarding journalists reporting on their friends' games.

124
00:08:43,660 --> 00:08:47,660
Gamergate would be labeled sexist and racist for doing so by the mainstream media.

125
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:52,660
Amazonian Warriors may or may not get on Steam, but it ultimately probably wouldn't sell

126
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:53,660
very well.

127
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:57,660
Punjabi, and the clique that supports her, would likely blame the failure of her game

128
00:08:57,660 --> 00:08:58,660
on misogyny.

129
00:08:58,660 --> 00:09:01,660
Gamergate, meanwhile, would just play better games.

130
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:03,660
Like Civ V.

131
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:08,660
But, this is the insane world of right-wing masquerading as progressive conspiracy theories,

132
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:12,660
where every single tumblr box is ticked, every single mainstream media gamergate stereotype

133
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:13,660
is employed.

134
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:17,660
A 4chan knockoff called Redchan, complete with viral sub-threads?

135
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:18,660
Check.

136
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:19,660
Where was that posted?

137
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:20,660
The sub-thread on Redchan.

138
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:21,660
Swatting?

139
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:22,660
Check.

140
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:27,660
Even though the vast majority of swatting targets in real life are male gamers and streamers.

141
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:32,660
Hoodie, an off-brand anonymous mask wearing teens threatening SJWs?

142
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:33,660
Check.

143
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:37,660
She and her social justice warriors don't live gaming now?

144
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:39,660
We will meet them.

145
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:41,660
Accusing them of being cyber-terrorists?

146
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:42,660
Check.

147
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:45,660
This is, it's terrorism.

148
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:46,660
Wait, wrong clip.

149
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:47,660
Uh, check.

150
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:48,660
The cyber-terrorists win.

151
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:54,660
Hacking a lighting control panel at a stage event through the internet and screaming,

152
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:58,660
no social justice in gaming in a bane knockoff voice?

153
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:04,660
At this point in the story, things start to pick up.

154
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:09,660
It becomes less about individual instances of idiocy, and more about chase scene after

155
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:14,660
chase scene on the trails of three criminals who kidnap, gang rape, and plan to execute

156
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:19,660
Punjabi, while Ice-T injects every so often to explain another bit of gamer lingo or make

157
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:20,660
another dumb pun.

158
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:24,660
Their videos are framed a lot like, you guessed it, ISIS videos.

159
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:28,660
Remember, the writers are taking pages from the anti-gamer propaganda handbook, and bigots

160
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:33,660
have been unfoundedly comparing gamers and gamergate to ISIS for nearly six months now.

161
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:37,660
Nobody's surprised that eventually somebody would stoop so low as to film a farce like

162
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:38,660
this.

163
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:40,660
The only question was how long until it happened.

164
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:45,660
Also, the group uses a skull and grenade logo in the background of every single video they take.

165
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:47,660
Hey, wait.

166
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:49,660
That's Rogue Star's symbol.

167
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:53,660
They're even alluding to Rogue, calling the main guy the thematically similar name of

168
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:54,660
Acid Rain.

169
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:57,660
Holy shit, these people are insane.

170
00:10:57,660 --> 00:11:02,660
Also, I don't know if anybody noticed this, but the no-name brand Rogue Star symbol shows

171
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:06,660
up all over the episode, and not just in the backgrounds of the assault videos.

172
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:09,660
Why is it on the corner of the game footage the cop is playing?

173
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:11,660
Why is it on the corner of everybody's game?

174
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:13,660
Did I miss something?

175
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:16,660
Hey, Rogue Star, how about you tweet Ice-T and see if you can clear this all up for us?

176
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:18,660
Ohhhhh.

177
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:23,660
The show ends with a predictable firefight, employing more gamer quips, revealing the

178
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:28,660
tired plot twist that the gamers can no longer see the difference between the game and reality,

179
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:30,660
and this very memorable line.

180
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:32,660
Women and gaming.

181
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:34,660
What did I expect?

182
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:38,660
I know anti-gamergate probably won't believe me, but I don't want to see this happen

183
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:39,660
in real life.

184
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:43,660
I don't want to see a woman developer beaten and raped out of the industry.

185
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:49,660
If a person of any gender makes a bad game, and it sees an undeserved push via press or

186
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:53,660
awards due to corruption within the industry, I want to see the journalist lose their jobs,

187
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:57,660
I want to see the award shows shut down for fraud, and I want to see the developer's

188
00:11:57,660 --> 00:11:58,660
game not sell.

189
00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:00,660
But nobody wants to see rape and assault.

190
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:05,660
Reyna, you're asking the audience, women and gaming, what did we expect?

191
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:07,660
Well, I'll answer that question.

192
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:12,660
But I'll send my answer towards the real life women and men in gaming, the people who

193
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:18,660
are not victims of rape by gamers, but rather are the sources of corruption within our industry.

194
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:19,660
What did we expect?

195
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:22,660
We expected ethical conduct.

196
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:27,660
On top of being anti-gamer propaganda, this episode is meant to be a thinly veiled gamergate

197
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:28,660
show.

198
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:31,660
It fails due to its lack of focus on the topic of gamergate.

199
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:32,660
Ethics.

200
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:37,660
This show is what anti-gamers desperately wish gamergate was in real life, so that their

201
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:39,660
baseless vilification could become true.

202
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:42,660
In essence, this is anti-gamergate pornography.

203
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:46,660
I'd like to take a minute and discuss a few extra things at the end here.

204
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:49,660
This episode is not groundbreaking, nor is it unique.

205
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:54,660
We've seen this type of moral panic raised by conservatives for years, from the invention

206
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:58,660
of the automobile allowing youth to leave town during a Sunday, to rock and roll with

207
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:04,660
Elvis throwing up the horns, to Dungeons and Dragons turning children into satanic ritualists

208
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:07,660
sacrificing goats and whatever, and now with video games.

209
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:12,660
The specter of the anti-gamer began to rise in the mid 90s, and we thought we'd finally

210
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:15,660
struck it down with the disbarment of Jack Thompson.

211
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:20,660
With the rise of gamergate, its opposition has brought the hysteria back in full force.

212
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:23,660
But why is this type of stuff just so effective in our larger society?

213
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:27,660
In our traditional culture, and really in most traditional cultures, males are allowed

214
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:29,660
to occupy one of three social spaces.

215
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:32,660
Boiled down, they are baby, adult, and outsider.

216
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:34,660
The baby is a male child.

217
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:39,660
He has no agency of his own, and is cared for and controlled by both women and men in different ways.

218
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:45,660
He is also generally not thought to be responsible for his actions, except in extraordinary circumstances.

219
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:49,660
The adult is the mature male, not just physically, but socially.

220
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:52,660
He is required to be a leader when called to the task.

221
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:55,660
He is required to be a warrior when there is fighting to be done.

222
00:13:55,660 --> 00:14:00,660
He is required to hunt or otherwise provide not only for himself, but for other people.

223
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:04,660
He is required to work to earn his masculinity.

224
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:07,660
The outsider is the natural default of the male.

225
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:11,660
All males, if they're not babies or adults, are considered outsiders.

226
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:16,660
Outsiders can be enemies, or they can be people unwilling to contribute to society.

227
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:21,660
This is obviously a very tribal definition of masculinity, and while it may have been useful in ages past,

228
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:23,660
it still exists as a holdover today.

229
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:27,660
Little boys are still coddled, but that practice has begun to erode in recent years.

230
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:33,660
Adult men are still required to be breadwinners and providers, soldiers and leaders, even if they aren't inclined to be.

231
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:37,660
And outsiders? They're the deadbeats for not wanting to be fathers.

232
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:41,660
The man-children, for enjoying pastimes conservative society has deemed childish.

233
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:49,660
Lazy for not working out, roid ragers for working out, sissies for being sensitive, assholes for not being sensitive, and so on.

234
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:56,660
Male privilege, as Second Wave Feminism describes it, exists, but only adult men have access to it.

235
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:58,660
Babies do not, outsiders do not.

236
00:14:58,660 --> 00:15:05,660
Just as women are forced into the roles of either Madonna or whore, men are forced into the roles of either adult or outsider.

237
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:13,660
And just as individual women are human, with far more complexities than either role allows them, individual men are just as human.

238
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:15,660
So, let's bring us back to gaming.

239
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:22,660
The show immediately begins by framing the main story around the chief's adopted son, who's been giving her some trouble.

240
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:28,660
He's rough and tumble, his form of play is very active in comparison to the two adorable girls who just sit quietly.

241
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:29,660
The given reply is,

242
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:34,660
Boys run around and break things, they hurt themselves, it's in all their DNA.

243
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:40,660
The implication here is clear, you have a baby, one day he will grow into an outsider if left on his own.

244
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:42,660
You must teach him to be an adult instead.

245
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:50,660
This is simply the conservative idea of women existing to be a civilizing force in men's lives, repackaged to fit the young male narrative this show is about to present.

246
00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:57,660
This is all too clear later in the show, when she stares at a photo and wonders if her boy is going to grow into one of those nasty, vile gamers.

247
00:15:57,660 --> 00:16:02,660
Most of the men in the show are portrayed to be undesirables, entirely absorbed in their gaming hobby.

248
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:09,660
They're outsiders, they're certainly too old to be babies, and they've yet to willingly take on all the duties men their age are expected to take on by society.

249
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:13,660
This is obvious in how they act, how they talk, how they look.

250
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:20,660
The show presents them as if they hate not only women but themselves, solely because they enjoy an activity that their society considers childish.

251
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:25,660
They know of their outsider status, they hate being a member of that class, but they cannot change.

252
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:28,660
That is pointed out rather quickly in this scene.

253
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:36,660
I don't really need to say anymore, do I?

254
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:43,660
She even later berates one of her co-workers for playing video games, where he has to reassure her that no, he's actually an adult, not an outsider.

255
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:46,660
I fought off those tendencies long ago, ma'am.

256
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:48,660
Of course in real life, humans are more complicated than this.

257
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:52,660
One can obviously be a mature, responsible adult and be a gamer.

258
00:16:52,660 --> 00:17:01,660
But forcing the mutually exclusive triad of male identities of baby adult outsider into the portrayal of every single male character in the show

259
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:07,660
is exactly what is thematically required to make the episode operate as an anti-gamer propaganda piece.

260
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:11,660
It's certainly not good storytelling, but it is functional propaganda.

261
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:19,660
And that propaganda is reliant on this very conservative and ultimately grossly inaccurate understanding of men

262
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:25,660
and portrayal of both gamers and the gamer-gate they so very much want to mention but never actually do.

263
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:28,660
Moreover, for a show that wants to push a progressivist agenda,

264
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:36,660
well, not a real progressivist agenda, because if that were the case, they'd portray gamers as a diverse group that is actually not at all abusive, but you get what I'm saying.

265
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:42,660
Did you actually have to go with naming your Indian character Punjabi? Jesus.

266
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:48,660
I have to wonder, was the actress herself a bit offended by that, but just swallowed her pride and took the paycheck?

267
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:54,660
I don't know how it is anywhere else in the world, but where I'm from, Punjabi is generally considered a racial slur.

268
00:17:54,660 --> 00:18:03,660
And while thematically she's meant to be Brianna Wu or Zoe Quinn, she wears Anita Sarkeesian's earrings, purposefully I'm sure, and looks more like Jenny Barrage than anybody else.

269
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:10,660
Do keep in mind that last I heard, Jenny Barrage has received harassment for being a girl gamer as well as for trying to build basegamer.com,

270
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:18,660
but her harassment hasn't come from angry male gamers, her harassment has come from the angry supporters of the journalists and developers that oppose gamer-gate.

271
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:22,660
Law and order literally got nothing right in their story.

272
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:27,660
Speaking of those angry supporters of corruption in anti-gamer-gate, let's see what they have to say about this whole thing.

273
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:31,660
Here's Zoe Quinn hiding in a bathroom being crushed by the weight of it all.

274
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:37,660
I don't know if Law and Order should trigger you this much Zoe, if it does you should probably just turn the TV off and do something else.

275
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:50,660
Here's Rob Cipher describing exactly what Law and Order actually just did, and he says this quality film about social activism will annihilate the gamer-gate mind hive once and for all.

276
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:55,660
Yeah, I have a feeling it's not going to do that.

277
00:18:55,660 --> 00:19:02,660
Here's Warren Light, someone who actually works on the show, saying that women are thanking him for taking on misogyny in gaming.

278
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:05,660
Well you didn't do that, you made up a boogeyman.

279
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:12,660
Here's Brianna Wu, the part of the Law and Order episode that seems implausible is how there's an online threat to women and the police do something.

280
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:16,660
Yeah, the thing about threats is that they have to be proven, Brianna.

281
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:29,660
And so far, any threats towards you that I've seen has come from one Twitter account which got banned, and all of us are in complete support if Twitter decided to backtrace that account, get the IP, and have the person arrested.

282
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:34,660
And of course she says, I'm concerned about this Darknet Ice-T was warning us about.

283
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:41,660
Okay, Jonathan McIntosh often says that gamers cannot tell the difference between fantasy and real life.

284
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:52,660
The basis of the movies Mazes and Monsters and Skullduggery and a lot of other D&D propaganda was that people who play D&D cannot tell the difference between the game and real life.

285
00:19:52,660 --> 00:20:00,660
This is something that we hear a lot, and yet here's Brianna actually thinking that Ice-T's comments about the Darknet warrants real world investigation.

286
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:05,660
She also thinks she's Batman. Here's Ben Kucera, and this actually plays to a larger point.

287
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:12,660
He says it's kind of hard to be snarky about bad TV shows dramatizing this when vulnerable people are still actively targeted in the long term.

288
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:17,660
Anti-Gamergate is turning on this show. They weren't promoting it before. They're turning on it now.

289
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:25,660
I think it's because they're finally starting to realize that when they take their own narrative and play it out, it looks ridiculous. But more on that later.

290
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:27,660
Here's good ol' Alex Lifeshits.

291
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:39,660
I'm sure it isn't. Do keep in mind, though, that in the show, the threats were reported. People were traced.

292
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:45,660
If you've received threats, if Zoe's received threats, report them. Don't brag on the internet that you've reported them.

293
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:52,660
Don't make it a big thing because the police will inevitably say, hey, don't do that. Report them, do what they say, and get them caught.

294
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:57,660
I know Zoe has said, August never ends. August never ends because you don't want it to end.

295
00:20:57,660 --> 00:21:05,660
Here's Maya Kramer and Cara Ellison, both of them saying basically that the ending was a downer. Law and they've already won order.

296
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:10,660
Law and quit your job, women. Who cares what you do? It's true. The ending was a downer.

297
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:12,660
I don't want to see that happen to women. Absolutely not.

298
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:21,660
I do want to see corrupt people, men or women, lose their jobs. I do want to see them be punished legally, if applicable.

299
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:24,660
Nobody wants to see them raped. Nobody talks about that.

300
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:32,660
And here's social justice Kirby complaining that the internet is making memes again. Someone please plant the no fun allowed sign.

301
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:35,660
Here's everybody's favorite dog rapist, Sarah Butts.

302
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:43,660
The narrative of gamergate SVU was essentially that despite the best efforts of law enforcement, certain tragedies are unavoidable.

303
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:51,660
No, that wasn't the narrative. The narrative was that all gamers are terrible human beings and that is not true.

304
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:58,660
And they decided to stage a rape scene on a show in order to push that narrative.

305
00:21:58,660 --> 00:22:05,660
To slander an entire group of people, a very diverse group of people, all for their own ideological ends. It's disgusting.

306
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:12,660
And here's Zoe saying that the story was basically all about her and that she should have been contacted by law and order to get her permission to actually do the episode.

307
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:16,660
I think that's why they went with somebody who wasn't you, Zoe.

308
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:23,660
Zoe, the world doesn't revolve around you. Gamergate doesn't even revolve around you. You're the Franz Ferdinand of gamergate.

309
00:22:23,660 --> 00:22:32,660
And I must point out, I know that this person wasn't based on you because as shitty as Amazonian Warriors is, it still seems to be a lot better than Depression Quest.

310
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:35,660
I'll end it off with Jason Schreier because this kind of speaks to my larger point.

311
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:44,660
He says law and order is a terrible television show. He makes fun of Ice-T. He says that Civilization 5 is obviously much better than Amazonian Warrior.

312
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:52,660
And he wrote an article on Kotaku about it. Now his Kotaku article entitled, So that was law and order's gamergate episode, is very very negative.

313
00:22:53,660 --> 00:23:05,660
And I think this is very interesting because the narrative that these journalists and these developers have pushed this whole time, pushed for six months, is that women are being harassed.

314
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:18,660
There is no ethical violation anywhere. This is about harassment of women. This is about women being chased from their homes. This is about women being hit with rape threats, women being hit with death threats.

315
00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:25,660
That's their narrative. That's what they're saying. That's what they're saying everywhere they can, anywhere they can.

316
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:37,660
But suddenly, when a show like, say, Law and Order comes along, takes that narrative and actually puts it into practice, actually crafts a story from that narrative, they release it publicly and people watch it.

317
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:43,660
Suddenly it's a bad episode. That episode is based on your narrative. That is what you're pushing.

318
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:53,660
It's an untrue narrative, yes, but it's the narrative that you push. And now various writers are latching onto that narrative, making stories out of it, and throwing it back at you.

319
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:56,660
And now you're seeing why you're so incorrect?

320
00:23:56,660 --> 00:24:04,660
A lot of gamergate's opponents thought that this Law and Order thing was going to be like a nail in the coffin for gamergate, and it's just backfiring in their faces.

321
00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:12,660
Because people are beginning to see just how ridiculous, how wildly out there the claims of anti-gamergate are.

322
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:18,660
The narrative of misogyny and death threats and harassment culminated in this episode.

323
00:24:18,660 --> 00:24:29,660
And now that people are seeing what actually happens when this shit goes down, and comparing it to what's actually happening in gamergate in real life, they're realizing, oh hey, that's not gamergate.

324
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:44,660
Now I would go over what pro-gamergate thought of the episode. However if you go on twitter and check out the hashtag, it is 100% shitposting and new memes. Thanks guys.

325
00:24:59,660 --> 00:25:03,660
Where does he game? Where does he play his video games, ma'am?
