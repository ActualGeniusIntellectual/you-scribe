0	23000	Hey guys, Dev here.
23000	27180	Now I know we said other gamergate videos were coming out first, and they're all still
27180	28180	coming.
28180	32460	But Camera Lady wanted this one rushed out just because of how ridiculous this all is.
32460	33820	Let me tell you about my evening.
33820	39340	I came home, recorded a rather enjoyable session of Borderlands 2 Let's Plays with Lindsay,
39340	40340	Ian, and Dave.
40340	43340	Went outside, troubled the driveway.
43340	46860	As I was finishing up, Camera Lady was coming home.
46860	51340	She told me there was an absolutely riveting hour of TV that we had to check out.
51340	79340	So let's see what's on the old telly tonight, shall we?
79340	96660	One of the players Ravi played with got carried away and killed him.
96660	98780	Well, that's kind of far out.
98780	103740	Mazes and monsters is a far out game.
103740	122020	Well, that seems about right.
122020	124740	Was anybody seriously surprised at this?
124740	129300	Mainstream media has shown time and again whenever it tries to tackle not just gaming
129300	132820	but any kind of subculture, it fails miserably.
132820	137460	Everybody knew this was going to be a shitshow, especially coming from Law and Order, a show
137460	141540	that I've only seen my retiree father to ever actually watch.
141540	144860	But let's take a good look at just how ridiculous this gets.
144860	149440	Right off the bat, we've got the number one trope of any shitty episodic police drama.
149440	155140	Any time one of these shows decides to ham-fistedly do a story on a subculture, this tired technique
155140	156140	is trotted out.
156140	161140	We've got one guy, Ice-T this time, who's in the know about the subculture.
161140	164980	Well not really, but he's paid to poorly act like he's in the know.
164980	167920	Look at his fucking face, he's got no idea what he's saying.
167920	171740	So he rambles on about games, sprinkling in a bit of lingo here and there, which allows
171740	177820	middle-aged Samus Aran to ask, as she's not at all into games but at least wants to have
177820	179980	some knowledge of what's going on around her.
179980	183340	This dynamic on its own isn't necessarily bad.
183340	188300	Every story needs exposition to establish itself, and one of the easiest and overused
188300	192780	ways is to bring in a clueless character willing to ask the questions an equally clueless
192780	194500	audience is also asking.
194500	197940	However, what spells trouble is pro-Jared over here.
197940	207820	Check him out.
207820	212460	See he's in the dark as much as she is, but his role in this dynamic is to react negatively
212460	217700	to any exposition given, as if to say, no matter what you actually say, this subculture
217700	219380	is bad, we disapprove.
219380	224260	When your clueless character exposition scene includes one of these guys, it's an immediate
224260	229140	red flag that this story has an agenda it wants to push, accuracy be damned.
229140	243820	Oh shit, it's a 45 year old voice in a 20 year old body.
243820	247060	You know nobody's really talking about this line, but I think it's actually one of the
247060	250980	more telling ways on how out of touch this whole show is on its subject matter.
250980	254140	I get that the writers have an anti-gamer gate chip on their shoulder.
254140	258440	I get that they've swallowed the media narrative of sexism and harassment over the truth of
258440	259560	corruption and ethics.
259560	262860	I get that they're trying to tell a story that depicts women's struggles in predominantly
262860	266940	male spaces, trying and failing, but trying nonetheless.
266940	272060	But if you actually knew anything not only about the subculture you're attacking, but
272060	276340	the position you are taking to attack that subculture, why didn't you have your wardrobe
276340	278500	department put a fedora on this guy?
278500	281020	What's too insult here, just a ball cap?
281020	285100	As the scene stands, her line makes absolutely no sense.
285100	302220	Woah woah woah hold up, pause it right there.
302220	303500	Is that the Zelda font?
303500	304500	I think it is.
304660	308500	Okay, I know from the story structure of this episode, as well as the agenda the writers
308500	312460	are trying to push, that the female indie developer is likely meant to be either Brianna
312460	317580	Wu or Zoe Quinn, and you're actually comparing their work to the Legend of Zelda?
317580	320980	I don't want to ever downplay physical rape or sexual assault.
320980	325340	I can confidently speak for every single member of gamergate when I say that, if and when
325340	330060	this type of thing happens in real life, we don't support it and we want to see the perpetrators
330060	331180	brought to justice.
331180	335180	But the show sets it up like this is simply what video game culture is.
335180	338860	Real life, women getting raped in a bathroom as a normal and accepted occurrence.
338860	342140	Angry Joe recently had the best reply to something like this.
342140	346180	That's not fucking gaming culture, that's shitty people culture.
346180	347180	What happened?
347180	351340	These guys, they just can't stand women and gaming.
351340	355820	Now here's the first real obvious clue that the writers had an ideological axe to grind.
355820	360380	This line, they can't stand women and gaming, is lifted directly from the anti-gamergate
360460	361740	straw manual.
361740	366620	In real life, it's a blatantly and provably untrue claim, used when the unethical want
366620	368000	to hide their crimes.
368000	371820	But in the show, they just slap it on to the end of an attempted rape and call it a day.
371820	377180	In essence, the show, in concocting its fiction, is trying to give further credence in the
377180	381100	real world to the use of sexism as a scapegoat to hide unethical behavior.
381100	384940	What did they do to you?
384940	389180	They leveled up.
389180	390180	Oh come on.
390180	394500	Ignoring the fact that, unless you're fucking camera lady, it's really unlikely for you
394500	397120	to mouth off a quip after an attempted rape?
397120	399460	This sort of thing happens all over this episode.
399460	402220	If you die in the game, you die for real guys.
402220	407980	How many cliched, hackneyed pieces of garbage tackling gaming used puns involving game over,
407980	410020	next level, or reset button?
410020	412780	How do these people still have jobs writing such drivel?
412780	417220	Well in their world, developers like guys, and some guys aren't ready to give a girl
417220	418220	that power.
418260	421300	I'm not sure if developers are really considered gods by gamers.
421300	423060	Kamiya gets shit on constantly.
423060	426420	Kojima is considered a brilliant nutjob megalomaniac.
426420	430940	Gamers seem to look down on devs more often than not, especially the shitty devs who cut
430940	431940	corners.
431940	434140	The only one who's really considered a god is Miyamoto.
434140	438100	And when you look at this list of actual women in gaming instead of only listening to the
438100	443260	ones screaming loudly on Twitter 24-7, a lot of these women actually get treated just as
443260	444940	well as their male counterparts.
444940	450660	In fact, if there's any harassment, it's from sex-negative Western women directed towards
450660	453660	Asian women developers for daring to work on projects like Bayonetta.
454660	457660	Did she also tell you these creeps have a grudge against you and your game?
457660	459660	There's nothing in the game for them to be angry about.
459660	460660	You can choose how you play.
460660	465660	You can wage peace or war, have a patriarchy or a matriarchy, be eco-conscious or industrialized.
465660	466660	I know.
466660	471660	I read on Kotaku that it's better than Civ V with the Brave New World expansion pack.
471660	472660	I read on Kotaku.
472660	474660	Oh man, read on Kotaku?
474660	476660	Better than Civ V?
476660	481660	What's worse, the fact that Ice-T reads Kotaku vigilantly, that he's enough of a plebeian
481660	483660	that he doesn't recognize the mastery of Civ IV.
483660	486660	This is really just another one of those hit pieces done by people who know absolutely
486660	488660	nothing about games, isn't it?
488660	491660	With a couple of added anti-Gamergate narrative sprinkles on top.
491660	496660	This is Reina Punjabi, the indie dev in charge of Amazonian Warriors, a game that, according
496660	498660	to the story, everybody hates.
498660	503660	Now, if Amazonian Warriors were actually hated as much as the story lets on, and this were
503660	506660	the real world, here's what would happen.
506660	512660	If Punjabi were a member, or friends with members of Game Journal pros, Amazonian Warriors
512660	516660	would be getting disproportionate press on Kotaku, Polygon, etc.
516660	521660	Gamergate would protest a game due to its lack of quality and due to the apparent collusion
521660	523660	regarding journalists reporting on their friends' games.
523660	527660	Gamergate would be labeled sexist and racist for doing so by the mainstream media.
527660	532660	Amazonian Warriors may or may not get on Steam, but it ultimately probably wouldn't sell
532660	533660	very well.
533660	537660	Punjabi, and the clique that supports her, would likely blame the failure of her game
537660	538660	on misogyny.
538660	541660	Gamergate, meanwhile, would just play better games.
541660	543660	Like Civ V.
543660	548660	But, this is the insane world of right-wing masquerading as progressive conspiracy theories,
548660	552660	where every single tumblr box is ticked, every single mainstream media gamergate stereotype
552660	553660	is employed.
553660	557660	A 4chan knockoff called Redchan, complete with viral sub-threads?
557660	558660	Check.
558660	559660	Where was that posted?
559660	560660	The sub-thread on Redchan.
560660	561660	Swatting?
561660	562660	Check.
562660	567660	Even though the vast majority of swatting targets in real life are male gamers and streamers.
567660	572660	Hoodie, an off-brand anonymous mask wearing teens threatening SJWs?
572660	573660	Check.
573660	577660	She and her social justice warriors don't live gaming now?
577660	579660	We will meet them.
579660	581660	Accusing them of being cyber-terrorists?
581660	582660	Check.
582660	585660	This is, it's terrorism.
585660	586660	Wait, wrong clip.
586660	587660	Uh, check.
587660	588660	The cyber-terrorists win.
589660	594660	Hacking a lighting control panel at a stage event through the internet and screaming,
594660	598660	no social justice in gaming in a bane knockoff voice?
602660	604660	At this point in the story, things start to pick up.
604660	609660	It becomes less about individual instances of idiocy, and more about chase scene after
609660	614660	chase scene on the trails of three criminals who kidnap, gang rape, and plan to execute
614660	619660	Punjabi, while Ice-T injects every so often to explain another bit of gamer lingo or make
619660	620660	another dumb pun.
620660	624660	Their videos are framed a lot like, you guessed it, ISIS videos.
624660	628660	Remember, the writers are taking pages from the anti-gamer propaganda handbook, and bigots
628660	633660	have been unfoundedly comparing gamers and gamergate to ISIS for nearly six months now.
633660	637660	Nobody's surprised that eventually somebody would stoop so low as to film a farce like
637660	638660	this.
638660	640660	The only question was how long until it happened.
640660	645660	Also, the group uses a skull and grenade logo in the background of every single video they take.
645660	647660	Hey, wait.
647660	649660	That's Rogue Star's symbol.
649660	653660	They're even alluding to Rogue, calling the main guy the thematically similar name of
653660	654660	Acid Rain.
654660	657660	Holy shit, these people are insane.
657660	662660	Also, I don't know if anybody noticed this, but the no-name brand Rogue Star symbol shows
662660	666660	up all over the episode, and not just in the backgrounds of the assault videos.
666660	669660	Why is it on the corner of the game footage the cop is playing?
669660	671660	Why is it on the corner of everybody's game?
671660	673660	Did I miss something?
673660	676660	Hey, Rogue Star, how about you tweet Ice-T and see if you can clear this all up for us?
676660	678660	Ohhhhh.
678660	683660	The show ends with a predictable firefight, employing more gamer quips, revealing the
683660	688660	tired plot twist that the gamers can no longer see the difference between the game and reality,
688660	690660	and this very memorable line.
690660	692660	Women and gaming.
692660	694660	What did I expect?
694660	698660	I know anti-gamergate probably won't believe me, but I don't want to see this happen
698660	699660	in real life.
699660	703660	I don't want to see a woman developer beaten and raped out of the industry.
703660	709660	If a person of any gender makes a bad game, and it sees an undeserved push via press or
709660	713660	awards due to corruption within the industry, I want to see the journalist lose their jobs,
713660	717660	I want to see the award shows shut down for fraud, and I want to see the developer's
717660	718660	game not sell.
718660	720660	But nobody wants to see rape and assault.
720660	725660	Reyna, you're asking the audience, women and gaming, what did we expect?
725660	727660	Well, I'll answer that question.
727660	732660	But I'll send my answer towards the real life women and men in gaming, the people who
732660	738660	are not victims of rape by gamers, but rather are the sources of corruption within our industry.
738660	739660	What did we expect?
739660	742660	We expected ethical conduct.
742660	747660	On top of being anti-gamer propaganda, this episode is meant to be a thinly veiled gamergate
747660	748660	show.
748660	751660	It fails due to its lack of focus on the topic of gamergate.
751660	752660	Ethics.
752660	757660	This show is what anti-gamers desperately wish gamergate was in real life, so that their
757660	759660	baseless vilification could become true.
759660	762660	In essence, this is anti-gamergate pornography.
762660	766660	I'd like to take a minute and discuss a few extra things at the end here.
766660	769660	This episode is not groundbreaking, nor is it unique.
769660	774660	We've seen this type of moral panic raised by conservatives for years, from the invention
774660	778660	of the automobile allowing youth to leave town during a Sunday, to rock and roll with
779660	784660	Elvis throwing up the horns, to Dungeons and Dragons turning children into satanic ritualists
784660	787660	sacrificing goats and whatever, and now with video games.
787660	792660	The specter of the anti-gamer began to rise in the mid 90s, and we thought we'd finally
792660	795660	struck it down with the disbarment of Jack Thompson.
795660	800660	With the rise of gamergate, its opposition has brought the hysteria back in full force.
800660	803660	But why is this type of stuff just so effective in our larger society?
803660	807660	In our traditional culture, and really in most traditional cultures, males are allowed
807660	809660	to occupy one of three social spaces.
809660	812660	Boiled down, they are baby, adult, and outsider.
812660	814660	The baby is a male child.
814660	819660	He has no agency of his own, and is cared for and controlled by both women and men in different ways.
819660	825660	He is also generally not thought to be responsible for his actions, except in extraordinary circumstances.
825660	829660	The adult is the mature male, not just physically, but socially.
829660	832660	He is required to be a leader when called to the task.
832660	835660	He is required to be a warrior when there is fighting to be done.
835660	840660	He is required to hunt or otherwise provide not only for himself, but for other people.
840660	844660	He is required to work to earn his masculinity.
844660	847660	The outsider is the natural default of the male.
847660	851660	All males, if they're not babies or adults, are considered outsiders.
851660	856660	Outsiders can be enemies, or they can be people unwilling to contribute to society.
856660	861660	This is obviously a very tribal definition of masculinity, and while it may have been useful in ages past,
861660	863660	it still exists as a holdover today.
863660	867660	Little boys are still coddled, but that practice has begun to erode in recent years.
867660	873660	Adult men are still required to be breadwinners and providers, soldiers and leaders, even if they aren't inclined to be.
873660	877660	And outsiders? They're the deadbeats for not wanting to be fathers.
877660	881660	The man-children, for enjoying pastimes conservative society has deemed childish.
881660	889660	Lazy for not working out, roid ragers for working out, sissies for being sensitive, assholes for not being sensitive, and so on.
889660	896660	Male privilege, as Second Wave Feminism describes it, exists, but only adult men have access to it.
896660	898660	Babies do not, outsiders do not.
898660	905660	Just as women are forced into the roles of either Madonna or whore, men are forced into the roles of either adult or outsider.
905660	913660	And just as individual women are human, with far more complexities than either role allows them, individual men are just as human.
913660	915660	So, let's bring us back to gaming.
915660	922660	The show immediately begins by framing the main story around the chief's adopted son, who's been giving her some trouble.
922660	928660	He's rough and tumble, his form of play is very active in comparison to the two adorable girls who just sit quietly.
928660	929660	The given reply is,
929660	934660	Boys run around and break things, they hurt themselves, it's in all their DNA.
934660	940660	The implication here is clear, you have a baby, one day he will grow into an outsider if left on his own.
940660	942660	You must teach him to be an adult instead.
942660	950660	This is simply the conservative idea of women existing to be a civilizing force in men's lives, repackaged to fit the young male narrative this show is about to present.
950660	957660	This is all too clear later in the show, when she stares at a photo and wonders if her boy is going to grow into one of those nasty, vile gamers.
957660	962660	Most of the men in the show are portrayed to be undesirables, entirely absorbed in their gaming hobby.
962660	969660	They're outsiders, they're certainly too old to be babies, and they've yet to willingly take on all the duties men their age are expected to take on by society.
969660	973660	This is obvious in how they act, how they talk, how they look.
973660	980660	The show presents them as if they hate not only women but themselves, solely because they enjoy an activity that their society considers childish.
980660	985660	They know of their outsider status, they hate being a member of that class, but they cannot change.
985660	988660	That is pointed out rather quickly in this scene.
994660	996660	I don't really need to say anymore, do I?
996660	1003660	She even later berates one of her co-workers for playing video games, where he has to reassure her that no, he's actually an adult, not an outsider.
1003660	1006660	I fought off those tendencies long ago, ma'am.
1006660	1008660	Of course in real life, humans are more complicated than this.
1008660	1012660	One can obviously be a mature, responsible adult and be a gamer.
1012660	1021660	But forcing the mutually exclusive triad of male identities of baby adult outsider into the portrayal of every single male character in the show
1021660	1027660	is exactly what is thematically required to make the episode operate as an anti-gamer propaganda piece.
1027660	1031660	It's certainly not good storytelling, but it is functional propaganda.
1031660	1039660	And that propaganda is reliant on this very conservative and ultimately grossly inaccurate understanding of men
1039660	1045660	and portrayal of both gamers and the gamer-gate they so very much want to mention but never actually do.
1045660	1048660	Moreover, for a show that wants to push a progressivist agenda,
1048660	1056660	well, not a real progressivist agenda, because if that were the case, they'd portray gamers as a diverse group that is actually not at all abusive, but you get what I'm saying.
1056660	1062660	Did you actually have to go with naming your Indian character Punjabi? Jesus.
1062660	1068660	I have to wonder, was the actress herself a bit offended by that, but just swallowed her pride and took the paycheck?
1068660	1074660	I don't know how it is anywhere else in the world, but where I'm from, Punjabi is generally considered a racial slur.
1074660	1083660	And while thematically she's meant to be Brianna Wu or Zoe Quinn, she wears Anita Sarkeesian's earrings, purposefully I'm sure, and looks more like Jenny Barrage than anybody else.
1083660	1090660	Do keep in mind that last I heard, Jenny Barrage has received harassment for being a girl gamer as well as for trying to build basegamer.com,
1090660	1098660	but her harassment hasn't come from angry male gamers, her harassment has come from the angry supporters of the journalists and developers that oppose gamer-gate.
1098660	1102660	Law and order literally got nothing right in their story.
1102660	1107660	Speaking of those angry supporters of corruption in anti-gamer-gate, let's see what they have to say about this whole thing.
1107660	1111660	Here's Zoe Quinn hiding in a bathroom being crushed by the weight of it all.
1111660	1117660	I don't know if Law and Order should trigger you this much Zoe, if it does you should probably just turn the TV off and do something else.
1117660	1130660	Here's Rob Cipher describing exactly what Law and Order actually just did, and he says this quality film about social activism will annihilate the gamer-gate mind hive once and for all.
1130660	1135660	Yeah, I have a feeling it's not going to do that.
1135660	1142660	Here's Warren Light, someone who actually works on the show, saying that women are thanking him for taking on misogyny in gaming.
1142660	1145660	Well you didn't do that, you made up a boogeyman.
1145660	1152660	Here's Brianna Wu, the part of the Law and Order episode that seems implausible is how there's an online threat to women and the police do something.
1152660	1156660	Yeah, the thing about threats is that they have to be proven, Brianna.
1156660	1169660	And so far, any threats towards you that I've seen has come from one Twitter account which got banned, and all of us are in complete support if Twitter decided to backtrace that account, get the IP, and have the person arrested.
1169660	1174660	And of course she says, I'm concerned about this Darknet Ice-T was warning us about.
1174660	1181660	Okay, Jonathan McIntosh often says that gamers cannot tell the difference between fantasy and real life.
1181660	1192660	The basis of the movies Mazes and Monsters and Skullduggery and a lot of other D&D propaganda was that people who play D&D cannot tell the difference between the game and real life.
1192660	1200660	This is something that we hear a lot, and yet here's Brianna actually thinking that Ice-T's comments about the Darknet warrants real world investigation.
1200660	1205660	She also thinks she's Batman. Here's Ben Kucera, and this actually plays to a larger point.
1205660	1212660	He says it's kind of hard to be snarky about bad TV shows dramatizing this when vulnerable people are still actively targeted in the long term.
1212660	1217660	Anti-Gamergate is turning on this show. They weren't promoting it before. They're turning on it now.
1217660	1225660	I think it's because they're finally starting to realize that when they take their own narrative and play it out, it looks ridiculous. But more on that later.
1226660	1227660	Here's good ol' Alex Lifeshits.
1234660	1239660	I'm sure it isn't. Do keep in mind, though, that in the show, the threats were reported. People were traced.
1239660	1245660	If you've received threats, if Zoe's received threats, report them. Don't brag on the internet that you've reported them.
1245660	1252660	Don't make it a big thing because the police will inevitably say, hey, don't do that. Report them, do what they say, and get them caught.
1252660	1257660	I know Zoe has said, August never ends. August never ends because you don't want it to end.
1257660	1265660	Here's Maya Kramer and Cara Ellison, both of them saying basically that the ending was a downer. Law and they've already won order.
1265660	1270660	Law and quit your job, women. Who cares what you do? It's true. The ending was a downer.
1270660	1272660	I don't want to see that happen to women. Absolutely not.
1272660	1281660	I do want to see corrupt people, men or women, lose their jobs. I do want to see them be punished legally, if applicable.
1281660	1284660	Nobody wants to see them raped. Nobody talks about that.
1284660	1292660	And here's social justice Kirby complaining that the internet is making memes again. Someone please plant the no fun allowed sign.
1292660	1295660	Here's everybody's favorite dog rapist, Sarah Butts.
1295660	1303660	The narrative of gamergate SVU was essentially that despite the best efforts of law enforcement, certain tragedies are unavoidable.
1303660	1311660	No, that wasn't the narrative. The narrative was that all gamers are terrible human beings and that is not true.
1311660	1318660	And they decided to stage a rape scene on a show in order to push that narrative.
1318660	1325660	To slander an entire group of people, a very diverse group of people, all for their own ideological ends. It's disgusting.
1325660	1332660	And here's Zoe saying that the story was basically all about her and that she should have been contacted by law and order to get her permission to actually do the episode.
1332660	1336660	I think that's why they went with somebody who wasn't you, Zoe.
1336660	1343660	Zoe, the world doesn't revolve around you. Gamergate doesn't even revolve around you. You're the Franz Ferdinand of gamergate.
1343660	1352660	And I must point out, I know that this person wasn't based on you because as shitty as Amazonian Warriors is, it still seems to be a lot better than Depression Quest.
1352660	1355660	I'll end it off with Jason Schreier because this kind of speaks to my larger point.
1355660	1364660	He says law and order is a terrible television show. He makes fun of Ice-T. He says that Civilization 5 is obviously much better than Amazonian Warrior.
1364660	1372660	And he wrote an article on Kotaku about it. Now his Kotaku article entitled, So that was law and order's gamergate episode, is very very negative.
1373660	1385660	And I think this is very interesting because the narrative that these journalists and these developers have pushed this whole time, pushed for six months, is that women are being harassed.
1385660	1398660	There is no ethical violation anywhere. This is about harassment of women. This is about women being chased from their homes. This is about women being hit with rape threats, women being hit with death threats.
1398660	1405660	That's their narrative. That's what they're saying. That's what they're saying everywhere they can, anywhere they can.
1405660	1417660	But suddenly, when a show like, say, Law and Order comes along, takes that narrative and actually puts it into practice, actually crafts a story from that narrative, they release it publicly and people watch it.
1417660	1423660	Suddenly it's a bad episode. That episode is based on your narrative. That is what you're pushing.
1423660	1433660	It's an untrue narrative, yes, but it's the narrative that you push. And now various writers are latching onto that narrative, making stories out of it, and throwing it back at you.
1433660	1436660	And now you're seeing why you're so incorrect?
1436660	1444660	A lot of gamergate's opponents thought that this Law and Order thing was going to be like a nail in the coffin for gamergate, and it's just backfiring in their faces.
1444660	1452660	Because people are beginning to see just how ridiculous, how wildly out there the claims of anti-gamergate are.
1452660	1458660	The narrative of misogyny and death threats and harassment culminated in this episode.
1458660	1469660	And now that people are seeing what actually happens when this shit goes down, and comparing it to what's actually happening in gamergate in real life, they're realizing, oh hey, that's not gamergate.
1469660	1484660	Now I would go over what pro-gamergate thought of the episode. However if you go on twitter and check out the hashtag, it is 100% shitposting and new memes. Thanks guys.
1499660	1503660	Where does he game? Where does he play his video games, ma'am?
