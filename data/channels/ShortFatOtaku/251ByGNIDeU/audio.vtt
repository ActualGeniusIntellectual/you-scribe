WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:23.000
Hey guys, Dev here.

00:23.000 --> 00:27.180
Now I know we said other gamergate videos were coming out first, and they're all still

00:27.180 --> 00:28.180
coming.

00:28.180 --> 00:32.460
But Camera Lady wanted this one rushed out just because of how ridiculous this all is.

00:32.460 --> 00:33.820
Let me tell you about my evening.

00:33.820 --> 00:39.340
I came home, recorded a rather enjoyable session of Borderlands 2 Let's Plays with Lindsay,

00:39.340 --> 00:40.340
Ian, and Dave.

00:40.340 --> 00:43.340
Went outside, troubled the driveway.

00:43.340 --> 00:46.860
As I was finishing up, Camera Lady was coming home.

00:46.860 --> 00:51.340
She told me there was an absolutely riveting hour of TV that we had to check out.

00:51.340 --> 01:19.340
So let's see what's on the old telly tonight, shall we?

01:19.340 --> 01:36.660
One of the players Ravi played with got carried away and killed him.

01:36.660 --> 01:38.780
Well, that's kind of far out.

01:38.780 --> 01:43.740
Mazes and monsters is a far out game.

01:43.740 --> 02:02.020
Well, that seems about right.

02:02.020 --> 02:04.740
Was anybody seriously surprised at this?

02:04.740 --> 02:09.300
Mainstream media has shown time and again whenever it tries to tackle not just gaming

02:09.300 --> 02:12.820
but any kind of subculture, it fails miserably.

02:12.820 --> 02:17.460
Everybody knew this was going to be a shitshow, especially coming from Law and Order, a show

02:17.460 --> 02:21.540
that I've only seen my retiree father to ever actually watch.

02:21.540 --> 02:24.860
But let's take a good look at just how ridiculous this gets.

02:24.860 --> 02:29.440
Right off the bat, we've got the number one trope of any shitty episodic police drama.

02:29.440 --> 02:35.140
Any time one of these shows decides to ham-fistedly do a story on a subculture, this tired technique

02:35.140 --> 02:36.140
is trotted out.

02:36.140 --> 02:41.140
We've got one guy, Ice-T this time, who's in the know about the subculture.

02:41.140 --> 02:44.980
Well not really, but he's paid to poorly act like he's in the know.

02:44.980 --> 02:47.920
Look at his fucking face, he's got no idea what he's saying.

02:47.920 --> 02:51.740
So he rambles on about games, sprinkling in a bit of lingo here and there, which allows

02:51.740 --> 02:57.820
middle-aged Samus Aran to ask, as she's not at all into games but at least wants to have

02:57.820 --> 02:59.980
some knowledge of what's going on around her.

02:59.980 --> 03:03.340
This dynamic on its own isn't necessarily bad.

03:03.340 --> 03:08.300
Every story needs exposition to establish itself, and one of the easiest and overused

03:08.300 --> 03:12.780
ways is to bring in a clueless character willing to ask the questions an equally clueless

03:12.780 --> 03:14.500
audience is also asking.

03:14.500 --> 03:17.940
However, what spells trouble is pro-Jared over here.

03:17.940 --> 03:27.820
Check him out.

03:27.820 --> 03:32.460
See he's in the dark as much as she is, but his role in this dynamic is to react negatively

03:32.460 --> 03:37.700
to any exposition given, as if to say, no matter what you actually say, this subculture

03:37.700 --> 03:39.380
is bad, we disapprove.

03:39.380 --> 03:44.260
When your clueless character exposition scene includes one of these guys, it's an immediate

03:44.260 --> 03:49.140
red flag that this story has an agenda it wants to push, accuracy be damned.

03:49.140 --> 04:03.820
Oh shit, it's a 45 year old voice in a 20 year old body.

04:03.820 --> 04:07.060
You know nobody's really talking about this line, but I think it's actually one of the

04:07.060 --> 04:10.980
more telling ways on how out of touch this whole show is on its subject matter.

04:10.980 --> 04:14.140
I get that the writers have an anti-gamer gate chip on their shoulder.

04:14.140 --> 04:18.440
I get that they've swallowed the media narrative of sexism and harassment over the truth of

04:18.440 --> 04:19.560
corruption and ethics.

04:19.560 --> 04:22.860
I get that they're trying to tell a story that depicts women's struggles in predominantly

04:22.860 --> 04:26.940
male spaces, trying and failing, but trying nonetheless.

04:26.940 --> 04:32.060
But if you actually knew anything not only about the subculture you're attacking, but

04:32.060 --> 04:36.340
the position you are taking to attack that subculture, why didn't you have your wardrobe

04:36.340 --> 04:38.500
department put a fedora on this guy?

04:38.500 --> 04:41.020
What's too insult here, just a ball cap?

04:41.020 --> 04:45.100
As the scene stands, her line makes absolutely no sense.

04:45.100 --> 05:02.220
Woah woah woah hold up, pause it right there.

05:02.220 --> 05:03.500
Is that the Zelda font?

05:03.500 --> 05:04.500
I think it is.

05:04.660 --> 05:08.500
Okay, I know from the story structure of this episode, as well as the agenda the writers

05:08.500 --> 05:12.460
are trying to push, that the female indie developer is likely meant to be either Brianna

05:12.460 --> 05:17.580
Wu or Zoe Quinn, and you're actually comparing their work to the Legend of Zelda?

05:17.580 --> 05:20.980
I don't want to ever downplay physical rape or sexual assault.

05:20.980 --> 05:25.340
I can confidently speak for every single member of gamergate when I say that, if and when

05:25.340 --> 05:30.060
this type of thing happens in real life, we don't support it and we want to see the perpetrators

05:30.060 --> 05:31.180
brought to justice.

05:31.180 --> 05:35.180
But the show sets it up like this is simply what video game culture is.

05:35.180 --> 05:38.860
Real life, women getting raped in a bathroom as a normal and accepted occurrence.

05:38.860 --> 05:42.140
Angry Joe recently had the best reply to something like this.

05:42.140 --> 05:46.180
That's not fucking gaming culture, that's shitty people culture.

05:46.180 --> 05:47.180
What happened?

05:47.180 --> 05:51.340
These guys, they just can't stand women and gaming.

05:51.340 --> 05:55.820
Now here's the first real obvious clue that the writers had an ideological axe to grind.

05:55.820 --> 06:00.380
This line, they can't stand women and gaming, is lifted directly from the anti-gamergate

06:00.460 --> 06:01.740
straw manual.

06:01.740 --> 06:06.620
In real life, it's a blatantly and provably untrue claim, used when the unethical want

06:06.620 --> 06:08.000
to hide their crimes.

06:08.000 --> 06:11.820
But in the show, they just slap it on to the end of an attempted rape and call it a day.

06:11.820 --> 06:17.180
In essence, the show, in concocting its fiction, is trying to give further credence in the

06:17.180 --> 06:21.100
real world to the use of sexism as a scapegoat to hide unethical behavior.

06:21.100 --> 06:24.940
What did they do to you?

06:24.940 --> 06:29.180
They leveled up.

06:29.180 --> 06:30.180
Oh come on.

06:30.180 --> 06:34.500
Ignoring the fact that, unless you're fucking camera lady, it's really unlikely for you

06:34.500 --> 06:37.120
to mouth off a quip after an attempted rape?

06:37.120 --> 06:39.460
This sort of thing happens all over this episode.

06:39.460 --> 06:42.220
If you die in the game, you die for real guys.

06:42.220 --> 06:47.980
How many cliched, hackneyed pieces of garbage tackling gaming used puns involving game over,

06:47.980 --> 06:50.020
next level, or reset button?

06:50.020 --> 06:52.780
How do these people still have jobs writing such drivel?

06:52.780 --> 06:57.220
Well in their world, developers like guys, and some guys aren't ready to give a girl

06:57.220 --> 06:58.220
that power.

06:58.260 --> 07:01.300
I'm not sure if developers are really considered gods by gamers.

07:01.300 --> 07:03.060
Kamiya gets shit on constantly.

07:03.060 --> 07:06.420
Kojima is considered a brilliant nutjob megalomaniac.

07:06.420 --> 07:10.940
Gamers seem to look down on devs more often than not, especially the shitty devs who cut

07:10.940 --> 07:11.940
corners.

07:11.940 --> 07:14.140
The only one who's really considered a god is Miyamoto.

07:14.140 --> 07:18.100
And when you look at this list of actual women in gaming instead of only listening to the

07:18.100 --> 07:23.260
ones screaming loudly on Twitter 24-7, a lot of these women actually get treated just as

07:23.260 --> 07:24.940
well as their male counterparts.

07:24.940 --> 07:30.660
In fact, if there's any harassment, it's from sex-negative Western women directed towards

07:30.660 --> 07:33.660
Asian women developers for daring to work on projects like Bayonetta.

07:34.660 --> 07:37.660
Did she also tell you these creeps have a grudge against you and your game?

07:37.660 --> 07:39.660
There's nothing in the game for them to be angry about.

07:39.660 --> 07:40.660
You can choose how you play.

07:40.660 --> 07:45.660
You can wage peace or war, have a patriarchy or a matriarchy, be eco-conscious or industrialized.

07:45.660 --> 07:46.660
I know.

07:46.660 --> 07:51.660
I read on Kotaku that it's better than Civ V with the Brave New World expansion pack.

07:51.660 --> 07:52.660
I read on Kotaku.

07:52.660 --> 07:54.660
Oh man, read on Kotaku?

07:54.660 --> 07:56.660
Better than Civ V?

07:56.660 --> 08:01.660
What's worse, the fact that Ice-T reads Kotaku vigilantly, that he's enough of a plebeian

08:01.660 --> 08:03.660
that he doesn't recognize the mastery of Civ IV.

08:03.660 --> 08:06.660
This is really just another one of those hit pieces done by people who know absolutely

08:06.660 --> 08:08.660
nothing about games, isn't it?

08:08.660 --> 08:11.660
With a couple of added anti-Gamergate narrative sprinkles on top.

08:11.660 --> 08:16.660
This is Reina Punjabi, the indie dev in charge of Amazonian Warriors, a game that, according

08:16.660 --> 08:18.660
to the story, everybody hates.

08:18.660 --> 08:23.660
Now, if Amazonian Warriors were actually hated as much as the story lets on, and this were

08:23.660 --> 08:26.660
the real world, here's what would happen.

08:26.660 --> 08:32.660
If Punjabi were a member, or friends with members of Game Journal pros, Amazonian Warriors

08:32.660 --> 08:36.660
would be getting disproportionate press on Kotaku, Polygon, etc.

08:36.660 --> 08:41.660
Gamergate would protest a game due to its lack of quality and due to the apparent collusion

08:41.660 --> 08:43.660
regarding journalists reporting on their friends' games.

08:43.660 --> 08:47.660
Gamergate would be labeled sexist and racist for doing so by the mainstream media.

08:47.660 --> 08:52.660
Amazonian Warriors may or may not get on Steam, but it ultimately probably wouldn't sell

08:52.660 --> 08:53.660
very well.

08:53.660 --> 08:57.660
Punjabi, and the clique that supports her, would likely blame the failure of her game

08:57.660 --> 08:58.660
on misogyny.

08:58.660 --> 09:01.660
Gamergate, meanwhile, would just play better games.

09:01.660 --> 09:03.660
Like Civ V.

09:03.660 --> 09:08.660
But, this is the insane world of right-wing masquerading as progressive conspiracy theories,

09:08.660 --> 09:12.660
where every single tumblr box is ticked, every single mainstream media gamergate stereotype

09:12.660 --> 09:13.660
is employed.

09:13.660 --> 09:17.660
A 4chan knockoff called Redchan, complete with viral sub-threads?

09:17.660 --> 09:18.660
Check.

09:18.660 --> 09:19.660
Where was that posted?

09:19.660 --> 09:20.660
The sub-thread on Redchan.

09:20.660 --> 09:21.660
Swatting?

09:21.660 --> 09:22.660
Check.

09:22.660 --> 09:27.660
Even though the vast majority of swatting targets in real life are male gamers and streamers.

09:27.660 --> 09:32.660
Hoodie, an off-brand anonymous mask wearing teens threatening SJWs?

09:32.660 --> 09:33.660
Check.

09:33.660 --> 09:37.660
She and her social justice warriors don't live gaming now?

09:37.660 --> 09:39.660
We will meet them.

09:39.660 --> 09:41.660
Accusing them of being cyber-terrorists?

09:41.660 --> 09:42.660
Check.

09:42.660 --> 09:45.660
This is, it's terrorism.

09:45.660 --> 09:46.660
Wait, wrong clip.

09:46.660 --> 09:47.660
Uh, check.

09:47.660 --> 09:48.660
The cyber-terrorists win.

09:49.660 --> 09:54.660
Hacking a lighting control panel at a stage event through the internet and screaming,

09:54.660 --> 09:58.660
no social justice in gaming in a bane knockoff voice?

10:02.660 --> 10:04.660
At this point in the story, things start to pick up.

10:04.660 --> 10:09.660
It becomes less about individual instances of idiocy, and more about chase scene after

10:09.660 --> 10:14.660
chase scene on the trails of three criminals who kidnap, gang rape, and plan to execute

10:14.660 --> 10:19.660
Punjabi, while Ice-T injects every so often to explain another bit of gamer lingo or make

10:19.660 --> 10:20.660
another dumb pun.

10:20.660 --> 10:24.660
Their videos are framed a lot like, you guessed it, ISIS videos.

10:24.660 --> 10:28.660
Remember, the writers are taking pages from the anti-gamer propaganda handbook, and bigots

10:28.660 --> 10:33.660
have been unfoundedly comparing gamers and gamergate to ISIS for nearly six months now.

10:33.660 --> 10:37.660
Nobody's surprised that eventually somebody would stoop so low as to film a farce like

10:37.660 --> 10:38.660
this.

10:38.660 --> 10:40.660
The only question was how long until it happened.

10:40.660 --> 10:45.660
Also, the group uses a skull and grenade logo in the background of every single video they take.

10:45.660 --> 10:47.660
Hey, wait.

10:47.660 --> 10:49.660
That's Rogue Star's symbol.

10:49.660 --> 10:53.660
They're even alluding to Rogue, calling the main guy the thematically similar name of

10:53.660 --> 10:54.660
Acid Rain.

10:54.660 --> 10:57.660
Holy shit, these people are insane.

10:57.660 --> 11:02.660
Also, I don't know if anybody noticed this, but the no-name brand Rogue Star symbol shows

11:02.660 --> 11:06.660
up all over the episode, and not just in the backgrounds of the assault videos.

11:06.660 --> 11:09.660
Why is it on the corner of the game footage the cop is playing?

11:09.660 --> 11:11.660
Why is it on the corner of everybody's game?

11:11.660 --> 11:13.660
Did I miss something?

11:13.660 --> 11:16.660
Hey, Rogue Star, how about you tweet Ice-T and see if you can clear this all up for us?

11:16.660 --> 11:18.660
Ohhhhh.

11:18.660 --> 11:23.660
The show ends with a predictable firefight, employing more gamer quips, revealing the

11:23.660 --> 11:28.660
tired plot twist that the gamers can no longer see the difference between the game and reality,

11:28.660 --> 11:30.660
and this very memorable line.

11:30.660 --> 11:32.660
Women and gaming.

11:32.660 --> 11:34.660
What did I expect?

11:34.660 --> 11:38.660
I know anti-gamergate probably won't believe me, but I don't want to see this happen

11:38.660 --> 11:39.660
in real life.

11:39.660 --> 11:43.660
I don't want to see a woman developer beaten and raped out of the industry.

11:43.660 --> 11:49.660
If a person of any gender makes a bad game, and it sees an undeserved push via press or

11:49.660 --> 11:53.660
awards due to corruption within the industry, I want to see the journalist lose their jobs,

11:53.660 --> 11:57.660
I want to see the award shows shut down for fraud, and I want to see the developer's

11:57.660 --> 11:58.660
game not sell.

11:58.660 --> 12:00.660
But nobody wants to see rape and assault.

12:00.660 --> 12:05.660
Reyna, you're asking the audience, women and gaming, what did we expect?

12:05.660 --> 12:07.660
Well, I'll answer that question.

12:07.660 --> 12:12.660
But I'll send my answer towards the real life women and men in gaming, the people who

12:12.660 --> 12:18.660
are not victims of rape by gamers, but rather are the sources of corruption within our industry.

12:18.660 --> 12:19.660
What did we expect?

12:19.660 --> 12:22.660
We expected ethical conduct.

12:22.660 --> 12:27.660
On top of being anti-gamer propaganda, this episode is meant to be a thinly veiled gamergate

12:27.660 --> 12:28.660
show.

12:28.660 --> 12:31.660
It fails due to its lack of focus on the topic of gamergate.

12:31.660 --> 12:32.660
Ethics.

12:32.660 --> 12:37.660
This show is what anti-gamers desperately wish gamergate was in real life, so that their

12:37.660 --> 12:39.660
baseless vilification could become true.

12:39.660 --> 12:42.660
In essence, this is anti-gamergate pornography.

12:42.660 --> 12:46.660
I'd like to take a minute and discuss a few extra things at the end here.

12:46.660 --> 12:49.660
This episode is not groundbreaking, nor is it unique.

12:49.660 --> 12:54.660
We've seen this type of moral panic raised by conservatives for years, from the invention

12:54.660 --> 12:58.660
of the automobile allowing youth to leave town during a Sunday, to rock and roll with

12:59.660 --> 13:04.660
Elvis throwing up the horns, to Dungeons and Dragons turning children into satanic ritualists

13:04.660 --> 13:07.660
sacrificing goats and whatever, and now with video games.

13:07.660 --> 13:12.660
The specter of the anti-gamer began to rise in the mid 90s, and we thought we'd finally

13:12.660 --> 13:15.660
struck it down with the disbarment of Jack Thompson.

13:15.660 --> 13:20.660
With the rise of gamergate, its opposition has brought the hysteria back in full force.

13:20.660 --> 13:23.660
But why is this type of stuff just so effective in our larger society?

13:23.660 --> 13:27.660
In our traditional culture, and really in most traditional cultures, males are allowed

13:27.660 --> 13:29.660
to occupy one of three social spaces.

13:29.660 --> 13:32.660
Boiled down, they are baby, adult, and outsider.

13:32.660 --> 13:34.660
The baby is a male child.

13:34.660 --> 13:39.660
He has no agency of his own, and is cared for and controlled by both women and men in different ways.

13:39.660 --> 13:45.660
He is also generally not thought to be responsible for his actions, except in extraordinary circumstances.

13:45.660 --> 13:49.660
The adult is the mature male, not just physically, but socially.

13:49.660 --> 13:52.660
He is required to be a leader when called to the task.

13:52.660 --> 13:55.660
He is required to be a warrior when there is fighting to be done.

13:55.660 --> 14:00.660
He is required to hunt or otherwise provide not only for himself, but for other people.

14:00.660 --> 14:04.660
He is required to work to earn his masculinity.

14:04.660 --> 14:07.660
The outsider is the natural default of the male.

14:07.660 --> 14:11.660
All males, if they're not babies or adults, are considered outsiders.

14:11.660 --> 14:16.660
Outsiders can be enemies, or they can be people unwilling to contribute to society.

14:16.660 --> 14:21.660
This is obviously a very tribal definition of masculinity, and while it may have been useful in ages past,

14:21.660 --> 14:23.660
it still exists as a holdover today.

14:23.660 --> 14:27.660
Little boys are still coddled, but that practice has begun to erode in recent years.

14:27.660 --> 14:33.660
Adult men are still required to be breadwinners and providers, soldiers and leaders, even if they aren't inclined to be.

14:33.660 --> 14:37.660
And outsiders? They're the deadbeats for not wanting to be fathers.

14:37.660 --> 14:41.660
The man-children, for enjoying pastimes conservative society has deemed childish.

14:41.660 --> 14:49.660
Lazy for not working out, roid ragers for working out, sissies for being sensitive, assholes for not being sensitive, and so on.

14:49.660 --> 14:56.660
Male privilege, as Second Wave Feminism describes it, exists, but only adult men have access to it.

14:56.660 --> 14:58.660
Babies do not, outsiders do not.

14:58.660 --> 15:05.660
Just as women are forced into the roles of either Madonna or whore, men are forced into the roles of either adult or outsider.

15:05.660 --> 15:13.660
And just as individual women are human, with far more complexities than either role allows them, individual men are just as human.

15:13.660 --> 15:15.660
So, let's bring us back to gaming.

15:15.660 --> 15:22.660
The show immediately begins by framing the main story around the chief's adopted son, who's been giving her some trouble.

15:22.660 --> 15:28.660
He's rough and tumble, his form of play is very active in comparison to the two adorable girls who just sit quietly.

15:28.660 --> 15:29.660
The given reply is,

15:29.660 --> 15:34.660
Boys run around and break things, they hurt themselves, it's in all their DNA.

15:34.660 --> 15:40.660
The implication here is clear, you have a baby, one day he will grow into an outsider if left on his own.

15:40.660 --> 15:42.660
You must teach him to be an adult instead.

15:42.660 --> 15:50.660
This is simply the conservative idea of women existing to be a civilizing force in men's lives, repackaged to fit the young male narrative this show is about to present.

15:50.660 --> 15:57.660
This is all too clear later in the show, when she stares at a photo and wonders if her boy is going to grow into one of those nasty, vile gamers.

15:57.660 --> 16:02.660
Most of the men in the show are portrayed to be undesirables, entirely absorbed in their gaming hobby.

16:02.660 --> 16:09.660
They're outsiders, they're certainly too old to be babies, and they've yet to willingly take on all the duties men their age are expected to take on by society.

16:09.660 --> 16:13.660
This is obvious in how they act, how they talk, how they look.

16:13.660 --> 16:20.660
The show presents them as if they hate not only women but themselves, solely because they enjoy an activity that their society considers childish.

16:20.660 --> 16:25.660
They know of their outsider status, they hate being a member of that class, but they cannot change.

16:25.660 --> 16:28.660
That is pointed out rather quickly in this scene.

16:34.660 --> 16:36.660
I don't really need to say anymore, do I?

16:36.660 --> 16:43.660
She even later berates one of her co-workers for playing video games, where he has to reassure her that no, he's actually an adult, not an outsider.

16:43.660 --> 16:46.660
I fought off those tendencies long ago, ma'am.

16:46.660 --> 16:48.660
Of course in real life, humans are more complicated than this.

16:48.660 --> 16:52.660
One can obviously be a mature, responsible adult and be a gamer.

16:52.660 --> 17:01.660
But forcing the mutually exclusive triad of male identities of baby adult outsider into the portrayal of every single male character in the show

17:01.660 --> 17:07.660
is exactly what is thematically required to make the episode operate as an anti-gamer propaganda piece.

17:07.660 --> 17:11.660
It's certainly not good storytelling, but it is functional propaganda.

17:11.660 --> 17:19.660
And that propaganda is reliant on this very conservative and ultimately grossly inaccurate understanding of men

17:19.660 --> 17:25.660
and portrayal of both gamers and the gamer-gate they so very much want to mention but never actually do.

17:25.660 --> 17:28.660
Moreover, for a show that wants to push a progressivist agenda,

17:28.660 --> 17:36.660
well, not a real progressivist agenda, because if that were the case, they'd portray gamers as a diverse group that is actually not at all abusive, but you get what I'm saying.

17:36.660 --> 17:42.660
Did you actually have to go with naming your Indian character Punjabi? Jesus.

17:42.660 --> 17:48.660
I have to wonder, was the actress herself a bit offended by that, but just swallowed her pride and took the paycheck?

17:48.660 --> 17:54.660
I don't know how it is anywhere else in the world, but where I'm from, Punjabi is generally considered a racial slur.

17:54.660 --> 18:03.660
And while thematically she's meant to be Brianna Wu or Zoe Quinn, she wears Anita Sarkeesian's earrings, purposefully I'm sure, and looks more like Jenny Barrage than anybody else.

18:03.660 --> 18:10.660
Do keep in mind that last I heard, Jenny Barrage has received harassment for being a girl gamer as well as for trying to build basegamer.com,

18:10.660 --> 18:18.660
but her harassment hasn't come from angry male gamers, her harassment has come from the angry supporters of the journalists and developers that oppose gamer-gate.

18:18.660 --> 18:22.660
Law and order literally got nothing right in their story.

18:22.660 --> 18:27.660
Speaking of those angry supporters of corruption in anti-gamer-gate, let's see what they have to say about this whole thing.

18:27.660 --> 18:31.660
Here's Zoe Quinn hiding in a bathroom being crushed by the weight of it all.

18:31.660 --> 18:37.660
I don't know if Law and Order should trigger you this much Zoe, if it does you should probably just turn the TV off and do something else.

18:37.660 --> 18:50.660
Here's Rob Cipher describing exactly what Law and Order actually just did, and he says this quality film about social activism will annihilate the gamer-gate mind hive once and for all.

18:50.660 --> 18:55.660
Yeah, I have a feeling it's not going to do that.

18:55.660 --> 19:02.660
Here's Warren Light, someone who actually works on the show, saying that women are thanking him for taking on misogyny in gaming.

19:02.660 --> 19:05.660
Well you didn't do that, you made up a boogeyman.

19:05.660 --> 19:12.660
Here's Brianna Wu, the part of the Law and Order episode that seems implausible is how there's an online threat to women and the police do something.

19:12.660 --> 19:16.660
Yeah, the thing about threats is that they have to be proven, Brianna.

19:16.660 --> 19:29.660
And so far, any threats towards you that I've seen has come from one Twitter account which got banned, and all of us are in complete support if Twitter decided to backtrace that account, get the IP, and have the person arrested.

19:29.660 --> 19:34.660
And of course she says, I'm concerned about this Darknet Ice-T was warning us about.

19:34.660 --> 19:41.660
Okay, Jonathan McIntosh often says that gamers cannot tell the difference between fantasy and real life.

19:41.660 --> 19:52.660
The basis of the movies Mazes and Monsters and Skullduggery and a lot of other D&D propaganda was that people who play D&D cannot tell the difference between the game and real life.

19:52.660 --> 20:00.660
This is something that we hear a lot, and yet here's Brianna actually thinking that Ice-T's comments about the Darknet warrants real world investigation.

20:00.660 --> 20:05.660
She also thinks she's Batman. Here's Ben Kucera, and this actually plays to a larger point.

20:05.660 --> 20:12.660
He says it's kind of hard to be snarky about bad TV shows dramatizing this when vulnerable people are still actively targeted in the long term.

20:12.660 --> 20:17.660
Anti-Gamergate is turning on this show. They weren't promoting it before. They're turning on it now.

20:17.660 --> 20:25.660
I think it's because they're finally starting to realize that when they take their own narrative and play it out, it looks ridiculous. But more on that later.

20:26.660 --> 20:27.660
Here's good ol' Alex Lifeshits.

20:34.660 --> 20:39.660
I'm sure it isn't. Do keep in mind, though, that in the show, the threats were reported. People were traced.

20:39.660 --> 20:45.660
If you've received threats, if Zoe's received threats, report them. Don't brag on the internet that you've reported them.

20:45.660 --> 20:52.660
Don't make it a big thing because the police will inevitably say, hey, don't do that. Report them, do what they say, and get them caught.

20:52.660 --> 20:57.660
I know Zoe has said, August never ends. August never ends because you don't want it to end.

20:57.660 --> 21:05.660
Here's Maya Kramer and Cara Ellison, both of them saying basically that the ending was a downer. Law and they've already won order.

21:05.660 --> 21:10.660
Law and quit your job, women. Who cares what you do? It's true. The ending was a downer.

21:10.660 --> 21:12.660
I don't want to see that happen to women. Absolutely not.

21:12.660 --> 21:21.660
I do want to see corrupt people, men or women, lose their jobs. I do want to see them be punished legally, if applicable.

21:21.660 --> 21:24.660
Nobody wants to see them raped. Nobody talks about that.

21:24.660 --> 21:32.660
And here's social justice Kirby complaining that the internet is making memes again. Someone please plant the no fun allowed sign.

21:32.660 --> 21:35.660
Here's everybody's favorite dog rapist, Sarah Butts.

21:35.660 --> 21:43.660
The narrative of gamergate SVU was essentially that despite the best efforts of law enforcement, certain tragedies are unavoidable.

21:43.660 --> 21:51.660
No, that wasn't the narrative. The narrative was that all gamers are terrible human beings and that is not true.

21:51.660 --> 21:58.660
And they decided to stage a rape scene on a show in order to push that narrative.

21:58.660 --> 22:05.660
To slander an entire group of people, a very diverse group of people, all for their own ideological ends. It's disgusting.

22:05.660 --> 22:12.660
And here's Zoe saying that the story was basically all about her and that she should have been contacted by law and order to get her permission to actually do the episode.

22:12.660 --> 22:16.660
I think that's why they went with somebody who wasn't you, Zoe.

22:16.660 --> 22:23.660
Zoe, the world doesn't revolve around you. Gamergate doesn't even revolve around you. You're the Franz Ferdinand of gamergate.

22:23.660 --> 22:32.660
And I must point out, I know that this person wasn't based on you because as shitty as Amazonian Warriors is, it still seems to be a lot better than Depression Quest.

22:32.660 --> 22:35.660
I'll end it off with Jason Schreier because this kind of speaks to my larger point.

22:35.660 --> 22:44.660
He says law and order is a terrible television show. He makes fun of Ice-T. He says that Civilization 5 is obviously much better than Amazonian Warrior.

22:44.660 --> 22:52.660
And he wrote an article on Kotaku about it. Now his Kotaku article entitled, So that was law and order's gamergate episode, is very very negative.

22:53.660 --> 23:05.660
And I think this is very interesting because the narrative that these journalists and these developers have pushed this whole time, pushed for six months, is that women are being harassed.

23:05.660 --> 23:18.660
There is no ethical violation anywhere. This is about harassment of women. This is about women being chased from their homes. This is about women being hit with rape threats, women being hit with death threats.

23:18.660 --> 23:25.660
That's their narrative. That's what they're saying. That's what they're saying everywhere they can, anywhere they can.

23:25.660 --> 23:37.660
But suddenly, when a show like, say, Law and Order comes along, takes that narrative and actually puts it into practice, actually crafts a story from that narrative, they release it publicly and people watch it.

23:37.660 --> 23:43.660
Suddenly it's a bad episode. That episode is based on your narrative. That is what you're pushing.

23:43.660 --> 23:53.660
It's an untrue narrative, yes, but it's the narrative that you push. And now various writers are latching onto that narrative, making stories out of it, and throwing it back at you.

23:53.660 --> 23:56.660
And now you're seeing why you're so incorrect?

23:56.660 --> 24:04.660
A lot of gamergate's opponents thought that this Law and Order thing was going to be like a nail in the coffin for gamergate, and it's just backfiring in their faces.

24:04.660 --> 24:12.660
Because people are beginning to see just how ridiculous, how wildly out there the claims of anti-gamergate are.

24:12.660 --> 24:18.660
The narrative of misogyny and death threats and harassment culminated in this episode.

24:18.660 --> 24:29.660
And now that people are seeing what actually happens when this shit goes down, and comparing it to what's actually happening in gamergate in real life, they're realizing, oh hey, that's not gamergate.

24:29.660 --> 24:44.660
Now I would go over what pro-gamergate thought of the episode. However if you go on twitter and check out the hashtag, it is 100% shitposting and new memes. Thanks guys.

24:59.660 --> 25:03.660
Where does he game? Where does he play his video games, ma'am?
