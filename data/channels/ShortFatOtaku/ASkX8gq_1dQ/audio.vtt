WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:10.280
Oh boy, it feels like I've been asleep for, um, how long?

00:10.280 --> 00:11.480
Asleep for five days.

00:11.480 --> 00:13.480
Yeah, sorry about that.

00:13.480 --> 00:18.200
While I slept, Biden's 2022 State of the Union went down, and I want to talk about

00:18.200 --> 00:19.200
it a little bit.

00:19.200 --> 00:22.960
For those of you not in the know, somehow, the yearly State of the Union comes from Article

00:22.960 --> 00:26.340
2, Section 3, Clause 1 of the US Constitution.

00:26.340 --> 00:30.460
The President shall, from time to time, give to the Congress information of the State of

00:30.460 --> 00:34.780
the Union and recommend to their consideration such measures as he shall judge necessary

00:34.780 --> 00:35.780
and expedient.

00:35.780 --> 00:39.900
Notice that it says from time to time and not yearly, but at this point it's become

00:39.900 --> 00:43.700
traditional that the State of the Union speech happened once a year, generally sometime in

00:43.700 --> 00:45.220
the first couple of months.

00:45.220 --> 00:50.300
Some notes of the first State of the Union from 1790 still survive, but for over a century

00:50.300 --> 00:56.060
until 1913, the State of the Union was a written letter read off by a clerk, not a speech.

00:56.100 --> 01:00.840
As Americans, being reasonably anti-monarchy in their sentiment, tried to distance themselves

01:00.840 --> 01:04.500
from the similarly-purposed British tradition, the speech from the throne.

01:04.500 --> 01:08.540
But when radio became the next big thing, people recognized the value in actually hearing

01:08.540 --> 01:09.780
the President speak.

01:09.780 --> 01:14.820
And so, it's become a broadcast event ever since, transitioning to TV and later internet

01:14.820 --> 01:15.820
streaming.

01:15.820 --> 01:19.380
I'm providing this context to make a point, despite that anti-monarch sentiment that the

01:19.380 --> 01:24.140
Americans are attached to, there's still a lot of pomp and ceremony surrounding the State

01:24.140 --> 01:25.140
of the Union.

01:25.140 --> 01:28.300
There's a certain level of decorums expected during the event, more so than a normal day

01:28.300 --> 01:29.300
in the house.

01:29.300 --> 01:32.420
Every time you watch a State of the Union and there's a large pause in the speech, and

01:32.420 --> 01:37.420
there's like 30 seconds of applause, yeah, it drags out what should be a half-hour talk

01:37.420 --> 01:39.060
to sometimes over an hour.

01:39.060 --> 01:40.820
But the spectacle of it is the point.

01:40.820 --> 01:44.220
On the Wikipedia page for the State of the Union, a passage regarding the applause reads

01:44.220 --> 01:45.220
as follows.

01:45.220 --> 01:49.520
The applause is often political in tone, with many portions of the speech being applauded

01:49.520 --> 01:51.780
only by members of the President's own party.

01:51.780 --> 01:56.220
As non-political officeholders, members of the Supreme Court or the Joint Chiefs of Staff

01:56.220 --> 02:00.020
rarely applaud in order to retain the appearance of political impartiality.

02:00.020 --> 02:03.580
In recent years, the Presiding Officers of the House and the Senate, the Speaker and

02:03.580 --> 02:08.100
the Vice President respectively, have departed from the neutrality expected of the Presiding

02:08.100 --> 02:13.420
Officers of Deliberative Bodies as they, too, stand and applaud in response to the remarks

02:13.420 --> 02:16.300
of the President with which they agree, citation needed.

02:16.340 --> 02:22.940
Well, while I was in my, um, recent malaise, I decided to challenge this citation needed,

02:22.940 --> 02:26.060
and see for myself, by watching past State of the Unions.

02:26.060 --> 02:29.460
Uh, a lot of past State of the Unions.

02:29.460 --> 02:32.320
Sometimes I wish my brain would allow me to work on things properly, you know?

02:32.320 --> 02:35.900
A consistent thing in older State of the Unions is that everybody applauds when the President

02:35.900 --> 02:36.900
first comes in.

02:36.900 --> 02:40.400
Doesn't matter whether it's your party's guy or the other party's, including, generally,

02:40.400 --> 02:44.180
those Presiding Officers who are expected to maintain some impartiality.

02:44.180 --> 02:48.460
But historically, after that, they actually didn't applaud during the speech when the

02:48.460 --> 02:49.460
crowd did.

02:49.460 --> 02:50.460
Here's the reason for that.

02:50.460 --> 02:53.980
Behind the President to the left is the Vice President, who is the Senior Officer of the

02:53.980 --> 02:56.900
Senate, and to the right is the Speaker, the Senior Officer of the House.

02:56.900 --> 03:01.820
The American System's three branches, Executive, Judicial, and Legislative, are on some level

03:01.820 --> 03:03.780
set up to be at odds with each other.

03:03.780 --> 03:07.240
No one branch wields all the power, and they are often combative.

03:07.240 --> 03:11.140
This is why, when the State of the Union happens, the President must be formally invited by

03:11.140 --> 03:12.900
the Legislative branch to give his report.

03:12.900 --> 03:16.900
Congress is not the House of the President, he is a guest there, and those who preside

03:16.900 --> 03:21.700
over that House, those Senior Officers, do so as the hosts of the President.

03:21.700 --> 03:25.580
It's therefore reasonable that there would be an expectation of them to remain neutral

03:25.580 --> 03:28.940
parties, especially if they may disagree with the President politically.

03:28.940 --> 03:31.900
And a lot of the older State of the Union speeches bear this out.

03:31.900 --> 03:34.940
It's pretty consistent for the guys behind the President not to applaud.

03:34.940 --> 03:38.640
In 1960, when Eisenhower was President, they didn't so much as budge.

03:38.640 --> 03:42.120
The applause was shorter too, which certainly helped the time pass.

03:42.120 --> 03:55.280
Also, that's a baby Nixon back there, what a cute little guy.

03:55.280 --> 03:58.100
Under Kennedy and Johnson, same thing, those guys aren't moving.

03:58.100 --> 04:01.840
When Nixon finally became President himself, there's a weird framing with at least his

04:01.840 --> 04:02.980
first State of the Union.

04:02.980 --> 04:07.360
The camera rarely moves off of his face, except for room-wide shots, but occasionally you

04:07.360 --> 04:10.320
can actually see clapping from his VP in the background.

04:10.320 --> 04:14.000
It's not common, it's certainly not after every single sentence, but it happens once

04:14.000 --> 04:15.000
in a while.

04:15.000 --> 04:19.080
I'm not surprised that the first break from decorum, even if slightly, began with Nixon.

04:19.080 --> 04:23.600
Nixon's later State of the Unions saw more applause from the VP, but still none from

04:23.600 --> 04:24.600
the Speaker of the House.

04:24.600 --> 04:28.760
I would guess that the rationalization for this was that the VP is both the Senior Senate

04:28.760 --> 04:32.440
Officer but also part of the Executive Branch, so whatever.

04:32.440 --> 04:36.920
Gerald Ford continued the weird head-only framing, and I couldn't tell how often his

04:36.920 --> 04:40.100
VP applauded, but frankly he didn't get much applause anyway.

04:40.100 --> 04:41.100
Not surprising.

04:41.100 --> 04:43.200
Jimmy Carter's VP applauded regularly.

04:43.200 --> 04:46.160
Reagan brought something virtually unknown to the State of the Union.

04:46.160 --> 04:50.240
Audience laughter to his jokes, also not surprising, but this was also the point when the Speaker

04:50.240 --> 04:52.460
of the House started applauding in the background too.

04:52.460 --> 04:56.720
Every President after Reagan, regardless of political party, had both the VP and the Speaker

04:56.720 --> 05:01.200
applaud, with them beginning to stand to applaud under Bush Senior, while the applause from

05:01.200 --> 05:03.320
the crowd gets longer and louder.

05:03.320 --> 05:07.040
The speeches back in the day were between half an hour and 45 minutes, generally.

05:07.040 --> 05:10.000
In the modern era they're regularly an hour long, and the speeches themselves aren't

05:10.000 --> 05:11.840
actually longer, it's all that clapping.

05:11.840 --> 05:15.440
However, the first time the State of the Union actually turned into a shitshow, where the

05:15.440 --> 05:19.700
rules of decorum weren't breached politely with some applause, but instead with a direct

05:19.700 --> 05:43.140
rebuke was President Barack Obama, 2009.

05:43.140 --> 05:48.500
That's Republican Congressman Joe Wilson shouting, you lie, to Obama's claim about Obamacare

05:48.500 --> 05:52.900
not covering illegal immigrants, an act that was condemned by the entirety of the House,

05:52.900 --> 05:56.020
regardless of political party, and which Wilson would later apologize for.

05:56.020 --> 05:57.580
Look at their shocked expressions.

05:57.580 --> 05:59.980
Obama wants to respond to the heckler, but stops himself.

05:59.980 --> 06:03.940
Joe Biden looks over with disdain, and then shakes his head in embarrassment and disgrace.

06:03.940 --> 06:08.260
Nancy Pelosi looks shocked, like did somebody actually just do that, during the State of

06:08.260 --> 06:09.260
the Union?

06:09.260 --> 06:12.780
Keep Pelosi's reaction in mind for later, it's going to be hilarious considering what

06:12.780 --> 06:13.900
comes next.

06:13.900 --> 06:17.900
Only one Republican would actually outright refuse to attend any of Obama's various

06:17.900 --> 06:21.700
State of the Unions over the years, but other party members would repeatedly break convention

06:21.700 --> 06:22.700
in other ways.

06:22.700 --> 06:27.300
They would scoff, groan, and heckle the President during his speeches, though never quite reaching

06:27.300 --> 06:29.860
the level of Wilson's infamous you lie moment.

06:29.860 --> 06:34.220
However, when Trump got elected, the Democrats would take this new precedent set by the Republicans

06:34.220 --> 06:36.220
and turn it up to 11.

06:36.220 --> 06:38.020
Trump's 2018 State of the Union.

06:38.020 --> 06:41.380
The Republicans controlled the House, the Senate, the Presidency, and the Supreme Court

06:41.380 --> 06:47.580
tilted right after the appointment of Neil Gortch?

06:47.580 --> 06:48.580
This guy.

06:48.580 --> 06:51.440
Everything was in the Republicans' hands, and the Democrats, throwing a tantrum far

06:51.440 --> 06:55.860
beyond Wilson's you lie moment, would let everybody know how they felt about it.

06:55.860 --> 06:59.100
When Trump first entered the chamber, they didn't rise from their seats for the first

06:59.100 --> 07:03.580
time in history, wheelchair-bound people notwithstanding, disrespecting the precedent that one stands

07:03.580 --> 07:07.300
out of respect for the office of the Presidency, not necessarily the President himself.

07:07.300 --> 07:12.020
They turned their backs on Trump as he walked towards the podium, a component of the pre-speech

07:12.020 --> 07:15.700
where normally the President shakes hands as the House applauds his approach.

07:15.700 --> 07:20.480
They heckled him and made faces to the cameras, and a larger number of them simply refused

07:20.480 --> 07:21.480
to attend.

07:21.480 --> 07:26.020
Even as Trump reported good news, economic upswings, companies creating jobs, lowered

07:26.020 --> 07:29.420
unemployment, the Democrats sat there sulking for the world to see.

07:29.420 --> 07:33.800
I'm sure Starbucks-sipping university students thought this was praxis insulting Trump right

07:33.800 --> 07:37.820
to his face during what Americans consider to be the most sanctified event while the

07:37.820 --> 07:40.460
rest of the world watched, but most people just thought it was petty.

07:40.460 --> 07:44.920
And in 2020, when Nancy Pelosi was back in the Speaker's chair again, she infamously

07:44.920 --> 07:47.740
ripped up her copy of Trump's speech after he had given it.

07:47.740 --> 07:48.740
Right on camera.

07:48.740 --> 07:53.080
A far cry from the woman who, 11 years earlier, expressed such shock at somebody who would

07:53.080 --> 07:55.680
dare to heckle the President during the State of the Union.

07:55.680 --> 07:59.880
It took a concentrated effort from both Republicans and Democrats for several decades, but we're

07:59.880 --> 08:00.880
at the end result now.

08:00.880 --> 08:04.760
The State of the Union is no longer viewed as a moment of necessary needed unity between

08:04.760 --> 08:08.640
disparate political factions, who occasionally need to be reminded that they are, in the

08:08.640 --> 08:11.720
end, on the same team as Americans.

08:11.720 --> 08:16.240
Now it's just another speech, where the guy in charge has his cronies play him up

08:16.240 --> 08:18.200
and his detractors publicly shit on him.

08:18.200 --> 08:21.500
At least, it's more blatantly that now than it ever was before.

08:21.500 --> 08:25.280
I think it's interesting to note, though, that when the really serious instances of

08:25.280 --> 08:30.000
disunity began, it was because, on the Republican side, they had convinced themselves that Obama

08:30.000 --> 08:33.960
was not a real American, and therefore they didn't need to unite with an anti-American

08:33.960 --> 08:34.960
faction.

08:34.960 --> 08:39.280
Meanwhile, on the Democratic side, as global citizens, they no longer care about American

08:39.280 --> 08:42.060
as an identity, certainly not enough to unite towards it.

08:42.060 --> 08:46.100
Which is why, when I watched the recent State of the Union by President Biden, we're finally

08:46.100 --> 09:00.340
back here, I thought this initial introduction was ridiculous to hear.

09:00.340 --> 09:02.560
Now you're asking for bipartisanship?

09:02.560 --> 09:05.660
After everything that's happened, and both sides are to blame here, but after all the

09:05.660 --> 09:09.500
shit everyone's pulled, now that you hold all the chips the way that the Republicans

09:09.500 --> 09:12.580
did in 2018, now you want bipartisanship.

09:12.580 --> 09:16.440
Now you want unity, which in this case, means everybody just comes under your banner and

09:16.440 --> 09:17.660
follows your direction?

09:17.660 --> 09:21.860
You didn't have this reconciliatory tone back when Trump was giving these speeches.

09:21.860 --> 09:26.620
One of President Kennedy's most famous quotes is, you cannot negotiate with people who say

09:26.620 --> 09:29.540
what's mine is mine and what's yours is negotiable.

09:29.540 --> 09:33.620
You cannot call for unity under your banner when you hold all the cards, claiming that

09:33.620 --> 09:35.180
it's somehow neutral.

09:35.180 --> 09:39.340
While when the pendulum has swung the other way, you kick and scream and screech that

09:39.340 --> 09:41.020
it's just not fair.

09:41.020 --> 09:44.140
That's not what neutrality is, that's not how this works.

09:44.140 --> 09:48.060
The speech itself, the one that Biden gave, to be honest it was just so-so, there was

09:48.060 --> 09:49.060
some good stuff in there.

09:49.060 --> 09:52.660
And I don't just mean the bits that he blatantly took from Trump's agenda, like the whole

09:52.660 --> 10:14.980
manufacture-in-America thing, or the lower-the-price-of-insulin thing, or the lower-the-price-of-insulin

10:14.980 --> 10:29.740
thing.

10:29.740 --> 10:33.060
That second one, by the way, Trump actually did it, and then Biden cancelled it, and now

10:33.060 --> 10:35.020
Biden's putting it back into place.

10:35.020 --> 10:37.980
But no, his remarks in Ukraine, for example, were fine.

10:37.980 --> 10:40.140
Well, the content of those remarks, anyway.

10:40.140 --> 10:41.580
Biden brain was still a factor.

10:41.580 --> 10:45.900
He kept stumbling over his words, and at this point I'm half attributing that to his age,

10:45.900 --> 10:47.580
and half to his lifelong stutter.

10:47.580 --> 10:52.340
We've all seen that viral clip of Biden saying Iranian when meaning to say Ukrainian,

10:52.340 --> 11:05.280
for example, and how Kamala Harris weirdly mouths the proper word to herself in the background.

11:05.280 --> 11:09.660
Or how Nancy Pelosi stood up and rubbed her knuckles together like a goblin, while Biden

11:09.660 --> 11:12.900
was talking about people getting cancer from burn pits in Iraq.

11:12.900 --> 11:13.900
What the fuck?

11:13.900 --> 11:25.060
Okay, clearly, she got up to applaud something that she thought was coming right away, and

11:25.060 --> 11:26.980
when it didn't come, she already sat back down.

11:26.980 --> 11:27.980
Look at that face.

11:27.980 --> 11:29.980
That's someone who knows she's just made an oopsie.

11:29.980 --> 11:32.900
Whoa, whoa, whoa, don't get up again, Nancy, I thought you learned your lesson the first

11:32.900 --> 11:33.900
time.

11:33.900 --> 11:36.740
Yes, yes, this time you should actually get up.

11:36.740 --> 11:38.740
Jesus, Nancy Pelosi, what the hell?

11:38.740 --> 11:40.700
The years have not been kind to you.

11:40.700 --> 11:44.460
But Biden's speech itself, the content, was passable.

11:44.460 --> 11:48.180
I think it would have sounded better coming out of a different person's mouth, but fine.

11:48.180 --> 11:51.780
The issue at this point is how gamified the whole thing has become, and that's a larger

11:51.780 --> 11:54.960
topic because everything is becoming gamified right now.

11:54.960 --> 11:58.780
So when people like Lauren Boebert heckle Biden during the State of the Union,

11:58.780 --> 12:16.980
And then others on social media begin screeching for her resignation.

12:16.980 --> 12:17.980
How dare you?

12:17.980 --> 12:21.380
I'm just like, okay, yeah, I don't like that shit either.

12:21.380 --> 12:23.580
But stop acting like this is somehow new.

12:23.580 --> 12:26.980
Like it's some unprecedented affront to the office of the presidency.

12:26.980 --> 12:27.980
It's not.

12:27.980 --> 12:30.140
That's what everybody has turned the State of the Union into.

12:30.140 --> 12:31.140
You too.

12:31.140 --> 12:34.900
People who want Boebert's head are the same people who were going yas queen slay when

12:34.900 --> 12:36.380
the squad did it to Trump.

12:36.380 --> 12:37.420
Shut the fuck up.
