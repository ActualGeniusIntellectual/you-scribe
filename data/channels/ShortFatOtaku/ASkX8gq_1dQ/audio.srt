1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,280
Oh boy, it feels like I've been asleep for, um, how long?

2
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:11,480
Asleep for five days.

3
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:13,480
Yeah, sorry about that.

4
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:18,200
While I slept, Biden's 2022 State of the Union went down, and I want to talk about

5
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:19,200
it a little bit.

6
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:22,960
For those of you not in the know, somehow, the yearly State of the Union comes from Article

7
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:26,340
2, Section 3, Clause 1 of the US Constitution.

8
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:30,460
The President shall, from time to time, give to the Congress information of the State of

9
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:34,780
the Union and recommend to their consideration such measures as he shall judge necessary

10
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:35,780
and expedient.

11
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:39,900
Notice that it says from time to time and not yearly, but at this point it's become

12
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:43,700
traditional that the State of the Union speech happened once a year, generally sometime in

13
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:45,220
the first couple of months.

14
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:50,300
Some notes of the first State of the Union from 1790 still survive, but for over a century

15
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:56,060
until 1913, the State of the Union was a written letter read off by a clerk, not a speech.

16
00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:00,840
As Americans, being reasonably anti-monarchy in their sentiment, tried to distance themselves

17
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:04,500
from the similarly-purposed British tradition, the speech from the throne.

18
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:08,540
But when radio became the next big thing, people recognized the value in actually hearing

19
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:09,780
the President speak.

20
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:14,820
And so, it's become a broadcast event ever since, transitioning to TV and later internet

21
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:15,820
streaming.

22
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:19,380
I'm providing this context to make a point, despite that anti-monarch sentiment that the

23
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:24,140
Americans are attached to, there's still a lot of pomp and ceremony surrounding the State

24
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:25,140
of the Union.

25
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:28,300
There's a certain level of decorums expected during the event, more so than a normal day

26
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:29,300
in the house.

27
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:32,420
Every time you watch a State of the Union and there's a large pause in the speech, and

28
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:37,420
there's like 30 seconds of applause, yeah, it drags out what should be a half-hour talk

29
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:39,060
to sometimes over an hour.

30
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:40,820
But the spectacle of it is the point.

31
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:44,220
On the Wikipedia page for the State of the Union, a passage regarding the applause reads

32
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:45,220
as follows.

33
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:49,520
The applause is often political in tone, with many portions of the speech being applauded

34
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,780
only by members of the President's own party.

35
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:56,220
As non-political officeholders, members of the Supreme Court or the Joint Chiefs of Staff

36
00:01:56,220 --> 00:02:00,020
rarely applaud in order to retain the appearance of political impartiality.

37
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:03,580
In recent years, the Presiding Officers of the House and the Senate, the Speaker and

38
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:08,100
the Vice President respectively, have departed from the neutrality expected of the Presiding

39
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:13,420
Officers of Deliberative Bodies as they, too, stand and applaud in response to the remarks

40
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:16,300
of the President with which they agree, citation needed.

41
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:22,940
Well, while I was in my, um, recent malaise, I decided to challenge this citation needed,

42
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:26,060
and see for myself, by watching past State of the Unions.

43
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:29,460
Uh, a lot of past State of the Unions.

44
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:32,320
Sometimes I wish my brain would allow me to work on things properly, you know?

45
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:35,900
A consistent thing in older State of the Unions is that everybody applauds when the President

46
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:36,900
first comes in.

47
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:40,400
Doesn't matter whether it's your party's guy or the other party's, including, generally,

48
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:44,180
those Presiding Officers who are expected to maintain some impartiality.

49
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:48,460
But historically, after that, they actually didn't applaud during the speech when the

50
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:49,460
crowd did.

51
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:50,460
Here's the reason for that.

52
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:53,980
Behind the President to the left is the Vice President, who is the Senior Officer of the

53
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:56,900
Senate, and to the right is the Speaker, the Senior Officer of the House.

54
00:02:56,900 --> 00:03:01,820
The American System's three branches, Executive, Judicial, and Legislative, are on some level

55
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:03,780
set up to be at odds with each other.

56
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:07,240
No one branch wields all the power, and they are often combative.

57
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:11,140
This is why, when the State of the Union happens, the President must be formally invited by

58
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:12,900
the Legislative branch to give his report.

59
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:16,900
Congress is not the House of the President, he is a guest there, and those who preside

60
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:21,700
over that House, those Senior Officers, do so as the hosts of the President.

61
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:25,580
It's therefore reasonable that there would be an expectation of them to remain neutral

62
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:28,940
parties, especially if they may disagree with the President politically.

63
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:31,900
And a lot of the older State of the Union speeches bear this out.

64
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:34,940
It's pretty consistent for the guys behind the President not to applaud.

65
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:38,640
In 1960, when Eisenhower was President, they didn't so much as budge.

66
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:42,120
The applause was shorter too, which certainly helped the time pass.

67
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:55,280
Also, that's a baby Nixon back there, what a cute little guy.

68
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:58,100
Under Kennedy and Johnson, same thing, those guys aren't moving.

69
00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:01,840
When Nixon finally became President himself, there's a weird framing with at least his

70
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:02,980
first State of the Union.

71
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:07,360
The camera rarely moves off of his face, except for room-wide shots, but occasionally you

72
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,320
can actually see clapping from his VP in the background.

73
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:14,000
It's not common, it's certainly not after every single sentence, but it happens once

74
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
in a while.

75
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,080
I'm not surprised that the first break from decorum, even if slightly, began with Nixon.

76
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:23,600
Nixon's later State of the Unions saw more applause from the VP, but still none from

77
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,600
the Speaker of the House.

78
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:28,760
I would guess that the rationalization for this was that the VP is both the Senior Senate

79
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:32,440
Officer but also part of the Executive Branch, so whatever.

80
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:36,920
Gerald Ford continued the weird head-only framing, and I couldn't tell how often his

81
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:40,100
VP applauded, but frankly he didn't get much applause anyway.

82
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:41,100
Not surprising.

83
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:43,200
Jimmy Carter's VP applauded regularly.

84
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:46,160
Reagan brought something virtually unknown to the State of the Union.

85
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:50,240
Audience laughter to his jokes, also not surprising, but this was also the point when the Speaker

86
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,460
of the House started applauding in the background too.

87
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:56,720
Every President after Reagan, regardless of political party, had both the VP and the Speaker

88
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:01,200
applaud, with them beginning to stand to applaud under Bush Senior, while the applause from

89
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:03,320
the crowd gets longer and louder.

90
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:07,040
The speeches back in the day were between half an hour and 45 minutes, generally.

91
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:10,000
In the modern era they're regularly an hour long, and the speeches themselves aren't

92
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,840
actually longer, it's all that clapping.

93
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:15,440
However, the first time the State of the Union actually turned into a shitshow, where the

94
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:19,700
rules of decorum weren't breached politely with some applause, but instead with a direct

95
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:43,140
rebuke was President Barack Obama, 2009.

96
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:48,500
That's Republican Congressman Joe Wilson shouting, you lie, to Obama's claim about Obamacare

97
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:52,900
not covering illegal immigrants, an act that was condemned by the entirety of the House,

98
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:56,020
regardless of political party, and which Wilson would later apologize for.

99
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:57,580
Look at their shocked expressions.

100
00:05:57,580 --> 00:05:59,980
Obama wants to respond to the heckler, but stops himself.

101
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:03,940
Joe Biden looks over with disdain, and then shakes his head in embarrassment and disgrace.

102
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:08,260
Nancy Pelosi looks shocked, like did somebody actually just do that, during the State of

103
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:09,260
the Union?

104
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:12,780
Keep Pelosi's reaction in mind for later, it's going to be hilarious considering what

105
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:13,900
comes next.

106
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:17,900
Only one Republican would actually outright refuse to attend any of Obama's various

107
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:21,700
State of the Unions over the years, but other party members would repeatedly break convention

108
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:22,700
in other ways.

109
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:27,300
They would scoff, groan, and heckle the President during his speeches, though never quite reaching

110
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:29,860
the level of Wilson's infamous you lie moment.

111
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:34,220
However, when Trump got elected, the Democrats would take this new precedent set by the Republicans

112
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:36,220
and turn it up to 11.

113
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:38,020
Trump's 2018 State of the Union.

114
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:41,380
The Republicans controlled the House, the Senate, the Presidency, and the Supreme Court

115
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:47,580
tilted right after the appointment of Neil Gortch?

116
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:48,580
This guy.

117
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:51,440
Everything was in the Republicans' hands, and the Democrats, throwing a tantrum far

118
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:55,860
beyond Wilson's you lie moment, would let everybody know how they felt about it.

119
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:59,100
When Trump first entered the chamber, they didn't rise from their seats for the first

120
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:03,580
time in history, wheelchair-bound people notwithstanding, disrespecting the precedent that one stands

121
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:07,300
out of respect for the office of the Presidency, not necessarily the President himself.

122
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:12,020
They turned their backs on Trump as he walked towards the podium, a component of the pre-speech

123
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:15,700
where normally the President shakes hands as the House applauds his approach.

124
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:20,480
They heckled him and made faces to the cameras, and a larger number of them simply refused

125
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,480
to attend.

126
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:26,020
Even as Trump reported good news, economic upswings, companies creating jobs, lowered

127
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:29,420
unemployment, the Democrats sat there sulking for the world to see.

128
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:33,800
I'm sure Starbucks-sipping university students thought this was praxis insulting Trump right

129
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:37,820
to his face during what Americans consider to be the most sanctified event while the

130
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:40,460
rest of the world watched, but most people just thought it was petty.

131
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:44,920
And in 2020, when Nancy Pelosi was back in the Speaker's chair again, she infamously

132
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:47,740
ripped up her copy of Trump's speech after he had given it.

133
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:48,740
Right on camera.

134
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:53,080
A far cry from the woman who, 11 years earlier, expressed such shock at somebody who would

135
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:55,680
dare to heckle the President during the State of the Union.

136
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:59,880
It took a concentrated effort from both Republicans and Democrats for several decades, but we're

137
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:00,880
at the end result now.

138
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:04,760
The State of the Union is no longer viewed as a moment of necessary needed unity between

139
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:08,640
disparate political factions, who occasionally need to be reminded that they are, in the

140
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:11,720
end, on the same team as Americans.

141
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:16,240
Now it's just another speech, where the guy in charge has his cronies play him up

142
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,200
and his detractors publicly shit on him.

143
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:21,500
At least, it's more blatantly that now than it ever was before.

144
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:25,280
I think it's interesting to note, though, that when the really serious instances of

145
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:30,000
disunity began, it was because, on the Republican side, they had convinced themselves that Obama

146
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,960
was not a real American, and therefore they didn't need to unite with an anti-American

147
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:34,960
faction.

148
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:39,280
Meanwhile, on the Democratic side, as global citizens, they no longer care about American

149
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:42,060
as an identity, certainly not enough to unite towards it.

150
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:46,100
Which is why, when I watched the recent State of the Union by President Biden, we're finally

151
00:08:46,100 --> 00:09:00,340
back here, I thought this initial introduction was ridiculous to hear.

152
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:02,560
Now you're asking for bipartisanship?

153
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:05,660
After everything that's happened, and both sides are to blame here, but after all the

154
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:09,500
shit everyone's pulled, now that you hold all the chips the way that the Republicans

155
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:12,580
did in 2018, now you want bipartisanship.

156
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:16,440
Now you want unity, which in this case, means everybody just comes under your banner and

157
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:17,660
follows your direction?

158
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:21,860
You didn't have this reconciliatory tone back when Trump was giving these speeches.

159
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:26,620
One of President Kennedy's most famous quotes is, you cannot negotiate with people who say

160
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:29,540
what's mine is mine and what's yours is negotiable.

161
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:33,620
You cannot call for unity under your banner when you hold all the cards, claiming that

162
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:35,180
it's somehow neutral.

163
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:39,340
While when the pendulum has swung the other way, you kick and scream and screech that

164
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:41,020
it's just not fair.

165
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:44,140
That's not what neutrality is, that's not how this works.

166
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:48,060
The speech itself, the one that Biden gave, to be honest it was just so-so, there was

167
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:49,060
some good stuff in there.

168
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:52,660
And I don't just mean the bits that he blatantly took from Trump's agenda, like the whole

169
00:09:52,660 --> 00:10:14,980
manufacture-in-America thing, or the lower-the-price-of-insulin thing, or the lower-the-price-of-insulin

170
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:29,740
thing.

171
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:33,060
That second one, by the way, Trump actually did it, and then Biden cancelled it, and now

172
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:35,020
Biden's putting it back into place.

173
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:37,980
But no, his remarks in Ukraine, for example, were fine.

174
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:40,140
Well, the content of those remarks, anyway.

175
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:41,580
Biden brain was still a factor.

176
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:45,900
He kept stumbling over his words, and at this point I'm half attributing that to his age,

177
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:47,580
and half to his lifelong stutter.

178
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:52,340
We've all seen that viral clip of Biden saying Iranian when meaning to say Ukrainian,

179
00:10:52,340 --> 00:11:05,280
for example, and how Kamala Harris weirdly mouths the proper word to herself in the background.

180
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:09,660
Or how Nancy Pelosi stood up and rubbed her knuckles together like a goblin, while Biden

181
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:12,900
was talking about people getting cancer from burn pits in Iraq.

182
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:13,900
What the fuck?

183
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:25,060
Okay, clearly, she got up to applaud something that she thought was coming right away, and

184
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:26,980
when it didn't come, she already sat back down.

185
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:27,980
Look at that face.

186
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:29,980
That's someone who knows she's just made an oopsie.

187
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:32,900
Whoa, whoa, whoa, don't get up again, Nancy, I thought you learned your lesson the first

188
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:33,900
time.

189
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:36,740
Yes, yes, this time you should actually get up.

190
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:38,740
Jesus, Nancy Pelosi, what the hell?

191
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:40,700
The years have not been kind to you.

192
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:44,460
But Biden's speech itself, the content, was passable.

193
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:48,180
I think it would have sounded better coming out of a different person's mouth, but fine.

194
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:51,780
The issue at this point is how gamified the whole thing has become, and that's a larger

195
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:54,960
topic because everything is becoming gamified right now.

196
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:58,780
So when people like Lauren Boebert heckle Biden during the State of the Union,

197
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:16,980
And then others on social media begin screeching for her resignation.

198
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:17,980
How dare you?

199
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:21,380
I'm just like, okay, yeah, I don't like that shit either.

200
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:23,580
But stop acting like this is somehow new.

201
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:26,980
Like it's some unprecedented affront to the office of the presidency.

202
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:27,980
It's not.

203
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:30,140
That's what everybody has turned the State of the Union into.

204
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:31,140
You too.

205
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:34,900
People who want Boebert's head are the same people who were going yas queen slay when

206
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:36,380
the squad did it to Trump.

207
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:37,420
Shut the fuck up.
