0	10280	Oh boy, it feels like I've been asleep for, um, how long?
10280	11480	Asleep for five days.
11480	13480	Yeah, sorry about that.
13480	18200	While I slept, Biden's 2022 State of the Union went down, and I want to talk about
18200	19200	it a little bit.
19200	22960	For those of you not in the know, somehow, the yearly State of the Union comes from Article
22960	26340	2, Section 3, Clause 1 of the US Constitution.
26340	30460	The President shall, from time to time, give to the Congress information of the State of
30460	34780	the Union and recommend to their consideration such measures as he shall judge necessary
34780	35780	and expedient.
35780	39900	Notice that it says from time to time and not yearly, but at this point it's become
39900	43700	traditional that the State of the Union speech happened once a year, generally sometime in
43700	45220	the first couple of months.
45220	50300	Some notes of the first State of the Union from 1790 still survive, but for over a century
50300	56060	until 1913, the State of the Union was a written letter read off by a clerk, not a speech.
56100	60840	As Americans, being reasonably anti-monarchy in their sentiment, tried to distance themselves
60840	64500	from the similarly-purposed British tradition, the speech from the throne.
64500	68540	But when radio became the next big thing, people recognized the value in actually hearing
68540	69780	the President speak.
69780	74820	And so, it's become a broadcast event ever since, transitioning to TV and later internet
74820	75820	streaming.
75820	79380	I'm providing this context to make a point, despite that anti-monarch sentiment that the
79380	84140	Americans are attached to, there's still a lot of pomp and ceremony surrounding the State
84140	85140	of the Union.
85140	88300	There's a certain level of decorums expected during the event, more so than a normal day
88300	89300	in the house.
89300	92420	Every time you watch a State of the Union and there's a large pause in the speech, and
92420	97420	there's like 30 seconds of applause, yeah, it drags out what should be a half-hour talk
97420	99060	to sometimes over an hour.
99060	100820	But the spectacle of it is the point.
100820	104220	On the Wikipedia page for the State of the Union, a passage regarding the applause reads
104220	105220	as follows.
105220	109520	The applause is often political in tone, with many portions of the speech being applauded
109520	111780	only by members of the President's own party.
111780	116220	As non-political officeholders, members of the Supreme Court or the Joint Chiefs of Staff
116220	120020	rarely applaud in order to retain the appearance of political impartiality.
120020	123580	In recent years, the Presiding Officers of the House and the Senate, the Speaker and
123580	128100	the Vice President respectively, have departed from the neutrality expected of the Presiding
128100	133420	Officers of Deliberative Bodies as they, too, stand and applaud in response to the remarks
133420	136300	of the President with which they agree, citation needed.
136340	142940	Well, while I was in my, um, recent malaise, I decided to challenge this citation needed,
142940	146060	and see for myself, by watching past State of the Unions.
146060	149460	Uh, a lot of past State of the Unions.
149460	152320	Sometimes I wish my brain would allow me to work on things properly, you know?
152320	155900	A consistent thing in older State of the Unions is that everybody applauds when the President
155900	156900	first comes in.
156900	160400	Doesn't matter whether it's your party's guy or the other party's, including, generally,
160400	164180	those Presiding Officers who are expected to maintain some impartiality.
164180	168460	But historically, after that, they actually didn't applaud during the speech when the
168460	169460	crowd did.
169460	170460	Here's the reason for that.
170460	173980	Behind the President to the left is the Vice President, who is the Senior Officer of the
173980	176900	Senate, and to the right is the Speaker, the Senior Officer of the House.
176900	181820	The American System's three branches, Executive, Judicial, and Legislative, are on some level
181820	183780	set up to be at odds with each other.
183780	187240	No one branch wields all the power, and they are often combative.
187240	191140	This is why, when the State of the Union happens, the President must be formally invited by
191140	192900	the Legislative branch to give his report.
192900	196900	Congress is not the House of the President, he is a guest there, and those who preside
196900	201700	over that House, those Senior Officers, do so as the hosts of the President.
201700	205580	It's therefore reasonable that there would be an expectation of them to remain neutral
205580	208940	parties, especially if they may disagree with the President politically.
208940	211900	And a lot of the older State of the Union speeches bear this out.
211900	214940	It's pretty consistent for the guys behind the President not to applaud.
214940	218640	In 1960, when Eisenhower was President, they didn't so much as budge.
218640	222120	The applause was shorter too, which certainly helped the time pass.
222120	235280	Also, that's a baby Nixon back there, what a cute little guy.
235280	238100	Under Kennedy and Johnson, same thing, those guys aren't moving.
238100	241840	When Nixon finally became President himself, there's a weird framing with at least his
241840	242980	first State of the Union.
242980	247360	The camera rarely moves off of his face, except for room-wide shots, but occasionally you
247360	250320	can actually see clapping from his VP in the background.
250320	254000	It's not common, it's certainly not after every single sentence, but it happens once
254000	255000	in a while.
255000	259080	I'm not surprised that the first break from decorum, even if slightly, began with Nixon.
259080	263600	Nixon's later State of the Unions saw more applause from the VP, but still none from
263600	264600	the Speaker of the House.
264600	268760	I would guess that the rationalization for this was that the VP is both the Senior Senate
268760	272440	Officer but also part of the Executive Branch, so whatever.
272440	276920	Gerald Ford continued the weird head-only framing, and I couldn't tell how often his
276920	280100	VP applauded, but frankly he didn't get much applause anyway.
280100	281100	Not surprising.
281100	283200	Jimmy Carter's VP applauded regularly.
283200	286160	Reagan brought something virtually unknown to the State of the Union.
286160	290240	Audience laughter to his jokes, also not surprising, but this was also the point when the Speaker
290240	292460	of the House started applauding in the background too.
292460	296720	Every President after Reagan, regardless of political party, had both the VP and the Speaker
296720	301200	applaud, with them beginning to stand to applaud under Bush Senior, while the applause from
301200	303320	the crowd gets longer and louder.
303320	307040	The speeches back in the day were between half an hour and 45 minutes, generally.
307040	310000	In the modern era they're regularly an hour long, and the speeches themselves aren't
310000	311840	actually longer, it's all that clapping.
311840	315440	However, the first time the State of the Union actually turned into a shitshow, where the
315440	319700	rules of decorum weren't breached politely with some applause, but instead with a direct
319700	343140	rebuke was President Barack Obama, 2009.
343140	348500	That's Republican Congressman Joe Wilson shouting, you lie, to Obama's claim about Obamacare
348500	352900	not covering illegal immigrants, an act that was condemned by the entirety of the House,
352900	356020	regardless of political party, and which Wilson would later apologize for.
356020	357580	Look at their shocked expressions.
357580	359980	Obama wants to respond to the heckler, but stops himself.
359980	363940	Joe Biden looks over with disdain, and then shakes his head in embarrassment and disgrace.
363940	368260	Nancy Pelosi looks shocked, like did somebody actually just do that, during the State of
368260	369260	the Union?
369260	372780	Keep Pelosi's reaction in mind for later, it's going to be hilarious considering what
372780	373900	comes next.
373900	377900	Only one Republican would actually outright refuse to attend any of Obama's various
377900	381700	State of the Unions over the years, but other party members would repeatedly break convention
381700	382700	in other ways.
382700	387300	They would scoff, groan, and heckle the President during his speeches, though never quite reaching
387300	389860	the level of Wilson's infamous you lie moment.
389860	394220	However, when Trump got elected, the Democrats would take this new precedent set by the Republicans
394220	396220	and turn it up to 11.
396220	398020	Trump's 2018 State of the Union.
398020	401380	The Republicans controlled the House, the Senate, the Presidency, and the Supreme Court
401380	407580	tilted right after the appointment of Neil Gortch?
407580	408580	This guy.
408580	411440	Everything was in the Republicans' hands, and the Democrats, throwing a tantrum far
411440	415860	beyond Wilson's you lie moment, would let everybody know how they felt about it.
415860	419100	When Trump first entered the chamber, they didn't rise from their seats for the first
419100	423580	time in history, wheelchair-bound people notwithstanding, disrespecting the precedent that one stands
423580	427300	out of respect for the office of the Presidency, not necessarily the President himself.
427300	432020	They turned their backs on Trump as he walked towards the podium, a component of the pre-speech
432020	435700	where normally the President shakes hands as the House applauds his approach.
435700	440480	They heckled him and made faces to the cameras, and a larger number of them simply refused
440480	441480	to attend.
441480	446020	Even as Trump reported good news, economic upswings, companies creating jobs, lowered
446020	449420	unemployment, the Democrats sat there sulking for the world to see.
449420	453800	I'm sure Starbucks-sipping university students thought this was praxis insulting Trump right
453800	457820	to his face during what Americans consider to be the most sanctified event while the
457820	460460	rest of the world watched, but most people just thought it was petty.
460460	464920	And in 2020, when Nancy Pelosi was back in the Speaker's chair again, she infamously
464920	467740	ripped up her copy of Trump's speech after he had given it.
467740	468740	Right on camera.
468740	473080	A far cry from the woman who, 11 years earlier, expressed such shock at somebody who would
473080	475680	dare to heckle the President during the State of the Union.
475680	479880	It took a concentrated effort from both Republicans and Democrats for several decades, but we're
479880	480880	at the end result now.
480880	484760	The State of the Union is no longer viewed as a moment of necessary needed unity between
484760	488640	disparate political factions, who occasionally need to be reminded that they are, in the
488640	491720	end, on the same team as Americans.
491720	496240	Now it's just another speech, where the guy in charge has his cronies play him up
496240	498200	and his detractors publicly shit on him.
498200	501500	At least, it's more blatantly that now than it ever was before.
501500	505280	I think it's interesting to note, though, that when the really serious instances of
505280	510000	disunity began, it was because, on the Republican side, they had convinced themselves that Obama
510000	513960	was not a real American, and therefore they didn't need to unite with an anti-American
513960	514960	faction.
514960	519280	Meanwhile, on the Democratic side, as global citizens, they no longer care about American
519280	522060	as an identity, certainly not enough to unite towards it.
522060	526100	Which is why, when I watched the recent State of the Union by President Biden, we're finally
526100	540340	back here, I thought this initial introduction was ridiculous to hear.
540340	542560	Now you're asking for bipartisanship?
542560	545660	After everything that's happened, and both sides are to blame here, but after all the
545660	549500	shit everyone's pulled, now that you hold all the chips the way that the Republicans
549500	552580	did in 2018, now you want bipartisanship.
552580	556440	Now you want unity, which in this case, means everybody just comes under your banner and
556440	557660	follows your direction?
557660	561860	You didn't have this reconciliatory tone back when Trump was giving these speeches.
561860	566620	One of President Kennedy's most famous quotes is, you cannot negotiate with people who say
566620	569540	what's mine is mine and what's yours is negotiable.
569540	573620	You cannot call for unity under your banner when you hold all the cards, claiming that
573620	575180	it's somehow neutral.
575180	579340	While when the pendulum has swung the other way, you kick and scream and screech that
579340	581020	it's just not fair.
581020	584140	That's not what neutrality is, that's not how this works.
584140	588060	The speech itself, the one that Biden gave, to be honest it was just so-so, there was
588060	589060	some good stuff in there.
589060	592660	And I don't just mean the bits that he blatantly took from Trump's agenda, like the whole
592660	614980	manufacture-in-America thing, or the lower-the-price-of-insulin thing, or the lower-the-price-of-insulin
614980	629740	thing.
629740	633060	That second one, by the way, Trump actually did it, and then Biden cancelled it, and now
633060	635020	Biden's putting it back into place.
635020	637980	But no, his remarks in Ukraine, for example, were fine.
637980	640140	Well, the content of those remarks, anyway.
640140	641580	Biden brain was still a factor.
641580	645900	He kept stumbling over his words, and at this point I'm half attributing that to his age,
645900	647580	and half to his lifelong stutter.
647580	652340	We've all seen that viral clip of Biden saying Iranian when meaning to say Ukrainian,
652340	665280	for example, and how Kamala Harris weirdly mouths the proper word to herself in the background.
665280	669660	Or how Nancy Pelosi stood up and rubbed her knuckles together like a goblin, while Biden
669660	672900	was talking about people getting cancer from burn pits in Iraq.
672900	673900	What the fuck?
673900	685060	Okay, clearly, she got up to applaud something that she thought was coming right away, and
685060	686980	when it didn't come, she already sat back down.
686980	687980	Look at that face.
687980	689980	That's someone who knows she's just made an oopsie.
689980	692900	Whoa, whoa, whoa, don't get up again, Nancy, I thought you learned your lesson the first
692900	693900	time.
693900	696740	Yes, yes, this time you should actually get up.
696740	698740	Jesus, Nancy Pelosi, what the hell?
698740	700700	The years have not been kind to you.
700700	704460	But Biden's speech itself, the content, was passable.
704460	708180	I think it would have sounded better coming out of a different person's mouth, but fine.
708180	711780	The issue at this point is how gamified the whole thing has become, and that's a larger
711780	714960	topic because everything is becoming gamified right now.
714960	718780	So when people like Lauren Boebert heckle Biden during the State of the Union,
718780	736980	And then others on social media begin screeching for her resignation.
736980	737980	How dare you?
737980	741380	I'm just like, okay, yeah, I don't like that shit either.
741380	743580	But stop acting like this is somehow new.
743580	746980	Like it's some unprecedented affront to the office of the presidency.
746980	747980	It's not.
747980	750140	That's what everybody has turned the State of the Union into.
750140	751140	You too.
751140	754900	People who want Boebert's head are the same people who were going yas queen slay when
754900	756380	the squad did it to Trump.
756380	757420	Shut the fuck up.
