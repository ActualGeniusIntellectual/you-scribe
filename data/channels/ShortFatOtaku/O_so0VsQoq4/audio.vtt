00:00.000 --> 00:02.860
Ah yes, my white privilege.

00:02.860 --> 00:07.040
People are recounting the outrageous things they've gotten away with because of hashtag

00:07.040 --> 00:08.040
my white privilege.

00:08.040 --> 00:09.240
Oh are they?

00:09.240 --> 00:13.000
This was a trending moment a few days ago, and the moment contains a few testimonials

00:13.000 --> 00:16.920
from white people convinced that their situation is due to their white privilege.

00:16.920 --> 00:21.600
Like Anne here, I got caught stealing multiple times as a teenager, and they never called

00:21.600 --> 00:22.600
the cops.

00:22.600 --> 00:24.980
They just let me go with a warning, every single time.

00:24.980 --> 00:28.400
Or Adrienne, called the police when I lost the key to my bike lock.

00:28.400 --> 00:32.540
Eight firefighters showed up, didn't ask for any ID, proof that the bike was mine,

00:32.540 --> 00:36.760
or proof that I lived at that address, and cut the u-lock off without question.

00:36.760 --> 00:41.100
Or Audrey, police raided my house looking for my black boyfriend, just found me in my

00:41.100 --> 00:42.720
weed, tried to get me to put it on him.

00:42.720 --> 00:44.600
I got drug court and no record.

00:44.600 --> 00:45.760
He'd still be in prison.

00:45.760 --> 00:47.100
Or how about Charlotte?

00:47.100 --> 00:51.780
Every six months, over the last ten years living here in DC, I get cop cars that pull

00:51.780 --> 00:55.700
up to me while I'm walking around at night, to remind me that it's an unsafe neighborhood,

00:55.700 --> 00:58.100
it's not, and to ask if I need a ride.

00:58.100 --> 01:00.880
Do you notice what all of these people have in common?

01:00.880 --> 01:03.400
They're white, sure, but they're also women.

01:03.400 --> 01:07.820
And in fact, the majority of the officially chosen tweets for this Twitter moment contain

01:07.820 --> 01:13.060
anecdotes about women experiencing white privilege, when it really seems a bit more like female

01:13.060 --> 01:14.340
privilege to me.

01:14.340 --> 01:18.400
Do you think if a man were caught shoplifting, he'd be let go with a warning the way that

01:18.400 --> 01:19.500
Anne was?

01:19.500 --> 01:20.500
Probably not.

01:20.500 --> 01:23.820
Do you think police pull up to men walking around at night, and ask if they need a ride

01:23.820 --> 01:25.420
home like they did to Charlotte?

01:25.420 --> 01:26.580
Again, probably not.

01:26.580 --> 01:30.140
It would seem to me that not everything is about race all the time.

01:30.140 --> 01:34.860
Of course, there were more people shitposting on the hashtag than there were serious posters.

01:34.860 --> 01:38.700
But no matter how popular they got, none of them made it into the moments list.

01:38.700 --> 01:41.580
By the way, shout out to my friend Dragonfat Deposits for this one.

01:41.580 --> 01:44.200
My white privilege is knowing who my father is.

01:44.200 --> 01:47.060
My white privilege is being conceived within marriage.

01:47.060 --> 01:50.300
My white privilege is actually finishing high school.

01:50.300 --> 01:53.680
Damn, I guess it was too spicy for the official page.

01:53.680 --> 01:58.280
But even as the majority of the Twitterverse shat all over this ridiculous trend of a hashtag,

01:58.280 --> 02:01.320
journalists took it seriously, as they always do.

02:01.320 --> 02:05.660
Every trending hashtag now reflects a shift in the zeitgeist, a new dopamine hit, another

02:05.660 --> 02:09.580
opportunity to virtue signal to the entire world, white people are acknowledging their

02:09.580 --> 02:12.660
privilege on Twitter, but for what purpose?

02:12.660 --> 02:14.220
For no purpose, Slate.

02:14.220 --> 02:19.080
Most people didn't take the hashtag seriously, and those that did, did so only to look better

02:19.080 --> 02:20.080
to their peers.

02:20.080 --> 02:21.080
That's it.

02:21.080 --> 02:23.400
It's not the beginning of a social movement or some shit.

02:23.400 --> 02:25.160
Their activism is not real.

02:25.160 --> 02:28.840
But let's actually talk about the concept of privilege for a little bit.

02:28.840 --> 02:33.160
The intersectional feminists believed in strict dichotomies, and it's no wonder why.

02:33.160 --> 02:37.500
It goes along with the postmodernist framework of all human interaction being power struggles,

02:37.500 --> 02:39.660
and all hierarchies being entirely corrupt.

02:39.660 --> 02:41.760
To them, things are quite cut and dry.

02:41.760 --> 02:43.340
Men are on top, women are on the bottom.

02:43.340 --> 02:45.800
White people are on top, black people are on the bottom.

02:45.800 --> 02:49.720
Straights are on top, gays on the bottom, cis on top, trans on bottom.

02:49.720 --> 02:53.960
It's very simple, very clear-cut, and it makes it very easy to publicly declare what

02:53.960 --> 02:57.400
type of privilege you benefit from, and what type of oppression is holding you back.

02:57.400 --> 02:59.640
The only problem is, it's not true.

02:59.640 --> 03:00.960
Not completely, anyway.

03:00.960 --> 03:04.480
For example, I think you can make a very strong argument that trans people face problems that

03:04.480 --> 03:09.500
cis people don't, ranging from cultural acceptance to self-acceptance to unique health issues.

03:09.500 --> 03:11.240
I don't think that's a controversial statement.

03:11.240 --> 03:15.780
But that does not mean that in every single situation, no matter what, a cis person has

03:15.780 --> 03:17.340
it better than a trans person.

03:17.340 --> 03:21.620
Nor does it justify some kind of top-down scheme enforced by state power to level that

03:21.620 --> 03:25.920
particular playing field, beyond securing the human rights of the trans people, obviously.

03:25.920 --> 03:29.240
But when you get to race, white and black, it's not so clear-cut.

03:29.240 --> 03:33.060
Nobody's going to deny that, for example, America still has some problems regarding

03:33.060 --> 03:34.060
black people.

03:34.060 --> 03:36.700
But are you really going to claim that white privilege is universal?

03:36.700 --> 03:37.780
What about in China?

03:37.780 --> 03:39.400
What about in South Africa?

03:39.400 --> 03:42.900
Even if white privilege is a thing in the States, there are certainly locations where

03:42.900 --> 03:46.640
you'd be significantly more at risk as a white person than a black one.

03:46.640 --> 03:50.280
And then, when you get to men and women, the whole idea just falls apart, doesn't it?

03:50.280 --> 03:53.660
The concept of male privilege has been ridiculous for a while now.

03:53.660 --> 03:57.320
For example, it wasn't a privilege that men could go and work while women had to stay

03:57.320 --> 03:58.320
at home.

03:58.320 --> 03:59.320
It was a necessity.

03:59.320 --> 04:02.580
Someone within the family unit had to go out into the world, contend with it, and bring

04:02.580 --> 04:04.340
back what was required to survive.

04:04.340 --> 04:06.240
And it wasn't a good time doing so.

04:06.240 --> 04:07.580
The world's a rough place.

04:07.580 --> 04:11.180
Rather than the social justice concept of the privilege-oppression dichotomy, it's

04:11.180 --> 04:15.460
probably more accurate that each group has specific privileges unique to them, and that

04:15.460 --> 04:20.220
these privileges overlap and weave together in order to eventually create the individual,

04:20.220 --> 04:22.540
with their individual benefits and problems.

04:22.540 --> 04:26.540
For example, take the statement, women generally aren't treated as seriously as men.

04:26.540 --> 04:28.620
In my opinion, the statement's probably true.

04:28.620 --> 04:33.760
And in a workplace situation, where a woman's idea or criticism may be taken less seriously,

04:33.760 --> 04:35.260
that would be a form of oppression.

04:35.260 --> 04:39.380
However, in a situation where a woman has committed a crime or crossed the line somehow,

04:39.380 --> 04:44.920
like say all of those hashtag my white privilege examples, and gotten off without punishment,

04:44.920 --> 04:49.520
it would seem to me that in that case, not being treated seriously would be a privilege,

04:49.520 --> 04:50.520
not an oppression.

04:50.520 --> 04:52.260
A female privilege, in fact.

04:52.260 --> 04:56.020
This is why I think it's a set of privileges, not just privilege.

04:56.020 --> 04:57.820
Male privilege and female privilege.

04:57.820 --> 04:59.640
White privilege and black privilege.

04:59.640 --> 05:04.180
And millions of other privileges, existing simultaneously, overlapping, contradicting

05:04.180 --> 05:07.860
each other, shifting in and out of play as your environment changes.

05:07.860 --> 05:09.020
Everyone has them.

05:09.020 --> 05:10.160
Everyone benefits from them.

05:10.160 --> 05:12.580
This also means that everyone's a victim, too.

05:12.580 --> 05:15.060
Yes, even the fucking white males.

05:15.060 --> 05:18.080
However, progressives don't like the idea of privileges.

05:18.080 --> 05:19.200
They want their dichotomy.

05:19.200 --> 05:20.600
They want privilege and oppression.

05:20.600 --> 05:23.900
They want their overly simplified oppressor detection system.

05:23.900 --> 05:29.040
That's why to them, female privilege is just benevolent sexism, or male oppression is just

05:29.040 --> 05:30.440
toxic masculinity.

05:30.440 --> 05:34.560
Anything systemic that benefits an oppressed class has to be repurposed to reinforce the

05:34.560 --> 05:36.920
victimhood status of the victim classes.

05:36.920 --> 05:41.680
Even if this means that individual members of those victim classes become even more victimized.

05:41.680 --> 05:43.320
Here's an example of what I mean.

05:43.320 --> 05:47.240
Look at David Lemmy's outrageous comments regarding Western relief efforts in Africa.

05:47.240 --> 05:49.400
The world does not need any more white saviors.

05:49.400 --> 05:53.200
As I've said before, this just perpetuates tired and unhelpful stereotypes.

05:53.200 --> 05:56.920
Let's instead promote voices from across the continent of Africa and have serious debate.

05:56.920 --> 06:00.920
David Lemmy is a Labour MP in the UK, who seems to have made quite the career off of

06:00.920 --> 06:02.440
being black in politics.

06:02.440 --> 06:08.360
However, if other, more victimized black people than him become more empowered over time,

06:08.360 --> 06:10.920
people like David Lemmy will find themselves out of a job.

06:10.920 --> 06:12.200
So what does he do?

06:12.200 --> 06:16.240
Claim that Western aid to Africa is just the product of the white savior.

06:16.240 --> 06:17.880
Keep Africans victimized.

06:17.880 --> 06:19.400
Keep David Lemmy employed.

06:19.400 --> 06:21.480
There's a good re-election slogan you fat fuck.

06:21.480 --> 06:25.800
I bet a dozen African school children could live off your body for a month, you disgusting

06:25.800 --> 06:26.800
milk sop.

06:26.800 --> 06:28.600
It seems like I've gone off on a tangent.

06:28.600 --> 06:32.920
My point is, when hashtags like my white privilege come up, it's almost always the

06:32.920 --> 06:37.120
case that the contents within aren't solely about white privilege, and anybody who talks

06:37.120 --> 06:41.640
solely about white privilege, or male privilege, or even female or black privilege for that

06:41.640 --> 06:43.600
matter, they've all got blinders on.

06:43.600 --> 06:46.920
They're missing the big picture, generally purposely because they've got some skin in

06:46.920 --> 06:48.200
the cultural game.

06:48.200 --> 06:51.460
What the intersectional feminists have yet to figure out is that when you fractionate

06:51.460 --> 06:56.360
people by group alignment enough, you eventually arrive at a group of one, the individual,

06:56.360 --> 07:00.080
which is why the supremacy of the individual over the supremacy of any fractionated group

07:00.080 --> 07:03.720
is always going to be a more liberating solution to any of these problems.

07:03.720 --> 07:07.400
While I was recording this video, another forcibly trending hashtag popped up.

07:07.400 --> 07:08.840
This one's Equal Pay Day.

07:08.840 --> 07:10.840
Wait, isn't Equal Pay Day in October?

07:10.840 --> 07:14.260
Yeah, the whole point of Equal Pay Day is to supposedly highlight the day that a woman

07:14.260 --> 07:17.480
stops getting paid for the year's work, as a way to illustrate the gap.

07:17.480 --> 07:19.000
Why is it happening on April 2nd?

07:19.000 --> 07:20.000
Whatever.

07:20.000 --> 07:22.200
It goes into the same trash bin as my white privilege.

07:22.200 --> 07:25.780
Everybody go grab Shu An-head, tell her to hammer on that button of hers, because the

07:25.780 --> 07:29.420
gender pay gap doesn't account for all the variables, and more people are recognizing

07:29.420 --> 07:31.000
that fact as time goes on.

07:31.000 --> 07:34.500
At the beginning of this video, I pointed out the postmodernist view that all human

07:34.500 --> 07:36.380
interaction being a power struggle.

07:36.380 --> 07:39.800
You need to remember this fact when interacting with social justice warriors during these

07:39.800 --> 07:41.380
idiotic trending hashtags.

07:41.380 --> 07:45.460
They only bring up white privilege, or male privilege, or whatever the fuck, when it suits

07:45.460 --> 07:46.880
their narrative.

07:46.880 --> 07:52.140
Things like benevolent sexism or white supremacy backfiring against the oppressor exist only

07:52.140 --> 07:56.220
to reinforce their narrative, to cover up obvious gaps in their ideology.

07:56.220 --> 07:57.220
Think about it.

07:57.220 --> 08:01.040
If they view everything as a power struggle, then every move they make is a power play.

08:01.040 --> 08:02.860
Is it an instance where a woman's oppressed?

08:02.860 --> 08:07.020
It's sexism, but more importantly, it's an opportunity to consolidate a little more power.

08:07.020 --> 08:08.980
Is it an instance where a man is oppressed?

08:08.980 --> 08:13.540
It's the patriarchy backfiring against men, but more importantly, consolidate more power.

08:13.540 --> 08:15.060
That's all this nonsense is.

08:15.060 --> 08:18.700
Power moves by people who are convinced that everything is about power.

08:18.700 --> 08:22.900
At the same time, for everything to be just power plays underneath all the wrapping paper,

08:22.900 --> 08:26.900
there has to be some understanding that a series of privileges, rather than strict privilege

08:26.900 --> 08:30.580
and oppressed dichotomies, is the proper way to conceptualize the situation.

08:30.580 --> 08:31.580
Really, think about it.

08:31.580 --> 08:37.360
The oppressed class claims it's oppressed as a way to leverage a sort of victim privilege,

08:37.360 --> 08:38.620
as strange as that sounds.

08:38.620 --> 08:43.540
A power game is, by definition, two groups with differing privileges clashing their privileges

08:43.540 --> 08:45.940
together in order to see who comes out on top.

08:45.940 --> 08:50.780
If you can leverage victim privilege, then claiming you're oppressed is a tactic in the fight.

08:50.780 --> 08:55.300
In other words, even as social justice warriors talk about the privilege-oppression dichotomy,

08:55.300 --> 08:58.540
they act as if it's actually a battle between two privileged groups.

08:58.540 --> 09:01.400
Maybe this is a bit hard to follow, I don't know if I'm explaining it quite right.

09:01.400 --> 09:05.380
But I think this tweet can illustrate what I mean better than I ever could.

09:05.380 --> 09:07.020
Y'all can have my white privilege.

09:07.020 --> 09:11.220
This a racist-ass country, but I wouldn't want to be anything but black.

09:11.220 --> 09:12.660
Y'all will never have that privilege.

09:12.660 --> 09:15.380
Shout out to all my black kings and queens out there.

09:15.380 --> 09:19.380
If there's nothing but oppression in being black, why would you exclaim that, even if

09:19.380 --> 09:21.620
you could change your race, you'd refuse to?

09:21.620 --> 09:25.660
Why would you say that y'all will never have the privilege of being black, if there's no

09:25.660 --> 09:26.700
privilege in it?

09:26.700 --> 09:30.340
I know some trans people who would say if they could snap their fingers and be cis and

09:30.340 --> 09:32.900
save themselves all the trauma, they'd do so.

09:32.900 --> 09:35.060
I know a lot of gay people who would say the same thing.

09:35.060 --> 09:39.260
It appears as if, at least insofar as this person is concerned, black people wouldn't

09:39.260 --> 09:40.260
make that trade.

09:40.260 --> 09:42.700
And I'm pretty sure women wouldn't either.

09:42.700 --> 09:44.780
So you tell me, intersectionalists.

09:44.780 --> 09:48.940
Is it a dichotomy of the privileged and oppressed, or is it a power struggle?

09:48.940 --> 09:51.980
Because in the end, it can't be both.

09:51.980 --> 09:58.760
We white Americans need to do a better job of listening when African Americans talk about

09:58.760 --> 10:03.420
the seen and unseen barriers you face every day.

10:03.420 --> 10:08.340
We need to recognize our privilege and practice humility.
