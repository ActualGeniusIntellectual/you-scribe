0	2860	Ah yes, my white privilege.
2860	7040	People are recounting the outrageous things they've gotten away with because of hashtag
7040	8040	my white privilege.
8040	9240	Oh are they?
9240	13000	This was a trending moment a few days ago, and the moment contains a few testimonials
13000	16920	from white people convinced that their situation is due to their white privilege.
16920	21600	Like Anne here, I got caught stealing multiple times as a teenager, and they never called
21600	22600	the cops.
22600	24980	They just let me go with a warning, every single time.
24980	28400	Or Adrienne, called the police when I lost the key to my bike lock.
28400	32540	Eight firefighters showed up, didn't ask for any ID, proof that the bike was mine,
32540	36760	or proof that I lived at that address, and cut the u-lock off without question.
36760	41100	Or Audrey, police raided my house looking for my black boyfriend, just found me in my
41100	42720	weed, tried to get me to put it on him.
42720	44600	I got drug court and no record.
44600	45760	He'd still be in prison.
45760	47100	Or how about Charlotte?
47100	51780	Every six months, over the last ten years living here in DC, I get cop cars that pull
51780	55700	up to me while I'm walking around at night, to remind me that it's an unsafe neighborhood,
55700	58100	it's not, and to ask if I need a ride.
58100	60880	Do you notice what all of these people have in common?
60880	63400	They're white, sure, but they're also women.
63400	67820	And in fact, the majority of the officially chosen tweets for this Twitter moment contain
67820	73060	anecdotes about women experiencing white privilege, when it really seems a bit more like female
73060	74340	privilege to me.
74340	78400	Do you think if a man were caught shoplifting, he'd be let go with a warning the way that
78400	79500	Anne was?
79500	80500	Probably not.
80500	83820	Do you think police pull up to men walking around at night, and ask if they need a ride
83820	85420	home like they did to Charlotte?
85420	86580	Again, probably not.
86580	90140	It would seem to me that not everything is about race all the time.
90140	94860	Of course, there were more people shitposting on the hashtag than there were serious posters.
94860	98700	But no matter how popular they got, none of them made it into the moments list.
98700	101580	By the way, shout out to my friend Dragonfat Deposits for this one.
101580	104200	My white privilege is knowing who my father is.
104200	107060	My white privilege is being conceived within marriage.
107060	110300	My white privilege is actually finishing high school.
110300	113680	Damn, I guess it was too spicy for the official page.
113680	118280	But even as the majority of the Twitterverse shat all over this ridiculous trend of a hashtag,
118280	121320	journalists took it seriously, as they always do.
121320	125660	Every trending hashtag now reflects a shift in the zeitgeist, a new dopamine hit, another
125660	129580	opportunity to virtue signal to the entire world, white people are acknowledging their
129580	132660	privilege on Twitter, but for what purpose?
132660	134220	For no purpose, Slate.
134220	139080	Most people didn't take the hashtag seriously, and those that did, did so only to look better
139080	140080	to their peers.
140080	141080	That's it.
141080	143400	It's not the beginning of a social movement or some shit.
143400	145160	Their activism is not real.
145160	148840	But let's actually talk about the concept of privilege for a little bit.
148840	153160	The intersectional feminists believed in strict dichotomies, and it's no wonder why.
153160	157500	It goes along with the postmodernist framework of all human interaction being power struggles,
157500	159660	and all hierarchies being entirely corrupt.
159660	161760	To them, things are quite cut and dry.
161760	163340	Men are on top, women are on the bottom.
163340	165800	White people are on top, black people are on the bottom.
165800	169720	Straights are on top, gays on the bottom, cis on top, trans on bottom.
169720	173960	It's very simple, very clear-cut, and it makes it very easy to publicly declare what
173960	177400	type of privilege you benefit from, and what type of oppression is holding you back.
177400	179640	The only problem is, it's not true.
179640	180960	Not completely, anyway.
180960	184480	For example, I think you can make a very strong argument that trans people face problems that
184480	189500	cis people don't, ranging from cultural acceptance to self-acceptance to unique health issues.
189500	191240	I don't think that's a controversial statement.
191240	195780	But that does not mean that in every single situation, no matter what, a cis person has
195780	197340	it better than a trans person.
197340	201620	Nor does it justify some kind of top-down scheme enforced by state power to level that
201620	205920	particular playing field, beyond securing the human rights of the trans people, obviously.
205920	209240	But when you get to race, white and black, it's not so clear-cut.
209240	213060	Nobody's going to deny that, for example, America still has some problems regarding
213060	214060	black people.
214060	216700	But are you really going to claim that white privilege is universal?
216700	217780	What about in China?
217780	219400	What about in South Africa?
219400	222900	Even if white privilege is a thing in the States, there are certainly locations where
222900	226640	you'd be significantly more at risk as a white person than a black one.
226640	230280	And then, when you get to men and women, the whole idea just falls apart, doesn't it?
230280	233660	The concept of male privilege has been ridiculous for a while now.
233660	237320	For example, it wasn't a privilege that men could go and work while women had to stay
237320	238320	at home.
238320	239320	It was a necessity.
239320	242580	Someone within the family unit had to go out into the world, contend with it, and bring
242580	244340	back what was required to survive.
244340	246240	And it wasn't a good time doing so.
246240	247580	The world's a rough place.
247580	251180	Rather than the social justice concept of the privilege-oppression dichotomy, it's
251180	255460	probably more accurate that each group has specific privileges unique to them, and that
255460	260220	these privileges overlap and weave together in order to eventually create the individual,
260220	262540	with their individual benefits and problems.
262540	266540	For example, take the statement, women generally aren't treated as seriously as men.
266540	268620	In my opinion, the statement's probably true.
268620	273760	And in a workplace situation, where a woman's idea or criticism may be taken less seriously,
273760	275260	that would be a form of oppression.
275260	279380	However, in a situation where a woman has committed a crime or crossed the line somehow,
279380	284920	like say all of those hashtag my white privilege examples, and gotten off without punishment,
284920	289520	it would seem to me that in that case, not being treated seriously would be a privilege,
289520	290520	not an oppression.
290520	292260	A female privilege, in fact.
292260	296020	This is why I think it's a set of privileges, not just privilege.
296020	297820	Male privilege and female privilege.
297820	299640	White privilege and black privilege.
299640	304180	And millions of other privileges, existing simultaneously, overlapping, contradicting
304180	307860	each other, shifting in and out of play as your environment changes.
307860	309020	Everyone has them.
309020	310160	Everyone benefits from them.
310160	312580	This also means that everyone's a victim, too.
312580	315060	Yes, even the fucking white males.
315060	318080	However, progressives don't like the idea of privileges.
318080	319200	They want their dichotomy.
319200	320600	They want privilege and oppression.
320600	323900	They want their overly simplified oppressor detection system.
323900	329040	That's why to them, female privilege is just benevolent sexism, or male oppression is just
329040	330440	toxic masculinity.
330440	334560	Anything systemic that benefits an oppressed class has to be repurposed to reinforce the
334560	336920	victimhood status of the victim classes.
336920	341680	Even if this means that individual members of those victim classes become even more victimized.
341680	343320	Here's an example of what I mean.
343320	347240	Look at David Lemmy's outrageous comments regarding Western relief efforts in Africa.
347240	349400	The world does not need any more white saviors.
349400	353200	As I've said before, this just perpetuates tired and unhelpful stereotypes.
353200	356920	Let's instead promote voices from across the continent of Africa and have serious debate.
356920	360920	David Lemmy is a Labour MP in the UK, who seems to have made quite the career off of
360920	362440	being black in politics.
362440	368360	However, if other, more victimized black people than him become more empowered over time,
368360	370920	people like David Lemmy will find themselves out of a job.
370920	372200	So what does he do?
372200	376240	Claim that Western aid to Africa is just the product of the white savior.
376240	377880	Keep Africans victimized.
377880	379400	Keep David Lemmy employed.
379400	381480	There's a good re-election slogan you fat fuck.
381480	385800	I bet a dozen African school children could live off your body for a month, you disgusting
385800	386800	milk sop.
386800	388600	It seems like I've gone off on a tangent.
388600	392920	My point is, when hashtags like my white privilege come up, it's almost always the
392920	397120	case that the contents within aren't solely about white privilege, and anybody who talks
397120	401640	solely about white privilege, or male privilege, or even female or black privilege for that
401640	403600	matter, they've all got blinders on.
403600	406920	They're missing the big picture, generally purposely because they've got some skin in
406920	408200	the cultural game.
408200	411460	What the intersectional feminists have yet to figure out is that when you fractionate
411460	416360	people by group alignment enough, you eventually arrive at a group of one, the individual,
416360	420080	which is why the supremacy of the individual over the supremacy of any fractionated group
420080	423720	is always going to be a more liberating solution to any of these problems.
423720	427400	While I was recording this video, another forcibly trending hashtag popped up.
427400	428840	This one's Equal Pay Day.
428840	430840	Wait, isn't Equal Pay Day in October?
430840	434260	Yeah, the whole point of Equal Pay Day is to supposedly highlight the day that a woman
434260	437480	stops getting paid for the year's work, as a way to illustrate the gap.
437480	439000	Why is it happening on April 2nd?
439000	440000	Whatever.
440000	442200	It goes into the same trash bin as my white privilege.
442200	445780	Everybody go grab Shu An-head, tell her to hammer on that button of hers, because the
445780	449420	gender pay gap doesn't account for all the variables, and more people are recognizing
449420	451000	that fact as time goes on.
451000	454500	At the beginning of this video, I pointed out the postmodernist view that all human
454500	456380	interaction being a power struggle.
456380	459800	You need to remember this fact when interacting with social justice warriors during these
459800	461380	idiotic trending hashtags.
461380	465460	They only bring up white privilege, or male privilege, or whatever the fuck, when it suits
465460	466880	their narrative.
466880	472140	Things like benevolent sexism or white supremacy backfiring against the oppressor exist only
472140	476220	to reinforce their narrative, to cover up obvious gaps in their ideology.
476220	477220	Think about it.
477220	481040	If they view everything as a power struggle, then every move they make is a power play.
481040	482860	Is it an instance where a woman's oppressed?
482860	487020	It's sexism, but more importantly, it's an opportunity to consolidate a little more power.
487020	488980	Is it an instance where a man is oppressed?
488980	493540	It's the patriarchy backfiring against men, but more importantly, consolidate more power.
493540	495060	That's all this nonsense is.
495060	498700	Power moves by people who are convinced that everything is about power.
498700	502900	At the same time, for everything to be just power plays underneath all the wrapping paper,
502900	506900	there has to be some understanding that a series of privileges, rather than strict privilege
506900	510580	and oppressed dichotomies, is the proper way to conceptualize the situation.
510580	511580	Really, think about it.
511580	517360	The oppressed class claims it's oppressed as a way to leverage a sort of victim privilege,
517360	518620	as strange as that sounds.
518620	523540	A power game is, by definition, two groups with differing privileges clashing their privileges
523540	525940	together in order to see who comes out on top.
525940	530780	If you can leverage victim privilege, then claiming you're oppressed is a tactic in the fight.
530780	535300	In other words, even as social justice warriors talk about the privilege-oppression dichotomy,
535300	538540	they act as if it's actually a battle between two privileged groups.
538540	541400	Maybe this is a bit hard to follow, I don't know if I'm explaining it quite right.
541400	545380	But I think this tweet can illustrate what I mean better than I ever could.
545380	547020	Y'all can have my white privilege.
547020	551220	This a racist-ass country, but I wouldn't want to be anything but black.
551220	552660	Y'all will never have that privilege.
552660	555380	Shout out to all my black kings and queens out there.
555380	559380	If there's nothing but oppression in being black, why would you exclaim that, even if
559380	561620	you could change your race, you'd refuse to?
561620	565660	Why would you say that y'all will never have the privilege of being black, if there's no
565660	566700	privilege in it?
566700	570340	I know some trans people who would say if they could snap their fingers and be cis and
570340	572900	save themselves all the trauma, they'd do so.
572900	575060	I know a lot of gay people who would say the same thing.
575060	579260	It appears as if, at least insofar as this person is concerned, black people wouldn't
579260	580260	make that trade.
580260	582700	And I'm pretty sure women wouldn't either.
582700	584780	So you tell me, intersectionalists.
584780	588940	Is it a dichotomy of the privileged and oppressed, or is it a power struggle?
588940	591980	Because in the end, it can't be both.
591980	598760	We white Americans need to do a better job of listening when African Americans talk about
598760	603420	the seen and unseen barriers you face every day.
603420	608340	We need to recognize our privilege and practice humility.
