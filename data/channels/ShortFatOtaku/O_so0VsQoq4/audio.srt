1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,860
Ah yes, my white privilege.

2
00:00:02,860 --> 00:00:07,040
People are recounting the outrageous things they've gotten away with because of hashtag

3
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:08,040
my white privilege.

4
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:09,240
Oh are they?

5
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:13,000
This was a trending moment a few days ago, and the moment contains a few testimonials

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,920
from white people convinced that their situation is due to their white privilege.

7
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:21,600
Like Anne here, I got caught stealing multiple times as a teenager, and they never called

8
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:22,600
the cops.

9
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:24,980
They just let me go with a warning, every single time.

10
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:28,400
Or Adrienne, called the police when I lost the key to my bike lock.

11
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:32,540
Eight firefighters showed up, didn't ask for any ID, proof that the bike was mine,

12
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:36,760
or proof that I lived at that address, and cut the u-lock off without question.

13
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:41,100
Or Audrey, police raided my house looking for my black boyfriend, just found me in my

14
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:42,720
weed, tried to get me to put it on him.

15
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:44,600
I got drug court and no record.

16
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:45,760
He'd still be in prison.

17
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:47,100
Or how about Charlotte?

18
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:51,780
Every six months, over the last ten years living here in DC, I get cop cars that pull

19
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:55,700
up to me while I'm walking around at night, to remind me that it's an unsafe neighborhood,

20
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:58,100
it's not, and to ask if I need a ride.

21
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:00,880
Do you notice what all of these people have in common?

22
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:03,400
They're white, sure, but they're also women.

23
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:07,820
And in fact, the majority of the officially chosen tweets for this Twitter moment contain

24
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:13,060
anecdotes about women experiencing white privilege, when it really seems a bit more like female

25
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:14,340
privilege to me.

26
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:18,400
Do you think if a man were caught shoplifting, he'd be let go with a warning the way that

27
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:19,500
Anne was?

28
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:20,500
Probably not.

29
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:23,820
Do you think police pull up to men walking around at night, and ask if they need a ride

30
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:25,420
home like they did to Charlotte?

31
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:26,580
Again, probably not.

32
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:30,140
It would seem to me that not everything is about race all the time.

33
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:34,860
Of course, there were more people shitposting on the hashtag than there were serious posters.

34
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:38,700
But no matter how popular they got, none of them made it into the moments list.

35
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:41,580
By the way, shout out to my friend Dragonfat Deposits for this one.

36
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:44,200
My white privilege is knowing who my father is.

37
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:47,060
My white privilege is being conceived within marriage.

38
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:50,300
My white privilege is actually finishing high school.

39
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:53,680
Damn, I guess it was too spicy for the official page.

40
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:58,280
But even as the majority of the Twitterverse shat all over this ridiculous trend of a hashtag,

41
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:01,320
journalists took it seriously, as they always do.

42
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:05,660
Every trending hashtag now reflects a shift in the zeitgeist, a new dopamine hit, another

43
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:09,580
opportunity to virtue signal to the entire world, white people are acknowledging their

44
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:12,660
privilege on Twitter, but for what purpose?

45
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:14,220
For no purpose, Slate.

46
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:19,080
Most people didn't take the hashtag seriously, and those that did, did so only to look better

47
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:20,080
to their peers.

48
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,080
That's it.

49
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:23,400
It's not the beginning of a social movement or some shit.

50
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,160
Their activism is not real.

51
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:28,840
But let's actually talk about the concept of privilege for a little bit.

52
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:33,160
The intersectional feminists believed in strict dichotomies, and it's no wonder why.

53
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:37,500
It goes along with the postmodernist framework of all human interaction being power struggles,

54
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:39,660
and all hierarchies being entirely corrupt.

55
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:41,760
To them, things are quite cut and dry.

56
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,340
Men are on top, women are on the bottom.

57
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:45,800
White people are on top, black people are on the bottom.

58
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:49,720
Straights are on top, gays on the bottom, cis on top, trans on bottom.

59
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:53,960
It's very simple, very clear-cut, and it makes it very easy to publicly declare what

60
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:57,400
type of privilege you benefit from, and what type of oppression is holding you back.

61
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:59,640
The only problem is, it's not true.

62
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:00,960
Not completely, anyway.

63
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:04,480
For example, I think you can make a very strong argument that trans people face problems that

64
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:09,500
cis people don't, ranging from cultural acceptance to self-acceptance to unique health issues.

65
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:11,240
I don't think that's a controversial statement.

66
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:15,780
But that does not mean that in every single situation, no matter what, a cis person has

67
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:17,340
it better than a trans person.

68
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:21,620
Nor does it justify some kind of top-down scheme enforced by state power to level that

69
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:25,920
particular playing field, beyond securing the human rights of the trans people, obviously.

70
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:29,240
But when you get to race, white and black, it's not so clear-cut.

71
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:33,060
Nobody's going to deny that, for example, America still has some problems regarding

72
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:34,060
black people.

73
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:36,700
But are you really going to claim that white privilege is universal?

74
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:37,780
What about in China?

75
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:39,400
What about in South Africa?

76
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:42,900
Even if white privilege is a thing in the States, there are certainly locations where

77
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:46,640
you'd be significantly more at risk as a white person than a black one.

78
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:50,280
And then, when you get to men and women, the whole idea just falls apart, doesn't it?

79
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:53,660
The concept of male privilege has been ridiculous for a while now.

80
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:57,320
For example, it wasn't a privilege that men could go and work while women had to stay

81
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,320
at home.

82
00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:59,320
It was a necessity.

83
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:02,580
Someone within the family unit had to go out into the world, contend with it, and bring

84
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:04,340
back what was required to survive.

85
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:06,240
And it wasn't a good time doing so.

86
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,580
The world's a rough place.

87
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:11,180
Rather than the social justice concept of the privilege-oppression dichotomy, it's

88
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:15,460
probably more accurate that each group has specific privileges unique to them, and that

89
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:20,220
these privileges overlap and weave together in order to eventually create the individual,

90
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:22,540
with their individual benefits and problems.

91
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:26,540
For example, take the statement, women generally aren't treated as seriously as men.

92
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:28,620
In my opinion, the statement's probably true.

93
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:33,760
And in a workplace situation, where a woman's idea or criticism may be taken less seriously,

94
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:35,260
that would be a form of oppression.

95
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:39,380
However, in a situation where a woman has committed a crime or crossed the line somehow,

96
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:44,920
like say all of those hashtag my white privilege examples, and gotten off without punishment,

97
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:49,520
it would seem to me that in that case, not being treated seriously would be a privilege,

98
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:50,520
not an oppression.

99
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:52,260
A female privilege, in fact.

100
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:56,020
This is why I think it's a set of privileges, not just privilege.

101
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:57,820
Male privilege and female privilege.

102
00:04:57,820 --> 00:04:59,640
White privilege and black privilege.

103
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:04,180
And millions of other privileges, existing simultaneously, overlapping, contradicting

104
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:07,860
each other, shifting in and out of play as your environment changes.

105
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:09,020
Everyone has them.

106
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:10,160
Everyone benefits from them.

107
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,580
This also means that everyone's a victim, too.

108
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:15,060
Yes, even the fucking white males.

109
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:18,080
However, progressives don't like the idea of privileges.

110
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,200
They want their dichotomy.

111
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:20,600
They want privilege and oppression.

112
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:23,900
They want their overly simplified oppressor detection system.

113
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:29,040
That's why to them, female privilege is just benevolent sexism, or male oppression is just

114
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,440
toxic masculinity.

115
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:34,560
Anything systemic that benefits an oppressed class has to be repurposed to reinforce the

116
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,920
victimhood status of the victim classes.

117
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:41,680
Even if this means that individual members of those victim classes become even more victimized.

118
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,320
Here's an example of what I mean.

119
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:47,240
Look at David Lemmy's outrageous comments regarding Western relief efforts in Africa.

120
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:49,400
The world does not need any more white saviors.

121
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:53,200
As I've said before, this just perpetuates tired and unhelpful stereotypes.

122
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:56,920
Let's instead promote voices from across the continent of Africa and have serious debate.

123
00:05:56,920 --> 00:06:00,920
David Lemmy is a Labour MP in the UK, who seems to have made quite the career off of

124
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,440
being black in politics.

125
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:08,360
However, if other, more victimized black people than him become more empowered over time,

126
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:10,920
people like David Lemmy will find themselves out of a job.

127
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,200
So what does he do?

128
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:16,240
Claim that Western aid to Africa is just the product of the white savior.

129
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,880
Keep Africans victimized.

130
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:19,400
Keep David Lemmy employed.

131
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:21,480
There's a good re-election slogan you fat fuck.

132
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:25,800
I bet a dozen African school children could live off your body for a month, you disgusting

133
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:26,800
milk sop.

134
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,600
It seems like I've gone off on a tangent.

135
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:32,920
My point is, when hashtags like my white privilege come up, it's almost always the

136
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:37,120
case that the contents within aren't solely about white privilege, and anybody who talks

137
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:41,640
solely about white privilege, or male privilege, or even female or black privilege for that

138
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:43,600
matter, they've all got blinders on.

139
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:46,920
They're missing the big picture, generally purposely because they've got some skin in

140
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,200
the cultural game.

141
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:51,460
What the intersectional feminists have yet to figure out is that when you fractionate

142
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:56,360
people by group alignment enough, you eventually arrive at a group of one, the individual,

143
00:06:56,360 --> 00:07:00,080
which is why the supremacy of the individual over the supremacy of any fractionated group

144
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:03,720
is always going to be a more liberating solution to any of these problems.

145
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:07,400
While I was recording this video, another forcibly trending hashtag popped up.

146
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:08,840
This one's Equal Pay Day.

147
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:10,840
Wait, isn't Equal Pay Day in October?

148
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:14,260
Yeah, the whole point of Equal Pay Day is to supposedly highlight the day that a woman

149
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:17,480
stops getting paid for the year's work, as a way to illustrate the gap.

150
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:19,000
Why is it happening on April 2nd?

151
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Whatever.

152
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,200
It goes into the same trash bin as my white privilege.

153
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:25,780
Everybody go grab Shu An-head, tell her to hammer on that button of hers, because the

154
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:29,420
gender pay gap doesn't account for all the variables, and more people are recognizing

155
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:31,000
that fact as time goes on.

156
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,500
At the beginning of this video, I pointed out the postmodernist view that all human

157
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:36,380
interaction being a power struggle.

158
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:39,800
You need to remember this fact when interacting with social justice warriors during these

159
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,380
idiotic trending hashtags.

160
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:45,460
They only bring up white privilege, or male privilege, or whatever the fuck, when it suits

161
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:46,880
their narrative.

162
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:52,140
Things like benevolent sexism or white supremacy backfiring against the oppressor exist only

163
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:56,220
to reinforce their narrative, to cover up obvious gaps in their ideology.

164
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:57,220
Think about it.

165
00:07:57,220 --> 00:08:01,040
If they view everything as a power struggle, then every move they make is a power play.

166
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,860
Is it an instance where a woman's oppressed?

167
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:07,020
It's sexism, but more importantly, it's an opportunity to consolidate a little more power.

168
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:08,980
Is it an instance where a man is oppressed?

169
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:13,540
It's the patriarchy backfiring against men, but more importantly, consolidate more power.

170
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:15,060
That's all this nonsense is.

171
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:18,700
Power moves by people who are convinced that everything is about power.

172
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:22,900
At the same time, for everything to be just power plays underneath all the wrapping paper,

173
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:26,900
there has to be some understanding that a series of privileges, rather than strict privilege

174
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:30,580
and oppressed dichotomies, is the proper way to conceptualize the situation.

175
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:31,580
Really, think about it.

176
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:37,360
The oppressed class claims it's oppressed as a way to leverage a sort of victim privilege,

177
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,620
as strange as that sounds.

178
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:43,540
A power game is, by definition, two groups with differing privileges clashing their privileges

179
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:45,940
together in order to see who comes out on top.

180
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:50,780
If you can leverage victim privilege, then claiming you're oppressed is a tactic in the fight.

181
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:55,300
In other words, even as social justice warriors talk about the privilege-oppression dichotomy,

182
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:58,540
they act as if it's actually a battle between two privileged groups.

183
00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:01,400
Maybe this is a bit hard to follow, I don't know if I'm explaining it quite right.

184
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:05,380
But I think this tweet can illustrate what I mean better than I ever could.

185
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:07,020
Y'all can have my white privilege.

186
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:11,220
This a racist-ass country, but I wouldn't want to be anything but black.

187
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:12,660
Y'all will never have that privilege.

188
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:15,380
Shout out to all my black kings and queens out there.

189
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:19,380
If there's nothing but oppression in being black, why would you exclaim that, even if

190
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:21,620
you could change your race, you'd refuse to?

191
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:25,660
Why would you say that y'all will never have the privilege of being black, if there's no

192
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:26,700
privilege in it?

193
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:30,340
I know some trans people who would say if they could snap their fingers and be cis and

194
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:32,900
save themselves all the trauma, they'd do so.

195
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:35,060
I know a lot of gay people who would say the same thing.

196
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:39,260
It appears as if, at least insofar as this person is concerned, black people wouldn't

197
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:40,260
make that trade.

198
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:42,700
And I'm pretty sure women wouldn't either.

199
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:44,780
So you tell me, intersectionalists.

200
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:48,940
Is it a dichotomy of the privileged and oppressed, or is it a power struggle?

201
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:51,980
Because in the end, it can't be both.

202
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:58,760
We white Americans need to do a better job of listening when African Americans talk about

203
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:03,420
the seen and unseen barriers you face every day.

204
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:08,340
We need to recognize our privilege and practice humility.
