0	4000	Here, let's start the new year off right by wasting time on Twitter.
4000	8240	OniNG, somebody who I look up to quite a bit, posted this viral tweet yesterday.
8240	11360	I wanted to start my year good, but this was the first thing I saw today.
11360	13760	And this is a webcomic by somebody I've never heard of.
13760	15200	We can just very quickly go through it here.
16000	18720	Here's a purple-haired SJW laughing.
19680	21280	There's a new guy at the store.
21840	23120	Oh, what's so funny?
23120	26000	Hey, that millionaire gamer bro douchebag totally got robbed.
26960	29120	Hey, how'd you like it if you were robbed?
29120	32640	Oh wow, I can tell we're going to be the kind of co-workers who become good friends.
32640	33680	Wow, really?
33680	34320	Hell no.
34960	39280	And the whole point of these self-insert comics is they have their self-insert character parroting
39280	45520	their philosophy, and they pit that philosophy against various strawmans like, for example,
45520	47520	the bald new guy.
47520	51840	But Oni's tweeting of this comic went viral because apparently everyone's taking new guy's
51840	56000	side to the point that the words new guy have been trending on Twitter all day today.
56000	60480	In fact, Oni even remarked on this, saying that he woke up this morning and new guy is
60480	61600	now a trending meme.
61600	62240	Oops.
62240	67280	And I guess because of my good friend and co-host Lilith Lovett's involvement in propagating
67280	69920	of the meme, Oni has now decided to follow her back.
69920	71600	I have to say, I'm kind of jealous.
71600	73360	Lilith, you should get him to watch our show.
73360	77600	But yeah, new guy has become the latest hero, the first of 2020.
77600	81440	And of course, he's being replicated in various memes like the Virgin Chad template, which
81440	82640	is always hilarious.
82640	85360	But I think it's actually important to talk about what's going on with this comic here
85360	90960	because this seems to happen a lot with social justice comic creators, which frankly, a lot
90960	95360	of webcomics nowadays, they seem to be run or made by SJWs.
95360	100800	I wouldn't say that they always do this, but the lower you go down the quality rungs, the
100800	102320	more likely they are to do this.
102320	106400	They have a self-insert character, like I said, that argues with strawmans.
106400	109520	But the first question we can ask is, why is everyone siding with new guy?
109520	112800	I mean, it's kind of obvious if you really think about it for more than five seconds.
112800	118240	This is somebody taking glee in the fact that a millionaire gamer bro douchebag got robbed.
118240	124560	I assume this is in reference to PewDiePie and having his house broken into and Marzia's
124560	125920	jewelry getting stolen.
125920	128080	That happened, I think, a month or two months ago or whatever it was.
129600	134160	And she's taking glee in this because, you know, SJWs hate PewDiePie at this point because
134160	140480	he's not willing to self-censor or be apologetic enough for what they perceive to be his sins.
140480	144800	And the only thing that new guy does in this comic is, first of all, in the first panel,
144800	149120	he wants to join in what she's finding funny, hoping that it would be a positive experience.
149840	155200	He notices that it's, you know, probably not a good thing that she's just baselessly laughing
155200	157600	at a misfortune that befalls somebody.
157600	162240	And then he's happy about the fact that he thinks he's made a new friend.
162240	167920	In all four of these panels, the self-insert, the one that you're supposed to be siding
167920	170000	with, is the asshole.
170000	176640	And I think that the radical left right now has this weird identification with evil that
176640	178800	probably needs to be discussed at some point.
178800	180560	Maybe we can do it right now, in fact.
180560	184400	I mean, you must remember this from a little while ago, right, where they said that Pennywise
184400	188880	and the Babadook are said to be dating and they've become LGBTQ icons.
189440	194080	These are horrific supernatural creatures from it or whatever.
194080	195040	I didn't see it.
195040	195760	I don't really care.
195760	201200	But the point is, is that Pennywise, at the very least, I know a little bit about him.
201200	202080	He's not a good guy.
202080	207280	I mean, he's like a demonic clown entity, but I guess because he's being shipped with the
207280	212400	Babadook, all the horrible crimes he's committed, the fact that he is a personification of evil
212400	215760	itself doesn't matter because he's LGBTQ.
215760	222080	All that other stuff can be forgiven, you know, because he's one of the LGBTQ tribe.
222080	226720	And in fact, when this article came out and when this this was shortly a thing on the
226720	232480	Internet, there was definitely a lot of association with Pennywise and the Babadook by a lot of
232480	238080	individuals who just seemed to be, you know, my team right or wrong, my tribe, my group.
238080	243040	And you really have to imagine what kind of person views this drawing as as their ideal,
243040	244800	or at least as their mascot.
244800	250240	You know, you have these these horrific creatures who have done unspeakable things, but because
250240	253200	they're waving the LGBTQ flag, it's it's all right.
253200	255040	You know, they're they're on side now.
255040	260080	This whole thing moved beyond stupidity into something ideological when when it chapter
260080	263760	two came out two years later in September of 2019.
263760	270720	And it turns out that Pennywise was surprisingly anti-queer and that the killer clown wasn't
270720	272720	the ally they all thought he was.
272720	276960	You know, if you had your head on straight and didn't just think of things in terms of
276960	279600	ideology, you would have been able to notice this.
279600	284160	You would have been able to figure out that identifying with something that is evil just
284160	288400	because it is like you in some superficial way is probably not a good thing.
288400	292800	And yet mistaking solidarity for morality is something that the radicals on the left seem
292800	294960	to do as a matter of course.
294960	300160	For example, back when Untitled Goose Game was was the hot new thing, this tweet here
300160	304880	went viral where it had the the titular goose as a trans person, you know, having a little
304880	309600	bow in their hair and and holding a trans flag and says, anyways, goose is trans.
309600	313520	For those of you who don't know, Untitled Goose Game is a game where basically you play
313520	319040	as a goose and you steal the belongings of all these various members of this small town.
319040	321040	It's a it's a funny, silly little game.
321040	322640	It might last you an hour or two.
322640	323760	The music's great.
323760	325600	The graphical style is pretty adorable.
325600	328560	But the honest truth is you play the villain in this game.
329280	333920	Now, you're not a very serious villain because all you are is a goose causing mischief and
333920	338320	mayhem in this small hamlet by stealing people's stuff and running off with it and dumping
338320	342160	it in the lake or or stealing their hats or whatever it happens to be, because the point
342160	347440	of the game is is to cause relatively minor mishaps playing as basically a mischievous
347440	349360	spirit, you know, a trickster almost.
349360	353360	You might laugh while playing this game, but you probably shouldn't think that your actions
353360	354000	are heroic.
354000	355280	That's not the kind of game it is.
355280	357840	And yet goose is trans.
357840	362560	You could make the argument that goose isn't good, but it's more important that goose is
362560	363440	trans.
363440	366320	Now, maybe you're thinking I'm just pulling all this out of my ass and you know, maybe
366320	366800	I am.
366800	368880	But here's why I think that there's actually something to this.
368880	371040	When the Joker came out, we got articles like this.
371600	376480	Joker is a dangerous film and it's bringing out the worst in the Internet or why Joker
376480	380720	is sparking a backlash over its portrayal of incel violence.
380720	382000	Now, I like the Joker.
382000	384960	But to those of you who were really in love with this film, I hate to break it to you.
385600	387600	The Joker was a villain in that.
387600	387920	All right.
387920	389360	At least he certainly wasn't a hero.
389360	393200	That doesn't mean that the people that he went up against in that movie were heroes
393200	393760	themselves.
393760	397760	No, pretty much every single character, except for like the completely innocent or uninvolved
397760	398240	ones.
398240	400720	They're pretty much all villains in that movie.
400720	406560	But why didn't the Joker have the privilege of having social justice warriors identify
406560	408160	with his evil acts?
408160	411840	I mean, if they can do it with Pennywise, surely they can do it with the Joker, right?
411840	417520	Why was Pennywise an LGBTQ icon and therefore all of his crimes were downplayed or dismissed
417520	421200	or outright ignored until he stopped being an LGBTQ icon?
421200	422320	Then it was a betrayal.
422320	426320	While Joker never got that treatment, Joker was treated not as a progressive ally, but
426320	428320	as a totem for the incel problem.
428320	430080	I think we can actually get the answer to that.
430080	432800	Not from it or Joker, but from Star Wars.
432800	435520	And I am going to have a lot to say about Star Wars in a future video.
435520	436880	So this is just scratching the surface.
436880	438160	But let's talk about this for a minute.
438160	442960	I can't believe there's literally an explicitly anti-capitalist Star Wars movie.
442960	446000	And these dudes hate it because women leader do stuff.
446000	447360	Don't tell random man.
447360	448240	And this is what I mean.
448240	452000	It's not actually about the identification with evil or the identification with something
452000	453760	bad or negative or whatever.
453760	458000	It seems to me that the identification with evil is collateral damage.
458000	461600	It's a side effect of sticking with your tribe.
461600	465280	In this case, it doesn't matter that the new Star Wars movies are complete ass.
465280	467440	What matters is that they're anti-capitalist.
467440	469920	What matters is that they have women leaders in them.
469920	472000	That's more important than their quality.
472000	475280	We saw this with how they rallied around Ghostbusters 2016 as well.
475280	477920	Or the She-Ra cartoon or whatever.
477920	479840	There's countless examples of this happening.
479840	483440	We can see that when Finn's actor spoke out against the most recent Star Wars movie,
483440	487120	the radical lefties, at least over on the trash pile that is Reset Era,
487120	490720	said stuff like really thought he was one of the good ones
490720	494480	and liked him better when he kept his mouth shut and knew his place.
494480	498880	These are comments that you expect to see from like openly racist KKK members
498880	500720	or Stormfront users or something.
500720	506000	Not from the supposedly anti-racist progressive virtue signaling radical left.
506000	511440	In essence, when John Boyega decided to criticize Star Wars, he had left the tribe
511440	515520	and it no longer mattered if he was good or evil, if he was right or wrong,
515520	518720	if he was telling the truth or stating a falsehood.
518720	522880	Here is the rule spelled out plainly by some Tumblr SJW.
522880	526160	I love problematic male anti-hero characters,
526160	529200	but there are limitations to how morally gray they can be.
529920	532080	Like manipulating people and toying with them?
532080	532720	Cool.
532720	534080	Massacring entire cities?
534080	535440	My precious child.
535440	537360	Killing the heroine's closest friends?
537360	538240	I love you.
538240	540320	I'd die for you, my small son.
540320	544640	But being transphobic, racist, homophobic, or sexist?
544640	545520	Nice knowing you, bro.
545520	546720	I hope you rot in hell.
546720	551040	I mean, do you remember all those years of Yas Queen's sleigh when it come to Daenerys?
551680	555440	Right up until she turned into a tyrant and then Jon Snow stabbed her?
555440	557600	And then the reaction was a mix between
557600	561360	Daenerys was never a feminist icon and Jon Snow did her dirty?
561360	565280	What do you think they would have said if Daenerys had actually been successful?
566240	567600	Because remember the rule.
567600	570000	It didn't matter that she slaughtered an entire city.
570000	572320	What matters is that her politics were correct.
572320	575680	When your entire life philosophy is based on rebellion,
575680	578640	not just necessarily rebellion when something becomes too corrupt,
578640	580000	but senseless rebellion.
580000	582080	Simply a rebellion for a rebellion's sake.
582080	586560	Or maybe rebellion not as a means to reform a corrupted system,
586560	590240	but to completely destroy it and leave people with nothing but ashes.
590240	593120	And if you're a postmodernist, that is likely your point of view.
593120	597520	Because the postmodernists believe that there is actually no difference between good and evil,
597520	599360	that it's all simply power politics.
599360	604080	It's just tribes struggling for eternal dominance, that all hierarchies must be corrupt,
604080	606240	and therefore it's best to have your guys on top.
606240	611280	If all morality is simply relative in the way that the postmodernists think that it is,
611280	616000	then it's completely reasonable to identify with evil characters that hold your politics,
616000	617760	because there is no evil.
617760	620720	So Pennywise becomes an LGBTQ icon.
620720	624640	Joker is evil not because of his actions, but because of what he represents politically.
624640	628080	Daenerys was a tyrant building the empire of the good.
628080	633680	And to get back to Oni's nice guy comic, our purple-haired self-insert character is good
633680	634960	and right and just.
634960	638720	Not because she's actually good, right, or just, she's actually the opposite of those things.
638720	640960	But because her politics are correct.
640960	646000	And the new guy standing in for universal tolerance is shunned,
646000	648720	at least by the comic's author, despite being completely reasonable.
648720	652720	And I am happy to report that the entire rest of the internet seems to see things the way that I do.
652720	656960	Because everyone's recognized new guy, despite being the straw man that the author set up
656960	662480	so that her author insert could destroy, as being the actual good person in this scenario.
662480	664720	Because most people can actually recognize that,
665520	670480	even if we don't have a good grasp of what morality is, and I know I certainly don't,
670480	675120	there is at least something that is objectively good out there.
675120	679600	I couldn't define it for you if you asked me, but I think I know it when I see it.
679600	681760	I think this guy might be part of it.
681760	683040	And so new guy is trending.
683680	688160	And just like Lilith, I am happy that this unintentionally wholesome character
688160	689920	gets to be the first meme of the decade.
689920	693520	Not only do I want this to be a decade of wholesome goodness,
694160	695920	not only in memes, but other places.
695920	700080	But I also want wholesomeness to be the thing that we use to combat
700080	703600	the doom and gloom of social justice going forward.
703600	707520	Because at this point, the only narrative that the radical left has to offer people
707520	710640	is that the sky is falling, even when it's clearly not.
710640	712960	But yeah, new guy's gone viral.
712960	714640	People are making comic edits.
714640	717200	They're making their own wholesome fan arts.
717200	720640	And you know, looking over these edits a second time now that I'm recording this video,
720640	724560	I'm noticing that the original author really tried to make him look doofy.
724560	727760	You know, he's overweight, he's bald, he has kind of a funny face.
727760	731280	And yet all of these fan arts, they don't hide these facts.
731280	733760	They just make him look as good as possible.
733760	736480	He's putting his best foot forward in each one of these fan arts.
736480	738160	Of course, I decided to go look up the artist just to see
738160	739200	what they had been saying about it.
739200	741040	And I am obviously blocked.
741040	744240	Um, I've never heard of this person before this meme.
744240	746160	I've certainly never tweeted at her before.
746160	748960	I don't think she's ever heard of me, but nonetheless, I am blocked.
748960	751760	Probably because I follow Lilith and Lilith was involved in the propagation
751760	752960	of the meme or something.
752960	756560	At the same time, this person's tweets are also protected.
757120	758400	Surprise, surprise.
758400	762720	Because when you set up a straw man in one of your own works of art,
762720	766640	and even your self-insert can't knock over your straw man,
766640	769120	and everyone agrees with the straw man over you.
769840	772320	Yeah, I can see why you'd lock your Twitter account.
772320	776240	Now, of course, you could have taken the Shen Comics bike cuck route
777040	780400	and used it to expand her brand, promote herself,
780400	781920	maybe become a little bit more humble,
781920	783040	learn something along the way.
783760	786400	But no, she's not doing that, in fact.
786400	788480	But instead, when she first posts the comic, she says,
788480	791280	Clutch's pearls, won't someone think of the millionaires?
791280	794480	And then when Oni decides to repost it, she says,
794480	796240	wow, my mentions are fucked.
796240	799440	I guess having a bunch of piss babies call me ugly and horrible
799440	801200	for the next few days is going to be a thing.
801200	805200	You know, I haven't seen anyone call you ugly and horrible.
805200	807360	Maybe they have, if they do.
807360	808400	I don't think that's right.
808400	811680	At the same time, it's not that you're ugly and horrible.
811680	814160	It's that you're mean-spirited and cruel.
814160	817040	Even some folks I follow are making fun of me.
817040	818800	Yay, that feels nice.
819360	821840	Maybe this is an opportunity for self-reflection.
821840	825280	I'm not even saying give up social justice or anything,
825280	828160	though, of course, you know, any SJW who gives up social justice,
828160	830320	it's probably a good thing overall.
830320	831600	But I'm not even saying that.
831600	836160	I'm just saying maybe challenge your own opinions a little bit on this.
836160	839360	But if you're a postmodernist, it's going to be very hard to do that,
839360	842000	because the framework that you're tackling this from,
842560	845200	as we can see by the content of your comics,
845200	847280	is that there is no good or evil.
847280	851840	There's only power politics, and it's your team versus their team.
851840	855680	It's the SJWs versus the white supremacy capitalist patriarchy.
855680	858160	And that anything that your enemy has that is good
858720	861840	must be defined out of the good category.
861840	864320	And that any evil that you might have within you
864320	867680	have to be defined as good because you think your politics are good.
867680	871600	That's the problem with postmodernism, and that's why you identify with evil.
871600	875200	And now that everyone has noticed you identify with evil,
875200	877760	that's why people that you follow are making fun of you.
878480	880320	I know it doesn't feel nice.
880320	883200	And I know that having some kind of self-reflection on this
883200	884400	probably feels a lot worse.
884960	888240	But you are always going to be the spiteful little girl
888240	890400	in this bit of artwork that you've created,
890400	892640	demonizing completely reasonable people,
893200	895840	if you don't go through a process of self-reflection.
895840	898880	And this is not just some armchair psychology here.
898880	901680	Look at how she replies to people with legitimate criticisms about her,
901680	902800	regarding this comic.
902800	904640	I don't know what your other comics are like.
904640	907520	I never even knew you existed until I saw Chris's post.
907520	910560	But honestly, I think he just doesn't like the moral implications of the comic.
910560	913040	I don't think he has any problem with LGBT people,
913040	914640	since he has friends in the community.
914640	915760	I don't hate you.
915760	917920	Her only reply is a sarcastic,
917920	920720	yeah, he's such a moral person, the next Jesus, really.
920720	924000	There's no self-reflection here, just bitterness and rage.
924000	926720	And just in case you think I'm also pulling stuff out of my ass
926720	929280	regarding the moral side of this conversation as well,
929280	932560	let me just show you two of our old comic strips here.
932560	936000	This one seems quite old, based on the difference in art style.
936000	937760	It says, jerk-ass coworker.
937760	942240	And the coworker says, ugh, I am so sick of all this politically correct bullshit.
942240	945680	Look at this, do we really need content warnings for pictures of food?
945680	949120	And then the self-insert, who has red hair instead of purple hair now.
949120	952000	She says, maybe it helps those who struggle with eating disorders.
952080	954880	The coworker says, well, fuck that, I'm not going to coddle anyone.
954880	958880	Our self-insert says, well, no one is forcing you to use the content warnings,
958880	960640	but what's with the resentment towards this thing
960640	963040	that is simply being considered other people's feelings?
963040	967280	And then this comic's straw man says, I hate other people's feelings.
967280	970400	The self-insert ends the comic with, and there we have it, folks.
970400	972000	Now, in case you couldn't figure it out,
972000	975280	this is a comic about people who are insensitive, rude,
975280	978320	and generally uncaring about other people's points of view.
978320	979520	Okay, fair enough.
979520	981760	Here's a second comic by the same author.
982480	983280	That'll be $25.
984080	985680	So what are you up to today? Anything good?
986320	988160	Oh, I'm just getting a drink with my girlfriend.
988160	989840	Oh, hey, I'm gay too.
989840	991840	So where are you and your girlfriend going to go?
991840	993280	No, wait, I'm not gay.
993280	995600	My friend who's a girl and I are just having a ladies' night.
996400	999920	Okay, well, sorry, but that is infinitely less interesting to me.
999920	1005120	You can see that the positions and attitudes of the author insert and the straw man
1005120	1008800	have completely gone on a 180 between this strip and the previous one.
1008800	1011920	She has now completely gone against the previous strip's moral,
1011920	1015040	and yet we're still expected to side with our author insert
1015040	1018800	and completely disregard the previous definition of what was morally superior,
1018800	1022480	because her point of view, her politics, are right.
1022480	1026480	And of course, now that New Guy is a meme, everyone's blaming Oni for it.
1026480	1032080	45,000 fucking tweets dogpiling a trans person for doing fucking nothing
1032080	1035120	just because Oni NG thought he'd parade her in front of his audience
1035120	1038320	of 300,000 pieces of shit for a fucking laugh.
1038320	1042400	See, I have not mentioned in this video at all, up until this point,
1043120	1047520	that the author of the comic was trans, because it's not relevant.
1047520	1051440	And frankly, until I found this tweet that we're looking at right now,
1051440	1053120	I didn't know she was trans.
1053120	1057840	The fact that she is a trans person doesn't actually matter.
1057840	1060400	Being a member of a minority group, whether that's a racial minority
1060400	1062720	or being trans or being gay or something,
1062720	1065840	it does not excuse you from having a shit personality.
1065840	1068960	But to this person, only the trans thing matters.
1069600	1072400	It doesn't matter what she's done, it doesn't matter what she thinks,
1072400	1074320	it doesn't matter what opinions she holds,
1074320	1076320	it doesn't matter that she identifies with evil,
1076320	1079920	insofar as she dies in terms of this silly little comic.
1079920	1082560	What matters is that she's part of the tribe.
1082560	1084800	And these people inherently understand this, I think.
1084800	1088800	They understand that the co-opting of New Guy and turning him into
1088800	1093920	a symbol of wholeness or positivity is damaging to their point of view.
1093920	1095680	So, you know, this person says,
1095680	1099280	if I see anyone making a New Guy comic putting the New Guy in a positive light,
1099280	1100560	I am blocking them immediately.
1101360	1106000	It's not about putting the author insert or the original author in a negative light,
1106000	1109920	but putting the New Guy in a positive light is the problem.
1109920	1112640	The spreading of the positivity is itself an affront.
1113360	1118160	Alright, Miss Mallory Jessica Ushidas, I don't know you.
1118160	1120160	I highly doubt you're going to watch this video.
1120160	1123280	And even though you would probably hate me, I certainly don't hate you.
1123920	1128560	And I'm not going to pretend that you're currently going through a positive experience.
1129280	1135520	But unless you understand that on some level your own toxicity brought this on,
1135520	1137520	then your situation is never going to change.
1137520	1139840	I'm not saying that those who are currently dogpiling you,
1139840	1143360	if that's what's actually happening, aren't responsible for their own actions.
1143360	1143860	They are.
1144480	1146640	But you're responsible for yours too.
1146640	1150000	And this is definitely a reaping what you sow scenario.
1150000	1154880	I'm not going to be so naive to say that if you go through life offering kindness,
1154880	1156560	you'll just get kindness in return.
1156560	1157920	That's not how it is.
1157920	1163200	But I will say that if you go through life offering the level of nastiness
1163200	1166560	that you seem to have been offering throughout this entire video,
1166560	1169120	you will get nothing but nastiness in return.
1169120	1173280	And I don't know about you, but having bad stuff happen to you sometimes
1173280	1176320	is better than having bad stuff happen to you all the time.
