1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Here, let's start the new year off right by wasting time on Twitter.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,240
OniNG, somebody who I look up to quite a bit, posted this viral tweet yesterday.

3
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:11,360
I wanted to start my year good, but this was the first thing I saw today.

4
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:13,760
And this is a webcomic by somebody I've never heard of.

5
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:15,200
We can just very quickly go through it here.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,720
Here's a purple-haired SJW laughing.

7
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:21,280
There's a new guy at the store.

8
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:23,120
Oh, what's so funny?

9
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:26,000
Hey, that millionaire gamer bro douchebag totally got robbed.

10
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:29,120
Hey, how'd you like it if you were robbed?

11
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:32,640
Oh wow, I can tell we're going to be the kind of co-workers who become good friends.

12
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:33,680
Wow, really?

13
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:34,320
Hell no.

14
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:39,280
And the whole point of these self-insert comics is they have their self-insert character parroting

15
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:45,520
their philosophy, and they pit that philosophy against various strawmans like, for example,

16
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,520
the bald new guy.

17
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:51,840
But Oni's tweeting of this comic went viral because apparently everyone's taking new guy's

18
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:56,000
side to the point that the words new guy have been trending on Twitter all day today.

19
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,480
In fact, Oni even remarked on this, saying that he woke up this morning and new guy is

20
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:01,600
now a trending meme.

21
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:02,240
Oops.

22
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:07,280
And I guess because of my good friend and co-host Lilith Lovett's involvement in propagating

23
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:09,920
of the meme, Oni has now decided to follow her back.

24
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:11,600
I have to say, I'm kind of jealous.

25
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:13,360
Lilith, you should get him to watch our show.

26
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:17,600
But yeah, new guy has become the latest hero, the first of 2020.

27
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:21,440
And of course, he's being replicated in various memes like the Virgin Chad template, which

28
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:22,640
is always hilarious.

29
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:25,360
But I think it's actually important to talk about what's going on with this comic here

30
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:30,960
because this seems to happen a lot with social justice comic creators, which frankly, a lot

31
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:35,360
of webcomics nowadays, they seem to be run or made by SJWs.

32
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:40,800
I wouldn't say that they always do this, but the lower you go down the quality rungs, the

33
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,320
more likely they are to do this.

34
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:46,400
They have a self-insert character, like I said, that argues with strawmans.

35
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:49,520
But the first question we can ask is, why is everyone siding with new guy?

36
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:52,800
I mean, it's kind of obvious if you really think about it for more than five seconds.

37
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:58,240
This is somebody taking glee in the fact that a millionaire gamer bro douchebag got robbed.

38
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:04,560
I assume this is in reference to PewDiePie and having his house broken into and Marzia's

39
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,920
jewelry getting stolen.

40
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,080
That happened, I think, a month or two months ago or whatever it was.

41
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:14,160
And she's taking glee in this because, you know, SJWs hate PewDiePie at this point because

42
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:20,480
he's not willing to self-censor or be apologetic enough for what they perceive to be his sins.

43
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:24,800
And the only thing that new guy does in this comic is, first of all, in the first panel,

44
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:29,120
he wants to join in what she's finding funny, hoping that it would be a positive experience.

45
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:35,200
He notices that it's, you know, probably not a good thing that she's just baselessly laughing

46
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,600
at a misfortune that befalls somebody.

47
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:42,240
And then he's happy about the fact that he thinks he's made a new friend.

48
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:47,920
In all four of these panels, the self-insert, the one that you're supposed to be siding

49
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:50,000
with, is the asshole.

50
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:56,640
And I think that the radical left right now has this weird identification with evil that

51
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,800
probably needs to be discussed at some point.

52
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,560
Maybe we can do it right now, in fact.

53
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:04,400
I mean, you must remember this from a little while ago, right, where they said that Pennywise

54
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:08,880
and the Babadook are said to be dating and they've become LGBTQ icons.

55
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:14,080
These are horrific supernatural creatures from it or whatever.

56
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,040
I didn't see it.

57
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:15,760
I don't really care.

58
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:21,200
But the point is, is that Pennywise, at the very least, I know a little bit about him.

59
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,080
He's not a good guy.

60
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:27,280
I mean, he's like a demonic clown entity, but I guess because he's being shipped with the

61
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:32,400
Babadook, all the horrible crimes he's committed, the fact that he is a personification of evil

62
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:35,760
itself doesn't matter because he's LGBTQ.

63
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:42,080
All that other stuff can be forgiven, you know, because he's one of the LGBTQ tribe.

64
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:46,720
And in fact, when this article came out and when this this was shortly a thing on the

65
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:52,480
Internet, there was definitely a lot of association with Pennywise and the Babadook by a lot of

66
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:58,080
individuals who just seemed to be, you know, my team right or wrong, my tribe, my group.

67
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:03,040
And you really have to imagine what kind of person views this drawing as as their ideal,

68
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,800
or at least as their mascot.

69
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:10,240
You know, you have these these horrific creatures who have done unspeakable things, but because

70
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:13,200
they're waving the LGBTQ flag, it's it's all right.

71
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,040
You know, they're they're on side now.

72
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:20,080
This whole thing moved beyond stupidity into something ideological when when it chapter

73
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:23,760
two came out two years later in September of 2019.

74
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:30,720
And it turns out that Pennywise was surprisingly anti-queer and that the killer clown wasn't

75
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,720
the ally they all thought he was.

76
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:36,960
You know, if you had your head on straight and didn't just think of things in terms of

77
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:39,600
ideology, you would have been able to notice this.

78
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:44,160
You would have been able to figure out that identifying with something that is evil just

79
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:48,400
because it is like you in some superficial way is probably not a good thing.

80
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:52,800
And yet mistaking solidarity for morality is something that the radicals on the left seem

81
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,960
to do as a matter of course.

82
00:04:54,960 --> 00:05:00,160
For example, back when Untitled Goose Game was was the hot new thing, this tweet here

83
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:04,880
went viral where it had the the titular goose as a trans person, you know, having a little

84
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:09,600
bow in their hair and and holding a trans flag and says, anyways, goose is trans.

85
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:13,520
For those of you who don't know, Untitled Goose Game is a game where basically you play

86
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:19,040
as a goose and you steal the belongings of all these various members of this small town.

87
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:21,040
It's a it's a funny, silly little game.

88
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,640
It might last you an hour or two.

89
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:23,760
The music's great.

90
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:25,600
The graphical style is pretty adorable.

91
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,560
But the honest truth is you play the villain in this game.

92
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:33,920
Now, you're not a very serious villain because all you are is a goose causing mischief and

93
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:38,320
mayhem in this small hamlet by stealing people's stuff and running off with it and dumping

94
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:42,160
it in the lake or or stealing their hats or whatever it happens to be, because the point

95
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:47,440
of the game is is to cause relatively minor mishaps playing as basically a mischievous

96
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,360
spirit, you know, a trickster almost.

97
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:53,360
You might laugh while playing this game, but you probably shouldn't think that your actions

98
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,000
are heroic.

99
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,280
That's not the kind of game it is.

100
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:57,840
And yet goose is trans.

101
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:02,560
You could make the argument that goose isn't good, but it's more important that goose is

102
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:03,440
trans.

103
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:06,320
Now, maybe you're thinking I'm just pulling all this out of my ass and you know, maybe

104
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:06,800
I am.

105
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,880
But here's why I think that there's actually something to this.

106
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:11,040
When the Joker came out, we got articles like this.

107
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:16,480
Joker is a dangerous film and it's bringing out the worst in the Internet or why Joker

108
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:20,720
is sparking a backlash over its portrayal of incel violence.

109
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,000
Now, I like the Joker.

110
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,960
But to those of you who were really in love with this film, I hate to break it to you.

111
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,600
The Joker was a villain in that.

112
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:27,920
All right.

113
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,360
At least he certainly wasn't a hero.

114
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:33,200
That doesn't mean that the people that he went up against in that movie were heroes

115
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:33,760
themselves.

116
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:37,760
No, pretty much every single character, except for like the completely innocent or uninvolved

117
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:38,240
ones.

118
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,720
They're pretty much all villains in that movie.

119
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:46,560
But why didn't the Joker have the privilege of having social justice warriors identify

120
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,160
with his evil acts?

121
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:51,840
I mean, if they can do it with Pennywise, surely they can do it with the Joker, right?

122
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:57,520
Why was Pennywise an LGBTQ icon and therefore all of his crimes were downplayed or dismissed

123
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:01,200
or outright ignored until he stopped being an LGBTQ icon?

124
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,320
Then it was a betrayal.

125
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:06,320
While Joker never got that treatment, Joker was treated not as a progressive ally, but

126
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:08,320
as a totem for the incel problem.

127
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:10,080
I think we can actually get the answer to that.

128
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,800
Not from it or Joker, but from Star Wars.

129
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,520
And I am going to have a lot to say about Star Wars in a future video.

130
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:16,880
So this is just scratching the surface.

131
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,160
But let's talk about this for a minute.

132
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:22,960
I can't believe there's literally an explicitly anti-capitalist Star Wars movie.

133
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:26,000
And these dudes hate it because women leader do stuff.

134
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,360
Don't tell random man.

135
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,240
And this is what I mean.

136
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:32,000
It's not actually about the identification with evil or the identification with something

137
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,760
bad or negative or whatever.

138
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:38,000
It seems to me that the identification with evil is collateral damage.

139
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,600
It's a side effect of sticking with your tribe.

140
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:45,280
In this case, it doesn't matter that the new Star Wars movies are complete ass.

141
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:47,440
What matters is that they're anti-capitalist.

142
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,920
What matters is that they have women leaders in them.

143
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:52,000
That's more important than their quality.

144
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,280
We saw this with how they rallied around Ghostbusters 2016 as well.

145
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:57,920
Or the She-Ra cartoon or whatever.

146
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:59,840
There's countless examples of this happening.

147
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:03,440
We can see that when Finn's actor spoke out against the most recent Star Wars movie,

148
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:07,120
the radical lefties, at least over on the trash pile that is Reset Era,

149
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:10,720
said stuff like really thought he was one of the good ones

150
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:14,480
and liked him better when he kept his mouth shut and knew his place.

151
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:18,880
These are comments that you expect to see from like openly racist KKK members

152
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:20,720
or Stormfront users or something.

153
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:26,000
Not from the supposedly anti-racist progressive virtue signaling radical left.

154
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:31,440
In essence, when John Boyega decided to criticize Star Wars, he had left the tribe

155
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:35,520
and it no longer mattered if he was good or evil, if he was right or wrong,

156
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:38,720
if he was telling the truth or stating a falsehood.

157
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:42,880
Here is the rule spelled out plainly by some Tumblr SJW.

158
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:46,160
I love problematic male anti-hero characters,

159
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:49,200
but there are limitations to how morally gray they can be.

160
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:52,080
Like manipulating people and toying with them?

161
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:52,720
Cool.

162
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,080
Massacring entire cities?

163
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,440
My precious child.

164
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,360
Killing the heroine's closest friends?

165
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,240
I love you.

166
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,320
I'd die for you, my small son.

167
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:04,640
But being transphobic, racist, homophobic, or sexist?

168
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:05,520
Nice knowing you, bro.

169
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:06,720
I hope you rot in hell.

170
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:11,040
I mean, do you remember all those years of Yas Queen's sleigh when it come to Daenerys?

171
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:15,440
Right up until she turned into a tyrant and then Jon Snow stabbed her?

172
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,600
And then the reaction was a mix between

173
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:21,360
Daenerys was never a feminist icon and Jon Snow did her dirty?

174
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:25,280
What do you think they would have said if Daenerys had actually been successful?

175
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,600
Because remember the rule.

176
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,000
It didn't matter that she slaughtered an entire city.

177
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,320
What matters is that her politics were correct.

178
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:35,680
When your entire life philosophy is based on rebellion,

179
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:38,640
not just necessarily rebellion when something becomes too corrupt,

180
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,000
but senseless rebellion.

181
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,080
Simply a rebellion for a rebellion's sake.

182
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:46,560
Or maybe rebellion not as a means to reform a corrupted system,

183
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:50,240
but to completely destroy it and leave people with nothing but ashes.

184
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:53,120
And if you're a postmodernist, that is likely your point of view.

185
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:57,520
Because the postmodernists believe that there is actually no difference between good and evil,

186
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:59,360
that it's all simply power politics.

187
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:04,080
It's just tribes struggling for eternal dominance, that all hierarchies must be corrupt,

188
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:06,240
and therefore it's best to have your guys on top.

189
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:11,280
If all morality is simply relative in the way that the postmodernists think that it is,

190
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:16,000
then it's completely reasonable to identify with evil characters that hold your politics,

191
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,760
because there is no evil.

192
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:20,720
So Pennywise becomes an LGBTQ icon.

193
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:24,640
Joker is evil not because of his actions, but because of what he represents politically.

194
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:28,080
Daenerys was a tyrant building the empire of the good.

195
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:33,680
And to get back to Oni's nice guy comic, our purple-haired self-insert character is good

196
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:34,960
and right and just.

197
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:38,720
Not because she's actually good, right, or just, she's actually the opposite of those things.

198
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,960
But because her politics are correct.

199
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:46,000
And the new guy standing in for universal tolerance is shunned,

200
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,720
at least by the comic's author, despite being completely reasonable.

201
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:52,720
And I am happy to report that the entire rest of the internet seems to see things the way that I do.

202
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:56,960
Because everyone's recognized new guy, despite being the straw man that the author set up

203
00:10:56,960 --> 00:11:02,480
so that her author insert could destroy, as being the actual good person in this scenario.

204
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,720
Because most people can actually recognize that,

205
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:10,480
even if we don't have a good grasp of what morality is, and I know I certainly don't,

206
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:15,120
there is at least something that is objectively good out there.

207
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:19,600
I couldn't define it for you if you asked me, but I think I know it when I see it.

208
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,760
I think this guy might be part of it.

209
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,040
And so new guy is trending.

210
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:28,160
And just like Lilith, I am happy that this unintentionally wholesome character

211
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:29,920
gets to be the first meme of the decade.

212
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:33,520
Not only do I want this to be a decade of wholesome goodness,

213
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,920
not only in memes, but other places.

214
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:40,080
But I also want wholesomeness to be the thing that we use to combat

215
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:43,600
the doom and gloom of social justice going forward.

216
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:47,520
Because at this point, the only narrative that the radical left has to offer people

217
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:50,640
is that the sky is falling, even when it's clearly not.

218
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:52,960
But yeah, new guy's gone viral.

219
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:54,640
People are making comic edits.

220
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:57,200
They're making their own wholesome fan arts.

221
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:00,640
And you know, looking over these edits a second time now that I'm recording this video,

222
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:04,560
I'm noticing that the original author really tried to make him look doofy.

223
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:07,760
You know, he's overweight, he's bald, he has kind of a funny face.

224
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:11,280
And yet all of these fan arts, they don't hide these facts.

225
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:13,760
They just make him look as good as possible.

226
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:16,480
He's putting his best foot forward in each one of these fan arts.

227
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:18,160
Of course, I decided to go look up the artist just to see

228
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:19,200
what they had been saying about it.

229
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,040
And I am obviously blocked.

230
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:24,240
Um, I've never heard of this person before this meme.

231
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,160
I've certainly never tweeted at her before.

232
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,960
I don't think she's ever heard of me, but nonetheless, I am blocked.

233
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:31,760
Probably because I follow Lilith and Lilith was involved in the propagation

234
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:32,960
of the meme or something.

235
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:36,560
At the same time, this person's tweets are also protected.

236
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,400
Surprise, surprise.

237
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:42,720
Because when you set up a straw man in one of your own works of art,

238
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:46,640
and even your self-insert can't knock over your straw man,

239
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:49,120
and everyone agrees with the straw man over you.

240
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:52,320
Yeah, I can see why you'd lock your Twitter account.

241
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:56,240
Now, of course, you could have taken the Shen Comics bike cuck route

242
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:00,400
and used it to expand her brand, promote herself,

243
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:01,920
maybe become a little bit more humble,

244
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,040
learn something along the way.

245
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:06,400
But no, she's not doing that, in fact.

246
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:08,480
But instead, when she first posts the comic, she says,

247
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:11,280
Clutch's pearls, won't someone think of the millionaires?

248
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:14,480
And then when Oni decides to repost it, she says,

249
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:16,240
wow, my mentions are fucked.

250
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:19,440
I guess having a bunch of piss babies call me ugly and horrible

251
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,200
for the next few days is going to be a thing.

252
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:25,200
You know, I haven't seen anyone call you ugly and horrible.

253
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,360
Maybe they have, if they do.

254
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,400
I don't think that's right.

255
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:31,680
At the same time, it's not that you're ugly and horrible.

256
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:34,160
It's that you're mean-spirited and cruel.

257
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:37,040
Even some folks I follow are making fun of me.

258
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:38,800
Yay, that feels nice.

259
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,840
Maybe this is an opportunity for self-reflection.

260
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:45,280
I'm not even saying give up social justice or anything,

261
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:48,160
though, of course, you know, any SJW who gives up social justice,

262
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,320
it's probably a good thing overall.

263
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,600
But I'm not even saying that.

264
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:56,160
I'm just saying maybe challenge your own opinions a little bit on this.

265
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:59,360
But if you're a postmodernist, it's going to be very hard to do that,

266
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:02,000
because the framework that you're tackling this from,

267
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:05,200
as we can see by the content of your comics,

268
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:07,280
is that there is no good or evil.

269
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:11,840
There's only power politics, and it's your team versus their team.

270
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:15,680
It's the SJWs versus the white supremacy capitalist patriarchy.

271
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:18,160
And that anything that your enemy has that is good

272
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:21,840
must be defined out of the good category.

273
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:24,320
And that any evil that you might have within you

274
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:27,680
have to be defined as good because you think your politics are good.

275
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:31,600
That's the problem with postmodernism, and that's why you identify with evil.

276
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:35,200
And now that everyone has noticed you identify with evil,

277
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:37,760
that's why people that you follow are making fun of you.

278
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:40,320
I know it doesn't feel nice.

279
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:43,200
And I know that having some kind of self-reflection on this

280
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,400
probably feels a lot worse.

281
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:48,240
But you are always going to be the spiteful little girl

282
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:50,400
in this bit of artwork that you've created,

283
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:52,640
demonizing completely reasonable people,

284
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:55,840
if you don't go through a process of self-reflection.

285
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:58,880
And this is not just some armchair psychology here.

286
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:01,680
Look at how she replies to people with legitimate criticisms about her,

287
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:02,800
regarding this comic.

288
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,640
I don't know what your other comics are like.

289
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:07,520
I never even knew you existed until I saw Chris's post.

290
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:10,560
But honestly, I think he just doesn't like the moral implications of the comic.

291
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:13,040
I don't think he has any problem with LGBT people,

292
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,640
since he has friends in the community.

293
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:15,760
I don't hate you.

294
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,920
Her only reply is a sarcastic,

295
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:20,720
yeah, he's such a moral person, the next Jesus, really.

296
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:24,000
There's no self-reflection here, just bitterness and rage.

297
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,720
And just in case you think I'm also pulling stuff out of my ass

298
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:29,280
regarding the moral side of this conversation as well,

299
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:32,560
let me just show you two of our old comic strips here.

300
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:36,000
This one seems quite old, based on the difference in art style.

301
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,760
It says, jerk-ass coworker.

302
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:42,240
And the coworker says, ugh, I am so sick of all this politically correct bullshit.

303
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:45,680
Look at this, do we really need content warnings for pictures of food?

304
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:49,120
And then the self-insert, who has red hair instead of purple hair now.

305
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:52,000
She says, maybe it helps those who struggle with eating disorders.

306
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:54,880
The coworker says, well, fuck that, I'm not going to coddle anyone.

307
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:58,880
Our self-insert says, well, no one is forcing you to use the content warnings,

308
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:00,640
but what's with the resentment towards this thing

309
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:03,040
that is simply being considered other people's feelings?

310
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:07,280
And then this comic's straw man says, I hate other people's feelings.

311
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:10,400
The self-insert ends the comic with, and there we have it, folks.

312
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:12,000
Now, in case you couldn't figure it out,

313
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,280
this is a comic about people who are insensitive, rude,

314
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:18,320
and generally uncaring about other people's points of view.

315
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,520
Okay, fair enough.

316
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:21,760
Here's a second comic by the same author.

317
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:23,280
That'll be $25.

318
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:25,680
So what are you up to today? Anything good?

319
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,160
Oh, I'm just getting a drink with my girlfriend.

320
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:29,840
Oh, hey, I'm gay too.

321
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:31,840
So where are you and your girlfriend going to go?

322
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:33,280
No, wait, I'm not gay.

323
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:35,600
My friend who's a girl and I are just having a ladies' night.

324
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:39,920
Okay, well, sorry, but that is infinitely less interesting to me.

325
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:45,120
You can see that the positions and attitudes of the author insert and the straw man

326
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:48,800
have completely gone on a 180 between this strip and the previous one.

327
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:51,920
She has now completely gone against the previous strip's moral,

328
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:55,040
and yet we're still expected to side with our author insert

329
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:58,800
and completely disregard the previous definition of what was morally superior,

330
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:02,480
because her point of view, her politics, are right.

331
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:06,480
And of course, now that New Guy is a meme, everyone's blaming Oni for it.

332
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:12,080
45,000 fucking tweets dogpiling a trans person for doing fucking nothing

333
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:15,120
just because Oni NG thought he'd parade her in front of his audience

334
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:18,320
of 300,000 pieces of shit for a fucking laugh.

335
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:22,400
See, I have not mentioned in this video at all, up until this point,

336
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:27,520
that the author of the comic was trans, because it's not relevant.

337
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:31,440
And frankly, until I found this tweet that we're looking at right now,

338
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:33,120
I didn't know she was trans.

339
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:37,840
The fact that she is a trans person doesn't actually matter.

340
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:40,400
Being a member of a minority group, whether that's a racial minority

341
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,720
or being trans or being gay or something,

342
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:45,840
it does not excuse you from having a shit personality.

343
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:48,960
But to this person, only the trans thing matters.

344
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:52,400
It doesn't matter what she's done, it doesn't matter what she thinks,

345
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,320
it doesn't matter what opinions she holds,

346
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:56,320
it doesn't matter that she identifies with evil,

347
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:59,920
insofar as she dies in terms of this silly little comic.

348
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:02,560
What matters is that she's part of the tribe.

349
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:04,800
And these people inherently understand this, I think.

350
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:08,800
They understand that the co-opting of New Guy and turning him into

351
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:13,920
a symbol of wholeness or positivity is damaging to their point of view.

352
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:15,680
So, you know, this person says,

353
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:19,280
if I see anyone making a New Guy comic putting the New Guy in a positive light,

354
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:20,560
I am blocking them immediately.

355
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:26,000
It's not about putting the author insert or the original author in a negative light,

356
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,920
but putting the New Guy in a positive light is the problem.

357
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:32,640
The spreading of the positivity is itself an affront.

358
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:38,160
Alright, Miss Mallory Jessica Ushidas, I don't know you.

359
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:40,160
I highly doubt you're going to watch this video.

360
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:43,280
And even though you would probably hate me, I certainly don't hate you.

361
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:48,560
And I'm not going to pretend that you're currently going through a positive experience.

362
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:55,520
But unless you understand that on some level your own toxicity brought this on,

363
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:57,520
then your situation is never going to change.

364
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:59,840
I'm not saying that those who are currently dogpiling you,

365
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:03,360
if that's what's actually happening, aren't responsible for their own actions.

366
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:03,860
They are.

367
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:06,640
But you're responsible for yours too.

368
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:10,000
And this is definitely a reaping what you sow scenario.

369
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:14,880
I'm not going to be so naive to say that if you go through life offering kindness,

370
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,560
you'll just get kindness in return.

371
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:17,920
That's not how it is.

372
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:23,200
But I will say that if you go through life offering the level of nastiness

373
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:26,560
that you seem to have been offering throughout this entire video,

374
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:29,120
you will get nothing but nastiness in return.

375
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:33,280
And I don't know about you, but having bad stuff happen to you sometimes

376
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:36,320
is better than having bad stuff happen to you all the time.
