WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.000
Here, let's start the new year off right by wasting time on Twitter.

00:04.000 --> 00:08.240
OniNG, somebody who I look up to quite a bit, posted this viral tweet yesterday.

00:08.240 --> 00:11.360
I wanted to start my year good, but this was the first thing I saw today.

00:11.360 --> 00:13.760
And this is a webcomic by somebody I've never heard of.

00:13.760 --> 00:15.200
We can just very quickly go through it here.

00:16.000 --> 00:18.720
Here's a purple-haired SJW laughing.

00:19.680 --> 00:21.280
There's a new guy at the store.

00:21.840 --> 00:23.120
Oh, what's so funny?

00:23.120 --> 00:26.000
Hey, that millionaire gamer bro douchebag totally got robbed.

00:26.960 --> 00:29.120
Hey, how'd you like it if you were robbed?

00:29.120 --> 00:32.640
Oh wow, I can tell we're going to be the kind of co-workers who become good friends.

00:32.640 --> 00:33.680
Wow, really?

00:33.680 --> 00:34.320
Hell no.

00:34.960 --> 00:39.280
And the whole point of these self-insert comics is they have their self-insert character parroting

00:39.280 --> 00:45.520
their philosophy, and they pit that philosophy against various strawmans like, for example,

00:45.520 --> 00:47.520
the bald new guy.

00:47.520 --> 00:51.840
But Oni's tweeting of this comic went viral because apparently everyone's taking new guy's

00:51.840 --> 00:56.000
side to the point that the words new guy have been trending on Twitter all day today.

00:56.000 --> 01:00.480
In fact, Oni even remarked on this, saying that he woke up this morning and new guy is

01:00.480 --> 01:01.600
now a trending meme.

01:01.600 --> 01:02.240
Oops.

01:02.240 --> 01:07.280
And I guess because of my good friend and co-host Lilith Lovett's involvement in propagating

01:07.280 --> 01:09.920
of the meme, Oni has now decided to follow her back.

01:09.920 --> 01:11.600
I have to say, I'm kind of jealous.

01:11.600 --> 01:13.360
Lilith, you should get him to watch our show.

01:13.360 --> 01:17.600
But yeah, new guy has become the latest hero, the first of 2020.

01:17.600 --> 01:21.440
And of course, he's being replicated in various memes like the Virgin Chad template, which

01:21.440 --> 01:22.640
is always hilarious.

01:22.640 --> 01:25.360
But I think it's actually important to talk about what's going on with this comic here

01:25.360 --> 01:30.960
because this seems to happen a lot with social justice comic creators, which frankly, a lot

01:30.960 --> 01:35.360
of webcomics nowadays, they seem to be run or made by SJWs.

01:35.360 --> 01:40.800
I wouldn't say that they always do this, but the lower you go down the quality rungs, the

01:40.800 --> 01:42.320
more likely they are to do this.

01:42.320 --> 01:46.400
They have a self-insert character, like I said, that argues with strawmans.

01:46.400 --> 01:49.520
But the first question we can ask is, why is everyone siding with new guy?

01:49.520 --> 01:52.800
I mean, it's kind of obvious if you really think about it for more than five seconds.

01:52.800 --> 01:58.240
This is somebody taking glee in the fact that a millionaire gamer bro douchebag got robbed.

01:58.240 --> 02:04.560
I assume this is in reference to PewDiePie and having his house broken into and Marzia's

02:04.560 --> 02:05.920
jewelry getting stolen.

02:05.920 --> 02:08.080
That happened, I think, a month or two months ago or whatever it was.

02:09.600 --> 02:14.160
And she's taking glee in this because, you know, SJWs hate PewDiePie at this point because

02:14.160 --> 02:20.480
he's not willing to self-censor or be apologetic enough for what they perceive to be his sins.

02:20.480 --> 02:24.800
And the only thing that new guy does in this comic is, first of all, in the first panel,

02:24.800 --> 02:29.120
he wants to join in what she's finding funny, hoping that it would be a positive experience.

02:29.840 --> 02:35.200
He notices that it's, you know, probably not a good thing that she's just baselessly laughing

02:35.200 --> 02:37.600
at a misfortune that befalls somebody.

02:37.600 --> 02:42.240
And then he's happy about the fact that he thinks he's made a new friend.

02:42.240 --> 02:47.920
In all four of these panels, the self-insert, the one that you're supposed to be siding

02:47.920 --> 02:50.000
with, is the asshole.

02:50.000 --> 02:56.640
And I think that the radical left right now has this weird identification with evil that

02:56.640 --> 02:58.800
probably needs to be discussed at some point.

02:58.800 --> 03:00.560
Maybe we can do it right now, in fact.

03:00.560 --> 03:04.400
I mean, you must remember this from a little while ago, right, where they said that Pennywise

03:04.400 --> 03:08.880
and the Babadook are said to be dating and they've become LGBTQ icons.

03:09.440 --> 03:14.080
These are horrific supernatural creatures from it or whatever.

03:14.080 --> 03:15.040
I didn't see it.

03:15.040 --> 03:15.760
I don't really care.

03:15.760 --> 03:21.200
But the point is, is that Pennywise, at the very least, I know a little bit about him.

03:21.200 --> 03:22.080
He's not a good guy.

03:22.080 --> 03:27.280
I mean, he's like a demonic clown entity, but I guess because he's being shipped with the

03:27.280 --> 03:32.400
Babadook, all the horrible crimes he's committed, the fact that he is a personification of evil

03:32.400 --> 03:35.760
itself doesn't matter because he's LGBTQ.

03:35.760 --> 03:42.080
All that other stuff can be forgiven, you know, because he's one of the LGBTQ tribe.

03:42.080 --> 03:46.720
And in fact, when this article came out and when this this was shortly a thing on the

03:46.720 --> 03:52.480
Internet, there was definitely a lot of association with Pennywise and the Babadook by a lot of

03:52.480 --> 03:58.080
individuals who just seemed to be, you know, my team right or wrong, my tribe, my group.

03:58.080 --> 04:03.040
And you really have to imagine what kind of person views this drawing as as their ideal,

04:03.040 --> 04:04.800
or at least as their mascot.

04:04.800 --> 04:10.240
You know, you have these these horrific creatures who have done unspeakable things, but because

04:10.240 --> 04:13.200
they're waving the LGBTQ flag, it's it's all right.

04:13.200 --> 04:15.040
You know, they're they're on side now.

04:15.040 --> 04:20.080
This whole thing moved beyond stupidity into something ideological when when it chapter

04:20.080 --> 04:23.760
two came out two years later in September of 2019.

04:23.760 --> 04:30.720
And it turns out that Pennywise was surprisingly anti-queer and that the killer clown wasn't

04:30.720 --> 04:32.720
the ally they all thought he was.

04:32.720 --> 04:36.960
You know, if you had your head on straight and didn't just think of things in terms of

04:36.960 --> 04:39.600
ideology, you would have been able to notice this.

04:39.600 --> 04:44.160
You would have been able to figure out that identifying with something that is evil just

04:44.160 --> 04:48.400
because it is like you in some superficial way is probably not a good thing.

04:48.400 --> 04:52.800
And yet mistaking solidarity for morality is something that the radicals on the left seem

04:52.800 --> 04:54.960
to do as a matter of course.

04:54.960 --> 05:00.160
For example, back when Untitled Goose Game was was the hot new thing, this tweet here

05:00.160 --> 05:04.880
went viral where it had the the titular goose as a trans person, you know, having a little

05:04.880 --> 05:09.600
bow in their hair and and holding a trans flag and says, anyways, goose is trans.

05:09.600 --> 05:13.520
For those of you who don't know, Untitled Goose Game is a game where basically you play

05:13.520 --> 05:19.040
as a goose and you steal the belongings of all these various members of this small town.

05:19.040 --> 05:21.040
It's a it's a funny, silly little game.

05:21.040 --> 05:22.640
It might last you an hour or two.

05:22.640 --> 05:23.760
The music's great.

05:23.760 --> 05:25.600
The graphical style is pretty adorable.

05:25.600 --> 05:28.560
But the honest truth is you play the villain in this game.

05:29.280 --> 05:33.920
Now, you're not a very serious villain because all you are is a goose causing mischief and

05:33.920 --> 05:38.320
mayhem in this small hamlet by stealing people's stuff and running off with it and dumping

05:38.320 --> 05:42.160
it in the lake or or stealing their hats or whatever it happens to be, because the point

05:42.160 --> 05:47.440
of the game is is to cause relatively minor mishaps playing as basically a mischievous

05:47.440 --> 05:49.360
spirit, you know, a trickster almost.

05:49.360 --> 05:53.360
You might laugh while playing this game, but you probably shouldn't think that your actions

05:53.360 --> 05:54.000
are heroic.

05:54.000 --> 05:55.280
That's not the kind of game it is.

05:55.280 --> 05:57.840
And yet goose is trans.

05:57.840 --> 06:02.560
You could make the argument that goose isn't good, but it's more important that goose is

06:02.560 --> 06:03.440
trans.

06:03.440 --> 06:06.320
Now, maybe you're thinking I'm just pulling all this out of my ass and you know, maybe

06:06.320 --> 06:06.800
I am.

06:06.800 --> 06:08.880
But here's why I think that there's actually something to this.

06:08.880 --> 06:11.040
When the Joker came out, we got articles like this.

06:11.600 --> 06:16.480
Joker is a dangerous film and it's bringing out the worst in the Internet or why Joker

06:16.480 --> 06:20.720
is sparking a backlash over its portrayal of incel violence.

06:20.720 --> 06:22.000
Now, I like the Joker.

06:22.000 --> 06:24.960
But to those of you who were really in love with this film, I hate to break it to you.

06:25.600 --> 06:27.600
The Joker was a villain in that.

06:27.600 --> 06:27.920
All right.

06:27.920 --> 06:29.360
At least he certainly wasn't a hero.

06:29.360 --> 06:33.200
That doesn't mean that the people that he went up against in that movie were heroes

06:33.200 --> 06:33.760
themselves.

06:33.760 --> 06:37.760
No, pretty much every single character, except for like the completely innocent or uninvolved

06:37.760 --> 06:38.240
ones.

06:38.240 --> 06:40.720
They're pretty much all villains in that movie.

06:40.720 --> 06:46.560
But why didn't the Joker have the privilege of having social justice warriors identify

06:46.560 --> 06:48.160
with his evil acts?

06:48.160 --> 06:51.840
I mean, if they can do it with Pennywise, surely they can do it with the Joker, right?

06:51.840 --> 06:57.520
Why was Pennywise an LGBTQ icon and therefore all of his crimes were downplayed or dismissed

06:57.520 --> 07:01.200
or outright ignored until he stopped being an LGBTQ icon?

07:01.200 --> 07:02.320
Then it was a betrayal.

07:02.320 --> 07:06.320
While Joker never got that treatment, Joker was treated not as a progressive ally, but

07:06.320 --> 07:08.320
as a totem for the incel problem.

07:08.320 --> 07:10.080
I think we can actually get the answer to that.

07:10.080 --> 07:12.800
Not from it or Joker, but from Star Wars.

07:12.800 --> 07:15.520
And I am going to have a lot to say about Star Wars in a future video.

07:15.520 --> 07:16.880
So this is just scratching the surface.

07:16.880 --> 07:18.160
But let's talk about this for a minute.

07:18.160 --> 07:22.960
I can't believe there's literally an explicitly anti-capitalist Star Wars movie.

07:22.960 --> 07:26.000
And these dudes hate it because women leader do stuff.

07:26.000 --> 07:27.360
Don't tell random man.

07:27.360 --> 07:28.240
And this is what I mean.

07:28.240 --> 07:32.000
It's not actually about the identification with evil or the identification with something

07:32.000 --> 07:33.760
bad or negative or whatever.

07:33.760 --> 07:38.000
It seems to me that the identification with evil is collateral damage.

07:38.000 --> 07:41.600
It's a side effect of sticking with your tribe.

07:41.600 --> 07:45.280
In this case, it doesn't matter that the new Star Wars movies are complete ass.

07:45.280 --> 07:47.440
What matters is that they're anti-capitalist.

07:47.440 --> 07:49.920
What matters is that they have women leaders in them.

07:49.920 --> 07:52.000
That's more important than their quality.

07:52.000 --> 07:55.280
We saw this with how they rallied around Ghostbusters 2016 as well.

07:55.280 --> 07:57.920
Or the She-Ra cartoon or whatever.

07:57.920 --> 07:59.840
There's countless examples of this happening.

07:59.840 --> 08:03.440
We can see that when Finn's actor spoke out against the most recent Star Wars movie,

08:03.440 --> 08:07.120
the radical lefties, at least over on the trash pile that is Reset Era,

08:07.120 --> 08:10.720
said stuff like really thought he was one of the good ones

08:10.720 --> 08:14.480
and liked him better when he kept his mouth shut and knew his place.

08:14.480 --> 08:18.880
These are comments that you expect to see from like openly racist KKK members

08:18.880 --> 08:20.720
or Stormfront users or something.

08:20.720 --> 08:26.000
Not from the supposedly anti-racist progressive virtue signaling radical left.

08:26.000 --> 08:31.440
In essence, when John Boyega decided to criticize Star Wars, he had left the tribe

08:31.440 --> 08:35.520
and it no longer mattered if he was good or evil, if he was right or wrong,

08:35.520 --> 08:38.720
if he was telling the truth or stating a falsehood.

08:38.720 --> 08:42.880
Here is the rule spelled out plainly by some Tumblr SJW.

08:42.880 --> 08:46.160
I love problematic male anti-hero characters,

08:46.160 --> 08:49.200
but there are limitations to how morally gray they can be.

08:49.920 --> 08:52.080
Like manipulating people and toying with them?

08:52.080 --> 08:52.720
Cool.

08:52.720 --> 08:54.080
Massacring entire cities?

08:54.080 --> 08:55.440
My precious child.

08:55.440 --> 08:57.360
Killing the heroine's closest friends?

08:57.360 --> 08:58.240
I love you.

08:58.240 --> 09:00.320
I'd die for you, my small son.

09:00.320 --> 09:04.640
But being transphobic, racist, homophobic, or sexist?

09:04.640 --> 09:05.520
Nice knowing you, bro.

09:05.520 --> 09:06.720
I hope you rot in hell.

09:06.720 --> 09:11.040
I mean, do you remember all those years of Yas Queen's sleigh when it come to Daenerys?

09:11.680 --> 09:15.440
Right up until she turned into a tyrant and then Jon Snow stabbed her?

09:15.440 --> 09:17.600
And then the reaction was a mix between

09:17.600 --> 09:21.360
Daenerys was never a feminist icon and Jon Snow did her dirty?

09:21.360 --> 09:25.280
What do you think they would have said if Daenerys had actually been successful?

09:26.240 --> 09:27.600
Because remember the rule.

09:27.600 --> 09:30.000
It didn't matter that she slaughtered an entire city.

09:30.000 --> 09:32.320
What matters is that her politics were correct.

09:32.320 --> 09:35.680
When your entire life philosophy is based on rebellion,

09:35.680 --> 09:38.640
not just necessarily rebellion when something becomes too corrupt,

09:38.640 --> 09:40.000
but senseless rebellion.

09:40.000 --> 09:42.080
Simply a rebellion for a rebellion's sake.

09:42.080 --> 09:46.560
Or maybe rebellion not as a means to reform a corrupted system,

09:46.560 --> 09:50.240
but to completely destroy it and leave people with nothing but ashes.

09:50.240 --> 09:53.120
And if you're a postmodernist, that is likely your point of view.

09:53.120 --> 09:57.520
Because the postmodernists believe that there is actually no difference between good and evil,

09:57.520 --> 09:59.360
that it's all simply power politics.

09:59.360 --> 10:04.080
It's just tribes struggling for eternal dominance, that all hierarchies must be corrupt,

10:04.080 --> 10:06.240
and therefore it's best to have your guys on top.

10:06.240 --> 10:11.280
If all morality is simply relative in the way that the postmodernists think that it is,

10:11.280 --> 10:16.000
then it's completely reasonable to identify with evil characters that hold your politics,

10:16.000 --> 10:17.760
because there is no evil.

10:17.760 --> 10:20.720
So Pennywise becomes an LGBTQ icon.

10:20.720 --> 10:24.640
Joker is evil not because of his actions, but because of what he represents politically.

10:24.640 --> 10:28.080
Daenerys was a tyrant building the empire of the good.

10:28.080 --> 10:33.680
And to get back to Oni's nice guy comic, our purple-haired self-insert character is good

10:33.680 --> 10:34.960
and right and just.

10:34.960 --> 10:38.720
Not because she's actually good, right, or just, she's actually the opposite of those things.

10:38.720 --> 10:40.960
But because her politics are correct.

10:40.960 --> 10:46.000
And the new guy standing in for universal tolerance is shunned,

10:46.000 --> 10:48.720
at least by the comic's author, despite being completely reasonable.

10:48.720 --> 10:52.720
And I am happy to report that the entire rest of the internet seems to see things the way that I do.

10:52.720 --> 10:56.960
Because everyone's recognized new guy, despite being the straw man that the author set up

10:56.960 --> 11:02.480
so that her author insert could destroy, as being the actual good person in this scenario.

11:02.480 --> 11:04.720
Because most people can actually recognize that,

11:05.520 --> 11:10.480
even if we don't have a good grasp of what morality is, and I know I certainly don't,

11:10.480 --> 11:15.120
there is at least something that is objectively good out there.

11:15.120 --> 11:19.600
I couldn't define it for you if you asked me, but I think I know it when I see it.

11:19.600 --> 11:21.760
I think this guy might be part of it.

11:21.760 --> 11:23.040
And so new guy is trending.

11:23.680 --> 11:28.160
And just like Lilith, I am happy that this unintentionally wholesome character

11:28.160 --> 11:29.920
gets to be the first meme of the decade.

11:29.920 --> 11:33.520
Not only do I want this to be a decade of wholesome goodness,

11:34.160 --> 11:35.920
not only in memes, but other places.

11:35.920 --> 11:40.080
But I also want wholesomeness to be the thing that we use to combat

11:40.080 --> 11:43.600
the doom and gloom of social justice going forward.

11:43.600 --> 11:47.520
Because at this point, the only narrative that the radical left has to offer people

11:47.520 --> 11:50.640
is that the sky is falling, even when it's clearly not.

11:50.640 --> 11:52.960
But yeah, new guy's gone viral.

11:52.960 --> 11:54.640
People are making comic edits.

11:54.640 --> 11:57.200
They're making their own wholesome fan arts.

11:57.200 --> 12:00.640
And you know, looking over these edits a second time now that I'm recording this video,

12:00.640 --> 12:04.560
I'm noticing that the original author really tried to make him look doofy.

12:04.560 --> 12:07.760
You know, he's overweight, he's bald, he has kind of a funny face.

12:07.760 --> 12:11.280
And yet all of these fan arts, they don't hide these facts.

12:11.280 --> 12:13.760
They just make him look as good as possible.

12:13.760 --> 12:16.480
He's putting his best foot forward in each one of these fan arts.

12:16.480 --> 12:18.160
Of course, I decided to go look up the artist just to see

12:18.160 --> 12:19.200
what they had been saying about it.

12:19.200 --> 12:21.040
And I am obviously blocked.

12:21.040 --> 12:24.240
Um, I've never heard of this person before this meme.

12:24.240 --> 12:26.160
I've certainly never tweeted at her before.

12:26.160 --> 12:28.960
I don't think she's ever heard of me, but nonetheless, I am blocked.

12:28.960 --> 12:31.760
Probably because I follow Lilith and Lilith was involved in the propagation

12:31.760 --> 12:32.960
of the meme or something.

12:32.960 --> 12:36.560
At the same time, this person's tweets are also protected.

12:37.120 --> 12:38.400
Surprise, surprise.

12:38.400 --> 12:42.720
Because when you set up a straw man in one of your own works of art,

12:42.720 --> 12:46.640
and even your self-insert can't knock over your straw man,

12:46.640 --> 12:49.120
and everyone agrees with the straw man over you.

12:49.840 --> 12:52.320
Yeah, I can see why you'd lock your Twitter account.

12:52.320 --> 12:56.240
Now, of course, you could have taken the Shen Comics bike cuck route

12:57.040 --> 13:00.400
and used it to expand her brand, promote herself,

13:00.400 --> 13:01.920
maybe become a little bit more humble,

13:01.920 --> 13:03.040
learn something along the way.

13:03.760 --> 13:06.400
But no, she's not doing that, in fact.

13:06.400 --> 13:08.480
But instead, when she first posts the comic, she says,

13:08.480 --> 13:11.280
Clutch's pearls, won't someone think of the millionaires?

13:11.280 --> 13:14.480
And then when Oni decides to repost it, she says,

13:14.480 --> 13:16.240
wow, my mentions are fucked.

13:16.240 --> 13:19.440
I guess having a bunch of piss babies call me ugly and horrible

13:19.440 --> 13:21.200
for the next few days is going to be a thing.

13:21.200 --> 13:25.200
You know, I haven't seen anyone call you ugly and horrible.

13:25.200 --> 13:27.360
Maybe they have, if they do.

13:27.360 --> 13:28.400
I don't think that's right.

13:28.400 --> 13:31.680
At the same time, it's not that you're ugly and horrible.

13:31.680 --> 13:34.160
It's that you're mean-spirited and cruel.

13:34.160 --> 13:37.040
Even some folks I follow are making fun of me.

13:37.040 --> 13:38.800
Yay, that feels nice.

13:39.360 --> 13:41.840
Maybe this is an opportunity for self-reflection.

13:41.840 --> 13:45.280
I'm not even saying give up social justice or anything,

13:45.280 --> 13:48.160
though, of course, you know, any SJW who gives up social justice,

13:48.160 --> 13:50.320
it's probably a good thing overall.

13:50.320 --> 13:51.600
But I'm not even saying that.

13:51.600 --> 13:56.160
I'm just saying maybe challenge your own opinions a little bit on this.

13:56.160 --> 13:59.360
But if you're a postmodernist, it's going to be very hard to do that,

13:59.360 --> 14:02.000
because the framework that you're tackling this from,

14:02.560 --> 14:05.200
as we can see by the content of your comics,

14:05.200 --> 14:07.280
is that there is no good or evil.

14:07.280 --> 14:11.840
There's only power politics, and it's your team versus their team.

14:11.840 --> 14:15.680
It's the SJWs versus the white supremacy capitalist patriarchy.

14:15.680 --> 14:18.160
And that anything that your enemy has that is good

14:18.720 --> 14:21.840
must be defined out of the good category.

14:21.840 --> 14:24.320
And that any evil that you might have within you

14:24.320 --> 14:27.680
have to be defined as good because you think your politics are good.

14:27.680 --> 14:31.600
That's the problem with postmodernism, and that's why you identify with evil.

14:31.600 --> 14:35.200
And now that everyone has noticed you identify with evil,

14:35.200 --> 14:37.760
that's why people that you follow are making fun of you.

14:38.480 --> 14:40.320
I know it doesn't feel nice.

14:40.320 --> 14:43.200
And I know that having some kind of self-reflection on this

14:43.200 --> 14:44.400
probably feels a lot worse.

14:44.960 --> 14:48.240
But you are always going to be the spiteful little girl

14:48.240 --> 14:50.400
in this bit of artwork that you've created,

14:50.400 --> 14:52.640
demonizing completely reasonable people,

14:53.200 --> 14:55.840
if you don't go through a process of self-reflection.

14:55.840 --> 14:58.880
And this is not just some armchair psychology here.

14:58.880 --> 15:01.680
Look at how she replies to people with legitimate criticisms about her,

15:01.680 --> 15:02.800
regarding this comic.

15:02.800 --> 15:04.640
I don't know what your other comics are like.

15:04.640 --> 15:07.520
I never even knew you existed until I saw Chris's post.

15:07.520 --> 15:10.560
But honestly, I think he just doesn't like the moral implications of the comic.

15:10.560 --> 15:13.040
I don't think he has any problem with LGBT people,

15:13.040 --> 15:14.640
since he has friends in the community.

15:14.640 --> 15:15.760
I don't hate you.

15:15.760 --> 15:17.920
Her only reply is a sarcastic,

15:17.920 --> 15:20.720
yeah, he's such a moral person, the next Jesus, really.

15:20.720 --> 15:24.000
There's no self-reflection here, just bitterness and rage.

15:24.000 --> 15:26.720
And just in case you think I'm also pulling stuff out of my ass

15:26.720 --> 15:29.280
regarding the moral side of this conversation as well,

15:29.280 --> 15:32.560
let me just show you two of our old comic strips here.

15:32.560 --> 15:36.000
This one seems quite old, based on the difference in art style.

15:36.000 --> 15:37.760
It says, jerk-ass coworker.

15:37.760 --> 15:42.240
And the coworker says, ugh, I am so sick of all this politically correct bullshit.

15:42.240 --> 15:45.680
Look at this, do we really need content warnings for pictures of food?

15:45.680 --> 15:49.120
And then the self-insert, who has red hair instead of purple hair now.

15:49.120 --> 15:52.000
She says, maybe it helps those who struggle with eating disorders.

15:52.080 --> 15:54.880
The coworker says, well, fuck that, I'm not going to coddle anyone.

15:54.880 --> 15:58.880
Our self-insert says, well, no one is forcing you to use the content warnings,

15:58.880 --> 16:00.640
but what's with the resentment towards this thing

16:00.640 --> 16:03.040
that is simply being considered other people's feelings?

16:03.040 --> 16:07.280
And then this comic's straw man says, I hate other people's feelings.

16:07.280 --> 16:10.400
The self-insert ends the comic with, and there we have it, folks.

16:10.400 --> 16:12.000
Now, in case you couldn't figure it out,

16:12.000 --> 16:15.280
this is a comic about people who are insensitive, rude,

16:15.280 --> 16:18.320
and generally uncaring about other people's points of view.

16:18.320 --> 16:19.520
Okay, fair enough.

16:19.520 --> 16:21.760
Here's a second comic by the same author.

16:22.480 --> 16:23.280
That'll be $25.

16:24.080 --> 16:25.680
So what are you up to today? Anything good?

16:26.320 --> 16:28.160
Oh, I'm just getting a drink with my girlfriend.

16:28.160 --> 16:29.840
Oh, hey, I'm gay too.

16:29.840 --> 16:31.840
So where are you and your girlfriend going to go?

16:31.840 --> 16:33.280
No, wait, I'm not gay.

16:33.280 --> 16:35.600
My friend who's a girl and I are just having a ladies' night.

16:36.400 --> 16:39.920
Okay, well, sorry, but that is infinitely less interesting to me.

16:39.920 --> 16:45.120
You can see that the positions and attitudes of the author insert and the straw man

16:45.120 --> 16:48.800
have completely gone on a 180 between this strip and the previous one.

16:48.800 --> 16:51.920
She has now completely gone against the previous strip's moral,

16:51.920 --> 16:55.040
and yet we're still expected to side with our author insert

16:55.040 --> 16:58.800
and completely disregard the previous definition of what was morally superior,

16:58.800 --> 17:02.480
because her point of view, her politics, are right.

17:02.480 --> 17:06.480
And of course, now that New Guy is a meme, everyone's blaming Oni for it.

17:06.480 --> 17:12.080
45,000 fucking tweets dogpiling a trans person for doing fucking nothing

17:12.080 --> 17:15.120
just because Oni NG thought he'd parade her in front of his audience

17:15.120 --> 17:18.320
of 300,000 pieces of shit for a fucking laugh.

17:18.320 --> 17:22.400
See, I have not mentioned in this video at all, up until this point,

17:23.120 --> 17:27.520
that the author of the comic was trans, because it's not relevant.

17:27.520 --> 17:31.440
And frankly, until I found this tweet that we're looking at right now,

17:31.440 --> 17:33.120
I didn't know she was trans.

17:33.120 --> 17:37.840
The fact that she is a trans person doesn't actually matter.

17:37.840 --> 17:40.400
Being a member of a minority group, whether that's a racial minority

17:40.400 --> 17:42.720
or being trans or being gay or something,

17:42.720 --> 17:45.840
it does not excuse you from having a shit personality.

17:45.840 --> 17:48.960
But to this person, only the trans thing matters.

17:49.600 --> 17:52.400
It doesn't matter what she's done, it doesn't matter what she thinks,

17:52.400 --> 17:54.320
it doesn't matter what opinions she holds,

17:54.320 --> 17:56.320
it doesn't matter that she identifies with evil,

17:56.320 --> 17:59.920
insofar as she dies in terms of this silly little comic.

17:59.920 --> 18:02.560
What matters is that she's part of the tribe.

18:02.560 --> 18:04.800
And these people inherently understand this, I think.

18:04.800 --> 18:08.800
They understand that the co-opting of New Guy and turning him into

18:08.800 --> 18:13.920
a symbol of wholeness or positivity is damaging to their point of view.

18:13.920 --> 18:15.680
So, you know, this person says,

18:15.680 --> 18:19.280
if I see anyone making a New Guy comic putting the New Guy in a positive light,

18:19.280 --> 18:20.560
I am blocking them immediately.

18:21.360 --> 18:26.000
It's not about putting the author insert or the original author in a negative light,

18:26.000 --> 18:29.920
but putting the New Guy in a positive light is the problem.

18:29.920 --> 18:32.640
The spreading of the positivity is itself an affront.

18:33.360 --> 18:38.160
Alright, Miss Mallory Jessica Ushidas, I don't know you.

18:38.160 --> 18:40.160
I highly doubt you're going to watch this video.

18:40.160 --> 18:43.280
And even though you would probably hate me, I certainly don't hate you.

18:43.920 --> 18:48.560
And I'm not going to pretend that you're currently going through a positive experience.

18:49.280 --> 18:55.520
But unless you understand that on some level your own toxicity brought this on,

18:55.520 --> 18:57.520
then your situation is never going to change.

18:57.520 --> 18:59.840
I'm not saying that those who are currently dogpiling you,

18:59.840 --> 19:03.360
if that's what's actually happening, aren't responsible for their own actions.

19:03.360 --> 19:03.860
They are.

19:04.480 --> 19:06.640
But you're responsible for yours too.

19:06.640 --> 19:10.000
And this is definitely a reaping what you sow scenario.

19:10.000 --> 19:14.880
I'm not going to be so naive to say that if you go through life offering kindness,

19:14.880 --> 19:16.560
you'll just get kindness in return.

19:16.560 --> 19:17.920
That's not how it is.

19:17.920 --> 19:23.200
But I will say that if you go through life offering the level of nastiness

19:23.200 --> 19:26.560
that you seem to have been offering throughout this entire video,

19:26.560 --> 19:29.120
you will get nothing but nastiness in return.

19:29.120 --> 19:33.280
And I don't know about you, but having bad stuff happen to you sometimes

19:33.280 --> 19:36.320
is better than having bad stuff happen to you all the time.
