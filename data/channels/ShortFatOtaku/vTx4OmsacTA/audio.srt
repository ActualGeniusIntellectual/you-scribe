00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,360
Hello friends, sorry for the dearth of content.

2
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:12,280
I think I just need to come to terms with the fact that sometimes I just get pretty

3
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:13,560
bad writer's block.

4
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:18,380
I'm currently sitting on a half-finished analysis of market socialism, I've attempted to write

5
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:20,880
something on the don't say gay bill, it's just...

6
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:25,360
I've tried to do a lot of things and it just hasn't come out the greatest.

7
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:31,080
Maybe I just need like regular time off because I spend a lot of time trying to work.

8
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:34,480
Maybe I need to spend more time streaming video games or something.

9
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:38,200
Actually if you watch this on release I'll be streaming games right now, it's time for

10
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:42,400
the Saturday morning show so hey, make sure you drop by the gaming channel literally after

11
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:44,080
this video and come say hi.

12
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:49,760
But this morning when I was eating breakfast I was watching this stupid video, taking responsibility

13
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:53,840
for systemic racism, the problem with Jon Stewart, oh boy.

14
00:00:53,840 --> 00:01:00,140
And I realized I kind of had to react to it because it got the old creative juices

15
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:01,220
flowing again.

16
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:04,640
I know there's at least a few creative types in my audience, you know how it is when you're

17
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:08,840
stuck in a rut for a while and then you see something and you're like oh my god and it

18
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:11,860
kind of kickstarts your brain again, that's what I feel like right now.

19
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:13,640
So let's check this nonsense out.

20
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:19,320
An episode about race, focusing on black issues, you'd want to connect with the Cornell West,

21
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:47,840
You know, I sometimes still don't mind Jon Stewart's humor, I have a feeling it's gonna

22
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:51,600
get a whole lot worse, but I mean that made me chuckle a little bit.

23
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:57,780
At La Salle University, he researches social inequality and race, Lisa Bond, the resident

24
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:01,560
white woman for Race to Dinner, a group that is trying to have better conversations about

25
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:02,840
race in America.

26
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:06,760
And joining remotely, longtime author and columnist Andrew Sullivan, editor of The Weekly

27
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:07,760
Dish.

28
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,880
Welcome everybody, thanks so much for joining us.

29
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:17,480
Here's what I think holds back our race conversation in America.

30
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:25,440
I think at its core, I think white people put blame on black people for the position

31
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,440
that they are in.

32
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:32,440
Hold on Jon, hold back the conversation on race in America.

33
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:34,580
What conversation is being held back?

34
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:36,960
We have these conversations all the time.

35
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:41,720
Our entire culture is inundated with these conversations right now Jon.

36
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:47,440
It's online, it's in schools, it's on the news, it's in our entertainment media, movies

37
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,240
games, shows, whatever it is.

38
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:53,400
At this point, the left, the progressives, they've won the culture war.

39
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:58,120
A significant amount of white people in the United States of America see race relations

40
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:00,320
through a colorblind lens.

41
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:05,160
And I don't mean that whites don't see race, they see someone that's black or Asian, but

42
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:10,680
they don't in any way attach any meaning to the color in affecting life chances.

43
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:14,800
And what that fundamentally means is that race doesn't matter in getting ahead.

44
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:15,800
It just doesn't matter.

45
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:19,160
We believe that we are in a race neutral environment.

46
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:23,880
The playing field has been leveled, and if you make it, or you don't-

47
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:24,880
It's a meritocracy.

48
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:27,680
It's a meritocracy, and it's a narrative also that does a lot of things.

49
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:31,760
It makes white privilege invisible, and it also-

50
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:32,760
Hold on, hold on.

51
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:38,040
So, first of all, that is in fact the attitude we should have, because that is in fact the

52
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:40,760
world that we should be striving towards.

53
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:42,880
Otherwise you are legitimately a racist.

54
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:44,920
And moreover, you're talking about white privilege.

55
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:52,120
The ideology of white privilege, academically, it's an ideology of the rich.

56
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:55,760
You know what kind of people are learning about this stuff and thinking this way?

57
00:03:55,760 --> 00:04:00,320
The people who are bought into the white privilege narrative, these are university students.

58
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:02,480
These are upper class people, sometimes middle class people.

59
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:06,360
These are people who can afford to go to universities and be inculcated with this garbage.

60
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:10,600
The working class, like broke white people, they are the least likely to believe in the

61
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:14,760
concept of white privilege, because they are some of the people least likely to have privilege

62
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:15,760
at all.

63
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:20,720
Are you seriously going to sit here and yell and lecture at some working class Republican

64
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:25,800
guy who's never really left his hometown, who's making $25,000 a year at a menial job

65
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:30,200
that just got shipped overseas, and the only help he's getting from anybody is an oxy prescription

66
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,200
from his doctor?

67
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:34,060
Are you going to tell him that he's benefiting from white privilege?

68
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:39,160
This is a completely unrealistic way to look at the real lives of people.

69
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:43,140
When we talk about racism, we're talking about your character flaw.

70
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:45,820
If we say you're racist, it's a character flaw.

71
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:46,820
I'm bad.

72
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:47,820
I know I'm not bad.

73
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:49,380
I think I'm a good person.

74
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:51,260
I think I'm a nice person.

75
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:54,100
I know that I am racist.

76
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:56,100
I know that I'm racist.

77
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:58,100
Oh, God.

78
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:00,140
Oh, God.

79
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:01,140
Okay.

80
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:06,820
I want you to keep in mind for a little bit later that whole ... When I think of racism,

81
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:10,420
we think of character flaws, because that's true.

82
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:13,920
If you're a normie and you're using the term racist, like, that guy's racist, you're describing

83
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:16,920
a character flaw in that other person.

84
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:21,580
It's meant to be used as a negative word, but at this point ... Here, I'll watch this

85
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:22,580
a little bit more.

86
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:28,900
Just because I, every single day, uphold the systems and the structures of racism.

87
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:29,900
Right.

88
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:34,380
That's not a character flaw anymore, upholding the systems and the structures of racism,

89
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:35,380
whatever the fuck that means.

90
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:37,020
That's not a character flaw anymore.

91
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:40,300
So let's ask the question.

92
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:41,300
What is racism?

93
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:42,300
Okay.

94
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:44,380
Well, I think everyone would agree.

95
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:49,260
If you're going to do something bigoted towards a black person, that's going to be a racist

96
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:50,260
act.

97
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:51,260
That's racism.

98
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:52,260
Okay.

99
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:55,860
You see a black person, you hate him because he's black, and you throw stuff at him, or

100
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:58,700
you burn the cross on his front lawn or whatever the fuck it is.

101
00:05:58,700 --> 00:05:59,700
That's racism.

102
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:00,700
Okay.

103
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:01,700
Well, what's the next level of racism?

104
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:02,900
Well, it's when you think bigoted thoughts.

105
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:03,900
Okay.

106
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:06,460
You're not really hurting anybody, but you have the wrong mindset.

107
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:07,580
The thought police is going to come after you.

108
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:08,580
You're thinking bigoted thoughts.

109
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:09,580
Okay.

110
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:10,580
It's racism.

111
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:14,780
What about when you vote for a bigot, or you vote for somebody who might implement bigoted

112
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:15,780
policies?

113
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:16,780
Okay.

114
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:17,780
You can probably call it racist too.

115
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:18,780
All right.

116
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:19,780
It's getting a little bit muddier here, but fine.

117
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:23,740
How about if you're part of a group that is considered to have bigoted views?

118
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:26,900
So let's say that you're not a bigot, but you join a political party full of bigots,

119
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:30,020
or you join a club full of bigots, but you're not actually a bigot yourself.

120
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:36,340
Well, why are you using your legitimacy as an agent, as a political agent, to support

121
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:37,340
this group?

122
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:38,340
Okay.

123
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:39,980
Well, I mean, now we're getting pretty far removed, but fair enough.

124
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:41,500
I can see how that could be racism.

125
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:46,780
And then what if racism is when your class of people, your group, is considered the beneficiaries

126
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:49,580
of past bigotry, even though none of you are bigoted today?

127
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:54,260
Well, that doesn't really make you racist, but there's still an aggrieved party, and

128
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:56,660
you're still benefiting from it, even if you don't know about it.

129
00:06:56,660 --> 00:07:00,300
So like, okay, we're very far removed here, but okay.

130
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:03,100
You could, if you really squint your eyes, see that to be racism.

131
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:04,100
Okay.

132
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:07,780
Let's say you go down to the shop, and you buy from that business, and the business is

133
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:11,580
owned by a white person, and that white person has probably enjoyed some kind of intergenerational

134
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:15,940
wealth, to the point that maybe like five generations back, they had racist parents,

135
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:19,260
and those racist parents benefited in some way from their racism, and now that's been

136
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:23,220
passed on and snowballed, so that this white person today can now buy a business, and then

137
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:26,540
you shop there, so now you're complicit in that crime.

138
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:33,720
You can lay out a logically consistent argument as to why everything is a white supremacy,

139
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,640
but it is so far flung.

140
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:37,320
It's so spun out of control.

141
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:43,000
It's so ridiculous, the depths at which you have to reach to call it a white supremacy,

142
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,820
and then turn around and say, well, being racist is a character flaw.

143
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:48,040
It's like, really?

144
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:53,160
So because I bought from a white owned business, and I didn't know that five generations back,

145
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:56,820
his family benefited from racism, and that tiny benefit snowballed over the course of

146
00:07:56,820 --> 00:08:00,500
five generations to let him build his business, and I'm buying from it.

147
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:01,720
That's a character flaw in me?

148
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:06,160
Like it becomes ridiculous, the notions these people have about race.

149
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:10,940
And if we don't start having a conversation about that, and about the ways that we are

150
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:17,840
complicit every day, daily, if we don't talk about it, then we are never going to see movement.

151
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:20,780
Andrew, do you think?

152
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:27,320
We've been talking about it for years, for decades, for fuck's sake, like, where's the

153
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:28,320
movement?

154
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:34,080
You won the culture war, we talk about it all the fucking time, we can't talk about

155
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:39,920
it enough for some fucking people, you hold all the reins of power, there are left-leaning

156
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:44,840
people in government, there are left-leaning people in these various cultural institutions,

157
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:48,560
like, whose fucking fault is it that there's no change?

158
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:52,920
Your average conservative nowadays is sitting at home, getting high and jacking off to trap

159
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:53,920
porn.

160
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:57,140
Like, they're not fucking doing anything, they're not engaged in the political process

161
00:08:57,140 --> 00:08:58,140
right now.

162
00:08:58,140 --> 00:08:59,140
It's all on you.

163
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:05,660
We know this country is, for example, a white supremacy, well, I don't believe that.

164
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:11,020
I think it's possibly the most absurd hyperbole I've ever heard.

165
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:14,900
I come from, I'm an immigrant, so I have a slightly different view of this.

166
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:22,380
I can tell you, America, in Twitter- Look at how angry she is, look at that face, she's

167
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:24,220
barely tolerating it.

168
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:28,940
I don't think this woman's ever, like, been told a no in her life.

169
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:31,020
America didn't start that way for black people.

170
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:32,700
They didn't immigrate here.

171
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:38,020
They were living somewhere else and they were kidnapped and raped and murdered and taken

172
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:39,020
here.

173
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:44,820
And so for you to just say this is a magnificent place that doesn't have racism is actually,

174
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:49,420
I think, more of a foundational lie than anything else.

175
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:52,940
I didn't say that.

176
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:53,940
Everyone clap.

177
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:54,940
I clapped.

178
00:09:54,940 --> 00:10:00,500
Okay, so what John is saying is technically correct, but it also doesn't help the conversation

179
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:07,380
because it's true that these things existed, but are there still fucking slaves?

180
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:09,660
Is Jim Crow still in force?

181
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:12,620
Is this not the best time in history?

182
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:14,900
Have we not made things better?

183
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:22,300
For all of the sins of our past, do we not get a shred, a crumb of anything for having

184
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:24,180
actually done the right thing?

185
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:26,780
I'm not saying that you need to sit here and treat us like white saviors or anything.

186
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:30,900
I'm not saying that, but like, but if you're going to treat all white people like they're

187
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:36,260
slave masters, even when they ended slavery, you're just going to treat them the same way

188
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:37,880
any way.

189
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:39,540
Why should anyone tolerate that?

190
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:43,220
Why should anyone tolerate being your eternal whipping boy?

191
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:46,660
You said that it's the most hyperbole.

192
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:51,660
I said the term white supremacy is an absurd hyperbole.

193
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:54,300
For most people, that means the KKK.

194
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:59,960
It means no rights for minorities, and this has been used simply to avoid in our arguments.

195
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:04,420
Let's take a step back and let's define what we mean by white supremacy.

196
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:10,420
When you say white supremacy, how are you defining it for this conversation?

197
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:15,860
When I talk about white supremacy and when I talk about racism, I'm talking about power

198
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:16,860
and privilege.

199
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:20,380
The power and privilege that we hold as white people in society.

200
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:28,340
The way in which our structures, our institutions, our systems, how everything was designed

201
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:31,980
with white people in mind and only white people in mind.

202
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:32,980
Oh God.

203
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:33,980
Okay.

204
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:34,980
So let's see.

205
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:37,480
You want me to bust out my old gender studies and critical theory texts?

206
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:41,540
I could explain to you how these people view our society as a white supremacist society.

207
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:46,540
It's going to rely on something like how we had legitimately white privileging policies

208
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:50,900
in the past, a few which I think John actually lays out later in the video.

209
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:51,900
Redlining neighborhoods.

210
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:58,180
That was a state enforced thing from Jim Crow, which is the one point at which I think absolutely

211
00:11:58,180 --> 00:11:59,180
is true.

212
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:01,740
So you just said it doesn't exist except for that.

213
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:03,620
No, no, no, no, no.

214
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:07,940
I said white supremacy doesn't exist.

215
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:10,020
When the new deal was passed, right?

216
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:15,200
When the new deal was passed, black people were explicitly not allowed to have those

217
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,200
loans.

218
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:22,000
The homestead act allowed white people to get an enormous wealth of land and be able

219
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
to farm it.

220
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,480
Black people did not have access to that.

221
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:30,740
So when slaves were freed, when social security came, black people, when the GI bill black

222
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:31,740
people were not.

223
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:36,020
And how the snowballing effects of those things continue to contribute to what you might call

224
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:38,300
an unfair disparity today.

225
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:42,680
The issue is that we're talking about three different types of racism.

226
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:43,680
Okay.

227
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,440
There's like level one is like overt racism.

228
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:46,440
That's when you're just a racist.

229
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:47,440
All right.

230
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,880
That's when you are saying black people can't come into my shop.

231
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:51,480
That's when you're, you're a slave owner.

232
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:54,860
That's when you're attacking black people simply for existing in public and being black

233
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:55,860
like overt racism.

234
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:56,860
Okay.

235
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:58,040
Pretty much everybody in the Western world at this point agrees.

236
00:12:58,040 --> 00:12:59,040
That's bad.

237
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,040
Okay.

238
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:01,780
Like that the, the fight against overt racism is over.

239
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:06,300
Secondly, there is systemic racism and there's a lack of understanding regarding everybody

240
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:07,600
when it comes to systemic racism.

241
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:14,160
So for example, you could have systemic racism where even though the officer implementing

242
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:19,080
the policy, his himself, not a racist, he's looking at the law and the law says, well,

243
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:21,240
you have to treat black people differently in some way.

244
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:22,800
And he goes, my hands are tied, dude.

245
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,680
I don't want to do this, but I have to.

246
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:28,000
That's a systemic racism because it comes from a system, but it's not the only form

247
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
of systemic racism.

248
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
It's not the only form.

249
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:36,760
There's another form where for example, you could look at the trends of various racial

250
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:42,980
groups in a society, and then you could pick out certain behaviors that overwhelmingly

251
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:48,200
only one group actually engages in and then criminalize those behaviors.

252
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:53,080
The obvious example being used is crack versus powder cocaine, where because more black people

253
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:56,940
use crack cocaine, it would, the punishments associated with it were made significantly

254
00:13:56,940 --> 00:13:57,940
higher in the past.

255
00:13:57,940 --> 00:14:01,240
I think they still are actually in the States, which is a little bit fucked up, but the point

256
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:05,820
being is that nothing in the law says that you must treat certain races a certain way,

257
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:11,560
but rather they write the laws such that certain behaviors that are committed by certain races

258
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:18,240
are more illegal or say more heavily punished than other behaviors that might also be bad.

259
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:21,060
So that's kind of like a tricky way of getting around it.

260
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:24,600
And the third thing, this is what most people on the left call systemic racism.

261
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:25,600
It's not.

262
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:26,920
This is lingering racism.

263
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:31,120
This is just the after effects of previously abolished racism.

264
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:34,640
So for example, you might have a living playing field in a certain neighborhood between blacks

265
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:39,560
and whites, but because white families have had several more generations of intergenerational

266
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:43,440
wealth to build up as parents die and pass on their wealth to their kids, and then that

267
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:48,120
snowballs forward through time, black people, they, they had to start that process a little

268
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,960
bit later due to historic injustices.

269
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:52,480
And so now they're a little bit behind the game.

270
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:53,800
That's lingering racism.

271
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:58,280
The lingering racism is the fault of nobody today.

272
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:03,260
The issue with lingering racism is that even if there's no perpetrator, it's, it can still

273
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:08,720
be a problem sometimes, but what's going on here is that this woman is conflating all

274
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:15,160
of it into one thing, but you think it's purposeful, Andrew, would your argument be

275
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:21,560
that you don't see when she says it's purposeful, she's appealing to that idea that it's a character

276
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:23,040
flaw.

277
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:27,580
And yet that it doesn't, it doesn't make sense when we're talking about systemic racism.

278
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:31,320
It really doesn't make sense when we're talking about lingering racism that it's purposeful.

279
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:37,620
It's like, what, what is it purposeful on, on my behalf that a black person down the

280
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:41,380
street has some kind of problem based on something that happened five or six generations

281
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:42,380
ago?

282
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:43,880
Like, is it, how is that purposeful?

283
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:46,260
The truth is that it's actually not purposeful.

284
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:50,960
That's just a really easy way to bludgeon white people over the head with this shit

285
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:52,700
repeatedly to get them to comply.

286
00:15:52,700 --> 00:16:01,140
This anti-white extremism is losing popular support, is creating a backlash, is going

287
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:04,700
to elect Republicans and undo a lot of the good you think you're doing.

288
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:07,180
This is what happens when you don't talk about it.

289
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:12,780
This is what happens when white people don't talk about it is you have racist dog whistle

290
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:17,060
tropes like this that actually perpetuate and perpetuate and perpetuate.

291
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:19,740
Jesus Christ lady.

292
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:20,740
I was right.

293
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:23,500
She is not used to ever getting any pushback.

294
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:25,660
Like, look how angry she is.

295
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:29,700
This is, this is literally, I want to speak to your manager right now.

296
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:30,740
Show the fuck out Karen.

297
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:31,740
It's okay.

298
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:39,060
So I am, I, I, and I did not come on this, on this show to sit here and argue with another

299
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:40,060
white man.

300
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:46,780
That's one of the reasons that we don't even engage with white men at race to dinner.

301
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:48,260
She just piecing out.

302
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:49,260
Okay.

303
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:52,140
So, so here's, this is ridiculous.

304
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:53,140
Here's what I mean.

305
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:56,420
So we have these three types of racism, overt systemic lingering.

306
00:16:56,420 --> 00:16:57,420
All right.

307
00:16:57,420 --> 00:17:01,900
So what progressives like to do is they will squish them all together such that if you

308
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:07,500
are a beneficiary of some lingering racism, even, even not knowing that you are, that's

309
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:13,340
the same as throwing on the KKK hood and you know, lynching black people or something like

310
00:17:13,340 --> 00:17:14,540
it's, it's a ridiculous notion.

311
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:17,100
It's a, it's a completely like brain dead notion.

312
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:21,500
Racism is also a character flaw, which when it is it's over at racism, it is a character

313
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:22,500
flaw.

314
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:28,660
But if you are simply moving through life, normally not hurting anybody, not doing anything

315
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:35,740
wrong, you unknowingly somehow through some very esoteric chain of events benefit from

316
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:38,620
some historic past and justice that's racist.

317
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:42,420
And that's a character flaw against you, which is why these people are constantly apologizing

318
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:44,740
for things that they never even did.

319
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:48,860
It's it's such self-flagellation it's it's ridiculous.

320
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:50,500
And they expect everyone to do this.

321
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:54,700
It's I think the most toxic way to talk about race.

322
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:57,720
It's it's equal to the, to the overt racists.

323
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:59,540
It's just as fucking bad.

324
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:00,540
White men.

325
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:01,540
We're going to do something about racism.

326
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:02,540
Yeah.

327
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:03,540
Had 400 years.

328
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:08,220
Y'all could have done.

329
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:10,220
Are there still slaves lady?

330
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:12,560
I don't ask this before.

331
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:13,560
Are there still slaves?

332
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:15,800
Is Jim Crow still in force of us?

333
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:16,800
White people do this.

334
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:18,820
I don't care if we say we're abolitionists.

335
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:20,660
I don't care if we say we're progressive.

336
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:24,900
I don't care if we're literally members of the KKK, KKK, KKK.

337
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:29,220
Every single white person upholds these systems and structures of white supremacy.

338
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:33,100
And we have got to talk about it.

339
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:34,980
She sounds very much like Anita Sarkeesian there.

340
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:38,820
I like how I pause it on the applause before the applause came in.

341
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:40,100
Everyone's soy clap.

342
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:41,100
Everyone's soy clap.

343
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:46,060
Now listen, she sounds like Anita Sarkeesian saying you have to point it all out.

344
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:52,940
If it takes extra time and extra energy out of my day to really try hard to be a progressive

345
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:58,800
as opposed to say a normie, and you're just going to call me a member of the KKK anyway,

346
00:18:58,800 --> 00:18:59,900
why the fuck would I do it?

347
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:03,220
Why wouldn't I just say, well, fuck you then?

348
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:04,740
I don't care about your moral righteousness.

349
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:06,100
I don't care what you're slandering with.

350
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:08,300
I'm going to go do something else with my time.

351
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:14,980
I think the first thing that we need to understand is that all of us white people have a responsibility

352
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:18,420
to engage in these conversations regularly.

353
00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:21,060
But when it gets hot like this, what do you do?

354
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:22,060
How do you back out of that?

355
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:23,060
Hold on, dude.

356
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:24,060
Hold on.

357
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:25,060
Hold on.

358
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:26,060
Hold on.

359
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:27,060
This is not a hot conversation.

360
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:29,020
John needs to get in on some internet blood sports or something.

361
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:31,620
I don't think he knows what a hot conversation is, but it's like I said before, we've been

362
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:33,940
having these conversations for decades, lady.

363
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:35,660
What has your talk done?

364
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:39,620
As you sit here and talk about it and say, we've got to have conversations and I got

365
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:42,940
to be able to browbeat even more people and I got to be able to call even more people

366
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:47,940
racist, people like you directly vote and support policies that make the situation that

367
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:49,820
you're complaining about a little bit worse.

368
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:55,780
Like, for example, defunding the police that makes situations in black communities worse.

369
00:19:55,780 --> 00:20:00,120
Or it's at the same time, you're also voting for various city policies that don't allow

370
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:03,380
people to build new low income housing in your neighborhood.

371
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:07,700
To be honest, you help with the removal of opportunities for people to independently

372
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:12,860
stand on their own two feet through a massive expansion of the welfare state to the point

373
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:17,860
that it stops being like a good idea and it turns into a situation where people are

374
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:22,700
incentivized to not stand on their own two feet, but instead simply live off welfare.

375
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:24,540
And nobody wants to live off welfare.

376
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:29,060
Nobody just wants to accept handouts from the government to be told this is your ration.

377
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:30,060
This is all that you get.

378
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:31,060
People want independence.

379
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:32,060
They want freedom.

380
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:36,900
They don't, they don't want a measured proportion of what some authority says that this is what

381
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:37,900
you deserve.

382
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:43,980
I think women like this just want to talk about these things in perpetuity and never

383
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:44,980
do anything.

384
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:50,620
And in fact, do things that make it worse, just so that they can continuously feel good

385
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:51,620
about themselves.

386
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:55,120
And if they happen to work for one of these progressive foundations or institutions, keep

387
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:58,740
on raking in money for giving absolutely nothing to society.

388
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:03,660
I think figuring out a way to help black kids have a stable family.

389
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:05,140
The truth is it's true.

390
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:06,140
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

391
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:07,180
Hold on.

392
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:08,180
Hold on.

393
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:09,180
Is she shaking her head here?

394
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:10,180
She's shaking her head here.

395
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:11,180
Hold on.

396
00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:12,180
Lady, what are you shaking your fucking head about here?

397
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:18,300
I'm pretty sure that the disintegration of the black family is a pretty big problem.

398
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:19,300
And you know what?

399
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:23,260
It might even be part of that lingering racism that I defined earlier.

400
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:24,260
Who the fuck?

401
00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:25,260
Who the fuck is this person?

402
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:26,260
Hold on.

403
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:27,260
Overcome.

404
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:29,260
And I'll start with Chip.

405
00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:34,060
Quality and race, Lisa Bond, the resident white woman for Race to Dinner, a group that

406
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:36,520
is trying to have better conversations about race in America.

407
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:37,520
Race to Dinner.

408
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:38,520
Okay.

409
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:42,020
He was dropping on Race to Dinner's anti-racist dinner parties.

410
00:21:42,020 --> 00:21:45,020
Let's check out some of these.

411
00:21:45,020 --> 00:21:46,020
Here's the Instagram.

412
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:50,780
It's a product and a service radically honest.

413
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:52,860
I think I remember these people.

414
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:54,020
Yes.

415
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:59,100
Why liberal white women pay a lot of money to learn over dinner how they're racist.

416
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:03,360
A growing number of women are paying to confront their privilege and racism at dinners that

417
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:05,400
cost $2,500.

418
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:11,780
You white women, I remember I did a video on this or something years ago.

419
00:22:11,780 --> 00:22:19,800
White women will pay to have dinner with non-white women who lecture to them about how terrible

420
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:21,900
they are.

421
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:23,200
The whole dinner.

422
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:25,160
I remember this.

423
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:29,720
Two entrepreneurs have built a business dredging up white women's shame.

424
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:31,120
Oh my God.

425
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:33,360
That's who this fucking person is.

426
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:34,360
Okay.

427
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:36,280
This is where she's from.

428
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:37,280
Okay.

429
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:38,280
I understand.

430
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:41,360
Now I understand where the fuck all this insanity is coming from.

431
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:46,360
I think the worst part here though is Jon Stewart himself.

432
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:51,620
He's literally doing to the race conversation and progressive conversations in the United

433
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:52,760
States.

434
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:58,920
What he complained about on Crossfire when he walked onto that show back in the 2000s

435
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:01,080
and single-handedly destroyed it.

436
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:03,520
I don't know if you guys remember that controversy.

437
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:09,220
Crossfire was basically a debate show hosted on CNN where you had a left-leaning pundit

438
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:12,520
and a right-leaning pundit debating various news topics.

439
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:16,760
And Jon Stewart showed up here, I found it October 15th, 2004.

440
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:21,540
He showed up on the program and basically single-handedly destroyed it.

441
00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:25,840
I made a special effort to come on the show today because I have privately amongst my

442
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:31,960
friends and also in occasional newspapers and television shows mentioned this show as

443
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:36,960
being bad.

444
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:41,320
And I wanted to, I felt that that wasn't fair and I should come here and tell you that it's

445
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:46,220
not so much that it's bad as it's hurting America.

446
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:53,440
So I wanted to come here today and say, here's just what I wanted to tell you guys.

447
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:59,760
Stop, stop, stop, stop hurting America.

448
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:06,720
And come work for us because we, as the people, the people, not well, but you can sleep at

449
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:07,720
night.

450
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:11,680
See, the thing is, we need your help.

451
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:16,440
Right now you're helping the politicians and the corporations and we're left out there

452
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:17,440
to mow our lawns.

453
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:18,760
You just said we're too rough on them when they make mistakes.

454
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:20,200
No, no, no, you're not too rough on them.

455
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:22,920
You are part of their strategies.

456
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:24,840
You're partisan.

457
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:25,840
What do you call it?

458
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:26,840
Hacks.

459
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:31,000
I actually remember watching this live when it happened because I know I'm that old, but,

460
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:35,180
but a few months later, CNN canceled it because Jon Stewart had basically destroyed the reputation

461
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:36,400
of that program.

462
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:43,480
And now here he is on his own show doing the same thing that they did having really terrible

463
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:49,320
surface level conversations with the absolute worst individuals to actually have these conversations

464
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:53,040
with and actively ruining the discourse in the process.

465
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:57,140
Like with this guy up here in the monitor says he was the guy who was against the rest

466
00:24:57,140 --> 00:24:58,140
of them.

467
00:24:58,140 --> 00:25:02,660
He was saying some things that were a bit off the wall, but not anything too far from

468
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:06,760
what most normal politically unengaged Americans think.

469
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:10,680
It's like, Hey, I'm not a white supremacist like these, like these people without any

470
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:13,800
kind of like academic definitions on their side or anything, they're just thinking, I

471
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:14,800
mean, slavery was bad.

472
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:15,800
I'm not a white supremacist.

473
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:16,800
I don't do any of that shit.

474
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:17,800
I'm just getting on with my life.

475
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:19,840
And yeah, that's the way that a normal person should view it.

476
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:24,580
And they're just like lambasting him, like he's some kind of fucking racist and it's,

477
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:25,580
it's insane.

478
00:25:25,580 --> 00:25:26,580
It's, it's terrible.

479
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:28,480
This, this, this whole thing's been fucking cancer.

480
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:33,240
Jon Stewart used to actually be able to engage in sometimes decent conversation.

481
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:34,960
I don't know what the fuck happened.

482
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:39,000
I think, I think he basically just fell off like everyone else on the left has recently.

483
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:45,160
They all think that having a real conversation about real issues has to simply be an opportunity

484
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:47,320
for you to show how good you are.

485
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:49,720
And none of that helps anyone.

486
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:56,720
Not being able to distinguish between real racists and tea partiers or real bigots and

487
00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:04,560
Juan Williams or Rick Sanchez is an insult, not only to those people, but to the racist

488
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:10,040
themselves who have put in the exhausting effort it takes to hate.

489
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:13,680
If I could finger snap, I would finger snap right now.

490
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:15,640
Uh, let's remove it then from the-

491
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:18,240
Well you'd be finger snapping without calling me a racist, Jon.

492
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:22,480
Let's, let's, you're, you've been doing a pretty good job with it yourself there, so.
