0	8360	Hello friends, sorry for the dearth of content.
8360	12280	I think I just need to come to terms with the fact that sometimes I just get pretty
12280	13560	bad writer's block.
13560	18380	I'm currently sitting on a half-finished analysis of market socialism, I've attempted to write
18380	20880	something on the don't say gay bill, it's just...
20880	25360	I've tried to do a lot of things and it just hasn't come out the greatest.
25360	31080	Maybe I just need like regular time off because I spend a lot of time trying to work.
31080	34480	Maybe I need to spend more time streaming video games or something.
34480	38200	Actually if you watch this on release I'll be streaming games right now, it's time for
38200	42400	the Saturday morning show so hey, make sure you drop by the gaming channel literally after
42400	44080	this video and come say hi.
44080	49760	But this morning when I was eating breakfast I was watching this stupid video, taking responsibility
49760	53840	for systemic racism, the problem with Jon Stewart, oh boy.
53840	60140	And I realized I kind of had to react to it because it got the old creative juices
60140	61220	flowing again.
61220	64640	I know there's at least a few creative types in my audience, you know how it is when you're
64640	68840	stuck in a rut for a while and then you see something and you're like oh my god and it
68840	71860	kind of kickstarts your brain again, that's what I feel like right now.
71860	73640	So let's check this nonsense out.
73640	79320	An episode about race, focusing on black issues, you'd want to connect with the Cornell West,
79320	107840	You know, I sometimes still don't mind Jon Stewart's humor, I have a feeling it's gonna
107840	111600	get a whole lot worse, but I mean that made me chuckle a little bit.
111600	117780	At La Salle University, he researches social inequality and race, Lisa Bond, the resident
117780	121560	white woman for Race to Dinner, a group that is trying to have better conversations about
121560	122840	race in America.
122840	126760	And joining remotely, longtime author and columnist Andrew Sullivan, editor of The Weekly
126760	127760	Dish.
127760	129880	Welcome everybody, thanks so much for joining us.
129880	137480	Here's what I think holds back our race conversation in America.
137480	145440	I think at its core, I think white people put blame on black people for the position
145440	146440	that they are in.
146440	152440	Hold on Jon, hold back the conversation on race in America.
152440	154580	What conversation is being held back?
154580	156960	We have these conversations all the time.
156960	161720	Our entire culture is inundated with these conversations right now Jon.
161720	167440	It's online, it's in schools, it's on the news, it's in our entertainment media, movies
167440	169240	games, shows, whatever it is.
169240	173400	At this point, the left, the progressives, they've won the culture war.
173400	178120	A significant amount of white people in the United States of America see race relations
178120	180320	through a colorblind lens.
180320	185160	And I don't mean that whites don't see race, they see someone that's black or Asian, but
185160	190680	they don't in any way attach any meaning to the color in affecting life chances.
190680	194800	And what that fundamentally means is that race doesn't matter in getting ahead.
194800	195800	It just doesn't matter.
195800	199160	We believe that we are in a race neutral environment.
199160	203880	The playing field has been leveled, and if you make it, or you don't-
203880	204880	It's a meritocracy.
204880	207680	It's a meritocracy, and it's a narrative also that does a lot of things.
207680	211760	It makes white privilege invisible, and it also-
211760	212760	Hold on, hold on.
212760	218040	So, first of all, that is in fact the attitude we should have, because that is in fact the
218040	220760	world that we should be striving towards.
220760	222880	Otherwise you are legitimately a racist.
222880	224920	And moreover, you're talking about white privilege.
225560	232120	The ideology of white privilege, academically, it's an ideology of the rich.
232120	235760	You know what kind of people are learning about this stuff and thinking this way?
235760	240320	The people who are bought into the white privilege narrative, these are university students.
240320	242480	These are upper class people, sometimes middle class people.
242480	246360	These are people who can afford to go to universities and be inculcated with this garbage.
246360	250600	The working class, like broke white people, they are the least likely to believe in the
250600	254760	concept of white privilege, because they are some of the people least likely to have privilege
254760	255760	at all.
255760	260720	Are you seriously going to sit here and yell and lecture at some working class Republican
260720	265800	guy who's never really left his hometown, who's making $25,000 a year at a menial job
265800	270200	that just got shipped overseas, and the only help he's getting from anybody is an oxy prescription
270200	271200	from his doctor?
271200	274060	Are you going to tell him that he's benefiting from white privilege?
274060	279160	This is a completely unrealistic way to look at the real lives of people.
279160	283140	When we talk about racism, we're talking about your character flaw.
283140	285820	If we say you're racist, it's a character flaw.
285820	286820	I'm bad.
286820	287820	I know I'm not bad.
287820	289380	I think I'm a good person.
289380	291260	I think I'm a nice person.
291260	294100	I know that I am racist.
294100	296100	I know that I'm racist.
296100	298100	Oh, God.
298100	300140	Oh, God.
300140	301140	Okay.
301140	306820	I want you to keep in mind for a little bit later that whole ... When I think of racism,
306820	310420	we think of character flaws, because that's true.
310420	313920	If you're a normie and you're using the term racist, like, that guy's racist, you're describing
313920	316920	a character flaw in that other person.
316920	321580	It's meant to be used as a negative word, but at this point ... Here, I'll watch this
321580	322580	a little bit more.
322580	328900	Just because I, every single day, uphold the systems and the structures of racism.
328900	329900	Right.
329900	334380	That's not a character flaw anymore, upholding the systems and the structures of racism,
334380	335380	whatever the fuck that means.
335380	337020	That's not a character flaw anymore.
337020	340300	So let's ask the question.
340300	341300	What is racism?
341300	342300	Okay.
342300	344380	Well, I think everyone would agree.
344380	349260	If you're going to do something bigoted towards a black person, that's going to be a racist
349260	350260	act.
350260	351260	That's racism.
351260	352260	Okay.
352260	355860	You see a black person, you hate him because he's black, and you throw stuff at him, or
355860	358700	you burn the cross on his front lawn or whatever the fuck it is.
358700	359700	That's racism.
359700	360700	Okay.
360700	361700	Well, what's the next level of racism?
361700	362900	Well, it's when you think bigoted thoughts.
362900	363900	Okay.
363900	366460	You're not really hurting anybody, but you have the wrong mindset.
366460	367580	The thought police is going to come after you.
367580	368580	You're thinking bigoted thoughts.
368580	369580	Okay.
369580	370580	It's racism.
370580	374780	What about when you vote for a bigot, or you vote for somebody who might implement bigoted
374780	375780	policies?
375780	376780	Okay.
376780	377780	You can probably call it racist too.
377780	378780	All right.
378780	379780	It's getting a little bit muddier here, but fine.
379780	383740	How about if you're part of a group that is considered to have bigoted views?
383740	386900	So let's say that you're not a bigot, but you join a political party full of bigots,
386900	390020	or you join a club full of bigots, but you're not actually a bigot yourself.
390020	396340	Well, why are you using your legitimacy as an agent, as a political agent, to support
396340	397340	this group?
397340	398340	Okay.
398340	399980	Well, I mean, now we're getting pretty far removed, but fair enough.
399980	401500	I can see how that could be racism.
401500	406780	And then what if racism is when your class of people, your group, is considered the beneficiaries
406780	409580	of past bigotry, even though none of you are bigoted today?
409580	414260	Well, that doesn't really make you racist, but there's still an aggrieved party, and
414260	416660	you're still benefiting from it, even if you don't know about it.
416660	420300	So like, okay, we're very far removed here, but okay.
420300	423100	You could, if you really squint your eyes, see that to be racism.
423100	424100	Okay.
424100	427780	Let's say you go down to the shop, and you buy from that business, and the business is
427780	431580	owned by a white person, and that white person has probably enjoyed some kind of intergenerational
431580	435940	wealth, to the point that maybe like five generations back, they had racist parents,
435940	439260	and those racist parents benefited in some way from their racism, and now that's been
439260	443220	passed on and snowballed, so that this white person today can now buy a business, and then
443220	446540	you shop there, so now you're complicit in that crime.
446540	453720	You can lay out a logically consistent argument as to why everything is a white supremacy,
453720	455640	but it is so far flung.
455640	457320	It's so spun out of control.
457320	463000	It's so ridiculous, the depths at which you have to reach to call it a white supremacy,
463000	465820	and then turn around and say, well, being racist is a character flaw.
465820	468040	It's like, really?
468040	473160	So because I bought from a white owned business, and I didn't know that five generations back,
473160	476820	his family benefited from racism, and that tiny benefit snowballed over the course of
476820	480500	five generations to let him build his business, and I'm buying from it.
480500	481720	That's a character flaw in me?
481720	486160	Like it becomes ridiculous, the notions these people have about race.
486160	490940	And if we don't start having a conversation about that, and about the ways that we are
490940	497840	complicit every day, daily, if we don't talk about it, then we are never going to see movement.
497840	500780	Andrew, do you think?
500780	507320	We've been talking about it for years, for decades, for fuck's sake, like, where's the
507320	508320	movement?
508960	514080	You won the culture war, we talk about it all the fucking time, we can't talk about
514080	519920	it enough for some fucking people, you hold all the reins of power, there are left-leaning
519920	524840	people in government, there are left-leaning people in these various cultural institutions,
524840	528560	like, whose fucking fault is it that there's no change?
528560	532920	Your average conservative nowadays is sitting at home, getting high and jacking off to trap
532920	533920	porn.
533920	537140	Like, they're not fucking doing anything, they're not engaged in the political process
537140	538140	right now.
538140	539140	It's all on you.
539140	545660	We know this country is, for example, a white supremacy, well, I don't believe that.
545660	551020	I think it's possibly the most absurd hyperbole I've ever heard.
551020	554900	I come from, I'm an immigrant, so I have a slightly different view of this.
554900	562380	I can tell you, America, in Twitter- Look at how angry she is, look at that face, she's
562380	564220	barely tolerating it.
564220	568940	I don't think this woman's ever, like, been told a no in her life.
568940	571020	America didn't start that way for black people.
571020	572700	They didn't immigrate here.
572700	578020	They were living somewhere else and they were kidnapped and raped and murdered and taken
578020	579020	here.
579020	584820	And so for you to just say this is a magnificent place that doesn't have racism is actually,
584820	589420	I think, more of a foundational lie than anything else.
589420	592940	I didn't say that.
592940	593940	Everyone clap.
593940	594940	I clapped.
594940	600500	Okay, so what John is saying is technically correct, but it also doesn't help the conversation
600500	607380	because it's true that these things existed, but are there still fucking slaves?
607380	609660	Is Jim Crow still in force?
609660	612620	Is this not the best time in history?
612620	614900	Have we not made things better?
614900	622300	For all of the sins of our past, do we not get a shred, a crumb of anything for having
622300	624180	actually done the right thing?
624180	626780	I'm not saying that you need to sit here and treat us like white saviors or anything.
626780	630900	I'm not saying that, but like, but if you're going to treat all white people like they're
630900	636260	slave masters, even when they ended slavery, you're just going to treat them the same way
636260	637880	any way.
637880	639540	Why should anyone tolerate that?
639540	643220	Why should anyone tolerate being your eternal whipping boy?
643220	646660	You said that it's the most hyperbole.
646660	651660	I said the term white supremacy is an absurd hyperbole.
651660	654300	For most people, that means the KKK.
654300	659960	It means no rights for minorities, and this has been used simply to avoid in our arguments.
659960	664420	Let's take a step back and let's define what we mean by white supremacy.
664420	670420	When you say white supremacy, how are you defining it for this conversation?
670420	675860	When I talk about white supremacy and when I talk about racism, I'm talking about power
675860	676860	and privilege.
676860	680380	The power and privilege that we hold as white people in society.
680380	688340	The way in which our structures, our institutions, our systems, how everything was designed
688340	691980	with white people in mind and only white people in mind.
691980	692980	Oh God.
692980	693980	Okay.
693980	694980	So let's see.
694980	697480	You want me to bust out my old gender studies and critical theory texts?
697480	701540	I could explain to you how these people view our society as a white supremacist society.
701540	706540	It's going to rely on something like how we had legitimately white privileging policies
706540	710900	in the past, a few which I think John actually lays out later in the video.
710900	711900	Redlining neighborhoods.
711900	718180	That was a state enforced thing from Jim Crow, which is the one point at which I think absolutely
718180	719180	is true.
719180	721740	So you just said it doesn't exist except for that.
721740	723620	No, no, no, no, no.
723620	727940	I said white supremacy doesn't exist.
727940	730020	When the new deal was passed, right?
730020	735200	When the new deal was passed, black people were explicitly not allowed to have those
735200	736200	loans.
736200	742000	The homestead act allowed white people to get an enormous wealth of land and be able
742000	743000	to farm it.
743000	744480	Black people did not have access to that.
744480	750740	So when slaves were freed, when social security came, black people, when the GI bill black
750740	751740	people were not.
751740	756020	And how the snowballing effects of those things continue to contribute to what you might call
756020	758300	an unfair disparity today.
758300	762680	The issue is that we're talking about three different types of racism.
762680	763680	Okay.
763680	765440	There's like level one is like overt racism.
765440	766440	That's when you're just a racist.
766440	767440	All right.
767440	769880	That's when you are saying black people can't come into my shop.
769880	771480	That's when you're, you're a slave owner.
771480	774860	That's when you're attacking black people simply for existing in public and being black
774860	775860	like overt racism.
775860	776860	Okay.
776860	778040	Pretty much everybody in the Western world at this point agrees.
778040	779040	That's bad.
779040	780040	Okay.
780040	781780	Like that the, the fight against overt racism is over.
781780	786300	Secondly, there is systemic racism and there's a lack of understanding regarding everybody
786300	787600	when it comes to systemic racism.
787600	794160	So for example, you could have systemic racism where even though the officer implementing
794160	799080	the policy, his himself, not a racist, he's looking at the law and the law says, well,
799080	801240	you have to treat black people differently in some way.
801240	802800	And he goes, my hands are tied, dude.
802800	804680	I don't want to do this, but I have to.
804680	808000	That's a systemic racism because it comes from a system, but it's not the only form
808000	809000	of systemic racism.
809000	810000	It's not the only form.
810000	816760	There's another form where for example, you could look at the trends of various racial
816760	822980	groups in a society, and then you could pick out certain behaviors that overwhelmingly
822980	828200	only one group actually engages in and then criminalize those behaviors.
828200	833080	The obvious example being used is crack versus powder cocaine, where because more black people
833080	836940	use crack cocaine, it would, the punishments associated with it were made significantly
836940	837940	higher in the past.
837940	841240	I think they still are actually in the States, which is a little bit fucked up, but the point
841240	845820	being is that nothing in the law says that you must treat certain races a certain way,
845820	851560	but rather they write the laws such that certain behaviors that are committed by certain races
851560	858240	are more illegal or say more heavily punished than other behaviors that might also be bad.
858240	861060	So that's kind of like a tricky way of getting around it.
861060	864600	And the third thing, this is what most people on the left call systemic racism.
864600	865600	It's not.
865600	866920	This is lingering racism.
866920	871120	This is just the after effects of previously abolished racism.
871120	874640	So for example, you might have a living playing field in a certain neighborhood between blacks
874640	879560	and whites, but because white families have had several more generations of intergenerational
879560	883440	wealth to build up as parents die and pass on their wealth to their kids, and then that
883440	888120	snowballs forward through time, black people, they, they had to start that process a little
888120	889960	bit later due to historic injustices.
889960	892480	And so now they're a little bit behind the game.
892480	893800	That's lingering racism.
893800	898280	The lingering racism is the fault of nobody today.
898280	903260	The issue with lingering racism is that even if there's no perpetrator, it's, it can still
903260	908720	be a problem sometimes, but what's going on here is that this woman is conflating all
908720	915160	of it into one thing, but you think it's purposeful, Andrew, would your argument be
915160	921560	that you don't see when she says it's purposeful, she's appealing to that idea that it's a character
921560	923040	flaw.
923040	927580	And yet that it doesn't, it doesn't make sense when we're talking about systemic racism.
927580	931320	It really doesn't make sense when we're talking about lingering racism that it's purposeful.
931320	937620	It's like, what, what is it purposeful on, on my behalf that a black person down the
937620	941380	street has some kind of problem based on something that happened five or six generations
941380	942380	ago?
942380	943880	Like, is it, how is that purposeful?
943880	946260	The truth is that it's actually not purposeful.
946260	950960	That's just a really easy way to bludgeon white people over the head with this shit
950960	952700	repeatedly to get them to comply.
952700	961140	This anti-white extremism is losing popular support, is creating a backlash, is going
961140	964700	to elect Republicans and undo a lot of the good you think you're doing.
964700	967180	This is what happens when you don't talk about it.
967180	972780	This is what happens when white people don't talk about it is you have racist dog whistle
972780	977060	tropes like this that actually perpetuate and perpetuate and perpetuate.
977060	979740	Jesus Christ lady.
979740	980740	I was right.
980740	983500	She is not used to ever getting any pushback.
983500	985660	Like, look how angry she is.
985660	989700	This is, this is literally, I want to speak to your manager right now.
989700	990740	Show the fuck out Karen.
990740	991740	It's okay.
991740	999060	So I am, I, I, and I did not come on this, on this show to sit here and argue with another
999060	1000060	white man.
1000060	1006780	That's one of the reasons that we don't even engage with white men at race to dinner.
1006780	1008260	She just piecing out.
1008260	1009260	Okay.
1009260	1012140	So, so here's, this is ridiculous.
1012140	1013140	Here's what I mean.
1013140	1016420	So we have these three types of racism, overt systemic lingering.
1016420	1017420	All right.
1017420	1021900	So what progressives like to do is they will squish them all together such that if you
1021900	1027500	are a beneficiary of some lingering racism, even, even not knowing that you are, that's
1027500	1033340	the same as throwing on the KKK hood and you know, lynching black people or something like
1033340	1034540	it's, it's a ridiculous notion.
1034540	1037100	It's a, it's a completely like brain dead notion.
1037100	1041500	Racism is also a character flaw, which when it is it's over at racism, it is a character
1041500	1042500	flaw.
1042500	1048660	But if you are simply moving through life, normally not hurting anybody, not doing anything
1048660	1055740	wrong, you unknowingly somehow through some very esoteric chain of events benefit from
1055740	1058620	some historic past and justice that's racist.
1058620	1062420	And that's a character flaw against you, which is why these people are constantly apologizing
1062420	1064740	for things that they never even did.
1064740	1068860	It's it's such self-flagellation it's it's ridiculous.
1068860	1070500	And they expect everyone to do this.
1070500	1074700	It's I think the most toxic way to talk about race.
1074700	1077720	It's it's equal to the, to the overt racists.
1077720	1079540	It's just as fucking bad.
1079540	1080540	White men.
1080540	1081540	We're going to do something about racism.
1081540	1082540	Yeah.
1082540	1083540	Had 400 years.
1083540	1088220	Y'all could have done.
1088220	1090220	Are there still slaves lady?
1090220	1092560	I don't ask this before.
1092560	1093560	Are there still slaves?
1093560	1095800	Is Jim Crow still in force of us?
1095800	1096800	White people do this.
1096800	1098820	I don't care if we say we're abolitionists.
1098900	1100660	I don't care if we say we're progressive.
1100660	1104900	I don't care if we're literally members of the KKK, KKK, KKK.
1104900	1109220	Every single white person upholds these systems and structures of white supremacy.
1109220	1113100	And we have got to talk about it.
1113100	1114980	She sounds very much like Anita Sarkeesian there.
1114980	1118820	I like how I pause it on the applause before the applause came in.
1118820	1120100	Everyone's soy clap.
1120100	1121100	Everyone's soy clap.
1121100	1126060	Now listen, she sounds like Anita Sarkeesian saying you have to point it all out.
1126060	1132940	If it takes extra time and extra energy out of my day to really try hard to be a progressive
1132940	1138800	as opposed to say a normie, and you're just going to call me a member of the KKK anyway,
1138800	1139900	why the fuck would I do it?
1139900	1143220	Why wouldn't I just say, well, fuck you then?
1143220	1144740	I don't care about your moral righteousness.
1144740	1146100	I don't care what you're slandering with.
1146100	1148300	I'm going to go do something else with my time.
1148300	1154980	I think the first thing that we need to understand is that all of us white people have a responsibility
1154980	1158420	to engage in these conversations regularly.
1158420	1161060	But when it gets hot like this, what do you do?
1161060	1162060	How do you back out of that?
1162060	1163060	Hold on, dude.
1163060	1164060	Hold on.
1164060	1165060	Hold on.
1165060	1166060	Hold on.
1166060	1167060	This is not a hot conversation.
1167060	1169020	John needs to get in on some internet blood sports or something.
1169020	1171620	I don't think he knows what a hot conversation is, but it's like I said before, we've been
1171620	1173940	having these conversations for decades, lady.
1173940	1175660	What has your talk done?
1175660	1179620	As you sit here and talk about it and say, we've got to have conversations and I got
1179620	1182940	to be able to browbeat even more people and I got to be able to call even more people
1182940	1187940	racist, people like you directly vote and support policies that make the situation that
1187940	1189820	you're complaining about a little bit worse.
1189820	1195780	Like, for example, defunding the police that makes situations in black communities worse.
1195780	1200120	Or it's at the same time, you're also voting for various city policies that don't allow
1200120	1203380	people to build new low income housing in your neighborhood.
1203380	1207700	To be honest, you help with the removal of opportunities for people to independently
1207700	1212860	stand on their own two feet through a massive expansion of the welfare state to the point
1212860	1217860	that it stops being like a good idea and it turns into a situation where people are
1217860	1222700	incentivized to not stand on their own two feet, but instead simply live off welfare.
1222700	1224540	And nobody wants to live off welfare.
1224540	1229060	Nobody just wants to accept handouts from the government to be told this is your ration.
1229060	1230060	This is all that you get.
1230060	1231060	People want independence.
1231060	1232060	They want freedom.
1232060	1236900	They don't, they don't want a measured proportion of what some authority says that this is what
1236900	1237900	you deserve.
1237900	1243980	I think women like this just want to talk about these things in perpetuity and never
1243980	1244980	do anything.
1244980	1250620	And in fact, do things that make it worse, just so that they can continuously feel good
1250620	1251620	about themselves.
1251620	1255120	And if they happen to work for one of these progressive foundations or institutions, keep
1255120	1258740	on raking in money for giving absolutely nothing to society.
1258740	1263660	I think figuring out a way to help black kids have a stable family.
1263660	1265140	The truth is it's true.
1265140	1266140	Whoa, whoa, whoa.
1266180	1267180	Hold on.
1267180	1268180	Hold on.
1268180	1269180	Is she shaking her head here?
1269180	1270180	She's shaking her head here.
1270180	1271180	Hold on.
1271180	1272180	Lady, what are you shaking your fucking head about here?
1272180	1278300	I'm pretty sure that the disintegration of the black family is a pretty big problem.
1278300	1279300	And you know what?
1279300	1283260	It might even be part of that lingering racism that I defined earlier.
1283260	1284260	Who the fuck?
1284260	1285260	Who the fuck is this person?
1285260	1286260	Hold on.
1286260	1287260	Overcome.
1287260	1289260	And I'll start with Chip.
1289260	1294060	Quality and race, Lisa Bond, the resident white woman for Race to Dinner, a group that
1294060	1296520	is trying to have better conversations about race in America.
1296520	1297520	Race to Dinner.
1297520	1298520	Okay.
1298520	1302020	He was dropping on Race to Dinner's anti-racist dinner parties.
1302020	1305020	Let's check out some of these.
1305020	1306020	Here's the Instagram.
1306020	1310780	It's a product and a service radically honest.
1310780	1312860	I think I remember these people.
1312860	1314020	Yes.
1314020	1319100	Why liberal white women pay a lot of money to learn over dinner how they're racist.
1319100	1323360	A growing number of women are paying to confront their privilege and racism at dinners that
1323360	1325400	cost $2,500.
1325400	1331780	You white women, I remember I did a video on this or something years ago.
1331780	1339800	White women will pay to have dinner with non-white women who lecture to them about how terrible
1339800	1341900	they are.
1341900	1343200	The whole dinner.
1343200	1345160	I remember this.
1345160	1349720	Two entrepreneurs have built a business dredging up white women's shame.
1349720	1351120	Oh my God.
1351120	1353360	That's who this fucking person is.
1353360	1354360	Okay.
1354360	1356280	This is where she's from.
1356280	1357280	Okay.
1357280	1358280	I understand.
1358280	1361360	Now I understand where the fuck all this insanity is coming from.
1361360	1366360	I think the worst part here though is Jon Stewart himself.
1366360	1371620	He's literally doing to the race conversation and progressive conversations in the United
1371620	1372760	States.
1372760	1378920	What he complained about on Crossfire when he walked onto that show back in the 2000s
1378920	1381080	and single-handedly destroyed it.
1381080	1383520	I don't know if you guys remember that controversy.
1383520	1389220	Crossfire was basically a debate show hosted on CNN where you had a left-leaning pundit
1389220	1392520	and a right-leaning pundit debating various news topics.
1392520	1396760	And Jon Stewart showed up here, I found it October 15th, 2004.
1396760	1401540	He showed up on the program and basically single-handedly destroyed it.
1401540	1405840	I made a special effort to come on the show today because I have privately amongst my
1405840	1411960	friends and also in occasional newspapers and television shows mentioned this show as
1411960	1416960	being bad.
1416960	1421320	And I wanted to, I felt that that wasn't fair and I should come here and tell you that it's
1421320	1426220	not so much that it's bad as it's hurting America.
1426220	1433440	So I wanted to come here today and say, here's just what I wanted to tell you guys.
1433440	1439760	Stop, stop, stop, stop hurting America.
1439760	1446720	And come work for us because we, as the people, the people, not well, but you can sleep at
1446720	1447720	night.
1447720	1451680	See, the thing is, we need your help.
1451680	1456440	Right now you're helping the politicians and the corporations and we're left out there
1456440	1457440	to mow our lawns.
1457440	1458760	You just said we're too rough on them when they make mistakes.
1458760	1460200	No, no, no, you're not too rough on them.
1460200	1462920	You are part of their strategies.
1462920	1464840	You're partisan.
1464840	1465840	What do you call it?
1465840	1466840	Hacks.
1466840	1471000	I actually remember watching this live when it happened because I know I'm that old, but,
1471000	1475180	but a few months later, CNN canceled it because Jon Stewart had basically destroyed the reputation
1475180	1476400	of that program.
1476400	1483480	And now here he is on his own show doing the same thing that they did having really terrible
1483480	1489320	surface level conversations with the absolute worst individuals to actually have these conversations
1489320	1493040	with and actively ruining the discourse in the process.
1493040	1497140	Like with this guy up here in the monitor says he was the guy who was against the rest
1497140	1498140	of them.
1498140	1502660	He was saying some things that were a bit off the wall, but not anything too far from
1502660	1506760	what most normal politically unengaged Americans think.
1506760	1510680	It's like, Hey, I'm not a white supremacist like these, like these people without any
1510680	1513800	kind of like academic definitions on their side or anything, they're just thinking, I
1513800	1514800	mean, slavery was bad.
1514800	1515800	I'm not a white supremacist.
1515800	1516800	I don't do any of that shit.
1516800	1517800	I'm just getting on with my life.
1517800	1519840	And yeah, that's the way that a normal person should view it.
1519840	1524580	And they're just like lambasting him, like he's some kind of fucking racist and it's,
1524580	1525580	it's insane.
1525580	1526580	It's, it's terrible.
1526580	1528480	This, this, this whole thing's been fucking cancer.
1528480	1533240	Jon Stewart used to actually be able to engage in sometimes decent conversation.
1533240	1534960	I don't know what the fuck happened.
1534960	1539000	I think, I think he basically just fell off like everyone else on the left has recently.
1539000	1545160	They all think that having a real conversation about real issues has to simply be an opportunity
1545160	1547320	for you to show how good you are.
1547320	1549720	And none of that helps anyone.
1549720	1556720	Not being able to distinguish between real racists and tea partiers or real bigots and
1556720	1564560	Juan Williams or Rick Sanchez is an insult, not only to those people, but to the racist
1564560	1570040	themselves who have put in the exhausting effort it takes to hate.
1570040	1573680	If I could finger snap, I would finger snap right now.
1574120	1575640	Uh, let's remove it then from the-
1575640	1578240	Well you'd be finger snapping without calling me a racist, Jon.
1578240	1582480	Let's, let's, you're, you've been doing a pretty good job with it yourself there, so.
