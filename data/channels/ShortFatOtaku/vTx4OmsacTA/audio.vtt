00:00.000 --> 00:08.360
Hello friends, sorry for the dearth of content.

00:08.360 --> 00:12.280
I think I just need to come to terms with the fact that sometimes I just get pretty

00:12.280 --> 00:13.560
bad writer's block.

00:13.560 --> 00:18.380
I'm currently sitting on a half-finished analysis of market socialism, I've attempted to write

00:18.380 --> 00:20.880
something on the don't say gay bill, it's just...

00:20.880 --> 00:25.360
I've tried to do a lot of things and it just hasn't come out the greatest.

00:25.360 --> 00:31.080
Maybe I just need like regular time off because I spend a lot of time trying to work.

00:31.080 --> 00:34.480
Maybe I need to spend more time streaming video games or something.

00:34.480 --> 00:38.200
Actually if you watch this on release I'll be streaming games right now, it's time for

00:38.200 --> 00:42.400
the Saturday morning show so hey, make sure you drop by the gaming channel literally after

00:42.400 --> 00:44.080
this video and come say hi.

00:44.080 --> 00:49.760
But this morning when I was eating breakfast I was watching this stupid video, taking responsibility

00:49.760 --> 00:53.840
for systemic racism, the problem with Jon Stewart, oh boy.

00:53.840 --> 01:00.140
And I realized I kind of had to react to it because it got the old creative juices

01:00.140 --> 01:01.220
flowing again.

01:01.220 --> 01:04.640
I know there's at least a few creative types in my audience, you know how it is when you're

01:04.640 --> 01:08.840
stuck in a rut for a while and then you see something and you're like oh my god and it

01:08.840 --> 01:11.860
kind of kickstarts your brain again, that's what I feel like right now.

01:11.860 --> 01:13.640
So let's check this nonsense out.

01:13.640 --> 01:19.320
An episode about race, focusing on black issues, you'd want to connect with the Cornell West,

01:19.320 --> 01:47.840
You know, I sometimes still don't mind Jon Stewart's humor, I have a feeling it's gonna

01:47.840 --> 01:51.600
get a whole lot worse, but I mean that made me chuckle a little bit.

01:51.600 --> 01:57.780
At La Salle University, he researches social inequality and race, Lisa Bond, the resident

01:57.780 --> 02:01.560
white woman for Race to Dinner, a group that is trying to have better conversations about

02:01.560 --> 02:02.840
race in America.

02:02.840 --> 02:06.760
And joining remotely, longtime author and columnist Andrew Sullivan, editor of The Weekly

02:06.760 --> 02:07.760
Dish.

02:07.760 --> 02:09.880
Welcome everybody, thanks so much for joining us.

02:09.880 --> 02:17.480
Here's what I think holds back our race conversation in America.

02:17.480 --> 02:25.440
I think at its core, I think white people put blame on black people for the position

02:25.440 --> 02:26.440
that they are in.

02:26.440 --> 02:32.440
Hold on Jon, hold back the conversation on race in America.

02:32.440 --> 02:34.580
What conversation is being held back?

02:34.580 --> 02:36.960
We have these conversations all the time.

02:36.960 --> 02:41.720
Our entire culture is inundated with these conversations right now Jon.

02:41.720 --> 02:47.440
It's online, it's in schools, it's on the news, it's in our entertainment media, movies

02:47.440 --> 02:49.240
games, shows, whatever it is.

02:49.240 --> 02:53.400
At this point, the left, the progressives, they've won the culture war.

02:53.400 --> 02:58.120
A significant amount of white people in the United States of America see race relations

02:58.120 --> 03:00.320
through a colorblind lens.

03:00.320 --> 03:05.160
And I don't mean that whites don't see race, they see someone that's black or Asian, but

03:05.160 --> 03:10.680
they don't in any way attach any meaning to the color in affecting life chances.

03:10.680 --> 03:14.800
And what that fundamentally means is that race doesn't matter in getting ahead.

03:14.800 --> 03:15.800
It just doesn't matter.

03:15.800 --> 03:19.160
We believe that we are in a race neutral environment.

03:19.160 --> 03:23.880
The playing field has been leveled, and if you make it, or you don't-

03:23.880 --> 03:24.880
It's a meritocracy.

03:24.880 --> 03:27.680
It's a meritocracy, and it's a narrative also that does a lot of things.

03:27.680 --> 03:31.760
It makes white privilege invisible, and it also-

03:31.760 --> 03:32.760
Hold on, hold on.

03:32.760 --> 03:38.040
So, first of all, that is in fact the attitude we should have, because that is in fact the

03:38.040 --> 03:40.760
world that we should be striving towards.

03:40.760 --> 03:42.880
Otherwise you are legitimately a racist.

03:42.880 --> 03:44.920
And moreover, you're talking about white privilege.

03:45.560 --> 03:52.120
The ideology of white privilege, academically, it's an ideology of the rich.

03:52.120 --> 03:55.760
You know what kind of people are learning about this stuff and thinking this way?

03:55.760 --> 04:00.320
The people who are bought into the white privilege narrative, these are university students.

04:00.320 --> 04:02.480
These are upper class people, sometimes middle class people.

04:02.480 --> 04:06.360
These are people who can afford to go to universities and be inculcated with this garbage.

04:06.360 --> 04:10.600
The working class, like broke white people, they are the least likely to believe in the

04:10.600 --> 04:14.760
concept of white privilege, because they are some of the people least likely to have privilege

04:14.760 --> 04:15.760
at all.

04:15.760 --> 04:20.720
Are you seriously going to sit here and yell and lecture at some working class Republican

04:20.720 --> 04:25.800
guy who's never really left his hometown, who's making $25,000 a year at a menial job

04:25.800 --> 04:30.200
that just got shipped overseas, and the only help he's getting from anybody is an oxy prescription

04:30.200 --> 04:31.200
from his doctor?

04:31.200 --> 04:34.060
Are you going to tell him that he's benefiting from white privilege?

04:34.060 --> 04:39.160
This is a completely unrealistic way to look at the real lives of people.

04:39.160 --> 04:43.140
When we talk about racism, we're talking about your character flaw.

04:43.140 --> 04:45.820
If we say you're racist, it's a character flaw.

04:45.820 --> 04:46.820
I'm bad.

04:46.820 --> 04:47.820
I know I'm not bad.

04:47.820 --> 04:49.380
I think I'm a good person.

04:49.380 --> 04:51.260
I think I'm a nice person.

04:51.260 --> 04:54.100
I know that I am racist.

04:54.100 --> 04:56.100
I know that I'm racist.

04:56.100 --> 04:58.100
Oh, God.

04:58.100 --> 05:00.140
Oh, God.

05:00.140 --> 05:01.140
Okay.

05:01.140 --> 05:06.820
I want you to keep in mind for a little bit later that whole ... When I think of racism,

05:06.820 --> 05:10.420
we think of character flaws, because that's true.

05:10.420 --> 05:13.920
If you're a normie and you're using the term racist, like, that guy's racist, you're describing

05:13.920 --> 05:16.920
a character flaw in that other person.

05:16.920 --> 05:21.580
It's meant to be used as a negative word, but at this point ... Here, I'll watch this

05:21.580 --> 05:22.580
a little bit more.

05:22.580 --> 05:28.900
Just because I, every single day, uphold the systems and the structures of racism.

05:28.900 --> 05:29.900
Right.

05:29.900 --> 05:34.380
That's not a character flaw anymore, upholding the systems and the structures of racism,

05:34.380 --> 05:35.380
whatever the fuck that means.

05:35.380 --> 05:37.020
That's not a character flaw anymore.

05:37.020 --> 05:40.300
So let's ask the question.

05:40.300 --> 05:41.300
What is racism?

05:41.300 --> 05:42.300
Okay.

05:42.300 --> 05:44.380
Well, I think everyone would agree.

05:44.380 --> 05:49.260
If you're going to do something bigoted towards a black person, that's going to be a racist

05:49.260 --> 05:50.260
act.

05:50.260 --> 05:51.260
That's racism.

05:51.260 --> 05:52.260
Okay.

05:52.260 --> 05:55.860
You see a black person, you hate him because he's black, and you throw stuff at him, or

05:55.860 --> 05:58.700
you burn the cross on his front lawn or whatever the fuck it is.

05:58.700 --> 05:59.700
That's racism.

05:59.700 --> 06:00.700
Okay.

06:00.700 --> 06:01.700
Well, what's the next level of racism?

06:01.700 --> 06:02.900
Well, it's when you think bigoted thoughts.

06:02.900 --> 06:03.900
Okay.

06:03.900 --> 06:06.460
You're not really hurting anybody, but you have the wrong mindset.

06:06.460 --> 06:07.580
The thought police is going to come after you.

06:07.580 --> 06:08.580
You're thinking bigoted thoughts.

06:08.580 --> 06:09.580
Okay.

06:09.580 --> 06:10.580
It's racism.

06:10.580 --> 06:14.780
What about when you vote for a bigot, or you vote for somebody who might implement bigoted

06:14.780 --> 06:15.780
policies?

06:15.780 --> 06:16.780
Okay.

06:16.780 --> 06:17.780
You can probably call it racist too.

06:17.780 --> 06:18.780
All right.

06:18.780 --> 06:19.780
It's getting a little bit muddier here, but fine.

06:19.780 --> 06:23.740
How about if you're part of a group that is considered to have bigoted views?

06:23.740 --> 06:26.900
So let's say that you're not a bigot, but you join a political party full of bigots,

06:26.900 --> 06:30.020
or you join a club full of bigots, but you're not actually a bigot yourself.

06:30.020 --> 06:36.340
Well, why are you using your legitimacy as an agent, as a political agent, to support

06:36.340 --> 06:37.340
this group?

06:37.340 --> 06:38.340
Okay.

06:38.340 --> 06:39.980
Well, I mean, now we're getting pretty far removed, but fair enough.

06:39.980 --> 06:41.500
I can see how that could be racism.

06:41.500 --> 06:46.780
And then what if racism is when your class of people, your group, is considered the beneficiaries

06:46.780 --> 06:49.580
of past bigotry, even though none of you are bigoted today?

06:49.580 --> 06:54.260
Well, that doesn't really make you racist, but there's still an aggrieved party, and

06:54.260 --> 06:56.660
you're still benefiting from it, even if you don't know about it.

06:56.660 --> 07:00.300
So like, okay, we're very far removed here, but okay.

07:00.300 --> 07:03.100
You could, if you really squint your eyes, see that to be racism.

07:03.100 --> 07:04.100
Okay.

07:04.100 --> 07:07.780
Let's say you go down to the shop, and you buy from that business, and the business is

07:07.780 --> 07:11.580
owned by a white person, and that white person has probably enjoyed some kind of intergenerational

07:11.580 --> 07:15.940
wealth, to the point that maybe like five generations back, they had racist parents,

07:15.940 --> 07:19.260
and those racist parents benefited in some way from their racism, and now that's been

07:19.260 --> 07:23.220
passed on and snowballed, so that this white person today can now buy a business, and then

07:23.220 --> 07:26.540
you shop there, so now you're complicit in that crime.

07:26.540 --> 07:33.720
You can lay out a logically consistent argument as to why everything is a white supremacy,

07:33.720 --> 07:35.640
but it is so far flung.

07:35.640 --> 07:37.320
It's so spun out of control.

07:37.320 --> 07:43.000
It's so ridiculous, the depths at which you have to reach to call it a white supremacy,

07:43.000 --> 07:45.820
and then turn around and say, well, being racist is a character flaw.

07:45.820 --> 07:48.040
It's like, really?

07:48.040 --> 07:53.160
So because I bought from a white owned business, and I didn't know that five generations back,

07:53.160 --> 07:56.820
his family benefited from racism, and that tiny benefit snowballed over the course of

07:56.820 --> 08:00.500
five generations to let him build his business, and I'm buying from it.

08:00.500 --> 08:01.720
That's a character flaw in me?

08:01.720 --> 08:06.160
Like it becomes ridiculous, the notions these people have about race.

08:06.160 --> 08:10.940
And if we don't start having a conversation about that, and about the ways that we are

08:10.940 --> 08:17.840
complicit every day, daily, if we don't talk about it, then we are never going to see movement.

08:17.840 --> 08:20.780
Andrew, do you think?

08:20.780 --> 08:27.320
We've been talking about it for years, for decades, for fuck's sake, like, where's the

08:27.320 --> 08:28.320
movement?

08:28.960 --> 08:34.080
You won the culture war, we talk about it all the fucking time, we can't talk about

08:34.080 --> 08:39.920
it enough for some fucking people, you hold all the reins of power, there are left-leaning

08:39.920 --> 08:44.840
people in government, there are left-leaning people in these various cultural institutions,

08:44.840 --> 08:48.560
like, whose fucking fault is it that there's no change?

08:48.560 --> 08:52.920
Your average conservative nowadays is sitting at home, getting high and jacking off to trap

08:52.920 --> 08:53.920
porn.

08:53.920 --> 08:57.140
Like, they're not fucking doing anything, they're not engaged in the political process

08:57.140 --> 08:58.140
right now.

08:58.140 --> 08:59.140
It's all on you.

08:59.140 --> 09:05.660
We know this country is, for example, a white supremacy, well, I don't believe that.

09:05.660 --> 09:11.020
I think it's possibly the most absurd hyperbole I've ever heard.

09:11.020 --> 09:14.900
I come from, I'm an immigrant, so I have a slightly different view of this.

09:14.900 --> 09:22.380
I can tell you, America, in Twitter- Look at how angry she is, look at that face, she's

09:22.380 --> 09:24.220
barely tolerating it.

09:24.220 --> 09:28.940
I don't think this woman's ever, like, been told a no in her life.

09:28.940 --> 09:31.020
America didn't start that way for black people.

09:31.020 --> 09:32.700
They didn't immigrate here.

09:32.700 --> 09:38.020
They were living somewhere else and they were kidnapped and raped and murdered and taken

09:38.020 --> 09:39.020
here.

09:39.020 --> 09:44.820
And so for you to just say this is a magnificent place that doesn't have racism is actually,

09:44.820 --> 09:49.420
I think, more of a foundational lie than anything else.

09:49.420 --> 09:52.940
I didn't say that.

09:52.940 --> 09:53.940
Everyone clap.

09:53.940 --> 09:54.940
I clapped.

09:54.940 --> 10:00.500
Okay, so what John is saying is technically correct, but it also doesn't help the conversation

10:00.500 --> 10:07.380
because it's true that these things existed, but are there still fucking slaves?

10:07.380 --> 10:09.660
Is Jim Crow still in force?

10:09.660 --> 10:12.620
Is this not the best time in history?

10:12.620 --> 10:14.900
Have we not made things better?

10:14.900 --> 10:22.300
For all of the sins of our past, do we not get a shred, a crumb of anything for having

10:22.300 --> 10:24.180
actually done the right thing?

10:24.180 --> 10:26.780
I'm not saying that you need to sit here and treat us like white saviors or anything.

10:26.780 --> 10:30.900
I'm not saying that, but like, but if you're going to treat all white people like they're

10:30.900 --> 10:36.260
slave masters, even when they ended slavery, you're just going to treat them the same way

10:36.260 --> 10:37.880
any way.

10:37.880 --> 10:39.540
Why should anyone tolerate that?

10:39.540 --> 10:43.220
Why should anyone tolerate being your eternal whipping boy?

10:43.220 --> 10:46.660
You said that it's the most hyperbole.

10:46.660 --> 10:51.660
I said the term white supremacy is an absurd hyperbole.

10:51.660 --> 10:54.300
For most people, that means the KKK.

10:54.300 --> 10:59.960
It means no rights for minorities, and this has been used simply to avoid in our arguments.

10:59.960 --> 11:04.420
Let's take a step back and let's define what we mean by white supremacy.

11:04.420 --> 11:10.420
When you say white supremacy, how are you defining it for this conversation?

11:10.420 --> 11:15.860
When I talk about white supremacy and when I talk about racism, I'm talking about power

11:15.860 --> 11:16.860
and privilege.

11:16.860 --> 11:20.380
The power and privilege that we hold as white people in society.

11:20.380 --> 11:28.340
The way in which our structures, our institutions, our systems, how everything was designed

11:28.340 --> 11:31.980
with white people in mind and only white people in mind.

11:31.980 --> 11:32.980
Oh God.

11:32.980 --> 11:33.980
Okay.

11:33.980 --> 11:34.980
So let's see.

11:34.980 --> 11:37.480
You want me to bust out my old gender studies and critical theory texts?

11:37.480 --> 11:41.540
I could explain to you how these people view our society as a white supremacist society.

11:41.540 --> 11:46.540
It's going to rely on something like how we had legitimately white privileging policies

11:46.540 --> 11:50.900
in the past, a few which I think John actually lays out later in the video.

11:50.900 --> 11:51.900
Redlining neighborhoods.

11:51.900 --> 11:58.180
That was a state enforced thing from Jim Crow, which is the one point at which I think absolutely

11:58.180 --> 11:59.180
is true.

11:59.180 --> 12:01.740
So you just said it doesn't exist except for that.

12:01.740 --> 12:03.620
No, no, no, no, no.

12:03.620 --> 12:07.940
I said white supremacy doesn't exist.

12:07.940 --> 12:10.020
When the new deal was passed, right?

12:10.020 --> 12:15.200
When the new deal was passed, black people were explicitly not allowed to have those

12:15.200 --> 12:16.200
loans.

12:16.200 --> 12:22.000
The homestead act allowed white people to get an enormous wealth of land and be able

12:22.000 --> 12:23.000
to farm it.

12:23.000 --> 12:24.480
Black people did not have access to that.

12:24.480 --> 12:30.740
So when slaves were freed, when social security came, black people, when the GI bill black

12:30.740 --> 12:31.740
people were not.

12:31.740 --> 12:36.020
And how the snowballing effects of those things continue to contribute to what you might call

12:36.020 --> 12:38.300
an unfair disparity today.

12:38.300 --> 12:42.680
The issue is that we're talking about three different types of racism.

12:42.680 --> 12:43.680
Okay.

12:43.680 --> 12:45.440
There's like level one is like overt racism.

12:45.440 --> 12:46.440
That's when you're just a racist.

12:46.440 --> 12:47.440
All right.

12:47.440 --> 12:49.880
That's when you are saying black people can't come into my shop.

12:49.880 --> 12:51.480
That's when you're, you're a slave owner.

12:51.480 --> 12:54.860
That's when you're attacking black people simply for existing in public and being black

12:54.860 --> 12:55.860
like overt racism.

12:55.860 --> 12:56.860
Okay.

12:56.860 --> 12:58.040
Pretty much everybody in the Western world at this point agrees.

12:58.040 --> 12:59.040
That's bad.

12:59.040 --> 13:00.040
Okay.

13:00.040 --> 13:01.780
Like that the, the fight against overt racism is over.

13:01.780 --> 13:06.300
Secondly, there is systemic racism and there's a lack of understanding regarding everybody

13:06.300 --> 13:07.600
when it comes to systemic racism.

13:07.600 --> 13:14.160
So for example, you could have systemic racism where even though the officer implementing

13:14.160 --> 13:19.080
the policy, his himself, not a racist, he's looking at the law and the law says, well,

13:19.080 --> 13:21.240
you have to treat black people differently in some way.

13:21.240 --> 13:22.800
And he goes, my hands are tied, dude.

13:22.800 --> 13:24.680
I don't want to do this, but I have to.

13:24.680 --> 13:28.000
That's a systemic racism because it comes from a system, but it's not the only form

13:28.000 --> 13:29.000
of systemic racism.

13:29.000 --> 13:30.000
It's not the only form.

13:30.000 --> 13:36.760
There's another form where for example, you could look at the trends of various racial

13:36.760 --> 13:42.980
groups in a society, and then you could pick out certain behaviors that overwhelmingly

13:42.980 --> 13:48.200
only one group actually engages in and then criminalize those behaviors.

13:48.200 --> 13:53.080
The obvious example being used is crack versus powder cocaine, where because more black people

13:53.080 --> 13:56.940
use crack cocaine, it would, the punishments associated with it were made significantly

13:56.940 --> 13:57.940
higher in the past.

13:57.940 --> 14:01.240
I think they still are actually in the States, which is a little bit fucked up, but the point

14:01.240 --> 14:05.820
being is that nothing in the law says that you must treat certain races a certain way,

14:05.820 --> 14:11.560
but rather they write the laws such that certain behaviors that are committed by certain races

14:11.560 --> 14:18.240
are more illegal or say more heavily punished than other behaviors that might also be bad.

14:18.240 --> 14:21.060
So that's kind of like a tricky way of getting around it.

14:21.060 --> 14:24.600
And the third thing, this is what most people on the left call systemic racism.

14:24.600 --> 14:25.600
It's not.

14:25.600 --> 14:26.920
This is lingering racism.

14:26.920 --> 14:31.120
This is just the after effects of previously abolished racism.

14:31.120 --> 14:34.640
So for example, you might have a living playing field in a certain neighborhood between blacks

14:34.640 --> 14:39.560
and whites, but because white families have had several more generations of intergenerational

14:39.560 --> 14:43.440
wealth to build up as parents die and pass on their wealth to their kids, and then that

14:43.440 --> 14:48.120
snowballs forward through time, black people, they, they had to start that process a little

14:48.120 --> 14:49.960
bit later due to historic injustices.

14:49.960 --> 14:52.480
And so now they're a little bit behind the game.

14:52.480 --> 14:53.800
That's lingering racism.

14:53.800 --> 14:58.280
The lingering racism is the fault of nobody today.

14:58.280 --> 15:03.260
The issue with lingering racism is that even if there's no perpetrator, it's, it can still

15:03.260 --> 15:08.720
be a problem sometimes, but what's going on here is that this woman is conflating all

15:08.720 --> 15:15.160
of it into one thing, but you think it's purposeful, Andrew, would your argument be

15:15.160 --> 15:21.560
that you don't see when she says it's purposeful, she's appealing to that idea that it's a character

15:21.560 --> 15:23.040
flaw.

15:23.040 --> 15:27.580
And yet that it doesn't, it doesn't make sense when we're talking about systemic racism.

15:27.580 --> 15:31.320
It really doesn't make sense when we're talking about lingering racism that it's purposeful.

15:31.320 --> 15:37.620
It's like, what, what is it purposeful on, on my behalf that a black person down the

15:37.620 --> 15:41.380
street has some kind of problem based on something that happened five or six generations

15:41.380 --> 15:42.380
ago?

15:42.380 --> 15:43.880
Like, is it, how is that purposeful?

15:43.880 --> 15:46.260
The truth is that it's actually not purposeful.

15:46.260 --> 15:50.960
That's just a really easy way to bludgeon white people over the head with this shit

15:50.960 --> 15:52.700
repeatedly to get them to comply.

15:52.700 --> 16:01.140
This anti-white extremism is losing popular support, is creating a backlash, is going

16:01.140 --> 16:04.700
to elect Republicans and undo a lot of the good you think you're doing.

16:04.700 --> 16:07.180
This is what happens when you don't talk about it.

16:07.180 --> 16:12.780
This is what happens when white people don't talk about it is you have racist dog whistle

16:12.780 --> 16:17.060
tropes like this that actually perpetuate and perpetuate and perpetuate.

16:17.060 --> 16:19.740
Jesus Christ lady.

16:19.740 --> 16:20.740
I was right.

16:20.740 --> 16:23.500
She is not used to ever getting any pushback.

16:23.500 --> 16:25.660
Like, look how angry she is.

16:25.660 --> 16:29.700
This is, this is literally, I want to speak to your manager right now.

16:29.700 --> 16:30.740
Show the fuck out Karen.

16:30.740 --> 16:31.740
It's okay.

16:31.740 --> 16:39.060
So I am, I, I, and I did not come on this, on this show to sit here and argue with another

16:39.060 --> 16:40.060
white man.

16:40.060 --> 16:46.780
That's one of the reasons that we don't even engage with white men at race to dinner.

16:46.780 --> 16:48.260
She just piecing out.

16:48.260 --> 16:49.260
Okay.

16:49.260 --> 16:52.140
So, so here's, this is ridiculous.

16:52.140 --> 16:53.140
Here's what I mean.

16:53.140 --> 16:56.420
So we have these three types of racism, overt systemic lingering.

16:56.420 --> 16:57.420
All right.

16:57.420 --> 17:01.900
So what progressives like to do is they will squish them all together such that if you

17:01.900 --> 17:07.500
are a beneficiary of some lingering racism, even, even not knowing that you are, that's

17:07.500 --> 17:13.340
the same as throwing on the KKK hood and you know, lynching black people or something like

17:13.340 --> 17:14.540
it's, it's a ridiculous notion.

17:14.540 --> 17:17.100
It's a, it's a completely like brain dead notion.

17:17.100 --> 17:21.500
Racism is also a character flaw, which when it is it's over at racism, it is a character

17:21.500 --> 17:22.500
flaw.

17:22.500 --> 17:28.660
But if you are simply moving through life, normally not hurting anybody, not doing anything

17:28.660 --> 17:35.740
wrong, you unknowingly somehow through some very esoteric chain of events benefit from

17:35.740 --> 17:38.620
some historic past and justice that's racist.

17:38.620 --> 17:42.420
And that's a character flaw against you, which is why these people are constantly apologizing

17:42.420 --> 17:44.740
for things that they never even did.

17:44.740 --> 17:48.860
It's it's such self-flagellation it's it's ridiculous.

17:48.860 --> 17:50.500
And they expect everyone to do this.

17:50.500 --> 17:54.700
It's I think the most toxic way to talk about race.

17:54.700 --> 17:57.720
It's it's equal to the, to the overt racists.

17:57.720 --> 17:59.540
It's just as fucking bad.

17:59.540 --> 18:00.540
White men.

18:00.540 --> 18:01.540
We're going to do something about racism.

18:01.540 --> 18:02.540
Yeah.

18:02.540 --> 18:03.540
Had 400 years.

18:03.540 --> 18:08.220
Y'all could have done.

18:08.220 --> 18:10.220
Are there still slaves lady?

18:10.220 --> 18:12.560
I don't ask this before.

18:12.560 --> 18:13.560
Are there still slaves?

18:13.560 --> 18:15.800
Is Jim Crow still in force of us?

18:15.800 --> 18:16.800
White people do this.

18:16.800 --> 18:18.820
I don't care if we say we're abolitionists.

18:18.900 --> 18:20.660
I don't care if we say we're progressive.

18:20.660 --> 18:24.900
I don't care if we're literally members of the KKK, KKK, KKK.

18:24.900 --> 18:29.220
Every single white person upholds these systems and structures of white supremacy.

18:29.220 --> 18:33.100
And we have got to talk about it.

18:33.100 --> 18:34.980
She sounds very much like Anita Sarkeesian there.

18:34.980 --> 18:38.820
I like how I pause it on the applause before the applause came in.

18:38.820 --> 18:40.100
Everyone's soy clap.

18:40.100 --> 18:41.100
Everyone's soy clap.

18:41.100 --> 18:46.060
Now listen, she sounds like Anita Sarkeesian saying you have to point it all out.

18:46.060 --> 18:52.940
If it takes extra time and extra energy out of my day to really try hard to be a progressive

18:52.940 --> 18:58.800
as opposed to say a normie, and you're just going to call me a member of the KKK anyway,

18:58.800 --> 18:59.900
why the fuck would I do it?

18:59.900 --> 19:03.220
Why wouldn't I just say, well, fuck you then?

19:03.220 --> 19:04.740
I don't care about your moral righteousness.

19:04.740 --> 19:06.100
I don't care what you're slandering with.

19:06.100 --> 19:08.300
I'm going to go do something else with my time.

19:08.300 --> 19:14.980
I think the first thing that we need to understand is that all of us white people have a responsibility

19:14.980 --> 19:18.420
to engage in these conversations regularly.

19:18.420 --> 19:21.060
But when it gets hot like this, what do you do?

19:21.060 --> 19:22.060
How do you back out of that?

19:22.060 --> 19:23.060
Hold on, dude.

19:23.060 --> 19:24.060
Hold on.

19:24.060 --> 19:25.060
Hold on.

19:25.060 --> 19:26.060
Hold on.

19:26.060 --> 19:27.060
This is not a hot conversation.

19:27.060 --> 19:29.020
John needs to get in on some internet blood sports or something.

19:29.020 --> 19:31.620
I don't think he knows what a hot conversation is, but it's like I said before, we've been

19:31.620 --> 19:33.940
having these conversations for decades, lady.

19:33.940 --> 19:35.660
What has your talk done?

19:35.660 --> 19:39.620
As you sit here and talk about it and say, we've got to have conversations and I got

19:39.620 --> 19:42.940
to be able to browbeat even more people and I got to be able to call even more people

19:42.940 --> 19:47.940
racist, people like you directly vote and support policies that make the situation that

19:47.940 --> 19:49.820
you're complaining about a little bit worse.

19:49.820 --> 19:55.780
Like, for example, defunding the police that makes situations in black communities worse.

19:55.780 --> 20:00.120
Or it's at the same time, you're also voting for various city policies that don't allow

20:00.120 --> 20:03.380
people to build new low income housing in your neighborhood.

20:03.380 --> 20:07.700
To be honest, you help with the removal of opportunities for people to independently

20:07.700 --> 20:12.860
stand on their own two feet through a massive expansion of the welfare state to the point

20:12.860 --> 20:17.860
that it stops being like a good idea and it turns into a situation where people are

20:17.860 --> 20:22.700
incentivized to not stand on their own two feet, but instead simply live off welfare.

20:22.700 --> 20:24.540
And nobody wants to live off welfare.

20:24.540 --> 20:29.060
Nobody just wants to accept handouts from the government to be told this is your ration.

20:29.060 --> 20:30.060
This is all that you get.

20:30.060 --> 20:31.060
People want independence.

20:31.060 --> 20:32.060
They want freedom.

20:32.060 --> 20:36.900
They don't, they don't want a measured proportion of what some authority says that this is what

20:36.900 --> 20:37.900
you deserve.

20:37.900 --> 20:43.980
I think women like this just want to talk about these things in perpetuity and never

20:43.980 --> 20:44.980
do anything.

20:44.980 --> 20:50.620
And in fact, do things that make it worse, just so that they can continuously feel good

20:50.620 --> 20:51.620
about themselves.

20:51.620 --> 20:55.120
And if they happen to work for one of these progressive foundations or institutions, keep

20:55.120 --> 20:58.740
on raking in money for giving absolutely nothing to society.

20:58.740 --> 21:03.660
I think figuring out a way to help black kids have a stable family.

21:03.660 --> 21:05.140
The truth is it's true.

21:05.140 --> 21:06.140
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

21:06.180 --> 21:07.180
Hold on.

21:07.180 --> 21:08.180
Hold on.

21:08.180 --> 21:09.180
Is she shaking her head here?

21:09.180 --> 21:10.180
She's shaking her head here.

21:10.180 --> 21:11.180
Hold on.

21:11.180 --> 21:12.180
Lady, what are you shaking your fucking head about here?

21:12.180 --> 21:18.300
I'm pretty sure that the disintegration of the black family is a pretty big problem.

21:18.300 --> 21:19.300
And you know what?

21:19.300 --> 21:23.260
It might even be part of that lingering racism that I defined earlier.

21:23.260 --> 21:24.260
Who the fuck?

21:24.260 --> 21:25.260
Who the fuck is this person?

21:25.260 --> 21:26.260
Hold on.

21:26.260 --> 21:27.260
Overcome.

21:27.260 --> 21:29.260
And I'll start with Chip.

21:29.260 --> 21:34.060
Quality and race, Lisa Bond, the resident white woman for Race to Dinner, a group that

21:34.060 --> 21:36.520
is trying to have better conversations about race in America.

21:36.520 --> 21:37.520
Race to Dinner.

21:37.520 --> 21:38.520
Okay.

21:38.520 --> 21:42.020
He was dropping on Race to Dinner's anti-racist dinner parties.

21:42.020 --> 21:45.020
Let's check out some of these.

21:45.020 --> 21:46.020
Here's the Instagram.

21:46.020 --> 21:50.780
It's a product and a service radically honest.

21:50.780 --> 21:52.860
I think I remember these people.

21:52.860 --> 21:54.020
Yes.

21:54.020 --> 21:59.100
Why liberal white women pay a lot of money to learn over dinner how they're racist.

21:59.100 --> 22:03.360
A growing number of women are paying to confront their privilege and racism at dinners that

22:03.360 --> 22:05.400
cost $2,500.

22:05.400 --> 22:11.780
You white women, I remember I did a video on this or something years ago.

22:11.780 --> 22:19.800
White women will pay to have dinner with non-white women who lecture to them about how terrible

22:19.800 --> 22:21.900
they are.

22:21.900 --> 22:23.200
The whole dinner.

22:23.200 --> 22:25.160
I remember this.

22:25.160 --> 22:29.720
Two entrepreneurs have built a business dredging up white women's shame.

22:29.720 --> 22:31.120
Oh my God.

22:31.120 --> 22:33.360
That's who this fucking person is.

22:33.360 --> 22:34.360
Okay.

22:34.360 --> 22:36.280
This is where she's from.

22:36.280 --> 22:37.280
Okay.

22:37.280 --> 22:38.280
I understand.

22:38.280 --> 22:41.360
Now I understand where the fuck all this insanity is coming from.

22:41.360 --> 22:46.360
I think the worst part here though is Jon Stewart himself.

22:46.360 --> 22:51.620
He's literally doing to the race conversation and progressive conversations in the United

22:51.620 --> 22:52.760
States.

22:52.760 --> 22:58.920
What he complained about on Crossfire when he walked onto that show back in the 2000s

22:58.920 --> 23:01.080
and single-handedly destroyed it.

23:01.080 --> 23:03.520
I don't know if you guys remember that controversy.

23:03.520 --> 23:09.220
Crossfire was basically a debate show hosted on CNN where you had a left-leaning pundit

23:09.220 --> 23:12.520
and a right-leaning pundit debating various news topics.

23:12.520 --> 23:16.760
And Jon Stewart showed up here, I found it October 15th, 2004.

23:16.760 --> 23:21.540
He showed up on the program and basically single-handedly destroyed it.

23:21.540 --> 23:25.840
I made a special effort to come on the show today because I have privately amongst my

23:25.840 --> 23:31.960
friends and also in occasional newspapers and television shows mentioned this show as

23:31.960 --> 23:36.960
being bad.

23:36.960 --> 23:41.320
And I wanted to, I felt that that wasn't fair and I should come here and tell you that it's

23:41.320 --> 23:46.220
not so much that it's bad as it's hurting America.

23:46.220 --> 23:53.440
So I wanted to come here today and say, here's just what I wanted to tell you guys.

23:53.440 --> 23:59.760
Stop, stop, stop, stop hurting America.

23:59.760 --> 24:06.720
And come work for us because we, as the people, the people, not well, but you can sleep at

24:06.720 --> 24:07.720
night.

24:07.720 --> 24:11.680
See, the thing is, we need your help.

24:11.680 --> 24:16.440
Right now you're helping the politicians and the corporations and we're left out there

24:16.440 --> 24:17.440
to mow our lawns.

24:17.440 --> 24:18.760
You just said we're too rough on them when they make mistakes.

24:18.760 --> 24:20.200
No, no, no, you're not too rough on them.

24:20.200 --> 24:22.920
You are part of their strategies.

24:22.920 --> 24:24.840
You're partisan.

24:24.840 --> 24:25.840
What do you call it?

24:25.840 --> 24:26.840
Hacks.

24:26.840 --> 24:31.000
I actually remember watching this live when it happened because I know I'm that old, but,

24:31.000 --> 24:35.180
but a few months later, CNN canceled it because Jon Stewart had basically destroyed the reputation

24:35.180 --> 24:36.400
of that program.

24:36.400 --> 24:43.480
And now here he is on his own show doing the same thing that they did having really terrible

24:43.480 --> 24:49.320
surface level conversations with the absolute worst individuals to actually have these conversations

24:49.320 --> 24:53.040
with and actively ruining the discourse in the process.

24:53.040 --> 24:57.140
Like with this guy up here in the monitor says he was the guy who was against the rest

24:57.140 --> 24:58.140
of them.

24:58.140 --> 25:02.660
He was saying some things that were a bit off the wall, but not anything too far from

25:02.660 --> 25:06.760
what most normal politically unengaged Americans think.

25:06.760 --> 25:10.680
It's like, Hey, I'm not a white supremacist like these, like these people without any

25:10.680 --> 25:13.800
kind of like academic definitions on their side or anything, they're just thinking, I

25:13.800 --> 25:14.800
mean, slavery was bad.

25:14.800 --> 25:15.800
I'm not a white supremacist.

25:15.800 --> 25:16.800
I don't do any of that shit.

25:16.800 --> 25:17.800
I'm just getting on with my life.

25:17.800 --> 25:19.840
And yeah, that's the way that a normal person should view it.

25:19.840 --> 25:24.580
And they're just like lambasting him, like he's some kind of fucking racist and it's,

25:24.580 --> 25:25.580
it's insane.

25:25.580 --> 25:26.580
It's, it's terrible.

25:26.580 --> 25:28.480
This, this, this whole thing's been fucking cancer.

25:28.480 --> 25:33.240
Jon Stewart used to actually be able to engage in sometimes decent conversation.

25:33.240 --> 25:34.960
I don't know what the fuck happened.

25:34.960 --> 25:39.000
I think, I think he basically just fell off like everyone else on the left has recently.

25:39.000 --> 25:45.160
They all think that having a real conversation about real issues has to simply be an opportunity

25:45.160 --> 25:47.320
for you to show how good you are.

25:47.320 --> 25:49.720
And none of that helps anyone.

25:49.720 --> 25:56.720
Not being able to distinguish between real racists and tea partiers or real bigots and

25:56.720 --> 26:04.560
Juan Williams or Rick Sanchez is an insult, not only to those people, but to the racist

26:04.560 --> 26:10.040
themselves who have put in the exhausting effort it takes to hate.

26:10.040 --> 26:13.680
If I could finger snap, I would finger snap right now.

26:14.120 --> 26:15.640
Uh, let's remove it then from the-

26:15.640 --> 26:18.240
Well you'd be finger snapping without calling me a racist, Jon.

26:18.240 --> 26:22.480
Let's, let's, you're, you've been doing a pretty good job with it yourself there, so.
