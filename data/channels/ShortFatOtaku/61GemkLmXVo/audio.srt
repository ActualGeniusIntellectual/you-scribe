00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,280
Hey, I'm back. Yes, I was banned for a week. Yes, it was because of the dog pill video.

2
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:10,560
So all those plans to do the tubcast with Lilith on Kyle Rittenhouse, that pretty much went out

3
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:14,640
the window. I will still be making that content, but now it's a week late, unfortunately.

4
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:18,320
That is just how things go. But the one week ban is up, and I'm back.

5
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:22,800
There will be a weekly SIP tomorrow, there will be a Game Boomer stream tonight,

6
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:28,000
and I'll be back on the SFO content train next week. While I was gone, I did do a few things.

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,120
I got the Dev and Lilith channel set up. That will be the future home for the tubcast. It's

8
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:36,400
going to become like a weekly show. So make sure you're subbed to that channel.

9
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:41,040
I'm also probably going to be splitting off the daily 10 minute takes, the stuff that I do on

10
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:46,240
this channel, and the longer, more serious videos like the hour long essays. Those will probably be

11
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:50,720
going off onto their own channel called Devtrospective. And of course, somebody who

12
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:56,560
is not me has made the Devonatized channel, which is where you can find unmonetized re-uploads of

13
00:00:56,560 --> 00:01:02,320
some of my content that just will not work out on the main channels. I do have to formally disavow

14
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:06,800
that channel. It is, after all, not mine. But if you're wondering where some of my backlog went,

15
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:10,480
it is probably up there for everyone to see. All of these channels will be listed in the

16
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:16,720
description of this video. Please consider subbing to them. And I'm back. I'll see you guys next time.

17
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:17,600
I love you.
