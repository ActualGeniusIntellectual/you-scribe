0	5280	Hey, I'm back. Yes, I was banned for a week. Yes, it was because of the dog pill video.
5280	10560	So all those plans to do the tubcast with Lilith on Kyle Rittenhouse, that pretty much went out
10560	14640	the window. I will still be making that content, but now it's a week late, unfortunately.
14640	18320	That is just how things go. But the one week ban is up, and I'm back.
18320	22800	There will be a weekly SIP tomorrow, there will be a Game Boomer stream tonight,
22800	28000	and I'll be back on the SFO content train next week. While I was gone, I did do a few things.
28000	33120	I got the Dev and Lilith channel set up. That will be the future home for the tubcast. It's
33120	36400	going to become like a weekly show. So make sure you're subbed to that channel.
36400	41040	I'm also probably going to be splitting off the daily 10 minute takes, the stuff that I do on
41040	46240	this channel, and the longer, more serious videos like the hour long essays. Those will probably be
46240	50720	going off onto their own channel called Devtrospective. And of course, somebody who
50720	56560	is not me has made the Devonatized channel, which is where you can find unmonetized re-uploads of
56560	62320	some of my content that just will not work out on the main channels. I do have to formally disavow
62320	66800	that channel. It is, after all, not mine. But if you're wondering where some of my backlog went,
66800	70480	it is probably up there for everyone to see. All of these channels will be listed in the
70480	76720	description of this video. Please consider subbing to them. And I'm back. I'll see you guys next time.
76720	77600	I love you.
