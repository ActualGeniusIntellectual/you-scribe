Hey, I'm back. Yes, I was banned for a week. Yes, it was because of the dog pill video.

00:05.280 --> 00:10.560
So all those plans to do the tubcast with Lilith on Kyle Rittenhouse, that pretty much went out

00:10.560 --> 00:14.640
the window. I will still be making that content, but now it's a week late, unfortunately.

00:14.640 --> 00:18.320
That is just how things go. But the one week ban is up, and I'm back.

00:18.320 --> 00:22.800
There will be a weekly SIP tomorrow, there will be a Game Boomer stream tonight,

00:22.800 --> 00:28.000
and I'll be back on the SFO content train next week. While I was gone, I did do a few things.

00:28.000 --> 00:33.120
I got the Dev and Lilith channel set up. That will be the future home for the tubcast. It's

00:33.120 --> 00:36.400
going to become like a weekly show. So make sure you're subbed to that channel.

00:36.400 --> 00:41.040
I'm also probably going to be splitting off the daily 10 minute takes, the stuff that I do on

00:41.040 --> 00:46.240
this channel, and the longer, more serious videos like the hour long essays. Those will probably be

00:46.240 --> 00:50.720
going off onto their own channel called Devtrospective. And of course, somebody who

00:50.720 --> 00:56.560
is not me has made the Devonatized channel, which is where you can find unmonetized re-uploads of

00:56.560 --> 01:02.320
some of my content that just will not work out on the main channels. I do have to formally disavow

01:02.320 --> 01:06.800
that channel. It is, after all, not mine. But if you're wondering where some of my backlog went,

01:06.800 --> 01:10.480
it is probably up there for everyone to see. All of these channels will be listed in the

01:10.480 --> 01:16.720
description of this video. Please consider subbing to them. And I'm back. I'll see you guys next time.

01:16.720 --> 01:17.600
I love you.
