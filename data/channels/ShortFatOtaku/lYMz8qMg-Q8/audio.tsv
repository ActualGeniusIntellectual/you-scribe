0	5040	Ah yes, the personal is political. It's an old adage, hailing from back during the
5040	9200	genesis of second wave feminism. The phrase first gained traction as the title of one
9200	13920	of Carol Haneck's publications from 1969, where she exclaims that the problems women
13920	19920	have aren't personal problems requiring therapy, but political problems requiring systemic change.
19920	24640	But not only that, she also says personal problems are political problems. There are
24640	29760	no personal solutions at this time. There is only collective action for a collective solution.
30000	35120	I prefer to call even this aspect political therapy, as opposed to personal therapy. The
35120	39600	most important is getting rid of self-blame. Can you imagine what would happen if women,
39600	44080	blacks, and workers, my definition of worker is anyone who has to work for a living as
44080	48400	opposed to those who don't, all women are workers, would stop blaming ourselves for
48400	53360	our sad situations? It seems to me the whole country needs that kind of political therapy.
53360	58080	In essence, Haneck attempted to put forward the idea that the issues of sex, appearance,
58080	62640	abortion, childcare, and the division of household labor were not simply personal
62640	67280	problems for individual women to solve to their own satisfaction, but political problems requiring
67280	72240	collective action. Since then, the definition has expanded. Now, the personal is political
72240	76960	means that a culture warrior has no personal, private life. It's all activism. It's all
76960	81520	political. That's why, for example, feminism isn't about personal choice, as the social
81520	85760	justice warriors like to tell us. If you happen to be a naturally submissive woman,
85760	90560	living a traditional lifestyle, that's oppressive and patriarchal. Your personal desires,
90560	95280	your choices don't matter, because what you do affects how other women are treated,
95280	100240	as your private life diffuses in some small way into the larger culture. The personal is
100240	104480	political. And because of that, the implication is, when there's a clash between the two,
104480	109120	the political takes precedent over the personal. And then the definition expanded again. The new
109120	114400	phrase I see being thrown around now is, everything is political. Not just the personal,
114400	119680	but all areas of life, all of existence is political. Here, let's watch postmodernism
119680	123520	instantly devour itself. The answer to the challenges of the new millennium is not more
123520	127920	state intervention, but to eliminate politics in the state. The elimination of the state is
127920	132560	the SJW wet dream, because the state is a structure, and all structures are, of course,
132560	137120	inherently oppressive. That's why you have open border advocates claiming that citizenship is
137120	142480	racism, and chanting no USA at all at their rallies. But here's the counterpoint, right out
142480	147040	of the same philosophy. Eliminate politics, everything is political. Capitalism is a
147040	151760	political choice by the rich, and it's a system of exploitation. That's postmodernism for you,
151760	156000	simultaneously wishing for the destruction of the political, while exclaiming that everything is
156000	161280	political. These people want to wage war on being itself, much the same way that the most violent
161280	166080	among us do every time they shoot up a mosque, or drive a van into the kefir. Politics of
166080	172400	attractiveness, pretty privilege. Yes, everything is political. You will be judged by every possible
173360	178320	metric of your life. I will throw a table at the next person who says, stop making everything
178320	184480	political. Everything is political. Everything involves power. Everything involves people.
184480	188880	Get used to it. Hey, do you want a break from the culture war? Want to get off Twitter,
188880	193760	recharge your batteries, play a video game for fun? Well, fuck you. There's no break.
193760	198080	There's no escape. Everything is political. You think you're just sitting there benignly playing
198080	203280	Mario Brothers and unwinding? If Anita Sarkeesian has taught me anything, it's that everything is
203280	208560	sexist, everything is racist, everything is homophobic, and you have to point it all out.
208560	213280	No fun allowed, guys. Speaking of video games, the first time I personally heard the phrase
213280	217360	everything is political was from the fat, soy-beard, Jesse Cox stand-in,
217360	224720	game journalist character from Life is Strange 2. I come from a family with money, but no soul.
224720	232720	I took off after school and never looked back. Now I write stories for zines and websites,
232720	240240	do podcasts, protest, try to make some positive change. Whatever. Wow, so you're like all
240880	248240	political. Everything is political, Sean. Yeah, this was another of the games that my friend and
248240	253600	I laughed our asses off on my Twitch channel at. It was a hilariously bad shit show. Maybe I should
253680	258560	call ICE to make sure you're a citizen. Fuck you, hillbilly. I'm American.
260400	266320	Shut up, thief. Just let me go. Please. You're the reason we need to build that wall.
266960	271440	But Life is Strange 2 got me thinking about it. The whole everything is political stuff.
271440	275760	It's an idea I couldn't quite articulate. Maybe it was a little bit beyond me. But recently,
275760	280240	my good pal V managed to put it together for me. By the way, I realized something.
280240	285120	When the SJWs say everything is political, that's cultural fascism. It's similar to
285120	288640	everything is within the state, nothing outside the state. Everything is political,
288640	294480	nothing is nonpolitical. What V's referring to is Mussolini's doctrine of fascism from 1932.
294480	298960	Liberalism denied the state in the interests of the particular individual. Fascism reaffirms the
298960	304080	state as the true reality of the individual. And if liberty is to be the attribute of the real man
304080	308960	and not of that abstract puppet envisaged by the individualistic liberalism, fascism is for
308960	314160	liberty. And for the only liberty which can be a real thing, the liberty of the state and of the
314160	319280	individual within the state. Therefore, for the fascist, everything is in the state and nothing
319280	325200	human or spiritual exists, much less has value outside the state. In this sense, fascism is
325200	331280	totalitarian, and the fascist state, the synthesis and unity of all values, interprets, develops,
331280	335680	and gives strength to the whole life of the people. This same idea was more succinctly
335680	341360	referred to in a speech Mussolini gave in 1926. Here I wish to reaffirm solemnly our doctrine of
341360	346560	the state, everything in the state, nothing against the state, nothing outside the state.
346560	351840	And it's this quotation that V is referencing that ultimately became famous to describe totalitarian
351840	356800	ideologies. That would be why they're totalitarian. They claim to contain the total sum of all things,
356800	362320	nothing outside the state, everything within the state. If cultural Marxism is the SJW attempt to
362320	366960	utilize cultural pushback to address their perception of inequality by promoting political
366960	372480	correctness and multiculturalism at the expense of individual liberty and free speech, similar to how
372480	377760	regular Marxism uses economic pushback to achieve the same goals, then cultural fascism must be the
377760	382160	SJW attempt to render all things within their domain, with nothing of value opposing it and
382160	386400	nothing existing outside of it, similar to the fascist conception of the state. This is why V
386400	391040	conceptualized the phrase everything is political as cultural fascism. But there are also other
391040	395680	examples. Every single time a social justice warrior tells you snarkily, if you believe in
395680	399920	the equality of women, then you're a feminist, and that's that. That's cultural fascism. It's
399920	405040	taking all possible outcomes of the conversation into their domain and regulating it as such,
405040	409920	making you either a rank and file soldier under their command or a demonized enemy. There's no
409920	414240	middle ground. There's nothing outside of the political. Or when you see wildly different people
414240	419520	reduced to simply being a Nazi because they're not radical lefties. That's cultural fascism at work.
419520	424400	If nothing of value exists within their state, then everything opposing them must simply be a
424400	429840	part of the same valueless blob they call Nazi. It's why the argument is commonly put forth that
429840	434640	if you're against Nazis, you're Antifa. No nuances allowed. But the danger of cultural fascism
434640	440000	extends beyond even this. It gets worse. The problem is, as humans, there's a gigantic gap
440000	444560	between what we can articulate and what we know but can't quite say yet, and an even bigger gap
444560	448800	between what we know and can't quite say and what we don't know at all. Long story short,
448800	453520	it's impossible for us to know all things, let alone articulate them. For example, the law is
453520	457840	our attempt to codify what we know, but the law is incomplete by design. I'm sure that's a
457840	461600	politician's nightmare. I'm sure they'd love the law to be all-encompassing, but it can't and it
461600	467040	never will be. That's why any expanding bureaucracy is ultimately totalitarian. The EU might have a
467040	470960	semblance of democracy, but when they begin regulating the length of bananas or the size
470960	475680	of light bulbs, the whole everything within the state, nothing outside of the state phrase comes
475680	480560	to mind, doesn't it? But because law is necessarily incomplete, it has to rest on an
480560	485360	indescribable foundation. In some sense, as unfinished of a line of thought as this is,
485360	489280	the law has to be subordinate to the mediation between what we can articulate, what we know,
489280	493280	and what we don't know. I think this is what people commonly describe as the spirit of the
493280	498560	law as opposed to the letter. These ideas aren't fully articulated. At least, not fully articulated
498560	503520	by me, obviously. But I still think that if law doesn't aim at those things properly, it would
503520	507920	have no moral force behind it. It would be like looking up words in a dictionary if you didn't
507920	512480	understand the concept of words. Definitions refer to other definitions, but the words refer
512480	516640	to something else, something not fully understood. And if those forces aren't in accordance, the
516640	521120	whole thing collapses. This is the deepest problem with cultural fascism. Whether it's Richard
521120	526160	Spencer dreaming of a white ethnostate or Cher dreaming of male castration facilities, utopian
526160	530480	ideologues completely dispense with the idea that something can only be partially known and not
530480	536480	articulated. As a necessary precursor of building paradise, they say, this is what the law is, or
536480	541760	this is what the words mean, or this is what we have to do. Nothing outside of this, nothing
541760	546320	opposing this. And in failing to leave space for what they only kind of know and what they don't
546320	551760	know at all, their totalitarian structures become ever-expanding, unwieldy, inefficient, and toxic
551760	556720	to human life. And when things get that big, when bureaucracy becomes indistinguishable from reality,
556720	562240	when everything is political, fractures begin to appear, groups break off, interests become
562240	567360	entrenched, purity spirals begin, and inevitably the whole thing collapses under the hubris of its
567360	572240	creators, who had the audacity to exclaim that the sum total of human existence could be encapsulated
572240	577120	within their shitty ideology. I think I'm proving my own point here in a weird way. This is an idea
577120	582800	I couldn't even begin to articulate until V coined the term cultural fascism, and I still feel like
582800	587440	I'm not even close to the mark yet. But maybe it's something like this. If anybody says to you,
587440	592000	everything is political, their worldview is a totalitarian one. They don't know what it actually
592000	596480	means for all things to be political, because they're too arrogant to understand just how
596480	600880	important the interplay between the known and the unknown truly is.
