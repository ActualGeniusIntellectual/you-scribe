00:00.000 --> 00:05.040
Ah yes, the personal is political. It's an old adage, hailing from back during the

00:05.040 --> 00:09.200
genesis of second wave feminism. The phrase first gained traction as the title of one

00:09.200 --> 00:13.920
of Carol Haneck's publications from 1969, where she exclaims that the problems women

00:13.920 --> 00:19.920
have aren't personal problems requiring therapy, but political problems requiring systemic change.

00:19.920 --> 00:24.640
But not only that, she also says personal problems are political problems. There are

00:24.640 --> 00:29.760
no personal solutions at this time. There is only collective action for a collective solution.

00:30.000 --> 00:35.120
I prefer to call even this aspect political therapy, as opposed to personal therapy. The

00:35.120 --> 00:39.600
most important is getting rid of self-blame. Can you imagine what would happen if women,

00:39.600 --> 00:44.080
blacks, and workers, my definition of worker is anyone who has to work for a living as

00:44.080 --> 00:48.400
opposed to those who don't, all women are workers, would stop blaming ourselves for

00:48.400 --> 00:53.360
our sad situations? It seems to me the whole country needs that kind of political therapy.

00:53.360 --> 00:58.080
In essence, Haneck attempted to put forward the idea that the issues of sex, appearance,

00:58.080 --> 01:02.640
abortion, childcare, and the division of household labor were not simply personal

01:02.640 --> 01:07.280
problems for individual women to solve to their own satisfaction, but political problems requiring

01:07.280 --> 01:12.240
collective action. Since then, the definition has expanded. Now, the personal is political

01:12.240 --> 01:16.960
means that a culture warrior has no personal, private life. It's all activism. It's all

01:16.960 --> 01:21.520
political. That's why, for example, feminism isn't about personal choice, as the social

01:21.520 --> 01:25.760
justice warriors like to tell us. If you happen to be a naturally submissive woman,

01:25.760 --> 01:30.560
living a traditional lifestyle, that's oppressive and patriarchal. Your personal desires,

01:30.560 --> 01:35.280
your choices don't matter, because what you do affects how other women are treated,

01:35.280 --> 01:40.240
as your private life diffuses in some small way into the larger culture. The personal is

01:40.240 --> 01:44.480
political. And because of that, the implication is, when there's a clash between the two,

01:44.480 --> 01:49.120
the political takes precedent over the personal. And then the definition expanded again. The new

01:49.120 --> 01:54.400
phrase I see being thrown around now is, everything is political. Not just the personal,

01:54.400 --> 01:59.680
but all areas of life, all of existence is political. Here, let's watch postmodernism

01:59.680 --> 02:03.520
instantly devour itself. The answer to the challenges of the new millennium is not more

02:03.520 --> 02:07.920
state intervention, but to eliminate politics in the state. The elimination of the state is

02:07.920 --> 02:12.560
the SJW wet dream, because the state is a structure, and all structures are, of course,

02:12.560 --> 02:17.120
inherently oppressive. That's why you have open border advocates claiming that citizenship is

02:17.120 --> 02:22.480
racism, and chanting no USA at all at their rallies. But here's the counterpoint, right out

02:22.480 --> 02:27.040
of the same philosophy. Eliminate politics, everything is political. Capitalism is a

02:27.040 --> 02:31.760
political choice by the rich, and it's a system of exploitation. That's postmodernism for you,

02:31.760 --> 02:36.000
simultaneously wishing for the destruction of the political, while exclaiming that everything is

02:36.000 --> 02:41.280
political. These people want to wage war on being itself, much the same way that the most violent

02:41.280 --> 02:46.080
among us do every time they shoot up a mosque, or drive a van into the kefir. Politics of

02:46.080 --> 02:52.400
attractiveness, pretty privilege. Yes, everything is political. You will be judged by every possible

02:53.360 --> 02:58.320
metric of your life. I will throw a table at the next person who says, stop making everything

02:58.320 --> 03:04.480
political. Everything is political. Everything involves power. Everything involves people.

03:04.480 --> 03:08.880
Get used to it. Hey, do you want a break from the culture war? Want to get off Twitter,

03:08.880 --> 03:13.760
recharge your batteries, play a video game for fun? Well, fuck you. There's no break.

03:13.760 --> 03:18.080
There's no escape. Everything is political. You think you're just sitting there benignly playing

03:18.080 --> 03:23.280
Mario Brothers and unwinding? If Anita Sarkeesian has taught me anything, it's that everything is

03:23.280 --> 03:28.560
sexist, everything is racist, everything is homophobic, and you have to point it all out.

03:28.560 --> 03:33.280
No fun allowed, guys. Speaking of video games, the first time I personally heard the phrase

03:33.280 --> 03:37.360
everything is political was from the fat, soy-beard, Jesse Cox stand-in,

03:37.360 --> 03:44.720
game journalist character from Life is Strange 2. I come from a family with money, but no soul.

03:44.720 --> 03:52.720
I took off after school and never looked back. Now I write stories for zines and websites,

03:52.720 --> 04:00.240
do podcasts, protest, try to make some positive change. Whatever. Wow, so you're like all

04:00.880 --> 04:08.240
political. Everything is political, Sean. Yeah, this was another of the games that my friend and

04:08.240 --> 04:13.600
I laughed our asses off on my Twitch channel at. It was a hilariously bad shit show. Maybe I should

04:13.680 --> 04:18.560
call ICE to make sure you're a citizen. Fuck you, hillbilly. I'm American.

04:20.400 --> 04:26.320
Shut up, thief. Just let me go. Please. You're the reason we need to build that wall.

04:26.960 --> 04:31.440
But Life is Strange 2 got me thinking about it. The whole everything is political stuff.

04:31.440 --> 04:35.760
It's an idea I couldn't quite articulate. Maybe it was a little bit beyond me. But recently,

04:35.760 --> 04:40.240
my good pal V managed to put it together for me. By the way, I realized something.

04:40.240 --> 04:45.120
When the SJWs say everything is political, that's cultural fascism. It's similar to

04:45.120 --> 04:48.640
everything is within the state, nothing outside the state. Everything is political,

04:48.640 --> 04:54.480
nothing is nonpolitical. What V's referring to is Mussolini's doctrine of fascism from 1932.

04:54.480 --> 04:58.960
Liberalism denied the state in the interests of the particular individual. Fascism reaffirms the

04:58.960 --> 05:04.080
state as the true reality of the individual. And if liberty is to be the attribute of the real man

05:04.080 --> 05:08.960
and not of that abstract puppet envisaged by the individualistic liberalism, fascism is for

05:08.960 --> 05:14.160
liberty. And for the only liberty which can be a real thing, the liberty of the state and of the

05:14.160 --> 05:19.280
individual within the state. Therefore, for the fascist, everything is in the state and nothing

05:19.280 --> 05:25.200
human or spiritual exists, much less has value outside the state. In this sense, fascism is

05:25.200 --> 05:31.280
totalitarian, and the fascist state, the synthesis and unity of all values, interprets, develops,

05:31.280 --> 05:35.680
and gives strength to the whole life of the people. This same idea was more succinctly

05:35.680 --> 05:41.360
referred to in a speech Mussolini gave in 1926. Here I wish to reaffirm solemnly our doctrine of

05:41.360 --> 05:46.560
the state, everything in the state, nothing against the state, nothing outside the state.

05:46.560 --> 05:51.840
And it's this quotation that V is referencing that ultimately became famous to describe totalitarian

05:51.840 --> 05:56.800
ideologies. That would be why they're totalitarian. They claim to contain the total sum of all things,

05:56.800 --> 06:02.320
nothing outside the state, everything within the state. If cultural Marxism is the SJW attempt to

06:02.320 --> 06:06.960
utilize cultural pushback to address their perception of inequality by promoting political

06:06.960 --> 06:12.480
correctness and multiculturalism at the expense of individual liberty and free speech, similar to how

06:12.480 --> 06:17.760
regular Marxism uses economic pushback to achieve the same goals, then cultural fascism must be the

06:17.760 --> 06:22.160
SJW attempt to render all things within their domain, with nothing of value opposing it and

06:22.160 --> 06:26.400
nothing existing outside of it, similar to the fascist conception of the state. This is why V

06:26.400 --> 06:31.040
conceptualized the phrase everything is political as cultural fascism. But there are also other

06:31.040 --> 06:35.680
examples. Every single time a social justice warrior tells you snarkily, if you believe in

06:35.680 --> 06:39.920
the equality of women, then you're a feminist, and that's that. That's cultural fascism. It's

06:39.920 --> 06:45.040
taking all possible outcomes of the conversation into their domain and regulating it as such,

06:45.040 --> 06:49.920
making you either a rank and file soldier under their command or a demonized enemy. There's no

06:49.920 --> 06:54.240
middle ground. There's nothing outside of the political. Or when you see wildly different people

06:54.240 --> 06:59.520
reduced to simply being a Nazi because they're not radical lefties. That's cultural fascism at work.

06:59.520 --> 07:04.400
If nothing of value exists within their state, then everything opposing them must simply be a

07:04.400 --> 07:09.840
part of the same valueless blob they call Nazi. It's why the argument is commonly put forth that

07:09.840 --> 07:14.640
if you're against Nazis, you're Antifa. No nuances allowed. But the danger of cultural fascism

07:14.640 --> 07:20.000
extends beyond even this. It gets worse. The problem is, as humans, there's a gigantic gap

07:20.000 --> 07:24.560
between what we can articulate and what we know but can't quite say yet, and an even bigger gap

07:24.560 --> 07:28.800
between what we know and can't quite say and what we don't know at all. Long story short,

07:28.800 --> 07:33.520
it's impossible for us to know all things, let alone articulate them. For example, the law is

07:33.520 --> 07:37.840
our attempt to codify what we know, but the law is incomplete by design. I'm sure that's a

07:37.840 --> 07:41.600
politician's nightmare. I'm sure they'd love the law to be all-encompassing, but it can't and it

07:41.600 --> 07:47.040
never will be. That's why any expanding bureaucracy is ultimately totalitarian. The EU might have a

07:47.040 --> 07:50.960
semblance of democracy, but when they begin regulating the length of bananas or the size

07:50.960 --> 07:55.680
of light bulbs, the whole everything within the state, nothing outside of the state phrase comes

07:55.680 --> 08:00.560
to mind, doesn't it? But because law is necessarily incomplete, it has to rest on an

08:00.560 --> 08:05.360
indescribable foundation. In some sense, as unfinished of a line of thought as this is,

08:05.360 --> 08:09.280
the law has to be subordinate to the mediation between what we can articulate, what we know,

08:09.280 --> 08:13.280
and what we don't know. I think this is what people commonly describe as the spirit of the

08:13.280 --> 08:18.560
law as opposed to the letter. These ideas aren't fully articulated. At least, not fully articulated

08:18.560 --> 08:23.520
by me, obviously. But I still think that if law doesn't aim at those things properly, it would

08:23.520 --> 08:27.920
have no moral force behind it. It would be like looking up words in a dictionary if you didn't

08:27.920 --> 08:32.480
understand the concept of words. Definitions refer to other definitions, but the words refer

08:32.480 --> 08:36.640
to something else, something not fully understood. And if those forces aren't in accordance, the

08:36.640 --> 08:41.120
whole thing collapses. This is the deepest problem with cultural fascism. Whether it's Richard

08:41.120 --> 08:46.160
Spencer dreaming of a white ethnostate or Cher dreaming of male castration facilities, utopian

08:46.160 --> 08:50.480
ideologues completely dispense with the idea that something can only be partially known and not

08:50.480 --> 08:56.480
articulated. As a necessary precursor of building paradise, they say, this is what the law is, or

08:56.480 --> 09:01.760
this is what the words mean, or this is what we have to do. Nothing outside of this, nothing

09:01.760 --> 09:06.320
opposing this. And in failing to leave space for what they only kind of know and what they don't

09:06.320 --> 09:11.760
know at all, their totalitarian structures become ever-expanding, unwieldy, inefficient, and toxic

09:11.760 --> 09:16.720
to human life. And when things get that big, when bureaucracy becomes indistinguishable from reality,

09:16.720 --> 09:22.240
when everything is political, fractures begin to appear, groups break off, interests become

09:22.240 --> 09:27.360
entrenched, purity spirals begin, and inevitably the whole thing collapses under the hubris of its

09:27.360 --> 09:32.240
creators, who had the audacity to exclaim that the sum total of human existence could be encapsulated

09:32.240 --> 09:37.120
within their shitty ideology. I think I'm proving my own point here in a weird way. This is an idea

09:37.120 --> 09:42.800
I couldn't even begin to articulate until V coined the term cultural fascism, and I still feel like

09:42.800 --> 09:47.440
I'm not even close to the mark yet. But maybe it's something like this. If anybody says to you,

09:47.440 --> 09:52.000
everything is political, their worldview is a totalitarian one. They don't know what it actually

09:52.000 --> 09:56.480
means for all things to be political, because they're too arrogant to understand just how

09:56.480 --> 10:00.880
important the interplay between the known and the unknown truly is.
