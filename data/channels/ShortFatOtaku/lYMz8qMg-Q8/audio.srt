1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,040
Ah yes, the personal is political. It's an old adage, hailing from back during the

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:09,200
genesis of second wave feminism. The phrase first gained traction as the title of one

3
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:13,920
of Carol Haneck's publications from 1969, where she exclaims that the problems women

4
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:19,920
have aren't personal problems requiring therapy, but political problems requiring systemic change.

5
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:24,640
But not only that, she also says personal problems are political problems. There are

6
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:29,760
no personal solutions at this time. There is only collective action for a collective solution.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,120
I prefer to call even this aspect political therapy, as opposed to personal therapy. The

8
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:39,600
most important is getting rid of self-blame. Can you imagine what would happen if women,

9
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:44,080
blacks, and workers, my definition of worker is anyone who has to work for a living as

10
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:48,400
opposed to those who don't, all women are workers, would stop blaming ourselves for

11
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:53,360
our sad situations? It seems to me the whole country needs that kind of political therapy.

12
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:58,080
In essence, Haneck attempted to put forward the idea that the issues of sex, appearance,

13
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:02,640
abortion, childcare, and the division of household labor were not simply personal

14
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:07,280
problems for individual women to solve to their own satisfaction, but political problems requiring

15
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:12,240
collective action. Since then, the definition has expanded. Now, the personal is political

16
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:16,960
means that a culture warrior has no personal, private life. It's all activism. It's all

17
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:21,520
political. That's why, for example, feminism isn't about personal choice, as the social

18
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:25,760
justice warriors like to tell us. If you happen to be a naturally submissive woman,

19
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:30,560
living a traditional lifestyle, that's oppressive and patriarchal. Your personal desires,

20
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:35,280
your choices don't matter, because what you do affects how other women are treated,

21
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:40,240
as your private life diffuses in some small way into the larger culture. The personal is

22
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:44,480
political. And because of that, the implication is, when there's a clash between the two,

23
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:49,120
the political takes precedent over the personal. And then the definition expanded again. The new

24
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:54,400
phrase I see being thrown around now is, everything is political. Not just the personal,

25
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:59,680
but all areas of life, all of existence is political. Here, let's watch postmodernism

26
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:03,520
instantly devour itself. The answer to the challenges of the new millennium is not more

27
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:07,920
state intervention, but to eliminate politics in the state. The elimination of the state is

28
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:12,560
the SJW wet dream, because the state is a structure, and all structures are, of course,

29
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:17,120
inherently oppressive. That's why you have open border advocates claiming that citizenship is

30
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:22,480
racism, and chanting no USA at all at their rallies. But here's the counterpoint, right out

31
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:27,040
of the same philosophy. Eliminate politics, everything is political. Capitalism is a

32
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:31,760
political choice by the rich, and it's a system of exploitation. That's postmodernism for you,

33
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:36,000
simultaneously wishing for the destruction of the political, while exclaiming that everything is

34
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,280
political. These people want to wage war on being itself, much the same way that the most violent

35
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:46,080
among us do every time they shoot up a mosque, or drive a van into the kefir. Politics of

36
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:52,400
attractiveness, pretty privilege. Yes, everything is political. You will be judged by every possible

37
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:58,320
metric of your life. I will throw a table at the next person who says, stop making everything

38
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:04,480
political. Everything is political. Everything involves power. Everything involves people.

39
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:08,880
Get used to it. Hey, do you want a break from the culture war? Want to get off Twitter,

40
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:13,760
recharge your batteries, play a video game for fun? Well, fuck you. There's no break.

41
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:18,080
There's no escape. Everything is political. You think you're just sitting there benignly playing

42
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:23,280
Mario Brothers and unwinding? If Anita Sarkeesian has taught me anything, it's that everything is

43
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:28,560
sexist, everything is racist, everything is homophobic, and you have to point it all out.

44
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:33,280
No fun allowed, guys. Speaking of video games, the first time I personally heard the phrase

45
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:37,360
everything is political was from the fat, soy-beard, Jesse Cox stand-in,

46
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:44,720
game journalist character from Life is Strange 2. I come from a family with money, but no soul.

47
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:52,720
I took off after school and never looked back. Now I write stories for zines and websites,

48
00:03:52,720 --> 00:04:00,240
do podcasts, protest, try to make some positive change. Whatever. Wow, so you're like all

49
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:08,240
political. Everything is political, Sean. Yeah, this was another of the games that my friend and

50
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:13,600
I laughed our asses off on my Twitch channel at. It was a hilariously bad shit show. Maybe I should

51
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:18,560
call ICE to make sure you're a citizen. Fuck you, hillbilly. I'm American.

52
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:26,320
Shut up, thief. Just let me go. Please. You're the reason we need to build that wall.

53
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:31,440
But Life is Strange 2 got me thinking about it. The whole everything is political stuff.

54
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:35,760
It's an idea I couldn't quite articulate. Maybe it was a little bit beyond me. But recently,

55
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:40,240
my good pal V managed to put it together for me. By the way, I realized something.

56
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:45,120
When the SJWs say everything is political, that's cultural fascism. It's similar to

57
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:48,640
everything is within the state, nothing outside the state. Everything is political,

58
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:54,480
nothing is nonpolitical. What V's referring to is Mussolini's doctrine of fascism from 1932.

59
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:58,960
Liberalism denied the state in the interests of the particular individual. Fascism reaffirms the

60
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:04,080
state as the true reality of the individual. And if liberty is to be the attribute of the real man

61
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:08,960
and not of that abstract puppet envisaged by the individualistic liberalism, fascism is for

62
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:14,160
liberty. And for the only liberty which can be a real thing, the liberty of the state and of the

63
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:19,280
individual within the state. Therefore, for the fascist, everything is in the state and nothing

64
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:25,200
human or spiritual exists, much less has value outside the state. In this sense, fascism is

65
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:31,280
totalitarian, and the fascist state, the synthesis and unity of all values, interprets, develops,

66
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:35,680
and gives strength to the whole life of the people. This same idea was more succinctly

67
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:41,360
referred to in a speech Mussolini gave in 1926. Here I wish to reaffirm solemnly our doctrine of

68
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:46,560
the state, everything in the state, nothing against the state, nothing outside the state.

69
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:51,840
And it's this quotation that V is referencing that ultimately became famous to describe totalitarian

70
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:56,800
ideologies. That would be why they're totalitarian. They claim to contain the total sum of all things,

71
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:02,320
nothing outside the state, everything within the state. If cultural Marxism is the SJW attempt to

72
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:06,960
utilize cultural pushback to address their perception of inequality by promoting political

73
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:12,480
correctness and multiculturalism at the expense of individual liberty and free speech, similar to how

74
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:17,760
regular Marxism uses economic pushback to achieve the same goals, then cultural fascism must be the

75
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:22,160
SJW attempt to render all things within their domain, with nothing of value opposing it and

76
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:26,400
nothing existing outside of it, similar to the fascist conception of the state. This is why V

77
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:31,040
conceptualized the phrase everything is political as cultural fascism. But there are also other

78
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:35,680
examples. Every single time a social justice warrior tells you snarkily, if you believe in

79
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:39,920
the equality of women, then you're a feminist, and that's that. That's cultural fascism. It's

80
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:45,040
taking all possible outcomes of the conversation into their domain and regulating it as such,

81
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:49,920
making you either a rank and file soldier under their command or a demonized enemy. There's no

82
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:54,240
middle ground. There's nothing outside of the political. Or when you see wildly different people

83
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:59,520
reduced to simply being a Nazi because they're not radical lefties. That's cultural fascism at work.

84
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:04,400
If nothing of value exists within their state, then everything opposing them must simply be a

85
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:09,840
part of the same valueless blob they call Nazi. It's why the argument is commonly put forth that

86
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:14,640
if you're against Nazis, you're Antifa. No nuances allowed. But the danger of cultural fascism

87
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:20,000
extends beyond even this. It gets worse. The problem is, as humans, there's a gigantic gap

88
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,560
between what we can articulate and what we know but can't quite say yet, and an even bigger gap

89
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:28,800
between what we know and can't quite say and what we don't know at all. Long story short,

90
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:33,520
it's impossible for us to know all things, let alone articulate them. For example, the law is

91
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:37,840
our attempt to codify what we know, but the law is incomplete by design. I'm sure that's a

92
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:41,600
politician's nightmare. I'm sure they'd love the law to be all-encompassing, but it can't and it

93
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:47,040
never will be. That's why any expanding bureaucracy is ultimately totalitarian. The EU might have a

94
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:50,960
semblance of democracy, but when they begin regulating the length of bananas or the size

95
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:55,680
of light bulbs, the whole everything within the state, nothing outside of the state phrase comes

96
00:07:55,680 --> 00:08:00,560
to mind, doesn't it? But because law is necessarily incomplete, it has to rest on an

97
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:05,360
indescribable foundation. In some sense, as unfinished of a line of thought as this is,

98
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:09,280
the law has to be subordinate to the mediation between what we can articulate, what we know,

99
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:13,280
and what we don't know. I think this is what people commonly describe as the spirit of the

100
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:18,560
law as opposed to the letter. These ideas aren't fully articulated. At least, not fully articulated

101
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:23,520
by me, obviously. But I still think that if law doesn't aim at those things properly, it would

102
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:27,920
have no moral force behind it. It would be like looking up words in a dictionary if you didn't

103
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:32,480
understand the concept of words. Definitions refer to other definitions, but the words refer

104
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:36,640
to something else, something not fully understood. And if those forces aren't in accordance, the

105
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:41,120
whole thing collapses. This is the deepest problem with cultural fascism. Whether it's Richard

106
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:46,160
Spencer dreaming of a white ethnostate or Cher dreaming of male castration facilities, utopian

107
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:50,480
ideologues completely dispense with the idea that something can only be partially known and not

108
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:56,480
articulated. As a necessary precursor of building paradise, they say, this is what the law is, or

109
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:01,760
this is what the words mean, or this is what we have to do. Nothing outside of this, nothing

110
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:06,320
opposing this. And in failing to leave space for what they only kind of know and what they don't

111
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:11,760
know at all, their totalitarian structures become ever-expanding, unwieldy, inefficient, and toxic

112
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:16,720
to human life. And when things get that big, when bureaucracy becomes indistinguishable from reality,

113
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:22,240
when everything is political, fractures begin to appear, groups break off, interests become

114
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:27,360
entrenched, purity spirals begin, and inevitably the whole thing collapses under the hubris of its

115
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:32,240
creators, who had the audacity to exclaim that the sum total of human existence could be encapsulated

116
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:37,120
within their shitty ideology. I think I'm proving my own point here in a weird way. This is an idea

117
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:42,800
I couldn't even begin to articulate until V coined the term cultural fascism, and I still feel like

118
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:47,440
I'm not even close to the mark yet. But maybe it's something like this. If anybody says to you,

119
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:52,000
everything is political, their worldview is a totalitarian one. They don't know what it actually

120
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,480
means for all things to be political, because they're too arrogant to understand just how

121
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:00,880
important the interplay between the known and the unknown truly is.
