00:00.000 --> 00:04.480
Hello and welcome to TikTok Tuesday, my friends.

00:04.480 --> 00:08.720
The new Discord is up, donors only, sorry guys, and you guys have been dropping some

00:08.720 --> 00:09.720
TikToks in there.

00:09.720 --> 00:10.720
I'll make sure to get to them too.

00:10.720 --> 00:14.080
I have my own backlog of TikToks saved as well, but don't worry, yours is also on the

00:14.080 --> 00:15.080
list.

00:15.080 --> 00:16.080
Thanks very much for giving them to me.

00:16.080 --> 00:18.080
Let's see what nonsense you guys have collected for this week.

00:18.080 --> 00:26.800
This is a PSA for anybody that likes to pay for the group tab and act like a baller.

00:26.800 --> 00:27.800
Ballin'!

00:27.800 --> 00:28.800
Oh, God.

00:28.800 --> 00:29.800
Okay, let's see it.

00:29.800 --> 00:30.800
Let's see it.

00:30.800 --> 00:31.800
Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:31.800 --> 00:32.800
Ooh.

00:32.800 --> 00:33.800
Bitch.

00:33.800 --> 00:34.800
Yeah?

00:34.800 --> 00:54.480
That smile at the end is when you know that, like, okay, dude, this is at least partially

00:54.480 --> 00:55.480
an act, right?

00:55.480 --> 00:56.480
It's gotta be.

00:57.440 --> 00:59.440
That's 10%, right?

00:59.440 --> 01:00.440
Canada's a bit different than America.

01:00.440 --> 01:03.320
I don't know how, I don't know what Americans do.

01:03.320 --> 01:06.080
Tipping is just, in general, obnoxious.

01:06.080 --> 01:09.240
And people who think that they just blanket deserve tips?

01:09.240 --> 01:10.240
No way, dude.

01:10.240 --> 01:11.800
And servers who complain about them?

01:11.800 --> 01:13.300
You're lucky you got the five.

01:13.300 --> 01:14.460
There's no obligation here.

01:14.460 --> 01:15.460
Fuck you.

01:15.460 --> 01:16.460
I hate tipping culture, dude.

01:16.460 --> 01:17.460
I fuckin' hate it.

01:17.460 --> 01:19.960
Whoa, whoa, hold on, hold on.

01:19.960 --> 01:20.960
Music.

01:20.960 --> 01:21.960
Music.

01:21.960 --> 01:22.960
Okay.

01:22.960 --> 01:23.960
What am I looking at?

01:24.960 --> 01:25.960
What?

01:25.960 --> 01:26.960
Is this?

01:26.960 --> 01:27.960
Oh, it's Madonna.

01:27.960 --> 01:28.960
It says Madonna Live.

01:28.960 --> 01:29.960
That's a TikTok account.

01:29.960 --> 01:30.960
Hold on, we gotta play that again.

01:30.960 --> 01:35.720
Yeah, dude, it's Madonna in the futuristic space suit holding onto a bar so she doesn't

01:35.720 --> 01:37.440
fall over because she's like fucking 80.

01:37.440 --> 01:41.920
Okay, we've all seen those pictures, right, of like how Madonna looks like an alien after

01:41.920 --> 01:42.920
the plastic surgery.

01:42.920 --> 01:45.360
Well, looking like this, she ain't beating the alien allegations.

01:45.360 --> 01:47.560
Listen, no one wants to get old, right?

01:47.560 --> 01:48.560
I understand it.

01:48.560 --> 01:51.700
You can't be the young new thing forever.

01:51.700 --> 01:53.220
One day you will get old.

01:53.220 --> 01:55.800
One day all of your physical beauty will disappear.

01:55.800 --> 01:57.060
One day you will die.

01:57.060 --> 02:00.740
And frankly, efforts to prevent this tend to just make you look more inhuman, especially

02:00.740 --> 02:02.060
if it's like plastic surgery and stuff.

02:02.060 --> 02:04.060
Okay, is it okay if I touch it?

02:04.060 --> 02:05.060
Yeah.

02:05.060 --> 02:06.060
Okay, cool.

02:06.060 --> 02:07.060
What?

02:07.060 --> 02:08.060
And what are your pronouns?

02:08.060 --> 02:09.060
They, that one.

02:09.060 --> 02:10.060
She, they.

02:10.060 --> 02:11.060
I'm glad we exchanged those.

02:11.060 --> 02:12.060
Yes.

02:12.060 --> 02:13.060
Okay.

02:13.060 --> 02:14.060
This is, it's just hairdressing, dude.

02:14.060 --> 02:16.060
Okay, the whole point of a pronoun, this is fucking cringe, guys.

02:16.060 --> 02:19.340
The whole point of a pronoun is that you use it to talk about somebody else.

02:19.340 --> 02:23.620
So if I'm talking to you and there's a third person that we're referring to and they're

02:23.620 --> 02:27.280
a he, him, we're going to refer to them by saying he, him.

02:27.280 --> 02:29.980
You don't use a person's pronouns while talking to them directly.

02:29.980 --> 02:34.460
So considering that this is an exchange between, you know, a hairstylist and a customer, they're

02:34.460 --> 02:37.200
only ever going to be talking to each other.

02:37.200 --> 02:39.140
What is this other than weird virtue signaling?

02:39.140 --> 02:40.140
I don't know.

02:40.140 --> 02:42.860
I think if I was asked that I would probably just like get up and leave.

02:42.860 --> 02:46.300
It's like, ah, nah, nah, nah, I'm out of here, man.

02:46.300 --> 02:48.300
I'm going to go find some normal people.

02:48.300 --> 02:49.300
Okay.

02:49.300 --> 02:50.300
Okay.

02:50.300 --> 02:57.940
Looks like a trap, a trap with like rubber bands.

02:57.940 --> 02:58.940
What is that?

02:58.940 --> 03:01.620
Like, uh, is that bird feed?

03:01.620 --> 03:05.100
Is he chopping birds?

03:05.100 --> 03:06.100
It is.

03:06.100 --> 03:07.100
It's bird feed.

03:07.100 --> 03:08.100
Yep.

03:08.100 --> 03:09.100
All right.

03:09.100 --> 03:10.100
Shout down, guys.

03:10.100 --> 03:11.100
Let's see.

03:11.100 --> 03:12.100
Oh.

03:12.100 --> 03:13.100
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

03:13.100 --> 03:14.100
In you go.

03:14.100 --> 03:21.340
And they just keep hanging out.

03:21.340 --> 03:22.340
Okay.

03:22.340 --> 03:28.540
They seem like totally nonplussed that this, this weird thing is like somehow their friends

03:28.540 --> 03:29.820
just disappearing.

03:29.820 --> 03:30.820
No big deal.

03:30.820 --> 03:31.820
Right?

03:31.820 --> 03:32.820
Yep.

03:32.820 --> 03:33.820
Just, just keep going, dude.

03:33.820 --> 03:34.820
It's fine.

03:34.820 --> 03:35.820
There's no problem here.

03:35.820 --> 03:36.820
Right?

03:36.820 --> 03:37.820
It's okay.

03:37.820 --> 03:39.820
Come on, fall in.

03:39.820 --> 03:40.820
Yep.

03:40.820 --> 03:41.820
There you go.

03:41.820 --> 03:42.820
Like, okay.

03:42.820 --> 03:45.580
These are some dumb fucking birds guys.

03:45.580 --> 03:50.460
You think that after the first one fell, you'd like fly away or something, but just no survival

03:50.460 --> 03:52.100
instinct on these things.

03:52.100 --> 03:53.100
What?

03:53.100 --> 03:55.100
You pay me?

03:55.100 --> 03:56.100
What?

03:56.100 --> 03:57.100
You pay me?

03:57.100 --> 03:58.100
Why?

03:58.100 --> 03:59.100
What?

03:59.100 --> 04:03.660
Oh, I see what you mean.

04:03.660 --> 04:05.980
Only in Thailand, bros.

04:05.980 --> 04:07.740
Only in Thailand.

04:07.740 --> 04:09.260
How many of you would do it?

04:09.260 --> 04:10.820
How many of you would take the 5,000?

04:10.820 --> 04:13.340
I wouldn't personally, but how many of you would?

04:13.340 --> 04:16.420
So everyone pushes college, college, college.

04:16.420 --> 04:17.420
And I went to college.

04:17.420 --> 04:18.420
I have a master's degree.

04:18.420 --> 04:20.340
I make very good money for my age.

04:20.340 --> 04:21.340
Okay.

04:21.340 --> 04:24.060
My husband did not go to college and I've talked about this on here before.

04:24.060 --> 04:25.060
Trade school it looks like.

04:25.060 --> 04:26.060
And I don't think you understand.

04:26.060 --> 04:27.060
Okay.

04:27.060 --> 04:28.060
I don't think you understand it.

04:28.060 --> 04:31.100
So I'm going to throw it into perspective for you and I say it not to brag, but to

04:31.100 --> 04:33.780
hopefully help, help any of you.

04:33.780 --> 04:34.780
Okay.

04:34.780 --> 04:37.140
I have a college degree.

04:37.140 --> 04:38.580
He has a high school diploma.

04:38.580 --> 04:40.700
He went to trade school right after high school.

04:40.700 --> 04:43.940
He got his certificates and everything.

04:43.940 --> 04:44.940
And here we go.

04:44.940 --> 04:51.060
So this past July, he had already brought home, brought home more than my gross salary

04:51.060 --> 04:52.060
this year.

04:52.060 --> 04:53.060
Okay.

04:53.060 --> 04:55.900
In December, he will have quadrupled my salary.

04:55.900 --> 04:56.900
Wow.

04:56.900 --> 04:57.900
Quadrupled it.

04:57.900 --> 04:58.900
He's making it, dude.

04:58.900 --> 05:03.740
If he decides to pick up overtime on a weekend, a two day weekend, if he picks up overtime,

05:03.740 --> 05:10.220
he brings home that weekend, just in those two days, more than I make in a two week check.

05:11.020 --> 05:12.740
I have a master's degree.

05:12.740 --> 05:13.740
Yes.

05:13.740 --> 05:15.380
He has a high school diploma.

05:15.380 --> 05:16.380
And those certificates, by the way.

05:16.380 --> 05:20.300
So that reason right there is why I will not push college on anyone.

05:20.300 --> 05:24.280
If you think that college is not for you and you want to try a trade school, obviously

05:24.280 --> 05:25.280
look into it.

05:25.280 --> 05:32.100
See if you think that you have what it takes and then 100% do it, do it.

05:32.100 --> 05:33.280
And she's completely right.

05:33.280 --> 05:36.460
Everyone's looking down on blue collar jobs right now, especially lefties.

05:36.820 --> 05:40.540
And you think that they would be like supportive of it because, you know, they're the proletariat,

05:40.540 --> 05:43.640
but no, everyone's looking down on blue collar jobs and it's like, no, man.

05:43.640 --> 05:48.260
If you're just looking to sustain yourself and make money, the money's in the trades

05:48.260 --> 05:49.480
right now, guys.

05:49.480 --> 05:53.940
We need like plumbers and electricians and construction workers.

05:53.940 --> 05:55.700
We need people like that.

05:55.700 --> 05:56.700
Like crazy.

05:56.700 --> 05:57.700
No one's doing those jobs right now.

05:57.700 --> 05:58.700
So you know what?

05:58.700 --> 05:59.700
Demand is up.

05:59.700 --> 06:00.700
Supply is down.

06:00.700 --> 06:01.980
You can make a lot of money in those trades.

06:01.980 --> 06:04.060
I thought this person was going to be complaining about it.

06:04.060 --> 06:07.060
They kind of took on that dimension a little bit at the start where she was like, I can't

06:07.060 --> 06:09.500
believe he makes more than you and I have a master's degree.

06:09.500 --> 06:11.020
It's like, well, but then she understood later.

06:11.020 --> 06:12.680
She's like, Oh no, she actually got it.

06:12.680 --> 06:13.680
And Hey, you know what?

06:13.680 --> 06:15.060
Like they're a family unit.

06:15.060 --> 06:16.660
So they're both enjoying this lifestyle.

06:16.660 --> 06:17.660
So like she's in a good position.

06:19.660 --> 06:20.660
Oh, what?

06:20.660 --> 06:24.900
Oh, that's a, that's too much topping in the pizza.

06:24.900 --> 06:30.220
Even for me, Jesus, I can feel my, my, I I'm like having a heart attack just looking at

06:30.220 --> 06:31.220
that.

06:31.220 --> 06:33.220
Oh my God.

06:33.380 --> 06:34.380
Hotel clean.

06:34.380 --> 06:35.380
Okay.

06:35.380 --> 06:36.380
What's going on here?

06:36.380 --> 06:41.380
This is her in her hotel room, I guess.

06:41.380 --> 06:42.380
Yeah.

06:42.380 --> 06:47.660
Oh, she cleans her hotel room as soon as she checks in.

06:47.660 --> 06:55.020
I mean, they do have cleaning staff to do this, but sometimes the cleaning staff's pretty

06:55.020 --> 06:59.980
bad, but uh, Oh, disposable sheets.

06:59.980 --> 07:00.980
Okay.

07:00.980 --> 07:01.980
New sheets.

07:01.980 --> 07:02.980
New sheets, guys.

07:02.980 --> 07:05.500
Listen, I get the hotel room is going to be gross sometimes.

07:05.500 --> 07:06.500
This is a bit much.

07:06.500 --> 07:09.500
Don't you think?

07:09.500 --> 07:13.620
I don't know though.

07:13.620 --> 07:14.620
I don't know.

07:14.620 --> 07:15.620
Oh, clean.

07:15.620 --> 07:16.620
Clean the whole place.

07:16.620 --> 07:17.620
Yeah.

07:17.620 --> 07:18.620
Just clean it up.

07:18.620 --> 07:19.620
You just, you just bring all this shit with you.

07:19.620 --> 07:23.260
Do you, this is some like post COVID hypochondriac shit.

07:23.260 --> 07:25.660
I think this is a bit much.

07:25.660 --> 07:26.660
Okay.

07:26.660 --> 07:27.660
Sure.

07:27.660 --> 07:36.660
You know what?

07:36.660 --> 07:38.660
This is the cleaning ASMR.

07:38.660 --> 07:39.660
Yeah.

07:39.660 --> 07:40.660
Okay.

07:40.660 --> 07:41.660
Lady.

07:41.660 --> 07:46.340
Listen, if you want to spend all this time cleaning up your hotel room, every time you

07:46.340 --> 07:48.620
come into it, you, you do you all right.

07:48.620 --> 07:55.060
White people ruined most of everything colonize the globe thousands of indigenous peoples

07:55.060 --> 08:00.420
acknowledge and celebrate multiple identities as part of their culture.

08:00.420 --> 08:05.100
This isn't exactly true guys, European spread religion to get others to convert.

08:05.100 --> 08:11.500
You guys had your own religions, dude, but the idea of the gender man and woman was also

08:11.500 --> 08:12.500
a European ideology.

08:12.500 --> 08:19.380
That was one of the tools of the colonization and then men and women became the standardized

08:19.380 --> 08:21.980
gender identity as what we now know today.

08:21.980 --> 08:26.520
Are you saying that the other, you know, the other various tribes of the world for

08:26.520 --> 08:32.300
some reason couldn't tell the difference between the male and female sex, but no among lefties,

08:32.300 --> 08:37.240
there's this like idealized, you know, third gender, wherever the fuck that like indigenous

08:37.240 --> 08:39.960
cultures around the world practiced or this nonsense.

08:39.960 --> 08:40.960
You know what?

08:40.960 --> 08:45.140
When you actually look into that 99% of the time, what's usually being described there

08:45.140 --> 08:49.820
are basically like pussy men, like men who were too wimpy and effeminate and couldn't

08:49.820 --> 08:50.940
hack it as real men.

08:50.940 --> 08:55.460
So like there was a place for them in the society as not quite a man and not quite a

08:55.460 --> 09:00.620
woman, but it wasn't like this, you know, ancient progressive tribal utopia or something.

09:00.620 --> 09:06.060
Let's end it off with a return from our, our friend Horace, the Hawk person.

09:06.060 --> 09:09.900
If you remember, she's been on a, sorry, it's Daisy Bone Brittle.

09:09.900 --> 09:14.860
Those are the, those are the pronouns also apparently this person is not called Horace

09:14.860 --> 09:15.860
anymore.

09:16.520 --> 09:21.080
But point is, I've had this person on TikTok Tuesday several times now talking about the

09:21.080 --> 09:23.540
struggles of being trans bird.

09:23.540 --> 09:26.300
They are in fact, they're actually a bird deep down.

09:26.300 --> 09:28.900
So let's get caught up to date and what's going on in this person's life.

09:28.900 --> 09:35.580
Hi, my name is Asa, I'm a member of the DID system and also a bearded vulture therian.

09:35.580 --> 09:36.580
I have two questions.

09:36.580 --> 09:37.580
Good luck, dude.

09:37.580 --> 09:43.300
One is for other therians, specifically bird therians, and the other question is for other

09:43.300 --> 09:46.420
systems who have therian system members.

09:46.420 --> 09:49.740
So first question for other bird therians, what are some things you do that help you

09:49.740 --> 09:51.740
feel more connected to your theriotype?

09:51.740 --> 09:52.740
Theriotype?

09:52.740 --> 09:53.740
Okay, dude.

09:53.740 --> 09:54.740
All right.

09:54.740 --> 09:58.740
They can do quadrobics and that helps them a lot.

09:58.740 --> 10:01.700
But obviously that's not applicable to bird therians.

10:01.700 --> 10:02.940
You could jump off something.

10:02.940 --> 10:03.940
Okay, I'm sorry.

10:03.940 --> 10:04.940
That'd be too edgy.

10:04.940 --> 10:08.940
People can do quadrobics and not be a therian.

10:08.940 --> 10:09.940
So that's my first question.

10:09.940 --> 10:10.940
Okay.

10:10.940 --> 10:19.380
And second question is for systems with therian altars, do these altars appear human in a

10:19.380 --> 10:22.980
world or do they appear as their theriotypes in a world?

10:22.980 --> 10:24.780
Or is it kind of a combo situation?

10:24.780 --> 10:29.780
Like we have someone in our system who is both a guy and a vulture at the same time.

10:29.780 --> 10:32.700
I think you guys watch way too much Sonic the Hedgehog.

10:32.700 --> 10:34.700
I think you need to go to therapy.

10:34.700 --> 10:35.700
That's all it is.

10:35.700 --> 10:39.700
Is that how therian altars work in you guys' systems?

10:39.700 --> 10:44.580
Well, you know what?

10:44.580 --> 10:45.580
That didn't disappoint.

10:45.580 --> 10:51.940
The insane schizo ramblings of this person did not disappoint and I'm happy we checked

10:51.940 --> 10:53.340
back in with them.

10:53.340 --> 10:57.560
Maybe we'll keep, maybe you guys will keep sending me more TikToks of this fucking loony.

10:57.560 --> 11:01.540
It's always good to get a quick refresher on how to be a bird person.

11:01.540 --> 11:06.420
Do you think they play something like Zelda Breath of the Wild or whatever and get in

11:06.420 --> 11:07.420
touch with the Rito?

11:07.420 --> 11:08.420
You think that's going on here?

11:08.420 --> 11:10.980
Anyway, that does it for me today, my friends.

11:10.980 --> 11:12.740
Hope you enjoyed the TikToks today.

11:12.740 --> 11:14.660
Some of them were a little bit older, but we're working through.

11:14.660 --> 11:16.140
We're working through to some of the new ones, finally.

11:16.140 --> 11:18.000
I have a big backlog saved up.

11:18.000 --> 11:21.620
As always, stream after the video, so drop by and say hi.

11:21.620 --> 11:22.620
Have a good one.

11:22.620 --> 11:24.020
Oh, and new video tomorrow.

11:24.020 --> 11:27.020
Dave's editing it right while I record this, so if it doesn't come out, blame him.
