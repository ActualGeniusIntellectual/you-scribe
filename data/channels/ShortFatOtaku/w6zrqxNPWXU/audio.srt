00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,480
Hello and welcome to TikTok Tuesday, my friends.

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:08,720
The new Discord is up, donors only, sorry guys, and you guys have been dropping some

3
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:09,720
TikToks in there.

4
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:10,720
I'll make sure to get to them too.

5
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:14,080
I have my own backlog of TikToks saved as well, but don't worry, yours is also on the

6
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:15,080
list.

7
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:16,080
Thanks very much for giving them to me.

8
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:18,080
Let's see what nonsense you guys have collected for this week.

9
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:26,800
This is a PSA for anybody that likes to pay for the group tab and act like a baller.

10
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:27,800
Ballin'!

11
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:28,800
Oh, God.

12
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:29,800
Okay, let's see it.

13
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:30,800
Let's see it.

14
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:31,800
Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.

15
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:32,800
Ooh.

16
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:33,800
Bitch.

17
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:34,800
Yeah?

18
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:54,480
That smile at the end is when you know that, like, okay, dude, this is at least partially

19
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:55,480
an act, right?

20
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:56,480
It's gotta be.

21
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:59,440
That's 10%, right?

22
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:00,440
Canada's a bit different than America.

23
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:03,320
I don't know how, I don't know what Americans do.

24
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:06,080
Tipping is just, in general, obnoxious.

25
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:09,240
And people who think that they just blanket deserve tips?

26
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:10,240
No way, dude.

27
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:11,800
And servers who complain about them?

28
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:13,300
You're lucky you got the five.

29
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:14,460
There's no obligation here.

30
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:15,460
Fuck you.

31
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:16,460
I hate tipping culture, dude.

32
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:17,460
I fuckin' hate it.

33
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:19,960
Whoa, whoa, hold on, hold on.

34
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:20,960
Music.

35
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:21,960
Music.

36
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:22,960
Okay.

37
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:23,960
What am I looking at?

38
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:25,960
What?

39
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:26,960
Is this?

40
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:27,960
Oh, it's Madonna.

41
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:28,960
It says Madonna Live.

42
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:29,960
That's a TikTok account.

43
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:30,960
Hold on, we gotta play that again.

44
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:35,720
Yeah, dude, it's Madonna in the futuristic space suit holding onto a bar so she doesn't

45
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:37,440
fall over because she's like fucking 80.

46
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:41,920
Okay, we've all seen those pictures, right, of like how Madonna looks like an alien after

47
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:42,920
the plastic surgery.

48
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:45,360
Well, looking like this, she ain't beating the alien allegations.

49
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,560
Listen, no one wants to get old, right?

50
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:48,560
I understand it.

51
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:51,700
You can't be the young new thing forever.

52
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:53,220
One day you will get old.

53
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:55,800
One day all of your physical beauty will disappear.

54
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,060
One day you will die.

55
00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:00,740
And frankly, efforts to prevent this tend to just make you look more inhuman, especially

56
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:02,060
if it's like plastic surgery and stuff.

57
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:04,060
Okay, is it okay if I touch it?

58
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:05,060
Yeah.

59
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:06,060
Okay, cool.

60
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:07,060
What?

61
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:08,060
And what are your pronouns?

62
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:09,060
They, that one.

63
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:10,060
She, they.

64
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:11,060
I'm glad we exchanged those.

65
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:12,060
Yes.

66
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:13,060
Okay.

67
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:14,060
This is, it's just hairdressing, dude.

68
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:16,060
Okay, the whole point of a pronoun, this is fucking cringe, guys.

69
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:19,340
The whole point of a pronoun is that you use it to talk about somebody else.

70
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:23,620
So if I'm talking to you and there's a third person that we're referring to and they're

71
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:27,280
a he, him, we're going to refer to them by saying he, him.

72
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,980
You don't use a person's pronouns while talking to them directly.

73
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:34,460
So considering that this is an exchange between, you know, a hairstylist and a customer, they're

74
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:37,200
only ever going to be talking to each other.

75
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,140
What is this other than weird virtue signaling?

76
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:40,140
I don't know.

77
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:42,860
I think if I was asked that I would probably just like get up and leave.

78
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:46,300
It's like, ah, nah, nah, nah, I'm out of here, man.

79
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:48,300
I'm going to go find some normal people.

80
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:49,300
Okay.

81
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:50,300
Okay.

82
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:57,940
Looks like a trap, a trap with like rubber bands.

83
00:02:57,940 --> 00:02:58,940
What is that?

84
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:01,620
Like, uh, is that bird feed?

85
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:05,100
Is he chopping birds?

86
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:06,100
It is.

87
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:07,100
It's bird feed.

88
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:08,100
Yep.

89
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:09,100
All right.

90
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:10,100
Shout down, guys.

91
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:11,100
Let's see.

92
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:12,100
Oh.

93
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:13,100
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

94
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:14,100
In you go.

95
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:21,340
And they just keep hanging out.

96
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:22,340
Okay.

97
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:28,540
They seem like totally nonplussed that this, this weird thing is like somehow their friends

98
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:29,820
just disappearing.

99
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:30,820
No big deal.

100
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:31,820
Right?

101
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:32,820
Yep.

102
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:33,820
Just, just keep going, dude.

103
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:34,820
It's fine.

104
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:35,820
There's no problem here.

105
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:36,820
Right?

106
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:37,820
It's okay.

107
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:39,820
Come on, fall in.

108
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:40,820
Yep.

109
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:41,820
There you go.

110
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:42,820
Like, okay.

111
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:45,580
These are some dumb fucking birds guys.

112
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:50,460
You think that after the first one fell, you'd like fly away or something, but just no survival

113
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:52,100
instinct on these things.

114
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:53,100
What?

115
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:55,100
You pay me?

116
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:56,100
What?

117
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:57,100
You pay me?

118
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:58,100
Why?

119
00:03:58,100 --> 00:03:59,100
What?

120
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:03,660
Oh, I see what you mean.

121
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:05,980
Only in Thailand, bros.

122
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:07,740
Only in Thailand.

123
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:09,260
How many of you would do it?

124
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:10,820
How many of you would take the 5,000?

125
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:13,340
I wouldn't personally, but how many of you would?

126
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:16,420
So everyone pushes college, college, college.

127
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:17,420
And I went to college.

128
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:18,420
I have a master's degree.

129
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:20,340
I make very good money for my age.

130
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:21,340
Okay.

131
00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:24,060
My husband did not go to college and I've talked about this on here before.

132
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:25,060
Trade school it looks like.

133
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:26,060
And I don't think you understand.

134
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:27,060
Okay.

135
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:28,060
I don't think you understand it.

136
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:31,100
So I'm going to throw it into perspective for you and I say it not to brag, but to

137
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:33,780
hopefully help, help any of you.

138
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:34,780
Okay.

139
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:37,140
I have a college degree.

140
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:38,580
He has a high school diploma.

141
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:40,700
He went to trade school right after high school.

142
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:43,940
He got his certificates and everything.

143
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:44,940
And here we go.

144
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:51,060
So this past July, he had already brought home, brought home more than my gross salary

145
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:52,060
this year.

146
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:53,060
Okay.

147
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:55,900
In December, he will have quadrupled my salary.

148
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:56,900
Wow.

149
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:57,900
Quadrupled it.

150
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:58,900
He's making it, dude.

151
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:03,740
If he decides to pick up overtime on a weekend, a two day weekend, if he picks up overtime,

152
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:10,220
he brings home that weekend, just in those two days, more than I make in a two week check.

153
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:12,740
I have a master's degree.

154
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:13,740
Yes.

155
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:15,380
He has a high school diploma.

156
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:16,380
And those certificates, by the way.

157
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:20,300
So that reason right there is why I will not push college on anyone.

158
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:24,280
If you think that college is not for you and you want to try a trade school, obviously

159
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:25,280
look into it.

160
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:32,100
See if you think that you have what it takes and then 100% do it, do it.

161
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:33,280
And she's completely right.

162
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:36,460
Everyone's looking down on blue collar jobs right now, especially lefties.

163
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:40,540
And you think that they would be like supportive of it because, you know, they're the proletariat,

164
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:43,640
but no, everyone's looking down on blue collar jobs and it's like, no, man.

165
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:48,260
If you're just looking to sustain yourself and make money, the money's in the trades

166
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:49,480
right now, guys.

167
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:53,940
We need like plumbers and electricians and construction workers.

168
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:55,700
We need people like that.

169
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:56,700
Like crazy.

170
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:57,700
No one's doing those jobs right now.

171
00:05:57,700 --> 00:05:58,700
So you know what?

172
00:05:58,700 --> 00:05:59,700
Demand is up.

173
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:00,700
Supply is down.

174
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:01,980
You can make a lot of money in those trades.

175
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:04,060
I thought this person was going to be complaining about it.

176
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:07,060
They kind of took on that dimension a little bit at the start where she was like, I can't

177
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:09,500
believe he makes more than you and I have a master's degree.

178
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:11,020
It's like, well, but then she understood later.

179
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:12,680
She's like, Oh no, she actually got it.

180
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:13,680
And Hey, you know what?

181
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,060
Like they're a family unit.

182
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:16,660
So they're both enjoying this lifestyle.

183
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:17,660
So like she's in a good position.

184
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:20,660
Oh, what?

185
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:24,900
Oh, that's a, that's too much topping in the pizza.

186
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:30,220
Even for me, Jesus, I can feel my, my, I I'm like having a heart attack just looking at

187
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:31,220
that.

188
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:33,220
Oh my God.

189
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:34,380
Hotel clean.

190
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:35,380
Okay.

191
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:36,380
What's going on here?

192
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:41,380
This is her in her hotel room, I guess.

193
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:42,380
Yeah.

194
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:47,660
Oh, she cleans her hotel room as soon as she checks in.

195
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:55,020
I mean, they do have cleaning staff to do this, but sometimes the cleaning staff's pretty

196
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:59,980
bad, but uh, Oh, disposable sheets.

197
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:00,980
Okay.

198
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:01,980
New sheets.

199
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:02,980
New sheets, guys.

200
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:05,500
Listen, I get the hotel room is going to be gross sometimes.

201
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:06,500
This is a bit much.

202
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:09,500
Don't you think?

203
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:13,620
I don't know though.

204
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:14,620
I don't know.

205
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:15,620
Oh, clean.

206
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:16,620
Clean the whole place.

207
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:17,620
Yeah.

208
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:18,620
Just clean it up.

209
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:19,620
You just, you just bring all this shit with you.

210
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:23,260
Do you, this is some like post COVID hypochondriac shit.

211
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:25,660
I think this is a bit much.

212
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:26,660
Okay.

213
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:27,660
Sure.

214
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:36,660
You know what?

215
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:38,660
This is the cleaning ASMR.

216
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:39,660
Yeah.

217
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:40,660
Okay.

218
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:41,660
Lady.

219
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:46,340
Listen, if you want to spend all this time cleaning up your hotel room, every time you

220
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:48,620
come into it, you, you do you all right.

221
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:55,060
White people ruined most of everything colonize the globe thousands of indigenous peoples

222
00:07:55,060 --> 00:08:00,420
acknowledge and celebrate multiple identities as part of their culture.

223
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:05,100
This isn't exactly true guys, European spread religion to get others to convert.

224
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:11,500
You guys had your own religions, dude, but the idea of the gender man and woman was also

225
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:12,500
a European ideology.

226
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:19,380
That was one of the tools of the colonization and then men and women became the standardized

227
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:21,980
gender identity as what we now know today.

228
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:26,520
Are you saying that the other, you know, the other various tribes of the world for

229
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:32,300
some reason couldn't tell the difference between the male and female sex, but no among lefties,

230
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:37,240
there's this like idealized, you know, third gender, wherever the fuck that like indigenous

231
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:39,960
cultures around the world practiced or this nonsense.

232
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:40,960
You know what?

233
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:45,140
When you actually look into that 99% of the time, what's usually being described there

234
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:49,820
are basically like pussy men, like men who were too wimpy and effeminate and couldn't

235
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:50,940
hack it as real men.

236
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:55,460
So like there was a place for them in the society as not quite a man and not quite a

237
00:08:55,460 --> 00:09:00,620
woman, but it wasn't like this, you know, ancient progressive tribal utopia or something.

238
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:06,060
Let's end it off with a return from our, our friend Horace, the Hawk person.

239
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:09,900
If you remember, she's been on a, sorry, it's Daisy Bone Brittle.

240
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:14,860
Those are the, those are the pronouns also apparently this person is not called Horace

241
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:15,860
anymore.

242
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:21,080
But point is, I've had this person on TikTok Tuesday several times now talking about the

243
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:23,540
struggles of being trans bird.

244
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:26,300
They are in fact, they're actually a bird deep down.

245
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:28,900
So let's get caught up to date and what's going on in this person's life.

246
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:35,580
Hi, my name is Asa, I'm a member of the DID system and also a bearded vulture therian.

247
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:36,580
I have two questions.

248
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:37,580
Good luck, dude.

249
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:43,300
One is for other therians, specifically bird therians, and the other question is for other

250
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:46,420
systems who have therian system members.

251
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:49,740
So first question for other bird therians, what are some things you do that help you

252
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:51,740
feel more connected to your theriotype?

253
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:52,740
Theriotype?

254
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:53,740
Okay, dude.

255
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:54,740
All right.

256
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:58,740
They can do quadrobics and that helps them a lot.

257
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:01,700
But obviously that's not applicable to bird therians.

258
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:02,940
You could jump off something.

259
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:03,940
Okay, I'm sorry.

260
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:04,940
That'd be too edgy.

261
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:08,940
People can do quadrobics and not be a therian.

262
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:09,940
So that's my first question.

263
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:10,940
Okay.

264
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:19,380
And second question is for systems with therian altars, do these altars appear human in a

265
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:22,980
world or do they appear as their theriotypes in a world?

266
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:24,780
Or is it kind of a combo situation?

267
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:29,780
Like we have someone in our system who is both a guy and a vulture at the same time.

268
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:32,700
I think you guys watch way too much Sonic the Hedgehog.

269
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:34,700
I think you need to go to therapy.

270
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:35,700
That's all it is.

271
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:39,700
Is that how therian altars work in you guys' systems?

272
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:44,580
Well, you know what?

273
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:45,580
That didn't disappoint.

274
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:51,940
The insane schizo ramblings of this person did not disappoint and I'm happy we checked

275
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:53,340
back in with them.

276
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:57,560
Maybe we'll keep, maybe you guys will keep sending me more TikToks of this fucking loony.

277
00:10:57,560 --> 00:11:01,540
It's always good to get a quick refresher on how to be a bird person.

278
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:06,420
Do you think they play something like Zelda Breath of the Wild or whatever and get in

279
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:07,420
touch with the Rito?

280
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:08,420
You think that's going on here?

281
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:10,980
Anyway, that does it for me today, my friends.

282
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:12,740
Hope you enjoyed the TikToks today.

283
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:14,660
Some of them were a little bit older, but we're working through.

284
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:16,140
We're working through to some of the new ones, finally.

285
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:18,000
I have a big backlog saved up.

286
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,620
As always, stream after the video, so drop by and say hi.

287
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:22,620
Have a good one.

288
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:24,020
Oh, and new video tomorrow.

289
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:27,020
Dave's editing it right while I record this, so if it doesn't come out, blame him.
