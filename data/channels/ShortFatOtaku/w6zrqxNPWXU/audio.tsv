0	4480	Hello and welcome to TikTok Tuesday, my friends.
4480	8720	The new Discord is up, donors only, sorry guys, and you guys have been dropping some
8720	9720	TikToks in there.
9720	10720	I'll make sure to get to them too.
10720	14080	I have my own backlog of TikToks saved as well, but don't worry, yours is also on the
14080	15080	list.
15080	16080	Thanks very much for giving them to me.
16080	18080	Let's see what nonsense you guys have collected for this week.
18080	26800	This is a PSA for anybody that likes to pay for the group tab and act like a baller.
26800	27800	Ballin'!
27800	28800	Oh, God.
28800	29800	Okay, let's see it.
29800	30800	Let's see it.
30800	31800	Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.
31800	32800	Ooh.
32800	33800	Bitch.
33800	34800	Yeah?
34800	54480	That smile at the end is when you know that, like, okay, dude, this is at least partially
54480	55480	an act, right?
55480	56480	It's gotta be.
57440	59440	That's 10%, right?
59440	60440	Canada's a bit different than America.
60440	63320	I don't know how, I don't know what Americans do.
63320	66080	Tipping is just, in general, obnoxious.
66080	69240	And people who think that they just blanket deserve tips?
69240	70240	No way, dude.
70240	71800	And servers who complain about them?
71800	73300	You're lucky you got the five.
73300	74460	There's no obligation here.
74460	75460	Fuck you.
75460	76460	I hate tipping culture, dude.
76460	77460	I fuckin' hate it.
77460	79960	Whoa, whoa, hold on, hold on.
79960	80960	Music.
80960	81960	Music.
81960	82960	Okay.
82960	83960	What am I looking at?
84960	85960	What?
85960	86960	Is this?
86960	87960	Oh, it's Madonna.
87960	88960	It says Madonna Live.
88960	89960	That's a TikTok account.
89960	90960	Hold on, we gotta play that again.
90960	95720	Yeah, dude, it's Madonna in the futuristic space suit holding onto a bar so she doesn't
95720	97440	fall over because she's like fucking 80.
97440	101920	Okay, we've all seen those pictures, right, of like how Madonna looks like an alien after
101920	102920	the plastic surgery.
102920	105360	Well, looking like this, she ain't beating the alien allegations.
105360	107560	Listen, no one wants to get old, right?
107560	108560	I understand it.
108560	111700	You can't be the young new thing forever.
111700	113220	One day you will get old.
113220	115800	One day all of your physical beauty will disappear.
115800	117060	One day you will die.
117060	120740	And frankly, efforts to prevent this tend to just make you look more inhuman, especially
120740	122060	if it's like plastic surgery and stuff.
122060	124060	Okay, is it okay if I touch it?
124060	125060	Yeah.
125060	126060	Okay, cool.
126060	127060	What?
127060	128060	And what are your pronouns?
128060	129060	They, that one.
129060	130060	She, they.
130060	131060	I'm glad we exchanged those.
131060	132060	Yes.
132060	133060	Okay.
133060	134060	This is, it's just hairdressing, dude.
134060	136060	Okay, the whole point of a pronoun, this is fucking cringe, guys.
136060	139340	The whole point of a pronoun is that you use it to talk about somebody else.
139340	143620	So if I'm talking to you and there's a third person that we're referring to and they're
143620	147280	a he, him, we're going to refer to them by saying he, him.
147280	149980	You don't use a person's pronouns while talking to them directly.
149980	154460	So considering that this is an exchange between, you know, a hairstylist and a customer, they're
154460	157200	only ever going to be talking to each other.
157200	159140	What is this other than weird virtue signaling?
159140	160140	I don't know.
160140	162860	I think if I was asked that I would probably just like get up and leave.
162860	166300	It's like, ah, nah, nah, nah, I'm out of here, man.
166300	168300	I'm going to go find some normal people.
168300	169300	Okay.
169300	170300	Okay.
170300	177940	Looks like a trap, a trap with like rubber bands.
177940	178940	What is that?
178940	181620	Like, uh, is that bird feed?
181620	185100	Is he chopping birds?
185100	186100	It is.
186100	187100	It's bird feed.
187100	188100	Yep.
188100	189100	All right.
189100	190100	Shout down, guys.
190100	191100	Let's see.
191100	192100	Oh.
192100	193100	Oh, oh, oh, oh.
193100	194100	In you go.
194100	201340	And they just keep hanging out.
201340	202340	Okay.
202340	208540	They seem like totally nonplussed that this, this weird thing is like somehow their friends
208540	209820	just disappearing.
209820	210820	No big deal.
210820	211820	Right?
211820	212820	Yep.
212820	213820	Just, just keep going, dude.
213820	214820	It's fine.
214820	215820	There's no problem here.
215820	216820	Right?
216820	217820	It's okay.
217820	219820	Come on, fall in.
219820	220820	Yep.
220820	221820	There you go.
221820	222820	Like, okay.
222820	225580	These are some dumb fucking birds guys.
225580	230460	You think that after the first one fell, you'd like fly away or something, but just no survival
230460	232100	instinct on these things.
232100	233100	What?
233100	235100	You pay me?
235100	236100	What?
236100	237100	You pay me?
237100	238100	Why?
238100	239100	What?
239100	243660	Oh, I see what you mean.
243660	245980	Only in Thailand, bros.
245980	247740	Only in Thailand.
247740	249260	How many of you would do it?
249260	250820	How many of you would take the 5,000?
250820	253340	I wouldn't personally, but how many of you would?
253340	256420	So everyone pushes college, college, college.
256420	257420	And I went to college.
257420	258420	I have a master's degree.
258420	260340	I make very good money for my age.
260340	261340	Okay.
261340	264060	My husband did not go to college and I've talked about this on here before.
264060	265060	Trade school it looks like.
265060	266060	And I don't think you understand.
266060	267060	Okay.
267060	268060	I don't think you understand it.
268060	271100	So I'm going to throw it into perspective for you and I say it not to brag, but to
271100	273780	hopefully help, help any of you.
273780	274780	Okay.
274780	277140	I have a college degree.
277140	278580	He has a high school diploma.
278580	280700	He went to trade school right after high school.
280700	283940	He got his certificates and everything.
283940	284940	And here we go.
284940	291060	So this past July, he had already brought home, brought home more than my gross salary
291060	292060	this year.
292060	293060	Okay.
293060	295900	In December, he will have quadrupled my salary.
295900	296900	Wow.
296900	297900	Quadrupled it.
297900	298900	He's making it, dude.
298900	303740	If he decides to pick up overtime on a weekend, a two day weekend, if he picks up overtime,
303740	310220	he brings home that weekend, just in those two days, more than I make in a two week check.
311020	312740	I have a master's degree.
312740	313740	Yes.
313740	315380	He has a high school diploma.
315380	316380	And those certificates, by the way.
316380	320300	So that reason right there is why I will not push college on anyone.
320300	324280	If you think that college is not for you and you want to try a trade school, obviously
324280	325280	look into it.
325280	332100	See if you think that you have what it takes and then 100% do it, do it.
332100	333280	And she's completely right.
333280	336460	Everyone's looking down on blue collar jobs right now, especially lefties.
336820	340540	And you think that they would be like supportive of it because, you know, they're the proletariat,
340540	343640	but no, everyone's looking down on blue collar jobs and it's like, no, man.
343640	348260	If you're just looking to sustain yourself and make money, the money's in the trades
348260	349480	right now, guys.
349480	353940	We need like plumbers and electricians and construction workers.
353940	355700	We need people like that.
355700	356700	Like crazy.
356700	357700	No one's doing those jobs right now.
357700	358700	So you know what?
358700	359700	Demand is up.
359700	360700	Supply is down.
360700	361980	You can make a lot of money in those trades.
361980	364060	I thought this person was going to be complaining about it.
364060	367060	They kind of took on that dimension a little bit at the start where she was like, I can't
367060	369500	believe he makes more than you and I have a master's degree.
369500	371020	It's like, well, but then she understood later.
371020	372680	She's like, Oh no, she actually got it.
372680	373680	And Hey, you know what?
373680	375060	Like they're a family unit.
375060	376660	So they're both enjoying this lifestyle.
376660	377660	So like she's in a good position.
379660	380660	Oh, what?
380660	384900	Oh, that's a, that's too much topping in the pizza.
384900	390220	Even for me, Jesus, I can feel my, my, I I'm like having a heart attack just looking at
390220	391220	that.
391220	393220	Oh my God.
393380	394380	Hotel clean.
394380	395380	Okay.
395380	396380	What's going on here?
396380	401380	This is her in her hotel room, I guess.
401380	402380	Yeah.
402380	407660	Oh, she cleans her hotel room as soon as she checks in.
407660	415020	I mean, they do have cleaning staff to do this, but sometimes the cleaning staff's pretty
415020	419980	bad, but uh, Oh, disposable sheets.
419980	420980	Okay.
420980	421980	New sheets.
421980	422980	New sheets, guys.
422980	425500	Listen, I get the hotel room is going to be gross sometimes.
425500	426500	This is a bit much.
426500	429500	Don't you think?
429500	433620	I don't know though.
433620	434620	I don't know.
434620	435620	Oh, clean.
435620	436620	Clean the whole place.
436620	437620	Yeah.
437620	438620	Just clean it up.
438620	439620	You just, you just bring all this shit with you.
439620	443260	Do you, this is some like post COVID hypochondriac shit.
443260	445660	I think this is a bit much.
445660	446660	Okay.
446660	447660	Sure.
447660	456660	You know what?
456660	458660	This is the cleaning ASMR.
458660	459660	Yeah.
459660	460660	Okay.
460660	461660	Lady.
461660	466340	Listen, if you want to spend all this time cleaning up your hotel room, every time you
466340	468620	come into it, you, you do you all right.
468620	475060	White people ruined most of everything colonize the globe thousands of indigenous peoples
475060	480420	acknowledge and celebrate multiple identities as part of their culture.
480420	485100	This isn't exactly true guys, European spread religion to get others to convert.
485100	491500	You guys had your own religions, dude, but the idea of the gender man and woman was also
491500	492500	a European ideology.
492500	499380	That was one of the tools of the colonization and then men and women became the standardized
499380	501980	gender identity as what we now know today.
501980	506520	Are you saying that the other, you know, the other various tribes of the world for
506520	512300	some reason couldn't tell the difference between the male and female sex, but no among lefties,
512300	517240	there's this like idealized, you know, third gender, wherever the fuck that like indigenous
517240	519960	cultures around the world practiced or this nonsense.
519960	520960	You know what?
520960	525140	When you actually look into that 99% of the time, what's usually being described there
525140	529820	are basically like pussy men, like men who were too wimpy and effeminate and couldn't
529820	530940	hack it as real men.
530940	535460	So like there was a place for them in the society as not quite a man and not quite a
535460	540620	woman, but it wasn't like this, you know, ancient progressive tribal utopia or something.
540620	546060	Let's end it off with a return from our, our friend Horace, the Hawk person.
546060	549900	If you remember, she's been on a, sorry, it's Daisy Bone Brittle.
549900	554860	Those are the, those are the pronouns also apparently this person is not called Horace
554860	555860	anymore.
556520	561080	But point is, I've had this person on TikTok Tuesday several times now talking about the
561080	563540	struggles of being trans bird.
563540	566300	They are in fact, they're actually a bird deep down.
566300	568900	So let's get caught up to date and what's going on in this person's life.
568900	575580	Hi, my name is Asa, I'm a member of the DID system and also a bearded vulture therian.
575580	576580	I have two questions.
576580	577580	Good luck, dude.
577580	583300	One is for other therians, specifically bird therians, and the other question is for other
583300	586420	systems who have therian system members.
586420	589740	So first question for other bird therians, what are some things you do that help you
589740	591740	feel more connected to your theriotype?
591740	592740	Theriotype?
592740	593740	Okay, dude.
593740	594740	All right.
594740	598740	They can do quadrobics and that helps them a lot.
598740	601700	But obviously that's not applicable to bird therians.
601700	602940	You could jump off something.
602940	603940	Okay, I'm sorry.
603940	604940	That'd be too edgy.
604940	608940	People can do quadrobics and not be a therian.
608940	609940	So that's my first question.
609940	610940	Okay.
610940	619380	And second question is for systems with therian altars, do these altars appear human in a
619380	622980	world or do they appear as their theriotypes in a world?
622980	624780	Or is it kind of a combo situation?
624780	629780	Like we have someone in our system who is both a guy and a vulture at the same time.
629780	632700	I think you guys watch way too much Sonic the Hedgehog.
632700	634700	I think you need to go to therapy.
634700	635700	That's all it is.
635700	639700	Is that how therian altars work in you guys' systems?
639700	644580	Well, you know what?
644580	645580	That didn't disappoint.
645580	651940	The insane schizo ramblings of this person did not disappoint and I'm happy we checked
651940	653340	back in with them.
653340	657560	Maybe we'll keep, maybe you guys will keep sending me more TikToks of this fucking loony.
657560	661540	It's always good to get a quick refresher on how to be a bird person.
661540	666420	Do you think they play something like Zelda Breath of the Wild or whatever and get in
666420	667420	touch with the Rito?
667420	668420	You think that's going on here?
668420	670980	Anyway, that does it for me today, my friends.
670980	672740	Hope you enjoyed the TikToks today.
672740	674660	Some of them were a little bit older, but we're working through.
674660	676140	We're working through to some of the new ones, finally.
676140	678000	I have a big backlog saved up.
678000	681620	As always, stream after the video, so drop by and say hi.
681620	682620	Have a good one.
682620	684020	Oh, and new video tomorrow.
684020	687020	Dave's editing it right while I record this, so if it doesn't come out, blame him.
