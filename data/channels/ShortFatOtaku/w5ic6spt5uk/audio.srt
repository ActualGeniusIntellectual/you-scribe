1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,480
Do you know who Palantir is?

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:06,640
I do.

3
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:13,000
Some people have referred to them as Stanford Analytica.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Do you agree?

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,040
Senator, I have not heard that.

6
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:17,040
Okay.

7
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:22,920
Do you think Palantir taught Cambridge Analytica, as press reports are saying, how to do these

8
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:23,920
tactics?

9
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:28,120
Senator, I don't know.

10
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:32,240
Do you think that Palantir has ever scraped data from Facebook?

11
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:36,240
Senator, I'm not aware of that.

12
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:37,240
Okay.

13
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:42,040
Mr. Zuckerberg, would you be comfortable sharing with us the name of the hotel you stayed in

14
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:45,040
last night?

15
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:52,320
Um, uh, no.

16
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:56,800
If you've messaged anybody this week, would you share with us the names of the people

17
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:57,800
you've messaged?

18
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:02,040
Senator, no, I would probably not choose to do that publicly here.

19
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:05,120
I think that may be what this is all about.

20
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:11,200
Here's what everybody's been trying to tell you today, and I say this gently.

21
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:16,200
Your user agreement sucks.

22
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:26,680
I'm going to suggest to you that you go back home and rewrite it.

23
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:30,680
Let's talk about that Facebook cryptocurrency that I brought up last video.

24
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:31,680
Libra.

25
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:35,480
Facebook launches cryptocurrency in bid to shake up global finance.

26
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:40,000
Digital currency will let billions of users make transactions, but is already facing opposition

27
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,800
from US lawmakers amid privacy concerns.

28
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:47,960
You know, for The Guardian, this related article here is pretty red pilled.

29
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:50,680
Facebook's Libra launch will extend its global domination.

30
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:56,600
I mean, I agree, but I guess it's lefty authoritative sources that are allowed to talk about

31
00:01:56,600 --> 00:02:00,560
conspiracy theories nowadays and not regular plebs like us.

32
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:04,360
Facebook has announced a digital currency called Libra that will allow its billions

33
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:08,580
of users to make financial transactions across the globe in a move that could potentially

34
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:10,480
shake up the world's banking system.

35
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:14,240
Libra is being touted as a means to connect people who do not have access to traditional

36
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,240
banking platforms.

37
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:19,440
Yeah, this sounds like another variant of the whole financial inclusion thing I mentioned

38
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:24,360
in my Mastercard video last year, where these companies have the long-term goal of everybody's

39
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:28,360
financial transactions happening online so that they can more effectively control them.

40
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:33,480
I mean, really, when a credit card CEO tells you that cash is discriminatory, it doesn't

41
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:36,240
take a genius to realize they've got something up their sleeve.

42
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:41,600
With close to 2.4 billion people using Facebook each month, Libra could be a financial game

43
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:46,040
changer, but will face close scrutiny as Facebook continues to reel from a series of privacy

44
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,040
scandals.

45
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,560
And yeah, this is why I won't be using it.

46
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:52,920
I trust the randoms on eBay to not send me a bomb more than I trust Facebook with managing

47
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:53,920
my money.

48
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:57,200
I withdraw from PayPal almost daily nowadays because I don't trust them either.

49
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:00,800
US lawmakers were quick to raise privacy concerns about the new currency.

50
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:04,540
Shortly after Facebook's announcement, the Congresswoman and chair of the House Financial

51
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:08,440
Services Committee, Maxine Waters, called on the company to put a stop to the project

52
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:10,880
until Congress and regulators could review it.

53
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:14,460
She also called on company executives to testify before the committee.

54
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:18,200
Facebook has data on billions of people, and has repeatedly shown a disregard for the protection

55
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:19,900
and careful use of this data.

56
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:23,700
With the announcement that it plans to create a cryptocurrency, Facebook is continuing its

57
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:27,540
unchecked expansion and extending its reach into the lives of its users.

58
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:29,020
I've got to raise this question.

59
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:31,140
How is Libra a cryptocurrency?

60
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:35,380
Here's my very limited layman's knowledge on what a cryptocurrency actually is.

61
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:40,580
One, it's based on blockchain technology, making it extremely hard to regulate or interfere

62
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:41,580
with.

63
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:45,420
The blockchain was invented by Satoshi Nakamoto, which is probably a fake name, back in 2008.

64
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:50,140
The idea is that each block of data in the chain contains a cryptographic hash of the

65
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:54,940
previous block, along with a timestamp dating its generation and transaction data regarding

66
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:56,260
ownership of that block.

67
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:59,860
The ledger of the blockchain is available to all owners of a block via peer-to-peer

68
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:03,900
networking, the same basic tech as BitTorrent, ensuring that all people involved have the

69
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:04,900
same ledger.

70
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:07,180
P2P means that it's decentralized information.

71
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:10,740
If one person drops out, the ledger continues on through other users.

72
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:15,480
Because each block contains a record of previous blocks, it's also highly resistant to tampering.

73
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:19,700
New blocks in the chain are generated by mining, which is basically letting your computer run

74
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:23,860
algorithms to calculate the new data set for the next block, based on the hashes of all

75
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:28,120
the previous blocks nested within it, as glean from your copy of the blockchain ledger.

76
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:32,220
This means that as more blocks are generated, the more computational power it takes to generate

77
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:36,100
the next block, meaning that there is a level of scarcity regarding the theoretical number

78
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:37,100
of blocks.

79
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:40,540
This also means that all of those retards who spent hundreds of thousands of dollars

80
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:45,280
on GTX 1080s last year basically ruined their lives, because the more people who jumped

81
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:49,300
on the Bitcoin train, the costlier it became to actually mine the coins.

82
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:52,920
Using such rapid adoption of that technology, one of the many reasons that everyone who

83
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:55,980
kept their assets in Bitcoin lost everything.

84
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:58,480
But it's not just that a valid crypto has to be blockchain-based.

85
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:02,200
The second requirement is that it has to be freely traded at market value.

86
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:05,140
The price of Bitcoin fluctuates based on many factors.

87
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:09,080
The number of Bitcoins actually being bought and sold, the current number of miners as

88
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:13,280
I just mentioned, the current length of the blockchain, as well as various public trust

89
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:19,460
issues, like when CoinCheck got hacked and lost $530 million worth of its user's coin,

90
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:24,140
or when Facebook, Google, and Twitter decided to ban the use of crypto on their platforms.

91
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:27,620
And really, it's no surprise that Facebook banned the use of crypto back in March of

92
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:30,340
2018, if they were planning to make Libra all along.

93
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:34,720
John Todaro of TradeBlock has stated that Facebook's had Libra in the making for over

94
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:38,000
a year now, so of course they would go out of their way to ban their competition's

95
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
cryptos.

96
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,760
If it's tech-related and Silicon Valley can't control it, they will do anything

97
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:42,760
to stop it.

98
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:48,120
Libra, unlike actual cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, will not be traded at market value.

99
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:52,500
In CTV's article, A User Guide to Facebook's New Crypto, they write,

100
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:57,340
Bitcoin is known for its wide price fluctuations, but the price of Libra is expected to be more

101
00:05:57,340 --> 00:05:58,340
stable.

102
00:05:58,340 --> 00:06:01,960
That's because Libra's value will be pegged to established currencies like the Canadian

103
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:03,820
dollar, the US dollar, or the euro.

104
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:07,880
It will also be backed by a reserve fund, whereas Bitcoin is not.

105
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:11,840
Facebook hasn't said what assets that reserve fund will be made up of, but its white paper

106
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:16,400
suggests it will include bank deposits and government securities in currencies from stable

107
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,200
and reputable central banks.

108
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:20,960
And this is why Libra is not a true crypto.

109
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:24,920
Its price is artificially set by the holder of most of the Libra in existence, in this

110
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:26,100
case Facebook.

111
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:30,600
And unlike Bitcoin, which holds value because of the inherent rarity that blockchain technology

112
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:35,760
and mining for new coin provides, Libra holds value because of the backing of big banks.

113
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:41,120
The article also describes the Libra Association, which Facebook co-founded with Mastercard,

114
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:46,400
Visa, PayPal, and Uber, as well as like 20 other companies, acting as a monetary authority

115
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:47,640
to regulate Libra.

116
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:50,920
Who here is surprised to see Thrive Capital and Stripe on this list, considering their

117
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,800
involvement in the Patreon purge?

118
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:53,800
No?

119
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:54,800
No one?

120
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:55,800
Didn't think so.

121
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:59,960
I don't know about you, but to me, private companies creating their own currency that

122
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:04,680
they centrally control independent of market value and then also controlling the regulatory

123
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:08,720
body for that currency smells like an absolute disaster waiting to happen.

124
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:14,120
Oh, and by the way, this is why I was also partially wrong in my Is Dlive a Scam video,

125
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:16,760
guys, and I'm very sorry about my failure on that one.

126
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:21,160
Dlive does use blockchain technology, but it uses it in its stream encoding, not its

127
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:22,500
Lino currency.

128
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:26,920
Using blockchain on a stream or a video service means that content is unable to be edited

129
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:32,160
after publishing, making it a strong defense against false DMCA claims and censorious,

130
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,980
vaguely defined harassment and hate speech guidelines.

131
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:40,140
The Lino currency Dlive uses itself, despite being tracked on crypto trackers, is not actually

132
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:41,140
a crypto.

133
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:44,560
It's still a waste of your money, because when you buy Lino with real cash and donate

134
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:47,880
the Lino to a streamer, when the streamer withdraws the Lino they get less money than

135
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:52,340
you put into it, making Dlive's claim that they don't skim off the top complete BS.

136
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:54,300
But they're not as bad as I made it sound in the video.

137
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:58,700
As long as you're not actually dealing in Lino, Dlive's a fine platform to stream on.

138
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:00,140
Sorry guys, my bad.

139
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:01,140
Back to Libra though.

140
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:05,660
If cryptocurrencies require both blockchain technology to track ownership and prevent

141
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:09,780
fraud, as well as free trading on the open market in order to ensure the coin actually

142
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:14,820
has value to people and not just the authority pegging the price like with China's Yuan or

143
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:20,100
Venezuela's Bolivar, then the Libra cannot, by definition, be a true crypto.

144
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:23,900
Blockchain tech will keep it organized, but if Facebook centrally decides the value controls

145
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:27,300
the supply and regulates the practices, then it's not a free currency.

146
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:30,980
But beyond economic problems, there's also the problem of public trust.

147
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:35,620
For example, Sargon posted on his Facebook, neutrally, that our good friend Tommy R was

148
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:40,460
right on Muslim prison gangs in the UK, and Facebook deleted the post for hate speech.

149
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:43,460
Nothing hateful was present in the speech, but they did it anyway.

150
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:48,340
Facebook, like all other big social media platforms, routinely deletes, deplatforms,

151
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:52,160
and depersons individuals who disagree with radical leftist politics.

152
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:55,980
These are not the people we want in control of the online financial system.

153
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:59,900
card cards' heinous censorship of jihad watch and Patreon's purging of alternative

154
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:01,460
voices is bad enough.

155
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:03,020
This has to be opposed.

156
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:07,220
Hey, none of us are surprised that a group called Women's World Banking is in on this

157
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:08,220
garbage right?

158
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:12,220
In order to meet the needs of the nearly 1 billion women globally who lack access to

159
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:16,560
financial products and services, financial institutions need capital from gender lens

160
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:20,740
investors who understand that investing in women can provide both a social and financial

161
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:21,740
return.

162
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:24,540
In other words, it's completely fine to build the corporate dystopia, as long as our

163
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:27,700
authoritarian CEO overlords are feminists.

164
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:31,180
Considering how Silicon Valley is basically trying to sync up our entire lives with their

165
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:35,500
central servers, and their complete inability to maintain even a semblance of political

166
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:40,460
neutrality in their actions, I find it absolutely reprehensible that these companies subsist

167
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:42,460
on the teat of the American government.

168
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:49,060
Google, Microsoft, Facebook, Apple, and Amazon get $2 billion in data center tax breaks.

169
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:50,060
Economic benefit unclear.

170
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:54,000
Oh yeah, a lot of American states have been trying to court these companies for warehouses

171
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,360
and data centers, only to realize later that a lot of this stuff is automated and doesn't

172
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:00,000
actually bring any jobs with it.

173
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,400
While the number of construction jobs generated for each facility is comparable to building

174
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:07,800
a factory or distribution center, an operating data center creates an average of just 30-50

175
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:08,800
permanent jobs.

176
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:14,420
The incentive packages can be quite outlandish, far exceeding any reasonable economic justification,

177
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:19,060
said Todd L. Cherry, director of the Center for Economic Research and Policy Analysis

178
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:20,600
at Appalachian State University.

179
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:22,160
Hey, here's an idea.

180
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:25,520
If companies take government money and operate some type of a public square as part of their

181
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:30,300
business like Google, Facebook, and Twitter, maybe they should be legally required to protect

182
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:34,680
its users' first amendment rights, and if they fail to do so, they don't get the grants

183
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:36,280
they apply for.

184
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:37,280
Seems reasonable to me.

185
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:40,400
I mean, just look at how much money is being wasted.

186
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:43,600
Available over at the public subsidy tracker Good Jobs First.

187
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:48,920
According to these guys, Facebook has taken in $332 million in state subsidies.

188
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:53,300
$150 million came from the state of Utah to build a data center in Eagle Mountain, producing

189
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:55,560
an estimated 30-50 jobs.

190
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:59,560
Another $150 million from Texas this time to build a data center at Fort Worth, with

191
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:02,640
no tracked data regarding jobs created.

192
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,040
This is ridiculous.

193
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:08,680
Another argument against big tech censorship is the whole Marsh v. Alabama case.

194
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:11,600
And I know I've talked about it on this channel before, so bear with me.

195
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:16,700
The town of Chickasaw, Alabama in 1946 was a company town, meaning the entire town was

196
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:19,780
privately owned by the Gulf Shipbuilding Corporation.

197
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:23,720
Gulf built the town and everything in it to service its business needs.

198
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:28,060
Work facilities, houses for their workers, shops, and basic services, all provided by

199
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:29,060
the company.

200
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:33,820
So when Miss Marsh began distributing religious literature on the sidewalk, she was asked

201
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:37,700
to stop, and eventually arrested for trespassing when she refused.

202
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:42,060
Gulf's argument was that they owned the entire town, including places it normally considered

203
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:46,740
public property, like streets, and so they could restrict speech however they liked.

204
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:51,180
However, the court ruled in favor of Miss Marsh, stating that if a private entity holds

205
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:55,420
a monopoly on the public square, they are legally obligated to behave as if the government

206
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:58,660
would when it comes to the rule of law, including free speech rights.

207
00:11:58,660 --> 00:11:59,940
And to me this makes sense.

208
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:03,540
If a murder were committed in Chickasaw, the state police would still handle the case.

209
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:07,860
It wouldn't be handed off to a private police force even though the entire town was privately

210
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:08,860
owned.

211
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:12,580
Another lesson we can extract from Marsh v. Alabama is that companies with a monopoly

212
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:16,980
must behave responsibly, or the government will step in and either regulate them or break

213
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:17,980
them up.

214
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:21,620
Oh, and would you look at that, big tech is getting regulated because they won't behave

215
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:22,620
properly.

216
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:23,780
Who could have seen this coming?

217
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:27,900
Because this one seems to be the video where I admit all of my mistakes, I also made an

218
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:29,980
error in publishers versus platforms.

219
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:31,740
A pretty big one, in fact.

220
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:34,480
But it's also an error that everyone under the sun makes.

221
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:39,160
Under section 230 of the Communications Act, there's actually no definition of publisher

222
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:43,960
or platform, and there's no legal impetus for a platform to behave impartially.

223
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:48,480
In fact, as it's laid out in the Tech Dirt article, it's one thing for trolls and grandstanding

224
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:51,920
politicians to get 230 wrong, but the press shouldn't help them.

225
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:56,480
The law was actually designed to incentivize companies to censor its users.

226
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:01,620
Section B4 directly says that one of the policy goals of the law is to remove disincentives

227
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:05,520
for the development and utilization of blocking and filtering technologies.

228
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:10,720
And more importantly, section C2 makes it clear that section 230's intent was to encourage

229
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:14,580
moderation by taking away liability for any moderation decisions.

230
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:19,140
No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be held liable on account of

231
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:25,100
any action voluntarily taken in good faith to restrict access to or availability of material

232
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:30,780
that the provider or user considers to be obscene, lewd, filthy, excessively violent,

233
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:36,060
harassing, or otherwise objectionable, whether or not such material is constitutionally protected.

234
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:40,420
In short, if a site decides to remove content that it believes is objectionable, including

235
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:44,620
content it finds to be harassing, there is no liability for the platform even if the

236
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:47,140
content blocked is constitutionally protected.

237
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:48,780
So yeah, we all got that wrong.

238
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:53,560
230 is designed to give companies a cover for censorship, not designed to prevent it.

239
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:58,620
In Professor Jeff Kosseff's book, The 26 Words That Created the Internet, a book documenting

240
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:02,560
the history of section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, it's written that the government

241
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:09,560
was spurred to act by the court case Stratton Oakmont, Inc. v. Prodigy Services Co., 1995.

242
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:13,780
In this case, the court ruled that online service providers could be held liable for

243
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:15,140
the speech of their users.

244
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:19,580
The court decided that because Prodigy provided content guidelines for users, enforced those

245
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:23,980
rules with moderators, and used the basic software of the time to automatically regulate

246
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:28,060
speech through word filtering, that Prodigy was making an active effort to be responsible

247
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:32,620
for the speech on its platform, and therefore was legally liable for the speech not caught

248
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:33,620
by them.

249
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:36,860
This court ruling, on its own, would have set a precedent forcing Facebook and Twitter

250
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:41,320
and the like to either not moderate anything or be liable for anything they miss.

251
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:44,340
But this wasn't the only ruling influencing this situation.

252
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:49,380
Professor Kosseff also talks about Cubby, Inc. v. CompuServe, Inc., 1991, a ruling in

253
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:54,060
which Cubby sued CompuServe for defamation because CompuServe's users were posting

254
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:55,780
negative content about Cubby.

255
00:14:55,780 --> 00:15:00,100
Cubby's position was that CompuServe was liable for the content posted using its service,

256
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:03,740
and CompuServe's position was that it was not liable because it was a distributor and

257
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:04,740
not a publisher.

258
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:09,440
The court ruled that, as a distributor, CompuServe could only be held liable if it knew about

259
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:14,500
the content, but because CompuServe did not regulate its forms at all, it was not liable.

260
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:18,780
These two rulings, put together, created a problem for the burgeoning mid-90s internet.

261
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:22,380
Cubby v. CompuServe ruled that distributors of content who don't regulate what they

262
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:26,340
distribute aren't liable for the content specifically if they have no knowledge of

263
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:27,540
the content's existence.

264
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:31,980
Oakmont v. Prodigy ruled that any attempt to moderate an online community, even good

265
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:36,460
faith attempts, rendered the company legally liable for all content unmoderated.

266
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:38,760
This left the internet in a serious bind.

267
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:42,680
Companies had to either take responsibility for everything on their platform, a daunting

268
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:46,680
task with today's technology, let alone back in the 90s, or they had to willfully

269
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:50,220
blind themselves to their own service, to the point that companies weren't willing

270
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:54,840
to risk even benign forms of knowledge about what they themselves were actually doing.

271
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:59,620
This chilling effect caused a lot of companies who fashioned themselves as impartial distributors,

272
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:03,440
like CompuServe, to refuse to collect metrics about their users for the sole purpose of

273
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:07,420
offering a better product, like asking, how would you like to see our service improve

274
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:08,420
polls or something.

275
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:12,220
It also prevented them from policing content for legitimate and heinous breaches of the

276
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:14,280
law, like child pornography distribution.

277
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:18,220
It would have also made online shopping impossible had it existed back then due to the nature

278
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:21,640
of collecting relevant data from users in order to make a purchase.

279
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:25,260
If you want to know why mid-90s internet sucks so much, this is a big reason.

280
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:29,580
These companies were forced to keep themselves in the dark about their own practices.

281
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:32,120
Section 230 was, therefore, a compromise.

282
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:36,280
Rather than be responsible for everything if you curate, or force yourself to be blind

283
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:40,340
if you don't, it allowed internet companies to observe their users' behaviors while

284
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:42,700
not making them liable for those behaviors.

285
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:46,460
This was a groundbreaking decision that allowed the internet to flourish into what it is today.

286
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:49,820
230 gave internet companies the ability to regulate their users' content without being

287
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:53,700
liable for it, something that the early internet needed in order to survive.

288
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:57,460
And that's completely at odds with the public perception of 230 as the publisher versus

289
00:16:57,460 --> 00:17:00,660
platform dichotomy, which has no actual basis in the law.

290
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:05,460
However, the internet has changed since 1996, and nowadays 230's protections are being

291
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:08,060
used to censor people out of the internet public square.

292
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:10,340
Thankfully, we're not the only ones who have clued into this.

293
00:17:10,340 --> 00:17:14,660
Senator Josh Hawley is working on the Ending Support for Internet Censorship Act, which

294
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:19,900
modifies Section 230 to basically include the publisher versus platform thing that we

295
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:21,740
all thought I already had built into it.

296
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:25,560
Hawley's bill would task the Federal Trade Commission with certifying that tech companies

297
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:29,980
are approaching moderation in a neutral way, a requirement for any company with over 30

298
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:35,420
million monthly active users in the US, 300 million monthly active users globally, or

299
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:38,740
$500 million in global revenue.

300
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:43,060
Certification would require a supermajority vote, including at least one minority member,

301
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:44,860
and would occur every two years.

302
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:49,620
If a company over that threshold could not be certified, it would lose its Section 230

303
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:52,820
protections and be subject to intermediary liability litigation.

304
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:58,020
So basically, if the FTC determined that Facebook or any of the others is biased in moderation,

305
00:17:58,020 --> 00:18:01,860
then 230 protections no longer apply, and they can be held liable for all the legally

306
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:03,900
dubious content on their platforms.

307
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:07,060
Can you imagine if Facebook is held liable for Christchurch?

308
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:10,380
Or for any of the millions of defamatory posts on its platform?

309
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:11,860
They get sued into oblivion.

310
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:14,580
But check out Big Tech's objection to this regulation.

311
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:18,560
The Internet Association, which counts Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube as members, describe

312
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:20,780
the legislation as misguided and destructive.

313
00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:25,260
230 is the law that allows online companies to moderate and remove content that no reasonable

314
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:26,580
person wants online.

315
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:28,660
You just don't get it, do you?

316
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:31,420
You are not the arbiter of what is reasonable.

317
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:35,900
This bill forces platforms to make an impossible choice, either host reprehensible but First

318
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:40,140
Amendment protected speech, or lose legal protections that allow them to moderate illegal

319
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:41,140
content.

320
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:43,820
If this is First Amendment protected, you should not be stepping in.

321
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:48,420
You're forcing your definition of what is reprehensible onto everyone else.

322
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:51,740
Like it's, say, an axiomatic presupposition.

323
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:55,100
There's multiple angles we can take to stop Big Tech.

324
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:56,580
Changing 230 is one.

325
00:18:56,580 --> 00:19:00,120
Marsh v Alabama and designating an online public square is another.

326
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:03,980
An Internet Bill of Rights declaring online accounts to be property and use of communication

327
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:06,020
services to be a right is another.

328
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:09,780
Pulling government funding for Big Tech that refuses to uphold the First Amendment is yet

329
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:10,780
another.

330
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:14,020
I started this video with Libra and ended it on free speech, but that's because they're

331
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:15,020
all related.

332
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:18,520
We've seen how poorly these people and these companies treat speech.

333
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:22,980
They will treat money the exact same way, if we don't oppose this here and now.

334
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:26,340
I don't trust Facebook with my money just like I don't trust them with my data and

335
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:27,340
with my speech.

336
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:30,780
I don't want to live in a future where I can't pay my bills because I said a naughty

337
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:31,780
word on the internet.

338
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:37,780
Oh, also?

339
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:39,780
Libra doesn't even work.

340
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:42,780
I don't trust Facebook with my money just like I don't trust them with my speech.
