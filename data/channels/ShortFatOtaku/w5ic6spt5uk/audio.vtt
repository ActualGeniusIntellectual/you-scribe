00:00.000 --> 00:03.480
Do you know who Palantir is?

00:03.480 --> 00:06.640
I do.

00:06.640 --> 00:13.000
Some people have referred to them as Stanford Analytica.

00:13.000 --> 00:14.000
Do you agree?

00:14.000 --> 00:16.040
Senator, I have not heard that.

00:16.040 --> 00:17.040
Okay.

00:17.040 --> 00:22.920
Do you think Palantir taught Cambridge Analytica, as press reports are saying, how to do these

00:22.920 --> 00:23.920
tactics?

00:23.920 --> 00:28.120
Senator, I don't know.

00:28.240 --> 00:32.240
Do you think that Palantir has ever scraped data from Facebook?

00:32.240 --> 00:36.240
Senator, I'm not aware of that.

00:36.240 --> 00:37.240
Okay.

00:37.240 --> 00:42.040
Mr. Zuckerberg, would you be comfortable sharing with us the name of the hotel you stayed in

00:42.040 --> 00:45.040
last night?

00:45.040 --> 00:52.320
Um, uh, no.

00:52.320 --> 00:56.800
If you've messaged anybody this week, would you share with us the names of the people

00:56.800 --> 00:57.800
you've messaged?

00:57.800 --> 01:02.040
Senator, no, I would probably not choose to do that publicly here.

01:02.040 --> 01:05.120
I think that may be what this is all about.

01:05.120 --> 01:11.200
Here's what everybody's been trying to tell you today, and I say this gently.

01:11.200 --> 01:16.200
Your user agreement sucks.

01:16.200 --> 01:26.680
I'm going to suggest to you that you go back home and rewrite it.

01:26.680 --> 01:30.680
Let's talk about that Facebook cryptocurrency that I brought up last video.

01:30.680 --> 01:31.680
Libra.

01:31.680 --> 01:35.480
Facebook launches cryptocurrency in bid to shake up global finance.

01:35.480 --> 01:40.000
Digital currency will let billions of users make transactions, but is already facing opposition

01:40.000 --> 01:42.800
from US lawmakers amid privacy concerns.

01:42.800 --> 01:47.960
You know, for The Guardian, this related article here is pretty red pilled.

01:47.960 --> 01:50.680
Facebook's Libra launch will extend its global domination.

01:50.680 --> 01:56.600
I mean, I agree, but I guess it's lefty authoritative sources that are allowed to talk about

01:56.600 --> 02:00.560
conspiracy theories nowadays and not regular plebs like us.

02:00.560 --> 02:04.360
Facebook has announced a digital currency called Libra that will allow its billions

02:04.360 --> 02:08.580
of users to make financial transactions across the globe in a move that could potentially

02:08.580 --> 02:10.480
shake up the world's banking system.

02:10.480 --> 02:14.240
Libra is being touted as a means to connect people who do not have access to traditional

02:14.240 --> 02:15.240
banking platforms.

02:15.240 --> 02:19.440
Yeah, this sounds like another variant of the whole financial inclusion thing I mentioned

02:19.440 --> 02:24.360
in my Mastercard video last year, where these companies have the long-term goal of everybody's

02:24.360 --> 02:28.360
financial transactions happening online so that they can more effectively control them.

02:28.360 --> 02:33.480
I mean, really, when a credit card CEO tells you that cash is discriminatory, it doesn't

02:33.480 --> 02:36.240
take a genius to realize they've got something up their sleeve.

02:36.240 --> 02:41.600
With close to 2.4 billion people using Facebook each month, Libra could be a financial game

02:41.600 --> 02:46.040
changer, but will face close scrutiny as Facebook continues to reel from a series of privacy

02:46.040 --> 02:47.040
scandals.

02:47.040 --> 02:48.560
And yeah, this is why I won't be using it.

02:48.560 --> 02:52.920
I trust the randoms on eBay to not send me a bomb more than I trust Facebook with managing

02:52.920 --> 02:53.920
my money.

02:53.920 --> 02:57.200
I withdraw from PayPal almost daily nowadays because I don't trust them either.

02:57.200 --> 03:00.800
US lawmakers were quick to raise privacy concerns about the new currency.

03:00.800 --> 03:04.540
Shortly after Facebook's announcement, the Congresswoman and chair of the House Financial

03:04.540 --> 03:08.440
Services Committee, Maxine Waters, called on the company to put a stop to the project

03:08.440 --> 03:10.880
until Congress and regulators could review it.

03:10.880 --> 03:14.460
She also called on company executives to testify before the committee.

03:14.460 --> 03:18.200
Facebook has data on billions of people, and has repeatedly shown a disregard for the protection

03:18.200 --> 03:19.900
and careful use of this data.

03:19.900 --> 03:23.700
With the announcement that it plans to create a cryptocurrency, Facebook is continuing its

03:23.700 --> 03:27.540
unchecked expansion and extending its reach into the lives of its users.

03:27.540 --> 03:29.020
I've got to raise this question.

03:29.020 --> 03:31.140
How is Libra a cryptocurrency?

03:31.140 --> 03:35.380
Here's my very limited layman's knowledge on what a cryptocurrency actually is.

03:35.380 --> 03:40.580
One, it's based on blockchain technology, making it extremely hard to regulate or interfere

03:40.580 --> 03:41.580
with.

03:41.580 --> 03:45.420
The blockchain was invented by Satoshi Nakamoto, which is probably a fake name, back in 2008.

03:45.420 --> 03:50.140
The idea is that each block of data in the chain contains a cryptographic hash of the

03:50.140 --> 03:54.940
previous block, along with a timestamp dating its generation and transaction data regarding

03:54.940 --> 03:56.260
ownership of that block.

03:56.260 --> 03:59.860
The ledger of the blockchain is available to all owners of a block via peer-to-peer

03:59.860 --> 04:03.900
networking, the same basic tech as BitTorrent, ensuring that all people involved have the

04:03.900 --> 04:04.900
same ledger.

04:04.900 --> 04:07.180
P2P means that it's decentralized information.

04:07.180 --> 04:10.740
If one person drops out, the ledger continues on through other users.

04:10.740 --> 04:15.480
Because each block contains a record of previous blocks, it's also highly resistant to tampering.

04:15.480 --> 04:19.700
New blocks in the chain are generated by mining, which is basically letting your computer run

04:19.740 --> 04:23.860
algorithms to calculate the new data set for the next block, based on the hashes of all

04:23.860 --> 04:28.120
the previous blocks nested within it, as glean from your copy of the blockchain ledger.

04:28.120 --> 04:32.220
This means that as more blocks are generated, the more computational power it takes to generate

04:32.220 --> 04:36.100
the next block, meaning that there is a level of scarcity regarding the theoretical number

04:36.100 --> 04:37.100
of blocks.

04:37.100 --> 04:40.540
This also means that all of those retards who spent hundreds of thousands of dollars

04:40.540 --> 04:45.280
on GTX 1080s last year basically ruined their lives, because the more people who jumped

04:45.280 --> 04:49.300
on the Bitcoin train, the costlier it became to actually mine the coins.

04:49.300 --> 04:52.920
Using such rapid adoption of that technology, one of the many reasons that everyone who

04:52.920 --> 04:55.980
kept their assets in Bitcoin lost everything.

04:55.980 --> 04:58.480
But it's not just that a valid crypto has to be blockchain-based.

04:58.480 --> 05:02.200
The second requirement is that it has to be freely traded at market value.

05:02.200 --> 05:05.140
The price of Bitcoin fluctuates based on many factors.

05:05.140 --> 05:09.080
The number of Bitcoins actually being bought and sold, the current number of miners as

05:09.080 --> 05:13.280
I just mentioned, the current length of the blockchain, as well as various public trust

05:13.280 --> 05:19.460
issues, like when CoinCheck got hacked and lost $530 million worth of its user's coin,

05:19.460 --> 05:24.140
or when Facebook, Google, and Twitter decided to ban the use of crypto on their platforms.

05:24.140 --> 05:27.620
And really, it's no surprise that Facebook banned the use of crypto back in March of

05:27.620 --> 05:30.340
2018, if they were planning to make Libra all along.

05:30.340 --> 05:34.720
John Todaro of TradeBlock has stated that Facebook's had Libra in the making for over

05:34.720 --> 05:38.000
a year now, so of course they would go out of their way to ban their competition's

05:38.000 --> 05:39.000
cryptos.

05:39.000 --> 05:41.760
If it's tech-related and Silicon Valley can't control it, they will do anything

05:41.760 --> 05:42.760
to stop it.

05:43.240 --> 05:48.120
Libra, unlike actual cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, will not be traded at market value.

05:48.120 --> 05:52.500
In CTV's article, A User Guide to Facebook's New Crypto, they write,

05:52.500 --> 05:57.340
Bitcoin is known for its wide price fluctuations, but the price of Libra is expected to be more

05:57.340 --> 05:58.340
stable.

05:58.340 --> 06:01.960
That's because Libra's value will be pegged to established currencies like the Canadian

06:01.960 --> 06:03.820
dollar, the US dollar, or the euro.

06:03.820 --> 06:07.880
It will also be backed by a reserve fund, whereas Bitcoin is not.

06:07.880 --> 06:11.840
Facebook hasn't said what assets that reserve fund will be made up of, but its white paper

06:11.840 --> 06:16.400
suggests it will include bank deposits and government securities in currencies from stable

06:16.400 --> 06:18.200
and reputable central banks.

06:18.200 --> 06:20.960
And this is why Libra is not a true crypto.

06:20.960 --> 06:24.920
Its price is artificially set by the holder of most of the Libra in existence, in this

06:24.920 --> 06:26.100
case Facebook.

06:26.100 --> 06:30.600
And unlike Bitcoin, which holds value because of the inherent rarity that blockchain technology

06:30.600 --> 06:35.760
and mining for new coin provides, Libra holds value because of the backing of big banks.

06:35.760 --> 06:41.120
The article also describes the Libra Association, which Facebook co-founded with Mastercard,

06:41.120 --> 06:46.400
Visa, PayPal, and Uber, as well as like 20 other companies, acting as a monetary authority

06:46.400 --> 06:47.640
to regulate Libra.

06:47.640 --> 06:50.920
Who here is surprised to see Thrive Capital and Stripe on this list, considering their

06:50.920 --> 06:52.800
involvement in the Patreon purge?

06:52.800 --> 06:53.800
No?

06:53.800 --> 06:54.800
No one?

06:54.800 --> 06:55.800
Didn't think so.

06:55.800 --> 06:59.960
I don't know about you, but to me, private companies creating their own currency that

06:59.960 --> 07:04.680
they centrally control independent of market value and then also controlling the regulatory

07:04.680 --> 07:08.720
body for that currency smells like an absolute disaster waiting to happen.

07:08.720 --> 07:14.120
Oh, and by the way, this is why I was also partially wrong in my Is Dlive a Scam video,

07:14.120 --> 07:16.760
guys, and I'm very sorry about my failure on that one.

07:16.760 --> 07:21.160
Dlive does use blockchain technology, but it uses it in its stream encoding, not its

07:21.160 --> 07:22.500
Lino currency.

07:22.500 --> 07:26.920
Using blockchain on a stream or a video service means that content is unable to be edited

07:26.920 --> 07:32.160
after publishing, making it a strong defense against false DMCA claims and censorious,

07:32.160 --> 07:34.980
vaguely defined harassment and hate speech guidelines.

07:34.980 --> 07:40.140
The Lino currency Dlive uses itself, despite being tracked on crypto trackers, is not actually

07:40.140 --> 07:41.140
a crypto.

07:41.140 --> 07:44.560
It's still a waste of your money, because when you buy Lino with real cash and donate

07:44.560 --> 07:47.880
the Lino to a streamer, when the streamer withdraws the Lino they get less money than

07:47.880 --> 07:52.340
you put into it, making Dlive's claim that they don't skim off the top complete BS.

07:52.340 --> 07:54.300
But they're not as bad as I made it sound in the video.

07:54.300 --> 07:58.700
As long as you're not actually dealing in Lino, Dlive's a fine platform to stream on.

07:58.700 --> 08:00.140
Sorry guys, my bad.

08:00.140 --> 08:01.140
Back to Libra though.

08:01.140 --> 08:05.660
If cryptocurrencies require both blockchain technology to track ownership and prevent

08:05.660 --> 08:09.780
fraud, as well as free trading on the open market in order to ensure the coin actually

08:09.780 --> 08:14.820
has value to people and not just the authority pegging the price like with China's Yuan or

08:14.820 --> 08:20.100
Venezuela's Bolivar, then the Libra cannot, by definition, be a true crypto.

08:20.100 --> 08:23.900
Blockchain tech will keep it organized, but if Facebook centrally decides the value controls

08:23.900 --> 08:27.300
the supply and regulates the practices, then it's not a free currency.

08:27.300 --> 08:30.980
But beyond economic problems, there's also the problem of public trust.

08:30.980 --> 08:35.620
For example, Sargon posted on his Facebook, neutrally, that our good friend Tommy R was

08:35.620 --> 08:40.460
right on Muslim prison gangs in the UK, and Facebook deleted the post for hate speech.

08:40.460 --> 08:43.460
Nothing hateful was present in the speech, but they did it anyway.

08:43.460 --> 08:48.340
Facebook, like all other big social media platforms, routinely deletes, deplatforms,

08:48.340 --> 08:52.160
and depersons individuals who disagree with radical leftist politics.

08:52.160 --> 08:55.980
These are not the people we want in control of the online financial system.

08:55.980 --> 08:59.900
card cards' heinous censorship of jihad watch and Patreon's purging of alternative

08:59.900 --> 09:01.460
voices is bad enough.

09:01.460 --> 09:03.020
This has to be opposed.

09:03.020 --> 09:07.220
Hey, none of us are surprised that a group called Women's World Banking is in on this

09:07.220 --> 09:08.220
garbage right?

09:08.220 --> 09:12.220
In order to meet the needs of the nearly 1 billion women globally who lack access to

09:12.220 --> 09:16.560
financial products and services, financial institutions need capital from gender lens

09:16.560 --> 09:20.740
investors who understand that investing in women can provide both a social and financial

09:20.740 --> 09:21.740
return.

09:21.740 --> 09:24.540
In other words, it's completely fine to build the corporate dystopia, as long as our

09:24.540 --> 09:27.700
authoritarian CEO overlords are feminists.

09:27.700 --> 09:31.180
Considering how Silicon Valley is basically trying to sync up our entire lives with their

09:31.180 --> 09:35.500
central servers, and their complete inability to maintain even a semblance of political

09:35.500 --> 09:40.460
neutrality in their actions, I find it absolutely reprehensible that these companies subsist

09:40.460 --> 09:42.460
on the teat of the American government.

09:42.460 --> 09:49.060
Google, Microsoft, Facebook, Apple, and Amazon get $2 billion in data center tax breaks.

09:49.060 --> 09:50.060
Economic benefit unclear.

09:50.060 --> 09:54.000
Oh yeah, a lot of American states have been trying to court these companies for warehouses

09:54.000 --> 09:58.360
and data centers, only to realize later that a lot of this stuff is automated and doesn't

09:58.360 --> 10:00.000
actually bring any jobs with it.

10:00.000 --> 10:03.400
While the number of construction jobs generated for each facility is comparable to building

10:03.400 --> 10:07.800
a factory or distribution center, an operating data center creates an average of just 30-50

10:07.800 --> 10:08.800
permanent jobs.

10:08.800 --> 10:14.420
The incentive packages can be quite outlandish, far exceeding any reasonable economic justification,

10:14.420 --> 10:19.060
said Todd L. Cherry, director of the Center for Economic Research and Policy Analysis

10:19.060 --> 10:20.600
at Appalachian State University.

10:20.600 --> 10:22.160
Hey, here's an idea.

10:22.160 --> 10:25.520
If companies take government money and operate some type of a public square as part of their

10:25.520 --> 10:30.300
business like Google, Facebook, and Twitter, maybe they should be legally required to protect

10:30.300 --> 10:34.680
its users' first amendment rights, and if they fail to do so, they don't get the grants

10:34.680 --> 10:36.280
they apply for.

10:36.280 --> 10:37.280
Seems reasonable to me.

10:37.280 --> 10:40.400
I mean, just look at how much money is being wasted.

10:40.400 --> 10:43.600
Available over at the public subsidy tracker Good Jobs First.

10:43.600 --> 10:48.920
According to these guys, Facebook has taken in $332 million in state subsidies.

10:48.960 --> 10:53.300
$150 million came from the state of Utah to build a data center in Eagle Mountain, producing

10:53.300 --> 10:55.560
an estimated 30-50 jobs.

10:55.560 --> 10:59.560
Another $150 million from Texas this time to build a data center at Fort Worth, with

10:59.560 --> 11:02.640
no tracked data regarding jobs created.

11:02.640 --> 11:04.040
This is ridiculous.

11:04.040 --> 11:08.680
Another argument against big tech censorship is the whole Marsh v. Alabama case.

11:08.680 --> 11:11.600
And I know I've talked about it on this channel before, so bear with me.

11:11.600 --> 11:16.700
The town of Chickasaw, Alabama in 1946 was a company town, meaning the entire town was

11:16.700 --> 11:19.780
privately owned by the Gulf Shipbuilding Corporation.

11:19.780 --> 11:23.720
Gulf built the town and everything in it to service its business needs.

11:23.720 --> 11:28.060
Work facilities, houses for their workers, shops, and basic services, all provided by

11:28.060 --> 11:29.060
the company.

11:29.060 --> 11:33.820
So when Miss Marsh began distributing religious literature on the sidewalk, she was asked

11:33.820 --> 11:37.700
to stop, and eventually arrested for trespassing when she refused.

11:37.700 --> 11:42.060
Gulf's argument was that they owned the entire town, including places it normally considered

11:42.060 --> 11:46.740
public property, like streets, and so they could restrict speech however they liked.

11:46.740 --> 11:51.180
However, the court ruled in favor of Miss Marsh, stating that if a private entity holds

11:51.180 --> 11:55.420
a monopoly on the public square, they are legally obligated to behave as if the government

11:55.420 --> 11:58.660
would when it comes to the rule of law, including free speech rights.

11:58.660 --> 11:59.940
And to me this makes sense.

11:59.940 --> 12:03.540
If a murder were committed in Chickasaw, the state police would still handle the case.

12:03.540 --> 12:07.860
It wouldn't be handed off to a private police force even though the entire town was privately

12:07.860 --> 12:08.860
owned.

12:08.860 --> 12:12.580
Another lesson we can extract from Marsh v. Alabama is that companies with a monopoly

12:12.580 --> 12:16.980
must behave responsibly, or the government will step in and either regulate them or break

12:16.980 --> 12:17.980
them up.

12:17.980 --> 12:21.620
Oh, and would you look at that, big tech is getting regulated because they won't behave

12:21.620 --> 12:22.620
properly.

12:22.620 --> 12:23.780
Who could have seen this coming?

12:23.780 --> 12:27.900
Because this one seems to be the video where I admit all of my mistakes, I also made an

12:27.900 --> 12:29.980
error in publishers versus platforms.

12:29.980 --> 12:31.740
A pretty big one, in fact.

12:31.740 --> 12:34.480
But it's also an error that everyone under the sun makes.

12:34.480 --> 12:39.160
Under section 230 of the Communications Act, there's actually no definition of publisher

12:39.160 --> 12:43.960
or platform, and there's no legal impetus for a platform to behave impartially.

12:43.960 --> 12:48.480
In fact, as it's laid out in the Tech Dirt article, it's one thing for trolls and grandstanding

12:48.480 --> 12:51.920
politicians to get 230 wrong, but the press shouldn't help them.

12:51.920 --> 12:56.480
The law was actually designed to incentivize companies to censor its users.

12:56.480 --> 13:01.620
Section B4 directly says that one of the policy goals of the law is to remove disincentives

13:01.620 --> 13:05.520
for the development and utilization of blocking and filtering technologies.

13:05.520 --> 13:10.720
And more importantly, section C2 makes it clear that section 230's intent was to encourage

13:10.720 --> 13:14.580
moderation by taking away liability for any moderation decisions.

13:14.580 --> 13:19.140
No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be held liable on account of

13:19.140 --> 13:25.100
any action voluntarily taken in good faith to restrict access to or availability of material

13:25.100 --> 13:30.780
that the provider or user considers to be obscene, lewd, filthy, excessively violent,

13:30.780 --> 13:36.060
harassing, or otherwise objectionable, whether or not such material is constitutionally protected.

13:36.060 --> 13:40.420
In short, if a site decides to remove content that it believes is objectionable, including

13:40.420 --> 13:44.620
content it finds to be harassing, there is no liability for the platform even if the

13:44.620 --> 13:47.140
content blocked is constitutionally protected.

13:47.140 --> 13:48.780
So yeah, we all got that wrong.

13:48.780 --> 13:53.560
230 is designed to give companies a cover for censorship, not designed to prevent it.

13:53.560 --> 13:58.620
In Professor Jeff Kosseff's book, The 26 Words That Created the Internet, a book documenting

13:58.620 --> 14:02.560
the history of section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, it's written that the government

14:02.560 --> 14:09.560
was spurred to act by the court case Stratton Oakmont, Inc. v. Prodigy Services Co., 1995.

14:09.560 --> 14:13.780
In this case, the court ruled that online service providers could be held liable for

14:13.780 --> 14:15.140
the speech of their users.

14:15.140 --> 14:19.580
The court decided that because Prodigy provided content guidelines for users, enforced those

14:19.580 --> 14:23.980
rules with moderators, and used the basic software of the time to automatically regulate

14:23.980 --> 14:28.060
speech through word filtering, that Prodigy was making an active effort to be responsible

14:28.060 --> 14:32.620
for the speech on its platform, and therefore was legally liable for the speech not caught

14:32.620 --> 14:33.620
by them.

14:33.620 --> 14:36.860
This court ruling, on its own, would have set a precedent forcing Facebook and Twitter

14:36.860 --> 14:41.320
and the like to either not moderate anything or be liable for anything they miss.

14:41.320 --> 14:44.340
But this wasn't the only ruling influencing this situation.

14:44.340 --> 14:49.380
Professor Kosseff also talks about Cubby, Inc. v. CompuServe, Inc., 1991, a ruling in

14:49.380 --> 14:54.060
which Cubby sued CompuServe for defamation because CompuServe's users were posting

14:54.060 --> 14:55.780
negative content about Cubby.

14:55.780 --> 15:00.100
Cubby's position was that CompuServe was liable for the content posted using its service,

15:00.100 --> 15:03.740
and CompuServe's position was that it was not liable because it was a distributor and

15:03.740 --> 15:04.740
not a publisher.

15:04.740 --> 15:09.440
The court ruled that, as a distributor, CompuServe could only be held liable if it knew about

15:09.440 --> 15:14.500
the content, but because CompuServe did not regulate its forms at all, it was not liable.

15:14.500 --> 15:18.780
These two rulings, put together, created a problem for the burgeoning mid-90s internet.

15:18.780 --> 15:22.380
Cubby v. CompuServe ruled that distributors of content who don't regulate what they

15:22.380 --> 15:26.340
distribute aren't liable for the content specifically if they have no knowledge of

15:26.340 --> 15:27.540
the content's existence.

15:27.540 --> 15:31.980
Oakmont v. Prodigy ruled that any attempt to moderate an online community, even good

15:31.980 --> 15:36.460
faith attempts, rendered the company legally liable for all content unmoderated.

15:36.460 --> 15:38.760
This left the internet in a serious bind.

15:38.760 --> 15:42.680
Companies had to either take responsibility for everything on their platform, a daunting

15:42.680 --> 15:46.680
task with today's technology, let alone back in the 90s, or they had to willfully

15:46.680 --> 15:50.220
blind themselves to their own service, to the point that companies weren't willing

15:50.220 --> 15:54.840
to risk even benign forms of knowledge about what they themselves were actually doing.

15:54.840 --> 15:59.620
This chilling effect caused a lot of companies who fashioned themselves as impartial distributors,

15:59.620 --> 16:03.440
like CompuServe, to refuse to collect metrics about their users for the sole purpose of

16:03.440 --> 16:07.420
offering a better product, like asking, how would you like to see our service improve

16:07.420 --> 16:08.420
polls or something.

16:08.420 --> 16:12.220
It also prevented them from policing content for legitimate and heinous breaches of the

16:12.220 --> 16:14.280
law, like child pornography distribution.

16:14.280 --> 16:18.220
It would have also made online shopping impossible had it existed back then due to the nature

16:18.220 --> 16:21.640
of collecting relevant data from users in order to make a purchase.

16:21.640 --> 16:25.260
If you want to know why mid-90s internet sucks so much, this is a big reason.

16:25.260 --> 16:29.580
These companies were forced to keep themselves in the dark about their own practices.

16:29.580 --> 16:32.120
Section 230 was, therefore, a compromise.

16:32.120 --> 16:36.280
Rather than be responsible for everything if you curate, or force yourself to be blind

16:36.280 --> 16:40.340
if you don't, it allowed internet companies to observe their users' behaviors while

16:40.340 --> 16:42.700
not making them liable for those behaviors.

16:42.700 --> 16:46.460
This was a groundbreaking decision that allowed the internet to flourish into what it is today.

16:46.500 --> 16:49.820
230 gave internet companies the ability to regulate their users' content without being

16:49.820 --> 16:53.700
liable for it, something that the early internet needed in order to survive.

16:53.700 --> 16:57.460
And that's completely at odds with the public perception of 230 as the publisher versus

16:57.460 --> 17:00.660
platform dichotomy, which has no actual basis in the law.

17:00.660 --> 17:05.460
However, the internet has changed since 1996, and nowadays 230's protections are being

17:05.460 --> 17:08.060
used to censor people out of the internet public square.

17:08.060 --> 17:10.340
Thankfully, we're not the only ones who have clued into this.

17:10.340 --> 17:14.660
Senator Josh Hawley is working on the Ending Support for Internet Censorship Act, which

17:14.660 --> 17:19.900
modifies Section 230 to basically include the publisher versus platform thing that we

17:19.900 --> 17:21.740
all thought I already had built into it.

17:21.740 --> 17:25.560
Hawley's bill would task the Federal Trade Commission with certifying that tech companies

17:25.560 --> 17:29.980
are approaching moderation in a neutral way, a requirement for any company with over 30

17:29.980 --> 17:35.420
million monthly active users in the US, 300 million monthly active users globally, or

17:35.420 --> 17:38.740
$500 million in global revenue.

17:38.740 --> 17:43.060
Certification would require a supermajority vote, including at least one minority member,

17:43.060 --> 17:44.860
and would occur every two years.

17:44.860 --> 17:49.620
If a company over that threshold could not be certified, it would lose its Section 230

17:49.620 --> 17:52.820
protections and be subject to intermediary liability litigation.

17:52.820 --> 17:58.020
So basically, if the FTC determined that Facebook or any of the others is biased in moderation,

17:58.020 --> 18:01.860
then 230 protections no longer apply, and they can be held liable for all the legally

18:01.860 --> 18:03.900
dubious content on their platforms.

18:03.900 --> 18:07.060
Can you imagine if Facebook is held liable for Christchurch?

18:07.060 --> 18:10.380
Or for any of the millions of defamatory posts on its platform?

18:10.380 --> 18:11.860
They get sued into oblivion.

18:11.860 --> 18:14.580
But check out Big Tech's objection to this regulation.

18:14.580 --> 18:18.560
The Internet Association, which counts Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube as members, describe

18:18.560 --> 18:20.780
the legislation as misguided and destructive.

18:20.780 --> 18:25.260
230 is the law that allows online companies to moderate and remove content that no reasonable

18:25.260 --> 18:26.580
person wants online.

18:26.580 --> 18:28.660
You just don't get it, do you?

18:28.660 --> 18:31.420
You are not the arbiter of what is reasonable.

18:31.420 --> 18:35.900
This bill forces platforms to make an impossible choice, either host reprehensible but First

18:35.900 --> 18:40.140
Amendment protected speech, or lose legal protections that allow them to moderate illegal

18:40.140 --> 18:41.140
content.

18:41.420 --> 18:43.820
If this is First Amendment protected, you should not be stepping in.

18:43.820 --> 18:48.420
You're forcing your definition of what is reprehensible onto everyone else.

18:48.420 --> 18:51.740
Like it's, say, an axiomatic presupposition.

18:51.740 --> 18:55.100
There's multiple angles we can take to stop Big Tech.

18:55.100 --> 18:56.580
Changing 230 is one.

18:56.580 --> 19:00.120
Marsh v Alabama and designating an online public square is another.

19:00.120 --> 19:03.980
An Internet Bill of Rights declaring online accounts to be property and use of communication

19:03.980 --> 19:06.020
services to be a right is another.

19:06.020 --> 19:09.780
Pulling government funding for Big Tech that refuses to uphold the First Amendment is yet

19:09.780 --> 19:10.780
another.

19:11.420 --> 19:14.020
I started this video with Libra and ended it on free speech, but that's because they're

19:14.020 --> 19:15.020
all related.

19:15.020 --> 19:18.520
We've seen how poorly these people and these companies treat speech.

19:18.520 --> 19:22.980
They will treat money the exact same way, if we don't oppose this here and now.

19:22.980 --> 19:26.340
I don't trust Facebook with my money just like I don't trust them with my data and

19:26.340 --> 19:27.340
with my speech.

19:27.340 --> 19:30.780
I don't want to live in a future where I can't pay my bills because I said a naughty

19:30.780 --> 19:31.780
word on the internet.

19:35.780 --> 19:37.780
Oh, also?

19:37.780 --> 19:39.780
Libra doesn't even work.

19:40.780 --> 19:42.780
I don't trust Facebook with my money just like I don't trust them with my speech.
