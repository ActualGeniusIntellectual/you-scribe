0	3480	Do you know who Palantir is?
3480	6640	I do.
6640	13000	Some people have referred to them as Stanford Analytica.
13000	14000	Do you agree?
14000	16040	Senator, I have not heard that.
16040	17040	Okay.
17040	22920	Do you think Palantir taught Cambridge Analytica, as press reports are saying, how to do these
22920	23920	tactics?
23920	28120	Senator, I don't know.
28240	32240	Do you think that Palantir has ever scraped data from Facebook?
32240	36240	Senator, I'm not aware of that.
36240	37240	Okay.
37240	42040	Mr. Zuckerberg, would you be comfortable sharing with us the name of the hotel you stayed in
42040	45040	last night?
45040	52320	Um, uh, no.
52320	56800	If you've messaged anybody this week, would you share with us the names of the people
56800	57800	you've messaged?
57800	62040	Senator, no, I would probably not choose to do that publicly here.
62040	65120	I think that may be what this is all about.
65120	71200	Here's what everybody's been trying to tell you today, and I say this gently.
71200	76200	Your user agreement sucks.
76200	86680	I'm going to suggest to you that you go back home and rewrite it.
86680	90680	Let's talk about that Facebook cryptocurrency that I brought up last video.
90680	91680	Libra.
91680	95480	Facebook launches cryptocurrency in bid to shake up global finance.
95480	100000	Digital currency will let billions of users make transactions, but is already facing opposition
100000	102800	from US lawmakers amid privacy concerns.
102800	107960	You know, for The Guardian, this related article here is pretty red pilled.
107960	110680	Facebook's Libra launch will extend its global domination.
110680	116600	I mean, I agree, but I guess it's lefty authoritative sources that are allowed to talk about
116600	120560	conspiracy theories nowadays and not regular plebs like us.
120560	124360	Facebook has announced a digital currency called Libra that will allow its billions
124360	128580	of users to make financial transactions across the globe in a move that could potentially
128580	130480	shake up the world's banking system.
130480	134240	Libra is being touted as a means to connect people who do not have access to traditional
134240	135240	banking platforms.
135240	139440	Yeah, this sounds like another variant of the whole financial inclusion thing I mentioned
139440	144360	in my Mastercard video last year, where these companies have the long-term goal of everybody's
144360	148360	financial transactions happening online so that they can more effectively control them.
148360	153480	I mean, really, when a credit card CEO tells you that cash is discriminatory, it doesn't
153480	156240	take a genius to realize they've got something up their sleeve.
156240	161600	With close to 2.4 billion people using Facebook each month, Libra could be a financial game
161600	166040	changer, but will face close scrutiny as Facebook continues to reel from a series of privacy
166040	167040	scandals.
167040	168560	And yeah, this is why I won't be using it.
168560	172920	I trust the randoms on eBay to not send me a bomb more than I trust Facebook with managing
172920	173920	my money.
173920	177200	I withdraw from PayPal almost daily nowadays because I don't trust them either.
177200	180800	US lawmakers were quick to raise privacy concerns about the new currency.
180800	184540	Shortly after Facebook's announcement, the Congresswoman and chair of the House Financial
184540	188440	Services Committee, Maxine Waters, called on the company to put a stop to the project
188440	190880	until Congress and regulators could review it.
190880	194460	She also called on company executives to testify before the committee.
194460	198200	Facebook has data on billions of people, and has repeatedly shown a disregard for the protection
198200	199900	and careful use of this data.
199900	203700	With the announcement that it plans to create a cryptocurrency, Facebook is continuing its
203700	207540	unchecked expansion and extending its reach into the lives of its users.
207540	209020	I've got to raise this question.
209020	211140	How is Libra a cryptocurrency?
211140	215380	Here's my very limited layman's knowledge on what a cryptocurrency actually is.
215380	220580	One, it's based on blockchain technology, making it extremely hard to regulate or interfere
220580	221580	with.
221580	225420	The blockchain was invented by Satoshi Nakamoto, which is probably a fake name, back in 2008.
225420	230140	The idea is that each block of data in the chain contains a cryptographic hash of the
230140	234940	previous block, along with a timestamp dating its generation and transaction data regarding
234940	236260	ownership of that block.
236260	239860	The ledger of the blockchain is available to all owners of a block via peer-to-peer
239860	243900	networking, the same basic tech as BitTorrent, ensuring that all people involved have the
243900	244900	same ledger.
244900	247180	P2P means that it's decentralized information.
247180	250740	If one person drops out, the ledger continues on through other users.
250740	255480	Because each block contains a record of previous blocks, it's also highly resistant to tampering.
255480	259700	New blocks in the chain are generated by mining, which is basically letting your computer run
259740	263860	algorithms to calculate the new data set for the next block, based on the hashes of all
263860	268120	the previous blocks nested within it, as glean from your copy of the blockchain ledger.
268120	272220	This means that as more blocks are generated, the more computational power it takes to generate
272220	276100	the next block, meaning that there is a level of scarcity regarding the theoretical number
276100	277100	of blocks.
277100	280540	This also means that all of those retards who spent hundreds of thousands of dollars
280540	285280	on GTX 1080s last year basically ruined their lives, because the more people who jumped
285280	289300	on the Bitcoin train, the costlier it became to actually mine the coins.
289300	292920	Using such rapid adoption of that technology, one of the many reasons that everyone who
292920	295980	kept their assets in Bitcoin lost everything.
295980	298480	But it's not just that a valid crypto has to be blockchain-based.
298480	302200	The second requirement is that it has to be freely traded at market value.
302200	305140	The price of Bitcoin fluctuates based on many factors.
305140	309080	The number of Bitcoins actually being bought and sold, the current number of miners as
309080	313280	I just mentioned, the current length of the blockchain, as well as various public trust
313280	319460	issues, like when CoinCheck got hacked and lost $530 million worth of its user's coin,
319460	324140	or when Facebook, Google, and Twitter decided to ban the use of crypto on their platforms.
324140	327620	And really, it's no surprise that Facebook banned the use of crypto back in March of
327620	330340	2018, if they were planning to make Libra all along.
330340	334720	John Todaro of TradeBlock has stated that Facebook's had Libra in the making for over
334720	338000	a year now, so of course they would go out of their way to ban their competition's
338000	339000	cryptos.
339000	341760	If it's tech-related and Silicon Valley can't control it, they will do anything
341760	342760	to stop it.
343240	348120	Libra, unlike actual cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, will not be traded at market value.
348120	352500	In CTV's article, A User Guide to Facebook's New Crypto, they write,
352500	357340	Bitcoin is known for its wide price fluctuations, but the price of Libra is expected to be more
357340	358340	stable.
358340	361960	That's because Libra's value will be pegged to established currencies like the Canadian
361960	363820	dollar, the US dollar, or the euro.
363820	367880	It will also be backed by a reserve fund, whereas Bitcoin is not.
367880	371840	Facebook hasn't said what assets that reserve fund will be made up of, but its white paper
371840	376400	suggests it will include bank deposits and government securities in currencies from stable
376400	378200	and reputable central banks.
378200	380960	And this is why Libra is not a true crypto.
380960	384920	Its price is artificially set by the holder of most of the Libra in existence, in this
384920	386100	case Facebook.
386100	390600	And unlike Bitcoin, which holds value because of the inherent rarity that blockchain technology
390600	395760	and mining for new coin provides, Libra holds value because of the backing of big banks.
395760	401120	The article also describes the Libra Association, which Facebook co-founded with Mastercard,
401120	406400	Visa, PayPal, and Uber, as well as like 20 other companies, acting as a monetary authority
406400	407640	to regulate Libra.
407640	410920	Who here is surprised to see Thrive Capital and Stripe on this list, considering their
410920	412800	involvement in the Patreon purge?
412800	413800	No?
413800	414800	No one?
414800	415800	Didn't think so.
415800	419960	I don't know about you, but to me, private companies creating their own currency that
419960	424680	they centrally control independent of market value and then also controlling the regulatory
424680	428720	body for that currency smells like an absolute disaster waiting to happen.
428720	434120	Oh, and by the way, this is why I was also partially wrong in my Is Dlive a Scam video,
434120	436760	guys, and I'm very sorry about my failure on that one.
436760	441160	Dlive does use blockchain technology, but it uses it in its stream encoding, not its
441160	442500	Lino currency.
442500	446920	Using blockchain on a stream or a video service means that content is unable to be edited
446920	452160	after publishing, making it a strong defense against false DMCA claims and censorious,
452160	454980	vaguely defined harassment and hate speech guidelines.
454980	460140	The Lino currency Dlive uses itself, despite being tracked on crypto trackers, is not actually
460140	461140	a crypto.
461140	464560	It's still a waste of your money, because when you buy Lino with real cash and donate
464560	467880	the Lino to a streamer, when the streamer withdraws the Lino they get less money than
467880	472340	you put into it, making Dlive's claim that they don't skim off the top complete BS.
472340	474300	But they're not as bad as I made it sound in the video.
474300	478700	As long as you're not actually dealing in Lino, Dlive's a fine platform to stream on.
478700	480140	Sorry guys, my bad.
480140	481140	Back to Libra though.
481140	485660	If cryptocurrencies require both blockchain technology to track ownership and prevent
485660	489780	fraud, as well as free trading on the open market in order to ensure the coin actually
489780	494820	has value to people and not just the authority pegging the price like with China's Yuan or
494820	500100	Venezuela's Bolivar, then the Libra cannot, by definition, be a true crypto.
500100	503900	Blockchain tech will keep it organized, but if Facebook centrally decides the value controls
503900	507300	the supply and regulates the practices, then it's not a free currency.
507300	510980	But beyond economic problems, there's also the problem of public trust.
510980	515620	For example, Sargon posted on his Facebook, neutrally, that our good friend Tommy R was
515620	520460	right on Muslim prison gangs in the UK, and Facebook deleted the post for hate speech.
520460	523460	Nothing hateful was present in the speech, but they did it anyway.
523460	528340	Facebook, like all other big social media platforms, routinely deletes, deplatforms,
528340	532160	and depersons individuals who disagree with radical leftist politics.
532160	535980	These are not the people we want in control of the online financial system.
535980	539900	card cards' heinous censorship of jihad watch and Patreon's purging of alternative
539900	541460	voices is bad enough.
541460	543020	This has to be opposed.
543020	547220	Hey, none of us are surprised that a group called Women's World Banking is in on this
547220	548220	garbage right?
548220	552220	In order to meet the needs of the nearly 1 billion women globally who lack access to
552220	556560	financial products and services, financial institutions need capital from gender lens
556560	560740	investors who understand that investing in women can provide both a social and financial
560740	561740	return.
561740	564540	In other words, it's completely fine to build the corporate dystopia, as long as our
564540	567700	authoritarian CEO overlords are feminists.
567700	571180	Considering how Silicon Valley is basically trying to sync up our entire lives with their
571180	575500	central servers, and their complete inability to maintain even a semblance of political
575500	580460	neutrality in their actions, I find it absolutely reprehensible that these companies subsist
580460	582460	on the teat of the American government.
582460	589060	Google, Microsoft, Facebook, Apple, and Amazon get $2 billion in data center tax breaks.
589060	590060	Economic benefit unclear.
590060	594000	Oh yeah, a lot of American states have been trying to court these companies for warehouses
594000	598360	and data centers, only to realize later that a lot of this stuff is automated and doesn't
598360	600000	actually bring any jobs with it.
600000	603400	While the number of construction jobs generated for each facility is comparable to building
603400	607800	a factory or distribution center, an operating data center creates an average of just 30-50
607800	608800	permanent jobs.
608800	614420	The incentive packages can be quite outlandish, far exceeding any reasonable economic justification,
614420	619060	said Todd L. Cherry, director of the Center for Economic Research and Policy Analysis
619060	620600	at Appalachian State University.
620600	622160	Hey, here's an idea.
622160	625520	If companies take government money and operate some type of a public square as part of their
625520	630300	business like Google, Facebook, and Twitter, maybe they should be legally required to protect
630300	634680	its users' first amendment rights, and if they fail to do so, they don't get the grants
634680	636280	they apply for.
636280	637280	Seems reasonable to me.
637280	640400	I mean, just look at how much money is being wasted.
640400	643600	Available over at the public subsidy tracker Good Jobs First.
643600	648920	According to these guys, Facebook has taken in $332 million in state subsidies.
648960	653300	$150 million came from the state of Utah to build a data center in Eagle Mountain, producing
653300	655560	an estimated 30-50 jobs.
655560	659560	Another $150 million from Texas this time to build a data center at Fort Worth, with
659560	662640	no tracked data regarding jobs created.
662640	664040	This is ridiculous.
664040	668680	Another argument against big tech censorship is the whole Marsh v. Alabama case.
668680	671600	And I know I've talked about it on this channel before, so bear with me.
671600	676700	The town of Chickasaw, Alabama in 1946 was a company town, meaning the entire town was
676700	679780	privately owned by the Gulf Shipbuilding Corporation.
679780	683720	Gulf built the town and everything in it to service its business needs.
683720	688060	Work facilities, houses for their workers, shops, and basic services, all provided by
688060	689060	the company.
689060	693820	So when Miss Marsh began distributing religious literature on the sidewalk, she was asked
693820	697700	to stop, and eventually arrested for trespassing when she refused.
697700	702060	Gulf's argument was that they owned the entire town, including places it normally considered
702060	706740	public property, like streets, and so they could restrict speech however they liked.
706740	711180	However, the court ruled in favor of Miss Marsh, stating that if a private entity holds
711180	715420	a monopoly on the public square, they are legally obligated to behave as if the government
715420	718660	would when it comes to the rule of law, including free speech rights.
718660	719940	And to me this makes sense.
719940	723540	If a murder were committed in Chickasaw, the state police would still handle the case.
723540	727860	It wouldn't be handed off to a private police force even though the entire town was privately
727860	728860	owned.
728860	732580	Another lesson we can extract from Marsh v. Alabama is that companies with a monopoly
732580	736980	must behave responsibly, or the government will step in and either regulate them or break
736980	737980	them up.
737980	741620	Oh, and would you look at that, big tech is getting regulated because they won't behave
741620	742620	properly.
742620	743780	Who could have seen this coming?
743780	747900	Because this one seems to be the video where I admit all of my mistakes, I also made an
747900	749980	error in publishers versus platforms.
749980	751740	A pretty big one, in fact.
751740	754480	But it's also an error that everyone under the sun makes.
754480	759160	Under section 230 of the Communications Act, there's actually no definition of publisher
759160	763960	or platform, and there's no legal impetus for a platform to behave impartially.
763960	768480	In fact, as it's laid out in the Tech Dirt article, it's one thing for trolls and grandstanding
768480	771920	politicians to get 230 wrong, but the press shouldn't help them.
771920	776480	The law was actually designed to incentivize companies to censor its users.
776480	781620	Section B4 directly says that one of the policy goals of the law is to remove disincentives
781620	785520	for the development and utilization of blocking and filtering technologies.
785520	790720	And more importantly, section C2 makes it clear that section 230's intent was to encourage
790720	794580	moderation by taking away liability for any moderation decisions.
794580	799140	No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be held liable on account of
799140	805100	any action voluntarily taken in good faith to restrict access to or availability of material
805100	810780	that the provider or user considers to be obscene, lewd, filthy, excessively violent,
810780	816060	harassing, or otherwise objectionable, whether or not such material is constitutionally protected.
816060	820420	In short, if a site decides to remove content that it believes is objectionable, including
820420	824620	content it finds to be harassing, there is no liability for the platform even if the
824620	827140	content blocked is constitutionally protected.
827140	828780	So yeah, we all got that wrong.
828780	833560	230 is designed to give companies a cover for censorship, not designed to prevent it.
833560	838620	In Professor Jeff Kosseff's book, The 26 Words That Created the Internet, a book documenting
838620	842560	the history of section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, it's written that the government
842560	849560	was spurred to act by the court case Stratton Oakmont, Inc. v. Prodigy Services Co., 1995.
849560	853780	In this case, the court ruled that online service providers could be held liable for
853780	855140	the speech of their users.
855140	859580	The court decided that because Prodigy provided content guidelines for users, enforced those
859580	863980	rules with moderators, and used the basic software of the time to automatically regulate
863980	868060	speech through word filtering, that Prodigy was making an active effort to be responsible
868060	872620	for the speech on its platform, and therefore was legally liable for the speech not caught
872620	873620	by them.
873620	876860	This court ruling, on its own, would have set a precedent forcing Facebook and Twitter
876860	881320	and the like to either not moderate anything or be liable for anything they miss.
881320	884340	But this wasn't the only ruling influencing this situation.
884340	889380	Professor Kosseff also talks about Cubby, Inc. v. CompuServe, Inc., 1991, a ruling in
889380	894060	which Cubby sued CompuServe for defamation because CompuServe's users were posting
894060	895780	negative content about Cubby.
895780	900100	Cubby's position was that CompuServe was liable for the content posted using its service,
900100	903740	and CompuServe's position was that it was not liable because it was a distributor and
903740	904740	not a publisher.
904740	909440	The court ruled that, as a distributor, CompuServe could only be held liable if it knew about
909440	914500	the content, but because CompuServe did not regulate its forms at all, it was not liable.
914500	918780	These two rulings, put together, created a problem for the burgeoning mid-90s internet.
918780	922380	Cubby v. CompuServe ruled that distributors of content who don't regulate what they
922380	926340	distribute aren't liable for the content specifically if they have no knowledge of
926340	927540	the content's existence.
927540	931980	Oakmont v. Prodigy ruled that any attempt to moderate an online community, even good
931980	936460	faith attempts, rendered the company legally liable for all content unmoderated.
936460	938760	This left the internet in a serious bind.
938760	942680	Companies had to either take responsibility for everything on their platform, a daunting
942680	946680	task with today's technology, let alone back in the 90s, or they had to willfully
946680	950220	blind themselves to their own service, to the point that companies weren't willing
950220	954840	to risk even benign forms of knowledge about what they themselves were actually doing.
954840	959620	This chilling effect caused a lot of companies who fashioned themselves as impartial distributors,
959620	963440	like CompuServe, to refuse to collect metrics about their users for the sole purpose of
963440	967420	offering a better product, like asking, how would you like to see our service improve
967420	968420	polls or something.
968420	972220	It also prevented them from policing content for legitimate and heinous breaches of the
972220	974280	law, like child pornography distribution.
974280	978220	It would have also made online shopping impossible had it existed back then due to the nature
978220	981640	of collecting relevant data from users in order to make a purchase.
981640	985260	If you want to know why mid-90s internet sucks so much, this is a big reason.
985260	989580	These companies were forced to keep themselves in the dark about their own practices.
989580	992120	Section 230 was, therefore, a compromise.
992120	996280	Rather than be responsible for everything if you curate, or force yourself to be blind
996280	1000340	if you don't, it allowed internet companies to observe their users' behaviors while
1000340	1002700	not making them liable for those behaviors.
1002700	1006460	This was a groundbreaking decision that allowed the internet to flourish into what it is today.
1006500	1009820	230 gave internet companies the ability to regulate their users' content without being
1009820	1013700	liable for it, something that the early internet needed in order to survive.
1013700	1017460	And that's completely at odds with the public perception of 230 as the publisher versus
1017460	1020660	platform dichotomy, which has no actual basis in the law.
1020660	1025460	However, the internet has changed since 1996, and nowadays 230's protections are being
1025460	1028060	used to censor people out of the internet public square.
1028060	1030340	Thankfully, we're not the only ones who have clued into this.
1030340	1034660	Senator Josh Hawley is working on the Ending Support for Internet Censorship Act, which
1034660	1039900	modifies Section 230 to basically include the publisher versus platform thing that we
1039900	1041740	all thought I already had built into it.
1041740	1045560	Hawley's bill would task the Federal Trade Commission with certifying that tech companies
1045560	1049980	are approaching moderation in a neutral way, a requirement for any company with over 30
1049980	1055420	million monthly active users in the US, 300 million monthly active users globally, or
1055420	1058740	$500 million in global revenue.
1058740	1063060	Certification would require a supermajority vote, including at least one minority member,
1063060	1064860	and would occur every two years.
1064860	1069620	If a company over that threshold could not be certified, it would lose its Section 230
1069620	1072820	protections and be subject to intermediary liability litigation.
1072820	1078020	So basically, if the FTC determined that Facebook or any of the others is biased in moderation,
1078020	1081860	then 230 protections no longer apply, and they can be held liable for all the legally
1081860	1083900	dubious content on their platforms.
1083900	1087060	Can you imagine if Facebook is held liable for Christchurch?
1087060	1090380	Or for any of the millions of defamatory posts on its platform?
1090380	1091860	They get sued into oblivion.
1091860	1094580	But check out Big Tech's objection to this regulation.
1094580	1098560	The Internet Association, which counts Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube as members, describe
1098560	1100780	the legislation as misguided and destructive.
1100780	1105260	230 is the law that allows online companies to moderate and remove content that no reasonable
1105260	1106580	person wants online.
1106580	1108660	You just don't get it, do you?
1108660	1111420	You are not the arbiter of what is reasonable.
1111420	1115900	This bill forces platforms to make an impossible choice, either host reprehensible but First
1115900	1120140	Amendment protected speech, or lose legal protections that allow them to moderate illegal
1120140	1121140	content.
1121420	1123820	If this is First Amendment protected, you should not be stepping in.
1123820	1128420	You're forcing your definition of what is reprehensible onto everyone else.
1128420	1131740	Like it's, say, an axiomatic presupposition.
1131740	1135100	There's multiple angles we can take to stop Big Tech.
1135100	1136580	Changing 230 is one.
1136580	1140120	Marsh v Alabama and designating an online public square is another.
1140120	1143980	An Internet Bill of Rights declaring online accounts to be property and use of communication
1143980	1146020	services to be a right is another.
1146020	1149780	Pulling government funding for Big Tech that refuses to uphold the First Amendment is yet
1149780	1150780	another.
1151420	1154020	I started this video with Libra and ended it on free speech, but that's because they're
1154020	1155020	all related.
1155020	1158520	We've seen how poorly these people and these companies treat speech.
1158520	1162980	They will treat money the exact same way, if we don't oppose this here and now.
1162980	1166340	I don't trust Facebook with my money just like I don't trust them with my data and
1166340	1167340	with my speech.
1167340	1170780	I don't want to live in a future where I can't pay my bills because I said a naughty
1170780	1171780	word on the internet.
1175780	1177780	Oh, also?
1177780	1179780	Libra doesn't even work.
1180780	1182780	I don't trust Facebook with my money just like I don't trust them with my speech.
