0	4600	Hello my friends, before we get into it, I want to thank everyone who subbed recently.
4600	8800	Thanks to my previous Learn to Code video, this channel went through some pretty amazing
8800	11440	growth this past week, and it's all thanks to you.
11440	15560	I figure it's a good idea to make a follow-up video, not just to take advantage of the situation,
15560	16560	although there is that.
16560	20880	But also because, like my Mega Kids follow-up yesterday, a lot of new developments have
20880	22360	happened on the topic.
22360	23360	Like this!
23360	25640	This was posted only a couple hours before recording this video.
25640	29440	Vice Media to reorganize lay off 10% of staff.
29440	33880	You know, that exclusive tag right in the headline really makes me feel like the author
33880	39040	of the article is hoping and praying that these layoffs are exclusive to Vice and won't
39040	40520	be coming to his outlet too.
40520	46200	The cuts, which will impact around 250 people, are part of new CEO Nancy DeBuck's strategic
46200	49040	plan to tighten spending and achieve profitability.
49040	51300	Oh, so Vice wasn't profitable?
51300	54120	Who could have known with such quality reporting as this?
54400	59640	Vice Media is planning a reorganization that will include laying off about 10% of its workforce,
59640	64980	as the once high-flying startup looks to rein in an unwieldy business that grew quickly
64980	66880	during the height of the digital boom.
66880	70860	Well, digital markets are still growing, I'd say even still booming.
70860	75360	So I don't think Vice's problem is the market, I think Vice's problem is Vice.
75360	79800	One of the new CEO's first projects was setting a plan that would bring order to the chaos
79800	84220	that was created during the years when Vice transformed from a Montreal punk magazine
84220	85880	to a global media organization.
85880	90640	Yeah, I know about Third Wave Feminism's obsession with the zine format, it really
90640	93240	does sound like Vice was doomed from the start.
93240	94940	But today, it's Vice.
94940	97720	Just like how it was Buzzfeed and HuffPo last week.
97720	102360	And the brainlets over at Vice are having the same dumb reactions as the brainlets over
102360	103960	at Buzzfeed and HuffPo.
103960	109760	Here's Vice's social editor with, I cannot emphasize this enough, unionize your workplace.
109800	114800	Followed up with, just to clarify, I don't know anything about myself yet, but appreciate
114800	116000	everyone reaching out.
116000	120000	Well, with a statement like that, if you weren't on the chopping block before, you are now.
120000	124460	I'm not anti-union by any stretch of the imagination, but I do recognize that unions
124460	129600	are going to cause more trouble, not less, in a failing business or disappearing market.
129600	132680	These people don't get that, because their worldview is simplistic.
132680	136960	Their bosses have a sum of money characterized as a lot, and they should be forced to fork
136960	139120	it over in exchange for subpar writing.
139120	140120	And that's that.
140120	144200	Anonymous trolls tweeting in glee about Vice layoffs are absolute cowards.
144200	146360	And I'm not just talking about alt-right idiots.
146360	149900	Your problems with this company and its executives should not be directed at low-level workers
149900	151000	just trying to make a living.
151000	152600	Oh, is that the new standard?
152600	156640	That we shouldn't be laughing at people who get shit-canned after years of not only
156640	160920	doing their jobs poorly, but using their positions to laugh at people themselves?
160920	163040	Not just laugh, but harass people?
163040	165800	Not just harass people, but attempt to get them fucking fired?
165800	167880	They are workers who do not deserve this cruelty.
167880	170160	No, on some level this is the bed they made.
170160	172620	I just want this point to be crystal clear.
172620	176960	The journalists who, for the past decade, have weaponized their platforms in attempts
176960	181040	to get others removed from their careers, projects, and positions for their political
181040	185920	beliefs, are now calling foul because the average person, the pleb, is having a chuckle
185920	189960	at them losing their jobs due to their political beliefs not being profitable.
189960	191280	I'm okay with this.
191280	195960	Here's a ridiculous conspiracy theory as to what Learn to Code actually means.
195960	200360	The trolls are using Learn to Code as an outer narrative, a collectively agreed-upon
200360	205280	bad-faith argument that is internally understood as such, to provide cover for their true agenda.
205280	210200	No, no, the truth is you're all unlikeable assholes and people enjoy laughing at you
210200	211200	when you fail.
211200	215080	The everyman is always going to rejoice when the bully finally gets his comeuppance.
215080	219280	Zoe Beery at Study Hall asked me why Learn to Code is such an effective meme.
219280	223800	It's an ingenious cover story of highlighting journalistic softness with Learn to Code,
223800	225800	then expected cruelty underneath.
225800	229800	They kind of beta tested this with a thing called the NPC meme that didn't catch on
229800	231880	because it only made sense to gamers.
231880	236620	They realized picking on journalists who recently lost their jobs, while knowing full well some
236620	240040	of them are sending threats alongside it, has been an effective trolling strategy to
240040	241800	make them feel twice the pain.
241800	243000	Send threats.
243000	246720	Send a pointless Learn to Code campaign on top as a cover story.
246720	249240	Point to the cover story to make journalists appear soft.
249240	253440	Well, let me state right now, if you're actually sending threats to journalists, don't
253440	254440	do that.
254440	256860	If you're trying to laugh at them, it's not okay to threaten them.
256860	260340	But I have a feeling that the journalists actually are soft, to the point that they're
260340	263160	taking things that are clearly not threatening as threats.
263160	264800	Here's an example.
264800	268000	Parker Malloy here is actually taking this as a threat.
268000	270360	It's threatening imagery, to use her own words.
270360	274680	You would have to be a soft lefty journo to actually feel threatened by this.
274680	278440	You can taunt journalists with Learn to Code all you want, but you can't run from the
278440	282360	fact that if you switch jobs for six months, the journalist would be better coders than
282360	283360	you would be at journalism.
283600	285440	I don't know about this one, Caitlin.
285440	288720	Coders might have an advantage in journalism because they will have learned the difference
288720	292560	between true and false from day one, while a lot of journalists going into code still
292560	293620	haven't figured it out.
293620	298060	To all journalists being marauded, hold the line, don't give an inch to these trolls.
298060	301480	Learn to Code is a threat to silence journalists via violence.
301480	302480	Really?
302480	303480	Violence?
303480	306340	When journos are spoon fed back their own narrative.
306340	310380	Were journalists themselves being violent when they told minors to Learn to Code?
310380	314900	Was CNN being violent when it published an article stating that they had the docs of
314900	319240	reddit user Han asshole solo and that they would publish it if he didn't delete and
319240	323100	apologize for this gif of Trump disrespecting CNN?
323100	327640	It's almost like these elitist fucks feel like they should have the monopoly on violence
327640	328860	and not the state.
328860	334300	The twitter account NazisNotWelcome decided to tweet out, we will not tolerate your fascist
334300	335940	attacks on the press.
335940	336940	Not for a minute.
336940	339180	Stop attacking journalists immediately.
339180	344820	Yep, making fun of shitty people losing their jobs after years of hurling abuse is fascism
344820	345820	now.
345820	349900	I am not surprised that an antifa commie, somebody who wants everyone and everything
349900	354220	to be equalized and redistributed, would take great offense at the laughter of the common
354220	356980	people finding joy in a tyrant's fall.
356980	361860	In any case, the Learn to Code meme took off hard, despite the best efforts of the radical
361860	366500	left, so twitter staff decided to make the phrase Learn to Code hate speech.
366500	367500	Yes?
367500	368500	Really?
368820	373340	I am told by a person in the know that tweeting Learn to Code at any recently laid off journalist
373340	377900	will be treated as abusive behavior and is a violation of twitter's terms of service.
377900	381220	I swear to god, lefty journals are made of fucking Play-Doh.
381220	386180	Of course, even twitter realized how retarded that sounds because they issued a clarification.
386180	388700	It's more nuanced than what you reported.
388700	393540	Twitter is responding to a targeted harassment campaign against specific individuals, a policy
393540	395460	that's long been against twitter rules.
395460	397980	Oh, okay, okay, I get it.
397980	401700	Fine, a targeted harassment campaign against specific individuals.
401700	406240	Like all the SJWs threatening and doxing the MAGA kids from Covington Catholic High School
406240	407680	last week, right?
407680	411540	That seems to be a targeted harassment campaign against specific individuals.
411540	413540	When are they getting their bans, Jack?
413540	415960	Or is that one just not important enough?
415960	420540	Does that have to go on the back burner because latte-sipping communist activists, calling
420540	423780	themselves journalists, are taking some flak on the internet?
423780	427580	Twitter meltdowns are fun and all, but let's turn our attention to the core of the matter.
427580	432180	Yes, Vice's CEO has stated that the layoffs will touch all departments at every level,
432180	434520	which means saying goodbye to some colleagues.
434520	436420	But who exactly is going to get fired?
436420	437980	As of this recording, I don't know.
437980	440980	Maybe by the time the video is out, names will be floating around.
440980	442340	But let me make a prediction.
442340	447500	I think Vice is going to follow the lead of Buzzfeed and lay off primarily people of color
447500	449500	and LGBT employees.
449500	451660	Huh, funny how that works.
451660	457160	Among these minority, ethnic, and LGBTQ former staff are some well-known figures within Asian
457740	458740	American communities.
458740	464240	These writers and producers have frequently created content on race, culture, mental health,
464240	466720	and issues facing the LGBTQ community.
466720	469260	Well, maybe that's why they were laid off.
469260	474200	Their work was overwhelmingly devoid of value and was the exact type of thing that Buzzfeed
474200	475960	was crumbling under the weight of.
475960	479680	Maybe it's because they were diversity hires with lesser qualifications, experience, or
479680	484280	quality, and when it came time to trim the fat, the least talented people had to go regardless
484280	485420	of skin color.
485420	489380	Maybe it's because Buzzfeed decided to let go of the people producing the most politically
489380	495100	agitating content, the blame-white-men-for-everything garbage, and it just happened to be that minorities
495100	496720	were putting out most of that junk.
496720	501780	In other words, if you're not hired for your competence, expect to get fired for your
501780	503060	incompetence.
503060	506860	These people talk about racism and sexism as if they're moral paragons.
506860	511180	The honest truth is, they've simply substituted one form of bigotry for another.
511180	513900	They still have a very robust in-group preference.
513900	519940	The difference is, their in-group is not my race or my nationality, it's fellow journalists
519940	521500	and fellow radical lefties.
521500	525820	It's not even the working class or the poor as they like to claim it is.
525820	529940	Their reactions to workers affected by America's dying industries proves that.
529940	532020	When it was coal miners, it was learn to code.
532020	535740	When it was journalists, capitalism is evil and democracy is crumbling.
535740	538460	It's not hard to figure out who they actually care for.
538460	541460	There's still one final lingering question, though.
541460	543220	Why is this all happening now?
543220	547020	Why are all these people getting laid off within days of each other from a bunch of
547020	548500	different progressive outlets?
548500	554140	Well, back in March of 2016, the Countering Foreign Propaganda and Disinformation Act
554140	555140	was written.
555140	560540	It hit the table in May 2016, made it through the House vote on December 2nd, 2016, and
560540	562660	the Senate vote on December 8th.
562660	568140	President Obama signed it into law on December 23rd as a part of 2017's National Defense
568140	569660	Authorization Act.
569660	576440	The Countering Foreign Propaganda and Disinformation Act set aside $160 million for use in countering
576440	577780	foreign propaganda.
577780	581620	Ron Portman, one of the senators that helped write the act, stated that,
581620	586320	Our enemies are using foreign propaganda and disinformation against us and our allies.
586320	590080	And so far the U.S. government has been asleep at the wheel, but today the United States
590080	595640	has taken a critical step towards confronting the extensive and destabilizing foreign propaganda
595640	600520	and disinformation operations being waged against us by our enemies overseas.
600520	602880	The Act outlines two priorities.
602880	607240	The first is countering foreign propaganda, and it explicitly names Russia and China,
607240	611160	as well as various non-state actors, as the Act's targets.
611160	616880	The second priority, though, establishes a fund to help train local journalists and provides
616880	623960	grants and contracts to non-government organizations, civil society organizations, think tanks,
623960	630560	private sector companies, media organizations, and other experts outside the U.S. government
630560	636480	with experience in identifying and analyzing the latest trends in foreign government disinformation
636480	637480	techniques.
637480	642180	The Act expired exactly two years later, December 23rd, 2018.
642180	647160	Within a month of that date, multiple radical progressive news organizations, from BuzzFeed
647160	653320	to HuffPo to Vice, began implementing layoffs and cutbacks, citing a lack of funding and
653320	655440	a need to downsize as the reasoning.
655440	657280	Yeah, you heard all of that right.
657280	661580	I think what happened here, and this is just my guess, is that the Obama administration
661580	666560	decided to empower radical progressives within the media in order to push a cultural, social,
666560	671440	and political narrative, with the now overused excuse of Russian interference.
671440	675880	And when the money finally ran out, those same activists that were brought on to turn
675880	681120	the media into an absolute nightmare circus of incompetence and mouth-frothing ignorance
681120	684360	back in 2016 were finally shown the door.
684360	689120	Let's hope that this event finally signals the death of the media's cult-like behavior
689120	693480	now that all of these laughing stocks have been cast out into the streets, into the cold,
693480	697160	harsh reality that the people they claim to advocate for know all too well.
697160	699000	But hey, it's not all bad.
699000	702880	You people think there's a massive gender and race disparity in tech, right?
702880	705560	Well, now's your chance to correct it.
705560	706680	Learn to code.
706680	710280	Let's say you spent 30 years making a solid middle class living in a paper mill in northern
710320	711520	New Hampshire.
711520	714920	Then one day the mill shuts down, sold for scrap to China.
714920	715920	Happened a lot.
715920	716920	But no problem.
716920	717920	Just learn to code.
717920	719240	Everyone in Brooklyn's doing it.
719240	723940	Well, coding was never a real solution to any of this, obviously, but it had the effect
723940	728080	of making journalists feel even more self-satisfied, and of course that was the point.
728080	730320	It's always the point, actually.
730320	732280	Fast forward to this month.
732280	735640	Someone on Twitter came up with a pretty brilliant piece of advice for all those laid-off journalists
735640	738280	trying to figure out what to do with their lives.
738280	740160	Learn to code.
740160	740480	Perfect.
