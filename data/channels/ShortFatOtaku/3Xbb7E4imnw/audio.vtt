00:00.000 --> 00:04.600
Hello my friends, before we get into it, I want to thank everyone who subbed recently.

00:04.600 --> 00:08.800
Thanks to my previous Learn to Code video, this channel went through some pretty amazing

00:08.800 --> 00:11.440
growth this past week, and it's all thanks to you.

00:11.440 --> 00:15.560
I figure it's a good idea to make a follow-up video, not just to take advantage of the situation,

00:15.560 --> 00:16.560
although there is that.

00:16.560 --> 00:20.880
But also because, like my Mega Kids follow-up yesterday, a lot of new developments have

00:20.880 --> 00:22.360
happened on the topic.

00:22.360 --> 00:23.360
Like this!

00:23.360 --> 00:25.640
This was posted only a couple hours before recording this video.

00:25.640 --> 00:29.440
Vice Media to reorganize lay off 10% of staff.

00:29.440 --> 00:33.880
You know, that exclusive tag right in the headline really makes me feel like the author

00:33.880 --> 00:39.040
of the article is hoping and praying that these layoffs are exclusive to Vice and won't

00:39.040 --> 00:40.520
be coming to his outlet too.

00:40.520 --> 00:46.200
The cuts, which will impact around 250 people, are part of new CEO Nancy DeBuck's strategic

00:46.200 --> 00:49.040
plan to tighten spending and achieve profitability.

00:49.040 --> 00:51.300
Oh, so Vice wasn't profitable?

00:51.300 --> 00:54.120
Who could have known with such quality reporting as this?

00:54.400 --> 00:59.640
Vice Media is planning a reorganization that will include laying off about 10% of its workforce,

00:59.640 --> 01:04.980
as the once high-flying startup looks to rein in an unwieldy business that grew quickly

01:04.980 --> 01:06.880
during the height of the digital boom.

01:06.880 --> 01:10.860
Well, digital markets are still growing, I'd say even still booming.

01:10.860 --> 01:15.360
So I don't think Vice's problem is the market, I think Vice's problem is Vice.

01:15.360 --> 01:19.800
One of the new CEO's first projects was setting a plan that would bring order to the chaos

01:19.800 --> 01:24.220
that was created during the years when Vice transformed from a Montreal punk magazine

01:24.220 --> 01:25.880
to a global media organization.

01:25.880 --> 01:30.640
Yeah, I know about Third Wave Feminism's obsession with the zine format, it really

01:30.640 --> 01:33.240
does sound like Vice was doomed from the start.

01:33.240 --> 01:34.940
But today, it's Vice.

01:34.940 --> 01:37.720
Just like how it was Buzzfeed and HuffPo last week.

01:37.720 --> 01:42.360
And the brainlets over at Vice are having the same dumb reactions as the brainlets over

01:42.360 --> 01:43.960
at Buzzfeed and HuffPo.

01:43.960 --> 01:49.760
Here's Vice's social editor with, I cannot emphasize this enough, unionize your workplace.

01:49.800 --> 01:54.800
Followed up with, just to clarify, I don't know anything about myself yet, but appreciate

01:54.800 --> 01:56.000
everyone reaching out.

01:56.000 --> 02:00.000
Well, with a statement like that, if you weren't on the chopping block before, you are now.

02:00.000 --> 02:04.460
I'm not anti-union by any stretch of the imagination, but I do recognize that unions

02:04.460 --> 02:09.600
are going to cause more trouble, not less, in a failing business or disappearing market.

02:09.600 --> 02:12.680
These people don't get that, because their worldview is simplistic.

02:12.680 --> 02:16.960
Their bosses have a sum of money characterized as a lot, and they should be forced to fork

02:16.960 --> 02:19.120
it over in exchange for subpar writing.

02:19.120 --> 02:20.120
And that's that.

02:20.120 --> 02:24.200
Anonymous trolls tweeting in glee about Vice layoffs are absolute cowards.

02:24.200 --> 02:26.360
And I'm not just talking about alt-right idiots.

02:26.360 --> 02:29.900
Your problems with this company and its executives should not be directed at low-level workers

02:29.900 --> 02:31.000
just trying to make a living.

02:31.000 --> 02:32.600
Oh, is that the new standard?

02:32.600 --> 02:36.640
That we shouldn't be laughing at people who get shit-canned after years of not only

02:36.640 --> 02:40.920
doing their jobs poorly, but using their positions to laugh at people themselves?

02:40.920 --> 02:43.040
Not just laugh, but harass people?

02:43.040 --> 02:45.800
Not just harass people, but attempt to get them fucking fired?

02:45.800 --> 02:47.880
They are workers who do not deserve this cruelty.

02:47.880 --> 02:50.160
No, on some level this is the bed they made.

02:50.160 --> 02:52.620
I just want this point to be crystal clear.

02:52.620 --> 02:56.960
The journalists who, for the past decade, have weaponized their platforms in attempts

02:56.960 --> 03:01.040
to get others removed from their careers, projects, and positions for their political

03:01.040 --> 03:05.920
beliefs, are now calling foul because the average person, the pleb, is having a chuckle

03:05.920 --> 03:09.960
at them losing their jobs due to their political beliefs not being profitable.

03:09.960 --> 03:11.280
I'm okay with this.

03:11.280 --> 03:15.960
Here's a ridiculous conspiracy theory as to what Learn to Code actually means.

03:15.960 --> 03:20.360
The trolls are using Learn to Code as an outer narrative, a collectively agreed-upon

03:20.360 --> 03:25.280
bad-faith argument that is internally understood as such, to provide cover for their true agenda.

03:25.280 --> 03:30.200
No, no, the truth is you're all unlikeable assholes and people enjoy laughing at you

03:30.200 --> 03:31.200
when you fail.

03:31.200 --> 03:35.080
The everyman is always going to rejoice when the bully finally gets his comeuppance.

03:35.080 --> 03:39.280
Zoe Beery at Study Hall asked me why Learn to Code is such an effective meme.

03:39.280 --> 03:43.800
It's an ingenious cover story of highlighting journalistic softness with Learn to Code,

03:43.800 --> 03:45.800
then expected cruelty underneath.

03:45.800 --> 03:49.800
They kind of beta tested this with a thing called the NPC meme that didn't catch on

03:49.800 --> 03:51.880
because it only made sense to gamers.

03:51.880 --> 03:56.620
They realized picking on journalists who recently lost their jobs, while knowing full well some

03:56.620 --> 04:00.040
of them are sending threats alongside it, has been an effective trolling strategy to

04:00.040 --> 04:01.800
make them feel twice the pain.

04:01.800 --> 04:03.000
Send threats.

04:03.000 --> 04:06.720
Send a pointless Learn to Code campaign on top as a cover story.

04:06.720 --> 04:09.240
Point to the cover story to make journalists appear soft.

04:09.240 --> 04:13.440
Well, let me state right now, if you're actually sending threats to journalists, don't

04:13.440 --> 04:14.440
do that.

04:14.440 --> 04:16.860
If you're trying to laugh at them, it's not okay to threaten them.

04:16.860 --> 04:20.340
But I have a feeling that the journalists actually are soft, to the point that they're

04:20.340 --> 04:23.160
taking things that are clearly not threatening as threats.

04:23.160 --> 04:24.800
Here's an example.

04:24.800 --> 04:28.000
Parker Malloy here is actually taking this as a threat.

04:28.000 --> 04:30.360
It's threatening imagery, to use her own words.

04:30.360 --> 04:34.680
You would have to be a soft lefty journo to actually feel threatened by this.

04:34.680 --> 04:38.440
You can taunt journalists with Learn to Code all you want, but you can't run from the

04:38.440 --> 04:42.360
fact that if you switch jobs for six months, the journalist would be better coders than

04:42.360 --> 04:43.360
you would be at journalism.

04:43.600 --> 04:45.440
I don't know about this one, Caitlin.

04:45.440 --> 04:48.720
Coders might have an advantage in journalism because they will have learned the difference

04:48.720 --> 04:52.560
between true and false from day one, while a lot of journalists going into code still

04:52.560 --> 04:53.620
haven't figured it out.

04:53.620 --> 04:58.060
To all journalists being marauded, hold the line, don't give an inch to these trolls.

04:58.060 --> 05:01.480
Learn to Code is a threat to silence journalists via violence.

05:01.480 --> 05:02.480
Really?

05:02.480 --> 05:03.480
Violence?

05:03.480 --> 05:06.340
When journos are spoon fed back their own narrative.

05:06.340 --> 05:10.380
Were journalists themselves being violent when they told minors to Learn to Code?

05:10.380 --> 05:14.900
Was CNN being violent when it published an article stating that they had the docs of

05:14.900 --> 05:19.240
reddit user Han asshole solo and that they would publish it if he didn't delete and

05:19.240 --> 05:23.100
apologize for this gif of Trump disrespecting CNN?

05:23.100 --> 05:27.640
It's almost like these elitist fucks feel like they should have the monopoly on violence

05:27.640 --> 05:28.860
and not the state.

05:28.860 --> 05:34.300
The twitter account NazisNotWelcome decided to tweet out, we will not tolerate your fascist

05:34.300 --> 05:35.940
attacks on the press.

05:35.940 --> 05:36.940
Not for a minute.

05:36.940 --> 05:39.180
Stop attacking journalists immediately.

05:39.180 --> 05:44.820
Yep, making fun of shitty people losing their jobs after years of hurling abuse is fascism

05:44.820 --> 05:45.820
now.

05:45.820 --> 05:49.900
I am not surprised that an antifa commie, somebody who wants everyone and everything

05:49.900 --> 05:54.220
to be equalized and redistributed, would take great offense at the laughter of the common

05:54.220 --> 05:56.980
people finding joy in a tyrant's fall.

05:56.980 --> 06:01.860
In any case, the Learn to Code meme took off hard, despite the best efforts of the radical

06:01.860 --> 06:06.500
left, so twitter staff decided to make the phrase Learn to Code hate speech.

06:06.500 --> 06:07.500
Yes?

06:07.500 --> 06:08.500
Really?

06:08.820 --> 06:13.340
I am told by a person in the know that tweeting Learn to Code at any recently laid off journalist

06:13.340 --> 06:17.900
will be treated as abusive behavior and is a violation of twitter's terms of service.

06:17.900 --> 06:21.220
I swear to god, lefty journals are made of fucking Play-Doh.

06:21.220 --> 06:26.180
Of course, even twitter realized how retarded that sounds because they issued a clarification.

06:26.180 --> 06:28.700
It's more nuanced than what you reported.

06:28.700 --> 06:33.540
Twitter is responding to a targeted harassment campaign against specific individuals, a policy

06:33.540 --> 06:35.460
that's long been against twitter rules.

06:35.460 --> 06:37.980
Oh, okay, okay, I get it.

06:37.980 --> 06:41.700
Fine, a targeted harassment campaign against specific individuals.

06:41.700 --> 06:46.240
Like all the SJWs threatening and doxing the MAGA kids from Covington Catholic High School

06:46.240 --> 06:47.680
last week, right?

06:47.680 --> 06:51.540
That seems to be a targeted harassment campaign against specific individuals.

06:51.540 --> 06:53.540
When are they getting their bans, Jack?

06:53.540 --> 06:55.960
Or is that one just not important enough?

06:55.960 --> 07:00.540
Does that have to go on the back burner because latte-sipping communist activists, calling

07:00.540 --> 07:03.780
themselves journalists, are taking some flak on the internet?

07:03.780 --> 07:07.580
Twitter meltdowns are fun and all, but let's turn our attention to the core of the matter.

07:07.580 --> 07:12.180
Yes, Vice's CEO has stated that the layoffs will touch all departments at every level,

07:12.180 --> 07:14.520
which means saying goodbye to some colleagues.

07:14.520 --> 07:16.420
But who exactly is going to get fired?

07:16.420 --> 07:17.980
As of this recording, I don't know.

07:17.980 --> 07:20.980
Maybe by the time the video is out, names will be floating around.

07:20.980 --> 07:22.340
But let me make a prediction.

07:22.340 --> 07:27.500
I think Vice is going to follow the lead of Buzzfeed and lay off primarily people of color

07:27.500 --> 07:29.500
and LGBT employees.

07:29.500 --> 07:31.660
Huh, funny how that works.

07:31.660 --> 07:37.160
Among these minority, ethnic, and LGBTQ former staff are some well-known figures within Asian

07:37.740 --> 07:38.740
American communities.

07:38.740 --> 07:44.240
These writers and producers have frequently created content on race, culture, mental health,

07:44.240 --> 07:46.720
and issues facing the LGBTQ community.

07:46.720 --> 07:49.260
Well, maybe that's why they were laid off.

07:49.260 --> 07:54.200
Their work was overwhelmingly devoid of value and was the exact type of thing that Buzzfeed

07:54.200 --> 07:55.960
was crumbling under the weight of.

07:55.960 --> 07:59.680
Maybe it's because they were diversity hires with lesser qualifications, experience, or

07:59.680 --> 08:04.280
quality, and when it came time to trim the fat, the least talented people had to go regardless

08:04.280 --> 08:05.420
of skin color.

08:05.420 --> 08:09.380
Maybe it's because Buzzfeed decided to let go of the people producing the most politically

08:09.380 --> 08:15.100
agitating content, the blame-white-men-for-everything garbage, and it just happened to be that minorities

08:15.100 --> 08:16.720
were putting out most of that junk.

08:16.720 --> 08:21.780
In other words, if you're not hired for your competence, expect to get fired for your

08:21.780 --> 08:23.060
incompetence.

08:23.060 --> 08:26.860
These people talk about racism and sexism as if they're moral paragons.

08:26.860 --> 08:31.180
The honest truth is, they've simply substituted one form of bigotry for another.

08:31.180 --> 08:33.900
They still have a very robust in-group preference.

08:33.900 --> 08:39.940
The difference is, their in-group is not my race or my nationality, it's fellow journalists

08:39.940 --> 08:41.500
and fellow radical lefties.

08:41.500 --> 08:45.820
It's not even the working class or the poor as they like to claim it is.

08:45.820 --> 08:49.940
Their reactions to workers affected by America's dying industries proves that.

08:49.940 --> 08:52.020
When it was coal miners, it was learn to code.

08:52.020 --> 08:55.740
When it was journalists, capitalism is evil and democracy is crumbling.

08:55.740 --> 08:58.460
It's not hard to figure out who they actually care for.

08:58.460 --> 09:01.460
There's still one final lingering question, though.

09:01.460 --> 09:03.220
Why is this all happening now?

09:03.220 --> 09:07.020
Why are all these people getting laid off within days of each other from a bunch of

09:07.020 --> 09:08.500
different progressive outlets?

09:08.500 --> 09:14.140
Well, back in March of 2016, the Countering Foreign Propaganda and Disinformation Act

09:14.140 --> 09:15.140
was written.

09:15.140 --> 09:20.540
It hit the table in May 2016, made it through the House vote on December 2nd, 2016, and

09:20.540 --> 09:22.660
the Senate vote on December 8th.

09:22.660 --> 09:28.140
President Obama signed it into law on December 23rd as a part of 2017's National Defense

09:28.140 --> 09:29.660
Authorization Act.

09:29.660 --> 09:36.440
The Countering Foreign Propaganda and Disinformation Act set aside $160 million for use in countering

09:36.440 --> 09:37.780
foreign propaganda.

09:37.780 --> 09:41.620
Ron Portman, one of the senators that helped write the act, stated that,

09:41.620 --> 09:46.320
Our enemies are using foreign propaganda and disinformation against us and our allies.

09:46.320 --> 09:50.080
And so far the U.S. government has been asleep at the wheel, but today the United States

09:50.080 --> 09:55.640
has taken a critical step towards confronting the extensive and destabilizing foreign propaganda

09:55.640 --> 10:00.520
and disinformation operations being waged against us by our enemies overseas.

10:00.520 --> 10:02.880
The Act outlines two priorities.

10:02.880 --> 10:07.240
The first is countering foreign propaganda, and it explicitly names Russia and China,

10:07.240 --> 10:11.160
as well as various non-state actors, as the Act's targets.

10:11.160 --> 10:16.880
The second priority, though, establishes a fund to help train local journalists and provides

10:16.880 --> 10:23.960
grants and contracts to non-government organizations, civil society organizations, think tanks,

10:23.960 --> 10:30.560
private sector companies, media organizations, and other experts outside the U.S. government

10:30.560 --> 10:36.480
with experience in identifying and analyzing the latest trends in foreign government disinformation

10:36.480 --> 10:37.480
techniques.

10:37.480 --> 10:42.180
The Act expired exactly two years later, December 23rd, 2018.

10:42.180 --> 10:47.160
Within a month of that date, multiple radical progressive news organizations, from BuzzFeed

10:47.160 --> 10:53.320
to HuffPo to Vice, began implementing layoffs and cutbacks, citing a lack of funding and

10:53.320 --> 10:55.440
a need to downsize as the reasoning.

10:55.440 --> 10:57.280
Yeah, you heard all of that right.

10:57.280 --> 11:01.580
I think what happened here, and this is just my guess, is that the Obama administration

11:01.580 --> 11:06.560
decided to empower radical progressives within the media in order to push a cultural, social,

11:06.560 --> 11:11.440
and political narrative, with the now overused excuse of Russian interference.

11:11.440 --> 11:15.880
And when the money finally ran out, those same activists that were brought on to turn

11:15.880 --> 11:21.120
the media into an absolute nightmare circus of incompetence and mouth-frothing ignorance

11:21.120 --> 11:24.360
back in 2016 were finally shown the door.

11:24.360 --> 11:29.120
Let's hope that this event finally signals the death of the media's cult-like behavior

11:29.120 --> 11:33.480
now that all of these laughing stocks have been cast out into the streets, into the cold,

11:33.480 --> 11:37.160
harsh reality that the people they claim to advocate for know all too well.

11:37.160 --> 11:39.000
But hey, it's not all bad.

11:39.000 --> 11:42.880
You people think there's a massive gender and race disparity in tech, right?

11:42.880 --> 11:45.560
Well, now's your chance to correct it.

11:45.560 --> 11:46.680
Learn to code.

11:46.680 --> 11:50.280
Let's say you spent 30 years making a solid middle class living in a paper mill in northern

11:50.320 --> 11:51.520
New Hampshire.

11:51.520 --> 11:54.920
Then one day the mill shuts down, sold for scrap to China.

11:54.920 --> 11:55.920
Happened a lot.

11:55.920 --> 11:56.920
But no problem.

11:56.920 --> 11:57.920
Just learn to code.

11:57.920 --> 11:59.240
Everyone in Brooklyn's doing it.

11:59.240 --> 12:03.940
Well, coding was never a real solution to any of this, obviously, but it had the effect

12:03.940 --> 12:08.080
of making journalists feel even more self-satisfied, and of course that was the point.

12:08.080 --> 12:10.320
It's always the point, actually.

12:10.320 --> 12:12.280
Fast forward to this month.

12:12.280 --> 12:15.640
Someone on Twitter came up with a pretty brilliant piece of advice for all those laid-off journalists

12:15.640 --> 12:18.280
trying to figure out what to do with their lives.

12:18.280 --> 12:20.160
Learn to code.

12:20.160 --> 12:20.480
Perfect.
