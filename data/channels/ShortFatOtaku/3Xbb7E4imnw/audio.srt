00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,600
Hello my friends, before we get into it, I want to thank everyone who subbed recently.

2
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:08,800
Thanks to my previous Learn to Code video, this channel went through some pretty amazing

3
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:11,440
growth this past week, and it's all thanks to you.

4
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:15,560
I figure it's a good idea to make a follow-up video, not just to take advantage of the situation,

5
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:16,560
although there is that.

6
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:20,880
But also because, like my Mega Kids follow-up yesterday, a lot of new developments have

7
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:22,360
happened on the topic.

8
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:23,360
Like this!

9
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:25,640
This was posted only a couple hours before recording this video.

10
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:29,440
Vice Media to reorganize lay off 10% of staff.

11
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:33,880
You know, that exclusive tag right in the headline really makes me feel like the author

12
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:39,040
of the article is hoping and praying that these layoffs are exclusive to Vice and won't

13
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:40,520
be coming to his outlet too.

14
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:46,200
The cuts, which will impact around 250 people, are part of new CEO Nancy DeBuck's strategic

15
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:49,040
plan to tighten spending and achieve profitability.

16
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:51,300
Oh, so Vice wasn't profitable?

17
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:54,120
Who could have known with such quality reporting as this?

18
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:59,640
Vice Media is planning a reorganization that will include laying off about 10% of its workforce,

19
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:04,980
as the once high-flying startup looks to rein in an unwieldy business that grew quickly

20
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:06,880
during the height of the digital boom.

21
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:10,860
Well, digital markets are still growing, I'd say even still booming.

22
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:15,360
So I don't think Vice's problem is the market, I think Vice's problem is Vice.

23
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:19,800
One of the new CEO's first projects was setting a plan that would bring order to the chaos

24
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:24,220
that was created during the years when Vice transformed from a Montreal punk magazine

25
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:25,880
to a global media organization.

26
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:30,640
Yeah, I know about Third Wave Feminism's obsession with the zine format, it really

27
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:33,240
does sound like Vice was doomed from the start.

28
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:34,940
But today, it's Vice.

29
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:37,720
Just like how it was Buzzfeed and HuffPo last week.

30
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:42,360
And the brainlets over at Vice are having the same dumb reactions as the brainlets over

31
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:43,960
at Buzzfeed and HuffPo.

32
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:49,760
Here's Vice's social editor with, I cannot emphasize this enough, unionize your workplace.

33
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:54,800
Followed up with, just to clarify, I don't know anything about myself yet, but appreciate

34
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,000
everyone reaching out.

35
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Well, with a statement like that, if you weren't on the chopping block before, you are now.

36
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,460
I'm not anti-union by any stretch of the imagination, but I do recognize that unions

37
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:09,600
are going to cause more trouble, not less, in a failing business or disappearing market.

38
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:12,680
These people don't get that, because their worldview is simplistic.

39
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:16,960
Their bosses have a sum of money characterized as a lot, and they should be forced to fork

40
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:19,120
it over in exchange for subpar writing.

41
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,120
And that's that.

42
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:24,200
Anonymous trolls tweeting in glee about Vice layoffs are absolute cowards.

43
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:26,360
And I'm not just talking about alt-right idiots.

44
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:29,900
Your problems with this company and its executives should not be directed at low-level workers

45
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:31,000
just trying to make a living.

46
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,600
Oh, is that the new standard?

47
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:36,640
That we shouldn't be laughing at people who get shit-canned after years of not only

48
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:40,920
doing their jobs poorly, but using their positions to laugh at people themselves?

49
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:43,040
Not just laugh, but harass people?

50
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:45,800
Not just harass people, but attempt to get them fucking fired?

51
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,880
They are workers who do not deserve this cruelty.

52
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:50,160
No, on some level this is the bed they made.

53
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,620
I just want this point to be crystal clear.

54
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:56,960
The journalists who, for the past decade, have weaponized their platforms in attempts

55
00:02:56,960 --> 00:03:01,040
to get others removed from their careers, projects, and positions for their political

56
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:05,920
beliefs, are now calling foul because the average person, the pleb, is having a chuckle

57
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:09,960
at them losing their jobs due to their political beliefs not being profitable.

58
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,280
I'm okay with this.

59
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:15,960
Here's a ridiculous conspiracy theory as to what Learn to Code actually means.

60
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:20,360
The trolls are using Learn to Code as an outer narrative, a collectively agreed-upon

61
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:25,280
bad-faith argument that is internally understood as such, to provide cover for their true agenda.

62
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:30,200
No, no, the truth is you're all unlikeable assholes and people enjoy laughing at you

63
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:31,200
when you fail.

64
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:35,080
The everyman is always going to rejoice when the bully finally gets his comeuppance.

65
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:39,280
Zoe Beery at Study Hall asked me why Learn to Code is such an effective meme.

66
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:43,800
It's an ingenious cover story of highlighting journalistic softness with Learn to Code,

67
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,800
then expected cruelty underneath.

68
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:49,800
They kind of beta tested this with a thing called the NPC meme that didn't catch on

69
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,880
because it only made sense to gamers.

70
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:56,620
They realized picking on journalists who recently lost their jobs, while knowing full well some

71
00:03:56,620 --> 00:04:00,040
of them are sending threats alongside it, has been an effective trolling strategy to

72
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,800
make them feel twice the pain.

73
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,000
Send threats.

74
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,720
Send a pointless Learn to Code campaign on top as a cover story.

75
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:09,240
Point to the cover story to make journalists appear soft.

76
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:13,440
Well, let me state right now, if you're actually sending threats to journalists, don't

77
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,440
do that.

78
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:16,860
If you're trying to laugh at them, it's not okay to threaten them.

79
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:20,340
But I have a feeling that the journalists actually are soft, to the point that they're

80
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:23,160
taking things that are clearly not threatening as threats.

81
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,800
Here's an example.

82
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:28,000
Parker Malloy here is actually taking this as a threat.

83
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,360
It's threatening imagery, to use her own words.

84
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:34,680
You would have to be a soft lefty journo to actually feel threatened by this.

85
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:38,440
You can taunt journalists with Learn to Code all you want, but you can't run from the

86
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:42,360
fact that if you switch jobs for six months, the journalist would be better coders than

87
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:43,360
you would be at journalism.

88
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,440
I don't know about this one, Caitlin.

89
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:48,720
Coders might have an advantage in journalism because they will have learned the difference

90
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:52,560
between true and false from day one, while a lot of journalists going into code still

91
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:53,620
haven't figured it out.

92
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:58,060
To all journalists being marauded, hold the line, don't give an inch to these trolls.

93
00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:01,480
Learn to Code is a threat to silence journalists via violence.

94
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,480
Really?

95
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:03,480
Violence?

96
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:06,340
When journos are spoon fed back their own narrative.

97
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:10,380
Were journalists themselves being violent when they told minors to Learn to Code?

98
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:14,900
Was CNN being violent when it published an article stating that they had the docs of

99
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:19,240
reddit user Han asshole solo and that they would publish it if he didn't delete and

100
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:23,100
apologize for this gif of Trump disrespecting CNN?

101
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:27,640
It's almost like these elitist fucks feel like they should have the monopoly on violence

102
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:28,860
and not the state.

103
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:34,300
The twitter account NazisNotWelcome decided to tweet out, we will not tolerate your fascist

104
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:35,940
attacks on the press.

105
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:36,940
Not for a minute.

106
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:39,180
Stop attacking journalists immediately.

107
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:44,820
Yep, making fun of shitty people losing their jobs after years of hurling abuse is fascism

108
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:45,820
now.

109
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:49,900
I am not surprised that an antifa commie, somebody who wants everyone and everything

110
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:54,220
to be equalized and redistributed, would take great offense at the laughter of the common

111
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:56,980
people finding joy in a tyrant's fall.

112
00:05:56,980 --> 00:06:01,860
In any case, the Learn to Code meme took off hard, despite the best efforts of the radical

113
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:06,500
left, so twitter staff decided to make the phrase Learn to Code hate speech.

114
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:07,500
Yes?

115
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:08,500
Really?

116
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:13,340
I am told by a person in the know that tweeting Learn to Code at any recently laid off journalist

117
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:17,900
will be treated as abusive behavior and is a violation of twitter's terms of service.

118
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:21,220
I swear to god, lefty journals are made of fucking Play-Doh.

119
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:26,180
Of course, even twitter realized how retarded that sounds because they issued a clarification.

120
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:28,700
It's more nuanced than what you reported.

121
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:33,540
Twitter is responding to a targeted harassment campaign against specific individuals, a policy

122
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:35,460
that's long been against twitter rules.

123
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:37,980
Oh, okay, okay, I get it.

124
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:41,700
Fine, a targeted harassment campaign against specific individuals.

125
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:46,240
Like all the SJWs threatening and doxing the MAGA kids from Covington Catholic High School

126
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,680
last week, right?

127
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:51,540
That seems to be a targeted harassment campaign against specific individuals.

128
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:53,540
When are they getting their bans, Jack?

129
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:55,960
Or is that one just not important enough?

130
00:06:55,960 --> 00:07:00,540
Does that have to go on the back burner because latte-sipping communist activists, calling

131
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:03,780
themselves journalists, are taking some flak on the internet?

132
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:07,580
Twitter meltdowns are fun and all, but let's turn our attention to the core of the matter.

133
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:12,180
Yes, Vice's CEO has stated that the layoffs will touch all departments at every level,

134
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:14,520
which means saying goodbye to some colleagues.

135
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:16,420
But who exactly is going to get fired?

136
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:17,980
As of this recording, I don't know.

137
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:20,980
Maybe by the time the video is out, names will be floating around.

138
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:22,340
But let me make a prediction.

139
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:27,500
I think Vice is going to follow the lead of Buzzfeed and lay off primarily people of color

140
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:29,500
and LGBT employees.

141
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:31,660
Huh, funny how that works.

142
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:37,160
Among these minority, ethnic, and LGBTQ former staff are some well-known figures within Asian

143
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:38,740
American communities.

144
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:44,240
These writers and producers have frequently created content on race, culture, mental health,

145
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,720
and issues facing the LGBTQ community.

146
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:49,260
Well, maybe that's why they were laid off.

147
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:54,200
Their work was overwhelmingly devoid of value and was the exact type of thing that Buzzfeed

148
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,960
was crumbling under the weight of.

149
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:59,680
Maybe it's because they were diversity hires with lesser qualifications, experience, or

150
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:04,280
quality, and when it came time to trim the fat, the least talented people had to go regardless

151
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:05,420
of skin color.

152
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:09,380
Maybe it's because Buzzfeed decided to let go of the people producing the most politically

153
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:15,100
agitating content, the blame-white-men-for-everything garbage, and it just happened to be that minorities

154
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:16,720
were putting out most of that junk.

155
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:21,780
In other words, if you're not hired for your competence, expect to get fired for your

156
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:23,060
incompetence.

157
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:26,860
These people talk about racism and sexism as if they're moral paragons.

158
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:31,180
The honest truth is, they've simply substituted one form of bigotry for another.

159
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:33,900
They still have a very robust in-group preference.

160
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:39,940
The difference is, their in-group is not my race or my nationality, it's fellow journalists

161
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:41,500
and fellow radical lefties.

162
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:45,820
It's not even the working class or the poor as they like to claim it is.

163
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:49,940
Their reactions to workers affected by America's dying industries proves that.

164
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:52,020
When it was coal miners, it was learn to code.

165
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:55,740
When it was journalists, capitalism is evil and democracy is crumbling.

166
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:58,460
It's not hard to figure out who they actually care for.

167
00:08:58,460 --> 00:09:01,460
There's still one final lingering question, though.

168
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:03,220
Why is this all happening now?

169
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:07,020
Why are all these people getting laid off within days of each other from a bunch of

170
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:08,500
different progressive outlets?

171
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:14,140
Well, back in March of 2016, the Countering Foreign Propaganda and Disinformation Act

172
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:15,140
was written.

173
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:20,540
It hit the table in May 2016, made it through the House vote on December 2nd, 2016, and

174
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:22,660
the Senate vote on December 8th.

175
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:28,140
President Obama signed it into law on December 23rd as a part of 2017's National Defense

176
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:29,660
Authorization Act.

177
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:36,440
The Countering Foreign Propaganda and Disinformation Act set aside $160 million for use in countering

178
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,780
foreign propaganda.

179
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:41,620
Ron Portman, one of the senators that helped write the act, stated that,

180
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:46,320
Our enemies are using foreign propaganda and disinformation against us and our allies.

181
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:50,080
And so far the U.S. government has been asleep at the wheel, but today the United States

182
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:55,640
has taken a critical step towards confronting the extensive and destabilizing foreign propaganda

183
00:09:55,640 --> 00:10:00,520
and disinformation operations being waged against us by our enemies overseas.

184
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:02,880
The Act outlines two priorities.

185
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:07,240
The first is countering foreign propaganda, and it explicitly names Russia and China,

186
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:11,160
as well as various non-state actors, as the Act's targets.

187
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:16,880
The second priority, though, establishes a fund to help train local journalists and provides

188
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:23,960
grants and contracts to non-government organizations, civil society organizations, think tanks,

189
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:30,560
private sector companies, media organizations, and other experts outside the U.S. government

190
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:36,480
with experience in identifying and analyzing the latest trends in foreign government disinformation

191
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:37,480
techniques.

192
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:42,180
The Act expired exactly two years later, December 23rd, 2018.

193
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:47,160
Within a month of that date, multiple radical progressive news organizations, from BuzzFeed

194
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:53,320
to HuffPo to Vice, began implementing layoffs and cutbacks, citing a lack of funding and

195
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:55,440
a need to downsize as the reasoning.

196
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,280
Yeah, you heard all of that right.

197
00:10:57,280 --> 00:11:01,580
I think what happened here, and this is just my guess, is that the Obama administration

198
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:06,560
decided to empower radical progressives within the media in order to push a cultural, social,

199
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:11,440
and political narrative, with the now overused excuse of Russian interference.

200
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:15,880
And when the money finally ran out, those same activists that were brought on to turn

201
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:21,120
the media into an absolute nightmare circus of incompetence and mouth-frothing ignorance

202
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:24,360
back in 2016 were finally shown the door.

203
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:29,120
Let's hope that this event finally signals the death of the media's cult-like behavior

204
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:33,480
now that all of these laughing stocks have been cast out into the streets, into the cold,

205
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:37,160
harsh reality that the people they claim to advocate for know all too well.

206
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:39,000
But hey, it's not all bad.

207
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,880
You people think there's a massive gender and race disparity in tech, right?

208
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:45,560
Well, now's your chance to correct it.

209
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:46,680
Learn to code.

210
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:50,280
Let's say you spent 30 years making a solid middle class living in a paper mill in northern

211
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,520
New Hampshire.

212
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:54,920
Then one day the mill shuts down, sold for scrap to China.

213
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:55,920
Happened a lot.

214
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:56,920
But no problem.

215
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:57,920
Just learn to code.

216
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,240
Everyone in Brooklyn's doing it.

217
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:03,940
Well, coding was never a real solution to any of this, obviously, but it had the effect

218
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:08,080
of making journalists feel even more self-satisfied, and of course that was the point.

219
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:10,320
It's always the point, actually.

220
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:12,280
Fast forward to this month.

221
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:15,640
Someone on Twitter came up with a pretty brilliant piece of advice for all those laid-off journalists

222
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:18,280
trying to figure out what to do with their lives.

223
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:20,160
Learn to code.

224
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:20,480
Perfect.
