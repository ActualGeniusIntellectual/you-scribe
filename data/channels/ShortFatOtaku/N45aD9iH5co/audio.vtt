00:00.000 --> 00:04.240
Hello one and all, it's Dev. How's it going everyone? We're here to look at some TikToks,

00:04.240 --> 00:07.040
let's get right to it. No time to waste today.

00:10.240 --> 00:13.760
What? Kind of quiet. Oh, give me your cash. Oh, she has a knife.

00:16.480 --> 00:20.320
Robbing at knife point, guys. Jesus. Going crazy right off the bat.

00:22.560 --> 00:25.120
She just puts the knife down? Dude, grab the knife. What are you doing?

00:25.120 --> 00:33.600
What are you? I'm actually surprised at how, this is a comedy of errors already.

00:34.560 --> 00:36.880
She just picks the knife back up. Why didn't he grab it?

00:44.000 --> 00:47.280
She's not going to do anything. You could probably disarm her too.

00:55.520 --> 00:58.480
This is a, it's like a really calm robbery, you know?

01:00.480 --> 01:05.200
And there she goes with like her 30 bucks or whatever. Jesus.

01:08.640 --> 01:15.760
He just calmly walks after. What a man. It's, I mean, robbery is never good, right? Like,

01:15.760 --> 01:21.760
obviously fuck this person, but what a weird, so, so many things. It's like, you're watching like

01:21.760 --> 01:26.240
two pacifists engage and one of them wants to rob the other. It's like,

01:26.240 --> 01:31.520
please let me rob you, sir. Oh, I cannot. Oh, you know what I mean? It's strange.

01:36.480 --> 01:39.760
Speaking of robbery, they're robbing the Amazon truck.

01:40.720 --> 01:42.160
Oh, my God.

01:45.440 --> 01:47.840
Just grab whatever box you can and run, dude.

01:51.440 --> 01:56.880
That guy's going to lose his job. Oh, man. You got to lock your truck up when you go

01:56.880 --> 02:01.360
and deliver something, dude. You can't just leave it open. Also, like what a terrible neighborhood.

02:01.360 --> 02:05.680
What terrible people. They're just going to see an open truck and immediately jump in.

02:06.400 --> 02:09.360
That's genuinely awful. It's like you're living in the third world at this point.

02:09.760 --> 02:15.120
Oh, there's some music. Hold on. Give me music here. Okay. She got her boyfriend's name

02:15.120 --> 02:22.400
tattooed on her forehead. Why do you think this is a good idea? Why? Oh, why? No, no, no. You don't.

02:24.880 --> 02:29.680
Like, I guess if you're just going to have a career as a prostitute, maybe like,

02:30.480 --> 02:34.960
what, what, what is your plan here? You can't have a real job. Oh, my God. Okay.

02:34.960 --> 02:38.080
So there's, there's definitely this conversation with tattoos, right? It's like,

02:38.080 --> 02:42.240
should a person be barred from like having a normal office job for like a tattoo

02:42.240 --> 02:46.800
that's on their wrist, like a small tattoo or something, or like if they have like tattoos

02:46.800 --> 02:50.560
in their back that can't be seen because they put a shirt on or like a suit or whatever.

02:50.560 --> 02:56.560
It's like, okay. All right. You can definitely have tasteful tattoos, but your boyfriend's name

02:56.560 --> 03:02.400
on your forehead, not only will that like fuck your career up, it also just looks stupid. I have

03:02.400 --> 03:05.440
a feeling that even the boyfriend eventually is going to just be looking at that and be like,

03:05.680 --> 03:08.320
I got to look at this again. Trashy fucking people, guys.

03:11.120 --> 03:18.560
Here we go. Oh, dude, this guy's a baller. Oh, my God. You're asking to fly off and get destroyed

03:18.560 --> 03:22.880
at that point. Man. Yeah, there is no way that would be allowed on like a Western ride. Like

03:22.880 --> 03:27.600
it was in Korea, I think. No way that would be allowed here. Like stringent safety regulations

03:27.600 --> 03:31.600
here in Canada, dude. Naomi and I just went to Canada's Wonderland, which is a theme park in

03:31.600 --> 03:36.160
Toronto. Really fun time, but man, they don't mess around with the safety. In fact, what happened

03:36.160 --> 03:40.480
there was the latest indication that I should probably start losing some weight because the guy

03:40.480 --> 03:47.280
had to like really squeeze a harness down on my fat gut to try to fit me into the roller coaster.

03:47.280 --> 03:52.720
I should probably lose some weight before I go next day. What's going on? Look at this guy. He

03:52.720 --> 03:59.200
just has like a battle ax. That's like a medieval battle ax, dude. Like he's standing there high as

03:59.200 --> 04:05.760
fuck, heroin up and he holding the battle ax. What the fuck? Okay. I've seen a lot of like videos,

04:05.760 --> 04:10.800
both. I've put a lot of them in TikTok Tuesdays. A lot of them I just see on Twitter and I just

04:10.800 --> 04:14.720
like scroll on because you can't, you only react to the same type of video so many times, right?

04:14.720 --> 04:19.840
But it's just like people who are high as fuck, needles hanging out of their arm and they're

04:19.840 --> 04:23.680
sitting around on the street. Maybe they're shitting in the street. People have to walk

04:23.680 --> 04:29.280
around them and they're just, just decay in human filth and moral degeneracy everywhere.

04:29.280 --> 04:35.920
Usually in San Francisco, right? But man, a guy who is high, barely able to stand,

04:35.920 --> 04:43.440
holding a battle ax. That is a, what, how, what the fuck happened for that to be a thing?

04:43.440 --> 04:49.040
Like where did the battle ax come from, dude? Now, certainly him in the lead brings some much

04:49.040 --> 04:55.280
needed new energy to the franchise, but the plot of the film in particular, the actions of Bond

04:55.280 --> 05:03.520
just did not sit right with me. In particular, there's a plot point where Bond tricks a young

05:03.520 --> 05:10.000
religious zealot into sleeping with him where he takes her virginity and she's literally less than

05:10.000 --> 05:17.360
half of his age. Bond has done some questionable womanizing things in these movies. I think this

05:17.360 --> 05:23.440
is by far the creepiest version of Bond. From there, there's a lot of like racial elements

05:23.440 --> 05:28.640
in the film that are so tied to the early seventies that it's kind of uncomfortable to watch.

05:28.640 --> 05:36.560
Oh my God. Okay. Modern, modern soy boy progressive watches a Bond film from the 1970s

05:36.560 --> 05:42.160
and considers it problematic. Things were edgier back then. All right. That's welcome to reality.

05:42.160 --> 05:45.600
What do you want? All right. The past didn't follow progressive morality. What the fuck do

05:45.600 --> 05:49.520
you want? It's like you can't conceive of a time when Funko pops didn't exist.

05:49.520 --> 05:53.120
I'm looking at the thumbnail for this and I already know what the fuck I'm looking at. Holy shit.

05:54.000 --> 05:57.040
What's going on? It's a CGI Klaus Schwab.

05:59.360 --> 06:02.000
You will eat the box. Yum, yum.

06:03.120 --> 06:13.600
Katrina chrome so good. Population control. Thank you for your sacrifice.

06:13.600 --> 06:26.480
I despise you. That's so good. Population control. Yum, yum. You will eat the box.

06:26.480 --> 06:30.320
Okay. We've hit the end. You've hit the end of that meme. All right. Like

06:31.280 --> 06:34.880
it's already an old meme. It's a few months old at this point, but still like that has to be the

06:34.880 --> 06:42.400
peak. It has to be the peak of the parodies of this. Oh my God. Oh, music. Can't tell if cool

06:42.400 --> 06:52.400
or cringy. This guy just has like a screen on his backpack and it's displaying memes.

06:52.400 --> 06:55.360
This is fucking awesome. I mean, it's pretty cringe to be honest, but it's also fucking

06:55.360 --> 07:00.560
awesome. I can see myself doing that if I were a kid nowadays. Damn, that guy's a baller. Wait,

07:00.560 --> 07:05.440
zoomers don't use baller anymore. That guy's Kino. There we go. I know. I know what's going on.

07:06.480 --> 07:08.000
Loading a container in Korea.

07:08.000 --> 07:18.000
How are you getting it out of there, dude? Just ram it in, I guess.

07:27.280 --> 07:31.680
Okay. All right. They're just like, pack it up. We don't care. It's got to get into the

07:31.680 --> 07:35.120
shipping container. What happens when it gets destination? Not our problem. Just shove it in

07:35.120 --> 07:39.040
there. They can worry about it above our pay grade. Our job's done. Go home guys.

07:39.760 --> 07:45.280
Happy national coming out day. I teach fourth grade and I think that fourth grade is the

07:45.280 --> 07:51.040
perfect age for children to really start exploring their sexual orientation and gender identities.

07:51.040 --> 07:57.760
No activity I did in my class today was I had children go into the closet, literally. I have

07:57.760 --> 08:04.080
a closet in my classroom and I would have the kids one at a time go into the closet and then they

08:04.080 --> 08:09.040
would come out and share with the class what their sexual orientation is. So of course we

08:09.040 --> 08:15.920
would celebrate and I would give the kids that I could define as 2SLGBTQIA+, a cupcake, a rainbow

08:15.920 --> 08:20.480
cupcake, the kids that came out and said they were straight. I didn't give them anything because

08:20.480 --> 08:26.480
they're just contributing to a heteronormative society. Oh my fucking god. Okay. Okay. Hold on.

08:26.480 --> 08:29.600
This was like, I got to think about this for a minute.

08:29.600 --> 08:34.960
Is this a parody? Like is this a person who's trolling?

08:36.480 --> 08:40.000
Like that was too on the nose, don't you think? Oh god, what them

08:40.000 --> 08:43.280
Palestinians got to do with me? I'm ready for the cancer.

08:44.640 --> 08:48.320
If black people in America ever defended ourselves...

08:48.320 --> 08:49.120
There's supposed to be a beat?

08:49.840 --> 08:53.520
People are defending their rights. We would get the exact same treatment.

08:53.520 --> 08:55.360
Wait I was too busy beating. What did you say?

08:55.360 --> 09:01.040
If black people in America ever defended ourselves in the way that the Palestinian

09:01.040 --> 09:04.480
people are defending themselves, we would get the exact same treatment.

09:04.480 --> 09:11.440
I mean, yeah. If black people did in fact start going around slaughtering whites en masse

09:11.440 --> 09:16.000
indiscriminately, I'm sure there would be a crackdown on you. Yeah, you would get the

09:16.000 --> 09:21.200
same treatment because what the Palestinians did was fucking unacceptable. Oh god. It seems

09:21.200 --> 09:25.840
like for some of these people, the only thing holding them back from just attempting an actual

09:25.840 --> 09:31.200
genocide, just going on rampages, is the government. They're so full of hate. They're

09:31.200 --> 09:38.800
so morally bankrupt. It's unbelievable sometimes. And I think it's because they're so divorced from

09:38.800 --> 09:42.560
the consequences of their actions and their rhetoric. That combined with all the hate

09:42.560 --> 09:46.160
that they've imbibed has led to the creation of some very terrible people.

09:46.160 --> 09:50.880
Okay kiddos, that about does it for me today. Hey listen, if you're watching this on release,

09:50.880 --> 09:56.480
I should be going on the Side Scrollers podcast right about now, hosted by Stuttering Craig from

09:56.480 --> 10:01.280
back in the day. So I should, I hopefully am including that link on screen. You can click

10:01.280 --> 10:05.200
on it right now and go over there and say hi. Also, I'll be streaming tonight as well,

10:05.200 --> 10:09.520
so make sure to drop in. And no matter where you are, I will see you there.

10:10.160 --> 10:12.880
Have a good one guys. I love you.
