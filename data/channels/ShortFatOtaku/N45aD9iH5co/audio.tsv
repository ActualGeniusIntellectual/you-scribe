0	4240	Hello one and all, it's Dev. How's it going everyone? We're here to look at some TikToks,
4240	7040	let's get right to it. No time to waste today.
10240	13760	What? Kind of quiet. Oh, give me your cash. Oh, she has a knife.
16480	20320	Robbing at knife point, guys. Jesus. Going crazy right off the bat.
22560	25120	She just puts the knife down? Dude, grab the knife. What are you doing?
25120	33600	What are you? I'm actually surprised at how, this is a comedy of errors already.
34560	36880	She just picks the knife back up. Why didn't he grab it?
44000	47280	She's not going to do anything. You could probably disarm her too.
55520	58480	This is a, it's like a really calm robbery, you know?
60480	65200	And there she goes with like her 30 bucks or whatever. Jesus.
68640	75760	He just calmly walks after. What a man. It's, I mean, robbery is never good, right? Like,
75760	81760	obviously fuck this person, but what a weird, so, so many things. It's like, you're watching like
81760	86240	two pacifists engage and one of them wants to rob the other. It's like,
86240	91520	please let me rob you, sir. Oh, I cannot. Oh, you know what I mean? It's strange.
96480	99760	Speaking of robbery, they're robbing the Amazon truck.
100720	102160	Oh, my God.
105440	107840	Just grab whatever box you can and run, dude.
111440	116880	That guy's going to lose his job. Oh, man. You got to lock your truck up when you go
116880	121360	and deliver something, dude. You can't just leave it open. Also, like what a terrible neighborhood.
121360	125680	What terrible people. They're just going to see an open truck and immediately jump in.
126400	129360	That's genuinely awful. It's like you're living in the third world at this point.
129760	135120	Oh, there's some music. Hold on. Give me music here. Okay. She got her boyfriend's name
135120	142400	tattooed on her forehead. Why do you think this is a good idea? Why? Oh, why? No, no, no. You don't.
144880	149680	Like, I guess if you're just going to have a career as a prostitute, maybe like,
150480	154960	what, what, what is your plan here? You can't have a real job. Oh, my God. Okay.
154960	158080	So there's, there's definitely this conversation with tattoos, right? It's like,
158080	162240	should a person be barred from like having a normal office job for like a tattoo
162240	166800	that's on their wrist, like a small tattoo or something, or like if they have like tattoos
166800	170560	in their back that can't be seen because they put a shirt on or like a suit or whatever.
170560	176560	It's like, okay. All right. You can definitely have tasteful tattoos, but your boyfriend's name
176560	182400	on your forehead, not only will that like fuck your career up, it also just looks stupid. I have
182400	185440	a feeling that even the boyfriend eventually is going to just be looking at that and be like,
185680	188320	I got to look at this again. Trashy fucking people, guys.
191120	198560	Here we go. Oh, dude, this guy's a baller. Oh, my God. You're asking to fly off and get destroyed
198560	202880	at that point. Man. Yeah, there is no way that would be allowed on like a Western ride. Like
202880	207600	it was in Korea, I think. No way that would be allowed here. Like stringent safety regulations
207600	211600	here in Canada, dude. Naomi and I just went to Canada's Wonderland, which is a theme park in
211600	216160	Toronto. Really fun time, but man, they don't mess around with the safety. In fact, what happened
216160	220480	there was the latest indication that I should probably start losing some weight because the guy
220480	227280	had to like really squeeze a harness down on my fat gut to try to fit me into the roller coaster.
227280	232720	I should probably lose some weight before I go next day. What's going on? Look at this guy. He
232720	239200	just has like a battle ax. That's like a medieval battle ax, dude. Like he's standing there high as
239200	245760	fuck, heroin up and he holding the battle ax. What the fuck? Okay. I've seen a lot of like videos,
245760	250800	both. I've put a lot of them in TikTok Tuesdays. A lot of them I just see on Twitter and I just
250800	254720	like scroll on because you can't, you only react to the same type of video so many times, right?
254720	259840	But it's just like people who are high as fuck, needles hanging out of their arm and they're
259840	263680	sitting around on the street. Maybe they're shitting in the street. People have to walk
263680	269280	around them and they're just, just decay in human filth and moral degeneracy everywhere.
269280	275920	Usually in San Francisco, right? But man, a guy who is high, barely able to stand,
275920	283440	holding a battle ax. That is a, what, how, what the fuck happened for that to be a thing?
283440	289040	Like where did the battle ax come from, dude? Now, certainly him in the lead brings some much
289040	295280	needed new energy to the franchise, but the plot of the film in particular, the actions of Bond
295280	303520	just did not sit right with me. In particular, there's a plot point where Bond tricks a young
303520	310000	religious zealot into sleeping with him where he takes her virginity and she's literally less than
310000	317360	half of his age. Bond has done some questionable womanizing things in these movies. I think this
317360	323440	is by far the creepiest version of Bond. From there, there's a lot of like racial elements
323440	328640	in the film that are so tied to the early seventies that it's kind of uncomfortable to watch.
328640	336560	Oh my God. Okay. Modern, modern soy boy progressive watches a Bond film from the 1970s
336560	342160	and considers it problematic. Things were edgier back then. All right. That's welcome to reality.
342160	345600	What do you want? All right. The past didn't follow progressive morality. What the fuck do
345600	349520	you want? It's like you can't conceive of a time when Funko pops didn't exist.
349520	353120	I'm looking at the thumbnail for this and I already know what the fuck I'm looking at. Holy shit.
354000	357040	What's going on? It's a CGI Klaus Schwab.
359360	362000	You will eat the box. Yum, yum.
363120	373600	Katrina chrome so good. Population control. Thank you for your sacrifice.
373600	386480	I despise you. That's so good. Population control. Yum, yum. You will eat the box.
386480	390320	Okay. We've hit the end. You've hit the end of that meme. All right. Like
391280	394880	it's already an old meme. It's a few months old at this point, but still like that has to be the
394880	402400	peak. It has to be the peak of the parodies of this. Oh my God. Oh, music. Can't tell if cool
402400	412400	or cringy. This guy just has like a screen on his backpack and it's displaying memes.
412400	415360	This is fucking awesome. I mean, it's pretty cringe to be honest, but it's also fucking
415360	420560	awesome. I can see myself doing that if I were a kid nowadays. Damn, that guy's a baller. Wait,
420560	425440	zoomers don't use baller anymore. That guy's Kino. There we go. I know. I know what's going on.
426480	428000	Loading a container in Korea.
428000	438000	How are you getting it out of there, dude? Just ram it in, I guess.
447280	451680	Okay. All right. They're just like, pack it up. We don't care. It's got to get into the
451680	455120	shipping container. What happens when it gets destination? Not our problem. Just shove it in
455120	459040	there. They can worry about it above our pay grade. Our job's done. Go home guys.
459760	465280	Happy national coming out day. I teach fourth grade and I think that fourth grade is the
465280	471040	perfect age for children to really start exploring their sexual orientation and gender identities.
471040	477760	No activity I did in my class today was I had children go into the closet, literally. I have
477760	484080	a closet in my classroom and I would have the kids one at a time go into the closet and then they
484080	489040	would come out and share with the class what their sexual orientation is. So of course we
489040	495920	would celebrate and I would give the kids that I could define as 2SLGBTQIA+, a cupcake, a rainbow
495920	500480	cupcake, the kids that came out and said they were straight. I didn't give them anything because
500480	506480	they're just contributing to a heteronormative society. Oh my fucking god. Okay. Okay. Hold on.
506480	509600	This was like, I got to think about this for a minute.
509600	514960	Is this a parody? Like is this a person who's trolling?
516480	520000	Like that was too on the nose, don't you think? Oh god, what them
520000	523280	Palestinians got to do with me? I'm ready for the cancer.
524640	528320	If black people in America ever defended ourselves...
528320	529120	There's supposed to be a beat?
529840	533520	People are defending their rights. We would get the exact same treatment.
533520	535360	Wait I was too busy beating. What did you say?
535360	541040	If black people in America ever defended ourselves in the way that the Palestinian
541040	544480	people are defending themselves, we would get the exact same treatment.
544480	551440	I mean, yeah. If black people did in fact start going around slaughtering whites en masse
551440	556000	indiscriminately, I'm sure there would be a crackdown on you. Yeah, you would get the
556000	561200	same treatment because what the Palestinians did was fucking unacceptable. Oh god. It seems
561200	565840	like for some of these people, the only thing holding them back from just attempting an actual
565840	571200	genocide, just going on rampages, is the government. They're so full of hate. They're
571200	578800	so morally bankrupt. It's unbelievable sometimes. And I think it's because they're so divorced from
578800	582560	the consequences of their actions and their rhetoric. That combined with all the hate
582560	586160	that they've imbibed has led to the creation of some very terrible people.
586160	590880	Okay kiddos, that about does it for me today. Hey listen, if you're watching this on release,
590880	596480	I should be going on the Side Scrollers podcast right about now, hosted by Stuttering Craig from
596480	601280	back in the day. So I should, I hopefully am including that link on screen. You can click
601280	605200	on it right now and go over there and say hi. Also, I'll be streaming tonight as well,
605200	609520	so make sure to drop in. And no matter where you are, I will see you there.
610160	612880	Have a good one guys. I love you.
