00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,240
Hello one and all, it's Dev. How's it going everyone? We're here to look at some TikToks,

2
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:07,040
let's get right to it. No time to waste today.

3
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:13,760
What? Kind of quiet. Oh, give me your cash. Oh, she has a knife.

4
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:20,320
Robbing at knife point, guys. Jesus. Going crazy right off the bat.

5
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:25,120
She just puts the knife down? Dude, grab the knife. What are you doing?

6
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:33,600
What are you? I'm actually surprised at how, this is a comedy of errors already.

7
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:36,880
She just picks the knife back up. Why didn't he grab it?

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,280
She's not going to do anything. You could probably disarm her too.

9
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:58,480
This is a, it's like a really calm robbery, you know?

10
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:05,200
And there she goes with like her 30 bucks or whatever. Jesus.

11
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:15,760
He just calmly walks after. What a man. It's, I mean, robbery is never good, right? Like,

12
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:21,760
obviously fuck this person, but what a weird, so, so many things. It's like, you're watching like

13
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:26,240
two pacifists engage and one of them wants to rob the other. It's like,

14
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:31,520
please let me rob you, sir. Oh, I cannot. Oh, you know what I mean? It's strange.

15
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:39,760
Speaking of robbery, they're robbing the Amazon truck.

16
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,160
Oh, my God.

17
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:47,840
Just grab whatever box you can and run, dude.

18
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:56,880
That guy's going to lose his job. Oh, man. You got to lock your truck up when you go

19
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:01,360
and deliver something, dude. You can't just leave it open. Also, like what a terrible neighborhood.

20
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:05,680
What terrible people. They're just going to see an open truck and immediately jump in.

21
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:09,360
That's genuinely awful. It's like you're living in the third world at this point.

22
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:15,120
Oh, there's some music. Hold on. Give me music here. Okay. She got her boyfriend's name

23
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:22,400
tattooed on her forehead. Why do you think this is a good idea? Why? Oh, why? No, no, no. You don't.

24
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:29,680
Like, I guess if you're just going to have a career as a prostitute, maybe like,

25
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:34,960
what, what, what is your plan here? You can't have a real job. Oh, my God. Okay.

26
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:38,080
So there's, there's definitely this conversation with tattoos, right? It's like,

27
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:42,240
should a person be barred from like having a normal office job for like a tattoo

28
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:46,800
that's on their wrist, like a small tattoo or something, or like if they have like tattoos

29
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,560
in their back that can't be seen because they put a shirt on or like a suit or whatever.

30
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:56,560
It's like, okay. All right. You can definitely have tasteful tattoos, but your boyfriend's name

31
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:02,400
on your forehead, not only will that like fuck your career up, it also just looks stupid. I have

32
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:05,440
a feeling that even the boyfriend eventually is going to just be looking at that and be like,

33
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:08,320
I got to look at this again. Trashy fucking people, guys.

34
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:18,560
Here we go. Oh, dude, this guy's a baller. Oh, my God. You're asking to fly off and get destroyed

35
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:22,880
at that point. Man. Yeah, there is no way that would be allowed on like a Western ride. Like

36
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:27,600
it was in Korea, I think. No way that would be allowed here. Like stringent safety regulations

37
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:31,600
here in Canada, dude. Naomi and I just went to Canada's Wonderland, which is a theme park in

38
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:36,160
Toronto. Really fun time, but man, they don't mess around with the safety. In fact, what happened

39
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:40,480
there was the latest indication that I should probably start losing some weight because the guy

40
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:47,280
had to like really squeeze a harness down on my fat gut to try to fit me into the roller coaster.

41
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:52,720
I should probably lose some weight before I go next day. What's going on? Look at this guy. He

42
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:59,200
just has like a battle ax. That's like a medieval battle ax, dude. Like he's standing there high as

43
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:05,760
fuck, heroin up and he holding the battle ax. What the fuck? Okay. I've seen a lot of like videos,

44
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:10,800
both. I've put a lot of them in TikTok Tuesdays. A lot of them I just see on Twitter and I just

45
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:14,720
like scroll on because you can't, you only react to the same type of video so many times, right?

46
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:19,840
But it's just like people who are high as fuck, needles hanging out of their arm and they're

47
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:23,680
sitting around on the street. Maybe they're shitting in the street. People have to walk

48
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:29,280
around them and they're just, just decay in human filth and moral degeneracy everywhere.

49
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:35,920
Usually in San Francisco, right? But man, a guy who is high, barely able to stand,

50
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:43,440
holding a battle ax. That is a, what, how, what the fuck happened for that to be a thing?

51
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:49,040
Like where did the battle ax come from, dude? Now, certainly him in the lead brings some much

52
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:55,280
needed new energy to the franchise, but the plot of the film in particular, the actions of Bond

53
00:04:55,280 --> 00:05:03,520
just did not sit right with me. In particular, there's a plot point where Bond tricks a young

54
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:10,000
religious zealot into sleeping with him where he takes her virginity and she's literally less than

55
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:17,360
half of his age. Bond has done some questionable womanizing things in these movies. I think this

56
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:23,440
is by far the creepiest version of Bond. From there, there's a lot of like racial elements

57
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:28,640
in the film that are so tied to the early seventies that it's kind of uncomfortable to watch.

58
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:36,560
Oh my God. Okay. Modern, modern soy boy progressive watches a Bond film from the 1970s

59
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:42,160
and considers it problematic. Things were edgier back then. All right. That's welcome to reality.

60
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:45,600
What do you want? All right. The past didn't follow progressive morality. What the fuck do

61
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:49,520
you want? It's like you can't conceive of a time when Funko pops didn't exist.

62
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:53,120
I'm looking at the thumbnail for this and I already know what the fuck I'm looking at. Holy shit.

63
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,040
What's going on? It's a CGI Klaus Schwab.

64
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:02,000
You will eat the box. Yum, yum.

65
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:13,600
Katrina chrome so good. Population control. Thank you for your sacrifice.

66
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:26,480
I despise you. That's so good. Population control. Yum, yum. You will eat the box.

67
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:30,320
Okay. We've hit the end. You've hit the end of that meme. All right. Like

68
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:34,880
it's already an old meme. It's a few months old at this point, but still like that has to be the

69
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:42,400
peak. It has to be the peak of the parodies of this. Oh my God. Oh, music. Can't tell if cool

70
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:52,400
or cringy. This guy just has like a screen on his backpack and it's displaying memes.

71
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:55,360
This is fucking awesome. I mean, it's pretty cringe to be honest, but it's also fucking

72
00:06:55,360 --> 00:07:00,560
awesome. I can see myself doing that if I were a kid nowadays. Damn, that guy's a baller. Wait,

73
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:05,440
zoomers don't use baller anymore. That guy's Kino. There we go. I know. I know what's going on.

74
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:08,000
Loading a container in Korea.

75
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:18,000
How are you getting it out of there, dude? Just ram it in, I guess.

76
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:31,680
Okay. All right. They're just like, pack it up. We don't care. It's got to get into the

77
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:35,120
shipping container. What happens when it gets destination? Not our problem. Just shove it in

78
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:39,040
there. They can worry about it above our pay grade. Our job's done. Go home guys.

79
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:45,280
Happy national coming out day. I teach fourth grade and I think that fourth grade is the

80
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:51,040
perfect age for children to really start exploring their sexual orientation and gender identities.

81
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:57,760
No activity I did in my class today was I had children go into the closet, literally. I have

82
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:04,080
a closet in my classroom and I would have the kids one at a time go into the closet and then they

83
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:09,040
would come out and share with the class what their sexual orientation is. So of course we

84
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:15,920
would celebrate and I would give the kids that I could define as 2SLGBTQIA+, a cupcake, a rainbow

85
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:20,480
cupcake, the kids that came out and said they were straight. I didn't give them anything because

86
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:26,480
they're just contributing to a heteronormative society. Oh my fucking god. Okay. Okay. Hold on.

87
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:29,600
This was like, I got to think about this for a minute.

88
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:34,960
Is this a parody? Like is this a person who's trolling?

89
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:40,000
Like that was too on the nose, don't you think? Oh god, what them

90
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,280
Palestinians got to do with me? I'm ready for the cancer.

91
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:48,320
If black people in America ever defended ourselves...

92
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,120
There's supposed to be a beat?

93
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:53,520
People are defending their rights. We would get the exact same treatment.

94
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:55,360
Wait I was too busy beating. What did you say?

95
00:08:55,360 --> 00:09:01,040
If black people in America ever defended ourselves in the way that the Palestinian

96
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:04,480
people are defending themselves, we would get the exact same treatment.

97
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:11,440
I mean, yeah. If black people did in fact start going around slaughtering whites en masse

98
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:16,000
indiscriminately, I'm sure there would be a crackdown on you. Yeah, you would get the

99
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:21,200
same treatment because what the Palestinians did was fucking unacceptable. Oh god. It seems

100
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:25,840
like for some of these people, the only thing holding them back from just attempting an actual

101
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:31,200
genocide, just going on rampages, is the government. They're so full of hate. They're

102
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:38,800
so morally bankrupt. It's unbelievable sometimes. And I think it's because they're so divorced from

103
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:42,560
the consequences of their actions and their rhetoric. That combined with all the hate

104
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:46,160
that they've imbibed has led to the creation of some very terrible people.

105
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:50,880
Okay kiddos, that about does it for me today. Hey listen, if you're watching this on release,

106
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:56,480
I should be going on the Side Scrollers podcast right about now, hosted by Stuttering Craig from

107
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:01,280
back in the day. So I should, I hopefully am including that link on screen. You can click

108
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:05,200
on it right now and go over there and say hi. Also, I'll be streaming tonight as well,

109
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:09,520
so make sure to drop in. And no matter where you are, I will see you there.

110
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:12,880
Have a good one guys. I love you.
