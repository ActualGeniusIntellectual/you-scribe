0	9860	Alright guys, IRL is hitting me real hard, I've got no time for a video today.
9860	15000	I keep seeing this clip from December of last year go viral and re-viral, it keeps popping
15000	16880	up on the front page of YouTube for me.
16880	21100	It's from Courtney Ryan, no clue who this is, which guy would women choose?
21100	27020	I've been dipping my toes into some red pill stuff, not because I believe in it, I don't,
27020	29960	but I do find it interesting to look at some of these communities that I'm not really part
29960	32560	of on YouTube and in the streaming space.
32560	36480	And I've got a spare 30 minutes, YouTube keeps recommending me this garbage, so I might as
36480	38760	well finally give in and check it out.
38760	39760	Let's go.
39760	42720	Welcome back to my channel, if you're new here, I'm Courtney Ryan, and today we're playing
42720	45840	a little game with a group of girls called Would You Rather.
45840	50200	So what I do, I give them guy number one, and guy number two, and each guy comes with
50200	54600	some baggage or some things going on, and they have to choose which guy that they would
54600	56200	rather date.
56200	59560	Sounds good to me, I've got all the baggage.
59560	64160	Guy number one who makes 200k, but he struggles with infidelity and will have one to two affairs
64160	68480	during your life together, or guy number two who makes 40k and is loyal.
68480	72500	Oh, so the girls are gonna like choose between one of these two, okay, I see what's going
72500	73500	on here.
73500	79920	Hmm, $40,000 a year and is loyal versus $20,000 a year and has one to two affairs during their
79920	80920	lifetime.
80920	86020	That's an extra $160,000, like after a few years, that's like a house.
86020	89060	This is a big, I know a lot of them are probably gonna choose the loyal one because that's
89060	93060	what society expects, but I actually think that's a lot closer than that, because that's
93060	94260	a lot of money.
94260	98500	I'll do guy number two, guy number one.
98500	101180	At least she's honest.
101180	106460	The 40k and is loyal, obviously, well, for me, obviously.
106460	108820	That is, that's an easy one.
108820	113540	I guess I'll say the guy number two because I couldn't deal with infidelity no matter
113540	114940	how much money you make.
114940	115940	Loyal.
115940	118820	I would choose $40,000 and loyal.
119060	120580	Loyalty important to you.
120580	121580	Mm-hmm.
121580	122580	Okay.
122580	125180	Definitely the guy who makes 40k and is loyal.
125180	128220	I can already hear all the red pillars saying, no, this is all fake, but they're all gonna
128220	133340	choose the high value male who has more money but cheats sometimes and it's like, in actuality,
133340	135380	no, most women aren't like that.
135380	138580	Most women view their partners as investments.
138580	143940	That's why the whole I can fix him thing is so prevalent and also why women have such
143940	148420	a hard time leaving abusive partners, because they feel like they can invest in a man who
148420	149900	will then produce for them.
149900	153180	The whole alpha male harem status thing.
153180	157340	That's not nearly as common as red pillars like to believe it is.
157340	163140	Next one here is guy number one who is 50 pounds overweight and makes 120k or guy number
163140	168420	two who is fit, nice arms, six pack, great endurance and makes 35k.
168420	171100	Oh, I wonder.
171100	172460	This one's a bit tougher, isn't it?
172460	176780	Because you could lose the 50 pounds and then keep your 120k.
176780	179580	Also, this does say something with their personalities, though, doesn't it?
179580	183100	Because if you're like, you're 50 pounds overweight versus being in shape, that shows like certain
183100	185300	types of habits and your habits are your personality.
185300	187580	So like, um, you could also make more money too.
187580	188580	I don't know.
188580	189580	I don't know about this.
189580	190580	Oh, my God.
190580	191580	Oh, Jesus Christ.
191580	192580	Guy number one.
192580	193580	I'll take the first guy.
193580	194580	Yeah, 35k.
194580	195580	That's like McDonald's.
195580	196580	I'll go with number one.
196580	197580	35k is McDonald's?
197580	199580	Listen, this woman is too good looking to be working retail.
199580	202580	Maybe she actually does think 35k is McDonald's.
202580	203580	What the fuck?
203580	207580	$15 an hour times 40 hours a week.
207580	210580	You're not getting 40 at a part time job, let's just say.
210580	213580	$600 a week times 52.
213580	215580	Making $31,000.
215580	219580	If you have 15 minimum, you're making $31,000 at McDonald's.
219580	220580	Jesus.
220580	222580	Of course, you're not getting 15 minimum at 40 hours a week.
222580	224580	There's not going to be a lot of money.
224580	226580	There's not going to be a lot of money.
226580	227580	Jesus.
227580	229580	Of course, you're not getting 15 minimum at 40 hours a week.
229580	230580	There's no fucking way.
230580	236580	Unless you're a McDonald's manager or something, you're getting shitty 8 to 1s or 1 to 5s or
236580	238580	7 to 10s or something.
238580	239580	These garbage tier shifts.
239580	241580	That's what part time work is like.
241580	242580	At least that's what it was like when I was younger.
242580	244580	I haven't worked in retail in a long time.
244580	249580	That's hard because I don't really value money or...
249580	251580	Well, I guess I value health.
251580	253580	You've got to value something.
253580	255580	I guess I would say the fit guy.
255580	256580	Okay.
256580	259580	Because I care about health, like physical health, because I think it...
259580	261580	It's just like your well-being.
261580	264580	Yeah, I guess that one.
264580	267580	I think being fit is important.
267580	270580	I want a guy who takes care of his health.
270580	275580	50 pounds overweight is really not that bad, especially if...
275580	276580	There's still hope, guys.
276580	277580	There's still hope.
277580	282580	I have a more active lifestyle, so I wouldn't mind helping him be more active.
282580	283580	50 pounds is not that bad.
283580	288580	Guy number one who is a three and has a boat and a second home that's an oceanfront condo,
288580	292580	or guy number two who is an eight but lives at home with his parents.
292580	293580	Oh my God.
293580	297580	Number one has so much more going for him, but he's a three.
297580	299580	What is a three out of 10?
299580	303580	We're talking deformities, lost an eye, scarring, lost a limb.
303580	304580	What are we talking about here?
304580	305580	We're talking about three.
305580	307580	Like morbidly obese.
307580	308580	Three is bad.
308580	309580	That's a lot of money though.
309580	311580	A boat, second home.
311580	313580	Yeah, three is like a Harvey Weinstein or something.
313580	314580	Hold on.
314580	316580	Minus the allegations.
316580	318580	Probably the first one.
318580	319580	Okay.
319580	321580	Just because he's doing better in his life.
321580	322580	Okay.
322580	323580	Fair enough.
323580	325580	I'm not really good for appearances.
325580	330580	I care about physical health, but other than just being healthy, I mean, you don't have
330580	335580	to be super fit or attractive just as long as you're taking care of yourself.
335580	337580	A three though, dude?
337580	339580	... areas of his life.
339580	341580	Oh, that's a good one.
341580	343580	We're talking like deformities at that point.
343580	347580	Probably the eight who lives at home with his parents, especially in times like these.
347580	350580	If he's saving his money...
350580	352580	Just blame on COVID, dude.
352580	355580	I mean, obviously it would be better if a guy had his own place.
357580	358580	Got number one.
358580	359580	All right.
359580	363580	Whenever I see this woman, she always looks like she's about to get her hair cut the way
363580	364580	she's dressed.
364580	365580	I'd say the second guy.
365580	366580	Okay.
366580	368580	Because that doesn't have to be forever.
368580	369580	And how old are you?
369580	370580	I'm 28.
370580	371580	28.
371580	376580	So is there an age where living at home with the parents would be a deal breaker for you?
376580	381580	I'd say life happens and if you need help, you need help.
381580	387580	But typically by the time we're 30, maybe it's time to get on out of there.
387580	388580	All right.
388580	390580	You don't want to be bringing home girls to your parents' house.
390580	391580	That's weird.
391580	392580	I knew a few.
392580	396580	They weren't 30, but I knew a few guys who did that in their late 20s and it's like,
396580	397580	oof, dude.
397580	398580	All right.
398580	402580	Guy number one who is 5'4", 5'4", and makes 250K a year.
402580	406580	Or guy number two who is 6'2", and makes 70K a year.
406580	407580	Ooh.
407580	410580	As a kind of short guy, this one's rough.
410580	415580	I'm 5'7", Naomi's 5'1", so we ended up working out well in terms of height.
415580	420580	Before Naomi, I dated two Asian girls who were also both pretty short.
420580	424580	I've never had any luck with any girls that were as tall as me or taller.
424580	426580	And I know the play to the short man.
426580	427580	I'm not super short.
427580	429580	I'm not like 5'4", 5'2".
429580	431580	There are some guys I've seen walking around.
431580	432580	It's like, Jesus, dude, I'm sorry.
432580	434580	But 5'7", that's not bad.
434580	438580	It is below average, but it's still workable in terms of finding girls.
438580	441580	But yeah, 5'4", versus 6'2".
441580	443580	250 versus 70,000.
443580	444580	Hmm.
444580	450580	70,000 is still enough to live a pretty decent life in a lot of places, so I think the girls
450580	452580	are going to overwhelmingly choose 6'2".
453580	457580	You know, the reason so many guys lie about being 6' when they're actually like 5'11",
457580	460580	sometimes, Dave, is because they know the power of the 6'0".
460580	463580	You know what I mean, when it comes to dating apps or whatever?
463580	465580	So yeah, that's what I think.
465580	468580	Well, I'm 5'10", so 5'4'' is a little too short for me.
468580	472580	I mean, if you're 5'4'' and you're super confident, that's really sexy.
472580	473580	Fair enough, fair enough.
473580	474580	Sometimes there are tall girls out there.
474580	478580	5'4'' is, like I said, I'm 5'10", so 5'4'' is a little too short for me.
478580	479580	I'd prefer a taller guy.
479580	481580	5'4'' 200,000.
481580	482580	250.
482580	483580	Oh, 250.
483580	485580	Or 6'2'' and make 70.
488580	489580	You might go for the 6'2'' guy.
489580	490580	6'2''?
490580	491580	How tall are you?
491580	492580	I'm 5'1".
492580	493580	Jesus!
493580	497580	Even though the 5'4'' is still taller than you, you would still choose the 6'2'' making
497580	498580	less money.
498580	501580	Okay, now we're getting, now we're getting black-pilled guys.
501580	502580	6'2'' guy?
502580	503580	Yeah.
503580	504580	How tall are you?
504580	505580	Yep, black-pilled.
505580	506580	5'6".
506580	507580	Okay.
507580	508580	Oh, guy number two.
509580	510580	How tall are you?
510580	511580	5'1''.
511580	513580	Oh my gosh, so you would still choose the 6'2'' guy?
513580	514580	I had a feeling she would.
514580	515580	Oh, for sure.
515580	516580	My boyfriend's 6'4''.
516580	517580	Jesus Christ!
517580	518580	Oh my gosh.
518580	519580	Okay, so...
519580	520580	This chick's getting impaled!
520580	522580	...than the guy who makes more money.
522580	523580	Yeah.
523580	524580	Okay.
524580	527580	And what is it about the tall factor that stands out to you?
527580	531580	I just feel like taller guys, I'll feel more protected because I'm so short.
531580	534580	I want a guy where if we're out in like a...
534580	535580	Okay, that's BS, alright?
535580	536580	Listen, listen, listen.
536580	541580	I know lots of girls say this, they wanna feel protected by a larger guy, a taller guy,
541580	542580	but that's like...
542580	543580	How do you think it's gonna play out?
543580	546580	Like if you're getting mugged, the mugger pulls out like a gun, are you gonna use it
546580	547580	as like a body shield?
547580	549580	Like, what are you talking about here?
549580	554580	I don't think tall guys are actually able to meaningfully protect you all that more
554580	555580	than short guys.
555580	559580	Unless we're talking purely hand-to-hand with no weapons and even like, when's that
559580	560580	gonna happen?
560580	564580	And even then, you might have a guy who's like trained in martial arts, but even then
564580	568580	it's like such wild cover of dime store smut thinking.
568580	569580	You know what I mean?
569580	573580	What's actually going on here is you just like the look of taller guys, that's it.
573580	576580	The actual protection thing, lots of people say that's part of it, but it's not really
576580	578580	part of it, it just feels like it's part of it, you know what I mean?
578580	580580	I don't know if I'm making any sense here.
580580	581580	Maybe 6'2".
581580	582580	Okay, and how tall are you?
582580	583580	I'm 5'2".
583580	584580	Okay.
584580	585580	So I guess I can't be too picky.
585580	586580	Right.
586580	589580	But if you had to choose, you would choose the taller guy versus the guy who makes more
589580	590580	money?
590580	591580	Maybe, yes.
591580	592580	Okay.
592580	593580	Damn.
593580	594580	Okay.
594580	595580	How tall are you?
595580	596580	5'3".
596580	597580	Oh, okay.
597580	598580	Oh my god.
598580	599980	So if you were still taller than you, you would still choose the really tall guy.
599980	600980	All the short kings.
600980	601980	I'm always in heels.
601980	602980	Taking black pills.
602980	603980	I'm going to be taller than him.
603980	604980	Okay.
604980	608380	Next one is guy number one who is a four, but pays for everything, is a provider and
608380	612300	you don't have to work, or guy number two who is a 10, but you're the breadwinner.
612300	614140	Oh, this one's gotta be number one, right?
614140	619420	I hear so much from women, even like, not even like trad women, just all types of women.
619420	621940	They're like, man, I would love to spend more time at home.
621940	622940	That's so common nowadays.
623300	625340	I think the answer has to be one.
625340	626340	One.
626340	627340	Yeah.
627340	628340	Yeah, of course.
628340	629340	Oh, for sure guy number one.
629340	630340	Yeah.
630340	631340	Yeah, I'm right here.
631340	632340	You don't want to be the breadwinner?
632340	633340	I don't mind being the breadwinner.
633340	634340	So I'll say the 10.
634340	635340	Okay.
635340	636340	And I still make up for it.
636340	637340	Oh, damn.
637340	640100	So attraction to the person, in this case, would be more important to you.
640100	641100	The queen.
641100	642100	Than the money.
642100	643100	Yes.
643100	644100	Okay.
644100	645100	The first one.
645100	646100	Okay.
646100	651660	Yeah, like I said, I don't really care about looks, but also I'm kind of like old fashioned
651660	655140	and like, I kind of do think that a man has this, like men and women have certain roles
655140	661180	and yeah, I think a man should like kind of be more financially stable, I guess in like
661180	662180	a committed relationship.
662180	663180	Yeah.
663180	664740	Like as opposed to the woman being the breadwinner.
664740	667020	Also, I have a lot of like passions and hobbies.
667020	670980	So I think that'd be really cool if I could just stay home and pursue them.
670980	676980	Dude, everyone has passions and hobbies that they want to stay home and pursue.
676980	679620	Like, are you, are you kidding me?
679620	682620	This is just, this is literally fun to my lifestyle shit.
682620	686420	It's kind of strange because like, this is the kind of thing that red pillars want, right?
686420	690340	They want, they want that trad wife to stay at home and, and take care of the house.
690340	693180	That's like, Jesus, aren't you just cucking out to them in a sense?
693180	696700	Because you're off slaving away nine to five shitty job.
696700	697860	They're at home having all the fun.
697860	701180	They're like hanging out with people, they're, they're, they're doing all things they love.
701180	705580	Like, damn, I don't know about you guys, but I want my woman working.
705580	707040	I want her making some fucking money.
707040	713200	Guy number one, who is 54 years old, making 170,000 a year or guy number two, who is 30
713200	715600	making 45,000 a year.
715600	719400	Oh my God, 54.
719400	720920	That's a huge age gap.
720920	723480	Like these girls look like they're in their twenties mainly, right?
723480	726220	Like 54.
726220	729440	Also you have to take into account the fact that you make more money generally as you
729440	730440	get older.
730440	735680	So the 30 year old guy making 45 might actually be making 170 when he's 54.
735960	738760	Like there's, there's a return on investment here.
738760	739760	It's gotta be number two.
739760	744080	Like, I know there's that meme of like the late teens, early twenties girl who's like
744080	747300	fucking around with 45 year old, 50 year old guys.
747300	751520	She's having sex with all of her dad's friends and stuff and it's all real weird and awkward.
751520	753680	But like that can't be that common, right?
753680	755200	See I don't really care much about age.
755200	759400	I've, I've dated guys who are like older than me and stuff.
759400	760800	What's the oldest guy you dated?
760800	763480	I gotta think.
763480	764480	Somewhere in their forties.
764480	769320	I don't think I've gotten up to 50 before, but um, so I don't care about that.
769320	779080	But also I does it, is it dating or marrying?
779080	781040	Just whatever you want for yourself.
781040	783000	If you're dating, I guess it doesn't really matter.
783000	788760	I guess I would pick the older one cause he makes, that sounds superficial, but for marrying
788760	792120	probably the younger one just cause we're more, wait, didn't she say she didn't care
792120	793200	about money before?
793200	795840	I would prefer a guy closer to my age.
795840	799920	I don't think the 54 year old would, if he's like my dad's age, I think that would be a
799920	802360	little strange for me personally.
802360	806120	I mean some girls are into that, but probably the 30 year old.
806120	808680	I've given myself about a 10 year gap.
808680	809680	Okay.
809680	810680	And that's pretty normal.
810680	811680	I've noticed too.
811680	812680	I would do the younger one.
812680	813680	Younger one.
813680	815720	What is the like age cap for you?
815720	818400	Like what is the oldest guy that you would date?
819120	822160	Um, this is a girl that I went to university with.
822160	826680	I wonder if it's her, if she's anything like she was back in school, that, uh, that danger
826680	829000	hair look she's got really fits.
829000	832680	I think early thirties.
832680	833680	Okay.
833680	834680	Yes.
834680	835680	Okay.
835680	837480	Guy number two, not into older men.
837480	838480	Okay.
838480	840360	What is the oldest guy that you would date?
840360	843760	I would date a guy who may be at most 10 years older than me.
843760	844760	Okay.
844760	845760	And you said you're 21.
845760	846760	Okay.
846760	847760	Hold on.
847760	848760	Hold on, dude.
848760	853560	21 would date a 31 year old man, but you're not into older guys.
853560	856120	I mean, not into 50 year old older guys.
856120	857120	Fair enough.
857120	860160	But like a 10 year age gap is still, it's still like a, it's still a reasonably big
860160	861160	age gap, man.
861160	863960	Like I know that Naomi's 10 years younger than me.
863960	868040	I know for example, Sargon's wife is 10 years younger than him.
868040	870560	Dave's girlfriend is like eight years younger.
870560	875320	Um, Medicare Jim's, uh, girl Jade is 10 years younger.
875320	880600	Like a 10 year age gap seems to be pretty common nowadays actually.
880600	888920	Um, and like why, if, if a mid thirties guy can pull a mid twenties girl, why, why wouldn't
888920	892440	he, you know, I've actually heard from a lot of women my age, in fact, some of them from
892440	896080	my high school year who have said, why are you dating someone who's 10 years younger
896080	897080	than you?
898080	903800	The 10 year age gap just seems to be, it seems to be becoming more and more common because
903800	905560	frankly millennial women are awful, man.
905560	906880	I don't want to date millennial women.
906880	908200	I'm happy dating a Zoomer.
908200	912500	And meanwhile, you got like these early 20 somethings who unlike some of their peers
912500	916800	are actually willing to settle down early and they can actually grab say an early thirties
916800	920640	guy who is looking for a longterm relationship, right?
920640	926020	It's a weird dynamic happening right now where some girls will refuse to settle down in their
926020	930660	twenties, try to settle down in their thirties and then realize that the guys that they were
930660	934980	fucking around with, who are around the same age as them, aren't interested in them anymore
934980	939100	because now they can pull the next bunch of 20 somethings coming up.
939100	943020	And if those 20 somethings actually want a stable relationship within the 30 year old
943020	944020	girls out of luck, right?
944020	945660	Now I'm not saying it's fucking hopeless for these women.
945660	950620	I'm not going, you know, full black pill, empty egg cart and stuff and molyneux tier
950620	951620	stuff here.
951740	955580	What I'm saying though, is if you're in like your early thirties and your mid thirties
955580	959780	and you have the option between a woman who is around your age and who has done her sleeping
959780	963820	around, especially if you haven't done yours yet, because sometimes the twenties is kind
963820	970060	of dry for guys, her versus an early to mid 20 something girl who wants to settle down
970060	972380	right now, everything else being equal.
972380	973380	Who would that guy choose?
973380	975620	Most of the time it's going to be the 20 something girl, right?
975620	980300	Like there's a, there's a harsh calculus when it comes to talking about this sort of thing.
981620	986140	A nine, but can't satisfy you in the bedroom or two who is a five, but you have a great
986140	987140	sex life.
987140	989380	A nine, but can't satisfy you in the bedroom.
989380	994500	I feel like a lot of the answers of the women who are say less sexually experienced will
994500	999580	be one, but the ones who have actually had, you know, bad sexual encounters, it's going
999580	1000580	to be two.
1000580	1001580	Oh, guy number two.
1001580	1002580	For sure.
1002580	1003580	I'd say guy number two.
1003580	1004580	Yep.
1004580	1005580	Yep.
1005580	1006580	Yep.
1006580	1007580	Going with the five.
1007580	1008580	The five?
1008580	1009580	Great sex life, I guess.
1009580	1010580	Yeah.
1010580	1011580	Okay.
1011580	1013580	I'm going to go with the nine.
1013580	1014580	Okay.
1014580	1015580	Oh.
1015580	1018220	And not so great sex life.
1018220	1021700	I mean, I feel like those go hand in hand, so that's hard to answer.
1021700	1022700	No way it does.
1022700	1023700	Listen.
1023700	1024700	Listen.
1024700	1025700	Listen.
1025700	1026700	If you're like a, hold on.
1026700	1029940	If you're like a nine out of 10 or a 10 out of 10 guy getting, you know, just getting
1029940	1034100	by just based on off your looks, it's going to be very similar to the nine out of 10 or
1034100	1036460	10 out of 10 girl that just starfishes in bed.
1036460	1037460	You know?
1037460	1038460	You know what I mean?
1038460	1040760	Being good looking does not mean that you're good at having sex.
1040760	1043900	And then this one's a little bit different, but guy number one, who would be your husband
1043900	1050520	making 60,000 a year or guy number two, who would be a sugar daddy that gives you 15 tiamon.
1050520	1054540	If you're on Fresh and Fit or some other kind of red pill podcast, they're all going to
1054540	1056260	say that every girl chooses two.
1056260	1060340	Two, two, two, two, because it's a sign of status, you know, to be a part of a high value
1060340	1061340	man's harem.
1061340	1062660	But again, there's no way.
1062660	1063660	Absolutely not.
1063660	1064660	That's cope.
1064660	1065660	There was a study I read a few years ago.
1065660	1072220	It's called, but basically the idea was if you put together all else equal, you put together
1072220	1078740	a guy who has a lot of money, but no actual skills or ability to iterate like he inherited
1078740	1084180	his money basically versus a guy who has way less money, but he's highly competent.
1084180	1088120	Women tend to choose the competent guy because they see him again as an investment.
1088120	1091380	The whole women are attracted to money thing.
1091380	1093300	It's kind of true, but it's not quite true.
1093300	1099340	It's more like women are attracted to competence and money can be a sign of competence.
1099340	1102420	And even then they still want, you know, they still want exclusivity.
1102420	1103660	They still want to have a family.
1103660	1107460	It's not all about hypergamy and, you know, being part of the harem of a high value male.
1107460	1111780	That's that stuff's all, it happens like sometimes, but it's, it's largely nonsense.
1111780	1112780	The husband.
1112780	1113780	Yeah.
1113780	1117380	I'm not in all that stuff.
1117380	1119580	Guy number one, 60,000 isn't too bad.
1119580	1120580	Okay.
1120580	1121580	Okay.
1121580	1126300	The most talented loyal husband versus the sugar daddy side piece situation.
1126300	1128300	All right.
1128300	1135540	Ooh, that would be nice, but I think long-term probably guy number one.
1135540	1136540	Okay.
1136540	1137540	Yes.
1137540	1138540	Right.
1138540	1139540	That was, that was a bit spicy.
1139540	1140540	That one.
1140540	1141540	We're going to go with the husband.
1141540	1142540	She almost didn't take it.
1142540	1143540	Okay.
1143540	1144540	Family.
1144540	1145540	Perfect.
1145540	1146540	Yeah.
1146540	1147540	That's a really good question.
1147540	1148540	Oh man.
1148540	1149540	Okay.
1149540	1154300	So either husband making less or sugar daddy.
1154300	1155900	I think she wants to choose sugar daddy.
1155900	1158300	She doesn't want to say it, man.
1158300	1159300	Both good.
1159300	1161860	If you're, if you're taking this long, you want to say it.
1161860	1165860	It's what you want, but you don't want to say it.
1165860	1172540	Um, you know, I'm going to go with the husband to be honest.
1172540	1174620	I don't, I don't believe it.
1174620	1178060	So you choose the husband and the commitment versus a sugar daddy.
1178580	1179580	Yeah.
1179580	1180580	The husband.
1180580	1181580	Husband.
1181580	1182580	Yes.
1182580	1183580	Yeah.
1183580	1186700	Cause the sugar daddy, he's expecting something from you, you know, it's not just giving it.
1186700	1188900	All right guys, that is all I have for this video.
1188900	1192100	If you liked it or found it helpful, be sure to give it a thumbs up.
1192100	1193880	Do not do any of that.
1193880	1194880	Thumbs up mine instead.
1194880	1197580	Cause I don't even know who this fucking bitch is.
1197580	1200360	Hopefully now that I've watched this fucking thing, it'll stop popping up in my YouTube
1200360	1203100	recommendations every five fucking seconds.
1203100	1205420	One of the main reasons I wanted to watch this video though, aside from getting it out
1205420	1210520	of my notifications list is that like, I don't believe in the whole red pill thing.
1210520	1214380	I think the reason the red pill right now is blowing up online and like bread tube and
1214380	1218940	and left YouTube was like just collapsed and fallen by the wayside is because the red pillars,
1218940	1223380	they're talking about certain things that they are correct on and, and like more lefty
1223380	1224780	types just don't want to acknowledge it.
1224780	1226660	They're just going to call you like a misogynist or whatever.
1226660	1231340	If you, if you even dare talk about the problem, but even though they're correct in some limited
1231340	1236780	ways, they are ultimately wrong about relationships and about women.
1236780	1239900	Maybe I got to start looking more at this stuff because there's definitely like, there's
1239900	1242180	a very strange, how do I want to put this?
1242180	1243180	It's like, okay.
1243180	1246520	Like have you ever seen like that, that good looking dude, he's in like a good college
1246520	1247820	program or he has like a good job.
1247820	1249020	He's making good money.
1249020	1251260	He's like six foot two.
1251260	1252260	He's reasonably attractive.
1252260	1253460	And this guy's like black pill.
1253460	1254580	Like I'm never gonna find a girl, dude.
1254580	1258420	I'm never gonna, it's like, holy shit, what the fuck is happening to everyone that they're
1258420	1262820	all like self sabotaging and self-destructing like this.
1262820	1266000	Like I'm a five, seven fat guy.
1266000	1269140	I'm not attractive, but I still managed to get a girlfriend.
1269140	1270180	This is something that you can do.
1270180	1274220	You can have a meaningful relationship and you're not just fucking doomed.
1274220	1275220	Okay.
1275220	1279540	And I really think the doomerism of this community is kind of seeping out into the rest of the
1279540	1281020	internet and it's, it's not good.
1281020	1282020	It's not good guys.
1282020	1283820	Anyway, that's the video for today.
1283820	1285300	I have to get out of here.
1285300	1286300	My time is up.
1286300	1288140	I will see you guys next time.
1288140	1289620	I love you.
1289620	1294580	Oh God, I'm being recommended more videos now.
1294580	1295900	God fucking damn it.
