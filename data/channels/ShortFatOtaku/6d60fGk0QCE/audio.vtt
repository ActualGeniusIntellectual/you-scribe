00:00.000 --> 00:09.860
Alright guys, IRL is hitting me real hard, I've got no time for a video today.

00:09.860 --> 00:15.000
I keep seeing this clip from December of last year go viral and re-viral, it keeps popping

00:15.000 --> 00:16.880
up on the front page of YouTube for me.

00:16.880 --> 00:21.100
It's from Courtney Ryan, no clue who this is, which guy would women choose?

00:21.100 --> 00:27.020
I've been dipping my toes into some red pill stuff, not because I believe in it, I don't,

00:27.020 --> 00:29.960
but I do find it interesting to look at some of these communities that I'm not really part

00:29.960 --> 00:32.560
of on YouTube and in the streaming space.

00:32.560 --> 00:36.480
And I've got a spare 30 minutes, YouTube keeps recommending me this garbage, so I might as

00:36.480 --> 00:38.760
well finally give in and check it out.

00:38.760 --> 00:39.760
Let's go.

00:39.760 --> 00:42.720
Welcome back to my channel, if you're new here, I'm Courtney Ryan, and today we're playing

00:42.720 --> 00:45.840
a little game with a group of girls called Would You Rather.

00:45.840 --> 00:50.200
So what I do, I give them guy number one, and guy number two, and each guy comes with

00:50.200 --> 00:54.600
some baggage or some things going on, and they have to choose which guy that they would

00:54.600 --> 00:56.200
rather date.

00:56.200 --> 00:59.560
Sounds good to me, I've got all the baggage.

00:59.560 --> 01:04.160
Guy number one who makes 200k, but he struggles with infidelity and will have one to two affairs

01:04.160 --> 01:08.480
during your life together, or guy number two who makes 40k and is loyal.

01:08.480 --> 01:12.500
Oh, so the girls are gonna like choose between one of these two, okay, I see what's going

01:12.500 --> 01:13.500
on here.

01:13.500 --> 01:19.920
Hmm, $40,000 a year and is loyal versus $20,000 a year and has one to two affairs during their

01:19.920 --> 01:20.920
lifetime.

01:20.920 --> 01:26.020
That's an extra $160,000, like after a few years, that's like a house.

01:26.020 --> 01:29.060
This is a big, I know a lot of them are probably gonna choose the loyal one because that's

01:29.060 --> 01:33.060
what society expects, but I actually think that's a lot closer than that, because that's

01:33.060 --> 01:34.260
a lot of money.

01:34.260 --> 01:38.500
I'll do guy number two, guy number one.

01:38.500 --> 01:41.180
At least she's honest.

01:41.180 --> 01:46.460
The 40k and is loyal, obviously, well, for me, obviously.

01:46.460 --> 01:48.820
That is, that's an easy one.

01:48.820 --> 01:53.540
I guess I'll say the guy number two because I couldn't deal with infidelity no matter

01:53.540 --> 01:54.940
how much money you make.

01:54.940 --> 01:55.940
Loyal.

01:55.940 --> 01:58.820
I would choose $40,000 and loyal.

01:59.060 --> 02:00.580
Loyalty important to you.

02:00.580 --> 02:01.580
Mm-hmm.

02:01.580 --> 02:02.580
Okay.

02:02.580 --> 02:05.180
Definitely the guy who makes 40k and is loyal.

02:05.180 --> 02:08.220
I can already hear all the red pillars saying, no, this is all fake, but they're all gonna

02:08.220 --> 02:13.340
choose the high value male who has more money but cheats sometimes and it's like, in actuality,

02:13.340 --> 02:15.380
no, most women aren't like that.

02:15.380 --> 02:18.580
Most women view their partners as investments.

02:18.580 --> 02:23.940
That's why the whole I can fix him thing is so prevalent and also why women have such

02:23.940 --> 02:28.420
a hard time leaving abusive partners, because they feel like they can invest in a man who

02:28.420 --> 02:29.900
will then produce for them.

02:29.900 --> 02:33.180
The whole alpha male harem status thing.

02:33.180 --> 02:37.340
That's not nearly as common as red pillars like to believe it is.

02:37.340 --> 02:43.140
Next one here is guy number one who is 50 pounds overweight and makes 120k or guy number

02:43.140 --> 02:48.420
two who is fit, nice arms, six pack, great endurance and makes 35k.

02:48.420 --> 02:51.100
Oh, I wonder.

02:51.100 --> 02:52.460
This one's a bit tougher, isn't it?

02:52.460 --> 02:56.780
Because you could lose the 50 pounds and then keep your 120k.

02:56.780 --> 02:59.580
Also, this does say something with their personalities, though, doesn't it?

02:59.580 --> 03:03.100
Because if you're like, you're 50 pounds overweight versus being in shape, that shows like certain

03:03.100 --> 03:05.300
types of habits and your habits are your personality.

03:05.300 --> 03:07.580
So like, um, you could also make more money too.

03:07.580 --> 03:08.580
I don't know.

03:08.580 --> 03:09.580
I don't know about this.

03:09.580 --> 03:10.580
Oh, my God.

03:10.580 --> 03:11.580
Oh, Jesus Christ.

03:11.580 --> 03:12.580
Guy number one.

03:12.580 --> 03:13.580
I'll take the first guy.

03:13.580 --> 03:14.580
Yeah, 35k.

03:14.580 --> 03:15.580
That's like McDonald's.

03:15.580 --> 03:16.580
I'll go with number one.

03:16.580 --> 03:17.580
35k is McDonald's?

03:17.580 --> 03:19.580
Listen, this woman is too good looking to be working retail.

03:19.580 --> 03:22.580
Maybe she actually does think 35k is McDonald's.

03:22.580 --> 03:23.580
What the fuck?

03:23.580 --> 03:27.580
$15 an hour times 40 hours a week.

03:27.580 --> 03:30.580
You're not getting 40 at a part time job, let's just say.

03:30.580 --> 03:33.580
$600 a week times 52.

03:33.580 --> 03:35.580
Making $31,000.

03:35.580 --> 03:39.580
If you have 15 minimum, you're making $31,000 at McDonald's.

03:39.580 --> 03:40.580
Jesus.

03:40.580 --> 03:42.580
Of course, you're not getting 15 minimum at 40 hours a week.

03:42.580 --> 03:44.580
There's not going to be a lot of money.

03:44.580 --> 03:46.580
There's not going to be a lot of money.

03:46.580 --> 03:47.580
Jesus.

03:47.580 --> 03:49.580
Of course, you're not getting 15 minimum at 40 hours a week.

03:49.580 --> 03:50.580
There's no fucking way.

03:50.580 --> 03:56.580
Unless you're a McDonald's manager or something, you're getting shitty 8 to 1s or 1 to 5s or

03:56.580 --> 03:58.580
7 to 10s or something.

03:58.580 --> 03:59.580
These garbage tier shifts.

03:59.580 --> 04:01.580
That's what part time work is like.

04:01.580 --> 04:02.580
At least that's what it was like when I was younger.

04:02.580 --> 04:04.580
I haven't worked in retail in a long time.

04:04.580 --> 04:09.580
That's hard because I don't really value money or...

04:09.580 --> 04:11.580
Well, I guess I value health.

04:11.580 --> 04:13.580
You've got to value something.

04:13.580 --> 04:15.580
I guess I would say the fit guy.

04:15.580 --> 04:16.580
Okay.

04:16.580 --> 04:19.580
Because I care about health, like physical health, because I think it...

04:19.580 --> 04:21.580
It's just like your well-being.

04:21.580 --> 04:24.580
Yeah, I guess that one.

04:24.580 --> 04:27.580
I think being fit is important.

04:27.580 --> 04:30.580
I want a guy who takes care of his health.

04:30.580 --> 04:35.580
50 pounds overweight is really not that bad, especially if...

04:35.580 --> 04:36.580
There's still hope, guys.

04:36.580 --> 04:37.580
There's still hope.

04:37.580 --> 04:42.580
I have a more active lifestyle, so I wouldn't mind helping him be more active.

04:42.580 --> 04:43.580
50 pounds is not that bad.

04:43.580 --> 04:48.580
Guy number one who is a three and has a boat and a second home that's an oceanfront condo,

04:48.580 --> 04:52.580
or guy number two who is an eight but lives at home with his parents.

04:52.580 --> 04:53.580
Oh my God.

04:53.580 --> 04:57.580
Number one has so much more going for him, but he's a three.

04:57.580 --> 04:59.580
What is a three out of 10?

04:59.580 --> 05:03.580
We're talking deformities, lost an eye, scarring, lost a limb.

05:03.580 --> 05:04.580
What are we talking about here?

05:04.580 --> 05:05.580
We're talking about three.

05:05.580 --> 05:07.580
Like morbidly obese.

05:07.580 --> 05:08.580
Three is bad.

05:08.580 --> 05:09.580
That's a lot of money though.

05:09.580 --> 05:11.580
A boat, second home.

05:11.580 --> 05:13.580
Yeah, three is like a Harvey Weinstein or something.

05:13.580 --> 05:14.580
Hold on.

05:14.580 --> 05:16.580
Minus the allegations.

05:16.580 --> 05:18.580
Probably the first one.

05:18.580 --> 05:19.580
Okay.

05:19.580 --> 05:21.580
Just because he's doing better in his life.

05:21.580 --> 05:22.580
Okay.

05:22.580 --> 05:23.580
Fair enough.

05:23.580 --> 05:25.580
I'm not really good for appearances.

05:25.580 --> 05:30.580
I care about physical health, but other than just being healthy, I mean, you don't have

05:30.580 --> 05:35.580
to be super fit or attractive just as long as you're taking care of yourself.

05:35.580 --> 05:37.580
A three though, dude?

05:37.580 --> 05:39.580
... areas of his life.

05:39.580 --> 05:41.580
Oh, that's a good one.

05:41.580 --> 05:43.580
We're talking like deformities at that point.

05:43.580 --> 05:47.580
Probably the eight who lives at home with his parents, especially in times like these.

05:47.580 --> 05:50.580
If he's saving his money...

05:50.580 --> 05:52.580
Just blame on COVID, dude.

05:52.580 --> 05:55.580
I mean, obviously it would be better if a guy had his own place.

05:57.580 --> 05:58.580
Got number one.

05:58.580 --> 05:59.580
All right.

05:59.580 --> 06:03.580
Whenever I see this woman, she always looks like she's about to get her hair cut the way

06:03.580 --> 06:04.580
she's dressed.

06:04.580 --> 06:05.580
I'd say the second guy.

06:05.580 --> 06:06.580
Okay.

06:06.580 --> 06:08.580
Because that doesn't have to be forever.

06:08.580 --> 06:09.580
And how old are you?

06:09.580 --> 06:10.580
I'm 28.

06:10.580 --> 06:11.580
28.

06:11.580 --> 06:16.580
So is there an age where living at home with the parents would be a deal breaker for you?

06:16.580 --> 06:21.580
I'd say life happens and if you need help, you need help.

06:21.580 --> 06:27.580
But typically by the time we're 30, maybe it's time to get on out of there.

06:27.580 --> 06:28.580
All right.

06:28.580 --> 06:30.580
You don't want to be bringing home girls to your parents' house.

06:30.580 --> 06:31.580
That's weird.

06:31.580 --> 06:32.580
I knew a few.

06:32.580 --> 06:36.580
They weren't 30, but I knew a few guys who did that in their late 20s and it's like,

06:36.580 --> 06:37.580
oof, dude.

06:37.580 --> 06:38.580
All right.

06:38.580 --> 06:42.580
Guy number one who is 5'4", 5'4", and makes 250K a year.

06:42.580 --> 06:46.580
Or guy number two who is 6'2", and makes 70K a year.

06:46.580 --> 06:47.580
Ooh.

06:47.580 --> 06:50.580
As a kind of short guy, this one's rough.

06:50.580 --> 06:55.580
I'm 5'7", Naomi's 5'1", so we ended up working out well in terms of height.

06:55.580 --> 07:00.580
Before Naomi, I dated two Asian girls who were also both pretty short.

07:00.580 --> 07:04.580
I've never had any luck with any girls that were as tall as me or taller.

07:04.580 --> 07:06.580
And I know the play to the short man.

07:06.580 --> 07:07.580
I'm not super short.

07:07.580 --> 07:09.580
I'm not like 5'4", 5'2".

07:09.580 --> 07:11.580
There are some guys I've seen walking around.

07:11.580 --> 07:12.580
It's like, Jesus, dude, I'm sorry.

07:12.580 --> 07:14.580
But 5'7", that's not bad.

07:14.580 --> 07:18.580
It is below average, but it's still workable in terms of finding girls.

07:18.580 --> 07:21.580
But yeah, 5'4", versus 6'2".

07:21.580 --> 07:23.580
250 versus 70,000.

07:23.580 --> 07:24.580
Hmm.

07:24.580 --> 07:30.580
70,000 is still enough to live a pretty decent life in a lot of places, so I think the girls

07:30.580 --> 07:32.580
are going to overwhelmingly choose 6'2".

07:33.580 --> 07:37.580
You know, the reason so many guys lie about being 6' when they're actually like 5'11",

07:37.580 --> 07:40.580
sometimes, Dave, is because they know the power of the 6'0".

07:40.580 --> 07:43.580
You know what I mean, when it comes to dating apps or whatever?

07:43.580 --> 07:45.580
So yeah, that's what I think.

07:45.580 --> 07:48.580
Well, I'm 5'10", so 5'4'' is a little too short for me.

07:48.580 --> 07:52.580
I mean, if you're 5'4'' and you're super confident, that's really sexy.

07:52.580 --> 07:53.580
Fair enough, fair enough.

07:53.580 --> 07:54.580
Sometimes there are tall girls out there.

07:54.580 --> 07:58.580
5'4'' is, like I said, I'm 5'10", so 5'4'' is a little too short for me.

07:58.580 --> 07:59.580
I'd prefer a taller guy.

07:59.580 --> 08:01.580
5'4'' 200,000.

08:01.580 --> 08:02.580
250.

08:02.580 --> 08:03.580
Oh, 250.

08:03.580 --> 08:05.580
Or 6'2'' and make 70.

08:08.580 --> 08:09.580
You might go for the 6'2'' guy.

08:09.580 --> 08:10.580
6'2''?

08:10.580 --> 08:11.580
How tall are you?

08:11.580 --> 08:12.580
I'm 5'1".

08:12.580 --> 08:13.580
Jesus!

08:13.580 --> 08:17.580
Even though the 5'4'' is still taller than you, you would still choose the 6'2'' making

08:17.580 --> 08:18.580
less money.

08:18.580 --> 08:21.580
Okay, now we're getting, now we're getting black-pilled guys.

08:21.580 --> 08:22.580
6'2'' guy?

08:22.580 --> 08:23.580
Yeah.

08:23.580 --> 08:24.580
How tall are you?

08:24.580 --> 08:25.580
Yep, black-pilled.

08:25.580 --> 08:26.580
5'6".

08:26.580 --> 08:27.580
Okay.

08:27.580 --> 08:28.580
Oh, guy number two.

08:29.580 --> 08:30.580
How tall are you?

08:30.580 --> 08:31.580
5'1''.

08:31.580 --> 08:33.580
Oh my gosh, so you would still choose the 6'2'' guy?

08:33.580 --> 08:34.580
I had a feeling she would.

08:34.580 --> 08:35.580
Oh, for sure.

08:35.580 --> 08:36.580
My boyfriend's 6'4''.

08:36.580 --> 08:37.580
Jesus Christ!

08:37.580 --> 08:38.580
Oh my gosh.

08:38.580 --> 08:39.580
Okay, so...

08:39.580 --> 08:40.580
This chick's getting impaled!

08:40.580 --> 08:42.580
...than the guy who makes more money.

08:42.580 --> 08:43.580
Yeah.

08:43.580 --> 08:44.580
Okay.

08:44.580 --> 08:47.580
And what is it about the tall factor that stands out to you?

08:47.580 --> 08:51.580
I just feel like taller guys, I'll feel more protected because I'm so short.

08:51.580 --> 08:54.580
I want a guy where if we're out in like a...

08:54.580 --> 08:55.580
Okay, that's BS, alright?

08:55.580 --> 08:56.580
Listen, listen, listen.

08:56.580 --> 09:01.580
I know lots of girls say this, they wanna feel protected by a larger guy, a taller guy,

09:01.580 --> 09:02.580
but that's like...

09:02.580 --> 09:03.580
How do you think it's gonna play out?

09:03.580 --> 09:06.580
Like if you're getting mugged, the mugger pulls out like a gun, are you gonna use it

09:06.580 --> 09:07.580
as like a body shield?

09:07.580 --> 09:09.580
Like, what are you talking about here?

09:09.580 --> 09:14.580
I don't think tall guys are actually able to meaningfully protect you all that more

09:14.580 --> 09:15.580
than short guys.

09:15.580 --> 09:19.580
Unless we're talking purely hand-to-hand with no weapons and even like, when's that

09:19.580 --> 09:20.580
gonna happen?

09:20.580 --> 09:24.580
And even then, you might have a guy who's like trained in martial arts, but even then

09:24.580 --> 09:28.580
it's like such wild cover of dime store smut thinking.

09:28.580 --> 09:29.580
You know what I mean?

09:29.580 --> 09:33.580
What's actually going on here is you just like the look of taller guys, that's it.

09:33.580 --> 09:36.580
The actual protection thing, lots of people say that's part of it, but it's not really

09:36.580 --> 09:38.580
part of it, it just feels like it's part of it, you know what I mean?

09:38.580 --> 09:40.580
I don't know if I'm making any sense here.

09:40.580 --> 09:41.580
Maybe 6'2".

09:41.580 --> 09:42.580
Okay, and how tall are you?

09:42.580 --> 09:43.580
I'm 5'2".

09:43.580 --> 09:44.580
Okay.

09:44.580 --> 09:45.580
So I guess I can't be too picky.

09:45.580 --> 09:46.580
Right.

09:46.580 --> 09:49.580
But if you had to choose, you would choose the taller guy versus the guy who makes more

09:49.580 --> 09:50.580
money?

09:50.580 --> 09:51.580
Maybe, yes.

09:51.580 --> 09:52.580
Okay.

09:52.580 --> 09:53.580
Damn.

09:53.580 --> 09:54.580
Okay.

09:54.580 --> 09:55.580
How tall are you?

09:55.580 --> 09:56.580
5'3".

09:56.580 --> 09:57.580
Oh, okay.

09:57.580 --> 09:58.580
Oh my god.

09:58.580 --> 09:59.980
So if you were still taller than you, you would still choose the really tall guy.

09:59.980 --> 10:00.980
All the short kings.

10:00.980 --> 10:01.980
I'm always in heels.

10:01.980 --> 10:02.980
Taking black pills.

10:02.980 --> 10:03.980
I'm going to be taller than him.

10:03.980 --> 10:04.980
Okay.

10:04.980 --> 10:08.380
Next one is guy number one who is a four, but pays for everything, is a provider and

10:08.380 --> 10:12.300
you don't have to work, or guy number two who is a 10, but you're the breadwinner.

10:12.300 --> 10:14.140
Oh, this one's gotta be number one, right?

10:14.140 --> 10:19.420
I hear so much from women, even like, not even like trad women, just all types of women.

10:19.420 --> 10:21.940
They're like, man, I would love to spend more time at home.

10:21.940 --> 10:22.940
That's so common nowadays.

10:23.300 --> 10:25.340
I think the answer has to be one.

10:25.340 --> 10:26.340
One.

10:26.340 --> 10:27.340
Yeah.

10:27.340 --> 10:28.340
Yeah, of course.

10:28.340 --> 10:29.340
Oh, for sure guy number one.

10:29.340 --> 10:30.340
Yeah.

10:30.340 --> 10:31.340
Yeah, I'm right here.

10:31.340 --> 10:32.340
You don't want to be the breadwinner?

10:32.340 --> 10:33.340
I don't mind being the breadwinner.

10:33.340 --> 10:34.340
So I'll say the 10.

10:34.340 --> 10:35.340
Okay.

10:35.340 --> 10:36.340
And I still make up for it.

10:36.340 --> 10:37.340
Oh, damn.

10:37.340 --> 10:40.100
So attraction to the person, in this case, would be more important to you.

10:40.100 --> 10:41.100
The queen.

10:41.100 --> 10:42.100
Than the money.

10:42.100 --> 10:43.100
Yes.

10:43.100 --> 10:44.100
Okay.

10:44.100 --> 10:45.100
The first one.

10:45.100 --> 10:46.100
Okay.

10:46.100 --> 10:51.660
Yeah, like I said, I don't really care about looks, but also I'm kind of like old fashioned

10:51.660 --> 10:55.140
and like, I kind of do think that a man has this, like men and women have certain roles

10:55.140 --> 11:01.180
and yeah, I think a man should like kind of be more financially stable, I guess in like

11:01.180 --> 11:02.180
a committed relationship.

11:02.180 --> 11:03.180
Yeah.

11:03.180 --> 11:04.740
Like as opposed to the woman being the breadwinner.

11:04.740 --> 11:07.020
Also, I have a lot of like passions and hobbies.

11:07.020 --> 11:10.980
So I think that'd be really cool if I could just stay home and pursue them.

11:10.980 --> 11:16.980
Dude, everyone has passions and hobbies that they want to stay home and pursue.

11:16.980 --> 11:19.620
Like, are you, are you kidding me?

11:19.620 --> 11:22.620
This is just, this is literally fun to my lifestyle shit.

11:22.620 --> 11:26.420
It's kind of strange because like, this is the kind of thing that red pillars want, right?

11:26.420 --> 11:30.340
They want, they want that trad wife to stay at home and, and take care of the house.

11:30.340 --> 11:33.180
That's like, Jesus, aren't you just cucking out to them in a sense?

11:33.180 --> 11:36.700
Because you're off slaving away nine to five shitty job.

11:36.700 --> 11:37.860
They're at home having all the fun.

11:37.860 --> 11:41.180
They're like hanging out with people, they're, they're, they're doing all things they love.

11:41.180 --> 11:45.580
Like, damn, I don't know about you guys, but I want my woman working.

11:45.580 --> 11:47.040
I want her making some fucking money.

11:47.040 --> 11:53.200
Guy number one, who is 54 years old, making 170,000 a year or guy number two, who is 30

11:53.200 --> 11:55.600
making 45,000 a year.

11:55.600 --> 11:59.400
Oh my God, 54.

11:59.400 --> 12:00.920
That's a huge age gap.

12:00.920 --> 12:03.480
Like these girls look like they're in their twenties mainly, right?

12:03.480 --> 12:06.220
Like 54.

12:06.220 --> 12:09.440
Also you have to take into account the fact that you make more money generally as you

12:09.440 --> 12:10.440
get older.

12:10.440 --> 12:15.680
So the 30 year old guy making 45 might actually be making 170 when he's 54.

12:15.960 --> 12:18.760
Like there's, there's a return on investment here.

12:18.760 --> 12:19.760
It's gotta be number two.

12:19.760 --> 12:24.080
Like, I know there's that meme of like the late teens, early twenties girl who's like

12:24.080 --> 12:27.300
fucking around with 45 year old, 50 year old guys.

12:27.300 --> 12:31.520
She's having sex with all of her dad's friends and stuff and it's all real weird and awkward.

12:31.520 --> 12:33.680
But like that can't be that common, right?

12:33.680 --> 12:35.200
See I don't really care much about age.

12:35.200 --> 12:39.400
I've, I've dated guys who are like older than me and stuff.

12:39.400 --> 12:40.800
What's the oldest guy you dated?

12:40.800 --> 12:43.480
I gotta think.

12:43.480 --> 12:44.480
Somewhere in their forties.

12:44.480 --> 12:49.320
I don't think I've gotten up to 50 before, but um, so I don't care about that.

12:49.320 --> 12:59.080
But also I does it, is it dating or marrying?

12:59.080 --> 13:01.040
Just whatever you want for yourself.

13:01.040 --> 13:03.000
If you're dating, I guess it doesn't really matter.

13:03.000 --> 13:08.760
I guess I would pick the older one cause he makes, that sounds superficial, but for marrying

13:08.760 --> 13:12.120
probably the younger one just cause we're more, wait, didn't she say she didn't care

13:12.120 --> 13:13.200
about money before?

13:13.200 --> 13:15.840
I would prefer a guy closer to my age.

13:15.840 --> 13:19.920
I don't think the 54 year old would, if he's like my dad's age, I think that would be a

13:19.920 --> 13:22.360
little strange for me personally.

13:22.360 --> 13:26.120
I mean some girls are into that, but probably the 30 year old.

13:26.120 --> 13:28.680
I've given myself about a 10 year gap.

13:28.680 --> 13:29.680
Okay.

13:29.680 --> 13:30.680
And that's pretty normal.

13:30.680 --> 13:31.680
I've noticed too.

13:31.680 --> 13:32.680
I would do the younger one.

13:32.680 --> 13:33.680
Younger one.

13:33.680 --> 13:35.720
What is the like age cap for you?

13:35.720 --> 13:38.400
Like what is the oldest guy that you would date?

13:39.120 --> 13:42.160
Um, this is a girl that I went to university with.

13:42.160 --> 13:46.680
I wonder if it's her, if she's anything like she was back in school, that, uh, that danger

13:46.680 --> 13:49.000
hair look she's got really fits.

13:49.000 --> 13:52.680
I think early thirties.

13:52.680 --> 13:53.680
Okay.

13:53.680 --> 13:54.680
Yes.

13:54.680 --> 13:55.680
Okay.

13:55.680 --> 13:57.480
Guy number two, not into older men.

13:57.480 --> 13:58.480
Okay.

13:58.480 --> 14:00.360
What is the oldest guy that you would date?

14:00.360 --> 14:03.760
I would date a guy who may be at most 10 years older than me.

14:03.760 --> 14:04.760
Okay.

14:04.760 --> 14:05.760
And you said you're 21.

14:05.760 --> 14:06.760
Okay.

14:06.760 --> 14:07.760
Hold on.

14:07.760 --> 14:08.760
Hold on, dude.

14:08.760 --> 14:13.560
21 would date a 31 year old man, but you're not into older guys.

14:13.560 --> 14:16.120
I mean, not into 50 year old older guys.

14:16.120 --> 14:17.120
Fair enough.

14:17.120 --> 14:20.160
But like a 10 year age gap is still, it's still like a, it's still a reasonably big

14:20.160 --> 14:21.160
age gap, man.

14:21.160 --> 14:23.960
Like I know that Naomi's 10 years younger than me.

14:23.960 --> 14:28.040
I know for example, Sargon's wife is 10 years younger than him.

14:28.040 --> 14:30.560
Dave's girlfriend is like eight years younger.

14:30.560 --> 14:35.320
Um, Medicare Jim's, uh, girl Jade is 10 years younger.

14:35.320 --> 14:40.600
Like a 10 year age gap seems to be pretty common nowadays actually.

14:40.600 --> 14:48.920
Um, and like why, if, if a mid thirties guy can pull a mid twenties girl, why, why wouldn't

14:48.920 --> 14:52.440
he, you know, I've actually heard from a lot of women my age, in fact, some of them from

14:52.440 --> 14:56.080
my high school year who have said, why are you dating someone who's 10 years younger

14:56.080 --> 14:57.080
than you?

14:58.080 --> 15:03.800
The 10 year age gap just seems to be, it seems to be becoming more and more common because

15:03.800 --> 15:05.560
frankly millennial women are awful, man.

15:05.560 --> 15:06.880
I don't want to date millennial women.

15:06.880 --> 15:08.200
I'm happy dating a Zoomer.

15:08.200 --> 15:12.500
And meanwhile, you got like these early 20 somethings who unlike some of their peers

15:12.500 --> 15:16.800
are actually willing to settle down early and they can actually grab say an early thirties

15:16.800 --> 15:20.640
guy who is looking for a longterm relationship, right?

15:20.640 --> 15:26.020
It's a weird dynamic happening right now where some girls will refuse to settle down in their

15:26.020 --> 15:30.660
twenties, try to settle down in their thirties and then realize that the guys that they were

15:30.660 --> 15:34.980
fucking around with, who are around the same age as them, aren't interested in them anymore

15:34.980 --> 15:39.100
because now they can pull the next bunch of 20 somethings coming up.

15:39.100 --> 15:43.020
And if those 20 somethings actually want a stable relationship within the 30 year old

15:43.020 --> 15:44.020
girls out of luck, right?

15:44.020 --> 15:45.660
Now I'm not saying it's fucking hopeless for these women.

15:45.660 --> 15:50.620
I'm not going, you know, full black pill, empty egg cart and stuff and molyneux tier

15:50.620 --> 15:51.620
stuff here.

15:51.740 --> 15:55.580
What I'm saying though, is if you're in like your early thirties and your mid thirties

15:55.580 --> 15:59.780
and you have the option between a woman who is around your age and who has done her sleeping

15:59.780 --> 16:03.820
around, especially if you haven't done yours yet, because sometimes the twenties is kind

16:03.820 --> 16:10.060
of dry for guys, her versus an early to mid 20 something girl who wants to settle down

16:10.060 --> 16:12.380
right now, everything else being equal.

16:12.380 --> 16:13.380
Who would that guy choose?

16:13.380 --> 16:15.620
Most of the time it's going to be the 20 something girl, right?

16:15.620 --> 16:20.300
Like there's a, there's a harsh calculus when it comes to talking about this sort of thing.

16:21.620 --> 16:26.140
A nine, but can't satisfy you in the bedroom or two who is a five, but you have a great

16:26.140 --> 16:27.140
sex life.

16:27.140 --> 16:29.380
A nine, but can't satisfy you in the bedroom.

16:29.380 --> 16:34.500
I feel like a lot of the answers of the women who are say less sexually experienced will

16:34.500 --> 16:39.580
be one, but the ones who have actually had, you know, bad sexual encounters, it's going

16:39.580 --> 16:40.580
to be two.

16:40.580 --> 16:41.580
Oh, guy number two.

16:41.580 --> 16:42.580
For sure.

16:42.580 --> 16:43.580
I'd say guy number two.

16:43.580 --> 16:44.580
Yep.

16:44.580 --> 16:45.580
Yep.

16:45.580 --> 16:46.580
Yep.

16:46.580 --> 16:47.580
Going with the five.

16:47.580 --> 16:48.580
The five?

16:48.580 --> 16:49.580
Great sex life, I guess.

16:49.580 --> 16:50.580
Yeah.

16:50.580 --> 16:51.580
Okay.

16:51.580 --> 16:53.580
I'm going to go with the nine.

16:53.580 --> 16:54.580
Okay.

16:54.580 --> 16:55.580
Oh.

16:55.580 --> 16:58.220
And not so great sex life.

16:58.220 --> 17:01.700
I mean, I feel like those go hand in hand, so that's hard to answer.

17:01.700 --> 17:02.700
No way it does.

17:02.700 --> 17:03.700
Listen.

17:03.700 --> 17:04.700
Listen.

17:04.700 --> 17:05.700
Listen.

17:05.700 --> 17:06.700
If you're like a, hold on.

17:06.700 --> 17:09.940
If you're like a nine out of 10 or a 10 out of 10 guy getting, you know, just getting

17:09.940 --> 17:14.100
by just based on off your looks, it's going to be very similar to the nine out of 10 or

17:14.100 --> 17:16.460
10 out of 10 girl that just starfishes in bed.

17:16.460 --> 17:17.460
You know?

17:17.460 --> 17:18.460
You know what I mean?

17:18.460 --> 17:20.760
Being good looking does not mean that you're good at having sex.

17:20.760 --> 17:23.900
And then this one's a little bit different, but guy number one, who would be your husband

17:23.900 --> 17:30.520
making 60,000 a year or guy number two, who would be a sugar daddy that gives you 15 tiamon.

17:30.520 --> 17:34.540
If you're on Fresh and Fit or some other kind of red pill podcast, they're all going to

17:34.540 --> 17:36.260
say that every girl chooses two.

17:36.260 --> 17:40.340
Two, two, two, two, because it's a sign of status, you know, to be a part of a high value

17:40.340 --> 17:41.340
man's harem.

17:41.340 --> 17:42.660
But again, there's no way.

17:42.660 --> 17:43.660
Absolutely not.

17:43.660 --> 17:44.660
That's cope.

17:44.660 --> 17:45.660
There was a study I read a few years ago.

17:45.660 --> 17:52.220
It's called, but basically the idea was if you put together all else equal, you put together

17:52.220 --> 17:58.740
a guy who has a lot of money, but no actual skills or ability to iterate like he inherited

17:58.740 --> 18:04.180
his money basically versus a guy who has way less money, but he's highly competent.

18:04.180 --> 18:08.120
Women tend to choose the competent guy because they see him again as an investment.

18:08.120 --> 18:11.380
The whole women are attracted to money thing.

18:11.380 --> 18:13.300
It's kind of true, but it's not quite true.

18:13.300 --> 18:19.340
It's more like women are attracted to competence and money can be a sign of competence.

18:19.340 --> 18:22.420
And even then they still want, you know, they still want exclusivity.

18:22.420 --> 18:23.660
They still want to have a family.

18:23.660 --> 18:27.460
It's not all about hypergamy and, you know, being part of the harem of a high value male.

18:27.460 --> 18:31.780
That's that stuff's all, it happens like sometimes, but it's, it's largely nonsense.

18:31.780 --> 18:32.780
The husband.

18:32.780 --> 18:33.780
Yeah.

18:33.780 --> 18:37.380
I'm not in all that stuff.

18:37.380 --> 18:39.580
Guy number one, 60,000 isn't too bad.

18:39.580 --> 18:40.580
Okay.

18:40.580 --> 18:41.580
Okay.

18:41.580 --> 18:46.300
The most talented loyal husband versus the sugar daddy side piece situation.

18:46.300 --> 18:48.300
All right.

18:48.300 --> 18:55.540
Ooh, that would be nice, but I think long-term probably guy number one.

18:55.540 --> 18:56.540
Okay.

18:56.540 --> 18:57.540
Yes.

18:57.540 --> 18:58.540
Right.

18:58.540 --> 18:59.540
That was, that was a bit spicy.

18:59.540 --> 19:00.540
That one.

19:00.540 --> 19:01.540
We're going to go with the husband.

19:01.540 --> 19:02.540
She almost didn't take it.

19:02.540 --> 19:03.540
Okay.

19:03.540 --> 19:04.540
Family.

19:04.540 --> 19:05.540
Perfect.

19:05.540 --> 19:06.540
Yeah.

19:06.540 --> 19:07.540
That's a really good question.

19:07.540 --> 19:08.540
Oh man.

19:08.540 --> 19:09.540
Okay.

19:09.540 --> 19:14.300
So either husband making less or sugar daddy.

19:14.300 --> 19:15.900
I think she wants to choose sugar daddy.

19:15.900 --> 19:18.300
She doesn't want to say it, man.

19:18.300 --> 19:19.300
Both good.

19:19.300 --> 19:21.860
If you're, if you're taking this long, you want to say it.

19:21.860 --> 19:25.860
It's what you want, but you don't want to say it.

19:25.860 --> 19:32.540
Um, you know, I'm going to go with the husband to be honest.

19:32.540 --> 19:34.620
I don't, I don't believe it.

19:34.620 --> 19:38.060
So you choose the husband and the commitment versus a sugar daddy.

19:38.580 --> 19:39.580
Yeah.

19:39.580 --> 19:40.580
The husband.

19:40.580 --> 19:41.580
Husband.

19:41.580 --> 19:42.580
Yes.

19:42.580 --> 19:43.580
Yeah.

19:43.580 --> 19:46.700
Cause the sugar daddy, he's expecting something from you, you know, it's not just giving it.

19:46.700 --> 19:48.900
All right guys, that is all I have for this video.

19:48.900 --> 19:52.100
If you liked it or found it helpful, be sure to give it a thumbs up.

19:52.100 --> 19:53.880
Do not do any of that.

19:53.880 --> 19:54.880
Thumbs up mine instead.

19:54.880 --> 19:57.580
Cause I don't even know who this fucking bitch is.

19:57.580 --> 20:00.360
Hopefully now that I've watched this fucking thing, it'll stop popping up in my YouTube

20:00.360 --> 20:03.100
recommendations every five fucking seconds.

20:03.100 --> 20:05.420
One of the main reasons I wanted to watch this video though, aside from getting it out

20:05.420 --> 20:10.520
of my notifications list is that like, I don't believe in the whole red pill thing.

20:10.520 --> 20:14.380
I think the reason the red pill right now is blowing up online and like bread tube and

20:14.380 --> 20:18.940
and left YouTube was like just collapsed and fallen by the wayside is because the red pillars,

20:18.940 --> 20:23.380
they're talking about certain things that they are correct on and, and like more lefty

20:23.380 --> 20:24.780
types just don't want to acknowledge it.

20:24.780 --> 20:26.660
They're just going to call you like a misogynist or whatever.

20:26.660 --> 20:31.340
If you, if you even dare talk about the problem, but even though they're correct in some limited

20:31.340 --> 20:36.780
ways, they are ultimately wrong about relationships and about women.

20:36.780 --> 20:39.900
Maybe I got to start looking more at this stuff because there's definitely like, there's

20:39.900 --> 20:42.180
a very strange, how do I want to put this?

20:42.180 --> 20:43.180
It's like, okay.

20:43.180 --> 20:46.520
Like have you ever seen like that, that good looking dude, he's in like a good college

20:46.520 --> 20:47.820
program or he has like a good job.

20:47.820 --> 20:49.020
He's making good money.

20:49.020 --> 20:51.260
He's like six foot two.

20:51.260 --> 20:52.260
He's reasonably attractive.

20:52.260 --> 20:53.460
And this guy's like black pill.

20:53.460 --> 20:54.580
Like I'm never gonna find a girl, dude.

20:54.580 --> 20:58.420
I'm never gonna, it's like, holy shit, what the fuck is happening to everyone that they're

20:58.420 --> 21:02.820
all like self sabotaging and self-destructing like this.

21:02.820 --> 21:06.000
Like I'm a five, seven fat guy.

21:06.000 --> 21:09.140
I'm not attractive, but I still managed to get a girlfriend.

21:09.140 --> 21:10.180
This is something that you can do.

21:10.180 --> 21:14.220
You can have a meaningful relationship and you're not just fucking doomed.

21:14.220 --> 21:15.220
Okay.

21:15.220 --> 21:19.540
And I really think the doomerism of this community is kind of seeping out into the rest of the

21:19.540 --> 21:21.020
internet and it's, it's not good.

21:21.020 --> 21:22.020
It's not good guys.

21:22.020 --> 21:23.820
Anyway, that's the video for today.

21:23.820 --> 21:25.300
I have to get out of here.

21:25.300 --> 21:26.300
My time is up.

21:26.300 --> 21:28.140
I will see you guys next time.

21:28.140 --> 21:29.620
I love you.

21:29.620 --> 21:34.580
Oh God, I'm being recommended more videos now.

21:34.580 --> 21:35.900
God fucking damn it.
