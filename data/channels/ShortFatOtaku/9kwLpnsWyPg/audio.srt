1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,880
So, if you're not Canadian, this will probably be news to you.

2
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:10,880
July 8th, 2022.

3
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:15,480
One week ago, the Canadian telecom company Rogers experienced a service outage.

4
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:18,360
Yes, this is what goes for newsworthy events in Canada.

5
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:20,000
It's even got its own Wikipedia page!

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,240
What makes it newsworthy, though, is the fact that Canada has one of the most over-regulated,

7
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:27,200
monopolistic and protected telecom markets in the world.

8
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:31,680
The big three companies, Rogers, Telus and Bell, control most of the market, with the

9
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:36,200
rest being divided by the middle-tier Shaw, which Rogers is currently trying to buy up,

10
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:39,960
and the few smaller regional competitors that are still somehow surviving.

11
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:44,800
As such, the Rogers outage affected 12 million people out of Canada's 38 million.

12
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:48,480
25% of Canada's total landmass lost internet connectivity.

13
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:54,120
Interac, the main electronic financial transactions service, was down nationwide as they use Rogers.

14
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:58,660
Their phone service was down, including emergency services, leading to one death that could

15
00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:02,200
have been prevented had the people at the scene been able to call 911.

16
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:07,480
Approximately 25% of Toronto's traffic signals stopped working as they used the Rogers wireless

17
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:10,060
network to communicate timing between intersections.

18
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:14,200
And the overall economic impact to the whole of Canada is currently estimated to be at

19
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:18,720
around $142 million, and rising as the outage isn't totally fixed yet.

20
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,640
I was still online because I use Bell.

21
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,400
And yeah, Bell sucks a big one, too, but they're the only provider in my area that

22
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,880
offers fiber optic internet, so what are you going to do?

23
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,360
In fact, that's how most of Canada feels.

24
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:30,300
They're the only provider, so what are you going to do?

25
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:32,320
Most places in Canada, you've got one option.

26
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:35,640
There's sometimes more options than the larger cities, to a point, but the market's

27
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:39,240
still extremely regulated, with little real room for actual competition.

28
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:43,320
And you can tell just how bad it is by looking at these prices, in Canadian dollars, of course.

29
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:48,480
An unlimited calling and texting cell phone plan with 12 gigs of data for just $115 a

30
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:54,440
month at Rogers, 15 gigs for $160 at Bell, oh man, $175, $125, look at these deals.

31
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:58,400
Meanwhile in Australia, it's, converted into Canadian dollars, $43 a month for a

32
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:02,360
cell phone plan with 30 gigs of data, $44 Canadian for 40 gigs of data.

33
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:08,360
In America, AT&T offers unlimited data for $91 Canadian, Virgin offers the same for $78.

34
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:12,840
In the UK, $54 Canadian for unlimited, $46, same thing, $41, same thing.

35
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:16,680
In India, it's the equivalent of $8, though that might not necessarily be the same, we're

36
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:18,600
not comparing first world nations anymore.

37
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:20,200
But I think the point is made.

38
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:23,300
Canadians are getting fucked by telecoms right now, to the point that it's actually cheaper

39
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:27,240
to get an American cell phone plan and pay roaming charges.

40
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:30,800
Regulation has a unique secondary role in Canada, the primary role being the same as

41
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:34,620
everywhere else, where the government imposes standards on private business, with the intention

42
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:38,600
of ensuring a specific level of quality, or widespread coverage, or safety, depending

43
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:39,600
on the industry.

44
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:42,640
This isn't automatically good or bad, it depends on what the regulation is, but it

45
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:47,480
almost always has the unfortunate side effect of raising the barrier of entry into the market.

46
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:51,520
If your new fledgling company with your new idea that'll disrupt the marketplace can't

47
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:55,640
afford the additional imposed cost of implementing the government regulation, your company is

48
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:56,940
not getting off the ground.

49
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:59,880
This leads to a lack of competition, which leads to a lack of innovation.

50
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:03,040
Companies become stagnant, they begin to monopolize the market, and once they're sufficiently

51
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:06,480
protected by government regulation, they begin to jack prices up, because what are you going

52
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:07,480
to do?

53
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:09,840
Now, as always, things aren't this simple all the time.

54
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:14,060
There are some industries that naturally trend towards monopolies, due to the particularities

55
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:18,080
of their specific market or product, and in that case, regulation to promote competition

56
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:20,080
and prevent monopolies can certainly be good.

57
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:23,800
And in other cases, markets that are highly competitive on their own may need to be regulated

58
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:29,120
for some other reason, since not everything we value can be best obtained by market forces.

59
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:34,060
But as a general rule, regulation, even necessary regulation, even regulation that we don't

60
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:37,860
want to do away with, represents an extra cost for business, which makes it harder for

61
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:41,360
new players to compete, giving the big corporations an advantage.

62
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:45,260
But as I said before, Canadian regulation serves a dual purpose, and the other one is

63
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:47,180
a strange form of Canadian protectionism.

64
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:50,740
Yes, every country wants to see their own businesses flourish, and not only have foreign

65
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:53,620
corpos come in and control everything, and Canada is no exception.

66
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:57,860
Uncharacteristically, compared to the world's generally free-trade loving liberal parties,

67
00:03:57,860 --> 00:04:02,020
the Canadian liberals have historically advocated for tariffs on certain protected Canadian

68
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:04,260
industries, even within such frameworks as NAFTA.

69
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:06,900
But there's also a cultural component to this conversation as well.

70
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:09,780
The Canadian government is extremely worried about the cultural powerhouse that is the

71
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:10,780
United States.

72
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:13,820
There's a fear, probably well-founded, that within a completely free market, Canadian

73
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:18,340
media would be absolutely dominated by American exports, American music, American TV shows,

74
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:19,340
American movies.

75
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:23,400
And so, the Canadian government always uses its regulatory powers to mandate that a percentage

76
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:28,620
of all broadcasted media in Canada is made in Canada by Canadians and about Canadians.

77
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:32,660
And this mandate has greatly empowered both the creators and the distributors of Canadian

78
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:36,960
media, with telecoms, whose infrastructure the media is being transmitted is on, playing

79
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:38,740
their part in that process.

80
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:40,780
Sometimes this protectionism can play a positive role.

81
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:45,340
For example, I recall it being kind of a fight to get Chinese-compromised Huawei tech out

82
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:49,220
of the telecom networks of the US and the UK, while in Canada, the make-it-in-Canada

83
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:50,700
message made that move a no-brainer.

84
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:54,340
Also, it's just funny to me that this sort of nativist, Canada-focused language comes

85
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:58,860
out of primarily our left-leaning parties, the liberals and the NDP, when if you swap

86
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:02,060
Canada out for America, it almost sounds Trumpian in a way.

87
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:05,240
But the telecom situation in Canada has been a known problem for years.

88
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:08,700
Nobody is actually happy with the way things are going, except for the companies themselves

89
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:11,740
who are making a killing, and the government, who is all too happy to use the powers of

90
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:14,220
a privately owned monopoly for its own purposes.

91
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:18,020
A marketplace that has been so heavily regulated and protected such that only a small group

92
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:21,580
of players are able to operate, is an industry where the government has only a small group

93
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:24,060
of players to deal with in order to achieve its goals.

94
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:27,900
And there is certainly a push within Canada for the government to exert more control over

95
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:29,900
the internet and telecommunications in general.

96
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:34,500
In 2018, an organization called Fairplay Canada popped up, which claims to be a coalition

97
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:39,420
of Canadian artists, content creators, unions, guilds, producers, performers, broadcasters,

98
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:43,440
distributors, and exhibitors who are asking the Canadian Radio, Television and Telecommunications

99
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:48,540
Commission, the CRTC, to take action to address the theft of digital content by illegal piracy

100
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:49,540
websites.

101
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:52,880
What this actually is, is an advocacy group headed up by a bunch of corpos, most notably

102
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:57,940
Bell & Rogers, two of Canada's big three telecoms, advocating for the government to grant private

103
00:05:57,940 --> 00:06:02,620
business the legal right to filter the internet in Canada to exclude pirated content.

104
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:05,580
And of course, there's no reason to believe that this power would stop there.

105
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:11,580
In 2019, a Canadian court ordered Canada's telecoms to block access to Gold TV, an IPTV

106
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:13,460
service that broadcasts around the world, including in Canada.

107
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:18,020
In case you don't know, IPTV is just regular television broadcast over the internet, rather

108
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:19,260
than over satellite or cable.

109
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:22,900
It's not the same as downloading content, nor is it the same as Netflix or YouTube,

110
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:26,400
where you choose a video or show or movie to stream, but rather it operates like traditional

111
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:29,200
TV, where you pick a channel, it just transmits over the internet.

112
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:33,040
But Canada's telecoms market, being protected from competition, hasn't felt any pressure

113
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:37,980
to move towards IPTV, even though it is the latest in TV technology, so Gold TV started

114
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:38,980
doing it on their own.

115
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:42,560
Where Gold TV fucked up, is that it never got permission from the channels it was broadcasting

116
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,380
to do so, so fair enough.

117
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:49,120
But the issue is, the court saw fit to just blanket ban access to the service across Canada

118
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,120
at the ISP level.

119
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:54,360
There was never any chance offered to Gold TV to go legit, or to shut down Gold TV's

120
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,880
service in Canada on their end.

121
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:59,360
Instead, it was simply decided that you could not access their service, not that they could

122
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,360
not provide it.

123
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:05,240
In 2020, Trudeau's Heritage Minister announced on CTV that any creator of Canadian media

124
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:09,240
would, under their proposed new regulations, would have to get a license in order to do

125
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,240
business.

126
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:14,640
You've got an agency that wants to enhance its scope of powers to determine what's

127
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:16,000
a trusted news source.

128
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,980
So the first question will be, who's to define that?

129
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:20,080
You've got a lot of these groups...

130
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:25,120
No, this is a recommendation, Evan, it's not, the CRTC hasn't decided anything.

131
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,800
Okay, but they're recommending that?

132
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:32,000
They're recommending that content providers have to register and get a license.

133
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,800
So how will this work?

134
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,580
How are you going to regulate websites?

135
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:37,120
How are you going to register all that?

136
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,240
Are you, do you buy these recommendations?

137
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:45,940
Well, I mean, one of the recommendations, so you're talking about a couple of different

138
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:50,680
things here, but as far as the licensing is concerned, is if you're a distributor of

139
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:57,360
content in Canada, and obviously, you know, if you're a very small media organization,

140
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:04,800
the requirement probably wouldn't be the same as if you're Facebook or Google, so there

141
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:09,120
would have to be some proportionality embedded into this.

142
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:12,640
But we would ask that they have a license, yes.

143
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:20,320
Just like right now, with the old system in Canada, distributors needed to go to the CRTC

144
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,960
and to have a license.

145
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:25,880
Oh no, we're joining the UK as license cucks.

146
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:29,840
This received a massive amount of blowback because this demanded not only entertainment

147
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:35,040
media, but news media, journalists obtain government approved licenses in order to operate

148
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:36,040
within Canada.

149
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:39,520
And there was a public outcry over the idea that the government would be the arbiter of

150
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:41,840
who is allowed to report on the news or not.

151
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:44,360
But the Heritage Minister didn't seem to think this was a big deal.

152
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:48,760
There is a concern that the panel wants to regulate international companies as well.

153
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:52,280
So let me take an example of a controversial site like Breitbart.

154
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:56,800
How would the government force a company like Breitbart, I don't know, the New York Times,

155
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:02,680
Mother Jones, the Daily Mail, how would they force those companies to comply with rules

156
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:05,480
of Canadian content, discoverability?

157
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:07,360
And if they don't comply, what happens?

158
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:12,760
Will Canadians be blocked from accessing international sites?

159
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:18,320
I don't think that's what's recommended in the report that these sites be blocked in

160
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,320
Canada.

161
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:22,600
Frankly, I'm not sure I see what the big deal is.

162
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:29,000
I mean, we have an incredible number of international corporations that are operating in Canada

163
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:35,560
and all sorts of sectors and financial sector and construction sector and the energy sector.

164
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:40,400
And these companies comply with Canadian rules and laws were a sovereign state.

165
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:44,840
All of this stuff would have come into force if Bill C-10 had passed, but it didn't.

166
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:48,920
The House of Commons gave it their stamp, but Parliament was dissolved for the 2021

167
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:50,240
election before the Senate could vote on it.

168
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:54,840
However, it's back again, this time as Bill C-11 with a few changes, passing again in

169
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:57,760
the House of Commons on June 21st of 2022.

170
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:00,680
And just like before, we're still waiting to see if it'll pass in the Senate.

171
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:04,960
The general idea is that the CRTC needs to be expanded to include Internet content and

172
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:09,160
that any Internet-based business with significant Canadian revenues needs to be registered with

173
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:13,400
and be regulated by that commission and be obligated to create and promote Canadian focused

174
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:16,280
content just like TV, film and radio in Canada.

175
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:20,240
The Conservatives attempted to include a clause excluding user-generated content into the

176
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,480
bill, only to have it shot down by the Liberals.

177
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:25,640
The Heritage Minister went on to say that individuals with large enough followings or

178
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:29,580
who generate enough revenue will be considered broadcasters, whether or not they actually

179
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:33,020
consider their online presence a business or just something that they do for fun.

180
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:36,760
This is a situation where big business and big government are all too happy to wash each

181
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:37,800
other's backs.

182
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:41,680
The corpos get state-backed monopolies where they can continue to drive prices upward,

183
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:44,280
knowing that there's no legit competition for their customers to turn to.

184
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:47,840
The government gets regulation, which controls their citizens' access to media that they

185
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:49,820
both consume and create.

186
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:53,840
The Conservative Party in Canada, for all of its problems, does not have the stench

187
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:56,060
of corruption on them that the Liberals do.

188
00:10:56,060 --> 00:11:00,060
And while Trudeau promised to end the liberal corruption that was so commonplace under Chretien

189
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:02,320
and Martin, it does not seem like he's succeeded.

190
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,920
However, that's a wider conversation.

191
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:07,760
I've done previous videos on Trudeau's many corruption scandals, from the SNC Lavalin

192
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:11,760
Shit Show, where the Quebec-based construction company gave money to the Liberals and received

193
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:15,380
preferential treatment in return, to the We Charity Shit Show, where the charity was given

194
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:18,900
a big bag of money by Trudeau's government and Trudeau's relatives were paid by the

195
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:21,080
charity for consulting work in return.

196
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:25,080
But Canada just seems to be more generally a country of goofy corruption and incompetence.

197
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:28,240
There was also that Nova Scotia shooting, I did a video on that a while back, where

198
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:32,760
it turned out that the RCMP, Canada's federal-level police like the FBI, were so awful at their

199
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:38,840
jobs that they sold to a man with a criminal record surplus RCMP gear, including RCMP vehicles,

200
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:42,720
which he used to pose as an officer in order to get people to trust him before he killed

201
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:43,720
them.

202
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:46,960
Like, I know we're laid back up here, guys, but whenever a scheme in Canada comes to light,

203
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:50,600
everybody involved doesn't look like an evil mastermind who's receiving a just downfall.

204
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:53,720
Instead, they all look like doofuses who were dumbfounded they were caught.

205
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:56,980
I think there's this perception in Canada that because we're so small and unassuming

206
00:11:56,980 --> 00:12:01,940
and polite, especially compared to the loud, boisterous, hyper-nationalistic, hyper-capitalistic

207
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:06,220
United States, that no matter what we do here, it'll never be as bad as those evil

208
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:07,220
Americans.

209
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:10,140
And I think that leads Canadians to excuse a lot of shit that we really shouldn't be

210
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:11,140
excusing.

211
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:14,940
Our corporations and our government is just as capable of being corrupt and fucking people

212
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:17,500
over, just like any other in any other place.

213
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:20,220
It doesn't matter that we have a reputation of culture and politeness.

214
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:23,740
All that means is that they'll be polite as they rape you, and insofar as the telecoms

215
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:24,980
go, that's exactly what they're doing.
