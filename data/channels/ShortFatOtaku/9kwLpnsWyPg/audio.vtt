00:00.000 --> 00:08.880
So, if you're not Canadian, this will probably be news to you.

00:08.880 --> 00:10.880
July 8th, 2022.

00:10.880 --> 00:15.480
One week ago, the Canadian telecom company Rogers experienced a service outage.

00:15.480 --> 00:18.360
Yes, this is what goes for newsworthy events in Canada.

00:18.360 --> 00:20.000
It's even got its own Wikipedia page!

00:20.000 --> 00:24.240
What makes it newsworthy, though, is the fact that Canada has one of the most over-regulated,

00:24.240 --> 00:27.200
monopolistic and protected telecom markets in the world.

00:27.200 --> 00:31.680
The big three companies, Rogers, Telus and Bell, control most of the market, with the

00:31.680 --> 00:36.200
rest being divided by the middle-tier Shaw, which Rogers is currently trying to buy up,

00:36.200 --> 00:39.960
and the few smaller regional competitors that are still somehow surviving.

00:39.960 --> 00:44.800
As such, the Rogers outage affected 12 million people out of Canada's 38 million.

00:44.800 --> 00:48.480
25% of Canada's total landmass lost internet connectivity.

00:48.480 --> 00:54.120
Interac, the main electronic financial transactions service, was down nationwide as they use Rogers.

00:54.120 --> 00:58.660
Their phone service was down, including emergency services, leading to one death that could

00:58.660 --> 01:02.200
have been prevented had the people at the scene been able to call 911.

01:02.200 --> 01:07.480
Approximately 25% of Toronto's traffic signals stopped working as they used the Rogers wireless

01:07.480 --> 01:10.060
network to communicate timing between intersections.

01:10.060 --> 01:14.200
And the overall economic impact to the whole of Canada is currently estimated to be at

01:14.200 --> 01:18.720
around $142 million, and rising as the outage isn't totally fixed yet.

01:18.720 --> 01:20.640
I was still online because I use Bell.

01:20.640 --> 01:24.400
And yeah, Bell sucks a big one, too, but they're the only provider in my area that

01:24.400 --> 01:26.880
offers fiber optic internet, so what are you going to do?

01:26.880 --> 01:28.360
In fact, that's how most of Canada feels.

01:28.360 --> 01:30.300
They're the only provider, so what are you going to do?

01:30.300 --> 01:32.320
Most places in Canada, you've got one option.

01:32.320 --> 01:35.640
There's sometimes more options than the larger cities, to a point, but the market's

01:35.640 --> 01:39.240
still extremely regulated, with little real room for actual competition.

01:39.240 --> 01:43.320
And you can tell just how bad it is by looking at these prices, in Canadian dollars, of course.

01:43.320 --> 01:48.480
An unlimited calling and texting cell phone plan with 12 gigs of data for just $115 a

01:48.480 --> 01:54.440
month at Rogers, 15 gigs for $160 at Bell, oh man, $175, $125, look at these deals.

01:54.440 --> 01:58.400
Meanwhile in Australia, it's, converted into Canadian dollars, $43 a month for a

01:58.400 --> 02:02.360
cell phone plan with 30 gigs of data, $44 Canadian for 40 gigs of data.

02:02.360 --> 02:08.360
In America, AT&T offers unlimited data for $91 Canadian, Virgin offers the same for $78.

02:08.360 --> 02:12.840
In the UK, $54 Canadian for unlimited, $46, same thing, $41, same thing.

02:12.840 --> 02:16.680
In India, it's the equivalent of $8, though that might not necessarily be the same, we're

02:16.680 --> 02:18.600
not comparing first world nations anymore.

02:18.600 --> 02:20.200
But I think the point is made.

02:20.200 --> 02:23.300
Canadians are getting fucked by telecoms right now, to the point that it's actually cheaper

02:23.300 --> 02:27.240
to get an American cell phone plan and pay roaming charges.

02:27.240 --> 02:30.800
Regulation has a unique secondary role in Canada, the primary role being the same as

02:30.800 --> 02:34.620
everywhere else, where the government imposes standards on private business, with the intention

02:34.620 --> 02:38.600
of ensuring a specific level of quality, or widespread coverage, or safety, depending

02:38.600 --> 02:39.600
on the industry.

02:39.600 --> 02:42.640
This isn't automatically good or bad, it depends on what the regulation is, but it

02:42.640 --> 02:47.480
almost always has the unfortunate side effect of raising the barrier of entry into the market.

02:47.480 --> 02:51.520
If your new fledgling company with your new idea that'll disrupt the marketplace can't

02:51.520 --> 02:55.640
afford the additional imposed cost of implementing the government regulation, your company is

02:55.640 --> 02:56.940
not getting off the ground.

02:56.940 --> 02:59.880
This leads to a lack of competition, which leads to a lack of innovation.

02:59.880 --> 03:03.040
Companies become stagnant, they begin to monopolize the market, and once they're sufficiently

03:03.040 --> 03:06.480
protected by government regulation, they begin to jack prices up, because what are you going

03:06.480 --> 03:07.480
to do?

03:07.480 --> 03:09.840
Now, as always, things aren't this simple all the time.

03:09.840 --> 03:14.060
There are some industries that naturally trend towards monopolies, due to the particularities

03:14.060 --> 03:18.080
of their specific market or product, and in that case, regulation to promote competition

03:18.080 --> 03:20.080
and prevent monopolies can certainly be good.

03:20.080 --> 03:23.800
And in other cases, markets that are highly competitive on their own may need to be regulated

03:23.800 --> 03:29.120
for some other reason, since not everything we value can be best obtained by market forces.

03:29.120 --> 03:34.060
But as a general rule, regulation, even necessary regulation, even regulation that we don't

03:34.060 --> 03:37.860
want to do away with, represents an extra cost for business, which makes it harder for

03:37.860 --> 03:41.360
new players to compete, giving the big corporations an advantage.

03:41.360 --> 03:45.260
But as I said before, Canadian regulation serves a dual purpose, and the other one is

03:45.260 --> 03:47.180
a strange form of Canadian protectionism.

03:47.180 --> 03:50.740
Yes, every country wants to see their own businesses flourish, and not only have foreign

03:50.740 --> 03:53.620
corpos come in and control everything, and Canada is no exception.

03:53.620 --> 03:57.860
Uncharacteristically, compared to the world's generally free-trade loving liberal parties,

03:57.860 --> 04:02.020
the Canadian liberals have historically advocated for tariffs on certain protected Canadian

04:02.020 --> 04:04.260
industries, even within such frameworks as NAFTA.

04:04.260 --> 04:06.900
But there's also a cultural component to this conversation as well.

04:06.900 --> 04:09.780
The Canadian government is extremely worried about the cultural powerhouse that is the

04:09.780 --> 04:10.780
United States.

04:10.780 --> 04:13.820
There's a fear, probably well-founded, that within a completely free market, Canadian

04:13.820 --> 04:18.340
media would be absolutely dominated by American exports, American music, American TV shows,

04:18.340 --> 04:19.340
American movies.

04:19.340 --> 04:23.400
And so, the Canadian government always uses its regulatory powers to mandate that a percentage

04:23.400 --> 04:28.620
of all broadcasted media in Canada is made in Canada by Canadians and about Canadians.

04:28.620 --> 04:32.660
And this mandate has greatly empowered both the creators and the distributors of Canadian

04:32.660 --> 04:36.960
media, with telecoms, whose infrastructure the media is being transmitted is on, playing

04:36.960 --> 04:38.740
their part in that process.

04:38.740 --> 04:40.780
Sometimes this protectionism can play a positive role.

04:40.780 --> 04:45.340
For example, I recall it being kind of a fight to get Chinese-compromised Huawei tech out

04:45.340 --> 04:49.220
of the telecom networks of the US and the UK, while in Canada, the make-it-in-Canada

04:49.220 --> 04:50.700
message made that move a no-brainer.

04:50.700 --> 04:54.340
Also, it's just funny to me that this sort of nativist, Canada-focused language comes

04:54.340 --> 04:58.860
out of primarily our left-leaning parties, the liberals and the NDP, when if you swap

04:58.860 --> 05:02.060
Canada out for America, it almost sounds Trumpian in a way.

05:02.060 --> 05:05.240
But the telecom situation in Canada has been a known problem for years.

05:05.240 --> 05:08.700
Nobody is actually happy with the way things are going, except for the companies themselves

05:08.700 --> 05:11.740
who are making a killing, and the government, who is all too happy to use the powers of

05:11.740 --> 05:14.220
a privately owned monopoly for its own purposes.

05:14.220 --> 05:18.020
A marketplace that has been so heavily regulated and protected such that only a small group

05:18.020 --> 05:21.580
of players are able to operate, is an industry where the government has only a small group

05:21.580 --> 05:24.060
of players to deal with in order to achieve its goals.

05:24.060 --> 05:27.900
And there is certainly a push within Canada for the government to exert more control over

05:27.900 --> 05:29.900
the internet and telecommunications in general.

05:29.900 --> 05:34.500
In 2018, an organization called Fairplay Canada popped up, which claims to be a coalition

05:34.500 --> 05:39.420
of Canadian artists, content creators, unions, guilds, producers, performers, broadcasters,

05:39.420 --> 05:43.440
distributors, and exhibitors who are asking the Canadian Radio, Television and Telecommunications

05:43.440 --> 05:48.540
Commission, the CRTC, to take action to address the theft of digital content by illegal piracy

05:48.540 --> 05:49.540
websites.

05:49.540 --> 05:52.880
What this actually is, is an advocacy group headed up by a bunch of corpos, most notably

05:52.880 --> 05:57.940
Bell & Rogers, two of Canada's big three telecoms, advocating for the government to grant private

05:57.940 --> 06:02.620
business the legal right to filter the internet in Canada to exclude pirated content.

06:02.620 --> 06:05.580
And of course, there's no reason to believe that this power would stop there.

06:05.580 --> 06:11.580
In 2019, a Canadian court ordered Canada's telecoms to block access to Gold TV, an IPTV

06:11.580 --> 06:13.460
service that broadcasts around the world, including in Canada.

06:13.460 --> 06:18.020
In case you don't know, IPTV is just regular television broadcast over the internet, rather

06:18.020 --> 06:19.260
than over satellite or cable.

06:19.260 --> 06:22.900
It's not the same as downloading content, nor is it the same as Netflix or YouTube,

06:22.900 --> 06:26.400
where you choose a video or show or movie to stream, but rather it operates like traditional

06:26.400 --> 06:29.200
TV, where you pick a channel, it just transmits over the internet.

06:29.200 --> 06:33.040
But Canada's telecoms market, being protected from competition, hasn't felt any pressure

06:33.040 --> 06:37.980
to move towards IPTV, even though it is the latest in TV technology, so Gold TV started

06:37.980 --> 06:38.980
doing it on their own.

06:38.980 --> 06:42.560
Where Gold TV fucked up, is that it never got permission from the channels it was broadcasting

06:42.560 --> 06:44.380
to do so, so fair enough.

06:44.380 --> 06:49.120
But the issue is, the court saw fit to just blanket ban access to the service across Canada

06:49.120 --> 06:50.120
at the ISP level.

06:50.120 --> 06:54.360
There was never any chance offered to Gold TV to go legit, or to shut down Gold TV's

06:54.360 --> 06:55.880
service in Canada on their end.

06:55.920 --> 06:59.360
Instead, it was simply decided that you could not access their service, not that they could

06:59.360 --> 07:00.360
not provide it.

07:00.360 --> 07:05.240
In 2020, Trudeau's Heritage Minister announced on CTV that any creator of Canadian media

07:05.240 --> 07:09.240
would, under their proposed new regulations, would have to get a license in order to do

07:09.240 --> 07:10.240
business.

07:10.240 --> 07:14.640
You've got an agency that wants to enhance its scope of powers to determine what's

07:14.640 --> 07:16.000
a trusted news source.

07:16.000 --> 07:17.980
So the first question will be, who's to define that?

07:17.980 --> 07:20.080
You've got a lot of these groups...

07:20.080 --> 07:25.120
No, this is a recommendation, Evan, it's not, the CRTC hasn't decided anything.

07:25.160 --> 07:26.800
Okay, but they're recommending that?

07:26.800 --> 07:32.000
They're recommending that content providers have to register and get a license.

07:32.000 --> 07:33.800
So how will this work?

07:33.800 --> 07:35.580
How are you going to regulate websites?

07:35.580 --> 07:37.120
How are you going to register all that?

07:37.120 --> 07:39.240
Are you, do you buy these recommendations?

07:41.240 --> 07:45.940
Well, I mean, one of the recommendations, so you're talking about a couple of different

07:45.940 --> 07:50.680
things here, but as far as the licensing is concerned, is if you're a distributor of

07:50.720 --> 07:57.360
content in Canada, and obviously, you know, if you're a very small media organization,

07:57.360 --> 08:04.800
the requirement probably wouldn't be the same as if you're Facebook or Google, so there

08:04.800 --> 08:09.120
would have to be some proportionality embedded into this.

08:09.120 --> 08:12.640
But we would ask that they have a license, yes.

08:12.640 --> 08:20.320
Just like right now, with the old system in Canada, distributors needed to go to the CRTC

08:20.960 --> 08:22.960
and to have a license.

08:22.960 --> 08:25.880
Oh no, we're joining the UK as license cucks.

08:25.880 --> 08:29.840
This received a massive amount of blowback because this demanded not only entertainment

08:29.840 --> 08:35.040
media, but news media, journalists obtain government approved licenses in order to operate

08:35.040 --> 08:36.040
within Canada.

08:36.040 --> 08:39.520
And there was a public outcry over the idea that the government would be the arbiter of

08:39.520 --> 08:41.840
who is allowed to report on the news or not.

08:41.840 --> 08:44.360
But the Heritage Minister didn't seem to think this was a big deal.

08:44.360 --> 08:48.760
There is a concern that the panel wants to regulate international companies as well.

08:48.760 --> 08:52.280
So let me take an example of a controversial site like Breitbart.

08:52.280 --> 08:56.800
How would the government force a company like Breitbart, I don't know, the New York Times,

08:56.800 --> 09:02.680
Mother Jones, the Daily Mail, how would they force those companies to comply with rules

09:02.680 --> 09:05.480
of Canadian content, discoverability?

09:05.480 --> 09:07.360
And if they don't comply, what happens?

09:07.360 --> 09:12.760
Will Canadians be blocked from accessing international sites?

09:12.760 --> 09:18.320
I don't think that's what's recommended in the report that these sites be blocked in

09:18.320 --> 09:19.320
Canada.

09:19.320 --> 09:22.600
Frankly, I'm not sure I see what the big deal is.

09:22.600 --> 09:29.000
I mean, we have an incredible number of international corporations that are operating in Canada

09:29.000 --> 09:35.560
and all sorts of sectors and financial sector and construction sector and the energy sector.

09:35.560 --> 09:40.400
And these companies comply with Canadian rules and laws were a sovereign state.

09:40.400 --> 09:44.840
All of this stuff would have come into force if Bill C-10 had passed, but it didn't.

09:44.840 --> 09:48.920
The House of Commons gave it their stamp, but Parliament was dissolved for the 2021

09:48.920 --> 09:50.240
election before the Senate could vote on it.

09:50.240 --> 09:54.840
However, it's back again, this time as Bill C-11 with a few changes, passing again in

09:54.840 --> 09:57.760
the House of Commons on June 21st of 2022.

09:57.760 --> 10:00.680
And just like before, we're still waiting to see if it'll pass in the Senate.

10:00.680 --> 10:04.960
The general idea is that the CRTC needs to be expanded to include Internet content and

10:04.960 --> 10:09.160
that any Internet-based business with significant Canadian revenues needs to be registered with

10:09.160 --> 10:13.400
and be regulated by that commission and be obligated to create and promote Canadian focused

10:13.400 --> 10:16.280
content just like TV, film and radio in Canada.

10:16.280 --> 10:20.240
The Conservatives attempted to include a clause excluding user-generated content into the

10:20.240 --> 10:22.480
bill, only to have it shot down by the Liberals.

10:22.480 --> 10:25.640
The Heritage Minister went on to say that individuals with large enough followings or

10:25.640 --> 10:29.580
who generate enough revenue will be considered broadcasters, whether or not they actually

10:29.580 --> 10:33.020
consider their online presence a business or just something that they do for fun.

10:33.020 --> 10:36.760
This is a situation where big business and big government are all too happy to wash each

10:36.760 --> 10:37.800
other's backs.

10:37.800 --> 10:41.680
The corpos get state-backed monopolies where they can continue to drive prices upward,

10:41.680 --> 10:44.280
knowing that there's no legit competition for their customers to turn to.

10:44.280 --> 10:47.840
The government gets regulation, which controls their citizens' access to media that they

10:47.840 --> 10:49.820
both consume and create.

10:49.820 --> 10:53.840
The Conservative Party in Canada, for all of its problems, does not have the stench

10:53.840 --> 10:56.060
of corruption on them that the Liberals do.

10:56.060 --> 11:00.060
And while Trudeau promised to end the liberal corruption that was so commonplace under Chretien

11:00.060 --> 11:02.320
and Martin, it does not seem like he's succeeded.

11:02.320 --> 11:03.920
However, that's a wider conversation.

11:03.920 --> 11:07.760
I've done previous videos on Trudeau's many corruption scandals, from the SNC Lavalin

11:07.760 --> 11:11.760
Shit Show, where the Quebec-based construction company gave money to the Liberals and received

11:11.760 --> 11:15.380
preferential treatment in return, to the We Charity Shit Show, where the charity was given

11:15.380 --> 11:18.900
a big bag of money by Trudeau's government and Trudeau's relatives were paid by the

11:18.900 --> 11:21.080
charity for consulting work in return.

11:21.080 --> 11:25.080
But Canada just seems to be more generally a country of goofy corruption and incompetence.

11:25.080 --> 11:28.240
There was also that Nova Scotia shooting, I did a video on that a while back, where

11:28.240 --> 11:32.760
it turned out that the RCMP, Canada's federal-level police like the FBI, were so awful at their

11:32.760 --> 11:38.840
jobs that they sold to a man with a criminal record surplus RCMP gear, including RCMP vehicles,

11:38.840 --> 11:42.720
which he used to pose as an officer in order to get people to trust him before he killed

11:42.720 --> 11:43.720
them.

11:43.720 --> 11:46.960
Like, I know we're laid back up here, guys, but whenever a scheme in Canada comes to light,

11:46.960 --> 11:50.600
everybody involved doesn't look like an evil mastermind who's receiving a just downfall.

11:50.600 --> 11:53.720
Instead, they all look like doofuses who were dumbfounded they were caught.

11:53.720 --> 11:56.980
I think there's this perception in Canada that because we're so small and unassuming

11:56.980 --> 12:01.940
and polite, especially compared to the loud, boisterous, hyper-nationalistic, hyper-capitalistic

12:01.940 --> 12:06.220
United States, that no matter what we do here, it'll never be as bad as those evil

12:06.220 --> 12:07.220
Americans.

12:07.220 --> 12:10.140
And I think that leads Canadians to excuse a lot of shit that we really shouldn't be

12:10.140 --> 12:11.140
excusing.

12:11.140 --> 12:14.940
Our corporations and our government is just as capable of being corrupt and fucking people

12:14.940 --> 12:17.500
over, just like any other in any other place.

12:17.500 --> 12:20.220
It doesn't matter that we have a reputation of culture and politeness.

12:20.220 --> 12:23.740
All that means is that they'll be polite as they rape you, and insofar as the telecoms

12:23.740 --> 12:24.980
go, that's exactly what they're doing.
