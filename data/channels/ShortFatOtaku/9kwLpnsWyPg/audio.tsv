0	8880	So, if you're not Canadian, this will probably be news to you.
8880	10880	July 8th, 2022.
10880	15480	One week ago, the Canadian telecom company Rogers experienced a service outage.
15480	18360	Yes, this is what goes for newsworthy events in Canada.
18360	20000	It's even got its own Wikipedia page!
20000	24240	What makes it newsworthy, though, is the fact that Canada has one of the most over-regulated,
24240	27200	monopolistic and protected telecom markets in the world.
27200	31680	The big three companies, Rogers, Telus and Bell, control most of the market, with the
31680	36200	rest being divided by the middle-tier Shaw, which Rogers is currently trying to buy up,
36200	39960	and the few smaller regional competitors that are still somehow surviving.
39960	44800	As such, the Rogers outage affected 12 million people out of Canada's 38 million.
44800	48480	25% of Canada's total landmass lost internet connectivity.
48480	54120	Interac, the main electronic financial transactions service, was down nationwide as they use Rogers.
54120	58660	Their phone service was down, including emergency services, leading to one death that could
58660	62200	have been prevented had the people at the scene been able to call 911.
62200	67480	Approximately 25% of Toronto's traffic signals stopped working as they used the Rogers wireless
67480	70060	network to communicate timing between intersections.
70060	74200	And the overall economic impact to the whole of Canada is currently estimated to be at
74200	78720	around $142 million, and rising as the outage isn't totally fixed yet.
78720	80640	I was still online because I use Bell.
80640	84400	And yeah, Bell sucks a big one, too, but they're the only provider in my area that
84400	86880	offers fiber optic internet, so what are you going to do?
86880	88360	In fact, that's how most of Canada feels.
88360	90300	They're the only provider, so what are you going to do?
90300	92320	Most places in Canada, you've got one option.
92320	95640	There's sometimes more options than the larger cities, to a point, but the market's
95640	99240	still extremely regulated, with little real room for actual competition.
99240	103320	And you can tell just how bad it is by looking at these prices, in Canadian dollars, of course.
103320	108480	An unlimited calling and texting cell phone plan with 12 gigs of data for just $115 a
108480	114440	month at Rogers, 15 gigs for $160 at Bell, oh man, $175, $125, look at these deals.
114440	118400	Meanwhile in Australia, it's, converted into Canadian dollars, $43 a month for a
118400	122360	cell phone plan with 30 gigs of data, $44 Canadian for 40 gigs of data.
122360	128360	In America, AT&T offers unlimited data for $91 Canadian, Virgin offers the same for $78.
128360	132840	In the UK, $54 Canadian for unlimited, $46, same thing, $41, same thing.
132840	136680	In India, it's the equivalent of $8, though that might not necessarily be the same, we're
136680	138600	not comparing first world nations anymore.
138600	140200	But I think the point is made.
140200	143300	Canadians are getting fucked by telecoms right now, to the point that it's actually cheaper
143300	147240	to get an American cell phone plan and pay roaming charges.
147240	150800	Regulation has a unique secondary role in Canada, the primary role being the same as
150800	154620	everywhere else, where the government imposes standards on private business, with the intention
154620	158600	of ensuring a specific level of quality, or widespread coverage, or safety, depending
158600	159600	on the industry.
159600	162640	This isn't automatically good or bad, it depends on what the regulation is, but it
162640	167480	almost always has the unfortunate side effect of raising the barrier of entry into the market.
167480	171520	If your new fledgling company with your new idea that'll disrupt the marketplace can't
171520	175640	afford the additional imposed cost of implementing the government regulation, your company is
175640	176940	not getting off the ground.
176940	179880	This leads to a lack of competition, which leads to a lack of innovation.
179880	183040	Companies become stagnant, they begin to monopolize the market, and once they're sufficiently
183040	186480	protected by government regulation, they begin to jack prices up, because what are you going
186480	187480	to do?
187480	189840	Now, as always, things aren't this simple all the time.
189840	194060	There are some industries that naturally trend towards monopolies, due to the particularities
194060	198080	of their specific market or product, and in that case, regulation to promote competition
198080	200080	and prevent monopolies can certainly be good.
200080	203800	And in other cases, markets that are highly competitive on their own may need to be regulated
203800	209120	for some other reason, since not everything we value can be best obtained by market forces.
209120	214060	But as a general rule, regulation, even necessary regulation, even regulation that we don't
214060	217860	want to do away with, represents an extra cost for business, which makes it harder for
217860	221360	new players to compete, giving the big corporations an advantage.
221360	225260	But as I said before, Canadian regulation serves a dual purpose, and the other one is
225260	227180	a strange form of Canadian protectionism.
227180	230740	Yes, every country wants to see their own businesses flourish, and not only have foreign
230740	233620	corpos come in and control everything, and Canada is no exception.
233620	237860	Uncharacteristically, compared to the world's generally free-trade loving liberal parties,
237860	242020	the Canadian liberals have historically advocated for tariffs on certain protected Canadian
242020	244260	industries, even within such frameworks as NAFTA.
244260	246900	But there's also a cultural component to this conversation as well.
246900	249780	The Canadian government is extremely worried about the cultural powerhouse that is the
249780	250780	United States.
250780	253820	There's a fear, probably well-founded, that within a completely free market, Canadian
253820	258340	media would be absolutely dominated by American exports, American music, American TV shows,
258340	259340	American movies.
259340	263400	And so, the Canadian government always uses its regulatory powers to mandate that a percentage
263400	268620	of all broadcasted media in Canada is made in Canada by Canadians and about Canadians.
268620	272660	And this mandate has greatly empowered both the creators and the distributors of Canadian
272660	276960	media, with telecoms, whose infrastructure the media is being transmitted is on, playing
276960	278740	their part in that process.
278740	280780	Sometimes this protectionism can play a positive role.
280780	285340	For example, I recall it being kind of a fight to get Chinese-compromised Huawei tech out
285340	289220	of the telecom networks of the US and the UK, while in Canada, the make-it-in-Canada
289220	290700	message made that move a no-brainer.
290700	294340	Also, it's just funny to me that this sort of nativist, Canada-focused language comes
294340	298860	out of primarily our left-leaning parties, the liberals and the NDP, when if you swap
298860	302060	Canada out for America, it almost sounds Trumpian in a way.
302060	305240	But the telecom situation in Canada has been a known problem for years.
305240	308700	Nobody is actually happy with the way things are going, except for the companies themselves
308700	311740	who are making a killing, and the government, who is all too happy to use the powers of
311740	314220	a privately owned monopoly for its own purposes.
314220	318020	A marketplace that has been so heavily regulated and protected such that only a small group
318020	321580	of players are able to operate, is an industry where the government has only a small group
321580	324060	of players to deal with in order to achieve its goals.
324060	327900	And there is certainly a push within Canada for the government to exert more control over
327900	329900	the internet and telecommunications in general.
329900	334500	In 2018, an organization called Fairplay Canada popped up, which claims to be a coalition
334500	339420	of Canadian artists, content creators, unions, guilds, producers, performers, broadcasters,
339420	343440	distributors, and exhibitors who are asking the Canadian Radio, Television and Telecommunications
343440	348540	Commission, the CRTC, to take action to address the theft of digital content by illegal piracy
348540	349540	websites.
349540	352880	What this actually is, is an advocacy group headed up by a bunch of corpos, most notably
352880	357940	Bell & Rogers, two of Canada's big three telecoms, advocating for the government to grant private
357940	362620	business the legal right to filter the internet in Canada to exclude pirated content.
362620	365580	And of course, there's no reason to believe that this power would stop there.
365580	371580	In 2019, a Canadian court ordered Canada's telecoms to block access to Gold TV, an IPTV
371580	373460	service that broadcasts around the world, including in Canada.
373460	378020	In case you don't know, IPTV is just regular television broadcast over the internet, rather
378020	379260	than over satellite or cable.
379260	382900	It's not the same as downloading content, nor is it the same as Netflix or YouTube,
382900	386400	where you choose a video or show or movie to stream, but rather it operates like traditional
386400	389200	TV, where you pick a channel, it just transmits over the internet.
389200	393040	But Canada's telecoms market, being protected from competition, hasn't felt any pressure
393040	397980	to move towards IPTV, even though it is the latest in TV technology, so Gold TV started
397980	398980	doing it on their own.
398980	402560	Where Gold TV fucked up, is that it never got permission from the channels it was broadcasting
402560	404380	to do so, so fair enough.
404380	409120	But the issue is, the court saw fit to just blanket ban access to the service across Canada
409120	410120	at the ISP level.
410120	414360	There was never any chance offered to Gold TV to go legit, or to shut down Gold TV's
414360	415880	service in Canada on their end.
415920	419360	Instead, it was simply decided that you could not access their service, not that they could
419360	420360	not provide it.
420360	425240	In 2020, Trudeau's Heritage Minister announced on CTV that any creator of Canadian media
425240	429240	would, under their proposed new regulations, would have to get a license in order to do
429240	430240	business.
430240	434640	You've got an agency that wants to enhance its scope of powers to determine what's
434640	436000	a trusted news source.
436000	437980	So the first question will be, who's to define that?
437980	440080	You've got a lot of these groups...
440080	445120	No, this is a recommendation, Evan, it's not, the CRTC hasn't decided anything.
445160	446800	Okay, but they're recommending that?
446800	452000	They're recommending that content providers have to register and get a license.
452000	453800	So how will this work?
453800	455580	How are you going to regulate websites?
455580	457120	How are you going to register all that?
457120	459240	Are you, do you buy these recommendations?
461240	465940	Well, I mean, one of the recommendations, so you're talking about a couple of different
465940	470680	things here, but as far as the licensing is concerned, is if you're a distributor of
470720	477360	content in Canada, and obviously, you know, if you're a very small media organization,
477360	484800	the requirement probably wouldn't be the same as if you're Facebook or Google, so there
484800	489120	would have to be some proportionality embedded into this.
489120	492640	But we would ask that they have a license, yes.
492640	500320	Just like right now, with the old system in Canada, distributors needed to go to the CRTC
500960	502960	and to have a license.
502960	505880	Oh no, we're joining the UK as license cucks.
505880	509840	This received a massive amount of blowback because this demanded not only entertainment
509840	515040	media, but news media, journalists obtain government approved licenses in order to operate
515040	516040	within Canada.
516040	519520	And there was a public outcry over the idea that the government would be the arbiter of
519520	521840	who is allowed to report on the news or not.
521840	524360	But the Heritage Minister didn't seem to think this was a big deal.
524360	528760	There is a concern that the panel wants to regulate international companies as well.
528760	532280	So let me take an example of a controversial site like Breitbart.
532280	536800	How would the government force a company like Breitbart, I don't know, the New York Times,
536800	542680	Mother Jones, the Daily Mail, how would they force those companies to comply with rules
542680	545480	of Canadian content, discoverability?
545480	547360	And if they don't comply, what happens?
547360	552760	Will Canadians be blocked from accessing international sites?
552760	558320	I don't think that's what's recommended in the report that these sites be blocked in
558320	559320	Canada.
559320	562600	Frankly, I'm not sure I see what the big deal is.
562600	569000	I mean, we have an incredible number of international corporations that are operating in Canada
569000	575560	and all sorts of sectors and financial sector and construction sector and the energy sector.
575560	580400	And these companies comply with Canadian rules and laws were a sovereign state.
580400	584840	All of this stuff would have come into force if Bill C-10 had passed, but it didn't.
584840	588920	The House of Commons gave it their stamp, but Parliament was dissolved for the 2021
588920	590240	election before the Senate could vote on it.
590240	594840	However, it's back again, this time as Bill C-11 with a few changes, passing again in
594840	597760	the House of Commons on June 21st of 2022.
597760	600680	And just like before, we're still waiting to see if it'll pass in the Senate.
600680	604960	The general idea is that the CRTC needs to be expanded to include Internet content and
604960	609160	that any Internet-based business with significant Canadian revenues needs to be registered with
609160	613400	and be regulated by that commission and be obligated to create and promote Canadian focused
613400	616280	content just like TV, film and radio in Canada.
616280	620240	The Conservatives attempted to include a clause excluding user-generated content into the
620240	622480	bill, only to have it shot down by the Liberals.
622480	625640	The Heritage Minister went on to say that individuals with large enough followings or
625640	629580	who generate enough revenue will be considered broadcasters, whether or not they actually
629580	633020	consider their online presence a business or just something that they do for fun.
633020	636760	This is a situation where big business and big government are all too happy to wash each
636760	637800	other's backs.
637800	641680	The corpos get state-backed monopolies where they can continue to drive prices upward,
641680	644280	knowing that there's no legit competition for their customers to turn to.
644280	647840	The government gets regulation, which controls their citizens' access to media that they
647840	649820	both consume and create.
649820	653840	The Conservative Party in Canada, for all of its problems, does not have the stench
653840	656060	of corruption on them that the Liberals do.
656060	660060	And while Trudeau promised to end the liberal corruption that was so commonplace under Chretien
660060	662320	and Martin, it does not seem like he's succeeded.
662320	663920	However, that's a wider conversation.
663920	667760	I've done previous videos on Trudeau's many corruption scandals, from the SNC Lavalin
667760	671760	Shit Show, where the Quebec-based construction company gave money to the Liberals and received
671760	675380	preferential treatment in return, to the We Charity Shit Show, where the charity was given
675380	678900	a big bag of money by Trudeau's government and Trudeau's relatives were paid by the
678900	681080	charity for consulting work in return.
681080	685080	But Canada just seems to be more generally a country of goofy corruption and incompetence.
685080	688240	There was also that Nova Scotia shooting, I did a video on that a while back, where
688240	692760	it turned out that the RCMP, Canada's federal-level police like the FBI, were so awful at their
692760	698840	jobs that they sold to a man with a criminal record surplus RCMP gear, including RCMP vehicles,
698840	702720	which he used to pose as an officer in order to get people to trust him before he killed
702720	703720	them.
703720	706960	Like, I know we're laid back up here, guys, but whenever a scheme in Canada comes to light,
706960	710600	everybody involved doesn't look like an evil mastermind who's receiving a just downfall.
710600	713720	Instead, they all look like doofuses who were dumbfounded they were caught.
713720	716980	I think there's this perception in Canada that because we're so small and unassuming
716980	721940	and polite, especially compared to the loud, boisterous, hyper-nationalistic, hyper-capitalistic
721940	726220	United States, that no matter what we do here, it'll never be as bad as those evil
726220	727220	Americans.
727220	730140	And I think that leads Canadians to excuse a lot of shit that we really shouldn't be
730140	731140	excusing.
731140	734940	Our corporations and our government is just as capable of being corrupt and fucking people
734940	737500	over, just like any other in any other place.
737500	740220	It doesn't matter that we have a reputation of culture and politeness.
740220	743740	All that means is that they'll be polite as they rape you, and insofar as the telecoms
743740	744980	go, that's exactly what they're doing.
