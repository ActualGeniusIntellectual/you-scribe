0	4240	During yesterday's Dumping with Scrump, on the whole Patreon purge thing,
4240	8080	Scrump and I missed a few important bits of information. To be frank, we recorded that
8080	13200	Monday. And the video came out on Thursday, so a few new events have developed during that time
13200	17840	period. Let's discuss them now. Very quickly, Sargon of Akkad was removed from Patreon. They
17840	23120	claim it's due to some racial epithets he used during a livestream on Michelle Caitlin's relatively
23120	26800	tiny channel. This is what I mean about the channel, I just can't be bothered to deal with
27680	45360	this. The context, as best as I can figure out, is that he was addressing some members of the
45360	50160	alt-right in the chatroom of that stream, and he insulted them by accusing them of being exactly
50160	54400	what they hate the most, and he used their racially charged language to do it. Seeing
54400	58960	as that stream was 10 months old, and that recently both people from the COW boards on
58960	64960	8chan and Ethan Ralph's Discord have been mass emailing a paste bin containing this stream and
64960	70080	other events to Patreon, it's highly likely that Patreon wasn't aware of this stream before these
70080	75280	groups sent them the info, in my opinion. However, due to both the wording of Patreon's terms of
75280	80400	service, as well as an interview with Patreon's CEO, Jack Conte, it's clear that Patreon's
80400	97760	official stance is that it does not ban for off-platform action, which suddenly casts
97760	101600	Patreon's credibility into doubt because that is exactly what they have done with Sargon.
101600	107120	Patreon's emails to Sargon stated that because Sargon's Patreon was about his Sargon brand,
107120	112480	and because the Sargon brand is known for making guest appearances on other people's streams,
112480	116400	technically Sargon's appearance on Michelle Caitlin's channel was still covered by the
116400	120880	terms of service. That's quite a stretch, but it's one that Patreon doubled down on,
120880	126160	with Jack Conte stating in a private message with Tim Poole that he knew the terms of service was
126160	131120	worded in such a way that it was not obvious to anyone that Sargon's behaviours violated it.
131120	135520	Despite this, Patreon's Jacqueline Hart, speaking for their Trust and Safety committee,
135520	141040	penned a response to the whole thing titled Hate Speech on Patreon. This response contains a
141040	145520	transcript of Sargon's remarks on Michelle Caitlin's channel, with Jacqueline providing
145520	150480	Patreon's reasoning as to why this somehow violates their terms of service despite being
150480	156400	off-site. She specifically says, in this case, Sargon used racial slurs to insult others,
156400	160000	and specifically linked those slurs with negative generalizations of behaviour,
160000	164960	in contrast to how people of other races act. He also used a slur related to sexual orientation
164960	169760	to generally insult others, taken in whole with all of the context. This violates our
169760	174160	community guidelines. But that wasn't with all of the context, was it Jacqueline?
174160	177760	Nick Monroe, known primarily for being a stand-up chap on Twitter,
177760	182160	did the hard work of rewatching the Sargon remarks, making a direct transcript,
182160	186480	and comparing that with what Jacqueline provided as a justification in her response piece.
186480	191440	There's some striking differences. As it turns out, Patreon's transcript of the stream removes
191440	196080	the fact that Sargon was referring specifically to people he identified as alt-right trolls within
196080	200880	the livestream's chat room. Without this context, it sounds like Sargon's just on a diatribe.
200880	205520	An entire paragraph is skipped over, further providing context that Sargon's replying to the
205520	211040	chat, but even more telling, mentions of Sargon's working-class background is also removed from
211040	216160	Patreon's quotation. In the third paragraph, Patreon explicitly leaves out another reference
216160	220720	to the working-class side of the conversation. Jacqueline did not provide all of the context,
220800	225520	as she claims, but left more than half of the conversation on the cutting room floor,
225520	229520	specifically the parts that would run counter to the idea that Sargon is a racist.
229520	234160	And it's this narrative that the media would run with, publishing articles that misquote
234160	238960	Jacqueline's interpretation of the truth, with the consequence of their content straying even
238960	243040	further from the mark. When you look up Jacqueline Hart on LinkedIn, you'll find she's got an
243040	246800	impressive resume. She's only been at Patreon for the past three months, but she has a number
246800	251760	of successful financial and banking jobs under her belt, including an eight-year stint at PayPal.
251760	256400	She's a banker. She's not a community manager. She's not somebody fit for the Trust and Safety
256400	261840	Board at Patreon, unless that phrase refers to the trust of investors and the safety of Patreon from
261840	265840	lawsuits. Jacqueline Hart doesn't have creators' interests in mind. She doesn't have the community's
265840	270320	interests in mind. She has the bank's interests in mind. Nonetheless, Patreon would continue to
270320	275440	double down. A fellow named Nuance Bro was on a call with Patreon, a call he wasn't allowed to
275440	280080	record, and in it, Patreon told him that this was not the first strike on Sargon's account.
280080	284640	Nuance Bro later received this email. Jacqueline asked me to send over these two bits of
284640	289840	information your way. The two links refer to the 2017 VidCon incident, where Sargon was sitting
289840	294720	front row at one of Anita Sarkeesian's talks, quietly listening, Anita decided to point him
294720	299120	out to the crowd, calling him a garbage human, and the entirety of the radical left, including
299120	304400	VidCon's weak need operators, decided to come down on Sargon for harassing Anita with his presence.
304800	308560	If you google my name on YouTube, you get shitheads like this dude, who are making these
308560	313840	dumbass videos, that just say the same shit, but they're effortless. I can't give you attention,
313840	322240	because you're a garbage human. Whatever, dude. But the fact that these dudes are making endless
322240	327520	videos that just go after every feminist, over and over and over again, I think is a part of the
327520	332320	issue of why we have to have these conversations. We don't just get to be online. This event was
332320	336640	already considered by Patreon to be a potential reason to remove Sargon from the platform,
336640	342960	but they ruled in his favour over a year ago. The case was closed, and yet now, it's considered
342960	347680	part of their manifest observable behaviour bullshit. And considering Jacqueline's extensive
347680	352080	history with PayPal, I think it's important to discuss the PayPal Patreon relationship.
352080	356400	Patreon initially had a lot of trouble getting PayPal to work with them, due to Patreon allowing
356400	361760	adult content and PayPal expressly forbidding it. What's interesting is that PayPal cut a
361760	366320	specific deal with Patreon to peddle in the not-safe-for-work, and explicitly stated that
366320	370800	this was a privilege for Patreon only, and not an overarching change in their policy.
370800	375680	This is important because it provides context regarding how Patreon treats its competitors.
375680	379840	A similar startup to Patreon, Memberful, was bought out by them last August,
379840	384000	and an article written about the event puts forward the theory that as content platforms
384000	388720	begin to popularize their own payment methods, like YouTube superchats, Twitch subs, and so on,
388720	392560	Patreon may be feeling the pressure to consolidate its industry. I'm going to speculate here a bit,
392560	396480	so this is just my opinion, but let's set the stage. Patreon has a special relationship with
396480	402000	PayPal. Patreon takes on a new trust and safety head, Jacqueline Hart, who used to work at PayPal.
402000	406720	Within three months of Jacqueline working at Patreon, Patreon bans Sargon, and Conte,
406720	411920	Hart, and her trust and safety team can only offer up deliberate misquotes, old matters already
411920	416320	settled by their team, and blatant lies about the terms of service to justify the banning.
416320	420880	And then, when Sargon is invited to join SubscribeStar, another Patreon alternative run
420880	425920	by a CEO who, based on his various writings on the topic, seems more committed to free speech
425920	431040	and less likely to be taken over like Memberful was, SubscribeStar sees PayPal and Stripe pull
431040	436320	out of their operation within days. In my opinion, this is the behavior of a cartel, not a free
436320	441040	market, and according to some videos on the YouTube Lawyers channel, there may be grounds for legal
441040	447200	action regarding the US's antitrust laws. There are a lot of what's called conscious parallelism,
447200	452560	or parallel consciousness, I'm not sure what's the correct term here. The idea being that
452560	457360	competitors often follow one another, and the fact that you can point to two companies doing
457360	461920	what is otherwise the same kind of action, let's say banning people of a certain political belief
461920	467520	or certain political persuasion, that in itself doesn't show you any concerted effort that
467520	472960	otherwise would be considered illegal, let's say, under antitrust law. Something changed here.
472960	478000	A lot of people said, we have to get off of Patreon. But not just get off of Patreon,
478000	482880	they said, no, there is a solution, let's move to SubscribeStar. SubscribeStar, up until that point,
482880	488880	I never heard about. And almost immediately PayPal responded. First it was PayPal, now it was Stripe
488880	496000	2, pulling their payment capability, their credit card processing and cashing ability from
496000	501280	Subscribestar. We've seen PayPal pull support for Gab. That did not make any difference,
501280	507920	at least in my mind. Why? Because if PayPal acts in a way that's anti-competitive, right,
507920	514320	against a company such as Gab. Gab is not a competitor to PayPal. PayPal is permitted to
514320	519840	express its ideals. You might disagree with it, but it's called freedom of speech. They're entitled,
519840	525040	just like you, to express, and they're expressing their ideals through their actions. So when I saw
525040	531120	Patreon ban Stargun of Akkad, okay, it's conscious parallelism, okay? It could be unrelated
531120	536640	companies, unrelated decision by multiple companies to do the same thing, maybe cultural.
536640	543360	But then almost immediately we saw an action by PayPal against Subscribestar. Now, it's a brand
543360	551680	new company, for all purposes, did nothing wrong except be a competitor to Patreon, who suddenly
551680	560880	got a lot of free publicity because they became the only real alternative to Patreon. What I saw
560880	568800	is PayPal, a credit card processing, react to something that was going to affect Patreon from
568800	573920	a competitive perspective, and that changed everything. Since this all went down, a lot of
573920	578320	people have pulled out of Patreon. Many large creators, as well as thousands of contributors,
578320	582800	have simply decided to leave the platform, even though there's not yet a stable alternative. We
582800	587120	went over a number of them during Dumping with Scrump, but even more have left since then,
587120	591520	including the aforementioned YouTube lawyer, as well as the fifth largest account on the platform,
591520	596240	Sword and Scale. Sword and Scale is a largely apolitical operation, and there are a few people
596240	600560	lambasting them on Twitter, claiming that they're caving to alt-right pressure, which is ridiculous,
600560	605760	seeing as it is Patreon that has caved to an alt-right email campaign against Sargon. But here's
605760	611200	what these people, and creators like Jeff Holiday whining away about his income, don't understand.
611200	616560	This actually isn't about politics. I mean, sure, it's about Sargon's politics. His channel's
616560	620560	political, and it seems like Jacqueline's been looking for a reason to sweep him off the platform
620560	624800	since she arrived. Her actions were political, and she's grasping at whatever straws she can
624800	629600	to try and salvage her dumpster fire company. Jacqueline herself seems to be a corporatized
629600	634000	variant of the SJW, with her personal Twitter talking about women's only business events,
634000	639360	and hashtag WeRunTheWorld and other such nonsense. But the event itself, the Patreon Purge,
639360	644800	the crowds of people abandoning the company for Subscribestar and Gab's upcoming payment processor,
644800	649840	and Jordan Peterson's In The Work solution, all that has become apolitical. It's not about the
649840	654560	politics of Sargon or the counter-politics of Patreon anymore. Patreon's business model is
654560	659680	based on consumer trust, more so than other tech companies like Facebook, Twitter, or Google.
659680	664480	It has to be. Patreon skims off the top as part of its service to crowdfund creators.
664480	669760	People directly give Patreon money, and Patreon just torpedoed the public trust in its platform
669760	674320	over an ideological spat that a new employee instigated. And it is ideological, because you
674320	680080	can hop on Patreon right now and find the very word Sargon used off platform directly on their
680080	685920	website, by creators who, right now, aren't banned. But more than that, you can find Patreon
685920	690720	profiles advocating for leftist violence and revolution, right in their award tiers.
690720	694480	People have asked Patreon about this, and Patreon said that they just can't comment on other
694480	699760	people's accounts. But wait a minute, that's all Patreon's been doing ever since this whole thing
699760	704320	kicked up. They'll email Sargon's fans about it, they'll talk to people on the phone, Jacqueline
704320	709440	will pen a sloppy response piece, pissing on Patreon's users and calling it rain, but now you
709440	713760	won't talk about other people's accounts? This is why Patreon has lost the public's trust.
713760	719200	The business world likes certainty. Entrepreneurs like to be able to make plans, grow a consumer
719200	723680	base, and at least be given the opportunity to make reasonable estimations about the future
723680	728640	and invest accordingly. This is why Venezuela is a shithole, and why any other form of socialism
728640	733520	or communism invariably turns into a shithole. If an all-powerful authority can come along and
733520	738400	wipe out your investments, seize your property, and leave you with nothing, nobody's going to
738400	742960	work or invest long term. They'll get what they can while the getting's good, because trust in
742960	747600	the system has been shattered, and people no longer think that, even with proper precautions,
747600	751520	there's a high chance of long term planning and investing in the future working out.
751520	756400	Patreon has sent all of us a very clear message. They have the power to destroy businesses without
756400	761440	warning. They can decide something you said a year ago is now bad. They can decide issues put to bed
761440	766160	two years ago can be brought up again. They will make new rules and enforce them retroactively.
766160	771280	And no defense will ever be enough. And because this isn't just views or clicks, like on YouTube
771360	776160	or whatever, but people's own money that they're spending, they're pulling out. And of course they
776160	782640	are. Why wouldn't they be? Patreon as an investment is unstable, unpredictable, and dangerous to rely
782640	787760	on. Nobody's going to start up a factory in Venezuela. Why would they open a Patreon account?
787760	792560	And I think partly what a lot of your creators are fearing now is that mob rule. It'll just get
792560	797040	kicked up enough and that you'll just be under pressure, sort of that the dam has broke already.
797040	801520	I think that's a big fear here. No, I just completely disagree with that. And
801520	808960	anybody who's watching who's worried about that. Yeah, we're just it's a different system. You just
808960	813600	don't have to worry about this shit. You just don't have to worry about it. Like people like
813600	819120	you and people, most people who are like engaging in healthy dialogue and talking about tough issues
819120	825360	like this is just not something that concerns most creators. And it like kills me a little bit that
825360	826560	there's this fear.
