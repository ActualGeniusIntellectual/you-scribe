00:00.000 --> 00:04.240
During yesterday's Dumping with Scrump, on the whole Patreon purge thing,

00:04.240 --> 00:08.080
Scrump and I missed a few important bits of information. To be frank, we recorded that

00:08.080 --> 00:13.200
Monday. And the video came out on Thursday, so a few new events have developed during that time

00:13.200 --> 00:17.840
period. Let's discuss them now. Very quickly, Sargon of Akkad was removed from Patreon. They

00:17.840 --> 00:23.120
claim it's due to some racial epithets he used during a livestream on Michelle Caitlin's relatively

00:23.120 --> 00:26.800
tiny channel. This is what I mean about the channel, I just can't be bothered to deal with

00:27.680 --> 00:45.360
this. The context, as best as I can figure out, is that he was addressing some members of the

00:45.360 --> 00:50.160
alt-right in the chatroom of that stream, and he insulted them by accusing them of being exactly

00:50.160 --> 00:54.400
what they hate the most, and he used their racially charged language to do it. Seeing

00:54.400 --> 00:58.960
as that stream was 10 months old, and that recently both people from the COW boards on

00:58.960 --> 01:04.960
8chan and Ethan Ralph's Discord have been mass emailing a paste bin containing this stream and

01:04.960 --> 01:10.080
other events to Patreon, it's highly likely that Patreon wasn't aware of this stream before these

01:10.080 --> 01:15.280
groups sent them the info, in my opinion. However, due to both the wording of Patreon's terms of

01:15.280 --> 01:20.400
service, as well as an interview with Patreon's CEO, Jack Conte, it's clear that Patreon's

01:20.400 --> 01:37.760
official stance is that it does not ban for off-platform action, which suddenly casts

01:37.760 --> 01:41.600
Patreon's credibility into doubt because that is exactly what they have done with Sargon.

01:41.600 --> 01:47.120
Patreon's emails to Sargon stated that because Sargon's Patreon was about his Sargon brand,

01:47.120 --> 01:52.480
and because the Sargon brand is known for making guest appearances on other people's streams,

01:52.480 --> 01:56.400
technically Sargon's appearance on Michelle Caitlin's channel was still covered by the

01:56.400 --> 02:00.880
terms of service. That's quite a stretch, but it's one that Patreon doubled down on,

02:00.880 --> 02:06.160
with Jack Conte stating in a private message with Tim Poole that he knew the terms of service was

02:06.160 --> 02:11.120
worded in such a way that it was not obvious to anyone that Sargon's behaviours violated it.

02:11.120 --> 02:15.520
Despite this, Patreon's Jacqueline Hart, speaking for their Trust and Safety committee,

02:15.520 --> 02:21.040
penned a response to the whole thing titled Hate Speech on Patreon. This response contains a

02:21.040 --> 02:25.520
transcript of Sargon's remarks on Michelle Caitlin's channel, with Jacqueline providing

02:25.520 --> 02:30.480
Patreon's reasoning as to why this somehow violates their terms of service despite being

02:30.480 --> 02:36.400
off-site. She specifically says, in this case, Sargon used racial slurs to insult others,

02:36.400 --> 02:40.000
and specifically linked those slurs with negative generalizations of behaviour,

02:40.000 --> 02:44.960
in contrast to how people of other races act. He also used a slur related to sexual orientation

02:44.960 --> 02:49.760
to generally insult others, taken in whole with all of the context. This violates our

02:49.760 --> 02:54.160
community guidelines. But that wasn't with all of the context, was it Jacqueline?

02:54.160 --> 02:57.760
Nick Monroe, known primarily for being a stand-up chap on Twitter,

02:57.760 --> 03:02.160
did the hard work of rewatching the Sargon remarks, making a direct transcript,

03:02.160 --> 03:06.480
and comparing that with what Jacqueline provided as a justification in her response piece.

03:06.480 --> 03:11.440
There's some striking differences. As it turns out, Patreon's transcript of the stream removes

03:11.440 --> 03:16.080
the fact that Sargon was referring specifically to people he identified as alt-right trolls within

03:16.080 --> 03:20.880
the livestream's chat room. Without this context, it sounds like Sargon's just on a diatribe.

03:20.880 --> 03:25.520
An entire paragraph is skipped over, further providing context that Sargon's replying to the

03:25.520 --> 03:31.040
chat, but even more telling, mentions of Sargon's working-class background is also removed from

03:31.040 --> 03:36.160
Patreon's quotation. In the third paragraph, Patreon explicitly leaves out another reference

03:36.160 --> 03:40.720
to the working-class side of the conversation. Jacqueline did not provide all of the context,

03:40.800 --> 03:45.520
as she claims, but left more than half of the conversation on the cutting room floor,

03:45.520 --> 03:49.520
specifically the parts that would run counter to the idea that Sargon is a racist.

03:49.520 --> 03:54.160
And it's this narrative that the media would run with, publishing articles that misquote

03:54.160 --> 03:58.960
Jacqueline's interpretation of the truth, with the consequence of their content straying even

03:58.960 --> 04:03.040
further from the mark. When you look up Jacqueline Hart on LinkedIn, you'll find she's got an

04:03.040 --> 04:06.800
impressive resume. She's only been at Patreon for the past three months, but she has a number

04:06.800 --> 04:11.760
of successful financial and banking jobs under her belt, including an eight-year stint at PayPal.

04:11.760 --> 04:16.400
She's a banker. She's not a community manager. She's not somebody fit for the Trust and Safety

04:16.400 --> 04:21.840
Board at Patreon, unless that phrase refers to the trust of investors and the safety of Patreon from

04:21.840 --> 04:25.840
lawsuits. Jacqueline Hart doesn't have creators' interests in mind. She doesn't have the community's

04:25.840 --> 04:30.320
interests in mind. She has the bank's interests in mind. Nonetheless, Patreon would continue to

04:30.320 --> 04:35.440
double down. A fellow named Nuance Bro was on a call with Patreon, a call he wasn't allowed to

04:35.440 --> 04:40.080
record, and in it, Patreon told him that this was not the first strike on Sargon's account.

04:40.080 --> 04:44.640
Nuance Bro later received this email. Jacqueline asked me to send over these two bits of

04:44.640 --> 04:49.840
information your way. The two links refer to the 2017 VidCon incident, where Sargon was sitting

04:49.840 --> 04:54.720
front row at one of Anita Sarkeesian's talks, quietly listening, Anita decided to point him

04:54.720 --> 04:59.120
out to the crowd, calling him a garbage human, and the entirety of the radical left, including

04:59.120 --> 05:04.400
VidCon's weak need operators, decided to come down on Sargon for harassing Anita with his presence.

05:04.800 --> 05:08.560
If you google my name on YouTube, you get shitheads like this dude, who are making these

05:08.560 --> 05:13.840
dumbass videos, that just say the same shit, but they're effortless. I can't give you attention,

05:13.840 --> 05:22.240
because you're a garbage human. Whatever, dude. But the fact that these dudes are making endless

05:22.240 --> 05:27.520
videos that just go after every feminist, over and over and over again, I think is a part of the

05:27.520 --> 05:32.320
issue of why we have to have these conversations. We don't just get to be online. This event was

05:32.320 --> 05:36.640
already considered by Patreon to be a potential reason to remove Sargon from the platform,

05:36.640 --> 05:42.960
but they ruled in his favour over a year ago. The case was closed, and yet now, it's considered

05:42.960 --> 05:47.680
part of their manifest observable behaviour bullshit. And considering Jacqueline's extensive

05:47.680 --> 05:52.080
history with PayPal, I think it's important to discuss the PayPal Patreon relationship.

05:52.080 --> 05:56.400
Patreon initially had a lot of trouble getting PayPal to work with them, due to Patreon allowing

05:56.400 --> 06:01.760
adult content and PayPal expressly forbidding it. What's interesting is that PayPal cut a

06:01.760 --> 06:06.320
specific deal with Patreon to peddle in the not-safe-for-work, and explicitly stated that

06:06.320 --> 06:10.800
this was a privilege for Patreon only, and not an overarching change in their policy.

06:10.800 --> 06:15.680
This is important because it provides context regarding how Patreon treats its competitors.

06:15.680 --> 06:19.840
A similar startup to Patreon, Memberful, was bought out by them last August,

06:19.840 --> 06:24.000
and an article written about the event puts forward the theory that as content platforms

06:24.000 --> 06:28.720
begin to popularize their own payment methods, like YouTube superchats, Twitch subs, and so on,

06:28.720 --> 06:32.560
Patreon may be feeling the pressure to consolidate its industry. I'm going to speculate here a bit,

06:32.560 --> 06:36.480
so this is just my opinion, but let's set the stage. Patreon has a special relationship with

06:36.480 --> 06:42.000
PayPal. Patreon takes on a new trust and safety head, Jacqueline Hart, who used to work at PayPal.

06:42.000 --> 06:46.720
Within three months of Jacqueline working at Patreon, Patreon bans Sargon, and Conte,

06:46.720 --> 06:51.920
Hart, and her trust and safety team can only offer up deliberate misquotes, old matters already

06:51.920 --> 06:56.320
settled by their team, and blatant lies about the terms of service to justify the banning.

06:56.320 --> 07:00.880
And then, when Sargon is invited to join SubscribeStar, another Patreon alternative run

07:00.880 --> 07:05.920
by a CEO who, based on his various writings on the topic, seems more committed to free speech

07:05.920 --> 07:11.040
and less likely to be taken over like Memberful was, SubscribeStar sees PayPal and Stripe pull

07:11.040 --> 07:16.320
out of their operation within days. In my opinion, this is the behavior of a cartel, not a free

07:16.320 --> 07:21.040
market, and according to some videos on the YouTube Lawyers channel, there may be grounds for legal

07:21.040 --> 07:27.200
action regarding the US's antitrust laws. There are a lot of what's called conscious parallelism,

07:27.200 --> 07:32.560
or parallel consciousness, I'm not sure what's the correct term here. The idea being that

07:32.560 --> 07:37.360
competitors often follow one another, and the fact that you can point to two companies doing

07:37.360 --> 07:41.920
what is otherwise the same kind of action, let's say banning people of a certain political belief

07:41.920 --> 07:47.520
or certain political persuasion, that in itself doesn't show you any concerted effort that

07:47.520 --> 07:52.960
otherwise would be considered illegal, let's say, under antitrust law. Something changed here.

07:52.960 --> 07:58.000
A lot of people said, we have to get off of Patreon. But not just get off of Patreon,

07:58.000 --> 08:02.880
they said, no, there is a solution, let's move to SubscribeStar. SubscribeStar, up until that point,

08:02.880 --> 08:08.880
I never heard about. And almost immediately PayPal responded. First it was PayPal, now it was Stripe

08:08.880 --> 08:16.000
2, pulling their payment capability, their credit card processing and cashing ability from

08:16.000 --> 08:21.280
Subscribestar. We've seen PayPal pull support for Gab. That did not make any difference,

08:21.280 --> 08:27.920
at least in my mind. Why? Because if PayPal acts in a way that's anti-competitive, right,

08:27.920 --> 08:34.320
against a company such as Gab. Gab is not a competitor to PayPal. PayPal is permitted to

08:34.320 --> 08:39.840
express its ideals. You might disagree with it, but it's called freedom of speech. They're entitled,

08:39.840 --> 08:45.040
just like you, to express, and they're expressing their ideals through their actions. So when I saw

08:45.040 --> 08:51.120
Patreon ban Stargun of Akkad, okay, it's conscious parallelism, okay? It could be unrelated

08:51.120 --> 08:56.640
companies, unrelated decision by multiple companies to do the same thing, maybe cultural.

08:56.640 --> 09:03.360
But then almost immediately we saw an action by PayPal against Subscribestar. Now, it's a brand

09:03.360 --> 09:11.680
new company, for all purposes, did nothing wrong except be a competitor to Patreon, who suddenly

09:11.680 --> 09:20.880
got a lot of free publicity because they became the only real alternative to Patreon. What I saw

09:20.880 --> 09:28.800
is PayPal, a credit card processing, react to something that was going to affect Patreon from

09:28.800 --> 09:33.920
a competitive perspective, and that changed everything. Since this all went down, a lot of

09:33.920 --> 09:38.320
people have pulled out of Patreon. Many large creators, as well as thousands of contributors,

09:38.320 --> 09:42.800
have simply decided to leave the platform, even though there's not yet a stable alternative. We

09:42.800 --> 09:47.120
went over a number of them during Dumping with Scrump, but even more have left since then,

09:47.120 --> 09:51.520
including the aforementioned YouTube lawyer, as well as the fifth largest account on the platform,

09:51.520 --> 09:56.240
Sword and Scale. Sword and Scale is a largely apolitical operation, and there are a few people

09:56.240 --> 10:00.560
lambasting them on Twitter, claiming that they're caving to alt-right pressure, which is ridiculous,

10:00.560 --> 10:05.760
seeing as it is Patreon that has caved to an alt-right email campaign against Sargon. But here's

10:05.760 --> 10:11.200
what these people, and creators like Jeff Holiday whining away about his income, don't understand.

10:11.200 --> 10:16.560
This actually isn't about politics. I mean, sure, it's about Sargon's politics. His channel's

10:16.560 --> 10:20.560
political, and it seems like Jacqueline's been looking for a reason to sweep him off the platform

10:20.560 --> 10:24.800
since she arrived. Her actions were political, and she's grasping at whatever straws she can

10:24.800 --> 10:29.600
to try and salvage her dumpster fire company. Jacqueline herself seems to be a corporatized

10:29.600 --> 10:34.000
variant of the SJW, with her personal Twitter talking about women's only business events,

10:34.000 --> 10:39.360
and hashtag WeRunTheWorld and other such nonsense. But the event itself, the Patreon Purge,

10:39.360 --> 10:44.800
the crowds of people abandoning the company for Subscribestar and Gab's upcoming payment processor,

10:44.800 --> 10:49.840
and Jordan Peterson's In The Work solution, all that has become apolitical. It's not about the

10:49.840 --> 10:54.560
politics of Sargon or the counter-politics of Patreon anymore. Patreon's business model is

10:54.560 --> 10:59.680
based on consumer trust, more so than other tech companies like Facebook, Twitter, or Google.

10:59.680 --> 11:04.480
It has to be. Patreon skims off the top as part of its service to crowdfund creators.

11:04.480 --> 11:09.760
People directly give Patreon money, and Patreon just torpedoed the public trust in its platform

11:09.760 --> 11:14.320
over an ideological spat that a new employee instigated. And it is ideological, because you

11:14.320 --> 11:20.080
can hop on Patreon right now and find the very word Sargon used off platform directly on their

11:20.080 --> 11:25.920
website, by creators who, right now, aren't banned. But more than that, you can find Patreon

11:25.920 --> 11:30.720
profiles advocating for leftist violence and revolution, right in their award tiers.

11:30.720 --> 11:34.480
People have asked Patreon about this, and Patreon said that they just can't comment on other

11:34.480 --> 11:39.760
people's accounts. But wait a minute, that's all Patreon's been doing ever since this whole thing

11:39.760 --> 11:44.320
kicked up. They'll email Sargon's fans about it, they'll talk to people on the phone, Jacqueline

11:44.320 --> 11:49.440
will pen a sloppy response piece, pissing on Patreon's users and calling it rain, but now you

11:49.440 --> 11:53.760
won't talk about other people's accounts? This is why Patreon has lost the public's trust.

11:53.760 --> 11:59.200
The business world likes certainty. Entrepreneurs like to be able to make plans, grow a consumer

11:59.200 --> 12:03.680
base, and at least be given the opportunity to make reasonable estimations about the future

12:03.680 --> 12:08.640
and invest accordingly. This is why Venezuela is a shithole, and why any other form of socialism

12:08.640 --> 12:13.520
or communism invariably turns into a shithole. If an all-powerful authority can come along and

12:13.520 --> 12:18.400
wipe out your investments, seize your property, and leave you with nothing, nobody's going to

12:18.400 --> 12:22.960
work or invest long term. They'll get what they can while the getting's good, because trust in

12:22.960 --> 12:27.600
the system has been shattered, and people no longer think that, even with proper precautions,

12:27.600 --> 12:31.520
there's a high chance of long term planning and investing in the future working out.

12:31.520 --> 12:36.400
Patreon has sent all of us a very clear message. They have the power to destroy businesses without

12:36.400 --> 12:41.440
warning. They can decide something you said a year ago is now bad. They can decide issues put to bed

12:41.440 --> 12:46.160
two years ago can be brought up again. They will make new rules and enforce them retroactively.

12:46.160 --> 12:51.280
And no defense will ever be enough. And because this isn't just views or clicks, like on YouTube

12:51.360 --> 12:56.160
or whatever, but people's own money that they're spending, they're pulling out. And of course they

12:56.160 --> 13:02.640
are. Why wouldn't they be? Patreon as an investment is unstable, unpredictable, and dangerous to rely

13:02.640 --> 13:07.760
on. Nobody's going to start up a factory in Venezuela. Why would they open a Patreon account?

13:07.760 --> 13:12.560
And I think partly what a lot of your creators are fearing now is that mob rule. It'll just get

13:12.560 --> 13:17.040
kicked up enough and that you'll just be under pressure, sort of that the dam has broke already.

13:17.040 --> 13:21.520
I think that's a big fear here. No, I just completely disagree with that. And

13:21.520 --> 13:28.960
anybody who's watching who's worried about that. Yeah, we're just it's a different system. You just

13:28.960 --> 13:33.600
don't have to worry about this shit. You just don't have to worry about it. Like people like

13:33.600 --> 13:39.120
you and people, most people who are like engaging in healthy dialogue and talking about tough issues

13:39.120 --> 13:45.360
like this is just not something that concerns most creators. And it like kills me a little bit that

13:45.360 --> 13:46.560
there's this fear.
