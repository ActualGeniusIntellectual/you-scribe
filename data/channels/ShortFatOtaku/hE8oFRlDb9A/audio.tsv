0	19000	Every bread tuber and left youtuber makes a pipeline video. You know what I'm talking about right? Where they put out some video about how in 2014 they were part of gamergate, in 2016 they watched Sargon, and they were becoming a member of the alt-right. But somehow they were pulled out of the pipeline, they were saved.
19000	33000	They often begin such a video by decrying the competitive nature of video games, or the love of edgy humor within gaming culture, because competition is anti-equality and edgy humor is anti-safe space, making gaming on some level fundamentally anti-leftist. This is something I touched on in the last video.
33000	45000	And they haven't stopped making these videos, it seems like every week there is a new crumbtuber out there who's posting on twitter how they're making an alt-right pipeline radicalization video, and how much it would help him if people posted their own pipeline stories and spread it around.
45000	55000	The stories themselves are almost always the same kind of thing. These people grew up as a normie, believing in the normie liberal ideal as much as your average unengaged politically unaligned person did 10 or 20 years ago.
55000	61000	They viewed the broader left as liberation central, while it was right wing religious types who wanted to restrict freedom of speech.
61000	72000	So when the fringes of the left began to radicalize, and subsequently were featured on screaming feminist SJW owned compilations on youtube, which was quite an edgy platform back in the day, the normies watched those videos and laughed.
72000	80000	They were still committed to those values of free speech and openness, and it was novel to them that leftoids rather than rightoids for once were opposing those values.
80000	87000	After that though came the classical liberals who were dissecting why the champions of free speech and openness were suddenly betraying those values.
87000	95000	These were the Sargons and the Paul Joseph Watsons. Beyond them there were the conservatives, who were more than willing to take this new political shift and provide answers through their own lens.
95000	106000	The Milo Yiannopoulos's and Ben Shapiro's. You should notice that I am literally describing the leftist conception of the alt-right pipeline, and that's because on some level, yeah it's true. However the left gets a lot wrong about it.
106000	119000	Firstly, if the end of the pipeline is the alt-right, then it obviously doesn't end at Milo and Ben Shapiro. A white nationalist quasi-neo-fascist movement has no interest in gay or Jewish men. I can't believe that needs to be said, but here we are.
119000	130000	The pipeline to the extreme end of the right continues far beyond these two, but leftoids like to pretend that they're the end of the pipeline, as a way to crush the center, center right, mainstream right, and far right all into the same group.
130000	147000	Ignore all of their differences and act like your average person is just as bad as the most radicalized rightoid. Even though, of course, these same people will go to painstaking lengths to define minute differences between different flavors of leftist, and say that the center left sockdems are fundamentally different from the far left socialists.
147000	156000	Secondly, their pipeline theory extends far beyond gamergate to fascist, or 4chan to neo-nazi pipelines, and those ones are already ridiculously stupid.
156000	164000	If you think that nazis like edgy, irreverent jokes, tell a deformed dick, one-ball hitler joke in front of them and see how much they laugh.
164000	168000	But it's not just that. Have you ever heard of the country singer to alt-right pipeline? I know I haven't.
168000	181000	How about the divorced dad to alt-right pipeline? Joe Rogan to alt-right pipeline? Russell Brand to alt-right pipeline? Pewdiepie to alt-right pipeline? Is this just smaller pipelines branching off of the greater people who disagree with me to alt-right pipeline?
181000	189000	Hey, how about the private school to alt-right pipeline, guys? If you're not being told directly by the government what to do, you're apparently a nazi, which is the complete opposite in reality.
189000	196000	After Trump's victory in 2016, the media, in a desperate attempt to figure out what went wrong, latched onto the alt-right pipeline narrative too.
196000	205000	And even though Biden took the White House, and Trumpism was dealt a public, embarrassing blow during the January 6th Capitol riot, the media continues to lean on the pipeline thing.
205000	216000	Studies were commissioned on the nature of the pipeline, like the embarrassingly inaccurate evaluating the scale, growth, and origins of right-wing echo chambers on YouTube, which labeled shoe-on-head as right-wing.
216000	224000	But this is full of goodies. There's apparently a guy under far-left called cuck philosophy. Oh, Hugo and Jake is in here too, you're misgendering now, dude.
224000	229000	Maddox and Bunty King are put under centrist, even though those guys have swung quite far-left in recent years.
229000	240000	The far-right category, along with shoe, also contains It's a Gundam, Sargon, Academic Agent, Armored Skeptic, Repzion, Matt, Jarbo, Garopy, Joe Rogan, Dankula, the list goes on.
240000	245000	What they call far-right contains a wide variety of different people who are not at all politically aligned.
245000	250000	It's more like when they say left, they mean establishment, and when they say right, they mean outsider.
250000	255000	And yes, I'm in there too. I'm sure Academic Agent and I see eye-to-eye on tomboy abs.
255000	266000	There is also the infamous alternative influence, broadcasting the reactionary right on YouTube, detailing how political YouTubers adopt the platform, look, and tactics of non-political YouTubers, in an effort to radicalize people rightward.
266000	267000	In their view, anyway.
267000	285000	The report decries a segment of YouTube that has wildly different political beliefs, only similar to each other in that they are anti-leftist, ranging from conservatives, to libertarians, to monarchists, to white nationalists, and that these creators form a broader community created by an interconnected web of appearances on each other's channels, sometimes as guests, but other times as debate opponents.
285000	295000	The implication being that this web of connections creates a pipeline for viewers to be pushed down, even though in actuality, the people in this COMMUNITY disagree with each other regularly, they're just not explicitly leftist.
295000	302000	And the people who wrote this report view politics as being made up of my specific brand of leftism versus everybody else.
302000	309000	Thirdly, and perhaps most importantly, the implication surrounding the alt-right pipeline discourse is that radicalization is bad. Fair enough.
309000	313000	But there's obviously other pipelines that radicalize people leftward.
313000	320000	In fact, in people's I was saved from the alt-right pipeline stories, they almost always describe the exact same alt-left pipeline.
320000	327000	People start off watching iDubbbz or ChrisRayGun, they end up watching ShoeOnHead or ContraPoints, and then eventually they get to Vosh or the Serfs.
327000	331000	There absolutely is a pipeline leading from milk-toast progressive to tanky in denial.
331000	339000	Yes, I know Vosh calls himself a lib-sock and places himself in opposition to overt tankies, but as we've gone over in previous videos, that's a smokescreen and everybody knows it.
339000	343000	Now, if you were to approach leftists with this obvious double standard, you'd get one of two replies.
343000	345000	The first is just blanket denial.
345000	350000	The second is far more interesting, that radicalization leftward is good and radicalization rightward is bad.
350000	357000	Again, if you look at any lefty twitter spaces, you'll see people talking casually about how pulling others leftward is a victory.
357000	362000	They aren't interested in you as individuals, but only as fertile ground to colonize for their ideology.
362000	369000	They say nothing about changing people's habits or their inclinations towards harassment or violence, only that they're now playing for the correct political team.
369000	376000	This attitude, in fact, makes them more likely to be harassing or violent, because now they have moral righteousness on their side.
376000	385000	I used to be part of the bad team, but now I'm part of the good team, so if I do all that bad shit I used to do, but while waving the good flag and towards people waving the bad flag, then it's good.
385000	387000	How very Marcusean of you.
387000	396000	This is why a common leftist mantra is, let this radicalize you rather than leading you to despair, and why a common conversation is discussing what radicalized you or what caused you to wake up.
396000	400000	Again, using that quasi-religious awakening language you've talked about before.
400000	403000	These radicalized people use all of the tools of previous repressive regimes.
403000	405000	The big lie is now my truth.
405000	406000	Anecdotes are now lived experience.
406000	415000	Rejecting political neutrality in the marketplace of ideas has become cancel culture, which they then further cloak by calling it accountability because they've lost the optics war on canceling.
415000	418000	Bootlicking pride in the ideology is now called virtue signaling.
418000	421000	It's the same mechanisms retooled for the modern age.
421000	428000	As it turns out, the concept of a pipeline funneling people away from the left is also something that has been rebranded and retooled for leftist purposes.
428000	433000	It was once called the walk away movement, otherwise known as how I left the left.
433000	442000	In 2018, Brandon Straka, a gay Democrat, started the movement and tried to encourage disaffected liberals to leave the Democratic party and vote for Trump-leaning Republicans.
442000	450000	And, to the credit of people who actually view this as a radicalization effort, Straka was later arrested and convicted for his part in the January 6th Capitol riots.
450000	459000	The walk away movement did certainly appeal to people on the center left who found themselves slowly migrating rightward, as they felt that the left had abandoned them and their interests.
459000	469000	For example, Ariel Scarkella, a prominent lesbian activist, has recently swung rightward as the left has largely abandoned lesbian activism in favor of trans activism in the past decade.
469000	475000	In other people, for example, like Judith Rose, did legitimately fall down a QAnon rabbit hole after leaving the left.
475000	479000	But despite all of this, the walk away movement did actually speak to another segment of the population.
479000	486000	People who were legitimately still aligned with leftist social issues, but felt that, on other topics, the left was absolutely going too far,
486000	494000	whether that be economically in their swing towards overt socialism, or culturally, in their attempts to demonize and censor everybody who refused to march in lockstep with them.
494000	499000	It wasn't just all hidden rightoids, it absolutely was abandoned leftoids too.
499000	501000	And then you begin to notice some other subtle things.
501000	507000	It's not just that some people go PewDiePie to Ben Shapiro to Richard Spencer, it's that some people go CRG to shoot Vosch.
508000	512000	Where leftoids might ask what radicalized you, rightoids might ask what was your woke breaking point.
512000	522000	Another of those academic papers on the outright pipeline, this one called Alt-Right Pipeline, Individual Journeys to Extremism Online, identifies and describes three steps of right wing online extremism.
522000	530000	The first step is called normalization, where people become normalized to edgy humor and jokes about a group that the extremists want to see other dehumanized down the line.
530000	535000	Memes and jokes, therefore, are a key medium of radicalization and cannot be trusted.
535000	541000	The second step is acclamation. As the jokes become normalized, it establishes a new cognitive baseline for what is acceptable.
541000	549000	Suddenly there's a new edge to ride, and the former introductionary YouTubers like Steven Crowder or Paul Joseph Watson, who are merely conservatives, appear to be too centrist for their taste.
549000	552000	Their appetite for edgier content pushes them rightward.
552000	560000	The final step is dehumanization, where finally, the victim of the pipeline is able to commit violence against the targets of their ire, which began as simply edgy jokes.
560000	564000	The paper uses the example of the Christchurch shooter saying sub to PewDiePie during the live stream of his attack.
564000	570000	As evidence of this effect coming full circle. The paper describes this process as the collapse of the boundary between troll and extremist.
570000	573000	Now this happens sometimes, but not all the time.
573000	578000	There are absolutely people who say edgy jokes and don't mean them, and they don't radicalize, and that's that.
578000	584000	But more importantly, this is not unique to right wing radicalization. This is how all radicalization works.
584000	589000	Like Antifa or BLM attacking people and burning businesses, and yes, even killing people.
589000	590000	The same three steps are present.
590000	591000	Normalization.
591000	593000	Eat the rich. By the way, we're just joking.
593000	594000	Hashtag yes all men.
594000	595000	Cis white boys are the problem.
595000	596000	Acclamation.
596000	598000	Shoe on head is a reactionary libcuck.
598000	599000	Vosh is rad.
599000	601000	Oh, hold on. Vosh hides his power level too much.
601000	604000	Maybe it's time to start watching some overtly tanky channels.
604000	605000	Dehumanization.
605000	608000	Let's actually start killing or attacking our political opponents in the streets.
608000	613000	Because we've been told by our favorite YouTubers that only power matters, and winning is better than principles.
613000	617000	You call it selling out your principles? I call it fucking winning.
618000	625000	And that's my principle. To win as a socialist, not to lose as a socialist.
625000	630000	That's not my principle. I don't give a fuck about principled failure.
630000	633000	Principled failure is worth dogshit.
633000	638000	This mechanism that we're discussing, whatever it is, it's functioning on both sides of the aisle.
638000	641000	But the left only complains about it when it happens in favor of the right.
641000	646000	And I'm sure if the right held all the institutional power right now, they would only complain about it if it favored the left as well.
647000	650000	So, maybe we need to home in on something a bit more concrete.
650000	654000	Each side is convinced that it has the truth and the other is tainted by propaganda.
654000	658000	Which one of these views, if any, is actually mapping onto objective reality?
658000	663000	There's another study called Algorithmic Extremism examining YouTube's rabbit hole of radicalization.
663000	666000	And it can probably help us cut through some of the bullshit.
666000	675000	After categorizing nearly 800 political channels, we were able to differentiate between political schemas in order to analyze the algorithm traffic flows out and between each group.
675000	682000	After conducting a detailed analysis of the recommendations received by each channel type, we can refute the popular radicalization claims.
682000	689000	To the contrary, the data suggests that YouTube's recommendation algorithm actively discourages viewers from visiting radicalizing or extremist content.
689000	698000	Instead, the algorithm is shown to favor mainstream media and cable news content over independent YouTube channels with slants towards left-leaning or politically neutral channels.
698000	705000	Our study thus suggests that YouTube's recommendation algorithm fails to promote inflammatory or radicalized content, as previously claimed by several outlets.
705000	711000	So, if there is a pipeline effect moving people towards the right, it's not being caused by YouTube itself.
711000	719000	There have been other studies that have come out over the years showing that the left has independently radicalized over time since before even Trump came along.
719000	721000	Each of these show similar results.
721000	725000	The right has shifted a little bit rightward, but the left has absolutely spun itself off into crazy town.
725000	729000	And again, if you were to confront a leftist with this data, they would say, of course, leftist radicalization is good.
729000	731000	But that is not a good enough answer for me.
731000	732000	And I have no answer.
732000	733000	I have a hypothesis.
733000	735000	I'm not entirely sure if it's true, but maybe.
735000	739000	I've noticed that the broader left fervently believes in a unidirectional view of progress.
739000	743000	That history is meant to move along the long straight arrow of progress over time.
743000	745000	And that arrow, of course, points to the left.
745000	749000	They hold this belief because they view morality as if it were a science to be developed.
749000	754000	The same as alchemy eventually became chemistry, Newtonian physics was replaced with general relativity, and so on.
754000	759000	They see a steady march of history where kingdoms were replaced by republics and republics were replaced by socialist states.
759000	763000	And eventually, by a stateless, classless, moneyless, post-scarcity society.
763000	768000	They see the gradual expansion of civil liberties where slavery was made illegal, then served and abolished, then civil rights.
768000	771000	And they envision a future of totalizing equality.
771000	775000	Your average leftist will say something like, the left-right scale is a good evil scale.
775000	780000	And history in progress is meant to move leftward eternally over time with a straight face.
780000	783000	To contrast, the right wing believes in a cyclical view of progress.
783000	786000	That history moves in waves, empires ebb and flow.
786000	788000	And that this is a natural occurrence that can't be escaped.
788000	793000	They point to economics, where when people engage in a free market there is natural inequality.
793000	796000	And market forces will tend to see industries collapsing.
796000	801000	And market forces will tend to see industries collapsing and new enterprises appearing across large enough timeframes.
801000	807000	They correctly point out that the West's great material wealth hasn't led to the widespread happiness that was assumed.
807000	811000	And that more complicated lives may not necessarily be better for the common person.
811000	814000	They don't consider a utopia on earth to be possible the way the left does.
814000	818000	And they consider the world to be in a fallen state, whether that be for a religious reason.
818000	821000	Or due to the gradual loss of traditional culture to the passage of time.
821000	830000	Your average rightist will say something like, hard times create strong men, strong men create good times, good times create weak men, and weak men create hard times with a straight face.
830000	833000	In reality, politics seems to operate like a swinging pendulum.
833000	838000	One side pulls things two out of whack, the electorate ensures it swings back the other way in equal measure.
838000	840000	This is more of a cyclical system than a unidirectional one.
840000	845000	And the rightist view of the world seems to map more accurately onto the political sphere than the leftist one.
845000	849000	For decades, the left has been march of progressing its way ever leftward.
849000	852000	Moderates were left behind and labeled as reactionaries and fascists.
852000	853000	And Trump was the snapback.
853000	859000	There will likely be further snapbacks, like how we've seen republican governors in the states become more brazen in their rightism recently.
859000	862000	That doesn't mean that the leftist view of progress is completely wrong though.
862000	869000	Certainly with stuff like hard science, acquisition of knowledge, technology or engineering, there is a more linear model of progress happening in those fields.
869000	872000	But politics is a fundamentally different type of field.
872000	875000	I think what we're seeing is certainly partially a radicalization rightward.
875000	880000	People who are disillusioned by the left are absolutely prime targets to be scooped up and radicalized by rightist actors.
880000	883000	But I don't think that's the main cause of what we're seeing.
883000	888000	I think the big picture leftist view of progress and history does not map well onto politics.
888000	892000	Scientific progress may be unidirectional, but politics isn't a science.
892000	895000	Moving leftward eternally over time does not constitute true progress.
895000	902000	Especially when the left wants to regress into older failed ideas, like the economics of socialism or the tribalism of race and gender politics.
902000	910000	So what's actually happening here, at least in my opinion, is that leftists are seeing regular people, even their own allies sometimes, rebuke their more radical elements.
910000	913000	And in response they're thinking, everyone's a Nazi!
913000	915000	But what's actually happening is they're simply going too far.
915000	917000	I think we all know this intuitively.
917000	928000	50 years ago if you questioned authority, distrusted large corporations and governments, hated censorship, liked crass humor, thought schools brainwashed kids, and wanted to focus on domestic issues, you were absolutely a hippie leftist.
928000	930000	20 years ago you were a normal liberal.
930000	934000	But today, holding those opinions, we'll see leftists label you as a fascist.
934000	938000	The alt-right pipeline exists, sure, in some minimal capacity.
938000	947000	But the why I left the left, or the left left me behind narrative, explains what's actually going on here with far greater accuracy than the alt-right pipeline narrative.
947000	953000	Leftoids don't want to admit it because they don't want to look in the mirror and understand that they're the cause of a lot of the problems that they're currently facing.
