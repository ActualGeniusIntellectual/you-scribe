0	9800	Far right this, far right that, far right, far right, far right.
9800	15600	You see everything being labeled as far right nowadays, but what actually is the far right?
15600	21400	Now for the purposes of this video, I'm going to be using far right, alt right, Nazi, neo-Nazi,
21400	29160	fascist, conservative, neo-con, Republican, racist, sexist, homophobic, transphobic, Islamophobic,
29160	31280	etc., all as meaning the same thing.
31280	35520	Not because they are the same thing, they are certainly not, but rather because progressives
35520	37680	use them to mean the same thing.
37680	42480	These are all actually very different things, but a large swath of the left considers all
42480	44580	of these terms to be interchangeable.
44580	49240	And it may be I'm just an old man, but that's rather ridiculous to see even now.
49240	52580	Because it was once known to be one of the common rules of the internet, that if you
52580	57080	have to appeal to Hitler or Nazis, you automatically lost the argument.
57080	60960	The main reason being the Nazis are a joke, not because they weren't dangerous or evil
60960	66080	in their day, they certainly were, but because they've been largely gone since 1945.
66080	69640	So during those early days of the internet, generally you'd call somebody a Nazi if you
69640	73780	were joking, or alternatively if you wanted to impugn them in an over-the-top way.
73780	78140	Very rarely did anybody use the term Nazi to refer to people whom they thought actually
78140	82600	believed in Nazi ideology, and whenever we met people who still actually believed in
82600	85760	Nazi ideology, they were always laughed out of the room.
85760	89240	But now everyone's a Nazi, everything is far right, it's become ridiculous.
89240	92920	Here's a great example, these are the words of Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London.
92920	96560	It's un-British to roll out the red carpet for Donald Trump, the US president gives comfort
96560	99640	to the far right, the prime minister should speak truth to power.
99640	105080	So what do you expect, do you expect the UK to snub the leader of their greatest ally
105080	106080	for woke points?
106080	107080	Like what the fuck are you talking about here?
107080	112360	And of course he's talking about the very fine people on both sides comment that Trump
112360	116440	gave during Charlottesville, which as far as I can tell was still the truth.
116440	120480	Yes, there were bad actors at Charlottesville, there were absolutely real white supremacists
120480	124360	at Charlottesville, but most people on the right were not that.
124360	130000	You've got people like Nigel Farage being called fringe right-wing lunatics, and Nigel
130000	132980	Farage is certainly on the right, but is he fringe?
132980	135280	Is it fringe when the UK voted for Brexit?
135280	138040	That's not a fringe belief, it seems to be quite normal.
138040	144200	You've got Facebook banning Alex Jones, Mylionopolis, Louis Farrakhan, and other right-wing personalities.
144200	147860	Hold the fuck on, because Louis Farrakhan isn't right-wing, he's on the left.
147860	151280	The Tory membership is far-right, racist, and would cleanse Britain of minorities if
151280	152280	they had the chance.
152280	154080	Jesus Christ, dude.
154080	157840	Do you actually think it's conservative soccer moms who want to go out there and build the
157840	159680	next Auschwitz or something?
159680	163440	White nationalists are now using clowns to spread hatred.
163440	165120	Are clowns right-wing now?
165120	166580	Are clowns fascist?
166580	170900	The Cubs are investigating a fan's offensive hand gesture.
170900	171900	Which one is that?
171900	172900	I'm sure you already know.
172900	173900	Look at this hatred.
173900	178260	Look at this evil, vile, right-wing white supremacist as he makes that O shape with
178260	179860	his finger and thumb.
179860	184340	It summons up all of his white energy, which begins to charge in the empty space in the
184340	185340	middle.
185340	190520	Moments after this was taken, that poor black victim was blasted with direct, unfiltered
190520	191820	white supremacy.
191820	194820	Apparently Megan Murphy is going to be in an event with a number of alt-right figures
194820	200340	such as Andy Ngo, Sargon of Akkad, Claire Layman, Tim Pool, Count Dankula, Lauren Chen.
200340	204220	These individuals all have completely different ideologies.
204220	206940	You cannot simply lump them all together as alt-right.
206940	212140	There's a debate on Twitch right now featuring two big-time alt-righters, Sargon and Nick
212140	213300	Fuentes.
213300	217540	This is from 2019, and funnily enough, people now call Destiny who was on the left-wing
217540	219820	side of that debate alt-right.
219820	224260	The collusion between the military-industrial complex and video games industry is corruption.
224260	227260	Gamergate, if it had any legitimacy, should have been slamming it.
227260	230460	Sadly and predictably, Gamergate elevates the right-wing and Trump while supporting
230460	231460	harassment.
231460	235420	And being one of the biggest supporters of Gamergate, Carl Benjamin, aka Sargon of Akkad,
235420	240200	is dead silent given he's a right-wing hack, xenophobic nationalist, and Trump supporter
240200	242300	who loves joyless first-person shooters.
242300	245500	Now hold on, there's quite a lot of joy to be had in a good first-person shooter.
245500	248780	Things the right-wing gamer and anime audience is okay with.
248780	253420	Not-safe-for-work content that endangers or violates women, children, and the LGBT community.
253420	255860	Things the right-wing gamer and anime audience isn't okay with.
255860	260260	Safe-for-work content that empowers or supports women, children, and the LGBT community.
260260	261260	The fuck does this even mean?
261260	263540	Like, are you complaining that there's boobs in video games?
263540	267060	Are you complaining that porn exists, that hentai exists on the internet?
267060	271020	If I see an anime girl get fucked in a video, how does that violate women?
271020	273900	I guess enjoying porn or liking titties is right-wing now.
273900	276640	This is regarding the cancelling of Ricky Gervais back in 2020.
276640	280800	The idea that celebrities are not only pampered babies, but hypocrites who cause the problems
280800	285400	they make speeches deploring and should therefore shut up and act or sing or be grateful is
285400	286560	a right-wing talking point.
286560	290920	Okay, so if you don't like celebrities, if you think they're out of touch, it's right-wing.
290920	292560	It's a right-wing talking point.
292560	297600	The far-right are uniting around their right to free speech, aka spreading a load of racist
297600	298600	bullshit.
298600	300560	Free speech is far-right.
300560	303120	The Gilroy shooter was a far-right supremacist.
303120	307240	CNN recklessly speculates the Dayton shooter may have been politically motivated.
307240	311720	The shooter's tweets or politics have zero relevancy so far because he killed indiscriminately.
311720	314440	Yeah, that guy was a left-winger.
314440	318040	Inside the mind of Ben Shapiro, the alt-right sage without the rage.
318040	319160	Ben is just a regular conservative.
319160	322400	You're not going to find much white supremacy in The Jewish Man.
322400	327760	Race science guru Sam Harris, that's quite the title, just deleted his Patreon earlier
327760	328760	today.
328760	331400	Dave Reuben and Jordan Peterson claim they're also leaving the platform and are in talks
331400	336160	with investors about building a Patreon for free speech lovers, aka a white nationalist
336160	337760	crowdfunding platform.
337760	341600	Free speech lovers are white nationalists now, using a Patreon alternative as white
341600	342600	nationalists.
342600	344120	Fucking incredible.
344120	348440	Racist and white supremacist ideas have become more visible among the Chinese-Canadian right.
348440	350720	If they're Chinese, they can't be white supremacists, you know that, right?
350720	352400	I mean, they can be Chinese supremacists.
352400	355640	I guess they can be white supremacists if they're idiots and they actually believe in
355640	357660	the inferiority of their own race.
357660	360520	White supremacy is gateway to the American mind.
360520	364620	Amazon's self-publishing arm gives extremists and neo-Nazis banned from other platforms
364620	367180	unprecedented access to a mass audience.
367180	373600	If you self-publish on Amazon, you are a white supremacist neo-Nazi extremist.
373600	378780	Far-right extremists use GameStop chaos to radicalize and recruit on Telegram.
378780	382640	If you buy GameStop stocks, you're far right, guys.
382640	385760	There is a serious problem where Nazis are indoctrinating the hell out of our entire
385760	389680	generation of children through things like Minecraft videos on YouTube.
389680	393260	If we don't do something about it, we'll have a bunch of fascist teens in a few years.
393260	396620	Turns out that when a whole generation of parents completely abdicate their basic moral
396620	400700	duties and let their children watch PewDiePie instead of Big Bird, they grow up thinking
400700	404380	it's their duty to send death threats to queer people and anyone making wholesome art
404380	405460	and entertainment.
405460	410140	This literally just sounds like you being an angry, aging Karen, not understanding that
410140	414180	you're no longer young and cool and the kids are doing something else nowadays.
414180	416180	But no, I guess if you like PewDiePie, you're a Nazi.
416180	419780	By subscribing to PewDiePie, you're supporting somebody who has repeatedly given exposure
419780	422660	to a crypto-fascist and Nazi propagandist.
422660	427380	This is in reference to Ben Shapiro once hosting Meme Review on PewDiePie's channel.
427380	431020	Jonathan Pye taking selfies with UKIP and Tommy Robinson supporters.
431020	432340	They treat him like a hero.
432340	434740	If you like Jonathan Pye, I guess you're part of the far right.
434740	436860	I'm going to give you a bunch of headlines real quick.
436860	437900	Which ones are the fake ones?
437900	440300	Some Trump supporters are co-opting the American flag.
440300	441860	Nazis once did that too.
441860	444780	Inside the alt-right's bizarre obsession with hydration.
444780	448700	Although research debunks white supremacists' claims about the benefits of hydration, like
448700	451980	the myth that it improves your complexion, water drinking has been a staple trope of
451980	455140	American racists since the days of segregated drinking fountains.
455140	458060	The extreme right has a new hobby and it's terrifying.
458060	462140	Hate groups are getting into books and are even encouraging others to read too.
462140	465100	Laughter, the new symbol of the far right.
465100	467300	Dear men, stop working out.
467300	470340	Physical fitness creates a cycle of toxic masculinity that must be eradicated.
470340	472380	It's kind of hard to tell, isn't it?
472380	475400	The fake ones were the water one and the reading one.
475400	476740	The rest of them were all real.
476740	481420	Remember, opposing abortion makes you proponent, unwilling or not, of the far right.
481420	485780	The patriarchal control of women's autonomy, the degradation of bodily autonomy, pseudo-scientific
485780	493460	ideas about life, erasure of LGBTQ people via cisnormative gender ideas and pregnancy.
493460	498100	You know, if you're LGBTQ, you're probably not really that at risk of getting pregnant,
498100	499100	I would guess.
499100	500420	There's no compromise or leeway.
500420	504060	If you're going to go around bad-mouthing abortion, spreading blatantly false and incorrect
504060	509660	information, actively campaign for the removal of human rights, you are contributing to fascism.
509660	513580	It's just in general worth remembering that if fascists controlled the terms of debate,
513580	514580	they would shoot you.
514580	516900	If they debate you, it's because they think this is helpful in getting to a point where
516900	517900	they can shoot you.
517900	521260	So if you like debate, if you want to debate something, you're a fascist.
521260	525700	On thinner bodies, the strawberry TikTok dress skews a tiny bit fascist.
525700	530940	So if you're not a complete fat shit and you wear a trad dress, you're a fascist.
530940	532720	A fascist exercise today?
532720	533720	Did you?
533720	537740	Fuck no, because regimented exercise is actually fundamentally fascist itself.
537740	539580	Do you lift weights?
539580	540580	Do you jog?
540580	541580	Do you do yoga?
541580	542580	Do you do any of that shit?
542580	543580	Do you take care of yourself?
543580	544780	Do you live a healthy life?
544780	546300	You're a fascist.
546300	551980	When somebody accuses me for being a transphobic racist and a sexist for liking and being an
551980	557500	Asian trap, using footage of a white nationalist to prove you're not racist, sexist or transphobic.
557500	558500	John's Persian.
558500	559500	He's not white.
559500	561580	He's from the Middle East.
561580	565340	88 and HH phrases like honk honk.
565340	566340	They're fascist.
566340	567340	They mean Heil Hitler.
567340	570580	HH is the eighth letter of the alphabet, thus 88.
570580	576780	Honk honk is associated with the Honkler and is often used ironically by alt-right trolls.
576780	581620	Socialists on social media are a perpetual motion machine of clown world takes about
581620	582620	clown world.
582620	585220	Guys, we're like 50 layers of honk deep right now.
585220	586220	Oh, hey, Lilith.
586220	587220	You're in here too.
587220	591520	2016 punch Nazis, 2019 punch people who like PewDiePie.
591520	596220	Today marks the European day of remembrance for victims of Stalinism and Nazism.
597220	599260	You mean Nazi war criminals.
599260	602780	You want us to remember Nazi war criminals along with Nazi victims.
602780	607900	So if you were killed by Stalin, if you were put in the gulags, if you were killed by the
607900	613380	socialist authoritarian regimes of the 20th century, you're a Nazi TikTok, which is mega
613380	618740	popular with children and teens, has a problem with blatant violent white supremacy and Nazism.
618740	620420	If you use TikTok, you're a Nazi.
620420	624580	We'll introduce you to a trad wife, a young woman who has chosen to be a traditional wife,
624580	627580	staying at home to take care of household chores while her husband works.
627580	631340	And she is fine with submitting to her husband as he makes the key decisions in their lives.
631340	632740	Who needs YouTube rabbit holes?
632740	637300	And you have the BBC broadcasting literal white supremacist propaganda.
637300	641420	So if you're, if you're a woman who wants to live in a more traditional manner, if you
641420	644460	want to stay at home and take care of the house and take care of the kids, you're a
644460	649420	white supremacist, even though lots of non-white women do this, it doesn't matter.
649420	650420	Drive me a car.
650420	651980	You are a Nazi.
651980	652980	Vroom, vroom.
652980	656380	My little pony fans are ready to admit they have a Nazi problem.
656380	657380	What's going on?
657380	659740	Are they rounding up all the earth ponies and putting them in camps or something?
659740	665540	The claim Trump's campaign shirts feature the Imperial Eagle, a Nazi symbol, are ruling
665540	666540	true.
666540	668940	Are you, are you fucking kidding me?
668940	675960	Eagles, the national bird of the United States is a Nazi bird now is the Snyder cut fascist.
675960	679200	That's the discourse of the day, which is hilariously the wrong question.
679200	682620	The right question is what fucking superhero movie isn't.
682620	688720	If you like Cape shit, you're a fascist balconies and fascists, fascists and balconies because
688720	692580	Mussolini stood on a balcony and Trump also stood on a balcony.
692580	693580	That's the makes them a fascist.
693580	695740	If you got a picture of you out there staying on a balcony, you're a fascist.
695740	697500	I guess I'm never going on my balcony again.
697500	698500	Fuck.
698500	702780	I'm thinking about fascist American mass culture in video games in the mid two thousands.
702780	707140	There's so much shit to talk about and re-examine American devs had a larger market share than
707140	711600	ever before in the eighth generation's technical power led to the pinnacle of fascist mass
711600	712600	culture.
712600	717240	Call of duty, violent video games didn't make kids shoot up American schools, but it did
717240	719720	turn them into little fascist foot shoulders for the U S empire.
719720	723580	So they could shoot up Iraqi schools, call of duty, fascist gears of war, fascist, halo
723580	727320	fascist left for dead fascist, making a game about being a soldier and enjoyable experiences,
727320	730240	a fascist endeavor, sorry to ruin your fun.
730240	735120	So we've actually gone from any Sarkeesian levels of video games, cause sexism to whatever
735120	740320	the fuck this is video games cause fascism thinking no one should ever be bombed as an
740320	742360	inherently pro fascist position.
742360	743360	All right.
743360	748440	So, so even though fascists were notorious for wanting to expand, you know, wanting living
748440	751520	space, spazio vitali, the Italians called it.
751520	754700	If you're, if you're anti war, you're fascist.
754700	760360	The real fascists are the non interventionists guys, the roots of organic farming lie in
760360	761360	fascism.
761360	762360	Oh no.
762360	763360	You can't even be down to earth anymore.
763360	767200	You can't even eat the bugs and eat the soy meat and live in the pot without being a fascist
767200	768480	reminder.
768480	771440	Fascists use mocking humor to test and normalize ideas.
771440	773120	If you laugh, you're a fascist.
773120	774560	You don't get to be a centrist.
774560	777340	You don't get the comfort of taking a higher ground than the outright or right wing or
777340	778400	Nazi groups.
778400	781400	If you're a centrist, you're a fascist.
781400	783480	Astrology is a gateway to fascism.
783480	788240	All such mysticism that seeks to explain human behavior as inborn and predetermined rather
788240	791240	than as a result of material conditions is fascist.
791240	794760	It is not massaging to point this out, man, there's so much wrapped up in this.
794760	796960	If you like astrology, you're a fascist.
796960	799720	If you believe in anything spiritual, you're a fascist.
799720	802880	If you believe that humans have a nature, you're a fascist.
802880	805640	Hallmark movies are fascist propaganda.
805640	807120	Forget triumph of the will.
807120	811480	The most insidious authoritarian propaganda comes in the form of schmaltz.
811480	817160	So those really shitty, really boring Christmas movies where people just, they have good lives
817160	818160	and they're happy.
818160	819160	That's, that's fascism.
819160	820420	Can't, can't enjoy anything.
820420	821720	If you enjoy it, it's fascist.
821720	824100	Oh God, this time everybody's a fascist.
824100	829540	Matthew Wright accuses guest of sharing neo-Nazi ideas as they clash over vaccine passports.
829540	833220	One side says, the idea that you are still talking about herd immunity, which does not
833220	836900	exist without vaccinations, you are talking about essentially neo-Nazi ideas letting the
836900	838800	weak die only the strong will survive.
838800	840020	It's an absolute outrage.
840020	843820	The other side says, don't compare me to Nazis when we're being told we have to show our
843820	846900	papers if we're going to a restaurant, if you get a vaccine, it's fascist.
846900	848880	If you don't get a vaccine, it's fascist.
848880	852340	There is a huge problem with fascism amongst white trans women.
852580	856220	You know how hard it was to find a trans discord that wasn't filled with trans women who posted
856220	857220	Nazi imagery?
857220	860020	Don't, don't be trans guys or else you'll be a fash.
860020	864180	While many vets are being outed as far right extremists, one branch keeps pocking up when
864180	868080	it comes to neo-Nazis, the United States Marine Corps.
868080	871100	So the ones who fought the fascists are the fascists.
871100	872100	All right.
872100	878740	Swag, Sigma, troll, stay mad, y'all are welcoming fascist terms into our spaces, making, making
878740	881660	me feel unsafe even among friends and I deeply resent it.
881660	883660	Do you use modern lingo?
883660	885100	You might be a fascist.
885100	891140	US flags used in fascist rallies around the world, Hong Kong, Venezuela, Cuba, Croatia,
891140	897340	Japan, Poland, Germany, Belarus, Ukraine, Nicaragua, Taiwan, Tibet.
897340	901880	So all of these seem to be revolts against socialist or socialist leaning governments
901880	905360	and they're all using the American flag, the symbol of freedom worldwide.
905360	909580	So I guess wanting to be free from socialism is fascist.
909580	911300	Fascist seems to be the central word.
911300	917420	When progressives say far right or alt-right or neo-Nazi or Nazi or even conservative or
917420	920820	Republican, they're using all of it as a synonym for fascist.
920820	925140	The problem is fascism is actually an ideology with tenants and if you don't follow those
925140	926880	tenants, you can't be a fascist.
926880	928660	For example, this was floating around last year.
928660	929660	Is Trump a fascist?
929660	930860	Eight experts weigh in.
930860	935140	Call him a kleptocrat, an oligarch, a xenophobe, a racist, even an authoritarian, but he doesn't
935140	937000	quite fit the definition of a fascist.
937000	942260	That's because fascist, like communist, like liberal, like conservative, like libertarian
942260	945280	or monarchist, it actually has qualifiers.
945280	949840	You actually have to believe in the political theory of fascism to be a fascist.
949840	954860	But if everybody is a fascist, just like that one conversation earlier between the pro-vaxxer
954860	958640	and the anti-vaxxer, both of them calling each other neo-Nazis, surely we can just call
958640	959980	anyone a fascist now, right?
959980	963920	Like here, remember this from 2018, where Anna Sobery was chased around by Brexiteers
963920	965360	shouting traitor and Hitler.
965360	969260	Hold on, if Hitler's part of the far right, if Hitler is worshipped by the far right,
969260	975600	why would these far right yellow vesters be chasing after leftists whom they don't like
975600	977560	and calling them Hitler?
977560	981640	So if they're far right and they're calling her Hitler, but they should be, shouldn't
981640	982640	that be a compliment?
982640	983640	But it's clearly not.
983640	985040	Jesus, whatever.
985040	988280	Here's a left-leaning politician in the UK being called Hitler.
988280	992560	Well, after everything we've fucking seen in this video, surely that is acceptable,
992560	993560	right?
994200	996840	That's not all the police got involved because you can call literally everybody and everything
996840	1001640	a Nazi except for people on the left, which is why I do not trust these people's definition
1001640	1007440	of fascist or neo-Nazi or far right or alt right or conservative or any of this shit
1007440	1011420	because to them it clearly means people who I don't like.
1011420	1016500	When the UK decides to imprison people who view far right propaganda online, I do not
1016500	1020560	trust them to use that phrase far right in a fair way.
1020560	1026660	When people want to start banning far right parties from debates or even running for office,
1026660	1028980	I do not trust them at all.
1028980	1035440	When people want to sic the police specifically on the far right, I don't trust them.
1035440	1040520	And not because I'm some card-carrying rightist myself, it's because we have seen what these
1040520	1046840	people mean when they say right, when they say conservative, even when they say fascist.
1046840	1051820	Of course I haven't gotten into what fascism actually is, and that will be a video for
1051820	1052820	another time.
1052820	1057880	I do have quite a lot to say on the actual fascism and how and why we should oppose it
1057880	1058880	as liberals.
1058880	1061780	But I'll end this video by repeating the words of George Orwell.
1061780	1066460	It will be seen that, as used, the word fascism is almost entirely meaningless.
1066460	1069840	In conversation, of course, it is used even more wildly than in print.
1069840	1074940	I have heard it applied to farmers, shopkeepers, social credit, corporal punishment, fox hunting,
1074940	1081320	bull fighting, the 1922 committee, the 1941 committee, Kipling, Gandhi, Chiang Kai Shek,
1081320	1086960	homosexuality, priestly broadcasts, youth hostels, astrology, women, dogs, and I don't
1086960	1087960	know what else.
1087960	1091420	Yet underneath all this mess, there does lie a kind of buried meaning.
1091420	1095040	To begin with, it is clear that there are very great differences, some of them easy
1095040	1099320	to point out and not easy to explain away, between the regimes called fascist and those
1099320	1100320	called democratic.
1100320	1104980	Secondly, if fascist means in sympathy with Hitler, some of the accusations I have listed
1104980	1108300	above are obviously very much more justified than others.
1108300	1112820	Thirdly, even the people who recklessly fling the word fascist in every direction attach
1112820	1114940	at any rate an emotional significance to it.
1114940	1120580	By fascist, they mean, roughly speaking, something cruel, unscrupulous, arrogant, obscurantist,
1120580	1122620	anti-liberal, and anti-working class.
1122620	1127340	Except for the relatively small number of fascist sympathizers, almost any English person
1127340	1130240	would accept bully as a synonym for fascist.
1130240	1133660	That is about as near to a definition as this much abused word has come.
1133660	1138400	The answer to the question, what is a fascist seems to be, at least nowadays, whatever the
1138400	1141900	progressive that you're currently talking to personally doesn't like.
1160240	1187660	Thanks for watching.
