00:00.000 --> 00:09.800
Far right this, far right that, far right, far right, far right.

00:09.800 --> 00:15.600
You see everything being labeled as far right nowadays, but what actually is the far right?

00:15.600 --> 00:21.400
Now for the purposes of this video, I'm going to be using far right, alt right, Nazi, neo-Nazi,

00:21.400 --> 00:29.160
fascist, conservative, neo-con, Republican, racist, sexist, homophobic, transphobic, Islamophobic,

00:29.160 --> 00:31.280
etc., all as meaning the same thing.

00:31.280 --> 00:35.520
Not because they are the same thing, they are certainly not, but rather because progressives

00:35.520 --> 00:37.680
use them to mean the same thing.

00:37.680 --> 00:42.480
These are all actually very different things, but a large swath of the left considers all

00:42.480 --> 00:44.580
of these terms to be interchangeable.

00:44.580 --> 00:49.240
And it may be I'm just an old man, but that's rather ridiculous to see even now.

00:49.240 --> 00:52.580
Because it was once known to be one of the common rules of the internet, that if you

00:52.580 --> 00:57.080
have to appeal to Hitler or Nazis, you automatically lost the argument.

00:57.080 --> 01:00.960
The main reason being the Nazis are a joke, not because they weren't dangerous or evil

01:00.960 --> 01:06.080
in their day, they certainly were, but because they've been largely gone since 1945.

01:06.080 --> 01:09.640
So during those early days of the internet, generally you'd call somebody a Nazi if you

01:09.640 --> 01:13.780
were joking, or alternatively if you wanted to impugn them in an over-the-top way.

01:13.780 --> 01:18.140
Very rarely did anybody use the term Nazi to refer to people whom they thought actually

01:18.140 --> 01:22.600
believed in Nazi ideology, and whenever we met people who still actually believed in

01:22.600 --> 01:25.760
Nazi ideology, they were always laughed out of the room.

01:25.760 --> 01:29.240
But now everyone's a Nazi, everything is far right, it's become ridiculous.

01:29.240 --> 01:32.920
Here's a great example, these are the words of Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London.

01:32.920 --> 01:36.560
It's un-British to roll out the red carpet for Donald Trump, the US president gives comfort

01:36.560 --> 01:39.640
to the far right, the prime minister should speak truth to power.

01:39.640 --> 01:45.080
So what do you expect, do you expect the UK to snub the leader of their greatest ally

01:45.080 --> 01:46.080
for woke points?

01:46.080 --> 01:47.080
Like what the fuck are you talking about here?

01:47.080 --> 01:52.360
And of course he's talking about the very fine people on both sides comment that Trump

01:52.360 --> 01:56.440
gave during Charlottesville, which as far as I can tell was still the truth.

01:56.440 --> 02:00.480
Yes, there were bad actors at Charlottesville, there were absolutely real white supremacists

02:00.480 --> 02:04.360
at Charlottesville, but most people on the right were not that.

02:04.360 --> 02:10.000
You've got people like Nigel Farage being called fringe right-wing lunatics, and Nigel

02:10.000 --> 02:12.980
Farage is certainly on the right, but is he fringe?

02:12.980 --> 02:15.280
Is it fringe when the UK voted for Brexit?

02:15.280 --> 02:18.040
That's not a fringe belief, it seems to be quite normal.

02:18.040 --> 02:24.200
You've got Facebook banning Alex Jones, Mylionopolis, Louis Farrakhan, and other right-wing personalities.

02:24.200 --> 02:27.860
Hold the fuck on, because Louis Farrakhan isn't right-wing, he's on the left.

02:27.860 --> 02:31.280
The Tory membership is far-right, racist, and would cleanse Britain of minorities if

02:31.280 --> 02:32.280
they had the chance.

02:32.280 --> 02:34.080
Jesus Christ, dude.

02:34.080 --> 02:37.840
Do you actually think it's conservative soccer moms who want to go out there and build the

02:37.840 --> 02:39.680
next Auschwitz or something?

02:39.680 --> 02:43.440
White nationalists are now using clowns to spread hatred.

02:43.440 --> 02:45.120
Are clowns right-wing now?

02:45.120 --> 02:46.580
Are clowns fascist?

02:46.580 --> 02:50.900
The Cubs are investigating a fan's offensive hand gesture.

02:50.900 --> 02:51.900
Which one is that?

02:51.900 --> 02:52.900
I'm sure you already know.

02:52.900 --> 02:53.900
Look at this hatred.

02:53.900 --> 02:58.260
Look at this evil, vile, right-wing white supremacist as he makes that O shape with

02:58.260 --> 02:59.860
his finger and thumb.

02:59.860 --> 03:04.340
It summons up all of his white energy, which begins to charge in the empty space in the

03:04.340 --> 03:05.340
middle.

03:05.340 --> 03:10.520
Moments after this was taken, that poor black victim was blasted with direct, unfiltered

03:10.520 --> 03:11.820
white supremacy.

03:11.820 --> 03:14.820
Apparently Megan Murphy is going to be in an event with a number of alt-right figures

03:14.820 --> 03:20.340
such as Andy Ngo, Sargon of Akkad, Claire Layman, Tim Pool, Count Dankula, Lauren Chen.

03:20.340 --> 03:24.220
These individuals all have completely different ideologies.

03:24.220 --> 03:26.940
You cannot simply lump them all together as alt-right.

03:26.940 --> 03:32.140
There's a debate on Twitch right now featuring two big-time alt-righters, Sargon and Nick

03:32.140 --> 03:33.300
Fuentes.

03:33.300 --> 03:37.540
This is from 2019, and funnily enough, people now call Destiny who was on the left-wing

03:37.540 --> 03:39.820
side of that debate alt-right.

03:39.820 --> 03:44.260
The collusion between the military-industrial complex and video games industry is corruption.

03:44.260 --> 03:47.260
Gamergate, if it had any legitimacy, should have been slamming it.

03:47.260 --> 03:50.460
Sadly and predictably, Gamergate elevates the right-wing and Trump while supporting

03:50.460 --> 03:51.460
harassment.

03:51.460 --> 03:55.420
And being one of the biggest supporters of Gamergate, Carl Benjamin, aka Sargon of Akkad,

03:55.420 --> 04:00.200
is dead silent given he's a right-wing hack, xenophobic nationalist, and Trump supporter

04:00.200 --> 04:02.300
who loves joyless first-person shooters.

04:02.300 --> 04:05.500
Now hold on, there's quite a lot of joy to be had in a good first-person shooter.

04:05.500 --> 04:08.780
Things the right-wing gamer and anime audience is okay with.

04:08.780 --> 04:13.420
Not-safe-for-work content that endangers or violates women, children, and the LGBT community.

04:13.420 --> 04:15.860
Things the right-wing gamer and anime audience isn't okay with.

04:15.860 --> 04:20.260
Safe-for-work content that empowers or supports women, children, and the LGBT community.

04:20.260 --> 04:21.260
The fuck does this even mean?

04:21.260 --> 04:23.540
Like, are you complaining that there's boobs in video games?

04:23.540 --> 04:27.060
Are you complaining that porn exists, that hentai exists on the internet?

04:27.060 --> 04:31.020
If I see an anime girl get fucked in a video, how does that violate women?

04:31.020 --> 04:33.900
I guess enjoying porn or liking titties is right-wing now.

04:33.900 --> 04:36.640
This is regarding the cancelling of Ricky Gervais back in 2020.

04:36.640 --> 04:40.800
The idea that celebrities are not only pampered babies, but hypocrites who cause the problems

04:40.800 --> 04:45.400
they make speeches deploring and should therefore shut up and act or sing or be grateful is

04:45.400 --> 04:46.560
a right-wing talking point.

04:46.560 --> 04:50.920
Okay, so if you don't like celebrities, if you think they're out of touch, it's right-wing.

04:50.920 --> 04:52.560
It's a right-wing talking point.

04:52.560 --> 04:57.600
The far-right are uniting around their right to free speech, aka spreading a load of racist

04:57.600 --> 04:58.600
bullshit.

04:58.600 --> 05:00.560
Free speech is far-right.

05:00.560 --> 05:03.120
The Gilroy shooter was a far-right supremacist.

05:03.120 --> 05:07.240
CNN recklessly speculates the Dayton shooter may have been politically motivated.

05:07.240 --> 05:11.720
The shooter's tweets or politics have zero relevancy so far because he killed indiscriminately.

05:11.720 --> 05:14.440
Yeah, that guy was a left-winger.

05:14.440 --> 05:18.040
Inside the mind of Ben Shapiro, the alt-right sage without the rage.

05:18.040 --> 05:19.160
Ben is just a regular conservative.

05:19.160 --> 05:22.400
You're not going to find much white supremacy in The Jewish Man.

05:22.400 --> 05:27.760
Race science guru Sam Harris, that's quite the title, just deleted his Patreon earlier

05:27.760 --> 05:28.760
today.

05:28.760 --> 05:31.400
Dave Reuben and Jordan Peterson claim they're also leaving the platform and are in talks

05:31.400 --> 05:36.160
with investors about building a Patreon for free speech lovers, aka a white nationalist

05:36.160 --> 05:37.760
crowdfunding platform.

05:37.760 --> 05:41.600
Free speech lovers are white nationalists now, using a Patreon alternative as white

05:41.600 --> 05:42.600
nationalists.

05:42.600 --> 05:44.120
Fucking incredible.

05:44.120 --> 05:48.440
Racist and white supremacist ideas have become more visible among the Chinese-Canadian right.

05:48.440 --> 05:50.720
If they're Chinese, they can't be white supremacists, you know that, right?

05:50.720 --> 05:52.400
I mean, they can be Chinese supremacists.

05:52.400 --> 05:55.640
I guess they can be white supremacists if they're idiots and they actually believe in

05:55.640 --> 05:57.660
the inferiority of their own race.

05:57.660 --> 06:00.520
White supremacy is gateway to the American mind.

06:00.520 --> 06:04.620
Amazon's self-publishing arm gives extremists and neo-Nazis banned from other platforms

06:04.620 --> 06:07.180
unprecedented access to a mass audience.

06:07.180 --> 06:13.600
If you self-publish on Amazon, you are a white supremacist neo-Nazi extremist.

06:13.600 --> 06:18.780
Far-right extremists use GameStop chaos to radicalize and recruit on Telegram.

06:18.780 --> 06:22.640
If you buy GameStop stocks, you're far right, guys.

06:22.640 --> 06:25.760
There is a serious problem where Nazis are indoctrinating the hell out of our entire

06:25.760 --> 06:29.680
generation of children through things like Minecraft videos on YouTube.

06:29.680 --> 06:33.260
If we don't do something about it, we'll have a bunch of fascist teens in a few years.

06:33.260 --> 06:36.620
Turns out that when a whole generation of parents completely abdicate their basic moral

06:36.620 --> 06:40.700
duties and let their children watch PewDiePie instead of Big Bird, they grow up thinking

06:40.700 --> 06:44.380
it's their duty to send death threats to queer people and anyone making wholesome art

06:44.380 --> 06:45.460
and entertainment.

06:45.460 --> 06:50.140
This literally just sounds like you being an angry, aging Karen, not understanding that

06:50.140 --> 06:54.180
you're no longer young and cool and the kids are doing something else nowadays.

06:54.180 --> 06:56.180
But no, I guess if you like PewDiePie, you're a Nazi.

06:56.180 --> 06:59.780
By subscribing to PewDiePie, you're supporting somebody who has repeatedly given exposure

06:59.780 --> 07:02.660
to a crypto-fascist and Nazi propagandist.

07:02.660 --> 07:07.380
This is in reference to Ben Shapiro once hosting Meme Review on PewDiePie's channel.

07:07.380 --> 07:11.020
Jonathan Pye taking selfies with UKIP and Tommy Robinson supporters.

07:11.020 --> 07:12.340
They treat him like a hero.

07:12.340 --> 07:14.740
If you like Jonathan Pye, I guess you're part of the far right.

07:14.740 --> 07:16.860
I'm going to give you a bunch of headlines real quick.

07:16.860 --> 07:17.900
Which ones are the fake ones?

07:17.900 --> 07:20.300
Some Trump supporters are co-opting the American flag.

07:20.300 --> 07:21.860
Nazis once did that too.

07:21.860 --> 07:24.780
Inside the alt-right's bizarre obsession with hydration.

07:24.780 --> 07:28.700
Although research debunks white supremacists' claims about the benefits of hydration, like

07:28.700 --> 07:31.980
the myth that it improves your complexion, water drinking has been a staple trope of

07:31.980 --> 07:35.140
American racists since the days of segregated drinking fountains.

07:35.140 --> 07:38.060
The extreme right has a new hobby and it's terrifying.

07:38.060 --> 07:42.140
Hate groups are getting into books and are even encouraging others to read too.

07:42.140 --> 07:45.100
Laughter, the new symbol of the far right.

07:45.100 --> 07:47.300
Dear men, stop working out.

07:47.300 --> 07:50.340
Physical fitness creates a cycle of toxic masculinity that must be eradicated.

07:50.340 --> 07:52.380
It's kind of hard to tell, isn't it?

07:52.380 --> 07:55.400
The fake ones were the water one and the reading one.

07:55.400 --> 07:56.740
The rest of them were all real.

07:56.740 --> 08:01.420
Remember, opposing abortion makes you proponent, unwilling or not, of the far right.

08:01.420 --> 08:05.780
The patriarchal control of women's autonomy, the degradation of bodily autonomy, pseudo-scientific

08:05.780 --> 08:13.460
ideas about life, erasure of LGBTQ people via cisnormative gender ideas and pregnancy.

08:13.460 --> 08:18.100
You know, if you're LGBTQ, you're probably not really that at risk of getting pregnant,

08:18.100 --> 08:19.100
I would guess.

08:19.100 --> 08:20.420
There's no compromise or leeway.

08:20.420 --> 08:24.060
If you're going to go around bad-mouthing abortion, spreading blatantly false and incorrect

08:24.060 --> 08:29.660
information, actively campaign for the removal of human rights, you are contributing to fascism.

08:29.660 --> 08:33.580
It's just in general worth remembering that if fascists controlled the terms of debate,

08:33.580 --> 08:34.580
they would shoot you.

08:34.580 --> 08:36.900
If they debate you, it's because they think this is helpful in getting to a point where

08:36.900 --> 08:37.900
they can shoot you.

08:37.900 --> 08:41.260
So if you like debate, if you want to debate something, you're a fascist.

08:41.260 --> 08:45.700
On thinner bodies, the strawberry TikTok dress skews a tiny bit fascist.

08:45.700 --> 08:50.940
So if you're not a complete fat shit and you wear a trad dress, you're a fascist.

08:50.940 --> 08:52.720
A fascist exercise today?

08:52.720 --> 08:53.720
Did you?

08:53.720 --> 08:57.740
Fuck no, because regimented exercise is actually fundamentally fascist itself.

08:57.740 --> 08:59.580
Do you lift weights?

08:59.580 --> 09:00.580
Do you jog?

09:00.580 --> 09:01.580
Do you do yoga?

09:01.580 --> 09:02.580
Do you do any of that shit?

09:02.580 --> 09:03.580
Do you take care of yourself?

09:03.580 --> 09:04.780
Do you live a healthy life?

09:04.780 --> 09:06.300
You're a fascist.

09:06.300 --> 09:11.980
When somebody accuses me for being a transphobic racist and a sexist for liking and being an

09:11.980 --> 09:17.500
Asian trap, using footage of a white nationalist to prove you're not racist, sexist or transphobic.

09:17.500 --> 09:18.500
John's Persian.

09:18.500 --> 09:19.500
He's not white.

09:19.500 --> 09:21.580
He's from the Middle East.

09:21.580 --> 09:25.340
88 and HH phrases like honk honk.

09:25.340 --> 09:26.340
They're fascist.

09:26.340 --> 09:27.340
They mean Heil Hitler.

09:27.340 --> 09:30.580
HH is the eighth letter of the alphabet, thus 88.

09:30.580 --> 09:36.780
Honk honk is associated with the Honkler and is often used ironically by alt-right trolls.

09:36.780 --> 09:41.620
Socialists on social media are a perpetual motion machine of clown world takes about

09:41.620 --> 09:42.620
clown world.

09:42.620 --> 09:45.220
Guys, we're like 50 layers of honk deep right now.

09:45.220 --> 09:46.220
Oh, hey, Lilith.

09:46.220 --> 09:47.220
You're in here too.

09:47.220 --> 09:51.520
2016 punch Nazis, 2019 punch people who like PewDiePie.

09:51.520 --> 09:56.220
Today marks the European day of remembrance for victims of Stalinism and Nazism.

09:57.220 --> 09:59.260
You mean Nazi war criminals.

09:59.260 --> 10:02.780
You want us to remember Nazi war criminals along with Nazi victims.

10:02.780 --> 10:07.900
So if you were killed by Stalin, if you were put in the gulags, if you were killed by the

10:07.900 --> 10:13.380
socialist authoritarian regimes of the 20th century, you're a Nazi TikTok, which is mega

10:13.380 --> 10:18.740
popular with children and teens, has a problem with blatant violent white supremacy and Nazism.

10:18.740 --> 10:20.420
If you use TikTok, you're a Nazi.

10:20.420 --> 10:24.580
We'll introduce you to a trad wife, a young woman who has chosen to be a traditional wife,

10:24.580 --> 10:27.580
staying at home to take care of household chores while her husband works.

10:27.580 --> 10:31.340
And she is fine with submitting to her husband as he makes the key decisions in their lives.

10:31.340 --> 10:32.740
Who needs YouTube rabbit holes?

10:32.740 --> 10:37.300
And you have the BBC broadcasting literal white supremacist propaganda.

10:37.300 --> 10:41.420
So if you're, if you're a woman who wants to live in a more traditional manner, if you

10:41.420 --> 10:44.460
want to stay at home and take care of the house and take care of the kids, you're a

10:44.460 --> 10:49.420
white supremacist, even though lots of non-white women do this, it doesn't matter.

10:49.420 --> 10:50.420
Drive me a car.

10:50.420 --> 10:51.980
You are a Nazi.

10:51.980 --> 10:52.980
Vroom, vroom.

10:52.980 --> 10:56.380
My little pony fans are ready to admit they have a Nazi problem.

10:56.380 --> 10:57.380
What's going on?

10:57.380 --> 10:59.740
Are they rounding up all the earth ponies and putting them in camps or something?

10:59.740 --> 11:05.540
The claim Trump's campaign shirts feature the Imperial Eagle, a Nazi symbol, are ruling

11:05.540 --> 11:06.540
true.

11:06.540 --> 11:08.940
Are you, are you fucking kidding me?

11:08.940 --> 11:15.960
Eagles, the national bird of the United States is a Nazi bird now is the Snyder cut fascist.

11:15.960 --> 11:19.200
That's the discourse of the day, which is hilariously the wrong question.

11:19.200 --> 11:22.620
The right question is what fucking superhero movie isn't.

11:22.620 --> 11:28.720
If you like Cape shit, you're a fascist balconies and fascists, fascists and balconies because

11:28.720 --> 11:32.580
Mussolini stood on a balcony and Trump also stood on a balcony.

11:32.580 --> 11:33.580
That's the makes them a fascist.

11:33.580 --> 11:35.740
If you got a picture of you out there staying on a balcony, you're a fascist.

11:35.740 --> 11:37.500
I guess I'm never going on my balcony again.

11:37.500 --> 11:38.500
Fuck.

11:38.500 --> 11:42.780
I'm thinking about fascist American mass culture in video games in the mid two thousands.

11:42.780 --> 11:47.140
There's so much shit to talk about and re-examine American devs had a larger market share than

11:47.140 --> 11:51.600
ever before in the eighth generation's technical power led to the pinnacle of fascist mass

11:51.600 --> 11:52.600
culture.

11:52.600 --> 11:57.240
Call of duty, violent video games didn't make kids shoot up American schools, but it did

11:57.240 --> 11:59.720
turn them into little fascist foot shoulders for the U S empire.

11:59.720 --> 12:03.580
So they could shoot up Iraqi schools, call of duty, fascist gears of war, fascist, halo

12:03.580 --> 12:07.320
fascist left for dead fascist, making a game about being a soldier and enjoyable experiences,

12:07.320 --> 12:10.240
a fascist endeavor, sorry to ruin your fun.

12:10.240 --> 12:15.120
So we've actually gone from any Sarkeesian levels of video games, cause sexism to whatever

12:15.120 --> 12:20.320
the fuck this is video games cause fascism thinking no one should ever be bombed as an

12:20.320 --> 12:22.360
inherently pro fascist position.

12:22.360 --> 12:23.360
All right.

12:23.360 --> 12:28.440
So, so even though fascists were notorious for wanting to expand, you know, wanting living

12:28.440 --> 12:31.520
space, spazio vitali, the Italians called it.

12:31.520 --> 12:34.700
If you're, if you're anti war, you're fascist.

12:34.700 --> 12:40.360
The real fascists are the non interventionists guys, the roots of organic farming lie in

12:40.360 --> 12:41.360
fascism.

12:41.360 --> 12:42.360
Oh no.

12:42.360 --> 12:43.360
You can't even be down to earth anymore.

12:43.360 --> 12:47.200
You can't even eat the bugs and eat the soy meat and live in the pot without being a fascist

12:47.200 --> 12:48.480
reminder.

12:48.480 --> 12:51.440
Fascists use mocking humor to test and normalize ideas.

12:51.440 --> 12:53.120
If you laugh, you're a fascist.

12:53.120 --> 12:54.560
You don't get to be a centrist.

12:54.560 --> 12:57.340
You don't get the comfort of taking a higher ground than the outright or right wing or

12:57.340 --> 12:58.400
Nazi groups.

12:58.400 --> 13:01.400
If you're a centrist, you're a fascist.

13:01.400 --> 13:03.480
Astrology is a gateway to fascism.

13:03.480 --> 13:08.240
All such mysticism that seeks to explain human behavior as inborn and predetermined rather

13:08.240 --> 13:11.240
than as a result of material conditions is fascist.

13:11.240 --> 13:14.760
It is not massaging to point this out, man, there's so much wrapped up in this.

13:14.760 --> 13:16.960
If you like astrology, you're a fascist.

13:16.960 --> 13:19.720
If you believe in anything spiritual, you're a fascist.

13:19.720 --> 13:22.880
If you believe that humans have a nature, you're a fascist.

13:22.880 --> 13:25.640
Hallmark movies are fascist propaganda.

13:25.640 --> 13:27.120
Forget triumph of the will.

13:27.120 --> 13:31.480
The most insidious authoritarian propaganda comes in the form of schmaltz.

13:31.480 --> 13:37.160
So those really shitty, really boring Christmas movies where people just, they have good lives

13:37.160 --> 13:38.160
and they're happy.

13:38.160 --> 13:39.160
That's, that's fascism.

13:39.160 --> 13:40.420
Can't, can't enjoy anything.

13:40.420 --> 13:41.720
If you enjoy it, it's fascist.

13:41.720 --> 13:44.100
Oh God, this time everybody's a fascist.

13:44.100 --> 13:49.540
Matthew Wright accuses guest of sharing neo-Nazi ideas as they clash over vaccine passports.

13:49.540 --> 13:53.220
One side says, the idea that you are still talking about herd immunity, which does not

13:53.220 --> 13:56.900
exist without vaccinations, you are talking about essentially neo-Nazi ideas letting the

13:56.900 --> 13:58.800
weak die only the strong will survive.

13:58.800 --> 14:00.020
It's an absolute outrage.

14:00.020 --> 14:03.820
The other side says, don't compare me to Nazis when we're being told we have to show our

14:03.820 --> 14:06.900
papers if we're going to a restaurant, if you get a vaccine, it's fascist.

14:06.900 --> 14:08.880
If you don't get a vaccine, it's fascist.

14:08.880 --> 14:12.340
There is a huge problem with fascism amongst white trans women.

14:12.580 --> 14:16.220
You know how hard it was to find a trans discord that wasn't filled with trans women who posted

14:16.220 --> 14:17.220
Nazi imagery?

14:17.220 --> 14:20.020
Don't, don't be trans guys or else you'll be a fash.

14:20.020 --> 14:24.180
While many vets are being outed as far right extremists, one branch keeps pocking up when

14:24.180 --> 14:28.080
it comes to neo-Nazis, the United States Marine Corps.

14:28.080 --> 14:31.100
So the ones who fought the fascists are the fascists.

14:31.100 --> 14:32.100
All right.

14:32.100 --> 14:38.740
Swag, Sigma, troll, stay mad, y'all are welcoming fascist terms into our spaces, making, making

14:38.740 --> 14:41.660
me feel unsafe even among friends and I deeply resent it.

14:41.660 --> 14:43.660
Do you use modern lingo?

14:43.660 --> 14:45.100
You might be a fascist.

14:45.100 --> 14:51.140
US flags used in fascist rallies around the world, Hong Kong, Venezuela, Cuba, Croatia,

14:51.140 --> 14:57.340
Japan, Poland, Germany, Belarus, Ukraine, Nicaragua, Taiwan, Tibet.

14:57.340 --> 15:01.880
So all of these seem to be revolts against socialist or socialist leaning governments

15:01.880 --> 15:05.360
and they're all using the American flag, the symbol of freedom worldwide.

15:05.360 --> 15:09.580
So I guess wanting to be free from socialism is fascist.

15:09.580 --> 15:11.300
Fascist seems to be the central word.

15:11.300 --> 15:17.420
When progressives say far right or alt-right or neo-Nazi or Nazi or even conservative or

15:17.420 --> 15:20.820
Republican, they're using all of it as a synonym for fascist.

15:20.820 --> 15:25.140
The problem is fascism is actually an ideology with tenants and if you don't follow those

15:25.140 --> 15:26.880
tenants, you can't be a fascist.

15:26.880 --> 15:28.660
For example, this was floating around last year.

15:28.660 --> 15:29.660
Is Trump a fascist?

15:29.660 --> 15:30.860
Eight experts weigh in.

15:30.860 --> 15:35.140
Call him a kleptocrat, an oligarch, a xenophobe, a racist, even an authoritarian, but he doesn't

15:35.140 --> 15:37.000
quite fit the definition of a fascist.

15:37.000 --> 15:42.260
That's because fascist, like communist, like liberal, like conservative, like libertarian

15:42.260 --> 15:45.280
or monarchist, it actually has qualifiers.

15:45.280 --> 15:49.840
You actually have to believe in the political theory of fascism to be a fascist.

15:49.840 --> 15:54.860
But if everybody is a fascist, just like that one conversation earlier between the pro-vaxxer

15:54.860 --> 15:58.640
and the anti-vaxxer, both of them calling each other neo-Nazis, surely we can just call

15:58.640 --> 15:59.980
anyone a fascist now, right?

15:59.980 --> 16:03.920
Like here, remember this from 2018, where Anna Sobery was chased around by Brexiteers

16:03.920 --> 16:05.360
shouting traitor and Hitler.

16:05.360 --> 16:09.260
Hold on, if Hitler's part of the far right, if Hitler is worshipped by the far right,

16:09.260 --> 16:15.600
why would these far right yellow vesters be chasing after leftists whom they don't like

16:15.600 --> 16:17.560
and calling them Hitler?

16:17.560 --> 16:21.640
So if they're far right and they're calling her Hitler, but they should be, shouldn't

16:21.640 --> 16:22.640
that be a compliment?

16:22.640 --> 16:23.640
But it's clearly not.

16:23.640 --> 16:25.040
Jesus, whatever.

16:25.040 --> 16:28.280
Here's a left-leaning politician in the UK being called Hitler.

16:28.280 --> 16:32.560
Well, after everything we've fucking seen in this video, surely that is acceptable,

16:32.560 --> 16:33.560
right?

16:34.200 --> 16:36.840
That's not all the police got involved because you can call literally everybody and everything

16:36.840 --> 16:41.640
a Nazi except for people on the left, which is why I do not trust these people's definition

16:41.640 --> 16:47.440
of fascist or neo-Nazi or far right or alt right or conservative or any of this shit

16:47.440 --> 16:51.420
because to them it clearly means people who I don't like.

16:51.420 --> 16:56.500
When the UK decides to imprison people who view far right propaganda online, I do not

16:56.500 --> 17:00.560
trust them to use that phrase far right in a fair way.

17:00.560 --> 17:06.660
When people want to start banning far right parties from debates or even running for office,

17:06.660 --> 17:08.980
I do not trust them at all.

17:08.980 --> 17:15.440
When people want to sic the police specifically on the far right, I don't trust them.

17:15.440 --> 17:20.520
And not because I'm some card-carrying rightist myself, it's because we have seen what these

17:20.520 --> 17:26.840
people mean when they say right, when they say conservative, even when they say fascist.

17:26.840 --> 17:31.820
Of course I haven't gotten into what fascism actually is, and that will be a video for

17:31.820 --> 17:32.820
another time.

17:32.820 --> 17:37.880
I do have quite a lot to say on the actual fascism and how and why we should oppose it

17:37.880 --> 17:38.880
as liberals.

17:38.880 --> 17:41.780
But I'll end this video by repeating the words of George Orwell.

17:41.780 --> 17:46.460
It will be seen that, as used, the word fascism is almost entirely meaningless.

17:46.460 --> 17:49.840
In conversation, of course, it is used even more wildly than in print.

17:49.840 --> 17:54.940
I have heard it applied to farmers, shopkeepers, social credit, corporal punishment, fox hunting,

17:54.940 --> 18:01.320
bull fighting, the 1922 committee, the 1941 committee, Kipling, Gandhi, Chiang Kai Shek,

18:01.320 --> 18:06.960
homosexuality, priestly broadcasts, youth hostels, astrology, women, dogs, and I don't

18:06.960 --> 18:07.960
know what else.

18:07.960 --> 18:11.420
Yet underneath all this mess, there does lie a kind of buried meaning.

18:11.420 --> 18:15.040
To begin with, it is clear that there are very great differences, some of them easy

18:15.040 --> 18:19.320
to point out and not easy to explain away, between the regimes called fascist and those

18:19.320 --> 18:20.320
called democratic.

18:20.320 --> 18:24.980
Secondly, if fascist means in sympathy with Hitler, some of the accusations I have listed

18:24.980 --> 18:28.300
above are obviously very much more justified than others.

18:28.300 --> 18:32.820
Thirdly, even the people who recklessly fling the word fascist in every direction attach

18:32.820 --> 18:34.940
at any rate an emotional significance to it.

18:34.940 --> 18:40.580
By fascist, they mean, roughly speaking, something cruel, unscrupulous, arrogant, obscurantist,

18:40.580 --> 18:42.620
anti-liberal, and anti-working class.

18:42.620 --> 18:47.340
Except for the relatively small number of fascist sympathizers, almost any English person

18:47.340 --> 18:50.240
would accept bully as a synonym for fascist.

18:50.240 --> 18:53.660
That is about as near to a definition as this much abused word has come.

18:53.660 --> 18:58.400
The answer to the question, what is a fascist seems to be, at least nowadays, whatever the

18:58.400 --> 19:01.900
progressive that you're currently talking to personally doesn't like.

19:20.240 --> 19:47.660
Thanks for watching.
