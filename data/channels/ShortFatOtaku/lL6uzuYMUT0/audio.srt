1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,800
Far right this, far right that, far right, far right, far right.

2
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:15,600
You see everything being labeled as far right nowadays, but what actually is the far right?

3
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:21,400
Now for the purposes of this video, I'm going to be using far right, alt right, Nazi, neo-Nazi,

4
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:29,160
fascist, conservative, neo-con, Republican, racist, sexist, homophobic, transphobic, Islamophobic,

5
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:31,280
etc., all as meaning the same thing.

6
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:35,520
Not because they are the same thing, they are certainly not, but rather because progressives

7
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,680
use them to mean the same thing.

8
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:42,480
These are all actually very different things, but a large swath of the left considers all

9
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:44,580
of these terms to be interchangeable.

10
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:49,240
And it may be I'm just an old man, but that's rather ridiculous to see even now.

11
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:52,580
Because it was once known to be one of the common rules of the internet, that if you

12
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:57,080
have to appeal to Hitler or Nazis, you automatically lost the argument.

13
00:00:57,080 --> 00:01:00,960
The main reason being the Nazis are a joke, not because they weren't dangerous or evil

14
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:06,080
in their day, they certainly were, but because they've been largely gone since 1945.

15
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:09,640
So during those early days of the internet, generally you'd call somebody a Nazi if you

16
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:13,780
were joking, or alternatively if you wanted to impugn them in an over-the-top way.

17
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:18,140
Very rarely did anybody use the term Nazi to refer to people whom they thought actually

18
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:22,600
believed in Nazi ideology, and whenever we met people who still actually believed in

19
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:25,760
Nazi ideology, they were always laughed out of the room.

20
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:29,240
But now everyone's a Nazi, everything is far right, it's become ridiculous.

21
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:32,920
Here's a great example, these are the words of Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London.

22
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:36,560
It's un-British to roll out the red carpet for Donald Trump, the US president gives comfort

23
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:39,640
to the far right, the prime minister should speak truth to power.

24
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:45,080
So what do you expect, do you expect the UK to snub the leader of their greatest ally

25
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:46,080
for woke points?

26
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:47,080
Like what the fuck are you talking about here?

27
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:52,360
And of course he's talking about the very fine people on both sides comment that Trump

28
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:56,440
gave during Charlottesville, which as far as I can tell was still the truth.

29
00:01:56,440 --> 00:02:00,480
Yes, there were bad actors at Charlottesville, there were absolutely real white supremacists

30
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:04,360
at Charlottesville, but most people on the right were not that.

31
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:10,000
You've got people like Nigel Farage being called fringe right-wing lunatics, and Nigel

32
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,980
Farage is certainly on the right, but is he fringe?

33
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:15,280
Is it fringe when the UK voted for Brexit?

34
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:18,040
That's not a fringe belief, it seems to be quite normal.

35
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:24,200
You've got Facebook banning Alex Jones, Mylionopolis, Louis Farrakhan, and other right-wing personalities.

36
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:27,860
Hold the fuck on, because Louis Farrakhan isn't right-wing, he's on the left.

37
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:31,280
The Tory membership is far-right, racist, and would cleanse Britain of minorities if

38
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,280
they had the chance.

39
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:34,080
Jesus Christ, dude.

40
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:37,840
Do you actually think it's conservative soccer moms who want to go out there and build the

41
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,680
next Auschwitz or something?

42
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:43,440
White nationalists are now using clowns to spread hatred.

43
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,120
Are clowns right-wing now?

44
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,580
Are clowns fascist?

45
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:50,900
The Cubs are investigating a fan's offensive hand gesture.

46
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:51,900
Which one is that?

47
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:52,900
I'm sure you already know.

48
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:53,900
Look at this hatred.

49
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:58,260
Look at this evil, vile, right-wing white supremacist as he makes that O shape with

50
00:02:58,260 --> 00:02:59,860
his finger and thumb.

51
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:04,340
It summons up all of his white energy, which begins to charge in the empty space in the

52
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:05,340
middle.

53
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:10,520
Moments after this was taken, that poor black victim was blasted with direct, unfiltered

54
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:11,820
white supremacy.

55
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:14,820
Apparently Megan Murphy is going to be in an event with a number of alt-right figures

56
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:20,340
such as Andy Ngo, Sargon of Akkad, Claire Layman, Tim Pool, Count Dankula, Lauren Chen.

57
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:24,220
These individuals all have completely different ideologies.

58
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:26,940
You cannot simply lump them all together as alt-right.

59
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:32,140
There's a debate on Twitch right now featuring two big-time alt-righters, Sargon and Nick

60
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:33,300
Fuentes.

61
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:37,540
This is from 2019, and funnily enough, people now call Destiny who was on the left-wing

62
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:39,820
side of that debate alt-right.

63
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:44,260
The collusion between the military-industrial complex and video games industry is corruption.

64
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:47,260
Gamergate, if it had any legitimacy, should have been slamming it.

65
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:50,460
Sadly and predictably, Gamergate elevates the right-wing and Trump while supporting

66
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:51,460
harassment.

67
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:55,420
And being one of the biggest supporters of Gamergate, Carl Benjamin, aka Sargon of Akkad,

68
00:03:55,420 --> 00:04:00,200
is dead silent given he's a right-wing hack, xenophobic nationalist, and Trump supporter

69
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:02,300
who loves joyless first-person shooters.

70
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:05,500
Now hold on, there's quite a lot of joy to be had in a good first-person shooter.

71
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:08,780
Things the right-wing gamer and anime audience is okay with.

72
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:13,420
Not-safe-for-work content that endangers or violates women, children, and the LGBT community.

73
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:15,860
Things the right-wing gamer and anime audience isn't okay with.

74
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:20,260
Safe-for-work content that empowers or supports women, children, and the LGBT community.

75
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:21,260
The fuck does this even mean?

76
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:23,540
Like, are you complaining that there's boobs in video games?

77
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:27,060
Are you complaining that porn exists, that hentai exists on the internet?

78
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:31,020
If I see an anime girl get fucked in a video, how does that violate women?

79
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:33,900
I guess enjoying porn or liking titties is right-wing now.

80
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:36,640
This is regarding the cancelling of Ricky Gervais back in 2020.

81
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:40,800
The idea that celebrities are not only pampered babies, but hypocrites who cause the problems

82
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:45,400
they make speeches deploring and should therefore shut up and act or sing or be grateful is

83
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:46,560
a right-wing talking point.

84
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:50,920
Okay, so if you don't like celebrities, if you think they're out of touch, it's right-wing.

85
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:52,560
It's a right-wing talking point.

86
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:57,600
The far-right are uniting around their right to free speech, aka spreading a load of racist

87
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,600
bullshit.

88
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,560
Free speech is far-right.

89
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:03,120
The Gilroy shooter was a far-right supremacist.

90
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:07,240
CNN recklessly speculates the Dayton shooter may have been politically motivated.

91
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:11,720
The shooter's tweets or politics have zero relevancy so far because he killed indiscriminately.

92
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:14,440
Yeah, that guy was a left-winger.

93
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:18,040
Inside the mind of Ben Shapiro, the alt-right sage without the rage.

94
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:19,160
Ben is just a regular conservative.

95
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:22,400
You're not going to find much white supremacy in The Jewish Man.

96
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:27,760
Race science guru Sam Harris, that's quite the title, just deleted his Patreon earlier

97
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:28,760
today.

98
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:31,400
Dave Reuben and Jordan Peterson claim they're also leaving the platform and are in talks

99
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:36,160
with investors about building a Patreon for free speech lovers, aka a white nationalist

100
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,760
crowdfunding platform.

101
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:41,600
Free speech lovers are white nationalists now, using a Patreon alternative as white

102
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,600
nationalists.

103
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,120
Fucking incredible.

104
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:48,440
Racist and white supremacist ideas have become more visible among the Chinese-Canadian right.

105
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:50,720
If they're Chinese, they can't be white supremacists, you know that, right?

106
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,400
I mean, they can be Chinese supremacists.

107
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:55,640
I guess they can be white supremacists if they're idiots and they actually believe in

108
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:57,660
the inferiority of their own race.

109
00:05:57,660 --> 00:06:00,520
White supremacy is gateway to the American mind.

110
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:04,620
Amazon's self-publishing arm gives extremists and neo-Nazis banned from other platforms

111
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:07,180
unprecedented access to a mass audience.

112
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:13,600
If you self-publish on Amazon, you are a white supremacist neo-Nazi extremist.

113
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:18,780
Far-right extremists use GameStop chaos to radicalize and recruit on Telegram.

114
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:22,640
If you buy GameStop stocks, you're far right, guys.

115
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:25,760
There is a serious problem where Nazis are indoctrinating the hell out of our entire

116
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:29,680
generation of children through things like Minecraft videos on YouTube.

117
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:33,260
If we don't do something about it, we'll have a bunch of fascist teens in a few years.

118
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:36,620
Turns out that when a whole generation of parents completely abdicate their basic moral

119
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:40,700
duties and let their children watch PewDiePie instead of Big Bird, they grow up thinking

120
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:44,380
it's their duty to send death threats to queer people and anyone making wholesome art

121
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:45,460
and entertainment.

122
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:50,140
This literally just sounds like you being an angry, aging Karen, not understanding that

123
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:54,180
you're no longer young and cool and the kids are doing something else nowadays.

124
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:56,180
But no, I guess if you like PewDiePie, you're a Nazi.

125
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:59,780
By subscribing to PewDiePie, you're supporting somebody who has repeatedly given exposure

126
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:02,660
to a crypto-fascist and Nazi propagandist.

127
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:07,380
This is in reference to Ben Shapiro once hosting Meme Review on PewDiePie's channel.

128
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:11,020
Jonathan Pye taking selfies with UKIP and Tommy Robinson supporters.

129
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:12,340
They treat him like a hero.

130
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:14,740
If you like Jonathan Pye, I guess you're part of the far right.

131
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:16,860
I'm going to give you a bunch of headlines real quick.

132
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:17,900
Which ones are the fake ones?

133
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:20,300
Some Trump supporters are co-opting the American flag.

134
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:21,860
Nazis once did that too.

135
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:24,780
Inside the alt-right's bizarre obsession with hydration.

136
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:28,700
Although research debunks white supremacists' claims about the benefits of hydration, like

137
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:31,980
the myth that it improves your complexion, water drinking has been a staple trope of

138
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:35,140
American racists since the days of segregated drinking fountains.

139
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:38,060
The extreme right has a new hobby and it's terrifying.

140
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:42,140
Hate groups are getting into books and are even encouraging others to read too.

141
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:45,100
Laughter, the new symbol of the far right.

142
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:47,300
Dear men, stop working out.

143
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:50,340
Physical fitness creates a cycle of toxic masculinity that must be eradicated.

144
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:52,380
It's kind of hard to tell, isn't it?

145
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:55,400
The fake ones were the water one and the reading one.

146
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:56,740
The rest of them were all real.

147
00:07:56,740 --> 00:08:01,420
Remember, opposing abortion makes you proponent, unwilling or not, of the far right.

148
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:05,780
The patriarchal control of women's autonomy, the degradation of bodily autonomy, pseudo-scientific

149
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:13,460
ideas about life, erasure of LGBTQ people via cisnormative gender ideas and pregnancy.

150
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:18,100
You know, if you're LGBTQ, you're probably not really that at risk of getting pregnant,

151
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:19,100
I would guess.

152
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:20,420
There's no compromise or leeway.

153
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:24,060
If you're going to go around bad-mouthing abortion, spreading blatantly false and incorrect

154
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:29,660
information, actively campaign for the removal of human rights, you are contributing to fascism.

155
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:33,580
It's just in general worth remembering that if fascists controlled the terms of debate,

156
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:34,580
they would shoot you.

157
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:36,900
If they debate you, it's because they think this is helpful in getting to a point where

158
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:37,900
they can shoot you.

159
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:41,260
So if you like debate, if you want to debate something, you're a fascist.

160
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:45,700
On thinner bodies, the strawberry TikTok dress skews a tiny bit fascist.

161
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:50,940
So if you're not a complete fat shit and you wear a trad dress, you're a fascist.

162
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:52,720
A fascist exercise today?

163
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:53,720
Did you?

164
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:57,740
Fuck no, because regimented exercise is actually fundamentally fascist itself.

165
00:08:57,740 --> 00:08:59,580
Do you lift weights?

166
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:00,580
Do you jog?

167
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:01,580
Do you do yoga?

168
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:02,580
Do you do any of that shit?

169
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:03,580
Do you take care of yourself?

170
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:04,780
Do you live a healthy life?

171
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:06,300
You're a fascist.

172
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:11,980
When somebody accuses me for being a transphobic racist and a sexist for liking and being an

173
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:17,500
Asian trap, using footage of a white nationalist to prove you're not racist, sexist or transphobic.

174
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:18,500
John's Persian.

175
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:19,500
He's not white.

176
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:21,580
He's from the Middle East.

177
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:25,340
88 and HH phrases like honk honk.

178
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:26,340
They're fascist.

179
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:27,340
They mean Heil Hitler.

180
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:30,580
HH is the eighth letter of the alphabet, thus 88.

181
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:36,780
Honk honk is associated with the Honkler and is often used ironically by alt-right trolls.

182
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:41,620
Socialists on social media are a perpetual motion machine of clown world takes about

183
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:42,620
clown world.

184
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:45,220
Guys, we're like 50 layers of honk deep right now.

185
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:46,220
Oh, hey, Lilith.

186
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:47,220
You're in here too.

187
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:51,520
2016 punch Nazis, 2019 punch people who like PewDiePie.

188
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:56,220
Today marks the European day of remembrance for victims of Stalinism and Nazism.

189
00:09:57,220 --> 00:09:59,260
You mean Nazi war criminals.

190
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:02,780
You want us to remember Nazi war criminals along with Nazi victims.

191
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:07,900
So if you were killed by Stalin, if you were put in the gulags, if you were killed by the

192
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:13,380
socialist authoritarian regimes of the 20th century, you're a Nazi TikTok, which is mega

193
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:18,740
popular with children and teens, has a problem with blatant violent white supremacy and Nazism.

194
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:20,420
If you use TikTok, you're a Nazi.

195
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:24,580
We'll introduce you to a trad wife, a young woman who has chosen to be a traditional wife,

196
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:27,580
staying at home to take care of household chores while her husband works.

197
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:31,340
And she is fine with submitting to her husband as he makes the key decisions in their lives.

198
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:32,740
Who needs YouTube rabbit holes?

199
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:37,300
And you have the BBC broadcasting literal white supremacist propaganda.

200
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:41,420
So if you're, if you're a woman who wants to live in a more traditional manner, if you

201
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:44,460
want to stay at home and take care of the house and take care of the kids, you're a

202
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:49,420
white supremacist, even though lots of non-white women do this, it doesn't matter.

203
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:50,420
Drive me a car.

204
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:51,980
You are a Nazi.

205
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:52,980
Vroom, vroom.

206
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:56,380
My little pony fans are ready to admit they have a Nazi problem.

207
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:57,380
What's going on?

208
00:10:57,380 --> 00:10:59,740
Are they rounding up all the earth ponies and putting them in camps or something?

209
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:05,540
The claim Trump's campaign shirts feature the Imperial Eagle, a Nazi symbol, are ruling

210
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:06,540
true.

211
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:08,940
Are you, are you fucking kidding me?

212
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:15,960
Eagles, the national bird of the United States is a Nazi bird now is the Snyder cut fascist.

213
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:19,200
That's the discourse of the day, which is hilariously the wrong question.

214
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:22,620
The right question is what fucking superhero movie isn't.

215
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:28,720
If you like Cape shit, you're a fascist balconies and fascists, fascists and balconies because

216
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:32,580
Mussolini stood on a balcony and Trump also stood on a balcony.

217
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:33,580
That's the makes them a fascist.

218
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:35,740
If you got a picture of you out there staying on a balcony, you're a fascist.

219
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:37,500
I guess I'm never going on my balcony again.

220
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:38,500
Fuck.

221
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:42,780
I'm thinking about fascist American mass culture in video games in the mid two thousands.

222
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:47,140
There's so much shit to talk about and re-examine American devs had a larger market share than

223
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:51,600
ever before in the eighth generation's technical power led to the pinnacle of fascist mass

224
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,600
culture.

225
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:57,240
Call of duty, violent video games didn't make kids shoot up American schools, but it did

226
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:59,720
turn them into little fascist foot shoulders for the U S empire.

227
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:03,580
So they could shoot up Iraqi schools, call of duty, fascist gears of war, fascist, halo

228
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:07,320
fascist left for dead fascist, making a game about being a soldier and enjoyable experiences,

229
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:10,240
a fascist endeavor, sorry to ruin your fun.

230
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:15,120
So we've actually gone from any Sarkeesian levels of video games, cause sexism to whatever

231
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:20,320
the fuck this is video games cause fascism thinking no one should ever be bombed as an

232
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,360
inherently pro fascist position.

233
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:23,360
All right.

234
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:28,440
So, so even though fascists were notorious for wanting to expand, you know, wanting living

235
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:31,520
space, spazio vitali, the Italians called it.

236
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:34,700
If you're, if you're anti war, you're fascist.

237
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:40,360
The real fascists are the non interventionists guys, the roots of organic farming lie in

238
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:41,360
fascism.

239
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,360
Oh no.

240
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:43,360
You can't even be down to earth anymore.

241
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:47,200
You can't even eat the bugs and eat the soy meat and live in the pot without being a fascist

242
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,480
reminder.

243
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:51,440
Fascists use mocking humor to test and normalize ideas.

244
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,120
If you laugh, you're a fascist.

245
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,560
You don't get to be a centrist.

246
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:57,340
You don't get the comfort of taking a higher ground than the outright or right wing or

247
00:12:57,340 --> 00:12:58,400
Nazi groups.

248
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:01,400
If you're a centrist, you're a fascist.

249
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:03,480
Astrology is a gateway to fascism.

250
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:08,240
All such mysticism that seeks to explain human behavior as inborn and predetermined rather

251
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:11,240
than as a result of material conditions is fascist.

252
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:14,760
It is not massaging to point this out, man, there's so much wrapped up in this.

253
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:16,960
If you like astrology, you're a fascist.

254
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:19,720
If you believe in anything spiritual, you're a fascist.

255
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:22,880
If you believe that humans have a nature, you're a fascist.

256
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:25,640
Hallmark movies are fascist propaganda.

257
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:27,120
Forget triumph of the will.

258
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:31,480
The most insidious authoritarian propaganda comes in the form of schmaltz.

259
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:37,160
So those really shitty, really boring Christmas movies where people just, they have good lives

260
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:38,160
and they're happy.

261
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:39,160
That's, that's fascism.

262
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:40,420
Can't, can't enjoy anything.

263
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:41,720
If you enjoy it, it's fascist.

264
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:44,100
Oh God, this time everybody's a fascist.

265
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:49,540
Matthew Wright accuses guest of sharing neo-Nazi ideas as they clash over vaccine passports.

266
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:53,220
One side says, the idea that you are still talking about herd immunity, which does not

267
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:56,900
exist without vaccinations, you are talking about essentially neo-Nazi ideas letting the

268
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:58,800
weak die only the strong will survive.

269
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,020
It's an absolute outrage.

270
00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:03,820
The other side says, don't compare me to Nazis when we're being told we have to show our

271
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:06,900
papers if we're going to a restaurant, if you get a vaccine, it's fascist.

272
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:08,880
If you don't get a vaccine, it's fascist.

273
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:12,340
There is a huge problem with fascism amongst white trans women.

274
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:16,220
You know how hard it was to find a trans discord that wasn't filled with trans women who posted

275
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:17,220
Nazi imagery?

276
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:20,020
Don't, don't be trans guys or else you'll be a fash.

277
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:24,180
While many vets are being outed as far right extremists, one branch keeps pocking up when

278
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:28,080
it comes to neo-Nazis, the United States Marine Corps.

279
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:31,100
So the ones who fought the fascists are the fascists.

280
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:32,100
All right.

281
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:38,740
Swag, Sigma, troll, stay mad, y'all are welcoming fascist terms into our spaces, making, making

282
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:41,660
me feel unsafe even among friends and I deeply resent it.

283
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:43,660
Do you use modern lingo?

284
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:45,100
You might be a fascist.

285
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:51,140
US flags used in fascist rallies around the world, Hong Kong, Venezuela, Cuba, Croatia,

286
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:57,340
Japan, Poland, Germany, Belarus, Ukraine, Nicaragua, Taiwan, Tibet.

287
00:14:57,340 --> 00:15:01,880
So all of these seem to be revolts against socialist or socialist leaning governments

288
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:05,360
and they're all using the American flag, the symbol of freedom worldwide.

289
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:09,580
So I guess wanting to be free from socialism is fascist.

290
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:11,300
Fascist seems to be the central word.

291
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:17,420
When progressives say far right or alt-right or neo-Nazi or Nazi or even conservative or

292
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:20,820
Republican, they're using all of it as a synonym for fascist.

293
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:25,140
The problem is fascism is actually an ideology with tenants and if you don't follow those

294
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:26,880
tenants, you can't be a fascist.

295
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:28,660
For example, this was floating around last year.

296
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:29,660
Is Trump a fascist?

297
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:30,860
Eight experts weigh in.

298
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:35,140
Call him a kleptocrat, an oligarch, a xenophobe, a racist, even an authoritarian, but he doesn't

299
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:37,000
quite fit the definition of a fascist.

300
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:42,260
That's because fascist, like communist, like liberal, like conservative, like libertarian

301
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:45,280
or monarchist, it actually has qualifiers.

302
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:49,840
You actually have to believe in the political theory of fascism to be a fascist.

303
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:54,860
But if everybody is a fascist, just like that one conversation earlier between the pro-vaxxer

304
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:58,640
and the anti-vaxxer, both of them calling each other neo-Nazis, surely we can just call

305
00:15:58,640 --> 00:15:59,980
anyone a fascist now, right?

306
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:03,920
Like here, remember this from 2018, where Anna Sobery was chased around by Brexiteers

307
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:05,360
shouting traitor and Hitler.

308
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:09,260
Hold on, if Hitler's part of the far right, if Hitler is worshipped by the far right,

309
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:15,600
why would these far right yellow vesters be chasing after leftists whom they don't like

310
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,560
and calling them Hitler?

311
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:21,640
So if they're far right and they're calling her Hitler, but they should be, shouldn't

312
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:22,640
that be a compliment?

313
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:23,640
But it's clearly not.

314
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:25,040
Jesus, whatever.

315
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:28,280
Here's a left-leaning politician in the UK being called Hitler.

316
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:32,560
Well, after everything we've fucking seen in this video, surely that is acceptable,

317
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:33,560
right?

318
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:36,840
That's not all the police got involved because you can call literally everybody and everything

319
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:41,640
a Nazi except for people on the left, which is why I do not trust these people's definition

320
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:47,440
of fascist or neo-Nazi or far right or alt right or conservative or any of this shit

321
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:51,420
because to them it clearly means people who I don't like.

322
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:56,500
When the UK decides to imprison people who view far right propaganda online, I do not

323
00:16:56,500 --> 00:17:00,560
trust them to use that phrase far right in a fair way.

324
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:06,660
When people want to start banning far right parties from debates or even running for office,

325
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:08,980
I do not trust them at all.

326
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:15,440
When people want to sic the police specifically on the far right, I don't trust them.

327
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:20,520
And not because I'm some card-carrying rightist myself, it's because we have seen what these

328
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:26,840
people mean when they say right, when they say conservative, even when they say fascist.

329
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:31,820
Of course I haven't gotten into what fascism actually is, and that will be a video for

330
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:32,820
another time.

331
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:37,880
I do have quite a lot to say on the actual fascism and how and why we should oppose it

332
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:38,880
as liberals.

333
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:41,780
But I'll end this video by repeating the words of George Orwell.

334
00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:46,460
It will be seen that, as used, the word fascism is almost entirely meaningless.

335
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:49,840
In conversation, of course, it is used even more wildly than in print.

336
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:54,940
I have heard it applied to farmers, shopkeepers, social credit, corporal punishment, fox hunting,

337
00:17:54,940 --> 00:18:01,320
bull fighting, the 1922 committee, the 1941 committee, Kipling, Gandhi, Chiang Kai Shek,

338
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:06,960
homosexuality, priestly broadcasts, youth hostels, astrology, women, dogs, and I don't

339
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:07,960
know what else.

340
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:11,420
Yet underneath all this mess, there does lie a kind of buried meaning.

341
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:15,040
To begin with, it is clear that there are very great differences, some of them easy

342
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:19,320
to point out and not easy to explain away, between the regimes called fascist and those

343
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:20,320
called democratic.

344
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:24,980
Secondly, if fascist means in sympathy with Hitler, some of the accusations I have listed

345
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:28,300
above are obviously very much more justified than others.

346
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:32,820
Thirdly, even the people who recklessly fling the word fascist in every direction attach

347
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:34,940
at any rate an emotional significance to it.

348
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:40,580
By fascist, they mean, roughly speaking, something cruel, unscrupulous, arrogant, obscurantist,

349
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:42,620
anti-liberal, and anti-working class.

350
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:47,340
Except for the relatively small number of fascist sympathizers, almost any English person

351
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:50,240
would accept bully as a synonym for fascist.

352
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:53,660
That is about as near to a definition as this much abused word has come.

353
00:18:53,660 --> 00:18:58,400
The answer to the question, what is a fascist seems to be, at least nowadays, whatever the

354
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:01,900
progressive that you're currently talking to personally doesn't like.

355
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:47,660
Thanks for watching.
