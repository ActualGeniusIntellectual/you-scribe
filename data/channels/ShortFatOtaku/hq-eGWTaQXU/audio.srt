00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,080
Okay, this is going to be a little bit weird.

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:03,080
Check this out.

3
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:06,880
Alright, today is March 17th, this package was delivered from Newegg.

4
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:09,180
March 17th, there's everything right there.

5
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:13,300
It is an Xbox 360 connect extension cable.

6
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:14,820
Nothing too crazy, right?

7
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:17,100
Take a look at what I received.

8
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:20,760
This is the package that came in here, it's just a, it looks like it would hold a cable,

9
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:21,760
right?

10
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:23,560
But this is what was inside of it.

11
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:32,740
I haven't even opened these yet, but like, they're like cloths with a code on them, and

12
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:37,120
it's like a person's family photo.

13
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,560
No clue who that is.

14
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:43,260
Let me show you this one.

15
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:47,720
Just no idea.

16
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:48,720
What the fuck?

17
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:51,620
Okay, I'm going to open these and try to take a look at them.

18
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:54,060
Is my cable inside of it?

19
00:00:54,060 --> 00:01:01,780
No, I got, what is that, a pencil?

20
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:02,780
What is this?

21
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:07,860
And there's beads.

22
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:09,020
What the fuck is this?

23
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:10,020
Come on.

24
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:12,860
It's going to be the same thing, isn't it?

25
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:16,300
Just a bunch of weird beads and shit.

26
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:19,420
Yep, same thing came out.

27
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:23,200
It's definitely for me, there's my name.

28
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,460
So what the fuck is this?
