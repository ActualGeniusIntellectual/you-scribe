00:00.000 --> 00:02.080
Okay, this is going to be a little bit weird.

00:02.080 --> 00:03.080
Check this out.

00:03.080 --> 00:06.880
Alright, today is March 17th, this package was delivered from Newegg.

00:06.880 --> 00:09.180
March 17th, there's everything right there.

00:09.180 --> 00:13.300
It is an Xbox 360 connect extension cable.

00:13.300 --> 00:14.820
Nothing too crazy, right?

00:14.820 --> 00:17.100
Take a look at what I received.

00:17.100 --> 00:20.760
This is the package that came in here, it's just a, it looks like it would hold a cable,

00:20.760 --> 00:21.760
right?

00:21.760 --> 00:23.560
But this is what was inside of it.

00:23.560 --> 00:32.740
I haven't even opened these yet, but like, they're like cloths with a code on them, and

00:32.740 --> 00:37.120
it's like a person's family photo.

00:37.120 --> 00:38.560
No clue who that is.

00:38.560 --> 00:43.260
Let me show you this one.

00:43.260 --> 00:47.720
Just no idea.

00:47.720 --> 00:48.720
What the fuck?

00:48.720 --> 00:51.620
Okay, I'm going to open these and try to take a look at them.

00:51.620 --> 00:54.060
Is my cable inside of it?

00:54.060 --> 01:01.780
No, I got, what is that, a pencil?

01:01.780 --> 01:02.780
What is this?

01:02.780 --> 01:07.860
And there's beads.

01:07.860 --> 01:09.020
What the fuck is this?

01:09.020 --> 01:10.020
Come on.

01:10.020 --> 01:12.860
It's going to be the same thing, isn't it?

01:12.860 --> 01:16.300
Just a bunch of weird beads and shit.

01:16.300 --> 01:19.420
Yep, same thing came out.

01:19.420 --> 01:23.200
It's definitely for me, there's my name.

01:23.200 --> 01:25.460
So what the fuck is this?
