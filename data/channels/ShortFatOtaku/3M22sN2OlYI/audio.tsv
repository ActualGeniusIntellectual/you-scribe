0	2120	Welcome to SJ Weekly, guys.
2120	3840	I'm sick again.
3840	7760	This is the third time since June I've gotten sick.
7760	11160	I have a feeling that maybe my roommate is a disease
11160	14520	vector into the house because he's sick every week.
14520	17040	Today, I'm having a cough drop.
17040	17760	Listen to this.
23760	25120	Fuck yeah.
25120	27280	It's a recolor.
27280	29000	Let's get into it.
29000	31680	A teacher gave my son a detention
31680	33880	for saying he'd vote UKIP.
33880	36160	OK.
36160	38360	Nick Ferrari was shocked when this caller
38360	41520	said his teenage son was given a detention at school
41520	44800	after telling a teacher he'd vote for UKIP.
44800	45680	Is there a video here?
45680	47160	Let's play the video.
47160	48000	All is in Loughton.
48000	49240	Paul, what happened to your son?
49240	50880	He got into trouble, is that right?
50880	51360	Good morning.
51360	52080	Yeah, there was a few of them.
52080	53760	It was during the last general election,
53760	57160	and I was having a debate in his class about who you'd vote for.
57240	59960	And one boy said he'd vote for UKIP,
59960	63440	and the teacher said that all UKIP voters are racist.
63440	66240	So my boy, Dennis, said, well, I'll vote for UKIP,
66240	67880	and I'm not racist.
67880	70480	They're about controlling it, whatever.
70480	73600	And he was given detention, the three boys that said it.
73600	75880	And when he came home and told me, I didn't believe him.
75880	77640	I said, let me ring the school.
77640	80680	And the head of the year said, went and talked about it
80680	83280	to the teacher, came back, and he couldn't apologize enough.
83280	86840	He said it's, you know, she got angry because they said
87000	88560	vote for UKIP.
88560	89680	A teacher gave you?
89680	91240	How old is your boy?
91240	92560	He was 15 at the time.
92560	93440	Oh, my god.
93440	96080	So they're on the verge of becoming young men.
96080	98120	They're a couple of years off from voting.
98120	99960	They're having a conversation about the general election.
99960	101240	One boy says I'd vote UKIP.
101240	103200	Your son, your teacher goes nuts and says they're racist.
103200	105320	Your son, and they get detentions.
105320	106280	They got detentions.
106280	107920	They didn't have to have detentions.
107920	109480	The head of the year really apologized,
109480	111600	said the teacher, if she's going to have a debate,
111600	115120	she's got to be able to take over people's opinions.
115120	117000	So when you challenge the school,
117000	119320	the school took detentions away and apologized.
119320	121680	Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, completely.
121680	123800	He really apologized the head of the year.
123800	126040	You can't have a conversation about a general election
126040	128440	then when somebody wants to vote for one of the main parties.
128440	131680	Well, one of the parties is, right, you've got a detention.
131680	132960	That's absurd.
132960	134080	Well, I couldn't believe it.
134080	135640	At the time, I thought there's no way
135640	136920	he's got a detention for that.
136920	139680	But I said I'll ring the school and find out.
139680	140760	Go on, then, Dad, ring him.
140760	141680	Go on, Dad, ring him.
141680	144920	Ring him, it's true, Dad.
144920	146360	Nice story, Paul.
146360	148120	But did the teacher say she?
148120	149640	Did you say it was a she, the teacher?
149640	151440	It was a she, the teacher, yeah, yeah.
151440	152920	It was his form teacher, yeah.
152920	155360	I think she had to apologize to the boys and.
155360	156320	Right, good.
156320	158320	Well, I'm glad the school took the appropriate action.
158320	160600	I'm not saying, by the way, that you should all vote UK.
160600	162320	Say whatever you like, as long as it's not
162320	164040	a banned organization.
164040	164720	Paul, thank you.
164720	165600	Fascinating story.
165600	166080	We.
166080	167720	Holy shit.
167720	169480	OK, well, there we go.
169480	171200	Wow.
171200	172200	I can't fucking believe it.
172200	173000	I mean, it's the UK.
173000	174560	I guess I can believe that.
174600	175720	Let's see what the article says.
175720	177880	One boy said he'd vote for UKIP, and the teacher
177880	181440	said that all UKIP voters are racist.
181440	183240	Imagine actually thinking that.
183240	188400	Imagine actually believing that wanting immigration control
188400	190600	or wanting to leave the EU is racist.
190600	193000	What kind of mental pretzel do you
193000	197360	have to bend yourself into to get into that type of headspace?
197360	199880	It follows reports that a teenager quit her college
199880	203760	course because her tutor warned her she was too right wing
203760	206400	over her support for Tommy Robinson.
206400	208880	Alyssa Cook-Gray, 17, claims a teacher told her,
208880	211360	get out, we don't want people with your views
211360	212720	during a political debate.
212720	215480	Well, guess what, I have that article right here.
215480	218240	Teacher quits college course on first day,
218240	221560	or sorry, teenager quits college course on first day
221560	224600	after being given final warning for declaring her support
224600	226160	for Tommy Robinson.
226160	228760	So not only are you too right wing for this grade school
228760	231640	here, you're too right wing for a college course,
231640	235840	apparently, if you just believe in center right positions that
235840	238320	aren't actually all that unreasonable.
238320	240720	Teenager Alyssa Cook-Gray says she
240720	243200	was given a final warning by her college
243200	246400	because she told classmates her favorite person was
246400	248000	Tommy Robinson.
248000	250000	The 17-year-old was attending the first day
250000	253120	of her art and employability course at Total People
253120	256040	when a political debate erupted among students.
256040	258720	Alyssa says her classmates were openly expressing their support
258720	261240	for labor leader Jeremy Corbyn when
261240	264760	she told them she identified more with right wing ideologies.
264760	266680	When asked who she admired, Alyssa responded
266680	269240	she liked right wing activist Tommy Robinson, who
269240	271360	is best known for forming the English Defense League
271360	275560	and as a vocal opponent of Islam and its followers.
275560	278680	I don't know if this article is presenting this
278680	283840	as if it's a critique of him, because that's actually not
283840	287120	necessarily a bad thing, if you know anything about Islam.
290400	293160	She now feels terrified to return to her course,
293160	294960	has taken the decision it wasn't for her,
294960	297000	quitting after so over an hour of lessons.
297000	301400	Was she kicked out, although she was given, she was kicked out.
301400	303280	Alyssa said, I was given a final warning
303280	304520	for being too right wing.
304520	307000	It was the first day we were all having a conversation where
307000	308040	Jeremy Corbyn came up.
308040	310000	I asked people not to get in it because it was
310000	311640	filled with a room of lefties.
311640	313600	I said my opinion and the teacher said, get out.
313600	315920	We don't want people with your views.
315920	318200	I was given a final warning for being too right wing.
318200	320000	The class then started asking everyone
320000	322800	who their favorite person was, and I said Tommy Robinson.
322800	324440	I like what he's doing for our country,
324440	325400	and I follow all the stories.
325400	326400	I think he's a savior.
326400	329160	Stoke on Trent Live approached Total People for comment,
329160	332960	but the organization is yet to respond to our requests.
332960	334840	However, a spokesperson for Total People
334840	339040	told the Mirror Online, we are an inclusive organization.
339040	342040	We are values led, and we ask that all learners
342040	344120	are collaborative, respect each other's views,
344120	346160	and work towards common goals.
346160	348600	We have successfully worked with learners over a 20 year
348600	350760	period from many different backgrounds, religions,
350760	353040	and diverse cultures, but apparently not
353040	355280	diverse political opinions.
355280	358520	And it would also seem like people are becoming too right
358520	360760	wing for money because there's this tweet
360760	364520	from the alternate social media platform Gab.
364520	368240	They say, next it will be banks cutting us off and others.
368240	369200	You think we're joking.
369200	371480	We predicted payment processors would.
371480	373640	We predicted hosting providers would.
373640	376000	We proved DNS providers do.
376000	378200	This whole thing started with something
378200	382000	that I mentioned in my anti-social media video
382000	385920	with Cloudflare kicking off the Daily Stormer arbitrarily
385920	386760	for no reason.
386760	387880	They just did it.
387880	390040	And then that started the cascade,
390040	393560	which culminated recently in Alex Jones being completely
393560	396000	blown off the internet in its entirety.
396000	399280	What they're referring to specifically is this.
399280	403720	Stripe freezes Gab's account for not safe for work content,
403720	407760	shining a light on a problematic policy.
407760	411720	Social network Gab, a haven for toxic alt-right personalities
411720	414400	banned from more mainstream platforms,
414400	417600	has had its Stripe account frozen due to adult content
417600	419320	on the platform.
419320	421760	But even if you cheer Gab's problem, Stripe is no hero.
421760	422840	Well, here's the problem.
422840	427320	Doesn't Stripe provide credit card processing services
427320	429480	for Patreon?
429480	431920	And there's a lot of porn on Patreon.
431920	436840	Doesn't Stripe provide credit card processing services
436840	440520	for many places that have not safe for work content?
440520	443280	Why are they singling out Gab?
443280	446800	I don't think the problem here is not safe for work content.
446800	449160	I think the problem here is free speech content,
449160	451680	because Gab doesn't censor, period.
451680	454400	Stripe, according to Gab, told the social network
454400	456240	that it must modify its terms of service
456240	459880	to indicate that adult or illegal content cannot be
459880	463160	streamed through Gab TV or otherwise distributed
463160	466440	through the Gab service, and to put in place reasonable
466440	470240	controls to ensure that no adult or illegal content is being
470240	473400	streamed through Gab TV or otherwise available on the Gab
473400	474640	service.
474640	476240	Gab claims that the service doesn't
476240	478440	allow illegal content on its site
478440	481080	and that all adult content is marked not safe for work.
481080	483200	We've had this content in a not safe for work setting
483200	487040	for two years now with no issues from them until now,
487040	489000	Gab wrote in a tweet on Wednesday.
489000	492880	It's no surprise to anyone that when the big social media
492880	495680	platform started banning political speech they didn't
495680	498800	like, and then those people that were banned
498800	501680	decided to take their ball and go home and basically build
501680	504800	their own sites, that the SJWs were going
504800	507080	to come after them financially.
507080	508840	And this part's actually quite interesting.
508840	510640	The spokesperson added, it's interesting
510640	513160	how we've never had any issues with either of these payment
513160	516080	processors over two years now, but all of a sudden when
516080	518320	gab.com is the only platform on the internet
518320	521960	to host Alex Jones and Infowars, we become the target.
521960	523480	Yeah, that is interesting, isn't it?
523480	525680	I wonder if Gab could get in contact with Pornhub
525680	528040	or some other kind of large porn site
528040	530560	and figure out how they handle their money,
530560	533000	like what payment processor they use.
533000	536000	It might be, it just might be the case
536000	538840	that alternative social media networks
538840	541960	are going to start after using porn services to stay alive,
541960	543640	because Silicon Valley absolutely
543640	545400	does not want them to thrive.
545400	548200	And speaking of SJW brainlets, I just
548200	551880	had to take a look at this article from Kotaku,
551880	554880	how the NPC meme, which paints people
554880	557840	as agency-free and incapable of critical thought,
557840	561800	tries to dehumanize SJWs.
561800	564000	And that's a, this is an excellent picture
564000	566560	they've decided to use.
566560	569920	Those of you who don't know, the NPC meme basically
569960	574280	means that, you know how you have that voice in your head
574280	576320	that tells you what to do when you're not speaking,
576320	577720	like you kind of think to yourself
577720	580040	in words in some language.
580040	582360	You have an imagination, you have the ability
582360	587160	to reasonably predict things before you do them.
587160	591200	The NPC meme implies that some people out there
591200	593840	don't have that, and they're just
593840	597320	like walking machines with no thought behind them.
597320	601880	And Aiden Powleton actually did a pretty good video on this.
601880	607360	Well, Kotaku, well, now that it's become a meme,
607360	613520	Kotaku is taking offense to it, because apparently SJWs
613520	616240	are considered NPCs now.
616240	617560	OK, let's read this.
617560	619240	From time to time, and especially
619240	620960	if you're a fan of science fiction,
620960	623040	you may have had the thought that nobody around you
623040	624840	is actually real.
624840	627560	That sentiment has taken root in anti-progressive parts
627560	630480	of the internet as a dehumanizing meme,
630480	633400	and it borrows some familiar gaming terminology.
633400	634920	Of course it does.
634920	636680	It's all gamers.
636680	639320	We did it all.
639320	641280	About a month ago, a meme along those lines
641280	643880	took root on 4chan and among anti-progressive online
643880	644840	communities.
644840	647760	It's called the NPC meme, and it goes like this.
647760	650600	Out there in the world, there are literal NPCs,
650600	653600	the term for non-playable characters in video games,
653600	656280	who have no internality whatsoever.
656280	658120	There are some giveaways, of course.
658120	661640	They spit out canned lines, like, good weather today, huh?
661640	665200	And flocked normie trends, are UGG boots still a thing?
665200	670080	And for the most part, share the same uncritical world view.
670080	674040	The classic melancholy meme, Wojak, a sad man cruelly drawn
674040	677320	in Microsoft Paint, has now received the NPC treatment
677320	678520	with NPC Wojak.
681520	683320	I didn't know this guy was called Wojak.
683320	685200	I just heard it was Feels Guy.
685200	689760	Part crackpot social theory and part elementary school insult,
689760	693200	the NPC meme originated from a deeply comical medley
693200	698080	of bogus physics and stupid religion found on 4chan.
698080	701280	Originally posted in 2016, it resurfaced last month.
701280	702680	I have a theory that there are only
702680	705440	a fixed quantity of souls on planet Earth
705440	708200	that cycle continuously through reincarnation.
708200	710880	However, since the human growth rate is so severe,
710920	714360	the soulless extra walking flesh piles around us
714360	717840	are NPCs, or the ultimate normal fags,
717840	720640	who autonomously follow group think and social trends
720640	722480	in order to appear convincingly human.
726480	728280	God.
728280	731720	Listen, I have a feeling that the only reason
731720	736320	that you find this insulting and dehumanizing
736320	739160	is because you probably have some of the traits
739160	742440	that they're describing.
742440	746800	I mean, there are a few normie things that I like, all right?
746800	751200	There are many non-normie things that I like,
751200	753760	but there's definitely some normie things that I like too.
753760	758040	And I don't feel insulted or dehumanized by the NPC meme.
758040	759840	I don't feel insulted or dehumanized
759840	764520	when someone calls me a fucking 32-year-old boomer, you know?
764520	767160	Essentially, some large portion of society, normies,
767200	769240	pop culture fanatics, and Trump haters,
769240	771880	who speak in cliches, are in fact NPCs
771880	774240	with no internality, agency,
774240	775880	or capacity for critical thought.
777240	779800	I mean, there seems to be some,
781160	784240	that does seem to be how you guys act, isn't it?
784240	787280	I mean, there are many good reasons to hate Trump.
787280	789840	There are many, many, many good reasons to hate Trump.
789840	793400	However, whenever I come across a bonafide Trump hater,
793400	796120	they never actually present one of them.
796120	797600	They just call him a racist,
797600	799120	like that's supposed to be something.
799120	801720	How to tell when someone is an NPC,
801720	804320	wrote anti-SJW alt-right journalist,

807640	810160	Update, Chiang returned a request for comment
810160	812560	to note that he does not consider himself to be alt-right.
812560	814120	Do you want to know why?
814120	817720	Because the alt-right are white identitarians,
817720	820480	and Ian Miles-Chiang is Asian.
820480	822760	You fucking morons.
822840	826360	Okay, this is how I know you're an NPC,
826360	829080	because you think an Asian man can be alt-right.
829080	832640	Yeah, this entire article is basically her shrieking
832640	834560	how she's not an NPC,
834560	836200	while simultaneously describing
836200	840080	all of the NPC characteristics as being part of herself,
840080	842080	and saying that that's completely fine.
842080	846040	It's, I'm sorry.
846040	849240	I'm sorry that you're not even the hero of your own story.
849240	851600	Cecilia De Anastasio.
851600	854520	Additionally, I know the content has again been sparse, guys.
854520	856000	I'm very sorry about that.
856000	858160	You will hear from me very soon, though,
859240	861360	outside of SJ Weeklys.
861360	862200	I love you guys.
862200	864100	Thank you for continuing to support me.
864100	865000	I'll see you soon.
