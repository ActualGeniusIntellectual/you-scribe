00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,120
Welcome to SJ Weekly, guys.

2
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:03,840
I'm sick again.

3
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:07,760
This is the third time since June I've gotten sick.

4
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:11,160
I have a feeling that maybe my roommate is a disease

5
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:14,520
vector into the house because he's sick every week.

6
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:17,040
Today, I'm having a cough drop.

7
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:17,760
Listen to this.

8
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,120
Fuck yeah.

9
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:27,280
It's a recolor.

10
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:29,000
Let's get into it.

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,680
A teacher gave my son a detention

12
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:33,880
for saying he'd vote UKIP.

13
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:36,160
OK.

14
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:38,360
Nick Ferrari was shocked when this caller

15
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:41,520
said his teenage son was given a detention at school

16
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,800
after telling a teacher he'd vote for UKIP.

17
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:45,680
Is there a video here?

18
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:47,160
Let's play the video.

19
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:48,000
All is in Loughton.

20
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,240
Paul, what happened to your son?

21
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:50,880
He got into trouble, is that right?

22
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:51,360
Good morning.

23
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:52,080
Yeah, there was a few of them.

24
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:53,760
It was during the last general election,

25
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:57,160
and I was having a debate in his class about who you'd vote for.

26
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:59,960
And one boy said he'd vote for UKIP,

27
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:03,440
and the teacher said that all UKIP voters are racist.

28
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:06,240
So my boy, Dennis, said, well, I'll vote for UKIP,

29
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:07,880
and I'm not racist.

30
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:10,480
They're about controlling it, whatever.

31
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:13,600
And he was given detention, the three boys that said it.

32
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,880
And when he came home and told me, I didn't believe him.

33
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:17,640
I said, let me ring the school.

34
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:20,680
And the head of the year said, went and talked about it

35
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:23,280
to the teacher, came back, and he couldn't apologize enough.

36
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:26,840
He said it's, you know, she got angry because they said

37
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,560
vote for UKIP.

38
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:29,680
A teacher gave you?

39
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,240
How old is your boy?

40
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:32,560
He was 15 at the time.

41
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:33,440
Oh, my god.

42
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:36,080
So they're on the verge of becoming young men.

43
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:38,120
They're a couple of years off from voting.

44
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:39,960
They're having a conversation about the general election.

45
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:41,240
One boy says I'd vote UKIP.

46
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:43,200
Your son, your teacher goes nuts and says they're racist.

47
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,320
Your son, and they get detentions.

48
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:46,280
They got detentions.

49
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:47,920
They didn't have to have detentions.

50
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,480
The head of the year really apologized,

51
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:51,600
said the teacher, if she's going to have a debate,

52
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:55,120
she's got to be able to take over people's opinions.

53
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:57,000
So when you challenge the school,

54
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,320
the school took detentions away and apologized.

55
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:01,680
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, completely.

56
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,800
He really apologized the head of the year.

57
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:06,040
You can't have a conversation about a general election

58
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:08,440
then when somebody wants to vote for one of the main parties.

59
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:11,680
Well, one of the parties is, right, you've got a detention.

60
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:12,960
That's absurd.

61
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,080
Well, I couldn't believe it.

62
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,640
At the time, I thought there's no way

63
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:16,920
he's got a detention for that.

64
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:19,680
But I said I'll ring the school and find out.

65
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:20,760
Go on, then, Dad, ring him.

66
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:21,680
Go on, Dad, ring him.

67
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:24,920
Ring him, it's true, Dad.

68
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:26,360
Nice story, Paul.

69
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:28,120
But did the teacher say she?

70
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,640
Did you say it was a she, the teacher?

71
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:31,440
It was a she, the teacher, yeah, yeah.

72
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:32,920
It was his form teacher, yeah.

73
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:35,360
I think she had to apologize to the boys and.

74
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,320
Right, good.

75
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:38,320
Well, I'm glad the school took the appropriate action.

76
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:40,600
I'm not saying, by the way, that you should all vote UK.

77
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:42,320
Say whatever you like, as long as it's not

78
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:44,040
a banned organization.

79
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:44,720
Paul, thank you.

80
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:45,600
Fascinating story.

81
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:46,080
We.

82
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,720
Holy shit.

83
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:49,480
OK, well, there we go.

84
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:51,200
Wow.

85
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,200
I can't fucking believe it.

86
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,000
I mean, it's the UK.

87
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,560
I guess I can believe that.

88
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:55,720
Let's see what the article says.

89
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:57,880
One boy said he'd vote for UKIP, and the teacher

90
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:01,440
said that all UKIP voters are racist.

91
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,240
Imagine actually thinking that.

92
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:08,400
Imagine actually believing that wanting immigration control

93
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,600
or wanting to leave the EU is racist.

94
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:13,000
What kind of mental pretzel do you

95
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,360
have to bend yourself into to get into that type of headspace?

96
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,880
It follows reports that a teenager quit her college

97
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:23,760
course because her tutor warned her she was too right wing

98
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:26,400
over her support for Tommy Robinson.

99
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,880
Alyssa Cook-Gray, 17, claims a teacher told her,

100
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:31,360
get out, we don't want people with your views

101
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,720
during a political debate.

102
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:35,480
Well, guess what, I have that article right here.

103
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:38,240
Teacher quits college course on first day,

104
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:41,560
or sorry, teenager quits college course on first day

105
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:44,600
after being given final warning for declaring her support

106
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,160
for Tommy Robinson.

107
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:48,760
So not only are you too right wing for this grade school

108
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:51,640
here, you're too right wing for a college course,

109
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:55,840
apparently, if you just believe in center right positions that

110
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,320
aren't actually all that unreasonable.

111
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:00,720
Teenager Alyssa Cook-Gray says she

112
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:03,200
was given a final warning by her college

113
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:06,400
because she told classmates her favorite person was

114
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,000
Tommy Robinson.

115
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
The 17-year-old was attending the first day

116
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,120
of her art and employability course at Total People

117
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:16,040
when a political debate erupted among students.

118
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:18,720
Alyssa says her classmates were openly expressing their support

119
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,240
for labor leader Jeremy Corbyn when

120
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:24,760
she told them she identified more with right wing ideologies.

121
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:26,680
When asked who she admired, Alyssa responded

122
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:29,240
she liked right wing activist Tommy Robinson, who

123
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:31,360
is best known for forming the English Defense League

124
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:35,560
and as a vocal opponent of Islam and its followers.

125
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:38,680
I don't know if this article is presenting this

126
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:43,840
as if it's a critique of him, because that's actually not

127
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:47,120
necessarily a bad thing, if you know anything about Islam.

128
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:53,160
She now feels terrified to return to her course,

129
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,960
has taken the decision it wasn't for her,

130
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:57,000
quitting after so over an hour of lessons.

131
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,400
Was she kicked out, although she was given, she was kicked out.

132
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:03,280
Alyssa said, I was given a final warning

133
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:04,520
for being too right wing.

134
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:07,000
It was the first day we were all having a conversation where

135
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,040
Jeremy Corbyn came up.

136
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:10,000
I asked people not to get in it because it was

137
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,640
filled with a room of lefties.

138
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:13,600
I said my opinion and the teacher said, get out.

139
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,920
We don't want people with your views.

140
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:18,200
I was given a final warning for being too right wing.

141
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:20,000
The class then started asking everyone

142
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,800
who their favorite person was, and I said Tommy Robinson.

143
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,440
I like what he's doing for our country,

144
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:25,400
and I follow all the stories.

145
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:26,400
I think he's a savior.

146
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:29,160
Stoke on Trent Live approached Total People for comment,

147
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:32,960
but the organization is yet to respond to our requests.

148
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:34,840
However, a spokesperson for Total People

149
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:39,040
told the Mirror Online, we are an inclusive organization.

150
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:42,040
We are values led, and we ask that all learners

151
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:44,120
are collaborative, respect each other's views,

152
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:46,160
and work towards common goals.

153
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,600
We have successfully worked with learners over a 20 year

154
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,760
period from many different backgrounds, religions,

155
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:53,040
and diverse cultures, but apparently not

156
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:55,280
diverse political opinions.

157
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:58,520
And it would also seem like people are becoming too right

158
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:00,760
wing for money because there's this tweet

159
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:04,520
from the alternate social media platform Gab.

160
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:08,240
They say, next it will be banks cutting us off and others.

161
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,200
You think we're joking.

162
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:11,480
We predicted payment processors would.

163
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:13,640
We predicted hosting providers would.

164
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:16,000
We proved DNS providers do.

165
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,200
This whole thing started with something

166
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:22,000
that I mentioned in my anti-social media video

167
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,920
with Cloudflare kicking off the Daily Stormer arbitrarily

168
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:26,760
for no reason.

169
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:27,880
They just did it.

170
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:30,040
And then that started the cascade,

171
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:33,560
which culminated recently in Alex Jones being completely

172
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:36,000
blown off the internet in its entirety.

173
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,280
What they're referring to specifically is this.

174
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:43,720
Stripe freezes Gab's account for not safe for work content,

175
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:47,760
shining a light on a problematic policy.

176
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:51,720
Social network Gab, a haven for toxic alt-right personalities

177
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:54,400
banned from more mainstream platforms,

178
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:57,600
has had its Stripe account frozen due to adult content

179
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,320
on the platform.

180
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:01,760
But even if you cheer Gab's problem, Stripe is no hero.

181
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:02,840
Well, here's the problem.

182
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:07,320
Doesn't Stripe provide credit card processing services

183
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:09,480
for Patreon?

184
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:11,920
And there's a lot of porn on Patreon.

185
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:16,840
Doesn't Stripe provide credit card processing services

186
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:20,520
for many places that have not safe for work content?

187
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:23,280
Why are they singling out Gab?

188
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:26,800
I don't think the problem here is not safe for work content.

189
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:29,160
I think the problem here is free speech content,

190
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:31,680
because Gab doesn't censor, period.

191
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:34,400
Stripe, according to Gab, told the social network

192
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,240
that it must modify its terms of service

193
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:39,880
to indicate that adult or illegal content cannot be

194
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:43,160
streamed through Gab TV or otherwise distributed

195
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:46,440
through the Gab service, and to put in place reasonable

196
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:50,240
controls to ensure that no adult or illegal content is being

197
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:53,400
streamed through Gab TV or otherwise available on the Gab

198
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:54,640
service.

199
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,240
Gab claims that the service doesn't

200
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,440
allow illegal content on its site

201
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:01,080
and that all adult content is marked not safe for work.

202
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:03,200
We've had this content in a not safe for work setting

203
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:07,040
for two years now with no issues from them until now,

204
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:09,000
Gab wrote in a tweet on Wednesday.

205
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,880
It's no surprise to anyone that when the big social media

206
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:15,680
platform started banning political speech they didn't

207
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:18,800
like, and then those people that were banned

208
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:21,680
decided to take their ball and go home and basically build

209
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:24,800
their own sites, that the SJWs were going

210
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:27,080
to come after them financially.

211
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:28,840
And this part's actually quite interesting.

212
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:30,640
The spokesperson added, it's interesting

213
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:33,160
how we've never had any issues with either of these payment

214
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:36,080
processors over two years now, but all of a sudden when

215
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:38,320
gab.com is the only platform on the internet

216
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:41,960
to host Alex Jones and Infowars, we become the target.

217
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:43,480
Yeah, that is interesting, isn't it?

218
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:45,680
I wonder if Gab could get in contact with Pornhub

219
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:48,040
or some other kind of large porn site

220
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:50,560
and figure out how they handle their money,

221
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:53,000
like what payment processor they use.

222
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
It might be, it just might be the case

223
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,840
that alternative social media networks

224
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:01,960
are going to start after using porn services to stay alive,

225
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:03,640
because Silicon Valley absolutely

226
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:05,400
does not want them to thrive.

227
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:08,200
And speaking of SJW brainlets, I just

228
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:11,880
had to take a look at this article from Kotaku,

229
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:14,880
how the NPC meme, which paints people

230
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:17,840
as agency-free and incapable of critical thought,

231
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:21,800
tries to dehumanize SJWs.

232
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:24,000
And that's a, this is an excellent picture

233
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,560
they've decided to use.

234
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:29,920
Those of you who don't know, the NPC meme basically

235
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:34,280
means that, you know how you have that voice in your head

236
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:36,320
that tells you what to do when you're not speaking,

237
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,720
like you kind of think to yourself

238
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:40,040
in words in some language.

239
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:42,360
You have an imagination, you have the ability

240
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:47,160
to reasonably predict things before you do them.

241
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:51,200
The NPC meme implies that some people out there

242
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,840
don't have that, and they're just

243
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:57,320
like walking machines with no thought behind them.

244
00:09:57,320 --> 00:10:01,880
And Aiden Powleton actually did a pretty good video on this.

245
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:07,360
Well, Kotaku, well, now that it's become a meme,

246
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:13,520
Kotaku is taking offense to it, because apparently SJWs

247
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:16,240
are considered NPCs now.

248
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,560
OK, let's read this.

249
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:19,240
From time to time, and especially

250
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:20,960
if you're a fan of science fiction,

251
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:23,040
you may have had the thought that nobody around you

252
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,840
is actually real.

253
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:27,560
That sentiment has taken root in anti-progressive parts

254
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:30,480
of the internet as a dehumanizing meme,

255
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:33,400
and it borrows some familiar gaming terminology.

256
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:34,920
Of course it does.

257
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:36,680
It's all gamers.

258
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:39,320
We did it all.

259
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:41,280
About a month ago, a meme along those lines

260
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:43,880
took root on 4chan and among anti-progressive online

261
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:44,840
communities.

262
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:47,760
It's called the NPC meme, and it goes like this.

263
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:50,600
Out there in the world, there are literal NPCs,

264
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:53,600
the term for non-playable characters in video games,

265
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:56,280
who have no internality whatsoever.

266
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:58,120
There are some giveaways, of course.

267
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:01,640
They spit out canned lines, like, good weather today, huh?

268
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:05,200
And flocked normie trends, are UGG boots still a thing?

269
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:10,080
And for the most part, share the same uncritical world view.

270
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:14,040
The classic melancholy meme, Wojak, a sad man cruelly drawn

271
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:17,320
in Microsoft Paint, has now received the NPC treatment

272
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:18,520
with NPC Wojak.

273
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:23,320
I didn't know this guy was called Wojak.

274
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:25,200
I just heard it was Feels Guy.

275
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:29,760
Part crackpot social theory and part elementary school insult,

276
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:33,200
the NPC meme originated from a deeply comical medley

277
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:38,080
of bogus physics and stupid religion found on 4chan.

278
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:41,280
Originally posted in 2016, it resurfaced last month.

279
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:42,680
I have a theory that there are only

280
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:45,440
a fixed quantity of souls on planet Earth

281
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:48,200
that cycle continuously through reincarnation.

282
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:50,880
However, since the human growth rate is so severe,

283
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:54,360
the soulless extra walking flesh piles around us

284
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:57,840
are NPCs, or the ultimate normal fags,

285
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:00,640
who autonomously follow group think and social trends

286
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:02,480
in order to appear convincingly human.

287
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,280
God.

288
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:11,720
Listen, I have a feeling that the only reason

289
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:16,320
that you find this insulting and dehumanizing

290
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:19,160
is because you probably have some of the traits

291
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:22,440
that they're describing.

292
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:26,800
I mean, there are a few normie things that I like, all right?

293
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:31,200
There are many non-normie things that I like,

294
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,760
but there's definitely some normie things that I like too.

295
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:38,040
And I don't feel insulted or dehumanized by the NPC meme.

296
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:39,840
I don't feel insulted or dehumanized

297
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:44,520
when someone calls me a fucking 32-year-old boomer, you know?

298
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:47,160
Essentially, some large portion of society, normies,

299
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,240
pop culture fanatics, and Trump haters,

300
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:51,880
who speak in cliches, are in fact NPCs

301
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:54,240
with no internality, agency,

302
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,880
or capacity for critical thought.

303
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:59,800
I mean, there seems to be some,

304
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:04,240
that does seem to be how you guys act, isn't it?

305
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:07,280
I mean, there are many good reasons to hate Trump.

306
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:09,840
There are many, many, many good reasons to hate Trump.

307
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:13,400
However, whenever I come across a bonafide Trump hater,

308
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:16,120
they never actually present one of them.

309
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:17,600
They just call him a racist,

310
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,120
like that's supposed to be something.

311
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:21,720
How to tell when someone is an NPC,

312
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:24,320
wrote anti-SJW alt-right journalist,

313
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,920
Ian Miles-Chiang on Twitter.

314
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:30,160
Update, Chiang returned a request for comment

315
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:32,560
to note that he does not consider himself to be alt-right.

316
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,120
Do you want to know why?

317
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:37,720
Because the alt-right are white identitarians,

318
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:40,480
and Ian Miles-Chiang is Asian.

319
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,760
You fucking morons.

320
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:46,360
Okay, this is how I know you're an NPC,

321
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:49,080
because you think an Asian man can be alt-right.

322
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:52,640
Yeah, this entire article is basically her shrieking

323
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:54,560
how she's not an NPC,

324
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:56,200
while simultaneously describing

325
00:13:56,200 --> 00:14:00,080
all of the NPC characteristics as being part of herself,

326
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:02,080
and saying that that's completely fine.

327
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:06,040
It's, I'm sorry.

328
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:09,240
I'm sorry that you're not even the hero of your own story.

329
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:11,600
Cecilia De Anastasio.

330
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:14,520
Additionally, I know the content has again been sparse, guys.

331
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,000
I'm very sorry about that.

332
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,160
You will hear from me very soon, though,

333
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:21,360
outside of SJ Weeklys.

334
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,200
I love you guys.

335
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:24,100
Thank you for continuing to support me.

336
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:25,000
I'll see you soon.
