00:00.000 --> 00:02.120
Welcome to SJ Weekly, guys.

00:02.120 --> 00:03.840
I'm sick again.

00:03.840 --> 00:07.760
This is the third time since June I've gotten sick.

00:07.760 --> 00:11.160
I have a feeling that maybe my roommate is a disease

00:11.160 --> 00:14.520
vector into the house because he's sick every week.

00:14.520 --> 00:17.040
Today, I'm having a cough drop.

00:17.040 --> 00:17.760
Listen to this.

00:23.760 --> 00:25.120
Fuck yeah.

00:25.120 --> 00:27.280
It's a recolor.

00:27.280 --> 00:29.000
Let's get into it.

00:29.000 --> 00:31.680
A teacher gave my son a detention

00:31.680 --> 00:33.880
for saying he'd vote UKIP.

00:33.880 --> 00:36.160
OK.

00:36.160 --> 00:38.360
Nick Ferrari was shocked when this caller

00:38.360 --> 00:41.520
said his teenage son was given a detention at school

00:41.520 --> 00:44.800
after telling a teacher he'd vote for UKIP.

00:44.800 --> 00:45.680
Is there a video here?

00:45.680 --> 00:47.160
Let's play the video.

00:47.160 --> 00:48.000
All is in Loughton.

00:48.000 --> 00:49.240
Paul, what happened to your son?

00:49.240 --> 00:50.880
He got into trouble, is that right?

00:50.880 --> 00:51.360
Good morning.

00:51.360 --> 00:52.080
Yeah, there was a few of them.

00:52.080 --> 00:53.760
It was during the last general election,

00:53.760 --> 00:57.160
and I was having a debate in his class about who you'd vote for.

00:57.240 --> 00:59.960
And one boy said he'd vote for UKIP,

00:59.960 --> 01:03.440
and the teacher said that all UKIP voters are racist.

01:03.440 --> 01:06.240
So my boy, Dennis, said, well, I'll vote for UKIP,

01:06.240 --> 01:07.880
and I'm not racist.

01:07.880 --> 01:10.480
They're about controlling it, whatever.

01:10.480 --> 01:13.600
And he was given detention, the three boys that said it.

01:13.600 --> 01:15.880
And when he came home and told me, I didn't believe him.

01:15.880 --> 01:17.640
I said, let me ring the school.

01:17.640 --> 01:20.680
And the head of the year said, went and talked about it

01:20.680 --> 01:23.280
to the teacher, came back, and he couldn't apologize enough.

01:23.280 --> 01:26.840
He said it's, you know, she got angry because they said

01:27.000 --> 01:28.560
vote for UKIP.

01:28.560 --> 01:29.680
A teacher gave you?

01:29.680 --> 01:31.240
How old is your boy?

01:31.240 --> 01:32.560
He was 15 at the time.

01:32.560 --> 01:33.440
Oh, my god.

01:33.440 --> 01:36.080
So they're on the verge of becoming young men.

01:36.080 --> 01:38.120
They're a couple of years off from voting.

01:38.120 --> 01:39.960
They're having a conversation about the general election.

01:39.960 --> 01:41.240
One boy says I'd vote UKIP.

01:41.240 --> 01:43.200
Your son, your teacher goes nuts and says they're racist.

01:43.200 --> 01:45.320
Your son, and they get detentions.

01:45.320 --> 01:46.280
They got detentions.

01:46.280 --> 01:47.920
They didn't have to have detentions.

01:47.920 --> 01:49.480
The head of the year really apologized,

01:49.480 --> 01:51.600
said the teacher, if she's going to have a debate,

01:51.600 --> 01:55.120
she's got to be able to take over people's opinions.

01:55.120 --> 01:57.000
So when you challenge the school,

01:57.000 --> 01:59.320
the school took detentions away and apologized.

01:59.320 --> 02:01.680
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, completely.

02:01.680 --> 02:03.800
He really apologized the head of the year.

02:03.800 --> 02:06.040
You can't have a conversation about a general election

02:06.040 --> 02:08.440
then when somebody wants to vote for one of the main parties.

02:08.440 --> 02:11.680
Well, one of the parties is, right, you've got a detention.

02:11.680 --> 02:12.960
That's absurd.

02:12.960 --> 02:14.080
Well, I couldn't believe it.

02:14.080 --> 02:15.640
At the time, I thought there's no way

02:15.640 --> 02:16.920
he's got a detention for that.

02:16.920 --> 02:19.680
But I said I'll ring the school and find out.

02:19.680 --> 02:20.760
Go on, then, Dad, ring him.

02:20.760 --> 02:21.680
Go on, Dad, ring him.

02:21.680 --> 02:24.920
Ring him, it's true, Dad.

02:24.920 --> 02:26.360
Nice story, Paul.

02:26.360 --> 02:28.120
But did the teacher say she?

02:28.120 --> 02:29.640
Did you say it was a she, the teacher?

02:29.640 --> 02:31.440
It was a she, the teacher, yeah, yeah.

02:31.440 --> 02:32.920
It was his form teacher, yeah.

02:32.920 --> 02:35.360
I think she had to apologize to the boys and.

02:35.360 --> 02:36.320
Right, good.

02:36.320 --> 02:38.320
Well, I'm glad the school took the appropriate action.

02:38.320 --> 02:40.600
I'm not saying, by the way, that you should all vote UK.

02:40.600 --> 02:42.320
Say whatever you like, as long as it's not

02:42.320 --> 02:44.040
a banned organization.

02:44.040 --> 02:44.720
Paul, thank you.

02:44.720 --> 02:45.600
Fascinating story.

02:45.600 --> 02:46.080
We.

02:46.080 --> 02:47.720
Holy shit.

02:47.720 --> 02:49.480
OK, well, there we go.

02:49.480 --> 02:51.200
Wow.

02:51.200 --> 02:52.200
I can't fucking believe it.

02:52.200 --> 02:53.000
I mean, it's the UK.

02:53.000 --> 02:54.560
I guess I can believe that.

02:54.600 --> 02:55.720
Let's see what the article says.

02:55.720 --> 02:57.880
One boy said he'd vote for UKIP, and the teacher

02:57.880 --> 03:01.440
said that all UKIP voters are racist.

03:01.440 --> 03:03.240
Imagine actually thinking that.

03:03.240 --> 03:08.400
Imagine actually believing that wanting immigration control

03:08.400 --> 03:10.600
or wanting to leave the EU is racist.

03:10.600 --> 03:13.000
What kind of mental pretzel do you

03:13.000 --> 03:17.360
have to bend yourself into to get into that type of headspace?

03:17.360 --> 03:19.880
It follows reports that a teenager quit her college

03:19.880 --> 03:23.760
course because her tutor warned her she was too right wing

03:23.760 --> 03:26.400
over her support for Tommy Robinson.

03:26.400 --> 03:28.880
Alyssa Cook-Gray, 17, claims a teacher told her,

03:28.880 --> 03:31.360
get out, we don't want people with your views

03:31.360 --> 03:32.720
during a political debate.

03:32.720 --> 03:35.480
Well, guess what, I have that article right here.

03:35.480 --> 03:38.240
Teacher quits college course on first day,

03:38.240 --> 03:41.560
or sorry, teenager quits college course on first day

03:41.560 --> 03:44.600
after being given final warning for declaring her support

03:44.600 --> 03:46.160
for Tommy Robinson.

03:46.160 --> 03:48.760
So not only are you too right wing for this grade school

03:48.760 --> 03:51.640
here, you're too right wing for a college course,

03:51.640 --> 03:55.840
apparently, if you just believe in center right positions that

03:55.840 --> 03:58.320
aren't actually all that unreasonable.

03:58.320 --> 04:00.720
Teenager Alyssa Cook-Gray says she

04:00.720 --> 04:03.200
was given a final warning by her college

04:03.200 --> 04:06.400
because she told classmates her favorite person was

04:06.400 --> 04:08.000
Tommy Robinson.

04:08.000 --> 04:10.000
The 17-year-old was attending the first day

04:10.000 --> 04:13.120
of her art and employability course at Total People

04:13.120 --> 04:16.040
when a political debate erupted among students.

04:16.040 --> 04:18.720
Alyssa says her classmates were openly expressing their support

04:18.720 --> 04:21.240
for labor leader Jeremy Corbyn when

04:21.240 --> 04:24.760
she told them she identified more with right wing ideologies.

04:24.760 --> 04:26.680
When asked who she admired, Alyssa responded

04:26.680 --> 04:29.240
she liked right wing activist Tommy Robinson, who

04:29.240 --> 04:31.360
is best known for forming the English Defense League

04:31.360 --> 04:35.560
and as a vocal opponent of Islam and its followers.

04:35.560 --> 04:38.680
I don't know if this article is presenting this

04:38.680 --> 04:43.840
as if it's a critique of him, because that's actually not

04:43.840 --> 04:47.120
necessarily a bad thing, if you know anything about Islam.

04:50.400 --> 04:53.160
She now feels terrified to return to her course,

04:53.160 --> 04:54.960
has taken the decision it wasn't for her,

04:54.960 --> 04:57.000
quitting after so over an hour of lessons.

04:57.000 --> 05:01.400
Was she kicked out, although she was given, she was kicked out.

05:01.400 --> 05:03.280
Alyssa said, I was given a final warning

05:03.280 --> 05:04.520
for being too right wing.

05:04.520 --> 05:07.000
It was the first day we were all having a conversation where

05:07.000 --> 05:08.040
Jeremy Corbyn came up.

05:08.040 --> 05:10.000
I asked people not to get in it because it was

05:10.000 --> 05:11.640
filled with a room of lefties.

05:11.640 --> 05:13.600
I said my opinion and the teacher said, get out.

05:13.600 --> 05:15.920
We don't want people with your views.

05:15.920 --> 05:18.200
I was given a final warning for being too right wing.

05:18.200 --> 05:20.000
The class then started asking everyone

05:20.000 --> 05:22.800
who their favorite person was, and I said Tommy Robinson.

05:22.800 --> 05:24.440
I like what he's doing for our country,

05:24.440 --> 05:25.400
and I follow all the stories.

05:25.400 --> 05:26.400
I think he's a savior.

05:26.400 --> 05:29.160
Stoke on Trent Live approached Total People for comment,

05:29.160 --> 05:32.960
but the organization is yet to respond to our requests.

05:32.960 --> 05:34.840
However, a spokesperson for Total People

05:34.840 --> 05:39.040
told the Mirror Online, we are an inclusive organization.

05:39.040 --> 05:42.040
We are values led, and we ask that all learners

05:42.040 --> 05:44.120
are collaborative, respect each other's views,

05:44.120 --> 05:46.160
and work towards common goals.

05:46.160 --> 05:48.600
We have successfully worked with learners over a 20 year

05:48.600 --> 05:50.760
period from many different backgrounds, religions,

05:50.760 --> 05:53.040
and diverse cultures, but apparently not

05:53.040 --> 05:55.280
diverse political opinions.

05:55.280 --> 05:58.520
And it would also seem like people are becoming too right

05:58.520 --> 06:00.760
wing for money because there's this tweet

06:00.760 --> 06:04.520
from the alternate social media platform Gab.

06:04.520 --> 06:08.240
They say, next it will be banks cutting us off and others.

06:08.240 --> 06:09.200
You think we're joking.

06:09.200 --> 06:11.480
We predicted payment processors would.

06:11.480 --> 06:13.640
We predicted hosting providers would.

06:13.640 --> 06:16.000
We proved DNS providers do.

06:16.000 --> 06:18.200
This whole thing started with something

06:18.200 --> 06:22.000
that I mentioned in my anti-social media video

06:22.000 --> 06:25.920
with Cloudflare kicking off the Daily Stormer arbitrarily

06:25.920 --> 06:26.760
for no reason.

06:26.760 --> 06:27.880
They just did it.

06:27.880 --> 06:30.040
And then that started the cascade,

06:30.040 --> 06:33.560
which culminated recently in Alex Jones being completely

06:33.560 --> 06:36.000
blown off the internet in its entirety.

06:36.000 --> 06:39.280
What they're referring to specifically is this.

06:39.280 --> 06:43.720
Stripe freezes Gab's account for not safe for work content,

06:43.720 --> 06:47.760
shining a light on a problematic policy.

06:47.760 --> 06:51.720
Social network Gab, a haven for toxic alt-right personalities

06:51.720 --> 06:54.400
banned from more mainstream platforms,

06:54.400 --> 06:57.600
has had its Stripe account frozen due to adult content

06:57.600 --> 06:59.320
on the platform.

06:59.320 --> 07:01.760
But even if you cheer Gab's problem, Stripe is no hero.

07:01.760 --> 07:02.840
Well, here's the problem.

07:02.840 --> 07:07.320
Doesn't Stripe provide credit card processing services

07:07.320 --> 07:09.480
for Patreon?

07:09.480 --> 07:11.920
And there's a lot of porn on Patreon.

07:11.920 --> 07:16.840
Doesn't Stripe provide credit card processing services

07:16.840 --> 07:20.520
for many places that have not safe for work content?

07:20.520 --> 07:23.280
Why are they singling out Gab?

07:23.280 --> 07:26.800
I don't think the problem here is not safe for work content.

07:26.800 --> 07:29.160
I think the problem here is free speech content,

07:29.160 --> 07:31.680
because Gab doesn't censor, period.

07:31.680 --> 07:34.400
Stripe, according to Gab, told the social network

07:34.400 --> 07:36.240
that it must modify its terms of service

07:36.240 --> 07:39.880
to indicate that adult or illegal content cannot be

07:39.880 --> 07:43.160
streamed through Gab TV or otherwise distributed

07:43.160 --> 07:46.440
through the Gab service, and to put in place reasonable

07:46.440 --> 07:50.240
controls to ensure that no adult or illegal content is being

07:50.240 --> 07:53.400
streamed through Gab TV or otherwise available on the Gab

07:53.400 --> 07:54.640
service.

07:54.640 --> 07:56.240
Gab claims that the service doesn't

07:56.240 --> 07:58.440
allow illegal content on its site

07:58.440 --> 08:01.080
and that all adult content is marked not safe for work.

08:01.080 --> 08:03.200
We've had this content in a not safe for work setting

08:03.200 --> 08:07.040
for two years now with no issues from them until now,

08:07.040 --> 08:09.000
Gab wrote in a tweet on Wednesday.

08:09.000 --> 08:12.880
It's no surprise to anyone that when the big social media

08:12.880 --> 08:15.680
platform started banning political speech they didn't

08:15.680 --> 08:18.800
like, and then those people that were banned

08:18.800 --> 08:21.680
decided to take their ball and go home and basically build

08:21.680 --> 08:24.800
their own sites, that the SJWs were going

08:24.800 --> 08:27.080
to come after them financially.

08:27.080 --> 08:28.840
And this part's actually quite interesting.

08:28.840 --> 08:30.640
The spokesperson added, it's interesting

08:30.640 --> 08:33.160
how we've never had any issues with either of these payment

08:33.160 --> 08:36.080
processors over two years now, but all of a sudden when

08:36.080 --> 08:38.320
gab.com is the only platform on the internet

08:38.320 --> 08:41.960
to host Alex Jones and Infowars, we become the target.

08:41.960 --> 08:43.480
Yeah, that is interesting, isn't it?

08:43.480 --> 08:45.680
I wonder if Gab could get in contact with Pornhub

08:45.680 --> 08:48.040
or some other kind of large porn site

08:48.040 --> 08:50.560
and figure out how they handle their money,

08:50.560 --> 08:53.000
like what payment processor they use.

08:53.000 --> 08:56.000
It might be, it just might be the case

08:56.000 --> 08:58.840
that alternative social media networks

08:58.840 --> 09:01.960
are going to start after using porn services to stay alive,

09:01.960 --> 09:03.640
because Silicon Valley absolutely

09:03.640 --> 09:05.400
does not want them to thrive.

09:05.400 --> 09:08.200
And speaking of SJW brainlets, I just

09:08.200 --> 09:11.880
had to take a look at this article from Kotaku,

09:11.880 --> 09:14.880
how the NPC meme, which paints people

09:14.880 --> 09:17.840
as agency-free and incapable of critical thought,

09:17.840 --> 09:21.800
tries to dehumanize SJWs.

09:21.800 --> 09:24.000
And that's a, this is an excellent picture

09:24.000 --> 09:26.560
they've decided to use.

09:26.560 --> 09:29.920
Those of you who don't know, the NPC meme basically

09:29.960 --> 09:34.280
means that, you know how you have that voice in your head

09:34.280 --> 09:36.320
that tells you what to do when you're not speaking,

09:36.320 --> 09:37.720
like you kind of think to yourself

09:37.720 --> 09:40.040
in words in some language.

09:40.040 --> 09:42.360
You have an imagination, you have the ability

09:42.360 --> 09:47.160
to reasonably predict things before you do them.

09:47.160 --> 09:51.200
The NPC meme implies that some people out there

09:51.200 --> 09:53.840
don't have that, and they're just

09:53.840 --> 09:57.320
like walking machines with no thought behind them.

09:57.320 --> 10:01.880
And Aiden Powleton actually did a pretty good video on this.

10:01.880 --> 10:07.360
Well, Kotaku, well, now that it's become a meme,

10:07.360 --> 10:13.520
Kotaku is taking offense to it, because apparently SJWs

10:13.520 --> 10:16.240
are considered NPCs now.

10:16.240 --> 10:17.560
OK, let's read this.

10:17.560 --> 10:19.240
From time to time, and especially

10:19.240 --> 10:20.960
if you're a fan of science fiction,

10:20.960 --> 10:23.040
you may have had the thought that nobody around you

10:23.040 --> 10:24.840
is actually real.

10:24.840 --> 10:27.560
That sentiment has taken root in anti-progressive parts

10:27.560 --> 10:30.480
of the internet as a dehumanizing meme,

10:30.480 --> 10:33.400
and it borrows some familiar gaming terminology.

10:33.400 --> 10:34.920
Of course it does.

10:34.920 --> 10:36.680
It's all gamers.

10:36.680 --> 10:39.320
We did it all.

10:39.320 --> 10:41.280
About a month ago, a meme along those lines

10:41.280 --> 10:43.880
took root on 4chan and among anti-progressive online

10:43.880 --> 10:44.840
communities.

10:44.840 --> 10:47.760
It's called the NPC meme, and it goes like this.

10:47.760 --> 10:50.600
Out there in the world, there are literal NPCs,

10:50.600 --> 10:53.600
the term for non-playable characters in video games,

10:53.600 --> 10:56.280
who have no internality whatsoever.

10:56.280 --> 10:58.120
There are some giveaways, of course.

10:58.120 --> 11:01.640
They spit out canned lines, like, good weather today, huh?

11:01.640 --> 11:05.200
And flocked normie trends, are UGG boots still a thing?

11:05.200 --> 11:10.080
And for the most part, share the same uncritical world view.

11:10.080 --> 11:14.040
The classic melancholy meme, Wojak, a sad man cruelly drawn

11:14.040 --> 11:17.320
in Microsoft Paint, has now received the NPC treatment

11:17.320 --> 11:18.520
with NPC Wojak.

11:21.520 --> 11:23.320
I didn't know this guy was called Wojak.

11:23.320 --> 11:25.200
I just heard it was Feels Guy.

11:25.200 --> 11:29.760
Part crackpot social theory and part elementary school insult,

11:29.760 --> 11:33.200
the NPC meme originated from a deeply comical medley

11:33.200 --> 11:38.080
of bogus physics and stupid religion found on 4chan.

11:38.080 --> 11:41.280
Originally posted in 2016, it resurfaced last month.

11:41.280 --> 11:42.680
I have a theory that there are only

11:42.680 --> 11:45.440
a fixed quantity of souls on planet Earth

11:45.440 --> 11:48.200
that cycle continuously through reincarnation.

11:48.200 --> 11:50.880
However, since the human growth rate is so severe,

11:50.920 --> 11:54.360
the soulless extra walking flesh piles around us

11:54.360 --> 11:57.840
are NPCs, or the ultimate normal fags,

11:57.840 --> 12:00.640
who autonomously follow group think and social trends

12:00.640 --> 12:02.480
in order to appear convincingly human.

12:06.480 --> 12:08.280
God.

12:08.280 --> 12:11.720
Listen, I have a feeling that the only reason

12:11.720 --> 12:16.320
that you find this insulting and dehumanizing

12:16.320 --> 12:19.160
is because you probably have some of the traits

12:19.160 --> 12:22.440
that they're describing.

12:22.440 --> 12:26.800
I mean, there are a few normie things that I like, all right?

12:26.800 --> 12:31.200
There are many non-normie things that I like,

12:31.200 --> 12:33.760
but there's definitely some normie things that I like too.

12:33.760 --> 12:38.040
And I don't feel insulted or dehumanized by the NPC meme.

12:38.040 --> 12:39.840
I don't feel insulted or dehumanized

12:39.840 --> 12:44.520
when someone calls me a fucking 32-year-old boomer, you know?

12:44.520 --> 12:47.160
Essentially, some large portion of society, normies,

12:47.200 --> 12:49.240
pop culture fanatics, and Trump haters,

12:49.240 --> 12:51.880
who speak in cliches, are in fact NPCs

12:51.880 --> 12:54.240
with no internality, agency,

12:54.240 --> 12:55.880
or capacity for critical thought.

12:57.240 --> 12:59.800
I mean, there seems to be some,

13:01.160 --> 13:04.240
that does seem to be how you guys act, isn't it?

13:04.240 --> 13:07.280
I mean, there are many good reasons to hate Trump.

13:07.280 --> 13:09.840
There are many, many, many good reasons to hate Trump.

13:09.840 --> 13:13.400
However, whenever I come across a bonafide Trump hater,

13:13.400 --> 13:16.120
they never actually present one of them.

13:16.120 --> 13:17.600
They just call him a racist,

13:17.600 --> 13:19.120
like that's supposed to be something.

13:19.120 --> 13:21.720
How to tell when someone is an NPC,

13:21.720 --> 13:24.320
wrote anti-SJW alt-right journalist,

13:24.320 --> 13:25.920
Ian Miles-Chiang on Twitter.

13:27.640 --> 13:30.160
Update, Chiang returned a request for comment

13:30.160 --> 13:32.560
to note that he does not consider himself to be alt-right.

13:32.560 --> 13:34.120
Do you want to know why?

13:34.120 --> 13:37.720
Because the alt-right are white identitarians,

13:37.720 --> 13:40.480
and Ian Miles-Chiang is Asian.

13:40.480 --> 13:42.760
You fucking morons.

13:42.840 --> 13:46.360
Okay, this is how I know you're an NPC,

13:46.360 --> 13:49.080
because you think an Asian man can be alt-right.

13:49.080 --> 13:52.640
Yeah, this entire article is basically her shrieking

13:52.640 --> 13:54.560
how she's not an NPC,

13:54.560 --> 13:56.200
while simultaneously describing

13:56.200 --> 14:00.080
all of the NPC characteristics as being part of herself,

14:00.080 --> 14:02.080
and saying that that's completely fine.

14:02.080 --> 14:06.040
It's, I'm sorry.

14:06.040 --> 14:09.240
I'm sorry that you're not even the hero of your own story.

14:09.240 --> 14:11.600
Cecilia De Anastasio.

14:11.600 --> 14:14.520
Additionally, I know the content has again been sparse, guys.

14:14.520 --> 14:16.000
I'm very sorry about that.

14:16.000 --> 14:18.160
You will hear from me very soon, though,

14:19.240 --> 14:21.360
outside of SJ Weeklys.

14:21.360 --> 14:22.200
I love you guys.

14:22.200 --> 14:24.100
Thank you for continuing to support me.

14:24.100 --> 14:25.000
I'll see you soon.
