{"text": " Dave the hipster here to talk about artsy fucking movies We're on our we're just about to catch the bus the autobus to see a man of steel Neither of us really know much about it I've heard some pretty bad things about it to be honest. Yeah, so I'm not going into this with open arms I'm not gonna lie. I'm not a huge Superman fan. I liked Smallville. I really like really like Smallville I like to do a degree. I like Lois and Clark more. Yep. Yeah, that was a much better show You know what? I liked what that one Superman cartoon where he beat up Japanese people because it was made in like the 1930s Everyone did it back then. Okay, all the superheroes the job. All right. Well anyways, even Bugs Bunny did it. Yeah, that's true And yeah, Donald Duck became a Nazi. Yeah. Anyways, that's that's completely off the beaten track there. Please don't suck Please don't be garbage. I know it'll be a good popcorn movie. At least you think so most likely It's gonna be all flash and cash but all flash. No cash. Is that is that a saying? I think so. I'd like to say it Um, I don't know Mmm, I Haven't liked any of the other Superman movies. I haven't seen Superman Returns So I like the original Superman movie Superman's hard to make a movie for like I was yeah I was saying this earlier upstairs like Batman has a bunch of really good villains Superman doesn't know Superman's villains are not rooted in bleh in like cultural lexicon Funny she said lexicon Yeah, but like everyone even non comic book readers know who Batman and the Joker are yeah, you know Yeah, I've heard of Lex Luthor. They've heard of him, but he's not as ubiquitous as the Joker No, because he's not he's he's just a guy. He's just Manipulative he's a demon and cruel but he's not he's not like psychotic Yeah, but I mean even even beyond that like everyone knows most of Batman's villains. Yeah, they do Batman's villains They're just they're just more interesting to begin with because they're yeah, they all seem like splinters of his of his Psyche from when he was, you know, horribly scarred. I wouldn't go quite that far. That's a fan theory Superman I mean when it comes down to it Superman's you know his parents didn't die. His parents got old. That's it. No his parents died of old age No, his real parents died Okay-dotted and then his other parents died of old age actually the story goes that his his father is adopted father Jonathan supposed to died of a heart attack. He was like a teenager. That's not how it went though So it's on the movies in most stories of that Superman's in He's still kind of old and around and just like an old man out in the farm. There's different there's different ones, right? I mean you can say this is Candace's Canada, but like whatever it's not really that's not so much an important thing The thing is is Superman himself makes a good bill This isn't gonna be a movie about that though, but it's not so that's why I'm not really holding out for yeah But that that's you. I like you know, I like Zod though. Yeah, I hope this Zod is okay if there's gonna be if there's gonna be a villain in a Superman movie if it's not Lex and Yeah, there is cuz It doesn't make sense for it to be anybody else no Zod was the quintessential Superman but you know what? This before we before you take off I'm gonna say one more thing This seems like it's gonna have this the Star Trek syndrome of the last movie we watched probably where it'll be like police We know it's odd they have yeah They have con in there just because it's con and cuz they and cuz they want to capitalize on the sequel on that trend That movies are going with now. They're gonna go with they're gonna go with Zod to do the exact same thing It's gonna feel the same I bet This time I agree with you. So let's let's go the movie Before crappy movie. Yes. I would have to actually use that line Neil Hey guys, we just got back from watching Man of Steel. Yeah, as you can tell it's night out We're still on our back porch. Just it's night. This is a Porsche or a deck deck. It's a deck. Yeah Yeah, what's the what's that because they're made of wood and they're both have banisters and you can usually fit chairs on them So what's like what how does it go from deck to porch? What's the size difference? And What do you think of it would you think of that seal I Have very mixed feelings about it. Do you um, let me see now. I mix them with Yes Alternative blend man. Okay, honestly, I thought overall it was okay It wasn't as impressive as I found Star Trek. I Found that I'm just gonna start off with the thing. I don't like the lowest. Okay, it's all right, by the way spoilers Yeah, well knows odds in it Cumberbatch was odd. I Don't even I don't even know who plays odd. I can't remember why I camera his name, but I didn't like him I honestly I thought he was kind of over he over acted a lot and I want to get this out of the way right now just Just what happened in my mind and has nothing to do it with anything in the movie Well, it does but it's not a big critique. Okay, but remember how there was the scene where Zod's like like Zod Lands on earth and he has his helmet off and he's like He's like looking at his arm and he finally gets his senses in order, you know It zooms in really close in his face. He gets the same powers of Superman Yeah, but it zooms in really close in his face and he's like I finally yeah I finally have my senses in order I can control his senses Yeah, there's they left a giant zit on his nose And it was just like yeah They took up like one eight to the screen just this giant zit cuz they zoomed in so close and I was like Did you notice that? Yeah Fucking makeup fail Well, I think I'd actually made sense. I think leaving it in made sense cuz I mean he He's stressing out and he he was just dirty at that point I mean, I like the realism and in the giant Zod zit But every the rest of the movie, yeah, but the rest of them was just not I think I saw two scenes with him in there that were actually Actually, okay to good He had some good lines though. Like he had that the one where He was talking to like a computer program of Superman's dad Jor-el played by Russell Crowe. Yeah, he was he was like Yeah, he was talking to it to Jor-el and he's and Jor-el is like you can't you can't kill everyone He's like I'm arguing the merits of genocide with a ghost. Yeah, that was kind of funny There was actually a couple laughs and then and then when he says like where did you train on a farm? Yeah There and yeah, there were some good he had a he had a few decent lines They weren't like other characters in the movie like overly funny though where like the girl said I just think Superman's kind of hot Yeah, there were some goofy lines that made me chuckle There was a few but that was another thing about the movie. I found that Wasn't quite as endearing was that it took its way too seriously. Mmm. It was just So over-the-top and I mean it is Superman and Superman has a certain flexibility and being over-the-top However, you can't make a realistic world and then Do what they did with it there and expect people to take it seriously. Yeah, like it was Dragon Ball Z fights It was like smashing people through fucking the earth Welcome to earth. Welcome to going through the entire earth Great Smashing people through buildings and shit and like, you know speaking of that Like that final fight between Zod and Superman. Mm-hmm. Okay, so Superman Okay at the end of the movie Superman kills Zod and others He kills Zod and then he's like overcome by a grief that he had to kill somebody Like in his fight with Zod, they're like smashing each other through fucking Skyscrapers and they're just collapsing on to each other and like in that fight. They have killed millions of people At least thousands like they're throwing around fucking oil tankers that explode and like helicopters are falling out of the fucking sky like super like the collateral damage to both lives and Stuff. Yeah, it's Superman directly causes in his fight with Zod. There's catastrophic really not that much emphasis on evacuation efforts No so much because you think that like everyone's fucking just yeah Cuz you see like three three people from the Daily Planet including Perry White just running away Yeah, and that guy's running from the building as they're building slowly collapses on top of them. Yeah, you know, it's and like Pretty evident. There's no there's no real warning there No and like the final That the final plan is odd is to like terraform the earth with this giant beam that goes through the center of the earth's core That was pretty cool. Actually, I like that. It was kind of neat Like the way they were like lifting up the gravity that gravity was like lifting shit and smashing it down again Because it was slowly increasing. Yeah each time because they're It's like drinkable see it's like a hundred tons of gravity. Yeah, and that was neat That was neat to see but like fucking everybody died Like there were no survivors of this fucking movie or there shouldn't have been Dude there's survivors that much fucking destruction like how many people the other side of camera just died the other side Wasn't so bad, but metropolis the core metropolis. There were probably thousands of casualties. Yeah Yeah, like like and like how many were mentioned military how many were like directly by superman like when Superman gets pissed off He's like don't talk about my mom like that And I was like your mom and then Superman just tackles them and then they fly through 30 buildings He killed people. All right. All right. All right So I think we're getting up too much in his semantics here. I'd like to talk a little bit more bigger picture Here's where I'm going with this Okay, Superman cries at the end cuz he killed Zod. He has killed millions before the inadvertently though This is the first person he's killed directly So also I did like at the ends odds like James Bond esque fucking laser like getting closer to the families I Think the plot was very disjointed it just kept going back. I swear to God it felt like a fucking absolute loss I didn't mind the flashbacks I didn't mind the fact that we would go back and like see but they just bring on these elements and they wouldn't explain them I like the fact that that we would go back and see Superman's Childhood because it was it was an origin story that made sense. Yeah, we went back and saw his childhood it that aspect I was fine with I just I thought it was kind of weird They started off with him being an adult and working on a fucking fishing but Batman did that In Batman Begins like it starts with him as an adult in the Chinese prison and it shows his childhood. Yeah. Yeah It's the same thing. I think they handled it better though. Yeah. Yeah, I mean a little bit my dad I mean and and and they showed they showed in the movie that Canadians are real jerks. Yeah Apparently if you're getting into their assholes, you're a good-looking guy from from America automatically. We hate you Yeah, so we'll just get into bar fights with you in Nova Scotia Although that was another part that was funny though what he does this guy who started beating. I think that's a good a Good take on the fortress of solitude The fact that it was like a 20,000 year old Derelict kryptonian ship just frozen in the ice it does that was me It is a lot more convenient instead of him just standing where they're there with a heat rate He did burrow his way in though Yeah, like to get into this ship He did he fucking tunneled through the ice with his heat vision but like the fortress of solitude originally wasn't like like something that He built himself Hang out as a natural ice But like he kind of like sculpted it with his yeah with his super powers He did but like in this one. It is a frozen ship. Yeah, which is I think in a neat like I'm not a purist. I like when Franchises they if you're gonna remake a franchise do something new with it put a different spin on it I'm okay with that and with the fortress of solitude making it into a derelict kryptonian ship made sense. I think it was cool That was the only thing I really thought was cool this movie one part that kind of rankled with me as well was they they introduced like they introduced Superman as Clark Kent to Lois Lane really fast like she found out so fast. Yeah, that's because Superman was never he never really called himself Superman. He wasn't he was never really a superhero in this You know she was gonna start calling Well, I don't think you own what she was Like even when he is in the Superman costume. He's called Clark Kent or Kal-el Yeah, I should call him Cal. Yeah, they call him. They just call him Cal Yeah, like he's either one of the other they don't call him anything else When using the costume like she goes to say what why doesn't the s stand for soup and it just kind of stops Yeah, like she's interrupted and like that. It's not an ass. Yeah That is another thing like I like the art direction in this I liked how there was like the floating like like Balls that turn into faces. Yeah, I was like a organic metal Yeah, that was really cool. And I liked how they explained the Superman symbol like just being random ass fucking symbols for every house Yeah, they even know I had like the same the same thing like this But it was like the same very the same the same emerald shape but had like a different symbol on it Everyone had like a different some yeah, they did and she just happened to look like an ass Yeah, and that's why we need What I don't like though is how like when he's exploring the ship and his dad's like, by the way Here's your suit and it's just like here's here's the Superman suit Oh, yeah, if I'm gonna draw a parallel between this and anything else. I just read Superman earth one graphic novel and it's takes place when Clark is 20 and He's been to junior college he's off to metropolis He's trying to find a job and his landlady says, you know, you should go get more education It's like I'm okay goes he tries over a football team just creams them goes and goes and solves. It is an incredibly intense equation with drawing Electrician salt water or something like that and Then he goes and he becomes like this massively successful stockbroker because he's so intelligent, right? Wasn't that like that was something they retcon that like Superman like in at least in modern comics only really has average Intelligence that he can't keep up to Batman in terms of intelligence That was a thing they made they did like Batman is like the smartest motherfucker in the universe Well, the thing also a Superman is he can meet people's minds. So he might be a can he is he could even he can hear? people's thoughts Oh can he He yes, he can you couldn't in this movie? Yes, he could when he's when he's in the closet and the other kids like oh what a freak. He's hearing them talk He's not hearing that. He's not hearing their thoughts. He's hearing them talk through the wall. He has super sensitive hearing Superman can hear every what everyone's saying also I don't know one point you can read mine I'm sure there's like a new duration of Superman where he has the power to read minds But I think commonly Superman's powers have always been like super super senses. Yeah, the super senses the flying the strength The Invulnerability. I don't think there was a healing factor just invulnerability He had no idea. He doesn't have a healing factor because when he's on The ship he is attacked. Yeah Like scout ship he gets attacked and he's got a cut and he still got it. Yeah It takes time to heal Well, then like there is an in the Dark Knight Returns Superman has a healing factor based on just how much sunlight he gets Cuz he gets hit directly with a nuke in that comic and he's like a fucking just like like near-death like cripple skeleton He's like, ah, and then he just gets into the center This comes back Yeah, I there's there's a definitely some Yeah with this movie. I Didn't mind the flashbacks. I like Kevin Costner. He was good. He was good as I thought Between him and Russell Crowe. They were the best people the best characters in the movie Yeah, they both did they had enough lines to make an impact to have wait, but they didn't eclipse anyone else Yeah, they were both. They're just good. There's like you're just like character acting. Yes. They were both good in this movie They're both different kinds of dads entirely. Yeah, but like with with Jonathan Kent Like the one thing I didn't like about him Was How he was like he wanted Superman to hide his powers to the point of letting people die including himself Yeah spoilers. Yeah, like I don't think that's something that Jonathan Kent would do like Like Superman like the fucking bus bus crashes into the lake and Superman's like what should I shave is let them drown? He's like, I don't know You know, like, you know, I think what he's implying is that he should have saved them anyways But he should have been more careful about instead of lifting the bus directly on the water He should just you know Like just kind of threw them up in the surface cuz he's got the strength to do it Yeah, just grab that, you know everyone cuz he would have had enough time. Mm-hmm It wouldn't have taken that long He could have done and then just like and then just like oh man, I just say yeah Um, you know what I say to you. I'm a good swimmer. Yeah, but I mean it just seemed Maybe you took that from that. I didn't take that from that for me to me It seemed like Jonathan Kent was actually advocating letting the kids die or at least considering the possibility of letting everyone in the bus died to tell it so that so that Clark can just go on without being discovered which is not very much like also like kind of a weird version of Uncle Ben Yeah, well his death was was very Uncle Ben esque like, you know, yeah Man could have like saved him immediately without even breaking a sweat and he looks at him. Yeah. Yeah, he's standing there He's standing there like in the middle of this fucking in like the eye of a tornado and he's just like no He's not even the eyes of the outskirts. No, wait, he's standing there in the middle of this fucking tornado and he just goes no It's like don't worry about he just goes God, yeah. Yeah, he goes back to save a fucking dog. Yeah a dog. Yeah that dies to save a dog Yeah, that's not right. I was stupid. Yeah, if you went back to save a human I could see it but a dog Yeah, I like what yeah, but really don't sacrifice your life to save a fucking dog. Yeah, I That Like I didn't buy that Jonathan Kent was so committed to Not revealing his son's identity that he would say no, let's have people die. Well, I didn't buy that it wasn't he was anti Revelation he was he was against him showing himself at the improper time when he wasn't already I mean if you notice he said I'm 33. Mm-hmm. It's like a whole Jesus thing They were drawing parallels to Jesus. Well, of course, I mean remember when he like he floated out into space and he's like There is a Christian bent to the movie, yeah, there really is I mean he even goes and talks to a priest And here's the problem with being 33 Like he's 33. He discovers the he discovers the the fortress of solitude. He talks to his dad He gets the suit and he's like you need to train your powers and become strong It's like okay, so he starts like jumping around in the Arctic and I'm like If you're 33 and you're a kid and you're lifting buses out of the fucking ocean Yeah, he's already got the potential to do like no. No, like you're only now testing the limits of your abilities Yeah, like he was flying and like he's like yeah, this is awesome man, I can fly and you're 33 Oh don't explain it Don't you think you would have like looked into that shit earlier if you knew you had all these big stage explain Actually, and like I'm not in the movie, but they explained in the one comic I read this isn't the fucking comics Dave No, but it does make sense the material that it is. It's a Kryptonian material that cannot be burnt or ripped or Melted by conventional earth means therefore. It's the only thing he can wear in order to fly Otherwise, it would just get torn off. So he just will end up in the middle of nowhere bare-ass naked Okay fair enough, but do you think a ten-year-old who has crazy amounts of superpowers? He couldn't fly until he would though would try it even in the original movie He still didn't start like flying until he was 33. No. No, he was he was in his teens Okay, so he's in his teens and he goes to try to fly and he flies and rips his clothes off and goes Oh, well, I'm naked. But now I know I can fly. No. No in this movie. He doesn't even try it to lose three like that Doesn't make sense to me He should have tested the boundaries of his abilities before his his real dad comes along because because there's a scene where he's going from a fishing boat to the top of a oil rig and In like two seconds, so he has to have jumped he has to have some notion that he can do it Yeah, it's just that he hasn't but to really push himself right, but the fact that he is Like elated It's obvious that that moment in the movie was his first time flying It is they make it clear by the way He's reacting by the way He but by the way, he's he's doing it is his first time flying and I don't buy that I think you would have tried it if you were when you were younger, it's half-baked That's the whole movies half-baked that's what exactly I was gonna say the whole movie is half is it's it's half-assed It's got good action scenes. It's got ridiculous action. See it's got well, they're well-made Special effects was I wasn't I wasn't worried about that. I was worried about the plot I mean about characterization Here's the problem like you can go in and like go down the list of things that are good in a movie and you can Tick off special effects, but like does that really mean anything anymore having good special effects? It's a summer action not a blockbuster It's a summer action blockbuster it having great special effects, which it does it comes on. It does not give it any full facts It's not really the CG so much as the makeup Yeah, it's consistency Yeah, and I mean what it comes down the art direction the art direction in this movie was great the costuming the the looks of Like Krypton. Oh speaking of Krypton. How is he like he's like I Russell Crowe someone's fucking a tree you mean Falkor and like Goes on this fucking chase scene. Yeah, like fucking like space helicopters after him. That was a bit much one with nature You like he's like a world of Warcraft hunter who like blows Like blows his whistle and like his pet appears. He just flies away bro. Let's go Epic Yeah, it was pretty far-fetched so Yeah, they also they developed Zod's Female right-hand woman there a lot to Easton amount one thing that bothered me about her was she was in there in there in Superman Too anyway, wasn't she? Yeah, she had he had two people. Yeah. The one thing that bothered me about her It wasn't like a huge thing, but She gets hit so much and then she gets a missile she catches a missile and that knocks her out Well, it was a pretty big missile Still I mean Dave Dave, she took a hell of a life give any woman a meat missile and she will get knocked out No, no, like I I I I bought that because the missile seemed much more destructive than even like a kryptonian punch All right, well that was the only thing that really rankle with me But I mean like yeah the destructiveness of those fight scenes between like Superman Zod Superman and all the other kryptonians They're like smashing concrete. Yeah, they're blowing up I hops Honestly, if I'm gonna say anything about a recommendation like I'm I'm gonna go see it again. Are you yes I'm gonna go see it again and it's well This time I'm gonna I'm gonna try to look at it more objectively. Mm-hmm, and hopefully I'll like it more I'm not I'm not just I'm going with other people. So yeah, but I mean like oh Yes, we can have the I hops Pete dude, there's so much product placement like the no key. She like He and I hop that was pretty much she's climbing up like the side of this of this ledge or something She's like she she puts her fucking camera. She puts her camera on ledges like oh, oh fuck She's like catches her breath And the whole time is just like on the Nokia just filling the screen or Or the I hope yeah Funny though like Pete I'm the manager of I hope yeah, he's just like I'm working on I hope that's like, okay And but then like they come back to the I hop and like destroy it in a fight Yeah, and then Superman looks at Pete Pete looks at Superman like I know you So you're having a fight in my eye There are like kind of buddies, I think it was implied they're like sort of like the closest thing of friends that Superman had yeah, and in the in Smallville, they are friends like which is like actually yeah, like how come It they didn't really show like Lana Lang being friends of them or anything What I think they just want to throw it in as a you want to make him a loner in this one, basically Yeah, I mean let's because if he wanders in his baby he finds that the ship like he is a loner And I don't think they really want to spend much time on building another romantic angle. They just wanted those yeah, because I mean, I mean Lana for anyone who's Any somewhat super fan worth their salt? They're not gonna they're not gonna Deny that Lana Lang was a presence in his in his youth. Mm-hmm Yeah, but I mean, yeah, I think they just wanted to build up as a loner like yeah This this entire movie is about Superman being alone and then discovering who he is. Yeah, it's the opposite of Smallville Smallville Like he's got Lex as a buddy. He's got Pete as a buddy. He's got the Chloe chick. He's got Lana Eventually Lois. Yeah later on. Yeah, so it is it's very much kind of the The same old crap that we you know, the same thing we were talking about before. Yeah, it's like it's just the same sort of You know the lone wolf going against the chaotic that the engine of chaos you yeah, yeah, definitely You mentioned before Zod and I'm talking about Zod a bit. Here's the thing. I Went into this thinking I'd be disappointed by him and I wasn't I wasn't I think he's a good actor and Zod's a great character and they wrote Zod well and how Zod looked was great But this guy was not the guy to play Zod. No, he wasn't I I like to be like Nationalist, but I think a British guy should play Cumberbatch, no, no, no, no, but I mean Those are big shoes to fill. That's Terrence stamp. Mm-hmm. That guy was that guy was like he if they didn't do a kneel Didn't do kneel before Zod. No, they didn't even some other shit. They did This is Krypton. Yeah And they did I will find him which is from doing if you saw doing And I do and barely I've watched the miniseries and we watch all day the actual movie because it was really fucking long Yeah, dude, and it has staying in it. So Anyways, but no with the Zod like He's a good actor and like the lines they wrote for him were all great lines and how he looked I was all of them But but his delivery was was but he was not the guy to play Zod Otherwise everything and everything involving Zod was pretty, you know, I think part of it was to he had a speech at Benjamin did he? Yeah, I couldn't tell. Yes. Yeah, it sounded like it was like Like his asses or something it's something there's something weird about the way he spoke Yeah, it's I didn't speech at Benjamin. I didn't even notice or I could tell I could hear the whole way through It was really and it was really getting on me. I was like, what the hell is that? There's something about him despite the fact that he's American or I think he was American, you know I don't even look up the actor might even Canadian might have been who knows what have been English Yeah, but the fact that he was using American or a new American classic kind of accent But he had something weird about his voice. Yeah Well here here like I said before that Batman's Batman's and villains They're more Notable in common society. It's like like you have the Joker everyone knows who the Joker is. You've got The you know Catwoman everyone knows who that woman is you have even bane to to a limited extent everyone knows who things Everyone everyone knows who the Riddler. Yeah, everyone knows they have That's more flash and more substance at the same time Yeah, and actually and here's the weirdest thing but like like in the first Nolan Batman It was the Scarecrow and Ra's al Ghul And like they were those two are not notable Batman villains. I'm surprised that he did them Oh, no, it's great But I'm surprised that he did it that you think that you would want to open up with the ones people know You knew people yeah, but but then but then compare that to Superman's villains and you have like And Lex Luthor the ones that would work in a big-budget movie Designed for people who really aren't fans in the comics like this one Yeah Zod would work And Lex Lex Luthor is the number one that would work general Zod a distant number two doomsday And no, you wouldn't you wouldn't even been there at all. You know, like if you had to choose a third one, it'd be like Brainy, maybe yeah, but they already use brainiac in Green Lantern Was he in Green Lantern? Yeah Have you seen Green Lantern? No. Okay. Well, I watched it was shit It wasn't just miss skip this one. I basically know you're Ryan Reynolds. Yeah, it wasn't very good Yeah, Mark Strong was good at Sinestro, but well Sinestro wasn't a bad guy in that one was he he was he was like Oh, he wasn't because he's he's going to be later He was going to be but then it flopped so poorly that they decided not to make a sequel. Yeah, but I think If they could have had better better choices of actors if they'd have they kept Mark Strong and tried again Maybe yeah, he was good. He was very strong Well here here's the thing like you you've got like those three with with Zod and Brainiac being distant thirds to Lex Luthor and Lex Luthor just is not a compelling villain for Someone who is as powerful as Superman like for Superman to in my opinion to really work on the big screen and it didn't work By the way, but they did it before Yeah None of the Superman films have worked in my opinion None of the old ones not Superman Returns and not this one. They all have fundamental flaws The first one I would probably have to be the best of the worst then And no cuz he fucking turns he turns back time by going around the fucking earth. Okay, fine except for that part I think probably the best of the worst is the second one Yeah Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, of course because I have the original general Zod I was I was toting his horn earlier, but I think if you have if you're gonna make a Superman movie You only have two choices one you embrace the pure silliness of the comics like they did with the Avengers and Just just go fucking just way out there and wild and cross over fucking everything and just make a fucking crazy fucking serious or two you have to radically depower Superman Because he is too powerful to to make people give a shit Yeah, you know like if he's as powerful as he is and he's fighting Lex Luthor He can just like fart on Lex Luthor and pulverize him, you know So the only other option is to bring in somebody like general Zod who is also as power And then you get it and then it turns into like a dragon ball z-fest There's no kryptonite in the movie But that didn't bug me because kryptonite kryptonite came about because they needed to level the playing field between Superman and human enemies Yeah, so when Zod's are on you don't need kryptonite. They don't even mention it. That's why I don't even show it or anything I just thought was kind of weird. I Didn't miss it But like well then again, they already kind of have a kryptonite and I think of it because they had the atmosphere Yeah, I just weakened him down to a regular guy, right? Yeah But to make a good Superman movie you need to depower Superman Not to the like not to the point that a regular human could stand up to him but like to the point that You know, he would be physically grunting and straining to lift up a bus He could do it but it'd be like for us deadlifting like 300 pounds You know They go the third option together He would not be able to like fucking bash through 30 buildings with like Zod's face You just do the third option which is make him the villain Yeah, you can do that too. But then you have to like well, who's your hero? Well, then it has to be Lex or it has to be Batman and that turns into a bigger thing You know, it's fine if they did a very if they actually did something based on red Sun Which is I wouldn't I wouldn't know I think the best Superman story Ironically was the Dark Knight strike returns their returns It's Batman you've read it right Batman coming at a retirement 20 years later and Superman's a pawn of the government. Yeah, that is one of the best Superman stories Because he is the antagonist, but he doesn't want to be yeah But I think with it felt with with red Sun Because it made him a Soviet agent and just it was such a cool twist on the whole story and the ending of that Was just it was that was a huge twist. Like it was the ending whether I'm like I tell you I want you to read it I'm not gonna read it. So just tell me We'll edit it out. Okay Regarding Zod A good villain well-written not the actor for the job and He is part of a larger problem in Superman movies that if Superman is as powerful as he is Zod is the only villain that can actually be in the movie. Nobody else works without having something like Yeah, yeah and which makes Zod kind of get old, you know The only solution to make a good Superman movie is to depower Superman significantly Then you can actually have other people have a fighting chance against him. Yeah peep someone who is as powerful as him There's no inherent drama because you know, he's gonna get smashed through a concrete wall and come out fine You know, there are there are serious like Kingdom Come He is older and His powers aren't as strong anymore. So that's also something that's viable At least in Next while even if they've brought the same actor back. I didn't mind him. He was okay Yeah, he was good. Lois was good too. He looked the part. Yeah. I don't think she looked the part of Lois She didn't look it but she she's still a decent actress. Yeah, but he looked like super. Oh, yeah He looked sound and everything. Yeah, like the friggin barrel chest and everything. Yes And like he acted him. Well, he was written. Well, I think Superman has always it could be he's always been the Light side hero and he was like he's like the ultimate Boy Scout. Yeah, and he was in this Yeah, he was yeah, so I mean like there's a lot to improve on but I don't think without Fundamentally altering what this movie was it could have improved any more than they did, you know It was it was okay, but for it to be any better they would they would have had to gut and rework the entire thing You know, there was no quick fixes in this movie to make it better it's essentially It's it's it's the first two original Superman movies just kind of flung together There's no Lex Luthor though. That's the origin story plus Zod. Yeah, that's that's what I'm talking about Yeah, anyway, which makes sense because like Zod like if you're gonna have an origin story It makes sense to have Zod be the villain of the origin story because Zod is part of the origin Yeah, you know the fact that technically he is the fact that that was worked in was great. All right, okay but Yeah, I guess final final thoughts in this movie. Um, I'm gonna go see it again. So yeah And I'd I recommend seeing it but like Like you can't like with Star Trek go with a grain of salt yeah You can't expect a masterpiece. It's not here. This movie does not have it all together. It's a it's a popcorn movie again. Yeah Like it's just it's another case of those movies trying to capitalize on the massive success of Thematically similar movies with similar looking trailers and just failing at it. Yeah, they did not capture the exact matter. You you're not making Yeah, what wasn't yeah wasn't he like kind of like on the on the books to make a Dark Knight Returns movie I Think so, he was a guy that made Watchmen. Yeah, and what was good? It was good, but it was it was again one of those things where it was impossible to bring it across Perfectly. Yeah, or as close to perfectly as possible. We did a very good job He did a good job with what he had. He didn't do a good job here. I don't think Not really No, and I feel like Christopher Nolan's name was just kind of attached to it just to get fans of the Dark Knight series to Show up pretty much. Well, you had it. You had a hand in the original script everything, right? So yeah I wonder what did that look like cuz I'm sure it wasn't like this Yeah after this we'll talk about trailers dudes, you know, we're gonna trail it up we're gonna eat some trail mix So Dave tell me about these trailers that you're pulling in the back of your truck Dev wasn't there for a couple of the trailers. Yeah, I went to get some popcorn. You went to get popcorn You're late. It was like the same crap as last time We saw Pacific Rim. There was no GLaDOS voice in it, which is disappointing No, that wasn't that one. No one was new the other two. It was the snail car bullshit. Yeah turbo the Disney movie and I actually used to Disney movies and I think of it. What was it? I'm on Ranger again. What's the on Ranger? So I wasn't there for this one. Obviously the Lone Ranger. It was playing last time I'm big William tell over church. Did I did it? Did I did it? Did I did it? Yes, Kimo said Yeah, you know William tell overture is his theme song from the year, you know from the TV show and he had I don't recall the trailer though. He had an Indian guide friend. I don't recall the trailer. It was Johnny Depp playing playing tanto There's a guy who's like his brother gets killed and he swears revenge And I don't know if he gets like if he gets killed or horribly injured But I guess I think he gets injured, but he gets healed back like by the local natives And well, it's very clear that this trailer is of no fucking consequence No, it's not the movie looks because absolutely stupid because like I can't remember it after twice. Yeah But then they had that turbo which is a snail who gets nitro. Yeah, he gets he accidentally falls into a nitrous oxide tank and somehow it just comes like awesome like super fast and joins a team of super fast snails and who somehow Exist because they have like rockets And get this he enters NASCAR my two favorite things snails and horrible CG anthropomorphism and NASCAR and rednecks Well, that's part of the NASCAR And then and then I love my grandmother, but my god I do not understand her taste in that was that was there really only three trailers that was Pacific Rim And that was it wasn't that one more Pacific Rim Pacific Rim. I think was the last one There was one actually know there. I think there was one more that was Pacific Rim was shit out of the Owen man, okay, dude Our theater sucked like I don't mind it was packed and I don't mind sitting in the front row That's why it was awful, but there's people like the kids like laughing and screaming in the fucking thing Yeah, and they were talking. What can you do? Yeah, like their asses actually there was there was my big complaint was we're too close to scream because it Shit, I didn't mind it. It's degraded a lot. I like me boy. It was fuzzy man. It was that fuzzy But like none of the worse music usually you get the full effect the speakers We didn't which is a good thing in a bad thing It's it's good that we didn't get our ears blasted tonight is but yeah to the To the left a couple seats and then far back behind there was just this one woman who sounded middle-aged Just fucking squawking through the whole fucking movie Dad this is true. This is trailer talk Dave if something remarkable happens in the theater You have a duty to talk about like if a woman runs by and is naked would you talk about it on this deal? Oh, yeah, because it would be a naked woman in the middle of a theater But someone talking during a movie is nothing new But yeah, was that was that really the only trailer was that I think I thought there was one after Pacific Rim I can't remember. This is why you should write them down. I didn't think there was anything that past Pacific Rim because like this There's something like in between but really if it was really that of that. Yeah Like I can't remember it really can't I just I must have just blanked out Yeah, there's there's nothing coming out anymore this year like this year has had its load blown with Star Trek and No, there's there's okay. There's the hobbit right at the enders game. Oh, that's right enters game. Yeah, there are there Actually, there's a list. I was looking I'm stumbling. There's a list of sci-fi and fantasy movies. Well, yes specifically Isn't Pacific Rim coming out in July? Yes, it's like July I'm gonna go do that that one next for this this little thing. We got time.
