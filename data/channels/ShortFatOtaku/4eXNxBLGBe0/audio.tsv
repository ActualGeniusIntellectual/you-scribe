0	3140	Dave the hipster here to talk about artsy fucking movies
6140	10880	We're on our we're just about to catch the bus the autobus to see a man of steel
11400	13400	Neither of us really know much about it
13680	19120	I've heard some pretty bad things about it to be honest. Yeah, so I'm not going into this with open arms
19240	24520	I'm not gonna lie. I'm not a huge Superman fan. I liked Smallville. I really like really like Smallville
24520	28640	I like to do a degree. I like Lois and Clark more. Yep. Yeah, that was a much better show
29080	34840	You know what? I liked what that one Superman cartoon where he beat up Japanese people because it was made in like the 1930s
37400	44860	Everyone did it back then. Okay, all the superheroes the job. All right. Well anyways, even Bugs Bunny did it. Yeah, that's true
45920	52000	And yeah, Donald Duck became a Nazi. Yeah. Anyways, that's that's completely off the beaten track there. Please don't suck
52880	58000	Please don't be garbage. I know it'll be a good popcorn movie. At least you think so most likely
58000	65480	It's gonna be all flash and cash but all flash. No cash. Is that is that a saying? I think so. I'd like to say it
66360	68360	Um, I don't know
68800	70800	Mmm, I
70960	75200	Haven't liked any of the other Superman movies. I haven't seen Superman Returns
75920	81040	So I like the original Superman movie Superman's hard to make a movie for like I was yeah
81040	86100	I was saying this earlier upstairs like Batman has a bunch of really good villains Superman doesn't know
86900	91740	Superman's villains are not rooted in bleh in like cultural lexicon
92700	94700	Funny she said lexicon
95740	101820	Yeah, but like everyone even non comic book readers know who Batman and the Joker are yeah, you know
101860	106940	Yeah, I've heard of Lex Luthor. They've heard of him, but he's not as ubiquitous as the Joker
106940	109780	No, because he's not he's he's just a guy. He's just
110300	114200	Manipulative he's a demon and cruel but he's not he's not like psychotic
114200	120280	Yeah, but I mean even even beyond that like everyone knows most of Batman's villains. Yeah, they do Batman's villains
120360	124780	They're just they're just more interesting to begin with because they're yeah, they all seem like splinters of his of his
125200	131440	Psyche from when he was, you know, horribly scarred. I wouldn't go quite that far. That's a fan theory
132720	134720	Superman I mean when it comes down to it
135640	141080	Superman's you know his parents didn't die. His parents got old. That's it. No his parents died of old age
141600	143600	No, his real parents died
144080	150040	Okay-dotted and then his other parents died of old age actually the story goes that his his father is adopted father
150040	154680	Jonathan supposed to died of a heart attack. He was like a teenager. That's not how it went though
155080	159440	So it's on the movies in most stories of that Superman's in
159960	165160	He's still kind of old and around and just like an old man out in the farm. There's different there's different ones, right?
165160	171040	I mean you can say this is Candace's Canada, but like whatever it's not really that's not so much an important thing
171160	174160	The thing is is Superman himself makes a good bill
175160	180240	This isn't gonna be a movie about that though, but it's not so that's why I'm not really holding out for yeah
180240	185080	But that that's you. I like you know, I like Zod though. Yeah, I hope this Zod is okay
185080	190240	if there's gonna be if there's gonna be a villain in a Superman movie if it's not Lex and
191560	193560	Yeah, there is cuz
194120	199620	It doesn't make sense for it to be anybody else no Zod was the quintessential
200420	202420	Superman but you know what?
202620	205540	This before we before you take off I'm gonna say one more thing
205540	210940	This seems like it's gonna have this the Star Trek syndrome of the last movie we watched probably where it'll be like police
210940	212180	We know it's odd they have yeah
212180	217900	They have con in there just because it's con and cuz they and cuz they want to capitalize on the sequel on that trend
217900	222000	That movies are going with now. They're gonna go with they're gonna go with Zod to do the exact same thing
222340	224340	It's gonna feel the same I bet
224420	227520	This time I agree with you. So let's let's go the movie
230580	235100	Before crappy movie. Yes. I would have to actually use that line Neil
241740	247260	Hey guys, we just got back from watching Man of Steel. Yeah, as you can tell it's night out
248100	253180	We're still on our back porch. Just it's night. This is a Porsche or a deck deck. It's a deck. Yeah
253860	260060	Yeah, what's the what's that because they're made of wood and they're both have banisters and you can usually fit chairs on them
260060	264500	So what's like what how does it go from deck to porch? What's the size difference?
267820	269820	And
271540	273540	What do you think of it would you think of that seal I
274140	279260	Have very mixed feelings about it. Do you um, let me see now. I mix them with
280180	282180	Yes
282980	290200	Alternative blend man. Okay, honestly, I thought overall it was okay
291620	295340	It wasn't as impressive as I found Star Trek. I
296780	298780	Found that
299060	303600	I'm just gonna start off with the thing. I don't like the lowest. Okay, it's all right, by the way spoilers
303600	306720	Yeah, well knows odds in it Cumberbatch was odd. I
306720	313560	Don't even I don't even know who plays odd. I can't remember why I camera his name, but I didn't like him
313560	318120	I honestly I thought he was kind of over he over acted a lot
318640	321680	and I want to get this out of the way right now just
322360	325240	Just what happened in my mind and has nothing to do it with anything in the movie
325240	330120	Well, it does but it's not a big critique. Okay, but remember how there was the scene where Zod's like like
331400	333400	Zod
333480	335800	Lands on earth and he has his helmet off and he's like
336080	339920	He's like looking at his arm and he finally gets his senses in order, you know
339920	343160	It zooms in really close in his face. He gets the same powers of Superman
343160	346100	Yeah, but it zooms in really close in his face and he's like I finally yeah
346100	349800	I finally have my senses in order I can control his senses
349800	352320	Yeah, there's they left a giant zit on his nose
352320	354420	And it was just like yeah
354420	358480	They took up like one eight to the screen just this giant zit cuz they zoomed in so close and I was like
358480	360480	Did you notice that? Yeah
361280	363280	Fucking makeup fail
363400	368040	Well, I think I'd actually made sense. I think leaving it in made sense cuz I mean he
369160	371880	He's stressing out and he he was just dirty at that point
375880	379220	I mean, I like the realism and in the giant Zod zit
379640	382720	But every the rest of the movie, yeah, but the rest of them was just not
382720	385760	I think I saw two scenes with him in there that were actually
386280	388680	Actually, okay to good
389880	392680	He had some good lines though. Like he had that the one where
393920	397120	He was talking to like a computer program of Superman's dad
398240	401080	Jor-el played by Russell Crowe. Yeah, he was he was like
401600	407160	Yeah, he was talking to it to Jor-el and he's and Jor-el is like you can't you can't kill everyone
407160	411880	He's like I'm arguing the merits of genocide with a ghost. Yeah, that was kind of funny
411880	417000	There was actually a couple laughs and then and then when he says like where did you train on a farm? Yeah
417880	423000	There and yeah, there were some good he had a he had a few decent lines
423000	428760	They weren't like other characters in the movie like overly funny though where like the girl said I just think Superman's kind of hot
429160	431920	Yeah, there were some goofy lines that made me chuckle
431920	436000	There was a few but that was another thing about the movie. I found that
436520	440680	Wasn't quite as endearing was that it took its way too seriously. Mmm. It was just
441200	447800	So over-the-top and I mean it is Superman and Superman has a certain flexibility and being over-the-top
449320	453480	However, you can't make a realistic world and then
454020	459200	Do what they did with it there and expect people to take it seriously. Yeah, like it was Dragon Ball Z fights
459200	461560	It was like smashing people through fucking the earth
462200	465240	Welcome to earth. Welcome to going through the entire earth
466120	467480	Great
467480	471680	Smashing people through buildings and shit and like, you know speaking of that
472960	476960	Like that final fight between Zod and Superman. Mm-hmm. Okay, so Superman
477760	481680	Okay at the end of the movie Superman kills Zod and others
482120	485920	He kills Zod and then he's like overcome by a grief that he had to kill somebody
486360	491360	Like in his fight with Zod, they're like smashing each other through fucking
492020	499040	Skyscrapers and they're just collapsing on to each other and like in that fight. They have killed millions of people
501400	508480	At least thousands like they're throwing around fucking oil tankers that explode and like helicopters are falling out of the fucking sky like
508720	511240	super like the collateral damage to both
511920	513360	lives and
513360	517480	Stuff. Yeah, it's Superman directly causes in his fight with Zod. There's
518080	520080	catastrophic really not that much
520560	522560	emphasis on evacuation efforts
522600	526680	No so much because you think that like everyone's fucking just yeah
526680	531260	Cuz you see like three three people from the Daily Planet including Perry White just running away
531640	537160	Yeah, and that guy's running from the building as they're building slowly collapses on top of them. Yeah, you know, it's and like
538200	540760	Pretty evident. There's no there's no real warning there
540760	540920	No
540920	542440	and like the final
542440	548200	That the final plan is odd is to like terraform the earth with this giant beam that goes through the center of the earth's core
548200	550200	That was pretty cool. Actually, I like that. It was kind of neat
550360	554720	Like the way they were like lifting up the gravity that gravity was like lifting shit and smashing it down again
554720	557200	Because it was slowly increasing. Yeah each time because they're
558000	562160	It's like drinkable see it's like a hundred tons of gravity. Yeah, and that was neat
562160	566080	That was neat to see but like fucking everybody died
566680	570600	Like there were no survivors of this fucking movie or there shouldn't have been
571440	578920	Dude there's survivors that much fucking destruction like how many people the other side of camera just died the other side
579560	584560	Wasn't so bad, but metropolis the core metropolis. There were probably thousands of casualties. Yeah
584560	590600	Yeah, like like and like how many were mentioned military how many were like directly by superman like when Superman gets pissed off
590600	593080	He's like don't talk about my mom like that
593400	598440	And I was like your mom and then Superman just tackles them and then they fly through 30 buildings
598560	600720	He killed people. All right. All right. All right
601360	606620	So I think we're getting up too much in his semantics here. I'd like to talk a little bit more bigger picture
606620	608360	Here's where I'm going with this
608360	615740	Okay, Superman cries at the end cuz he killed Zod. He has killed millions before the inadvertently though
616320	620000	This is the first person he's killed directly
621040	627800	So also I did like at the ends odds like James Bond esque fucking laser like getting closer to the families
628440	630440	I
637320	643440	Think the plot was very disjointed it just kept going back. I swear to God it felt like a fucking absolute loss
643440	644920	I didn't mind the flashbacks
644920	651600	I didn't mind the fact that we would go back and like see but they just bring on these elements and they wouldn't explain them
651600	655940	I like the fact that that we would go back and see Superman's
656780	663780	Childhood because it was it was an origin story that made sense. Yeah, we went back and saw his childhood it that aspect
663780	666300	I was fine with I just I thought it was kind of weird
666300	671980	They started off with him being an adult and working on a fucking fishing but Batman did that
672700	678400	In Batman Begins like it starts with him as an adult in the Chinese prison and it shows his childhood. Yeah. Yeah
679020	683540	It's the same thing. I think they handled it better though. Yeah. Yeah, I mean a little bit my dad
683540	687340	I mean and and and they showed they showed in the movie that Canadians are real jerks. Yeah
688340	695300	Apparently if you're getting into their assholes, you're a good-looking guy from from America automatically. We hate you
695300	697500	Yeah, so we'll just get into bar fights with you in Nova Scotia
697500	704580	Although that was another part that was funny though what he does this guy who started beating. I think that's a good a
705220	707380	Good take on the fortress of solitude
708260	710260	The fact that it was like a 20,000 year old
710860	714780	Derelict kryptonian ship just frozen in the ice it does that was me
714780	719020	It is a lot more convenient instead of him just standing where they're there with a heat rate
720420	722500	He did burrow his way in though
723820	726660	Yeah, like to get into this ship
726660	731880	He did he fucking tunneled through the ice with his heat vision but like the fortress of solitude originally wasn't like like something that
731880	733380	He built himself
734380	736380	Hang out as a natural ice
736700	740740	But like he kind of like sculpted it with his yeah with his super powers
740740	745820	He did but like in this one. It is a frozen ship. Yeah, which is I think in a neat like
746460	748820	I'm not a purist. I like when
749380	755260	Franchises they if you're gonna remake a franchise do something new with it put a different spin on it
755260	762260	I'm okay with that and with the fortress of solitude making it into a derelict kryptonian ship made sense. I think it was cool
763420	768420	That was the only thing I really thought was cool this movie one part that kind of rankled with me as well was they
769220	771220	they introduced
771260	773260	like they introduced
773700	779220	Superman as Clark Kent to Lois Lane really fast like she found out so fast. Yeah, that's because
782180	787060	Superman was never he never really called himself Superman. He wasn't he was never really a superhero in this
788500	790500	You know she was gonna start calling
790980	792980	Well, I don't think you own what she was
793180	800100	Like even when he is in the Superman costume. He's called Clark Kent or Kal-el
800260	803420	Yeah, I should call him Cal. Yeah, they call him. They just call him Cal
803460	807100	Yeah, like he's either one of the other they don't call him anything else
807580	814580	When using the costume like she goes to say what why doesn't the s stand for soup and it just kind of stops
814580	818620	Yeah, like she's interrupted and like that. It's not an ass. Yeah
819460	824500	That is another thing like I like the art direction in this I liked how there was like the floating like like
824660	827980	Balls that turn into faces. Yeah, I was like a organic metal
827980	834780	Yeah, that was really cool. And I liked how they explained the Superman symbol like just being random ass fucking symbols for every house
835860	839540	Yeah, they even know I had like the same the same thing like this
839820	845300	But it was like the same very the same the same emerald shape but had like a different symbol on it
845500	849020	Everyone had like a different some yeah, they did and she just happened to look like an ass
849660	851660	Yeah, and that's why we need
851940	857180	What I don't like though is how like when he's exploring the ship and his dad's like, by the way
857180	860540	Here's your suit and it's just like here's here's the Superman suit
860540	864700	Oh, yeah, if I'm gonna draw a parallel between this and anything else. I just read
866580	872500	Superman earth one graphic novel and it's takes place when Clark is 20 and
873180	875980	He's been to junior college he's off to metropolis
875980	881260	He's trying to find a job and his landlady says, you know, you should go get more education
881260	888500	It's like I'm okay goes he tries over a football team just creams them goes and goes and solves. It is an incredibly
888900	890020	intense
890020	892020	equation with drawing
893460	895620	Electrician salt water or something like that and
896220	901700	Then he goes and he becomes like this massively successful stockbroker because he's so intelligent, right?
902820	909140	Wasn't that like that was something they retcon that like Superman like in at least in modern comics only really has average
909460	912020	Intelligence that he can't keep up to Batman in terms of intelligence
912580	916860	That was a thing they made they did like Batman is like the smartest motherfucker in the universe
916860	922420	Well, the thing also a Superman is he can meet people's minds. So he might be a can he is he could even he can hear?
922420	923860	people's thoughts Oh
923860	925580	can he
925580	928540	He yes, he can you couldn't in this movie?
928540	933420	Yes, he could when he's when he's in the closet and the other kids like oh what a freak. He's hearing them talk
934580	940420	He's not hearing that. He's not hearing their thoughts. He's hearing them talk through the wall. He has super sensitive hearing
940900	943580	Superman can hear every what everyone's saying also
943580	944740	I don't know one point you can read mine
944740	948060	I'm sure there's like a new duration of Superman where he has the power to read minds
948060	955740	But I think commonly Superman's powers have always been like super super senses. Yeah, the super senses the flying the strength
956420	957860	The
957860	961300	Invulnerability. I don't think there was a healing factor just invulnerability
961940	964820	He had no idea. He doesn't have a healing factor because when he's on
965460	967820	The ship he is attacked. Yeah
968700	972960	Like scout ship he gets attacked and he's got a cut and he still got it. Yeah
973460	974820	It takes time to heal
974820	981500	Well, then like there is an in the Dark Knight Returns Superman has a healing factor based on just how much sunlight he gets
981500	988020	Cuz he gets hit directly with a nuke in that comic and he's like a fucking just like like near-death like cripple skeleton
988020	990020	He's like, ah, and then he just gets into the center
991460	993460	This comes back
997580	1001540	Yeah, I there's there's a definitely some
1002340	1004340	Yeah with this movie. I
1004900	1010460	Didn't mind the flashbacks. I like Kevin Costner. He was good. He was good as I thought
1010980	1015140	Between him and Russell Crowe. They were the best people the best characters in the movie
1015140	1021540	Yeah, they both did they had enough lines to make an impact to have wait, but they didn't eclipse anyone else
1021540	1026340	Yeah, they were both. They're just good. There's like you're just like character acting. Yes. They were both good in this movie
1026580	1030500	They're both different kinds of dads entirely. Yeah, but like with
1031820	1033620	with
1033620	1035620	Jonathan Kent
1035620	1038380	Like the one thing I didn't like about him
1038380	1040220	Was
1040220	1047380	How he was like he wanted Superman to hide his powers to the point of letting people die
1047980	1049460	including himself
1049460	1055700	Yeah spoilers. Yeah, like I don't think that's something that Jonathan Kent would do like
1056660	1063260	Like Superman like the fucking bus bus crashes into the lake and Superman's like what should I shave is let them drown?
1063260	1065020	He's like, I don't know
1065020	1069780	You know, like, you know, I think what he's implying is that he should have saved them anyways
1069780	1073180	But he should have been more careful about instead of lifting the bus directly on the water
1073180	1075140	He should just you know
1075140	1078340	Like just kind of threw them up in the surface cuz he's got the strength to do it
1078380	1081780	Yeah, just grab that, you know everyone cuz he would have had enough time. Mm-hmm
1082180	1083700	It wouldn't have taken that long
1083700	1087060	He could have done and then just like and then just like oh man, I just say yeah
1087060	1092060	Um, you know what I say to you. I'm a good swimmer. Yeah, but I mean it just seemed
1092820	1096220	Maybe you took that from that. I didn't take that from that for me to me
1096220	1100500	It seemed like Jonathan Kent was actually advocating letting the kids die or at least
1100940	1104900	considering the possibility of letting everyone in the bus died to tell it so that so that
1105420	1111820	Clark can just go on without being discovered which is not very much like also like kind of a weird version of Uncle Ben
1112100	1119100	Yeah, well his death was was very Uncle Ben esque like, you know, yeah
1120100	1127140	Man could have like saved him immediately without even breaking a sweat and he looks at him. Yeah. Yeah, he's standing there
1127460	1131620	He's standing there like in the middle of this fucking in like the eye of a tornado and he's just like no
1131620	1137940	He's not even the eyes of the outskirts. No, wait, he's standing there in the middle of this fucking tornado and he just goes no
1138580	1140580	It's like don't worry about he just goes
1141380	1148140	God, yeah. Yeah, he goes back to save a fucking dog. Yeah a dog. Yeah that dies to save a dog
1148140	1153620	Yeah, that's not right. I was stupid. Yeah, if you went back to save a human I could see it but a dog
1153620	1158220	Yeah, I like what yeah, but really don't sacrifice your life to save a fucking dog. Yeah, I
1160220	1161820	That
1161820	1166900	Like I didn't buy that Jonathan Kent was so committed to
1167540	1175820	Not revealing his son's identity that he would say no, let's have people die. Well, I didn't buy that it wasn't he was anti
1176820	1182100	Revelation he was he was against him showing himself at the improper time when he wasn't already
1182100	1186060	I mean if you notice he said I'm 33. Mm-hmm. It's like a whole Jesus thing
1186580	1192600	They were drawing parallels to Jesus. Well, of course, I mean remember when he like he floated out into space and he's like
1197100	1201540	There is a Christian bent to the movie, yeah, there really is I mean he even goes and talks to a priest
1201540	1203540	And here's the problem with being 33
1204180	1209320	Like he's 33. He discovers the he discovers the the fortress of solitude. He talks to his dad
1209320	1212600	He gets the suit and he's like you need to train your powers and become strong
1212600	1216400	It's like okay, so he starts like jumping around in the Arctic and I'm like
1217620	1221540	If you're 33 and you're a kid and you're lifting buses out of the fucking ocean
1222500	1229820	Yeah, he's already got the potential to do like no. No, like you're only now testing the limits of your abilities
1230820	1237340	Yeah, like he was flying and like he's like yeah, this is awesome man, I can fly and you're 33
1237340	1239300	Oh don't explain it
1239300	1245340	Don't you think you would have like looked into that shit earlier if you knew you had all these big stage explain
1245580	1250500	Actually, and like I'm not in the movie, but they explained in the one comic I read this isn't the fucking comics Dave
1250500	1257780	No, but it does make sense the material that it is. It's a Kryptonian material that cannot be burnt or ripped or
1258780	1264740	Melted by conventional earth means therefore. It's the only thing he can wear in order to fly
1264740	1269320	Otherwise, it would just get torn off. So he just will end up in the middle of nowhere bare-ass naked
1270420	1274900	Okay fair enough, but do you think a ten-year-old who has crazy amounts of superpowers?
1275060	1279460	He couldn't fly until he would though would try it even in the original movie
1279460	1285620	He still didn't start like flying until he was 33. No. No, he was he was in his teens
1285620	1291980	Okay, so he's in his teens and he goes to try to fly and he flies and rips his clothes off and goes
1291980	1298820	Oh, well, I'm naked. But now I know I can fly. No. No in this movie. He doesn't even try it to lose three like that
1299900	1300980	Doesn't make sense to me
1300980	1309180	He should have tested the boundaries of his abilities before his his real dad comes along because because there's a scene where he's
1309660	1313860	going from a fishing boat to the top of a oil rig and
1314740	1319900	In like two seconds, so he has to have jumped he has to have some notion that he can do it
1320020	1324820	Yeah, it's just that he hasn't but to really push himself right, but the fact that he is
1325540	1327260	Like elated
1327260	1331220	It's obvious that that moment in the movie was his first time flying
1331220	1333180	It is they make it clear by the way
1333180	1334480	He's reacting by the way
1334480	1338780	He but by the way, he's he's doing it is his first time flying and I don't buy that
1338780	1342220	I think you would have tried it if you were when you were younger, it's half-baked
1342900	1349900	That's the whole movies half-baked that's what exactly I was gonna say the whole movie is half is it's it's half-assed
1350620	1356500	It's got good action scenes. It's got ridiculous action. See it's got well, they're well-made
1357380	1360780	Special effects was I wasn't I wasn't worried about that. I was worried about the plot
1360780	1361900	I mean about characterization
1361900	1367260	Here's the problem like you can go in and like go down the list of things that are good in a movie and you can
1367260	1371460	Tick off special effects, but like does that really mean anything anymore having good special effects?
1373220	1375380	It's a summer action not a blockbuster
1375380	1382340	It's a summer action blockbuster it having great special effects, which it does it comes on. It does not give it any full facts
1382340	1384560	It's not really the CG so much as the makeup
1386100	1387940	Yeah, it's consistency
1387940	1393940	Yeah, and I mean what it comes down the art direction the art direction in this movie was great the costuming the the looks of
1394420	1398620	Like Krypton. Oh speaking of Krypton. How is he like he's like
1398620	1400460	I
1400460	1402660	Russell Crowe someone's fucking a tree
1403980	1406100	you mean Falkor and like
1407260	1414420	Goes on this fucking chase scene. Yeah, like fucking like space helicopters after him. That was a bit much one with nature
1415820	1419380	You like he's like a world of Warcraft hunter who like blows
1420180	1423820	Like blows his whistle and like his pet appears. He just flies away bro. Let's go
1424100	1426100	Epic
1427780	1430200	Yeah, it was pretty far-fetched so
1431140	1433760	Yeah, they also they developed Zod's
1434540	1442140	Female right-hand woman there a lot to Easton amount one thing that bothered me about her was she was in there in there in Superman
1442140	1446880	Too anyway, wasn't she? Yeah, she had he had two people. Yeah. The one thing that bothered me about her
1447140	1449140	It wasn't like a huge thing, but
1449140	1454180	She gets hit so much and then she gets a missile she catches a missile and that knocks her out
1457060	1459140	Well, it was a pretty big missile
1459740	1465980	Still I mean Dave Dave, she took a hell of a life give any woman a meat missile and she will get knocked out
1469020	1476820	No, no, like I I I I bought that because the missile seemed much more destructive than even like a kryptonian punch
1479180	1482500	All right, well that was the only thing that really rankle with me
1482500	1488900	But I mean like yeah the destructiveness of those fight scenes between like Superman Zod Superman and all the other kryptonians
1488900	1492380	They're like smashing concrete. Yeah, they're blowing up I hops
1493300	1499860	Honestly, if I'm gonna say anything about a recommendation like I'm I'm gonna go see it again. Are you yes
1499860	1501860	I'm gonna go see it again and
1502420	1504140	it's
1504140	1505820	well
1505860	1511740	This time I'm gonna I'm gonna try to look at it more objectively. Mm-hmm, and hopefully I'll like it more
1512340	1516980	I'm not I'm not just I'm going with other people. So yeah, but I mean like oh
1517620	1519620	Yes, we can have the I hops
1520100	1524440	Pete dude, there's so much product placement like the no key. She like
1525100	1529700	He and I hop that was pretty much she's climbing up like the side of this of this ledge or something
1529700	1534900	She's like she she puts her fucking camera. She puts her camera on ledges like oh, oh fuck
1534900	1536900	She's like catches her breath
1538500	1543260	And the whole time is just like on the Nokia just filling the screen or
1544820	1546820	Or the I hope yeah
1548340	1550340	Funny though like
1550660	1554900	Pete I'm the manager of I hope yeah, he's just like I'm working on I hope that's like, okay
1554900	1557900	And but then like they come back to the I hop and like destroy it in a fight
1557980	1562180	Yeah, and then Superman looks at Pete Pete looks at Superman like I know you
1562900	1564900	So you're having a fight in my eye
1566100	1571900	There are like kind of buddies, I think it was implied they're like sort of like the closest thing of friends that
1572700	1578560	Superman had yeah, and in the in Smallville, they are friends like which is like actually yeah, like how come
1579500	1583180	It they didn't really show like Lana Lang being friends of them or anything
1584140	1589560	What I think they just want to throw it in as a you want to make him a loner in this one, basically
1589760	1595400	Yeah, I mean let's because if he wanders in his baby he finds that the ship like he is a loner
1595400	1600260	And I don't think they really want to spend much time on building another romantic angle. They just wanted those
1601080	1603960	yeah, because I mean, I mean Lana for anyone who's
1604760	1607800	Any somewhat super fan worth their salt? They're not gonna they're not gonna
1609000	1612880	Deny that Lana Lang was a presence in his in his youth. Mm-hmm
1613880	1618900	Yeah, but I mean, yeah, I think they just wanted to build up as a loner like yeah
1619620	1626180	This this entire movie is about Superman being alone and then discovering who he is. Yeah, it's the opposite of Smallville Smallville
1626180	1631460	Like he's got Lex as a buddy. He's got Pete as a buddy. He's got the Chloe chick. He's got Lana
1633020	1638380	Eventually Lois. Yeah later on. Yeah, so it is it's very much kind of the
1638980	1644660	The same old crap that we you know, the same thing we were talking about before. Yeah, it's like it's just the same sort of
1645340	1650340	You know the lone wolf going against the chaotic that the engine of chaos you yeah, yeah, definitely
1650860	1655100	You mentioned before Zod and I'm talking about Zod a bit. Here's the thing. I
1655980	1663660	Went into this thinking I'd be disappointed by him and I wasn't I wasn't I think he's a good actor and
1664340	1669780	Zod's a great character and they wrote Zod well and how Zod looked was great
1669860	1674060	But this guy was not the guy to play Zod. No, he wasn't I I
1675140	1676900	like to be like
1676900	1678900	Nationalist, but I think a British guy should play
1679700	1684180	Cumberbatch, no, no, no, no, but I mean
1685020	1691180	Those are big shoes to fill. That's Terrence stamp. Mm-hmm. That guy was that guy was like he if they didn't do a kneel
1692060	1696220	Didn't do kneel before Zod. No, they didn't even some other shit. They did
1696820	1699000	This is Krypton. Yeah
1700300	1704500	And they did I will find him which is from doing if you saw doing
1705460	1711220	And I do and barely I've watched the miniseries and we watch all day the actual movie because it was really fucking long
1711220	1713540	Yeah, dude, and it has staying in it. So
1717580	1720280	Anyways, but no with the Zod like
1720980	1727460	He's a good actor and like the lines they wrote for him were all great lines and how he looked I was all of them
1727460	1732300	But but his delivery was was but he was not the guy to play Zod
1732460	1738500	Otherwise everything and everything involving Zod was pretty, you know, I think part of it was to he had a speech at Benjamin did he?
1738500	1741700	Yeah, I couldn't tell. Yes. Yeah, it sounded like it was like
1743460	1746740	Like his asses or something it's something there's something weird about the way he spoke
1747060	1751620	Yeah, it's I didn't speech at Benjamin. I didn't even notice or I could tell I could hear the whole way through
1751980	1756460	It was really and it was really getting on me. I was like, what the hell is that?
1756580	1761460	There's something about him despite the fact that he's American or I think he was American, you know
1761460	1765020	I don't even look up the actor might even Canadian might have been who knows what have been English
1765060	1770460	Yeah, but the fact that he was using American or a new American classic kind of accent
1770660	1773260	But he had something weird about his voice. Yeah
1774340	1779020	Well here here like I said before that Batman's Batman's and villains
1779700	1781140	They're more
1781140	1786200	Notable in common society. It's like like you have the Joker everyone knows who the Joker is. You've got
1787080	1793480	The you know Catwoman everyone knows who that woman is you have even bane to to a limited extent everyone knows who things
1793960	1797800	Everyone everyone knows who the Riddler. Yeah, everyone knows they have
1799040	1801520	That's more flash and more substance at the same time
1801520	1806540	Yeah, and actually and here's the weirdest thing but like like in the first Nolan Batman
1806540	1808640	It was the Scarecrow and Ra's al Ghul
1809520	1815220	And like they were those two are not notable Batman villains. I'm surprised that he did them
1817200	1818560	Oh, no, it's great
1818560	1824520	But I'm surprised that he did it that you think that you would want to open up with the ones people know
1826040	1831840	You knew people yeah, but but then but then compare that to Superman's villains and you have
1832880	1834680	like
1834680	1839040	And Lex Luthor the ones that would work in a big-budget movie
1839520	1845360	Designed for people who really aren't fans in the comics like this one
1845360	1846760	Yeah
1846760	1848320	Zod would work
1848320	1854620	And Lex Lex Luthor is the number one that would work general Zod a distant number two doomsday
1854620	1860520	And no, you wouldn't you wouldn't even been there at all. You know, like if you had to choose a third one, it'd be like
1861240	1864880	Brainy, maybe yeah, but they already use brainiac in Green Lantern
1865440	1867440	Was he in Green Lantern? Yeah
1868800	1872440	Have you seen Green Lantern? No. Okay. Well, I watched it was shit
1872680	1878160	It wasn't just miss skip this one. I basically know you're Ryan Reynolds. Yeah, it wasn't very good
1878160	1883960	Yeah, Mark Strong was good at Sinestro, but well Sinestro wasn't a bad guy in that one was he he was he was like
1883960	1885880	Oh, he wasn't because he's he's going to be later
1885880	1891580	He was going to be but then it flopped so poorly that they decided not to make a sequel. Yeah, but I think
1892520	1899080	If they could have had better better choices of actors if they'd have they kept Mark Strong and tried again
1899520	1902600	Maybe yeah, he was good. He was very strong
1905160	1909680	Well here here's the thing like you you've got like those three with with
1910160	1916600	Zod and Brainiac being distant thirds to Lex Luthor and Lex Luthor just is not a compelling villain for
1917380	1923760	Someone who is as powerful as Superman like for Superman to in my opinion to really work on the big screen and it didn't work
1923760	1925760	By the way, but they did it before
1926520	1927520	Yeah
1927520	1930700	None of the Superman films have worked in my opinion
1930800	1936520	None of the old ones not Superman Returns and not this one. They all have fundamental flaws
1937080	1940540	The first one I would probably have to be the best of the worst then
1941200	1947480	And no cuz he fucking turns he turns back time by going around the fucking earth. Okay, fine except for that part
1947480	1950520	I think probably the best of the worst is the second one
1950520	1952520	Yeah
1952600	1957080	Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, of course because I have the original general Zod
1957080	1962480	I was I was toting his horn earlier, but I think if you have if you're gonna make a
1963320	1964680	Superman movie
1964680	1966480	You only have two choices
1966480	1972120	one you embrace the pure silliness of the comics like they did with the Avengers and
1973120	1980160	Just just go fucking just way out there and wild and cross over fucking everything and just make a fucking crazy
1980800	1982800	fucking serious or two
1983560	1985560	you have to
1985760	1987760	radically depower Superman
1988940	1994240	Because he is too powerful to to make people give a shit
1994240	1999840	Yeah, you know like if he's as powerful as he is and he's fighting Lex Luthor
1999880	2004020	He can just like fart on Lex Luthor and pulverize him, you know
2004400	2008720	So the only other option is to bring in somebody like general Zod who is also as power
2008720	2011560	And then you get it and then it turns into like a dragon ball z-fest
2017080	2018760	There's no kryptonite in the movie
2018760	2026160	But that didn't bug me because kryptonite kryptonite came about because they needed to level the playing field between Superman and human enemies
2027160	2033320	Yeah, so when Zod's are on you don't need kryptonite. They don't even mention it. That's why I don't even show it or anything
2033320	2035320	I just thought was kind of weird. I
2035680	2037040	Didn't miss it
2037040	2042620	But like well then again, they already kind of have a kryptonite and I think of it because they had the atmosphere
2042620	2045920	Yeah, I just weakened him down to a regular guy, right? Yeah
2046640	2050760	But to make a good Superman movie you need to depower Superman
2051080	2054960	Not to the like not to the point that a regular human could stand up to him
2055560	2057560	but like to the point that
2058360	2062400	You know, he would be physically grunting and straining to lift up a bus
2062720	2066560	He could do it but it'd be like for us deadlifting like 300 pounds
2067040	2068120	You know
2068120	2070360	They go the third option together
2070360	2075000	He would not be able to like fucking bash through 30 buildings with like Zod's face
2075000	2077840	You just do the third option which is make him the villain
2078320	2081600	Yeah, you can do that too. But then you have to like well, who's your hero?
2081720	2085840	Well, then it has to be Lex or it has to be Batman and that turns into a bigger thing
2085840	2092040	You know, it's fine if they did a very if they actually did something based on red Sun
2092840	2097960	Which is I wouldn't I wouldn't know I think the best Superman story
2098960	2103220	Ironically was the Dark Knight strike returns their returns
2105640	2107640	It's Batman you've read it right
2108640	2114640	Batman coming at a retirement 20 years later and Superman's a pawn of the government. Yeah, that is one of the best Superman stories
2115680	2119480	Because he is the antagonist, but he doesn't want to be yeah
2119560	2123220	But I think with it felt with with red Sun
2124280	2131560	Because it made him a Soviet agent and just it was such a cool twist on the whole story and the ending of that
2131960	2137920	Was just it was that was a huge twist. Like it was the ending whether I'm like I tell you I want you to read it
2137920	2139920	I'm not gonna read it. So just tell me
2140400	2142400	We'll edit it out. Okay
2144880	2146880	Regarding Zod
2147880	2152480	A good villain well-written not the actor for the job and
2153880	2160120	He is part of a larger problem in Superman movies that if Superman is as powerful as he is
2160680	2166880	Zod is the only villain that can actually be in the movie. Nobody else works without having something like
2168520	2172640	Yeah, yeah and which makes Zod kind of get old, you know
2172640	2176840	The only solution to make a good Superman movie is to depower Superman significantly
2176960	2183000	Then you can actually have other people have a fighting chance against him. Yeah peep someone who is as powerful as him
2183000	2187820	There's no inherent drama because you know, he's gonna get smashed through a concrete wall and come out fine
2188280	2190920	You know, there are there are serious like Kingdom Come
2192720	2194720	He is older and
2195240	2199880	His powers aren't as strong anymore. So that's also something that's viable
2200760	2202560	At least in
2202560	2206200	Next while even if they've brought the same actor back. I didn't mind him. He was okay
2206200	2211760	Yeah, he was good. Lois was good too. He looked the part. Yeah. I don't think she looked the part of Lois
2211760	2217040	She didn't look it but she she's still a decent actress. Yeah, but he looked like super. Oh, yeah
2217040	2221320	He looked sound and everything. Yeah, like the friggin barrel chest and everything. Yes
2221960	2228760	And like he acted him. Well, he was written. Well, I think Superman has always it could be he's always been the
2229240	2235800	Light side hero and he was like he's like the ultimate Boy Scout. Yeah, and he was in this
2235960	2243080	Yeah, he was yeah, so I mean like there's a lot to improve on but I don't think without
2243480	2248240	Fundamentally altering what this movie was it could have improved any more than they did, you know
2248920	2255860	It was it was okay, but for it to be any better they would they would have had to gut and rework the entire thing
2256620	2260300	You know, there was no quick fixes in this movie to make it better it's essentially
2261140	2265080	It's it's it's the first two original Superman movies just kind of flung together
2266580	2271780	There's no Lex Luthor though. That's the origin story plus Zod. Yeah, that's that's what I'm talking about
2271780	2275580	Yeah, anyway, which makes sense because like Zod like if you're gonna have an origin story
2275580	2280060	It makes sense to have Zod be the villain of the origin story because Zod is part of the origin
2280060	2285240	Yeah, you know the fact that technically he is the fact that that was worked in was great. All right, okay
2285240	2286360	but
2286360	2292280	Yeah, I guess final final thoughts in this movie. Um, I'm gonna go see it again. So yeah
2293520	2297700	And I'd I recommend seeing it but like
2299640	2303420	Like you can't like with Star Trek go with a grain of salt yeah
2303800	2311120	You can't expect a masterpiece. It's not here. This movie does not have it all together. It's a it's a popcorn movie again. Yeah
2312120	2317700	Like it's just it's another case of those movies trying to capitalize on the massive success of
2318000	2325120	Thematically similar movies with similar looking trailers and just failing at it. Yeah, they did not capture the exact matter. You you're not making
2330160	2336480	Yeah, what wasn't yeah wasn't he like kind of like on the on the books to make a Dark Knight Returns movie I
2337480	2340960	Think so, he was a guy that made Watchmen. Yeah, and what was good?
2341240	2346960	It was good, but it was it was again one of those things where it was impossible to bring it across
2348120	2352000	Perfectly. Yeah, or as close to perfectly as possible. We did a very good job
2352000	2355020	He did a good job with what he had. He didn't do a good job here. I don't think
2355520	2356640	Not really
2356640	2363360	No, and I feel like Christopher Nolan's name was just kind of attached to it just to get fans of the Dark Knight series to
2363360	2367840	Show up pretty much. Well, you had it. You had a hand in the original script everything, right? So yeah
2367840	2370220	I wonder what did that look like cuz I'm sure it wasn't like this
2373320	2379640	Yeah after this we'll talk about trailers dudes, you know, we're gonna trail it up we're gonna eat some trail mix
2382240	2386520	So Dave tell me about these trailers that you're pulling in the back of your truck
2386520	2394320	Dev wasn't there for a couple of the trailers. Yeah, I went to get some popcorn. You went to get popcorn
2395320	2398000	You're late. It was like the same crap as last time
2398880	2403280	We saw Pacific Rim. There was no GLaDOS voice in it, which is disappointing
2403280	2410840	No, that wasn't that one. No one was new the other two. It was the snail car bullshit. Yeah turbo the Disney movie and
2411840	2418280	I actually used to Disney movies and I think of it. What was it? I'm on Ranger again. What's the on Ranger?
2419400	2424480	So I wasn't there for this one. Obviously the Lone Ranger. It was playing last time
2426320	2430600	I'm big William tell over church. Did I did it? Did I did it? Did I did it? Yes, Kimo said
2431560	2436800	Yeah, you know William tell overture is his theme song from the year, you know from the TV show and he had
2436960	2443480	I don't recall the trailer though. He had an Indian guide friend. I don't recall the trailer. It was Johnny Depp playing
2444080	2446080	playing tanto
2446120	2449360	There's a guy who's like his brother gets killed and he swears revenge
2449360	2452760	And I don't know if he gets like if he gets killed or horribly injured
2452760	2455960	But I guess I think he gets injured, but he gets healed back like by the local natives
2455960	2459760	And well, it's very clear that this trailer is of no fucking consequence
2459760	2465560	No, it's not the movie looks because absolutely stupid because like I can't remember it after twice. Yeah
2466120	2472880	But then they had that turbo which is a snail who gets nitro. Yeah, he gets he accidentally falls into a
2474040	2481560	nitrous oxide tank and somehow it just comes like awesome like super fast and joins a team of super fast snails and who somehow
2481560	2483560	Exist because they have like rockets
2484840	2487120	And get this he enters NASCAR
2488320	2493200	my two favorite things snails and horrible CG anthropomorphism and
2494040	2496040	NASCAR and rednecks
2496520	2498520	Well, that's part of the NASCAR
2498800	2501080	And then and then I love my grandmother, but my god
2501080	2506000	I do not understand her taste in that was that was there really only three trailers that was Pacific Rim
2506000	2510240	And that was it wasn't that one more Pacific Rim Pacific Rim. I think was the last one
2510240	2513040	There was one actually know there. I think there was one more that was
2513640	2515720	Pacific Rim was shit
2516600	2518600	out of the
2519120	2521120	Owen man, okay, dude
2521400	2526400	Our theater sucked like I don't mind it was packed and I don't mind sitting in the front row
2526400	2530760	That's why it was awful, but there's people like the kids like laughing and screaming in the fucking thing
2530760	2532840	Yeah, and they were talking. What can you do?
2533600	2538640	Yeah, like their asses actually there was there was my big complaint was we're too close to scream because it
2539320	2544480	Shit, I didn't mind it. It's degraded a lot. I like me boy. It was fuzzy man. It was that fuzzy
2544480	2547940	But like none of the worse music usually you get the full effect the speakers
2547940	2549740	We didn't which is a good thing in a bad thing
2549740	2555820	It's it's good that we didn't get our ears blasted tonight is but yeah to the
2556620	2562340	To the left a couple seats and then far back behind there was just this one woman who sounded middle-aged
2562340	2565020	Just fucking squawking through the whole fucking movie
2566620	2568620	Dad this is true. This is trailer talk
2571740	2574860	Dave if something remarkable happens in the theater
2574980	2579980	You have a duty to talk about like if a woman runs by and is naked would you talk about it on this deal?
2579980	2582980	Oh, yeah, because it would be a naked woman in the middle of a theater
2582980	2585360	But someone talking during a movie is nothing new
2585360	2590340	But yeah, was that was that really the only trailer was that I think I thought there was one after Pacific Rim
2590340	2596860	I can't remember. This is why you should write them down. I didn't think there was anything that past Pacific Rim because like this
2597420	2601660	There's something like in between but really if it was really that of that. Yeah
2601660	2606060	Like I can't remember it really can't I just I must have just blanked out
2608260	2614900	Yeah, there's there's nothing coming out anymore this year like this year has had its load blown with Star Trek and
2615800	2621620	No, there's there's okay. There's the hobbit right at the enders game. Oh, that's right enters game. Yeah, there are there
2621860	2627920	Actually, there's a list. I was looking I'm stumbling. There's a list of sci-fi and fantasy movies. Well, yes specifically
2628420	2630420	Isn't Pacific Rim coming out in July?
2630540	2632540	Yes, it's like July
2632660	2637020	I'm gonna go do that that one next for this this little thing. We got time. It was good
2639140	2641540	It's a good place or something like that
2648540	2650540	Night
