WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:03.140
Dave the hipster here to talk about artsy fucking movies

00:06.140 --> 00:10.880
We're on our we're just about to catch the bus the autobus to see a man of steel

00:11.400 --> 00:13.400
Neither of us really know much about it

00:13.680 --> 00:19.120
I've heard some pretty bad things about it to be honest. Yeah, so I'm not going into this with open arms

00:19.240 --> 00:24.520
I'm not gonna lie. I'm not a huge Superman fan. I liked Smallville. I really like really like Smallville

00:24.520 --> 00:28.640
I like to do a degree. I like Lois and Clark more. Yep. Yeah, that was a much better show

00:29.080 --> 00:34.840
You know what? I liked what that one Superman cartoon where he beat up Japanese people because it was made in like the 1930s

00:37.400 --> 00:44.860
Everyone did it back then. Okay, all the superheroes the job. All right. Well anyways, even Bugs Bunny did it. Yeah, that's true

00:45.920 --> 00:52.000
And yeah, Donald Duck became a Nazi. Yeah. Anyways, that's that's completely off the beaten track there. Please don't suck

00:52.880 --> 00:58.000
Please don't be garbage. I know it'll be a good popcorn movie. At least you think so most likely

00:58.000 --> 01:05.480
It's gonna be all flash and cash but all flash. No cash. Is that is that a saying? I think so. I'd like to say it

01:06.360 --> 01:08.360
Um, I don't know

01:08.800 --> 01:10.800
Mmm, I

01:10.960 --> 01:15.200
Haven't liked any of the other Superman movies. I haven't seen Superman Returns

01:15.920 --> 01:21.040
So I like the original Superman movie Superman's hard to make a movie for like I was yeah

01:21.040 --> 01:26.100
I was saying this earlier upstairs like Batman has a bunch of really good villains Superman doesn't know

01:26.900 --> 01:31.740
Superman's villains are not rooted in bleh in like cultural lexicon

01:32.700 --> 01:34.700
Funny she said lexicon

01:35.740 --> 01:41.820
Yeah, but like everyone even non comic book readers know who Batman and the Joker are yeah, you know

01:41.860 --> 01:46.940
Yeah, I've heard of Lex Luthor. They've heard of him, but he's not as ubiquitous as the Joker

01:46.940 --> 01:49.780
No, because he's not he's he's just a guy. He's just

01:50.300 --> 01:54.200
Manipulative he's a demon and cruel but he's not he's not like psychotic

01:54.200 --> 02:00.280
Yeah, but I mean even even beyond that like everyone knows most of Batman's villains. Yeah, they do Batman's villains

02:00.360 --> 02:04.780
They're just they're just more interesting to begin with because they're yeah, they all seem like splinters of his of his

02:05.200 --> 02:11.440
Psyche from when he was, you know, horribly scarred. I wouldn't go quite that far. That's a fan theory

02:12.720 --> 02:14.720
Superman I mean when it comes down to it

02:15.640 --> 02:21.080
Superman's you know his parents didn't die. His parents got old. That's it. No his parents died of old age

02:21.600 --> 02:23.600
No, his real parents died

02:24.080 --> 02:30.040
Okay-dotted and then his other parents died of old age actually the story goes that his his father is adopted father

02:30.040 --> 02:34.680
Jonathan supposed to died of a heart attack. He was like a teenager. That's not how it went though

02:35.080 --> 02:39.440
So it's on the movies in most stories of that Superman's in

02:39.960 --> 02:45.160
He's still kind of old and around and just like an old man out in the farm. There's different there's different ones, right?

02:45.160 --> 02:51.040
I mean you can say this is Candace's Canada, but like whatever it's not really that's not so much an important thing

02:51.160 --> 02:54.160
The thing is is Superman himself makes a good bill

02:55.160 --> 03:00.240
This isn't gonna be a movie about that though, but it's not so that's why I'm not really holding out for yeah

03:00.240 --> 03:05.080
But that that's you. I like you know, I like Zod though. Yeah, I hope this Zod is okay

03:05.080 --> 03:10.240
if there's gonna be if there's gonna be a villain in a Superman movie if it's not Lex and

03:11.560 --> 03:13.560
Yeah, there is cuz

03:14.120 --> 03:19.620
It doesn't make sense for it to be anybody else no Zod was the quintessential

03:20.420 --> 03:22.420
Superman but you know what?

03:22.620 --> 03:25.540
This before we before you take off I'm gonna say one more thing

03:25.540 --> 03:30.940
This seems like it's gonna have this the Star Trek syndrome of the last movie we watched probably where it'll be like police

03:30.940 --> 03:32.180
We know it's odd they have yeah

03:32.180 --> 03:37.900
They have con in there just because it's con and cuz they and cuz they want to capitalize on the sequel on that trend

03:37.900 --> 03:42.000
That movies are going with now. They're gonna go with they're gonna go with Zod to do the exact same thing

03:42.340 --> 03:44.340
It's gonna feel the same I bet

03:44.420 --> 03:47.520
This time I agree with you. So let's let's go the movie

03:50.580 --> 03:55.100
Before crappy movie. Yes. I would have to actually use that line Neil

04:01.740 --> 04:07.260
Hey guys, we just got back from watching Man of Steel. Yeah, as you can tell it's night out

04:08.100 --> 04:13.180
We're still on our back porch. Just it's night. This is a Porsche or a deck deck. It's a deck. Yeah

04:13.860 --> 04:20.060
Yeah, what's the what's that because they're made of wood and they're both have banisters and you can usually fit chairs on them

04:20.060 --> 04:24.500
So what's like what how does it go from deck to porch? What's the size difference?

04:27.820 --> 04:29.820
And

04:31.540 --> 04:33.540
What do you think of it would you think of that seal I

04:34.140 --> 04:39.260
Have very mixed feelings about it. Do you um, let me see now. I mix them with

04:40.180 --> 04:42.180
Yes

04:42.980 --> 04:50.200
Alternative blend man. Okay, honestly, I thought overall it was okay

04:51.620 --> 04:55.340
It wasn't as impressive as I found Star Trek. I

04:56.780 --> 04:58.780
Found that

04:59.060 --> 05:03.600
I'm just gonna start off with the thing. I don't like the lowest. Okay, it's all right, by the way spoilers

05:03.600 --> 05:06.720
Yeah, well knows odds in it Cumberbatch was odd. I

05:06.720 --> 05:13.560
Don't even I don't even know who plays odd. I can't remember why I camera his name, but I didn't like him

05:13.560 --> 05:18.120
I honestly I thought he was kind of over he over acted a lot

05:18.640 --> 05:21.680
and I want to get this out of the way right now just

05:22.360 --> 05:25.240
Just what happened in my mind and has nothing to do it with anything in the movie

05:25.240 --> 05:30.120
Well, it does but it's not a big critique. Okay, but remember how there was the scene where Zod's like like

05:31.400 --> 05:33.400
Zod

05:33.480 --> 05:35.800
Lands on earth and he has his helmet off and he's like

05:36.080 --> 05:39.920
He's like looking at his arm and he finally gets his senses in order, you know

05:39.920 --> 05:43.160
It zooms in really close in his face. He gets the same powers of Superman

05:43.160 --> 05:46.100
Yeah, but it zooms in really close in his face and he's like I finally yeah

05:46.100 --> 05:49.800
I finally have my senses in order I can control his senses

05:49.800 --> 05:52.320
Yeah, there's they left a giant zit on his nose

05:52.320 --> 05:54.420
And it was just like yeah

05:54.420 --> 05:58.480
They took up like one eight to the screen just this giant zit cuz they zoomed in so close and I was like

05:58.480 --> 06:00.480
Did you notice that? Yeah

06:01.280 --> 06:03.280
Fucking makeup fail

06:03.400 --> 06:08.040
Well, I think I'd actually made sense. I think leaving it in made sense cuz I mean he

06:09.160 --> 06:11.880
He's stressing out and he he was just dirty at that point

06:15.880 --> 06:19.220
I mean, I like the realism and in the giant Zod zit

06:19.640 --> 06:22.720
But every the rest of the movie, yeah, but the rest of them was just not

06:22.720 --> 06:25.760
I think I saw two scenes with him in there that were actually

06:26.280 --> 06:28.680
Actually, okay to good

06:29.880 --> 06:32.680
He had some good lines though. Like he had that the one where

06:33.920 --> 06:37.120
He was talking to like a computer program of Superman's dad

06:38.240 --> 06:41.080
Jor-el played by Russell Crowe. Yeah, he was he was like

06:41.600 --> 06:47.160
Yeah, he was talking to it to Jor-el and he's and Jor-el is like you can't you can't kill everyone

06:47.160 --> 06:51.880
He's like I'm arguing the merits of genocide with a ghost. Yeah, that was kind of funny

06:51.880 --> 06:57.000
There was actually a couple laughs and then and then when he says like where did you train on a farm? Yeah

06:57.880 --> 07:03.000
There and yeah, there were some good he had a he had a few decent lines

07:03.000 --> 07:08.760
They weren't like other characters in the movie like overly funny though where like the girl said I just think Superman's kind of hot

07:09.160 --> 07:11.920
Yeah, there were some goofy lines that made me chuckle

07:11.920 --> 07:16.000
There was a few but that was another thing about the movie. I found that

07:16.520 --> 07:20.680
Wasn't quite as endearing was that it took its way too seriously. Mmm. It was just

07:21.200 --> 07:27.800
So over-the-top and I mean it is Superman and Superman has a certain flexibility and being over-the-top

07:29.320 --> 07:33.480
However, you can't make a realistic world and then

07:34.020 --> 07:39.200
Do what they did with it there and expect people to take it seriously. Yeah, like it was Dragon Ball Z fights

07:39.200 --> 07:41.560
It was like smashing people through fucking the earth

07:42.200 --> 07:45.240
Welcome to earth. Welcome to going through the entire earth

07:46.120 --> 07:47.480
Great

07:47.480 --> 07:51.680
Smashing people through buildings and shit and like, you know speaking of that

07:52.960 --> 07:56.960
Like that final fight between Zod and Superman. Mm-hmm. Okay, so Superman

07:57.760 --> 08:01.680
Okay at the end of the movie Superman kills Zod and others

08:02.120 --> 08:05.920
He kills Zod and then he's like overcome by a grief that he had to kill somebody

08:06.360 --> 08:11.360
Like in his fight with Zod, they're like smashing each other through fucking

08:12.020 --> 08:19.040
Skyscrapers and they're just collapsing on to each other and like in that fight. They have killed millions of people

08:21.400 --> 08:28.480
At least thousands like they're throwing around fucking oil tankers that explode and like helicopters are falling out of the fucking sky like

08:28.720 --> 08:31.240
super like the collateral damage to both

08:31.920 --> 08:33.360
lives and

08:33.360 --> 08:37.480
Stuff. Yeah, it's Superman directly causes in his fight with Zod. There's

08:38.080 --> 08:40.080
catastrophic really not that much

08:40.560 --> 08:42.560
emphasis on evacuation efforts

08:42.600 --> 08:46.680
No so much because you think that like everyone's fucking just yeah

08:46.680 --> 08:51.260
Cuz you see like three three people from the Daily Planet including Perry White just running away

08:51.640 --> 08:57.160
Yeah, and that guy's running from the building as they're building slowly collapses on top of them. Yeah, you know, it's and like

08:58.200 --> 09:00.760
Pretty evident. There's no there's no real warning there

09:00.760 --> 09:00.920
No

09:00.920 --> 09:02.440
and like the final

09:02.440 --> 09:08.200
That the final plan is odd is to like terraform the earth with this giant beam that goes through the center of the earth's core

09:08.200 --> 09:10.200
That was pretty cool. Actually, I like that. It was kind of neat

09:10.360 --> 09:14.720
Like the way they were like lifting up the gravity that gravity was like lifting shit and smashing it down again

09:14.720 --> 09:17.200
Because it was slowly increasing. Yeah each time because they're

09:18.000 --> 09:22.160
It's like drinkable see it's like a hundred tons of gravity. Yeah, and that was neat

09:22.160 --> 09:26.080
That was neat to see but like fucking everybody died

09:26.680 --> 09:30.600
Like there were no survivors of this fucking movie or there shouldn't have been

09:31.440 --> 09:38.920
Dude there's survivors that much fucking destruction like how many people the other side of camera just died the other side

09:39.560 --> 09:44.560
Wasn't so bad, but metropolis the core metropolis. There were probably thousands of casualties. Yeah

09:44.560 --> 09:50.600
Yeah, like like and like how many were mentioned military how many were like directly by superman like when Superman gets pissed off

09:50.600 --> 09:53.080
He's like don't talk about my mom like that

09:53.400 --> 09:58.440
And I was like your mom and then Superman just tackles them and then they fly through 30 buildings

09:58.560 --> 10:00.720
He killed people. All right. All right. All right

10:01.360 --> 10:06.620
So I think we're getting up too much in his semantics here. I'd like to talk a little bit more bigger picture

10:06.620 --> 10:08.360
Here's where I'm going with this

10:08.360 --> 10:15.740
Okay, Superman cries at the end cuz he killed Zod. He has killed millions before the inadvertently though

10:16.320 --> 10:20.000
This is the first person he's killed directly

10:21.040 --> 10:27.800
So also I did like at the ends odds like James Bond esque fucking laser like getting closer to the families

10:28.440 --> 10:30.440
I

10:37.320 --> 10:43.440
Think the plot was very disjointed it just kept going back. I swear to God it felt like a fucking absolute loss

10:43.440 --> 10:44.920
I didn't mind the flashbacks

10:44.920 --> 10:51.600
I didn't mind the fact that we would go back and like see but they just bring on these elements and they wouldn't explain them

10:51.600 --> 10:55.940
I like the fact that that we would go back and see Superman's

10:56.780 --> 11:03.780
Childhood because it was it was an origin story that made sense. Yeah, we went back and saw his childhood it that aspect

11:03.780 --> 11:06.300
I was fine with I just I thought it was kind of weird

11:06.300 --> 11:11.980
They started off with him being an adult and working on a fucking fishing but Batman did that

11:12.700 --> 11:18.400
In Batman Begins like it starts with him as an adult in the Chinese prison and it shows his childhood. Yeah. Yeah

11:19.020 --> 11:23.540
It's the same thing. I think they handled it better though. Yeah. Yeah, I mean a little bit my dad

11:23.540 --> 11:27.340
I mean and and and they showed they showed in the movie that Canadians are real jerks. Yeah

11:28.340 --> 11:35.300
Apparently if you're getting into their assholes, you're a good-looking guy from from America automatically. We hate you

11:35.300 --> 11:37.500
Yeah, so we'll just get into bar fights with you in Nova Scotia

11:37.500 --> 11:44.580
Although that was another part that was funny though what he does this guy who started beating. I think that's a good a

11:45.220 --> 11:47.380
Good take on the fortress of solitude

11:48.260 --> 11:50.260
The fact that it was like a 20,000 year old

11:50.860 --> 11:54.780
Derelict kryptonian ship just frozen in the ice it does that was me

11:54.780 --> 11:59.020
It is a lot more convenient instead of him just standing where they're there with a heat rate

12:00.420 --> 12:02.500
He did burrow his way in though

12:03.820 --> 12:06.660
Yeah, like to get into this ship

12:06.660 --> 12:11.880
He did he fucking tunneled through the ice with his heat vision but like the fortress of solitude originally wasn't like like something that

12:11.880 --> 12:13.380
He built himself

12:14.380 --> 12:16.380
Hang out as a natural ice

12:16.700 --> 12:20.740
But like he kind of like sculpted it with his yeah with his super powers

12:20.740 --> 12:25.820
He did but like in this one. It is a frozen ship. Yeah, which is I think in a neat like

12:26.460 --> 12:28.820
I'm not a purist. I like when

12:29.380 --> 12:35.260
Franchises they if you're gonna remake a franchise do something new with it put a different spin on it

12:35.260 --> 12:42.260
I'm okay with that and with the fortress of solitude making it into a derelict kryptonian ship made sense. I think it was cool

12:43.420 --> 12:48.420
That was the only thing I really thought was cool this movie one part that kind of rankled with me as well was they

12:49.220 --> 12:51.220
they introduced

12:51.260 --> 12:53.260
like they introduced

12:53.700 --> 12:59.220
Superman as Clark Kent to Lois Lane really fast like she found out so fast. Yeah, that's because

13:02.180 --> 13:07.060
Superman was never he never really called himself Superman. He wasn't he was never really a superhero in this

13:08.500 --> 13:10.500
You know she was gonna start calling

13:10.980 --> 13:12.980
Well, I don't think you own what she was

13:13.180 --> 13:20.100
Like even when he is in the Superman costume. He's called Clark Kent or Kal-el

13:20.260 --> 13:23.420
Yeah, I should call him Cal. Yeah, they call him. They just call him Cal

13:23.460 --> 13:27.100
Yeah, like he's either one of the other they don't call him anything else

13:27.580 --> 13:34.580
When using the costume like she goes to say what why doesn't the s stand for soup and it just kind of stops

13:34.580 --> 13:38.620
Yeah, like she's interrupted and like that. It's not an ass. Yeah

13:39.460 --> 13:44.500
That is another thing like I like the art direction in this I liked how there was like the floating like like

13:44.660 --> 13:47.980
Balls that turn into faces. Yeah, I was like a organic metal

13:47.980 --> 13:54.780
Yeah, that was really cool. And I liked how they explained the Superman symbol like just being random ass fucking symbols for every house

13:55.860 --> 13:59.540
Yeah, they even know I had like the same the same thing like this

13:59.820 --> 14:05.300
But it was like the same very the same the same emerald shape but had like a different symbol on it

14:05.500 --> 14:09.020
Everyone had like a different some yeah, they did and she just happened to look like an ass

14:09.660 --> 14:11.660
Yeah, and that's why we need

14:11.940 --> 14:17.180
What I don't like though is how like when he's exploring the ship and his dad's like, by the way

14:17.180 --> 14:20.540
Here's your suit and it's just like here's here's the Superman suit

14:20.540 --> 14:24.700
Oh, yeah, if I'm gonna draw a parallel between this and anything else. I just read

14:26.580 --> 14:32.500
Superman earth one graphic novel and it's takes place when Clark is 20 and

14:33.180 --> 14:35.980
He's been to junior college he's off to metropolis

14:35.980 --> 14:41.260
He's trying to find a job and his landlady says, you know, you should go get more education

14:41.260 --> 14:48.500
It's like I'm okay goes he tries over a football team just creams them goes and goes and solves. It is an incredibly

14:48.900 --> 14:50.020
intense

14:50.020 --> 14:52.020
equation with drawing

14:53.460 --> 14:55.620
Electrician salt water or something like that and

14:56.220 --> 15:01.700
Then he goes and he becomes like this massively successful stockbroker because he's so intelligent, right?

15:02.820 --> 15:09.140
Wasn't that like that was something they retcon that like Superman like in at least in modern comics only really has average

15:09.460 --> 15:12.020
Intelligence that he can't keep up to Batman in terms of intelligence

15:12.580 --> 15:16.860
That was a thing they made they did like Batman is like the smartest motherfucker in the universe

15:16.860 --> 15:22.420
Well, the thing also a Superman is he can meet people's minds. So he might be a can he is he could even he can hear?

15:22.420 --> 15:23.860
people's thoughts Oh

15:23.860 --> 15:25.580
can he

15:25.580 --> 15:28.540
He yes, he can you couldn't in this movie?

15:28.540 --> 15:33.420
Yes, he could when he's when he's in the closet and the other kids like oh what a freak. He's hearing them talk

15:34.580 --> 15:40.420
He's not hearing that. He's not hearing their thoughts. He's hearing them talk through the wall. He has super sensitive hearing

15:40.900 --> 15:43.580
Superman can hear every what everyone's saying also

15:43.580 --> 15:44.740
I don't know one point you can read mine

15:44.740 --> 15:48.060
I'm sure there's like a new duration of Superman where he has the power to read minds

15:48.060 --> 15:55.740
But I think commonly Superman's powers have always been like super super senses. Yeah, the super senses the flying the strength

15:56.420 --> 15:57.860
The

15:57.860 --> 16:01.300
Invulnerability. I don't think there was a healing factor just invulnerability

16:01.940 --> 16:04.820
He had no idea. He doesn't have a healing factor because when he's on

16:05.460 --> 16:07.820
The ship he is attacked. Yeah

16:08.700 --> 16:12.960
Like scout ship he gets attacked and he's got a cut and he still got it. Yeah

16:13.460 --> 16:14.820
It takes time to heal

16:14.820 --> 16:21.500
Well, then like there is an in the Dark Knight Returns Superman has a healing factor based on just how much sunlight he gets

16:21.500 --> 16:28.020
Cuz he gets hit directly with a nuke in that comic and he's like a fucking just like like near-death like cripple skeleton

16:28.020 --> 16:30.020
He's like, ah, and then he just gets into the center

16:31.460 --> 16:33.460
This comes back

16:37.580 --> 16:41.540
Yeah, I there's there's a definitely some

16:42.340 --> 16:44.340
Yeah with this movie. I

16:44.900 --> 16:50.460
Didn't mind the flashbacks. I like Kevin Costner. He was good. He was good as I thought

16:50.980 --> 16:55.140
Between him and Russell Crowe. They were the best people the best characters in the movie

16:55.140 --> 17:01.540
Yeah, they both did they had enough lines to make an impact to have wait, but they didn't eclipse anyone else

17:01.540 --> 17:06.340
Yeah, they were both. They're just good. There's like you're just like character acting. Yes. They were both good in this movie

17:06.580 --> 17:10.500
They're both different kinds of dads entirely. Yeah, but like with

17:11.820 --> 17:13.620
with

17:13.620 --> 17:15.620
Jonathan Kent

17:15.620 --> 17:18.380
Like the one thing I didn't like about him

17:18.380 --> 17:20.220
Was

17:20.220 --> 17:27.380
How he was like he wanted Superman to hide his powers to the point of letting people die

17:27.980 --> 17:29.460
including himself

17:29.460 --> 17:35.700
Yeah spoilers. Yeah, like I don't think that's something that Jonathan Kent would do like

17:36.660 --> 17:43.260
Like Superman like the fucking bus bus crashes into the lake and Superman's like what should I shave is let them drown?

17:43.260 --> 17:45.020
He's like, I don't know

17:45.020 --> 17:49.780
You know, like, you know, I think what he's implying is that he should have saved them anyways

17:49.780 --> 17:53.180
But he should have been more careful about instead of lifting the bus directly on the water

17:53.180 --> 17:55.140
He should just you know

17:55.140 --> 17:58.340
Like just kind of threw them up in the surface cuz he's got the strength to do it

17:58.380 --> 18:01.780
Yeah, just grab that, you know everyone cuz he would have had enough time. Mm-hmm

18:02.180 --> 18:03.700
It wouldn't have taken that long

18:03.700 --> 18:07.060
He could have done and then just like and then just like oh man, I just say yeah

18:07.060 --> 18:12.060
Um, you know what I say to you. I'm a good swimmer. Yeah, but I mean it just seemed

18:12.820 --> 18:16.220
Maybe you took that from that. I didn't take that from that for me to me

18:16.220 --> 18:20.500
It seemed like Jonathan Kent was actually advocating letting the kids die or at least

18:20.940 --> 18:24.900
considering the possibility of letting everyone in the bus died to tell it so that so that

18:25.420 --> 18:31.820
Clark can just go on without being discovered which is not very much like also like kind of a weird version of Uncle Ben

18:32.100 --> 18:39.100
Yeah, well his death was was very Uncle Ben esque like, you know, yeah

18:40.100 --> 18:47.140
Man could have like saved him immediately without even breaking a sweat and he looks at him. Yeah. Yeah, he's standing there

18:47.460 --> 18:51.620
He's standing there like in the middle of this fucking in like the eye of a tornado and he's just like no

18:51.620 --> 18:57.940
He's not even the eyes of the outskirts. No, wait, he's standing there in the middle of this fucking tornado and he just goes no

18:58.580 --> 19:00.580
It's like don't worry about he just goes

19:01.380 --> 19:08.140
God, yeah. Yeah, he goes back to save a fucking dog. Yeah a dog. Yeah that dies to save a dog

19:08.140 --> 19:13.620
Yeah, that's not right. I was stupid. Yeah, if you went back to save a human I could see it but a dog

19:13.620 --> 19:18.220
Yeah, I like what yeah, but really don't sacrifice your life to save a fucking dog. Yeah, I

19:20.220 --> 19:21.820
That

19:21.820 --> 19:26.900
Like I didn't buy that Jonathan Kent was so committed to

19:27.540 --> 19:35.820
Not revealing his son's identity that he would say no, let's have people die. Well, I didn't buy that it wasn't he was anti

19:36.820 --> 19:42.100
Revelation he was he was against him showing himself at the improper time when he wasn't already

19:42.100 --> 19:46.060
I mean if you notice he said I'm 33. Mm-hmm. It's like a whole Jesus thing

19:46.580 --> 19:52.600
They were drawing parallels to Jesus. Well, of course, I mean remember when he like he floated out into space and he's like

19:57.100 --> 20:01.540
There is a Christian bent to the movie, yeah, there really is I mean he even goes and talks to a priest

20:01.540 --> 20:03.540
And here's the problem with being 33

20:04.180 --> 20:09.320
Like he's 33. He discovers the he discovers the the fortress of solitude. He talks to his dad

20:09.320 --> 20:12.600
He gets the suit and he's like you need to train your powers and become strong

20:12.600 --> 20:16.400
It's like okay, so he starts like jumping around in the Arctic and I'm like

20:17.620 --> 20:21.540
If you're 33 and you're a kid and you're lifting buses out of the fucking ocean

20:22.500 --> 20:29.820
Yeah, he's already got the potential to do like no. No, like you're only now testing the limits of your abilities

20:30.820 --> 20:37.340
Yeah, like he was flying and like he's like yeah, this is awesome man, I can fly and you're 33

20:37.340 --> 20:39.300
Oh don't explain it

20:39.300 --> 20:45.340
Don't you think you would have like looked into that shit earlier if you knew you had all these big stage explain

20:45.580 --> 20:50.500
Actually, and like I'm not in the movie, but they explained in the one comic I read this isn't the fucking comics Dave

20:50.500 --> 20:57.780
No, but it does make sense the material that it is. It's a Kryptonian material that cannot be burnt or ripped or

20:58.780 --> 21:04.740
Melted by conventional earth means therefore. It's the only thing he can wear in order to fly

21:04.740 --> 21:09.320
Otherwise, it would just get torn off. So he just will end up in the middle of nowhere bare-ass naked

21:10.420 --> 21:14.900
Okay fair enough, but do you think a ten-year-old who has crazy amounts of superpowers?

21:15.060 --> 21:19.460
He couldn't fly until he would though would try it even in the original movie

21:19.460 --> 21:25.620
He still didn't start like flying until he was 33. No. No, he was he was in his teens

21:25.620 --> 21:31.980
Okay, so he's in his teens and he goes to try to fly and he flies and rips his clothes off and goes

21:31.980 --> 21:38.820
Oh, well, I'm naked. But now I know I can fly. No. No in this movie. He doesn't even try it to lose three like that

21:39.900 --> 21:40.980
Doesn't make sense to me

21:40.980 --> 21:49.180
He should have tested the boundaries of his abilities before his his real dad comes along because because there's a scene where he's

21:49.660 --> 21:53.860
going from a fishing boat to the top of a oil rig and

21:54.740 --> 21:59.900
In like two seconds, so he has to have jumped he has to have some notion that he can do it

22:00.020 --> 22:04.820
Yeah, it's just that he hasn't but to really push himself right, but the fact that he is

22:05.540 --> 22:07.260
Like elated

22:07.260 --> 22:11.220
It's obvious that that moment in the movie was his first time flying

22:11.220 --> 22:13.180
It is they make it clear by the way

22:13.180 --> 22:14.480
He's reacting by the way

22:14.480 --> 22:18.780
He but by the way, he's he's doing it is his first time flying and I don't buy that

22:18.780 --> 22:22.220
I think you would have tried it if you were when you were younger, it's half-baked

22:22.900 --> 22:29.900
That's the whole movies half-baked that's what exactly I was gonna say the whole movie is half is it's it's half-assed

22:30.620 --> 22:36.500
It's got good action scenes. It's got ridiculous action. See it's got well, they're well-made

22:37.380 --> 22:40.780
Special effects was I wasn't I wasn't worried about that. I was worried about the plot

22:40.780 --> 22:41.900
I mean about characterization

22:41.900 --> 22:47.260
Here's the problem like you can go in and like go down the list of things that are good in a movie and you can

22:47.260 --> 22:51.460
Tick off special effects, but like does that really mean anything anymore having good special effects?

22:53.220 --> 22:55.380
It's a summer action not a blockbuster

22:55.380 --> 23:02.340
It's a summer action blockbuster it having great special effects, which it does it comes on. It does not give it any full facts

23:02.340 --> 23:04.560
It's not really the CG so much as the makeup

23:06.100 --> 23:07.940
Yeah, it's consistency

23:07.940 --> 23:13.940
Yeah, and I mean what it comes down the art direction the art direction in this movie was great the costuming the the looks of

23:14.420 --> 23:18.620
Like Krypton. Oh speaking of Krypton. How is he like he's like

23:18.620 --> 23:20.460
I

23:20.460 --> 23:22.660
Russell Crowe someone's fucking a tree

23:23.980 --> 23:26.100
you mean Falkor and like

23:27.260 --> 23:34.420
Goes on this fucking chase scene. Yeah, like fucking like space helicopters after him. That was a bit much one with nature

23:35.820 --> 23:39.380
You like he's like a world of Warcraft hunter who like blows

23:40.180 --> 23:43.820
Like blows his whistle and like his pet appears. He just flies away bro. Let's go

23:44.100 --> 23:46.100
Epic

23:47.780 --> 23:50.200
Yeah, it was pretty far-fetched so

23:51.140 --> 23:53.760
Yeah, they also they developed Zod's

23:54.540 --> 24:02.140
Female right-hand woman there a lot to Easton amount one thing that bothered me about her was she was in there in there in Superman

24:02.140 --> 24:06.880
Too anyway, wasn't she? Yeah, she had he had two people. Yeah. The one thing that bothered me about her

24:07.140 --> 24:09.140
It wasn't like a huge thing, but

24:09.140 --> 24:14.180
She gets hit so much and then she gets a missile she catches a missile and that knocks her out

24:17.060 --> 24:19.140
Well, it was a pretty big missile

24:19.740 --> 24:25.980
Still I mean Dave Dave, she took a hell of a life give any woman a meat missile and she will get knocked out

24:29.020 --> 24:36.820
No, no, like I I I I bought that because the missile seemed much more destructive than even like a kryptonian punch

24:39.180 --> 24:42.500
All right, well that was the only thing that really rankle with me

24:42.500 --> 24:48.900
But I mean like yeah the destructiveness of those fight scenes between like Superman Zod Superman and all the other kryptonians

24:48.900 --> 24:52.380
They're like smashing concrete. Yeah, they're blowing up I hops

24:53.300 --> 24:59.860
Honestly, if I'm gonna say anything about a recommendation like I'm I'm gonna go see it again. Are you yes

24:59.860 --> 25:01.860
I'm gonna go see it again and

25:02.420 --> 25:04.140
it's

25:04.140 --> 25:05.820
well

25:05.860 --> 25:11.740
This time I'm gonna I'm gonna try to look at it more objectively. Mm-hmm, and hopefully I'll like it more

25:12.340 --> 25:16.980
I'm not I'm not just I'm going with other people. So yeah, but I mean like oh

25:17.620 --> 25:19.620
Yes, we can have the I hops

25:20.100 --> 25:24.440
Pete dude, there's so much product placement like the no key. She like

25:25.100 --> 25:29.700
He and I hop that was pretty much she's climbing up like the side of this of this ledge or something

25:29.700 --> 25:34.900
She's like she she puts her fucking camera. She puts her camera on ledges like oh, oh fuck

25:34.900 --> 25:36.900
She's like catches her breath

25:38.500 --> 25:43.260
And the whole time is just like on the Nokia just filling the screen or

25:44.820 --> 25:46.820
Or the I hope yeah

25:48.340 --> 25:50.340
Funny though like

25:50.660 --> 25:54.900
Pete I'm the manager of I hope yeah, he's just like I'm working on I hope that's like, okay

25:54.900 --> 25:57.900
And but then like they come back to the I hop and like destroy it in a fight

25:57.980 --> 26:02.180
Yeah, and then Superman looks at Pete Pete looks at Superman like I know you

26:02.900 --> 26:04.900
So you're having a fight in my eye

26:06.100 --> 26:11.900
There are like kind of buddies, I think it was implied they're like sort of like the closest thing of friends that

26:12.700 --> 26:18.560
Superman had yeah, and in the in Smallville, they are friends like which is like actually yeah, like how come

26:19.500 --> 26:23.180
It they didn't really show like Lana Lang being friends of them or anything

26:24.140 --> 26:29.560
What I think they just want to throw it in as a you want to make him a loner in this one, basically

26:29.760 --> 26:35.400
Yeah, I mean let's because if he wanders in his baby he finds that the ship like he is a loner

26:35.400 --> 26:40.260
And I don't think they really want to spend much time on building another romantic angle. They just wanted those

26:41.080 --> 26:43.960
yeah, because I mean, I mean Lana for anyone who's

26:44.760 --> 26:47.800
Any somewhat super fan worth their salt? They're not gonna they're not gonna

26:49.000 --> 26:52.880
Deny that Lana Lang was a presence in his in his youth. Mm-hmm

26:53.880 --> 26:58.900
Yeah, but I mean, yeah, I think they just wanted to build up as a loner like yeah

26:59.620 --> 27:06.180
This this entire movie is about Superman being alone and then discovering who he is. Yeah, it's the opposite of Smallville Smallville

27:06.180 --> 27:11.460
Like he's got Lex as a buddy. He's got Pete as a buddy. He's got the Chloe chick. He's got Lana

27:13.020 --> 27:18.380
Eventually Lois. Yeah later on. Yeah, so it is it's very much kind of the

27:18.980 --> 27:24.660
The same old crap that we you know, the same thing we were talking about before. Yeah, it's like it's just the same sort of

27:25.340 --> 27:30.340
You know the lone wolf going against the chaotic that the engine of chaos you yeah, yeah, definitely

27:30.860 --> 27:35.100
You mentioned before Zod and I'm talking about Zod a bit. Here's the thing. I

27:35.980 --> 27:43.660
Went into this thinking I'd be disappointed by him and I wasn't I wasn't I think he's a good actor and

27:44.340 --> 27:49.780
Zod's a great character and they wrote Zod well and how Zod looked was great

27:49.860 --> 27:54.060
But this guy was not the guy to play Zod. No, he wasn't I I

27:55.140 --> 27:56.900
like to be like

27:56.900 --> 27:58.900
Nationalist, but I think a British guy should play

27:59.700 --> 28:04.180
Cumberbatch, no, no, no, no, but I mean

28:05.020 --> 28:11.180
Those are big shoes to fill. That's Terrence stamp. Mm-hmm. That guy was that guy was like he if they didn't do a kneel

28:12.060 --> 28:16.220
Didn't do kneel before Zod. No, they didn't even some other shit. They did

28:16.820 --> 28:19.000
This is Krypton. Yeah

28:20.300 --> 28:24.500
And they did I will find him which is from doing if you saw doing

28:25.460 --> 28:31.220
And I do and barely I've watched the miniseries and we watch all day the actual movie because it was really fucking long

28:31.220 --> 28:33.540
Yeah, dude, and it has staying in it. So

28:37.580 --> 28:40.280
Anyways, but no with the Zod like

28:40.980 --> 28:47.460
He's a good actor and like the lines they wrote for him were all great lines and how he looked I was all of them

28:47.460 --> 28:52.300
But but his delivery was was but he was not the guy to play Zod

28:52.460 --> 28:58.500
Otherwise everything and everything involving Zod was pretty, you know, I think part of it was to he had a speech at Benjamin did he?

28:58.500 --> 29:01.700
Yeah, I couldn't tell. Yes. Yeah, it sounded like it was like

29:03.460 --> 29:06.740
Like his asses or something it's something there's something weird about the way he spoke

29:07.060 --> 29:11.620
Yeah, it's I didn't speech at Benjamin. I didn't even notice or I could tell I could hear the whole way through

29:11.980 --> 29:16.460
It was really and it was really getting on me. I was like, what the hell is that?

29:16.580 --> 29:21.460
There's something about him despite the fact that he's American or I think he was American, you know

29:21.460 --> 29:25.020
I don't even look up the actor might even Canadian might have been who knows what have been English

29:25.060 --> 29:30.460
Yeah, but the fact that he was using American or a new American classic kind of accent

29:30.660 --> 29:33.260
But he had something weird about his voice. Yeah

29:34.340 --> 29:39.020
Well here here like I said before that Batman's Batman's and villains

29:39.700 --> 29:41.140
They're more

29:41.140 --> 29:46.200
Notable in common society. It's like like you have the Joker everyone knows who the Joker is. You've got

29:47.080 --> 29:53.480
The you know Catwoman everyone knows who that woman is you have even bane to to a limited extent everyone knows who things

29:53.960 --> 29:57.800
Everyone everyone knows who the Riddler. Yeah, everyone knows they have

29:59.040 --> 30:01.520
That's more flash and more substance at the same time

30:01.520 --> 30:06.540
Yeah, and actually and here's the weirdest thing but like like in the first Nolan Batman

30:06.540 --> 30:08.640
It was the Scarecrow and Ra's al Ghul

30:09.520 --> 30:15.220
And like they were those two are not notable Batman villains. I'm surprised that he did them

30:17.200 --> 30:18.560
Oh, no, it's great

30:18.560 --> 30:24.520
But I'm surprised that he did it that you think that you would want to open up with the ones people know

30:26.040 --> 30:31.840
You knew people yeah, but but then but then compare that to Superman's villains and you have

30:32.880 --> 30:34.680
like

30:34.680 --> 30:39.040
And Lex Luthor the ones that would work in a big-budget movie

30:39.520 --> 30:45.360
Designed for people who really aren't fans in the comics like this one

30:45.360 --> 30:46.760
Yeah

30:46.760 --> 30:48.320
Zod would work

30:48.320 --> 30:54.620
And Lex Lex Luthor is the number one that would work general Zod a distant number two doomsday

30:54.620 --> 31:00.520
And no, you wouldn't you wouldn't even been there at all. You know, like if you had to choose a third one, it'd be like

31:01.240 --> 31:04.880
Brainy, maybe yeah, but they already use brainiac in Green Lantern

31:05.440 --> 31:07.440
Was he in Green Lantern? Yeah

31:08.800 --> 31:12.440
Have you seen Green Lantern? No. Okay. Well, I watched it was shit

31:12.680 --> 31:18.160
It wasn't just miss skip this one. I basically know you're Ryan Reynolds. Yeah, it wasn't very good

31:18.160 --> 31:23.960
Yeah, Mark Strong was good at Sinestro, but well Sinestro wasn't a bad guy in that one was he he was he was like

31:23.960 --> 31:25.880
Oh, he wasn't because he's he's going to be later

31:25.880 --> 31:31.580
He was going to be but then it flopped so poorly that they decided not to make a sequel. Yeah, but I think

31:32.520 --> 31:39.080
If they could have had better better choices of actors if they'd have they kept Mark Strong and tried again

31:39.520 --> 31:42.600
Maybe yeah, he was good. He was very strong

31:45.160 --> 31:49.680
Well here here's the thing like you you've got like those three with with

31:50.160 --> 31:56.600
Zod and Brainiac being distant thirds to Lex Luthor and Lex Luthor just is not a compelling villain for

31:57.380 --> 32:03.760
Someone who is as powerful as Superman like for Superman to in my opinion to really work on the big screen and it didn't work

32:03.760 --> 32:05.760
By the way, but they did it before

32:06.520 --> 32:07.520
Yeah

32:07.520 --> 32:10.700
None of the Superman films have worked in my opinion

32:10.800 --> 32:16.520
None of the old ones not Superman Returns and not this one. They all have fundamental flaws

32:17.080 --> 32:20.540
The first one I would probably have to be the best of the worst then

32:21.200 --> 32:27.480
And no cuz he fucking turns he turns back time by going around the fucking earth. Okay, fine except for that part

32:27.480 --> 32:30.520
I think probably the best of the worst is the second one

32:30.520 --> 32:32.520
Yeah

32:32.600 --> 32:37.080
Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, of course because I have the original general Zod

32:37.080 --> 32:42.480
I was I was toting his horn earlier, but I think if you have if you're gonna make a

32:43.320 --> 32:44.680
Superman movie

32:44.680 --> 32:46.480
You only have two choices

32:46.480 --> 32:52.120
one you embrace the pure silliness of the comics like they did with the Avengers and

32:53.120 --> 33:00.160
Just just go fucking just way out there and wild and cross over fucking everything and just make a fucking crazy

33:00.800 --> 33:02.800
fucking serious or two

33:03.560 --> 33:05.560
you have to

33:05.760 --> 33:07.760
radically depower Superman

33:08.940 --> 33:14.240
Because he is too powerful to to make people give a shit

33:14.240 --> 33:19.840
Yeah, you know like if he's as powerful as he is and he's fighting Lex Luthor

33:19.880 --> 33:24.020
He can just like fart on Lex Luthor and pulverize him, you know

33:24.400 --> 33:28.720
So the only other option is to bring in somebody like general Zod who is also as power

33:28.720 --> 33:31.560
And then you get it and then it turns into like a dragon ball z-fest

33:37.080 --> 33:38.760
There's no kryptonite in the movie

33:38.760 --> 33:46.160
But that didn't bug me because kryptonite kryptonite came about because they needed to level the playing field between Superman and human enemies

33:47.160 --> 33:53.320
Yeah, so when Zod's are on you don't need kryptonite. They don't even mention it. That's why I don't even show it or anything

33:53.320 --> 33:55.320
I just thought was kind of weird. I

33:55.680 --> 33:57.040
Didn't miss it

33:57.040 --> 34:02.620
But like well then again, they already kind of have a kryptonite and I think of it because they had the atmosphere

34:02.620 --> 34:05.920
Yeah, I just weakened him down to a regular guy, right? Yeah

34:06.640 --> 34:10.760
But to make a good Superman movie you need to depower Superman

34:11.080 --> 34:14.960
Not to the like not to the point that a regular human could stand up to him

34:15.560 --> 34:17.560
but like to the point that

34:18.360 --> 34:22.400
You know, he would be physically grunting and straining to lift up a bus

34:22.720 --> 34:26.560
He could do it but it'd be like for us deadlifting like 300 pounds

34:27.040 --> 34:28.120
You know

34:28.120 --> 34:30.360
They go the third option together

34:30.360 --> 34:35.000
He would not be able to like fucking bash through 30 buildings with like Zod's face

34:35.000 --> 34:37.840
You just do the third option which is make him the villain

34:38.320 --> 34:41.600
Yeah, you can do that too. But then you have to like well, who's your hero?

34:41.720 --> 34:45.840
Well, then it has to be Lex or it has to be Batman and that turns into a bigger thing

34:45.840 --> 34:52.040
You know, it's fine if they did a very if they actually did something based on red Sun

34:52.840 --> 34:57.960
Which is I wouldn't I wouldn't know I think the best Superman story

34:58.960 --> 35:03.220
Ironically was the Dark Knight strike returns their returns

35:05.640 --> 35:07.640
It's Batman you've read it right

35:08.640 --> 35:14.640
Batman coming at a retirement 20 years later and Superman's a pawn of the government. Yeah, that is one of the best Superman stories

35:15.680 --> 35:19.480
Because he is the antagonist, but he doesn't want to be yeah

35:19.560 --> 35:23.220
But I think with it felt with with red Sun

35:24.280 --> 35:31.560
Because it made him a Soviet agent and just it was such a cool twist on the whole story and the ending of that

35:31.960 --> 35:37.920
Was just it was that was a huge twist. Like it was the ending whether I'm like I tell you I want you to read it

35:37.920 --> 35:39.920
I'm not gonna read it. So just tell me

35:40.400 --> 35:42.400
We'll edit it out. Okay

35:44.880 --> 35:46.880
Regarding Zod

35:47.880 --> 35:52.480
A good villain well-written not the actor for the job and

35:53.880 --> 36:00.120
He is part of a larger problem in Superman movies that if Superman is as powerful as he is

36:00.680 --> 36:06.880
Zod is the only villain that can actually be in the movie. Nobody else works without having something like

36:08.520 --> 36:12.640
Yeah, yeah and which makes Zod kind of get old, you know

36:12.640 --> 36:16.840
The only solution to make a good Superman movie is to depower Superman significantly

36:16.960 --> 36:23.000
Then you can actually have other people have a fighting chance against him. Yeah peep someone who is as powerful as him

36:23.000 --> 36:27.820
There's no inherent drama because you know, he's gonna get smashed through a concrete wall and come out fine

36:28.280 --> 36:30.920
You know, there are there are serious like Kingdom Come

36:32.720 --> 36:34.720
He is older and

36:35.240 --> 36:39.880
His powers aren't as strong anymore. So that's also something that's viable

36:40.760 --> 36:42.560
At least in

36:42.560 --> 36:46.200
Next while even if they've brought the same actor back. I didn't mind him. He was okay

36:46.200 --> 36:51.760
Yeah, he was good. Lois was good too. He looked the part. Yeah. I don't think she looked the part of Lois

36:51.760 --> 36:57.040
She didn't look it but she she's still a decent actress. Yeah, but he looked like super. Oh, yeah

36:57.040 --> 37:01.320
He looked sound and everything. Yeah, like the friggin barrel chest and everything. Yes

37:01.960 --> 37:08.760
And like he acted him. Well, he was written. Well, I think Superman has always it could be he's always been the

37:09.240 --> 37:15.800
Light side hero and he was like he's like the ultimate Boy Scout. Yeah, and he was in this

37:15.960 --> 37:23.080
Yeah, he was yeah, so I mean like there's a lot to improve on but I don't think without

37:23.480 --> 37:28.240
Fundamentally altering what this movie was it could have improved any more than they did, you know

37:28.920 --> 37:35.860
It was it was okay, but for it to be any better they would they would have had to gut and rework the entire thing

37:36.620 --> 37:40.300
You know, there was no quick fixes in this movie to make it better it's essentially

37:41.140 --> 37:45.080
It's it's it's the first two original Superman movies just kind of flung together

37:46.580 --> 37:51.780
There's no Lex Luthor though. That's the origin story plus Zod. Yeah, that's that's what I'm talking about

37:51.780 --> 37:55.580
Yeah, anyway, which makes sense because like Zod like if you're gonna have an origin story

37:55.580 --> 38:00.060
It makes sense to have Zod be the villain of the origin story because Zod is part of the origin

38:00.060 --> 38:05.240
Yeah, you know the fact that technically he is the fact that that was worked in was great. All right, okay

38:05.240 --> 38:06.360
but

38:06.360 --> 38:12.280
Yeah, I guess final final thoughts in this movie. Um, I'm gonna go see it again. So yeah

38:13.520 --> 38:17.700
And I'd I recommend seeing it but like

38:19.640 --> 38:23.420
Like you can't like with Star Trek go with a grain of salt yeah

38:23.800 --> 38:31.120
You can't expect a masterpiece. It's not here. This movie does not have it all together. It's a it's a popcorn movie again. Yeah

38:32.120 --> 38:37.700
Like it's just it's another case of those movies trying to capitalize on the massive success of

38:38.000 --> 38:45.120
Thematically similar movies with similar looking trailers and just failing at it. Yeah, they did not capture the exact matter. You you're not making

38:50.160 --> 38:56.480
Yeah, what wasn't yeah wasn't he like kind of like on the on the books to make a Dark Knight Returns movie I

38:57.480 --> 39:00.960
Think so, he was a guy that made Watchmen. Yeah, and what was good?

39:01.240 --> 39:06.960
It was good, but it was it was again one of those things where it was impossible to bring it across

39:08.120 --> 39:12.000
Perfectly. Yeah, or as close to perfectly as possible. We did a very good job

39:12.000 --> 39:15.020
He did a good job with what he had. He didn't do a good job here. I don't think

39:15.520 --> 39:16.640
Not really

39:16.640 --> 39:23.360
No, and I feel like Christopher Nolan's name was just kind of attached to it just to get fans of the Dark Knight series to

39:23.360 --> 39:27.840
Show up pretty much. Well, you had it. You had a hand in the original script everything, right? So yeah

39:27.840 --> 39:30.220
I wonder what did that look like cuz I'm sure it wasn't like this

39:33.320 --> 39:39.640
Yeah after this we'll talk about trailers dudes, you know, we're gonna trail it up we're gonna eat some trail mix

39:42.240 --> 39:46.520
So Dave tell me about these trailers that you're pulling in the back of your truck

39:46.520 --> 39:54.320
Dev wasn't there for a couple of the trailers. Yeah, I went to get some popcorn. You went to get popcorn

39:55.320 --> 39:58.000
You're late. It was like the same crap as last time

39:58.880 --> 40:03.280
We saw Pacific Rim. There was no GLaDOS voice in it, which is disappointing

40:03.280 --> 40:10.840
No, that wasn't that one. No one was new the other two. It was the snail car bullshit. Yeah turbo the Disney movie and

40:11.840 --> 40:18.280
I actually used to Disney movies and I think of it. What was it? I'm on Ranger again. What's the on Ranger?

40:19.400 --> 40:24.480
So I wasn't there for this one. Obviously the Lone Ranger. It was playing last time

40:26.320 --> 40:30.600
I'm big William tell over church. Did I did it? Did I did it? Did I did it? Yes, Kimo said

40:31.560 --> 40:36.800
Yeah, you know William tell overture is his theme song from the year, you know from the TV show and he had

40:36.960 --> 40:43.480
I don't recall the trailer though. He had an Indian guide friend. I don't recall the trailer. It was Johnny Depp playing

40:44.080 --> 40:46.080
playing tanto

40:46.120 --> 40:49.360
There's a guy who's like his brother gets killed and he swears revenge

40:49.360 --> 40:52.760
And I don't know if he gets like if he gets killed or horribly injured

40:52.760 --> 40:55.960
But I guess I think he gets injured, but he gets healed back like by the local natives

40:55.960 --> 40:59.760
And well, it's very clear that this trailer is of no fucking consequence

40:59.760 --> 41:05.560
No, it's not the movie looks because absolutely stupid because like I can't remember it after twice. Yeah

41:06.120 --> 41:12.880
But then they had that turbo which is a snail who gets nitro. Yeah, he gets he accidentally falls into a

41:14.040 --> 41:21.560
nitrous oxide tank and somehow it just comes like awesome like super fast and joins a team of super fast snails and who somehow

41:21.560 --> 41:23.560
Exist because they have like rockets

41:24.840 --> 41:27.120
And get this he enters NASCAR

41:28.320 --> 41:33.200
my two favorite things snails and horrible CG anthropomorphism and

41:34.040 --> 41:36.040
NASCAR and rednecks

41:36.520 --> 41:38.520
Well, that's part of the NASCAR

41:38.800 --> 41:41.080
And then and then I love my grandmother, but my god

41:41.080 --> 41:46.000
I do not understand her taste in that was that was there really only three trailers that was Pacific Rim

41:46.000 --> 41:50.240
And that was it wasn't that one more Pacific Rim Pacific Rim. I think was the last one

41:50.240 --> 41:53.040
There was one actually know there. I think there was one more that was

41:53.640 --> 41:55.720
Pacific Rim was shit

41:56.600 --> 41:58.600
out of the

41:59.120 --> 42:01.120
Owen man, okay, dude

42:01.400 --> 42:06.400
Our theater sucked like I don't mind it was packed and I don't mind sitting in the front row

42:06.400 --> 42:10.760
That's why it was awful, but there's people like the kids like laughing and screaming in the fucking thing

42:10.760 --> 42:12.840
Yeah, and they were talking. What can you do?

42:13.600 --> 42:18.640
Yeah, like their asses actually there was there was my big complaint was we're too close to scream because it

42:19.320 --> 42:24.480
Shit, I didn't mind it. It's degraded a lot. I like me boy. It was fuzzy man. It was that fuzzy

42:24.480 --> 42:27.940
But like none of the worse music usually you get the full effect the speakers

42:27.940 --> 42:29.740
We didn't which is a good thing in a bad thing

42:29.740 --> 42:35.820
It's it's good that we didn't get our ears blasted tonight is but yeah to the

42:36.620 --> 42:42.340
To the left a couple seats and then far back behind there was just this one woman who sounded middle-aged

42:42.340 --> 42:45.020
Just fucking squawking through the whole fucking movie

42:46.620 --> 42:48.620
Dad this is true. This is trailer talk

42:51.740 --> 42:54.860
Dave if something remarkable happens in the theater

42:54.980 --> 42:59.980
You have a duty to talk about like if a woman runs by and is naked would you talk about it on this deal?

42:59.980 --> 43:02.980
Oh, yeah, because it would be a naked woman in the middle of a theater

43:02.980 --> 43:05.360
But someone talking during a movie is nothing new

43:05.360 --> 43:10.340
But yeah, was that was that really the only trailer was that I think I thought there was one after Pacific Rim

43:10.340 --> 43:16.860
I can't remember. This is why you should write them down. I didn't think there was anything that past Pacific Rim because like this

43:17.420 --> 43:21.660
There's something like in between but really if it was really that of that. Yeah

43:21.660 --> 43:26.060
Like I can't remember it really can't I just I must have just blanked out

43:28.260 --> 43:34.900
Yeah, there's there's nothing coming out anymore this year like this year has had its load blown with Star Trek and

43:35.800 --> 43:41.620
No, there's there's okay. There's the hobbit right at the enders game. Oh, that's right enters game. Yeah, there are there

43:41.860 --> 43:47.920
Actually, there's a list. I was looking I'm stumbling. There's a list of sci-fi and fantasy movies. Well, yes specifically

43:48.420 --> 43:50.420
Isn't Pacific Rim coming out in July?

43:50.540 --> 43:52.540
Yes, it's like July

43:52.660 --> 43:57.020
I'm gonna go do that that one next for this this little thing. We got time. It was good

43:59.140 --> 44:01.540
It's a good place or something like that

44:08.540 --> 44:10.540
Night
