0	9400	Oh man, the last time I talked about Jordan Peterson on this channel, I actually had to
9400	12720	push back against him, despite generally being a fan of his older stuff.
12720	16440	That was during the whole anonymous speech kerfuffle, where he said that anonymity granted
16440	20220	people the right to be cruel online, and that if people are going to comment, they should
20220	21280	be de-masked.
21280	25400	A stance I personally disagree with, as being anonymous is a key component of speaking truth
25400	26400	to power.
26400	29260	And to Jordan Peterson's credit, he did walk this back at least a little bit, saying
29260	33980	that anonymous commenters shouldn't be de-anonymized, but instead put into a lower tier of comments
33980	35660	on Twitter and underneath YouTube videos.
35660	40180	I guess the idea is, if you want to wade into the anonymous muck, it's not censored per
40180	42060	se, it's just on the second page.
42060	46760	Peterson does seem to have a habit of sometimes being unnecessarily hyperbolic.
46760	49940	It happened again with the event that launched him into prominence in the first place, the
49940	53020	claim that misgendering people will be made illegal in Canada.
53020	54780	It turned out that wasn't fully accurate.
54780	59540	Bill 16 was poorly worded, such that it could mean that misgendering would be illegal, but
59540	63780	it was also worded such that a reasonable person would likely conclude that it didn't.
63780	68740	What the bill did was add to Canada's hate crime laws gender identity and gender expression.
68740	72100	So while speech does not constitute a hate crime in Canada, you're not going to get
72100	75420	arrested for misgendering any more than you are for using a slur.
75420	81020	What it did change was that crimes that could be hate crimes now also protected gender stuff.
81020	85300	So for example, if a racist murdered a black man because he's black, the hatred is an
85300	90620	aggravating factor, and the new law simply added gender to that list of protected characteristics.
90620	94420	Whether you agree with that or not, the truth is, we're five years on and nobody is getting
94420	98540	thrown in jail for misgendering a random trans passerby on the street.
98540	103420	So I have a feeling that Jordan Peterson might be being a bit more hyperbolic when it comes
103420	105140	to the topic of today's video.
105140	106140	Breaking!
106140	110460	The Ontario College of Psychologists has demanded that I submit myself to mandatory social media
110460	115020	communication retraining with their experts for, among other crimes, retweeting Pierre
115020	118620	Poliev and criticizing Justin Trudeau and his political allies.
118620	121900	That's the new Conservative leader in Canada, by the way, who seems to be on track to unseat
121900	123060	Trudeau in the next election.
123060	124060	He's quite popular.
124060	127980	I am to take a course of such training, with reports documenting my progress, or face an
127980	132300	in-person tribunal in suspension of my right to operate as a licensed clinical psychologist.
132300	135500	About a dozen people from all over the world submitted complaints about my public statements
135500	139420	on Twitter and Joe Rogan over a four-year period, out of the 15 million who follow me
139420	143300	in social media, claiming that I had harmed people, not them, with my views.
143300	147300	In its wisdom, the Ontario College of Psychologists decided to pursue these complaints even though
147300	149060	they could have dismissed them as vexatious.
149060	152380	I've been accused of harming people, although none of the complaints involved in the current
152380	156500	action were clients of mine, past or present, or were even acquainted with my clients.
156500	160020	We are now in a situation in Canada under Justin Trudeau where practicing professionals
160020	164300	can have their livelihoods and public reputations threatened in a very serious manner for agreeing
164300	167660	with the official opposition and criticizing major government figures.
167660	171260	If I comply, the terms of my re-education and my punishment will be announced publicly.
171260	174860	I have already had the second most serious category of punishment levied against me and
174860	176860	have been deemed at high risk to re-offend.
176860	181900	Canadians, your physicians, lawyers, psychologists, and other professionals are now so intimidated
181900	184580	by their commissar overlords that they fear to tell you the truth.
184580	188860	This means that your care and legal counsel has been rendered dangerously unreliable.
188860	192920	To reiterate, I face public disgrace, mandatory political re-education, disciplinary hearing
192920	196860	and potential loss of my clinical licensing for agreeing with Pierre Polyev and criticizing
196860	198660	our standing PM Justin Trudeau.
198660	202940	I am willing, if the Ontario College of Psychologists occurs, which they won't, to make absolutely
202940	206460	every word of all of this fully public so that everyone can decide for themselves what's
206460	207460	actually happening.
207460	210900	To clarify, it's been decided, I either submit Jesus, okay you don't have to repeat
210900	214200	it this many times, but that certainly sounds like a political witch hunt, doesn't it?
214200	218140	This event naturally made headlines, in both Canada and elsewhere, with Polyev even making
218140	221060	a video on his campaign channel supporting Justin Peterson's case.
221060	223400	Now, on some level this doesn't actually matter that much.
223400	226560	Jordan Peterson has moved out of the clinical space ever since blowing up.
226560	230000	Being discredited by the Ontario College of Psychologists means he cannot practice
230000	231120	in Ontario anymore.
231120	234160	But he's still got his other businesses and his income, his education and experience,
234160	235160	and his name.
235160	238020	He no longer depends on the college for his livelihood, and he can move forward without
238020	239160	them if he likes.
239160	242200	In essence, he's reached escape velocity from that system.
242200	246060	No punishment they can impose on him will do anything except tarnish his honor.
246060	248560	At the same time, though, honor seems to be pretty important to him.
248560	250920	So I'm not surprised he's not taking this lying down.
250920	255000	I wanted to see how much of Jordan Peterson's characterization of these events is actually
255000	256000	true.
256440	259700	Here are the complaint forms sent to the College of Psychologists of Ontario.
259700	260700	These are pretty detailed.
260700	263280	You don't need to go too deep into them, but I'll point out a few relevant things
263280	264280	on each.
264280	268040	The first complaint, on January 5, 2022, was from a person who falsely claimed to be one
268040	269480	of Jordan Peterson's clients.
269480	272880	The complaint says that he encouraged people to commit suicide on Twitter, with a Twitter
272880	273880	link attached.
273880	278100	An email attached to the complaint references the US National Association of Social Workers
278100	282000	Code of Ethics, while saying, I'm sure Canada's is similar, which makes it pretty obvious
282000	285500	that this person was not actually a client of Peterson's Toronto practice.
285500	289440	The tweet in question is Peterson replying to the message, based on the record of human
289440	292400	behavior, we are already overpopulating this small world.
292400	295920	Any arguments I've heard for supporting such a large human population completely overlook
295920	300240	the huge loss of species and ecosystems resulting from our self-absorbed attention.
300240	302620	By saying, you're free to leave at any point.
302620	305860	This is apparently encouraging people to commit suicide on Twitter.
305860	309680	You know, the leftoids talk about nasty population as a good thing all the time, but this is
309680	311060	what gets under their skin, eh?
311060	312800	It's clearly just a partisan game.
312800	317080	The second complaint, on February 18th, 2022, was also from a person who falsely claimed
317080	318560	to be one of Peterson's clients.
318560	321960	This time it was about the trucker protests, yes I know it's in the render queue, specifically
321960	325680	the news that the Children's Aid Society would be involved in removing any children at the
325680	327840	protest after their parents had been arrested.
327840	332160	The spirit of Peterson's objection is that because, in his view, the protest was legitimate
332160	335920	and the government crackdown on it was tyrannical overreach, that the government also moving
335920	340400	to intercept the children of protesters constituted the state breaking apart families as political
340400	341400	punishment.
341400	344180	I wouldn't say that, but that's what I see reading between the lines.
344180	348800	According to the complaint, this opinion undermined faith in Peterson's ability to be a mandatory
348800	353080	reporter of child abuse to the proper authorities, which made him ineligible to be a clinical
353080	354080	psychologist.
354080	358140	The third complaint, on February 4th, 2022, was again from a person who falsely claimed
358140	359780	to be one of Peterson's clients.
359780	362520	This time it was about Peterson's appearances on the Joe Rogan experience.
362520	365460	This complaint is extremely long and ridiculously nitpicky.
365460	370840	They're outlining statements from the first hour of Joe Rogan episode 1769 that are problematic,
370840	374820	unethical, or unprofessional, and that there's just as many instances in every other Peterson
374820	375820	public appearance.
375820	378880	I'm not going to go over all of these, even I'm not as autistic as this guy.
378880	380200	You can pause if you want to see them all.
380200	381600	But listen to some of this stuff.
381600	385400	This person's complaining that Peterson is critiquing Marxism, that he claimed Japanese
385400	389320	cars rust more than American ones, and that drunk monkeys are funny.
389320	391200	How are these reasonable complaints?
391200	395620	The fourth complaint, on February 9th, 2022, was via a phone call and the transcript appears
395620	398300	to indicate that this was from a fellow psychologist.
398300	399560	He cites much the same stuff.
399560	403440	Twitter posts, appearances on Joe Rogan, how he embarrasses the college, and the profession
403440	404560	associated with it.
404560	408680	More specifically, this person cites a particularly inflammatory public back-and-forth Peterson
408680	412560	had with Gerald Butts, a former secretary to the Prime Minister of Canada, as well as
412560	417720	his calling Catherine McKenney, a non-binary they-them candidate for Ottawa mayor in 2022,
417720	420400	an appalling self-righteous moralizing thing.
420400	424580	Finally, this person took umbrage at Jordan Peterson's claim that Nazis and white supremacists
424580	428640	do not exist in Canada, there is no culture of such things in Canada, political or otherwise.
428720	432180	That's not exactly true, but unironically, there's probably only a few hundred actual
432180	436440	Nazis in the 30 million population nation of Canada.
436440	440840	The fifth complaint, on May 17th, 2022, was also from a person who falsely claimed to
440840	442040	be one of Peterson's clients.
442040	446640	This complaint contained nothing except the statement, this man has been online bullying
446640	450160	and harassing a 24-year-old model.
450160	451560	He has been trending since yesterday.
451560	452560	This is not the first time.
452560	453940	Why is he still registered with you?
453940	457480	How is hateful, racist, and and a misogynistic bully?
457480	458900	How is he allowed to stay registered?
458900	459960	Why this special treatment?
459960	461760	Jesus Christ, get off Twitter.
461760	465960	The sixth complaint, on May 18th, 2022, was also from a person who falsely claimed to
465960	467080	be one of Peterson's clients.
467080	470460	This complaint revolves around the same incident as the previous one, but with a little bit
470460	471960	more meat on the bone.
471960	478520	On Twitter, Jordan Peterson used his quote, doctoral position to attack a woman in the
478520	479520	public sphere.
479520	482440	He said she wasn't beautiful, oh my God, the crime.
482440	486000	He said society was being forced to accept fat people as attractive.
486000	489720	He used clinical studies to try and prove he was correct and she did not meet the definition
489720	491000	or standard of beauty.
491000	493280	This is incredibly dangerous and irresponsible behavior.
493280	496520	You know, before on Twitter I taught people how to heat up crack in the microwave, now
496520	498300	I can't even call a fat bitch fat.
498300	502760	The seventh complaint, on July 4th, 2022, was, you guessed it, also from a person who
502760	505020	falsely claimed to be one of Peterson's clients.
505020	508760	This time, it was about the Elliot Page situation, though the name Elliot Page is never used,
508760	509920	the context lines up.
509920	513720	The claim is that Peterson's video on the topic brings disrepute on psychologists and
513720	515640	causes direct harm to minorities.
515680	519480	The funniest bit is where they say I am a psychologist in Australia and we have clear
519480	524000	rules about psychologists being deregistered should they bring disrepute onto the profession
524000	525000	or engage in hate speech.
525000	527680	Well, why the fuck did you claim to be one of his clients then?
527680	532960	The eighth complaint, on July 11th, 2022, was, surprise surprise, also from a person
532960	536840	who falsely claimed to be one of his clients, even though they immediately began their paragraph
536840	541200	with as a member of the general public, also revolved around Elliot Page, specifically
541200	544680	leaning on Jordan Peterson's Twitter ban to make the point that he should also be banned
544680	546280	from psychology, I guessed.
546280	549720	The ninth complaint, July 4th, 2022, same thing, falsely claimed to be a client, outrage
549720	552960	over Elliot Page, it's all the same whiny nonsense, same with the tenth complaint, and
552960	555120	that's all the ones I can find, at least from 2022.
555120	558240	There are older complaints from years ago that Peterson's talked about, but those
558240	559400	have all been resolved.
559400	564440	This bundle of ten complaints are the ones specifically attached to this retraining request.
564440	568160	Though the complaints seem to be politically motivated partisan hackery, not worth the
568160	572560	paper they're printed on, I have to point out, not one of them mentioned Peterson's
572560	574600	support of Pierre Polyaive as a reason.
574600	577720	Maybe I missed something, but as far as I can tell, the claim that this retraining from
577720	582300	the Ontario College of Psychologists is specifically due to Peterson's retweeting and support
582300	587080	of the leader of Canada's Conservative Party seems to only come from Peterson himself.
587080	591480	It would indeed be extremely worrying if supporting a politician that a licensing body doesn't
591480	595720	like is the reason your license is challenged, but that doesn't seem to be happening here.
595720	599720	What is happening is that Peterson's public statements and opinions about several news
599720	604040	cycle events, from the fat activist stuff to Elliot Page to the trucker protests, have
604040	607800	all offended the Twitterati's enough that they're doing the cancel culture thing with
607800	609880	the Ontario College of Psychologists.
609880	612880	Even though Pierre Polyaive doesn't seem to actually be involved, this is still pretty
612880	617280	worrying because it's still threatening to de-license people for their political beliefs.
617280	621560	The steel man of the other side of this argument is that, while a country like Canada has the
621560	625280	freedom of expression enshrined in the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, meaning that Jordan
625280	629560	Peterson has the right to say any of these things without being legally punished by the
629560	634280	state, there is still a necessary code of conduct for nearly every licensing body and
634280	635540	profession out there.
635540	639460	If a profession is governed by a licensing body, and that governance is necessary because
639460	643620	that profession requires public trust in order to function, it seems to be reasonable that
643620	648020	adhering to a code of conduct be a requirement of holding a license, and failing to adhere
648020	650080	to it should be grounds for de-licensing.
650080	652760	But that means that there are two more factors to consider.
652760	658400	One, does the licensing body in question uphold that necessary public trust, and is that public
658400	661240	trust actually necessary for that profession to function?
661240	665300	With psychologists, the answer to both of these questions seems to be yes.
665300	669360	For example, if Jordan Peterson was caught multiple times running naked down the street
669360	674840	holding a banner saying, I am a licensed clinical psychologist, per the Ontario College of Psychologists,
674840	678520	not many people would object to him losing the license, so as to not bring the entire
678520	680440	psychology endeavor down with him.
680440	684120	The obvious reply to that is, well, streaking's illegal, that's why you should lose your
684120	685120	job.
685120	686160	But I actually don't agree with that.
686160	689000	Did you actually lose your job just for breaking a law?
689000	691920	What if that same streaker worked for McDonald's and streaked on his off time?
691920	695200	Yeah, if you go to jail for streaking, that means you're a no-show at your workplace,
695200	697180	but then you're losing your job for not showing up.
697180	701880	In my opinion, the act of streaking itself shouldn't be a fireable offense for McDonald's
701880	704720	as long as you do it off the clock, even though it's illegal.
704720	707760	The difference between these two examples, disregarding the fact that McDonald's workers
707760	712600	don't have a licensing body, is that no public trust needs to be upheld for McDonald's
712600	713600	workers.
713600	717020	If McDonald's workers break the law outside the workplace, and nonetheless can still fulfill
717020	719560	their job, then fine, they shouldn't get fired.
719560	724980	But public trust does need to be upheld for psychology, making some sort of standard reasonable.
724980	728760	The second factor to consider is whether or not Jordan Peterson's comments actually
728760	732040	constitute bringing the profession of psychology into disrepute.
732040	735980	This is the tough one, and the answer to it is going to necessarily be a political one.
735980	740660	For example, somebody who is very anti-trans will consider the college's pro-trans stance
740660	744700	to already bring it into disrepute, and will also consider Jordan Peterson's comments
744700	748740	as not nearly as extreme of a course correction as is needed.
748740	752520	The issue, ultimately, is that on the topics that Jordan Peterson is talking about, they
752520	754680	are not settled in the minds of the public.
754680	757900	It's not like he's saying, rape is good or something, where everyone thinks that rape
757900	762580	is bad and he's just a lone person who is wholly out of line with society's expectations.
762580	766380	There's a lot of good faith disagreement in all three of the Ts here, truckers, trannies,
766380	767580	and tubs.
767580	772180	Political people do disagree with the progressive view on these topics in large enough numbers
772180	776660	to be considered an identifiable political block, and not just one outlying nutjob.
776660	780180	The college has publicly released their decision and their reasons behind it.
780180	783500	This is a long and very formal document, so I'll just summarize it for you.
783500	788260	On August 4, 2022, five months before this story went viral, Jordan Peterson was made
788260	792540	aware of the complaints, and the college asked him to engage in what they call an Acknowledgement
792540	796420	and Undertaking, which was a six-month course involving retraining.
796420	800540	Peterson responded on September 6, claiming he didn't need to engage with the college's
800540	803480	request to resolve the complaints, because he had already done so on his own, by hiring
803480	807100	a social media team to make sure he doesn't fly off the handle again online.
807100	810940	The college rejected this course correction as being sufficient, and requested again that
810940	814740	Peterson voluntarily submit to the retraining on September 13.
814740	818980	On September 27, Peterson's lawyer replied, asking for details about the retraining.
818980	821980	On October 7, the college replied, providing information.
821980	826620	The retraining process requires Jordan Peterson to, at his own cost, engage the services of
826620	831180	a coaching program approved of by the college within three months of receiving their judgment,
831180	833580	and complete the program within 12 months.
833580	837380	While the information provided by the college outlines the responsibilities of Peterson,
837380	841300	the coach, and the college in this matter, it does not actually describe what the coaching
841300	846260	process entails, other than reviewing, reflecting on, and ameliorating his professionalism in
846260	847480	public statements.
847480	851920	On October 21, Peterson again declined to engage with the retraining process.
851920	855560	In response, the college has determined that he is required to engage with it.
855560	858960	The documents don't explicitly say he will lose his license if he refuses again, but
858960	862720	it's certainly implied, now that the language has moved to required, and the official punishment
862720	866900	is an allegation of professional misconduct and a subsequent disciplinary action.
866900	870760	Their reasoning is that his public statements are inconsistent with the professional standards,
870760	874720	policies, and ethics currently adopted by the college, that his statements pose a moderate
874720	878320	risk to the public through undermining public trust in the profession, as well as trust
878320	880680	in the college's ability to regulate that profession.
880680	882660	Which is pretty much exactly what I said it would be earlier.
882660	887120	The college also noted that Peterson was already given a slap on the wrist in 2020 for previous
887120	891320	inflammatory remarks on Twitter, where he was told that as a registered member of the
891320	894960	college, and in light of your public profile, you may wish to offer your opinions and comments
894960	898560	in a respectful tone, in order to avoid a negative perception towards the profession
898560	899560	of psychology.
899560	903520	At the end of the day, while I ultimately side more with Jordan Peterson than the college
903520	905420	here, he is not blameless.
905420	909200	Nowhere in any of the documents that I've read does it say that Peterson is being punished
909200	911900	for his support of conservative leader, Pierre Poliev.
911900	915440	Not once did Poliev or the Conservative Party even come up in the documents.
915440	919320	And yet that is what Peterson made the centerpiece of his public statement on this event.
919320	923600	The truth is, Poliev is a rising star in Canada right now, riding a wave of popularity, and
923600	925760	is likely to unseat Trudeau in the next election.
925760	929100	So Peterson hitching his current affairs to that train is good strategy.
929100	932440	The only problem is, there is no evidence of it actually being true.
932440	936800	Moreover, Peterson does seem to be developing a pattern of being, let's say, unnecessarily
936800	941000	quick to act about some things in ways that he was not back in 2015.
941000	944000	Between this, and the anonymous thing, and the Elliot Page thing, which I didn't think
944000	947400	was a very good take frankly, his frequent Twitter spats, hell, the fact that when he
947400	951700	initially blew up, he unceremoniously abandoned his private clients, even telling one of them
951700	955560	he was too sick to attend their session when he was actually going on TV instead.
955560	956980	This is a pattern of behavior.
956980	960800	Jordan Peterson once said on a podcast somewhere that social media wasn't good for him, it
960800	963180	was making him rash, angry, and depressed.
963180	966400	He knows this, because in his initial appeal to the college, he made the claim that he's
966400	970040	employing people to help him with his social media presence, meaning that he knows that
970040	973340	by his own standard, there's at least some problem with his conduct.
973340	975860	Maybe not what he's saying, but how he's choosing to say it.
975860	977660	He knows he's not innocent in this.
977660	980540	The far greater issue, though, is the college.
980540	984200	Even though it does seem to be reasonable that to be a part of a voluntary association,
984200	988240	you have to choose to abide by the association's rules, and it also does seem to be reasonable
988240	992280	that one of the rules of the association is, don't destroy the association's reputation
992280	994000	by making an ass of yourself in public.
994000	995000	That's all fair.
995000	999040	The issue isn't that the college has standards, but rather what standards it's chosen.
999040	1002160	Look at the rules that the college claim Peterson has violated.
1002160	1003160	1.
1003160	1006920	Demonstrate appropriate respect for the knowledge, insight, experience, areas of expertise, and
1006920	1010400	cultural perspectives and values of others, including those that are different from their
1010400	1014080	own, limited only by those that seriously contravene the ethical principles of this
1014080	1015080	code.
1015080	1016080	2.
1016080	1019140	Not engage publicly in public statements, presentations, research reports with primary
1019140	1023320	clients or other contacts in degrading comments about others, including demeaning jokes based
1023320	1028120	on such characteristics as culture, nationality, ethnicity, color, race, religion, sex, gender,
1028120	1029400	or sexual orientation.
1029400	1030400	3.
1030400	1033920	Strive to use language that conveys respect for the dignity of persons and peoples as
1033920	1038040	much as possible in all spoken, written, electronic, or printed communications.
1038040	1039040	4.
1039040	1041960	Abstain from all forms of harassment, including sexual harassment.
1041960	1042960	5.
1042960	1046500	Avoid or refuse to participate in practices disrespectful of the moral rights of persons
1046500	1049600	or peoples, including their human, legal, and civil rights.
1049600	1050600	9.
1050600	1055280	Not practice, condone, facilitate, or collaborate with any form of unjust discrimination.
1055280	1059280	Has Jordan Peterson actually violated any of these rules as they are written?
1059280	1060280	1.
1060280	1061280	It's possible.
1061280	1062280	2.
1062280	1063280	For sure.
1063280	1064280	3.
1064280	1065280	Maybe.
1065280	1066280	4.
1066280	1067280	Absolutely not.
1067280	1068280	5.
1068280	1069280	It's impossibly broad.
1069280	1070280	Same with 9.
1070280	1071280	The more important question is, though, are these good rules?
1071280	1073400	Even if Peterson violated one or all of them, are these rules fit for purpose?
1073400	1076360	Are they universally agreed upon by members of the college, other than Peterson?
1076360	1077360	Maybe.
1077360	1078360	I don't know.
1078360	1081360	Absolutely agreed upon by members of the general public, who the college appeals to
1081360	1083500	as protecting them with this action.
1083500	1084500	Absolutely not.
1084500	1089240	Rules 1, 2, and 3 butt up against freedom of expression, and there is a good faith negotiation
1089240	1093060	to be had between those two contrasting principles, though I'm not sure the college is capable
1093060	1094060	of having it.
1094060	1095060	4.
1095060	1098240	Seems to be wholly inappropriate, and I can only assume that it was brought up to tarnish
1098240	1099240	Peterson's reputation.
1099240	1104340	5 and 9 are so broad that they seem designed to be wielded as political cudgels.
1104340	1107660	Though Jordan Peterson is not innocent here, he shouldn't have lied to make his story
1107660	1111060	blow up, and in a more general sense, he needs to tone down the hyperbole.
1111060	1112880	I've been saying this since he came out of his coma.
1112880	1117420	I do ultimately think the College of Psychologists of Ontario is the larger problem here.
1117420	1121660	This is not the political witch hunt that Jordan Peterson said it was, but it is a different
1121660	1125320	type of political witch hunt, and Peterson made it that much easier for them by being
1125320	1126960	inflammatory online.
1126960	1130060	As it is with literally everything, using Twitter is the problem.
