1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,400
Oh man, the last time I talked about Jordan Peterson on this channel, I actually had to

2
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:12,720
push back against him, despite generally being a fan of his older stuff.

3
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:16,440
That was during the whole anonymous speech kerfuffle, where he said that anonymity granted

4
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:20,220
people the right to be cruel online, and that if people are going to comment, they should

5
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:21,280
be de-masked.

6
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:25,400
A stance I personally disagree with, as being anonymous is a key component of speaking truth

7
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:26,400
to power.

8
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:29,260
And to Jordan Peterson's credit, he did walk this back at least a little bit, saying

9
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:33,980
that anonymous commenters shouldn't be de-anonymized, but instead put into a lower tier of comments

10
00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:35,660
on Twitter and underneath YouTube videos.

11
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:40,180
I guess the idea is, if you want to wade into the anonymous muck, it's not censored per

12
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:42,060
se, it's just on the second page.

13
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:46,760
Peterson does seem to have a habit of sometimes being unnecessarily hyperbolic.

14
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:49,940
It happened again with the event that launched him into prominence in the first place, the

15
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:53,020
claim that misgendering people will be made illegal in Canada.

16
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:54,780
It turned out that wasn't fully accurate.

17
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:59,540
Bill 16 was poorly worded, such that it could mean that misgendering would be illegal, but

18
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:03,780
it was also worded such that a reasonable person would likely conclude that it didn't.

19
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:08,740
What the bill did was add to Canada's hate crime laws gender identity and gender expression.

20
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:12,100
So while speech does not constitute a hate crime in Canada, you're not going to get

21
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:15,420
arrested for misgendering any more than you are for using a slur.

22
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:21,020
What it did change was that crimes that could be hate crimes now also protected gender stuff.

23
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:25,300
So for example, if a racist murdered a black man because he's black, the hatred is an

24
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:30,620
aggravating factor, and the new law simply added gender to that list of protected characteristics.

25
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:34,420
Whether you agree with that or not, the truth is, we're five years on and nobody is getting

26
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:38,540
thrown in jail for misgendering a random trans passerby on the street.

27
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:43,420
So I have a feeling that Jordan Peterson might be being a bit more hyperbolic when it comes

28
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:45,140
to the topic of today's video.

29
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:46,140
Breaking!

30
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:50,460
The Ontario College of Psychologists has demanded that I submit myself to mandatory social media

31
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:55,020
communication retraining with their experts for, among other crimes, retweeting Pierre

32
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:58,620
Poliev and criticizing Justin Trudeau and his political allies.

33
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:01,900
That's the new Conservative leader in Canada, by the way, who seems to be on track to unseat

34
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:03,060
Trudeau in the next election.

35
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:04,060
He's quite popular.

36
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:07,980
I am to take a course of such training, with reports documenting my progress, or face an

37
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:12,300
in-person tribunal in suspension of my right to operate as a licensed clinical psychologist.

38
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:15,500
About a dozen people from all over the world submitted complaints about my public statements

39
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:19,420
on Twitter and Joe Rogan over a four-year period, out of the 15 million who follow me

40
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:23,300
in social media, claiming that I had harmed people, not them, with my views.

41
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:27,300
In its wisdom, the Ontario College of Psychologists decided to pursue these complaints even though

42
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:29,060
they could have dismissed them as vexatious.

43
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:32,380
I've been accused of harming people, although none of the complaints involved in the current

44
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:36,500
action were clients of mine, past or present, or were even acquainted with my clients.

45
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:40,020
We are now in a situation in Canada under Justin Trudeau where practicing professionals

46
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:44,300
can have their livelihoods and public reputations threatened in a very serious manner for agreeing

47
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:47,660
with the official opposition and criticizing major government figures.

48
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:51,260
If I comply, the terms of my re-education and my punishment will be announced publicly.

49
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:54,860
I have already had the second most serious category of punishment levied against me and

50
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:56,860
have been deemed at high risk to re-offend.

51
00:02:56,860 --> 00:03:01,900
Canadians, your physicians, lawyers, psychologists, and other professionals are now so intimidated

52
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:04,580
by their commissar overlords that they fear to tell you the truth.

53
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:08,860
This means that your care and legal counsel has been rendered dangerously unreliable.

54
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:12,920
To reiterate, I face public disgrace, mandatory political re-education, disciplinary hearing

55
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:16,860
and potential loss of my clinical licensing for agreeing with Pierre Polyev and criticizing

56
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:18,660
our standing PM Justin Trudeau.

57
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:22,940
I am willing, if the Ontario College of Psychologists occurs, which they won't, to make absolutely

58
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:26,460
every word of all of this fully public so that everyone can decide for themselves what's

59
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:27,460
actually happening.

60
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:30,900
To clarify, it's been decided, I either submit Jesus, okay you don't have to repeat

61
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:34,200
it this many times, but that certainly sounds like a political witch hunt, doesn't it?

62
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:38,140
This event naturally made headlines, in both Canada and elsewhere, with Polyev even making

63
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:41,060
a video on his campaign channel supporting Justin Peterson's case.

64
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:43,400
Now, on some level this doesn't actually matter that much.

65
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:46,560
Jordan Peterson has moved out of the clinical space ever since blowing up.

66
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:50,000
Being discredited by the Ontario College of Psychologists means he cannot practice

67
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,120
in Ontario anymore.

68
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:54,160
But he's still got his other businesses and his income, his education and experience,

69
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:55,160
and his name.

70
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:58,020
He no longer depends on the college for his livelihood, and he can move forward without

71
00:03:58,020 --> 00:03:59,160
them if he likes.

72
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:02,200
In essence, he's reached escape velocity from that system.

73
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:06,060
No punishment they can impose on him will do anything except tarnish his honor.

74
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:08,560
At the same time, though, honor seems to be pretty important to him.

75
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,920
So I'm not surprised he's not taking this lying down.

76
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:15,000
I wanted to see how much of Jordan Peterson's characterization of these events is actually

77
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
true.

78
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:19,700
Here are the complaint forms sent to the College of Psychologists of Ontario.

79
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:20,700
These are pretty detailed.

80
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:23,280
You don't need to go too deep into them, but I'll point out a few relevant things

81
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:24,280
on each.

82
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:28,040
The first complaint, on January 5, 2022, was from a person who falsely claimed to be one

83
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,480
of Jordan Peterson's clients.

84
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:32,880
The complaint says that he encouraged people to commit suicide on Twitter, with a Twitter

85
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:33,880
link attached.

86
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:38,100
An email attached to the complaint references the US National Association of Social Workers

87
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:42,000
Code of Ethics, while saying, I'm sure Canada's is similar, which makes it pretty obvious

88
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,500
that this person was not actually a client of Peterson's Toronto practice.

89
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:49,440
The tweet in question is Peterson replying to the message, based on the record of human

90
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:52,400
behavior, we are already overpopulating this small world.

91
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:55,920
Any arguments I've heard for supporting such a large human population completely overlook

92
00:04:55,920 --> 00:05:00,240
the huge loss of species and ecosystems resulting from our self-absorbed attention.

93
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,620
By saying, you're free to leave at any point.

94
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:05,860
This is apparently encouraging people to commit suicide on Twitter.

95
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:09,680
You know, the leftoids talk about nasty population as a good thing all the time, but this is

96
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,060
what gets under their skin, eh?

97
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:12,800
It's clearly just a partisan game.

98
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:17,080
The second complaint, on February 18th, 2022, was also from a person who falsely claimed

99
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:18,560
to be one of Peterson's clients.

100
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:21,960
This time it was about the trucker protests, yes I know it's in the render queue, specifically

101
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:25,680
the news that the Children's Aid Society would be involved in removing any children at the

102
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,840
protest after their parents had been arrested.

103
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:32,160
The spirit of Peterson's objection is that because, in his view, the protest was legitimate

104
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:35,920
and the government crackdown on it was tyrannical overreach, that the government also moving

105
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:40,400
to intercept the children of protesters constituted the state breaking apart families as political

106
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:41,400
punishment.

107
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:44,180
I wouldn't say that, but that's what I see reading between the lines.

108
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:48,800
According to the complaint, this opinion undermined faith in Peterson's ability to be a mandatory

109
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:53,080
reporter of child abuse to the proper authorities, which made him ineligible to be a clinical

110
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:54,080
psychologist.

111
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:58,140
The third complaint, on February 4th, 2022, was again from a person who falsely claimed

112
00:05:58,140 --> 00:05:59,780
to be one of Peterson's clients.

113
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:02,520
This time it was about Peterson's appearances on the Joe Rogan experience.

114
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:05,460
This complaint is extremely long and ridiculously nitpicky.

115
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:10,840
They're outlining statements from the first hour of Joe Rogan episode 1769 that are problematic,

116
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:14,820
unethical, or unprofessional, and that there's just as many instances in every other Peterson

117
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:15,820
public appearance.

118
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:18,880
I'm not going to go over all of these, even I'm not as autistic as this guy.

119
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,200
You can pause if you want to see them all.

120
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,600
But listen to some of this stuff.

121
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:25,400
This person's complaining that Peterson is critiquing Marxism, that he claimed Japanese

122
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:29,320
cars rust more than American ones, and that drunk monkeys are funny.

123
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:31,200
How are these reasonable complaints?

124
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:35,620
The fourth complaint, on February 9th, 2022, was via a phone call and the transcript appears

125
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:38,300
to indicate that this was from a fellow psychologist.

126
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:39,560
He cites much the same stuff.

127
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:43,440
Twitter posts, appearances on Joe Rogan, how he embarrasses the college, and the profession

128
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,560
associated with it.

129
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:48,680
More specifically, this person cites a particularly inflammatory public back-and-forth Peterson

130
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:52,560
had with Gerald Butts, a former secretary to the Prime Minister of Canada, as well as

131
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:57,720
his calling Catherine McKenney, a non-binary they-them candidate for Ottawa mayor in 2022,

132
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:00,400
an appalling self-righteous moralizing thing.

133
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:04,580
Finally, this person took umbrage at Jordan Peterson's claim that Nazis and white supremacists

134
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:08,640
do not exist in Canada, there is no culture of such things in Canada, political or otherwise.

135
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:12,180
That's not exactly true, but unironically, there's probably only a few hundred actual

136
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:16,440
Nazis in the 30 million population nation of Canada.

137
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:20,840
The fifth complaint, on May 17th, 2022, was also from a person who falsely claimed to

138
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:22,040
be one of Peterson's clients.

139
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:26,640
This complaint contained nothing except the statement, this man has been online bullying

140
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:30,160
and harassing a 24-year-old model.

141
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,560
He has been trending since yesterday.

142
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:32,560
This is not the first time.

143
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,940
Why is he still registered with you?

144
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:37,480
How is hateful, racist, and and a misogynistic bully?

145
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:38,900
How is he allowed to stay registered?

146
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:39,960
Why this special treatment?

147
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,760
Jesus Christ, get off Twitter.

148
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:45,960
The sixth complaint, on May 18th, 2022, was also from a person who falsely claimed to

149
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:47,080
be one of Peterson's clients.

150
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:50,460
This complaint revolves around the same incident as the previous one, but with a little bit

151
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:51,960
more meat on the bone.

152
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:58,520
On Twitter, Jordan Peterson used his quote, doctoral position to attack a woman in the

153
00:07:58,520 --> 00:07:59,520
public sphere.

154
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:02,440
He said she wasn't beautiful, oh my God, the crime.

155
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:06,000
He said society was being forced to accept fat people as attractive.

156
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,720
He used clinical studies to try and prove he was correct and she did not meet the definition

157
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,000
or standard of beauty.

158
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,280
This is incredibly dangerous and irresponsible behavior.

159
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:16,520
You know, before on Twitter I taught people how to heat up crack in the microwave, now

160
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:18,300
I can't even call a fat bitch fat.

161
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:22,760
The seventh complaint, on July 4th, 2022, was, you guessed it, also from a person who

162
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:25,020
falsely claimed to be one of Peterson's clients.

163
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:28,760
This time, it was about the Elliot Page situation, though the name Elliot Page is never used,

164
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:29,920
the context lines up.

165
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:33,720
The claim is that Peterson's video on the topic brings disrepute on psychologists and

166
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:35,640
causes direct harm to minorities.

167
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:39,480
The funniest bit is where they say I am a psychologist in Australia and we have clear

168
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:44,000
rules about psychologists being deregistered should they bring disrepute onto the profession

169
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
or engage in hate speech.

170
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,680
Well, why the fuck did you claim to be one of his clients then?

171
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:52,960
The eighth complaint, on July 11th, 2022, was, surprise surprise, also from a person

172
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:56,840
who falsely claimed to be one of his clients, even though they immediately began their paragraph

173
00:08:56,840 --> 00:09:01,200
with as a member of the general public, also revolved around Elliot Page, specifically

174
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:04,680
leaning on Jordan Peterson's Twitter ban to make the point that he should also be banned

175
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:06,280
from psychology, I guessed.

176
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:09,720
The ninth complaint, July 4th, 2022, same thing, falsely claimed to be a client, outrage

177
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:12,960
over Elliot Page, it's all the same whiny nonsense, same with the tenth complaint, and

178
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:15,120
that's all the ones I can find, at least from 2022.

179
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:18,240
There are older complaints from years ago that Peterson's talked about, but those

180
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,400
have all been resolved.

181
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:24,440
This bundle of ten complaints are the ones specifically attached to this retraining request.

182
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:28,160
Though the complaints seem to be politically motivated partisan hackery, not worth the

183
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:32,560
paper they're printed on, I have to point out, not one of them mentioned Peterson's

184
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,600
support of Pierre Polyaive as a reason.

185
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:37,720
Maybe I missed something, but as far as I can tell, the claim that this retraining from

186
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:42,300
the Ontario College of Psychologists is specifically due to Peterson's retweeting and support

187
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:47,080
of the leader of Canada's Conservative Party seems to only come from Peterson himself.

188
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:51,480
It would indeed be extremely worrying if supporting a politician that a licensing body doesn't

189
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:55,720
like is the reason your license is challenged, but that doesn't seem to be happening here.

190
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:59,720
What is happening is that Peterson's public statements and opinions about several news

191
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:04,040
cycle events, from the fat activist stuff to Elliot Page to the trucker protests, have

192
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:07,800
all offended the Twitterati's enough that they're doing the cancel culture thing with

193
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,880
the Ontario College of Psychologists.

194
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:12,880
Even though Pierre Polyaive doesn't seem to actually be involved, this is still pretty

195
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:17,280
worrying because it's still threatening to de-license people for their political beliefs.

196
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:21,560
The steel man of the other side of this argument is that, while a country like Canada has the

197
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:25,280
freedom of expression enshrined in the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, meaning that Jordan

198
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:29,560
Peterson has the right to say any of these things without being legally punished by the

199
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:34,280
state, there is still a necessary code of conduct for nearly every licensing body and

200
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:35,540
profession out there.

201
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:39,460
If a profession is governed by a licensing body, and that governance is necessary because

202
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:43,620
that profession requires public trust in order to function, it seems to be reasonable that

203
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:48,020
adhering to a code of conduct be a requirement of holding a license, and failing to adhere

204
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:50,080
to it should be grounds for de-licensing.

205
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:52,760
But that means that there are two more factors to consider.

206
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:58,400
One, does the licensing body in question uphold that necessary public trust, and is that public

207
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:01,240
trust actually necessary for that profession to function?

208
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:05,300
With psychologists, the answer to both of these questions seems to be yes.

209
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:09,360
For example, if Jordan Peterson was caught multiple times running naked down the street

210
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:14,840
holding a banner saying, I am a licensed clinical psychologist, per the Ontario College of Psychologists,

211
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:18,520
not many people would object to him losing the license, so as to not bring the entire

212
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:20,440
psychology endeavor down with him.

213
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:24,120
The obvious reply to that is, well, streaking's illegal, that's why you should lose your

214
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:25,120
job.

215
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,160
But I actually don't agree with that.

216
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:29,000
Did you actually lose your job just for breaking a law?

217
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,920
What if that same streaker worked for McDonald's and streaked on his off time?

218
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:35,200
Yeah, if you go to jail for streaking, that means you're a no-show at your workplace,

219
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,180
but then you're losing your job for not showing up.

220
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:41,880
In my opinion, the act of streaking itself shouldn't be a fireable offense for McDonald's

221
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:44,720
as long as you do it off the clock, even though it's illegal.

222
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:47,760
The difference between these two examples, disregarding the fact that McDonald's workers

223
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:52,600
don't have a licensing body, is that no public trust needs to be upheld for McDonald's

224
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:53,600
workers.

225
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:57,020
If McDonald's workers break the law outside the workplace, and nonetheless can still fulfill

226
00:11:57,020 --> 00:11:59,560
their job, then fine, they shouldn't get fired.

227
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:04,980
But public trust does need to be upheld for psychology, making some sort of standard reasonable.

228
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:08,760
The second factor to consider is whether or not Jordan Peterson's comments actually

229
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:12,040
constitute bringing the profession of psychology into disrepute.

230
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:15,980
This is the tough one, and the answer to it is going to necessarily be a political one.

231
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:20,660
For example, somebody who is very anti-trans will consider the college's pro-trans stance

232
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:24,700
to already bring it into disrepute, and will also consider Jordan Peterson's comments

233
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:28,740
as not nearly as extreme of a course correction as is needed.

234
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:32,520
The issue, ultimately, is that on the topics that Jordan Peterson is talking about, they

235
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:34,680
are not settled in the minds of the public.

236
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:37,900
It's not like he's saying, rape is good or something, where everyone thinks that rape

237
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:42,580
is bad and he's just a lone person who is wholly out of line with society's expectations.

238
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:46,380
There's a lot of good faith disagreement in all three of the Ts here, truckers, trannies,

239
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:47,580
and tubs.

240
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:52,180
Political people do disagree with the progressive view on these topics in large enough numbers

241
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:56,660
to be considered an identifiable political block, and not just one outlying nutjob.

242
00:12:56,660 --> 00:13:00,180
The college has publicly released their decision and their reasons behind it.

243
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:03,500
This is a long and very formal document, so I'll just summarize it for you.

244
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:08,260
On August 4, 2022, five months before this story went viral, Jordan Peterson was made

245
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:12,540
aware of the complaints, and the college asked him to engage in what they call an Acknowledgement

246
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:16,420
and Undertaking, which was a six-month course involving retraining.

247
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:20,540
Peterson responded on September 6, claiming he didn't need to engage with the college's

248
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:23,480
request to resolve the complaints, because he had already done so on his own, by hiring

249
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:27,100
a social media team to make sure he doesn't fly off the handle again online.

250
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:30,940
The college rejected this course correction as being sufficient, and requested again that

251
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:34,740
Peterson voluntarily submit to the retraining on September 13.

252
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:38,980
On September 27, Peterson's lawyer replied, asking for details about the retraining.

253
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:41,980
On October 7, the college replied, providing information.

254
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:46,620
The retraining process requires Jordan Peterson to, at his own cost, engage the services of

255
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:51,180
a coaching program approved of by the college within three months of receiving their judgment,

256
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:53,580
and complete the program within 12 months.

257
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:57,380
While the information provided by the college outlines the responsibilities of Peterson,

258
00:13:57,380 --> 00:14:01,300
the coach, and the college in this matter, it does not actually describe what the coaching

259
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:06,260
process entails, other than reviewing, reflecting on, and ameliorating his professionalism in

260
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:07,480
public statements.

261
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:11,920
On October 21, Peterson again declined to engage with the retraining process.

262
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:15,560
In response, the college has determined that he is required to engage with it.

263
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:18,960
The documents don't explicitly say he will lose his license if he refuses again, but

264
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:22,720
it's certainly implied, now that the language has moved to required, and the official punishment

265
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:26,900
is an allegation of professional misconduct and a subsequent disciplinary action.

266
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:30,760
Their reasoning is that his public statements are inconsistent with the professional standards,

267
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:34,720
policies, and ethics currently adopted by the college, that his statements pose a moderate

268
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:38,320
risk to the public through undermining public trust in the profession, as well as trust

269
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,680
in the college's ability to regulate that profession.

270
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:42,660
Which is pretty much exactly what I said it would be earlier.

271
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:47,120
The college also noted that Peterson was already given a slap on the wrist in 2020 for previous

272
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:51,320
inflammatory remarks on Twitter, where he was told that as a registered member of the

273
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:54,960
college, and in light of your public profile, you may wish to offer your opinions and comments

274
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:58,560
in a respectful tone, in order to avoid a negative perception towards the profession

275
00:14:58,560 --> 00:14:59,560
of psychology.

276
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:03,520
At the end of the day, while I ultimately side more with Jordan Peterson than the college

277
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:05,420
here, he is not blameless.

278
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:09,200
Nowhere in any of the documents that I've read does it say that Peterson is being punished

279
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:11,900
for his support of conservative leader, Pierre Poliev.

280
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:15,440
Not once did Poliev or the Conservative Party even come up in the documents.

281
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:19,320
And yet that is what Peterson made the centerpiece of his public statement on this event.

282
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:23,600
The truth is, Poliev is a rising star in Canada right now, riding a wave of popularity, and

283
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,760
is likely to unseat Trudeau in the next election.

284
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:29,100
So Peterson hitching his current affairs to that train is good strategy.

285
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:32,440
The only problem is, there is no evidence of it actually being true.

286
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:36,800
Moreover, Peterson does seem to be developing a pattern of being, let's say, unnecessarily

287
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:41,000
quick to act about some things in ways that he was not back in 2015.

288
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Between this, and the anonymous thing, and the Elliot Page thing, which I didn't think

289
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,400
was a very good take frankly, his frequent Twitter spats, hell, the fact that when he

290
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:51,700
initially blew up, he unceremoniously abandoned his private clients, even telling one of them

291
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:55,560
he was too sick to attend their session when he was actually going on TV instead.

292
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:56,980
This is a pattern of behavior.

293
00:15:56,980 --> 00:16:00,800
Jordan Peterson once said on a podcast somewhere that social media wasn't good for him, it

294
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:03,180
was making him rash, angry, and depressed.

295
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:06,400
He knows this, because in his initial appeal to the college, he made the claim that he's

296
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:10,040
employing people to help him with his social media presence, meaning that he knows that

297
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:13,340
by his own standard, there's at least some problem with his conduct.

298
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:15,860
Maybe not what he's saying, but how he's choosing to say it.

299
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:17,660
He knows he's not innocent in this.

300
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:20,540
The far greater issue, though, is the college.

301
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:24,200
Even though it does seem to be reasonable that to be a part of a voluntary association,

302
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:28,240
you have to choose to abide by the association's rules, and it also does seem to be reasonable

303
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:32,280
that one of the rules of the association is, don't destroy the association's reputation

304
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:34,000
by making an ass of yourself in public.

305
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
That's all fair.

306
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:39,040
The issue isn't that the college has standards, but rather what standards it's chosen.

307
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:42,160
Look at the rules that the college claim Peterson has violated.

308
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:43,160
1.

309
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:46,920
Demonstrate appropriate respect for the knowledge, insight, experience, areas of expertise, and

310
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:50,400
cultural perspectives and values of others, including those that are different from their

311
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:54,080
own, limited only by those that seriously contravene the ethical principles of this

312
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,080
code.

313
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:56,080
2.

314
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:59,140
Not engage publicly in public statements, presentations, research reports with primary

315
00:16:59,140 --> 00:17:03,320
clients or other contacts in degrading comments about others, including demeaning jokes based

316
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:08,120
on such characteristics as culture, nationality, ethnicity, color, race, religion, sex, gender,

317
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:09,400
or sexual orientation.

318
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:10,400
3.

319
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:13,920
Strive to use language that conveys respect for the dignity of persons and peoples as

320
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:18,040
much as possible in all spoken, written, electronic, or printed communications.

321
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:19,040
4.

322
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:21,960
Abstain from all forms of harassment, including sexual harassment.

323
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:22,960
5.

324
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:26,500
Avoid or refuse to participate in practices disrespectful of the moral rights of persons

325
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:29,600
or peoples, including their human, legal, and civil rights.

326
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:30,600
9.

327
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:35,280
Not practice, condone, facilitate, or collaborate with any form of unjust discrimination.

328
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:39,280
Has Jordan Peterson actually violated any of these rules as they are written?

329
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:40,280
1.

330
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:41,280
It's possible.

331
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:42,280
2.

332
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:43,280
For sure.

333
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:44,280
3.

334
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:45,280
Maybe.

335
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:46,280
4.

336
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:47,280
Absolutely not.

337
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:48,280
5.

338
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:49,280
It's impossibly broad.

339
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:50,280
Same with 9.

340
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:51,280
The more important question is, though, are these good rules?

341
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,400
Even if Peterson violated one or all of them, are these rules fit for purpose?

342
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:56,360
Are they universally agreed upon by members of the college, other than Peterson?

343
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:57,360
Maybe.

344
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:58,360
I don't know.

345
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:01,360
Absolutely agreed upon by members of the general public, who the college appeals to

346
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:03,500
as protecting them with this action.

347
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:04,500
Absolutely not.

348
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:09,240
Rules 1, 2, and 3 butt up against freedom of expression, and there is a good faith negotiation

349
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:13,060
to be had between those two contrasting principles, though I'm not sure the college is capable

350
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:14,060
of having it.

351
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:15,060
4.

352
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:18,240
Seems to be wholly inappropriate, and I can only assume that it was brought up to tarnish

353
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:19,240
Peterson's reputation.

354
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:24,340
5 and 9 are so broad that they seem designed to be wielded as political cudgels.

355
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:27,660
Though Jordan Peterson is not innocent here, he shouldn't have lied to make his story

356
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:31,060
blow up, and in a more general sense, he needs to tone down the hyperbole.

357
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:32,880
I've been saying this since he came out of his coma.

358
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:37,420
I do ultimately think the College of Psychologists of Ontario is the larger problem here.

359
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:41,660
This is not the political witch hunt that Jordan Peterson said it was, but it is a different

360
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:45,320
type of political witch hunt, and Peterson made it that much easier for them by being

361
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:46,960
inflammatory online.

362
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:50,060
As it is with literally everything, using Twitter is the problem.
