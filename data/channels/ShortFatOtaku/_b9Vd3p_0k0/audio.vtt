00:00.000 --> 00:09.400
Oh man, the last time I talked about Jordan Peterson on this channel, I actually had to

00:09.400 --> 00:12.720
push back against him, despite generally being a fan of his older stuff.

00:12.720 --> 00:16.440
That was during the whole anonymous speech kerfuffle, where he said that anonymity granted

00:16.440 --> 00:20.220
people the right to be cruel online, and that if people are going to comment, they should

00:20.220 --> 00:21.280
be de-masked.

00:21.280 --> 00:25.400
A stance I personally disagree with, as being anonymous is a key component of speaking truth

00:25.400 --> 00:26.400
to power.

00:26.400 --> 00:29.260
And to Jordan Peterson's credit, he did walk this back at least a little bit, saying

00:29.260 --> 00:33.980
that anonymous commenters shouldn't be de-anonymized, but instead put into a lower tier of comments

00:33.980 --> 00:35.660
on Twitter and underneath YouTube videos.

00:35.660 --> 00:40.180
I guess the idea is, if you want to wade into the anonymous muck, it's not censored per

00:40.180 --> 00:42.060
se, it's just on the second page.

00:42.060 --> 00:46.760
Peterson does seem to have a habit of sometimes being unnecessarily hyperbolic.

00:46.760 --> 00:49.940
It happened again with the event that launched him into prominence in the first place, the

00:49.940 --> 00:53.020
claim that misgendering people will be made illegal in Canada.

00:53.020 --> 00:54.780
It turned out that wasn't fully accurate.

00:54.780 --> 00:59.540
Bill 16 was poorly worded, such that it could mean that misgendering would be illegal, but

00:59.540 --> 01:03.780
it was also worded such that a reasonable person would likely conclude that it didn't.

01:03.780 --> 01:08.740
What the bill did was add to Canada's hate crime laws gender identity and gender expression.

01:08.740 --> 01:12.100
So while speech does not constitute a hate crime in Canada, you're not going to get

01:12.100 --> 01:15.420
arrested for misgendering any more than you are for using a slur.

01:15.420 --> 01:21.020
What it did change was that crimes that could be hate crimes now also protected gender stuff.

01:21.020 --> 01:25.300
So for example, if a racist murdered a black man because he's black, the hatred is an

01:25.300 --> 01:30.620
aggravating factor, and the new law simply added gender to that list of protected characteristics.

01:30.620 --> 01:34.420
Whether you agree with that or not, the truth is, we're five years on and nobody is getting

01:34.420 --> 01:38.540
thrown in jail for misgendering a random trans passerby on the street.

01:38.540 --> 01:43.420
So I have a feeling that Jordan Peterson might be being a bit more hyperbolic when it comes

01:43.420 --> 01:45.140
to the topic of today's video.

01:45.140 --> 01:46.140
Breaking!

01:46.140 --> 01:50.460
The Ontario College of Psychologists has demanded that I submit myself to mandatory social media

01:50.460 --> 01:55.020
communication retraining with their experts for, among other crimes, retweeting Pierre

01:55.020 --> 01:58.620
Poliev and criticizing Justin Trudeau and his political allies.

01:58.620 --> 02:01.900
That's the new Conservative leader in Canada, by the way, who seems to be on track to unseat

02:01.900 --> 02:03.060
Trudeau in the next election.

02:03.060 --> 02:04.060
He's quite popular.

02:04.060 --> 02:07.980
I am to take a course of such training, with reports documenting my progress, or face an

02:07.980 --> 02:12.300
in-person tribunal in suspension of my right to operate as a licensed clinical psychologist.

02:12.300 --> 02:15.500
About a dozen people from all over the world submitted complaints about my public statements

02:15.500 --> 02:19.420
on Twitter and Joe Rogan over a four-year period, out of the 15 million who follow me

02:19.420 --> 02:23.300
in social media, claiming that I had harmed people, not them, with my views.

02:23.300 --> 02:27.300
In its wisdom, the Ontario College of Psychologists decided to pursue these complaints even though

02:27.300 --> 02:29.060
they could have dismissed them as vexatious.

02:29.060 --> 02:32.380
I've been accused of harming people, although none of the complaints involved in the current

02:32.380 --> 02:36.500
action were clients of mine, past or present, or were even acquainted with my clients.

02:36.500 --> 02:40.020
We are now in a situation in Canada under Justin Trudeau where practicing professionals

02:40.020 --> 02:44.300
can have their livelihoods and public reputations threatened in a very serious manner for agreeing

02:44.300 --> 02:47.660
with the official opposition and criticizing major government figures.

02:47.660 --> 02:51.260
If I comply, the terms of my re-education and my punishment will be announced publicly.

02:51.260 --> 02:54.860
I have already had the second most serious category of punishment levied against me and

02:54.860 --> 02:56.860
have been deemed at high risk to re-offend.

02:56.860 --> 03:01.900
Canadians, your physicians, lawyers, psychologists, and other professionals are now so intimidated

03:01.900 --> 03:04.580
by their commissar overlords that they fear to tell you the truth.

03:04.580 --> 03:08.860
This means that your care and legal counsel has been rendered dangerously unreliable.

03:08.860 --> 03:12.920
To reiterate, I face public disgrace, mandatory political re-education, disciplinary hearing

03:12.920 --> 03:16.860
and potential loss of my clinical licensing for agreeing with Pierre Polyev and criticizing

03:16.860 --> 03:18.660
our standing PM Justin Trudeau.

03:18.660 --> 03:22.940
I am willing, if the Ontario College of Psychologists occurs, which they won't, to make absolutely

03:22.940 --> 03:26.460
every word of all of this fully public so that everyone can decide for themselves what's

03:26.460 --> 03:27.460
actually happening.

03:27.460 --> 03:30.900
To clarify, it's been decided, I either submit Jesus, okay you don't have to repeat

03:30.900 --> 03:34.200
it this many times, but that certainly sounds like a political witch hunt, doesn't it?

03:34.200 --> 03:38.140
This event naturally made headlines, in both Canada and elsewhere, with Polyev even making

03:38.140 --> 03:41.060
a video on his campaign channel supporting Justin Peterson's case.

03:41.060 --> 03:43.400
Now, on some level this doesn't actually matter that much.

03:43.400 --> 03:46.560
Jordan Peterson has moved out of the clinical space ever since blowing up.

03:46.560 --> 03:50.000
Being discredited by the Ontario College of Psychologists means he cannot practice

03:50.000 --> 03:51.120
in Ontario anymore.

03:51.120 --> 03:54.160
But he's still got his other businesses and his income, his education and experience,

03:54.160 --> 03:55.160
and his name.

03:55.160 --> 03:58.020
He no longer depends on the college for his livelihood, and he can move forward without

03:58.020 --> 03:59.160
them if he likes.

03:59.160 --> 04:02.200
In essence, he's reached escape velocity from that system.

04:02.200 --> 04:06.060
No punishment they can impose on him will do anything except tarnish his honor.

04:06.060 --> 04:08.560
At the same time, though, honor seems to be pretty important to him.

04:08.560 --> 04:10.920
So I'm not surprised he's not taking this lying down.

04:10.920 --> 04:15.000
I wanted to see how much of Jordan Peterson's characterization of these events is actually

04:15.000 --> 04:16.000
true.

04:16.440 --> 04:19.700
Here are the complaint forms sent to the College of Psychologists of Ontario.

04:19.700 --> 04:20.700
These are pretty detailed.

04:20.700 --> 04:23.280
You don't need to go too deep into them, but I'll point out a few relevant things

04:23.280 --> 04:24.280
on each.

04:24.280 --> 04:28.040
The first complaint, on January 5, 2022, was from a person who falsely claimed to be one

04:28.040 --> 04:29.480
of Jordan Peterson's clients.

04:29.480 --> 04:32.880
The complaint says that he encouraged people to commit suicide on Twitter, with a Twitter

04:32.880 --> 04:33.880
link attached.

04:33.880 --> 04:38.100
An email attached to the complaint references the US National Association of Social Workers

04:38.100 --> 04:42.000
Code of Ethics, while saying, I'm sure Canada's is similar, which makes it pretty obvious

04:42.000 --> 04:45.500
that this person was not actually a client of Peterson's Toronto practice.

04:45.500 --> 04:49.440
The tweet in question is Peterson replying to the message, based on the record of human

04:49.440 --> 04:52.400
behavior, we are already overpopulating this small world.

04:52.400 --> 04:55.920
Any arguments I've heard for supporting such a large human population completely overlook

04:55.920 --> 05:00.240
the huge loss of species and ecosystems resulting from our self-absorbed attention.

05:00.240 --> 05:02.620
By saying, you're free to leave at any point.

05:02.620 --> 05:05.860
This is apparently encouraging people to commit suicide on Twitter.

05:05.860 --> 05:09.680
You know, the leftoids talk about nasty population as a good thing all the time, but this is

05:09.680 --> 05:11.060
what gets under their skin, eh?

05:11.060 --> 05:12.800
It's clearly just a partisan game.

05:12.800 --> 05:17.080
The second complaint, on February 18th, 2022, was also from a person who falsely claimed

05:17.080 --> 05:18.560
to be one of Peterson's clients.

05:18.560 --> 05:21.960
This time it was about the trucker protests, yes I know it's in the render queue, specifically

05:21.960 --> 05:25.680
the news that the Children's Aid Society would be involved in removing any children at the

05:25.680 --> 05:27.840
protest after their parents had been arrested.

05:27.840 --> 05:32.160
The spirit of Peterson's objection is that because, in his view, the protest was legitimate

05:32.160 --> 05:35.920
and the government crackdown on it was tyrannical overreach, that the government also moving

05:35.920 --> 05:40.400
to intercept the children of protesters constituted the state breaking apart families as political

05:40.400 --> 05:41.400
punishment.

05:41.400 --> 05:44.180
I wouldn't say that, but that's what I see reading between the lines.

05:44.180 --> 05:48.800
According to the complaint, this opinion undermined faith in Peterson's ability to be a mandatory

05:48.800 --> 05:53.080
reporter of child abuse to the proper authorities, which made him ineligible to be a clinical

05:53.080 --> 05:54.080
psychologist.

05:54.080 --> 05:58.140
The third complaint, on February 4th, 2022, was again from a person who falsely claimed

05:58.140 --> 05:59.780
to be one of Peterson's clients.

05:59.780 --> 06:02.520
This time it was about Peterson's appearances on the Joe Rogan experience.

06:02.520 --> 06:05.460
This complaint is extremely long and ridiculously nitpicky.

06:05.460 --> 06:10.840
They're outlining statements from the first hour of Joe Rogan episode 1769 that are problematic,

06:10.840 --> 06:14.820
unethical, or unprofessional, and that there's just as many instances in every other Peterson

06:14.820 --> 06:15.820
public appearance.

06:15.820 --> 06:18.880
I'm not going to go over all of these, even I'm not as autistic as this guy.

06:18.880 --> 06:20.200
You can pause if you want to see them all.

06:20.200 --> 06:21.600
But listen to some of this stuff.

06:21.600 --> 06:25.400
This person's complaining that Peterson is critiquing Marxism, that he claimed Japanese

06:25.400 --> 06:29.320
cars rust more than American ones, and that drunk monkeys are funny.

06:29.320 --> 06:31.200
How are these reasonable complaints?

06:31.200 --> 06:35.620
The fourth complaint, on February 9th, 2022, was via a phone call and the transcript appears

06:35.620 --> 06:38.300
to indicate that this was from a fellow psychologist.

06:38.300 --> 06:39.560
He cites much the same stuff.

06:39.560 --> 06:43.440
Twitter posts, appearances on Joe Rogan, how he embarrasses the college, and the profession

06:43.440 --> 06:44.560
associated with it.

06:44.560 --> 06:48.680
More specifically, this person cites a particularly inflammatory public back-and-forth Peterson

06:48.680 --> 06:52.560
had with Gerald Butts, a former secretary to the Prime Minister of Canada, as well as

06:52.560 --> 06:57.720
his calling Catherine McKenney, a non-binary they-them candidate for Ottawa mayor in 2022,

06:57.720 --> 07:00.400
an appalling self-righteous moralizing thing.

07:00.400 --> 07:04.580
Finally, this person took umbrage at Jordan Peterson's claim that Nazis and white supremacists

07:04.580 --> 07:08.640
do not exist in Canada, there is no culture of such things in Canada, political or otherwise.

07:08.720 --> 07:12.180
That's not exactly true, but unironically, there's probably only a few hundred actual

07:12.180 --> 07:16.440
Nazis in the 30 million population nation of Canada.

07:16.440 --> 07:20.840
The fifth complaint, on May 17th, 2022, was also from a person who falsely claimed to

07:20.840 --> 07:22.040
be one of Peterson's clients.

07:22.040 --> 07:26.640
This complaint contained nothing except the statement, this man has been online bullying

07:26.640 --> 07:30.160
and harassing a 24-year-old model.

07:30.160 --> 07:31.560
He has been trending since yesterday.

07:31.560 --> 07:32.560
This is not the first time.

07:32.560 --> 07:33.940
Why is he still registered with you?

07:33.940 --> 07:37.480
How is hateful, racist, and and a misogynistic bully?

07:37.480 --> 07:38.900
How is he allowed to stay registered?

07:38.900 --> 07:39.960
Why this special treatment?

07:39.960 --> 07:41.760
Jesus Christ, get off Twitter.

07:41.760 --> 07:45.960
The sixth complaint, on May 18th, 2022, was also from a person who falsely claimed to

07:45.960 --> 07:47.080
be one of Peterson's clients.

07:47.080 --> 07:50.460
This complaint revolves around the same incident as the previous one, but with a little bit

07:50.460 --> 07:51.960
more meat on the bone.

07:51.960 --> 07:58.520
On Twitter, Jordan Peterson used his quote, doctoral position to attack a woman in the

07:58.520 --> 07:59.520
public sphere.

07:59.520 --> 08:02.440
He said she wasn't beautiful, oh my God, the crime.

08:02.440 --> 08:06.000
He said society was being forced to accept fat people as attractive.

08:06.000 --> 08:09.720
He used clinical studies to try and prove he was correct and she did not meet the definition

08:09.720 --> 08:11.000
or standard of beauty.

08:11.000 --> 08:13.280
This is incredibly dangerous and irresponsible behavior.

08:13.280 --> 08:16.520
You know, before on Twitter I taught people how to heat up crack in the microwave, now

08:16.520 --> 08:18.300
I can't even call a fat bitch fat.

08:18.300 --> 08:22.760
The seventh complaint, on July 4th, 2022, was, you guessed it, also from a person who

08:22.760 --> 08:25.020
falsely claimed to be one of Peterson's clients.

08:25.020 --> 08:28.760
This time, it was about the Elliot Page situation, though the name Elliot Page is never used,

08:28.760 --> 08:29.920
the context lines up.

08:29.920 --> 08:33.720
The claim is that Peterson's video on the topic brings disrepute on psychologists and

08:33.720 --> 08:35.640
causes direct harm to minorities.

08:35.680 --> 08:39.480
The funniest bit is where they say I am a psychologist in Australia and we have clear

08:39.480 --> 08:44.000
rules about psychologists being deregistered should they bring disrepute onto the profession

08:44.000 --> 08:45.000
or engage in hate speech.

08:45.000 --> 08:47.680
Well, why the fuck did you claim to be one of his clients then?

08:47.680 --> 08:52.960
The eighth complaint, on July 11th, 2022, was, surprise surprise, also from a person

08:52.960 --> 08:56.840
who falsely claimed to be one of his clients, even though they immediately began their paragraph

08:56.840 --> 09:01.200
with as a member of the general public, also revolved around Elliot Page, specifically

09:01.200 --> 09:04.680
leaning on Jordan Peterson's Twitter ban to make the point that he should also be banned

09:04.680 --> 09:06.280
from psychology, I guessed.

09:06.280 --> 09:09.720
The ninth complaint, July 4th, 2022, same thing, falsely claimed to be a client, outrage

09:09.720 --> 09:12.960
over Elliot Page, it's all the same whiny nonsense, same with the tenth complaint, and

09:12.960 --> 09:15.120
that's all the ones I can find, at least from 2022.

09:15.120 --> 09:18.240
There are older complaints from years ago that Peterson's talked about, but those

09:18.240 --> 09:19.400
have all been resolved.

09:19.400 --> 09:24.440
This bundle of ten complaints are the ones specifically attached to this retraining request.

09:24.440 --> 09:28.160
Though the complaints seem to be politically motivated partisan hackery, not worth the

09:28.160 --> 09:32.560
paper they're printed on, I have to point out, not one of them mentioned Peterson's

09:32.560 --> 09:34.600
support of Pierre Polyaive as a reason.

09:34.600 --> 09:37.720
Maybe I missed something, but as far as I can tell, the claim that this retraining from

09:37.720 --> 09:42.300
the Ontario College of Psychologists is specifically due to Peterson's retweeting and support

09:42.300 --> 09:47.080
of the leader of Canada's Conservative Party seems to only come from Peterson himself.

09:47.080 --> 09:51.480
It would indeed be extremely worrying if supporting a politician that a licensing body doesn't

09:51.480 --> 09:55.720
like is the reason your license is challenged, but that doesn't seem to be happening here.

09:55.720 --> 09:59.720
What is happening is that Peterson's public statements and opinions about several news

09:59.720 --> 10:04.040
cycle events, from the fat activist stuff to Elliot Page to the trucker protests, have

10:04.040 --> 10:07.800
all offended the Twitterati's enough that they're doing the cancel culture thing with

10:07.800 --> 10:09.880
the Ontario College of Psychologists.

10:09.880 --> 10:12.880
Even though Pierre Polyaive doesn't seem to actually be involved, this is still pretty

10:12.880 --> 10:17.280
worrying because it's still threatening to de-license people for their political beliefs.

10:17.280 --> 10:21.560
The steel man of the other side of this argument is that, while a country like Canada has the

10:21.560 --> 10:25.280
freedom of expression enshrined in the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, meaning that Jordan

10:25.280 --> 10:29.560
Peterson has the right to say any of these things without being legally punished by the

10:29.560 --> 10:34.280
state, there is still a necessary code of conduct for nearly every licensing body and

10:34.280 --> 10:35.540
profession out there.

10:35.540 --> 10:39.460
If a profession is governed by a licensing body, and that governance is necessary because

10:39.460 --> 10:43.620
that profession requires public trust in order to function, it seems to be reasonable that

10:43.620 --> 10:48.020
adhering to a code of conduct be a requirement of holding a license, and failing to adhere

10:48.020 --> 10:50.080
to it should be grounds for de-licensing.

10:50.080 --> 10:52.760
But that means that there are two more factors to consider.

10:52.760 --> 10:58.400
One, does the licensing body in question uphold that necessary public trust, and is that public

10:58.400 --> 11:01.240
trust actually necessary for that profession to function?

11:01.240 --> 11:05.300
With psychologists, the answer to both of these questions seems to be yes.

11:05.300 --> 11:09.360
For example, if Jordan Peterson was caught multiple times running naked down the street

11:09.360 --> 11:14.840
holding a banner saying, I am a licensed clinical psychologist, per the Ontario College of Psychologists,

11:14.840 --> 11:18.520
not many people would object to him losing the license, so as to not bring the entire

11:18.520 --> 11:20.440
psychology endeavor down with him.

11:20.440 --> 11:24.120
The obvious reply to that is, well, streaking's illegal, that's why you should lose your

11:24.120 --> 11:25.120
job.

11:25.120 --> 11:26.160
But I actually don't agree with that.

11:26.160 --> 11:29.000
Did you actually lose your job just for breaking a law?

11:29.000 --> 11:31.920
What if that same streaker worked for McDonald's and streaked on his off time?

11:31.920 --> 11:35.200
Yeah, if you go to jail for streaking, that means you're a no-show at your workplace,

11:35.200 --> 11:37.180
but then you're losing your job for not showing up.

11:37.180 --> 11:41.880
In my opinion, the act of streaking itself shouldn't be a fireable offense for McDonald's

11:41.880 --> 11:44.720
as long as you do it off the clock, even though it's illegal.

11:44.720 --> 11:47.760
The difference between these two examples, disregarding the fact that McDonald's workers

11:47.760 --> 11:52.600
don't have a licensing body, is that no public trust needs to be upheld for McDonald's

11:52.600 --> 11:53.600
workers.

11:53.600 --> 11:57.020
If McDonald's workers break the law outside the workplace, and nonetheless can still fulfill

11:57.020 --> 11:59.560
their job, then fine, they shouldn't get fired.

11:59.560 --> 12:04.980
But public trust does need to be upheld for psychology, making some sort of standard reasonable.

12:04.980 --> 12:08.760
The second factor to consider is whether or not Jordan Peterson's comments actually

12:08.760 --> 12:12.040
constitute bringing the profession of psychology into disrepute.

12:12.040 --> 12:15.980
This is the tough one, and the answer to it is going to necessarily be a political one.

12:15.980 --> 12:20.660
For example, somebody who is very anti-trans will consider the college's pro-trans stance

12:20.660 --> 12:24.700
to already bring it into disrepute, and will also consider Jordan Peterson's comments

12:24.700 --> 12:28.740
as not nearly as extreme of a course correction as is needed.

12:28.740 --> 12:32.520
The issue, ultimately, is that on the topics that Jordan Peterson is talking about, they

12:32.520 --> 12:34.680
are not settled in the minds of the public.

12:34.680 --> 12:37.900
It's not like he's saying, rape is good or something, where everyone thinks that rape

12:37.900 --> 12:42.580
is bad and he's just a lone person who is wholly out of line with society's expectations.

12:42.580 --> 12:46.380
There's a lot of good faith disagreement in all three of the Ts here, truckers, trannies,

12:46.380 --> 12:47.580
and tubs.

12:47.580 --> 12:52.180
Political people do disagree with the progressive view on these topics in large enough numbers

12:52.180 --> 12:56.660
to be considered an identifiable political block, and not just one outlying nutjob.

12:56.660 --> 13:00.180
The college has publicly released their decision and their reasons behind it.

13:00.180 --> 13:03.500
This is a long and very formal document, so I'll just summarize it for you.

13:03.500 --> 13:08.260
On August 4, 2022, five months before this story went viral, Jordan Peterson was made

13:08.260 --> 13:12.540
aware of the complaints, and the college asked him to engage in what they call an Acknowledgement

13:12.540 --> 13:16.420
and Undertaking, which was a six-month course involving retraining.

13:16.420 --> 13:20.540
Peterson responded on September 6, claiming he didn't need to engage with the college's

13:20.540 --> 13:23.480
request to resolve the complaints, because he had already done so on his own, by hiring

13:23.480 --> 13:27.100
a social media team to make sure he doesn't fly off the handle again online.

13:27.100 --> 13:30.940
The college rejected this course correction as being sufficient, and requested again that

13:30.940 --> 13:34.740
Peterson voluntarily submit to the retraining on September 13.

13:34.740 --> 13:38.980
On September 27, Peterson's lawyer replied, asking for details about the retraining.

13:38.980 --> 13:41.980
On October 7, the college replied, providing information.

13:41.980 --> 13:46.620
The retraining process requires Jordan Peterson to, at his own cost, engage the services of

13:46.620 --> 13:51.180
a coaching program approved of by the college within three months of receiving their judgment,

13:51.180 --> 13:53.580
and complete the program within 12 months.

13:53.580 --> 13:57.380
While the information provided by the college outlines the responsibilities of Peterson,

13:57.380 --> 14:01.300
the coach, and the college in this matter, it does not actually describe what the coaching

14:01.300 --> 14:06.260
process entails, other than reviewing, reflecting on, and ameliorating his professionalism in

14:06.260 --> 14:07.480
public statements.

14:07.480 --> 14:11.920
On October 21, Peterson again declined to engage with the retraining process.

14:11.920 --> 14:15.560
In response, the college has determined that he is required to engage with it.

14:15.560 --> 14:18.960
The documents don't explicitly say he will lose his license if he refuses again, but

14:18.960 --> 14:22.720
it's certainly implied, now that the language has moved to required, and the official punishment

14:22.720 --> 14:26.900
is an allegation of professional misconduct and a subsequent disciplinary action.

14:26.900 --> 14:30.760
Their reasoning is that his public statements are inconsistent with the professional standards,

14:30.760 --> 14:34.720
policies, and ethics currently adopted by the college, that his statements pose a moderate

14:34.720 --> 14:38.320
risk to the public through undermining public trust in the profession, as well as trust

14:38.320 --> 14:40.680
in the college's ability to regulate that profession.

14:40.680 --> 14:42.660
Which is pretty much exactly what I said it would be earlier.

14:42.660 --> 14:47.120
The college also noted that Peterson was already given a slap on the wrist in 2020 for previous

14:47.120 --> 14:51.320
inflammatory remarks on Twitter, where he was told that as a registered member of the

14:51.320 --> 14:54.960
college, and in light of your public profile, you may wish to offer your opinions and comments

14:54.960 --> 14:58.560
in a respectful tone, in order to avoid a negative perception towards the profession

14:58.560 --> 14:59.560
of psychology.

14:59.560 --> 15:03.520
At the end of the day, while I ultimately side more with Jordan Peterson than the college

15:03.520 --> 15:05.420
here, he is not blameless.

15:05.420 --> 15:09.200
Nowhere in any of the documents that I've read does it say that Peterson is being punished

15:09.200 --> 15:11.900
for his support of conservative leader, Pierre Poliev.

15:11.900 --> 15:15.440
Not once did Poliev or the Conservative Party even come up in the documents.

15:15.440 --> 15:19.320
And yet that is what Peterson made the centerpiece of his public statement on this event.

15:19.320 --> 15:23.600
The truth is, Poliev is a rising star in Canada right now, riding a wave of popularity, and

15:23.600 --> 15:25.760
is likely to unseat Trudeau in the next election.

15:25.760 --> 15:29.100
So Peterson hitching his current affairs to that train is good strategy.

15:29.100 --> 15:32.440
The only problem is, there is no evidence of it actually being true.

15:32.440 --> 15:36.800
Moreover, Peterson does seem to be developing a pattern of being, let's say, unnecessarily

15:36.800 --> 15:41.000
quick to act about some things in ways that he was not back in 2015.

15:41.000 --> 15:44.000
Between this, and the anonymous thing, and the Elliot Page thing, which I didn't think

15:44.000 --> 15:47.400
was a very good take frankly, his frequent Twitter spats, hell, the fact that when he

15:47.400 --> 15:51.700
initially blew up, he unceremoniously abandoned his private clients, even telling one of them

15:51.700 --> 15:55.560
he was too sick to attend their session when he was actually going on TV instead.

15:55.560 --> 15:56.980
This is a pattern of behavior.

15:56.980 --> 16:00.800
Jordan Peterson once said on a podcast somewhere that social media wasn't good for him, it

16:00.800 --> 16:03.180
was making him rash, angry, and depressed.

16:03.180 --> 16:06.400
He knows this, because in his initial appeal to the college, he made the claim that he's

16:06.400 --> 16:10.040
employing people to help him with his social media presence, meaning that he knows that

16:10.040 --> 16:13.340
by his own standard, there's at least some problem with his conduct.

16:13.340 --> 16:15.860
Maybe not what he's saying, but how he's choosing to say it.

16:15.860 --> 16:17.660
He knows he's not innocent in this.

16:17.660 --> 16:20.540
The far greater issue, though, is the college.

16:20.540 --> 16:24.200
Even though it does seem to be reasonable that to be a part of a voluntary association,

16:24.200 --> 16:28.240
you have to choose to abide by the association's rules, and it also does seem to be reasonable

16:28.240 --> 16:32.280
that one of the rules of the association is, don't destroy the association's reputation

16:32.280 --> 16:34.000
by making an ass of yourself in public.

16:34.000 --> 16:35.000
That's all fair.

16:35.000 --> 16:39.040
The issue isn't that the college has standards, but rather what standards it's chosen.

16:39.040 --> 16:42.160
Look at the rules that the college claim Peterson has violated.

16:42.160 --> 16:43.160
1.

16:43.160 --> 16:46.920
Demonstrate appropriate respect for the knowledge, insight, experience, areas of expertise, and

16:46.920 --> 16:50.400
cultural perspectives and values of others, including those that are different from their

16:50.400 --> 16:54.080
own, limited only by those that seriously contravene the ethical principles of this

16:54.080 --> 16:55.080
code.

16:55.080 --> 16:56.080
2.

16:56.080 --> 16:59.140
Not engage publicly in public statements, presentations, research reports with primary

16:59.140 --> 17:03.320
clients or other contacts in degrading comments about others, including demeaning jokes based

17:03.320 --> 17:08.120
on such characteristics as culture, nationality, ethnicity, color, race, religion, sex, gender,

17:08.120 --> 17:09.400
or sexual orientation.

17:09.400 --> 17:10.400
3.

17:10.400 --> 17:13.920
Strive to use language that conveys respect for the dignity of persons and peoples as

17:13.920 --> 17:18.040
much as possible in all spoken, written, electronic, or printed communications.

17:18.040 --> 17:19.040
4.

17:19.040 --> 17:21.960
Abstain from all forms of harassment, including sexual harassment.

17:21.960 --> 17:22.960
5.

17:22.960 --> 17:26.500
Avoid or refuse to participate in practices disrespectful of the moral rights of persons

17:26.500 --> 17:29.600
or peoples, including their human, legal, and civil rights.

17:29.600 --> 17:30.600
9.

17:30.600 --> 17:35.280
Not practice, condone, facilitate, or collaborate with any form of unjust discrimination.

17:35.280 --> 17:39.280
Has Jordan Peterson actually violated any of these rules as they are written?

17:39.280 --> 17:40.280
1.

17:40.280 --> 17:41.280
It's possible.

17:41.280 --> 17:42.280
2.

17:42.280 --> 17:43.280
For sure.

17:43.280 --> 17:44.280
3.

17:44.280 --> 17:45.280
Maybe.

17:45.280 --> 17:46.280
4.

17:46.280 --> 17:47.280
Absolutely not.

17:47.280 --> 17:48.280
5.

17:48.280 --> 17:49.280
It's impossibly broad.

17:49.280 --> 17:50.280
Same with 9.

17:50.280 --> 17:51.280
The more important question is, though, are these good rules?

17:51.280 --> 17:53.400
Even if Peterson violated one or all of them, are these rules fit for purpose?

17:53.400 --> 17:56.360
Are they universally agreed upon by members of the college, other than Peterson?

17:56.360 --> 17:57.360
Maybe.

17:57.360 --> 17:58.360
I don't know.

17:58.360 --> 18:01.360
Absolutely agreed upon by members of the general public, who the college appeals to

18:01.360 --> 18:03.500
as protecting them with this action.

18:03.500 --> 18:04.500
Absolutely not.

18:04.500 --> 18:09.240
Rules 1, 2, and 3 butt up against freedom of expression, and there is a good faith negotiation

18:09.240 --> 18:13.060
to be had between those two contrasting principles, though I'm not sure the college is capable

18:13.060 --> 18:14.060
of having it.

18:14.060 --> 18:15.060
4.

18:15.060 --> 18:18.240
Seems to be wholly inappropriate, and I can only assume that it was brought up to tarnish

18:18.240 --> 18:19.240
Peterson's reputation.

18:19.240 --> 18:24.340
5 and 9 are so broad that they seem designed to be wielded as political cudgels.

18:24.340 --> 18:27.660
Though Jordan Peterson is not innocent here, he shouldn't have lied to make his story

18:27.660 --> 18:31.060
blow up, and in a more general sense, he needs to tone down the hyperbole.

18:31.060 --> 18:32.880
I've been saying this since he came out of his coma.

18:32.880 --> 18:37.420
I do ultimately think the College of Psychologists of Ontario is the larger problem here.

18:37.420 --> 18:41.660
This is not the political witch hunt that Jordan Peterson said it was, but it is a different

18:41.660 --> 18:45.320
type of political witch hunt, and Peterson made it that much easier for them by being

18:45.320 --> 18:46.960
inflammatory online.

18:46.960 --> 18:50.060
As it is with literally everything, using Twitter is the problem.
