1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,600
You know, despite the talk from all the globalists regarding how we're all one human species

2
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:09,440
and there should be no borders and we're all in this together etc etc, you can really

3
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:14,800
tell who actually believes that and who doesn't by looking at their coronavirus pandemic response.

4
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:19,260
Which nations are working together with others? Which are simply going it alone? Well the

5
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:22,340
results might surprise you, or maybe not.

6
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:28,080
Global rush for Trump-backed virus drug sparks India export ban. They're talking about

7
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:33,120
here I think hydroxychloroquine, which is a drug that if taken while you have the coronavirus

8
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:38,600
seems to at least somewhat reduce the symptoms sometimes. It's certainly not a miracle cure.

9
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:42,280
But as soon as this became known, suddenly India stopped exporting it. That's no big

10
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:45,560
deal though, hydroxychloroquine is actually pretty easy to get a hold of. The plants that

11
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:49,880
it comes from can basically be grown anywhere. But as you can see by the article, India banned

12
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:56,320
exports of a malaria drug backed by US President Donald Trump amid a run on supplies globally.

13
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:00,880
India is probably buying time to ensure its local needs are met first. And that actually

14
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:04,760
makes complete sense. It's better to help yourself before you help somebody else. Because

15
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:07,780
if you're incapacitated, you can't help anybody else.

16
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:12,120
In the States, people are stealing masks and other medical equipment from hospitals. This

17
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:15,360
was two months ago, so who knows if it's still happening now. But additionally, this

18
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:19,120
is also individual people, not the actions of a government. The article doesn't directly

19
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:22,320
confirm this, but the tone of it makes it sound like the people who are stealing from

20
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:26,420
hospitals are actually those doctors and nurses who are working there, probably stocking

21
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:29,400
up on their own personal supply from the hospital closets.

22
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:32,740
Of course, even though the media reported on this at the beginning of March, by the

23
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:37,040
end of March, after Trump had agreed with them that doctors and nurses were in fact

24
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:42,240
stealing PPE from the hospitals, the legacy media of course flip-flops. Trump could help

25
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:46,640
solve the mask problem and said he's making baseless attacks on New York nurses. Baseless?

26
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:51,960
Weren't you guys reporting that this was actually the case? French border guards impound trucks

27
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:58,760
filled with 130,000 facemasks bound for Britain for the NHS workers battling coronavirus.

28
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:03,360
After realizing what was on board, border guards in France held the truck there. Macron

29
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:07,880
has promised to requisition facemasks for the French crisis. I mean, presumably Britain

30
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:12,860
had fairly purchased those masks. It was their property and the French just took them.

31
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:16,920
It's okay though, according to the Global Times, which is China's English propaganda

32
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:21,940
outlet, China has returned the favor to the EU while American help is absent. And this

33
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:25,520
article is about how awesome the communist government of China is, sending all these

34
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:30,320
supplies to Europe. Of course, that was basically just a propaganda stunt, because almost all

35
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:35,520
of the actual medical supplies that are manufactured in China, but owned by American and European

36
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:39,760
firms are no longer leaving China, and those businesses have in fact been nationalized

37
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:44,600
by the Chinese. The world needs masks, China makes them but has been hoarding them. Yeah,

38
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:49,500
the American medical supply company 3M, they had millions of masks in China. China's

39
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:53,320
not letting those go. They might send over a couple of pallets of supplies to make themselves

40
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:56,480
look good on the world stage, but they're keeping everything now. Maybe the West should

41
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:01,760
move its manufacturing base out of a country that has no problem with just stealing everything

42
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:05,980
should the situation require it. Italy, one of the worst hit countries in Europe, has

43
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:11,760
been asking the EU for help, and has received nothing from them. So much for an ever-closer

44
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:16,080
union, I guess that's just completely abandoned as soon as a crisis comes along. So as you

45
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:21,900
can see, all of these places that want this globalism, that want money flowing between

46
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:26,220
countries, that want this privileged upper class of people who are predominantly socialist

47
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:30,900
leaning and who can jet set around the world having no actual ties to any one location,

48
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:35,300
who can fly into a community, destroy it for profit, act like they're still moral because

49
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:39,820
they virtue signal as social justice warriors, and then just fly away leaving the people

50
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:45,700
there to live in the rubble. All of that nonsense, all of that talk about how we are one human

51
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:50,840
race and how all cultures are equally beautiful and how everyone's way of life is valid,

52
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:55,480
all of that comes crashing down as soon as there's an actual emergency. For those people

53
00:03:55,480 --> 00:04:00,980
who have survived solely on ideology and who have never actually experienced any real hardship,

54
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:05,220
their true feelings are laid bare when put under stress. It's a mad scramble, everyone

55
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:09,960
for themselves. But that's not everyone. A lot of people have been reacting completely

56
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:13,840
differently. Here's the story of a small business based out of Liverpool. These two

57
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:18,860
build custom 3D printers and sell them, and they've decided to use their tech to start

58
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:24,600
printing hundreds of face shields for coronavirus clinics. The crew over at the Canadian based

59
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:29,700
Linus Tech Tips YouTube channel, they've got about a dozen 3D printers, and they made

60
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:33,940
a video series on how they fired up their production to make face masks for local hospitals

61
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:39,200
in Vancouver, and how you could do the same if you also have a 3D printer. This guy mostly

62
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:43,820
talks about movies on his personal Twitter account. But his day job at a factory, they're

63
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:48,500
currently pivoting the factory to solely make surgical masks and other medical garments

64
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:54,180
in short supply. We can make two million masks a day, and check this out. Bureaucracy and

65
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:59,400
red tape are making this hard, but if anyone knows of any hospitals or facilities that

66
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:04,140
are in need of the following, please DM me. Surgical masks, face masks, surgical gowns,

67
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:09,180
coveralls, gloves, all phones for the coronavirus hotline are jammed up, as well as all number

68
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:14,420
numbers from Governor Cuomo's press conferences. If anyone has any direct contacts on how

69
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:18,120
to best supply our facilities, please let me know. It does not have to be within New

70
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:22,500
York. People keep saying it's the government that has to do something about the crisis.

71
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:27,500
But all of the raw production power that we need, that we have, comes from private industry.

72
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:31,360
And at least in some ways, the government just slows things down. Here's the CEO of

73
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:35,840
Razor, the company that makes computer mice and keyboards and stuff like that. So I haven't

74
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:39,360
had much sleep over the past couple of days to get this initiative up and running, but

75
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:42,900
I'm happy to be able to announce this on behalf of the team here at Razor.

76
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:46,840
With the worsening of the coronavirus situation, health authorities worldwide are facing an

77
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:51,020
extreme shortage of surgical masks used by the frontline healthcare staff in the battle

78
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:55,400
against the virus. Over the past few days, our designers and engineers have been working

79
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:59,960
twenty-four hour shifts to convert some of our existing manufacturing lines to produce

80
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:03,880
surgical masks that we can donate them to countries around the world. We intend to donate

81
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:08,160
up to one million masks to the health authorities of different countries globally. Elon Musk's

82
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:13,640
Tesla company has also stepped in to make ventilators and N95 face masks. And average

83
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:18,160
everyday people are joining in too. Folding at home is now more powerful than the world's

84
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:22,680
top seven supercomputers combined. Folding at home is an application you can download

85
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:27,040
and run on your computer. And what it does is it networks your computer to millions of

86
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:31,420
other computers running the application while you're not using it. Scientists have been

87
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:36,300
using everyone's computers via folding at home to study things for years now. But right

88
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:40,240
now the company running folding at home, they've decided to harness everyone's computers to

89
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:45,420
try and map out the protein sequences of the coronavirus. And so even if you can't do anything

90
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:49,740
yourself personally, if you have a computer that you're not using, you can literally just

91
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:53,980
run folding at home overnight and your CPU will automate some of the research that the

92
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:58,520
scientists are requesting. People are volunteering more than their computers. More than twenty-six

93
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:04,040
thousand joined the UK's land army to pick fruit and vegetables at farms across Britain as they

94
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:10,200
face a season without a workforce. Seven hundred and fifty thousand people also volunteered in

95
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:16,080
the UK to help the NHS. Twenty-seven thousand people signed up as volunteers to assist Canada

96
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:22,160
Health. Even ExxonMobil, not exactly a company I'd put at the top of my list for for ethical

97
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:27,640
companies, they've decided to also start making face masks. Trump's enlisted General Electric and

98
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:32,240
Phillips to make more ventilators using the Defence Production Act. I'm not fond of the

99
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:36,440
government telling private business what to what to manufacture, but apparently they're still

100
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:40,400
selling them at profit, so whatever. Basically though, where governments have begun to fail,

101
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:45,280
private citizens and corporations are actually picking up the slack. And it's also not been a

102
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:49,960
complete failure of government either. Pfizer, an American pharmaceutical company, has been

103
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:54,920
collaborating with German private businesses and is now beginning to test a possible coronavirus

104
00:07:54,920 --> 00:08:01,360
vaccine in the United States. Trudeau sunk 1.1 billion dollars to fund coronavirus vaccine

105
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:06,520
development in Canada, tapping into both Canada's universities and private medical companies. And

106
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:11,080
we are seeing the results of that effort. McMaster University is developing a home-based

107
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:16,040
coronavirus test. It acts similar to a pregnancy test and would reveal results in 20 minutes.

108
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:20,880
Researchers at the University of Western Ontario are confident that their work on a coronavirus

109
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:26,840
vaccine will soon bear fruit. The Vancouver biotech company, Abcellera Biologics, has

110
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:31,880
discovered the antibodies for coronavirus treatment. The Quebec-based company, Medicago,

111
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:37,320
is close to testing their vaccine on humans as well. These are all schools and companies that

112
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:41,960
received those grants from Trudeau's government. And although I don't approve of many of the other

113
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:46,960
things Trudeau has done, this seems to have panned out just fine. There are multiple articles and

114
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:52,240
sources saying that the Americans, Canadians, French, and Germans, both their governments

115
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:56,640
and their private industries, are at least partially collaborating on their vaccine

116
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:00,120
efforts. I haven't seen any evidence that the British are in on it, but if they are,

117
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:03,640
I wouldn't be surprised. If they're not, I wonder what they're waiting for. Because you

118
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:08,800
don't have to be either a complete isolationist or a complete open borders fanatic. There is a

119
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:13,840
middle ground there. There is no reason that like-minded, free, democratic countries can't

120
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:17,920
work together on this problem. And there's also no reason why they shouldn't get their

121
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:23,840
own cases under control before offering help to anyone else. That is how responsible people react

122
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:28,640
in a crisis. They don't leap in foolishly because they might put themselves in harm's way and just

123
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:32,600
create another victim. Adding another body to the pile won't help anyone. But at the same time,

124
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:38,320
once say Canada is safe and things are relatively under control, why wouldn't we help others? Why

125
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:42,240
wouldn't we share our research? Why wouldn't we export at least some of our excess medical

126
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:47,040
equipment, assuming that we have any? That's what aid on the global stage should be. I'll help you,

127
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:52,040
but I'm keeping my eyes open. I'm handling my own affairs first. It's not this ideological,

128
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:57,360
ever-closer union, open borders, we're all the same nonsense. Because that's just a house made

129
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:01,680
out of tissue paper. It's nonsense that just crumples in the slightest provocation. In an

130
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:06,320
emergency, you can really tell who's going to be the coward. The one that screams everyone for

131
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:11,120
themselves. The one that stampedes in a crowded theater or stabs people in the back when all hell

132
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:16,080
breaks loose. Those people are identified very easily. Just watch them when there's no crisis

133
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:20,040
in a time of plenty. If they're acting like there's nothing to prepare for, like the future

134
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:24,880
isn't potentially dangerous, if they lounge around and look at you strangely while you get your ducks

135
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:29,720
in a row, they are exactly the type of people to become unhinged once a storm comes. And this

136
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:35,600
doesn't just apply to people, it applies to nations. The arrogance of places like China or

137
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:41,920
even the EU, that was a luxury. And you can tell by their recent behaviors that that luxury has run out.
