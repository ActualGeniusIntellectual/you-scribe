0	5600	You know, despite the talk from all the globalists regarding how we're all one human species
5600	9440	and there should be no borders and we're all in this together etc etc, you can really
9440	14800	tell who actually believes that and who doesn't by looking at their coronavirus pandemic response.
14800	19260	Which nations are working together with others? Which are simply going it alone? Well the
19260	22340	results might surprise you, or maybe not.
22340	28080	Global rush for Trump-backed virus drug sparks India export ban. They're talking about
28080	33120	here I think hydroxychloroquine, which is a drug that if taken while you have the coronavirus
33120	38600	seems to at least somewhat reduce the symptoms sometimes. It's certainly not a miracle cure.
38600	42280	But as soon as this became known, suddenly India stopped exporting it. That's no big
42280	45560	deal though, hydroxychloroquine is actually pretty easy to get a hold of. The plants that
45560	49880	it comes from can basically be grown anywhere. But as you can see by the article, India banned
49880	56320	exports of a malaria drug backed by US President Donald Trump amid a run on supplies globally.
56320	60880	India is probably buying time to ensure its local needs are met first. And that actually
60880	64760	makes complete sense. It's better to help yourself before you help somebody else. Because
64760	67780	if you're incapacitated, you can't help anybody else.
67780	72120	In the States, people are stealing masks and other medical equipment from hospitals. This
72120	75360	was two months ago, so who knows if it's still happening now. But additionally, this
75360	79120	is also individual people, not the actions of a government. The article doesn't directly
79120	82320	confirm this, but the tone of it makes it sound like the people who are stealing from
82320	86420	hospitals are actually those doctors and nurses who are working there, probably stocking
86420	89400	up on their own personal supply from the hospital closets.
89400	92740	Of course, even though the media reported on this at the beginning of March, by the
92740	97040	end of March, after Trump had agreed with them that doctors and nurses were in fact
97040	102240	stealing PPE from the hospitals, the legacy media of course flip-flops. Trump could help
102240	106640	solve the mask problem and said he's making baseless attacks on New York nurses. Baseless?
106640	111960	Weren't you guys reporting that this was actually the case? French border guards impound trucks
111960	118760	filled with 130,000 facemasks bound for Britain for the NHS workers battling coronavirus.
118760	123360	After realizing what was on board, border guards in France held the truck there. Macron
123360	127880	has promised to requisition facemasks for the French crisis. I mean, presumably Britain
127880	132860	had fairly purchased those masks. It was their property and the French just took them.
132860	136920	It's okay though, according to the Global Times, which is China's English propaganda
136920	141940	outlet, China has returned the favor to the EU while American help is absent. And this
141940	145520	article is about how awesome the communist government of China is, sending all these
145520	150320	supplies to Europe. Of course, that was basically just a propaganda stunt, because almost all
150320	155520	of the actual medical supplies that are manufactured in China, but owned by American and European
155520	159760	firms are no longer leaving China, and those businesses have in fact been nationalized
159760	164600	by the Chinese. The world needs masks, China makes them but has been hoarding them. Yeah,
164600	169500	the American medical supply company 3M, they had millions of masks in China. China's
169500	173320	not letting those go. They might send over a couple of pallets of supplies to make themselves
173320	176480	look good on the world stage, but they're keeping everything now. Maybe the West should
176480	181760	move its manufacturing base out of a country that has no problem with just stealing everything
181760	185980	should the situation require it. Italy, one of the worst hit countries in Europe, has
185980	191760	been asking the EU for help, and has received nothing from them. So much for an ever-closer
191760	196080	union, I guess that's just completely abandoned as soon as a crisis comes along. So as you
196080	201900	can see, all of these places that want this globalism, that want money flowing between
201900	206220	countries, that want this privileged upper class of people who are predominantly socialist
206220	210900	leaning and who can jet set around the world having no actual ties to any one location,
210900	215300	who can fly into a community, destroy it for profit, act like they're still moral because
215300	219820	they virtue signal as social justice warriors, and then just fly away leaving the people
219820	225700	there to live in the rubble. All of that nonsense, all of that talk about how we are one human
225700	230840	race and how all cultures are equally beautiful and how everyone's way of life is valid,
230840	235480	all of that comes crashing down as soon as there's an actual emergency. For those people
235480	240980	who have survived solely on ideology and who have never actually experienced any real hardship,
240980	245220	their true feelings are laid bare when put under stress. It's a mad scramble, everyone
245220	249960	for themselves. But that's not everyone. A lot of people have been reacting completely
249960	253840	differently. Here's the story of a small business based out of Liverpool. These two
253840	258860	build custom 3D printers and sell them, and they've decided to use their tech to start
258860	264600	printing hundreds of face shields for coronavirus clinics. The crew over at the Canadian based
264600	269700	Linus Tech Tips YouTube channel, they've got about a dozen 3D printers, and they made
269700	273940	a video series on how they fired up their production to make face masks for local hospitals
273940	279200	in Vancouver, and how you could do the same if you also have a 3D printer. This guy mostly
279200	283820	talks about movies on his personal Twitter account. But his day job at a factory, they're
283820	288500	currently pivoting the factory to solely make surgical masks and other medical garments
288500	294180	in short supply. We can make two million masks a day, and check this out. Bureaucracy and
294180	299400	red tape are making this hard, but if anyone knows of any hospitals or facilities that
299400	304140	are in need of the following, please DM me. Surgical masks, face masks, surgical gowns,
304140	309180	coveralls, gloves, all phones for the coronavirus hotline are jammed up, as well as all number
309180	314420	numbers from Governor Cuomo's press conferences. If anyone has any direct contacts on how
314420	318120	to best supply our facilities, please let me know. It does not have to be within New
318120	322500	York. People keep saying it's the government that has to do something about the crisis.
322500	327500	But all of the raw production power that we need, that we have, comes from private industry.
327500	331360	And at least in some ways, the government just slows things down. Here's the CEO of
331360	335840	Razor, the company that makes computer mice and keyboards and stuff like that. So I haven't
335840	339360	had much sleep over the past couple of days to get this initiative up and running, but
339360	342900	I'm happy to be able to announce this on behalf of the team here at Razor.
342900	346840	With the worsening of the coronavirus situation, health authorities worldwide are facing an
346840	351020	extreme shortage of surgical masks used by the frontline healthcare staff in the battle
351020	355400	against the virus. Over the past few days, our designers and engineers have been working
355400	359960	twenty-four hour shifts to convert some of our existing manufacturing lines to produce
359960	363880	surgical masks that we can donate them to countries around the world. We intend to donate
363880	368160	up to one million masks to the health authorities of different countries globally. Elon Musk's
368160	373640	Tesla company has also stepped in to make ventilators and N95 face masks. And average
373640	378160	everyday people are joining in too. Folding at home is now more powerful than the world's
378160	382680	top seven supercomputers combined. Folding at home is an application you can download
382680	387040	and run on your computer. And what it does is it networks your computer to millions of
387040	391420	other computers running the application while you're not using it. Scientists have been
391420	396300	using everyone's computers via folding at home to study things for years now. But right
396300	400240	now the company running folding at home, they've decided to harness everyone's computers to
400240	405420	try and map out the protein sequences of the coronavirus. And so even if you can't do anything
405420	409740	yourself personally, if you have a computer that you're not using, you can literally just
409740	413980	run folding at home overnight and your CPU will automate some of the research that the
413980	418520	scientists are requesting. People are volunteering more than their computers. More than twenty-six
418520	424040	thousand joined the UK's land army to pick fruit and vegetables at farms across Britain as they
424040	430200	face a season without a workforce. Seven hundred and fifty thousand people also volunteered in
430200	436080	the UK to help the NHS. Twenty-seven thousand people signed up as volunteers to assist Canada
436080	442160	Health. Even ExxonMobil, not exactly a company I'd put at the top of my list for for ethical
442160	447640	companies, they've decided to also start making face masks. Trump's enlisted General Electric and
447640	452240	Phillips to make more ventilators using the Defence Production Act. I'm not fond of the
452240	456440	government telling private business what to what to manufacture, but apparently they're still
456440	460400	selling them at profit, so whatever. Basically though, where governments have begun to fail,
460400	465280	private citizens and corporations are actually picking up the slack. And it's also not been a
465280	469960	complete failure of government either. Pfizer, an American pharmaceutical company, has been
469960	474920	collaborating with German private businesses and is now beginning to test a possible coronavirus
474920	481360	vaccine in the United States. Trudeau sunk 1.1 billion dollars to fund coronavirus vaccine
481360	486520	development in Canada, tapping into both Canada's universities and private medical companies. And
486520	491080	we are seeing the results of that effort. McMaster University is developing a home-based
491080	496040	coronavirus test. It acts similar to a pregnancy test and would reveal results in 20 minutes.
496040	500880	Researchers at the University of Western Ontario are confident that their work on a coronavirus
500880	506840	vaccine will soon bear fruit. The Vancouver biotech company, Abcellera Biologics, has
506840	511880	discovered the antibodies for coronavirus treatment. The Quebec-based company, Medicago,
511880	517320	is close to testing their vaccine on humans as well. These are all schools and companies that
517320	521960	received those grants from Trudeau's government. And although I don't approve of many of the other
521960	526960	things Trudeau has done, this seems to have panned out just fine. There are multiple articles and
526960	532240	sources saying that the Americans, Canadians, French, and Germans, both their governments
532240	536640	and their private industries, are at least partially collaborating on their vaccine
536640	540120	efforts. I haven't seen any evidence that the British are in on it, but if they are,
540120	543640	I wouldn't be surprised. If they're not, I wonder what they're waiting for. Because you
543640	548800	don't have to be either a complete isolationist or a complete open borders fanatic. There is a
548800	553840	middle ground there. There is no reason that like-minded, free, democratic countries can't
553840	557920	work together on this problem. And there's also no reason why they shouldn't get their
557920	563840	own cases under control before offering help to anyone else. That is how responsible people react
563840	568640	in a crisis. They don't leap in foolishly because they might put themselves in harm's way and just
568640	572600	create another victim. Adding another body to the pile won't help anyone. But at the same time,
572600	578320	once say Canada is safe and things are relatively under control, why wouldn't we help others? Why
578320	582240	wouldn't we share our research? Why wouldn't we export at least some of our excess medical
582240	587040	equipment, assuming that we have any? That's what aid on the global stage should be. I'll help you,
587040	592040	but I'm keeping my eyes open. I'm handling my own affairs first. It's not this ideological,
592040	597360	ever-closer union, open borders, we're all the same nonsense. Because that's just a house made
597360	601680	out of tissue paper. It's nonsense that just crumples in the slightest provocation. In an
601680	606320	emergency, you can really tell who's going to be the coward. The one that screams everyone for
606320	611120	themselves. The one that stampedes in a crowded theater or stabs people in the back when all hell
611160	616080	breaks loose. Those people are identified very easily. Just watch them when there's no crisis
616080	620040	in a time of plenty. If they're acting like there's nothing to prepare for, like the future
620040	624880	isn't potentially dangerous, if they lounge around and look at you strangely while you get your ducks
624880	629720	in a row, they are exactly the type of people to become unhinged once a storm comes. And this
629720	635600	doesn't just apply to people, it applies to nations. The arrogance of places like China or
635600	641920	even the EU, that was a luxury. And you can tell by their recent behaviors that that luxury has run out.
