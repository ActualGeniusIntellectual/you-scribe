0	7360	Alright my friends, it's time to talk about the coronavirus again because this is a story and a virus that just won't die
7640	12440	official number of confirmed cases as of as a recording is 31,530 with
13880	18200	31,213 of those happening on mainland China because of travel bans and so forth
18200	24580	There's no way places like Japan or Thailand or Singapore are still taking in people who have coronavirus from China
24980	28700	So the disease is probably taking hold in those locations
29260	31880	Locally as in being transferred person to person there
31900	35480	Maybe not so much in in the West as you can see Italy has three
35740	43120	UK Russia Canada with seven France with six and the honest truth is regardless of how you feel about the the Canadian medical
43540	49980	Establishment or the American medical establishment the West is generally more able to handle this sort of thing than a place like China
49980	54440	Now the Japanese numbers have been weirdly fluctuating all day and that's because there's actually
54880	59220	60 people aboard a Japanese cruise ship and coronavirus is aboard the ship
59220	64160	So they've basically just anchored the ship out in the middle of the ocean and they're they're quarantining the whole thing
64260	69640	So for a while the Japanese numbers were slightly inflated, but they're actually just off the coast and they're not really in Japan technically
69640	72420	So fair enough, but the ship has 3,700 people
73140	76940	Because one guy from Hong Kong has the virus on the ship
76940	81900	But it's not just cruise ship shenanigans that are causing a weird fluctuations in numbers
81940	86540	Here's some data from a hospital in Wuhan and because the text is rather small and there's quite a bit here
86540	93100	I'll just sum it up for you nearly one in three patients at this Wuhan Hospital our healthcare workers themselves
93100	94940	So doctors and nurses, you know
94940	101500	you assume the people that are able to maybe wear face masks or or work with the sick with as little chance as possible of
101580	105580	Getting getting infected at least compared to a regular person who's working with the sick
105940	109620	They're still getting infected at a rate of twenty nine percent
109620	112780	That's almost one in three and since we're on the topic of the numbers
112780	115180	We have to talk about the elephant in the room and at the same time
115180	119680	This is a weird link with the the whole gaming blizzard a China story from a few months ago
120140	126700	Tencent may have accidentally leaked real data on the Wuhan virus deaths tencent briefly listed
128340	130800	154,000 and 23 infections and
131080	136080	Twenty four thousand five hundred and eighty nine deaths from the coronavirus as many experts
136360	143480	Question the veracity of China's statistics for the Wuhan coronavirus outbreak tencent over the weekend appeared to inadvertently release
143480	149020	What is potentially the actual number of infections and deaths which are far higher than the official figures?
149200	155720	But eerily in line with predictions from a respected scientific journal. They actually did this three times
155720	159460	I don't know if it's like a disgruntled employee or something or someone who wants to get the
159780	163940	Message out to the rest of the world of what's going on with the coronavirus or who knows it could be a hoax
164140	165620	They could always be a hoax, right?
165620	170480	but the fact that it happened three separate times and that it's in line with the outside estimates of the
171300	178180	Transmissibility of this thing it makes you think also to be honest as anyone is anyone seriously trusting China at this point
178180	179180	Come on, guys, come on
179180	179780	I mean
179780	187060	We already know that China spent the crucial first days of the Wuhan coronavirus outbreak arresting people who posted about it online and threatening
187140	192940	Journalists no one is surprised that China would lie regarding the official numbers and we are really seeing the power of the Chinese
193020	199780	Surveillance state at work here. If you have a Wuhan ID, even if you fled before the lockdown you're doomed
200000	204060	No hotels will allow you in no petrol station will sell gas to you
204060	208860	If you go to a Beijing hospital with a Wuhan ID, you will be pushed away. What can you do?
209060	214900	And do you remember when we all said that the Chinese social credit score system was a terrible idea and you know all the far
214940	217740	Leftist idiots in the West really really wanted one here
217740	220460	This is what you would fucking get if that's what happened
220460	226740	You would get this monstrous system where you can be tracked anywhere you are and should the government turn tyrannical enough
226740	228700	They will most certainly use it against you
228700	232860	Of course information is not the only thing being quarantined Guangzhou City
233180	239280	14 million population is now locked down all residential blocks are isolated from each other so far around
239580	243620	400 million people are locked down in China to contain the coronavirus
243620	248460	It's not a lockdown at this point then like you might as well lock down the entire country or the entire planet
248540	251500	However, despite the People's Republic of China's best efforts
252120	253300	Information is still getting out
253300	257860	There are still Chinese people who want freedom or at the very least want the world to know what's going on
257860	261420	I'm not gonna play these videos at length because I'm sure we've all seen them at this point
261420	264820	They've been floating around and going viral or repeatedly constantly
264820	268540	You've got videos of doctors talking about the actual grim situation
268740	274240	Testimonies of how people are just lying around hospital hallways or corpses are being burned in mass
274300	278980	You've got videos of people being stopped by the police then their ID checked
278980	283420	Then they're gathered up and forced into quarantine and despite China's tendency to
283820	290580	basically save face and not talk about the truth at all whenever something goes down an official told the New York Times that China is
290580	293520	Treating the situation as if it were wartime conditions
293520	298140	And if that's what the official party line is, you know, it has to be way worse than that
298260	304380	And if it's way worse than wartime conditions man, things have to be bad over there even the Global Times
305100	312100	China's official mouthpiece in the West is bracing Western industry and Western economy for a pretty big downturn in production
312260	317240	Due to the corona virus they have to know this is gonna seriously affect them even the WHO
317240	324300	Which to be honest is pretty much bought by China at this point has finally admitted that it made a massive mistake in downplaying
324300	325960	the corona virus
325960	331800	Everyone's finally coming together and saying no no, this is serious everyone but the social justice warriors
331800	336200	Of course, we live in Toronto where the SARS virus got world-scale attention
336200	342360	That's because the only people who died outside of Asia from that virus were in Canada and most of them were in Toronto with only
342400	347800	44 people dying in total in Canada. It had a huge impact on our city. We lost a lot of tourism
347800	353440	We lost millions of dollars, but most importantly we saw a lot of stigma and racism towards Chinese people
353480	358400	It's important that we do not repeat those racist notions that happened here in Toronto and we all need to be aware of this
358400	360760	When we talk about the current corona virus
360760	367440	We need to listen to and trust public health professionals and we need to not overreact and we need to not use this as an excuse
367440	370740	To be racist. Yeah, it's racism. That's it
370740	375180	I mean Chinese isn't a race and we're not talking about the race of people
375180	379720	We're talking about the cultural practice of eating animals that probably shouldn't be eaten by humans
380040	384200	Because they're going to transmit to us some pretty terrible rare diseases, but forget about that
384200	386240	It's all just racism and you better shut up
386240	392040	I bet if you told a social justice warrior about China's actual racism their heads would probably explode
409720	411720	I
433120	439240	There's a reason that Finn was kept off the Star Wars posters, you know, but you know what China Daily is reporting that
439720	441720	traditional Chinese medicine is
441720	447240	Actually effective at treating the corona virus snort the rhino horn powder you bigot
447280	449600	Okay, we've kind of been goofing around so far
449600	454040	But let's actually talk about some serious science here at least as far as a layman like me can understand it
454040	458280	There is still the theory floating around that the corona virus is
458920	466000	Somehow linked to the Chinese bioweapon program that actually had labs in Wuhan. It's possible
466000	467840	I don't think it's likely but it's possible
467840	473760	additionally people are starting to lose their minds over this paper that came out of India recently where they basically said that they were
473760	479680	studying the corona virus and they discovered that there are some protein sequences or something that are similar or
480200	484560	Identical to the ones found in HIV and in fact because of this some HIV
484880	488020	Medication might actually be effective at combating the corona virus
488240	494280	This doesn't necessarily mean that the virus itself is a modified form of HIV nor does it mean that it's just as potent or?
494520	499560	Deadly or scary or whatever because to be honest even from a layman's perspective like mine
499560	505160	I'm pretty sure that there's a lot of things in the natural world that that at least share some protein sequences
505200	510020	It could quite literally be random chance and this might mean nothing but hey it might not
510680	517320	Especially since it came out that an infant in Wuhan has tested positive for coronavirus just 30 hours after birth
517320	522080	It could be the case that they simply got an infection from being in the hospital where there might have been
522320	528680	Coronavirus patients there or it might actually be the case that the infection could be contracted in the womb at the same time
528680	531900	I'm actually curious to see what the racial makeup is of
532200	537800	People who have contracted the corona virus outside of China because there also seems to be some evidence that Asians are actually at a much
537800	539700	Higher risk of contracting it though
539700	540580	I'm sure just
540580	546740	Asking that question probably makes me a racist somehow even as the scientists do their thing the rest of us just seem to be spinning
546740	548740	off into crazy town for example
549300	555740	Horseback knight in armor guards the entrance to a Chinese village in bid to stop anyone with coronavirus
556180	558180	from bringing in the infection
559140	561140	Holy shit
565180	567180	Look at this guy
569940	572180	This is some Dark Souls shit here, dude
572260	574260	Don't drink bleach
574300	578940	Four myths about the corona virus and how to spot them was somebody even trying to drink
579460	581900	Did someone actually say hey, you know what I got the coronavirus
581900	586440	You'll just clean it out of me. I crossed off China and changed it to Hong Kong
587360	590860	Chinese student brags about sneaking into Australia
590940	593740	This is just as bad as that woman who went to Paris earlier
593740	598580	These people honestly need to be charged with like spreading a bioterrorist weapon or some shit
598580	604540	This is getting ridiculous woman frightens rapist by coughing and saying she was from Wuhan
605100	608880	The would-be rapist was deterred by the possible threat of corona
609980	617060	Take that rape culture eat the bat soup you bigot and here's one from my home of Canada infect me daddy
617620	622580	Queen's University student trustee resigns after attending coronavirus party
623100	627940	Students at the virus theme party drank corona beer and wore face masks
629420	632060	You know if this student did this back in the 2000s
632060	635860	He could have gone on to have a stunning political career like after Justin Trudeau's blackface
636140	643500	Chinese sex workers say they are being discriminated against because of corona virus and have forced to slash their rates by half
643820	650460	Listen, I've said it like three times this video already. You have to eat the bat soup, especially if it's if it's in her vagina
650580	652580	Okay
653700	656960	Okay, let's get serious for a bit the corona virus whistleblower
656960	662340	Doctor dies sparking an outpouring as well as censorship on Chinese social media
662340	668780	Li Wen Lang was the first leaker of knowledge of the corona virus and it turns out in his efforts to help people recover from
668780	670420	It he has since died
670420	677060	He was one of eight whistleblowers who were reprimanded by Chinese State Police for allegedly spreading illegal and false
677340	682100	Information about the virus on Weibo the Chinese government's official social media platform
682500	687200	The hashtag I want freedom of speech started trending and it was very quickly censored
687220	693220	However, this is the latest news on Li Wen Lang because this is a just updated four hours ago. It's from today
693420	695820	He actually died several days ago
696100	699500	However, again in order for the Chinese government to save face
699700	706140	He was put on life support and the media was forced to change its reporting including apparently
706580	708060	BBC Chinese
708060	711820	Isn't the BBC funded by the UK not the Chinese state nonetheless?
711820	717940	They changed their reporting from dead to critically ill. Holy fuck if there was ever a reason to defund the BBC
717940	718900	This would be it, isn't it?
718900	721340	You know on the one hand you have a lot of people who are saying
721620	723580	That this is gonna be the next black plague
723580	726180	This is gonna be the next Spanish flu that there's gonna be millions
726180	727620	There's gonna be millions dead
727620	731540	Humanity is gonna be cold like half of us are all gonna die or some crazy nonsense
731740	734100	And then there's the other half who are saying that it's just a cold, bro
734220	736580	You shouldn't worry about it that all this reporting doesn't matter
737300	742440	That all this BS is just people stirring up trouble scare mongering, etc
742440	745060	I actually am taking a middle approach to this, you know
745060	748100	And really hit at this point if you know me, you shouldn't be surprised by that
748100	752440	I'm not necessarily like a radical fence sitter like boogie or mundane mad or something
752440	756840	But I do think that there is a middle road here that is reasonable for example
756840	760020	Firstly, we cannot trust the Chinese government's reporting on any of this
760180	762180	For example, this article was from a year ago
762260	768940	But it's still relevant apparently as I understand it the unofficial numbers of January flu deaths in mainland
768940	776340	China was nearly the same as the official numbers of total flu deaths for all of 2018 all 12 months as well as
776420	779180	exceeding the combined flu deaths for 2016 and
779740	787160	2017 China is obviously downplaying this as much as humanly possible to put themselves in the best light they can at the same time it
787160	792240	People who are comparing this to like flu deaths or whatever, they're not quite getting the point
792240	796020	There's no native resistance to it in the human population at all
796020	796480	I mean
796480	802880	Maybe something will come out of it with that that HIV investigation or the the whole it only affects Asian people thing
802880	809600	Who knows but for now we have nothing we have to wait for basically the virus to either burn itself out and
809760	816280	Kill a lot of people in the process or we have to hope that in nature an asymptomatic variant
816440	823800	Like a mutation crops up and begins inoculating people without actually spreading the virus itself. That's what happened to Ebola
823800	826680	We didn't actually stop Ebola. We just got lucky with it
826680	834120	However, this thing seems to be significantly more transmissible as well as more deadly than SARS was there's possible evidence that it can be transferred
834120	840440	From mother to child there's possible evidence that the virus can exist on surfaces for a week at a time
840720	842000	so if somebody like
842040	847840	Sneezes on a door at the grocery store and they have coronavirus and you walk by a week later and like you touch the door
847840	850040	And then you like rub your mouth or something. You've got it
850040	854080	we have evidence that it takes up to two weeks for symptoms to even appear and
854560	859320	During those two weeks. You can also pass the virus on you've got evidence that the symptoms themselves
859720	865960	Take two to three weeks to actually work through and we've also had people die from this that weren't the very old the very young
865960	869680	Or the already sick or injured but people who were perfectly healthy and in their prime
869680	873840	This is not the same situation as previous high-profile viruses here consider this
874040	879480	What if this thing turns out to actually not be all that deadly, you know a death rate of around the same percent as flu
879680	885880	but it becomes endemic but that means by the way is it becomes a situation where it just stays in the human population and
885880	889080	It flares up every you know, once a year like the cold or the flu or something
889080	891240	It's just another virus that we have to deal with
891640	896600	Humanity had a long list of STDs to deal with before AIDS came in and it just added to the misery
896600	902440	It's almost like as we eradicate old diseases new ones start to come take their place at this point
902440	904440	I don't think you can avoid
904480	910440	Catching coronavirus like if it's gonna come to your city and it's gonna infect more than like say one person in the local hospital
910440	914240	Who's like under quarantine if it actually breaks out a bit in your city?
914240	917000	You're probably just gonna catch it and you know what? It probably won't kill you
917000	920560	You might just have to lie up in bed for a few weeks with ibuprofen and you know
920600	924960	Hope it passes on its own because especially if it's if it's taking over the entire city
924960	926400	There's no way to get in a hospital bed
926400	931080	However, hey after you've got it and it passed you're probably inoculated unless for some reason you can re-catch it
931080	936160	Which would be devastating and there's also a strict economic argument to discuss here if you have say
936840	939880	20% of your population infected and they're bedridden for a month
940440	942120	What do you think that does to your economy?
942120	944400	I mean obviously money is not not more important than lives
944400	948080	But at the same time it's something that you can't really look over because the manpower matters
948080	951600	Especially if part of that manpower it should be used to fighting the virus
951600	956360	You know if all of your doctors who are actually capable of treating coronavirus get sick with it
956760	960080	You're kind of screwed. It might sound like I'm going doom and gloom on you
960080	964120	I'm not I don't think this is the end of humanity or anything. Here's what I think you should do
964640	968600	At this point the the face mask even the gas mask is probably useless
969440	972440	What you should be doing is stocking up on some food
973480	978240	Stocking up on some basic supplies, you know in case the power goes out for a few days in case you you you run out
978240	984780	In case the local supermarkets have like bare shelves and there's just no food left in your city have a stocked pantry full of
985040	987040	staple foods that you can just kind of
987320	992160	Subsist off of for for a week or two if you have to you don't have to go all tinfoil hat
992160	997080	You don't have to build yourself a bunker in your backyard and sit in there with a machine gun or something while surviving off
997080	1000520	Nothing, but Steve 1989's collection of MREs or something
1000520	1004040	But make sure that you have like a sack of rice a sack of beans
1004120	1009200	Have some stuff in deep freeze if possible get yourself a fair quantity of food that will basically
1009480	1014480	Last for long periods in a cool dry place so that if there ever is actually a shortage of anything
1014480	1018760	You'll be prepared and hey, you know what if it doesn't actually happen, you know, then just eat the food
1018760	1021360	It's not a big deal, right? There's one last thing worth talking about
1021920	1027800	YouTube has begun to put underneath every video that talks about the coronavirus a link to the
1028040	1029920	WHO's official coronavirus page
1029920	1035680	They're like they're like doing forced advertising basically on everyone's on everyone's videos on this topic at the same time though
1035720	1041440	There are reports of various insider videos like leaked videos or messages from doctors or whatever
1041860	1047680	Actually being scrubbed from YouTube because as always with current YouTube, you just can't trust them to ever tell the truth
1047680	1051120	So there's actually a bit shoot channel called Corona Chan
1051160	1056940	They are backing up every single coronavirus video that they can get their hands on they have leaked footage dumps here
1056980	1060740	They have reports from people on the street. They have reports from doctors
1061300	1066500	Basically, if something is at risk of being taken down off YouTube, it's being archived here
1066500	1071420	I highly suggest that you sub to this channel that you watch what they've got and that if you do have anything
1071420	1073700	That's a leak that might disappear in the future
1074060	1079140	Somehow contact these guys and send it over to them just because YouTube hasn't been good for the past five years
1079620	1083380	Doesn't mean that the truth should be left in their hands. In fact, it's quite the opposite
1083380	1088280	Alright my friends take care of yourself out there and good luck. It'll be okay. I love you
