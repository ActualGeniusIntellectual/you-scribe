00:00.000 --> 00:07.360
Alright my friends, it's time to talk about the coronavirus again because this is a story and a virus that just won't die

00:07.640 --> 00:12.440
official number of confirmed cases as of as a recording is 31,530 with

00:13.880 --> 00:18.200
31,213 of those happening on mainland China because of travel bans and so forth

00:18.200 --> 00:24.580
There's no way places like Japan or Thailand or Singapore are still taking in people who have coronavirus from China

00:24.980 --> 00:28.700
So the disease is probably taking hold in those locations

00:29.260 --> 00:31.880
Locally as in being transferred person to person there

00:31.900 --> 00:35.480
Maybe not so much in in the West as you can see Italy has three

00:35.740 --> 00:43.120
UK Russia Canada with seven France with six and the honest truth is regardless of how you feel about the the Canadian medical

00:43.540 --> 00:49.980
Establishment or the American medical establishment the West is generally more able to handle this sort of thing than a place like China

00:49.980 --> 00:54.440
Now the Japanese numbers have been weirdly fluctuating all day and that's because there's actually

00:54.880 --> 00:59.220
60 people aboard a Japanese cruise ship and coronavirus is aboard the ship

00:59.220 --> 01:04.160
So they've basically just anchored the ship out in the middle of the ocean and they're they're quarantining the whole thing

01:04.260 --> 01:09.640
So for a while the Japanese numbers were slightly inflated, but they're actually just off the coast and they're not really in Japan technically

01:09.640 --> 01:12.420
So fair enough, but the ship has 3,700 people

01:13.140 --> 01:16.940
Because one guy from Hong Kong has the virus on the ship

01:16.940 --> 01:21.900
But it's not just cruise ship shenanigans that are causing a weird fluctuations in numbers

01:21.940 --> 01:26.540
Here's some data from a hospital in Wuhan and because the text is rather small and there's quite a bit here

01:26.540 --> 01:33.100
I'll just sum it up for you nearly one in three patients at this Wuhan Hospital our healthcare workers themselves

01:33.100 --> 01:34.940
So doctors and nurses, you know

01:34.940 --> 01:41.500
you assume the people that are able to maybe wear face masks or or work with the sick with as little chance as possible of

01:41.580 --> 01:45.580
Getting getting infected at least compared to a regular person who's working with the sick

01:45.940 --> 01:49.620
They're still getting infected at a rate of twenty nine percent

01:49.620 --> 01:52.780
That's almost one in three and since we're on the topic of the numbers

01:52.780 --> 01:55.180
We have to talk about the elephant in the room and at the same time

01:55.180 --> 01:59.680
This is a weird link with the the whole gaming blizzard a China story from a few months ago

02:00.140 --> 02:06.700
Tencent may have accidentally leaked real data on the Wuhan virus deaths tencent briefly listed

02:08.340 --> 02:10.800
154,000 and 23 infections and

02:11.080 --> 02:16.080
Twenty four thousand five hundred and eighty nine deaths from the coronavirus as many experts

02:16.360 --> 02:23.480
Question the veracity of China's statistics for the Wuhan coronavirus outbreak tencent over the weekend appeared to inadvertently release

02:23.480 --> 02:29.020
What is potentially the actual number of infections and deaths which are far higher than the official figures?

02:29.200 --> 02:35.720
But eerily in line with predictions from a respected scientific journal. They actually did this three times

02:35.720 --> 02:39.460
I don't know if it's like a disgruntled employee or something or someone who wants to get the

02:39.780 --> 02:43.940
Message out to the rest of the world of what's going on with the coronavirus or who knows it could be a hoax

02:44.140 --> 02:45.620
They could always be a hoax, right?

02:45.620 --> 02:50.480
but the fact that it happened three separate times and that it's in line with the outside estimates of the

02:51.300 --> 02:58.180
Transmissibility of this thing it makes you think also to be honest as anyone is anyone seriously trusting China at this point

02:58.180 --> 02:59.180
Come on, guys, come on

02:59.180 --> 02:59.780
I mean

02:59.780 --> 03:07.060
We already know that China spent the crucial first days of the Wuhan coronavirus outbreak arresting people who posted about it online and threatening

03:07.140 --> 03:12.940
Journalists no one is surprised that China would lie regarding the official numbers and we are really seeing the power of the Chinese

03:13.020 --> 03:19.780
Surveillance state at work here. If you have a Wuhan ID, even if you fled before the lockdown you're doomed

03:20.000 --> 03:24.060
No hotels will allow you in no petrol station will sell gas to you

03:24.060 --> 03:28.860
If you go to a Beijing hospital with a Wuhan ID, you will be pushed away. What can you do?

03:29.060 --> 03:34.900
And do you remember when we all said that the Chinese social credit score system was a terrible idea and you know all the far

03:34.940 --> 03:37.740
Leftist idiots in the West really really wanted one here

03:37.740 --> 03:40.460
This is what you would fucking get if that's what happened

03:40.460 --> 03:46.740
You would get this monstrous system where you can be tracked anywhere you are and should the government turn tyrannical enough

03:46.740 --> 03:48.700
They will most certainly use it against you

03:48.700 --> 03:52.860
Of course information is not the only thing being quarantined Guangzhou City

03:53.180 --> 03:59.280
14 million population is now locked down all residential blocks are isolated from each other so far around

03:59.580 --> 04:03.620
400 million people are locked down in China to contain the coronavirus

04:03.620 --> 04:08.460
It's not a lockdown at this point then like you might as well lock down the entire country or the entire planet

04:08.540 --> 04:11.500
However, despite the People's Republic of China's best efforts

04:12.120 --> 04:13.300
Information is still getting out

04:13.300 --> 04:17.860
There are still Chinese people who want freedom or at the very least want the world to know what's going on

04:17.860 --> 04:21.420
I'm not gonna play these videos at length because I'm sure we've all seen them at this point

04:21.420 --> 04:24.820
They've been floating around and going viral or repeatedly constantly

04:24.820 --> 04:28.540
You've got videos of doctors talking about the actual grim situation

04:28.740 --> 04:34.240
Testimonies of how people are just lying around hospital hallways or corpses are being burned in mass

04:34.300 --> 04:38.980
You've got videos of people being stopped by the police then their ID checked

04:38.980 --> 04:43.420
Then they're gathered up and forced into quarantine and despite China's tendency to

04:43.820 --> 04:50.580
basically save face and not talk about the truth at all whenever something goes down an official told the New York Times that China is

04:50.580 --> 04:53.520
Treating the situation as if it were wartime conditions

04:53.520 --> 04:58.140
And if that's what the official party line is, you know, it has to be way worse than that

04:58.260 --> 05:04.380
And if it's way worse than wartime conditions man, things have to be bad over there even the Global Times

05:05.100 --> 05:12.100
China's official mouthpiece in the West is bracing Western industry and Western economy for a pretty big downturn in production

05:12.260 --> 05:17.240
Due to the corona virus they have to know this is gonna seriously affect them even the WHO

05:17.240 --> 05:24.300
Which to be honest is pretty much bought by China at this point has finally admitted that it made a massive mistake in downplaying

05:24.300 --> 05:25.960
the corona virus

05:25.960 --> 05:31.800
Everyone's finally coming together and saying no no, this is serious everyone but the social justice warriors

05:31.800 --> 05:36.200
Of course, we live in Toronto where the SARS virus got world-scale attention

05:36.200 --> 05:42.360
That's because the only people who died outside of Asia from that virus were in Canada and most of them were in Toronto with only

05:42.400 --> 05:47.800
44 people dying in total in Canada. It had a huge impact on our city. We lost a lot of tourism

05:47.800 --> 05:53.440
We lost millions of dollars, but most importantly we saw a lot of stigma and racism towards Chinese people

05:53.480 --> 05:58.400
It's important that we do not repeat those racist notions that happened here in Toronto and we all need to be aware of this

05:58.400 --> 06:00.760
When we talk about the current corona virus

06:00.760 --> 06:07.440
We need to listen to and trust public health professionals and we need to not overreact and we need to not use this as an excuse

06:07.440 --> 06:10.740
To be racist. Yeah, it's racism. That's it

06:10.740 --> 06:15.180
I mean Chinese isn't a race and we're not talking about the race of people

06:15.180 --> 06:19.720
We're talking about the cultural practice of eating animals that probably shouldn't be eaten by humans

06:20.040 --> 06:24.200
Because they're going to transmit to us some pretty terrible rare diseases, but forget about that

06:24.200 --> 06:26.240
It's all just racism and you better shut up

06:26.240 --> 06:32.040
I bet if you told a social justice warrior about China's actual racism their heads would probably explode

06:49.720 --> 06:51.720
I

07:13.120 --> 07:19.240
There's a reason that Finn was kept off the Star Wars posters, you know, but you know what China Daily is reporting that

07:19.720 --> 07:21.720
traditional Chinese medicine is

07:21.720 --> 07:27.240
Actually effective at treating the corona virus snort the rhino horn powder you bigot

07:27.280 --> 07:29.600
Okay, we've kind of been goofing around so far

07:29.600 --> 07:34.040
But let's actually talk about some serious science here at least as far as a layman like me can understand it

07:34.040 --> 07:38.280
There is still the theory floating around that the corona virus is

07:38.920 --> 07:46.000
Somehow linked to the Chinese bioweapon program that actually had labs in Wuhan. It's possible

07:46.000 --> 07:47.840
I don't think it's likely but it's possible

07:47.840 --> 07:53.760
additionally people are starting to lose their minds over this paper that came out of India recently where they basically said that they were

07:53.760 --> 07:59.680
studying the corona virus and they discovered that there are some protein sequences or something that are similar or

08:00.200 --> 08:04.560
Identical to the ones found in HIV and in fact because of this some HIV

08:04.880 --> 08:08.020
Medication might actually be effective at combating the corona virus

08:08.240 --> 08:14.280
This doesn't necessarily mean that the virus itself is a modified form of HIV nor does it mean that it's just as potent or?

08:14.520 --> 08:19.560
Deadly or scary or whatever because to be honest even from a layman's perspective like mine

08:19.560 --> 08:25.160
I'm pretty sure that there's a lot of things in the natural world that that at least share some protein sequences

08:25.200 --> 08:30.020
It could quite literally be random chance and this might mean nothing but hey it might not

08:30.680 --> 08:37.320
Especially since it came out that an infant in Wuhan has tested positive for coronavirus just 30 hours after birth

08:37.320 --> 08:42.080
It could be the case that they simply got an infection from being in the hospital where there might have been

08:42.320 --> 08:48.680
Coronavirus patients there or it might actually be the case that the infection could be contracted in the womb at the same time

08:48.680 --> 08:51.900
I'm actually curious to see what the racial makeup is of

08:52.200 --> 08:57.800
People who have contracted the corona virus outside of China because there also seems to be some evidence that Asians are actually at a much

08:57.800 --> 08:59.700
Higher risk of contracting it though

08:59.700 --> 09:00.580
I'm sure just

09:00.580 --> 09:06.740
Asking that question probably makes me a racist somehow even as the scientists do their thing the rest of us just seem to be spinning

09:06.740 --> 09:08.740
off into crazy town for example

09:09.300 --> 09:15.740
Horseback knight in armor guards the entrance to a Chinese village in bid to stop anyone with coronavirus

09:16.180 --> 09:18.180
from bringing in the infection

09:19.140 --> 09:21.140
Holy shit

09:25.180 --> 09:27.180
Look at this guy

09:29.940 --> 09:32.180
This is some Dark Souls shit here, dude

09:32.260 --> 09:34.260
Don't drink bleach

09:34.300 --> 09:38.940
Four myths about the corona virus and how to spot them was somebody even trying to drink

09:39.460 --> 09:41.900
Did someone actually say hey, you know what I got the coronavirus

09:41.900 --> 09:46.440
You'll just clean it out of me. I crossed off China and changed it to Hong Kong

09:47.360 --> 09:50.860
Chinese student brags about sneaking into Australia

09:50.940 --> 09:53.740
This is just as bad as that woman who went to Paris earlier

09:53.740 --> 09:58.580
These people honestly need to be charged with like spreading a bioterrorist weapon or some shit

09:58.580 --> 10:04.540
This is getting ridiculous woman frightens rapist by coughing and saying she was from Wuhan

10:05.100 --> 10:08.880
The would-be rapist was deterred by the possible threat of corona

10:09.980 --> 10:17.060
Take that rape culture eat the bat soup you bigot and here's one from my home of Canada infect me daddy

10:17.620 --> 10:22.580
Queen's University student trustee resigns after attending coronavirus party

10:23.100 --> 10:27.940
Students at the virus theme party drank corona beer and wore face masks

10:29.420 --> 10:32.060
You know if this student did this back in the 2000s

10:32.060 --> 10:35.860
He could have gone on to have a stunning political career like after Justin Trudeau's blackface

10:36.140 --> 10:43.500
Chinese sex workers say they are being discriminated against because of corona virus and have forced to slash their rates by half

10:43.820 --> 10:50.460
Listen, I've said it like three times this video already. You have to eat the bat soup, especially if it's if it's in her vagina

10:50.580 --> 10:52.580
Okay

10:53.700 --> 10:56.960
Okay, let's get serious for a bit the corona virus whistleblower

10:56.960 --> 11:02.340
Doctor dies sparking an outpouring as well as censorship on Chinese social media

11:02.340 --> 11:08.780
Li Wen Lang was the first leaker of knowledge of the corona virus and it turns out in his efforts to help people recover from

11:08.780 --> 11:10.420
It he has since died

11:10.420 --> 11:17.060
He was one of eight whistleblowers who were reprimanded by Chinese State Police for allegedly spreading illegal and false

11:17.340 --> 11:22.100
Information about the virus on Weibo the Chinese government's official social media platform

11:22.500 --> 11:27.200
The hashtag I want freedom of speech started trending and it was very quickly censored

11:27.220 --> 11:33.220
However, this is the latest news on Li Wen Lang because this is a just updated four hours ago. It's from today

11:33.420 --> 11:35.820
He actually died several days ago

11:36.100 --> 11:39.500
However, again in order for the Chinese government to save face

11:39.700 --> 11:46.140
He was put on life support and the media was forced to change its reporting including apparently

11:46.580 --> 11:48.060
BBC Chinese

11:48.060 --> 11:51.820
Isn't the BBC funded by the UK not the Chinese state nonetheless?

11:51.820 --> 11:57.940
They changed their reporting from dead to critically ill. Holy fuck if there was ever a reason to defund the BBC

11:57.940 --> 11:58.900
This would be it, isn't it?

11:58.900 --> 12:01.340
You know on the one hand you have a lot of people who are saying

12:01.620 --> 12:03.580
That this is gonna be the next black plague

12:03.580 --> 12:06.180
This is gonna be the next Spanish flu that there's gonna be millions

12:06.180 --> 12:07.620
There's gonna be millions dead

12:07.620 --> 12:11.540
Humanity is gonna be cold like half of us are all gonna die or some crazy nonsense

12:11.740 --> 12:14.100
And then there's the other half who are saying that it's just a cold, bro

12:14.220 --> 12:16.580
You shouldn't worry about it that all this reporting doesn't matter

12:17.300 --> 12:22.440
That all this BS is just people stirring up trouble scare mongering, etc

12:22.440 --> 12:25.060
I actually am taking a middle approach to this, you know

12:25.060 --> 12:28.100
And really hit at this point if you know me, you shouldn't be surprised by that

12:28.100 --> 12:32.440
I'm not necessarily like a radical fence sitter like boogie or mundane mad or something

12:32.440 --> 12:36.840
But I do think that there is a middle road here that is reasonable for example

12:36.840 --> 12:40.020
Firstly, we cannot trust the Chinese government's reporting on any of this

12:40.180 --> 12:42.180
For example, this article was from a year ago

12:42.260 --> 12:48.940
But it's still relevant apparently as I understand it the unofficial numbers of January flu deaths in mainland

12:48.940 --> 12:56.340
China was nearly the same as the official numbers of total flu deaths for all of 2018 all 12 months as well as

12:56.420 --> 12:59.180
exceeding the combined flu deaths for 2016 and

12:59.740 --> 13:07.160
2017 China is obviously downplaying this as much as humanly possible to put themselves in the best light they can at the same time it

13:07.160 --> 13:12.240
People who are comparing this to like flu deaths or whatever, they're not quite getting the point

13:12.240 --> 13:16.020
There's no native resistance to it in the human population at all

13:16.020 --> 13:16.480
I mean

13:16.480 --> 13:22.880
Maybe something will come out of it with that that HIV investigation or the the whole it only affects Asian people thing

13:22.880 --> 13:29.600
Who knows but for now we have nothing we have to wait for basically the virus to either burn itself out and

13:29.760 --> 13:36.280
Kill a lot of people in the process or we have to hope that in nature an asymptomatic variant

13:36.440 --> 13:43.800
Like a mutation crops up and begins inoculating people without actually spreading the virus itself. That's what happened to Ebola

13:43.800 --> 13:46.680
We didn't actually stop Ebola. We just got lucky with it

13:46.680 --> 13:54.120
However, this thing seems to be significantly more transmissible as well as more deadly than SARS was there's possible evidence that it can be transferred

13:54.120 --> 14:00.440
From mother to child there's possible evidence that the virus can exist on surfaces for a week at a time

14:00.720 --> 14:02.000
so if somebody like

14:02.040 --> 14:07.840
Sneezes on a door at the grocery store and they have coronavirus and you walk by a week later and like you touch the door

14:07.840 --> 14:10.040
And then you like rub your mouth or something. You've got it

14:10.040 --> 14:14.080
we have evidence that it takes up to two weeks for symptoms to even appear and

14:14.560 --> 14:19.320
During those two weeks. You can also pass the virus on you've got evidence that the symptoms themselves

14:19.720 --> 14:25.960
Take two to three weeks to actually work through and we've also had people die from this that weren't the very old the very young

14:25.960 --> 14:29.680
Or the already sick or injured but people who were perfectly healthy and in their prime

14:29.680 --> 14:33.840
This is not the same situation as previous high-profile viruses here consider this

14:34.040 --> 14:39.480
What if this thing turns out to actually not be all that deadly, you know a death rate of around the same percent as flu

14:39.680 --> 14:45.880
but it becomes endemic but that means by the way is it becomes a situation where it just stays in the human population and

14:45.880 --> 14:49.080
It flares up every you know, once a year like the cold or the flu or something

14:49.080 --> 14:51.240
It's just another virus that we have to deal with

14:51.640 --> 14:56.600
Humanity had a long list of STDs to deal with before AIDS came in and it just added to the misery

14:56.600 --> 15:02.440
It's almost like as we eradicate old diseases new ones start to come take their place at this point

15:02.440 --> 15:04.440
I don't think you can avoid

15:04.480 --> 15:10.440
Catching coronavirus like if it's gonna come to your city and it's gonna infect more than like say one person in the local hospital

15:10.440 --> 15:14.240
Who's like under quarantine if it actually breaks out a bit in your city?

15:14.240 --> 15:17.000
You're probably just gonna catch it and you know what? It probably won't kill you

15:17.000 --> 15:20.560
You might just have to lie up in bed for a few weeks with ibuprofen and you know

15:20.600 --> 15:24.960
Hope it passes on its own because especially if it's if it's taking over the entire city

15:24.960 --> 15:26.400
There's no way to get in a hospital bed

15:26.400 --> 15:31.080
However, hey after you've got it and it passed you're probably inoculated unless for some reason you can re-catch it

15:31.080 --> 15:36.160
Which would be devastating and there's also a strict economic argument to discuss here if you have say

15:36.840 --> 15:39.880
20% of your population infected and they're bedridden for a month

15:40.440 --> 15:42.120
What do you think that does to your economy?

15:42.120 --> 15:44.400
I mean obviously money is not not more important than lives

15:44.400 --> 15:48.080
But at the same time it's something that you can't really look over because the manpower matters

15:48.080 --> 15:51.600
Especially if part of that manpower it should be used to fighting the virus

15:51.600 --> 15:56.360
You know if all of your doctors who are actually capable of treating coronavirus get sick with it

15:56.760 --> 16:00.080
You're kind of screwed. It might sound like I'm going doom and gloom on you

16:00.080 --> 16:04.120
I'm not I don't think this is the end of humanity or anything. Here's what I think you should do

16:04.640 --> 16:08.600
At this point the the face mask even the gas mask is probably useless

16:09.440 --> 16:12.440
What you should be doing is stocking up on some food

16:13.480 --> 16:18.240
Stocking up on some basic supplies, you know in case the power goes out for a few days in case you you you run out

16:18.240 --> 16:24.780
In case the local supermarkets have like bare shelves and there's just no food left in your city have a stocked pantry full of

16:25.040 --> 16:27.040
staple foods that you can just kind of

16:27.320 --> 16:32.160
Subsist off of for for a week or two if you have to you don't have to go all tinfoil hat

16:32.160 --> 16:37.080
You don't have to build yourself a bunker in your backyard and sit in there with a machine gun or something while surviving off

16:37.080 --> 16:40.520
Nothing, but Steve 1989's collection of MREs or something

16:40.520 --> 16:44.040
But make sure that you have like a sack of rice a sack of beans

16:44.120 --> 16:49.200
Have some stuff in deep freeze if possible get yourself a fair quantity of food that will basically

16:49.480 --> 16:54.480
Last for long periods in a cool dry place so that if there ever is actually a shortage of anything

16:54.480 --> 16:58.760
You'll be prepared and hey, you know what if it doesn't actually happen, you know, then just eat the food

16:58.760 --> 17:01.360
It's not a big deal, right? There's one last thing worth talking about

17:01.920 --> 17:07.800
YouTube has begun to put underneath every video that talks about the coronavirus a link to the

17:08.040 --> 17:09.920
WHO's official coronavirus page

17:09.920 --> 17:15.680
They're like they're like doing forced advertising basically on everyone's on everyone's videos on this topic at the same time though

17:15.720 --> 17:21.440
There are reports of various insider videos like leaked videos or messages from doctors or whatever

17:21.860 --> 17:27.680
Actually being scrubbed from YouTube because as always with current YouTube, you just can't trust them to ever tell the truth

17:27.680 --> 17:31.120
So there's actually a bit shoot channel called Corona Chan

17:31.160 --> 17:36.940
They are backing up every single coronavirus video that they can get their hands on they have leaked footage dumps here

17:36.980 --> 17:40.740
They have reports from people on the street. They have reports from doctors

17:41.300 --> 17:46.500
Basically, if something is at risk of being taken down off YouTube, it's being archived here

17:46.500 --> 17:51.420
I highly suggest that you sub to this channel that you watch what they've got and that if you do have anything

17:51.420 --> 17:53.700
That's a leak that might disappear in the future

17:54.060 --> 17:59.140
Somehow contact these guys and send it over to them just because YouTube hasn't been good for the past five years

17:59.620 --> 18:03.380
Doesn't mean that the truth should be left in their hands. In fact, it's quite the opposite

18:03.380 --> 18:08.280
Alright my friends take care of yourself out there and good luck. It'll be okay. I love you
