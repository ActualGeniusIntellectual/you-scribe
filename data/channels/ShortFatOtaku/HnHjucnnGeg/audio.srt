1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,360
Alright my friends, it's time to talk about the coronavirus again because this is a story and a virus that just won't die

2
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:12,440
official number of confirmed cases as of as a recording is 31,530 with

3
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:18,200
31,213 of those happening on mainland China because of travel bans and so forth

4
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:24,580
There's no way places like Japan or Thailand or Singapore are still taking in people who have coronavirus from China

5
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:28,700
So the disease is probably taking hold in those locations

6
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:31,880
Locally as in being transferred person to person there

7
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:35,480
Maybe not so much in in the West as you can see Italy has three

8
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:43,120
UK Russia Canada with seven France with six and the honest truth is regardless of how you feel about the the Canadian medical

9
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:49,980
Establishment or the American medical establishment the West is generally more able to handle this sort of thing than a place like China

10
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:54,440
Now the Japanese numbers have been weirdly fluctuating all day and that's because there's actually

11
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:59,220
60 people aboard a Japanese cruise ship and coronavirus is aboard the ship

12
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:04,160
So they've basically just anchored the ship out in the middle of the ocean and they're they're quarantining the whole thing

13
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:09,640
So for a while the Japanese numbers were slightly inflated, but they're actually just off the coast and they're not really in Japan technically

14
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:12,420
So fair enough, but the ship has 3,700 people

15
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:16,940
Because one guy from Hong Kong has the virus on the ship

16
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:21,900
But it's not just cruise ship shenanigans that are causing a weird fluctuations in numbers

17
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:26,540
Here's some data from a hospital in Wuhan and because the text is rather small and there's quite a bit here

18
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:33,100
I'll just sum it up for you nearly one in three patients at this Wuhan Hospital our healthcare workers themselves

19
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:34,940
So doctors and nurses, you know

20
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:41,500
you assume the people that are able to maybe wear face masks or or work with the sick with as little chance as possible of

21
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:45,580
Getting getting infected at least compared to a regular person who's working with the sick

22
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:49,620
They're still getting infected at a rate of twenty nine percent

23
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:52,780
That's almost one in three and since we're on the topic of the numbers

24
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:55,180
We have to talk about the elephant in the room and at the same time

25
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:59,680
This is a weird link with the the whole gaming blizzard a China story from a few months ago

26
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:06,700
Tencent may have accidentally leaked real data on the Wuhan virus deaths tencent briefly listed

27
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:10,800
154,000 and 23 infections and

28
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:16,080
Twenty four thousand five hundred and eighty nine deaths from the coronavirus as many experts

29
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:23,480
Question the veracity of China's statistics for the Wuhan coronavirus outbreak tencent over the weekend appeared to inadvertently release

30
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:29,020
What is potentially the actual number of infections and deaths which are far higher than the official figures?

31
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:35,720
But eerily in line with predictions from a respected scientific journal. They actually did this three times

32
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:39,460
I don't know if it's like a disgruntled employee or something or someone who wants to get the

33
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:43,940
Message out to the rest of the world of what's going on with the coronavirus or who knows it could be a hoax

34
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:45,620
They could always be a hoax, right?

35
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:50,480
but the fact that it happened three separate times and that it's in line with the outside estimates of the

36
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:58,180
Transmissibility of this thing it makes you think also to be honest as anyone is anyone seriously trusting China at this point

37
00:02:58,180 --> 00:02:59,180
Come on, guys, come on

38
00:02:59,180 --> 00:02:59,780
I mean

39
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:07,060
We already know that China spent the crucial first days of the Wuhan coronavirus outbreak arresting people who posted about it online and threatening

40
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:12,940
Journalists no one is surprised that China would lie regarding the official numbers and we are really seeing the power of the Chinese

41
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:19,780
Surveillance state at work here. If you have a Wuhan ID, even if you fled before the lockdown you're doomed

42
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,060
No hotels will allow you in no petrol station will sell gas to you

43
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:28,860
If you go to a Beijing hospital with a Wuhan ID, you will be pushed away. What can you do?

44
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:34,900
And do you remember when we all said that the Chinese social credit score system was a terrible idea and you know all the far

45
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:37,740
Leftist idiots in the West really really wanted one here

46
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:40,460
This is what you would fucking get if that's what happened

47
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:46,740
You would get this monstrous system where you can be tracked anywhere you are and should the government turn tyrannical enough

48
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:48,700
They will most certainly use it against you

49
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:52,860
Of course information is not the only thing being quarantined Guangzhou City

50
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:59,280
14 million population is now locked down all residential blocks are isolated from each other so far around

51
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:03,620
400 million people are locked down in China to contain the coronavirus

52
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:08,460
It's not a lockdown at this point then like you might as well lock down the entire country or the entire planet

53
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:11,500
However, despite the People's Republic of China's best efforts

54
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,300
Information is still getting out

55
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:17,860
There are still Chinese people who want freedom or at the very least want the world to know what's going on

56
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:21,420
I'm not gonna play these videos at length because I'm sure we've all seen them at this point

57
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:24,820
They've been floating around and going viral or repeatedly constantly

58
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:28,540
You've got videos of doctors talking about the actual grim situation

59
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:34,240
Testimonies of how people are just lying around hospital hallways or corpses are being burned in mass

60
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:38,980
You've got videos of people being stopped by the police then their ID checked

61
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:43,420
Then they're gathered up and forced into quarantine and despite China's tendency to

62
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:50,580
basically save face and not talk about the truth at all whenever something goes down an official told the New York Times that China is

63
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:53,520
Treating the situation as if it were wartime conditions

64
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:58,140
And if that's what the official party line is, you know, it has to be way worse than that

65
00:04:58,260 --> 00:05:04,380
And if it's way worse than wartime conditions man, things have to be bad over there even the Global Times

66
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:12,100
China's official mouthpiece in the West is bracing Western industry and Western economy for a pretty big downturn in production

67
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:17,240
Due to the corona virus they have to know this is gonna seriously affect them even the WHO

68
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:24,300
Which to be honest is pretty much bought by China at this point has finally admitted that it made a massive mistake in downplaying

69
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:25,960
the corona virus

70
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:31,800
Everyone's finally coming together and saying no no, this is serious everyone but the social justice warriors

71
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:36,200
Of course, we live in Toronto where the SARS virus got world-scale attention

72
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:42,360
That's because the only people who died outside of Asia from that virus were in Canada and most of them were in Toronto with only

73
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:47,800
44 people dying in total in Canada. It had a huge impact on our city. We lost a lot of tourism

74
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:53,440
We lost millions of dollars, but most importantly we saw a lot of stigma and racism towards Chinese people

75
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:58,400
It's important that we do not repeat those racist notions that happened here in Toronto and we all need to be aware of this

76
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,760
When we talk about the current corona virus

77
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:07,440
We need to listen to and trust public health professionals and we need to not overreact and we need to not use this as an excuse

78
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:10,740
To be racist. Yeah, it's racism. That's it

79
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:15,180
I mean Chinese isn't a race and we're not talking about the race of people

80
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:19,720
We're talking about the cultural practice of eating animals that probably shouldn't be eaten by humans

81
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:24,200
Because they're going to transmit to us some pretty terrible rare diseases, but forget about that

82
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:26,240
It's all just racism and you better shut up

83
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:32,040
I bet if you told a social justice warrior about China's actual racism their heads would probably explode

84
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:51,720
I

85
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:19,240
There's a reason that Finn was kept off the Star Wars posters, you know, but you know what China Daily is reporting that

86
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:21,720
traditional Chinese medicine is

87
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:27,240
Actually effective at treating the corona virus snort the rhino horn powder you bigot

88
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,600
Okay, we've kind of been goofing around so far

89
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:34,040
But let's actually talk about some serious science here at least as far as a layman like me can understand it

90
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:38,280
There is still the theory floating around that the corona virus is

91
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:46,000
Somehow linked to the Chinese bioweapon program that actually had labs in Wuhan. It's possible

92
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,840
I don't think it's likely but it's possible

93
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:53,760
additionally people are starting to lose their minds over this paper that came out of India recently where they basically said that they were

94
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:59,680
studying the corona virus and they discovered that there are some protein sequences or something that are similar or

95
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:04,560
Identical to the ones found in HIV and in fact because of this some HIV

96
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:08,020
Medication might actually be effective at combating the corona virus

97
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:14,280
This doesn't necessarily mean that the virus itself is a modified form of HIV nor does it mean that it's just as potent or?

98
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:19,560
Deadly or scary or whatever because to be honest even from a layman's perspective like mine

99
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:25,160
I'm pretty sure that there's a lot of things in the natural world that that at least share some protein sequences

100
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:30,020
It could quite literally be random chance and this might mean nothing but hey it might not

101
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:37,320
Especially since it came out that an infant in Wuhan has tested positive for coronavirus just 30 hours after birth

102
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:42,080
It could be the case that they simply got an infection from being in the hospital where there might have been

103
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:48,680
Coronavirus patients there or it might actually be the case that the infection could be contracted in the womb at the same time

104
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:51,900
I'm actually curious to see what the racial makeup is of

105
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:57,800
People who have contracted the corona virus outside of China because there also seems to be some evidence that Asians are actually at a much

106
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,700
Higher risk of contracting it though

107
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:00,580
I'm sure just

108
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:06,740
Asking that question probably makes me a racist somehow even as the scientists do their thing the rest of us just seem to be spinning

109
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:08,740
off into crazy town for example

110
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:15,740
Horseback knight in armor guards the entrance to a Chinese village in bid to stop anyone with coronavirus

111
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:18,180
from bringing in the infection

112
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:21,140
Holy shit

113
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:27,180
Look at this guy

114
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:32,180
This is some Dark Souls shit here, dude

115
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:34,260
Don't drink bleach

116
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:38,940
Four myths about the corona virus and how to spot them was somebody even trying to drink

117
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:41,900
Did someone actually say hey, you know what I got the coronavirus

118
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:46,440
You'll just clean it out of me. I crossed off China and changed it to Hong Kong

119
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:50,860
Chinese student brags about sneaking into Australia

120
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:53,740
This is just as bad as that woman who went to Paris earlier

121
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:58,580
These people honestly need to be charged with like spreading a bioterrorist weapon or some shit

122
00:09:58,580 --> 00:10:04,540
This is getting ridiculous woman frightens rapist by coughing and saying she was from Wuhan

123
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:08,880
The would-be rapist was deterred by the possible threat of corona

124
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:17,060
Take that rape culture eat the bat soup you bigot and here's one from my home of Canada infect me daddy

125
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:22,580
Queen's University student trustee resigns after attending coronavirus party

126
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:27,940
Students at the virus theme party drank corona beer and wore face masks

127
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:32,060
You know if this student did this back in the 2000s

128
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:35,860
He could have gone on to have a stunning political career like after Justin Trudeau's blackface

129
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:43,500
Chinese sex workers say they are being discriminated against because of corona virus and have forced to slash their rates by half

130
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:50,460
Listen, I've said it like three times this video already. You have to eat the bat soup, especially if it's if it's in her vagina

131
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:52,580
Okay

132
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:56,960
Okay, let's get serious for a bit the corona virus whistleblower

133
00:10:56,960 --> 00:11:02,340
Doctor dies sparking an outpouring as well as censorship on Chinese social media

134
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:08,780
Li Wen Lang was the first leaker of knowledge of the corona virus and it turns out in his efforts to help people recover from

135
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:10,420
It he has since died

136
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:17,060
He was one of eight whistleblowers who were reprimanded by Chinese State Police for allegedly spreading illegal and false

137
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:22,100
Information about the virus on Weibo the Chinese government's official social media platform

138
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:27,200
The hashtag I want freedom of speech started trending and it was very quickly censored

139
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:33,220
However, this is the latest news on Li Wen Lang because this is a just updated four hours ago. It's from today

140
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:35,820
He actually died several days ago

141
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:39,500
However, again in order for the Chinese government to save face

142
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:46,140
He was put on life support and the media was forced to change its reporting including apparently

143
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:48,060
BBC Chinese

144
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:51,820
Isn't the BBC funded by the UK not the Chinese state nonetheless?

145
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:57,940
They changed their reporting from dead to critically ill. Holy fuck if there was ever a reason to defund the BBC

146
00:11:57,940 --> 00:11:58,900
This would be it, isn't it?

147
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:01,340
You know on the one hand you have a lot of people who are saying

148
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:03,580
That this is gonna be the next black plague

149
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:06,180
This is gonna be the next Spanish flu that there's gonna be millions

150
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:07,620
There's gonna be millions dead

151
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:11,540
Humanity is gonna be cold like half of us are all gonna die or some crazy nonsense

152
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:14,100
And then there's the other half who are saying that it's just a cold, bro

153
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:16,580
You shouldn't worry about it that all this reporting doesn't matter

154
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:22,440
That all this BS is just people stirring up trouble scare mongering, etc

155
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:25,060
I actually am taking a middle approach to this, you know

156
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:28,100
And really hit at this point if you know me, you shouldn't be surprised by that

157
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:32,440
I'm not necessarily like a radical fence sitter like boogie or mundane mad or something

158
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:36,840
But I do think that there is a middle road here that is reasonable for example

159
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:40,020
Firstly, we cannot trust the Chinese government's reporting on any of this

160
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:42,180
For example, this article was from a year ago

161
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:48,940
But it's still relevant apparently as I understand it the unofficial numbers of January flu deaths in mainland

162
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:56,340
China was nearly the same as the official numbers of total flu deaths for all of 2018 all 12 months as well as

163
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:59,180
exceeding the combined flu deaths for 2016 and

164
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:07,160
2017 China is obviously downplaying this as much as humanly possible to put themselves in the best light they can at the same time it

165
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:12,240
People who are comparing this to like flu deaths or whatever, they're not quite getting the point

166
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:16,020
There's no native resistance to it in the human population at all

167
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:16,480
I mean

168
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:22,880
Maybe something will come out of it with that that HIV investigation or the the whole it only affects Asian people thing

169
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:29,600
Who knows but for now we have nothing we have to wait for basically the virus to either burn itself out and

170
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:36,280
Kill a lot of people in the process or we have to hope that in nature an asymptomatic variant

171
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:43,800
Like a mutation crops up and begins inoculating people without actually spreading the virus itself. That's what happened to Ebola

172
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:46,680
We didn't actually stop Ebola. We just got lucky with it

173
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:54,120
However, this thing seems to be significantly more transmissible as well as more deadly than SARS was there's possible evidence that it can be transferred

174
00:13:54,120 --> 00:14:00,440
From mother to child there's possible evidence that the virus can exist on surfaces for a week at a time

175
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,000
so if somebody like

176
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:07,840
Sneezes on a door at the grocery store and they have coronavirus and you walk by a week later and like you touch the door

177
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:10,040
And then you like rub your mouth or something. You've got it

178
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:14,080
we have evidence that it takes up to two weeks for symptoms to even appear and

179
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:19,320
During those two weeks. You can also pass the virus on you've got evidence that the symptoms themselves

180
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:25,960
Take two to three weeks to actually work through and we've also had people die from this that weren't the very old the very young

181
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:29,680
Or the already sick or injured but people who were perfectly healthy and in their prime

182
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:33,840
This is not the same situation as previous high-profile viruses here consider this

183
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:39,480
What if this thing turns out to actually not be all that deadly, you know a death rate of around the same percent as flu

184
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:45,880
but it becomes endemic but that means by the way is it becomes a situation where it just stays in the human population and

185
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:49,080
It flares up every you know, once a year like the cold or the flu or something

186
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:51,240
It's just another virus that we have to deal with

187
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:56,600
Humanity had a long list of STDs to deal with before AIDS came in and it just added to the misery

188
00:14:56,600 --> 00:15:02,440
It's almost like as we eradicate old diseases new ones start to come take their place at this point

189
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:04,440
I don't think you can avoid

190
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:10,440
Catching coronavirus like if it's gonna come to your city and it's gonna infect more than like say one person in the local hospital

191
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:14,240
Who's like under quarantine if it actually breaks out a bit in your city?

192
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:17,000
You're probably just gonna catch it and you know what? It probably won't kill you

193
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,560
You might just have to lie up in bed for a few weeks with ibuprofen and you know

194
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:24,960
Hope it passes on its own because especially if it's if it's taking over the entire city

195
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:26,400
There's no way to get in a hospital bed

196
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:31,080
However, hey after you've got it and it passed you're probably inoculated unless for some reason you can re-catch it

197
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:36,160
Which would be devastating and there's also a strict economic argument to discuss here if you have say

198
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:39,880
20% of your population infected and they're bedridden for a month

199
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,120
What do you think that does to your economy?

200
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:44,400
I mean obviously money is not not more important than lives

201
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:48,080
But at the same time it's something that you can't really look over because the manpower matters

202
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:51,600
Especially if part of that manpower it should be used to fighting the virus

203
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:56,360
You know if all of your doctors who are actually capable of treating coronavirus get sick with it

204
00:15:56,760 --> 00:16:00,080
You're kind of screwed. It might sound like I'm going doom and gloom on you

205
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:04,120
I'm not I don't think this is the end of humanity or anything. Here's what I think you should do

206
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:08,600
At this point the the face mask even the gas mask is probably useless

207
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:12,440
What you should be doing is stocking up on some food

208
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:18,240
Stocking up on some basic supplies, you know in case the power goes out for a few days in case you you you run out

209
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:24,780
In case the local supermarkets have like bare shelves and there's just no food left in your city have a stocked pantry full of

210
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:27,040
staple foods that you can just kind of

211
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:32,160
Subsist off of for for a week or two if you have to you don't have to go all tinfoil hat

212
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:37,080
You don't have to build yourself a bunker in your backyard and sit in there with a machine gun or something while surviving off

213
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:40,520
Nothing, but Steve 1989's collection of MREs or something

214
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:44,040
But make sure that you have like a sack of rice a sack of beans

215
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:49,200
Have some stuff in deep freeze if possible get yourself a fair quantity of food that will basically

216
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:54,480
Last for long periods in a cool dry place so that if there ever is actually a shortage of anything

217
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:58,760
You'll be prepared and hey, you know what if it doesn't actually happen, you know, then just eat the food

218
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:01,360
It's not a big deal, right? There's one last thing worth talking about

219
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:07,800
YouTube has begun to put underneath every video that talks about the coronavirus a link to the

220
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:09,920
WHO's official coronavirus page

221
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:15,680
They're like they're like doing forced advertising basically on everyone's on everyone's videos on this topic at the same time though

222
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:21,440
There are reports of various insider videos like leaked videos or messages from doctors or whatever

223
00:17:21,860 --> 00:17:27,680
Actually being scrubbed from YouTube because as always with current YouTube, you just can't trust them to ever tell the truth

224
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:31,120
So there's actually a bit shoot channel called Corona Chan

225
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:36,940
They are backing up every single coronavirus video that they can get their hands on they have leaked footage dumps here

226
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:40,740
They have reports from people on the street. They have reports from doctors

227
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:46,500
Basically, if something is at risk of being taken down off YouTube, it's being archived here

228
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:51,420
I highly suggest that you sub to this channel that you watch what they've got and that if you do have anything

229
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:53,700
That's a leak that might disappear in the future

230
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:59,140
Somehow contact these guys and send it over to them just because YouTube hasn't been good for the past five years

231
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:03,380
Doesn't mean that the truth should be left in their hands. In fact, it's quite the opposite

232
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:08,280
Alright my friends take care of yourself out there and good luck. It'll be okay. I love you
