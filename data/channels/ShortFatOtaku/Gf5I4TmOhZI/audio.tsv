0	6640	good morning my friends welcome to sj weekly what is this the sixth the seventh i forgot it
6640	12720	um but it's for august 5th 2018 and uh listen to this
18880	24960	that is the sound of a delicious morning coffee and yeah yeah i'm kind of a coffee
24960	32080	fag i i definitely like to uh indulge in a in a morning coffee it's one of the few
32080	38960	pleasures left in life it seems um but let's start with on the washington post and i'm actually
38960	45360	doing this incognito mode because they don't like ad blocker which i did finally get and they don't
45360	49520	like the fact that i've looked at too many articles on their site this month even though
49520	56720	it's only been five fucking days so is your spin class too young too thin and too white
56720	63600	the epitome of first world problems as boutique exercise studios expanded a rapid clip some are
63600	68800	questioning who's welcome after a few committed months of hot yoga at a studio in new york
68800	73360	christina rice had found her niche so when the studio announced that it was offering teacher
73360	78240	training she signed right up it was only when she arrived with her mat that she noticed something
78240	84000	striking there were 54 other women and men in the 10-week course and not one of them looked
84000	89920	like her she was the lone african-american in the class i did bond with some of the other students
89920	96240	says rice but i did feel very isolated at times there were no teachers of color i didn't have
96240	101200	another woman who looked like me who understood my struggles my insecurities it's it's just
101200	110640	fucking yoga dude do you really need to to be performing yoga of color this really sounds like
110640	117920	an entitled frankly rich black woman complaining that there aren't more entitled rich black women
117920	125040	for her to hang out with if you went to like any of the united states's poor black population
125040	130720	they would laugh this woman out of the hood boutique workout studios specialized exercise
130800	136560	specific gyms are exploding in gentrifying urban areas well maybe that's why you don't see many
136560	142240	black people there they include not only hot yoga but also crossfit which is everywhere berry's
142240	148960	boot camp soul cycle or orange theory they are the modern answer to the sprawling soulless gym
148960	154000	which insists on financial commitment but doesn't really care whether you actually work out in the
154000	158960	boutique world you make reservations you're greeted with smiles you're served an ice-cold
158960	165040	glass of the spin class is self-care kool-aid this really sounds like somebody who who just
165040	171920	couldn't make it at a regular gym gyms can be sprawling and they can be soulless but they
171920	178880	require you to be the engine not some kind of external force the point of a gym is that you go
178880	185200	and work out and you have to push yourself to work out and if you're incapable of pushing yourself to
185200	191200	lift those weights and you need something like say a boutique workout studio where you have
191200	195200	somebody leading you in the exercise you know of course if you want to pay your money and go do
195200	200560	that it's it's you're right right but this really sounds like it's looking down its nose at gyms and
200560	205120	by extension the people that can actually self-motivate and here's where we can see that
205120	210640	having a leader in your exercise is actually a privilege but some people have begun to question
210640	217280	the stark differences between the studios and the neighborhood ymca like the prices in washington
217280	225200	a single 50-minute barry's boot camp class is 34 spinning studio flywheel charges 30 solid core can
225200	230640	run as much as 37 or about half the cost of a monthly membership in most urban gyms that's
230640	236480	because these places come with trainers built into them if you go to a gym with a trainer it's going
236480	241120	to be a lot more expensive than if you just go to a gym and follow a workout that you found on fit
241120	247280	or something and like rice other fitness junkies have begun to notice who isn't coming sweat
247280	252880	through a class in one of these studios and it's very possible that you'll see it many many lith
252880	260480	young white bodies and few people of color or older or heavier exercisers maybe it's because
260480	265680	as you said this is happening in young white gentrifying areas maybe it's because a privilege
265680	274800	that only rich white kids can afford maybe maybe it's because older people generally don't want to
274800	280800	take care of themselves or at least not in this manner usually old people don't work out or if
280800	287040	they do work out they go to gyms but long who is african-american and hispanic is struck by what
287040	293440	she sees there what is their messaging saying about aging what is fit what is beauty i look at
293440	298240	everything from the signage to the marketing materials and all she sees are millennials how
298240	305120	open and inclusive is that well i mean what do you want to do do you want to force old black people
305120	311120	at gunpoint to come to these these gyms stanley who has gained some fame with her criticisms of
311120	316480	boutique workout and yoga culture's lack of diversity describes the studio she has visited
316480	322000	outside the big city bubble as anything but diverse she tackles the subject in her book
322000	328640	everybody yoga the issue she says extends beyond race i definitely want to find a copy of this book
328640	334560	now oh there's actually an amazon link well i'm not gonna pay for it um she's often the only fat
334560	338640	woman in the room as well she says and if you're looking for a mature crowd you have to keep looking
338640	343600	too by the health club association's reckoning the average age of studio exercisers is 30
344320	349760	the messaging says stanley is essentially you're allowed in the space if you're white slender able
349760	355600	body and less than 45 cisgender and heterosexual and if you're not then you're not welcome except
356960	362240	stanley you look like somebody who is none of those things and obviously you're attending
362240	368480	these studios maybe it's not that people aren't allowed in these studios maybe it's that they
368480	376160	don't want to go maybe it's that people have the freedom of choice to choose whether they want to
376160	382640	go to an exercise studio or a gym or to just work out at home or to not work out at all maybe it's
382640	388640	not a race and gender issue and maybe you don't need to make everything a race and gender issue
388640	393520	okay this is stupid i'm moving on to the next article uh i skimmed the rest of this off camera
393520	398160	and it's all literally just the same bullshit blaming white people because black people don't
398160	403200	want to attend these ridiculous fucking studios okay i'm done well maybe if those minorities had
403200	407520	more money in their pockets they would attend those studios but it turns out that might not be
407520	414160	the case finland's basic income test wasn't ambitious enough the payments encourage
414160	421200	beneficiaries to take work that doesn't pay a living wage kela the finnish social security agency
421200	425280	has failed to secure the funding it needs to extend its universal basic income experiment
425280	431680	beyond this year although it's sad that this grand leftist idea is suffering yet another setback
431680	436800	finland's trial effort deserved its fate before the experiment was approved by the government in
436800	445520	2016 kela officials talked about paying 800 euros or 974 a month in unconditional income to test a
445520	451200	group of working age citizens but by the time the program began early last year the amount was
451200	457280	whittled down to 560 euros if extended to the whole country the cost of the earlier proposal
457280	462320	would have exceeded the finnish government's entire revenue a similarly impractical approach
462320	469680	led to the failure of a 2016 swiss referendum on offering a payout of 2500 swiss francs it's almost
469680	475760	like if you keep giving away people's money for nothing you will run out of money it's all but
475760	481360	impossible to live on 560 euros in finland a one-bedroom apartment on the outskirts of helinski
481360	486320	rents for almost that much so the experiment's designer settled on not really paying the ubi to
486320	491520	the unemployed who kept a higher level of government support at least 32.4 euros a day
491520	497040	for the first 400 days after losing a job only the working poor would benefit significantly from it
497040	504640	i'm sure that you and i know that the reason this failed is because you can't just throw money at
504640	510240	problems and hope they go away there is definitely a problem with with grinding poverty there's
510240	516080	definitely a problem with people not being able to get an education or start a business or do what
516080	521440	they want to do with their lives but you can't just mindlessly throw gobs of cash and expect
521440	526160	the problem to fix itself but i have a feeling that this article i haven't i haven't read the
526160	530800	whole thing yet but i have a feeling that the slant is going to take is that they didn't give
530800	536480	enough money not that the idea of the ubi is inherently flawed finland has a low employment
536480	541440	rate for a rich country just 71% of the working age population compared to 77% in neighboring
541440	545600	sweden and almost 86 percent in iceland so the idea was to provide an incentive for the
545600	550640	unemployed to step into the job market even if it meant taking on part-time or badly paid work
551280	556160	the other goal was to simplify finland's complex system of housing child care and other benefits
556160	561840	by replacing them with the lump sum payment i don't know if giving people money for nothing
561840	569040	is going to incentivize them to take on part-time or badly paid work you know the the point of
569120	576160	something like a ubi is to one rescue people in grinding poverty who just cannot who have
576160	582320	nothing zero just can't get ahead because they have no base with which to start and two it's
582320	589280	to assist people in you know if they're if they're working something like part-time work or badly paid
589280	595440	work it's to assist them into having a buffer so that they can maybe invest in themselves or go
595440	601200	back to school or on the side start their business it's to help ambitious people however this article
601200	606800	and in general ubi supporters seem to assume that all people are ambitious people which is just not
606800	612480	the case the ubi is not going to get people into part-time or badly paid work it's designed to get
612480	618320	ambitious people without resources out of that work keela is not promising to release any results
618320	624160	of the experiment nobody's surprise there which involves 2 000 people until the end of 2019 or
624160	629760	even the beginning of 2020 but it was clear from the start that a basic income even such a low one
629760	635680	is an extremely expensive way to boost precarious forms of employment at 550 euros a month keela
635680	643360	calculated the ubi would cost 19.3 billion euros a year while the government would only save 3.6
643360	648080	billion euros on existing benefits as for getting people to return to the job market the center-right
648080	655200	cabinet of prime minister uh juha i don't know how to pronounce that juha sapila appears to be
655200	659680	more interested in cost-effective negative motivation for the unemployed than in rewarding
659680	664480	them for finding work that doesn't pay a living wage the government has proposed for example
664480	670080	requiring out-of-work people to apply for at least one job a week to keep receiving benefits unless
670080	675920	they're in job training programs i never i never really thought i'd see the day that i'd be agreeing
675920	680800	with right-leaning politicians or parliaments but that's really how things have been going the past
680800	686320	few years the ubi idea is not dead it's still worth watching other experiments especially the
686320	691280	ones that actually provide a living income these include oakland california which pays two thousand
691280	697840	dollars a month almost exactly the poverty line and the one in kenya which plays 23 a month about
697840	703680	half the average income in the country's rural areas other tests in dutch city of utrecht and
703680	708320	an upcoming one in ontario canada i'll i'll correct you right now that one has actually
708320	713520	ended and has not went well um offer low payouts relative to the living standard but still higher
713520	718480	than in the finished test i don't know the ubi is an answer to the right question but it's the
718480	723040	wrong answer at the very least though they are asking the right questions it's it's not quite
723040	727600	as bad as communists who just don't understand economics proponents of the ubi understand that
727600	734720	at least people need to work and they're saying well how about we just give them some money
734720	739760	and allow them to work on what they want well that's it's it's better than assuming that all
739760	744400	people are the same which is what communism does but it's still it's still not gonna work because
744400	750160	there will be too many people who will just take the money and not work in my opinion um loans or
750160	757040	grants for for school or loans or grants for starting small businesses um that's the way
757040	762880	that we should be going because that will actually provide people who are ambitious but poor
763600	770240	with the resources that they need to actually get their lives going not something like a ubi i still
770240	774240	can't quite tell which way this article is leaning which i guess is actually a good thing at least
774240	778480	it's it's somewhat neutral but uh here's an article that is just straight up parody and i
778480	784400	actually had to read the first couple sentences before i could figure it out um fact all tragedy
784480	790240	happens because of toxic masculinity and lack of communism this is uh during the time that
790240	794800	the mandalay bay shootings happened last year the think peace factory is an overdrive over the
794800	798800	las vegas massacre just about every thought piece you're going to read about las vegas will have one
798800	803200	of two themes about motive the tragedy happened because toxic masculinity which is the feminist
803200	807920	cop-out for everything or the tragedy happened because the lack of full communism in the presence
807920	812960	of white people which is the sociology pre-grad cop-out for everything i'm sure toxic masculinity
812960	818480	is what caused a sextagarian to commit mass murder it's also the reason why my crank case
818480	823360	is habitually low on oil why septa is late and why my hoagie has too few jalapenos in it
824000	829200	the other craptastic category of hot takes is a shitty reduction of economic theory when there are
829200	833360	any study sources they point to fringe theory that's not generally accepted or it's way out
833360	838480	of context or it's just bad quoting and use of stats and this article is basically about
839120	846480	uh shitty clickbait and it actually shows a real a real headline here can a shift in the perception
846480	853760	of masculinity curb mass violence so yeah people actually made made shit like this back when the
853760	859120	the mandalay bay shootings were happening people actually did blame it on toxic masculinity and we
859120	864800	have reached a point where satire of something like this article is nearly indistinguishable
865760	871520	and speaking of satire here's an article that frankly could be read as satire but it's not
871520	877120	women work longer as the men cut their hours now this is not how this originally read they have
877120	884160	changed the title and it used to read this woman work longer hours than men that's all it said
884160	890480	before and they realized that they had kind of fucked up and here's why a nationwide survey of
890480	896640	1600 employees found that women now work almost 34 hours a week on average half a day longer than
896640	903120	the figure of 30.4 hours five years ago over the same five-year period men's average work hours
903120	909760	fell from 45.5 hours per week to 44.8 hours although among the hardest working males the
909760	916720	number putting in more than 49 hours a week has passed the 3 million mark so even as the headline
916720	923120	says women work longer hours than men immediately in the first few paragraphs they contradict that
923120	929600	women now work almost 34 hours a week men's average work hours fell to 44.8 hours there is
929600	935600	no way the headline is in any way reflective of reality which is why the url of the article still
935600	940400	says women work longer hours than men and they changed the headline because they were immediately
940400	945440	found out as the hacks that the daily mail actually are and really if you want an explanation of the
945440	953040	gender pay gap it's right here all right women work 34 hours a week on average men work 44.8
953040	958560	hours a week on average that's a pretty decent explanation don't you think men are working 10
958560	964560	more hours per week on average maybe they're making 10 more hours per week worth of money
964560	969040	on average or here's another reason almost three quarters of those working long hours
969680	974800	that would be mostly men admitted that they were likely to go to work even if they were ill
974800	979280	while two-thirds had gone to the office on public holidays in the past year and a half
979280	984560	and said they would put work ahead of personal commitment well there you go maybe that's the
984560	988000	gender pay gap there's a lot of things that could be the gender pay gap how about this
988000	993440	women are also more likely to be found in relatively poorly paid caring professions than men
993440	999760	pushing down their overall average wages well it's not that women are to be found in these professions
999760	1005120	women choose to be in these professions they take these jobs they go to these schools they
1005120	1012160	choose these careers for themselves but let's keep talking statistics with new hampshire 94 white
1012160	1021120	asks how do you diversify a whole state this is a ridiculous proposition for multiple reasons
1021120	1029440	one locations as in wide huge areas of land do not need to be diversified you do not need to push
1029680	1035600	out people who are currently living there you do not need to to force some kind of intermingling
1035600	1041520	or race mixing you just let people do what they want to do let them live where they want to live
1041520	1047280	in fact as i recall pushing out an entire group of people and replacing them with another group
1047280	1053760	of people even if you don't kill them is still considered to be ethnic cleansing under
1053760	1060000	international law so why would you want to diversify new hampshire why don't you just
1060560	1068640	keep it the way it is why don't you allow people to move as they see fit catalina selentano used
1068640	1074480	to hold trading sessions for hospital workers in lynn massachusetts to familiarize them with
1074480	1078880	the cultures of patients from cambodia russia and the dominican republic when she moved to
1078880	1085840	new hampshire she suddenly found herself in an ethnic vacuum well if being in an ethnic vacuum
1085840	1092880	was that distressing to you why did you move to new hampshire if you wanted to live in the culture
1092880	1099520	that you were born in and raised in why didn't you stay in the location and with the people from that
1099520	1105120	culture i went from being able to speak spanish every day to not speaking spanish at all because
1105120	1110080	there wasn't anybody to speak spanish to you don't get to move to a place and demand everyone
1110080	1115440	change to suit your needs new hampshire like its neighbors vermont and maine is nearly all white
1115440	1120320	this has posed an array of problems for new arrivals who often find themselves isolated
1120320	1125360	and alone without the comfort and support of a built-in community well that's why it's called
1125360	1132000	a built-in community somebody had to build it and if you're not up to the task of building a
1132000	1139440	community if you want the government to diversify new hampshire then you need to leave it's that
1139440	1144720	simple it has also posed problems for employers in these states who find that their homogeneity
1144720	1149280	can be a barrier to recruiting and retaining workers of different ethnicities and cultural
1149280	1154560	backgrounds again that's only a problem if you care about ticking off these these ridiculous
1154560	1161360	boxes on a list if you just hire the best people for the job and don't give a shit about race none
1161360	1165600	of this matters the issue prompted about a hundred business leaders government officials
1165600	1170400	and members of non-profit organizations to meet thursday to search for ways that new hampshire
1170400	1176080	which is 94 white might lure other racial and ethnic groups as well as younger people
1176080	1181360	maybe they don't explicitly need to do that maybe they just maybe they should just lure people you
1181360	1187600	know qualified people for the jobs that they have and then see who shows up and if it turns out that
1187600	1192560	a bunch more white people show up it shouldn't matter diversity quotas are going to be the
1192560	1197520	downfall of all of these initiatives with non-whites poised to make up a majority of
1197520	1202480	the american population in the next three decades diversity has become a bottom line imperative for
1202480	1207120	companies competing for talent especially for workers who can speak other languages man the
1207120	1213600	way that the term non-whites is used there it's almost the way that the kkk used it like 50 years
1213600	1219440	ago as it stands new hampshire is three percent latino two percent african-american and three
1219440	1227120	percent asian the nation as a whole is 17 latino 14 African-American and six percent asian well
1227120	1232560	that means that states that aren't new hampshire some other states they have a ratio of latinos
1232560	1239280	that is higher than 17 a ratio of african-americans that is higher than 14 and a ratio of asians that
1239280	1245280	is higher than six percent and nobody nobody is calling for more white people to be imported to
1245280	1253360	those states there's no massive call to diversify the latino and black south right now nobody cares
1253360	1258400	about that shit nobody cares about bringing white people into those states but when when white
1258400	1263840	people hold a 94 majority you got to start bringing people in it's it's a ridiculous idea
1263840	1268880	it doesn't matter the race doesn't matter it's not just the social justice groups that are doing this
1269040	1273520	it's the businesses we're talking about the economic engine of our state and we can't move
1273520	1279600	forward without them well you know what the businesses are going to tank because of the
1279600	1285520	social justice bullshit it doesn't sell we know it doesn't sell in fact i was saving this for
1285520	1289920	for a future video but it's relevant right now so i'll bring it up right now here's here's some bonus
1289920	1295840	stuff for you okay this is from a study called jumping to conclusions advocacy and application
1295840	1301120	of psychological research in the politics of social psychology from 2017 the psychologist
1301120	1305600	advancing implicit bias as the explanation for various societal inequalities and harms
1305600	1309760	jumped to the conclusion apparently in the sincere belief that the data would eventually support that
1309760	1316400	conclusion but it has not the accumulated data in fact now shows that measures of implicit bias
1316400	1322480	provide no more explanatory power than explicit bias even for socially sensitive topics and often
1322480	1327680	provide less explanatory power there is no reliable link between implicit bias and police
1327680	1332560	officers and police violence against minorities and there is no reliable link between implicit
1332560	1338800	bias and employment evaluations or employment outcomes for women and minorities if those behind
1338800	1344560	applications of implicit bias to the law really are committed to behavioral realism to taking
1344560	1349520	science seriously and making values secondary to science as they say then they must accept
1349520	1353920	that implicit bias has not turned out to be the explanatory juggernaut it was
1353920	1360880	optimistically expected to be despite these now undisputed facts the implicit bias construct
1360880	1366320	continues to play an influential role in public debates court cases in the making of governmental
1366320	1372400	and company policy millions of dollars are being spent on untested implicit bias training and
1372400	1378320	consulting disposing of the mistaken belief that implicit bias is a powerful and pervasive corruptor
1378320	1385520	of behavior will be slow and difficult now david arback who is an intellectual that i do follow
1385520	1391600	and read uh semi-regularly he summed this up implicit bias training in such measures were
1391600	1396400	initially promoted and adopted with the rhetoric of profit diversity is good for business now
1396400	1401520	they're being seen as financial losers and will be dropped by the same criteria and he's replying to
1401520	1407040	the tweet that says psychologists admit that by pushing implicit bias they have foisted a big
1407040	1412880	cash destruction machine on society that won't go away easily whether or not implicit bias is real
1412880	1418800	bias sure is justifying diversity programs on the grounds of profit margins was highly likely to
1418800	1425360	backfire but it's created a good deal of leftist corporate sympathy along the way so what does this
1425360	1432240	all mean uh this means that implicit bias isn't real it's it's most likely not real the idea that
1432240	1440480	you have some kind of subconscious or subliminal racist or sexist slants even when you try to not
1440480	1447280	be that person it's it's complete bs and the implicit bias training like the starbucks stuff
1447280	1454240	and other stuff that we've seen it's all useless and it's basically a giant cash hole and these
1454240	1460880	businesses thinking that diversity is the way forward have been duped into shoveling millions
1460880	1466560	and billions of dollars into these giant cash sinks that are basically just going straight to
1466560	1471040	sjws they're going to like the gender studies people they're going to the implicit bias people
1471040	1476240	they're going to the to the social justice warriors that that write this junk and promote this junk
1476240	1481440	and teach this junk and it's going to be a complete fucking nightmare it's already a complete
1481440	1485840	fucking nightmare but it's going to get worse because as companies realize that this does
1485840	1492160	nothing and this earns them nothing they're going to basically figure out they've been taken for a
1492160	1496480	ride you know they've had they have all these diversity hires that are doing nothing in their
1496480	1502240	companies and in the next decade when they wake up to that fact there's going to be a mass purge
1502240	1505680	from these companies and that's what's going on here in this article the new hampshire white
1505680	1510160	diversity article it's not just the social justice groups that are doing this it's the businesses
1510160	1515040	and they're doing it to their own folly this is going to destroy these businesses and of course
1515040	1521200	it's coming from the new york times um and we all know what the new york times has done recently
1521200	1527120	they've they've recently hired a very interesting young woman and i may do something on her this
1527120	1531760	week but until then i'll see you guys later i love you
