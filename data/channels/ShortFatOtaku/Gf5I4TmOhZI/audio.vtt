00:00.000 --> 00:06.640
good morning my friends welcome to sj weekly what is this the sixth the seventh i forgot it

00:06.640 --> 00:12.720
um but it's for august 5th 2018 and uh listen to this

00:18.880 --> 00:24.960
that is the sound of a delicious morning coffee and yeah yeah i'm kind of a coffee

00:24.960 --> 00:32.080
fag i i definitely like to uh indulge in a in a morning coffee it's one of the few

00:32.080 --> 00:38.960
pleasures left in life it seems um but let's start with on the washington post and i'm actually

00:38.960 --> 00:45.360
doing this incognito mode because they don't like ad blocker which i did finally get and they don't

00:45.360 --> 00:49.520
like the fact that i've looked at too many articles on their site this month even though

00:49.520 --> 00:56.720
it's only been five fucking days so is your spin class too young too thin and too white

00:56.720 --> 01:03.600
the epitome of first world problems as boutique exercise studios expanded a rapid clip some are

01:03.600 --> 01:08.800
questioning who's welcome after a few committed months of hot yoga at a studio in new york

01:08.800 --> 01:13.360
christina rice had found her niche so when the studio announced that it was offering teacher

01:13.360 --> 01:18.240
training she signed right up it was only when she arrived with her mat that she noticed something

01:18.240 --> 01:24.000
striking there were 54 other women and men in the 10-week course and not one of them looked

01:24.000 --> 01:29.920
like her she was the lone african-american in the class i did bond with some of the other students

01:29.920 --> 01:36.240
says rice but i did feel very isolated at times there were no teachers of color i didn't have

01:36.240 --> 01:41.200
another woman who looked like me who understood my struggles my insecurities it's it's just

01:41.200 --> 01:50.640
fucking yoga dude do you really need to to be performing yoga of color this really sounds like

01:50.640 --> 01:57.920
an entitled frankly rich black woman complaining that there aren't more entitled rich black women

01:57.920 --> 02:05.040
for her to hang out with if you went to like any of the united states's poor black population

02:05.040 --> 02:10.720
they would laugh this woman out of the hood boutique workout studios specialized exercise

02:10.800 --> 02:16.560
specific gyms are exploding in gentrifying urban areas well maybe that's why you don't see many

02:16.560 --> 02:22.240
black people there they include not only hot yoga but also crossfit which is everywhere berry's

02:22.240 --> 02:28.960
boot camp soul cycle or orange theory they are the modern answer to the sprawling soulless gym

02:28.960 --> 02:34.000
which insists on financial commitment but doesn't really care whether you actually work out in the

02:34.000 --> 02:38.960
boutique world you make reservations you're greeted with smiles you're served an ice-cold

02:38.960 --> 02:45.040
glass of the spin class is self-care kool-aid this really sounds like somebody who who just

02:45.040 --> 02:51.920
couldn't make it at a regular gym gyms can be sprawling and they can be soulless but they

02:51.920 --> 02:58.880
require you to be the engine not some kind of external force the point of a gym is that you go

02:58.880 --> 03:05.200
and work out and you have to push yourself to work out and if you're incapable of pushing yourself to

03:05.200 --> 03:11.200
lift those weights and you need something like say a boutique workout studio where you have

03:11.200 --> 03:15.200
somebody leading you in the exercise you know of course if you want to pay your money and go do

03:15.200 --> 03:20.560
that it's it's you're right right but this really sounds like it's looking down its nose at gyms and

03:20.560 --> 03:25.120
by extension the people that can actually self-motivate and here's where we can see that

03:25.120 --> 03:30.640
having a leader in your exercise is actually a privilege but some people have begun to question

03:30.640 --> 03:37.280
the stark differences between the studios and the neighborhood ymca like the prices in washington

03:37.280 --> 03:45.200
a single 50-minute barry's boot camp class is 34 spinning studio flywheel charges 30 solid core can

03:45.200 --> 03:50.640
run as much as 37 or about half the cost of a monthly membership in most urban gyms that's

03:50.640 --> 03:56.480
because these places come with trainers built into them if you go to a gym with a trainer it's going

03:56.480 --> 04:01.120
to be a lot more expensive than if you just go to a gym and follow a workout that you found on fit

04:01.120 --> 04:07.280
or something and like rice other fitness junkies have begun to notice who isn't coming sweat

04:07.280 --> 04:12.880
through a class in one of these studios and it's very possible that you'll see it many many lith

04:12.880 --> 04:20.480
young white bodies and few people of color or older or heavier exercisers maybe it's because

04:20.480 --> 04:25.680
as you said this is happening in young white gentrifying areas maybe it's because a privilege

04:25.680 --> 04:34.800
that only rich white kids can afford maybe maybe it's because older people generally don't want to

04:34.800 --> 04:40.800
take care of themselves or at least not in this manner usually old people don't work out or if

04:40.800 --> 04:47.040
they do work out they go to gyms but long who is african-american and hispanic is struck by what

04:47.040 --> 04:53.440
she sees there what is their messaging saying about aging what is fit what is beauty i look at

04:53.440 --> 04:58.240
everything from the signage to the marketing materials and all she sees are millennials how

04:58.240 --> 05:05.120
open and inclusive is that well i mean what do you want to do do you want to force old black people

05:05.120 --> 05:11.120
at gunpoint to come to these these gyms stanley who has gained some fame with her criticisms of

05:11.120 --> 05:16.480
boutique workout and yoga culture's lack of diversity describes the studio she has visited

05:16.480 --> 05:22.000
outside the big city bubble as anything but diverse she tackles the subject in her book

05:22.000 --> 05:28.640
everybody yoga the issue she says extends beyond race i definitely want to find a copy of this book

05:28.640 --> 05:34.560
now oh there's actually an amazon link well i'm not gonna pay for it um she's often the only fat

05:34.560 --> 05:38.640
woman in the room as well she says and if you're looking for a mature crowd you have to keep looking

05:38.640 --> 05:43.600
too by the health club association's reckoning the average age of studio exercisers is 30

05:44.320 --> 05:49.760
the messaging says stanley is essentially you're allowed in the space if you're white slender able

05:49.760 --> 05:55.600
body and less than 45 cisgender and heterosexual and if you're not then you're not welcome except

05:56.960 --> 06:02.240
stanley you look like somebody who is none of those things and obviously you're attending

06:02.240 --> 06:08.480
these studios maybe it's not that people aren't allowed in these studios maybe it's that they

06:08.480 --> 06:16.160
don't want to go maybe it's that people have the freedom of choice to choose whether they want to

06:16.160 --> 06:22.640
go to an exercise studio or a gym or to just work out at home or to not work out at all maybe it's

06:22.640 --> 06:28.640
not a race and gender issue and maybe you don't need to make everything a race and gender issue

06:28.640 --> 06:33.520
okay this is stupid i'm moving on to the next article uh i skimmed the rest of this off camera

06:33.520 --> 06:38.160
and it's all literally just the same bullshit blaming white people because black people don't

06:38.160 --> 06:43.200
want to attend these ridiculous fucking studios okay i'm done well maybe if those minorities had

06:43.200 --> 06:47.520
more money in their pockets they would attend those studios but it turns out that might not be

06:47.520 --> 06:54.160
the case finland's basic income test wasn't ambitious enough the payments encourage

06:54.160 --> 07:01.200
beneficiaries to take work that doesn't pay a living wage kela the finnish social security agency

07:01.200 --> 07:05.280
has failed to secure the funding it needs to extend its universal basic income experiment

07:05.280 --> 07:11.680
beyond this year although it's sad that this grand leftist idea is suffering yet another setback

07:11.680 --> 07:16.800
finland's trial effort deserved its fate before the experiment was approved by the government in

07:16.800 --> 07:25.520
2016 kela officials talked about paying 800 euros or 974 a month in unconditional income to test a

07:25.520 --> 07:31.200
group of working age citizens but by the time the program began early last year the amount was

07:31.200 --> 07:37.280
whittled down to 560 euros if extended to the whole country the cost of the earlier proposal

07:37.280 --> 07:42.320
would have exceeded the finnish government's entire revenue a similarly impractical approach

07:42.320 --> 07:49.680
led to the failure of a 2016 swiss referendum on offering a payout of 2500 swiss francs it's almost

07:49.680 --> 07:55.760
like if you keep giving away people's money for nothing you will run out of money it's all but

07:55.760 --> 08:01.360
impossible to live on 560 euros in finland a one-bedroom apartment on the outskirts of helinski

08:01.360 --> 08:06.320
rents for almost that much so the experiment's designer settled on not really paying the ubi to

08:06.320 --> 08:11.520
the unemployed who kept a higher level of government support at least 32.4 euros a day

08:11.520 --> 08:17.040
for the first 400 days after losing a job only the working poor would benefit significantly from it

08:17.040 --> 08:24.640
i'm sure that you and i know that the reason this failed is because you can't just throw money at

08:24.640 --> 08:30.240
problems and hope they go away there is definitely a problem with with grinding poverty there's

08:30.240 --> 08:36.080
definitely a problem with people not being able to get an education or start a business or do what

08:36.080 --> 08:41.440
they want to do with their lives but you can't just mindlessly throw gobs of cash and expect

08:41.440 --> 08:46.160
the problem to fix itself but i have a feeling that this article i haven't i haven't read the

08:46.160 --> 08:50.800
whole thing yet but i have a feeling that the slant is going to take is that they didn't give

08:50.800 --> 08:56.480
enough money not that the idea of the ubi is inherently flawed finland has a low employment

08:56.480 --> 09:01.440
rate for a rich country just 71% of the working age population compared to 77% in neighboring

09:01.440 --> 09:05.600
sweden and almost 86 percent in iceland so the idea was to provide an incentive for the

09:05.600 --> 09:10.640
unemployed to step into the job market even if it meant taking on part-time or badly paid work

09:11.280 --> 09:16.160
the other goal was to simplify finland's complex system of housing child care and other benefits

09:16.160 --> 09:21.840
by replacing them with the lump sum payment i don't know if giving people money for nothing

09:21.840 --> 09:29.040
is going to incentivize them to take on part-time or badly paid work you know the the point of

09:29.120 --> 09:36.160
something like a ubi is to one rescue people in grinding poverty who just cannot who have

09:36.160 --> 09:42.320
nothing zero just can't get ahead because they have no base with which to start and two it's

09:42.320 --> 09:49.280
to assist people in you know if they're if they're working something like part-time work or badly paid

09:49.280 --> 09:55.440
work it's to assist them into having a buffer so that they can maybe invest in themselves or go

09:55.440 --> 10:01.200
back to school or on the side start their business it's to help ambitious people however this article

10:01.200 --> 10:06.800
and in general ubi supporters seem to assume that all people are ambitious people which is just not

10:06.800 --> 10:12.480
the case the ubi is not going to get people into part-time or badly paid work it's designed to get

10:12.480 --> 10:18.320
ambitious people without resources out of that work keela is not promising to release any results

10:18.320 --> 10:24.160
of the experiment nobody's surprise there which involves 2 000 people until the end of 2019 or

10:24.160 --> 10:29.760
even the beginning of 2020 but it was clear from the start that a basic income even such a low one

10:29.760 --> 10:35.680
is an extremely expensive way to boost precarious forms of employment at 550 euros a month keela

10:35.680 --> 10:43.360
calculated the ubi would cost 19.3 billion euros a year while the government would only save 3.6

10:43.360 --> 10:48.080
billion euros on existing benefits as for getting people to return to the job market the center-right

10:48.080 --> 10:55.200
cabinet of prime minister uh juha i don't know how to pronounce that juha sapila appears to be

10:55.200 --> 10:59.680
more interested in cost-effective negative motivation for the unemployed than in rewarding

10:59.680 --> 11:04.480
them for finding work that doesn't pay a living wage the government has proposed for example

11:04.480 --> 11:10.080
requiring out-of-work people to apply for at least one job a week to keep receiving benefits unless

11:10.080 --> 11:15.920
they're in job training programs i never i never really thought i'd see the day that i'd be agreeing

11:15.920 --> 11:20.800
with right-leaning politicians or parliaments but that's really how things have been going the past

11:20.800 --> 11:26.320
few years the ubi idea is not dead it's still worth watching other experiments especially the

11:26.320 --> 11:31.280
ones that actually provide a living income these include oakland california which pays two thousand

11:31.280 --> 11:37.840
dollars a month almost exactly the poverty line and the one in kenya which plays 23 a month about

11:37.840 --> 11:43.680
half the average income in the country's rural areas other tests in dutch city of utrecht and

11:43.680 --> 11:48.320
an upcoming one in ontario canada i'll i'll correct you right now that one has actually

11:48.320 --> 11:53.520
ended and has not went well um offer low payouts relative to the living standard but still higher

11:53.520 --> 11:58.480
than in the finished test i don't know the ubi is an answer to the right question but it's the

11:58.480 --> 12:03.040
wrong answer at the very least though they are asking the right questions it's it's not quite

12:03.040 --> 12:07.600
as bad as communists who just don't understand economics proponents of the ubi understand that

12:07.600 --> 12:14.720
at least people need to work and they're saying well how about we just give them some money

12:14.720 --> 12:19.760
and allow them to work on what they want well that's it's it's better than assuming that all

12:19.760 --> 12:24.400
people are the same which is what communism does but it's still it's still not gonna work because

12:24.400 --> 12:30.160
there will be too many people who will just take the money and not work in my opinion um loans or

12:30.160 --> 12:37.040
grants for for school or loans or grants for starting small businesses um that's the way

12:37.040 --> 12:42.880
that we should be going because that will actually provide people who are ambitious but poor

12:43.600 --> 12:50.240
with the resources that they need to actually get their lives going not something like a ubi i still

12:50.240 --> 12:54.240
can't quite tell which way this article is leaning which i guess is actually a good thing at least

12:54.240 --> 12:58.480
it's it's somewhat neutral but uh here's an article that is just straight up parody and i

12:58.480 --> 13:04.400
actually had to read the first couple sentences before i could figure it out um fact all tragedy

13:04.480 --> 13:10.240
happens because of toxic masculinity and lack of communism this is uh during the time that

13:10.240 --> 13:14.800
the mandalay bay shootings happened last year the think peace factory is an overdrive over the

13:14.800 --> 13:18.800
las vegas massacre just about every thought piece you're going to read about las vegas will have one

13:18.800 --> 13:23.200
of two themes about motive the tragedy happened because toxic masculinity which is the feminist

13:23.200 --> 13:27.920
cop-out for everything or the tragedy happened because the lack of full communism in the presence

13:27.920 --> 13:32.960
of white people which is the sociology pre-grad cop-out for everything i'm sure toxic masculinity

13:32.960 --> 13:38.480
is what caused a sextagarian to commit mass murder it's also the reason why my crank case

13:38.480 --> 13:43.360
is habitually low on oil why septa is late and why my hoagie has too few jalapenos in it

13:44.000 --> 13:49.200
the other craptastic category of hot takes is a shitty reduction of economic theory when there are

13:49.200 --> 13:53.360
any study sources they point to fringe theory that's not generally accepted or it's way out

13:53.360 --> 13:58.480
of context or it's just bad quoting and use of stats and this article is basically about

13:59.120 --> 14:06.480
uh shitty clickbait and it actually shows a real a real headline here can a shift in the perception

14:06.480 --> 14:13.760
of masculinity curb mass violence so yeah people actually made made shit like this back when the

14:13.760 --> 14:19.120
the mandalay bay shootings were happening people actually did blame it on toxic masculinity and we

14:19.120 --> 14:24.800
have reached a point where satire of something like this article is nearly indistinguishable

14:25.760 --> 14:31.520
and speaking of satire here's an article that frankly could be read as satire but it's not

14:31.520 --> 14:37.120
women work longer as the men cut their hours now this is not how this originally read they have

14:37.120 --> 14:44.160
changed the title and it used to read this woman work longer hours than men that's all it said

14:44.160 --> 14:50.480
before and they realized that they had kind of fucked up and here's why a nationwide survey of

14:50.480 --> 14:56.640
1600 employees found that women now work almost 34 hours a week on average half a day longer than

14:56.640 --> 15:03.120
the figure of 30.4 hours five years ago over the same five-year period men's average work hours

15:03.120 --> 15:09.760
fell from 45.5 hours per week to 44.8 hours although among the hardest working males the

15:09.760 --> 15:16.720
number putting in more than 49 hours a week has passed the 3 million mark so even as the headline

15:16.720 --> 15:23.120
says women work longer hours than men immediately in the first few paragraphs they contradict that

15:23.120 --> 15:29.600
women now work almost 34 hours a week men's average work hours fell to 44.8 hours there is

15:29.600 --> 15:35.600
no way the headline is in any way reflective of reality which is why the url of the article still

15:35.600 --> 15:40.400
says women work longer hours than men and they changed the headline because they were immediately

15:40.400 --> 15:45.440
found out as the hacks that the daily mail actually are and really if you want an explanation of the

15:45.440 --> 15:53.040
gender pay gap it's right here all right women work 34 hours a week on average men work 44.8

15:53.040 --> 15:58.560
hours a week on average that's a pretty decent explanation don't you think men are working 10

15:58.560 --> 16:04.560
more hours per week on average maybe they're making 10 more hours per week worth of money

16:04.560 --> 16:09.040
on average or here's another reason almost three quarters of those working long hours

16:09.680 --> 16:14.800
that would be mostly men admitted that they were likely to go to work even if they were ill

16:14.800 --> 16:19.280
while two-thirds had gone to the office on public holidays in the past year and a half

16:19.280 --> 16:24.560
and said they would put work ahead of personal commitment well there you go maybe that's the

16:24.560 --> 16:28.000
gender pay gap there's a lot of things that could be the gender pay gap how about this

16:28.000 --> 16:33.440
women are also more likely to be found in relatively poorly paid caring professions than men

16:33.440 --> 16:39.760
pushing down their overall average wages well it's not that women are to be found in these professions

16:39.760 --> 16:45.120
women choose to be in these professions they take these jobs they go to these schools they

16:45.120 --> 16:52.160
choose these careers for themselves but let's keep talking statistics with new hampshire 94 white

16:52.160 --> 17:01.120
asks how do you diversify a whole state this is a ridiculous proposition for multiple reasons

17:01.120 --> 17:09.440
one locations as in wide huge areas of land do not need to be diversified you do not need to push

17:09.680 --> 17:15.600
out people who are currently living there you do not need to to force some kind of intermingling

17:15.600 --> 17:21.520
or race mixing you just let people do what they want to do let them live where they want to live

17:21.520 --> 17:27.280
in fact as i recall pushing out an entire group of people and replacing them with another group

17:27.280 --> 17:33.760
of people even if you don't kill them is still considered to be ethnic cleansing under

17:33.760 --> 17:40.000
international law so why would you want to diversify new hampshire why don't you just

17:40.560 --> 17:48.640
keep it the way it is why don't you allow people to move as they see fit catalina selentano used

17:48.640 --> 17:54.480
to hold trading sessions for hospital workers in lynn massachusetts to familiarize them with

17:54.480 --> 17:58.880
the cultures of patients from cambodia russia and the dominican republic when she moved to

17:58.880 --> 18:05.840
new hampshire she suddenly found herself in an ethnic vacuum well if being in an ethnic vacuum

18:05.840 --> 18:12.880
was that distressing to you why did you move to new hampshire if you wanted to live in the culture

18:12.880 --> 18:19.520
that you were born in and raised in why didn't you stay in the location and with the people from that

18:19.520 --> 18:25.120
culture i went from being able to speak spanish every day to not speaking spanish at all because

18:25.120 --> 18:30.080
there wasn't anybody to speak spanish to you don't get to move to a place and demand everyone

18:30.080 --> 18:35.440
change to suit your needs new hampshire like its neighbors vermont and maine is nearly all white

18:35.440 --> 18:40.320
this has posed an array of problems for new arrivals who often find themselves isolated

18:40.320 --> 18:45.360
and alone without the comfort and support of a built-in community well that's why it's called

18:45.360 --> 18:52.000
a built-in community somebody had to build it and if you're not up to the task of building a

18:52.000 --> 18:59.440
community if you want the government to diversify new hampshire then you need to leave it's that

18:59.440 --> 19:04.720
simple it has also posed problems for employers in these states who find that their homogeneity

19:04.720 --> 19:09.280
can be a barrier to recruiting and retaining workers of different ethnicities and cultural

19:09.280 --> 19:14.560
backgrounds again that's only a problem if you care about ticking off these these ridiculous

19:14.560 --> 19:21.360
boxes on a list if you just hire the best people for the job and don't give a shit about race none

19:21.360 --> 19:25.600
of this matters the issue prompted about a hundred business leaders government officials

19:25.600 --> 19:30.400
and members of non-profit organizations to meet thursday to search for ways that new hampshire

19:30.400 --> 19:36.080
which is 94 white might lure other racial and ethnic groups as well as younger people

19:36.080 --> 19:41.360
maybe they don't explicitly need to do that maybe they just maybe they should just lure people you

19:41.360 --> 19:47.600
know qualified people for the jobs that they have and then see who shows up and if it turns out that

19:47.600 --> 19:52.560
a bunch more white people show up it shouldn't matter diversity quotas are going to be the

19:52.560 --> 19:57.520
downfall of all of these initiatives with non-whites poised to make up a majority of

19:57.520 --> 20:02.480
the american population in the next three decades diversity has become a bottom line imperative for

20:02.480 --> 20:07.120
companies competing for talent especially for workers who can speak other languages man the

20:07.120 --> 20:13.600
way that the term non-whites is used there it's almost the way that the kkk used it like 50 years

20:13.600 --> 20:19.440
ago as it stands new hampshire is three percent latino two percent african-american and three

20:19.440 --> 20:27.120
percent asian the nation as a whole is 17 latino 14 African-American and six percent asian well

20:27.120 --> 20:32.560
that means that states that aren't new hampshire some other states they have a ratio of latinos

20:32.560 --> 20:39.280
that is higher than 17 a ratio of african-americans that is higher than 14 and a ratio of asians that

20:39.280 --> 20:45.280
is higher than six percent and nobody nobody is calling for more white people to be imported to

20:45.280 --> 20:53.360
those states there's no massive call to diversify the latino and black south right now nobody cares

20:53.360 --> 20:58.400
about that shit nobody cares about bringing white people into those states but when when white

20:58.400 --> 21:03.840
people hold a 94 majority you got to start bringing people in it's it's a ridiculous idea

21:03.840 --> 21:08.880
it doesn't matter the race doesn't matter it's not just the social justice groups that are doing this

21:09.040 --> 21:13.520
it's the businesses we're talking about the economic engine of our state and we can't move

21:13.520 --> 21:19.600
forward without them well you know what the businesses are going to tank because of the

21:19.600 --> 21:25.520
social justice bullshit it doesn't sell we know it doesn't sell in fact i was saving this for

21:25.520 --> 21:29.920
for a future video but it's relevant right now so i'll bring it up right now here's here's some bonus

21:29.920 --> 21:35.840
stuff for you okay this is from a study called jumping to conclusions advocacy and application

21:35.840 --> 21:41.120
of psychological research in the politics of social psychology from 2017 the psychologist

21:41.120 --> 21:45.600
advancing implicit bias as the explanation for various societal inequalities and harms

21:45.600 --> 21:49.760
jumped to the conclusion apparently in the sincere belief that the data would eventually support that

21:49.760 --> 21:56.400
conclusion but it has not the accumulated data in fact now shows that measures of implicit bias

21:56.400 --> 22:02.480
provide no more explanatory power than explicit bias even for socially sensitive topics and often

22:02.480 --> 22:07.680
provide less explanatory power there is no reliable link between implicit bias and police

22:07.680 --> 22:12.560
officers and police violence against minorities and there is no reliable link between implicit

22:12.560 --> 22:18.800
bias and employment evaluations or employment outcomes for women and minorities if those behind

22:18.800 --> 22:24.560
applications of implicit bias to the law really are committed to behavioral realism to taking

22:24.560 --> 22:29.520
science seriously and making values secondary to science as they say then they must accept

22:29.520 --> 22:33.920
that implicit bias has not turned out to be the explanatory juggernaut it was

22:33.920 --> 22:40.880
optimistically expected to be despite these now undisputed facts the implicit bias construct

22:40.880 --> 22:46.320
continues to play an influential role in public debates court cases in the making of governmental

22:46.320 --> 22:52.400
and company policy millions of dollars are being spent on untested implicit bias training and

22:52.400 --> 22:58.320
consulting disposing of the mistaken belief that implicit bias is a powerful and pervasive corruptor

22:58.320 --> 23:05.520
of behavior will be slow and difficult now david arback who is an intellectual that i do follow

23:05.520 --> 23:11.600
and read uh semi-regularly he summed this up implicit bias training in such measures were

23:11.600 --> 23:16.400
initially promoted and adopted with the rhetoric of profit diversity is good for business now

23:16.400 --> 23:21.520
they're being seen as financial losers and will be dropped by the same criteria and he's replying to

23:21.520 --> 23:27.040
the tweet that says psychologists admit that by pushing implicit bias they have foisted a big

23:27.040 --> 23:32.880
cash destruction machine on society that won't go away easily whether or not implicit bias is real

23:32.880 --> 23:38.800
bias sure is justifying diversity programs on the grounds of profit margins was highly likely to

23:38.800 --> 23:45.360
backfire but it's created a good deal of leftist corporate sympathy along the way so what does this

23:45.360 --> 23:52.240
all mean uh this means that implicit bias isn't real it's it's most likely not real the idea that

23:52.240 --> 24:00.480
you have some kind of subconscious or subliminal racist or sexist slants even when you try to not

24:00.480 --> 24:07.280
be that person it's it's complete bs and the implicit bias training like the starbucks stuff

24:07.280 --> 24:14.240
and other stuff that we've seen it's all useless and it's basically a giant cash hole and these

24:14.240 --> 24:20.880
businesses thinking that diversity is the way forward have been duped into shoveling millions

24:20.880 --> 24:26.560
and billions of dollars into these giant cash sinks that are basically just going straight to

24:26.560 --> 24:31.040
sjws they're going to like the gender studies people they're going to the implicit bias people

24:31.040 --> 24:36.240
they're going to the to the social justice warriors that that write this junk and promote this junk

24:36.240 --> 24:41.440
and teach this junk and it's going to be a complete fucking nightmare it's already a complete

24:41.440 --> 24:45.840
fucking nightmare but it's going to get worse because as companies realize that this does

24:45.840 --> 24:52.160
nothing and this earns them nothing they're going to basically figure out they've been taken for a

24:52.160 --> 24:56.480
ride you know they've had they have all these diversity hires that are doing nothing in their

24:56.480 --> 25:02.240
companies and in the next decade when they wake up to that fact there's going to be a mass purge

25:02.240 --> 25:05.680
from these companies and that's what's going on here in this article the new hampshire white

25:05.680 --> 25:10.160
diversity article it's not just the social justice groups that are doing this it's the businesses

25:10.160 --> 25:15.040
and they're doing it to their own folly this is going to destroy these businesses and of course

25:15.040 --> 25:21.200
it's coming from the new york times um and we all know what the new york times has done recently

25:21.200 --> 25:27.120
they've they've recently hired a very interesting young woman and i may do something on her this

25:27.120 --> 25:31.760
week but until then i'll see you guys later i love you
