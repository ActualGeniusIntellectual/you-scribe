{"text": " good morning my friends welcome to sj weekly what is this the sixth the seventh i forgot it um but it's for august 5th 2018 and uh listen to this that is the sound of a delicious morning coffee and yeah yeah i'm kind of a coffee fag i i definitely like to uh indulge in a in a morning coffee it's one of the few pleasures left in life it seems um but let's start with on the washington post and i'm actually doing this incognito mode because they don't like ad blocker which i did finally get and they don't like the fact that i've looked at too many articles on their site this month even though it's only been five fucking days so is your spin class too young too thin and too white the epitome of first world problems as boutique exercise studios expanded a rapid clip some are questioning who's welcome after a few committed months of hot yoga at a studio in new york christina rice had found her niche so when the studio announced that it was offering teacher training she signed right up it was only when she arrived with her mat that she noticed something striking there were 54 other women and men in the 10-week course and not one of them looked like her she was the lone african-american in the class i did bond with some of the other students says rice but i did feel very isolated at times there were no teachers of color i didn't have another woman who looked like me who understood my struggles my insecurities it's it's just fucking yoga dude do you really need to to be performing yoga of color this really sounds like an entitled frankly rich black woman complaining that there aren't more entitled rich black women for her to hang out with if you went to like any of the united states's poor black population they would laugh this woman out of the hood boutique workout studios specialized exercise specific gyms are exploding in gentrifying urban areas well maybe that's why you don't see many black people there they include not only hot yoga but also crossfit which is everywhere berry's boot camp soul cycle or orange theory they are the modern answer to the sprawling soulless gym which insists on financial commitment but doesn't really care whether you actually work out in the boutique world you make reservations you're greeted with smiles you're served an ice-cold glass of the spin class is self-care kool-aid this really sounds like somebody who who just couldn't make it at a regular gym gyms can be sprawling and they can be soulless but they require you to be the engine not some kind of external force the point of a gym is that you go and work out and you have to push yourself to work out and if you're incapable of pushing yourself to lift those weights and you need something like say a boutique workout studio where you have somebody leading you in the exercise you know of course if you want to pay your money and go do that it's it's you're right right but this really sounds like it's looking down its nose at gyms and by extension the people that can actually self-motivate and here's where we can see that having a leader in your exercise is actually a privilege but some people have begun to question the stark differences between the studios and the neighborhood ymca like the prices in washington a single 50-minute barry's boot camp class is 34 spinning studio flywheel charges 30 solid core can run as much as 37 or about half the cost of a monthly membership in most urban gyms that's because these places come with trainers built into them if you go to a gym with a trainer it's going to be a lot more expensive than if you just go to a gym and follow a workout that you found on fit or something and like rice other fitness junkies have begun to notice who isn't coming sweat through a class in one of these studios and it's very possible that you'll see it many many lith young white bodies and few people of color or older or heavier exercisers maybe it's because as you said this is happening in young white gentrifying areas maybe it's because a privilege that only rich white kids can afford maybe maybe it's because older people generally don't want to take care of themselves or at least not in this manner usually old people don't work out or if they do work out they go to gyms but long who is african-american and hispanic is struck by what she sees there what is their messaging saying about aging what is fit what is beauty i look at everything from the signage to the marketing materials and all she sees are millennials how open and inclusive is that well i mean what do you want to do do you want to force old black people at gunpoint to come to these these gyms stanley who has gained some fame with her criticisms of boutique workout and yoga culture's lack of diversity describes the studio she has visited outside the big city bubble as anything but diverse she tackles the subject in her book everybody yoga the issue she says extends beyond race i definitely want to find a copy of this book now oh there's actually an amazon link well i'm not gonna pay for it um she's often the only fat woman in the room as well she says and if you're looking for a mature crowd you have to keep looking too by the health club association's reckoning the average age of studio exercisers is 30 the messaging says stanley is essentially you're allowed in the space if you're white slender able body and less than 45 cisgender and heterosexual and if you're not then you're not welcome except stanley you look like somebody who is none of those things and obviously you're attending these studios maybe it's not that people aren't allowed in these studios maybe it's that they don't want to go maybe it's that people have the freedom of choice to choose whether they want to go to an exercise studio or a gym or to just work out at home or to not work out at all maybe it's not a race and gender issue and maybe you don't need to make everything a race and gender issue okay this is stupid i'm moving on to the next article uh i skimmed the rest of this off camera and it's all literally just the same bullshit blaming white people because black people don't want to attend these ridiculous fucking studios okay i'm done well maybe if those minorities had more money in their pockets they would attend those studios but it turns out that might not be the case finland's basic income test wasn't ambitious enough the payments encourage beneficiaries to take work that doesn't pay a living wage kela the finnish social security agency has failed to secure the funding it needs to extend its universal basic income experiment beyond this year although it's sad that this grand leftist idea is suffering yet another setback finland's trial effort deserved its fate before the experiment was approved by the government in 2016 kela officials talked about paying 800 euros or 974 a month in unconditional income to test a group of working age citizens but by the time the program began early last year the amount was whittled down to 560 euros if extended to the whole country the cost of the earlier proposal would have exceeded the finnish government's entire revenue a similarly impractical approach led to the failure of a 2016 swiss referendum on offering a payout of 2500 swiss francs it's almost like if you keep giving away people's money for nothing you will run out of money it's all but impossible to live on 560 euros in finland a one-bedroom apartment on the outskirts of helinski rents for almost that much so the experiment's designer settled on not really paying the ubi to the unemployed who kept a higher level of government support at least 32.4 euros a day for the first 400 days after losing a job only the working poor would benefit significantly from it i'm sure that you and i know that the reason this failed is because you can't just throw money at problems and hope they go away there is definitely a problem with with grinding poverty there's definitely a problem with people not being able to get an education or start a business or do what they want to do with their lives but you can't just mindlessly throw gobs of cash and expect the problem to fix itself but i have a feeling that this article i haven't i haven't read the whole thing yet but i have a feeling that the slant is going to take is that they didn't give enough money not that the idea of the ubi is inherently flawed finland has a low employment rate for a rich country just 71% of the working age population compared to 77% in neighboring sweden and almost 86 percent in iceland so the idea was to provide an incentive for the unemployed to step into the job market even if it meant taking on part-time or badly paid work the other goal was to simplify finland's complex system of housing child care and other benefits by replacing them with the lump sum payment i don't know if giving people money for nothing is going to incentivize them to take on part-time or badly paid work you know the the point of something like a ubi is to one rescue people in grinding poverty who just cannot who have nothing zero just can't get ahead because they have no base with which to start and two it's to assist people in you know if they're if they're working something like part-time work or badly paid work it's to assist them into having a buffer so that they can maybe invest in themselves or go back to school or on the side start their business it's to help ambitious people however this article and in general ubi supporters seem to assume that all people are ambitious people which is just not the case the ubi is not going to get people into part-time or badly paid work it's designed to get ambitious people without resources out of that work keela is not promising to release any results of the experiment nobody's surprise there which involves 2 000 people until the end of 2019 or even the beginning of 2020 but it was clear from the start that a basic income even such a low one is an extremely expensive way to boost precarious forms of employment at 550 euros a month keela calculated the ubi would cost 19.3 billion euros a year while the government would only save 3.6 billion euros on existing benefits as for getting people to return to the job market the center-right cabinet of prime minister uh juha i don't know how to pronounce that juha sapila appears to be more interested in cost-effective negative motivation for the unemployed than in rewarding them for finding work that doesn't pay a living wage the government has proposed for example requiring out-of-work people to apply for at least one job a week to keep receiving benefits unless they're in job training programs i never i never really thought i'd see the day that i'd be agreeing with right-leaning politicians or parliaments but that's really how things have been going the past few years the ubi idea is not dead it's still worth watching other experiments especially the ones that actually provide a living income these include oakland california which pays two thousand dollars a month almost exactly the poverty line and the one in kenya which plays 23 a month about half the average income in the country's rural areas other tests in dutch city of utrecht and an upcoming one in ontario canada i'll i'll correct you right now that one has actually ended and has not went well um offer low payouts relative to the living standard but still higher than in the finished test i don't know the ubi is an answer to the right question but it's the wrong answer at the very least though they are asking the right questions it's it's not quite as bad as communists who just don't understand economics proponents of the ubi understand that at least people need to work and they're saying well how about we just give them some money and allow them to work on what they want well that's it's it's better than assuming that all people are the same which is what communism does but it's still it's still not gonna work because there will be too many people who will just take the money and not work in my opinion um loans or grants for for school or loans or grants for starting small businesses um that's the way that we should be going because that will actually provide people who are ambitious but poor with the resources that they need to actually get their lives going not something like a ubi i still can't quite tell which way this article is leaning which i guess is actually a good thing at least it's it's somewhat neutral but uh here's an article that is just straight up parody and i actually had to read the first couple sentences before i could figure it out um fact all tragedy happens because of toxic masculinity and lack of communism this is uh during the time that the mandalay bay shootings happened last year the think peace factory is an overdrive over the las vegas massacre just about every thought piece you're going to read about las vegas will have one of two themes about motive the tragedy happened because toxic masculinity which is the feminist cop-out for everything or the tragedy happened because the lack of full communism in the presence of white people which is the sociology pre-grad cop-out for everything i'm sure toxic masculinity is what caused a sextagarian to commit mass murder it's also the reason why my crank case is habitually low on oil why septa is late and why my hoagie has too few jalapenos in it the other craptastic category of hot takes is a shitty reduction of economic theory when there are any study sources they point to fringe theory that's not generally accepted or it's way out of context or it's just bad quoting and use of stats and this article is basically about uh shitty clickbait and it actually shows a real a real headline here can a shift in the perception of masculinity curb mass violence so yeah people actually made made shit like this back when the the mandalay bay shootings were happening people actually did blame it on toxic masculinity and we have reached a point where satire of something like this article is nearly indistinguishable and speaking of satire here's an article that frankly could be read as satire but it's not women work longer as the men cut their hours now this is not how this originally read they have changed the title and it used to read this woman work longer hours than men that's all it said before and they realized that they had kind of fucked up and here's why a nationwide survey of 1600 employees found that women now work almost 34 hours a week on average half a day longer than the figure of 30.4 hours five years ago over the same five-year period men's average work hours fell from 45.5 hours per week to 44.8 hours although among the hardest working males the number putting in more than 49 hours a week has passed the 3 million mark so even as the headline says women work longer hours than men immediately in the first few paragraphs they contradict that women now work almost 34 hours a week men's average work hours fell to 44.8 hours there is no way the headline is in any way reflective of reality which is why the url of the article still says women work longer hours than men and they changed the headline because they were immediately found out as the hacks that the daily mail actually are and really if you want an explanation of the gender pay gap it's right here all right women work 34 hours a week on average men work 44.8 hours a week on average that's a pretty decent explanation don't you think men are working 10 more hours per week on average maybe they're making 10 more hours per week worth of money on average or here's another reason almost three quarters of those working long hours that would be mostly men admitted that they were likely to go to work even if they were ill while two-thirds had gone to the office on public holidays in the past year and a half and said they would put work ahead of personal commitment well there you go maybe that's the gender pay gap there's a lot of things that could be the gender pay gap how about this women are also more likely to be found in relatively poorly paid caring professions than men pushing down their overall average wages well it's not that women are to be found in these professions women choose to be in these professions they take these jobs they go to these schools they choose these careers for themselves but let's keep talking statistics with new hampshire 94 white asks how do you diversify a whole state this is a ridiculous proposition for multiple reasons one locations as in wide huge areas of land do not need to be diversified you do not need to push out people who are currently living there you do not need to to force some kind of intermingling or race mixing you just let people do what they want to do let them live where they want to live in fact as i recall pushing out an entire group of people and replacing them with another group of people even if you don't kill them is still considered to be ethnic cleansing under international law so why would you want to diversify new hampshire why don't you just keep it the way it is why don't you allow people to move as they see fit catalina selentano used to hold trading sessions for hospital workers in lynn massachusetts to familiarize them with the cultures of patients from cambodia russia and the dominican republic when she moved to new hampshire she suddenly found herself in an ethnic vacuum well if being in an ethnic vacuum was that distressing to you why did you move to new hampshire if you wanted to live in the culture that you were born in and raised in why didn't you stay in the location and with the people from that culture i went from being able to speak spanish every day to not speaking spanish at all because there wasn't anybody to speak spanish to you don't get to move to a place and demand everyone change to suit your needs new hampshire like its neighbors vermont and maine is nearly all white this has posed an array of problems for new arrivals who often find themselves isolated and alone without the comfort and support of a built-in community well that's why it's called a built-in community somebody had to build it and if you're not up to the task of building a community if you want the government to diversify new hampshire then you need to leave it's that simple it has also posed problems for employers in these states who find that their homogeneity can be a barrier to recruiting and retaining workers of different ethnicities and cultural backgrounds again that's only a problem if you care about ticking off these these ridiculous boxes on a list if you just hire the best people for the job and don't give a shit about race none of this matters the issue prompted about a hundred business leaders government officials and members of non-profit organizations to meet thursday to search for ways that new hampshire which is 94 white might lure other racial and ethnic groups as well as younger people maybe they don't explicitly need to do that maybe they just maybe they should just lure people you know qualified people for the jobs that they have and then see who shows up and if it turns out that a bunch more white people show up it shouldn't matter diversity quotas are going to be the downfall of all of these initiatives with non-whites poised to make up a majority of the american population in the next three decades diversity has become a bottom line imperative for companies competing for talent especially for workers who can speak other languages man the way that the term non-whites is used there it's almost the way that the kkk used it like 50 years ago as it stands new hampshire is three percent latino two percent african-american and three percent asian the nation as a whole is 17 latino 14 African-American and six percent asian well that means that states that aren't new hampshire some other states they have a ratio of latinos that is higher than 17 a ratio of african-americans that is higher than 14 and a ratio of asians that is higher than six percent and nobody nobody is calling for more white people to be imported to those states there's no massive call to diversify the latino and black south right now nobody cares about that shit nobody cares about bringing white people into those states but when when white people hold a 94 majority you got to start bringing people in it's it's a ridiculous idea it doesn't matter the race doesn't matter it's not just the social justice groups that are doing this it's the businesses we're talking about the economic engine of our state and we can't move forward without them well you know what the businesses are going to tank because of the social justice bullshit it doesn't sell we know it doesn't sell in fact i was saving this for for a future video but it's relevant right now so i'll bring it up right now here's here's some bonus stuff for you okay this is from a study called jumping to conclusions advocacy and application of psychological research in the politics of social psychology from 2017 the psychologist advancing implicit bias as the explanation for various societal inequalities and harms jumped to the conclusion apparently in the sincere belief that the data would eventually support that conclusion but it has not the accumulated data in fact now shows that measures of implicit bias provide no more explanatory power than explicit bias even for socially sensitive topics and often provide less explanatory power there is no reliable link between implicit bias and police officers and police violence against minorities and there is no reliable link between implicit bias and employment evaluations or employment outcomes for women and minorities if those behind applications of implicit bias to the law really are committed to behavioral realism to taking science seriously and making values secondary to science as they say then they must accept that implicit bias has not turned out to be the explanatory juggernaut it was optimistically expected to be despite these now undisputed facts the implicit bias construct continues to play an influential role in public debates court cases in the making of governmental and company policy millions of dollars are being spent on untested implicit bias training and consulting disposing of the mistaken belief that implicit bias is a powerful and pervasive corruptor of behavior will be slow and difficult now david arback who is an intellectual that i do follow and read uh semi-regularly he summed this up implicit bias training in such measures were initially promoted and adopted with the rhetoric of profit diversity is good for business now they're being seen as financial losers and will be dropped by the same criteria and he's replying to the tweet that says psychologists admit that by pushing implicit bias they have foisted a big cash destruction machine on society that won't go away easily whether or not implicit bias is real bias sure is justifying diversity programs on the grounds of profit margins was highly likely to backfire but it's created a good deal of leftist corporate sympathy along the way so what does this all mean uh this means that implicit bias isn't real it's it's most likely not real the idea that you have some kind of subconscious or subliminal racist or sexist slants even when you try to not be that person it's it's complete bs and the implicit bias training like the starbucks stuff and other stuff that we've seen it's all useless and it's basically a giant cash hole and these businesses thinking that diversity is the way forward have been duped into shoveling millions and billions of dollars into these giant cash sinks that are basically just going straight to sjws they're going to like the gender studies people they're going to the implicit bias people they're going to the to the social justice warriors that that write this junk and promote this junk and teach this junk and it's going to be a complete fucking nightmare it's already a complete fucking nightmare but it's going to get worse because as companies realize that this does nothing and this earns them nothing they're going to basically figure out they've been taken for a ride you know they've had they have all these diversity hires that are doing nothing in their companies and in the next decade when they wake up to that fact there's going to be a mass purge from these companies and that's what's going on here in this article the new hampshire white diversity article it's not just the social justice groups that are doing this it's the businesses and they're doing it to their own folly this is going to destroy these businesses and of course it's coming from the new york times um and we all know what the new york times has done recently they've they've recently hired a very interesting young woman and i may do something on her this week but until then i'll see you guys later i love you", "segments": [{"id": 0, "seek": 0, "start": 0.0, "end": 6.640000000000001, "text": "
