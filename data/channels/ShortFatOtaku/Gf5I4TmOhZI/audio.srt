00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,640
good morning my friends welcome to sj weekly what is this the sixth the seventh i forgot it

2
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:12,720
um but it's for august 5th 2018 and uh listen to this

3
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:24,960
that is the sound of a delicious morning coffee and yeah yeah i'm kind of a coffee

4
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:32,080
fag i i definitely like to uh indulge in a in a morning coffee it's one of the few

5
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:38,960
pleasures left in life it seems um but let's start with on the washington post and i'm actually

6
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:45,360
doing this incognito mode because they don't like ad blocker which i did finally get and they don't

7
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:49,520
like the fact that i've looked at too many articles on their site this month even though

8
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:56,720
it's only been five fucking days so is your spin class too young too thin and too white

9
00:00:56,720 --> 00:01:03,600
the epitome of first world problems as boutique exercise studios expanded a rapid clip some are

10
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:08,800
questioning who's welcome after a few committed months of hot yoga at a studio in new york

11
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:13,360
christina rice had found her niche so when the studio announced that it was offering teacher

12
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:18,240
training she signed right up it was only when she arrived with her mat that she noticed something

13
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:24,000
striking there were 54 other women and men in the 10-week course and not one of them looked

14
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,920
like her she was the lone african-american in the class i did bond with some of the other students

15
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:36,240
says rice but i did feel very isolated at times there were no teachers of color i didn't have

16
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:41,200
another woman who looked like me who understood my struggles my insecurities it's it's just

17
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:50,640
fucking yoga dude do you really need to to be performing yoga of color this really sounds like

18
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:57,920
an entitled frankly rich black woman complaining that there aren't more entitled rich black women

19
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:05,040
for her to hang out with if you went to like any of the united states's poor black population

20
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:10,720
they would laugh this woman out of the hood boutique workout studios specialized exercise

21
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:16,560
specific gyms are exploding in gentrifying urban areas well maybe that's why you don't see many

22
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:22,240
black people there they include not only hot yoga but also crossfit which is everywhere berry's

23
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:28,960
boot camp soul cycle or orange theory they are the modern answer to the sprawling soulless gym

24
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:34,000
which insists on financial commitment but doesn't really care whether you actually work out in the

25
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,960
boutique world you make reservations you're greeted with smiles you're served an ice-cold

26
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:45,040
glass of the spin class is self-care kool-aid this really sounds like somebody who who just

27
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:51,920
couldn't make it at a regular gym gyms can be sprawling and they can be soulless but they

28
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:58,880
require you to be the engine not some kind of external force the point of a gym is that you go

29
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:05,200
and work out and you have to push yourself to work out and if you're incapable of pushing yourself to

30
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:11,200
lift those weights and you need something like say a boutique workout studio where you have

31
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:15,200
somebody leading you in the exercise you know of course if you want to pay your money and go do

32
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:20,560
that it's it's you're right right but this really sounds like it's looking down its nose at gyms and

33
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:25,120
by extension the people that can actually self-motivate and here's where we can see that

34
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:30,640
having a leader in your exercise is actually a privilege but some people have begun to question

35
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:37,280
the stark differences between the studios and the neighborhood ymca like the prices in washington

36
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:45,200
a single 50-minute barry's boot camp class is 34 spinning studio flywheel charges 30 solid core can

37
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:50,640
run as much as 37 or about half the cost of a monthly membership in most urban gyms that's

38
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:56,480
because these places come with trainers built into them if you go to a gym with a trainer it's going

39
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:01,120
to be a lot more expensive than if you just go to a gym and follow a workout that you found on fit

40
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:07,280
or something and like rice other fitness junkies have begun to notice who isn't coming sweat

41
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:12,880
through a class in one of these studios and it's very possible that you'll see it many many lith

42
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:20,480
young white bodies and few people of color or older or heavier exercisers maybe it's because

43
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:25,680
as you said this is happening in young white gentrifying areas maybe it's because a privilege

44
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:34,800
that only rich white kids can afford maybe maybe it's because older people generally don't want to

45
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:40,800
take care of themselves or at least not in this manner usually old people don't work out or if

46
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:47,040
they do work out they go to gyms but long who is african-american and hispanic is struck by what

47
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:53,440
she sees there what is their messaging saying about aging what is fit what is beauty i look at

48
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:58,240
everything from the signage to the marketing materials and all she sees are millennials how

49
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:05,120
open and inclusive is that well i mean what do you want to do do you want to force old black people

50
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:11,120
at gunpoint to come to these these gyms stanley who has gained some fame with her criticisms of

51
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:16,480
boutique workout and yoga culture's lack of diversity describes the studio she has visited

52
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:22,000
outside the big city bubble as anything but diverse she tackles the subject in her book

53
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:28,640
everybody yoga the issue she says extends beyond race i definitely want to find a copy of this book

54
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:34,560
now oh there's actually an amazon link well i'm not gonna pay for it um she's often the only fat

55
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:38,640
woman in the room as well she says and if you're looking for a mature crowd you have to keep looking

56
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:43,600
too by the health club association's reckoning the average age of studio exercisers is 30

57
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:49,760
the messaging says stanley is essentially you're allowed in the space if you're white slender able

58
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:55,600
body and less than 45 cisgender and heterosexual and if you're not then you're not welcome except

59
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:02,240
stanley you look like somebody who is none of those things and obviously you're attending

60
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:08,480
these studios maybe it's not that people aren't allowed in these studios maybe it's that they

61
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:16,160
don't want to go maybe it's that people have the freedom of choice to choose whether they want to

62
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:22,640
go to an exercise studio or a gym or to just work out at home or to not work out at all maybe it's

63
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:28,640
not a race and gender issue and maybe you don't need to make everything a race and gender issue

64
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:33,520
okay this is stupid i'm moving on to the next article uh i skimmed the rest of this off camera

65
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:38,160
and it's all literally just the same bullshit blaming white people because black people don't

66
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:43,200
want to attend these ridiculous fucking studios okay i'm done well maybe if those minorities had

67
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:47,520
more money in their pockets they would attend those studios but it turns out that might not be

68
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:54,160
the case finland's basic income test wasn't ambitious enough the payments encourage

69
00:06:54,160 --> 00:07:01,200
beneficiaries to take work that doesn't pay a living wage kela the finnish social security agency

70
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:05,280
has failed to secure the funding it needs to extend its universal basic income experiment

71
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:11,680
beyond this year although it's sad that this grand leftist idea is suffering yet another setback

72
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:16,800
finland's trial effort deserved its fate before the experiment was approved by the government in

73
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:25,520
2016 kela officials talked about paying 800 euros or 974 a month in unconditional income to test a

74
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:31,200
group of working age citizens but by the time the program began early last year the amount was

75
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:37,280
whittled down to 560 euros if extended to the whole country the cost of the earlier proposal

76
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:42,320
would have exceeded the finnish government's entire revenue a similarly impractical approach

77
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:49,680
led to the failure of a 2016 swiss referendum on offering a payout of 2500 swiss francs it's almost

78
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:55,760
like if you keep giving away people's money for nothing you will run out of money it's all but

79
00:07:55,760 --> 00:08:01,360
impossible to live on 560 euros in finland a one-bedroom apartment on the outskirts of helinski

80
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:06,320
rents for almost that much so the experiment's designer settled on not really paying the ubi to

81
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:11,520
the unemployed who kept a higher level of government support at least 32.4 euros a day

82
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:17,040
for the first 400 days after losing a job only the working poor would benefit significantly from it

83
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:24,640
i'm sure that you and i know that the reason this failed is because you can't just throw money at

84
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:30,240
problems and hope they go away there is definitely a problem with with grinding poverty there's

85
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:36,080
definitely a problem with people not being able to get an education or start a business or do what

86
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:41,440
they want to do with their lives but you can't just mindlessly throw gobs of cash and expect

87
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:46,160
the problem to fix itself but i have a feeling that this article i haven't i haven't read the

88
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:50,800
whole thing yet but i have a feeling that the slant is going to take is that they didn't give

89
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:56,480
enough money not that the idea of the ubi is inherently flawed finland has a low employment

90
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:01,440
rate for a rich country just 71% of the working age population compared to 77% in neighboring

91
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:05,600
sweden and almost 86 percent in iceland so the idea was to provide an incentive for the

92
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:10,640
unemployed to step into the job market even if it meant taking on part-time or badly paid work

93
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:16,160
the other goal was to simplify finland's complex system of housing child care and other benefits

94
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:21,840
by replacing them with the lump sum payment i don't know if giving people money for nothing

95
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:29,040
is going to incentivize them to take on part-time or badly paid work you know the the point of

96
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:36,160
something like a ubi is to one rescue people in grinding poverty who just cannot who have

97
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:42,320
nothing zero just can't get ahead because they have no base with which to start and two it's

98
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:49,280
to assist people in you know if they're if they're working something like part-time work or badly paid

99
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:55,440
work it's to assist them into having a buffer so that they can maybe invest in themselves or go

100
00:09:55,440 --> 00:10:01,200
back to school or on the side start their business it's to help ambitious people however this article

101
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:06,800
and in general ubi supporters seem to assume that all people are ambitious people which is just not

102
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:12,480
the case the ubi is not going to get people into part-time or badly paid work it's designed to get

103
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:18,320
ambitious people without resources out of that work keela is not promising to release any results

104
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:24,160
of the experiment nobody's surprise there which involves 2 000 people until the end of 2019 or

105
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:29,760
even the beginning of 2020 but it was clear from the start that a basic income even such a low one

106
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:35,680
is an extremely expensive way to boost precarious forms of employment at 550 euros a month keela

107
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:43,360
calculated the ubi would cost 19.3 billion euros a year while the government would only save 3.6

108
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:48,080
billion euros on existing benefits as for getting people to return to the job market the center-right

109
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:55,200
cabinet of prime minister uh juha i don't know how to pronounce that juha sapila appears to be

110
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:59,680
more interested in cost-effective negative motivation for the unemployed than in rewarding

111
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:04,480
them for finding work that doesn't pay a living wage the government has proposed for example

112
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:10,080
requiring out-of-work people to apply for at least one job a week to keep receiving benefits unless

113
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:15,920
they're in job training programs i never i never really thought i'd see the day that i'd be agreeing

114
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:20,800
with right-leaning politicians or parliaments but that's really how things have been going the past

115
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:26,320
few years the ubi idea is not dead it's still worth watching other experiments especially the

116
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:31,280
ones that actually provide a living income these include oakland california which pays two thousand

117
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:37,840
dollars a month almost exactly the poverty line and the one in kenya which plays 23 a month about

118
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:43,680
half the average income in the country's rural areas other tests in dutch city of utrecht and

119
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:48,320
an upcoming one in ontario canada i'll i'll correct you right now that one has actually

120
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:53,520
ended and has not went well um offer low payouts relative to the living standard but still higher

121
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:58,480
than in the finished test i don't know the ubi is an answer to the right question but it's the

122
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:03,040
wrong answer at the very least though they are asking the right questions it's it's not quite

123
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:07,600
as bad as communists who just don't understand economics proponents of the ubi understand that

124
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:14,720
at least people need to work and they're saying well how about we just give them some money

125
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:19,760
and allow them to work on what they want well that's it's it's better than assuming that all

126
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:24,400
people are the same which is what communism does but it's still it's still not gonna work because

127
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:30,160
there will be too many people who will just take the money and not work in my opinion um loans or

128
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:37,040
grants for for school or loans or grants for starting small businesses um that's the way

129
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:42,880
that we should be going because that will actually provide people who are ambitious but poor

130
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:50,240
with the resources that they need to actually get their lives going not something like a ubi i still

131
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:54,240
can't quite tell which way this article is leaning which i guess is actually a good thing at least

132
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:58,480
it's it's somewhat neutral but uh here's an article that is just straight up parody and i

133
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:04,400
actually had to read the first couple sentences before i could figure it out um fact all tragedy

134
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:10,240
happens because of toxic masculinity and lack of communism this is uh during the time that

135
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:14,800
the mandalay bay shootings happened last year the think peace factory is an overdrive over the

136
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:18,800
las vegas massacre just about every thought piece you're going to read about las vegas will have one

137
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:23,200
of two themes about motive the tragedy happened because toxic masculinity which is the feminist

138
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:27,920
cop-out for everything or the tragedy happened because the lack of full communism in the presence

139
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:32,960
of white people which is the sociology pre-grad cop-out for everything i'm sure toxic masculinity

140
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:38,480
is what caused a sextagarian to commit mass murder it's also the reason why my crank case

141
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:43,360
is habitually low on oil why septa is late and why my hoagie has too few jalapenos in it

142
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:49,200
the other craptastic category of hot takes is a shitty reduction of economic theory when there are

143
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:53,360
any study sources they point to fringe theory that's not generally accepted or it's way out

144
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:58,480
of context or it's just bad quoting and use of stats and this article is basically about

145
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:06,480
uh shitty clickbait and it actually shows a real a real headline here can a shift in the perception

146
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:13,760
of masculinity curb mass violence so yeah people actually made made shit like this back when the

147
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:19,120
the mandalay bay shootings were happening people actually did blame it on toxic masculinity and we

148
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:24,800
have reached a point where satire of something like this article is nearly indistinguishable

149
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:31,520
and speaking of satire here's an article that frankly could be read as satire but it's not

150
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:37,120
women work longer as the men cut their hours now this is not how this originally read they have

151
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:44,160
changed the title and it used to read this woman work longer hours than men that's all it said

152
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:50,480
before and they realized that they had kind of fucked up and here's why a nationwide survey of

153
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:56,640
1600 employees found that women now work almost 34 hours a week on average half a day longer than

154
00:14:56,640 --> 00:15:03,120
the figure of 30.4 hours five years ago over the same five-year period men's average work hours

155
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:09,760
fell from 45.5 hours per week to 44.8 hours although among the hardest working males the

156
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:16,720
number putting in more than 49 hours a week has passed the 3 million mark so even as the headline

157
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:23,120
says women work longer hours than men immediately in the first few paragraphs they contradict that

158
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:29,600
women now work almost 34 hours a week men's average work hours fell to 44.8 hours there is

159
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:35,600
no way the headline is in any way reflective of reality which is why the url of the article still

160
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:40,400
says women work longer hours than men and they changed the headline because they were immediately

161
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:45,440
found out as the hacks that the daily mail actually are and really if you want an explanation of the

162
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:53,040
gender pay gap it's right here all right women work 34 hours a week on average men work 44.8

163
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:58,560
hours a week on average that's a pretty decent explanation don't you think men are working 10

164
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:04,560
more hours per week on average maybe they're making 10 more hours per week worth of money

165
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:09,040
on average or here's another reason almost three quarters of those working long hours

166
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:14,800
that would be mostly men admitted that they were likely to go to work even if they were ill

167
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:19,280
while two-thirds had gone to the office on public holidays in the past year and a half

168
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:24,560
and said they would put work ahead of personal commitment well there you go maybe that's the

169
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:28,000
gender pay gap there's a lot of things that could be the gender pay gap how about this

170
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:33,440
women are also more likely to be found in relatively poorly paid caring professions than men

171
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:39,760
pushing down their overall average wages well it's not that women are to be found in these professions

172
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:45,120
women choose to be in these professions they take these jobs they go to these schools they

173
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:52,160
choose these careers for themselves but let's keep talking statistics with new hampshire 94 white

174
00:16:52,160 --> 00:17:01,120
asks how do you diversify a whole state this is a ridiculous proposition for multiple reasons

175
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:09,440
one locations as in wide huge areas of land do not need to be diversified you do not need to push

176
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:15,600
out people who are currently living there you do not need to to force some kind of intermingling

177
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:21,520
or race mixing you just let people do what they want to do let them live where they want to live

178
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:27,280
in fact as i recall pushing out an entire group of people and replacing them with another group

179
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:33,760
of people even if you don't kill them is still considered to be ethnic cleansing under

180
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:40,000
international law so why would you want to diversify new hampshire why don't you just

181
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:48,640
keep it the way it is why don't you allow people to move as they see fit catalina selentano used

182
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:54,480
to hold trading sessions for hospital workers in lynn massachusetts to familiarize them with

183
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:58,880
the cultures of patients from cambodia russia and the dominican republic when she moved to

184
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:05,840
new hampshire she suddenly found herself in an ethnic vacuum well if being in an ethnic vacuum

185
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:12,880
was that distressing to you why did you move to new hampshire if you wanted to live in the culture

186
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:19,520
that you were born in and raised in why didn't you stay in the location and with the people from that

187
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:25,120
culture i went from being able to speak spanish every day to not speaking spanish at all because

188
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:30,080
there wasn't anybody to speak spanish to you don't get to move to a place and demand everyone

189
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:35,440
change to suit your needs new hampshire like its neighbors vermont and maine is nearly all white

190
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:40,320
this has posed an array of problems for new arrivals who often find themselves isolated

191
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:45,360
and alone without the comfort and support of a built-in community well that's why it's called

192
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:52,000
a built-in community somebody had to build it and if you're not up to the task of building a

193
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:59,440
community if you want the government to diversify new hampshire then you need to leave it's that

194
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:04,720
simple it has also posed problems for employers in these states who find that their homogeneity

195
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:09,280
can be a barrier to recruiting and retaining workers of different ethnicities and cultural

196
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:14,560
backgrounds again that's only a problem if you care about ticking off these these ridiculous

197
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:21,360
boxes on a list if you just hire the best people for the job and don't give a shit about race none

198
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:25,600
of this matters the issue prompted about a hundred business leaders government officials

199
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:30,400
and members of non-profit organizations to meet thursday to search for ways that new hampshire

200
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:36,080
which is 94 white might lure other racial and ethnic groups as well as younger people

201
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:41,360
maybe they don't explicitly need to do that maybe they just maybe they should just lure people you

202
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:47,600
know qualified people for the jobs that they have and then see who shows up and if it turns out that

203
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:52,560
a bunch more white people show up it shouldn't matter diversity quotas are going to be the

204
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:57,520
downfall of all of these initiatives with non-whites poised to make up a majority of

205
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:02,480
the american population in the next three decades diversity has become a bottom line imperative for

206
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:07,120
companies competing for talent especially for workers who can speak other languages man the

207
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:13,600
way that the term non-whites is used there it's almost the way that the kkk used it like 50 years

208
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:19,440
ago as it stands new hampshire is three percent latino two percent african-american and three

209
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:27,120
percent asian the nation as a whole is 17 latino 14 African-American and six percent asian well

210
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:32,560
that means that states that aren't new hampshire some other states they have a ratio of latinos

211
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:39,280
that is higher than 17 a ratio of african-americans that is higher than 14 and a ratio of asians that

212
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:45,280
is higher than six percent and nobody nobody is calling for more white people to be imported to

213
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:53,360
those states there's no massive call to diversify the latino and black south right now nobody cares

214
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:58,400
about that shit nobody cares about bringing white people into those states but when when white

215
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:03,840
people hold a 94 majority you got to start bringing people in it's it's a ridiculous idea

216
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:08,880
it doesn't matter the race doesn't matter it's not just the social justice groups that are doing this

217
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:13,520
it's the businesses we're talking about the economic engine of our state and we can't move

218
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:19,600
forward without them well you know what the businesses are going to tank because of the

219
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:25,520
social justice bullshit it doesn't sell we know it doesn't sell in fact i was saving this for

220
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:29,920
for a future video but it's relevant right now so i'll bring it up right now here's here's some bonus

221
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:35,840
stuff for you okay this is from a study called jumping to conclusions advocacy and application

222
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:41,120
of psychological research in the politics of social psychology from 2017 the psychologist

223
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:45,600
advancing implicit bias as the explanation for various societal inequalities and harms

224
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:49,760
jumped to the conclusion apparently in the sincere belief that the data would eventually support that

225
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:56,400
conclusion but it has not the accumulated data in fact now shows that measures of implicit bias

226
00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:02,480
provide no more explanatory power than explicit bias even for socially sensitive topics and often

227
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:07,680
provide less explanatory power there is no reliable link between implicit bias and police

228
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:12,560
officers and police violence against minorities and there is no reliable link between implicit

229
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:18,800
bias and employment evaluations or employment outcomes for women and minorities if those behind

230
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:24,560
applications of implicit bias to the law really are committed to behavioral realism to taking

231
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:29,520
science seriously and making values secondary to science as they say then they must accept

232
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:33,920
that implicit bias has not turned out to be the explanatory juggernaut it was

233
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:40,880
optimistically expected to be despite these now undisputed facts the implicit bias construct

234
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:46,320
continues to play an influential role in public debates court cases in the making of governmental

235
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:52,400
and company policy millions of dollars are being spent on untested implicit bias training and

236
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:58,320
consulting disposing of the mistaken belief that implicit bias is a powerful and pervasive corruptor

237
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:05,520
of behavior will be slow and difficult now david arback who is an intellectual that i do follow

238
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:11,600
and read uh semi-regularly he summed this up implicit bias training in such measures were

239
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:16,400
initially promoted and adopted with the rhetoric of profit diversity is good for business now

240
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:21,520
they're being seen as financial losers and will be dropped by the same criteria and he's replying to

241
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:27,040
the tweet that says psychologists admit that by pushing implicit bias they have foisted a big

242
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:32,880
cash destruction machine on society that won't go away easily whether or not implicit bias is real

243
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:38,800
bias sure is justifying diversity programs on the grounds of profit margins was highly likely to

244
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:45,360
backfire but it's created a good deal of leftist corporate sympathy along the way so what does this

245
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:52,240
all mean uh this means that implicit bias isn't real it's it's most likely not real the idea that

246
00:23:52,240 --> 00:24:00,480
you have some kind of subconscious or subliminal racist or sexist slants even when you try to not

247
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:07,280
be that person it's it's complete bs and the implicit bias training like the starbucks stuff

248
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:14,240
and other stuff that we've seen it's all useless and it's basically a giant cash hole and these

249
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:20,880
businesses thinking that diversity is the way forward have been duped into shoveling millions

250
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:26,560
and billions of dollars into these giant cash sinks that are basically just going straight to

251
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:31,040
sjws they're going to like the gender studies people they're going to the implicit bias people

252
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:36,240
they're going to the to the social justice warriors that that write this junk and promote this junk

253
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:41,440
and teach this junk and it's going to be a complete fucking nightmare it's already a complete

254
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:45,840
fucking nightmare but it's going to get worse because as companies realize that this does

255
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:52,160
nothing and this earns them nothing they're going to basically figure out they've been taken for a

256
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:56,480
ride you know they've had they have all these diversity hires that are doing nothing in their

257
00:24:56,480 --> 00:25:02,240
companies and in the next decade when they wake up to that fact there's going to be a mass purge

258
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:05,680
from these companies and that's what's going on here in this article the new hampshire white

259
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:10,160
diversity article it's not just the social justice groups that are doing this it's the businesses

260
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:15,040
and they're doing it to their own folly this is going to destroy these businesses and of course

261
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:21,200
it's coming from the new york times um and we all know what the new york times has done recently

262
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:27,120
they've they've recently hired a very interesting young woman and i may do something on her this

263
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:31,760
week but until then i'll see you guys later i love you
