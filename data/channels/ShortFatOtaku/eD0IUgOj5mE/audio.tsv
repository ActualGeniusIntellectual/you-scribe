0	2160	Hey guys, Dev here.
2160	6380	Dave was supposed to do this video like the last two times, but because he's a hungover
6380	8780	lazy bum I'm going to do it instead.
8780	13020	The video footage is just me playing Marble Zone Act 3 in the original Sonic the Hedgehog
13020	14020	again.
14020	18000	I wanted to show all of you naysayers I could do it without Dave heckling me.
18000	21660	For those of you paying attention to our channel, you probably noticed that we managed to keep
21660	26700	a 5 video a week schedule going from September to January with only a few minor hiccups.
26700	29420	That's a pretty big success in our books.
29420	33860	Going forward, we're going to try to expand that to 7 videos a week.
33860	37260	That's right, a Team SFO video every single day.
37260	40380	Let's take a look at how things will be arranged from here on.
40380	42900	The week begins with multiplayer Mondays.
42900	48100	We'll be playing a variety of 4 player games every Monday, and introducing old and new
48100	50020	faces to the channel as well.
50020	53780	Tuesday will remain the release day for Sonic and Miramasa.
53780	57820	Instead of alternating though, I think we'll release one until it finishes, then release
57820	58820	the other.
59060	63860	So one of these two titles will go on a short hiatus, probably Miramasa since Sonic the
63860	66340	Hedgehog 2 is a much shorter game.
66340	70940	On Wednesday, we've got the second season of Game Roulette already underway.
70940	76380	Our channel actually won 3 awards for the first season of Game Roulette, so hey, why
76380	78220	not keep it up?
78220	80420	Plus the 3 of us love doing it.
80420	83260	Thursday is Zelda Day, currently linked to the past.
83260	84260	This is the same.
84260	86540	Fire Red Fridays are still a thing as well.
86540	92860	Banjo Kazooie is moving to Saturdays, however as Fire Red comes to a close, Banjo will eventually
92860	97060	shift to Friday with a new feature starting up on Saturday.
97060	100340	And finally, there's behind the scenes Sundays.
100340	105340	On this day, we'll post stuff like commentaries, bloopers, and other goodies.
105340	111220	Oh, and I know I've been talking about dev-trospectives now for a little while.
111220	114220	Almost 2 years actually, or at least a year and a half.
114220	118140	They're still coming, it's just we have so much stuff on the go it's kinda hard to get
118140	123340	around to everything, but they will come within the next couple months, and they'll also be
123340	128100	released on Sunday whenever there's no behind the scenes stuff to go out.
128100	133020	This will be a way for us to tackle larger animes that we couldn't cover in a single
133020	136340	SFO review, but it won't just be anime either.
136340	141020	Using dev-trospectives, I'm going to be looking at a whole bunch of different stuff.
141020	144980	I'm sure a lot of you are asking, what about the anime content?
144980	147620	After all, we started off as an anime channel.
147620	150300	Well, we haven't forgotten it.
150300	154620	When anime stuff comes out, it'll likely take the place of Zelda on Thursdays.
154620	160140	Also, we're going to try to ramp it back up to two anime videos a month, like how we had
160140	162420	in the summer of 2013.
162420	166580	There's been a minority of people complaining in comments about what they perceive as a
166580	170260	lack of anime content, and let me address that here.
170260	198200	Do you remember when the Short
198200	203560	Well of course, we could always do more, and we will always try to do more, no matter how
203560	208280	advanced we get, but those people who are claiming that we don't post as much anime
208280	213720	content as we used to, are just factually incorrect.
213720	216780	Also I guess I'll update you on the copyright situation.
216780	222280	As predicted, we've won every copyrighted battle we've come across, but on YouTube,
222280	223960	it's just never ending.
223960	228200	You've probably heard this already since the double shitstorm of Google Plus and multi-channel
228200	232480	network neutering just happened, but every time someone puts a claim on our videos, frivolous
232480	236840	or not, that's 30 days of ad revenue that we lose.
236840	240940	There are entire companies set up solely for the purpose of making unfounded copyright
240940	244440	claims on YouTube and stealing 30 days of advertising revenue.
244440	251000	So if you're a fan of the show, I'd ask you to check out our videos over at blip.tv slash
251000	256240	shortfatotaku or our website at shortfatotaku.com.
256240	259880	These sources provide a significantly bigger payout than YouTube does, which supports the
259880	260880	channel.
260880	264380	And it's not like we're just swimming in a pool of internet monies or anything.
264380	268840	We actually reinvest every single cent you guys send us right back into the show.
268840	274440	We reinvest everything so that we can give you a quality product, nothing saved for ourselves.
274440	278520	Of course, if you want to ad block, ad block, that's cool too, we won't hold it against
278520	279520	you.
279560	282680	We still enjoy the fact that you like to watch our content.
282680	285680	I mean, who do you think we are, Reviewtopia?
