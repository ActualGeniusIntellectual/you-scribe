1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,160
Hey guys, Dev here.

2
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:06,380
Dave was supposed to do this video like the last two times, but because he's a hungover

3
00:00:06,380 --> 00:00:08,780
lazy bum I'm going to do it instead.

4
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:13,020
The video footage is just me playing Marble Zone Act 3 in the original Sonic the Hedgehog

5
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:14,020
again.

6
00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:18,000
I wanted to show all of you naysayers I could do it without Dave heckling me.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,660
For those of you paying attention to our channel, you probably noticed that we managed to keep

8
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:26,700
a 5 video a week schedule going from September to January with only a few minor hiccups.

9
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:29,420
That's a pretty big success in our books.

10
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:33,860
Going forward, we're going to try to expand that to 7 videos a week.

11
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:37,260
That's right, a Team SFO video every single day.

12
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:40,380
Let's take a look at how things will be arranged from here on.

13
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:42,900
The week begins with multiplayer Mondays.

14
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:48,100
We'll be playing a variety of 4 player games every Monday, and introducing old and new

15
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:50,020
faces to the channel as well.

16
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:53,780
Tuesday will remain the release day for Sonic and Miramasa.

17
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:57,820
Instead of alternating though, I think we'll release one until it finishes, then release

18
00:00:57,820 --> 00:00:58,820
the other.

19
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:03,860
So one of these two titles will go on a short hiatus, probably Miramasa since Sonic the

20
00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:06,340
Hedgehog 2 is a much shorter game.

21
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:10,940
On Wednesday, we've got the second season of Game Roulette already underway.

22
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:16,380
Our channel actually won 3 awards for the first season of Game Roulette, so hey, why

23
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:18,220
not keep it up?

24
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:20,420
Plus the 3 of us love doing it.

25
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:23,260
Thursday is Zelda Day, currently linked to the past.

26
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:24,260
This is the same.

27
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:26,540
Fire Red Fridays are still a thing as well.

28
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:32,860
Banjo Kazooie is moving to Saturdays, however as Fire Red comes to a close, Banjo will eventually

29
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:37,060
shift to Friday with a new feature starting up on Saturday.

30
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:40,340
And finally, there's behind the scenes Sundays.

31
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:45,340
On this day, we'll post stuff like commentaries, bloopers, and other goodies.

32
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:51,220
Oh, and I know I've been talking about dev-trospectives now for a little while.

33
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:54,220
Almost 2 years actually, or at least a year and a half.

34
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:58,140
They're still coming, it's just we have so much stuff on the go it's kinda hard to get

35
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:03,340
around to everything, but they will come within the next couple months, and they'll also be

36
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:08,100
released on Sunday whenever there's no behind the scenes stuff to go out.

37
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:13,020
This will be a way for us to tackle larger animes that we couldn't cover in a single

38
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:16,340
SFO review, but it won't just be anime either.

39
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:21,020
Using dev-trospectives, I'm going to be looking at a whole bunch of different stuff.

40
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:24,980
I'm sure a lot of you are asking, what about the anime content?

41
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:27,620
After all, we started off as an anime channel.

42
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:30,300
Well, we haven't forgotten it.

43
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:34,620
When anime stuff comes out, it'll likely take the place of Zelda on Thursdays.

44
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:40,140
Also, we're going to try to ramp it back up to two anime videos a month, like how we had

45
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:42,420
in the summer of 2013.

46
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:46,580
There's been a minority of people complaining in comments about what they perceive as a

47
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:50,260
lack of anime content, and let me address that here.

48
00:02:50,260 --> 00:03:18,200
Do you remember when the Short

49
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:23,560
Well of course, we could always do more, and we will always try to do more, no matter how

50
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:28,280
advanced we get, but those people who are claiming that we don't post as much anime

51
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:33,720
content as we used to, are just factually incorrect.

52
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:36,780
Also I guess I'll update you on the copyright situation.

53
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:42,280
As predicted, we've won every copyrighted battle we've come across, but on YouTube,

54
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,960
it's just never ending.

55
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:48,200
You've probably heard this already since the double shitstorm of Google Plus and multi-channel

56
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:52,480
network neutering just happened, but every time someone puts a claim on our videos, frivolous

57
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:56,840
or not, that's 30 days of ad revenue that we lose.

58
00:03:56,840 --> 00:04:00,940
There are entire companies set up solely for the purpose of making unfounded copyright

59
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:04,440
claims on YouTube and stealing 30 days of advertising revenue.

60
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:11,000
So if you're a fan of the show, I'd ask you to check out our videos over at blip.tv slash

61
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:16,240
shortfatotaku or our website at shortfatotaku.com.

62
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:19,880
These sources provide a significantly bigger payout than YouTube does, which supports the

63
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:20,880
channel.

64
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:24,380
And it's not like we're just swimming in a pool of internet monies or anything.

65
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:28,840
We actually reinvest every single cent you guys send us right back into the show.

66
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:34,440
We reinvest everything so that we can give you a quality product, nothing saved for ourselves.

67
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:38,520
Of course, if you want to ad block, ad block, that's cool too, we won't hold it against

68
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:39,520
you.

69
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:42,680
We still enjoy the fact that you like to watch our content.

70
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:45,680
I mean, who do you think we are, Reviewtopia?
