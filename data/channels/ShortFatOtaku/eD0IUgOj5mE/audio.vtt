00:00.000 --> 00:02.160
Hey guys, Dev here.

00:02.160 --> 00:06.380
Dave was supposed to do this video like the last two times, but because he's a hungover

00:06.380 --> 00:08.780
lazy bum I'm going to do it instead.

00:08.780 --> 00:13.020
The video footage is just me playing Marble Zone Act 3 in the original Sonic the Hedgehog

00:13.020 --> 00:14.020
again.

00:14.020 --> 00:18.000
I wanted to show all of you naysayers I could do it without Dave heckling me.

00:18.000 --> 00:21.660
For those of you paying attention to our channel, you probably noticed that we managed to keep

00:21.660 --> 00:26.700
a 5 video a week schedule going from September to January with only a few minor hiccups.

00:26.700 --> 00:29.420
That's a pretty big success in our books.

00:29.420 --> 00:33.860
Going forward, we're going to try to expand that to 7 videos a week.

00:33.860 --> 00:37.260
That's right, a Team SFO video every single day.

00:37.260 --> 00:40.380
Let's take a look at how things will be arranged from here on.

00:40.380 --> 00:42.900
The week begins with multiplayer Mondays.

00:42.900 --> 00:48.100
We'll be playing a variety of 4 player games every Monday, and introducing old and new

00:48.100 --> 00:50.020
faces to the channel as well.

00:50.020 --> 00:53.780
Tuesday will remain the release day for Sonic and Miramasa.

00:53.780 --> 00:57.820
Instead of alternating though, I think we'll release one until it finishes, then release

00:57.820 --> 00:58.820
the other.

00:59.060 --> 01:03.860
So one of these two titles will go on a short hiatus, probably Miramasa since Sonic the

01:03.860 --> 01:06.340
Hedgehog 2 is a much shorter game.

01:06.340 --> 01:10.940
On Wednesday, we've got the second season of Game Roulette already underway.

01:10.940 --> 01:16.380
Our channel actually won 3 awards for the first season of Game Roulette, so hey, why

01:16.380 --> 01:18.220
not keep it up?

01:18.220 --> 01:20.420
Plus the 3 of us love doing it.

01:20.420 --> 01:23.260
Thursday is Zelda Day, currently linked to the past.

01:23.260 --> 01:24.260
This is the same.

01:24.260 --> 01:26.540
Fire Red Fridays are still a thing as well.

01:26.540 --> 01:32.860
Banjo Kazooie is moving to Saturdays, however as Fire Red comes to a close, Banjo will eventually

01:32.860 --> 01:37.060
shift to Friday with a new feature starting up on Saturday.

01:37.060 --> 01:40.340
And finally, there's behind the scenes Sundays.

01:40.340 --> 01:45.340
On this day, we'll post stuff like commentaries, bloopers, and other goodies.

01:45.340 --> 01:51.220
Oh, and I know I've been talking about dev-trospectives now for a little while.

01:51.220 --> 01:54.220
Almost 2 years actually, or at least a year and a half.

01:54.220 --> 01:58.140
They're still coming, it's just we have so much stuff on the go it's kinda hard to get

01:58.140 --> 02:03.340
around to everything, but they will come within the next couple months, and they'll also be

02:03.340 --> 02:08.100
released on Sunday whenever there's no behind the scenes stuff to go out.

02:08.100 --> 02:13.020
This will be a way for us to tackle larger animes that we couldn't cover in a single

02:13.020 --> 02:16.340
SFO review, but it won't just be anime either.

02:16.340 --> 02:21.020
Using dev-trospectives, I'm going to be looking at a whole bunch of different stuff.

02:21.020 --> 02:24.980
I'm sure a lot of you are asking, what about the anime content?

02:24.980 --> 02:27.620
After all, we started off as an anime channel.

02:27.620 --> 02:30.300
Well, we haven't forgotten it.

02:30.300 --> 02:34.620
When anime stuff comes out, it'll likely take the place of Zelda on Thursdays.

02:34.620 --> 02:40.140
Also, we're going to try to ramp it back up to two anime videos a month, like how we had

02:40.140 --> 02:42.420
in the summer of 2013.

02:42.420 --> 02:46.580
There's been a minority of people complaining in comments about what they perceive as a

02:46.580 --> 02:50.260
lack of anime content, and let me address that here.

02:50.260 --> 03:18.200
Do you remember when the Short

03:18.200 --> 03:23.560
Well of course, we could always do more, and we will always try to do more, no matter how

03:23.560 --> 03:28.280
advanced we get, but those people who are claiming that we don't post as much anime

03:28.280 --> 03:33.720
content as we used to, are just factually incorrect.

03:33.720 --> 03:36.780
Also I guess I'll update you on the copyright situation.

03:36.780 --> 03:42.280
As predicted, we've won every copyrighted battle we've come across, but on YouTube,

03:42.280 --> 03:43.960
it's just never ending.

03:43.960 --> 03:48.200
You've probably heard this already since the double shitstorm of Google Plus and multi-channel

03:48.200 --> 03:52.480
network neutering just happened, but every time someone puts a claim on our videos, frivolous

03:52.480 --> 03:56.840
or not, that's 30 days of ad revenue that we lose.

03:56.840 --> 04:00.940
There are entire companies set up solely for the purpose of making unfounded copyright

04:00.940 --> 04:04.440
claims on YouTube and stealing 30 days of advertising revenue.

04:04.440 --> 04:11.000
So if you're a fan of the show, I'd ask you to check out our videos over at blip.tv slash

04:11.000 --> 04:16.240
shortfatotaku or our website at shortfatotaku.com.

04:16.240 --> 04:19.880
These sources provide a significantly bigger payout than YouTube does, which supports the

04:19.880 --> 04:20.880
channel.

04:20.880 --> 04:24.380
And it's not like we're just swimming in a pool of internet monies or anything.

04:24.380 --> 04:28.840
We actually reinvest every single cent you guys send us right back into the show.

04:28.840 --> 04:34.440
We reinvest everything so that we can give you a quality product, nothing saved for ourselves.

04:34.440 --> 04:38.520
Of course, if you want to ad block, ad block, that's cool too, we won't hold it against

04:38.520 --> 04:39.520
you.

04:39.560 --> 04:42.680
We still enjoy the fact that you like to watch our content.

04:42.680 --> 04:45.680
I mean, who do you think we are, Reviewtopia?
