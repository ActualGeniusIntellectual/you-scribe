0	2240	YouTube's had a lot of problems with children, hasn't it?
2240	3240	Elsagate?
3240	4680	The whole child actor thing?
4680	7440	Removing comments and metrics for videos with kids in them?
7440	11280	It's almost like YouTube's an incompetent company that has no idea how to actually run
11280	12280	itself.
12280	15960	But, for once, the COPPA situation is actually not YouTube's fault.
15960	19480	I released a podcast with Scrump on this topic if you want to listen to it, because in it
19480	24040	we go over the particulars, but the basic idea is, in 1998, Bill Clinton signed into
24040	28280	law the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, intended to provide protections for people
28280	29520	under 13 years old.
29520	33080	It placed additional responsibilities on websites regarding their dealings with children, it
33080	36440	prevented those sites from collecting certain types of data from children, and it regulated
36440	38480	the contents of a website's privacy policy.
38480	42080	COPPA came about in response to the actions of a website called Kidscom.
42080	44920	That's kidscom.com, because boomers.
44920	49460	Kidscom was launched in 1995 as a virtual world where users could navigate the earth,
49460	51020	play games, and chat with others.
51020	54720	It was no Google Maps, but it was probably the best you were going to get back in 95.
54720	58040	However, Kidscom did, in fact, collect data from its users.
58040	62040	Yes, this garbage was happening back then, too, and COPPA was put forward as a regulatory
62040	63040	response.
63040	65600	COPPA's had multiple high-profile enforcements before YouTube.
65600	70200	The once-big blogging site Zanga, as well as the infamous Bonsai Buddy, both had to
70200	74160	pay fines for COPPA violations, regarding their data-harvesting practices.
74160	78920	More recently, TikTok got slammed with a $5.7 million dollar fine in February of this year,
78920	83080	which they responded to by partitioning the app into TikTok and TikTok Kids.
83080	84760	Which brings us to YouTube.
84760	89980	Back in September, YouTube was fined $170 million dollars due to widespread COPPA violations
89980	95280	on the site, including data collection of minors for use in their targeted ad algorithms.
95280	99820	In response, YouTube determined that by January 1st, 2020, all content creators will have
99820	104100	to designate whether every single video they've uploaded is kid-friendly or not, by checking
104100	106080	a box during the upload process.
106080	109480	Content creators can also set their entire channel to be kid-friendly or not in their
109480	110480	channel settings.
110480	114520	YouTube has already confirmed that in order to be compliant with COPPA, videos marked
114520	121280	as kid-friendly will have no notifications, no comments, will not be searchable on the
121280	126700	main YouTube platform, will not be suggested or recommended, and will make 60-90% less
126700	128640	revenue due to a lack of targeted ads.
128640	131320	All of these features require data collection to implement.
131320	134960	And if no data collection is allowed, these videos can't participate in those features.
134960	138880	The only feature listed that doesn't necessarily require data collection is the comments.
138880	142080	And YouTube has been disabling comments on all videos with kids in them, as a matter
142080	144260	of course, in the name of protecting children.
144260	147840	As I mentioned in that Dumping with Scrump earlier, I have a source that I can't reveal
147840	151660	who stated that YouTube's long-term plan is to eventually split the platform into YouTube
151660	156060	and YouTube Kids, much like TikTok did, where YouTube Kids will contain only those videos
156060	159800	marked as kid-friendly, and most people are hoping that that will allow the bulk of YouTube
159800	162840	to continue on as over 13-oriented content.
162840	164760	Except it still might not.
164760	166240	And here's where we get to the heart of the matter.
166480	169680	There's a lot of YouTubers out there who are way bigger than me talking about this
169680	170680	issue right now.
170680	174120	And I think that most of them don't actually have the situation right.
174120	178600	They recognize it serious, yeah, but they don't recognize it as a full-on game changer,
178600	182500	but rather just another dumb YouTube event where the platform is made incrementally shittier
182500	183500	yet again.
183500	184500	But no, this isn't minor.
184500	185720	This is a game changer.
185720	189800	This is not just rolling your eyes at a false D&CA claim, and then filling out the same
189800	193560	meaningless form three times over the course of three months, until the false claimant
193560	196760	drops it because no one's actually going to bring you to court over this unless they're
196760	197760	retarded.
197760	198760	No, no, no, no, no.
198760	201440	This is not just another layer of the YouTube bureaucratic nightmare.
201440	203120	This is entirely different.
203120	206640	Here's the full text of COPPA, and I'd like to read a few choice bits from it.
206640	211160	The regulations issued under the subsection shall A, require that any website directed
211160	215840	to children that collects personal information from children provide clear, prominent, understandable
215840	219480	notice of the information collection and use practices of the website operator through
219480	220480	the website.
220480	225000	B, maintain verifiable parental consent for the collection, use, or disclosure of personal
225000	228000	information for children who are under the age of 13.
228000	232200	And B, require that the commercial website operator concerned establish and maintain
232200	238400	reasonable procedures to ensure the confidentiality, security, accuracy, and integrity of personal
238400	240900	information collected from children through the website.
240900	244000	And here's what COPPA defines as a website targeted to children.
244000	249760	A commercial website that is, one, targeted to children, obviously, two, directed to children
249760	256200	by reason of the subject matter, visual content, age of the models, language, characters, tone,
256200	260360	message, or any other similar characteristic of the website.
260360	265800	Or three, used by a commercial website operator to knowingly collect information from children.
265800	270220	The biggest problem here is section two, because that's actually quite vague.
270220	274920	But thankfully the FTC has provided a handy dandy guidebook on what exactly qualifies
274920	277320	as kid targeted content.
277320	282700	The subject matter that is appealing to children, example, kids jokes, music, kids games, video
282700	289440	or computer games, children's TV shows or children's TV stars, cartoon characters, sports, stories,
289440	295200	toys, children's books, fantasy, children's arts and crafts, pets, products primarily
295200	299600	purchased or consumed by kids like snack food or cereal.
299600	302720	You can tell this legislation was made by boomers who don't understand that the primary
302720	307480	audience for things like video games, comics, and Marvel movies is no longer kids but 30
307480	308480	year old soy boys.
308480	311400	Plus, there's also a lot of adults who are interested in things like sports.
311400	314280	There's a lot of adults who eat cereal or snack foods.
314280	318080	Just because something appeals to some children doesn't mean that it also doesn't appeal
318080	319800	to some adults.
319800	322700	Language of the website, such as language that is simple enough to be understandable
322700	324600	to children 12 and under.
324600	326400	Short, colorful descriptions.
326400	328080	Slang and pop culture phrases.
328080	331880	Example, a kid's site may be identified by such language as kids only.
331880	332880	Fun.
332880	333880	Free stuff.
333880	334880	Whatever.
334880	335880	Cool.
335880	336880	Duh.
336880	337880	Games.
337880	338880	Ask your parents.
338880	339880	Etc.
339880	342440	You know, they really haven't updated this since Bill Clinton actually signed COPPA into
342440	343780	force have they?
343780	348520	Whether the website uses visual content appealing to children, animated characters, bold or
348520	352280	fast moving graphics, or bright and vibrant colors.
352280	355220	These things are not specifically child oriented.
355220	358100	These things are meant to catch anyone's eye.
358100	359920	Use of host characters.
359920	365600	In a character property, use offline, on television, in movies, or comics or books.
365600	368200	This is the absolute dumbing down of everything.
368200	371640	If you're recognizable, you're for kids now, I guess.
371640	373320	Audio content appealing to children.
373320	376200	Example, simple or popular tunes or songs.
376200	377600	Cartoon voices.
377600	379240	Childlike noises and sound effects.
379240	380560	So anything fun.
380560	381780	Anything goofy.
381780	387480	You guys know that morning zoo style radio shows use the same goofy songs and sound effects
387480	388740	as kids shows.
388980	392660	And those are absolutely not made for children, right FTC?
392660	395080	This is the ultimate problem with COPPA.
395080	399240	The FTC is the final arbiter of what will be considered kid targeted content.
399240	403060	Of course, you can still mark your videos as for adults, but this is not the same situation
403060	407100	as say, marking a video as fair use and working through a claim.
407100	410700	YouTube's not the judge this time, nor is there a claimant you can appeal to.
410700	411700	This is the FTC.
411700	413860	Here's an example of what I mean.
413860	418220	Let's say that you have a YouTube channel and you upload a let's play of a Mario game,
418220	421420	and you've got curses and adult jokes in it because you're an adult oriented let's
421420	424180	play channel on YouTube even though you're playing Nintendo games.
424180	427580	And so you're going to mark this video as adult oriented.
427580	429220	You would be insane not to.
429220	432720	Choosing it kid oriented would not only be inaccurate, but it would also tank your search
432720	434020	ability and your income.
434020	437180	However, the FTC is actually going to examine your video to see if it's kid friendly or
437180	440460	not, and if by their determination it's not, they'll fine you.
440460	444340	And this is all happening at the same time as YouTube's looking at your videos and changing
444340	448620	your manual selection on whether or not it's for kids if they disagree with your assessment.
448620	453160	A lot of YouTubers right now are viewing that potential fine part of this discussion a lot
453160	454800	less seriously than they should.
454800	458940	I think the general idea everyone has is that it's just a threat, and most people will squeak
458940	459940	by undetected.
459940	461620	But you know what?
461620	464660	I watched the FTC's public Q&A on this topic.
464660	466420	No, they confirmed.
466420	470940	They will be coming for YouTubers who mislabel their videos by their estimation.
470940	475660	Is it safe to say if YouTube is informing channel creators that they need to be COPPA
475660	480700	compliant, they go through the training, moving forward, content creators are more at risk
480700	484420	than the actual platform at being fined?
484420	489300	Content creators are always at risk of being fined because they're the con- and channel
489300	495220	owners because there we have a situation where we have a website or an online service that
495220	498820	is directed to children.
498820	504100	So there in the general audience platform, we still have this knowledge requirement that
504100	506260	we have to prove up.
506260	514340	So there is, I think in theory as well as practically speaking, generally a higher risk
514340	521120	for channel owners and content creators who after all are creating this content and know
521120	524480	intimately whether or not it's directed to children or not.
524480	527980	Because if a video is labeled for adults, and the FTC thinks it should be labeled for
527980	533180	kids, in their eyes that video will be harvesting data from children, therefore it will be a
533180	535060	finable COPPA violation.
535060	538060	And to go back to our example, we all know that they're going to see the fact that
538060	542180	it's Mario on screen with an eye-catching thumbnail, it's about video games and it's
542180	546220	got bright colors, so it has to be for kids common sense be damned.
546220	550700	I don't think they're able to find YouTubers based outside of the US.
550700	554740	Foreign Sites is listed as an exception in the COPPA compliance guidebook, and maybe
554740	559040	that'll also cover foreign YouTubers, even though YouTube itself is based in the States.
559040	563780	And therefore I still have to tag my videos as adult content, even if people like me can't
563780	566340	be touched by the FTC because I'm not an American.
566340	569500	And there's a very good chance that YouTube is entering into an era where all American
569500	574700	content creators need to make explicitly adult content with not even a whiff of color or
574700	578980	vibrancy or anything else that might attract the eye of a child or face a stiff fine.
578980	584180	The FTC is currently taking public feedback on the upcoming implementation of COPPA as
584180	588580	it pertains to YouTube, and they'll be doing so until December 9th, 2019.
588580	591460	I'll leave a link in the description if you want to go there and tell them why this
591460	593940	is an exceptionally bad idea on their part.
593940	598320	I don't usually ask you to do this, you know this, but please consider sharing this
598320	602880	video around to everyone you can, along with that feedback link, as well as engaging with
602880	607420	this video through likes and comments so that it gets upranked in YouTube's algorithm.
607420	610380	People need to see this shit before it's too late.
610380	612820	Thank you very much, I love you.
612820	617860	There will be consequences for content creators who mis-designate, including being kicked
617860	620900	off the YouTube platform.
620900	630260	So if content creators are not sincere or forthcoming with YouTube and designating content
630260	635360	as being directed to children, there will be consequences for them.
635360	640100	We also think that YouTube has strong incentives to police its platform.
