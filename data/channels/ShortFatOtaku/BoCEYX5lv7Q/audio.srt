1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,240
YouTube's had a lot of problems with children, hasn't it?

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:03,240
Elsagate?

3
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:04,680
The whole child actor thing?

4
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:07,440
Removing comments and metrics for videos with kids in them?

5
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:11,280
It's almost like YouTube's an incompetent company that has no idea how to actually run

6
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:12,280
itself.

7
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:15,960
But, for once, the COPPA situation is actually not YouTube's fault.

8
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:19,480
I released a podcast with Scrump on this topic if you want to listen to it, because in it

9
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:24,040
we go over the particulars, but the basic idea is, in 1998, Bill Clinton signed into

10
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:28,280
law the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, intended to provide protections for people

11
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:29,520
under 13 years old.

12
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:33,080
It placed additional responsibilities on websites regarding their dealings with children, it

13
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:36,440
prevented those sites from collecting certain types of data from children, and it regulated

14
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:38,480
the contents of a website's privacy policy.

15
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:42,080
COPPA came about in response to the actions of a website called Kidscom.

16
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:44,920
That's kidscom.com, because boomers.

17
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:49,460
Kidscom was launched in 1995 as a virtual world where users could navigate the earth,

18
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:51,020
play games, and chat with others.

19
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:54,720
It was no Google Maps, but it was probably the best you were going to get back in 95.

20
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:58,040
However, Kidscom did, in fact, collect data from its users.

21
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:02,040
Yes, this garbage was happening back then, too, and COPPA was put forward as a regulatory

22
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:03,040
response.

23
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:05,600
COPPA's had multiple high-profile enforcements before YouTube.

24
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:10,200
The once-big blogging site Zanga, as well as the infamous Bonsai Buddy, both had to

25
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:14,160
pay fines for COPPA violations, regarding their data-harvesting practices.

26
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:18,920
More recently, TikTok got slammed with a $5.7 million dollar fine in February of this year,

27
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:23,080
which they responded to by partitioning the app into TikTok and TikTok Kids.

28
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:24,760
Which brings us to YouTube.

29
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:29,980
Back in September, YouTube was fined $170 million dollars due to widespread COPPA violations

30
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:35,280
on the site, including data collection of minors for use in their targeted ad algorithms.

31
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:39,820
In response, YouTube determined that by January 1st, 2020, all content creators will have

32
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:44,100
to designate whether every single video they've uploaded is kid-friendly or not, by checking

33
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:46,080
a box during the upload process.

34
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:49,480
Content creators can also set their entire channel to be kid-friendly or not in their

35
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:50,480
channel settings.

36
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:54,520
YouTube has already confirmed that in order to be compliant with COPPA, videos marked

37
00:01:54,520 --> 00:02:01,280
as kid-friendly will have no notifications, no comments, will not be searchable on the

38
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:06,700
main YouTube platform, will not be suggested or recommended, and will make 60-90% less

39
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:08,640
revenue due to a lack of targeted ads.

40
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:11,320
All of these features require data collection to implement.

41
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:14,960
And if no data collection is allowed, these videos can't participate in those features.

42
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:18,880
The only feature listed that doesn't necessarily require data collection is the comments.

43
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:22,080
And YouTube has been disabling comments on all videos with kids in them, as a matter

44
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,260
of course, in the name of protecting children.

45
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:27,840
As I mentioned in that Dumping with Scrump earlier, I have a source that I can't reveal

46
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:31,660
who stated that YouTube's long-term plan is to eventually split the platform into YouTube

47
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:36,060
and YouTube Kids, much like TikTok did, where YouTube Kids will contain only those videos

48
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:39,800
marked as kid-friendly, and most people are hoping that that will allow the bulk of YouTube

49
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:42,840
to continue on as over 13-oriented content.

50
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,760
Except it still might not.

51
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:46,240
And here's where we get to the heart of the matter.

52
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:49,680
There's a lot of YouTubers out there who are way bigger than me talking about this

53
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:50,680
issue right now.

54
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:54,120
And I think that most of them don't actually have the situation right.

55
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:58,600
They recognize it serious, yeah, but they don't recognize it as a full-on game changer,

56
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:02,500
but rather just another dumb YouTube event where the platform is made incrementally shittier

57
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:03,500
yet again.

58
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:04,500
But no, this isn't minor.

59
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:05,720
This is a game changer.

60
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:09,800
This is not just rolling your eyes at a false D&CA claim, and then filling out the same

61
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:13,560
meaningless form three times over the course of three months, until the false claimant

62
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:16,760
drops it because no one's actually going to bring you to court over this unless they're

63
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:17,760
retarded.

64
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:18,760
No, no, no, no, no.

65
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:21,440
This is not just another layer of the YouTube bureaucratic nightmare.

66
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,120
This is entirely different.

67
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:26,640
Here's the full text of COPPA, and I'd like to read a few choice bits from it.

68
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:31,160
The regulations issued under the subsection shall A, require that any website directed

69
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:35,840
to children that collects personal information from children provide clear, prominent, understandable

70
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:39,480
notice of the information collection and use practices of the website operator through

71
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:40,480
the website.

72
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:45,000
B, maintain verifiable parental consent for the collection, use, or disclosure of personal

73
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
information for children who are under the age of 13.

74
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,200
And B, require that the commercial website operator concerned establish and maintain

75
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:58,400
reasonable procedures to ensure the confidentiality, security, accuracy, and integrity of personal

76
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,900
information collected from children through the website.

77
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:04,000
And here's what COPPA defines as a website targeted to children.

78
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:09,760
A commercial website that is, one, targeted to children, obviously, two, directed to children

79
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:16,200
by reason of the subject matter, visual content, age of the models, language, characters, tone,

80
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:20,360
message, or any other similar characteristic of the website.

81
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:25,800
Or three, used by a commercial website operator to knowingly collect information from children.

82
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:30,220
The biggest problem here is section two, because that's actually quite vague.

83
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:34,920
But thankfully the FTC has provided a handy dandy guidebook on what exactly qualifies

84
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:37,320
as kid targeted content.

85
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:42,700
The subject matter that is appealing to children, example, kids jokes, music, kids games, video

86
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:49,440
or computer games, children's TV shows or children's TV stars, cartoon characters, sports, stories,

87
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:55,200
toys, children's books, fantasy, children's arts and crafts, pets, products primarily

88
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:59,600
purchased or consumed by kids like snack food or cereal.

89
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,720
You can tell this legislation was made by boomers who don't understand that the primary

90
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:07,480
audience for things like video games, comics, and Marvel movies is no longer kids but 30

91
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,480
year old soy boys.

92
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:11,400
Plus, there's also a lot of adults who are interested in things like sports.

93
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:14,280
There's a lot of adults who eat cereal or snack foods.

94
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:18,080
Just because something appeals to some children doesn't mean that it also doesn't appeal

95
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,800
to some adults.

96
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:22,700
Language of the website, such as language that is simple enough to be understandable

97
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:24,600
to children 12 and under.

98
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,400
Short, colorful descriptions.

99
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,080
Slang and pop culture phrases.

100
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:31,880
Example, a kid's site may be identified by such language as kids only.

101
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:32,880
Fun.

102
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:33,880
Free stuff.

103
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:34,880
Whatever.

104
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:35,880
Cool.

105
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:36,880
Duh.

106
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:37,880
Games.

107
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:38,880
Ask your parents.

108
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:39,880
Etc.

109
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:42,440
You know, they really haven't updated this since Bill Clinton actually signed COPPA into

110
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:43,780
force have they?

111
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:48,520
Whether the website uses visual content appealing to children, animated characters, bold or

112
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:52,280
fast moving graphics, or bright and vibrant colors.

113
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:55,220
These things are not specifically child oriented.

114
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:58,100
These things are meant to catch anyone's eye.

115
00:05:58,100 --> 00:05:59,920
Use of host characters.

116
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:05,600
In a character property, use offline, on television, in movies, or comics or books.

117
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:08,200
This is the absolute dumbing down of everything.

118
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:11,640
If you're recognizable, you're for kids now, I guess.

119
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:13,320
Audio content appealing to children.

120
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:16,200
Example, simple or popular tunes or songs.

121
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,600
Cartoon voices.

122
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,240
Childlike noises and sound effects.

123
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,560
So anything fun.

124
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:21,780
Anything goofy.

125
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:27,480
You guys know that morning zoo style radio shows use the same goofy songs and sound effects

126
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:28,740
as kids shows.

127
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:32,660
And those are absolutely not made for children, right FTC?

128
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:35,080
This is the ultimate problem with COPPA.

129
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:39,240
The FTC is the final arbiter of what will be considered kid targeted content.

130
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:43,060
Of course, you can still mark your videos as for adults, but this is not the same situation

131
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:47,100
as say, marking a video as fair use and working through a claim.

132
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:50,700
YouTube's not the judge this time, nor is there a claimant you can appeal to.

133
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:51,700
This is the FTC.

134
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:53,860
Here's an example of what I mean.

135
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:58,220
Let's say that you have a YouTube channel and you upload a let's play of a Mario game,

136
00:06:58,220 --> 00:07:01,420
and you've got curses and adult jokes in it because you're an adult oriented let's

137
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:04,180
play channel on YouTube even though you're playing Nintendo games.

138
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:07,580
And so you're going to mark this video as adult oriented.

139
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:09,220
You would be insane not to.

140
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:12,720
Choosing it kid oriented would not only be inaccurate, but it would also tank your search

141
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,020
ability and your income.

142
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:17,180
However, the FTC is actually going to examine your video to see if it's kid friendly or

143
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:20,460
not, and if by their determination it's not, they'll fine you.

144
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:24,340
And this is all happening at the same time as YouTube's looking at your videos and changing

145
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:28,620
your manual selection on whether or not it's for kids if they disagree with your assessment.

146
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:33,160
A lot of YouTubers right now are viewing that potential fine part of this discussion a lot

147
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,800
less seriously than they should.

148
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:38,940
I think the general idea everyone has is that it's just a threat, and most people will squeak

149
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:39,940
by undetected.

150
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:41,620
But you know what?

151
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:44,660
I watched the FTC's public Q&A on this topic.

152
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:46,420
No, they confirmed.

153
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:50,940
They will be coming for YouTubers who mislabel their videos by their estimation.

154
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:55,660
Is it safe to say if YouTube is informing channel creators that they need to be COPPA

155
00:07:55,660 --> 00:08:00,700
compliant, they go through the training, moving forward, content creators are more at risk

156
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:04,420
than the actual platform at being fined?

157
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:09,300
Content creators are always at risk of being fined because they're the con- and channel

158
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:15,220
owners because there we have a situation where we have a website or an online service that

159
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:18,820
is directed to children.

160
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:24,100
So there in the general audience platform, we still have this knowledge requirement that

161
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:26,260
we have to prove up.

162
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:34,340
So there is, I think in theory as well as practically speaking, generally a higher risk

163
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:41,120
for channel owners and content creators who after all are creating this content and know

164
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:44,480
intimately whether or not it's directed to children or not.

165
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:47,980
Because if a video is labeled for adults, and the FTC thinks it should be labeled for

166
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:53,180
kids, in their eyes that video will be harvesting data from children, therefore it will be a

167
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:55,060
finable COPPA violation.

168
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:58,060
And to go back to our example, we all know that they're going to see the fact that

169
00:08:58,060 --> 00:09:02,180
it's Mario on screen with an eye-catching thumbnail, it's about video games and it's

170
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:06,220
got bright colors, so it has to be for kids common sense be damned.

171
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:10,700
I don't think they're able to find YouTubers based outside of the US.

172
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:14,740
Foreign Sites is listed as an exception in the COPPA compliance guidebook, and maybe

173
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:19,040
that'll also cover foreign YouTubers, even though YouTube itself is based in the States.

174
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:23,780
And therefore I still have to tag my videos as adult content, even if people like me can't

175
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:26,340
be touched by the FTC because I'm not an American.

176
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:29,500
And there's a very good chance that YouTube is entering into an era where all American

177
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:34,700
content creators need to make explicitly adult content with not even a whiff of color or

178
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:38,980
vibrancy or anything else that might attract the eye of a child or face a stiff fine.

179
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:44,180
The FTC is currently taking public feedback on the upcoming implementation of COPPA as

180
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:48,580
it pertains to YouTube, and they'll be doing so until December 9th, 2019.

181
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:51,460
I'll leave a link in the description if you want to go there and tell them why this

182
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:53,940
is an exceptionally bad idea on their part.

183
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:58,320
I don't usually ask you to do this, you know this, but please consider sharing this

184
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:02,880
video around to everyone you can, along with that feedback link, as well as engaging with

185
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:07,420
this video through likes and comments so that it gets upranked in YouTube's algorithm.

186
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:10,380
People need to see this shit before it's too late.

187
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:12,820
Thank you very much, I love you.

188
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:17,860
There will be consequences for content creators who mis-designate, including being kicked

189
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:20,900
off the YouTube platform.

190
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:30,260
So if content creators are not sincere or forthcoming with YouTube and designating content

191
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:35,360
as being directed to children, there will be consequences for them.

192
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:40,100
We also think that YouTube has strong incentives to police its platform.
