00:00.000 --> 00:02.240
YouTube's had a lot of problems with children, hasn't it?

00:02.240 --> 00:03.240
Elsagate?

00:03.240 --> 00:04.680
The whole child actor thing?

00:04.680 --> 00:07.440
Removing comments and metrics for videos with kids in them?

00:07.440 --> 00:11.280
It's almost like YouTube's an incompetent company that has no idea how to actually run

00:11.280 --> 00:12.280
itself.

00:12.280 --> 00:15.960
But, for once, the COPPA situation is actually not YouTube's fault.

00:15.960 --> 00:19.480
I released a podcast with Scrump on this topic if you want to listen to it, because in it

00:19.480 --> 00:24.040
we go over the particulars, but the basic idea is, in 1998, Bill Clinton signed into

00:24.040 --> 00:28.280
law the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, intended to provide protections for people

00:28.280 --> 00:29.520
under 13 years old.

00:29.520 --> 00:33.080
It placed additional responsibilities on websites regarding their dealings with children, it

00:33.080 --> 00:36.440
prevented those sites from collecting certain types of data from children, and it regulated

00:36.440 --> 00:38.480
the contents of a website's privacy policy.

00:38.480 --> 00:42.080
COPPA came about in response to the actions of a website called Kidscom.

00:42.080 --> 00:44.920
That's kidscom.com, because boomers.

00:44.920 --> 00:49.460
Kidscom was launched in 1995 as a virtual world where users could navigate the earth,

00:49.460 --> 00:51.020
play games, and chat with others.

00:51.020 --> 00:54.720
It was no Google Maps, but it was probably the best you were going to get back in 95.

00:54.720 --> 00:58.040
However, Kidscom did, in fact, collect data from its users.

00:58.040 --> 01:02.040
Yes, this garbage was happening back then, too, and COPPA was put forward as a regulatory

01:02.040 --> 01:03.040
response.

01:03.040 --> 01:05.600
COPPA's had multiple high-profile enforcements before YouTube.

01:05.600 --> 01:10.200
The once-big blogging site Zanga, as well as the infamous Bonsai Buddy, both had to

01:10.200 --> 01:14.160
pay fines for COPPA violations, regarding their data-harvesting practices.

01:14.160 --> 01:18.920
More recently, TikTok got slammed with a $5.7 million dollar fine in February of this year,

01:18.920 --> 01:23.080
which they responded to by partitioning the app into TikTok and TikTok Kids.

01:23.080 --> 01:24.760
Which brings us to YouTube.

01:24.760 --> 01:29.980
Back in September, YouTube was fined $170 million dollars due to widespread COPPA violations

01:29.980 --> 01:35.280
on the site, including data collection of minors for use in their targeted ad algorithms.

01:35.280 --> 01:39.820
In response, YouTube determined that by January 1st, 2020, all content creators will have

01:39.820 --> 01:44.100
to designate whether every single video they've uploaded is kid-friendly or not, by checking

01:44.100 --> 01:46.080
a box during the upload process.

01:46.080 --> 01:49.480
Content creators can also set their entire channel to be kid-friendly or not in their

01:49.480 --> 01:50.480
channel settings.

01:50.480 --> 01:54.520
YouTube has already confirmed that in order to be compliant with COPPA, videos marked

01:54.520 --> 02:01.280
as kid-friendly will have no notifications, no comments, will not be searchable on the

02:01.280 --> 02:06.700
main YouTube platform, will not be suggested or recommended, and will make 60-90% less

02:06.700 --> 02:08.640
revenue due to a lack of targeted ads.

02:08.640 --> 02:11.320
All of these features require data collection to implement.

02:11.320 --> 02:14.960
And if no data collection is allowed, these videos can't participate in those features.

02:14.960 --> 02:18.880
The only feature listed that doesn't necessarily require data collection is the comments.

02:18.880 --> 02:22.080
And YouTube has been disabling comments on all videos with kids in them, as a matter

02:22.080 --> 02:24.260
of course, in the name of protecting children.

02:24.260 --> 02:27.840
As I mentioned in that Dumping with Scrump earlier, I have a source that I can't reveal

02:27.840 --> 02:31.660
who stated that YouTube's long-term plan is to eventually split the platform into YouTube

02:31.660 --> 02:36.060
and YouTube Kids, much like TikTok did, where YouTube Kids will contain only those videos

02:36.060 --> 02:39.800
marked as kid-friendly, and most people are hoping that that will allow the bulk of YouTube

02:39.800 --> 02:42.840
to continue on as over 13-oriented content.

02:42.840 --> 02:44.760
Except it still might not.

02:44.760 --> 02:46.240
And here's where we get to the heart of the matter.

02:46.480 --> 02:49.680
There's a lot of YouTubers out there who are way bigger than me talking about this

02:49.680 --> 02:50.680
issue right now.

02:50.680 --> 02:54.120
And I think that most of them don't actually have the situation right.

02:54.120 --> 02:58.600
They recognize it serious, yeah, but they don't recognize it as a full-on game changer,

02:58.600 --> 03:02.500
but rather just another dumb YouTube event where the platform is made incrementally shittier

03:02.500 --> 03:03.500
yet again.

03:03.500 --> 03:04.500
But no, this isn't minor.

03:04.500 --> 03:05.720
This is a game changer.

03:05.720 --> 03:09.800
This is not just rolling your eyes at a false D&CA claim, and then filling out the same

03:09.800 --> 03:13.560
meaningless form three times over the course of three months, until the false claimant

03:13.560 --> 03:16.760
drops it because no one's actually going to bring you to court over this unless they're

03:16.760 --> 03:17.760
retarded.

03:17.760 --> 03:18.760
No, no, no, no, no.

03:18.760 --> 03:21.440
This is not just another layer of the YouTube bureaucratic nightmare.

03:21.440 --> 03:23.120
This is entirely different.

03:23.120 --> 03:26.640
Here's the full text of COPPA, and I'd like to read a few choice bits from it.

03:26.640 --> 03:31.160
The regulations issued under the subsection shall A, require that any website directed

03:31.160 --> 03:35.840
to children that collects personal information from children provide clear, prominent, understandable

03:35.840 --> 03:39.480
notice of the information collection and use practices of the website operator through

03:39.480 --> 03:40.480
the website.

03:40.480 --> 03:45.000
B, maintain verifiable parental consent for the collection, use, or disclosure of personal

03:45.000 --> 03:48.000
information for children who are under the age of 13.

03:48.000 --> 03:52.200
And B, require that the commercial website operator concerned establish and maintain

03:52.200 --> 03:58.400
reasonable procedures to ensure the confidentiality, security, accuracy, and integrity of personal

03:58.400 --> 04:00.900
information collected from children through the website.

04:00.900 --> 04:04.000
And here's what COPPA defines as a website targeted to children.

04:04.000 --> 04:09.760
A commercial website that is, one, targeted to children, obviously, two, directed to children

04:09.760 --> 04:16.200
by reason of the subject matter, visual content, age of the models, language, characters, tone,

04:16.200 --> 04:20.360
message, or any other similar characteristic of the website.

04:20.360 --> 04:25.800
Or three, used by a commercial website operator to knowingly collect information from children.

04:25.800 --> 04:30.220
The biggest problem here is section two, because that's actually quite vague.

04:30.220 --> 04:34.920
But thankfully the FTC has provided a handy dandy guidebook on what exactly qualifies

04:34.920 --> 04:37.320
as kid targeted content.

04:37.320 --> 04:42.700
The subject matter that is appealing to children, example, kids jokes, music, kids games, video

04:42.700 --> 04:49.440
or computer games, children's TV shows or children's TV stars, cartoon characters, sports, stories,

04:49.440 --> 04:55.200
toys, children's books, fantasy, children's arts and crafts, pets, products primarily

04:55.200 --> 04:59.600
purchased or consumed by kids like snack food or cereal.

04:59.600 --> 05:02.720
You can tell this legislation was made by boomers who don't understand that the primary

05:02.720 --> 05:07.480
audience for things like video games, comics, and Marvel movies is no longer kids but 30

05:07.480 --> 05:08.480
year old soy boys.

05:08.480 --> 05:11.400
Plus, there's also a lot of adults who are interested in things like sports.

05:11.400 --> 05:14.280
There's a lot of adults who eat cereal or snack foods.

05:14.280 --> 05:18.080
Just because something appeals to some children doesn't mean that it also doesn't appeal

05:18.080 --> 05:19.800
to some adults.

05:19.800 --> 05:22.700
Language of the website, such as language that is simple enough to be understandable

05:22.700 --> 05:24.600
to children 12 and under.

05:24.600 --> 05:26.400
Short, colorful descriptions.

05:26.400 --> 05:28.080
Slang and pop culture phrases.

05:28.080 --> 05:31.880
Example, a kid's site may be identified by such language as kids only.

05:31.880 --> 05:32.880
Fun.

05:32.880 --> 05:33.880
Free stuff.

05:33.880 --> 05:34.880
Whatever.

05:34.880 --> 05:35.880
Cool.

05:35.880 --> 05:36.880
Duh.

05:36.880 --> 05:37.880
Games.

05:37.880 --> 05:38.880
Ask your parents.

05:38.880 --> 05:39.880
Etc.

05:39.880 --> 05:42.440
You know, they really haven't updated this since Bill Clinton actually signed COPPA into

05:42.440 --> 05:43.780
force have they?

05:43.780 --> 05:48.520
Whether the website uses visual content appealing to children, animated characters, bold or

05:48.520 --> 05:52.280
fast moving graphics, or bright and vibrant colors.

05:52.280 --> 05:55.220
These things are not specifically child oriented.

05:55.220 --> 05:58.100
These things are meant to catch anyone's eye.

05:58.100 --> 05:59.920
Use of host characters.

05:59.920 --> 06:05.600
In a character property, use offline, on television, in movies, or comics or books.

06:05.600 --> 06:08.200
This is the absolute dumbing down of everything.

06:08.200 --> 06:11.640
If you're recognizable, you're for kids now, I guess.

06:11.640 --> 06:13.320
Audio content appealing to children.

06:13.320 --> 06:16.200
Example, simple or popular tunes or songs.

06:16.200 --> 06:17.600
Cartoon voices.

06:17.600 --> 06:19.240
Childlike noises and sound effects.

06:19.240 --> 06:20.560
So anything fun.

06:20.560 --> 06:21.780
Anything goofy.

06:21.780 --> 06:27.480
You guys know that morning zoo style radio shows use the same goofy songs and sound effects

06:27.480 --> 06:28.740
as kids shows.

06:28.980 --> 06:32.660
And those are absolutely not made for children, right FTC?

06:32.660 --> 06:35.080
This is the ultimate problem with COPPA.

06:35.080 --> 06:39.240
The FTC is the final arbiter of what will be considered kid targeted content.

06:39.240 --> 06:43.060
Of course, you can still mark your videos as for adults, but this is not the same situation

06:43.060 --> 06:47.100
as say, marking a video as fair use and working through a claim.

06:47.100 --> 06:50.700
YouTube's not the judge this time, nor is there a claimant you can appeal to.

06:50.700 --> 06:51.700
This is the FTC.

06:51.700 --> 06:53.860
Here's an example of what I mean.

06:53.860 --> 06:58.220
Let's say that you have a YouTube channel and you upload a let's play of a Mario game,

06:58.220 --> 07:01.420
and you've got curses and adult jokes in it because you're an adult oriented let's

07:01.420 --> 07:04.180
play channel on YouTube even though you're playing Nintendo games.

07:04.180 --> 07:07.580
And so you're going to mark this video as adult oriented.

07:07.580 --> 07:09.220
You would be insane not to.

07:09.220 --> 07:12.720
Choosing it kid oriented would not only be inaccurate, but it would also tank your search

07:12.720 --> 07:14.020
ability and your income.

07:14.020 --> 07:17.180
However, the FTC is actually going to examine your video to see if it's kid friendly or

07:17.180 --> 07:20.460
not, and if by their determination it's not, they'll fine you.

07:20.460 --> 07:24.340
And this is all happening at the same time as YouTube's looking at your videos and changing

07:24.340 --> 07:28.620
your manual selection on whether or not it's for kids if they disagree with your assessment.

07:28.620 --> 07:33.160
A lot of YouTubers right now are viewing that potential fine part of this discussion a lot

07:33.160 --> 07:34.800
less seriously than they should.

07:34.800 --> 07:38.940
I think the general idea everyone has is that it's just a threat, and most people will squeak

07:38.940 --> 07:39.940
by undetected.

07:39.940 --> 07:41.620
But you know what?

07:41.620 --> 07:44.660
I watched the FTC's public Q&A on this topic.

07:44.660 --> 07:46.420
No, they confirmed.

07:46.420 --> 07:50.940
They will be coming for YouTubers who mislabel their videos by their estimation.

07:50.940 --> 07:55.660
Is it safe to say if YouTube is informing channel creators that they need to be COPPA

07:55.660 --> 08:00.700
compliant, they go through the training, moving forward, content creators are more at risk

08:00.700 --> 08:04.420
than the actual platform at being fined?

08:04.420 --> 08:09.300
Content creators are always at risk of being fined because they're the con- and channel

08:09.300 --> 08:15.220
owners because there we have a situation where we have a website or an online service that

08:15.220 --> 08:18.820
is directed to children.

08:18.820 --> 08:24.100
So there in the general audience platform, we still have this knowledge requirement that

08:24.100 --> 08:26.260
we have to prove up.

08:26.260 --> 08:34.340
So there is, I think in theory as well as practically speaking, generally a higher risk

08:34.340 --> 08:41.120
for channel owners and content creators who after all are creating this content and know

08:41.120 --> 08:44.480
intimately whether or not it's directed to children or not.

08:44.480 --> 08:47.980
Because if a video is labeled for adults, and the FTC thinks it should be labeled for

08:47.980 --> 08:53.180
kids, in their eyes that video will be harvesting data from children, therefore it will be a

08:53.180 --> 08:55.060
finable COPPA violation.

08:55.060 --> 08:58.060
And to go back to our example, we all know that they're going to see the fact that

08:58.060 --> 09:02.180
it's Mario on screen with an eye-catching thumbnail, it's about video games and it's

09:02.180 --> 09:06.220
got bright colors, so it has to be for kids common sense be damned.

09:06.220 --> 09:10.700
I don't think they're able to find YouTubers based outside of the US.

09:10.700 --> 09:14.740
Foreign Sites is listed as an exception in the COPPA compliance guidebook, and maybe

09:14.740 --> 09:19.040
that'll also cover foreign YouTubers, even though YouTube itself is based in the States.

09:19.040 --> 09:23.780
And therefore I still have to tag my videos as adult content, even if people like me can't

09:23.780 --> 09:26.340
be touched by the FTC because I'm not an American.

09:26.340 --> 09:29.500
And there's a very good chance that YouTube is entering into an era where all American

09:29.500 --> 09:34.700
content creators need to make explicitly adult content with not even a whiff of color or

09:34.700 --> 09:38.980
vibrancy or anything else that might attract the eye of a child or face a stiff fine.

09:38.980 --> 09:44.180
The FTC is currently taking public feedback on the upcoming implementation of COPPA as

09:44.180 --> 09:48.580
it pertains to YouTube, and they'll be doing so until December 9th, 2019.

09:48.580 --> 09:51.460
I'll leave a link in the description if you want to go there and tell them why this

09:51.460 --> 09:53.940
is an exceptionally bad idea on their part.

09:53.940 --> 09:58.320
I don't usually ask you to do this, you know this, but please consider sharing this

09:58.320 --> 10:02.880
video around to everyone you can, along with that feedback link, as well as engaging with

10:02.880 --> 10:07.420
this video through likes and comments so that it gets upranked in YouTube's algorithm.

10:07.420 --> 10:10.380
People need to see this shit before it's too late.

10:10.380 --> 10:12.820
Thank you very much, I love you.

10:12.820 --> 10:17.860
There will be consequences for content creators who mis-designate, including being kicked

10:17.860 --> 10:20.900
off the YouTube platform.

10:20.900 --> 10:30.260
So if content creators are not sincere or forthcoming with YouTube and designating content

10:30.260 --> 10:35.360
as being directed to children, there will be consequences for them.

10:35.360 --> 10:40.100
We also think that YouTube has strong incentives to police its platform.
