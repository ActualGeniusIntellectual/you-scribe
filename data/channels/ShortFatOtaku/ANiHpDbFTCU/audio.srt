1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Hey guys, this is Dave, duh.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Anyways, this is kind of a big thing for me.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
My friend that I used to work with at a group home,

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
he was a huge Warhammer fan and a big tabletop gaming fan,

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:27,000
and he actually convinced me to invest in a Kickstarter campaign.

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:34,000
It's a game called God Slayer, which is like a skirmishing type tabletop game.

7
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Less units, so it's just a little bit easier to strategize,

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
and I'm not the greatest at strategy games anyway,

9
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
so I said, fuck it, I'm just going to go along with it, I'll give it a shot.

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I was really excited.

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
And I chose one of six factions.

12
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:01,000
There are the Mortons, which are like necromantic Romans.

13
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:07,000
There's the Halodines, which are like a more spiritual Greek culture.

14
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,000
There's the Banebro, which are like chaos sort of deal.

15
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
There's a lot of like mutate and stuff like that,

16
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
and they mutate humans as well as animalistic beings.

17
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:27,000
There's the Troglodytes, which are shadow-aligned troll-based characters.

18
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:36,000
There's the Trollith and shadow trolls and little bastards as well.

19
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Let's see, who else is there?

20
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Oh, the Norgar, which are a combination of other giants or like Vikings and dwarves.

21
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
They're pretty cool.

22
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
They're my second choice, but my first choice was these guys called the Wild Folk of Aenir.

23
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:56,000
They are Celtic-based, kind of very druidic.

24
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:02,000
They've got different units that are like archers.

25
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:07,000
They've got melee fighters as well as druid types.

26
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Later on, they're going to bring in a new faction from that sub-faction.

27
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:16,000
It's going to be more death and decay magic, so that's what drew me in to begin with.

28
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Anyways, it's not my usual style.

29
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I just thought it would be more like the Norgard.

30
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
They're like blunt force sort of deal.

31
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I mean, you've probably seen anything from the way I play games, far from subtle.

32
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,000
But these guys that I ordered are actually much more hit and run,

33
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,000
so it's going to be an entirely new experience for me, and I am pretty jacked.

34
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:42,000
So anyways, I'm going to get started with opening the box.

35
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
All right, so I've got some Caesars.

36
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I'm going to try to do this without causing any real damage here.

37
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Oh god.

38
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:08,000
It's been nearly six months that I've been waiting for this.

39
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
My Kickstarter ended on March 2nd.

40
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:21,000
My buddy is very, very jealous of me right now because he ordered something at the same time as me,

41
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
and he ordered a much bigger package.

42
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Mine cost me about $240.

43
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
His was almost $500.

44
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:37,000
This stuff is not cheap, although apparently, according to other tabletop gamers that are more seasoned than me,

45
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
this is a pretty damn good deal.

46
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Some armies are known to last up to the total of something in the $1,000 range, if not more.

47
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:56,000
So that is quite spectacular.

48
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
$500.

49
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
A little nurse.

50
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Cardboard.

51
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
A bunch of, I'm guessing, oh.

52
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:15,000
That's weird.

53
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:20,000
German newspaper.

54
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
That is freaking funny.

55
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,000
That is so fucking funny.

56
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
So, I see.

57
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Why part of the deal?

58
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I'll try to get this.

59
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Oh, okay. That's much better than I expected.

60
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Bubble that out.

61
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,000
It makes it pop like a little kid sometimes.

62
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Anyways, this deal ended up coming with a couple of things extra.

63
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:02,000
One is this t-shirt that I got, and this is a Felder carrying case for my models.

64
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,000
So this is very exciting.

65
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I'm hoping the shirt is the right size for me, and I'm generally a medium.

66
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Looks good. It's a bit big, but I should be able to shrink it down.

67
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
That's pretty awesome.

68
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I think I might just wear this from now on. Just give me a second. I'm going to change.

69
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Okay.

70
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:32,000
So this is the shirt.

71
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
It's actually very well designed.

72
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:42,000
There's some crappy iron on or whatever that's integrated with the shirt, so I'm just going to press on.

73
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
It's going to be fantastic.

74
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,000
My buddy Brandon and I are going to be wearing these, I'm sure.

75
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:55,000
The guys, I can't really talk about it, but we have an opportunity to help the company at some point.

76
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:00,000
So hopefully we'll be able to go out and show off the game and whatnot.

77
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:08,000
But anyways, let's get down to the rest of it.

78
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:13,000
This feels incredibly heavy.

79
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I don't know what this might do.

80
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Okay, that's not a good start.

81
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:28,000
This may be what... yep, it is.

82
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Every bigger pledge got something like this, which is the map from the game.

83
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I will probably have to spread it out on the floor.

84
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:54,000
It's that big. There's actually two posters worth, which I will be putting up in my room, I'm sure.

85
00:06:54,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Because that is badass.

86
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Sweet fucking Christmas.

87
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:15,000
That is the world of Caledon.

88
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Essentially just one giant mass of land with a few islands interspersed, of course.

89
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:32,000
It's actually on a floating plate amongst a bunch of other floating worlds controlled by the elements.

90
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:37,000
I will probably see, you know, this is...

91
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Actually, I believe, never mind, this is Gorn.

92
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Gorn is this continental thing. Calerin is the whole universe, I believe.

93
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Apparently there's just assloads of lore interspersed in here.

94
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:08,000
It's odd, actually. I was expecting overlap, because these are the same island.

95
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Actually, it doesn't really look like this is matching up.

96
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Okay, there we go. There we go. That looks better.

97
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:34,000
That's the actual... such a huge, huge, huge area that they had printed.

98
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I don't have an overlap, but they even have all the kinds of terrain, geographic features, like godlands.

99
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Looks like floating islands or something. Deserts, water, ice, fey lands, badlands, uncharted.

100
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,000
There's just crazy, lots of detail in here.

101
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:05,000
They got godlands. Yeah, see, they got floating above.

102
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:11,000
As for my guys, I think... oh, they're from here. Near the northwestern part.

103
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:15,000
That's their haunting grounds.

104
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:25,000
So, from now on, I'll be able to actually use this lore from here and plan out wars and battles and scenarios and whatnot against my bitter foes.

105
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:34,000
So, next up is... something very heavy.

106
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:41,000
And the other one is... yes!

107
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:47,000
This would be the book set.

108
00:09:48,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Now, one of these books is, in fact, the rulebook, so everything you need to know to play the damn game.

109
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:05,000
And the background book, all the fluff of the lore. This is what I've been really, really excited for.

110
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:10,000
So, I will most likely be spending the rest of the day reading that.

111
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Hopefully the rulebook, too, but the background book is pretty extensive.

112
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:23,000
I think it's something like 200 pages of lore, so I'll be immersing myself in that motherfucker for a while.

113
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Let's see how this looks.

114
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Now, there's been previews and whatnot of these books all over the place, but I guess I'll get a chance to open this myself.

115
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:44,000
That was a hard cover. That's okay.

116
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Ooh, look at this stuff. The detail, look at that shit.

117
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:56,000
That is a Shadow Troll, I believe, or a... yeah, it's a troll anyway. It's a troglodyte.

118
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:02,000
And these, of course, would be the Dwarfs or the Nordgard.

119
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Just flip through. Yeah.

120
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Oh my god, there's so much stuff in here. There's so much information. Jesus.

121
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:22,000
I had enough of a time reading Greek mythology as a kid, all this stuff.

122
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:28,000
I've always been a huge fan of history and mythology, so I'll be right up my alley.

123
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:38,000
There's artwork everywhere. Oh, they even have the individuals. That's the hallowdimes right there.

124
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Mortons, Nordgard, just every single little tidbit of information that I want to know about something that doesn't exist.

125
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:54,000
I mean, Game of Thrones fans have their encyclopedia as well, so...

126
00:11:54,000 --> 00:12:01,000
No, I'm wrong. I love Game of Thrones as well, but right now, this is worth that.

127
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:06,000
And a rulebook. Let's see, I don't even know. Ooh, okay. That's cool.

128
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Looks like the mortons, which is my guys, the wild folks. See, this guy's got his antler helm and two swords.

129
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:22,000
We drew it off in the background there, so that's pretty jacked. Awesome.

130
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Ooh, look at this. Crazy. Crazy for everything.

131
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Wow. I can even tell you how to make up your composition of your warband. That would be very helpful.

132
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:44,000
All this great stuff.

133
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,000
All these are tactics. I mean...

134
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:57,000
It's no wonder. The forums for this game are just so rife with people talking about the rules and whatnot,

135
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:03,000
and I'm just thinking, fuck, I hate all you guys. I hate you so much because you've already got the book and everything.

136
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:10,000
These are all English and German guys. Or British and German, for the matter.

137
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:18,000
All these backgrounds, whatever. Psychology. Psych.

138
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:23,000
That is hilarious. I love it. I can't believe it.

139
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Let's see. It's just getting morale and whatever going.

140
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:38,000
That guy. That guy I want to play eventually. That guy is, I believe, necromantic style,

141
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:43,000
so I won't be able to use him for a long time. At least not until the second wave is out.

142
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:51,000
God knows when that's going to be, so I'm going to have to content myself with the one that I have in my hands right now.

143
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Anyways, we'll be going through every single, look at it, every single thing.

144
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:02,000
All these different spells and stuff I can put on there.

145
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:07,000
I love the smell of the new book, too. Smells great.

146
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:15,000
I'm getting a little too energetic with this book. I'm trying to rip it open.

147
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Just flipping through. I can't wait to sink my teeth in that.

148
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Wow. Just everything. Every little tiny insignificant detail.

149
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:41,000
I'm watching Lord of the Rings and seeing all the little runes they put in the armor and all that kind of thing.

150
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Some people might think it seems so pointless to use people that really enjoy that sort of thing.

151
00:14:48,000 --> 00:15:01,000
This is bread and butter.

152
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:09,000
For that, I actually got extra. When I get there, I'll definitely pull that sucker up.

153
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Here I believe. I guess not.

154
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Apparently the models are not already in the bag. I don't want to take this out. I don't think they have a really great place to do this.

155
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Okay, here we have our starter box. Deutsch version. What the hell? Okay, good.

156
00:15:51,000 --> 00:16:02,000
I'm going to have a bunch of this. It's going to be a lot smaller than I expected. Lord.

157
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:15,000
I'm really, really hoping that this is going to work. Sorry about the view.

158
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:56,000
These things are absolutely tiny. I was expecting maybe...look at this thing. This is my finger. Here's my pinky next to this thing. That's how fucking small these things are.

159
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:11,000
They're such a tiny little thing, that's a lot of detail. Holy shit.

160
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Very, very small. In order to paint these things, it's going to take a hell of a lot of patience. Something I've found to be lacking in on a lot of things, so hopefully this is going to be a wake-up call.

161
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:37,000
I spent enough goddamn money on these things, but I do not want to waste anything.

162
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:43,000
I have an audience. Look how small these fucking things are.

163
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:55,000
How many did you get? This is... In this giant box? Yeah. Well, it's because I had the case and stuff in there too.

164
00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Yeah, there's one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. Eight in here, plus there's another, like, sixteen in the case.

165
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Yeah.

166
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:25,000
I believe this is my warlord.

167
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Yes, it is. He's lacking all his accoutrements, his antlers and swords and whatnot, but he'll be taking care of soon enough.

168
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:57,000
They're called blade slingers. They have spears that have slings in the end for rocks, so they're a bulk of melee and range units. Range is not very good, but it's good for enticing people into traps.

169
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:18,000
This guy is the bard of Aenir, closely enough. He's carrying a bagpipe so he can make battle songs and slightly buff his units around him.

170
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:30,000
This is claymore, which I'm not too, too big, but apparently he does some pretty good damage. So, apparently that's all.

171
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:53,000
So this is my little army, my warband, so to speak. I'll actually put these guys back in here.

172
00:19:53,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Thankfully, because they come in pieces like this, it's quite easy for them to not be damaged.

173
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:18,000
This comes all the way from Germany, Deutschland. That's cool. We have the jewel, I guess you could say, of the thing.

174
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Very nice. Apparently these guys are really well known for quality, quality, quality cases. Now, that's no hard code, but apparently, yeah, these guys are just rolling out.

175
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:50,000
I'm hoping all my other stuff is in here, because I ordered more than this. This one here will probably be pretty upset.

176
00:20:55,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Holy shit. This is the autumn megalith, and it's really hard to... This thing is fucking heavy. This thing weighs like a pound, at least.

177
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:38,000
It is heavy, goddamn it. Look at that. Yeah, it's insane. Okay, so I got my character cards, and apparently I've also got these action tokens that I will most likely get laminated, because it's easy to lose them, and they don't appear to be incredible.

178
00:21:39,000 --> 00:22:02,000
It's evil. It's not very hardy. They have tactics. These tactics are just, as far as I know, they're just little moves you can use during your activation of the character, so it will give them a little buff or movement or what have you.

179
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:31,000
This guy, I'm not sure where he is. I've got this guy from the Kickstarter, the elevate grove druid, and this thing, the autumn megalith. I don't know how the hell it's really the same little plastic thing, but this thing is, this megalith is a leyline-based magical artifact.

180
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:53,000
It doesn't move, but this guy right here can channel its energies to other heal people in an area of effect, or can use his general magic to shoot bolts and whatever across, and the range is apparently just insane.

181
00:22:54,000 --> 00:23:01,000
A couple feet or something like that. That's on the table, so that is very, very far.

182
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:23,000
I also have, oh yeah, the stormbow beastmen. These are half-ogres. Ogres in this game are actually, well, they are good, so to speak. They interact with humans. They've bred with humans.

183
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:45,000
So they have been used in all these different armies, especially the haladin and wildfolk armies, so they are quite the boon. His defence is very high. His armour is pretty decent too, so you can tell he can take quite a beat, and this guy is a bow hunter. He's an archer.

184
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:59,000
Here we have this. High magic, high defence, high armour. It has all these different abilities. You can draw on that thing. Time vault, that's interesting.

185
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:19,000
You also have these health bars, and some of them you can use for, not this guy, but let's see if I was going to use this guy. He's got a wound bar, and somehow that will affect the health bar even more during a fight, so that is going to be quite an interesting mechanic.

186
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:46,000
More blade slingers, more blade slingers for these guys. This is going to be quite good. I see, now I have some more of these guys. This is a female blade slinger, that's cool.

187
00:24:46,000 --> 00:25:05,000
These guys are pretty decent at introducing strong female characters, so I'm looking forward to it. I might even give all my guys names and whatnot, hopefully not too stereotypically Scottish or Irish, but I'll be definitely hoping to improve on the lore like that.

188
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:22,000
That's very nice. Oh wow, these guys are a stormbow beast on me. They've got some health, and he's also missing a head. He's headless.

189
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:39,000
There's his head. Right to there. Yeah, I don't want to fuck with that guy. He's big, big dude. I believe that's another stormbow beast punch there.

190
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:56,000
More blade slingers. More blade slingers. Another female, that's cool. More blade slingers. There's a lot of blade slingers there, like your main infantry.

191
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:23,000
I think these might be all blade slingers. A ton of these guys to fuck around with. A lot of guys to paint. They kind of have tridents or spears. That's cool. There's nearly every unit or model.

192
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:37,000
There's a difference, because units tend to be just a group of little guys, but they all have individual casts. Here is my ovate grove druid looking up to the sky.

193
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:59,000
Yea, I summoned ye. Badass. Him and his best friend, the ovum megalith. Or monolith. I think it was megalith. These guys are going to cause some serious damage.

194
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:23,000
The mechanic here is you have to cut out individual squares, or what looks like not even squares. Take these out. Keep your guys in there.

195
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:40,000
Not sure if there's anything else. Nope. Wow, that's a lot of perforations there if you can see. Not sure exactly what he's doing for, but I'll figure it out eventually. My buddy there, Brandon, he will definitely fill me in on that shit.

196
00:27:40,000 --> 00:28:03,000
I am completely confused when it comes to this. I'm going to put these bad boys back for now. I've got some other fish to fry.

197
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:38,000
I hope I can get these guys safe enough. Oh, I put that guy there. Ok, new best friend. That is a hell of a lot of foam.

198
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:56,000
What a hell of a lot. Shoot. Ok. Well then, looks like that's all of it.

199
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:24,000
Cool bit of stuff. My t-shirt. Sweet detailed map. The amount of lore that I will be perusing. The starter kit, which initially I thought of just getting that, but I got taught to a much bigger army. And of course my bigger unit and my case, which I will try to close. Anyways, thanks for watching and this is going to be fantastic.
