0	5000	Hey guys, this is Dave, duh.
5000	11000	Anyways, this is kind of a big thing for me.
11000	16000	My friend that I used to work with at a group home,
16000	21000	he was a huge Warhammer fan and a big tabletop gaming fan,
21000	27000	and he actually convinced me to invest in a Kickstarter campaign.
27000	34000	It's a game called God Slayer, which is like a skirmishing type tabletop game.
34000	39000	Less units, so it's just a little bit easier to strategize,
39000	43000	and I'm not the greatest at strategy games anyway,
43000	48000	so I said, fuck it, I'm just going to go along with it, I'll give it a shot.
48000	50000	I was really excited.
50000	55000	And I chose one of six factions.
55000	61000	There are the Mortons, which are like necromantic Romans.
61000	67000	There's the Halodines, which are like a more spiritual Greek culture.
67000	72000	There's the Banebro, which are like chaos sort of deal.
72000	75000	There's a lot of like mutate and stuff like that,
75000	79000	and they mutate humans as well as animalistic beings.
79000	87000	There's the Troglodytes, which are shadow-aligned troll-based characters.
87000	96000	There's the Trollith and shadow trolls and little bastards as well.
96000	98000	Let's see, who else is there?
98000	103000	Oh, the Norgar, which are a combination of other giants or like Vikings and dwarves.
103000	104000	They're pretty cool.
104000	108000	They're my second choice, but my first choice was these guys called the Wild Folk of Aenir.
108000	116000	They are Celtic-based, kind of very druidic.
116000	122000	They've got different units that are like archers.
122000	127000	They've got melee fighters as well as druid types.
127000	130000	Later on, they're going to bring in a new faction from that sub-faction.
130000	136000	It's going to be more death and decay magic, so that's what drew me in to begin with.
136000	138000	Anyways, it's not my usual style.
138000	140000	I just thought it would be more like the Norgard.
140000	143000	They're like blunt force sort of deal.
143000	149000	I mean, you've probably seen anything from the way I play games, far from subtle.
149000	153000	But these guys that I ordered are actually much more hit and run,
153000	157000	so it's going to be an entirely new experience for me, and I am pretty jacked.
157000	162000	So anyways, I'm going to get started with opening the box.
162000	165000	All right, so I've got some Caesars.
165000	174000	I'm going to try to do this without causing any real damage here.
180000	182000	Oh god.
182000	188000	It's been nearly six months that I've been waiting for this.
188000	192000	My Kickstarter ended on March 2nd.
192000	201000	My buddy is very, very jealous of me right now because he ordered something at the same time as me,
201000	204000	and he ordered a much bigger package.
204000	206000	Mine cost me about $240.
206000	209000	His was almost $500.
209000	217000	This stuff is not cheap, although apparently, according to other tabletop gamers that are more seasoned than me,
217000	220000	this is a pretty damn good deal.
220000	229000	Some armies are known to last up to the total of something in the $1,000 range, if not more.
229000	236000	So that is quite spectacular.
236000	239000	$500.
239000	242000	A little nurse.
242000	244000	Cardboard.
244000	248000	A bunch of, I'm guessing, oh.
248000	255000	That's weird.
255000	260000	German newspaper.
260000	262000	That is freaking funny.
262000	266000	That is so fucking funny.
266000	269000	So, I see.
269000	273000	Why part of the deal?
273000	275000	I'll try to get this.
275000	278000	Oh, okay. That's much better than I expected.
278000	280000	Bubble that out.
280000	284000	It makes it pop like a little kid sometimes.
284000	294000	Anyways, this deal ended up coming with a couple of things extra.
294000	302000	One is this t-shirt that I got, and this is a Felder carrying case for my models.
302000	306000	So this is very exciting.
306000	313000	I'm hoping the shirt is the right size for me, and I'm generally a medium.
313000	318000	Looks good. It's a bit big, but I should be able to shrink it down.
318000	320000	That's pretty awesome.
320000	324000	I think I might just wear this from now on. Just give me a second. I'm going to change.
324000	326000	Okay.
326000	332000	So this is the shirt.
332000	335000	It's actually very well designed.
335000	342000	There's some crappy iron on or whatever that's integrated with the shirt, so I'm just going to press on.
342000	344000	It's going to be fantastic.
344000	348000	My buddy Brandon and I are going to be wearing these, I'm sure.
348000	355000	The guys, I can't really talk about it, but we have an opportunity to help the company at some point.
355000	360000	So hopefully we'll be able to go out and show off the game and whatnot.
360000	368000	But anyways, let's get down to the rest of it.
368000	373000	This feels incredibly heavy.
373000	376000	I don't know what this might do.
376000	382000	Okay, that's not a good start.
382000	388000	This may be what... yep, it is.
388000	403000	Every bigger pledge got something like this, which is the map from the game.
403000	407000	I will probably have to spread it out on the floor.
407000	414000	It's that big. There's actually two posters worth, which I will be putting up in my room, I'm sure.
414000	422000	Because that is badass.
422000	427000	Sweet fucking Christmas.
427000	435000	That is the world of Caledon.
435000	442000	Essentially just one giant mass of land with a few islands interspersed, of course.
442000	452000	It's actually on a floating plate amongst a bunch of other floating worlds controlled by the elements.
452000	457000	I will probably see, you know, this is...
457000	460000	Actually, I believe, never mind, this is Gorn.
460000	468000	Gorn is this continental thing. Calerin is the whole universe, I believe.
468000	478000	Apparently there's just assloads of lore interspersed in here.
478000	488000	It's odd, actually. I was expecting overlap, because these are the same island.
488000	499000	Actually, it doesn't really look like this is matching up.
499000	505000	Okay, there we go. There we go. That looks better.
505000	514000	That's the actual... such a huge, huge, huge area that they had printed.
514000	527000	I don't have an overlap, but they even have all the kinds of terrain, geographic features, like godlands.
527000	536000	Looks like floating islands or something. Deserts, water, ice, fey lands, badlands, uncharted.
536000	540000	There's just crazy, lots of detail in here.
540000	545000	They got godlands. Yeah, see, they got floating above.
545000	551000	As for my guys, I think... oh, they're from here. Near the northwestern part.
551000	555000	That's their haunting grounds.
555000	565000	So, from now on, I'll be able to actually use this lore from here and plan out wars and battles and scenarios and whatnot against my bitter foes.
565000	574000	So, next up is... something very heavy.
574000	581000	And the other one is... yes!
581000	587000	This would be the book set.
588000	600000	Now, one of these books is, in fact, the rulebook, so everything you need to know to play the damn game.
600000	605000	And the background book, all the fluff of the lore. This is what I've been really, really excited for.
605000	610000	So, I will most likely be spending the rest of the day reading that.
610000	614000	Hopefully the rulebook, too, but the background book is pretty extensive.
614000	623000	I think it's something like 200 pages of lore, so I'll be immersing myself in that motherfucker for a while.
623000	626000	Let's see how this looks.
626000	635000	Now, there's been previews and whatnot of these books all over the place, but I guess I'll get a chance to open this myself.
635000	644000	That was a hard cover. That's okay.
644000	649000	Ooh, look at this stuff. The detail, look at that shit.
649000	656000	That is a Shadow Troll, I believe, or a... yeah, it's a troll anyway. It's a troglodyte.
656000	662000	And these, of course, would be the Dwarfs or the Nordgard.
662000	667000	Just flip through. Yeah.
667000	673000	Oh my god, there's so much stuff in here. There's so much information. Jesus.
673000	682000	I had enough of a time reading Greek mythology as a kid, all this stuff.
682000	688000	I've always been a huge fan of history and mythology, so I'll be right up my alley.
688000	698000	There's artwork everywhere. Oh, they even have the individuals. That's the hallowdimes right there.
698000	709000	Mortons, Nordgard, just every single little tidbit of information that I want to know about something that doesn't exist.
709000	714000	I mean, Game of Thrones fans have their encyclopedia as well, so...
714000	721000	No, I'm wrong. I love Game of Thrones as well, but right now, this is worth that.
721000	726000	And a rulebook. Let's see, I don't even know. Ooh, okay. That's cool.
726000	736000	Looks like the mortons, which is my guys, the wild folks. See, this guy's got his antler helm and two swords.
736000	742000	We drew it off in the background there, so that's pretty jacked. Awesome.
742000	749000	Ooh, look at this. Crazy. Crazy for everything.
749000	757000	Wow. I can even tell you how to make up your composition of your warband. That would be very helpful.
757000	764000	All this great stuff.
764000	768000	All these are tactics. I mean...
768000	777000	It's no wonder. The forums for this game are just so rife with people talking about the rules and whatnot,
777000	783000	and I'm just thinking, fuck, I hate all you guys. I hate you so much because you've already got the book and everything.
783000	790000	These are all English and German guys. Or British and German, for the matter.
791000	798000	All these backgrounds, whatever. Psychology. Psych.
798000	803000	That is hilarious. I love it. I can't believe it.
803000	809000	Let's see. It's just getting morale and whatever going.
809000	818000	That guy. That guy I want to play eventually. That guy is, I believe, necromantic style,
818000	823000	so I won't be able to use him for a long time. At least not until the second wave is out.
823000	831000	God knows when that's going to be, so I'm going to have to content myself with the one that I have in my hands right now.
831000	837000	Anyways, we'll be going through every single, look at it, every single thing.
837000	842000	All these different spells and stuff I can put on there.
842000	847000	I love the smell of the new book, too. Smells great.
847000	855000	I'm getting a little too energetic with this book. I'm trying to rip it open.
855000	861000	Just flipping through. I can't wait to sink my teeth in that.
861000	873000	Wow. Just everything. Every little tiny insignificant detail.
873000	881000	I'm watching Lord of the Rings and seeing all the little runes they put in the armor and all that kind of thing.
881000	888000	Some people might think it seems so pointless to use people that really enjoy that sort of thing.
888000	901000	This is bread and butter.
901000	909000	For that, I actually got extra. When I get there, I'll definitely pull that sucker up.
909000	913000	Here I believe. I guess not.
913000	936000	Apparently the models are not already in the bag. I don't want to take this out. I don't think they have a really great place to do this.
936000	951000	Okay, here we have our starter box. Deutsch version. What the hell? Okay, good.
951000	962000	I'm going to have a bunch of this. It's going to be a lot smaller than I expected. Lord.
962000	975000	I'm really, really hoping that this is going to work. Sorry about the view.
992000	1016000	These things are absolutely tiny. I was expecting maybe...look at this thing. This is my finger. Here's my pinky next to this thing. That's how fucking small these things are.
1016000	1031000	They're such a tiny little thing, that's a lot of detail. Holy shit.
1031000	1043000	Very, very small. In order to paint these things, it's going to take a hell of a lot of patience. Something I've found to be lacking in on a lot of things, so hopefully this is going to be a wake-up call.
1043000	1057000	I spent enough goddamn money on these things, but I do not want to waste anything.
1057000	1063000	I have an audience. Look how small these fucking things are.
1063000	1075000	How many did you get? This is... In this giant box? Yeah. Well, it's because I had the case and stuff in there too.
1075000	1085000	Yeah, there's one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. Eight in here, plus there's another, like, sixteen in the case.
1085000	1096000	Yeah.
1096000	1105000	I believe this is my warlord.
1105000	1121000	Yes, it is. He's lacking all his accoutrements, his antlers and swords and whatnot, but he'll be taking care of soon enough.
1121000	1137000	They're called blade slingers. They have spears that have slings in the end for rocks, so they're a bulk of melee and range units. Range is not very good, but it's good for enticing people into traps.
1137000	1158000	This guy is the bard of Aenir, closely enough. He's carrying a bagpipe so he can make battle songs and slightly buff his units around him.
1158000	1170000	This is claymore, which I'm not too, too big, but apparently he does some pretty good damage. So, apparently that's all.
1170000	1193000	So this is my little army, my warband, so to speak. I'll actually put these guys back in here.
1193000	1201000	Thankfully, because they come in pieces like this, it's quite easy for them to not be damaged.
1201000	1218000	This comes all the way from Germany, Deutschland. That's cool. We have the jewel, I guess you could say, of the thing.
1219000	1242000	Very nice. Apparently these guys are really well known for quality, quality, quality cases. Now, that's no hard code, but apparently, yeah, these guys are just rolling out.
1243000	1250000	I'm hoping all my other stuff is in here, because I ordered more than this. This one here will probably be pretty upset.
1255000	1269000	Holy shit. This is the autumn megalith, and it's really hard to... This thing is fucking heavy. This thing weighs like a pound, at least.
1269000	1298000	It is heavy, goddamn it. Look at that. Yeah, it's insane. Okay, so I got my character cards, and apparently I've also got these action tokens that I will most likely get laminated, because it's easy to lose them, and they don't appear to be incredible.
1299000	1322000	It's evil. It's not very hardy. They have tactics. These tactics are just, as far as I know, they're just little moves you can use during your activation of the character, so it will give them a little buff or movement or what have you.
1322000	1351000	This guy, I'm not sure where he is. I've got this guy from the Kickstarter, the elevate grove druid, and this thing, the autumn megalith. I don't know how the hell it's really the same little plastic thing, but this thing is, this megalith is a leyline-based magical artifact.
1352000	1373000	It doesn't move, but this guy right here can channel its energies to other heal people in an area of effect, or can use his general magic to shoot bolts and whatever across, and the range is apparently just insane.
1374000	1381000	A couple feet or something like that. That's on the table, so that is very, very far.
1381000	1403000	I also have, oh yeah, the stormbow beastmen. These are half-ogres. Ogres in this game are actually, well, they are good, so to speak. They interact with humans. They've bred with humans.
1403000	1425000	So they have been used in all these different armies, especially the haladin and wildfolk armies, so they are quite the boon. His defence is very high. His armour is pretty decent too, so you can tell he can take quite a beat, and this guy is a bow hunter. He's an archer.
1426000	1439000	Here we have this. High magic, high defence, high armour. It has all these different abilities. You can draw on that thing. Time vault, that's interesting.
1439000	1459000	You also have these health bars, and some of them you can use for, not this guy, but let's see if I was going to use this guy. He's got a wound bar, and somehow that will affect the health bar even more during a fight, so that is going to be quite an interesting mechanic.
1459000	1486000	More blade slingers, more blade slingers for these guys. This is going to be quite good. I see, now I have some more of these guys. This is a female blade slinger, that's cool.
1486000	1505000	These guys are pretty decent at introducing strong female characters, so I'm looking forward to it. I might even give all my guys names and whatnot, hopefully not too stereotypically Scottish or Irish, but I'll be definitely hoping to improve on the lore like that.
1505000	1522000	That's very nice. Oh wow, these guys are a stormbow beast on me. They've got some health, and he's also missing a head. He's headless.
1522000	1539000	There's his head. Right to there. Yeah, I don't want to fuck with that guy. He's big, big dude. I believe that's another stormbow beast punch there.
1539000	1556000	More blade slingers. More blade slingers. Another female, that's cool. More blade slingers. There's a lot of blade slingers there, like your main infantry.
1556000	1583000	I think these might be all blade slingers. A ton of these guys to fuck around with. A lot of guys to paint. They kind of have tridents or spears. That's cool. There's nearly every unit or model.
1583000	1597000	There's a difference, because units tend to be just a group of little guys, but they all have individual casts. Here is my ovate grove druid looking up to the sky.
1597000	1619000	Yea, I summoned ye. Badass. Him and his best friend, the ovum megalith. Or monolith. I think it was megalith. These guys are going to cause some serious damage.
1620000	1643000	The mechanic here is you have to cut out individual squares, or what looks like not even squares. Take these out. Keep your guys in there.
1644000	1660000	Not sure if there's anything else. Nope. Wow, that's a lot of perforations there if you can see. Not sure exactly what he's doing for, but I'll figure it out eventually. My buddy there, Brandon, he will definitely fill me in on that shit.
1660000	1683000	I am completely confused when it comes to this. I'm going to put these bad boys back for now. I've got some other fish to fry.
1690000	1718000	I hope I can get these guys safe enough. Oh, I put that guy there. Ok, new best friend. That is a hell of a lot of foam.
1718000	1736000	What a hell of a lot. Shoot. Ok. Well then, looks like that's all of it.
1736000	1764000	Cool bit of stuff. My t-shirt. Sweet detailed map. The amount of lore that I will be perusing. The starter kit, which initially I thought of just getting that, but I got taught to a much bigger army. And of course my bigger unit and my case, which I will try to close. Anyways, thanks for watching and this is going to be fantastic.
