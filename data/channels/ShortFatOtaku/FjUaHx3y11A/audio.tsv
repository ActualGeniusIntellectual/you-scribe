0	9260	Okay, somebody explain this to me, why the hell does everyone hate Elon Musk?
9260	12260	Like where does Elon Musk derangement syndrome come from?
12260	16900	I know there's a recent kerfuffle about Elon Musk being chosen as Times Person of the Year
16900	20500	for 2021, we'll get into that a little bit later, but this has been going on for quite
20500	21500	a while.
21500	28000	Back in 2018, Aaron Bieber wrote a hit piece on the Daily Beast targeted towards Elon Musk.
28000	30780	What it's like when Elon Musk's Twitter mob comes after you.
30780	35620	When female journalists like me dare to question the SpaceX and Tesla founder as a predictable
35620	38860	result, we get called bitches, idiots, and worse.
38860	39860	Oh no.
39860	44500	Hey, uh, is this you Aaron Bieber saying to Elon Musk that he's pretty much the worst?
44500	49440	Or even earlier saying, you sent a thing to space, it cost a bazillion dollars, you sent
49440	54640	an advertisement, you're gross, why not throw some science instruments up there?
54640	57080	Why not put kid science experiments on it?
57080	61020	Why not use this moment to do some good or further education or anything else?
61020	62180	Not an advertisement.
62180	65820	This is in reference to Elon launching the Tesla car into space.
65820	68820	Now I think that there actually were some instruments on there, wasn't there?
68820	72220	The point being, where do you think those bazillion dollars went?
72220	75860	I mean, they went into the pockets of the engineers and the people who worked on the
75860	76860	project.
76860	81300	And now they're using that money to buy houses or buy cars or buy groceries or investing
81300	82400	or whatever they're doing.
82400	85060	The bazillion dollars hasn't vanished.
85060	86300	It's still in the economy.
86520	90760	But most importantly of all, Aaron, Aaron Bieber, do you think it's this stuff that
90760	96560	might've gotten you some blowback and not just asking Elon Musk questions for your article?
96560	98800	Do you think it might've been because you're an asshole?
98800	104640	Vox also wrote a similar hit piece titled, why is Elon Musk raging at big media?
104640	110120	The article is basically about how, in some people's opinion, Tesla's stock is overvalued
110120	116200	and Tesla cannot possibly hope to produce its products at the rate that they advertise.
116200	121700	And apparently how Elon Musk is raging about it, except there was that huge meme two years
121700	127660	later where Elon said on Twitter, Tesla's stock is too high IMO, the stock subsequently
127660	133540	crashed and these exact same groups of people began screaming because I guess their portfolios
133540	134540	are being wrecked.
134540	135540	I don't fucking know.
135540	142720	It honestly just seems like this inborn hatred of somebody who is simultaneously successful
142720	143900	and charismatic.
143900	149080	You got shit like Elon saying, take the red pill and Ivanka Trump replying with taken
149080	153800	and then Lily Wachowski, one of the creators of the matrix saying, fuck both of you because
153800	157080	we all know where the red pill came from and what it now means.
157080	161520	Also this is a year and a half old, but Lily, it turns out your new movie fucking sucked.
161520	164200	Don't worry, review coming soon.
164200	168800	Around this same time, Elon Musk was fighting with California state government.
168800	172680	This was around the start of the pandemic when the lockdowns for the first time really
172680	176660	hit full swing and California said, you're closing your plant down Elon Musk and he said,
176660	177660	no, I'm not.
177660	181460	On Monday, Elon Musk tweeted that the production had restarted and he would be on the line
181460	182460	with everyone else.
182460	186620	He'd be down there working to putting himself also at risk of arrest and Elon previously
186620	189980	vowed to move the firm's headquarters out of California if the plant was not allowed
189980	190980	to reopen.
190980	193620	He has been vocal about lockdown orders in recent weeks.
193620	195520	This was a year and a half ago.
195520	199060	People saw the writing on the wall a year and a half ago for how bad the lockdowns are
199060	200060	going to get.
200060	203000	A few weeks ago, that has finally come to fruition.
203000	206520	Tesla's move to Texas from California is officially complete.
206520	212160	The gross mismanagement of California as an entity, as a state has been so bad that not
212160	216880	only the leftists who voted all that shit in are running to Texas, so are the entrepreneurs
216880	219020	who build and own companies.
219020	225020	The new business in Texas will create 10,000 jobs, jobs that could have been in California.
225020	230240	But considering the attitude of California state officials towards Elon Musk, I guess
230240	232380	they just didn't want those opportunities.
232380	236820	It does seem that every few months, though, Elon Musk is in the news for some kind of
236820	240040	outrageous statement, which honestly to me just seems like trolling.
240040	243400	Elon Musk tells the SEC to, well, you can work it out.
243400	247240	He tweeted, SEC, three letter acronym, middle word is Elon's.
247240	248840	What do you think it means, guys?
248840	252100	Do you think we need Ted Cruz to come in here and crack the code?
252100	257720	In February of 2021, Elon Musk had a very public feud with Joe Biden, where Biden's
257720	264640	administration demanded that any future colonies that were created by SpaceX employees or technology
264640	268200	would be the property of the United States government, while Elon disagreed.
268200	274240	Back when Elon was on the Joe Rogan podcast, all of these same people, the terminally verified
274240	277640	accounts on Twitter, were again, shrieking bloody murder.
277640	281920	That is part of a larger story about how much they hate Joe Rogan for exposing his audience
282740	283740	to alternative ideas.
283740	289460	But get this, Musk is by most appearances, a dangerously erratic man, dangerously erratic
289460	290460	for being different.
290460	294340	I mean, if you listen to Elon Musk talk for any length of time, you can tell he probably
294340	295980	has something going on mentally.
295980	299660	Maybe he's like a high functioning autist or something, who knows, but he's clearly
299660	301020	neuro atypical.
301020	304600	But I guess instead of inclusivity, we can call him dangerously erratic.
304600	306960	He floats conspiracy theories on Twitter.
306960	310180	He smokes weed on right wing podcasts.
310180	314160	I thought you guys were cool with the drugs in order to slander Elon Musk.
314160	317320	People on the left have had to go against all of their positions.
317320	319800	He also works for the government.
319800	325040	SpaceX makes money by launching satellites into space on behalf of institutional clients,
325040	327080	including NASA and the US Air Force.
327080	330120	Are you suddenly going anti-government in this in this article?
330120	334960	I mean, you just derisively claim that he smokes weed on right wing podcasts, and the
334960	339480	only people who think that smoking weed is still bad is the government.
339480	343700	Elon's a noted anti-communist, which does make it funny just how long his relationship
343700	347540	with Grimes lasted, considering how pro-communist she is.
347540	351740	You can go on Twitter and just find tons of Elon Musk hate, but everything's been ramping
351740	353060	up more recently.
353060	357820	Joe Biden's White House did a big event on electric cars and renewable energy and
357820	358820	all that sort of stuff.
358820	363620	And they didn't invite Tesla, even though Tesla makes up three quarters of all American
363620	364620	electric car sales.
364620	369460	It also seems like Elon's come around to a quasi-Ancap position on the government.
369460	373480	When he said government is the biggest corporation with a monopoly on violence where you have
373480	374800	no recourse.
374800	378400	And though it is not necessarily the case that all governments behave that way, I wouldn't
378400	382580	blame him for thinking this when he looks at the behaviors of the Biden administration.
382580	384320	Here is the most recent kerfuffle.
384320	391160	Elizabeth, I am more native than she is Warren, said, let's change the rigged tax codes
391160	395000	the person of the year will actually pay taxes and stop freeloading off everybody else.
395000	398040	This went viral because Elon Musk directly replied.
398040	402400	If you opened your eyes for two seconds, you will realize I pay more taxes than any
402400	404700	American in history this year.
404700	409220	Elon claims to be paying over $11 billion in taxes this year.
409220	412740	And Forbes has confirmed that that bill is at least $8 billion.
412740	416780	And because he's a troll, he also said, you remind me of when I was a kid and my friend's
416780	419780	angry mom would just randomly yell at everyone for no reason.
419780	422260	Please don't call the manager on me, Senator Karen.
422260	426620	There is a very common idea that Elon Musk, as well as other millionaires and billionaires,
426620	430240	oh, wait, Bernie Sanders is a millionaire now, it's just billionaires, don't pay
430240	432740	their fair share in taxes.
432740	437160	And at least in terms of income taxes, that doesn't seem to be the case.
437160	442480	Of course, most of Elon Musk's income isn't from any kind of salary, but from capital
442480	443480	gains.
443480	446640	Capital gains, by the way, is when you own stock in a company and then that stock value
446640	447640	goes up.
447640	449000	That is technically a gain.
449000	452680	However, the government doesn't tax you on it until you sell the stock because the gains
452680	454080	haven't been realized yet.
454080	456920	The value might have gone up, but it's not liquid cash yet.
456920	458420	It's not actual capital.
458420	461260	So until you sell the stock, you don't get taxed on it.
461260	465740	Now it's becoming a more popular idea on the left to tax people on unrealized capital gains,
465740	466740	which seems to be ridiculous.
466740	469340	And Elon Musk himself explains why.
469340	472220	My so-called wealth is not some deep mystery.
472220	476700	It's simply what is my ownership percentage of SpaceX and Tesla, multiply that by the
476700	477700	valuation, that's my worth.
477700	479820	That's super simple and my taxes are super simple.
479820	486840	I have no offshore accounts, no sort of clever tax evasion or anything like that.
486840	490920	I don't draw a salary or any cash salary or bonus from the companies at all.
490920	497400	So again, I thought that was like morally good to not do that.
497400	503600	And so there was one year, I think 2018, where I didn't pay any tax, but that's because I
503600	505460	didn't have any income.
505460	508160	Unless you sell stock, there are no realized gains.
508160	513860	So then I was like, well, what am I supposed to do?
513860	515740	Why send shares to the government somehow?
515740	519060	I don't know if you can even do that.
519060	525540	So then I was like, well, unless I sell shares, there's no actual mechanism to pay tax.
525540	527260	It just seems to be a dumb idea.
527260	530140	Should you get refunds if your stock value goes down?
530140	534300	I mean, if you have to give the government money because stuff that you own went up in
534300	539400	value in an abstract way without you even selling it to get the value, then surely if
539400	543200	stuff that you own goes down in value that you've already been taxed on, why wouldn't
543200	544200	you get that money back?
544200	548320	See, it's just a completely unworkable situation put forward by people who don't understand
548320	549560	how money works.
549560	554480	The fundamental source of Elon Musk derangement syndrome probably stems from his rejection
554480	556160	of mainstream narratives.
556160	560880	Like work basically wants to make comedy illegal, which is not cool.
560880	562480	We've experienced a little bit of that.
562500	563860	I mean, so Chappelle, like what the-
563860	564860	Flower bed.
564860	567060	I mean, try to shut down Chappelle.
567060	568060	Come on, man.
568060	569060	That's crazy.
569060	578900	So do we want a humorless society that is simply rife with condemnation and hate, basically?
578900	580900	And no forgiveness, right?
580900	581900	Yeah.
581900	592460	At its heart, wokeness is divisive, exclusionary, and hateful.
592460	600760	It basically gives mean people a shield to be mean and cruel, armored in false poetry.
600760	604560	I don't intend for this to come across as just purely Elon Musk simping.
604560	607520	I understand, for example, that he is actually a person of privilege.
607520	611400	I know he likes to portray himself as somebody who has pulled himself up by his bootstraps,
611400	613800	but the truth is his parents were people of means.
613800	614800	They were rich.
614800	615800	They had money.
615800	619040	They could afford him opportunities that other people who may be as gifted as him didn't
619040	620040	have.
620040	622440	So no, he's not a completely self-made man.
622440	623440	Fair enough.
623440	624440	But you know what?
624440	625440	It doesn't have to be.
625440	628760	It doesn't invalidate his success that he had help along the way.
628760	632500	He's highly successful, part of the billionaire class, so the socialists already hate him.
632500	633500	He's a troll.
633500	635100	He doesn't take things too seriously.
635100	636500	He fucks around on the internet.
636500	638200	That makes all the progressives hate him.
638200	643360	Most of them don't like to see a very public example of an eccentric genius who is working
643360	644580	and doing shit.
644580	648860	And I think it's because most of them watched shows like Death Note or Sherlock and viewed
648860	651460	themselves as those eccentric geniuses.
651460	652980	And so they just don't like getting shown up.
652980	654380	Elon's not perfect.
654380	656180	He's a man like everyone else.
656180	657440	He has made mistakes.
657440	658580	He has flaws.
658580	660580	And there are things you can criticize him for.
660580	666340	But the overwhelming hatred coming out of leftoids for this guy at this point just seems
666340	667540	to be sour grapes.
667540	670540	I feel so unqualified to be interviewing you right now.
670540	672540	I think we all do.
672540	673540	Why are we here?
673540	674540	Like what?
674540	675540	I don't know.
675540	676540	You asked for it.
676540	677540	I'm not the one who asked for it.
677540	678540	You said yes.
678540	679540	I'm not the one who asked for the podcast.
679540	685260	Just to be clear, I'm not pushing the podcast on you.
685260	686260	You guys came here.
686260	692780	I'm not like, you know, I'm exactly called a gun to your head for this podcast.
692780	694660	You can be on CNN right now.
694660	698740	You know, the real news organization.
698740	701820	I'm just throwing it out there.
701820	702820	I don't know.
702820	703820	I'm not promoted enough.
703820	704820	Yes.
704820	705700	I don't know.
