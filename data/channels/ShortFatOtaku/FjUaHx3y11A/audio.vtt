00:00.000 --> 00:09.260
Okay, somebody explain this to me, why the hell does everyone hate Elon Musk?

00:09.260 --> 00:12.260
Like where does Elon Musk derangement syndrome come from?

00:12.260 --> 00:16.900
I know there's a recent kerfuffle about Elon Musk being chosen as Times Person of the Year

00:16.900 --> 00:20.500
for 2021, we'll get into that a little bit later, but this has been going on for quite

00:20.500 --> 00:21.500
a while.

00:21.500 --> 00:28.000
Back in 2018, Aaron Bieber wrote a hit piece on the Daily Beast targeted towards Elon Musk.

00:28.000 --> 00:30.780
What it's like when Elon Musk's Twitter mob comes after you.

00:30.780 --> 00:35.620
When female journalists like me dare to question the SpaceX and Tesla founder as a predictable

00:35.620 --> 00:38.860
result, we get called bitches, idiots, and worse.

00:38.860 --> 00:39.860
Oh no.

00:39.860 --> 00:44.500
Hey, uh, is this you Aaron Bieber saying to Elon Musk that he's pretty much the worst?

00:44.500 --> 00:49.440
Or even earlier saying, you sent a thing to space, it cost a bazillion dollars, you sent

00:49.440 --> 00:54.640
an advertisement, you're gross, why not throw some science instruments up there?

00:54.640 --> 00:57.080
Why not put kid science experiments on it?

00:57.080 --> 01:01.020
Why not use this moment to do some good or further education or anything else?

01:01.020 --> 01:02.180
Not an advertisement.

01:02.180 --> 01:05.820
This is in reference to Elon launching the Tesla car into space.

01:05.820 --> 01:08.820
Now I think that there actually were some instruments on there, wasn't there?

01:08.820 --> 01:12.220
The point being, where do you think those bazillion dollars went?

01:12.220 --> 01:15.860
I mean, they went into the pockets of the engineers and the people who worked on the

01:15.860 --> 01:16.860
project.

01:16.860 --> 01:21.300
And now they're using that money to buy houses or buy cars or buy groceries or investing

01:21.300 --> 01:22.400
or whatever they're doing.

01:22.400 --> 01:25.060
The bazillion dollars hasn't vanished.

01:25.060 --> 01:26.300
It's still in the economy.

01:26.520 --> 01:30.760
But most importantly of all, Aaron, Aaron Bieber, do you think it's this stuff that

01:30.760 --> 01:36.560
might've gotten you some blowback and not just asking Elon Musk questions for your article?

01:36.560 --> 01:38.800
Do you think it might've been because you're an asshole?

01:38.800 --> 01:44.640
Vox also wrote a similar hit piece titled, why is Elon Musk raging at big media?

01:44.640 --> 01:50.120
The article is basically about how, in some people's opinion, Tesla's stock is overvalued

01:50.120 --> 01:56.200
and Tesla cannot possibly hope to produce its products at the rate that they advertise.

01:56.200 --> 02:01.700
And apparently how Elon Musk is raging about it, except there was that huge meme two years

02:01.700 --> 02:07.660
later where Elon said on Twitter, Tesla's stock is too high IMO, the stock subsequently

02:07.660 --> 02:13.540
crashed and these exact same groups of people began screaming because I guess their portfolios

02:13.540 --> 02:14.540
are being wrecked.

02:14.540 --> 02:15.540
I don't fucking know.

02:15.540 --> 02:22.720
It honestly just seems like this inborn hatred of somebody who is simultaneously successful

02:22.720 --> 02:23.900
and charismatic.

02:23.900 --> 02:29.080
You got shit like Elon saying, take the red pill and Ivanka Trump replying with taken

02:29.080 --> 02:33.800
and then Lily Wachowski, one of the creators of the matrix saying, fuck both of you because

02:33.800 --> 02:37.080
we all know where the red pill came from and what it now means.

02:37.080 --> 02:41.520
Also this is a year and a half old, but Lily, it turns out your new movie fucking sucked.

02:41.520 --> 02:44.200
Don't worry, review coming soon.

02:44.200 --> 02:48.800
Around this same time, Elon Musk was fighting with California state government.

02:48.800 --> 02:52.680
This was around the start of the pandemic when the lockdowns for the first time really

02:52.680 --> 02:56.660
hit full swing and California said, you're closing your plant down Elon Musk and he said,

02:56.660 --> 02:57.660
no, I'm not.

02:57.660 --> 03:01.460
On Monday, Elon Musk tweeted that the production had restarted and he would be on the line

03:01.460 --> 03:02.460
with everyone else.

03:02.460 --> 03:06.620
He'd be down there working to putting himself also at risk of arrest and Elon previously

03:06.620 --> 03:09.980
vowed to move the firm's headquarters out of California if the plant was not allowed

03:09.980 --> 03:10.980
to reopen.

03:10.980 --> 03:13.620
He has been vocal about lockdown orders in recent weeks.

03:13.620 --> 03:15.520
This was a year and a half ago.

03:15.520 --> 03:19.060
People saw the writing on the wall a year and a half ago for how bad the lockdowns are

03:19.060 --> 03:20.060
going to get.

03:20.060 --> 03:23.000
A few weeks ago, that has finally come to fruition.

03:23.000 --> 03:26.520
Tesla's move to Texas from California is officially complete.

03:26.520 --> 03:32.160
The gross mismanagement of California as an entity, as a state has been so bad that not

03:32.160 --> 03:36.880
only the leftists who voted all that shit in are running to Texas, so are the entrepreneurs

03:36.880 --> 03:39.020
who build and own companies.

03:39.020 --> 03:45.020
The new business in Texas will create 10,000 jobs, jobs that could have been in California.

03:45.020 --> 03:50.240
But considering the attitude of California state officials towards Elon Musk, I guess

03:50.240 --> 03:52.380
they just didn't want those opportunities.

03:52.380 --> 03:56.820
It does seem that every few months, though, Elon Musk is in the news for some kind of

03:56.820 --> 04:00.040
outrageous statement, which honestly to me just seems like trolling.

04:00.040 --> 04:03.400
Elon Musk tells the SEC to, well, you can work it out.

04:03.400 --> 04:07.240
He tweeted, SEC, three letter acronym, middle word is Elon's.

04:07.240 --> 04:08.840
What do you think it means, guys?

04:08.840 --> 04:12.100
Do you think we need Ted Cruz to come in here and crack the code?

04:12.100 --> 04:17.720
In February of 2021, Elon Musk had a very public feud with Joe Biden, where Biden's

04:17.720 --> 04:24.640
administration demanded that any future colonies that were created by SpaceX employees or technology

04:24.640 --> 04:28.200
would be the property of the United States government, while Elon disagreed.

04:28.200 --> 04:34.240
Back when Elon was on the Joe Rogan podcast, all of these same people, the terminally verified

04:34.240 --> 04:37.640
accounts on Twitter, were again, shrieking bloody murder.

04:37.640 --> 04:41.920
That is part of a larger story about how much they hate Joe Rogan for exposing his audience

04:42.740 --> 04:43.740
to alternative ideas.

04:43.740 --> 04:49.460
But get this, Musk is by most appearances, a dangerously erratic man, dangerously erratic

04:49.460 --> 04:50.460
for being different.

04:50.460 --> 04:54.340
I mean, if you listen to Elon Musk talk for any length of time, you can tell he probably

04:54.340 --> 04:55.980
has something going on mentally.

04:55.980 --> 04:59.660
Maybe he's like a high functioning autist or something, who knows, but he's clearly

04:59.660 --> 05:01.020
neuro atypical.

05:01.020 --> 05:04.600
But I guess instead of inclusivity, we can call him dangerously erratic.

05:04.600 --> 05:06.960
He floats conspiracy theories on Twitter.

05:06.960 --> 05:10.180
He smokes weed on right wing podcasts.

05:10.180 --> 05:14.160
I thought you guys were cool with the drugs in order to slander Elon Musk.

05:14.160 --> 05:17.320
People on the left have had to go against all of their positions.

05:17.320 --> 05:19.800
He also works for the government.

05:19.800 --> 05:25.040
SpaceX makes money by launching satellites into space on behalf of institutional clients,

05:25.040 --> 05:27.080
including NASA and the US Air Force.

05:27.080 --> 05:30.120
Are you suddenly going anti-government in this in this article?

05:30.120 --> 05:34.960
I mean, you just derisively claim that he smokes weed on right wing podcasts, and the

05:34.960 --> 05:39.480
only people who think that smoking weed is still bad is the government.

05:39.480 --> 05:43.700
Elon's a noted anti-communist, which does make it funny just how long his relationship

05:43.700 --> 05:47.540
with Grimes lasted, considering how pro-communist she is.

05:47.540 --> 05:51.740
You can go on Twitter and just find tons of Elon Musk hate, but everything's been ramping

05:51.740 --> 05:53.060
up more recently.

05:53.060 --> 05:57.820
Joe Biden's White House did a big event on electric cars and renewable energy and

05:57.820 --> 05:58.820
all that sort of stuff.

05:58.820 --> 06:03.620
And they didn't invite Tesla, even though Tesla makes up three quarters of all American

06:03.620 --> 06:04.620
electric car sales.

06:04.620 --> 06:09.460
It also seems like Elon's come around to a quasi-Ancap position on the government.

06:09.460 --> 06:13.480
When he said government is the biggest corporation with a monopoly on violence where you have

06:13.480 --> 06:14.800
no recourse.

06:14.800 --> 06:18.400
And though it is not necessarily the case that all governments behave that way, I wouldn't

06:18.400 --> 06:22.580
blame him for thinking this when he looks at the behaviors of the Biden administration.

06:22.580 --> 06:24.320
Here is the most recent kerfuffle.

06:24.320 --> 06:31.160
Elizabeth, I am more native than she is Warren, said, let's change the rigged tax codes

06:31.160 --> 06:35.000
the person of the year will actually pay taxes and stop freeloading off everybody else.

06:35.000 --> 06:38.040
This went viral because Elon Musk directly replied.

06:38.040 --> 06:42.400
If you opened your eyes for two seconds, you will realize I pay more taxes than any

06:42.400 --> 06:44.700
American in history this year.

06:44.700 --> 06:49.220
Elon claims to be paying over $11 billion in taxes this year.

06:49.220 --> 06:52.740
And Forbes has confirmed that that bill is at least $8 billion.

06:52.740 --> 06:56.780
And because he's a troll, he also said, you remind me of when I was a kid and my friend's

06:56.780 --> 06:59.780
angry mom would just randomly yell at everyone for no reason.

06:59.780 --> 07:02.260
Please don't call the manager on me, Senator Karen.

07:02.260 --> 07:06.620
There is a very common idea that Elon Musk, as well as other millionaires and billionaires,

07:06.620 --> 07:10.240
oh, wait, Bernie Sanders is a millionaire now, it's just billionaires, don't pay

07:10.240 --> 07:12.740
their fair share in taxes.

07:12.740 --> 07:17.160
And at least in terms of income taxes, that doesn't seem to be the case.

07:17.160 --> 07:22.480
Of course, most of Elon Musk's income isn't from any kind of salary, but from capital

07:22.480 --> 07:23.480
gains.

07:23.480 --> 07:26.640
Capital gains, by the way, is when you own stock in a company and then that stock value

07:26.640 --> 07:27.640
goes up.

07:27.640 --> 07:29.000
That is technically a gain.

07:29.000 --> 07:32.680
However, the government doesn't tax you on it until you sell the stock because the gains

07:32.680 --> 07:34.080
haven't been realized yet.

07:34.080 --> 07:36.920
The value might have gone up, but it's not liquid cash yet.

07:36.920 --> 07:38.420
It's not actual capital.

07:38.420 --> 07:41.260
So until you sell the stock, you don't get taxed on it.

07:41.260 --> 07:45.740
Now it's becoming a more popular idea on the left to tax people on unrealized capital gains,

07:45.740 --> 07:46.740
which seems to be ridiculous.

07:46.740 --> 07:49.340
And Elon Musk himself explains why.

07:49.340 --> 07:52.220
My so-called wealth is not some deep mystery.

07:52.220 --> 07:56.700
It's simply what is my ownership percentage of SpaceX and Tesla, multiply that by the

07:56.700 --> 07:57.700
valuation, that's my worth.

07:57.700 --> 07:59.820
That's super simple and my taxes are super simple.

07:59.820 --> 08:06.840
I have no offshore accounts, no sort of clever tax evasion or anything like that.

08:06.840 --> 08:10.920
I don't draw a salary or any cash salary or bonus from the companies at all.

08:10.920 --> 08:17.400
So again, I thought that was like morally good to not do that.

08:17.400 --> 08:23.600
And so there was one year, I think 2018, where I didn't pay any tax, but that's because I

08:23.600 --> 08:25.460
didn't have any income.

08:25.460 --> 08:28.160
Unless you sell stock, there are no realized gains.

08:28.160 --> 08:33.860
So then I was like, well, what am I supposed to do?

08:33.860 --> 08:35.740
Why send shares to the government somehow?

08:35.740 --> 08:39.060
I don't know if you can even do that.

08:39.060 --> 08:45.540
So then I was like, well, unless I sell shares, there's no actual mechanism to pay tax.

08:45.540 --> 08:47.260
It just seems to be a dumb idea.

08:47.260 --> 08:50.140
Should you get refunds if your stock value goes down?

08:50.140 --> 08:54.300
I mean, if you have to give the government money because stuff that you own went up in

08:54.300 --> 08:59.400
value in an abstract way without you even selling it to get the value, then surely if

08:59.400 --> 09:03.200
stuff that you own goes down in value that you've already been taxed on, why wouldn't

09:03.200 --> 09:04.200
you get that money back?

09:04.200 --> 09:08.320
See, it's just a completely unworkable situation put forward by people who don't understand

09:08.320 --> 09:09.560
how money works.

09:09.560 --> 09:14.480
The fundamental source of Elon Musk derangement syndrome probably stems from his rejection

09:14.480 --> 09:16.160
of mainstream narratives.

09:16.160 --> 09:20.880
Like work basically wants to make comedy illegal, which is not cool.

09:20.880 --> 09:22.480
We've experienced a little bit of that.

09:22.500 --> 09:23.860
I mean, so Chappelle, like what the-

09:23.860 --> 09:24.860
Flower bed.

09:24.860 --> 09:27.060
I mean, try to shut down Chappelle.

09:27.060 --> 09:28.060
Come on, man.

09:28.060 --> 09:29.060
That's crazy.

09:29.060 --> 09:38.900
So do we want a humorless society that is simply rife with condemnation and hate, basically?

09:38.900 --> 09:40.900
And no forgiveness, right?

09:40.900 --> 09:41.900
Yeah.

09:41.900 --> 09:52.460
At its heart, wokeness is divisive, exclusionary, and hateful.

09:52.460 --> 10:00.760
It basically gives mean people a shield to be mean and cruel, armored in false poetry.

10:00.760 --> 10:04.560
I don't intend for this to come across as just purely Elon Musk simping.

10:04.560 --> 10:07.520
I understand, for example, that he is actually a person of privilege.

10:07.520 --> 10:11.400
I know he likes to portray himself as somebody who has pulled himself up by his bootstraps,

10:11.400 --> 10:13.800
but the truth is his parents were people of means.

10:13.800 --> 10:14.800
They were rich.

10:14.800 --> 10:15.800
They had money.

10:15.800 --> 10:19.040
They could afford him opportunities that other people who may be as gifted as him didn't

10:19.040 --> 10:20.040
have.

10:20.040 --> 10:22.440
So no, he's not a completely self-made man.

10:22.440 --> 10:23.440
Fair enough.

10:23.440 --> 10:24.440
But you know what?

10:24.440 --> 10:25.440
It doesn't have to be.

10:25.440 --> 10:28.760
It doesn't invalidate his success that he had help along the way.

10:28.760 --> 10:32.500
He's highly successful, part of the billionaire class, so the socialists already hate him.

10:32.500 --> 10:33.500
He's a troll.

10:33.500 --> 10:35.100
He doesn't take things too seriously.

10:35.100 --> 10:36.500
He fucks around on the internet.

10:36.500 --> 10:38.200
That makes all the progressives hate him.

10:38.200 --> 10:43.360
Most of them don't like to see a very public example of an eccentric genius who is working

10:43.360 --> 10:44.580
and doing shit.

10:44.580 --> 10:48.860
And I think it's because most of them watched shows like Death Note or Sherlock and viewed

10:48.860 --> 10:51.460
themselves as those eccentric geniuses.

10:51.460 --> 10:52.980
And so they just don't like getting shown up.

10:52.980 --> 10:54.380
Elon's not perfect.

10:54.380 --> 10:56.180
He's a man like everyone else.

10:56.180 --> 10:57.440
He has made mistakes.

10:57.440 --> 10:58.580
He has flaws.

10:58.580 --> 11:00.580
And there are things you can criticize him for.

11:00.580 --> 11:06.340
But the overwhelming hatred coming out of leftoids for this guy at this point just seems

11:06.340 --> 11:07.540
to be sour grapes.

11:07.540 --> 11:10.540
I feel so unqualified to be interviewing you right now.

11:10.540 --> 11:12.540
I think we all do.

11:12.540 --> 11:13.540
Why are we here?

11:13.540 --> 11:14.540
Like what?

11:14.540 --> 11:15.540
I don't know.

11:15.540 --> 11:16.540
You asked for it.

11:16.540 --> 11:17.540
I'm not the one who asked for it.

11:17.540 --> 11:18.540
You said yes.

11:18.540 --> 11:19.540
I'm not the one who asked for the podcast.

11:19.540 --> 11:25.260
Just to be clear, I'm not pushing the podcast on you.

11:25.260 --> 11:26.260
You guys came here.

11:26.260 --> 11:32.780
I'm not like, you know, I'm exactly called a gun to your head for this podcast.

11:32.780 --> 11:34.660
You can be on CNN right now.

11:34.660 --> 11:38.740
You know, the real news organization.

11:38.740 --> 11:41.820
I'm just throwing it out there.
