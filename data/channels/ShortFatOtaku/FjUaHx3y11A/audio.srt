1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,260
Okay, somebody explain this to me, why the hell does everyone hate Elon Musk?

2
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:12,260
Like where does Elon Musk derangement syndrome come from?

3
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:16,900
I know there's a recent kerfuffle about Elon Musk being chosen as Times Person of the Year

4
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:20,500
for 2021, we'll get into that a little bit later, but this has been going on for quite

5
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:21,500
a while.

6
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:28,000
Back in 2018, Aaron Bieber wrote a hit piece on the Daily Beast targeted towards Elon Musk.

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,780
What it's like when Elon Musk's Twitter mob comes after you.

8
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:35,620
When female journalists like me dare to question the SpaceX and Tesla founder as a predictable

9
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:38,860
result, we get called bitches, idiots, and worse.

10
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:39,860
Oh no.

11
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:44,500
Hey, uh, is this you Aaron Bieber saying to Elon Musk that he's pretty much the worst?

12
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:49,440
Or even earlier saying, you sent a thing to space, it cost a bazillion dollars, you sent

13
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:54,640
an advertisement, you're gross, why not throw some science instruments up there?

14
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:57,080
Why not put kid science experiments on it?

15
00:00:57,080 --> 00:01:01,020
Why not use this moment to do some good or further education or anything else?

16
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:02,180
Not an advertisement.

17
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:05,820
This is in reference to Elon launching the Tesla car into space.

18
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:08,820
Now I think that there actually were some instruments on there, wasn't there?

19
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:12,220
The point being, where do you think those bazillion dollars went?

20
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:15,860
I mean, they went into the pockets of the engineers and the people who worked on the

21
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:16,860
project.

22
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:21,300
And now they're using that money to buy houses or buy cars or buy groceries or investing

23
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:22,400
or whatever they're doing.

24
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:25,060
The bazillion dollars hasn't vanished.

25
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:26,300
It's still in the economy.

26
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:30,760
But most importantly of all, Aaron, Aaron Bieber, do you think it's this stuff that

27
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:36,560
might've gotten you some blowback and not just asking Elon Musk questions for your article?

28
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,800
Do you think it might've been because you're an asshole?

29
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:44,640
Vox also wrote a similar hit piece titled, why is Elon Musk raging at big media?

30
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:50,120
The article is basically about how, in some people's opinion, Tesla's stock is overvalued

31
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:56,200
and Tesla cannot possibly hope to produce its products at the rate that they advertise.

32
00:01:56,200 --> 00:02:01,700
And apparently how Elon Musk is raging about it, except there was that huge meme two years

33
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:07,660
later where Elon said on Twitter, Tesla's stock is too high IMO, the stock subsequently

34
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:13,540
crashed and these exact same groups of people began screaming because I guess their portfolios

35
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:14,540
are being wrecked.

36
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:15,540
I don't fucking know.

37
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:22,720
It honestly just seems like this inborn hatred of somebody who is simultaneously successful

38
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:23,900
and charismatic.

39
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:29,080
You got shit like Elon saying, take the red pill and Ivanka Trump replying with taken

40
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:33,800
and then Lily Wachowski, one of the creators of the matrix saying, fuck both of you because

41
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:37,080
we all know where the red pill came from and what it now means.

42
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:41,520
Also this is a year and a half old, but Lily, it turns out your new movie fucking sucked.

43
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:44,200
Don't worry, review coming soon.

44
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:48,800
Around this same time, Elon Musk was fighting with California state government.

45
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:52,680
This was around the start of the pandemic when the lockdowns for the first time really

46
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:56,660
hit full swing and California said, you're closing your plant down Elon Musk and he said,

47
00:02:56,660 --> 00:02:57,660
no, I'm not.

48
00:02:57,660 --> 00:03:01,460
On Monday, Elon Musk tweeted that the production had restarted and he would be on the line

49
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:02,460
with everyone else.

50
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:06,620
He'd be down there working to putting himself also at risk of arrest and Elon previously

51
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:09,980
vowed to move the firm's headquarters out of California if the plant was not allowed

52
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:10,980
to reopen.

53
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:13,620
He has been vocal about lockdown orders in recent weeks.

54
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:15,520
This was a year and a half ago.

55
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:19,060
People saw the writing on the wall a year and a half ago for how bad the lockdowns are

56
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:20,060
going to get.

57
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:23,000
A few weeks ago, that has finally come to fruition.

58
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,520
Tesla's move to Texas from California is officially complete.

59
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:32,160
The gross mismanagement of California as an entity, as a state has been so bad that not

60
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:36,880
only the leftists who voted all that shit in are running to Texas, so are the entrepreneurs

61
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:39,020
who build and own companies.

62
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:45,020
The new business in Texas will create 10,000 jobs, jobs that could have been in California.

63
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:50,240
But considering the attitude of California state officials towards Elon Musk, I guess

64
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:52,380
they just didn't want those opportunities.

65
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:56,820
It does seem that every few months, though, Elon Musk is in the news for some kind of

66
00:03:56,820 --> 00:04:00,040
outrageous statement, which honestly to me just seems like trolling.

67
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:03,400
Elon Musk tells the SEC to, well, you can work it out.

68
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:07,240
He tweeted, SEC, three letter acronym, middle word is Elon's.

69
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:08,840
What do you think it means, guys?

70
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:12,100
Do you think we need Ted Cruz to come in here and crack the code?

71
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:17,720
In February of 2021, Elon Musk had a very public feud with Joe Biden, where Biden's

72
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:24,640
administration demanded that any future colonies that were created by SpaceX employees or technology

73
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:28,200
would be the property of the United States government, while Elon disagreed.

74
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:34,240
Back when Elon was on the Joe Rogan podcast, all of these same people, the terminally verified

75
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:37,640
accounts on Twitter, were again, shrieking bloody murder.

76
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:41,920
That is part of a larger story about how much they hate Joe Rogan for exposing his audience

77
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:43,740
to alternative ideas.

78
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:49,460
But get this, Musk is by most appearances, a dangerously erratic man, dangerously erratic

79
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:50,460
for being different.

80
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:54,340
I mean, if you listen to Elon Musk talk for any length of time, you can tell he probably

81
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:55,980
has something going on mentally.

82
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:59,660
Maybe he's like a high functioning autist or something, who knows, but he's clearly

83
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:01,020
neuro atypical.

84
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:04,600
But I guess instead of inclusivity, we can call him dangerously erratic.

85
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,960
He floats conspiracy theories on Twitter.

86
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:10,180
He smokes weed on right wing podcasts.

87
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:14,160
I thought you guys were cool with the drugs in order to slander Elon Musk.

88
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:17,320
People on the left have had to go against all of their positions.

89
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:19,800
He also works for the government.

90
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:25,040
SpaceX makes money by launching satellites into space on behalf of institutional clients,

91
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:27,080
including NASA and the US Air Force.

92
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:30,120
Are you suddenly going anti-government in this in this article?

93
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:34,960
I mean, you just derisively claim that he smokes weed on right wing podcasts, and the

94
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:39,480
only people who think that smoking weed is still bad is the government.

95
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:43,700
Elon's a noted anti-communist, which does make it funny just how long his relationship

96
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:47,540
with Grimes lasted, considering how pro-communist she is.

97
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:51,740
You can go on Twitter and just find tons of Elon Musk hate, but everything's been ramping

98
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:53,060
up more recently.

99
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:57,820
Joe Biden's White House did a big event on electric cars and renewable energy and

100
00:05:57,820 --> 00:05:58,820
all that sort of stuff.

101
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:03,620
And they didn't invite Tesla, even though Tesla makes up three quarters of all American

102
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:04,620
electric car sales.

103
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:09,460
It also seems like Elon's come around to a quasi-Ancap position on the government.

104
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:13,480
When he said government is the biggest corporation with a monopoly on violence where you have

105
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:14,800
no recourse.

106
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:18,400
And though it is not necessarily the case that all governments behave that way, I wouldn't

107
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:22,580
blame him for thinking this when he looks at the behaviors of the Biden administration.

108
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:24,320
Here is the most recent kerfuffle.

109
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:31,160
Elizabeth, I am more native than she is Warren, said, let's change the rigged tax codes

110
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:35,000
the person of the year will actually pay taxes and stop freeloading off everybody else.

111
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,040
This went viral because Elon Musk directly replied.

112
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:42,400
If you opened your eyes for two seconds, you will realize I pay more taxes than any

113
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,700
American in history this year.

114
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:49,220
Elon claims to be paying over $11 billion in taxes this year.

115
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:52,740
And Forbes has confirmed that that bill is at least $8 billion.

116
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:56,780
And because he's a troll, he also said, you remind me of when I was a kid and my friend's

117
00:06:56,780 --> 00:06:59,780
angry mom would just randomly yell at everyone for no reason.

118
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:02,260
Please don't call the manager on me, Senator Karen.

119
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:06,620
There is a very common idea that Elon Musk, as well as other millionaires and billionaires,

120
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:10,240
oh, wait, Bernie Sanders is a millionaire now, it's just billionaires, don't pay

121
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,740
their fair share in taxes.

122
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:17,160
And at least in terms of income taxes, that doesn't seem to be the case.

123
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:22,480
Of course, most of Elon Musk's income isn't from any kind of salary, but from capital

124
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23,480
gains.

125
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:26,640
Capital gains, by the way, is when you own stock in a company and then that stock value

126
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:27,640
goes up.

127
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:29,000
That is technically a gain.

128
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,680
However, the government doesn't tax you on it until you sell the stock because the gains

129
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:34,080
haven't been realized yet.

130
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,920
The value might have gone up, but it's not liquid cash yet.

131
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,420
It's not actual capital.

132
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:41,260
So until you sell the stock, you don't get taxed on it.

133
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:45,740
Now it's becoming a more popular idea on the left to tax people on unrealized capital gains,

134
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:46,740
which seems to be ridiculous.

135
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:49,340
And Elon Musk himself explains why.

136
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:52,220
My so-called wealth is not some deep mystery.

137
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:56,700
It's simply what is my ownership percentage of SpaceX and Tesla, multiply that by the

138
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:57,700
valuation, that's my worth.

139
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:59,820
That's super simple and my taxes are super simple.

140
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:06,840
I have no offshore accounts, no sort of clever tax evasion or anything like that.

141
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:10,920
I don't draw a salary or any cash salary or bonus from the companies at all.

142
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:17,400
So again, I thought that was like morally good to not do that.

143
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:23,600
And so there was one year, I think 2018, where I didn't pay any tax, but that's because I

144
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,460
didn't have any income.

145
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:28,160
Unless you sell stock, there are no realized gains.

146
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:33,860
So then I was like, well, what am I supposed to do?

147
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:35,740
Why send shares to the government somehow?

148
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:39,060
I don't know if you can even do that.

149
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:45,540
So then I was like, well, unless I sell shares, there's no actual mechanism to pay tax.

150
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:47,260
It just seems to be a dumb idea.

151
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:50,140
Should you get refunds if your stock value goes down?

152
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:54,300
I mean, if you have to give the government money because stuff that you own went up in

153
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:59,400
value in an abstract way without you even selling it to get the value, then surely if

154
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:03,200
stuff that you own goes down in value that you've already been taxed on, why wouldn't

155
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,200
you get that money back?

156
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:08,320
See, it's just a completely unworkable situation put forward by people who don't understand

157
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,560
how money works.

158
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:14,480
The fundamental source of Elon Musk derangement syndrome probably stems from his rejection

159
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,160
of mainstream narratives.

160
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:20,880
Like work basically wants to make comedy illegal, which is not cool.

161
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,480
We've experienced a little bit of that.

162
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:23,860
I mean, so Chappelle, like what the-

163
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:24,860
Flower bed.

164
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:27,060
I mean, try to shut down Chappelle.

165
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:28,060
Come on, man.

166
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:29,060
That's crazy.

167
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:38,900
So do we want a humorless society that is simply rife with condemnation and hate, basically?

168
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:40,900
And no forgiveness, right?

169
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:41,900
Yeah.

170
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:52,460
At its heart, wokeness is divisive, exclusionary, and hateful.

171
00:09:52,460 --> 00:10:00,760
It basically gives mean people a shield to be mean and cruel, armored in false poetry.

172
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:04,560
I don't intend for this to come across as just purely Elon Musk simping.

173
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:07,520
I understand, for example, that he is actually a person of privilege.

174
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:11,400
I know he likes to portray himself as somebody who has pulled himself up by his bootstraps,

175
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:13,800
but the truth is his parents were people of means.

176
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:14,800
They were rich.

177
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:15,800
They had money.

178
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:19,040
They could afford him opportunities that other people who may be as gifted as him didn't

179
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,040
have.

180
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:22,440
So no, he's not a completely self-made man.

181
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:23,440
Fair enough.

182
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:24,440
But you know what?

183
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:25,440
It doesn't have to be.

184
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:28,760
It doesn't invalidate his success that he had help along the way.

185
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:32,500
He's highly successful, part of the billionaire class, so the socialists already hate him.

186
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:33,500
He's a troll.

187
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:35,100
He doesn't take things too seriously.

188
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:36,500
He fucks around on the internet.

189
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:38,200
That makes all the progressives hate him.

190
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:43,360
Most of them don't like to see a very public example of an eccentric genius who is working

191
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,580
and doing shit.

192
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:48,860
And I think it's because most of them watched shows like Death Note or Sherlock and viewed

193
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:51,460
themselves as those eccentric geniuses.

194
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:52,980
And so they just don't like getting shown up.

195
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:54,380
Elon's not perfect.

196
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:56,180
He's a man like everyone else.

197
00:10:56,180 --> 00:10:57,440
He has made mistakes.

198
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,580
He has flaws.

199
00:10:58,580 --> 00:11:00,580
And there are things you can criticize him for.

200
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:06,340
But the overwhelming hatred coming out of leftoids for this guy at this point just seems

201
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:07,540
to be sour grapes.

202
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:10,540
I feel so unqualified to be interviewing you right now.

203
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:12,540
I think we all do.

204
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:13,540
Why are we here?

205
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:14,540
Like what?

206
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:15,540
I don't know.

207
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:16,540
You asked for it.

208
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:17,540
I'm not the one who asked for it.

209
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:18,540
You said yes.

210
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:19,540
I'm not the one who asked for the podcast.

211
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:25,260
Just to be clear, I'm not pushing the podcast on you.

212
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:26,260
You guys came here.

213
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:32,780
I'm not like, you know, I'm exactly called a gun to your head for this podcast.

214
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:34,660
You can be on CNN right now.

215
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:38,740
You know, the real news organization.

216
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:41,820
I'm just throwing it out there.

217
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:42,820
I don't know.

218
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:43,820
I'm not promoted enough.

219
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:44,820
Yes.

220
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:45,700
I don't know.
