0	9800	At this point, I've done two videos on r slash anti-work, the subreddit that began
9800	13740	as catharsis for wages who really just wanted to stick it to their boss, but was rapidly
13740	16400	subverted and became all about overt communism.
16400	20280	The most recent video was centered on the now former admin of the sub, since he had
20280	22500	quite a few skeletons in his closet.
22500	26360	But the first video was all about how there actually wasn't anything anti-capitalist
26360	28440	about the content of r slash anti-work.
28440	30680	It was, in fact, capitalism working as intended.
30680	34040	Just as an example of what I mean, check out this recent post.
34040	35040	It's a free market.
35040	38200	I get to decide who buys my product, my product being my labor.
38200	39940	My labor goes to the highest bidder.
39940	40940	Want my labor?
40940	41940	Outbid the next guy.
41940	43260	Millennials aren't job hopping.
43260	46440	You were either too poor or too cheap to pay for their labor.
46440	48900	This is actually a completely reasonable statement.
48900	51920	The comments are talking about how this is sticking it to the man, or doing praxis or
51920	52920	whatever.
52920	54320	But this is actually how it should be.
54320	58000	For example, when conservatives talk about limiting immigration in order to reduce the
58040	63540	supply of labor, forcing employers into bidding wars over the labor pool, this is explicitly
63540	64620	what they're talking about.
64620	67100	This isn't some leftist subversion of capitalism.
67100	69260	This is actually what conservatives want.
69260	72520	That's the entirety of r slash anti-work's quality posts.
72520	75020	The ones that are not openly about socialist theory.
75020	79040	People mistaking properly engaging in a market for anti-capitalism.
79040	83520	r slash anti-work blew up during an event called the Great Resignation.
83520	86800	After the economic effects of COVID lockdowns began to really make themselves felt, your
86800	88960	average person realized a few key things.
88960	92720	One, COVID benefits paid way more than having an entry-level job.
92720	97320	Two, despite lockdowns massively slowing down immigration and the resulting labor shortage,
97320	100520	jobs still weren't offering any more benefits or pay to compete.
100520	104860	Three, the combination of one and two heavily contribute to the inflation crisis.
104860	107360	The question was then asked by a lot of normies.
107360	108360	Why work at all?
108360	111480	If your job sucks and you're not getting paid what you're worth, and your boss refuses
111480	115320	to renegotiate with you, and Biden's got the money printers revved up to maximum, what
115320	117040	the hell is the incentive to keep your job?
117040	121140	I mean we all know at the macro level the long-term incentive is that you can't mindlessly
121140	124380	endlessly print your way of an economic crisis, which is something that we just might have
124380	126340	to learn for ourselves first hand.
126340	130540	But that doesn't motivate people to make choices when short-term economically rational
130540	132680	options are staring them in the face.
132680	136460	Plus over the course of lockdowns people got used to working from home and once jobs started
136460	139900	calling workers back into the office everybody began to question the practice.
139900	141720	I can see both sides of this one frankly.
141720	145240	On the one hand going into work sucks, especially if your co-workers suck or the dress code
145280	146780	sucks, or the location sucks.
146780	149980	If you got to put on a suit and tie to go into a cubicle and do the same office work
149980	153740	you can do at home, only you're less productive and you're stuck there for eight hours without
153740	156360	any privacy and having to interact with people that you don't like, working out of your
156360	157360	house sounds pretty good.
157360	158400	Who would want to go back?
158400	159400	Not me.
159400	162880	But on the other hand, the automization of the most basic functions of life really kicked
162880	164280	into high gear during COVID.
164280	166920	You need housewares or electronics or even clothing?
166920	167920	Buy it from Amazon.
167920	168920	Need groceries?
168920	169920	Instacart it.
169920	170920	Want to order food?
170920	171920	Use Grubhub.
171920	172920	All while you work from home.
172920	174020	It's a neat paradise out there right now.
174020	175500	You never have to leave your house again.
175500	178980	And while that's comfy for a little while, it's got to be psychologically damaging
178980	183180	to do it long term, to just never go outside or engage with the community ever again.
183180	185400	It's out of all of this that we got quiet quitting.
185400	189060	The term quiet quitting is older than this current series of events, but was first thrust
189060	193400	into the modern limelight when this TikTok video was posted on r slash anti work and
193400	194740	subsequently went viral.
194740	198580	I recently learned about this term called quiet quitting, where you're not outright
198580	201860	quitting your job, but you're quitting the idea of going above and beyond.
201860	204860	You're still performing your duties, but you're no longer subscribing to the hustle
204860	207500	culture mentality that work has to be your life.
207500	212420	The reality is it's not and your worth as a person is not defined by your labor.
212420	215620	This has actually been around for over 50 years, but under a different name work to
215620	219680	rule, meaning literally work to the rules of your contract or workplace and not one
219680	220680	bit more.
220680	225100	The idea is some employers don't understand or value the little extra bits of unpaid labor
225100	228280	they get from their employees who do it simply out of convenience.
228280	231840	Like if you check your work email after hours, or if you punch out and then go quickly for
231840	234760	you to finish up a job before going home, or if you do a quick little thing during your
234760	235760	break.
235760	239400	And if an entire workforce adheres to their rights under contract strictly, not giving
239400	243920	up even one little drop of unpaid labor, the resulting slowdown of productivity at the
243920	248080	company is enough to make management notice while simultaneously breaking no rules or
248080	249080	laws.
249080	252840	To refer back to Reddit again, it's basically just r slash malicious compliance.
252840	256320	And people are eating this shit up, like Zoomers have found something amazing and new.
256320	260280	Oh my god guys, what if we just did the bare minimum in our jobs in order to not get fired,
260280	262160	and then used our extra time and energy on ourselves?
262160	264720	Yeah, people have been doing that since before you were even born.
264720	268640	However, a lot of the tech talks on the topic seem to not really understand the basics,
268640	269640	like this one.
269640	272380	Hey Bob, for the next month or two, I'm gonna need you to come in an hour or two early and
272380	276120	stay a couple hours behind, a little short staffed and all hands on deck.
276120	277320	Oh, sure thing.
277320	280280	Are you gonna double my pay for the extra hours I'm working?
280280	283200	Bob, we pay you a $40,000 a year salary.
283200	285340	Of course we're not gonna give you overtime.
285340	289440	Think of it as a learning experience and giving the company an extra helping hand.
289440	292760	Okay, does this learning experience pay my bills?
292760	295560	Or better yet, does it pick up my kids from daycare?
295560	299520	No, but there is a performance review next month.
299520	300520	What?
300520	302520	So that I can get a 5% pay bump versus 3%?
302520	303680	Yeah, I'm all set.
303680	304680	I'm gonna quiet quit.
304680	306120	I'm gonna quiet what?
306120	307120	Quiet quitting.
307120	309600	I'm gonna come in during my normal working hours next week and do my job.
309600	311680	If you need me to do more, you can pay me more.
311680	313680	Otherwise, I'm all set, thanks.
313680	317920	Asking what's my overtime pay is a reasonable question if you're paid by the hour.
317920	321280	Generally speaking, the upside of an hourly position is that your time is measured strictly
321280	322400	and paid for strictly.
322400	323980	You go overtime, you get overtime.
323980	326840	The trade-off is that you generally lack flexibility in your shifts.
326840	328080	You work when they need you.
328080	331240	But a salaried position isn't paid by the hour, it's paid by the job.
331240	333180	The downside to this system is that there's no overtime.
333180	335620	You put in as many hours as it takes to get the job done.
335620	338860	But the upside is that, generally, hours are far more flexible.
338860	342200	If you need to leave early to bring your kid to the doctors or go on a family trip or whatever,
342200	343200	that's fine.
343200	346000	Just get your work done early or call in a favor from a coworker and the time off is
346000	347000	no problem.
347000	348000	That's the balance.
348000	350500	Hourly positions with overtime but little flexibility.
350500	353000	Salaried positions with no overtime but lots of flexibility.
353000	356940	Historically, hourly positions are more likely to be blue collar and unionized, while salaried
356940	359400	positions are more likely to be white collar and middle management.
359400	363080	The reason for this divide is because, generally, hourly positions at the bottom of the hierarchy
363080	367200	are more physically demanding, more at risk due to the lower amount of education required,
367200	371700	and also most likely to be exploited by management, while the salaried positions at the top provide
371700	375420	more connections in the industry, more opportunities for advancement, and more job security.
375420	379460	The quiet quitters on TikTok are treating a salaried position like it's an hourly one.
379460	380460	And hey, man, that's fine.
380460	381460	You do you.
381460	382460	Like, listen to this chick.
382460	386360	Here's my take on the whole quiet quitting conversation that's going on right now.
386360	392540	Quiet quitting is doing the bare minimum at work and not going 110% above and beyond expectations.
392540	396540	And it's being defined as leaving work on time, not checking your emails outside of
396540	401660	work hours, and not subscribing to hustle culture, which, isn't that what a job should
401660	402660	be already?
402660	406100	It's one of those narratives that paints the employee as the villain.
406100	411220	When the symptoms of quiet quitting, like being disengaged from work, not being motivated,
411220	415060	being disconnected from the values and the missions of the company, are mostly things
415060	419460	that the company needs to solve and address, bottom line is that people just want to detach
419460	421620	their identities from their working life.
421620	425580	It's got to be a two-way street from the employer as well, because employees want to
425580	428220	feel supported in their role and in their life.
428220	429380	This is all reasonable to me.
429380	430460	I'm not a Marxist here.
430460	433460	I don't believe in a lasting, permanent connection between people that grants you
433460	436820	a stake in their behavior due to simple economic interactions.
436820	440460	But I promise you, if you behave like this in a salaried job, when it comes time for
440460	443900	somebody to get promoted, you'll be the one passed up for advancement, in favor of
443900	446180	somebody else who didn't quiet quit.
446180	450340	In an hourly position, especially if it's unionized, promotions come solely by seniority.
450340	452980	If you've got the most hours, that means you're the next in line for the promotion.
452980	455720	That system has its own problems, because there's no guarantee that the person with
455720	457260	the most hours is the most qualified.
457260	459160	They might just be the last hanger on.
459160	463000	For example, the current manager at my last wagey job, the one that I quit to do YouTube
463000	467500	full time, is only the manager because everybody else recognized the job as transitory and
467500	470920	used it as a stepping stone to build some quick cash and then get out.
470920	474360	She's a meth addict who was the least capable of all of us, and her promotions serve as
474360	478280	a confirmant, because people who are actually capable end up moving on instead of moving
478280	479280	up.
479280	482320	But in a salaried position, if you're putting in the bare minimum while your coworker is
482320	484440	going above and beyond, you're not getting the promotion.
484440	485440	It's as simple as that.
485440	489080	Now, if you're okay with that, if you don't want promotions, if you want to just stay
489080	492860	where you are and not advance in your career, then quiet quitting is exactly what you should
492860	493860	do.
493860	496160	If they want you to do more than what you were hired to do, they should pay you.
496160	497660	If they're not going to pay you, you shouldn't do it.
497660	501200	I guess what these people are missing is, they actually are paying you.
501200	504880	They're paying you in promotions, networking, opportunities, all of which do lead to more
504880	505940	money down the road.
505940	508520	But it's completely reasonable not to want those things too.
508520	511340	I wouldn't want to get paid in Wendy's gift cards, even though it's still money
511340	512560	I could spend at Wendy's.
512560	516160	If they're not compensating you in your preferred currency, dollars over career advancement
516160	518980	in this case, then that pay is a lot less valuable to you.
518980	522020	Of course, a lot of the discourse around this topic isn't exactly intelligent.
522020	523020	Okay, let's see.
523020	524020	Goal for today.
524020	525020	500 calls.
525020	526020	We're doing 50.
526020	527020	We're doing 50.
527020	530820	She did not say that.
530820	531820	She did not.
531820	532820	I'm dying.
532820	533820	I'm happy to help.
533820	534820	Have a great day.
534820	535820	Okay.
535820	536820	Bye.
536820	542300	Jesus Christ, if I work with this lady, I would love it if she would actually quit.
542300	544860	Also, she swings a bit too far in the other direction, you know?
544860	546780	It's Maple Muffin Monday, everyone.
546780	548720	Let's go to the break room.
548720	551440	We watched last week's episode of The Bachelorette.
551440	554240	Yeah, good drama, right?
554240	558000	Quiet quitting is doing your job, not not doing it while on the clock.
558000	559740	That's something you should actually be disciplined for.
559740	564200	But there's always one nugget of truth inside even the most annoying of TikTok videos.
564200	566240	She mentions the phrase acting your wage.
566240	569600	Hey, Veronica, you have till end of day to finish all this extra work.
569600	574400	Respectfully, Susan, it's 2022, we're acting our wage, so don't give me extra work.
574400	575400	Okay?
575400	576400	Thank you.
576400	577400	Thank you.
577400	580720	This idea of acting your age, a saying that I'm sure we all heard growing up, acting your
580720	584240	wage is basically the same thing as quiet quitting and working to rule.
584240	585980	It's the idea that you do what you're paid for.
585980	586980	And fair enough.
586980	588760	But we can also flip this on its head.
588760	591140	If you want a higher wage, you got to act like it too.
591140	594800	This idea is best seen as something like commission work, where the more you do, the more you
594800	595800	get paid.
595800	599040	And that job, whether it's high pay or low pay, you're always acting your wage.
599040	602640	On the weekly sip a little while ago, I read an article describing Ontario's provincial
602640	605000	government enshrining a right to disconnect.
605000	608680	What this basically means is that your employer cannot punish you for not doing anything work
608680	610020	related on your off hours.
610020	614080	We're talking small stuff like answering emails, unless you are being paid to be on call.
614080	618860	As I've mentioned in both this video and a dozen others, Marx's critique of liberalism
618860	621520	stems from the liberal's right of disconnection.
621520	624880	You must be on call at all times, even if we don't pay you.
624880	627000	Sounds like it's an exploitative capitalist wet dream.
627000	630220	I'm sure it is, but it's not strictly a capitalist thing.
630220	634200	We saw, for example, during the early stages of COVID in China, doctors and nurses were
634200	638880	forced to work under the threat of state retaliation every waking hour of every day
638880	642720	because the society, the people, the collective had a right to their labor.
642720	646800	Ontario's law came from conservatives, and progressives here haven't spoken a word about
646800	647800	it.
647800	650920	Socialists only view the quiet quitting stuff, the acting your wage stuff, as a win because
650920	652280	they're not in power.
652280	653840	If they were, it wouldn't be tolerated.
653840	656440	Because if you don't labor, you're stealing from the workers, comrade.
656440	660240	This is the main reason why the individualist perspective is the solution to all of this.
660240	662840	When I work on my YouTube channel, yes, it's YouTube who pays me.
662840	665460	And yes, they benefit from my work, but I don't do it for them.
665460	668360	I don't really care about them as a company, especially after the copyright bullshit I
668360	669420	had to deal with recently.
669420	670480	I do it for me.
670480	672560	When I work harder, I'm the one who benefits.
672560	674160	YouTube benefits too, but I don't really care.
674160	675360	I care about me.
675360	679360	The quiet quitting mentality applies if you will literally get nothing for going above
679360	680360	and beyond.
680360	682200	No overtime pay, no career advancement, nothing.
682200	685800	At that point, the only thing left to get is the pride of knowing that you went above
685800	687960	and beyond and that your name is attached to the excellence.
687960	691320	That's good, sure, but I wouldn't blame people for not doing a thing if that's the
691320	692320	only reward.
692800	696560	However, if there actually is a reward for going above and beyond and you decide to quiet
696560	698760	quit, that's your choice, but you're kind of a loser.
698760	701480	I mean, at least you're getting out of the way of people who actually want to move forward
701480	702480	with things.
702480	703480	That's a plus.
703480	704480	But you're purposely gimping your career.
704480	707360	Again, if you don't value your career and want to spend time with your friends or whatever,
707360	708360	that's your choice.
708360	711400	But 30 years down the line, when the other guy has blown up and you're still at the
711400	713720	bottom of the totem pole, you have only yourself to blame.
713720	716760	But at the very least, within a liberal system, you have that choice.
716760	719260	You have the choice to be mediocre if that's what you really want.
719300	723300	Every socialist society points guns at the workers and demands that they work towards
723300	727300	the socialist utopia because if the working class collectively owns their labor, then
