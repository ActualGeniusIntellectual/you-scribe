WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:09.800
At this point, I've done two videos on r slash anti-work, the subreddit that began

00:09.800 --> 00:13.740
as catharsis for wages who really just wanted to stick it to their boss, but was rapidly

00:13.740 --> 00:16.400
subverted and became all about overt communism.

00:16.400 --> 00:20.280
The most recent video was centered on the now former admin of the sub, since he had

00:20.280 --> 00:22.500
quite a few skeletons in his closet.

00:22.500 --> 00:26.360
But the first video was all about how there actually wasn't anything anti-capitalist

00:26.360 --> 00:28.440
about the content of r slash anti-work.

00:28.440 --> 00:30.680
It was, in fact, capitalism working as intended.

00:30.680 --> 00:34.040
Just as an example of what I mean, check out this recent post.

00:34.040 --> 00:35.040
It's a free market.

00:35.040 --> 00:38.200
I get to decide who buys my product, my product being my labor.

00:38.200 --> 00:39.940
My labor goes to the highest bidder.

00:39.940 --> 00:40.940
Want my labor?

00:40.940 --> 00:41.940
Outbid the next guy.

00:41.940 --> 00:43.260
Millennials aren't job hopping.

00:43.260 --> 00:46.440
You were either too poor or too cheap to pay for their labor.

00:46.440 --> 00:48.900
This is actually a completely reasonable statement.

00:48.900 --> 00:51.920
The comments are talking about how this is sticking it to the man, or doing praxis or

00:51.920 --> 00:52.920
whatever.

00:52.920 --> 00:54.320
But this is actually how it should be.

00:54.320 --> 00:58.000
For example, when conservatives talk about limiting immigration in order to reduce the

00:58.040 --> 01:03.540
supply of labor, forcing employers into bidding wars over the labor pool, this is explicitly

01:03.540 --> 01:04.620
what they're talking about.

01:04.620 --> 01:07.100
This isn't some leftist subversion of capitalism.

01:07.100 --> 01:09.260
This is actually what conservatives want.

01:09.260 --> 01:12.520
That's the entirety of r slash anti-work's quality posts.

01:12.520 --> 01:15.020
The ones that are not openly about socialist theory.

01:15.020 --> 01:19.040
People mistaking properly engaging in a market for anti-capitalism.

01:19.040 --> 01:23.520
r slash anti-work blew up during an event called the Great Resignation.

01:23.520 --> 01:26.800
After the economic effects of COVID lockdowns began to really make themselves felt, your

01:26.800 --> 01:28.960
average person realized a few key things.

01:28.960 --> 01:32.720
One, COVID benefits paid way more than having an entry-level job.

01:32.720 --> 01:37.320
Two, despite lockdowns massively slowing down immigration and the resulting labor shortage,

01:37.320 --> 01:40.520
jobs still weren't offering any more benefits or pay to compete.

01:40.520 --> 01:44.860
Three, the combination of one and two heavily contribute to the inflation crisis.

01:44.860 --> 01:47.360
The question was then asked by a lot of normies.

01:47.360 --> 01:48.360
Why work at all?

01:48.360 --> 01:51.480
If your job sucks and you're not getting paid what you're worth, and your boss refuses

01:51.480 --> 01:55.320
to renegotiate with you, and Biden's got the money printers revved up to maximum, what

01:55.320 --> 01:57.040
the hell is the incentive to keep your job?

01:57.040 --> 02:01.140
I mean we all know at the macro level the long-term incentive is that you can't mindlessly

02:01.140 --> 02:04.380
endlessly print your way of an economic crisis, which is something that we just might have

02:04.380 --> 02:06.340
to learn for ourselves first hand.

02:06.340 --> 02:10.540
But that doesn't motivate people to make choices when short-term economically rational

02:10.540 --> 02:12.680
options are staring them in the face.

02:12.680 --> 02:16.460
Plus over the course of lockdowns people got used to working from home and once jobs started

02:16.460 --> 02:19.900
calling workers back into the office everybody began to question the practice.

02:19.900 --> 02:21.720
I can see both sides of this one frankly.

02:21.720 --> 02:25.240
On the one hand going into work sucks, especially if your co-workers suck or the dress code

02:25.280 --> 02:26.780
sucks, or the location sucks.

02:26.780 --> 02:29.980
If you got to put on a suit and tie to go into a cubicle and do the same office work

02:29.980 --> 02:33.740
you can do at home, only you're less productive and you're stuck there for eight hours without

02:33.740 --> 02:36.360
any privacy and having to interact with people that you don't like, working out of your

02:36.360 --> 02:37.360
house sounds pretty good.

02:37.360 --> 02:38.400
Who would want to go back?

02:38.400 --> 02:39.400
Not me.

02:39.400 --> 02:42.880
But on the other hand, the automization of the most basic functions of life really kicked

02:42.880 --> 02:44.280
into high gear during COVID.

02:44.280 --> 02:46.920
You need housewares or electronics or even clothing?

02:46.920 --> 02:47.920
Buy it from Amazon.

02:47.920 --> 02:48.920
Need groceries?

02:48.920 --> 02:49.920
Instacart it.

02:49.920 --> 02:50.920
Want to order food?

02:50.920 --> 02:51.920
Use Grubhub.

02:51.920 --> 02:52.920
All while you work from home.

02:52.920 --> 02:54.020
It's a neat paradise out there right now.

02:54.020 --> 02:55.500
You never have to leave your house again.

02:55.500 --> 02:58.980
And while that's comfy for a little while, it's got to be psychologically damaging

02:58.980 --> 03:03.180
to do it long term, to just never go outside or engage with the community ever again.

03:03.180 --> 03:05.400
It's out of all of this that we got quiet quitting.

03:05.400 --> 03:09.060
The term quiet quitting is older than this current series of events, but was first thrust

03:09.060 --> 03:13.400
into the modern limelight when this TikTok video was posted on r slash anti work and

03:13.400 --> 03:14.740
subsequently went viral.

03:14.740 --> 03:18.580
I recently learned about this term called quiet quitting, where you're not outright

03:18.580 --> 03:21.860
quitting your job, but you're quitting the idea of going above and beyond.

03:21.860 --> 03:24.860
You're still performing your duties, but you're no longer subscribing to the hustle

03:24.860 --> 03:27.500
culture mentality that work has to be your life.

03:27.500 --> 03:32.420
The reality is it's not and your worth as a person is not defined by your labor.

03:32.420 --> 03:35.620
This has actually been around for over 50 years, but under a different name work to

03:35.620 --> 03:39.680
rule, meaning literally work to the rules of your contract or workplace and not one

03:39.680 --> 03:40.680
bit more.

03:40.680 --> 03:45.100
The idea is some employers don't understand or value the little extra bits of unpaid labor

03:45.100 --> 03:48.280
they get from their employees who do it simply out of convenience.

03:48.280 --> 03:51.840
Like if you check your work email after hours, or if you punch out and then go quickly for

03:51.840 --> 03:54.760
you to finish up a job before going home, or if you do a quick little thing during your

03:54.760 --> 03:55.760
break.

03:55.760 --> 03:59.400
And if an entire workforce adheres to their rights under contract strictly, not giving

03:59.400 --> 04:03.920
up even one little drop of unpaid labor, the resulting slowdown of productivity at the

04:03.920 --> 04:08.080
company is enough to make management notice while simultaneously breaking no rules or

04:08.080 --> 04:09.080
laws.

04:09.080 --> 04:12.840
To refer back to Reddit again, it's basically just r slash malicious compliance.

04:12.840 --> 04:16.320
And people are eating this shit up, like Zoomers have found something amazing and new.

04:16.320 --> 04:20.280
Oh my god guys, what if we just did the bare minimum in our jobs in order to not get fired,

04:20.280 --> 04:22.160
and then used our extra time and energy on ourselves?

04:22.160 --> 04:24.720
Yeah, people have been doing that since before you were even born.

04:24.720 --> 04:28.640
However, a lot of the tech talks on the topic seem to not really understand the basics,

04:28.640 --> 04:29.640
like this one.

04:29.640 --> 04:32.380
Hey Bob, for the next month or two, I'm gonna need you to come in an hour or two early and

04:32.380 --> 04:36.120
stay a couple hours behind, a little short staffed and all hands on deck.

04:36.120 --> 04:37.320
Oh, sure thing.

04:37.320 --> 04:40.280
Are you gonna double my pay for the extra hours I'm working?

04:40.280 --> 04:43.200
Bob, we pay you a $40,000 a year salary.

04:43.200 --> 04:45.340
Of course we're not gonna give you overtime.

04:45.340 --> 04:49.440
Think of it as a learning experience and giving the company an extra helping hand.

04:49.440 --> 04:52.760
Okay, does this learning experience pay my bills?

04:52.760 --> 04:55.560
Or better yet, does it pick up my kids from daycare?

04:55.560 --> 04:59.520
No, but there is a performance review next month.

04:59.520 --> 05:00.520
What?

05:00.520 --> 05:02.520
So that I can get a 5% pay bump versus 3%?

05:02.520 --> 05:03.680
Yeah, I'm all set.

05:03.680 --> 05:04.680
I'm gonna quiet quit.

05:04.680 --> 05:06.120
I'm gonna quiet what?

05:06.120 --> 05:07.120
Quiet quitting.

05:07.120 --> 05:09.600
I'm gonna come in during my normal working hours next week and do my job.

05:09.600 --> 05:11.680
If you need me to do more, you can pay me more.

05:11.680 --> 05:13.680
Otherwise, I'm all set, thanks.

05:13.680 --> 05:17.920
Asking what's my overtime pay is a reasonable question if you're paid by the hour.

05:17.920 --> 05:21.280
Generally speaking, the upside of an hourly position is that your time is measured strictly

05:21.280 --> 05:22.400
and paid for strictly.

05:22.400 --> 05:23.980
You go overtime, you get overtime.

05:23.980 --> 05:26.840
The trade-off is that you generally lack flexibility in your shifts.

05:26.840 --> 05:28.080
You work when they need you.

05:28.080 --> 05:31.240
But a salaried position isn't paid by the hour, it's paid by the job.

05:31.240 --> 05:33.180
The downside to this system is that there's no overtime.

05:33.180 --> 05:35.620
You put in as many hours as it takes to get the job done.

05:35.620 --> 05:38.860
But the upside is that, generally, hours are far more flexible.

05:38.860 --> 05:42.200
If you need to leave early to bring your kid to the doctors or go on a family trip or whatever,

05:42.200 --> 05:43.200
that's fine.

05:43.200 --> 05:46.000
Just get your work done early or call in a favor from a coworker and the time off is

05:46.000 --> 05:47.000
no problem.

05:47.000 --> 05:48.000
That's the balance.

05:48.000 --> 05:50.500
Hourly positions with overtime but little flexibility.

05:50.500 --> 05:53.000
Salaried positions with no overtime but lots of flexibility.

05:53.000 --> 05:56.940
Historically, hourly positions are more likely to be blue collar and unionized, while salaried

05:56.940 --> 05:59.400
positions are more likely to be white collar and middle management.

05:59.400 --> 06:03.080
The reason for this divide is because, generally, hourly positions at the bottom of the hierarchy

06:03.080 --> 06:07.200
are more physically demanding, more at risk due to the lower amount of education required,

06:07.200 --> 06:11.700
and also most likely to be exploited by management, while the salaried positions at the top provide

06:11.700 --> 06:15.420
more connections in the industry, more opportunities for advancement, and more job security.

06:15.420 --> 06:19.460
The quiet quitters on TikTok are treating a salaried position like it's an hourly one.

06:19.460 --> 06:20.460
And hey, man, that's fine.

06:20.460 --> 06:21.460
You do you.

06:21.460 --> 06:22.460
Like, listen to this chick.

06:22.460 --> 06:26.360
Here's my take on the whole quiet quitting conversation that's going on right now.

06:26.360 --> 06:32.540
Quiet quitting is doing the bare minimum at work and not going 110% above and beyond expectations.

06:32.540 --> 06:36.540
And it's being defined as leaving work on time, not checking your emails outside of

06:36.540 --> 06:41.660
work hours, and not subscribing to hustle culture, which, isn't that what a job should

06:41.660 --> 06:42.660
be already?

06:42.660 --> 06:46.100
It's one of those narratives that paints the employee as the villain.

06:46.100 --> 06:51.220
When the symptoms of quiet quitting, like being disengaged from work, not being motivated,

06:51.220 --> 06:55.060
being disconnected from the values and the missions of the company, are mostly things

06:55.060 --> 06:59.460
that the company needs to solve and address, bottom line is that people just want to detach

06:59.460 --> 07:01.620
their identities from their working life.

07:01.620 --> 07:05.580
It's got to be a two-way street from the employer as well, because employees want to

07:05.580 --> 07:08.220
feel supported in their role and in their life.

07:08.220 --> 07:09.380
This is all reasonable to me.

07:09.380 --> 07:10.460
I'm not a Marxist here.

07:10.460 --> 07:13.460
I don't believe in a lasting, permanent connection between people that grants you

07:13.460 --> 07:16.820
a stake in their behavior due to simple economic interactions.

07:16.820 --> 07:20.460
But I promise you, if you behave like this in a salaried job, when it comes time for

07:20.460 --> 07:23.900
somebody to get promoted, you'll be the one passed up for advancement, in favor of

07:23.900 --> 07:26.180
somebody else who didn't quiet quit.

07:26.180 --> 07:30.340
In an hourly position, especially if it's unionized, promotions come solely by seniority.

07:30.340 --> 07:32.980
If you've got the most hours, that means you're the next in line for the promotion.

07:32.980 --> 07:35.720
That system has its own problems, because there's no guarantee that the person with

07:35.720 --> 07:37.260
the most hours is the most qualified.

07:37.260 --> 07:39.160
They might just be the last hanger on.

07:39.160 --> 07:43.000
For example, the current manager at my last wagey job, the one that I quit to do YouTube

07:43.000 --> 07:47.500
full time, is only the manager because everybody else recognized the job as transitory and

07:47.500 --> 07:50.920
used it as a stepping stone to build some quick cash and then get out.

07:50.920 --> 07:54.360
She's a meth addict who was the least capable of all of us, and her promotions serve as

07:54.360 --> 07:58.280
a confirmant, because people who are actually capable end up moving on instead of moving

07:58.280 --> 07:59.280
up.

07:59.280 --> 08:02.320
But in a salaried position, if you're putting in the bare minimum while your coworker is

08:02.320 --> 08:04.440
going above and beyond, you're not getting the promotion.

08:04.440 --> 08:05.440
It's as simple as that.

08:05.440 --> 08:09.080
Now, if you're okay with that, if you don't want promotions, if you want to just stay

08:09.080 --> 08:12.860
where you are and not advance in your career, then quiet quitting is exactly what you should

08:12.860 --> 08:13.860
do.

08:13.860 --> 08:16.160
If they want you to do more than what you were hired to do, they should pay you.

08:16.160 --> 08:17.660
If they're not going to pay you, you shouldn't do it.

08:17.660 --> 08:21.200
I guess what these people are missing is, they actually are paying you.

08:21.200 --> 08:24.880
They're paying you in promotions, networking, opportunities, all of which do lead to more

08:24.880 --> 08:25.940
money down the road.

08:25.940 --> 08:28.520
But it's completely reasonable not to want those things too.

08:28.520 --> 08:31.340
I wouldn't want to get paid in Wendy's gift cards, even though it's still money

08:31.340 --> 08:32.560
I could spend at Wendy's.

08:32.560 --> 08:36.160
If they're not compensating you in your preferred currency, dollars over career advancement

08:36.160 --> 08:38.980
in this case, then that pay is a lot less valuable to you.

08:38.980 --> 08:42.020
Of course, a lot of the discourse around this topic isn't exactly intelligent.

08:42.020 --> 08:43.020
Okay, let's see.

08:43.020 --> 08:44.020
Goal for today.

08:44.020 --> 08:45.020
500 calls.

08:45.020 --> 08:46.020
We're doing 50.

08:46.020 --> 08:47.020
We're doing 50.

08:47.020 --> 08:50.820
She did not say that.

08:50.820 --> 08:51.820
She did not.

08:51.820 --> 08:52.820
I'm dying.

08:52.820 --> 08:53.820
I'm happy to help.

08:53.820 --> 08:54.820
Have a great day.

08:54.820 --> 08:55.820
Okay.

08:55.820 --> 08:56.820
Bye.

08:56.820 --> 09:02.300
Jesus Christ, if I work with this lady, I would love it if she would actually quit.

09:02.300 --> 09:04.860
Also, she swings a bit too far in the other direction, you know?

09:04.860 --> 09:06.780
It's Maple Muffin Monday, everyone.

09:06.780 --> 09:08.720
Let's go to the break room.

09:08.720 --> 09:11.440
We watched last week's episode of The Bachelorette.

09:11.440 --> 09:14.240
Yeah, good drama, right?

09:14.240 --> 09:18.000
Quiet quitting is doing your job, not not doing it while on the clock.

09:18.000 --> 09:19.740
That's something you should actually be disciplined for.

09:19.740 --> 09:24.200
But there's always one nugget of truth inside even the most annoying of TikTok videos.

09:24.200 --> 09:26.240
She mentions the phrase acting your wage.

09:26.240 --> 09:29.600
Hey, Veronica, you have till end of day to finish all this extra work.

09:29.600 --> 09:34.400
Respectfully, Susan, it's 2022, we're acting our wage, so don't give me extra work.

09:34.400 --> 09:35.400
Okay?

09:35.400 --> 09:36.400
Thank you.

09:36.400 --> 09:37.400
Thank you.

09:37.400 --> 09:40.720
This idea of acting your age, a saying that I'm sure we all heard growing up, acting your

09:40.720 --> 09:44.240
wage is basically the same thing as quiet quitting and working to rule.

09:44.240 --> 09:45.980
It's the idea that you do what you're paid for.

09:45.980 --> 09:46.980
And fair enough.

09:46.980 --> 09:48.760
But we can also flip this on its head.

09:48.760 --> 09:51.140
If you want a higher wage, you got to act like it too.

09:51.140 --> 09:54.800
This idea is best seen as something like commission work, where the more you do, the more you

09:54.800 --> 09:55.800
get paid.

09:55.800 --> 09:59.040
And that job, whether it's high pay or low pay, you're always acting your wage.

09:59.040 --> 10:02.640
On the weekly sip a little while ago, I read an article describing Ontario's provincial

10:02.640 --> 10:05.000
government enshrining a right to disconnect.

10:05.000 --> 10:08.680
What this basically means is that your employer cannot punish you for not doing anything work

10:08.680 --> 10:10.020
related on your off hours.

10:10.020 --> 10:14.080
We're talking small stuff like answering emails, unless you are being paid to be on call.

10:14.080 --> 10:18.860
As I've mentioned in both this video and a dozen others, Marx's critique of liberalism

10:18.860 --> 10:21.520
stems from the liberal's right of disconnection.

10:21.520 --> 10:24.880
You must be on call at all times, even if we don't pay you.

10:24.880 --> 10:27.000
Sounds like it's an exploitative capitalist wet dream.

10:27.000 --> 10:30.220
I'm sure it is, but it's not strictly a capitalist thing.

10:30.220 --> 10:34.200
We saw, for example, during the early stages of COVID in China, doctors and nurses were

10:34.200 --> 10:38.880
forced to work under the threat of state retaliation every waking hour of every day

10:38.880 --> 10:42.720
because the society, the people, the collective had a right to their labor.

10:42.720 --> 10:46.800
Ontario's law came from conservatives, and progressives here haven't spoken a word about

10:46.800 --> 10:47.800
it.

10:47.800 --> 10:50.920
Socialists only view the quiet quitting stuff, the acting your wage stuff, as a win because

10:50.920 --> 10:52.280
they're not in power.

10:52.280 --> 10:53.840
If they were, it wouldn't be tolerated.

10:53.840 --> 10:56.440
Because if you don't labor, you're stealing from the workers, comrade.

10:56.440 --> 11:00.240
This is the main reason why the individualist perspective is the solution to all of this.

11:00.240 --> 11:02.840
When I work on my YouTube channel, yes, it's YouTube who pays me.

11:02.840 --> 11:05.460
And yes, they benefit from my work, but I don't do it for them.

11:05.460 --> 11:08.360
I don't really care about them as a company, especially after the copyright bullshit I

11:08.360 --> 11:09.420
had to deal with recently.

11:09.420 --> 11:10.480
I do it for me.

11:10.480 --> 11:12.560
When I work harder, I'm the one who benefits.

11:12.560 --> 11:14.160
YouTube benefits too, but I don't really care.

11:14.160 --> 11:15.360
I care about me.

11:15.360 --> 11:19.360
The quiet quitting mentality applies if you will literally get nothing for going above

11:19.360 --> 11:20.360
and beyond.

11:20.360 --> 11:22.200
No overtime pay, no career advancement, nothing.

11:22.200 --> 11:25.800
At that point, the only thing left to get is the pride of knowing that you went above

11:25.800 --> 11:27.960
and beyond and that your name is attached to the excellence.

11:27.960 --> 11:31.320
That's good, sure, but I wouldn't blame people for not doing a thing if that's the

11:31.320 --> 11:32.320
only reward.

11:32.800 --> 11:36.560
However, if there actually is a reward for going above and beyond and you decide to quiet

11:36.560 --> 11:38.760
quit, that's your choice, but you're kind of a loser.

11:38.760 --> 11:41.480
I mean, at least you're getting out of the way of people who actually want to move forward

11:41.480 --> 11:42.480
with things.

11:42.480 --> 11:43.480
That's a plus.

11:43.480 --> 11:44.480
But you're purposely gimping your career.

11:44.480 --> 11:47.360
Again, if you don't value your career and want to spend time with your friends or whatever,

11:47.360 --> 11:48.360
that's your choice.

11:48.360 --> 11:51.400
But 30 years down the line, when the other guy has blown up and you're still at the

11:51.400 --> 11:53.720
bottom of the totem pole, you have only yourself to blame.

11:53.720 --> 11:56.760
But at the very least, within a liberal system, you have that choice.

11:56.760 --> 11:59.260
You have the choice to be mediocre if that's what you really want.

11:59.300 --> 12:03.300
Every socialist society points guns at the workers and demands that they work towards

12:03.300 --> 12:07.300
the socialist utopia because if the working class collectively owns their labor, then

12:07.300 --> 12:09.100
the collective owns your labor.

12:09.100 --> 12:12.060
You don't own it in an individualistic, exclusive way.

12:12.060 --> 12:15.140
There's no quiet quitting allowed when others have the right to your labor.

12:15.140 --> 12:21.700
At the end of the day, this quiet quitting thing is example 596,872 of socialists not

12:21.700 --> 12:25.860
understanding how capitalism works, performing capitalism as it was intended, and failing

12:25.860 --> 12:29.660
to realize that if they lived in their system of choice, they would be shot for doing this

12:29.660 --> 12:30.260
very thing.
