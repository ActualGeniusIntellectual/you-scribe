1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,800
At this point, I've done two videos on r slash anti-work, the subreddit that began

2
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:13,740
as catharsis for wages who really just wanted to stick it to their boss, but was rapidly

3
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:16,400
subverted and became all about overt communism.

4
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:20,280
The most recent video was centered on the now former admin of the sub, since he had

5
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:22,500
quite a few skeletons in his closet.

6
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:26,360
But the first video was all about how there actually wasn't anything anti-capitalist

7
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:28,440
about the content of r slash anti-work.

8
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:30,680
It was, in fact, capitalism working as intended.

9
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:34,040
Just as an example of what I mean, check out this recent post.

10
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:35,040
It's a free market.

11
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:38,200
I get to decide who buys my product, my product being my labor.

12
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:39,940
My labor goes to the highest bidder.

13
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:40,940
Want my labor?

14
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:41,940
Outbid the next guy.

15
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:43,260
Millennials aren't job hopping.

16
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:46,440
You were either too poor or too cheap to pay for their labor.

17
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:48,900
This is actually a completely reasonable statement.

18
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:51,920
The comments are talking about how this is sticking it to the man, or doing praxis or

19
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:52,920
whatever.

20
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:54,320
But this is actually how it should be.

21
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:58,000
For example, when conservatives talk about limiting immigration in order to reduce the

22
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:03,540
supply of labor, forcing employers into bidding wars over the labor pool, this is explicitly

23
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:04,620
what they're talking about.

24
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:07,100
This isn't some leftist subversion of capitalism.

25
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:09,260
This is actually what conservatives want.

26
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:12,520
That's the entirety of r slash anti-work's quality posts.

27
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:15,020
The ones that are not openly about socialist theory.

28
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:19,040
People mistaking properly engaging in a market for anti-capitalism.

29
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:23,520
r slash anti-work blew up during an event called the Great Resignation.

30
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:26,800
After the economic effects of COVID lockdowns began to really make themselves felt, your

31
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:28,960
average person realized a few key things.

32
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:32,720
One, COVID benefits paid way more than having an entry-level job.

33
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:37,320
Two, despite lockdowns massively slowing down immigration and the resulting labor shortage,

34
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:40,520
jobs still weren't offering any more benefits or pay to compete.

35
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:44,860
Three, the combination of one and two heavily contribute to the inflation crisis.

36
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:47,360
The question was then asked by a lot of normies.

37
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:48,360
Why work at all?

38
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:51,480
If your job sucks and you're not getting paid what you're worth, and your boss refuses

39
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:55,320
to renegotiate with you, and Biden's got the money printers revved up to maximum, what

40
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:57,040
the hell is the incentive to keep your job?

41
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:01,140
I mean we all know at the macro level the long-term incentive is that you can't mindlessly

42
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:04,380
endlessly print your way of an economic crisis, which is something that we just might have

43
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:06,340
to learn for ourselves first hand.

44
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:10,540
But that doesn't motivate people to make choices when short-term economically rational

45
00:02:10,540 --> 00:02:12,680
options are staring them in the face.

46
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:16,460
Plus over the course of lockdowns people got used to working from home and once jobs started

47
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:19,900
calling workers back into the office everybody began to question the practice.

48
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:21,720
I can see both sides of this one frankly.

49
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:25,240
On the one hand going into work sucks, especially if your co-workers suck or the dress code

50
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,780
sucks, or the location sucks.

51
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:29,980
If you got to put on a suit and tie to go into a cubicle and do the same office work

52
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:33,740
you can do at home, only you're less productive and you're stuck there for eight hours without

53
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:36,360
any privacy and having to interact with people that you don't like, working out of your

54
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,360
house sounds pretty good.

55
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,400
Who would want to go back?

56
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,400
Not me.

57
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:42,880
But on the other hand, the automization of the most basic functions of life really kicked

58
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:44,280
into high gear during COVID.

59
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:46,920
You need housewares or electronics or even clothing?

60
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:47,920
Buy it from Amazon.

61
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:48,920
Need groceries?

62
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:49,920
Instacart it.

63
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:50,920
Want to order food?

64
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:51,920
Use Grubhub.

65
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:52,920
All while you work from home.

66
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:54,020
It's a neat paradise out there right now.

67
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:55,500
You never have to leave your house again.

68
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:58,980
And while that's comfy for a little while, it's got to be psychologically damaging

69
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:03,180
to do it long term, to just never go outside or engage with the community ever again.

70
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:05,400
It's out of all of this that we got quiet quitting.

71
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:09,060
The term quiet quitting is older than this current series of events, but was first thrust

72
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:13,400
into the modern limelight when this TikTok video was posted on r slash anti work and

73
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,740
subsequently went viral.

74
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:18,580
I recently learned about this term called quiet quitting, where you're not outright

75
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:21,860
quitting your job, but you're quitting the idea of going above and beyond.

76
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:24,860
You're still performing your duties, but you're no longer subscribing to the hustle

77
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:27,500
culture mentality that work has to be your life.

78
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:32,420
The reality is it's not and your worth as a person is not defined by your labor.

79
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:35,620
This has actually been around for over 50 years, but under a different name work to

80
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:39,680
rule, meaning literally work to the rules of your contract or workplace and not one

81
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:40,680
bit more.

82
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:45,100
The idea is some employers don't understand or value the little extra bits of unpaid labor

83
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:48,280
they get from their employees who do it simply out of convenience.

84
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:51,840
Like if you check your work email after hours, or if you punch out and then go quickly for

85
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,760
you to finish up a job before going home, or if you do a quick little thing during your

86
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:55,760
break.

87
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:59,400
And if an entire workforce adheres to their rights under contract strictly, not giving

88
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:03,920
up even one little drop of unpaid labor, the resulting slowdown of productivity at the

89
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:08,080
company is enough to make management notice while simultaneously breaking no rules or

90
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,080
laws.

91
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:12,840
To refer back to Reddit again, it's basically just r slash malicious compliance.

92
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:16,320
And people are eating this shit up, like Zoomers have found something amazing and new.

93
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:20,280
Oh my god guys, what if we just did the bare minimum in our jobs in order to not get fired,

94
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:22,160
and then used our extra time and energy on ourselves?

95
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,720
Yeah, people have been doing that since before you were even born.

96
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:28,640
However, a lot of the tech talks on the topic seem to not really understand the basics,

97
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:29,640
like this one.

98
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:32,380
Hey Bob, for the next month or two, I'm gonna need you to come in an hour or two early and

99
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:36,120
stay a couple hours behind, a little short staffed and all hands on deck.

100
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,320
Oh, sure thing.

101
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:40,280
Are you gonna double my pay for the extra hours I'm working?

102
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:43,200
Bob, we pay you a $40,000 a year salary.

103
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:45,340
Of course we're not gonna give you overtime.

104
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:49,440
Think of it as a learning experience and giving the company an extra helping hand.

105
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:52,760
Okay, does this learning experience pay my bills?

106
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:55,560
Or better yet, does it pick up my kids from daycare?

107
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:59,520
No, but there is a performance review next month.

108
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:00,520
What?

109
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:02,520
So that I can get a 5% pay bump versus 3%?

110
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:03,680
Yeah, I'm all set.

111
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:04,680
I'm gonna quiet quit.

112
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,120
I'm gonna quiet what?

113
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,120
Quiet quitting.

114
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,600
I'm gonna come in during my normal working hours next week and do my job.

115
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,680
If you need me to do more, you can pay me more.

116
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,680
Otherwise, I'm all set, thanks.

117
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:17,920
Asking what's my overtime pay is a reasonable question if you're paid by the hour.

118
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:21,280
Generally speaking, the upside of an hourly position is that your time is measured strictly

119
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,400
and paid for strictly.

120
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,980
You go overtime, you get overtime.

121
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:26,840
The trade-off is that you generally lack flexibility in your shifts.

122
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:28,080
You work when they need you.

123
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:31,240
But a salaried position isn't paid by the hour, it's paid by the job.

124
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:33,180
The downside to this system is that there's no overtime.

125
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:35,620
You put in as many hours as it takes to get the job done.

126
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:38,860
But the upside is that, generally, hours are far more flexible.

127
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:42,200
If you need to leave early to bring your kid to the doctors or go on a family trip or whatever,

128
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,200
that's fine.

129
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:46,000
Just get your work done early or call in a favor from a coworker and the time off is

130
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
no problem.

131
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
That's the balance.

132
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,500
Hourly positions with overtime but little flexibility.

133
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:53,000
Salaried positions with no overtime but lots of flexibility.

134
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,940
Historically, hourly positions are more likely to be blue collar and unionized, while salaried

135
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:59,400
positions are more likely to be white collar and middle management.

136
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:03,080
The reason for this divide is because, generally, hourly positions at the bottom of the hierarchy

137
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:07,200
are more physically demanding, more at risk due to the lower amount of education required,

138
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:11,700
and also most likely to be exploited by management, while the salaried positions at the top provide

139
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:15,420
more connections in the industry, more opportunities for advancement, and more job security.

140
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:19,460
The quiet quitters on TikTok are treating a salaried position like it's an hourly one.

141
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:20,460
And hey, man, that's fine.

142
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:21,460
You do you.

143
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:22,460
Like, listen to this chick.

144
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:26,360
Here's my take on the whole quiet quitting conversation that's going on right now.

145
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:32,540
Quiet quitting is doing the bare minimum at work and not going 110% above and beyond expectations.

146
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:36,540
And it's being defined as leaving work on time, not checking your emails outside of

147
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:41,660
work hours, and not subscribing to hustle culture, which, isn't that what a job should

148
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:42,660
be already?

149
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:46,100
It's one of those narratives that paints the employee as the villain.

150
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:51,220
When the symptoms of quiet quitting, like being disengaged from work, not being motivated,

151
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:55,060
being disconnected from the values and the missions of the company, are mostly things

152
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:59,460
that the company needs to solve and address, bottom line is that people just want to detach

153
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:01,620
their identities from their working life.

154
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:05,580
It's got to be a two-way street from the employer as well, because employees want to

155
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:08,220
feel supported in their role and in their life.

156
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:09,380
This is all reasonable to me.

157
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:10,460
I'm not a Marxist here.

158
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:13,460
I don't believe in a lasting, permanent connection between people that grants you

159
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:16,820
a stake in their behavior due to simple economic interactions.

160
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:20,460
But I promise you, if you behave like this in a salaried job, when it comes time for

161
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:23,900
somebody to get promoted, you'll be the one passed up for advancement, in favor of

162
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:26,180
somebody else who didn't quiet quit.

163
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:30,340
In an hourly position, especially if it's unionized, promotions come solely by seniority.

164
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:32,980
If you've got the most hours, that means you're the next in line for the promotion.

165
00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:35,720
That system has its own problems, because there's no guarantee that the person with

166
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:37,260
the most hours is the most qualified.

167
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:39,160
They might just be the last hanger on.

168
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:43,000
For example, the current manager at my last wagey job, the one that I quit to do YouTube

169
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,500
full time, is only the manager because everybody else recognized the job as transitory and

170
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:50,920
used it as a stepping stone to build some quick cash and then get out.

171
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:54,360
She's a meth addict who was the least capable of all of us, and her promotions serve as

172
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:58,280
a confirmant, because people who are actually capable end up moving on instead of moving

173
00:07:58,280 --> 00:07:59,280
up.

174
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:02,320
But in a salaried position, if you're putting in the bare minimum while your coworker is

175
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:04,440
going above and beyond, you're not getting the promotion.

176
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:05,440
It's as simple as that.

177
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:09,080
Now, if you're okay with that, if you don't want promotions, if you want to just stay

178
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:12,860
where you are and not advance in your career, then quiet quitting is exactly what you should

179
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:13,860
do.

180
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:16,160
If they want you to do more than what you were hired to do, they should pay you.

181
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,660
If they're not going to pay you, you shouldn't do it.

182
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:21,200
I guess what these people are missing is, they actually are paying you.

183
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:24,880
They're paying you in promotions, networking, opportunities, all of which do lead to more

184
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:25,940
money down the road.

185
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:28,520
But it's completely reasonable not to want those things too.

186
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:31,340
I wouldn't want to get paid in Wendy's gift cards, even though it's still money

187
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:32,560
I could spend at Wendy's.

188
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:36,160
If they're not compensating you in your preferred currency, dollars over career advancement

189
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:38,980
in this case, then that pay is a lot less valuable to you.

190
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:42,020
Of course, a lot of the discourse around this topic isn't exactly intelligent.

191
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:43,020
Okay, let's see.

192
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:44,020
Goal for today.

193
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:45,020
500 calls.

194
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:46,020
We're doing 50.

195
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:47,020
We're doing 50.

196
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:50,820
She did not say that.

197
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:51,820
She did not.

198
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:52,820
I'm dying.

199
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:53,820
I'm happy to help.

200
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:54,820
Have a great day.

201
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:55,820
Okay.

202
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:56,820
Bye.

203
00:08:56,820 --> 00:09:02,300
Jesus Christ, if I work with this lady, I would love it if she would actually quit.

204
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:04,860
Also, she swings a bit too far in the other direction, you know?

205
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:06,780
It's Maple Muffin Monday, everyone.

206
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:08,720
Let's go to the break room.

207
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:11,440
We watched last week's episode of The Bachelorette.

208
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:14,240
Yeah, good drama, right?

209
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:18,000
Quiet quitting is doing your job, not not doing it while on the clock.

210
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,740
That's something you should actually be disciplined for.

211
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:24,200
But there's always one nugget of truth inside even the most annoying of TikTok videos.

212
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:26,240
She mentions the phrase acting your wage.

213
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:29,600
Hey, Veronica, you have till end of day to finish all this extra work.

214
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:34,400
Respectfully, Susan, it's 2022, we're acting our wage, so don't give me extra work.

215
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,400
Okay?

216
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,400
Thank you.

217
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:37,400
Thank you.

218
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:40,720
This idea of acting your age, a saying that I'm sure we all heard growing up, acting your

219
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:44,240
wage is basically the same thing as quiet quitting and working to rule.

220
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:45,980
It's the idea that you do what you're paid for.

221
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:46,980
And fair enough.

222
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:48,760
But we can also flip this on its head.

223
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:51,140
If you want a higher wage, you got to act like it too.

224
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:54,800
This idea is best seen as something like commission work, where the more you do, the more you

225
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:55,800
get paid.

226
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:59,040
And that job, whether it's high pay or low pay, you're always acting your wage.

227
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:02,640
On the weekly sip a little while ago, I read an article describing Ontario's provincial

228
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:05,000
government enshrining a right to disconnect.

229
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,680
What this basically means is that your employer cannot punish you for not doing anything work

230
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:10,020
related on your off hours.

231
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:14,080
We're talking small stuff like answering emails, unless you are being paid to be on call.

232
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:18,860
As I've mentioned in both this video and a dozen others, Marx's critique of liberalism

233
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:21,520
stems from the liberal's right of disconnection.

234
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:24,880
You must be on call at all times, even if we don't pay you.

235
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:27,000
Sounds like it's an exploitative capitalist wet dream.

236
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,220
I'm sure it is, but it's not strictly a capitalist thing.

237
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:34,200
We saw, for example, during the early stages of COVID in China, doctors and nurses were

238
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:38,880
forced to work under the threat of state retaliation every waking hour of every day

239
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:42,720
because the society, the people, the collective had a right to their labor.

240
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:46,800
Ontario's law came from conservatives, and progressives here haven't spoken a word about

241
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:47,800
it.

242
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:50,920
Socialists only view the quiet quitting stuff, the acting your wage stuff, as a win because

243
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:52,280
they're not in power.

244
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:53,840
If they were, it wouldn't be tolerated.

245
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:56,440
Because if you don't labor, you're stealing from the workers, comrade.

246
00:10:56,440 --> 00:11:00,240
This is the main reason why the individualist perspective is the solution to all of this.

247
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:02,840
When I work on my YouTube channel, yes, it's YouTube who pays me.

248
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:05,460
And yes, they benefit from my work, but I don't do it for them.

249
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:08,360
I don't really care about them as a company, especially after the copyright bullshit I

250
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:09,420
had to deal with recently.

251
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:10,480
I do it for me.

252
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,560
When I work harder, I'm the one who benefits.

253
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,160
YouTube benefits too, but I don't really care.

254
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:15,360
I care about me.

255
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:19,360
The quiet quitting mentality applies if you will literally get nothing for going above

256
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:20,360
and beyond.

257
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:22,200
No overtime pay, no career advancement, nothing.

258
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:25,800
At that point, the only thing left to get is the pride of knowing that you went above

259
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,960
and beyond and that your name is attached to the excellence.

260
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:31,320
That's good, sure, but I wouldn't blame people for not doing a thing if that's the

261
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:32,320
only reward.

262
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:36,560
However, if there actually is a reward for going above and beyond and you decide to quiet

263
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,760
quit, that's your choice, but you're kind of a loser.

264
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:41,480
I mean, at least you're getting out of the way of people who actually want to move forward

265
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:42,480
with things.

266
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,480
That's a plus.

267
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:44,480
But you're purposely gimping your career.

268
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:47,360
Again, if you don't value your career and want to spend time with your friends or whatever,

269
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:48,360
that's your choice.

270
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:51,400
But 30 years down the line, when the other guy has blown up and you're still at the

271
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:53,720
bottom of the totem pole, you have only yourself to blame.

272
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:56,760
But at the very least, within a liberal system, you have that choice.

273
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:59,260
You have the choice to be mediocre if that's what you really want.

274
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:03,300
Every socialist society points guns at the workers and demands that they work towards

275
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:07,300
the socialist utopia because if the working class collectively owns their labor, then

276
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:09,100
the collective owns your labor.

277
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:12,060
You don't own it in an individualistic, exclusive way.

278
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:15,140
There's no quiet quitting allowed when others have the right to your labor.

279
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:21,700
At the end of the day, this quiet quitting thing is example 596,872 of socialists not

280
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:25,860
understanding how capitalism works, performing capitalism as it was intended, and failing

281
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:29,660
to realize that if they lived in their system of choice, they would be shot for doing this

282
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:30,260
very thing.
