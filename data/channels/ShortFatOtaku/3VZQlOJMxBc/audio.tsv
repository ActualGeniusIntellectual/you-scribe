0	3680	Oh hey guys, you caught me at an awkward moment here.
3680	8320	I'm currently trying to tame this pet in World of Warcraft Classic.
8320	11040	That's right, World of Warcraft Classic.
11040	16720	Oh boy, I can't wait to get sucked in yet again, and completely destroy my small, burgeoning
16720	18280	YouTube career.
18280	20720	But at least this time I'll be able to do it with you guys.
20720	25280	I'm currently playing on the Mankrix server, Horde side, because what kind of pleb plays
25280	26600	Alliance?
26600	29560	Considering this is a scorpion pet, I think I know exactly what to name it.
29560	34040	Toxic Masculinity, well it doesn't fit, you know, good enough, good enough.
34040	39560	And I have an SFO guild going, named Final Fantasy XIV, but worse.
39560	43920	Yeah, everyone in Discord voted on names, and that was the name that won out.
43920	48000	It's a free to join guild, all you have to do is log in and message somebody in the guild,
48000	49000	they'll be able to invite you.
49000	52200	Or you can just ask on the SFO discord and I'm sure somebody will get you in.
52200	56000	I'm gonna try to be online most nights, maybe I'll stream it over on Twitch, maybe I'll
56000	57720	do dungeon runs with you guys.
57720	61800	You don't have to be a donator to the channel, or be a member of the five dollar club to
61800	65920	join the SFO guild, you can just come in, no problem.
65920	69720	I don't necessarily know how long this will last, I guess I'll basically keep the guild
69720	72540	going as long as there's interest from the community.
72540	74920	So come play with me guys, it'll be a lot of fun.
74920	80360	Also here, watch me solve the problem of Toxic Masculinity.
80360	88200	Yep, it's just that easy.
88200	88840	Gamers rise up.
