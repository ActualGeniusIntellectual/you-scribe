Oh hey guys, you caught me at an awkward moment here.

00:03.680 --> 00:08.320
I'm currently trying to tame this pet in World of Warcraft Classic.

00:08.320 --> 00:11.040
That's right, World of Warcraft Classic.

00:11.040 --> 00:16.720
Oh boy, I can't wait to get sucked in yet again, and completely destroy my small, burgeoning

00:16.720 --> 00:18.280
YouTube career.

00:18.280 --> 00:20.720
But at least this time I'll be able to do it with you guys.

00:20.720 --> 00:25.280
I'm currently playing on the Mankrix server, Horde side, because what kind of pleb plays

00:25.280 --> 00:26.600
Alliance?

00:26.600 --> 00:29.560
Considering this is a scorpion pet, I think I know exactly what to name it.

00:29.560 --> 00:34.040
Toxic Masculinity, well it doesn't fit, you know, good enough, good enough.

00:34.040 --> 00:39.560
And I have an SFO guild going, named Final Fantasy XIV, but worse.

00:39.560 --> 00:43.920
Yeah, everyone in Discord voted on names, and that was the name that won out.

00:43.920 --> 00:48.000
It's a free to join guild, all you have to do is log in and message somebody in the guild,

00:48.000 --> 00:49.000
they'll be able to invite you.

00:49.000 --> 00:52.200
Or you can just ask on the SFO discord and I'm sure somebody will get you in.

00:52.200 --> 00:56.000
I'm gonna try to be online most nights, maybe I'll stream it over on Twitch, maybe I'll

00:56.000 --> 00:57.720
do dungeon runs with you guys.

00:57.720 --> 01:01.800
You don't have to be a donator to the channel, or be a member of the five dollar club to

01:01.800 --> 01:05.920
join the SFO guild, you can just come in, no problem.

01:05.920 --> 01:09.720
I don't necessarily know how long this will last, I guess I'll basically keep the guild

01:09.720 --> 01:12.540
going as long as there's interest from the community.

01:12.540 --> 01:14.920
So come play with me guys, it'll be a lot of fun.

01:14.920 --> 01:20.360
Also here, watch me solve the problem of Toxic Masculinity.

01:20.360 --> 01:28.200
Yep, it's just that easy.

01:28.200 --> 01:28.840
Gamers rise up.
