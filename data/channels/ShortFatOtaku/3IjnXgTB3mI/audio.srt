1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,600
Deepfakes are back in the news, baby!

2
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:11,360
I did a video on this topic before, a few years back, when Jordan Peterson threatened

3
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:15,400
legal action against a company that was using technology to replicate his voice.

4
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:19,780
But the tech has advanced wildly since then, with new problems coming along with it.

5
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:24,280
Streamer Atriok apologizes after watching Pokemaine Deepfakes.

6
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:28,600
Earlier today, a streamer called Atriok was exposed after a clip went viral due to the

7
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:30,880
discovery of a certain tab on his PC.

8
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:35,260
The tab included the name of a website that features inappropriate deepfake images and

9
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:39,480
videos of other popular streamers such as Pokemaine and MayaHiga.

10
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:44,000
After a brief period of silence, Atriok has now confirmed these claims and has apologized

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,040
for what he says was a case of morbid curiosity.

12
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:49,280
Well, we don't gotta take this article's word for it.

13
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:50,280
Let's roll the clip.

14
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:55,980
I guess what I want to say is, uh, so I, I, I already feel deeply, I'm deeply fucking

15
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:57,480
embarrassed about this.

16
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:04,400
I'm deeply fucking embarrassed, I'm angry at myself, uh, I feel fucking, I just feel

17
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:05,400
so fucking stupid.

18
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:07,680
Dude, look at his wife in the background.

19
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:10,800
She's not sad or afraid her husband's gonna be canceled or something.

20
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:11,800
She's angry.

21
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:15,160
Apparently, Atriok and his wife are personal friends of Pokemaine and Maya.

22
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:16,160
I don't fucking know.

23
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:19,520
I don't know who any of these big time LA streamers are or any of their connections.

24
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:22,120
Apparently, he ran a business with a boyfriend of one of them or something.

25
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:25,320
The point is that they're all friends, they all run in the same circle, and his wife is

26
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:26,320
pissed.

27
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:27,320
Think about it.

28
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:31,560
When your wife discovered you had been jacking off to AI generated porn of your shared friend

29
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:32,560
group.

30
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:33,560
What a weird situation.

31
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:38,560
I've done a lot on this stream to like create a pattern of behavior where I really want,

32
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:41,200
especially women on Twitch, to feel safer.

33
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:44,240
Like I, uh, we call fucking booba spam cringe.

34
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:45,240
We don't do that there.

35
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:49,160
I've never made like a fucking weird, I don't know, sea sniffing joke.

36
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:50,240
I've never done anything like that.

37
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:54,800
I've never done anything like that on this stream and we don't tolerate any sex behavior

38
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:55,800
in the chat.

39
00:01:56,040 --> 00:02:01,920
We ban it on site and, uh, and like I've done this consistently over and over and over.

40
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:05,600
This is the difference between people who allow edgy jokes and people who don't.

41
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:08,400
I don't care about booba jokes or seat sniffing jokes.

42
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:11,200
And you're also going to find that I don't really have skeletons in my closet.

43
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,200
This is prime repressor behavior.

44
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,200
I'm sorry.

45
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,200
I'm just fucking sorry.

46
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,680
I don't, I don't support this stuff.

47
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,240
I don't believe this stuff.

48
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:21,880
I'm not like a fucking advocate in any way.

49
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:22,880
I regret it.

50
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:24,680
I would never do it as long as I live.

51
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:26,680
I'll never do it again.

52
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:31,360
This is a point that I brought up in my video on the r slash anti-work sexual abuser.

53
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,520
The difference between theory and reality.

54
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:37,000
It's very easy to say you don't do a thing and you're not for a thing after you've already

55
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
done it.

56
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,160
Actions speak louder than words.

57
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:41,640
Practice is more important than theory.

58
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:43,240
Pokimane's response was pretty simple.

59
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:45,280
Stop sexualizing people without their consent.

60
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,280
That's it.

61
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,280
That's the tweet.

62
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,120
Beyond this, I figure she'll just ignore the situation.

63
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,440
Pokimane's got doing good PR down to a science.

64
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:55,920
Amaya Higa's response is more personal, talking about how she was raped in 2018, how she's

65
00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:00,440
never done any sort of sexual content online, and how the aftermath of the whole situation

66
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:03,600
feels a lot like the aftermath of her 2018 experience.

67
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:07,400
It turns out that Cutie Cinderella was also another person deep faked on that website

68
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:10,280
by Atriok, even though most articles aren't bringing her up.

69
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:12,680
And she had quite a bit to say about it too.

70
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:14,760
Fuck the fucking internet.

71
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:18,960
Fuck the constant exploitation and objectification of women.

72
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:21,280
It's exhausting.

73
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:26,120
Fuck Atriok for showing it to thousands of people.

74
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:31,360
Fuck the people DMing me pictures of myself from that website.

75
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,360
Fuck you all.

76
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:40,180
If you are able to look at women who are not selling themselves or benefiting off of being

77
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:45,040
seen sexually, they're not benefiting, they're not selling it, they're not platforming it

78
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,120
themselves.

79
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:50,020
If you are able to look at that, you are the problem.

80
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:52,020
You see women as an object.

81
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:55,340
You should not be okay doing that.

82
00:03:55,340 --> 00:04:02,620
And it should not be a part of my job to have to pay money to get this stuff taken down.

83
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:07,820
It should not be part of my job to be harassed, to see pictures of me nude spread around.

84
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:10,500
It should not be something that is found on the internet.

85
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:11,500
It shouldn't be.

86
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:13,820
That shouldn't be a part of my job.

87
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:17,820
And the fact that it is, is exhausting.

88
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:24,460
And to the person that made that website, I'm going to fucking sue you.

89
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:27,140
Now, I don't know if she's going to actually be able to sue the website.

90
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:29,340
I don't know what the legality is regarding deepfakes.

91
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:33,500
Because it's not really the girl, it's somebody else, with the girl's face AI generated onto

92
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:34,500
the body.

93
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:37,540
I'm sure this is yet another instance where lawmakers are falling behind technology.

94
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:40,420
But to be honest, the legal conversation isn't all that interesting.

95
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:43,540
What's more interesting is, are deepfakes moral?

96
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:45,180
Intuitively, they don't feel moral.

97
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:49,060
There's something wrong there, even if it feels a bit less than, say, revenge porn.

98
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:50,060
But why is that?

99
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:52,020
What's at the bottom of that knee-jerk feeling?

100
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:53,820
Let's run down some possibilities.

101
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:58,860
Is it just the fact that Atrock is friends with Pokimane and Mayahiga and Cutie Cinderella?

102
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:00,220
That certainly makes it more weird.

103
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:01,860
You're betraying a friendship, for sure.

104
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:04,580
Is it still immoral if you're not related to the people at all?

105
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:08,380
Like, if you or I, people who don't know any of these e-girls at all, if we look at their

106
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:10,020
deepfakes, is that bad?

107
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:12,740
It feels kind of bad, but not as bad as their friend doing it.

108
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:15,060
Certainly not as bad if we keep it a secret rather than sharing them.

109
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:18,860
It also feels like it's worse if we're actually masturbating to them rather than looking at

110
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:20,740
them out of a sense of morbid curiosity.

111
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:23,260
And to be clear, I have seen at least the Pokimane deepfakes.

112
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:25,460
I didn't find them appealing, only strange.

113
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:29,300
Pokimane, Mayahiga, and Cutie Cinderella are all attractive women on the internet.

114
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:33,580
But it's not like they do hyper-sexualized thirst trap content, like Amaranth or Denims

115
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:35,300
or the OK Boomer girl.

116
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:36,980
Those women know specifically what they're doing.

117
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:39,200
They're attracting simps by flaunting their sexuality.

118
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:43,620
They are openly, publicly sexual in a way that the previous set of e-girls were not.

119
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:46,980
Even though they're not doing open pornography on Pornhub or something.

120
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:50,500
Considering that these girls are specifically out there marketing their attractiveness as

121
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:54,620
their prime asset while still not showing it all on camera, is it immoral to look at

122
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:56,880
the deepfakes of them instead?

123
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:00,520
My intuition tells me again, if it is, it's a lot less immoral because they're already

124
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:02,500
putting themselves out there in that manner.

125
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:05,820
They have to know their young male audience is already jacking off to pictures of them

126
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:06,860
or streams of them.

127
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:10,780
Is a deepfake really all that different from them imagining them having sex?

128
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:12,300
I mean, yeah, it kind of is.

129
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:14,580
Because it's that imagined scene made real.

130
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:16,820
At least real enough to possibly share it around.

131
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:19,880
But again, it's not like it's the body of the actual girl in question.

132
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:22,300
And then you think, what about actual porn actresses?

133
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:26,620
Like right now, you can go watch a video of Mia Khalifa doing basically whatever you want

134
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:27,660
over on Pornhub.

135
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:30,100
Is it immoral to deepfake Mia Khalifa?

136
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:31,600
At that point, the answer seems to be no.

137
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,460
You can already see her doing that stuff herself.

138
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:36,380
But even if it's not immoral, it's certainly weird, isn't it?

139
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:37,380
What's the source of the weirdness?

140
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:40,500
I mean, the friendship angle is a possible source of the weirdness, like with Atriok

141
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:41,780
and his deepfaked friends.

142
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:45,900
Personally, I know like six people who have all done real porn, not deepfaked, including

143
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:47,580
two girls I knew in school.

144
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:49,580
And again, out of curiosity, I've looked at their porn.

145
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:51,020
It was definitely strange to watch.

146
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:52,380
I couldn't really enjoy it.

147
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:54,560
But presumably, none of us know Mia Khalifa personally.

148
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:58,720
So why does it feel a little bit odd to deepfake her face onto a different porn star's body

149
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,060
when she already does porn?

150
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:04,260
All of these incongruencies are pointing at something we haven't uncovered yet.

151
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:08,220
When you look at a Pokimane deepfake, it's not like you're actually seeing Pokimane naked.

152
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:11,280
You're seeing a different woman with Pokimane's face put on top of it.

153
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:14,780
It's just a more sophisticated version of taking a picture of a naked girl and lazily

154
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:17,080
photoshopping somebody else's head on top.

155
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:20,800
Does the immorality stem from the sophistication of the deepfake, such that it's done well

156
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,520
enough you don't actually know it's fake anymore?

157
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:26,360
Well, that doesn't sound right either, because Atriok literally ordered these images from

158
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:27,560
a deepfake website.

159
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:31,000
Torrents of deepfakes online are labeled as deepfakes.

160
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,580
If you know it's a deepfake, then you know it's not real.

161
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:37,340
It's not like the Kardashian blowjob leak where it was actually a real image and everyone

162
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:38,340
knew it.

163
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:45,200
Some of you might be old enough to remember Sarah Palin's rise to prominence in 2008,

164
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:47,420
as John McCain's running mate against Obama.

165
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:52,100
Even though this happened 15 years ago, you could still find crude sexual photoshops of

166
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:53,100
her.

167
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:54,500
Nobody on the left complained back then, by the way.

168
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:59,440
And there were even Sarah Palin lookalikes doing full porn shoots acting as Sarah Palin.

169
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,440
Was that immoral?

170
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:04,140
Okay, even if you think that porn itself is immoral, was it any extra immoral because

171
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:06,300
they were taking on the persona of a real person?

172
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:07,300
In this case, I don't think so.

173
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:09,300
If anything, it just seems funny, like it's a joke.

174
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:13,540
When Rule 34 of Egoraptor and JonTron was made during the height of Game Grumps, they

175
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:15,180
also took it as a joke when they saw it.

176
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:18,000
Okay, so what if you had a twin, and that twin did porn?

177
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,200
Would you feel violated?

178
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,820
Probably not, because the twin's their own person.

179
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:24,500
For example, I don't know if you know this, but Egoraptor's wife, Mortimer, is a twin.

180
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:28,380
If Mortimer's twin sister did porn, would the fans of Game Grumps consider that to be

181
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:29,540
Mortimer porn?

182
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:34,300
Would she feel violated and publicly humiliated, as if it were the same thing as Mortimer deepfake

183
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:35,300
porn?

184
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:36,300
Probably not.

185
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:40,260
The accuracy of that porn to Mortimer's own body would likely be a lot closer than

186
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:41,500
any deepfake.

187
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:45,340
This leads me to believe that it's not about how accurate the deepfake is, how believable

188
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:48,380
it is to the viewer that it might be the actual person.

189
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:49,900
It's more about identity.

190
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:53,760
We know that the porn star playing the role of Sarah Palin isn't actually Sarah Palin.

191
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:56,680
We know that Mortimer's twin sister isn't actually Mortimer.

192
00:08:56,680 --> 00:09:00,180
These people have their own identities underneath the role that they're playing.

193
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:04,020
But unless you recognize the specific porn that the deepfake is taken from, we don't

194
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:06,020
know who's underneath Pokeman's face.

195
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:08,300
There's a depersonalizing aspect at play.

196
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:13,020
While actors and twins only adopt an identity temporarily, deepfakes are simulations of

197
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:14,020
an identity.

198
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:17,900
If I built a perfectly accurate synthetic robot that looks exactly like Pokemane, and

199
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:22,980
then had the robot do Pokemane porn, would that be as violating as Pokemane deepfakes?

200
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:27,200
The answer, intuitively, seems to be yes, because there's no underlying identity there

201
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,460
showing to the viewer that the whole thing's just an act.

202
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:33,740
In fact, the whole thing is just the simulated, stolen identity of Pokemane.

203
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:37,980
We view identity in this way because identity is not only contained in the self, but it

204
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:41,380
exists in the minds of others, a lesson you really should have learned decades ago from

205
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:42,380
Evangelion.

206
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:45,660
Deepfakes seem to be immoral not because people might think you're having sex on camera

207
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:48,820
when you really didn't, but because it's a hijacking of your identity in a way that

208
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:52,740
is wholly out of your control, not based on your self-presentation or on the quality

209
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:55,420
of your behaviors, but simply on the whims of another person.

210
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:58,580
It's kind of like when you're not a slut, but somebody who hates you spreads the rumor

211
00:09:58,580 --> 00:10:01,940
that you are a slut, and then you feel off when the rumor gets back to you, because it's

212
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:03,340
not actually based on who you are.

213
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:05,620
Though with deepfakes it's a lot more serious, obviously.

214
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:09,560
By the way, the fact that deepfakes bother people so much, and that the whole thing seems

215
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:13,860
to be rooted in identity, is pretty much the final nail in the coffin for the self-identification

216
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:14,860
crowd.

217
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:18,660
If you truly could self-ID, if you alone had sovereign dominion over your identity, a deepfake

218
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:19,660
wouldn't threaten you.

219
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:20,700
But that's not how the world works.

220
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:22,940
Our identity is only partially within us.

221
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:26,980
It's also partially within the minds of other people, based on their observation of your

222
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:28,540
presentation and behaviors.

223
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:31,620
A deepfake is violating because it's out of your control.

224
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:33,860
There wasn't anything you could have done differently to prevent it.

225
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:37,700
But for that to be true, it means that your self-ID actually doesn't matter all that

226
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:38,700
much on its own.

227
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:42,620
Here's an example, and I don't even have to dive into the trans question, or the deepfake

228
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:43,820
question, to get my point across.

229
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:46,340
I have old 4chan nudes of nanners.

230
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:50,500
From back before she was a vtuber, back before she was a woke scold, back when she was an

231
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:54,900
18 year old edgelord posting tits on B. She's made it very known multiple times that she

232
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:57,920
disavows her old past, and regrets putting those nudes out there.

233
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:00,660
Am I under any moral obligation to delete them?

234
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:01,700
I'm not sure.

235
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:04,540
The consent of the present doesn't eliminate the consent of the past.

236
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:08,500
She still did those things, she was still that person, that's still part of her identity,

237
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:09,940
even if she doesn't like it now.

238
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:13,780
Treating that identity like it once existed, because it did, isn't immoral, even if she

239
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:15,340
currently finds it uncomfortable.

240
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:18,720
I talked yesterday about the constant interconnectedness of the left.

241
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:21,780
I guess another way in which they're hypocritical is when they want to shed their connections

242
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:22,920
to their past self.

243
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:27,260
I think this whole conversation revolves not around creating realistic porn of an e-girl

244
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:31,380
who wouldn't have done porn otherwise, but instead around identity insecurity.

245
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:34,660
And that's not an insult, being insecure about your identity is pretty reasonable.

246
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:38,660
This topic hooks into the larger AI conversation we're having right now, where both artists

247
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:43,260
and the consumers of art are getting weird about AI producing art that is actually competent.

248
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:47,540
Where people are talking to chatbots that are actually able to have somewhat in-depth

249
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:48,540
conversations.

250
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:52,820
We are well past the days of 4chan turning Tay into a neo-nazi for lulz.

251
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:57,000
Imagine the cockshottian AI socialist future, where central planning is actually possible

252
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:01,060
and efficient because hyper-intelligent AI has harvested all data about every single

253
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:05,600
human's market preferences and can now efficiently allocate resources to each person based on

254
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:06,680
their desires.

255
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:09,280
In that world, would you even have a sense of self anymore?

256
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:11,480
No more privacy, no more independence or individual ownership?

257
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:13,280
Would a deepfake even matter?

258
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:17,560
The objection to deepfakes here is based in privacy and individualism, two things that

259
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:19,820
political extremists are not so fond of.

260
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:23,560
That cockshot future, wherein AI is at the head of civilization, implements a command

261
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:27,320
economy, collectivizes all property, and promotes constant hedonistic behavior to pass

262
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:32,040
the time, is presented in the kind of incredible, kind of underwhelming 2020 TV adaptation of

263
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:33,040
Brave New World.

264
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:36,840
In this interpretation of Huxley's most famous story, a one-world government is controlled

265
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:40,900
by a computer program called Indra, which directs all economic activity for what it

266
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:42,520
determines is everyone's benefit.

267
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:46,400
Nobody has locks on their doors, and anybody can come into your place anytime they like.

268
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:50,200
Everyone wears implants on their eye that allows them to mentally connect with any other

269
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:53,600
person, see through their eyes, and experience what they're thinking, feeling, and doing.

270
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:57,640
The concept of exclusivity in your property, in your relationships, in your thoughts, is

271
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:59,000
considered offensive.

272
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:03,120
In this completely collectivized world, where privacy has been abolished, and everyone and

273
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:07,120
everything is everybody's to enjoy, would a deepfake even matter?

274
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:11,280
If you can just go out and fuck anyone anyway, and you always can because everyone always

275
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:14,200
says yes all the time to anyone, then who cares about deepfakes?

276
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:16,160
It's a TV show, not real life, I know.

277
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:18,200
But I'm bringing it up for a specific reason.

278
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:23,080
As our real world becomes more and more interconnected, as concepts like privacy and exclusivity are

279
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:28,320
dismantled inch by inch by the one-two punch of progressive hedonism and socialist collectivization,

280
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:31,520
the deepfake problem was always going to come up eventually.

281
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:35,960
I mentioned earlier that two girls from my school ended up in porn after graduation.

282
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:39,420
That was considered an exceptionally high number for someone who went to high school

283
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:40,420
in the 2000s.

284
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:42,320
What are those numbers like nowadays?

285
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:45,600
It really does seem like the percentage of girls who get into some sort of lewd industry

286
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,680
is way higher than it was a decade or two ago.

287
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:49,860
It's probably not as many as the Red Pillars think.

288
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:53,680
I remember on Fresh and Fit a little bit ago, one of those guys said that something like

289
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:58,360
40% of college girls are getting flown out to the Middle East to turn into Dubai porta-potties.

290
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:00,880
A girl going to Kansas City is not getting flown out to Dubai.

291
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:01,880
Yes she is bro!

292
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:02,880
No.

293
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:03,880
Look at today!

294
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:04,880
Tonight!

295
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:05,880
You guys are wild.

296
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:06,880
You guys are wild.

297
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:07,880
You're coping man.

298
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:10,700
I just want to hear, for the record, for you three to answer this.

299
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:14,600
What percentage of college women do you think are being flown around the world to fuck?

300
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:15,600
Very little.

301
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:16,600
Very little.

302
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:17,600
I want to hear.

303
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:23,360
I'll feel like probability-wise, if I argue, maybe like 30, 40, 50.

304
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:24,360
Holy shit.

305
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:27,200
You've got to be living in a whole other dimension to think this dude.

306
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,640
There's no fucking way it's that high.

307
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:32,880
But the number of girls who hit 18 and immediately do some sort of porn, OnlyFans, thirst trapping

308
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:36,440
on Instagram or Twitch or something has got to be higher than it's ever been, considering

309
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:40,600
how easy to do and how culturally normalized that sort of thing has become.

310
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:45,000
Even beyond porn, our culture has become way more sexually permissive at a rapid pace.

311
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:49,320
Scott Pilgrim came out in the late 2000s, and at that time, a 24-year-old woman having

312
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:53,440
seven previous sexual partners was considered a comically large number.

313
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:57,060
Nowadays, you'd be lucky to find a 24-year-old with that exact sexual history.

314
00:14:57,060 --> 00:14:59,120
By the way, I'm not casting a value judgment here.

315
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,640
I'm not saying whether this is good or bad.

316
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:02,200
I'm simply saying that it is.

317
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:06,120
And the reason I'm describing it is because as the world moves more leftward, the very

318
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:09,000
concept of privacy is becoming a thing of the past.

319
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:13,160
As promiscuous sexuality becomes more culturally permissible, things that used to be kept private

320
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:17,340
are now flaunted openly in the name of pride, far beyond gay or trans pride.

321
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:21,040
As socialism moves more into the forefront, individualism is viewed as a relic of the

322
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:25,200
past, as a part of liberalism that was once crazy and revolutionary but now needs to be

323
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:27,760
abolished for the collectivization to begin.

324
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:31,560
It is no wonder that in this political environment, we are starting to see the dismantling of

325
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:32,920
privacy itself.

326
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:36,440
No private property, no private speech, no private thoughts, no private information,

327
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:37,840
no private lives.

328
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:41,580
From stuff like tracking or harvesting data, to cancel culture, to the expectation that

329
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:45,180
you always be available to work even when off the clock, to central planning, to corporate

330
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:50,780
ESG scores, to always-on, always-connected electronic devices, and yes, to sexual promiscuity,

331
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:54,880
the thread that ties all of this stuff together is the abolishment of privacy.

332
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:58,820
The fact that your average leftoid is pro some of these things and anti others is a

333
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:02,680
testament to how poorly thought out their everything-should-be-connected ethic actually

334
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:03,680
is.

335
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:07,400
In this context, it's no wonder we're grappling with moral issues surrounding deepfakes.

336
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:11,300
I have a feeling that within my lifetime, deepfakes of everyone will be normalized as

337
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:14,420
just a new part of the next generation's sexual morality, after the zoomers have hit

338
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:15,420
middle age.

339
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:18,020
Yeah, I know you probably clicked on this video looking for some laughs about Atriok

340
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:19,020
and the drama.

341
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:20,020
Well, you should have known better.

342
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:21,260
His story isn't actually that interesting.

343
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:24,660
He's a retard who thought it was a good idea to special order deepfake porn of a streamer

344
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:28,660
e-girlfriends, and then continued to be retarded because he didn't do that shit on a non-business

345
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:31,620
computer, or at least fucking close the tabs before he went live.

346
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:35,120
There's actually not much to it beyond that, though the clip of him saying that anybody

347
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:38,380
could be scummy in private is pretty funny, all things considered.

348
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:42,580
But do remember that all the creators you watch online could be pieces of shit like

349
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:46,860
this behind closed doors, but we are all forced to be good and play nice because we want to

350
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:47,860
keep our jobs.

351
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:52,640
The real conversation here is the slow creeping move to abolish privacy itself.

352
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:55,960
For something to be private, it has to be exclusive to only the people who have access

353
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:56,960
to it.

354
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:59,300
It has to be particular to only the people who are interested in it.

355
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:00,560
It has to be gatekept.

356
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:04,620
But inclusivity, universality, and interconnectedness are the values of the left.

357
00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:08,200
Whether we're talking about the replaceability of cultures and populations to the collectivization

358
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:12,400
of all property to the abolishment of both monogamy and gender, everything to these people

359
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:15,640
is fungible, and privacy is a value that stands in the way.

360
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:20,400
That's why, despite the current drama, deepfakes are ultimately permissible within the leftist

361
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,400
framework.

362
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:25,080
Because once you arrive at their natural endpoint, it's just another naked woman among millions.

363
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:26,080
Who cares?

364
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:30,900
Inclusivity, universality, and interconnectedness all lead to replaceability, and replaceability

365
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:33,520
leads to the idea that there's nothing special about you at all.

366
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:37,600
To object to that, to say that your sexual activity shouldn't be inclusive or universal

367
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:39,840
or collectivized, is to say that it should be private.

368
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:42,840
You're an individual, not a random number among millions.

369
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:46,600
Appealing to privacy here necessarily takes you outside of the leftist framework, at least

370
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:50,540
philosophically, because you are demanding separation instead of connection, particularity

371
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:55,320
over replaceability, and exclusive individuality over the inclusivity of the masses.

372
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:59,640
The only solid moral objections to deepfakes are grounded in consent.

373
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:03,320
Consent is grounded in privacy, and as long as the left wants to abolish privacy, they

374
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:07,120
will always create an environment where deepfakes, along with a lot of other terrible sexual

375
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:08,800
behaviors, is permissible.

376
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:13,240
Their talk about valuing consent is simply paying lip service to a popular idea.

377
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:17,580
If the consequentialist end is good enough, they have no problem violating consent.

378
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:19,960
Your average left-leaning person doesn't understand this philosophy.

379
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:22,920
They don't even mean to promote this stuff, I don't think.

380
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:26,220
But hey, it wouldn't be the first time that some idiot believed that they could centrally

381
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:30,440
plan all of society, and it backfired in their face with catastrophic consequences.
