00:00.000 --> 00:07.600
Deepfakes are back in the news, baby!

00:07.600 --> 00:11.360
I did a video on this topic before, a few years back, when Jordan Peterson threatened

00:11.360 --> 00:15.400
legal action against a company that was using technology to replicate his voice.

00:15.400 --> 00:19.780
But the tech has advanced wildly since then, with new problems coming along with it.

00:19.780 --> 00:24.280
Streamer Atriok apologizes after watching Pokemaine Deepfakes.

00:24.280 --> 00:28.600
Earlier today, a streamer called Atriok was exposed after a clip went viral due to the

00:28.600 --> 00:30.880
discovery of a certain tab on his PC.

00:30.880 --> 00:35.260
The tab included the name of a website that features inappropriate deepfake images and

00:35.260 --> 00:39.480
videos of other popular streamers such as Pokemaine and MayaHiga.

00:39.480 --> 00:44.000
After a brief period of silence, Atriok has now confirmed these claims and has apologized

00:44.000 --> 00:46.040
for what he says was a case of morbid curiosity.

00:46.040 --> 00:49.280
Well, we don't gotta take this article's word for it.

00:49.280 --> 00:50.280
Let's roll the clip.

00:50.280 --> 00:55.980
I guess what I want to say is, uh, so I, I, I already feel deeply, I'm deeply fucking

00:55.980 --> 00:57.480
embarrassed about this.

00:57.480 --> 01:04.400
I'm deeply fucking embarrassed, I'm angry at myself, uh, I feel fucking, I just feel

01:04.400 --> 01:05.400
so fucking stupid.

01:05.400 --> 01:07.680
Dude, look at his wife in the background.

01:07.680 --> 01:10.800
She's not sad or afraid her husband's gonna be canceled or something.

01:10.800 --> 01:11.800
She's angry.

01:11.800 --> 01:15.160
Apparently, Atriok and his wife are personal friends of Pokemaine and Maya.

01:15.160 --> 01:16.160
I don't fucking know.

01:16.160 --> 01:19.520
I don't know who any of these big time LA streamers are or any of their connections.

01:19.520 --> 01:22.120
Apparently, he ran a business with a boyfriend of one of them or something.

01:22.120 --> 01:25.320
The point is that they're all friends, they all run in the same circle, and his wife is

01:25.320 --> 01:26.320
pissed.

01:26.320 --> 01:27.320
Think about it.

01:27.360 --> 01:31.560
When your wife discovered you had been jacking off to AI generated porn of your shared friend

01:31.560 --> 01:32.560
group.

01:32.560 --> 01:33.560
What a weird situation.

01:33.560 --> 01:38.560
I've done a lot on this stream to like create a pattern of behavior where I really want,

01:38.560 --> 01:41.200
especially women on Twitch, to feel safer.

01:41.200 --> 01:44.240
Like I, uh, we call fucking booba spam cringe.

01:44.240 --> 01:45.240
We don't do that there.

01:45.240 --> 01:49.160
I've never made like a fucking weird, I don't know, sea sniffing joke.

01:49.160 --> 01:50.240
I've never done anything like that.

01:50.240 --> 01:54.800
I've never done anything like that on this stream and we don't tolerate any sex behavior

01:54.800 --> 01:55.800
in the chat.

01:56.040 --> 02:01.920
We ban it on site and, uh, and like I've done this consistently over and over and over.

02:01.920 --> 02:05.600
This is the difference between people who allow edgy jokes and people who don't.

02:05.600 --> 02:08.400
I don't care about booba jokes or seat sniffing jokes.

02:08.400 --> 02:11.200
And you're also going to find that I don't really have skeletons in my closet.

02:11.200 --> 02:13.200
This is prime repressor behavior.

02:13.200 --> 02:14.200
I'm sorry.

02:14.200 --> 02:15.200
I'm just fucking sorry.

02:15.200 --> 02:17.680
I don't, I don't support this stuff.

02:17.680 --> 02:19.240
I don't believe this stuff.

02:19.240 --> 02:21.880
I'm not like a fucking advocate in any way.

02:21.880 --> 02:22.880
I regret it.

02:22.880 --> 02:24.680
I would never do it as long as I live.

02:24.920 --> 02:26.680
I'll never do it again.

02:26.680 --> 02:31.360
This is a point that I brought up in my video on the r slash anti-work sexual abuser.

02:31.360 --> 02:33.520
The difference between theory and reality.

02:33.520 --> 02:37.000
It's very easy to say you don't do a thing and you're not for a thing after you've already

02:37.000 --> 02:38.000
done it.

02:38.000 --> 02:39.160
Actions speak louder than words.

02:39.160 --> 02:41.640
Practice is more important than theory.

02:41.640 --> 02:43.240
Pokimane's response was pretty simple.

02:43.240 --> 02:45.280
Stop sexualizing people without their consent.

02:45.280 --> 02:46.280
That's it.

02:46.280 --> 02:47.280
That's the tweet.

02:47.280 --> 02:49.120
Beyond this, I figure she'll just ignore the situation.

02:49.120 --> 02:51.440
Pokimane's got doing good PR down to a science.

02:51.440 --> 02:55.920
Amaya Higa's response is more personal, talking about how she was raped in 2018, how she's

02:55.920 --> 03:00.440
never done any sort of sexual content online, and how the aftermath of the whole situation

03:00.440 --> 03:03.600
feels a lot like the aftermath of her 2018 experience.

03:03.600 --> 03:07.400
It turns out that Cutie Cinderella was also another person deep faked on that website

03:07.400 --> 03:10.280
by Atriok, even though most articles aren't bringing her up.

03:10.280 --> 03:12.680
And she had quite a bit to say about it too.

03:12.680 --> 03:14.760
Fuck the fucking internet.

03:14.760 --> 03:18.960
Fuck the constant exploitation and objectification of women.

03:18.960 --> 03:21.280
It's exhausting.

03:21.280 --> 03:26.120
Fuck Atriok for showing it to thousands of people.

03:26.120 --> 03:31.360
Fuck the people DMing me pictures of myself from that website.

03:31.360 --> 03:32.360
Fuck you all.

03:32.360 --> 03:40.180
If you are able to look at women who are not selling themselves or benefiting off of being

03:40.180 --> 03:45.040
seen sexually, they're not benefiting, they're not selling it, they're not platforming it

03:45.040 --> 03:46.120
themselves.

03:46.120 --> 03:50.020
If you are able to look at that, you are the problem.

03:50.020 --> 03:52.020
You see women as an object.

03:52.020 --> 03:55.340
You should not be okay doing that.

03:55.340 --> 04:02.620
And it should not be a part of my job to have to pay money to get this stuff taken down.

04:02.620 --> 04:07.820
It should not be part of my job to be harassed, to see pictures of me nude spread around.

04:07.820 --> 04:10.500
It should not be something that is found on the internet.

04:10.500 --> 04:11.500
It shouldn't be.

04:11.500 --> 04:13.820
That shouldn't be a part of my job.

04:13.820 --> 04:17.820
And the fact that it is, is exhausting.

04:17.820 --> 04:24.460
And to the person that made that website, I'm going to fucking sue you.

04:24.460 --> 04:27.140
Now, I don't know if she's going to actually be able to sue the website.

04:27.140 --> 04:29.340
I don't know what the legality is regarding deepfakes.

04:29.340 --> 04:33.500
Because it's not really the girl, it's somebody else, with the girl's face AI generated onto

04:33.500 --> 04:34.500
the body.

04:34.500 --> 04:37.540
I'm sure this is yet another instance where lawmakers are falling behind technology.

04:37.540 --> 04:40.420
But to be honest, the legal conversation isn't all that interesting.

04:40.420 --> 04:43.540
What's more interesting is, are deepfakes moral?

04:43.540 --> 04:45.180
Intuitively, they don't feel moral.

04:45.180 --> 04:49.060
There's something wrong there, even if it feels a bit less than, say, revenge porn.

04:49.060 --> 04:50.060
But why is that?

04:50.060 --> 04:52.020
What's at the bottom of that knee-jerk feeling?

04:52.020 --> 04:53.820
Let's run down some possibilities.

04:53.820 --> 04:58.860
Is it just the fact that Atrock is friends with Pokimane and Mayahiga and Cutie Cinderella?

04:58.860 --> 05:00.220
That certainly makes it more weird.

05:00.220 --> 05:01.860
You're betraying a friendship, for sure.

05:01.860 --> 05:04.580
Is it still immoral if you're not related to the people at all?

05:04.580 --> 05:08.380
Like, if you or I, people who don't know any of these e-girls at all, if we look at their

05:08.380 --> 05:10.020
deepfakes, is that bad?

05:10.020 --> 05:12.740
It feels kind of bad, but not as bad as their friend doing it.

05:12.740 --> 05:15.060
Certainly not as bad if we keep it a secret rather than sharing them.

05:15.060 --> 05:18.860
It also feels like it's worse if we're actually masturbating to them rather than looking at

05:18.860 --> 05:20.740
them out of a sense of morbid curiosity.

05:20.740 --> 05:23.260
And to be clear, I have seen at least the Pokimane deepfakes.

05:23.260 --> 05:25.460
I didn't find them appealing, only strange.

05:25.460 --> 05:29.300
Pokimane, Mayahiga, and Cutie Cinderella are all attractive women on the internet.

05:29.300 --> 05:33.580
But it's not like they do hyper-sexualized thirst trap content, like Amaranth or Denims

05:33.580 --> 05:35.300
or the OK Boomer girl.

05:35.300 --> 05:36.980
Those women know specifically what they're doing.

05:36.980 --> 05:39.200
They're attracting simps by flaunting their sexuality.

05:39.200 --> 05:43.620
They are openly, publicly sexual in a way that the previous set of e-girls were not.

05:43.620 --> 05:46.980
Even though they're not doing open pornography on Pornhub or something.

05:46.980 --> 05:50.500
Considering that these girls are specifically out there marketing their attractiveness as

05:50.500 --> 05:54.620
their prime asset while still not showing it all on camera, is it immoral to look at

05:54.620 --> 05:56.880
the deepfakes of them instead?

05:56.880 --> 06:00.520
My intuition tells me again, if it is, it's a lot less immoral because they're already

06:00.520 --> 06:02.500
putting themselves out there in that manner.

06:02.500 --> 06:05.820
They have to know their young male audience is already jacking off to pictures of them

06:05.820 --> 06:06.860
or streams of them.

06:06.860 --> 06:10.780
Is a deepfake really all that different from them imagining them having sex?

06:10.780 --> 06:12.300
I mean, yeah, it kind of is.

06:12.300 --> 06:14.580
Because it's that imagined scene made real.

06:14.580 --> 06:16.820
At least real enough to possibly share it around.

06:16.820 --> 06:19.880
But again, it's not like it's the body of the actual girl in question.

06:19.880 --> 06:22.300
And then you think, what about actual porn actresses?

06:22.300 --> 06:26.620
Like right now, you can go watch a video of Mia Khalifa doing basically whatever you want

06:26.620 --> 06:27.660
over on Pornhub.

06:27.660 --> 06:30.100
Is it immoral to deepfake Mia Khalifa?

06:30.100 --> 06:31.600
At that point, the answer seems to be no.

06:31.600 --> 06:33.460
You can already see her doing that stuff herself.

06:33.460 --> 06:36.380
But even if it's not immoral, it's certainly weird, isn't it?

06:36.380 --> 06:37.380
What's the source of the weirdness?

06:37.380 --> 06:40.500
I mean, the friendship angle is a possible source of the weirdness, like with Atriok

06:40.500 --> 06:41.780
and his deepfaked friends.

06:41.780 --> 06:45.900
Personally, I know like six people who have all done real porn, not deepfaked, including

06:45.900 --> 06:47.580
two girls I knew in school.

06:47.580 --> 06:49.580
And again, out of curiosity, I've looked at their porn.

06:49.580 --> 06:51.020
It was definitely strange to watch.

06:51.020 --> 06:52.380
I couldn't really enjoy it.

06:52.380 --> 06:54.560
But presumably, none of us know Mia Khalifa personally.

06:54.560 --> 06:58.720
So why does it feel a little bit odd to deepfake her face onto a different porn star's body

06:58.720 --> 07:00.060
when she already does porn?

07:00.060 --> 07:04.260
All of these incongruencies are pointing at something we haven't uncovered yet.

07:04.260 --> 07:08.220
When you look at a Pokimane deepfake, it's not like you're actually seeing Pokimane naked.

07:08.220 --> 07:11.280
You're seeing a different woman with Pokimane's face put on top of it.

07:11.280 --> 07:14.780
It's just a more sophisticated version of taking a picture of a naked girl and lazily

07:14.780 --> 07:17.080
photoshopping somebody else's head on top.

07:17.080 --> 07:20.800
Does the immorality stem from the sophistication of the deepfake, such that it's done well

07:20.800 --> 07:22.520
enough you don't actually know it's fake anymore?

07:22.520 --> 07:26.360
Well, that doesn't sound right either, because Atriok literally ordered these images from

07:26.360 --> 07:27.560
a deepfake website.

07:27.560 --> 07:31.000
Torrents of deepfakes online are labeled as deepfakes.

07:31.000 --> 07:33.580
If you know it's a deepfake, then you know it's not real.

07:33.580 --> 07:37.340
It's not like the Kardashian blowjob leak where it was actually a real image and everyone

07:37.340 --> 07:38.340
knew it.

07:38.340 --> 07:45.200
Some of you might be old enough to remember Sarah Palin's rise to prominence in 2008,

07:45.200 --> 07:47.420
as John McCain's running mate against Obama.

07:47.420 --> 07:52.100
Even though this happened 15 years ago, you could still find crude sexual photoshops of

07:52.100 --> 07:53.100
her.

07:53.100 --> 07:54.500
Nobody on the left complained back then, by the way.

07:54.500 --> 07:59.440
And there were even Sarah Palin lookalikes doing full porn shoots acting as Sarah Palin.

07:59.440 --> 08:00.440
Was that immoral?

08:00.440 --> 08:04.140
Okay, even if you think that porn itself is immoral, was it any extra immoral because

08:04.140 --> 08:06.300
they were taking on the persona of a real person?

08:06.300 --> 08:07.300
In this case, I don't think so.

08:07.300 --> 08:09.300
If anything, it just seems funny, like it's a joke.

08:09.300 --> 08:13.540
When Rule 34 of Egoraptor and JonTron was made during the height of Game Grumps, they

08:13.540 --> 08:15.180
also took it as a joke when they saw it.

08:15.180 --> 08:18.000
Okay, so what if you had a twin, and that twin did porn?

08:18.000 --> 08:19.200
Would you feel violated?

08:19.200 --> 08:20.820
Probably not, because the twin's their own person.

08:20.820 --> 08:24.500
For example, I don't know if you know this, but Egoraptor's wife, Mortimer, is a twin.

08:24.500 --> 08:28.380
If Mortimer's twin sister did porn, would the fans of Game Grumps consider that to be

08:28.380 --> 08:29.540
Mortimer porn?

08:29.540 --> 08:34.300
Would she feel violated and publicly humiliated, as if it were the same thing as Mortimer deepfake

08:34.300 --> 08:35.300
porn?

08:35.300 --> 08:36.300
Probably not.

08:36.300 --> 08:40.260
The accuracy of that porn to Mortimer's own body would likely be a lot closer than

08:40.260 --> 08:41.500
any deepfake.

08:41.500 --> 08:45.340
This leads me to believe that it's not about how accurate the deepfake is, how believable

08:45.340 --> 08:48.380
it is to the viewer that it might be the actual person.

08:48.380 --> 08:49.900
It's more about identity.

08:49.900 --> 08:53.760
We know that the porn star playing the role of Sarah Palin isn't actually Sarah Palin.

08:53.760 --> 08:56.680
We know that Mortimer's twin sister isn't actually Mortimer.

08:56.680 --> 09:00.180
These people have their own identities underneath the role that they're playing.

09:00.180 --> 09:04.020
But unless you recognize the specific porn that the deepfake is taken from, we don't

09:04.020 --> 09:06.020
know who's underneath Pokeman's face.

09:06.020 --> 09:08.300
There's a depersonalizing aspect at play.

09:08.300 --> 09:13.020
While actors and twins only adopt an identity temporarily, deepfakes are simulations of

09:13.020 --> 09:14.020
an identity.

09:14.020 --> 09:17.900
If I built a perfectly accurate synthetic robot that looks exactly like Pokemane, and

09:17.900 --> 09:22.980
then had the robot do Pokemane porn, would that be as violating as Pokemane deepfakes?

09:22.980 --> 09:27.200
The answer, intuitively, seems to be yes, because there's no underlying identity there

09:27.200 --> 09:29.460
showing to the viewer that the whole thing's just an act.

09:29.460 --> 09:33.740
In fact, the whole thing is just the simulated, stolen identity of Pokemane.

09:33.740 --> 09:37.980
We view identity in this way because identity is not only contained in the self, but it

09:37.980 --> 09:41.380
exists in the minds of others, a lesson you really should have learned decades ago from

09:41.380 --> 09:42.380
Evangelion.

09:42.380 --> 09:45.660
Deepfakes seem to be immoral not because people might think you're having sex on camera

09:45.660 --> 09:48.820
when you really didn't, but because it's a hijacking of your identity in a way that

09:48.820 --> 09:52.740
is wholly out of your control, not based on your self-presentation or on the quality

09:52.740 --> 09:55.420
of your behaviors, but simply on the whims of another person.

09:55.420 --> 09:58.580
It's kind of like when you're not a slut, but somebody who hates you spreads the rumor

09:58.580 --> 10:01.940
that you are a slut, and then you feel off when the rumor gets back to you, because it's

10:01.940 --> 10:03.340
not actually based on who you are.

10:03.340 --> 10:05.620
Though with deepfakes it's a lot more serious, obviously.

10:05.620 --> 10:09.560
By the way, the fact that deepfakes bother people so much, and that the whole thing seems

10:09.560 --> 10:13.860
to be rooted in identity, is pretty much the final nail in the coffin for the self-identification

10:13.860 --> 10:14.860
crowd.

10:14.860 --> 10:18.660
If you truly could self-ID, if you alone had sovereign dominion over your identity, a deepfake

10:18.660 --> 10:19.660
wouldn't threaten you.

10:19.660 --> 10:20.700
But that's not how the world works.

10:20.700 --> 10:22.940
Our identity is only partially within us.

10:22.940 --> 10:26.980
It's also partially within the minds of other people, based on their observation of your

10:26.980 --> 10:28.540
presentation and behaviors.

10:28.540 --> 10:31.620
A deepfake is violating because it's out of your control.

10:31.620 --> 10:33.860
There wasn't anything you could have done differently to prevent it.

10:33.860 --> 10:37.700
But for that to be true, it means that your self-ID actually doesn't matter all that

10:37.700 --> 10:38.700
much on its own.

10:38.700 --> 10:42.620
Here's an example, and I don't even have to dive into the trans question, or the deepfake

10:42.620 --> 10:43.820
question, to get my point across.

10:43.820 --> 10:46.340
I have old 4chan nudes of nanners.

10:46.340 --> 10:50.500
From back before she was a vtuber, back before she was a woke scold, back when she was an

10:50.500 --> 10:54.900
18 year old edgelord posting tits on B. She's made it very known multiple times that she

10:54.900 --> 10:57.920
disavows her old past, and regrets putting those nudes out there.

10:57.920 --> 11:00.660
Am I under any moral obligation to delete them?

11:00.700 --> 11:01.700
I'm not sure.

11:01.700 --> 11:04.540
The consent of the present doesn't eliminate the consent of the past.

11:04.540 --> 11:08.500
She still did those things, she was still that person, that's still part of her identity,

11:08.500 --> 11:09.940
even if she doesn't like it now.

11:09.940 --> 11:13.780
Treating that identity like it once existed, because it did, isn't immoral, even if she

11:13.780 --> 11:15.340
currently finds it uncomfortable.

11:15.340 --> 11:18.720
I talked yesterday about the constant interconnectedness of the left.

11:18.720 --> 11:21.780
I guess another way in which they're hypocritical is when they want to shed their connections

11:21.780 --> 11:22.920
to their past self.

11:22.920 --> 11:27.260
I think this whole conversation revolves not around creating realistic porn of an e-girl

11:27.260 --> 11:31.380
who wouldn't have done porn otherwise, but instead around identity insecurity.

11:31.380 --> 11:34.660
And that's not an insult, being insecure about your identity is pretty reasonable.

11:34.660 --> 11:38.660
This topic hooks into the larger AI conversation we're having right now, where both artists

11:38.660 --> 11:43.260
and the consumers of art are getting weird about AI producing art that is actually competent.

11:43.260 --> 11:47.540
Where people are talking to chatbots that are actually able to have somewhat in-depth

11:47.540 --> 11:48.540
conversations.

11:48.540 --> 11:52.820
We are well past the days of 4chan turning Tay into a neo-nazi for lulz.

11:52.820 --> 11:57.000
Imagine the cockshottian AI socialist future, where central planning is actually possible

11:57.000 --> 12:01.060
and efficient because hyper-intelligent AI has harvested all data about every single

12:01.060 --> 12:05.600
human's market preferences and can now efficiently allocate resources to each person based on

12:05.600 --> 12:06.680
their desires.

12:06.680 --> 12:09.280
In that world, would you even have a sense of self anymore?

12:09.280 --> 12:11.480
No more privacy, no more independence or individual ownership?

12:11.480 --> 12:13.280
Would a deepfake even matter?

12:13.280 --> 12:17.560
The objection to deepfakes here is based in privacy and individualism, two things that

12:17.560 --> 12:19.820
political extremists are not so fond of.

12:19.820 --> 12:23.560
That cockshot future, wherein AI is at the head of civilization, implements a command

12:23.560 --> 12:27.320
economy, collectivizes all property, and promotes constant hedonistic behavior to pass

12:27.320 --> 12:32.040
the time, is presented in the kind of incredible, kind of underwhelming 2020 TV adaptation of

12:32.040 --> 12:33.040
Brave New World.

12:33.040 --> 12:36.840
In this interpretation of Huxley's most famous story, a one-world government is controlled

12:36.840 --> 12:40.900
by a computer program called Indra, which directs all economic activity for what it

12:40.900 --> 12:42.520
determines is everyone's benefit.

12:42.520 --> 12:46.400
Nobody has locks on their doors, and anybody can come into your place anytime they like.

12:46.400 --> 12:50.200
Everyone wears implants on their eye that allows them to mentally connect with any other

12:50.200 --> 12:53.600
person, see through their eyes, and experience what they're thinking, feeling, and doing.

12:53.600 --> 12:57.640
The concept of exclusivity in your property, in your relationships, in your thoughts, is

12:57.640 --> 12:59.000
considered offensive.

12:59.000 --> 13:03.120
In this completely collectivized world, where privacy has been abolished, and everyone and

13:03.120 --> 13:07.120
everything is everybody's to enjoy, would a deepfake even matter?

13:07.120 --> 13:11.280
If you can just go out and fuck anyone anyway, and you always can because everyone always

13:11.280 --> 13:14.200
says yes all the time to anyone, then who cares about deepfakes?

13:14.200 --> 13:16.160
It's a TV show, not real life, I know.

13:16.160 --> 13:18.200
But I'm bringing it up for a specific reason.

13:18.200 --> 13:23.080
As our real world becomes more and more interconnected, as concepts like privacy and exclusivity are

13:23.080 --> 13:28.320
dismantled inch by inch by the one-two punch of progressive hedonism and socialist collectivization,

13:28.320 --> 13:31.520
the deepfake problem was always going to come up eventually.

13:31.520 --> 13:35.960
I mentioned earlier that two girls from my school ended up in porn after graduation.

13:35.960 --> 13:39.420
That was considered an exceptionally high number for someone who went to high school

13:39.420 --> 13:40.420
in the 2000s.

13:40.420 --> 13:42.320
What are those numbers like nowadays?

13:42.320 --> 13:45.600
It really does seem like the percentage of girls who get into some sort of lewd industry

13:45.600 --> 13:47.680
is way higher than it was a decade or two ago.

13:47.680 --> 13:49.860
It's probably not as many as the Red Pillars think.

13:49.860 --> 13:53.680
I remember on Fresh and Fit a little bit ago, one of those guys said that something like

13:53.680 --> 13:58.360
40% of college girls are getting flown out to the Middle East to turn into Dubai porta-potties.

13:58.360 --> 14:00.880
A girl going to Kansas City is not getting flown out to Dubai.

14:00.880 --> 14:01.880
Yes she is bro!

14:01.880 --> 14:02.880
No.

14:02.880 --> 14:03.880
Look at today!

14:03.880 --> 14:04.880
Tonight!

14:04.880 --> 14:05.880
You guys are wild.

14:05.880 --> 14:06.880
You guys are wild.

14:06.880 --> 14:07.880
You're coping man.

14:07.880 --> 14:10.700
I just want to hear, for the record, for you three to answer this.

14:10.700 --> 14:14.600
What percentage of college women do you think are being flown around the world to fuck?

14:14.600 --> 14:15.600
Very little.

14:15.600 --> 14:16.600
Very little.

14:16.600 --> 14:17.600
I want to hear.

14:17.600 --> 14:23.360
I'll feel like probability-wise, if I argue, maybe like 30, 40, 50.

14:23.360 --> 14:24.360
Holy shit.

14:24.360 --> 14:27.200
You've got to be living in a whole other dimension to think this dude.

14:27.200 --> 14:28.640
There's no fucking way it's that high.

14:28.640 --> 14:32.880
But the number of girls who hit 18 and immediately do some sort of porn, OnlyFans, thirst trapping

14:32.880 --> 14:36.440
on Instagram or Twitch or something has got to be higher than it's ever been, considering

14:36.440 --> 14:40.600
how easy to do and how culturally normalized that sort of thing has become.

14:40.600 --> 14:45.000
Even beyond porn, our culture has become way more sexually permissive at a rapid pace.

14:45.000 --> 14:49.320
Scott Pilgrim came out in the late 2000s, and at that time, a 24-year-old woman having

14:49.320 --> 14:53.440
seven previous sexual partners was considered a comically large number.

14:53.440 --> 14:57.060
Nowadays, you'd be lucky to find a 24-year-old with that exact sexual history.

14:57.060 --> 14:59.120
By the way, I'm not casting a value judgment here.

14:59.120 --> 15:00.640
I'm not saying whether this is good or bad.

15:00.640 --> 15:02.200
I'm simply saying that it is.

15:02.200 --> 15:06.120
And the reason I'm describing it is because as the world moves more leftward, the very

15:06.120 --> 15:09.000
concept of privacy is becoming a thing of the past.

15:09.000 --> 15:13.160
As promiscuous sexuality becomes more culturally permissible, things that used to be kept private

15:13.160 --> 15:17.340
are now flaunted openly in the name of pride, far beyond gay or trans pride.

15:17.340 --> 15:21.040
As socialism moves more into the forefront, individualism is viewed as a relic of the

15:21.040 --> 15:25.200
past, as a part of liberalism that was once crazy and revolutionary but now needs to be

15:25.200 --> 15:27.760
abolished for the collectivization to begin.

15:27.760 --> 15:31.560
It is no wonder that in this political environment, we are starting to see the dismantling of

15:31.560 --> 15:32.920
privacy itself.

15:32.920 --> 15:36.440
No private property, no private speech, no private thoughts, no private information,

15:36.440 --> 15:37.840
no private lives.

15:37.840 --> 15:41.580
From stuff like tracking or harvesting data, to cancel culture, to the expectation that

15:41.580 --> 15:45.180
you always be available to work even when off the clock, to central planning, to corporate

15:45.180 --> 15:50.780
ESG scores, to always-on, always-connected electronic devices, and yes, to sexual promiscuity,

15:50.780 --> 15:54.880
the thread that ties all of this stuff together is the abolishment of privacy.

15:54.880 --> 15:58.820
The fact that your average leftoid is pro some of these things and anti others is a

15:58.820 --> 16:02.680
testament to how poorly thought out their everything-should-be-connected ethic actually

16:02.680 --> 16:03.680
is.

16:03.680 --> 16:07.400
In this context, it's no wonder we're grappling with moral issues surrounding deepfakes.

16:07.400 --> 16:11.300
I have a feeling that within my lifetime, deepfakes of everyone will be normalized as

16:11.300 --> 16:14.420
just a new part of the next generation's sexual morality, after the zoomers have hit

16:14.420 --> 16:15.420
middle age.

16:15.420 --> 16:18.020
Yeah, I know you probably clicked on this video looking for some laughs about Atriok

16:18.020 --> 16:19.020
and the drama.

16:19.020 --> 16:20.020
Well, you should have known better.

16:20.020 --> 16:21.260
His story isn't actually that interesting.

16:21.260 --> 16:24.660
He's a retard who thought it was a good idea to special order deepfake porn of a streamer

16:24.660 --> 16:28.660
e-girlfriends, and then continued to be retarded because he didn't do that shit on a non-business

16:28.660 --> 16:31.620
computer, or at least fucking close the tabs before he went live.

16:31.620 --> 16:35.120
There's actually not much to it beyond that, though the clip of him saying that anybody

16:35.120 --> 16:38.380
could be scummy in private is pretty funny, all things considered.

16:38.380 --> 16:42.580
But do remember that all the creators you watch online could be pieces of shit like

16:42.580 --> 16:46.860
this behind closed doors, but we are all forced to be good and play nice because we want to

16:46.860 --> 16:47.860
keep our jobs.

16:47.860 --> 16:52.640
The real conversation here is the slow creeping move to abolish privacy itself.

16:52.640 --> 16:55.960
For something to be private, it has to be exclusive to only the people who have access

16:55.960 --> 16:56.960
to it.

16:56.960 --> 16:59.300
It has to be particular to only the people who are interested in it.

16:59.300 --> 17:00.560
It has to be gatekept.

17:00.560 --> 17:04.620
But inclusivity, universality, and interconnectedness are the values of the left.

17:04.620 --> 17:08.200
Whether we're talking about the replaceability of cultures and populations to the collectivization

17:08.200 --> 17:12.400
of all property to the abolishment of both monogamy and gender, everything to these people

17:12.400 --> 17:15.640
is fungible, and privacy is a value that stands in the way.

17:15.640 --> 17:20.400
That's why, despite the current drama, deepfakes are ultimately permissible within the leftist

17:20.400 --> 17:21.400
framework.

17:21.400 --> 17:25.080
Because once you arrive at their natural endpoint, it's just another naked woman among millions.

17:25.080 --> 17:26.080
Who cares?

17:26.080 --> 17:30.900
Inclusivity, universality, and interconnectedness all lead to replaceability, and replaceability

17:30.900 --> 17:33.520
leads to the idea that there's nothing special about you at all.

17:33.520 --> 17:37.600
To object to that, to say that your sexual activity shouldn't be inclusive or universal

17:37.600 --> 17:39.840
or collectivized, is to say that it should be private.

17:39.840 --> 17:42.840
You're an individual, not a random number among millions.

17:42.840 --> 17:46.600
Appealing to privacy here necessarily takes you outside of the leftist framework, at least

17:46.600 --> 17:50.540
philosophically, because you are demanding separation instead of connection, particularity

17:50.540 --> 17:55.320
over replaceability, and exclusive individuality over the inclusivity of the masses.

17:55.320 --> 17:59.640
The only solid moral objections to deepfakes are grounded in consent.

17:59.640 --> 18:03.320
Consent is grounded in privacy, and as long as the left wants to abolish privacy, they

18:03.320 --> 18:07.120
will always create an environment where deepfakes, along with a lot of other terrible sexual

18:07.120 --> 18:08.800
behaviors, is permissible.

18:08.800 --> 18:13.240
Their talk about valuing consent is simply paying lip service to a popular idea.

18:13.240 --> 18:17.580
If the consequentialist end is good enough, they have no problem violating consent.

18:17.580 --> 18:19.960
Your average left-leaning person doesn't understand this philosophy.

18:19.960 --> 18:22.920
They don't even mean to promote this stuff, I don't think.

18:22.920 --> 18:26.220
But hey, it wouldn't be the first time that some idiot believed that they could centrally

18:26.220 --> 18:30.440
plan all of society, and it backfired in their face with catastrophic consequences.
