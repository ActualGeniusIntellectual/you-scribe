0	7600	Deepfakes are back in the news, baby!
7600	11360	I did a video on this topic before, a few years back, when Jordan Peterson threatened
11360	15400	legal action against a company that was using technology to replicate his voice.
15400	19780	But the tech has advanced wildly since then, with new problems coming along with it.
19780	24280	Streamer Atriok apologizes after watching Pokemaine Deepfakes.
24280	28600	Earlier today, a streamer called Atriok was exposed after a clip went viral due to the
28600	30880	discovery of a certain tab on his PC.
30880	35260	The tab included the name of a website that features inappropriate deepfake images and
35260	39480	videos of other popular streamers such as Pokemaine and MayaHiga.
39480	44000	After a brief period of silence, Atriok has now confirmed these claims and has apologized
44000	46040	for what he says was a case of morbid curiosity.
46040	49280	Well, we don't gotta take this article's word for it.
49280	50280	Let's roll the clip.
50280	55980	I guess what I want to say is, uh, so I, I, I already feel deeply, I'm deeply fucking
55980	57480	embarrassed about this.
57480	64400	I'm deeply fucking embarrassed, I'm angry at myself, uh, I feel fucking, I just feel
64400	65400	so fucking stupid.
65400	67680	Dude, look at his wife in the background.
67680	70800	She's not sad or afraid her husband's gonna be canceled or something.
70800	71800	She's angry.
71800	75160	Apparently, Atriok and his wife are personal friends of Pokemaine and Maya.
75160	76160	I don't fucking know.
76160	79520	I don't know who any of these big time LA streamers are or any of their connections.
79520	82120	Apparently, he ran a business with a boyfriend of one of them or something.
82120	85320	The point is that they're all friends, they all run in the same circle, and his wife is
85320	86320	pissed.
86320	87320	Think about it.
87360	91560	When your wife discovered you had been jacking off to AI generated porn of your shared friend
91560	92560	group.
92560	93560	What a weird situation.
93560	98560	I've done a lot on this stream to like create a pattern of behavior where I really want,
98560	101200	especially women on Twitch, to feel safer.
101200	104240	Like I, uh, we call fucking booba spam cringe.
104240	105240	We don't do that there.
105240	109160	I've never made like a fucking weird, I don't know, sea sniffing joke.
109160	110240	I've never done anything like that.
110240	114800	I've never done anything like that on this stream and we don't tolerate any sex behavior
114800	115800	in the chat.
116040	121920	We ban it on site and, uh, and like I've done this consistently over and over and over.
121920	125600	This is the difference between people who allow edgy jokes and people who don't.
125600	128400	I don't care about booba jokes or seat sniffing jokes.
128400	131200	And you're also going to find that I don't really have skeletons in my closet.
131200	133200	This is prime repressor behavior.
133200	134200	I'm sorry.
134200	135200	I'm just fucking sorry.
135200	137680	I don't, I don't support this stuff.
137680	139240	I don't believe this stuff.
139240	141880	I'm not like a fucking advocate in any way.
141880	142880	I regret it.
142880	144680	I would never do it as long as I live.
144920	146680	I'll never do it again.
146680	151360	This is a point that I brought up in my video on the r slash anti-work sexual abuser.
151360	153520	The difference between theory and reality.
153520	157000	It's very easy to say you don't do a thing and you're not for a thing after you've already
157000	158000	done it.
158000	159160	Actions speak louder than words.
159160	161640	Practice is more important than theory.
161640	163240	Pokimane's response was pretty simple.
163240	165280	Stop sexualizing people without their consent.
165280	166280	That's it.
166280	167280	That's the tweet.
167280	169120	Beyond this, I figure she'll just ignore the situation.
169120	171440	Pokimane's got doing good PR down to a science.
171440	175920	Amaya Higa's response is more personal, talking about how she was raped in 2018, how she's
175920	180440	never done any sort of sexual content online, and how the aftermath of the whole situation
180440	183600	feels a lot like the aftermath of her 2018 experience.
183600	187400	It turns out that Cutie Cinderella was also another person deep faked on that website
187400	190280	by Atriok, even though most articles aren't bringing her up.
190280	192680	And she had quite a bit to say about it too.
192680	194760	Fuck the fucking internet.
194760	198960	Fuck the constant exploitation and objectification of women.
198960	201280	It's exhausting.
201280	206120	Fuck Atriok for showing it to thousands of people.
206120	211360	Fuck the people DMing me pictures of myself from that website.
211360	212360	Fuck you all.
212360	220180	If you are able to look at women who are not selling themselves or benefiting off of being
220180	225040	seen sexually, they're not benefiting, they're not selling it, they're not platforming it
225040	226120	themselves.
226120	230020	If you are able to look at that, you are the problem.
230020	232020	You see women as an object.
232020	235340	You should not be okay doing that.
235340	242620	And it should not be a part of my job to have to pay money to get this stuff taken down.
242620	247820	It should not be part of my job to be harassed, to see pictures of me nude spread around.
247820	250500	It should not be something that is found on the internet.
250500	251500	It shouldn't be.
251500	253820	That shouldn't be a part of my job.
253820	257820	And the fact that it is, is exhausting.
257820	264460	And to the person that made that website, I'm going to fucking sue you.
264460	267140	Now, I don't know if she's going to actually be able to sue the website.
267140	269340	I don't know what the legality is regarding deepfakes.
269340	273500	Because it's not really the girl, it's somebody else, with the girl's face AI generated onto
273500	274500	the body.
274500	277540	I'm sure this is yet another instance where lawmakers are falling behind technology.
277540	280420	But to be honest, the legal conversation isn't all that interesting.
280420	283540	What's more interesting is, are deepfakes moral?
283540	285180	Intuitively, they don't feel moral.
285180	289060	There's something wrong there, even if it feels a bit less than, say, revenge porn.
289060	290060	But why is that?
290060	292020	What's at the bottom of that knee-jerk feeling?
292020	293820	Let's run down some possibilities.
293820	298860	Is it just the fact that Atrock is friends with Pokimane and Mayahiga and Cutie Cinderella?
298860	300220	That certainly makes it more weird.
300220	301860	You're betraying a friendship, for sure.
301860	304580	Is it still immoral if you're not related to the people at all?
304580	308380	Like, if you or I, people who don't know any of these e-girls at all, if we look at their
308380	310020	deepfakes, is that bad?
310020	312740	It feels kind of bad, but not as bad as their friend doing it.
312740	315060	Certainly not as bad if we keep it a secret rather than sharing them.
315060	318860	It also feels like it's worse if we're actually masturbating to them rather than looking at
318860	320740	them out of a sense of morbid curiosity.
320740	323260	And to be clear, I have seen at least the Pokimane deepfakes.
323260	325460	I didn't find them appealing, only strange.
325460	329300	Pokimane, Mayahiga, and Cutie Cinderella are all attractive women on the internet.
329300	333580	But it's not like they do hyper-sexualized thirst trap content, like Amaranth or Denims
333580	335300	or the OK Boomer girl.
335300	336980	Those women know specifically what they're doing.
336980	339200	They're attracting simps by flaunting their sexuality.
339200	343620	They are openly, publicly sexual in a way that the previous set of e-girls were not.
343620	346980	Even though they're not doing open pornography on Pornhub or something.
346980	350500	Considering that these girls are specifically out there marketing their attractiveness as
350500	354620	their prime asset while still not showing it all on camera, is it immoral to look at
354620	356880	the deepfakes of them instead?
356880	360520	My intuition tells me again, if it is, it's a lot less immoral because they're already
360520	362500	putting themselves out there in that manner.
362500	365820	They have to know their young male audience is already jacking off to pictures of them
365820	366860	or streams of them.
366860	370780	Is a deepfake really all that different from them imagining them having sex?
370780	372300	I mean, yeah, it kind of is.
372300	374580	Because it's that imagined scene made real.
374580	376820	At least real enough to possibly share it around.
376820	379880	But again, it's not like it's the body of the actual girl in question.
379880	382300	And then you think, what about actual porn actresses?
382300	386620	Like right now, you can go watch a video of Mia Khalifa doing basically whatever you want
386620	387660	over on Pornhub.
387660	390100	Is it immoral to deepfake Mia Khalifa?
390100	391600	At that point, the answer seems to be no.
391600	393460	You can already see her doing that stuff herself.
393460	396380	But even if it's not immoral, it's certainly weird, isn't it?
396380	397380	What's the source of the weirdness?
397380	400500	I mean, the friendship angle is a possible source of the weirdness, like with Atriok
400500	401780	and his deepfaked friends.
401780	405900	Personally, I know like six people who have all done real porn, not deepfaked, including
405900	407580	two girls I knew in school.
407580	409580	And again, out of curiosity, I've looked at their porn.
409580	411020	It was definitely strange to watch.
411020	412380	I couldn't really enjoy it.
412380	414560	But presumably, none of us know Mia Khalifa personally.
414560	418720	So why does it feel a little bit odd to deepfake her face onto a different porn star's body
418720	420060	when she already does porn?
420060	424260	All of these incongruencies are pointing at something we haven't uncovered yet.
424260	428220	When you look at a Pokimane deepfake, it's not like you're actually seeing Pokimane naked.
428220	431280	You're seeing a different woman with Pokimane's face put on top of it.
431280	434780	It's just a more sophisticated version of taking a picture of a naked girl and lazily
434780	437080	photoshopping somebody else's head on top.
437080	440800	Does the immorality stem from the sophistication of the deepfake, such that it's done well
440800	442520	enough you don't actually know it's fake anymore?
442520	446360	Well, that doesn't sound right either, because Atriok literally ordered these images from
446360	447560	a deepfake website.
447560	451000	Torrents of deepfakes online are labeled as deepfakes.
451000	453580	If you know it's a deepfake, then you know it's not real.
453580	457340	It's not like the Kardashian blowjob leak where it was actually a real image and everyone
457340	458340	knew it.
458340	465200	Some of you might be old enough to remember Sarah Palin's rise to prominence in 2008,
465200	467420	as John McCain's running mate against Obama.
467420	472100	Even though this happened 15 years ago, you could still find crude sexual photoshops of
472100	473100	her.
473100	474500	Nobody on the left complained back then, by the way.
474500	479440	And there were even Sarah Palin lookalikes doing full porn shoots acting as Sarah Palin.
479440	480440	Was that immoral?
480440	484140	Okay, even if you think that porn itself is immoral, was it any extra immoral because
484140	486300	they were taking on the persona of a real person?
486300	487300	In this case, I don't think so.
487300	489300	If anything, it just seems funny, like it's a joke.
489300	493540	When Rule 34 of Egoraptor and JonTron was made during the height of Game Grumps, they
493540	495180	also took it as a joke when they saw it.
495180	498000	Okay, so what if you had a twin, and that twin did porn?
498000	499200	Would you feel violated?
499200	500820	Probably not, because the twin's their own person.
500820	504500	For example, I don't know if you know this, but Egoraptor's wife, Mortimer, is a twin.
504500	508380	If Mortimer's twin sister did porn, would the fans of Game Grumps consider that to be
508380	509540	Mortimer porn?
509540	514300	Would she feel violated and publicly humiliated, as if it were the same thing as Mortimer deepfake
514300	515300	porn?
515300	516300	Probably not.
516300	520260	The accuracy of that porn to Mortimer's own body would likely be a lot closer than
520260	521500	any deepfake.
521500	525340	This leads me to believe that it's not about how accurate the deepfake is, how believable
525340	528380	it is to the viewer that it might be the actual person.
528380	529900	It's more about identity.
529900	533760	We know that the porn star playing the role of Sarah Palin isn't actually Sarah Palin.
533760	536680	We know that Mortimer's twin sister isn't actually Mortimer.
536680	540180	These people have their own identities underneath the role that they're playing.
540180	544020	But unless you recognize the specific porn that the deepfake is taken from, we don't
544020	546020	know who's underneath Pokeman's face.
546020	548300	There's a depersonalizing aspect at play.
548300	553020	While actors and twins only adopt an identity temporarily, deepfakes are simulations of
553020	554020	an identity.
554020	557900	If I built a perfectly accurate synthetic robot that looks exactly like Pokemane, and
557900	562980	then had the robot do Pokemane porn, would that be as violating as Pokemane deepfakes?
562980	567200	The answer, intuitively, seems to be yes, because there's no underlying identity there
567200	569460	showing to the viewer that the whole thing's just an act.
569460	573740	In fact, the whole thing is just the simulated, stolen identity of Pokemane.
573740	577980	We view identity in this way because identity is not only contained in the self, but it
577980	581380	exists in the minds of others, a lesson you really should have learned decades ago from
581380	582380	Evangelion.
582380	585660	Deepfakes seem to be immoral not because people might think you're having sex on camera
585660	588820	when you really didn't, but because it's a hijacking of your identity in a way that
588820	592740	is wholly out of your control, not based on your self-presentation or on the quality
592740	595420	of your behaviors, but simply on the whims of another person.
595420	598580	It's kind of like when you're not a slut, but somebody who hates you spreads the rumor
598580	601940	that you are a slut, and then you feel off when the rumor gets back to you, because it's
601940	603340	not actually based on who you are.
603340	605620	Though with deepfakes it's a lot more serious, obviously.
605620	609560	By the way, the fact that deepfakes bother people so much, and that the whole thing seems
609560	613860	to be rooted in identity, is pretty much the final nail in the coffin for the self-identification
613860	614860	crowd.
614860	618660	If you truly could self-ID, if you alone had sovereign dominion over your identity, a deepfake
618660	619660	wouldn't threaten you.
619660	620700	But that's not how the world works.
620700	622940	Our identity is only partially within us.
622940	626980	It's also partially within the minds of other people, based on their observation of your
626980	628540	presentation and behaviors.
628540	631620	A deepfake is violating because it's out of your control.
631620	633860	There wasn't anything you could have done differently to prevent it.
633860	637700	But for that to be true, it means that your self-ID actually doesn't matter all that
637700	638700	much on its own.
638700	642620	Here's an example, and I don't even have to dive into the trans question, or the deepfake
642620	643820	question, to get my point across.
643820	646340	I have old 4chan nudes of nanners.
646340	650500	From back before she was a vtuber, back before she was a woke scold, back when she was an
650500	654900	18 year old edgelord posting tits on B. She's made it very known multiple times that she
654900	657920	disavows her old past, and regrets putting those nudes out there.
657920	660660	Am I under any moral obligation to delete them?
660700	661700	I'm not sure.
661700	664540	The consent of the present doesn't eliminate the consent of the past.
664540	668500	She still did those things, she was still that person, that's still part of her identity,
668500	669940	even if she doesn't like it now.
669940	673780	Treating that identity like it once existed, because it did, isn't immoral, even if she
673780	675340	currently finds it uncomfortable.
675340	678720	I talked yesterday about the constant interconnectedness of the left.
678720	681780	I guess another way in which they're hypocritical is when they want to shed their connections
681780	682920	to their past self.
682920	687260	I think this whole conversation revolves not around creating realistic porn of an e-girl
687260	691380	who wouldn't have done porn otherwise, but instead around identity insecurity.
691380	694660	And that's not an insult, being insecure about your identity is pretty reasonable.
694660	698660	This topic hooks into the larger AI conversation we're having right now, where both artists
698660	703260	and the consumers of art are getting weird about AI producing art that is actually competent.
703260	707540	Where people are talking to chatbots that are actually able to have somewhat in-depth
707540	708540	conversations.
708540	712820	We are well past the days of 4chan turning Tay into a neo-nazi for lulz.
712820	717000	Imagine the cockshottian AI socialist future, where central planning is actually possible
717000	721060	and efficient because hyper-intelligent AI has harvested all data about every single
721060	725600	human's market preferences and can now efficiently allocate resources to each person based on
725600	726680	their desires.
726680	729280	In that world, would you even have a sense of self anymore?
729280	731480	No more privacy, no more independence or individual ownership?
731480	733280	Would a deepfake even matter?
733280	737560	The objection to deepfakes here is based in privacy and individualism, two things that
737560	739820	political extremists are not so fond of.
739820	743560	That cockshot future, wherein AI is at the head of civilization, implements a command
743560	747320	economy, collectivizes all property, and promotes constant hedonistic behavior to pass
747320	752040	the time, is presented in the kind of incredible, kind of underwhelming 2020 TV adaptation of
752040	753040	Brave New World.
753040	756840	In this interpretation of Huxley's most famous story, a one-world government is controlled
756840	760900	by a computer program called Indra, which directs all economic activity for what it
760900	762520	determines is everyone's benefit.
762520	766400	Nobody has locks on their doors, and anybody can come into your place anytime they like.
766400	770200	Everyone wears implants on their eye that allows them to mentally connect with any other
770200	773600	person, see through their eyes, and experience what they're thinking, feeling, and doing.
773600	777640	The concept of exclusivity in your property, in your relationships, in your thoughts, is
777640	779000	considered offensive.
779000	783120	In this completely collectivized world, where privacy has been abolished, and everyone and
783120	787120	everything is everybody's to enjoy, would a deepfake even matter?
787120	791280	If you can just go out and fuck anyone anyway, and you always can because everyone always
791280	794200	says yes all the time to anyone, then who cares about deepfakes?
794200	796160	It's a TV show, not real life, I know.
796160	798200	But I'm bringing it up for a specific reason.
798200	803080	As our real world becomes more and more interconnected, as concepts like privacy and exclusivity are
803080	808320	dismantled inch by inch by the one-two punch of progressive hedonism and socialist collectivization,
808320	811520	the deepfake problem was always going to come up eventually.
811520	815960	I mentioned earlier that two girls from my school ended up in porn after graduation.
815960	819420	That was considered an exceptionally high number for someone who went to high school
819420	820420	in the 2000s.
820420	822320	What are those numbers like nowadays?
822320	825600	It really does seem like the percentage of girls who get into some sort of lewd industry
825600	827680	is way higher than it was a decade or two ago.
827680	829860	It's probably not as many as the Red Pillars think.
829860	833680	I remember on Fresh and Fit a little bit ago, one of those guys said that something like
833680	838360	40% of college girls are getting flown out to the Middle East to turn into Dubai porta-potties.
838360	840880	A girl going to Kansas City is not getting flown out to Dubai.
840880	841880	Yes she is bro!
841880	842880	No.
842880	843880	Look at today!
843880	844880	Tonight!
844880	845880	You guys are wild.
845880	846880	You guys are wild.
846880	847880	You're coping man.
847880	850700	I just want to hear, for the record, for you three to answer this.
850700	854600	What percentage of college women do you think are being flown around the world to fuck?
854600	855600	Very little.
855600	856600	Very little.
856600	857600	I want to hear.
857600	863360	I'll feel like probability-wise, if I argue, maybe like 30, 40, 50.
863360	864360	Holy shit.
864360	867200	You've got to be living in a whole other dimension to think this dude.
867200	868640	There's no fucking way it's that high.
868640	872880	But the number of girls who hit 18 and immediately do some sort of porn, OnlyFans, thirst trapping
872880	876440	on Instagram or Twitch or something has got to be higher than it's ever been, considering
876440	880600	how easy to do and how culturally normalized that sort of thing has become.
880600	885000	Even beyond porn, our culture has become way more sexually permissive at a rapid pace.
885000	889320	Scott Pilgrim came out in the late 2000s, and at that time, a 24-year-old woman having
889320	893440	seven previous sexual partners was considered a comically large number.
893440	897060	Nowadays, you'd be lucky to find a 24-year-old with that exact sexual history.
897060	899120	By the way, I'm not casting a value judgment here.
899120	900640	I'm not saying whether this is good or bad.
900640	902200	I'm simply saying that it is.
902200	906120	And the reason I'm describing it is because as the world moves more leftward, the very
906120	909000	concept of privacy is becoming a thing of the past.
909000	913160	As promiscuous sexuality becomes more culturally permissible, things that used to be kept private
913160	917340	are now flaunted openly in the name of pride, far beyond gay or trans pride.
917340	921040	As socialism moves more into the forefront, individualism is viewed as a relic of the
921040	925200	past, as a part of liberalism that was once crazy and revolutionary but now needs to be
925200	927760	abolished for the collectivization to begin.
927760	931560	It is no wonder that in this political environment, we are starting to see the dismantling of
931560	932920	privacy itself.
932920	936440	No private property, no private speech, no private thoughts, no private information,
936440	937840	no private lives.
937840	941580	From stuff like tracking or harvesting data, to cancel culture, to the expectation that
941580	945180	you always be available to work even when off the clock, to central planning, to corporate
945180	950780	ESG scores, to always-on, always-connected electronic devices, and yes, to sexual promiscuity,
950780	954880	the thread that ties all of this stuff together is the abolishment of privacy.
954880	958820	The fact that your average leftoid is pro some of these things and anti others is a
958820	962680	testament to how poorly thought out their everything-should-be-connected ethic actually
962680	963680	is.
963680	967400	In this context, it's no wonder we're grappling with moral issues surrounding deepfakes.
967400	971300	I have a feeling that within my lifetime, deepfakes of everyone will be normalized as
971300	974420	just a new part of the next generation's sexual morality, after the zoomers have hit
974420	975420	middle age.
975420	978020	Yeah, I know you probably clicked on this video looking for some laughs about Atriok
978020	979020	and the drama.
979020	980020	Well, you should have known better.
980020	981260	His story isn't actually that interesting.
981260	984660	He's a retard who thought it was a good idea to special order deepfake porn of a streamer
984660	988660	e-girlfriends, and then continued to be retarded because he didn't do that shit on a non-business
988660	991620	computer, or at least fucking close the tabs before he went live.
991620	995120	There's actually not much to it beyond that, though the clip of him saying that anybody
995120	998380	could be scummy in private is pretty funny, all things considered.
998380	1002580	But do remember that all the creators you watch online could be pieces of shit like
1002580	1006860	this behind closed doors, but we are all forced to be good and play nice because we want to
1006860	1007860	keep our jobs.
1007860	1012640	The real conversation here is the slow creeping move to abolish privacy itself.
1012640	1015960	For something to be private, it has to be exclusive to only the people who have access
1015960	1016960	to it.
1016960	1019300	It has to be particular to only the people who are interested in it.
1019300	1020560	It has to be gatekept.
1020560	1024620	But inclusivity, universality, and interconnectedness are the values of the left.
1024620	1028200	Whether we're talking about the replaceability of cultures and populations to the collectivization
1028200	1032400	of all property to the abolishment of both monogamy and gender, everything to these people
1032400	1035640	is fungible, and privacy is a value that stands in the way.
1035640	1040400	That's why, despite the current drama, deepfakes are ultimately permissible within the leftist
1040400	1041400	framework.
1041400	1045080	Because once you arrive at their natural endpoint, it's just another naked woman among millions.
1045080	1046080	Who cares?
1046080	1050900	Inclusivity, universality, and interconnectedness all lead to replaceability, and replaceability
1050900	1053520	leads to the idea that there's nothing special about you at all.
1053520	1057600	To object to that, to say that your sexual activity shouldn't be inclusive or universal
1057600	1059840	or collectivized, is to say that it should be private.
1059840	1062840	You're an individual, not a random number among millions.
1062840	1066600	Appealing to privacy here necessarily takes you outside of the leftist framework, at least
1066600	1070540	philosophically, because you are demanding separation instead of connection, particularity
1070540	1075320	over replaceability, and exclusive individuality over the inclusivity of the masses.
1075320	1079640	The only solid moral objections to deepfakes are grounded in consent.
1079640	1083320	Consent is grounded in privacy, and as long as the left wants to abolish privacy, they
1083320	1087120	will always create an environment where deepfakes, along with a lot of other terrible sexual
1087120	1088800	behaviors, is permissible.
1088800	1093240	Their talk about valuing consent is simply paying lip service to a popular idea.
1093240	1097580	If the consequentialist end is good enough, they have no problem violating consent.
1097580	1099960	Your average left-leaning person doesn't understand this philosophy.
1099960	1102920	They don't even mean to promote this stuff, I don't think.
1102920	1106220	But hey, it wouldn't be the first time that some idiot believed that they could centrally
1106220	1110440	plan all of society, and it backfired in their face with catastrophic consequences.
