0	4640	Hello my friends, yes I've been gone for a while and I haven't been doing nothing
4640	10240	because of the YouTube situation even if I get my monetization back which there's still a fair
10240	13920	chance that I will. It's obvious that you can't really trust them anymore unless you're you know
13920	19360	a corporate YouTuber or something. So behind the scenes I've been doing the hard work of diversifying
19360	24080	re-uploading the old videos to other channels other platforms that sort of thing. So today I'd
24080	30160	like to point out my Bitchute channel. It is Bitchute.com slash shortfatotaku and if you're
30160	34400	subbed to that channel right now I've got about 5000 people subbed there so thank you very much.
34400	40240	You will over the course of today and probably the next few days start to see re-uploads of videos
40240	45520	that aren't on that channel. I want to make sure my entire catalog is on the SFO Bitchute channel.
45520	49920	I also started a Game Boomers Bitchute channel where I'm going to be uploading all of the various
49920	54960	game playthroughs. That's going to be a much more daunting task in my opinion because there's like
54960	59520	three or four thousand videos to upload. We've been doing let's plays for years long before I
59520	64480	started doing political content and I find it to be a fun side project that hey is actually helping
64480	67920	me pay the bills so thanks very much for watching it. But in any case that's what I'm doing right
67920	72160	now that's what I've been doing for the past little bit and after the entire SFO backlog is
72160	77600	up on Bitchute and functioning then I'm going to do an SFO Odyssey channel an SFO Rumble channel
77600	82400	and probably even an SFO Daily Motion channel. Because Styx is right it's time to get off
82400	86640	mainline tech. When those channels open and I start putting the backlog up there I will
86640	91920	advertise them here as well. But today it's Bitchute so head over to Bitchute.com
91920	97120	slash shortfatotaku and please consider subscribing there. I hope to see you there. I love you.
