Hello my friends, yes I've been gone for a while and I haven't been doing nothing

00:04.640 --> 00:10.240
because of the YouTube situation even if I get my monetization back which there's still a fair

00:10.240 --> 00:13.920
chance that I will. It's obvious that you can't really trust them anymore unless you're you know

00:13.920 --> 00:19.360
a corporate YouTuber or something. So behind the scenes I've been doing the hard work of diversifying

00:19.360 --> 00:24.080
re-uploading the old videos to other channels other platforms that sort of thing. So today I'd

00:24.080 --> 00:30.160
like to point out my Bitchute channel. It is Bitchute.com slash shortfatotaku and if you're

00:30.160 --> 00:34.400
subbed to that channel right now I've got about 5000 people subbed there so thank you very much.

00:34.400 --> 00:40.240
You will over the course of today and probably the next few days start to see re-uploads of videos

00:40.240 --> 00:45.520
that aren't on that channel. I want to make sure my entire catalog is on the SFO Bitchute channel.

00:45.520 --> 00:49.920
I also started a Game Boomers Bitchute channel where I'm going to be uploading all of the various

00:49.920 --> 00:54.960
game playthroughs. That's going to be a much more daunting task in my opinion because there's like

00:54.960 --> 00:59.520
three or four thousand videos to upload. We've been doing let's plays for years long before I

00:59.520 --> 01:04.480
started doing political content and I find it to be a fun side project that hey is actually helping

01:04.480 --> 01:07.920
me pay the bills so thanks very much for watching it. But in any case that's what I'm doing right

01:07.920 --> 01:12.160
now that's what I've been doing for the past little bit and after the entire SFO backlog is

01:12.160 --> 01:17.600
up on Bitchute and functioning then I'm going to do an SFO Odyssey channel an SFO Rumble channel

01:17.600 --> 01:22.400
and probably even an SFO Daily Motion channel. Because Styx is right it's time to get off

01:22.400 --> 01:26.640
mainline tech. When those channels open and I start putting the backlog up there I will

01:26.640 --> 01:31.920
advertise them here as well. But today it's Bitchute so head over to Bitchute.com

01:31.920 --> 01:37.120
slash shortfatotaku and please consider subscribing there. I hope to see you there. I love you.
