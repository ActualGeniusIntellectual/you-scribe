Hello my friends, yes I've been gone for a while and I haven't been doing nothing

2
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:10,240
because of the YouTube situation even if I get my monetization back which there's still a fair

3
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:13,920
chance that I will. It's obvious that you can't really trust them anymore unless you're you know

4
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:19,360
a corporate YouTuber or something. So behind the scenes I've been doing the hard work of diversifying

5
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:24,080
re-uploading the old videos to other channels other platforms that sort of thing. So today I'd

6
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:30,160
like to point out my Bitchute channel. It is Bitchute.com slash shortfatotaku and if you're

7
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:34,400
subbed to that channel right now I've got about 5000 people subbed there so thank you very much.

8
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:40,240
You will over the course of today and probably the next few days start to see re-uploads of videos

9
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:45,520
that aren't on that channel. I want to make sure my entire catalog is on the SFO Bitchute channel.

10
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:49,920
I also started a Game Boomers Bitchute channel where I'm going to be uploading all of the various

11
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:54,960
game playthroughs. That's going to be a much more daunting task in my opinion because there's like

12
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:59,520
three or four thousand videos to upload. We've been doing let's plays for years long before I

13
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:04,480
started doing political content and I find it to be a fun side project that hey is actually helping

14
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:07,920
me pay the bills so thanks very much for watching it. But in any case that's what I'm doing right

15
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:12,160
now that's what I've been doing for the past little bit and after the entire SFO backlog is

16
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:17,600
up on Bitchute and functioning then I'm going to do an SFO Odyssey channel an SFO Rumble channel

17
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:22,400
and probably even an SFO Daily Motion channel. Because Styx is right it's time to get off

18
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:26,640
mainline tech. When those channels open and I start putting the backlog up there I will

19
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:31,920
advertise them here as well. But today it's Bitchute so head over to Bitchute.com

20
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:37,120
slash shortfatotaku and please consider subscribing there. I hope to see you there. I love you.
