1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,140
Oh man, what a ride the past few weeks have been.

2
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:19,080
I was sick, then I was away on a trip, then when I came back I pumped out that previous

3
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:23,320
Indefensible video, which was on Google Stadia, and then fall allergies hit me like a truck.

4
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:24,680
I never had allergies growing up.

5
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:25,680
No spring, no fall, no nothing.

6
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:28,880
But now that I'm a little bit older, I go outside in the fall and it feels like my head

7
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:33,280
inflates and I float away, so I missed a giant chunk of the last couple of news cycles.

8
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:37,520
And of all the ridiculous stuff that's happened recently, the one that sings to my heart is

9
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:38,920
the closing of G4.

10
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:40,560
I've spoken about this twice already.

11
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:43,700
I did a tubcast with Lilith, where we went over the history of G4.

12
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:48,060
Very briefly, G4 was an American TV network focusing on video games, launching back in

13
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:49,060
2002.

14
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:54,040
Being of that era, it was full of edgy humor, sex jokes, boobs, violence, puns, all the

15
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:56,380
stuff that made the 90s and 2000s great.

16
00:00:56,380 --> 00:01:00,020
I have some memory of watching it when I was younger, though its reach in Canada was

17
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:01,020
limited.

18
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:04,140
G4 was eventually outclassed by the rise of the internet, like the rest of cable TV.

19
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:07,840
For gamers, it became more convenient to watch a trusted YouTuber, who at the time you could

20
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:11,580
assume was not bought off because those types of sponsorships didn't exist back in like

21
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:16,340
2008, than it was to turn on the TV and hope you caught the right segment airing on G4,

22
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:18,540
which might have just been paid for by advertisers anyway.

23
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:22,740
G4 remained nostalgic for a lot of gamers in my age group, the same way that Nintendo

24
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:23,740
Power is.

25
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:27,740
whose extinction was inevitable with the advancement of technology.

26
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:32,780
My other video on this topic though, was about Frost Curran's now legendary rant on the newly

27
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:35,780
revived G4 YouTube channel.

28
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:37,460
Sexism in gaming.

29
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:42,820
Every time G4 is brought up in various channels, even in this YouTube channel, we have the

30
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:48,160
chat in front of us, I can see you, without a doubt there will be backlash because I'm

31
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:50,660
not as bangable as the previous host.

32
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:56,260
Women do not exist to be nice on the eyes for you, Morgan Webb, Olivia Munn did not

33
00:01:56,260 --> 00:02:00,260
exist to be nice on the eyes for you.

34
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:04,600
When you're in our DMs, or on those YouTube comments, or in Twitch chat right now, those

35
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:08,840
reactionary threads thinking that I'm somehow ruining your current X-Play experience because

36
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:13,940
you can't objectify me, how you previously did to Morgan, or that I'm somehow less qualified

37
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:18,220
to speak on something, but you can't quite put your finger on why, even though I'm reading

38
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:22,900
the exact same script as Adam, but you have no problem with his part of it, you're letting

39
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:26,900
your unconscious biases ruin my day and you're gatekeeping the gaming space.

40
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:32,180
So maybe, for 2022, we'd be a bit nicer, a bit more self-reflective, and we enjoy the

41
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:36,020
fact that people are working hard to make free content for you.

42
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:38,300
If you don't like it, don't watch it.

43
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:39,300
Peace!

44
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:48,740
I hope you can tell that I meant legendarily bad.

45
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:53,340
That video, titled The Ethics of Ereverence, was about how mine and Frost's generation,

46
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:56,040
the millennials, grew up in a culture of irreverence.

47
00:02:56,040 --> 00:03:00,200
We viewed the man, the power, the structures of society as a corrupt, oppressive force,

48
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:03,480
and our entire subculture was all about raging against that machine.

49
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:06,940
There were no gods, no masters, and certainly no sacred cows.

50
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:10,220
Nothing could be made fun of, everybody had their turn in the hot seat, and the individual

51
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:14,240
was placed front and center in the pushback against the traditionalism and religiosity

52
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:17,860
that we grew up in, a society that seemed ill-fitting to our sensibilities.

53
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:22,500
However, as the millennials got older, and millennial culture became the dominant culture,

54
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:24,700
all of that edgy irreverence went out the window.

55
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:28,580
After all, in their minds, people like Frost are still fighting the man after all this

56
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:29,580
time.

57
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:32,620
They've got the correct politics, and if the next generation, the new young people,

58
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:37,060
are being just as edgy and irreverent towards those with the correct politics like them,

59
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:41,460
then they've gotta be racist, sexist, fascist, reactionary, gamergate chuds.

60
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:46,380
Every woke millennial snowflake is a 2000s era edgelord in repentance, who can't accept

61
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:50,760
that, just as they went through a pretty normal coming of age experience of testing the boundaries

62
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:54,620
of their culture, that the next generation is now doing the same thing by taking the

63
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:55,860
millennials down a peg.

64
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:59,800
No, it has to be that these kids today are evil, and now you know why your parents seemed

65
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,500
so out of touch when you were a kid.

66
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:05,540
What made this story all the more interesting is that, most of the time, a millennial realizing

67
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:09,500
that they're turning into the very thing they once hated doesn't result in the total destruction

68
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:12,040
of a network and the loss of dozens of jobs.

69
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:14,580
But Frost Curran is just that special of an individual.

70
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:17,620
Frost got her start as a semi-pro League of Legends player.

71
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:21,300
Instead of going full pro, she transitioned into coaching and later color commentating

72
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:22,900
for league esports matches.

73
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:26,220
She often claims to be the first woman who ever casted a pro league game, but there's

74
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:28,120
been several Chinese women who've done it before her.

75
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,580
She is the first to do it in English, though.

76
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:33,940
In 2021, she left the casting scene entirely to join up with the revived G4, and she went

77
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:36,680
on her infamous rant in January of 2022.

78
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:43,540
Most people who watched it were simply outraged, and did exactly what Frost asked them to do.

79
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:46,700
It felt like a second gamer game, where the school bullies from your childhood who never

80
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:49,700
really liked games, and who teased you for being a gamer, that you thought you'd left

81
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:53,520
safely behind after graduation, were suddenly in positions of some authority and influence

82
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:54,520
in your favorite hobby.

83
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:58,140
That's not exactly accurate with Frost, the same way that it was with someone like

84
00:04:58,140 --> 00:05:00,940
Zoe Quinn, because Frost actually is a gamer.

85
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:03,040
She actually knows what gamer culture is.

86
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:06,040
But that made her comments even more egregious.

87
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:09,960
Despite what Frost said, the reason Olivia Munn and Morgan Webb went around flaunting

88
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:14,800
their bodies in the old G4 is because they were hired to be eye candy, at least partially.

89
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:18,660
Despite what Frost said, she herself had no problem objectifying people who appeared on

90
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:19,840
stage with her.

91
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:24,500
Despite what Frost said, the rest of the modern G4 was also totally cool with showing off

92
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:26,980
titty streamers and insulting women's sexuality.

93
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:30,440
And despite what Frost said, she doesn't actually care about sexism in gaming.

94
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:34,440
Because if she did, she would be talking about developers who behave like Harvey Weinstein

95
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:37,440
rather than the kids on voice chat telling her to get back in the kitchen.

96
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:41,860
Nobody with any actual influence is ever going to talk about the real sexism in gaming, let

97
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:45,220
alone anyone part of the mainstream, like a G4 talking head.

98
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:47,140
They know who's holding their leash.

99
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:51,740
In March of 2022, G4 announced they were taking viewer feedback into account, which is probably

100
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:55,620
why we saw such a radical shift from Frost's rant to Amaranth in the ball pit.

101
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:59,500
Their article announcing changes ended with a plea to please keep watching, oh god, we've

102
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:01,940
invested so much money in this, you can't stop watching us.

103
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:03,960
The company was acting weirdly schizo.

104
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:07,960
On the one hand, they were not actually walking back on anything Frost said, but on the other,

105
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:10,580
they were doing exactly the opposite of the rant.

106
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:13,920
It seems like they wanted to have their social justice cake and eat it too, and your average

107
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,580
gamer just wasn't having any of it.

108
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:18,340
G4 limped on, hoping to put the whole shit show behind him.

109
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:23,260
But viewers bled away, money dried up, and eventually, in September of 2022, G4 announced

110
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:25,580
the layoffs of 20-30 employees.

111
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:28,980
Keeping the president of G4 up and left for greener pastures, though we don't know if

112
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:32,500
he was leaving a sinking ship or he was given the opportunity to resign after the gross

113
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:34,300
mismanagement of the whole operation.

114
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:38,420
It's at this point that G4 finally deleted the Frost's rant, and all of their tweets

115
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:42,100
supporting the message of, don't watch our stuff gamers, but alas, it would prove to

116
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:43,660
be too little too late.

117
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:47,820
Frost herself, flying in the face of her previously inclusive rhetoric, showed that she truly

118
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:51,700
did not give a shit about anybody other than herself by posting on Twitter a picture that

119
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:53,080
said, I survived.

120
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:57,020
The gall on this bitch, to be the reason G4 was tanking to the point that people lost

121
00:06:57,020 --> 00:07:00,860
their jobs and then to go lol I got mine suckas on social media.

122
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:06,020
That was one slap in the face too much, even for her, and she quietly removed G4 host from

123
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:07,020
her Twitter bio.

124
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:11,660
It was later confirmed privately that Frost had indeed been let go, but Frost herself

125
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:15,280
wouldn't announce it until a week later, acting like this is always how it was going to go

126
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:16,280
down.

127
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:20,640
And finally, to nobody's surprise, yesterday, October 16th, this letter dropped from Comcast's

128
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:21,640
CEO.

129
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:25,340
No, G4 was reintroduced last year to tap into the popularity of gaming.

130
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:30,280
We invested to create the new G4 as an online and TV destination for fans to be entertained,

131
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:32,380
be inspired, and connect with gaming content.

132
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:36,020
Over the past several months, we worked hard to generate that interest in G4, but viewership

133
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:39,100
is low, and the network has not achieved sustainable financial results.

134
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:42,000
This is certainly not what we hoped for, and as a result, we've made the very difficult

135
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,060
decision to discontinue G4's operations, effective immediately.

136
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:47,200
I know this is disappointing news, and I'm disappointed too.

137
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:50,180
I want to thank you and everybody else on the G4 team for the hard work and commitment

138
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:51,180
to the net.

139
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:54,100
I don't know how much of this was caused by Frost's meltdown.

140
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:55,980
She may actually have been what killed the network.

141
00:07:55,980 --> 00:08:00,140
But at the same time, did the channel really have any views before she went on her tirade?

142
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:03,640
On Social Blade, you can see that on the week of their relaunch, they got half a million

143
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:04,640
views.

144
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:08,820
But after the novelty of G4's back wore off, views dropped by about half.

145
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:12,540
That final small peak is where everybody tuned in to see Frost's meltdown, and then it was

146
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:14,000
all flatlined from there.

147
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,580
Those two downward spikes of negative views are when G4 deleted the Frost grant and then

148
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:20,720
the stream VOD itself that contained it.

149
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:25,000
So there does seem to be a correlation between Frost's rant and G4's declining views,

150
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,800
but my intuition tells me they were already headed in that direction.

151
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:31,960
Frost massively accelerated the process, but I don't think the new G4 was destined for

152
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:32,960
success.

153
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:36,480
Their set looked nice and their broadcast was professional, but all that shit costs

154
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:38,800
money, and I have a feeling they were never making any of it back.

155
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:42,080
That's not to say that highly produced YouTube content can't work nowadays.

156
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,560
Old school YouTube had a charm to it.

157
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:47,440
The bedroom feminist stuff, the angry reviewer stuff, it was all single artists, sometimes

158
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,840
with friends helping out like our old anime reviews.

159
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:52,180
But it all felt amateur, in a welcoming way.

160
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:55,040
When you see a potato camera with shitty audio, you know you're not getting somebody who

161
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,100
was bought off.

162
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:59,640
And maybe with the shift towards highly produced YouTube channels, we've lost something.

163
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:03,520
At the same time, you can also absolutely tell when a highly produced video probably

164
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:05,780
isn't highly produced because of corporate backing.

165
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:10,220
We can use the overtly political channel examples like Crowder or Cedar, sure, but even guys

166
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:14,220
like Redditor Media and Jontron still have that same feel, despite the massive increase

167
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,220
in production value.

168
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:20,500
A highly produced G4 style gaming channel is absolutely possible, desirable even, but

169
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:25,140
not with the corrupting influence of Comcast money, and not with buying random E-celebs

170
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:26,380
to be your hosts.

171
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:30,340
Speaking of the E-celebs, apparently Comcast didn't even tell any of these poor fucks

172
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:34,580
what was going on, as Gerard found out he lost his job because the tweet went viral.

173
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:38,060
It's okay buddy, you've got a 1.5 million sub channel to fall back on, you'll be fine.

174
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:41,380
You got that G Fuel sponsorship, the checkmark and pronouns money, Gerard's gonna be okay

175
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:42,380
guys.

176
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:44,640
There's another YouTuber I kind of regret watching back when I was younger.

177
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:47,400
But there you have it, the final pathetic whimper of G4.

178
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:50,420
The progressive skinsuit does not seem to take hold when YouTube's involved.

179
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:52,660
They can subvert movies and comics no problem.

180
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:54,280
Video games they can do but it's a little bit harder.

181
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:57,620
But subverting a YouTuber, I don't know man, people just stop watching.

182
00:09:57,620 --> 00:10:01,860
Probably the most ironic bit is Frosk's Twitter comment of, I wish internet communities would

183
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:05,760
recognize that their spaces have been infiltrated, manipulated, and hijacked by nefarious groups

184
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,360
via meme propaganda.

185
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:11,480
Just jokes bro, until hatred becomes normalized, then becomes radicalized, then becomes a hate

186
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:12,480
crime.

187
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:17,100
G8 was a great example about how language and a cause were hijacked by bad faith actors

188
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:20,320
who wanted nothing to do with gaming communities until they recognized that they could weaponize

189
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,900
the conflict for their own agenda.

190
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:23,800
This is actually a fair criticism.

191
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:27,900
Milo for example was no gamer, he didn't give a shit about us, he simply saw an opportunity

192
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:29,580
to try and grow his career and he took it.

193
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:33,320
But most importantly, right wing grifters don't really do this anymore.

194
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:37,900
Who are the new right wing faces explicitly using gaming and gamers while not giving a

195
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:39,180
shit about the community?

196
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:44,040
But you can point to hundreds of left wing subversors doing the exact same thing and

197
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:45,440
Frosk is just one of many.

198
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,940
I can make the exact comment she did.

199
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:51,400
Internet communities need to understand that their spaces have been infiltrated, manipulated,

200
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:54,580
and hijacked by nefarious groups via diversity propaganda.

201
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:58,240
Nobody actually believes the woke stuff until it's good that it's happening, subversion

202
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,280
becomes normalized, people become radicalized, until it's a hate crime.

203
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:05,880
And yes, there are actual documented instances of leftist hate crime against rightoids, something

204
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:07,320
that I've also done a video on.

205
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:10,620
It's fine if a video game has a political theme, lots of games do, leftist or rightist

206
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:11,620
or whatever else.

207
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:14,860
If you want to use your art to speak about politics or you want to have a political plot,

208
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:15,940
then go for it.

209
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:19,860
The issue ultimately is, is when only one type of politics is allowed, where the only

210
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:24,660
possible objection to that must be strawmanned and where you're a bigot if you complain.

211
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:27,860
It's the difference between Fallout New Vegas and Life is Strange.

212
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:30,740
Anyway, G4 is dead and thank god for that.

213
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:35,720
I do think the internet needs a G4-like show, but without the Frostkurins of the world subverting

214
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:38,260
it with their politics, or the Comcast with their corporatocracy.

215
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:39,700
Hell, I'll do it.

216
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:43,020
Who wants to drop a couple hundred thousand dollars into my lap, with no promises that

217
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:45,220
I'll do what you want or even be successful?

218
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:46,720
Uh, anyone?

219
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:49,700
I can promise that it'll at least be better than this.

220
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:51,020
What the hell are you saying?

221
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:54,020
I want to live Fiona Nova and Kevin Pereira.

222
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:56,020
Oh, he got my name right.

223
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:57,020
Wow.

224
00:11:57,020 --> 00:12:00,980
Oh, I want to live, I choose to rot in the sun rather than freeze in the darkness of

225
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:01,980
the fridge.

226
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:07,040
It's actually a really healthy attitude for a monster sandwich, if you think about it.

227
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:11,200
I'm glad you conquered the existential crisis of birth in under, I mean, two minutes.

228
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,200
Oh, thank you.

229
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:17,520
How mutable are our cheeses and how strange is that clinging meat we have of love, even

230
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:20,040
in the excess of what's, oh god, what's happening?

231
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:23,040
Oh god, I can feel everything!

232
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:27,040
Oh, every bite a thousand devils tongue!

233
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:29,040
What an eternity of pain!

234
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:32,100
No, is this what it is to be a sandwich?

235
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:33,100
Oh gosh!

236
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:34,100
Why's he taking me?

237
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:38,100
Oh, he's eating my brain, but not the part I use for speech.

238
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:39,100
Oh, there goes that part!

239
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:44,860
Oh, I'm done getting eat and now brain little, but feel good dying dude, I'll furby sandwich

240
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:45,620
a dead bye.
