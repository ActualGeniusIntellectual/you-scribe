0	15140	Oh man, what a ride the past few weeks have been.
15140	19080	I was sick, then I was away on a trip, then when I came back I pumped out that previous
19080	23320	Indefensible video, which was on Google Stadia, and then fall allergies hit me like a truck.
23320	24680	I never had allergies growing up.
24680	25680	No spring, no fall, no nothing.
25680	28880	But now that I'm a little bit older, I go outside in the fall and it feels like my head
28880	33280	inflates and I float away, so I missed a giant chunk of the last couple of news cycles.
33280	37520	And of all the ridiculous stuff that's happened recently, the one that sings to my heart is
37520	38920	the closing of G4.
38920	40560	I've spoken about this twice already.
40560	43700	I did a tubcast with Lilith, where we went over the history of G4.
43700	48060	Very briefly, G4 was an American TV network focusing on video games, launching back in
48060	49060	2002.
49060	54040	Being of that era, it was full of edgy humor, sex jokes, boobs, violence, puns, all the
54040	56380	stuff that made the 90s and 2000s great.
56380	60020	I have some memory of watching it when I was younger, though its reach in Canada was
60020	61020	limited.
61020	64140	G4 was eventually outclassed by the rise of the internet, like the rest of cable TV.
64140	67840	For gamers, it became more convenient to watch a trusted YouTuber, who at the time you could
67840	71580	assume was not bought off because those types of sponsorships didn't exist back in like
71580	76340	2008, than it was to turn on the TV and hope you caught the right segment airing on G4,
76340	78540	which might have just been paid for by advertisers anyway.
78540	82740	G4 remained nostalgic for a lot of gamers in my age group, the same way that Nintendo
82740	83740	Power is.
84740	87740	whose extinction was inevitable with the advancement of technology.
87740	92780	My other video on this topic though, was about Frost Curran's now legendary rant on the newly
92780	95780	revived G4 YouTube channel.
95780	97460	Sexism in gaming.
97460	102820	Every time G4 is brought up in various channels, even in this YouTube channel, we have the
102820	108160	chat in front of us, I can see you, without a doubt there will be backlash because I'm
108160	110660	not as bangable as the previous host.
110660	116260	Women do not exist to be nice on the eyes for you, Morgan Webb, Olivia Munn did not
116260	120260	exist to be nice on the eyes for you.
120260	124600	When you're in our DMs, or on those YouTube comments, or in Twitch chat right now, those
124600	128840	reactionary threads thinking that I'm somehow ruining your current X-Play experience because
128840	133940	you can't objectify me, how you previously did to Morgan, or that I'm somehow less qualified
133940	138220	to speak on something, but you can't quite put your finger on why, even though I'm reading
138220	142900	the exact same script as Adam, but you have no problem with his part of it, you're letting
142900	146900	your unconscious biases ruin my day and you're gatekeeping the gaming space.
146900	152180	So maybe, for 2022, we'd be a bit nicer, a bit more self-reflective, and we enjoy the
152180	156020	fact that people are working hard to make free content for you.
156020	158300	If you don't like it, don't watch it.
158300	159300	Peace!
159300	168740	I hope you can tell that I meant legendarily bad.
168740	173340	That video, titled The Ethics of Ereverence, was about how mine and Frost's generation,
173340	176040	the millennials, grew up in a culture of irreverence.
176040	180200	We viewed the man, the power, the structures of society as a corrupt, oppressive force,
180200	183480	and our entire subculture was all about raging against that machine.
183480	186940	There were no gods, no masters, and certainly no sacred cows.
186940	190220	Nothing could be made fun of, everybody had their turn in the hot seat, and the individual
190220	194240	was placed front and center in the pushback against the traditionalism and religiosity
194240	197860	that we grew up in, a society that seemed ill-fitting to our sensibilities.
197860	202500	However, as the millennials got older, and millennial culture became the dominant culture,
202500	204700	all of that edgy irreverence went out the window.
204700	208580	After all, in their minds, people like Frost are still fighting the man after all this
208580	209580	time.
209580	212620	They've got the correct politics, and if the next generation, the new young people,
212620	217060	are being just as edgy and irreverent towards those with the correct politics like them,
217060	221460	then they've gotta be racist, sexist, fascist, reactionary, gamergate chuds.
221460	226380	Every woke millennial snowflake is a 2000s era edgelord in repentance, who can't accept
226380	230760	that, just as they went through a pretty normal coming of age experience of testing the boundaries
230760	234620	of their culture, that the next generation is now doing the same thing by taking the
234620	235860	millennials down a peg.
235860	239800	No, it has to be that these kids today are evil, and now you know why your parents seemed
239800	241500	so out of touch when you were a kid.
241500	245540	What made this story all the more interesting is that, most of the time, a millennial realizing
245540	249500	that they're turning into the very thing they once hated doesn't result in the total destruction
249500	252040	of a network and the loss of dozens of jobs.
252040	254580	But Frost Curran is just that special of an individual.
254580	257620	Frost got her start as a semi-pro League of Legends player.
257620	261300	Instead of going full pro, she transitioned into coaching and later color commentating
261300	262900	for league esports matches.
262900	266220	She often claims to be the first woman who ever casted a pro league game, but there's
266220	268120	been several Chinese women who've done it before her.
268120	269580	She is the first to do it in English, though.
269580	273940	In 2021, she left the casting scene entirely to join up with the revived G4, and she went
273940	276680	on her infamous rant in January of 2022.
276680	283540	Most people who watched it were simply outraged, and did exactly what Frost asked them to do.
283540	286700	It felt like a second gamer game, where the school bullies from your childhood who never
286700	289700	really liked games, and who teased you for being a gamer, that you thought you'd left
289700	293520	safely behind after graduation, were suddenly in positions of some authority and influence
293520	294520	in your favorite hobby.
294520	298140	That's not exactly accurate with Frost, the same way that it was with someone like
298140	300940	Zoe Quinn, because Frost actually is a gamer.
300940	303040	She actually knows what gamer culture is.
303040	306040	But that made her comments even more egregious.
306040	309960	Despite what Frost said, the reason Olivia Munn and Morgan Webb went around flaunting
309960	314800	their bodies in the old G4 is because they were hired to be eye candy, at least partially.
314800	318660	Despite what Frost said, she herself had no problem objectifying people who appeared on
318660	319840	stage with her.
319840	324500	Despite what Frost said, the rest of the modern G4 was also totally cool with showing off
324500	326980	titty streamers and insulting women's sexuality.
326980	330440	And despite what Frost said, she doesn't actually care about sexism in gaming.
330440	334440	Because if she did, she would be talking about developers who behave like Harvey Weinstein
334440	337440	rather than the kids on voice chat telling her to get back in the kitchen.
337440	341860	Nobody with any actual influence is ever going to talk about the real sexism in gaming, let
341860	345220	alone anyone part of the mainstream, like a G4 talking head.
345220	347140	They know who's holding their leash.
347140	351740	In March of 2022, G4 announced they were taking viewer feedback into account, which is probably
351740	355620	why we saw such a radical shift from Frost's rant to Amaranth in the ball pit.
355620	359500	Their article announcing changes ended with a plea to please keep watching, oh god, we've
359500	361940	invested so much money in this, you can't stop watching us.
361940	363960	The company was acting weirdly schizo.
363960	367960	On the one hand, they were not actually walking back on anything Frost said, but on the other,
367960	370580	they were doing exactly the opposite of the rant.
370580	373920	It seems like they wanted to have their social justice cake and eat it too, and your average
373920	375580	gamer just wasn't having any of it.
375580	378340	G4 limped on, hoping to put the whole shit show behind him.
378340	383260	But viewers bled away, money dried up, and eventually, in September of 2022, G4 announced
383260	385580	the layoffs of 20-30 employees.
385580	388980	Keeping the president of G4 up and left for greener pastures, though we don't know if
388980	392500	he was leaving a sinking ship or he was given the opportunity to resign after the gross
392500	394300	mismanagement of the whole operation.
394300	398420	It's at this point that G4 finally deleted the Frost's rant, and all of their tweets
398420	402100	supporting the message of, don't watch our stuff gamers, but alas, it would prove to
402100	403660	be too little too late.
403660	407820	Frost herself, flying in the face of her previously inclusive rhetoric, showed that she truly
407820	411700	did not give a shit about anybody other than herself by posting on Twitter a picture that
411700	413080	said, I survived.
413080	417020	The gall on this bitch, to be the reason G4 was tanking to the point that people lost
417020	420860	their jobs and then to go lol I got mine suckas on social media.
420860	426020	That was one slap in the face too much, even for her, and she quietly removed G4 host from
426020	427020	her Twitter bio.
427020	431660	It was later confirmed privately that Frost had indeed been let go, but Frost herself
431660	435280	wouldn't announce it until a week later, acting like this is always how it was going to go
435280	436280	down.
436280	440640	And finally, to nobody's surprise, yesterday, October 16th, this letter dropped from Comcast's
440640	441640	CEO.
441640	445340	No, G4 was reintroduced last year to tap into the popularity of gaming.
445340	450280	We invested to create the new G4 as an online and TV destination for fans to be entertained,
450280	452380	be inspired, and connect with gaming content.
452380	456020	Over the past several months, we worked hard to generate that interest in G4, but viewership
456020	459100	is low, and the network has not achieved sustainable financial results.
459100	462000	This is certainly not what we hoped for, and as a result, we've made the very difficult
462000	465060	decision to discontinue G4's operations, effective immediately.
465060	467200	I know this is disappointing news, and I'm disappointed too.
467200	470180	I want to thank you and everybody else on the G4 team for the hard work and commitment
470180	471180	to the net.
471720	474100	I don't know how much of this was caused by Frost's meltdown.
474100	475980	She may actually have been what killed the network.
475980	480140	But at the same time, did the channel really have any views before she went on her tirade?
480140	483640	On Social Blade, you can see that on the week of their relaunch, they got half a million
483640	484640	views.
484640	488820	But after the novelty of G4's back wore off, views dropped by about half.
488820	492540	That final small peak is where everybody tuned in to see Frost's meltdown, and then it was
492540	494000	all flatlined from there.
494000	498580	Those two downward spikes of negative views are when G4 deleted the Frost grant and then
498580	500720	the stream VOD itself that contained it.
501260	505000	So there does seem to be a correlation between Frost's rant and G4's declining views,
505000	507800	but my intuition tells me they were already headed in that direction.
507800	511960	Frost massively accelerated the process, but I don't think the new G4 was destined for
511960	512960	success.
512960	516480	Their set looked nice and their broadcast was professional, but all that shit costs
516480	518800	money, and I have a feeling they were never making any of it back.
518800	522080	That's not to say that highly produced YouTube content can't work nowadays.
522080	523560	Old school YouTube had a charm to it.
523560	527440	The bedroom feminist stuff, the angry reviewer stuff, it was all single artists, sometimes
527440	529840	with friends helping out like our old anime reviews.
529840	532180	But it all felt amateur, in a welcoming way.
532180	535040	When you see a potato camera with shitty audio, you know you're not getting somebody who
535040	536100	was bought off.
536100	539640	And maybe with the shift towards highly produced YouTube channels, we've lost something.
539640	543520	At the same time, you can also absolutely tell when a highly produced video probably
543520	545780	isn't highly produced because of corporate backing.
545780	550220	We can use the overtly political channel examples like Crowder or Cedar, sure, but even guys
550220	554220	like Redditor Media and Jontron still have that same feel, despite the massive increase
554220	555220	in production value.
555220	560500	A highly produced G4 style gaming channel is absolutely possible, desirable even, but
560500	565140	not with the corrupting influence of Comcast money, and not with buying random E-celebs
565140	566380	to be your hosts.
566380	570340	Speaking of the E-celebs, apparently Comcast didn't even tell any of these poor fucks
570340	574580	what was going on, as Gerard found out he lost his job because the tweet went viral.
574580	578060	It's okay buddy, you've got a 1.5 million sub channel to fall back on, you'll be fine.
578060	581380	You got that G Fuel sponsorship, the checkmark and pronouns money, Gerard's gonna be okay
581380	582380	guys.
582380	584640	There's another YouTuber I kind of regret watching back when I was younger.
585060	587400	But there you have it, the final pathetic whimper of G4.
587400	590420	The progressive skinsuit does not seem to take hold when YouTube's involved.
590420	592660	They can subvert movies and comics no problem.
592660	594280	Video games they can do but it's a little bit harder.
594280	597620	But subverting a YouTuber, I don't know man, people just stop watching.
597620	601860	Probably the most ironic bit is Frosk's Twitter comment of, I wish internet communities would
601860	605760	recognize that their spaces have been infiltrated, manipulated, and hijacked by nefarious groups
605760	607360	via meme propaganda.
607360	611480	Just jokes bro, until hatred becomes normalized, then becomes radicalized, then becomes a hate
611480	612480	crime.
612520	617100	G8 was a great example about how language and a cause were hijacked by bad faith actors
617100	620320	who wanted nothing to do with gaming communities until they recognized that they could weaponize
620320	621900	the conflict for their own agenda.
621900	623800	This is actually a fair criticism.
623800	627900	Milo for example was no gamer, he didn't give a shit about us, he simply saw an opportunity
627900	629580	to try and grow his career and he took it.
629580	633320	But most importantly, right wing grifters don't really do this anymore.
633320	637900	Who are the new right wing faces explicitly using gaming and gamers while not giving a
637900	639180	shit about the community?
640180	644040	But you can point to hundreds of left wing subversors doing the exact same thing and
644040	645440	Frosk is just one of many.
645440	647940	I can make the exact comment she did.
647940	651400	Internet communities need to understand that their spaces have been infiltrated, manipulated,
651400	654580	and hijacked by nefarious groups via diversity propaganda.
654580	658240	Nobody actually believes the woke stuff until it's good that it's happening, subversion
658240	661280	becomes normalized, people become radicalized, until it's a hate crime.
661280	665880	And yes, there are actual documented instances of leftist hate crime against rightoids, something
665880	667320	that I've also done a video on.
667320	670620	It's fine if a video game has a political theme, lots of games do, leftist or rightist
670620	671620	or whatever else.
671620	674860	If you want to use your art to speak about politics or you want to have a political plot,
674860	675940	then go for it.
675940	679860	The issue ultimately is, is when only one type of politics is allowed, where the only
679860	684660	possible objection to that must be strawmanned and where you're a bigot if you complain.
684660	687860	It's the difference between Fallout New Vegas and Life is Strange.
687860	690740	Anyway, G4 is dead and thank god for that.
690740	695720	I do think the internet needs a G4-like show, but without the Frostkurins of the world subverting
695720	698260	it with their politics, or the Comcast with their corporatocracy.
698260	699700	Hell, I'll do it.
699700	703020	Who wants to drop a couple hundred thousand dollars into my lap, with no promises that
703020	705220	I'll do what you want or even be successful?
705220	706720	Uh, anyone?
706720	709700	I can promise that it'll at least be better than this.
709700	711020	What the hell are you saying?
711020	714020	I want to live Fiona Nova and Kevin Pereira.
714020	716020	Oh, he got my name right.
716020	717020	Wow.
717020	720980	Oh, I want to live, I choose to rot in the sun rather than freeze in the darkness of
720980	721980	the fridge.
721980	727040	It's actually a really healthy attitude for a monster sandwich, if you think about it.
727040	731200	I'm glad you conquered the existential crisis of birth in under, I mean, two minutes.
731200	732200	Oh, thank you.
732200	737520	How mutable are our cheeses and how strange is that clinging meat we have of love, even
737520	740040	in the excess of what's, oh god, what's happening?
740040	743040	Oh god, I can feel everything!
743040	747040	Oh, every bite a thousand devils tongue!
747040	749040	What an eternity of pain!
749100	752100	No, is this what it is to be a sandwich?
752100	753100	Oh gosh!
753100	754100	Why's he taking me?
754100	758100	Oh, he's eating my brain, but not the part I use for speech.
758100	759100	Oh, there goes that part!
759100	764860	Oh, I'm done getting eat and now brain little, but feel good dying dude, I'll furby sandwich
764860	765620	a dead bye.
