WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:15.140
Oh man, what a ride the past few weeks have been.

00:15.140 --> 00:19.080
I was sick, then I was away on a trip, then when I came back I pumped out that previous

00:19.080 --> 00:23.320
Indefensible video, which was on Google Stadia, and then fall allergies hit me like a truck.

00:23.320 --> 00:24.680
I never had allergies growing up.

00:24.680 --> 00:25.680
No spring, no fall, no nothing.

00:25.680 --> 00:28.880
But now that I'm a little bit older, I go outside in the fall and it feels like my head

00:28.880 --> 00:33.280
inflates and I float away, so I missed a giant chunk of the last couple of news cycles.

00:33.280 --> 00:37.520
And of all the ridiculous stuff that's happened recently, the one that sings to my heart is

00:37.520 --> 00:38.920
the closing of G4.

00:38.920 --> 00:40.560
I've spoken about this twice already.

00:40.560 --> 00:43.700
I did a tubcast with Lilith, where we went over the history of G4.

00:43.700 --> 00:48.060
Very briefly, G4 was an American TV network focusing on video games, launching back in

00:48.060 --> 00:49.060
2002.

00:49.060 --> 00:54.040
Being of that era, it was full of edgy humor, sex jokes, boobs, violence, puns, all the

00:54.040 --> 00:56.380
stuff that made the 90s and 2000s great.

00:56.380 --> 01:00.020
I have some memory of watching it when I was younger, though its reach in Canada was

01:00.020 --> 01:01.020
limited.

01:01.020 --> 01:04.140
G4 was eventually outclassed by the rise of the internet, like the rest of cable TV.

01:04.140 --> 01:07.840
For gamers, it became more convenient to watch a trusted YouTuber, who at the time you could

01:07.840 --> 01:11.580
assume was not bought off because those types of sponsorships didn't exist back in like

01:11.580 --> 01:16.340
2008, than it was to turn on the TV and hope you caught the right segment airing on G4,

01:16.340 --> 01:18.540
which might have just been paid for by advertisers anyway.

01:18.540 --> 01:22.740
G4 remained nostalgic for a lot of gamers in my age group, the same way that Nintendo

01:22.740 --> 01:23.740
Power is.

01:24.740 --> 01:27.740
whose extinction was inevitable with the advancement of technology.

01:27.740 --> 01:32.780
My other video on this topic though, was about Frost Curran's now legendary rant on the newly

01:32.780 --> 01:35.780
revived G4 YouTube channel.

01:35.780 --> 01:37.460
Sexism in gaming.

01:37.460 --> 01:42.820
Every time G4 is brought up in various channels, even in this YouTube channel, we have the

01:42.820 --> 01:48.160
chat in front of us, I can see you, without a doubt there will be backlash because I'm

01:48.160 --> 01:50.660
not as bangable as the previous host.

01:50.660 --> 01:56.260
Women do not exist to be nice on the eyes for you, Morgan Webb, Olivia Munn did not

01:56.260 --> 02:00.260
exist to be nice on the eyes for you.

02:00.260 --> 02:04.600
When you're in our DMs, or on those YouTube comments, or in Twitch chat right now, those

02:04.600 --> 02:08.840
reactionary threads thinking that I'm somehow ruining your current X-Play experience because

02:08.840 --> 02:13.940
you can't objectify me, how you previously did to Morgan, or that I'm somehow less qualified

02:13.940 --> 02:18.220
to speak on something, but you can't quite put your finger on why, even though I'm reading

02:18.220 --> 02:22.900
the exact same script as Adam, but you have no problem with his part of it, you're letting

02:22.900 --> 02:26.900
your unconscious biases ruin my day and you're gatekeeping the gaming space.

02:26.900 --> 02:32.180
So maybe, for 2022, we'd be a bit nicer, a bit more self-reflective, and we enjoy the

02:32.180 --> 02:36.020
fact that people are working hard to make free content for you.

02:36.020 --> 02:38.300
If you don't like it, don't watch it.

02:38.300 --> 02:39.300
Peace!

02:39.300 --> 02:48.740
I hope you can tell that I meant legendarily bad.

02:48.740 --> 02:53.340
That video, titled The Ethics of Ereverence, was about how mine and Frost's generation,

02:53.340 --> 02:56.040
the millennials, grew up in a culture of irreverence.

02:56.040 --> 03:00.200
We viewed the man, the power, the structures of society as a corrupt, oppressive force,

03:00.200 --> 03:03.480
and our entire subculture was all about raging against that machine.

03:03.480 --> 03:06.940
There were no gods, no masters, and certainly no sacred cows.

03:06.940 --> 03:10.220
Nothing could be made fun of, everybody had their turn in the hot seat, and the individual

03:10.220 --> 03:14.240
was placed front and center in the pushback against the traditionalism and religiosity

03:14.240 --> 03:17.860
that we grew up in, a society that seemed ill-fitting to our sensibilities.

03:17.860 --> 03:22.500
However, as the millennials got older, and millennial culture became the dominant culture,

03:22.500 --> 03:24.700
all of that edgy irreverence went out the window.

03:24.700 --> 03:28.580
After all, in their minds, people like Frost are still fighting the man after all this

03:28.580 --> 03:29.580
time.

03:29.580 --> 03:32.620
They've got the correct politics, and if the next generation, the new young people,

03:32.620 --> 03:37.060
are being just as edgy and irreverent towards those with the correct politics like them,

03:37.060 --> 03:41.460
then they've gotta be racist, sexist, fascist, reactionary, gamergate chuds.

03:41.460 --> 03:46.380
Every woke millennial snowflake is a 2000s era edgelord in repentance, who can't accept

03:46.380 --> 03:50.760
that, just as they went through a pretty normal coming of age experience of testing the boundaries

03:50.760 --> 03:54.620
of their culture, that the next generation is now doing the same thing by taking the

03:54.620 --> 03:55.860
millennials down a peg.

03:55.860 --> 03:59.800
No, it has to be that these kids today are evil, and now you know why your parents seemed

03:59.800 --> 04:01.500
so out of touch when you were a kid.

04:01.500 --> 04:05.540
What made this story all the more interesting is that, most of the time, a millennial realizing

04:05.540 --> 04:09.500
that they're turning into the very thing they once hated doesn't result in the total destruction

04:09.500 --> 04:12.040
of a network and the loss of dozens of jobs.

04:12.040 --> 04:14.580
But Frost Curran is just that special of an individual.

04:14.580 --> 04:17.620
Frost got her start as a semi-pro League of Legends player.

04:17.620 --> 04:21.300
Instead of going full pro, she transitioned into coaching and later color commentating

04:21.300 --> 04:22.900
for league esports matches.

04:22.900 --> 04:26.220
She often claims to be the first woman who ever casted a pro league game, but there's

04:26.220 --> 04:28.120
been several Chinese women who've done it before her.

04:28.120 --> 04:29.580
She is the first to do it in English, though.

04:29.580 --> 04:33.940
In 2021, she left the casting scene entirely to join up with the revived G4, and she went

04:33.940 --> 04:36.680
on her infamous rant in January of 2022.

04:36.680 --> 04:43.540
Most people who watched it were simply outraged, and did exactly what Frost asked them to do.

04:43.540 --> 04:46.700
It felt like a second gamer game, where the school bullies from your childhood who never

04:46.700 --> 04:49.700
really liked games, and who teased you for being a gamer, that you thought you'd left

04:49.700 --> 04:53.520
safely behind after graduation, were suddenly in positions of some authority and influence

04:53.520 --> 04:54.520
in your favorite hobby.

04:54.520 --> 04:58.140
That's not exactly accurate with Frost, the same way that it was with someone like

04:58.140 --> 05:00.940
Zoe Quinn, because Frost actually is a gamer.

05:00.940 --> 05:03.040
She actually knows what gamer culture is.

05:03.040 --> 05:06.040
But that made her comments even more egregious.

05:06.040 --> 05:09.960
Despite what Frost said, the reason Olivia Munn and Morgan Webb went around flaunting

05:09.960 --> 05:14.800
their bodies in the old G4 is because they were hired to be eye candy, at least partially.

05:14.800 --> 05:18.660
Despite what Frost said, she herself had no problem objectifying people who appeared on

05:18.660 --> 05:19.840
stage with her.

05:19.840 --> 05:24.500
Despite what Frost said, the rest of the modern G4 was also totally cool with showing off

05:24.500 --> 05:26.980
titty streamers and insulting women's sexuality.

05:26.980 --> 05:30.440
And despite what Frost said, she doesn't actually care about sexism in gaming.

05:30.440 --> 05:34.440
Because if she did, she would be talking about developers who behave like Harvey Weinstein

05:34.440 --> 05:37.440
rather than the kids on voice chat telling her to get back in the kitchen.

05:37.440 --> 05:41.860
Nobody with any actual influence is ever going to talk about the real sexism in gaming, let

05:41.860 --> 05:45.220
alone anyone part of the mainstream, like a G4 talking head.

05:45.220 --> 05:47.140
They know who's holding their leash.

05:47.140 --> 05:51.740
In March of 2022, G4 announced they were taking viewer feedback into account, which is probably

05:51.740 --> 05:55.620
why we saw such a radical shift from Frost's rant to Amaranth in the ball pit.

05:55.620 --> 05:59.500
Their article announcing changes ended with a plea to please keep watching, oh god, we've

05:59.500 --> 06:01.940
invested so much money in this, you can't stop watching us.

06:01.940 --> 06:03.960
The company was acting weirdly schizo.

06:03.960 --> 06:07.960
On the one hand, they were not actually walking back on anything Frost said, but on the other,

06:07.960 --> 06:10.580
they were doing exactly the opposite of the rant.

06:10.580 --> 06:13.920
It seems like they wanted to have their social justice cake and eat it too, and your average

06:13.920 --> 06:15.580
gamer just wasn't having any of it.

06:15.580 --> 06:18.340
G4 limped on, hoping to put the whole shit show behind him.

06:18.340 --> 06:23.260
But viewers bled away, money dried up, and eventually, in September of 2022, G4 announced

06:23.260 --> 06:25.580
the layoffs of 20-30 employees.

06:25.580 --> 06:28.980
Keeping the president of G4 up and left for greener pastures, though we don't know if

06:28.980 --> 06:32.500
he was leaving a sinking ship or he was given the opportunity to resign after the gross

06:32.500 --> 06:34.300
mismanagement of the whole operation.

06:34.300 --> 06:38.420
It's at this point that G4 finally deleted the Frost's rant, and all of their tweets

06:38.420 --> 06:42.100
supporting the message of, don't watch our stuff gamers, but alas, it would prove to

06:42.100 --> 06:43.660
be too little too late.

06:43.660 --> 06:47.820
Frost herself, flying in the face of her previously inclusive rhetoric, showed that she truly

06:47.820 --> 06:51.700
did not give a shit about anybody other than herself by posting on Twitter a picture that

06:51.700 --> 06:53.080
said, I survived.

06:53.080 --> 06:57.020
The gall on this bitch, to be the reason G4 was tanking to the point that people lost

06:57.020 --> 07:00.860
their jobs and then to go lol I got mine suckas on social media.

07:00.860 --> 07:06.020
That was one slap in the face too much, even for her, and she quietly removed G4 host from

07:06.020 --> 07:07.020
her Twitter bio.

07:07.020 --> 07:11.660
It was later confirmed privately that Frost had indeed been let go, but Frost herself

07:11.660 --> 07:15.280
wouldn't announce it until a week later, acting like this is always how it was going to go

07:15.280 --> 07:16.280
down.

07:16.280 --> 07:20.640
And finally, to nobody's surprise, yesterday, October 16th, this letter dropped from Comcast's

07:20.640 --> 07:21.640
CEO.

07:21.640 --> 07:25.340
No, G4 was reintroduced last year to tap into the popularity of gaming.

07:25.340 --> 07:30.280
We invested to create the new G4 as an online and TV destination for fans to be entertained,

07:30.280 --> 07:32.380
be inspired, and connect with gaming content.

07:32.380 --> 07:36.020
Over the past several months, we worked hard to generate that interest in G4, but viewership

07:36.020 --> 07:39.100
is low, and the network has not achieved sustainable financial results.

07:39.100 --> 07:42.000
This is certainly not what we hoped for, and as a result, we've made the very difficult

07:42.000 --> 07:45.060
decision to discontinue G4's operations, effective immediately.

07:45.060 --> 07:47.200
I know this is disappointing news, and I'm disappointed too.

07:47.200 --> 07:50.180
I want to thank you and everybody else on the G4 team for the hard work and commitment

07:50.180 --> 07:51.180
to the net.

07:51.720 --> 07:54.100
I don't know how much of this was caused by Frost's meltdown.

07:54.100 --> 07:55.980
She may actually have been what killed the network.

07:55.980 --> 08:00.140
But at the same time, did the channel really have any views before she went on her tirade?

08:00.140 --> 08:03.640
On Social Blade, you can see that on the week of their relaunch, they got half a million

08:03.640 --> 08:04.640
views.

08:04.640 --> 08:08.820
But after the novelty of G4's back wore off, views dropped by about half.

08:08.820 --> 08:12.540
That final small peak is where everybody tuned in to see Frost's meltdown, and then it was

08:12.540 --> 08:14.000
all flatlined from there.

08:14.000 --> 08:18.580
Those two downward spikes of negative views are when G4 deleted the Frost grant and then

08:18.580 --> 08:20.720
the stream VOD itself that contained it.

08:21.260 --> 08:25.000
So there does seem to be a correlation between Frost's rant and G4's declining views,

08:25.000 --> 08:27.800
but my intuition tells me they were already headed in that direction.

08:27.800 --> 08:31.960
Frost massively accelerated the process, but I don't think the new G4 was destined for

08:31.960 --> 08:32.960
success.

08:32.960 --> 08:36.480
Their set looked nice and their broadcast was professional, but all that shit costs

08:36.480 --> 08:38.800
money, and I have a feeling they were never making any of it back.

08:38.800 --> 08:42.080
That's not to say that highly produced YouTube content can't work nowadays.

08:42.080 --> 08:43.560
Old school YouTube had a charm to it.

08:43.560 --> 08:47.440
The bedroom feminist stuff, the angry reviewer stuff, it was all single artists, sometimes

08:47.440 --> 08:49.840
with friends helping out like our old anime reviews.

08:49.840 --> 08:52.180
But it all felt amateur, in a welcoming way.

08:52.180 --> 08:55.040
When you see a potato camera with shitty audio, you know you're not getting somebody who

08:55.040 --> 08:56.100
was bought off.

08:56.100 --> 08:59.640
And maybe with the shift towards highly produced YouTube channels, we've lost something.

08:59.640 --> 09:03.520
At the same time, you can also absolutely tell when a highly produced video probably

09:03.520 --> 09:05.780
isn't highly produced because of corporate backing.

09:05.780 --> 09:10.220
We can use the overtly political channel examples like Crowder or Cedar, sure, but even guys

09:10.220 --> 09:14.220
like Redditor Media and Jontron still have that same feel, despite the massive increase

09:14.220 --> 09:15.220
in production value.

09:15.220 --> 09:20.500
A highly produced G4 style gaming channel is absolutely possible, desirable even, but

09:20.500 --> 09:25.140
not with the corrupting influence of Comcast money, and not with buying random E-celebs

09:25.140 --> 09:26.380
to be your hosts.

09:26.380 --> 09:30.340
Speaking of the E-celebs, apparently Comcast didn't even tell any of these poor fucks

09:30.340 --> 09:34.580
what was going on, as Gerard found out he lost his job because the tweet went viral.

09:34.580 --> 09:38.060
It's okay buddy, you've got a 1.5 million sub channel to fall back on, you'll be fine.

09:38.060 --> 09:41.380
You got that G Fuel sponsorship, the checkmark and pronouns money, Gerard's gonna be okay

09:41.380 --> 09:42.380
guys.

09:42.380 --> 09:44.640
There's another YouTuber I kind of regret watching back when I was younger.

09:45.060 --> 09:47.400
But there you have it, the final pathetic whimper of G4.

09:47.400 --> 09:50.420
The progressive skinsuit does not seem to take hold when YouTube's involved.

09:50.420 --> 09:52.660
They can subvert movies and comics no problem.

09:52.660 --> 09:54.280
Video games they can do but it's a little bit harder.

09:54.280 --> 09:57.620
But subverting a YouTuber, I don't know man, people just stop watching.

09:57.620 --> 10:01.860
Probably the most ironic bit is Frosk's Twitter comment of, I wish internet communities would

10:01.860 --> 10:05.760
recognize that their spaces have been infiltrated, manipulated, and hijacked by nefarious groups

10:05.760 --> 10:07.360
via meme propaganda.

10:07.360 --> 10:11.480
Just jokes bro, until hatred becomes normalized, then becomes radicalized, then becomes a hate

10:11.480 --> 10:12.480
crime.

10:12.520 --> 10:17.100
G8 was a great example about how language and a cause were hijacked by bad faith actors

10:17.100 --> 10:20.320
who wanted nothing to do with gaming communities until they recognized that they could weaponize

10:20.320 --> 10:21.900
the conflict for their own agenda.

10:21.900 --> 10:23.800
This is actually a fair criticism.

10:23.800 --> 10:27.900
Milo for example was no gamer, he didn't give a shit about us, he simply saw an opportunity

10:27.900 --> 10:29.580
to try and grow his career and he took it.

10:29.580 --> 10:33.320
But most importantly, right wing grifters don't really do this anymore.

10:33.320 --> 10:37.900
Who are the new right wing faces explicitly using gaming and gamers while not giving a

10:37.900 --> 10:39.180
shit about the community?

10:40.180 --> 10:44.040
But you can point to hundreds of left wing subversors doing the exact same thing and

10:44.040 --> 10:45.440
Frosk is just one of many.

10:45.440 --> 10:47.940
I can make the exact comment she did.

10:47.940 --> 10:51.400
Internet communities need to understand that their spaces have been infiltrated, manipulated,

10:51.400 --> 10:54.580
and hijacked by nefarious groups via diversity propaganda.

10:54.580 --> 10:58.240
Nobody actually believes the woke stuff until it's good that it's happening, subversion

10:58.240 --> 11:01.280
becomes normalized, people become radicalized, until it's a hate crime.

11:01.280 --> 11:05.880
And yes, there are actual documented instances of leftist hate crime against rightoids, something

11:05.880 --> 11:07.320
that I've also done a video on.

11:07.320 --> 11:10.620
It's fine if a video game has a political theme, lots of games do, leftist or rightist

11:10.620 --> 11:11.620
or whatever else.

11:11.620 --> 11:14.860
If you want to use your art to speak about politics or you want to have a political plot,

11:14.860 --> 11:15.940
then go for it.

11:15.940 --> 11:19.860
The issue ultimately is, is when only one type of politics is allowed, where the only

11:19.860 --> 11:24.660
possible objection to that must be strawmanned and where you're a bigot if you complain.

11:24.660 --> 11:27.860
It's the difference between Fallout New Vegas and Life is Strange.

11:27.860 --> 11:30.740
Anyway, G4 is dead and thank god for that.

11:30.740 --> 11:35.720
I do think the internet needs a G4-like show, but without the Frostkurins of the world subverting

11:35.720 --> 11:38.260
it with their politics, or the Comcast with their corporatocracy.

11:38.260 --> 11:39.700
Hell, I'll do it.

11:39.700 --> 11:43.020
Who wants to drop a couple hundred thousand dollars into my lap, with no promises that

11:43.020 --> 11:45.220
I'll do what you want or even be successful?

11:45.220 --> 11:46.720
Uh, anyone?

11:46.720 --> 11:49.700
I can promise that it'll at least be better than this.

11:49.700 --> 11:51.020
What the hell are you saying?

11:51.020 --> 11:54.020
I want to live Fiona Nova and Kevin Pereira.

11:54.020 --> 11:56.020
Oh, he got my name right.

11:56.020 --> 11:57.020
Wow.

11:57.020 --> 12:00.980
Oh, I want to live, I choose to rot in the sun rather than freeze in the darkness of

12:00.980 --> 12:01.980
the fridge.

12:01.980 --> 12:07.040
It's actually a really healthy attitude for a monster sandwich, if you think about it.

12:07.040 --> 12:11.200
I'm glad you conquered the existential crisis of birth in under, I mean, two minutes.

12:11.200 --> 12:12.200
Oh, thank you.

12:12.200 --> 12:17.520
How mutable are our cheeses and how strange is that clinging meat we have of love, even

12:17.520 --> 12:20.040
in the excess of what's, oh god, what's happening?

12:20.040 --> 12:23.040
Oh god, I can feel everything!

12:23.040 --> 12:27.040
Oh, every bite a thousand devils tongue!

12:27.040 --> 12:29.040
What an eternity of pain!

12:29.100 --> 12:32.100
No, is this what it is to be a sandwich?

12:32.100 --> 12:33.100
Oh gosh!

12:33.100 --> 12:34.100
Why's he taking me?

12:34.100 --> 12:38.100
Oh, he's eating my brain, but not the part I use for speech.

12:38.100 --> 12:39.100
Oh, there goes that part!

12:39.100 --> 12:44.860
Oh, I'm done getting eat and now brain little, but feel good dying dude, I'll furby sandwich

12:44.860 --> 12:45.620
a dead bye.
