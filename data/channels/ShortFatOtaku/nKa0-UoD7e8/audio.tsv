0	5680	The Roman Empire
5680	8560	How often do you think about the Roman Empire, fellas?
8560	10800	And ladies, the few ladies who watch this.
10800	14860	This question went viral last month, but it's actually way older than that.
14860	21320	On September 25, 2022 – yes, that's 2022, not 2023, this meme's actually over a year
21320	26900	old – a Swedish feminist TikToker by the name of Saskia Kort began dating men for the
26900	30140	first time after dating only exclusively women.
30140	35460	Saskia posted online in Swedish that men treated her poorly and therefore she wanted to understand
35460	36460	how men think.
36460	41740	So she asked this question on her Instagram, what do straight single men eat and think
41740	42740	about?
42740	47700	Two common answers she received were men think about nothing and men think about the Roman
47700	48820	Empire.
48820	53240	After making that reply public, a lot of other women chimed in, revealing that their boyfriends
53240	56560	and husbands actually think about the Roman Empire regularly.
56560	61180	Saskia's exchange with her followers went viral, but only in Swedish, appearing on TV
61180	64540	and magazines and in the news in Sweden last year.
64540	69080	It didn't break into the English-speaking world until August of 2023, when the Instagram
69080	74480	account Gaius Flavius posted a short video panning across some ancient ruins with the
74480	75480	caption,
75480	79120	Ladies, many of you do not realize how often men think about the Roman Empire.
79120	81280	Ask your husband, boyfriend, father, brother.
81280	82720	You will be surprised by their answers.
82720	86320	I don't know if Gaius took the idea from Saskia or if he just happened to come to the
86320	88240	same position by a different path.
88240	92440	Saskia certainly believes she's the trendsetter, though, and her TikTok account has a few videos
92440	96240	where she begs people to recognize her as the true origin of the meme, probably because
96240	98080	she wants to go viral along with it.
98080	101880	But more important than the failing Instagram career of a Swedish stick of butter is where
101880	103720	this question led next.
103720	107700	Women began to ask the men in their lives, how often do they think about the Roman Empire?
107700	110160	And they were genuinely shocked with the replies.
110160	111160	Take a look.
111160	114120	Have you seen the TikTok where the woman says, did you know that most men think of the Roman
114120	115740	Empire daily?
115740	118960	And she asked her husband and he says, yes, I do.
118960	119960	Now I know what you're thinking.
119960	125800	You're thinking, there is no way that my spouse thinks about the Roman Empire daily.
125800	131400	I asked my husband last night in jest, and do you know what this man said?
131400	139000	He said, well, in some capacity, probably every day, why?
139000	141720	How often do you think about the Roman Empire?
141720	144440	I'll be honest.
144440	145960	I'm serious.
145960	147360	No, stop.
147360	153640	How many times, like a week, or just how many times in general do you think about the Roman
153640	154640	Empire?
154640	159240	What about the Roman Empire?
159240	160880	Just anything about it.
160880	164880	Probably not a lot, why?
164880	165880	Not a lot?
165880	167880	When was the last time you thought about it?
167920	171920	Maybe a week or two ago?
171920	175080	The Roman Empire was a very big part in history.
175080	179920	How often do you think about the Roman Empire?
179920	181920	How often do I think about it?
181920	182920	Yeah.
182920	183920	I don't know.
183920	185920	I guess technically like every day.
185920	186920	What?
186920	190400	Apparently we're asking guys how often they think about the Roman Empire, and I texted
190400	192200	all of the guys that I could think of.
192200	194120	How often do you think about the Roman Empire?
194120	196040	In passing, about once a month.
196040	197540	How often do you think about the Roman Empire?
197540	200620	I love this, pretty often honestly, but I'm a history nerd.
200620	203540	Ooh, the Roman Empire, actually a lot.
203540	206620	My dad is a history teacher, so he said daily right now, but that makes sense.
206620	209340	Of course, my brother AJ comes in with, is this a TikTok?
209340	210340	And I said, yes.
210340	211660	I don't have to use your response, but I'm curious.
211660	213660	He said, probs weekly.
213660	216940	Why are people thinking about the Roman Empire so much?
216940	218820	Do you ever think about the Roman Empire?
218820	219820	All the time.
219820	220820	Why?
220820	221820	What are you thinking about it?
221820	225460	Well, because we're in those times right now.
225460	228100	He's preoccupied with sports, movies.
228100	229860	My husband doesn't think about the Roman Empire.
229860	233580	We've been married for 16 years, and he's never once brought up the Roman Empire to
233580	234580	me.
234580	235580	I said, just a quick question.
235580	236680	Do you ever think about the Roman Empire?
236680	242500	And he smirks, and without skipping a beat, he says, I mean, not more than like once a
242500	243500	week.
243500	244500	Why?
244500	246340	And I said, oh, you're playing with me right now, aren't you?
246340	247340	You saw the meme, didn't you?
247340	248900	He said, what meme are you talking about?
248900	251980	I said, the meme, the Roman Empire meme, the husband meme.
251980	254600	Are you playing with me right now, or do you really think about the Roman Empire more than
254600	255600	once a week?
255600	260880	He goes, well, not, not like that much more, like maybe once or twice, but not more than
260880	261880	that.
261880	262880	What?
262880	263880	Who are you?
263880	265800	What the, what?
265800	269600	What's interesting about this trend, and why I didn't just stuff one of these videos into
269600	273640	a TikTok Tuesday and call it a day, is that a lot of women are realizing that the men
273640	279720	around them spend idle time thinking about far reaching ideas that they tend not to consider.
279720	283200	That's not to say that women are just automatons sitting around with no internal monologue
283200	284200	whatsoever.
284200	286240	I think Schopenhauer might've believed that to be the case.
286240	290560	I would bet that your average woman also spends her idle time thinking about important things,
290560	291960	but different important things.
291960	293240	Let me explain.
293240	298080	I would say personally, Rome probably pops into my head on average once a day or so.
298080	299860	And there's a lot of different reasons for that.
299860	301700	A conversation about language.
301700	305800	Most European languages have a root in Latin or some Latin loan words or something.
305800	307740	A conversation about transportation.
307740	311840	Roman roads were so well built, some of them are still in use in Europe in the present
311840	312840	day.
312840	314120	Health and sanitation.
314120	315120	Invented the aqueduct.
315120	317720	And, again, some of those are also still in use.
317720	322420	Academia, Rome's inventions, its investigations of the natural world, its study of philosophy
322420	324800	were all unrivaled in the ancient era.
324800	325800	War?
325800	329840	Rome's history is full of warfare, with some of the earliest human examples of complex
329840	330840	tactics.
330840	335400	Its weapons and armor and even its siege devices, like catapults, are ubiquitous.
335400	336400	Politics?
336400	340680	Roman history, its progression from kingdom to republic to empire, has left a deep cultural
340680	345480	impact on Europe, to the point that the growth and decay of any given society is always compared
345480	346480	to the Roman cycle.
346480	351120	Rome's laws and political structures impacted the legal systems of Europe, the Middle East,
351120	353760	Africa, and its effects are still felt today.
353760	358120	Modern political systems appeal to the majesty of Rome and adopt Roman symbols of political
358120	359200	authority.
359200	364500	Rome was the first true civilizational empire, only rivaled by the Chinese dynasty.
364500	369120	Every other human empire falls short in comparison, though you can make a decent case for the
369120	372360	modern American empire, much of which it still owes to Rome.
372360	376400	In other words, men probably aren't just obsessing over Rome like some autismo.
376400	382040	Rather, it's that Rome did so much, lasted for so long, impacted so many other societies,
382040	385200	that most topics have some Roman influence within them.
385200	388640	Many men who talk about this topic report that one of the main reasons they think about
388640	392040	Rome is specifically in the context of its collapse.
392040	395720	Rome became decadent and weak, barbarians were at the gates, and the men of Rome could
395720	398760	no longer defend their civilization against incursions.
398760	403340	Rome's prosperity created civilization, it created leisure, but it also made its citizens
403340	405340	less capable of violence.
405340	409080	The barbarians, however, they knew no leisure, only hardship, and eventually the balance
409080	410320	of power shifted.
410320	414880	The strength of civilization eventually creates the weakness that undermines itself.
414880	418440	This is where that cyclical view of history comes in, the whole strong men create good
418440	419440	times thing.
419440	423600	It's no secret that with the economy the way it is, the overseas wars, problems with
423600	426920	migration, climate issues, lots of people believe that we're currently headed into
426920	427920	a collapse.
427920	431200	I'm not convinced that we are, frankly, but lots of people certainly feel that way, and
431200	435020	I think the parallels between the perception of our current situation and Rome's decline
435020	437720	is causing a lot of men to dwell on history.
437720	441240	Distracting the disaffected poor is with cheap entertainment, the bread and circuses period
441240	445920	of Rome has always been an effective short-term strategy used by the elites to prevent a revolution,
445920	448440	but it almost always eventually stops working.
448440	452220	And there is this sense at this point that we're all just waiting.
452220	456820	Another reason men tend to think of Rome is due to the barbarian part of that conversation.
456820	461300	Men know, deep down, that should their country ever be at serious risk, it will be them who
461300	462940	will be called upon to fight.
462940	466940	If there actually are barbarians at the gates, the question becomes, what will men do about
466940	467940	it?
467940	471340	Yes, I know that there have been some rare, competent female fighters throughout history,
471340	475180	and technology is certainly equalizing the playing field with female drone pilots and
475180	479760	shit like that, but we all know that it's historically overwhelmingly been men doing
479760	483060	the defending, and it will remain that way for the foreseeable future.
483060	485460	Take the Rome variable out of the conversation for a minute.
485660	489180	There's a few Reddit threads out there, and some of those automated Microsoft Sam Reddit
489180	493660	reader videos, where the question is women asking men what they're idly thinking about
493660	495060	when they space out.
495060	499760	And overwhelmingly, men give an answer that revolves around some type of violence.
499760	503180	What would they do if a gunman suddenly burst into the restaurant that they're at?
503180	504180	Where's the emergency exit?
504180	505180	Where can they take cover?
505180	506500	Is there any way to fight back?
506500	508180	What happens if a fight breaks out at the bar?
508180	509180	Could they take that guy?
509180	510420	Who's got their back right now?
510420	514080	What if a bear or a tiger or some other dangerous animal was suddenly in their front lawn?
514080	515220	How do they get the family out?
515980	518220	A lot of male daydreaming revolves around violence.
518220	522460	Not sadistic violence against the victim, but defensive violence during a possible emergency
522460	524300	to help those around them.
524300	528100	This even extends to less violent scenarios that are still dangerous and require decisive
528100	529100	action.
529100	531620	What could they do if they drove by a car accident or a house fire?
531620	535740	Men commonly report that they're overwhelmingly just waiting around hoping to save the day
535740	538660	somehow, even if that means hurting themselves in the process.
538660	542820	Framing this conversation in terms of Rome is falling, there's barbarians at the gates,
542820	546460	what can we do to fix the situation, is a pretty funny meme, but it goes deeper than
546460	547460	Rome.
547460	551620	Most men feel the desire to be useful to those around them, and they tend to self-destruct
551620	552780	when they can't be.
552780	556900	More than anything else, this is the greatest risk that automation poses, by the way.
556900	561200	It's also the main reason that men tend to reject socialism or welfare capitalism more
561200	562200	than women do.
562200	565440	For the average guy, there seems to be an innate desire to be the type of person who
565440	569340	invests more into a system than they withdraw from it, at the final count.
569340	572500	Women know this and take advantage of it, and that's not inherently negative.
572500	575160	It's not all just e-thoughts draining the wallets of simps.
575160	579220	Men are happy to serve the women they're devoted to, they just want devotion back.
579220	583900	Funny enough, this whole thing spawned a submeme called My Roman Empire, where women describe
583900	587180	the things that they think about as much as men think about the Roman Empire.
587180	591300	Most women mention movies, or pop stars, or celebrity shit, though one of them does say
591300	594020	that her Roman Empire is eating the rich.
594020	595320	What's My Roman Empire?
595320	596700	So glad you asked, let me tell you.
596700	600900	It is eating rich, and I don't just mean any rich person.
600900	603520	I mean the uber wealthy.
603520	604660	The top 1%.
604660	610660	In general, women tend to outline less civilizational, more localist daily life concerns as their
610660	611660	Roman Empire.
611660	615900	And when they do think about those larger concerns, they do so from a position of desiring
615900	617360	more equality.
617360	619840	Like I said at the start of the video, that doesn't automatically make those things
619840	622260	lesser or bad or something.
622260	625700	We all know that equality is a destructive force, ultimately, because it makes the best
625700	627320	people on par with the worst.
627320	630480	But we also know that a society with too much inequality tends to collapse.
630480	634080	And in a more general sense, we all know that it's the little things that make life worth
634080	635080	living.
635080	638040	It's those local, daily life concerns that are the most enjoyable.
638040	641640	I think this is just another data point in a long series of data points showing that
641640	646400	men and women are different and complementary, and that both are necessary, that they both
646400	647780	make things better.
647780	651680	All of those smaller order concerns, the ones that women tend to focus on, those are the
651680	654320	things that make manning the walls worthwhile.
654320	658120	Men know that they need to maintain their society, but women know why it needs to be
658120	659120	maintained.
659120	661200	Though at the end of the day, maybe it's just because we all want to get dominated
661200	662200	by Goths.
662200	663200	Who knows?
663200	669200	Just out of curiosity, how often do you think about the Roman Empire?
669200	671720	Not that often.
671720	672720	Why?
672720	673720	Give me a rate.
673720	678720	I mean, I used to think about it a lot more in high school than I do currently.
678720	679720	Why?
679720	683720	Because I was taking history classes in high school.
684120	687120	Let's say one or two times a month.
687120	688120	Okay.
688120	689120	Oh.
694120	696120	Are you expecting that answer?
696120	697120	No!
697120	698120	Why?
698120	704120	I was, I was kind of expecting never, because that's the answer that most women give.
704120	708120	I was not expecting, I guess, you know what, you giving the middle of the road answer sounds
708120	709120	about right.
709120	710120	Yeah.
710120	712120	And sexual friendly.
712520	713520	Oh my God.
717520	720520	So Naomi wanted to point out that she's not actually trans, right?
720520	721520	I'm not.
721520	722520	You just did it.
722520	723520	Except for the memes.
