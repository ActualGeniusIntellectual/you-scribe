00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,680
The Roman Empire

2
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:08,560
How often do you think about the Roman Empire, fellas?

3
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:10,800
And ladies, the few ladies who watch this.

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:14,860
This question went viral last month, but it's actually way older than that.

5
00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:21,320
On September 25, 2022 â€“ yes, that's 2022, not 2023, this meme's actually over a year

6
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:26,900
old â€“ a Swedish feminist TikToker by the name of Saskia Kort began dating men for the

7
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:30,140
first time after dating only exclusively women.

8
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:35,460
Saskia posted online in Swedish that men treated her poorly and therefore she wanted to understand

9
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:36,460
how men think.

10
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:41,740
So she asked this question on her Instagram, what do straight single men eat and think

11
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:42,740
about?

12
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:47,700
Two common answers she received were men think about nothing and men think about the Roman

13
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:48,820
Empire.

14
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:53,240
After making that reply public, a lot of other women chimed in, revealing that their boyfriends

15
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:56,560
and husbands actually think about the Roman Empire regularly.

16
00:00:56,560 --> 00:01:01,180
Saskia's exchange with her followers went viral, but only in Swedish, appearing on TV

17
00:01:01,180 --> 00:01:04,540
and magazines and in the news in Sweden last year.

18
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:09,080
It didn't break into the English-speaking world until August of 2023, when the Instagram

19
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:14,480
account Gaius Flavius posted a short video panning across some ancient ruins with the

20
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:15,480
caption,

21
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:19,120
Ladies, many of you do not realize how often men think about the Roman Empire.

22
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:21,280
Ask your husband, boyfriend, father, brother.

23
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:22,720
You will be surprised by their answers.

24
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:26,320
I don't know if Gaius took the idea from Saskia or if he just happened to come to the

25
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:28,240
same position by a different path.

26
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:32,440
Saskia certainly believes she's the trendsetter, though, and her TikTok account has a few videos

27
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:36,240
where she begs people to recognize her as the true origin of the meme, probably because

28
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,080
she wants to go viral along with it.

29
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:41,880
But more important than the failing Instagram career of a Swedish stick of butter is where

30
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:43,720
this question led next.

31
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:47,700
Women began to ask the men in their lives, how often do they think about the Roman Empire?

32
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:50,160
And they were genuinely shocked with the replies.

33
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:51,160
Take a look.

34
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:54,120
Have you seen the TikTok where the woman says, did you know that most men think of the Roman

35
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,740
Empire daily?

36
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:58,960
And she asked her husband and he says, yes, I do.

37
00:01:58,960 --> 00:01:59,960
Now I know what you're thinking.

38
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:05,800
You're thinking, there is no way that my spouse thinks about the Roman Empire daily.

39
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:11,400
I asked my husband last night in jest, and do you know what this man said?

40
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:19,000
He said, well, in some capacity, probably every day, why?

41
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,720
How often do you think about the Roman Empire?

42
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:24,440
I'll be honest.

43
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:25,960
I'm serious.

44
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:27,360
No, stop.

45
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:33,640
How many times, like a week, or just how many times in general do you think about the Roman

46
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:34,640
Empire?

47
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:39,240
What about the Roman Empire?

48
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,880
Just anything about it.

49
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:44,880
Probably not a lot, why?

50
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:45,880
Not a lot?

51
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:47,880
When was the last time you thought about it?

52
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:51,920
Maybe a week or two ago?

53
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:55,080
The Roman Empire was a very big part in history.

54
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:59,920
How often do you think about the Roman Empire?

55
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,920
How often do I think about it?

56
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:02,920
Yeah.

57
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:03,920
I don't know.

58
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,920
I guess technically like every day.

59
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:06,920
What?

60
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:10,400
Apparently we're asking guys how often they think about the Roman Empire, and I texted

61
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,200
all of the guys that I could think of.

62
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:14,120
How often do you think about the Roman Empire?

63
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:16,040
In passing, about once a month.

64
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:17,540
How often do you think about the Roman Empire?

65
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:20,620
I love this, pretty often honestly, but I'm a history nerd.

66
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:23,540
Ooh, the Roman Empire, actually a lot.

67
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:26,620
My dad is a history teacher, so he said daily right now, but that makes sense.

68
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:29,340
Of course, my brother AJ comes in with, is this a TikTok?

69
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:30,340
And I said, yes.

70
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:31,660
I don't have to use your response, but I'm curious.

71
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:33,660
He said, probs weekly.

72
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:36,940
Why are people thinking about the Roman Empire so much?

73
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:38,820
Do you ever think about the Roman Empire?

74
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:39,820
All the time.

75
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:40,820
Why?

76
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:41,820
What are you thinking about it?

77
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:45,460
Well, because we're in those times right now.

78
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:48,100
He's preoccupied with sports, movies.

79
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:49,860
My husband doesn't think about the Roman Empire.

80
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:53,580
We've been married for 16 years, and he's never once brought up the Roman Empire to

81
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:54,580
me.

82
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:55,580
I said, just a quick question.

83
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:56,680
Do you ever think about the Roman Empire?

84
00:03:56,680 --> 00:04:02,500
And he smirks, and without skipping a beat, he says, I mean, not more than like once a

85
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:03,500
week.

86
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:04,500
Why?

87
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:06,340
And I said, oh, you're playing with me right now, aren't you?

88
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:07,340
You saw the meme, didn't you?

89
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:08,900
He said, what meme are you talking about?

90
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:11,980
I said, the meme, the Roman Empire meme, the husband meme.

91
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:14,600
Are you playing with me right now, or do you really think about the Roman Empire more than

92
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:15,600
once a week?

93
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:20,880
He goes, well, not, not like that much more, like maybe once or twice, but not more than

94
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:21,880
that.

95
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:22,880
What?

96
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:23,880
Who are you?

97
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,800
What the, what?

98
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:29,600
What's interesting about this trend, and why I didn't just stuff one of these videos into

99
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:33,640
a TikTok Tuesday and call it a day, is that a lot of women are realizing that the men

100
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:39,720
around them spend idle time thinking about far reaching ideas that they tend not to consider.

101
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:43,200
That's not to say that women are just automatons sitting around with no internal monologue

102
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,200
whatsoever.

103
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,240
I think Schopenhauer might've believed that to be the case.

104
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:50,560
I would bet that your average woman also spends her idle time thinking about important things,

105
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:51,960
but different important things.

106
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:53,240
Let me explain.

107
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:58,080
I would say personally, Rome probably pops into my head on average once a day or so.

108
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,860
And there's a lot of different reasons for that.

109
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:01,700
A conversation about language.

110
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:05,800
Most European languages have a root in Latin or some Latin loan words or something.

111
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,740
A conversation about transportation.

112
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:11,840
Roman roads were so well built, some of them are still in use in Europe in the present

113
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:12,840
day.

114
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:14,120
Health and sanitation.

115
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,120
Invented the aqueduct.

116
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,720
And, again, some of those are also still in use.

117
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:22,420
Academia, Rome's inventions, its investigations of the natural world, its study of philosophy

118
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:24,800
were all unrivaled in the ancient era.

119
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:25,800
War?

120
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:29,840
Rome's history is full of warfare, with some of the earliest human examples of complex

121
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:30,840
tactics.

122
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:35,400
Its weapons and armor and even its siege devices, like catapults, are ubiquitous.

123
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:36,400
Politics?

124
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:40,680
Roman history, its progression from kingdom to republic to empire, has left a deep cultural

125
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:45,480
impact on Europe, to the point that the growth and decay of any given society is always compared

126
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:46,480
to the Roman cycle.

127
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:51,120
Rome's laws and political structures impacted the legal systems of Europe, the Middle East,

128
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,760
Africa, and its effects are still felt today.

129
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:58,120
Modern political systems appeal to the majesty of Rome and adopt Roman symbols of political

130
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,200
authority.

131
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:04,500
Rome was the first true civilizational empire, only rivaled by the Chinese dynasty.

132
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:09,120
Every other human empire falls short in comparison, though you can make a decent case for the

133
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:12,360
modern American empire, much of which it still owes to Rome.

134
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:16,400
In other words, men probably aren't just obsessing over Rome like some autismo.

135
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:22,040
Rather, it's that Rome did so much, lasted for so long, impacted so many other societies,

136
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:25,200
that most topics have some Roman influence within them.

137
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:28,640
Many men who talk about this topic report that one of the main reasons they think about

138
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:32,040
Rome is specifically in the context of its collapse.

139
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:35,720
Rome became decadent and weak, barbarians were at the gates, and the men of Rome could

140
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:38,760
no longer defend their civilization against incursions.

141
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:43,340
Rome's prosperity created civilization, it created leisure, but it also made its citizens

142
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:45,340
less capable of violence.

143
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:49,080
The barbarians, however, they knew no leisure, only hardship, and eventually the balance

144
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:50,320
of power shifted.

145
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:54,880
The strength of civilization eventually creates the weakness that undermines itself.

146
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:58,440
This is where that cyclical view of history comes in, the whole strong men create good

147
00:06:58,440 --> 00:06:59,440
times thing.

148
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:03,600
It's no secret that with the economy the way it is, the overseas wars, problems with

149
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:06,920
migration, climate issues, lots of people believe that we're currently headed into

150
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:07,920
a collapse.

151
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:11,200
I'm not convinced that we are, frankly, but lots of people certainly feel that way, and

152
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:15,020
I think the parallels between the perception of our current situation and Rome's decline

153
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:17,720
is causing a lot of men to dwell on history.

154
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:21,240
Distracting the disaffected poor is with cheap entertainment, the bread and circuses period

155
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:25,920
of Rome has always been an effective short-term strategy used by the elites to prevent a revolution,

156
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:28,440
but it almost always eventually stops working.

157
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:32,220
And there is this sense at this point that we're all just waiting.

158
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:36,820
Another reason men tend to think of Rome is due to the barbarian part of that conversation.

159
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:41,300
Men know, deep down, that should their country ever be at serious risk, it will be them who

160
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:42,940
will be called upon to fight.

161
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:46,940
If there actually are barbarians at the gates, the question becomes, what will men do about

162
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:47,940
it?

163
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:51,340
Yes, I know that there have been some rare, competent female fighters throughout history,

164
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:55,180
and technology is certainly equalizing the playing field with female drone pilots and

165
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:59,760
shit like that, but we all know that it's historically overwhelmingly been men doing

166
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:03,060
the defending, and it will remain that way for the foreseeable future.

167
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:05,460
Take the Rome variable out of the conversation for a minute.

168
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:09,180
There's a few Reddit threads out there, and some of those automated Microsoft Sam Reddit

169
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:13,660
reader videos, where the question is women asking men what they're idly thinking about

170
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:15,060
when they space out.

171
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:19,760
And overwhelmingly, men give an answer that revolves around some type of violence.

172
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:23,180
What would they do if a gunman suddenly burst into the restaurant that they're at?

173
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:24,180
Where's the emergency exit?

174
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:25,180
Where can they take cover?

175
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:26,500
Is there any way to fight back?

176
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:28,180
What happens if a fight breaks out at the bar?

177
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:29,180
Could they take that guy?

178
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:30,420
Who's got their back right now?

179
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:34,080
What if a bear or a tiger or some other dangerous animal was suddenly in their front lawn?

180
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,220
How do they get the family out?

181
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:38,220
A lot of male daydreaming revolves around violence.

182
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:42,460
Not sadistic violence against the victim, but defensive violence during a possible emergency

183
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:44,300
to help those around them.

184
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:48,100
This even extends to less violent scenarios that are still dangerous and require decisive

185
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:49,100
action.

186
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:51,620
What could they do if they drove by a car accident or a house fire?

187
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:55,740
Men commonly report that they're overwhelmingly just waiting around hoping to save the day

188
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:58,660
somehow, even if that means hurting themselves in the process.

189
00:08:58,660 --> 00:09:02,820
Framing this conversation in terms of Rome is falling, there's barbarians at the gates,

190
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:06,460
what can we do to fix the situation, is a pretty funny meme, but it goes deeper than

191
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:07,460
Rome.

192
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:11,620
Most men feel the desire to be useful to those around them, and they tend to self-destruct

193
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:12,780
when they can't be.

194
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:16,900
More than anything else, this is the greatest risk that automation poses, by the way.

195
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:21,200
It's also the main reason that men tend to reject socialism or welfare capitalism more

196
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,200
than women do.

197
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:25,440
For the average guy, there seems to be an innate desire to be the type of person who

198
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:29,340
invests more into a system than they withdraw from it, at the final count.

199
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:32,500
Women know this and take advantage of it, and that's not inherently negative.

200
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:35,160
It's not all just e-thoughts draining the wallets of simps.

201
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:39,220
Men are happy to serve the women they're devoted to, they just want devotion back.

202
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:43,900
Funny enough, this whole thing spawned a submeme called My Roman Empire, where women describe

203
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:47,180
the things that they think about as much as men think about the Roman Empire.

204
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:51,300
Most women mention movies, or pop stars, or celebrity shit, though one of them does say

205
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:54,020
that her Roman Empire is eating the rich.

206
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:55,320
What's My Roman Empire?

207
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,700
So glad you asked, let me tell you.

208
00:09:56,700 --> 00:10:00,900
It is eating rich, and I don't just mean any rich person.

209
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:03,520
I mean the uber wealthy.

210
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:04,660
The top 1%.

211
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:10,660
In general, women tend to outline less civilizational, more localist daily life concerns as their

212
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:11,660
Roman Empire.

213
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:15,900
And when they do think about those larger concerns, they do so from a position of desiring

214
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:17,360
more equality.

215
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:19,840
Like I said at the start of the video, that doesn't automatically make those things

216
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:22,260
lesser or bad or something.

217
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:25,700
We all know that equality is a destructive force, ultimately, because it makes the best

218
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:27,320
people on par with the worst.

219
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:30,480
But we also know that a society with too much inequality tends to collapse.

220
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:34,080
And in a more general sense, we all know that it's the little things that make life worth

221
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,080
living.

222
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:38,040
It's those local, daily life concerns that are the most enjoyable.

223
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:41,640
I think this is just another data point in a long series of data points showing that

224
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:46,400
men and women are different and complementary, and that both are necessary, that they both

225
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,780
make things better.

226
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:51,680
All of those smaller order concerns, the ones that women tend to focus on, those are the

227
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:54,320
things that make manning the walls worthwhile.

228
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:58,120
Men know that they need to maintain their society, but women know why it needs to be

229
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:59,120
maintained.

230
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:01,200
Though at the end of the day, maybe it's just because we all want to get dominated

231
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,200
by Goths.

232
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,200
Who knows?

233
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:09,200
Just out of curiosity, how often do you think about the Roman Empire?

234
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,720
Not that often.

235
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:12,720
Why?

236
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:13,720
Give me a rate.

237
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:18,720
I mean, I used to think about it a lot more in high school than I do currently.

238
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:19,720
Why?

239
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:23,720
Because I was taking history classes in high school.

240
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:27,120
Let's say one or two times a month.

241
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,120
Okay.

242
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,120
Oh.

243
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:36,120
Are you expecting that answer?

244
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:37,120
No!

245
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,120
Why?

246
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:44,120
I was, I was kind of expecting never, because that's the answer that most women give.

247
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:48,120
I was not expecting, I guess, you know what, you giving the middle of the road answer sounds

248
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:49,120
about right.

249
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,120
Yeah.

250
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:52,120
And sexual friendly.

251
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:53,520
Oh my God.

252
00:11:57,520 --> 00:12:00,520
So Naomi wanted to point out that she's not actually trans, right?

253
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:01,520
I'm not.

254
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:02,520
You just did it.

255
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:03,520
Except for the memes.
