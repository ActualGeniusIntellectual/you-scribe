00:00.000 --> 00:05.680
The Roman Empire

00:05.680 --> 00:08.560
How often do you think about the Roman Empire, fellas?

00:08.560 --> 00:10.800
And ladies, the few ladies who watch this.

00:10.800 --> 00:14.860
This question went viral last month, but it's actually way older than that.

00:14.860 --> 00:21.320
On September 25, 2022 â€“ yes, that's 2022, not 2023, this meme's actually over a year

00:21.320 --> 00:26.900
old â€“ a Swedish feminist TikToker by the name of Saskia Kort began dating men for the

00:26.900 --> 00:30.140
first time after dating only exclusively women.

00:30.140 --> 00:35.460
Saskia posted online in Swedish that men treated her poorly and therefore she wanted to understand

00:35.460 --> 00:36.460
how men think.

00:36.460 --> 00:41.740
So she asked this question on her Instagram, what do straight single men eat and think

00:41.740 --> 00:42.740
about?

00:42.740 --> 00:47.700
Two common answers she received were men think about nothing and men think about the Roman

00:47.700 --> 00:48.820
Empire.

00:48.820 --> 00:53.240
After making that reply public, a lot of other women chimed in, revealing that their boyfriends

00:53.240 --> 00:56.560
and husbands actually think about the Roman Empire regularly.

00:56.560 --> 01:01.180
Saskia's exchange with her followers went viral, but only in Swedish, appearing on TV

01:01.180 --> 01:04.540
and magazines and in the news in Sweden last year.

01:04.540 --> 01:09.080
It didn't break into the English-speaking world until August of 2023, when the Instagram

01:09.080 --> 01:14.480
account Gaius Flavius posted a short video panning across some ancient ruins with the

01:14.480 --> 01:15.480
caption,

01:15.480 --> 01:19.120
Ladies, many of you do not realize how often men think about the Roman Empire.

01:19.120 --> 01:21.280
Ask your husband, boyfriend, father, brother.

01:21.280 --> 01:22.720
You will be surprised by their answers.

01:22.720 --> 01:26.320
I don't know if Gaius took the idea from Saskia or if he just happened to come to the

01:26.320 --> 01:28.240
same position by a different path.

01:28.240 --> 01:32.440
Saskia certainly believes she's the trendsetter, though, and her TikTok account has a few videos

01:32.440 --> 01:36.240
where she begs people to recognize her as the true origin of the meme, probably because

01:36.240 --> 01:38.080
she wants to go viral along with it.

01:38.080 --> 01:41.880
But more important than the failing Instagram career of a Swedish stick of butter is where

01:41.880 --> 01:43.720
this question led next.

01:43.720 --> 01:47.700
Women began to ask the men in their lives, how often do they think about the Roman Empire?

01:47.700 --> 01:50.160
And they were genuinely shocked with the replies.

01:50.160 --> 01:51.160
Take a look.

01:51.160 --> 01:54.120
Have you seen the TikTok where the woman says, did you know that most men think of the Roman

01:54.120 --> 01:55.740
Empire daily?

01:55.740 --> 01:58.960
And she asked her husband and he says, yes, I do.

01:58.960 --> 01:59.960
Now I know what you're thinking.

01:59.960 --> 02:05.800
You're thinking, there is no way that my spouse thinks about the Roman Empire daily.

02:05.800 --> 02:11.400
I asked my husband last night in jest, and do you know what this man said?

02:11.400 --> 02:19.000
He said, well, in some capacity, probably every day, why?

02:19.000 --> 02:21.720
How often do you think about the Roman Empire?

02:21.720 --> 02:24.440
I'll be honest.

02:24.440 --> 02:25.960
I'm serious.

02:25.960 --> 02:27.360
No, stop.

02:27.360 --> 02:33.640
How many times, like a week, or just how many times in general do you think about the Roman

02:33.640 --> 02:34.640
Empire?

02:34.640 --> 02:39.240
What about the Roman Empire?

02:39.240 --> 02:40.880
Just anything about it.

02:40.880 --> 02:44.880
Probably not a lot, why?

02:44.880 --> 02:45.880
Not a lot?

02:45.880 --> 02:47.880
When was the last time you thought about it?

02:47.920 --> 02:51.920
Maybe a week or two ago?

02:51.920 --> 02:55.080
The Roman Empire was a very big part in history.

02:55.080 --> 02:59.920
How often do you think about the Roman Empire?

02:59.920 --> 03:01.920
How often do I think about it?

03:01.920 --> 03:02.920
Yeah.

03:02.920 --> 03:03.920
I don't know.

03:03.920 --> 03:05.920
I guess technically like every day.

03:05.920 --> 03:06.920
What?

03:06.920 --> 03:10.400
Apparently we're asking guys how often they think about the Roman Empire, and I texted

03:10.400 --> 03:12.200
all of the guys that I could think of.

03:12.200 --> 03:14.120
How often do you think about the Roman Empire?

03:14.120 --> 03:16.040
In passing, about once a month.

03:16.040 --> 03:17.540
How often do you think about the Roman Empire?

03:17.540 --> 03:20.620
I love this, pretty often honestly, but I'm a history nerd.

03:20.620 --> 03:23.540
Ooh, the Roman Empire, actually a lot.

03:23.540 --> 03:26.620
My dad is a history teacher, so he said daily right now, but that makes sense.

03:26.620 --> 03:29.340
Of course, my brother AJ comes in with, is this a TikTok?

03:29.340 --> 03:30.340
And I said, yes.

03:30.340 --> 03:31.660
I don't have to use your response, but I'm curious.

03:31.660 --> 03:33.660
He said, probs weekly.

03:33.660 --> 03:36.940
Why are people thinking about the Roman Empire so much?

03:36.940 --> 03:38.820
Do you ever think about the Roman Empire?

03:38.820 --> 03:39.820
All the time.

03:39.820 --> 03:40.820
Why?

03:40.820 --> 03:41.820
What are you thinking about it?

03:41.820 --> 03:45.460
Well, because we're in those times right now.

03:45.460 --> 03:48.100
He's preoccupied with sports, movies.

03:48.100 --> 03:49.860
My husband doesn't think about the Roman Empire.

03:49.860 --> 03:53.580
We've been married for 16 years, and he's never once brought up the Roman Empire to

03:53.580 --> 03:54.580
me.

03:54.580 --> 03:55.580
I said, just a quick question.

03:55.580 --> 03:56.680
Do you ever think about the Roman Empire?

03:56.680 --> 04:02.500
And he smirks, and without skipping a beat, he says, I mean, not more than like once a

04:02.500 --> 04:03.500
week.

04:03.500 --> 04:04.500
Why?

04:04.500 --> 04:06.340
And I said, oh, you're playing with me right now, aren't you?

04:06.340 --> 04:07.340
You saw the meme, didn't you?

04:07.340 --> 04:08.900
He said, what meme are you talking about?

04:08.900 --> 04:11.980
I said, the meme, the Roman Empire meme, the husband meme.

04:11.980 --> 04:14.600
Are you playing with me right now, or do you really think about the Roman Empire more than

04:14.600 --> 04:15.600
once a week?

04:15.600 --> 04:20.880
He goes, well, not, not like that much more, like maybe once or twice, but not more than

04:20.880 --> 04:21.880
that.

04:21.880 --> 04:22.880
What?

04:22.880 --> 04:23.880
Who are you?

04:23.880 --> 04:25.800
What the, what?

04:25.800 --> 04:29.600
What's interesting about this trend, and why I didn't just stuff one of these videos into

04:29.600 --> 04:33.640
a TikTok Tuesday and call it a day, is that a lot of women are realizing that the men

04:33.640 --> 04:39.720
around them spend idle time thinking about far reaching ideas that they tend not to consider.

04:39.720 --> 04:43.200
That's not to say that women are just automatons sitting around with no internal monologue

04:43.200 --> 04:44.200
whatsoever.

04:44.200 --> 04:46.240
I think Schopenhauer might've believed that to be the case.

04:46.240 --> 04:50.560
I would bet that your average woman also spends her idle time thinking about important things,

04:50.560 --> 04:51.960
but different important things.

04:51.960 --> 04:53.240
Let me explain.

04:53.240 --> 04:58.080
I would say personally, Rome probably pops into my head on average once a day or so.

04:58.080 --> 04:59.860
And there's a lot of different reasons for that.

04:59.860 --> 05:01.700
A conversation about language.

05:01.700 --> 05:05.800
Most European languages have a root in Latin or some Latin loan words or something.

05:05.800 --> 05:07.740
A conversation about transportation.

05:07.740 --> 05:11.840
Roman roads were so well built, some of them are still in use in Europe in the present

05:11.840 --> 05:12.840
day.

05:12.840 --> 05:14.120
Health and sanitation.

05:14.120 --> 05:15.120
Invented the aqueduct.

05:15.120 --> 05:17.720
And, again, some of those are also still in use.

05:17.720 --> 05:22.420
Academia, Rome's inventions, its investigations of the natural world, its study of philosophy

05:22.420 --> 05:24.800
were all unrivaled in the ancient era.

05:24.800 --> 05:25.800
War?

05:25.800 --> 05:29.840
Rome's history is full of warfare, with some of the earliest human examples of complex

05:29.840 --> 05:30.840
tactics.

05:30.840 --> 05:35.400
Its weapons and armor and even its siege devices, like catapults, are ubiquitous.

05:35.400 --> 05:36.400
Politics?

05:36.400 --> 05:40.680
Roman history, its progression from kingdom to republic to empire, has left a deep cultural

05:40.680 --> 05:45.480
impact on Europe, to the point that the growth and decay of any given society is always compared

05:45.480 --> 05:46.480
to the Roman cycle.

05:46.480 --> 05:51.120
Rome's laws and political structures impacted the legal systems of Europe, the Middle East,

05:51.120 --> 05:53.760
Africa, and its effects are still felt today.

05:53.760 --> 05:58.120
Modern political systems appeal to the majesty of Rome and adopt Roman symbols of political

05:58.120 --> 05:59.200
authority.

05:59.200 --> 06:04.500
Rome was the first true civilizational empire, only rivaled by the Chinese dynasty.

06:04.500 --> 06:09.120
Every other human empire falls short in comparison, though you can make a decent case for the

06:09.120 --> 06:12.360
modern American empire, much of which it still owes to Rome.

06:12.360 --> 06:16.400
In other words, men probably aren't just obsessing over Rome like some autismo.

06:16.400 --> 06:22.040
Rather, it's that Rome did so much, lasted for so long, impacted so many other societies,

06:22.040 --> 06:25.200
that most topics have some Roman influence within them.

06:25.200 --> 06:28.640
Many men who talk about this topic report that one of the main reasons they think about

06:28.640 --> 06:32.040
Rome is specifically in the context of its collapse.

06:32.040 --> 06:35.720
Rome became decadent and weak, barbarians were at the gates, and the men of Rome could

06:35.720 --> 06:38.760
no longer defend their civilization against incursions.

06:38.760 --> 06:43.340
Rome's prosperity created civilization, it created leisure, but it also made its citizens

06:43.340 --> 06:45.340
less capable of violence.

06:45.340 --> 06:49.080
The barbarians, however, they knew no leisure, only hardship, and eventually the balance

06:49.080 --> 06:50.320
of power shifted.

06:50.320 --> 06:54.880
The strength of civilization eventually creates the weakness that undermines itself.

06:54.880 --> 06:58.440
This is where that cyclical view of history comes in, the whole strong men create good

06:58.440 --> 06:59.440
times thing.

06:59.440 --> 07:03.600
It's no secret that with the economy the way it is, the overseas wars, problems with

07:03.600 --> 07:06.920
migration, climate issues, lots of people believe that we're currently headed into

07:06.920 --> 07:07.920
a collapse.

07:07.920 --> 07:11.200
I'm not convinced that we are, frankly, but lots of people certainly feel that way, and

07:11.200 --> 07:15.020
I think the parallels between the perception of our current situation and Rome's decline

07:15.020 --> 07:17.720
is causing a lot of men to dwell on history.

07:17.720 --> 07:21.240
Distracting the disaffected poor is with cheap entertainment, the bread and circuses period

07:21.240 --> 07:25.920
of Rome has always been an effective short-term strategy used by the elites to prevent a revolution,

07:25.920 --> 07:28.440
but it almost always eventually stops working.

07:28.440 --> 07:32.220
And there is this sense at this point that we're all just waiting.

07:32.220 --> 07:36.820
Another reason men tend to think of Rome is due to the barbarian part of that conversation.

07:36.820 --> 07:41.300
Men know, deep down, that should their country ever be at serious risk, it will be them who

07:41.300 --> 07:42.940
will be called upon to fight.

07:42.940 --> 07:46.940
If there actually are barbarians at the gates, the question becomes, what will men do about

07:46.940 --> 07:47.940
it?

07:47.940 --> 07:51.340
Yes, I know that there have been some rare, competent female fighters throughout history,

07:51.340 --> 07:55.180
and technology is certainly equalizing the playing field with female drone pilots and

07:55.180 --> 07:59.760
shit like that, but we all know that it's historically overwhelmingly been men doing

07:59.760 --> 08:03.060
the defending, and it will remain that way for the foreseeable future.

08:03.060 --> 08:05.460
Take the Rome variable out of the conversation for a minute.

08:05.660 --> 08:09.180
There's a few Reddit threads out there, and some of those automated Microsoft Sam Reddit

08:09.180 --> 08:13.660
reader videos, where the question is women asking men what they're idly thinking about

08:13.660 --> 08:15.060
when they space out.

08:15.060 --> 08:19.760
And overwhelmingly, men give an answer that revolves around some type of violence.

08:19.760 --> 08:23.180
What would they do if a gunman suddenly burst into the restaurant that they're at?

08:23.180 --> 08:24.180
Where's the emergency exit?

08:24.180 --> 08:25.180
Where can they take cover?

08:25.180 --> 08:26.500
Is there any way to fight back?

08:26.500 --> 08:28.180
What happens if a fight breaks out at the bar?

08:28.180 --> 08:29.180
Could they take that guy?

08:29.180 --> 08:30.420
Who's got their back right now?

08:30.420 --> 08:34.080
What if a bear or a tiger or some other dangerous animal was suddenly in their front lawn?

08:34.080 --> 08:35.220
How do they get the family out?

08:35.980 --> 08:38.220
A lot of male daydreaming revolves around violence.

08:38.220 --> 08:42.460
Not sadistic violence against the victim, but defensive violence during a possible emergency

08:42.460 --> 08:44.300
to help those around them.

08:44.300 --> 08:48.100
This even extends to less violent scenarios that are still dangerous and require decisive

08:48.100 --> 08:49.100
action.

08:49.100 --> 08:51.620
What could they do if they drove by a car accident or a house fire?

08:51.620 --> 08:55.740
Men commonly report that they're overwhelmingly just waiting around hoping to save the day

08:55.740 --> 08:58.660
somehow, even if that means hurting themselves in the process.

08:58.660 --> 09:02.820
Framing this conversation in terms of Rome is falling, there's barbarians at the gates,

09:02.820 --> 09:06.460
what can we do to fix the situation, is a pretty funny meme, but it goes deeper than

09:06.460 --> 09:07.460
Rome.

09:07.460 --> 09:11.620
Most men feel the desire to be useful to those around them, and they tend to self-destruct

09:11.620 --> 09:12.780
when they can't be.

09:12.780 --> 09:16.900
More than anything else, this is the greatest risk that automation poses, by the way.

09:16.900 --> 09:21.200
It's also the main reason that men tend to reject socialism or welfare capitalism more

09:21.200 --> 09:22.200
than women do.

09:22.200 --> 09:25.440
For the average guy, there seems to be an innate desire to be the type of person who

09:25.440 --> 09:29.340
invests more into a system than they withdraw from it, at the final count.

09:29.340 --> 09:32.500
Women know this and take advantage of it, and that's not inherently negative.

09:32.500 --> 09:35.160
It's not all just e-thoughts draining the wallets of simps.

09:35.160 --> 09:39.220
Men are happy to serve the women they're devoted to, they just want devotion back.

09:39.220 --> 09:43.900
Funny enough, this whole thing spawned a submeme called My Roman Empire, where women describe

09:43.900 --> 09:47.180
the things that they think about as much as men think about the Roman Empire.

09:47.180 --> 09:51.300
Most women mention movies, or pop stars, or celebrity shit, though one of them does say

09:51.300 --> 09:54.020
that her Roman Empire is eating the rich.

09:54.020 --> 09:55.320
What's My Roman Empire?

09:55.320 --> 09:56.700
So glad you asked, let me tell you.

09:56.700 --> 10:00.900
It is eating rich, and I don't just mean any rich person.

10:00.900 --> 10:03.520
I mean the uber wealthy.

10:03.520 --> 10:04.660
The top 1%.

10:04.660 --> 10:10.660
In general, women tend to outline less civilizational, more localist daily life concerns as their

10:10.660 --> 10:11.660
Roman Empire.

10:11.660 --> 10:15.900
And when they do think about those larger concerns, they do so from a position of desiring

10:15.900 --> 10:17.360
more equality.

10:17.360 --> 10:19.840
Like I said at the start of the video, that doesn't automatically make those things

10:19.840 --> 10:22.260
lesser or bad or something.

10:22.260 --> 10:25.700
We all know that equality is a destructive force, ultimately, because it makes the best

10:25.700 --> 10:27.320
people on par with the worst.

10:27.320 --> 10:30.480
But we also know that a society with too much inequality tends to collapse.

10:30.480 --> 10:34.080
And in a more general sense, we all know that it's the little things that make life worth

10:34.080 --> 10:35.080
living.

10:35.080 --> 10:38.040
It's those local, daily life concerns that are the most enjoyable.

10:38.040 --> 10:41.640
I think this is just another data point in a long series of data points showing that

10:41.640 --> 10:46.400
men and women are different and complementary, and that both are necessary, that they both

10:46.400 --> 10:47.780
make things better.

10:47.780 --> 10:51.680
All of those smaller order concerns, the ones that women tend to focus on, those are the

10:51.680 --> 10:54.320
things that make manning the walls worthwhile.

10:54.320 --> 10:58.120
Men know that they need to maintain their society, but women know why it needs to be

10:58.120 --> 10:59.120
maintained.

10:59.120 --> 11:01.200
Though at the end of the day, maybe it's just because we all want to get dominated

11:01.200 --> 11:02.200
by Goths.

11:02.200 --> 11:03.200
Who knows?

11:03.200 --> 11:09.200
Just out of curiosity, how often do you think about the Roman Empire?

11:09.200 --> 11:11.720
Not that often.

11:11.720 --> 11:12.720
Why?

11:12.720 --> 11:13.720
Give me a rate.

11:13.720 --> 11:18.720
I mean, I used to think about it a lot more in high school than I do currently.

11:18.720 --> 11:19.720
Why?

11:19.720 --> 11:23.720
Because I was taking history classes in high school.

11:24.120 --> 11:27.120
Let's say one or two times a month.

11:27.120 --> 11:28.120
Okay.

11:28.120 --> 11:29.120
Oh.

11:34.120 --> 11:36.120
Are you expecting that answer?

11:36.120 --> 11:37.120
No!

11:37.120 --> 11:38.120
Why?

11:38.120 --> 11:44.120
I was, I was kind of expecting never, because that's the answer that most women give.

11:44.120 --> 11:48.120
I was not expecting, I guess, you know what, you giving the middle of the road answer sounds

11:48.120 --> 11:49.120
about right.

11:49.120 --> 11:50.120
Yeah.

11:50.120 --> 11:52.120
And sexual friendly.

11:52.520 --> 11:53.520
Oh my God.

11:57.520 --> 12:00.520
So Naomi wanted to point out that she's not actually trans, right?

12:00.520 --> 12:01.520
I'm not.

12:01.520 --> 12:02.520
You just did it.

12:02.520 --> 12:03.520
Except for the memes.
