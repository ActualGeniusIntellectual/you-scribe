00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,160
Hello, my friends, let me give you an update on what's going on.

2
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:08,460
As you know, I've hired my childhood friend and local stooge, Dave, to be my first full

3
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:10,520
timer here on the SFO channel.

4
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:16,180
The first thing he did was he uploaded the entire SFO backlog to the SFO Bitchute, Rumble,

5
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:21,580
Brighteon and Odyssey channels, since I had kind of neglected those for a little while.

6
00:00:21,580 --> 00:00:25,600
And one of his daily jobs is going to be to make sure that I put my videos on all of those

7
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:27,280
platforms, not just YouTube.

8
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:30,760
So if you don't like YouTube, and really, who likes YouTube nowadays, make sure you're

9
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:32,120
checking those channels out.

10
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:36,700
But now that the long, boring job of uploading the backlog is done, the next thing he's doing

11
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:40,240
is uploading the backlog for my side channel, The Dev Kit.

12
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:42,560
Now you might not know what The Dev Kit is, and that's fine.

13
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:46,640
But if you've been around long enough, you'll probably remember a time in which SFO, meaning

14
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:50,400
Short Fight Otaku, was actually about anime.

15
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:53,320
You know, that's what the Otaku means in that title.

16
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:56,680
For those of you who don't know, who've only been here recently, this channel began in

17
00:00:56,680 --> 00:01:00,680
2009 when we were a lot younger, and it was basically just me and my friends goofing around

18
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:02,320
and uploading random anime crap.

19
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:04,680
We had a good time doing it, I don't regret it or anything.

20
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:07,200
But obviously the channel has changed in the past 12 years.

21
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:11,160
It is kind of funny sometimes seeing people complaining that I'm talking about politics

22
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:12,160
on Twitter.

23
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:13,880
It's like, aren't you an anime reviewer?

24
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:15,360
How long have you been gone?

25
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:18,880
But there are actually some older fans who have asked, hey, where are those old anime

26
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:19,880
reviews?

27
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:20,880
Where did they go?

28
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:21,880
Are you re-uploading them anywhere?

29
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:24,040
Because yes, they're going up on the dev kit.

30
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:26,760
So that is the next project I'm putting Dave to work on.

31
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:32,640
We've opened up dev kit channels on the same platforms, YouTube, Bitchute, Brighteon, Rumble,

32
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:33,640
and Odyssey.

33
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:35,560
And all of the old anime reviews are going up there.

34
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:39,400
All of our old blooper reels and commentary tracks, they'll be going up there too.

35
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:42,160
We had some old movie reviews, some old tech reviews.

36
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:46,000
There's that video of me and Naomi burning my old underwear.

37
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,300
Basically everything that I've done that isn't related to either the SFO politics stuff or

38
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:54,400
my gaming stream over at Game Boomers is going to be going up on the dev kit.

39
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:58,460
So it's not politics related, but it is something that I do want to focus on a little bit in

40
00:01:58,460 --> 00:02:01,140
the coming days, you know, give it its time to shine.

41
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:03,300
So please consider following the dev kit.

42
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:04,740
All the links are in the description of this video.

43
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:05,740
Thanks very much guys.

44
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:09,700
And I'll see you soon with either a new SFO video or a new stream or something.

45
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:10,820
I'll see you there.

46
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:11,820
Have a good one.

47
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:11,840
I love you.
