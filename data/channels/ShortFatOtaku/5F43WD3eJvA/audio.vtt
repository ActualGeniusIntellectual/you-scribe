Hello, my friends, let me give you an update on what's going on.

00:03.160 --> 00:08.460
As you know, I've hired my childhood friend and local stooge, Dave, to be my first full

00:08.460 --> 00:10.520
timer here on the SFO channel.

00:10.520 --> 00:16.180
The first thing he did was he uploaded the entire SFO backlog to the SFO Bitchute, Rumble,

00:16.180 --> 00:21.580
Brighteon and Odyssey channels, since I had kind of neglected those for a little while.

00:21.580 --> 00:25.600
And one of his daily jobs is going to be to make sure that I put my videos on all of those

00:25.600 --> 00:27.280
platforms, not just YouTube.

00:27.280 --> 00:30.760
So if you don't like YouTube, and really, who likes YouTube nowadays, make sure you're

00:30.760 --> 00:32.120
checking those channels out.

00:32.120 --> 00:36.700
But now that the long, boring job of uploading the backlog is done, the next thing he's doing

00:36.700 --> 00:40.240
is uploading the backlog for my side channel, The Dev Kit.

00:40.240 --> 00:42.560
Now you might not know what The Dev Kit is, and that's fine.

00:42.560 --> 00:46.640
But if you've been around long enough, you'll probably remember a time in which SFO, meaning

00:46.640 --> 00:50.400
Short Fight Otaku, was actually about anime.

00:50.400 --> 00:53.320
You know, that's what the Otaku means in that title.

00:53.360 --> 00:56.680
For those of you who don't know, who've only been here recently, this channel began in

00:56.680 --> 01:00.680
2009 when we were a lot younger, and it was basically just me and my friends goofing around

01:00.680 --> 01:02.320
and uploading random anime crap.

01:02.320 --> 01:04.680
We had a good time doing it, I don't regret it or anything.

01:04.680 --> 01:07.200
But obviously the channel has changed in the past 12 years.

01:07.200 --> 01:11.160
It is kind of funny sometimes seeing people complaining that I'm talking about politics

01:11.160 --> 01:12.160
on Twitter.

01:12.160 --> 01:13.880
It's like, aren't you an anime reviewer?

01:13.880 --> 01:15.360
How long have you been gone?

01:15.360 --> 01:18.880
But there are actually some older fans who have asked, hey, where are those old anime

01:18.880 --> 01:19.880
reviews?

01:19.880 --> 01:20.880
Where did they go?

01:20.880 --> 01:21.880
Are you re-uploading them anywhere?

01:21.880 --> 01:24.040
Because yes, they're going up on the dev kit.

01:24.040 --> 01:26.760
So that is the next project I'm putting Dave to work on.

01:26.760 --> 01:32.640
We've opened up dev kit channels on the same platforms, YouTube, Bitchute, Brighteon, Rumble,

01:32.640 --> 01:33.640
and Odyssey.

01:33.640 --> 01:35.560
And all of the old anime reviews are going up there.

01:35.560 --> 01:39.400
All of our old blooper reels and commentary tracks, they'll be going up there too.

01:39.400 --> 01:42.160
We had some old movie reviews, some old tech reviews.

01:42.160 --> 01:46.000
There's that video of me and Naomi burning my old underwear.

01:46.000 --> 01:50.300
Basically everything that I've done that isn't related to either the SFO politics stuff or

01:50.300 --> 01:54.400
my gaming stream over at Game Boomers is going to be going up on the dev kit.

01:54.400 --> 01:58.460
So it's not politics related, but it is something that I do want to focus on a little bit in

01:58.460 --> 02:01.140
the coming days, you know, give it its time to shine.

02:01.140 --> 02:03.300
So please consider following the dev kit.

02:03.300 --> 02:04.740
All the links are in the description of this video.

02:04.740 --> 02:05.740
Thanks very much guys.

02:05.740 --> 02:09.700
And I'll see you soon with either a new SFO video or a new stream or something.

02:09.700 --> 02:10.820
I'll see you there.

02:10.820 --> 02:11.820
Have a good one.

02:11.820 --> 02:11.840
I love you.
