0	3160	Hello, my friends, let me give you an update on what's going on.
3160	8460	As you know, I've hired my childhood friend and local stooge, Dave, to be my first full
8460	10520	timer here on the SFO channel.
10520	16180	The first thing he did was he uploaded the entire SFO backlog to the SFO Bitchute, Rumble,
16180	21580	Brighteon and Odyssey channels, since I had kind of neglected those for a little while.
21580	25600	And one of his daily jobs is going to be to make sure that I put my videos on all of those
25600	27280	platforms, not just YouTube.
27280	30760	So if you don't like YouTube, and really, who likes YouTube nowadays, make sure you're
30760	32120	checking those channels out.
32120	36700	But now that the long, boring job of uploading the backlog is done, the next thing he's doing
36700	40240	is uploading the backlog for my side channel, The Dev Kit.
40240	42560	Now you might not know what The Dev Kit is, and that's fine.
42560	46640	But if you've been around long enough, you'll probably remember a time in which SFO, meaning
46640	50400	Short Fight Otaku, was actually about anime.
50400	53320	You know, that's what the Otaku means in that title.
53360	56680	For those of you who don't know, who've only been here recently, this channel began in
56680	60680	2009 when we were a lot younger, and it was basically just me and my friends goofing around
60680	62320	and uploading random anime crap.
62320	64680	We had a good time doing it, I don't regret it or anything.
64680	67200	But obviously the channel has changed in the past 12 years.
67200	71160	It is kind of funny sometimes seeing people complaining that I'm talking about politics
71160	72160	on Twitter.
72160	73880	It's like, aren't you an anime reviewer?
73880	75360	How long have you been gone?
75360	78880	But there are actually some older fans who have asked, hey, where are those old anime
78880	79880	reviews?
79880	80880	Where did they go?
80880	81880	Are you re-uploading them anywhere?
81880	84040	Because yes, they're going up on the dev kit.
84040	86760	So that is the next project I'm putting Dave to work on.
86760	92640	We've opened up dev kit channels on the same platforms, YouTube, Bitchute, Brighteon, Rumble,
92640	93640	and Odyssey.
93640	95560	And all of the old anime reviews are going up there.
95560	99400	All of our old blooper reels and commentary tracks, they'll be going up there too.
99400	102160	We had some old movie reviews, some old tech reviews.
102160	106000	There's that video of me and Naomi burning my old underwear.
106000	110300	Basically everything that I've done that isn't related to either the SFO politics stuff or
110300	114400	my gaming stream over at Game Boomers is going to be going up on the dev kit.
114400	118460	So it's not politics related, but it is something that I do want to focus on a little bit in
118460	121140	the coming days, you know, give it its time to shine.
121140	123300	So please consider following the dev kit.
123300	124740	All the links are in the description of this video.
124740	125740	Thanks very much guys.
125740	129700	And I'll see you soon with either a new SFO video or a new stream or something.
129700	130820	I'll see you there.
130820	131820	Have a good one.
131820	131840	I love you.
