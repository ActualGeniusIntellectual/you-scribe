1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,920
We haven't checked in on the garden a little bit.

2
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:08,820
It's currently raining like mad, but things are actually going pretty well down there.

3
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:10,680
It's time for another chard harvest.

4
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:13,240
Cucumbers are looking good, for the most part.

5
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:15,280
Tomatoes are looking good.

6
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:17,320
It's time to weed again though.

7
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:18,440
We can't do it today.

8
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:19,440
Too much rain.

9
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:22,160
Oh also, god dammit, the laundry.

10
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:24,040
It just started raining out of nowhere.

11
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:28,920
Like it went from zero to a hundred on the rain in about thirty seconds and the laundry's

12
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:30,480
already ruined.

13
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:34,600
Like it's, it's, it's done.

14
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:39,840
Okay guys, while Naomi goes and fills out the watering can, I'm going to give you, I

15
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:42,000
just sprung that on her.

16
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,440
I'm going to give you the update for the garden.

17
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:49,560
It is the beginning of the second week of July and things are going okay.

18
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:52,840
We have a lot of weeding to do again as you can see.

19
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:55,340
In fact, look at this giant weed right here.

20
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:56,340
Look at this thing.

21
00:00:56,980 --> 00:01:01,820
I should just, just grab that out right now, eh?

22
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:04,700
It grew into the lattice, oh my god.

23
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:08,340
Wow, I might like destroy the lattice taking this thing out.

24
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:09,540
There we go.

25
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:13,900
So basically there's a lot of weeding to do but the plants are actually doing kind of

26
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:14,900
okay.

27
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:18,300
The chard grows just as wild as the kale does.

28
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:21,940
We're constantly cutting and eating it and it's just, it just comes back after a few

29
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:22,940
days.

30
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:25,240
The peppers are going slow but the peppers always go slow.

31
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:30,360
Three out of the four cucumber plants, this one, this one, and this one have begun to

32
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:34,280
grow but that one is turning kind of yellow and not really moving.

33
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:35,280
I don't know why.

34
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:40,520
The four tomato plants are going okay but this one kind of sucks and as for the beans,

35
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:44,800
they seem to be going okay as well but this bean that was right here in between these

36
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,960
two, that one died.

37
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:49,400
But the beans are definitely going way slower than the peas.

38
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:51,880
Well, Naomi's back with the water, I guess.

39
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:54,320
Don't water yet, it's weed first unless you want to like...

40
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:56,160
How did you make me get water?

41
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:58,560
Um, it was kind of cinematic for the video.

42
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:03,240
Anyway, we're gonna weed some of this stuff out and um, maybe cut some kale for tonight

43
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:07,280
for our salad for dinner and then we'll, we'll uh, get out of here.

44
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,280
Kale?

45
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:09,280
Oh, right.

46
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,280
Chard.

47
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:11,280
Jesus.

48
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,280
Oh dear.

49
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:13,280
When you start growing kale.

50
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:17,640
You know what I'm actually thinking, we should do what my dad did for his garden and take

51
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:19,640
a year off.

52
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:24,120
He said that like, it does help like replenish the soil if you just take a year, only throw

53
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:28,640
compost into it, it's probably a good idea because the garden is definitely doing not

54
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:29,640
as well.

55
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:32,000
Also, the fact that we might be moving, right?

56
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,960
So you know, if we still are here next year, maybe we just shouldn't do anything.

57
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:37,960
Yeah.

58
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:41,200
Actually, here's kind of a funny question.

59
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:44,400
If we do move, should we take the garden with us?

60
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,640
Like just put, like it's all good earth, just put all the earth in totes and just bring

61
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:49,840
it to our new place?

62
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:50,840
Why not?

63
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:53,560
I'll, I'll shovel it out.

64
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:56,560
I'll just build a new garden, it'll be better than that.

65
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,560
Yeah, but the earth costs us some money.

66
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,560
Oh boo.

67
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:07,160
One thing I should do is take this cucumber vine and get it off the tomato plant.

68
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:08,160
Can I show you?

69
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:10,160
It's like wrapped around there, you see it?

70
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:12,160
It's not going to focus, is it?

71
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:14,160
It's right there.

72
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:15,160
Okay.

73
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:26,360
And then we'll feed the vine through the lattice and we'll have it go up.

74
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,360
That's pretty good.

75
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,200
I think this one hand is kind of, kind of tricky.

76
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:31,200
There we go.

77
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,200
You know what?

78
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:35,200
I'll probably have to crawl underneath that again like last year and pull out a bunch

79
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,200
of that.

80
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,200
Those like long weeds.

81
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:40,760
Have you noticed just how much overgrowth is happening back here now?

82
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:41,760
Yep.

83
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:45,360
It is kind of nice, but also kind of stifling a bit.

84
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:50,960
We probably had our best year back when, uh, there was no trees.

85
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:55,040
Pulling like dandelions and weeds and stuff out of the lattice sucks because it's all

86
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:58,760
just in there, you know, and it's all wrapped around.

87
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:00,760
Hey, the bird nest.

88
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:01,760
What?

89
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:02,760
On the lattice.

90
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:03,760
On the lattice?

91
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:04,760
Ladder.

92
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:05,760
Oh.

93
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:09,760
I was wondering why there's been so many birds around here lately.

94
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:10,760
Yeah.

95
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:12,760
There's like a bird nest on the ladder, dude.

96
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:13,760
He's just hanging out.

97
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:16,760
It shows how much this ladder gets used.

98
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:17,760
Hope some birds don't attack us.

99
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:18,760
We're good.

100
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:25,760
Haven't you guys taken out the compost like several times and you haven't noticed?

101
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:26,760
No.

102
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:27,760
Wow.

103
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:28,760
Oh, there he goes.

104
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:29,760
Jesus.

105
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:32,760
Please don't make the bird attack us.

106
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:35,760
I mean, it really shouldn't be there, but we'll just leave it for this year.

107
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:37,760
We'll clear it out in fall or something when the birds leave.

108
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:41,360
So while weeding, I'm starting to wonder if some of these are actually seeds from last

109
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:45,760
year because this looks like it might have been like a tomato sprout.

110
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:48,760
Does it look anything like a tomato sprout?

111
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:49,760
It kind of does.

112
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:50,760
Definitely.

113
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:52,760
When I used to grow from seed, it kind of looked like this.

114
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:54,760
I think that you're mistaken grass for tomatoes.

115
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:55,760
Yeah, maybe.

116
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:57,760
I think there's a bunch of bugs in here.

117
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:59,760
Oh, Naomi, the bugs.

118
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:00,760
I'm leaving.

119
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:01,760
Hold on.

120
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:02,760
Hold on.

121
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:03,760
Those are the bugs.

122
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:04,760
Just wait.

123
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:05,760
Let me go.

124
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:06,760
Just wait.

125
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:09,760
I'll pour some water on you instead.

126
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:11,760
No, that makes it worse.

127
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:12,760
Okay.

128
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:14,760
I think we're done for today.

129
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:15,760
The garden.

130
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:17,760
I mean, it's one of those situations where it's not my best garden.

131
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:20,760
The best garden was two or three years ago, but I think it might be going better than

132
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:21,760
last year, maybe.

133
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:22,760
I don't know.

134
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:23,760
How do you feel about it?

135
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:24,760
I'm in the blink.

136
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:26,760
I have no idea how gardens and plants work.

137
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:27,760
Really?

138
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:28,760
You've been doing this with me for a while.

139
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:29,760
I don't know.

140
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:31,760
I don't retain knowledge.

141
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:32,760
Oh, yeah.

142
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:35,760
I figured that out, actually.

143
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:39,760
Dude, even that extra bit of kale turned into its own plant.

144
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:40,760
It's kind of wild.

145
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:42,760
I got five for the price of four.

146
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:43,760
Kind of wild.

147
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:44,760
What is it?

148
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:45,760
Sorry.

149
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:46,760
Charred.

150
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:47,760
Right.

151
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:48,760
It looks nothing like kale.

152
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:51,760
It has a giant red veiny scent.

153
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:53,760
I'm the one who can't retain any knowledge.

154
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:54,760
Okay.

155
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:08,760
Are you fucking kidding me?

156
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:10,760
We're not even at the house right now.

157
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:11,760
There's nothing I can do.

158
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:12,760
We're just going to lose the garden.

159
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:27,760
Okay, this is future dev editing the video here.

160
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:31,760
This is some footage of the garden that Dave took from the kitchen window while we were

161
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:32,760
gone.

162
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:35,760
It turns out that it actually mostly survived.

163
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:40,760
It was more heavy rain than hail in our area, but for a while I was definitely worried.

164
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:43,760
Hey, guys.

165
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:48,760
It's August 1st, and as you can see, the garden's actually going pretty well.

166
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:51,760
There's finally some peppers coming in there and there.

167
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:52,760
There's a tomato that fell.

168
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:54,760
Pepper plants looking great.

169
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:57,760
We have been eating the Swiss chard, by the way.

170
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:00,760
I know it doesn't look like it, but it grows even faster than kale does.

171
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:04,760
The cucumber there just didn't take off, but these ones are going okay, especially

172
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:07,760
the ones that I put up the lattice, so I guess we'll see.

173
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:10,760
And then there's the beans.

174
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:11,760
There are some beans here.

175
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:14,760
There's a bean, but it's not growing like a vine would.

176
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:16,760
I thought it would go up the lattice here, you know?

177
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:17,760
I don't know, man.

178
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:19,760
I guess I don't know enough about beans to really figure it out, because when you look

179
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:24,760
at them, it looks more like a regular plant than a vine, and I always thought that beans

180
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:25,760
grew on vines.

181
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:27,760
Let's put grass out of here.

182
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:29,760
It's producing beans.

183
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:31,760
It's just not growing up the lattice.

184
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:32,760
I don't know.

185
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:35,760
Looking at the cucumbers in the back, they look pretty good.

186
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:39,760
Let's see if I can get another one to go up.

187
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:41,760
Yeah, here we go.

188
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:43,760
Rather than growing on top of each other, guys.

189
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:44,760
Ow, it's pokey.

190
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:45,760
Come on.

191
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:46,760
Grow this way.

192
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:50,760
Yep, that one cucumber just didn't grow.

193
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:51,760
Don't know why.

194
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:53,760
Everything else is doing okay, though.

195
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:54,760
There we go.

196
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:55,760
Putting it all inside the cages.

197
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:58,760
Those beans down there look pretty developed.

198
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:01,760
Maybe I'll grab them for dinner tonight.

199
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:03,760
Those ones over there, too.

200
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:05,760
And here's the one tomato that fell off on itself.

201
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:06,760
Anything wrong with it?

202
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:07,760
Nope, it's just green.

203
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:11,760
So maybe what I'll do is I'll just see if it ripens up inside.

204
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:13,760
You see that?

205
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:16,760
Severe thunderstorm warning.

206
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:21,760
Oh, the garbage can fell over.

207
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:26,760
Let's hope the garden's okay.

208
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:28,760
It'll probably be fine, to be honest.

209
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:29,760
It really needs the water.

210
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:38,760
I also just noticed, dude, that bird's nest by the garden right there in the ladder, the

211
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:39,760
birds are coming.

212
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,760
I think you just missed them.

213
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:45,760
Maybe they'll come back while I'm recording this, but the birds have been coming and going

214
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,760
constantly, getting stuck in the rain.

215
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,760
Oh, there was a lightning flash.

216
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,760
It's quite the day.

217
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:55,760
Hey, guys, the day is August 5th, though it's the middle of the night, so I think I actually

218
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,760
might be early August 6th at this point.

219
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:58,760
It's Saturday in any case.

220
00:08:58,760 --> 00:08:59,760
I think it's Saturday.

221
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:03,760
I've been keeping some pretty late nights, doing a lot of work recently, so I've come

222
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:06,760
down to the garden, grabbed some kale for dinner.

223
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:09,760
Got to go into the shed and grab those pink snips also.

224
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,760
Oh, the bird's just hanging out.

225
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,760
I think there's actually a family of them now, you know?

226
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:20,760
I wonder if he doesn't like the floodlight from the house, keeping him awake, but I think

227
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:21,760
there's a family of them.

228
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:25,760
Like, I think there's two adult birds and several children, I think.

229
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:30,760
In any case, let's go to the shed and get the snips that Naomi makes me use because

230
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:34,760
she doesn't like it when I bring out outside scissors.

231
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:37,760
Ah, geez, new lawnmower in the way.

232
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,760
I have too much stuff in here, you know?

233
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:40,760
Can't even reach them.

234
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:43,760
Oh, I'm so close.

235
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:44,760
Wait.

236
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:48,760
Yeah, there's a square here, if I can just, like...

237
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:54,760
Oh, bingo.

238
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,760
I might as well show you the place, eh?

239
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:58,760
Even though it's the middle of the night.

240
00:09:58,760 --> 00:09:59,760
Cucumbers growing up nicely.

241
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:02,760
I still don't quite know what to do with the beans, but I guess they're okay.

242
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:04,760
Tomatoes coming along very well.

243
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:05,760
Peppers as well.

244
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:08,760
In fact, some of these might actually be good to grab soon.

245
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:11,760
There's one, I don't know if you can see it with the shadows, but there's one.

246
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:12,760
I'm pointing at it with my, uh...

247
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:14,760
I can't see anything with these shadows.

248
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:15,760
Right there, you see that?

249
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:18,760
Today is time for...

250
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:19,760
Frickin' hell.

251
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:21,760
Yeah.

252
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:22,760
Dinner time, guys.

253
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:26,760
You take, like, two or three of these leaves, put them in a sandwich.

254
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:28,760
It's great.

255
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:30,760
You know, wash them off, obviously.

256
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:31,760
Especially if there's birds around.

257
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:34,760
Stuff your sandwich full of these, you won't go wrong.

258
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:35,760
There we go.

259
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,760
Good for salads, good for soups, good for sandwiches.

260
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:40,760
It's a good lettuce replacement, even though it's kind of bitter.

261
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:41,760
But you know what?

262
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:42,760
I'll take it.

263
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:45,760
Man, the back deck's kind of spooky at 2 AM, eh?

264
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,760
Sorry for disturbing you, buddy.

265
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:50,760
In any case, this will probably be the last garden update, at least until the fall harvest,

266
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:52,760
because there's not much more to do, eh?

267
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:56,760
The hail is over, like, all the big disasters of the year seem to have run their course.

268
00:10:56,760 --> 00:11:00,760
Things are definitely set in motion, you know, things are kind of growing on their own.

269
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:03,760
Not much more to say until we, uh, we see what we get out of this.

270
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,760
Thanks for being here, everyone.

271
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,760
I will see you next time.

272
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:08,760
Ah, here's mosquitoes.

273
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:31,760
Thanks for watching.
