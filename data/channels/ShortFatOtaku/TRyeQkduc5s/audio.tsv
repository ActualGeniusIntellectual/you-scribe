0	3920	We haven't checked in on the garden a little bit.
3920	8820	It's currently raining like mad, but things are actually going pretty well down there.
8820	10680	It's time for another chard harvest.
10680	13240	Cucumbers are looking good, for the most part.
13240	15280	Tomatoes are looking good.
15280	17320	It's time to weed again though.
17320	18440	We can't do it today.
18440	19440	Too much rain.
19440	22160	Oh also, god dammit, the laundry.
22160	24040	It just started raining out of nowhere.
24040	28920	Like it went from zero to a hundred on the rain in about thirty seconds and the laundry's
28920	30480	already ruined.
30480	34600	Like it's, it's, it's done.
34600	39840	Okay guys, while Naomi goes and fills out the watering can, I'm going to give you, I
39840	42000	just sprung that on her.
42000	44440	I'm going to give you the update for the garden.
44440	49560	It is the beginning of the second week of July and things are going okay.
49560	52840	We have a lot of weeding to do again as you can see.
52840	55340	In fact, look at this giant weed right here.
55340	56340	Look at this thing.
56980	61820	I should just, just grab that out right now, eh?
61820	64700	It grew into the lattice, oh my god.
64700	68340	Wow, I might like destroy the lattice taking this thing out.
68340	69540	There we go.
69540	73900	So basically there's a lot of weeding to do but the plants are actually doing kind of
73900	74900	okay.
74900	78300	The chard grows just as wild as the kale does.
78300	81940	We're constantly cutting and eating it and it's just, it just comes back after a few
81940	82940	days.
82940	85240	The peppers are going slow but the peppers always go slow.
85280	90360	Three out of the four cucumber plants, this one, this one, and this one have begun to
90360	94280	grow but that one is turning kind of yellow and not really moving.
94280	95280	I don't know why.
95280	100520	The four tomato plants are going okay but this one kind of sucks and as for the beans,
100520	104800	they seem to be going okay as well but this bean that was right here in between these
104800	106960	two, that one died.
106960	109400	But the beans are definitely going way slower than the peas.
109400	111880	Well, Naomi's back with the water, I guess.
111880	114320	Don't water yet, it's weed first unless you want to like...
114360	116160	How did you make me get water?
116160	118560	Um, it was kind of cinematic for the video.
118560	123240	Anyway, we're gonna weed some of this stuff out and um, maybe cut some kale for tonight
123240	127280	for our salad for dinner and then we'll, we'll uh, get out of here.
127280	128280	Kale?
128280	129280	Oh, right.
129280	130280	Chard.
130280	131280	Jesus.
131280	132280	Oh dear.
132280	133280	When you start growing kale.
133280	137640	You know what I'm actually thinking, we should do what my dad did for his garden and take
137640	139640	a year off.
139640	144120	He said that like, it does help like replenish the soil if you just take a year, only throw
144120	148640	compost into it, it's probably a good idea because the garden is definitely doing not
148640	149640	as well.
149640	152000	Also, the fact that we might be moving, right?
152000	156960	So you know, if we still are here next year, maybe we just shouldn't do anything.
156960	157960	Yeah.
157960	161200	Actually, here's kind of a funny question.
161200	164400	If we do move, should we take the garden with us?
164400	167640	Like just put, like it's all good earth, just put all the earth in totes and just bring
167640	169840	it to our new place?
169840	170840	Why not?
171560	173560	I'll, I'll shovel it out.
173560	176560	I'll just build a new garden, it'll be better than that.
176560	178560	Yeah, but the earth costs us some money.
178560	180560	Oh boo.
180560	187160	One thing I should do is take this cucumber vine and get it off the tomato plant.
187160	188160	Can I show you?
188160	190160	It's like wrapped around there, you see it?
190160	192160	It's not going to focus, is it?
192160	194160	It's right there.
194160	195160	Okay.
195480	206360	And then we'll feed the vine through the lattice and we'll have it go up.
206360	207360	That's pretty good.
207360	210200	I think this one hand is kind of, kind of tricky.
210200	211200	There we go.
211200	212200	You know what?
212200	215200	I'll probably have to crawl underneath that again like last year and pull out a bunch
215200	216200	of that.
216200	217200	Those like long weeds.
217200	220760	Have you noticed just how much overgrowth is happening back here now?
220760	221760	Yep.
222360	225360	It is kind of nice, but also kind of stifling a bit.
225360	230960	We probably had our best year back when, uh, there was no trees.
230960	235040	Pulling like dandelions and weeds and stuff out of the lattice sucks because it's all
235040	238760	just in there, you know, and it's all wrapped around.
238760	240760	Hey, the bird nest.
240760	241760	What?
241760	242760	On the lattice.
242760	243760	On the lattice?
243760	244760	Ladder.
244760	245760	Oh.
245760	249760	I was wondering why there's been so many birds around here lately.
249760	250760	Yeah.
250760	252760	There's like a bird nest on the ladder, dude.
252760	253760	He's just hanging out.
253760	256760	It shows how much this ladder gets used.
256760	257760	Hope some birds don't attack us.
257760	258760	We're good.
262760	265760	Haven't you guys taken out the compost like several times and you haven't noticed?
265760	266760	No.
266760	267760	Wow.
267760	268760	Oh, there he goes.
268760	269760	Jesus.
269760	272760	Please don't make the bird attack us.
272760	275760	I mean, it really shouldn't be there, but we'll just leave it for this year.
275760	277760	We'll clear it out in fall or something when the birds leave.
277760	281360	So while weeding, I'm starting to wonder if some of these are actually seeds from last
281360	285760	year because this looks like it might have been like a tomato sprout.
285760	288760	Does it look anything like a tomato sprout?
288760	289760	It kind of does.
289760	290760	Definitely.
290760	292760	When I used to grow from seed, it kind of looked like this.
292760	294760	I think that you're mistaken grass for tomatoes.
294760	295760	Yeah, maybe.
295760	297760	I think there's a bunch of bugs in here.
297760	299760	Oh, Naomi, the bugs.
299760	300760	I'm leaving.
300760	301760	Hold on.
301760	302760	Hold on.
302760	303760	Those are the bugs.
303760	304760	Just wait.
304760	305760	Let me go.
305760	306760	Just wait.
307760	309760	I'll pour some water on you instead.
309760	311760	No, that makes it worse.
311760	312760	Okay.
312760	314760	I think we're done for today.
314760	315760	The garden.
315760	317760	I mean, it's one of those situations where it's not my best garden.
317760	320760	The best garden was two or three years ago, but I think it might be going better than
320760	321760	last year, maybe.
321760	322760	I don't know.
322760	323760	How do you feel about it?
323760	324760	I'm in the blink.
324760	326760	I have no idea how gardens and plants work.
326760	327760	Really?
327760	328760	You've been doing this with me for a while.
328760	329760	I don't know.
329760	331760	I don't retain knowledge.
331760	332760	Oh, yeah.
332760	335760	I figured that out, actually.
335760	339760	Dude, even that extra bit of kale turned into its own plant.
339760	340760	It's kind of wild.
340760	342760	I got five for the price of four.
342760	343760	Kind of wild.
343760	344760	What is it?
344760	345760	Sorry.
345760	346760	Charred.
346760	347760	Right.
347760	348760	It looks nothing like kale.
348760	351760	It has a giant red veiny scent.
351760	353760	I'm the one who can't retain any knowledge.
353760	354760	Okay.
365760	368760	Are you fucking kidding me?
368760	370760	We're not even at the house right now.
370760	371760	There's nothing I can do.
371760	372760	We're just going to lose the garden.
384760	387760	Okay, this is future dev editing the video here.
387760	391760	This is some footage of the garden that Dave took from the kitchen window while we were
391760	392760	gone.
392760	395760	It turns out that it actually mostly survived.
395760	400760	It was more heavy rain than hail in our area, but for a while I was definitely worried.
402760	403760	Hey, guys.
403760	408760	It's August 1st, and as you can see, the garden's actually going pretty well.
408760	411760	There's finally some peppers coming in there and there.
411760	412760	There's a tomato that fell.
412760	414760	Pepper plants looking great.
414760	417760	We have been eating the Swiss chard, by the way.
417760	420760	I know it doesn't look like it, but it grows even faster than kale does.
420760	424760	The cucumber there just didn't take off, but these ones are going okay, especially
424760	427760	the ones that I put up the lattice, so I guess we'll see.
427760	430760	And then there's the beans.
430760	431760	There are some beans here.
431760	434760	There's a bean, but it's not growing like a vine would.
434760	436760	I thought it would go up the lattice here, you know?
436760	437760	I don't know, man.
437760	439760	I guess I don't know enough about beans to really figure it out, because when you look
439760	444760	at them, it looks more like a regular plant than a vine, and I always thought that beans
444760	445760	grew on vines.
445760	447760	Let's put grass out of here.
447760	449760	It's producing beans.
449760	451760	It's just not growing up the lattice.
451760	452760	I don't know.
452760	455760	Looking at the cucumbers in the back, they look pretty good.
455760	459760	Let's see if I can get another one to go up.
459760	461760	Yeah, here we go.
461760	463760	Rather than growing on top of each other, guys.
463760	464760	Ow, it's pokey.
464760	465760	Come on.
465760	466760	Grow this way.
466760	470760	Yep, that one cucumber just didn't grow.
470760	471760	Don't know why.
471760	473760	Everything else is doing okay, though.
473760	474760	There we go.
474760	475760	Putting it all inside the cages.
475760	478760	Those beans down there look pretty developed.
478760	481760	Maybe I'll grab them for dinner tonight.
481760	483760	Those ones over there, too.
483760	485760	And here's the one tomato that fell off on itself.
485760	486760	Anything wrong with it?
486760	487760	Nope, it's just green.
487760	491760	So maybe what I'll do is I'll just see if it ripens up inside.
491760	493760	You see that?
493760	496760	Severe thunderstorm warning.
499760	501760	Oh, the garbage can fell over.
504760	506760	Let's hope the garden's okay.
506760	508760	It'll probably be fine, to be honest.
508760	509760	It really needs the water.
509760	518760	I also just noticed, dude, that bird's nest by the garden right there in the ladder, the
518760	519760	birds are coming.
519760	521760	I think you just missed them.
521760	525760	Maybe they'll come back while I'm recording this, but the birds have been coming and going
525760	527760	constantly, getting stuck in the rain.
527760	529760	Oh, there was a lightning flash.
529760	531760	It's quite the day.
531760	535760	Hey, guys, the day is August 5th, though it's the middle of the night, so I think I actually
535760	537760	might be early August 6th at this point.
537760	538760	It's Saturday in any case.
538760	539760	I think it's Saturday.
539760	543760	I've been keeping some pretty late nights, doing a lot of work recently, so I've come
543760	546760	down to the garden, grabbed some kale for dinner.
546760	549760	Got to go into the shed and grab those pink snips also.
551760	553760	Oh, the bird's just hanging out.
553760	555760	I think there's actually a family of them now, you know?
555760	560760	I wonder if he doesn't like the floodlight from the house, keeping him awake, but I think
560760	561760	there's a family of them.
561760	565760	Like, I think there's two adult birds and several children, I think.
565760	570760	In any case, let's go to the shed and get the snips that Naomi makes me use because
570760	574760	she doesn't like it when I bring out outside scissors.
574760	577760	Ah, geez, new lawnmower in the way.
577760	579760	I have too much stuff in here, you know?
579760	580760	Can't even reach them.
582760	583760	Oh, I'm so close.
583760	584760	Wait.
585760	588760	Yeah, there's a square here, if I can just, like...
592760	594760	Oh, bingo.
594760	596760	I might as well show you the place, eh?
596760	598760	Even though it's the middle of the night.
598760	599760	Cucumbers growing up nicely.
599760	602760	I still don't quite know what to do with the beans, but I guess they're okay.
602760	604760	Tomatoes coming along very well.
604760	605760	Peppers as well.
605760	608760	In fact, some of these might actually be good to grab soon.
608760	611760	There's one, I don't know if you can see it with the shadows, but there's one.
611760	612760	I'm pointing at it with my, uh...
612760	614760	I can't see anything with these shadows.
614760	615760	Right there, you see that?
615760	618760	Today is time for...
618760	619760	Frickin' hell.
620760	621760	Yeah.
621760	622760	Dinner time, guys.
622760	626760	You take, like, two or three of these leaves, put them in a sandwich.
627760	628760	It's great.
628760	630760	You know, wash them off, obviously.
630760	631760	Especially if there's birds around.
631760	634760	Stuff your sandwich full of these, you won't go wrong.
634760	635760	There we go.
635760	637760	Good for salads, good for soups, good for sandwiches.
637760	640760	It's a good lettuce replacement, even though it's kind of bitter.
640760	641760	But you know what?
641760	642760	I'll take it.
642760	645760	Man, the back deck's kind of spooky at 2 AM, eh?
645760	647760	Sorry for disturbing you, buddy.
647760	650760	In any case, this will probably be the last garden update, at least until the fall harvest,
650760	652760	because there's not much more to do, eh?
652760	656760	The hail is over, like, all the big disasters of the year seem to have run their course.
656760	660760	Things are definitely set in motion, you know, things are kind of growing on their own.
660760	663760	Not much more to say until we, uh, we see what we get out of this.
663760	665760	Thanks for being here, everyone.
665760	667760	I will see you next time.
667760	668760	Ah, here's mosquitoes.
677760	691760	Thanks for watching.
