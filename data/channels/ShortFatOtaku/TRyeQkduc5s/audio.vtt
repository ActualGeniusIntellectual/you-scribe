WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:03.920
We haven't checked in on the garden a little bit.

00:03.920 --> 00:08.820
It's currently raining like mad, but things are actually going pretty well down there.

00:08.820 --> 00:10.680
It's time for another chard harvest.

00:10.680 --> 00:13.240
Cucumbers are looking good, for the most part.

00:13.240 --> 00:15.280
Tomatoes are looking good.

00:15.280 --> 00:17.320
It's time to weed again though.

00:17.320 --> 00:18.440
We can't do it today.

00:18.440 --> 00:19.440
Too much rain.

00:19.440 --> 00:22.160
Oh also, god dammit, the laundry.

00:22.160 --> 00:24.040
It just started raining out of nowhere.

00:24.040 --> 00:28.920
Like it went from zero to a hundred on the rain in about thirty seconds and the laundry's

00:28.920 --> 00:30.480
already ruined.

00:30.480 --> 00:34.600
Like it's, it's, it's done.

00:34.600 --> 00:39.840
Okay guys, while Naomi goes and fills out the watering can, I'm going to give you, I

00:39.840 --> 00:42.000
just sprung that on her.

00:42.000 --> 00:44.440
I'm going to give you the update for the garden.

00:44.440 --> 00:49.560
It is the beginning of the second week of July and things are going okay.

00:49.560 --> 00:52.840
We have a lot of weeding to do again as you can see.

00:52.840 --> 00:55.340
In fact, look at this giant weed right here.

00:55.340 --> 00:56.340
Look at this thing.

00:56.980 --> 01:01.820
I should just, just grab that out right now, eh?

01:01.820 --> 01:04.700
It grew into the lattice, oh my god.

01:04.700 --> 01:08.340
Wow, I might like destroy the lattice taking this thing out.

01:08.340 --> 01:09.540
There we go.

01:09.540 --> 01:13.900
So basically there's a lot of weeding to do but the plants are actually doing kind of

01:13.900 --> 01:14.900
okay.

01:14.900 --> 01:18.300
The chard grows just as wild as the kale does.

01:18.300 --> 01:21.940
We're constantly cutting and eating it and it's just, it just comes back after a few

01:21.940 --> 01:22.940
days.

01:22.940 --> 01:25.240
The peppers are going slow but the peppers always go slow.

01:25.280 --> 01:30.360
Three out of the four cucumber plants, this one, this one, and this one have begun to

01:30.360 --> 01:34.280
grow but that one is turning kind of yellow and not really moving.

01:34.280 --> 01:35.280
I don't know why.

01:35.280 --> 01:40.520
The four tomato plants are going okay but this one kind of sucks and as for the beans,

01:40.520 --> 01:44.800
they seem to be going okay as well but this bean that was right here in between these

01:44.800 --> 01:46.960
two, that one died.

01:46.960 --> 01:49.400
But the beans are definitely going way slower than the peas.

01:49.400 --> 01:51.880
Well, Naomi's back with the water, I guess.

01:51.880 --> 01:54.320
Don't water yet, it's weed first unless you want to like...

01:54.360 --> 01:56.160
How did you make me get water?

01:56.160 --> 01:58.560
Um, it was kind of cinematic for the video.

01:58.560 --> 02:03.240
Anyway, we're gonna weed some of this stuff out and um, maybe cut some kale for tonight

02:03.240 --> 02:07.280
for our salad for dinner and then we'll, we'll uh, get out of here.

02:07.280 --> 02:08.280
Kale?

02:08.280 --> 02:09.280
Oh, right.

02:09.280 --> 02:10.280
Chard.

02:10.280 --> 02:11.280
Jesus.

02:11.280 --> 02:12.280
Oh dear.

02:12.280 --> 02:13.280
When you start growing kale.

02:13.280 --> 02:17.640
You know what I'm actually thinking, we should do what my dad did for his garden and take

02:17.640 --> 02:19.640
a year off.

02:19.640 --> 02:24.120
He said that like, it does help like replenish the soil if you just take a year, only throw

02:24.120 --> 02:28.640
compost into it, it's probably a good idea because the garden is definitely doing not

02:28.640 --> 02:29.640
as well.

02:29.640 --> 02:32.000
Also, the fact that we might be moving, right?

02:32.000 --> 02:36.960
So you know, if we still are here next year, maybe we just shouldn't do anything.

02:36.960 --> 02:37.960
Yeah.

02:37.960 --> 02:41.200
Actually, here's kind of a funny question.

02:41.200 --> 02:44.400
If we do move, should we take the garden with us?

02:44.400 --> 02:47.640
Like just put, like it's all good earth, just put all the earth in totes and just bring

02:47.640 --> 02:49.840
it to our new place?

02:49.840 --> 02:50.840
Why not?

02:51.560 --> 02:53.560
I'll, I'll shovel it out.

02:53.560 --> 02:56.560
I'll just build a new garden, it'll be better than that.

02:56.560 --> 02:58.560
Yeah, but the earth costs us some money.

02:58.560 --> 03:00.560
Oh boo.

03:00.560 --> 03:07.160
One thing I should do is take this cucumber vine and get it off the tomato plant.

03:07.160 --> 03:08.160
Can I show you?

03:08.160 --> 03:10.160
It's like wrapped around there, you see it?

03:10.160 --> 03:12.160
It's not going to focus, is it?

03:12.160 --> 03:14.160
It's right there.

03:14.160 --> 03:15.160
Okay.

03:15.480 --> 03:26.360
And then we'll feed the vine through the lattice and we'll have it go up.

03:26.360 --> 03:27.360
That's pretty good.

03:27.360 --> 03:30.200
I think this one hand is kind of, kind of tricky.

03:30.200 --> 03:31.200
There we go.

03:31.200 --> 03:32.200
You know what?

03:32.200 --> 03:35.200
I'll probably have to crawl underneath that again like last year and pull out a bunch

03:35.200 --> 03:36.200
of that.

03:36.200 --> 03:37.200
Those like long weeds.

03:37.200 --> 03:40.760
Have you noticed just how much overgrowth is happening back here now?

03:40.760 --> 03:41.760
Yep.

03:42.360 --> 03:45.360
It is kind of nice, but also kind of stifling a bit.

03:45.360 --> 03:50.960
We probably had our best year back when, uh, there was no trees.

03:50.960 --> 03:55.040
Pulling like dandelions and weeds and stuff out of the lattice sucks because it's all

03:55.040 --> 03:58.760
just in there, you know, and it's all wrapped around.

03:58.760 --> 04:00.760
Hey, the bird nest.

04:00.760 --> 04:01.760
What?

04:01.760 --> 04:02.760
On the lattice.

04:02.760 --> 04:03.760
On the lattice?

04:03.760 --> 04:04.760
Ladder.

04:04.760 --> 04:05.760
Oh.

04:05.760 --> 04:09.760
I was wondering why there's been so many birds around here lately.

04:09.760 --> 04:10.760
Yeah.

04:10.760 --> 04:12.760
There's like a bird nest on the ladder, dude.

04:12.760 --> 04:13.760
He's just hanging out.

04:13.760 --> 04:16.760
It shows how much this ladder gets used.

04:16.760 --> 04:17.760
Hope some birds don't attack us.

04:17.760 --> 04:18.760
We're good.

04:22.760 --> 04:25.760
Haven't you guys taken out the compost like several times and you haven't noticed?

04:25.760 --> 04:26.760
No.

04:26.760 --> 04:27.760
Wow.

04:27.760 --> 04:28.760
Oh, there he goes.

04:28.760 --> 04:29.760
Jesus.

04:29.760 --> 04:32.760
Please don't make the bird attack us.

04:32.760 --> 04:35.760
I mean, it really shouldn't be there, but we'll just leave it for this year.

04:35.760 --> 04:37.760
We'll clear it out in fall or something when the birds leave.

04:37.760 --> 04:41.360
So while weeding, I'm starting to wonder if some of these are actually seeds from last

04:41.360 --> 04:45.760
year because this looks like it might have been like a tomato sprout.

04:45.760 --> 04:48.760
Does it look anything like a tomato sprout?

04:48.760 --> 04:49.760
It kind of does.

04:49.760 --> 04:50.760
Definitely.

04:50.760 --> 04:52.760
When I used to grow from seed, it kind of looked like this.

04:52.760 --> 04:54.760
I think that you're mistaken grass for tomatoes.

04:54.760 --> 04:55.760
Yeah, maybe.

04:55.760 --> 04:57.760
I think there's a bunch of bugs in here.

04:57.760 --> 04:59.760
Oh, Naomi, the bugs.

04:59.760 --> 05:00.760
I'm leaving.

05:00.760 --> 05:01.760
Hold on.

05:01.760 --> 05:02.760
Hold on.

05:02.760 --> 05:03.760
Those are the bugs.

05:03.760 --> 05:04.760
Just wait.

05:04.760 --> 05:05.760
Let me go.

05:05.760 --> 05:06.760
Just wait.

05:07.760 --> 05:09.760
I'll pour some water on you instead.

05:09.760 --> 05:11.760
No, that makes it worse.

05:11.760 --> 05:12.760
Okay.

05:12.760 --> 05:14.760
I think we're done for today.

05:14.760 --> 05:15.760
The garden.

05:15.760 --> 05:17.760
I mean, it's one of those situations where it's not my best garden.

05:17.760 --> 05:20.760
The best garden was two or three years ago, but I think it might be going better than

05:20.760 --> 05:21.760
last year, maybe.

05:21.760 --> 05:22.760
I don't know.

05:22.760 --> 05:23.760
How do you feel about it?

05:23.760 --> 05:24.760
I'm in the blink.

05:24.760 --> 05:26.760
I have no idea how gardens and plants work.

05:26.760 --> 05:27.760
Really?

05:27.760 --> 05:28.760
You've been doing this with me for a while.

05:28.760 --> 05:29.760
I don't know.

05:29.760 --> 05:31.760
I don't retain knowledge.

05:31.760 --> 05:32.760
Oh, yeah.

05:32.760 --> 05:35.760
I figured that out, actually.

05:35.760 --> 05:39.760
Dude, even that extra bit of kale turned into its own plant.

05:39.760 --> 05:40.760
It's kind of wild.

05:40.760 --> 05:42.760
I got five for the price of four.

05:42.760 --> 05:43.760
Kind of wild.

05:43.760 --> 05:44.760
What is it?

05:44.760 --> 05:45.760
Sorry.

05:45.760 --> 05:46.760
Charred.

05:46.760 --> 05:47.760
Right.

05:47.760 --> 05:48.760
It looks nothing like kale.

05:48.760 --> 05:51.760
It has a giant red veiny scent.

05:51.760 --> 05:53.760
I'm the one who can't retain any knowledge.

05:53.760 --> 05:54.760
Okay.

06:05.760 --> 06:08.760
Are you fucking kidding me?

06:08.760 --> 06:10.760
We're not even at the house right now.

06:10.760 --> 06:11.760
There's nothing I can do.

06:11.760 --> 06:12.760
We're just going to lose the garden.

06:24.760 --> 06:27.760
Okay, this is future dev editing the video here.

06:27.760 --> 06:31.760
This is some footage of the garden that Dave took from the kitchen window while we were

06:31.760 --> 06:32.760
gone.

06:32.760 --> 06:35.760
It turns out that it actually mostly survived.

06:35.760 --> 06:40.760
It was more heavy rain than hail in our area, but for a while I was definitely worried.

06:42.760 --> 06:43.760
Hey, guys.

06:43.760 --> 06:48.760
It's August 1st, and as you can see, the garden's actually going pretty well.

06:48.760 --> 06:51.760
There's finally some peppers coming in there and there.

06:51.760 --> 06:52.760
There's a tomato that fell.

06:52.760 --> 06:54.760
Pepper plants looking great.

06:54.760 --> 06:57.760
We have been eating the Swiss chard, by the way.

06:57.760 --> 07:00.760
I know it doesn't look like it, but it grows even faster than kale does.

07:00.760 --> 07:04.760
The cucumber there just didn't take off, but these ones are going okay, especially

07:04.760 --> 07:07.760
the ones that I put up the lattice, so I guess we'll see.

07:07.760 --> 07:10.760
And then there's the beans.

07:10.760 --> 07:11.760
There are some beans here.

07:11.760 --> 07:14.760
There's a bean, but it's not growing like a vine would.

07:14.760 --> 07:16.760
I thought it would go up the lattice here, you know?

07:16.760 --> 07:17.760
I don't know, man.

07:17.760 --> 07:19.760
I guess I don't know enough about beans to really figure it out, because when you look

07:19.760 --> 07:24.760
at them, it looks more like a regular plant than a vine, and I always thought that beans

07:24.760 --> 07:25.760
grew on vines.

07:25.760 --> 07:27.760
Let's put grass out of here.

07:27.760 --> 07:29.760
It's producing beans.

07:29.760 --> 07:31.760
It's just not growing up the lattice.

07:31.760 --> 07:32.760
I don't know.

07:32.760 --> 07:35.760
Looking at the cucumbers in the back, they look pretty good.

07:35.760 --> 07:39.760
Let's see if I can get another one to go up.

07:39.760 --> 07:41.760
Yeah, here we go.

07:41.760 --> 07:43.760
Rather than growing on top of each other, guys.

07:43.760 --> 07:44.760
Ow, it's pokey.

07:44.760 --> 07:45.760
Come on.

07:45.760 --> 07:46.760
Grow this way.

07:46.760 --> 07:50.760
Yep, that one cucumber just didn't grow.

07:50.760 --> 07:51.760
Don't know why.

07:51.760 --> 07:53.760
Everything else is doing okay, though.

07:53.760 --> 07:54.760
There we go.

07:54.760 --> 07:55.760
Putting it all inside the cages.

07:55.760 --> 07:58.760
Those beans down there look pretty developed.

07:58.760 --> 08:01.760
Maybe I'll grab them for dinner tonight.

08:01.760 --> 08:03.760
Those ones over there, too.

08:03.760 --> 08:05.760
And here's the one tomato that fell off on itself.

08:05.760 --> 08:06.760
Anything wrong with it?

08:06.760 --> 08:07.760
Nope, it's just green.

08:07.760 --> 08:11.760
So maybe what I'll do is I'll just see if it ripens up inside.

08:11.760 --> 08:13.760
You see that?

08:13.760 --> 08:16.760
Severe thunderstorm warning.

08:19.760 --> 08:21.760
Oh, the garbage can fell over.

08:24.760 --> 08:26.760
Let's hope the garden's okay.

08:26.760 --> 08:28.760
It'll probably be fine, to be honest.

08:28.760 --> 08:29.760
It really needs the water.

08:29.760 --> 08:38.760
I also just noticed, dude, that bird's nest by the garden right there in the ladder, the

08:38.760 --> 08:39.760
birds are coming.

08:39.760 --> 08:41.760
I think you just missed them.

08:41.760 --> 08:45.760
Maybe they'll come back while I'm recording this, but the birds have been coming and going

08:45.760 --> 08:47.760
constantly, getting stuck in the rain.

08:47.760 --> 08:49.760
Oh, there was a lightning flash.

08:49.760 --> 08:51.760
It's quite the day.

08:51.760 --> 08:55.760
Hey, guys, the day is August 5th, though it's the middle of the night, so I think I actually

08:55.760 --> 08:57.760
might be early August 6th at this point.

08:57.760 --> 08:58.760
It's Saturday in any case.

08:58.760 --> 08:59.760
I think it's Saturday.

08:59.760 --> 09:03.760
I've been keeping some pretty late nights, doing a lot of work recently, so I've come

09:03.760 --> 09:06.760
down to the garden, grabbed some kale for dinner.

09:06.760 --> 09:09.760
Got to go into the shed and grab those pink snips also.

09:11.760 --> 09:13.760
Oh, the bird's just hanging out.

09:13.760 --> 09:15.760
I think there's actually a family of them now, you know?

09:15.760 --> 09:20.760
I wonder if he doesn't like the floodlight from the house, keeping him awake, but I think

09:20.760 --> 09:21.760
there's a family of them.

09:21.760 --> 09:25.760
Like, I think there's two adult birds and several children, I think.

09:25.760 --> 09:30.760
In any case, let's go to the shed and get the snips that Naomi makes me use because

09:30.760 --> 09:34.760
she doesn't like it when I bring out outside scissors.

09:34.760 --> 09:37.760
Ah, geez, new lawnmower in the way.

09:37.760 --> 09:39.760
I have too much stuff in here, you know?

09:39.760 --> 09:40.760
Can't even reach them.

09:42.760 --> 09:43.760
Oh, I'm so close.

09:43.760 --> 09:44.760
Wait.

09:45.760 --> 09:48.760
Yeah, there's a square here, if I can just, like...

09:52.760 --> 09:54.760
Oh, bingo.

09:54.760 --> 09:56.760
I might as well show you the place, eh?

09:56.760 --> 09:58.760
Even though it's the middle of the night.

09:58.760 --> 09:59.760
Cucumbers growing up nicely.

09:59.760 --> 10:02.760
I still don't quite know what to do with the beans, but I guess they're okay.

10:02.760 --> 10:04.760
Tomatoes coming along very well.

10:04.760 --> 10:05.760
Peppers as well.

10:05.760 --> 10:08.760
In fact, some of these might actually be good to grab soon.

10:08.760 --> 10:11.760
There's one, I don't know if you can see it with the shadows, but there's one.

10:11.760 --> 10:12.760
I'm pointing at it with my, uh...

10:12.760 --> 10:14.760
I can't see anything with these shadows.

10:14.760 --> 10:15.760
Right there, you see that?

10:15.760 --> 10:18.760
Today is time for...

10:18.760 --> 10:19.760
Frickin' hell.

10:20.760 --> 10:21.760
Yeah.

10:21.760 --> 10:22.760
Dinner time, guys.

10:22.760 --> 10:26.760
You take, like, two or three of these leaves, put them in a sandwich.

10:27.760 --> 10:28.760
It's great.

10:28.760 --> 10:30.760
You know, wash them off, obviously.

10:30.760 --> 10:31.760
Especially if there's birds around.

10:31.760 --> 10:34.760
Stuff your sandwich full of these, you won't go wrong.

10:34.760 --> 10:35.760
There we go.

10:35.760 --> 10:37.760
Good for salads, good for soups, good for sandwiches.

10:37.760 --> 10:40.760
It's a good lettuce replacement, even though it's kind of bitter.

10:40.760 --> 10:41.760
But you know what?

10:41.760 --> 10:42.760
I'll take it.

10:42.760 --> 10:45.760
Man, the back deck's kind of spooky at 2 AM, eh?

10:45.760 --> 10:47.760
Sorry for disturbing you, buddy.

10:47.760 --> 10:50.760
In any case, this will probably be the last garden update, at least until the fall harvest,

10:50.760 --> 10:52.760
because there's not much more to do, eh?

10:52.760 --> 10:56.760
The hail is over, like, all the big disasters of the year seem to have run their course.

10:56.760 --> 11:00.760
Things are definitely set in motion, you know, things are kind of growing on their own.

11:00.760 --> 11:03.760
Not much more to say until we, uh, we see what we get out of this.

11:03.760 --> 11:05.760
Thanks for being here, everyone.

11:05.760 --> 11:07.760
I will see you next time.

11:07.760 --> 11:08.760
Ah, here's mosquitoes.

11:17.760 --> 11:31.760
Thanks for watching.
