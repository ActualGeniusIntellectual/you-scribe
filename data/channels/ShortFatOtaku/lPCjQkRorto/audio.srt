1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,760
So, we're back again to do another watch party. The first time was a moderate success when

2
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:15,860
we did Lord of the Rings, The Rings of Power. Not the show, mind you. Just our having fun

3
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:21,800
with it. We don't even have a name for this series, do we? I just called it Devin Friends

4
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:24,000
Watch Lord of the Rings last time.

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:30,760
Well, now it's Devin Friends. It's called Devin Friends Watch. There you go. Devin Friends

6
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:36,480
Watch. I guess so. I guess so. And then insert title. Yeah. We've got Arch, Lilith, and Kibs

7
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:46,360
here once again. Hello everyone. We're back. We're back. Communism spreads. Communism spreads.

8
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:52,080
We've come back to watch another one and this time it is The Last of Us TV show on HBO.

9
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:58,600
I will say we tried to do this once before, but Kibs. Kibs, what did you do? What do you

10
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:04,240
mean what I do? Well, something killed the last watch party. What was it, Kibs? It wasn't

11
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:11,180
me. You sneak. I don't know what you're talking about. You sneaker. So, the reason that we're

12
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:18,120
doing episodes one and two in one go, and also the reason that we are a week late on

13
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:24,960
episode one. It's Dev's fault. Oh, is it my fault? Yeah. Dev could have told me that

14
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:30,400
the microphone, my XLR cable was busted, but it took too long. So, we had to wait a whole

15
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:38,700
week. Can you believe that? We'll let this one slide, Dev, but next time. Alright, Kibs.

16
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:43,520
Just for that, in post, I'm going to make your avatar a brony again. There's no need

17
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:52,440
to be mean. So, we are, in fact, going to do episodes one and two in one big, long three

18
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:59,440
and a half hour session. This is going to be real fun. I'm sure, I'm sure, actually.

19
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:07,360
You lying sack of shit. So, Arch and Kibs, I was on the Arch cast with you guys, and

20
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:11,240
we talked a whole bunch about The Last of Us, because Arch, you have no idea what this

21
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:15,660
show is or what the game is, right? So, we had to fill you in. We talked about the game?

22
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:20,680
We did, as well. Remember, it's your own show! Where are you? So, Arch, The Last of Us is

23
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:29,360
a console game. Okay. It is, it's trash. I mean, it is trash, yes. And you know what,

24
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:34,400
here, because Arch, you never played it, right? Of course not. And you don't know the, you

25
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:39,080
don't know the, the interest, like the cultural interest surrounding it, right? It's the end

26
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:45,480
of the PS3 360 Wii console era. The PS3 was a powerhouse for the time. Sony wanted a game

27
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:52,240
that could truly show off its power. And that game ended up being The Last of Us. This is

28
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:58,020
at the height of certain trends in gaming. One was the idea of the cinematic experience

29
00:02:58,020 --> 00:03:02,880
game. So, there's lots of, there's lots of cutscenes. There's lots of moments where your

30
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:07,560
character just walks slowly through an environment and talks to another character. You see a

31
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:13,800
lot of that in like, God of War nowadays. And like, Tomb Raider does that as well. But

32
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:19,440
this was, this was kind of the peak of that type of gaming. It's less popular than it

33
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:23,680
was, but you still kind of see it sometimes. So even though the game had a lot of decent

34
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:30,800
combat and decent exploration, decent crafting, decent stealth, the game was clearly focused

35
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:38,720
on a cinematic experience. Second, is that in this period of making video games, and

36
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:47,120
just in general pop culture, there was a common storytelling motif of an older heroic man

37
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:53,740
who teams up with an adoptive daughter figure. And generally the idea is that the older man

38
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:58,760
didn't really have a chance to be a father. And he kind of regrets certain parts of his

39
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:03,780
past. He's older, he's not really in the game anymore. And the adoptive daughter is

40
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:09,880
somebody who never knew what life was like before the apocalypse, because this is always

41
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:15,160
an apocalyptic story. So, older man deals with the fact that the world's gone to shit.

42
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:20,200
Adoptive daughter doesn't even know what he's talking about. And they come to have a bond.

43
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:26,120
And if you'll see that in Telltale's Walking Dead with Lee and Clem, you see that in Logan

44
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:31,920
with Wolverine and whatever that girl's name was in that movie. But basically, this is

45
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:38,820
a very, very popular storytelling motif back in this period. And probably the best example

46
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:46,920
of it in gaming was The Last of Us, the relationship between Joel and Ellie. And this game was

47
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:54,840
basically marketed as the PS3's final triumph. The PS3 was an amazingly popular console.

48
00:04:54,840 --> 00:05:01,520
The PS4 looked to also be similarly amazing. People loved Naughty Dog the developer. And

49
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:05,560
they were basically hitting all the right notes. All the things that were popular in

50
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:09,820
what was it 2012 or whatever it was in this game came out. All the things that were popular

51
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:15,320
this game was doing. So it's less that the game was a high quality game, though it's

52
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:21,220
like reasonably high quality. It's more that everything that was popular was in this game

53
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:28,340
all at once at the peak of its popularity. And that turned it into basically a mini cultural

54
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:31,500
phenomenon within gaming.

55
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:37,060
Sort of. It was a pretty big deal, but it wasn't like on the power of what you had with

56
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:44,380
Halo 3. Because that was like everywhere. That was like the Zenith, that was 2007, where

57
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:49,060
you had gaming where there was like, oh, Mountain Dew can, so you go to fucking Boyger King

58
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:53,580
and they had stuff. It was it was it was the height of PlayStation's sphere, is what

59
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:54,580
I would say.

60
00:05:54,580 --> 00:06:00,940
The Archcast clip can fill that in. But Lilith, what is what is your relationship regarding

61
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:02,100
The Last of Us?

62
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:08,060
I know about the basic gist and the plot. I've always meant to play it, but like I just

63
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:15,540
never got around to it. It's just in my backlog, but it's one of those games that's good things

64
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:22,140
about it. But then I decided that they wanted to do like a remake of the first game that's

65
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:29,260
pretty much completely the same. Which, you know what? Feel free. Print money. Why not?

66
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:33,780
I have watched like the gameplay from start to finish, though, so I do know the story

67
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:39,500
for the first game. I pretty much skipped out on the second one for the most part, aside

68
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:41,920
from just knowing the story.

69
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:46,280
You just real good where the transvestite beats everybody to death at the golf club.

70
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:52,600
Here's the thing. Everyone said that that Abby was trans, but she's not trans. She's

71
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:59,060
a very muscular woman. Everyone is already like hyper aware of just shoehorned representation.

72
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:05,420
And also, Abby is very easy to vilify based on her actions within the context of the story.

73
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:09,920
She's not a well liked character. So I think I think people just like did one plus two

74
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:13,340
and said, this person's trans. And it's like, well, no, she's actually not trans. Here's

75
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:17,080
the thing. When it comes to these sort of shows, right, they almost always seem to end

76
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:21,400
up like trash, these new adaptations, because it happened with Lord of the Rings and it

77
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:26,880
happened with She-Hulk and it happened with the Halo show and it happened with Velma recently.

78
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:32,440
Like how many of these shows come out and are just like garbage piles? And I think people

79
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:36,320
are assuming that it's going to be the same thing with this one. I'm expecting this to

80
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:39,200
be trash. I don't know about you guys.

81
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:45,340
Historically, video games and adaptations hasn't been done too well. But, um, lately

82
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:50,600
seems to people have been breaking the trend. Like Arcane, for example, that was like a

83
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:57,840
really good adaptation from a video game to a show. And I think, what else? There was

84
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:00,860
a few, right? Good video game adaptations.

85
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:04,980
The Super Mario Brothers Movie from 1993.

86
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:09,300
The best video game adaptations are the ones that have nothing to do with the video game.

87
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:15,220
Arcane had nothing to do with League of Legends. Cyberpunk had nothing to do with Cyberpunk.

88
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:16,620
Alright, Cyberpunk.

89
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:21,980
Oh yeah, the little robot loli that Dimitri likes so much.

90
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:28,180
But I wouldn't actually discount this one because a key hallmark for a lot of the really

91
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:34,720
shit adaptations is a really shit cast, because it is usually made as some kind of hobby

92
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:40,840
product by know-nothing retards like the Winx of Power did, where there's just a large roster

93
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:45,180
of people you've never heard of and you have no interest in and that can't act to save

94
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:52,600
their lives. But here, I mean, Pedro Pascal, or Pablo, I'm going to call him frequently.

95
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:53,600
You fucking racist.

96
00:08:53,600 --> 00:09:00,240
Very solid. No, it's because Pablo Schreiber from the Halo TV series, and now he's the

97
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:07,640
guy Pablo. I know now. Gabriel Luna as well. This series actually has some actors who might

98
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:08,640
be able to act.

99
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:14,360
Well, it's already an issue because they've already dismissed like the spores and a bunch

100
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:15,360
of other things.

101
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:19,440
So Arch, the lore of the spores, okay? So there's some, in real life, this is a real

102
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:22,680
life thing, not a Last of Us thing. There's some sort of a fungus that takes over the

103
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:29,980
brain of an ant. And what it does is it makes the ant crawl onto the end of a grass blade

104
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:37,100
so that it can be picked up by a bird. And then the bird eats the ant, and then it gets

105
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:41,420
shit out. And then that's how the spores of this life form spread across the environment.

106
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:44,300
It's based on a real, that's a real play, a real...

107
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:50,220
Yeah, that is a real fungus, yes. And so Amy Hennig, when she was kind of like penning

108
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:56,480
out the initial ideas of the Last of Us, she's like, well, what if we did a zombie story,

109
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:03,560
but we did our own twist on it where it was transmitted through fungal spores. And so

110
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:09,120
you go into these dens of zombies where people are growing into the walls and you're wearing

111
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:14,300
a gas mask and you have to hold your breath if you ever take the mask off, right? Because

112
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:19,120
the air is infected with these spores. And the spores are the primary way that the zombie

113
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:24,160
virus gets around. And basically what happens is the person gets infected by breathing in

114
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:28,520
the spore and then they have like a zombie stage and then they have a very aggressive

115
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:32,680
zombie stage called clickers where they have, where they can't, like their, their eyes have

116
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:37,000
been all grown out and they can't see anymore, but they can echo location. So you have to

117
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:41,280
like stealth through it. And then once in the final stages, they just turn into like

118
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:43,840
a giant mushroom and they just grow into the wall.

119
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:46,520
Yep, and then it's the spores. And then somebody's...

120
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:55,080
Yeah, yeah. So it was basically a different spin on the zombie story, but the fact that

121
00:10:55,080 --> 00:11:00,440
it was fungal spores was a core component of the lore. And so to see spores will not

122
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:04,600
exist in The Last of Us HBO, that literally just makes it a normal zombie story.

123
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:10,720
Yep. They've, they've taken, they've demystified the zombies because like any good zombie setting

124
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:15,400
like Dead Space or like The Last of Us, when it comes to the fungal spores, what that does

125
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:19,920
is it helps drive it apart than your just basic bitches, green zambi, you know, it bites

126
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:24,000
your brains or whatever. Like that's boring. That's old. You got to do something new and

127
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,400
fresh with your zombies.

128
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:30,640
I don't know if I'd really consider that all that new and fucking fresh, but if you say

129
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:31,640
so.

130
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:37,240
What, you don't like stinky mushrooms, you little shit?

131
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:41,460
In terms of gameplay, it wasn't that different aside from like the, the, the, the breath

132
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:45,620
mechanic in some of the levels, but in terms of the lore, it did make it feel fresh for

133
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:47,420
2012 or whatever it was.

134
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:48,420
Yep.

135
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:49,420
Remember in 2012.

136
00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:52,940
Very specific spores. I guess they're not absorbed through the eyes.

137
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:56,340
They had to keep it fresh because by 2012, that was the end.

138
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:57,340
They wear masks, yeah.

139
00:11:57,340 --> 00:12:01,660
Yep. But 2012 was also the end of the zombie craze because Left 4 Dead 2 and all the zombie

140
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:04,320
games started to fall out of circulation.

141
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:09,660
And Walking Dead kind of had its major impact back then. I mean, in World of Warcraft, like

142
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:11,080
Wrath of the Lich King was wrapping up.

143
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:15,300
So the zombie thing had come and gone, and this was like the tail end of it.

144
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:17,420
And so they said, we have to make, if we're going to do a zombie story, you have to do

145
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:18,420
something different.

146
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:21,060
So they did, they did spores rather than like a virus.

147
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:24,900
Yeah, but dismissing console, console stuff is fine.

148
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:27,940
Well, the thing is you have to respect the fandom, Arch.

149
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:29,940
I know, they're consoles.

150
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:33,500
You're about as, you're about as brilliant as they are when it comes to that, if that's

151
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:34,500
your perspective.

152
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:37,980
Oh my God, this is Archer's SJW, Arch.

153
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:38,980
He's rejecting the fandom.

154
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:43,140
He's like, no, it's my fandom now.

155
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:44,740
It's not, I reject it.

156
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:47,420
It's a console fandom.

157
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:50,800
Whatever damage done to it was probably for the better.

158
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:57,020
There is one hallmark that I think hasn't been seen too much yet.

159
00:12:57,020 --> 00:13:03,460
So if you recall, when it came to, um, when it came to the Obi Wan Kenobi show, everyone

160
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:08,840
was, even before the show came out, everyone was talking about all the racist hatred that

161
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:11,380
the actress of Riva was getting, right?

162
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:14,540
When it came to the Lord of the Rings show, everyone was talking about the black elf and

163
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:16,340
his actor and all the racist hatred.

164
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:21,940
Like I haven't seen much of that this time where there's been this performative wokeness

165
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:26,220
in the media before this show launches to try to get it off the ground.

166
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:29,460
Now maybe I just haven't seen the articles yet, but as far as I can tell, that seems

167
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:32,220
to be absent, which is a good sign.

168
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:37,660
They also haven't pulled off operation hide behind the black man, uh, to the same degree

169
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:38,660
in this show.

170
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:45,500
I mean, if, if Pedro Pascal shows up in episode one now wearing blackface, I'll retract that

171
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:50,580
statement, but hide behind the Mexican just doesn't have quite the same effect.

172
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:52,940
Well in this case, they wouldn't be hiding behind the Mexican.

173
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:56,020
They'd have to hide behind his daughter because I think they race swapped her.

174
00:13:56,020 --> 00:13:57,260
Yeah, we'll have to see though.

175
00:13:57,260 --> 00:13:58,260
We'll have to see.

176
00:13:58,260 --> 00:14:00,780
So hide behind the child.

177
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:04,620
Because the daughter, the little woman, oh, okay.

178
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:06,980
Well you can't hide behind the corpse then.

179
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:07,980
You dumbass.

180
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:08,980
It's 10 years old.

181
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:09,980
Okay.

182
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:10,980
Pulls up the little corpse.

183
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:11,980
It flops in the wind.

184
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:12,980
I can't.

185
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:13,980
Don't attack us.

186
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:19,300
Like if this child ends up being on screen for like 10 minutes, that was, you just can't

187
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:20,300
slap him now.

188
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:22,660
Yeah, probably going to be less than 10 minutes.

189
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:23,660
She should die pretty quickly.

190
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:26,460
You can't hide behind the side character, Jesus.

191
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:27,960
It would be funny if they tried.

192
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:36,000
So I guess it's time for us to watch the premiere of The Last of Us, another watch party series

193
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
begins.

194
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
It's going to be awesome.

195
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
All right.

196
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Let's rock and roll.

197
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,280
Let's prep up good old VLC because there's no way in hell I'm paying for HBO.

198
00:14:44,280 --> 00:15:01,800
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah.

199
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:02,800
I'm a baller.

200
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:03,800
Yes.

201
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:07,600
And we end up with a global pandemic pan, meaning all the whole world becomes sickle

202
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,600
at once.

203
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:13,600
We call it COVID.

204
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,600
No, no, no.

205
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:16,600
All right.

206
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:17,600
Well, that's our show.

207
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,680
Hey, that's that dude from the other television show.

208
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:20,680
That's kind of famous.

209
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:25,800
I don't like that guy because he used to own slaves, but in the end, what, what would you

210
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:31,360
just to be clear, you, you do think microorganisms, different show, don't you recognize him?

211
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:32,360
Kind of bacteria?

212
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:33,360
No.

213
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:34,360
You like saying no.

214
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:35,360
Yes.

215
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:38,040
He's funny.

216
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:44,800
It's dominance from Spartacus because there are some fungi who seek not to kill, but to

217
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:45,800
control.

218
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:46,800
Let me ask you.

219
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:47,800
Oh God.

220
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:48,800
They're actually going to explain that part.

221
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:54,440
You get it from, I thought that was supposed to be implied fungus psilocybin also fungus.

222
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:55,440
This is all new to the show.

223
00:15:55,440 --> 00:16:01,080
This isn't wasn't in the game at all because I thought this was supposed to be a little

224
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:05,900
bit of the secret that it did that whole, you know, brain control, zombie fungus thing.

225
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:08,660
This is more of a show, don't tell policy.

226
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:11,420
This is just exposition, which is not good storytelling.

227
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:17,340
This is, Hey, you don't know anything about this console communist universe of fungus

228
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:24,660
and by the way, global warming, Cordyceps, Astragalus, anyone in the game already did

229
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:33,020
the mystery angles and taking control of millions of yeah, I've seen like similar approach to

230
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:35,660
like the new triathlon series.

231
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:43,980
So if that happens, we lose.

232
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:45,700
And that's why you should wear your masks.

233
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:47,820
Oh, it's not entirely true.

234
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:50,780
I was like, there are treatments for fungal infections.

235
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:54,220
It's not literally impossible, but details, details.

236
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:55,220
That's not convenient.

237
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:56,220
It doesn't sound scary.

238
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:59,980
Arch, you know, I don't like, is it game of Thrones again?

239
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:00,980
It is.

240
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:06,820
Oh God, I wish people would stop making this fucking intro.

241
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:14,940
This is creatively bankrupt, but yeah, you know, I'll give it one point, one point because

242
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:22,940
I really enjoy the fact that they're using the original song for my diverse craft of

243
00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:28,140
creators who never played the video games if they want to go into the fungal and how

244
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:31,620
big of a threat it is airborne.

245
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:36,020
You can see the particles in the air like that is the bits of the fungus.

246
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:37,020
That's not good.

247
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:39,700
Oh, look, the fungus turned into the two main characters.

248
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:41,020
Wasn't that clever?

249
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:48,100
No, not really, but I mean, it was a shot.

250
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:49,500
It's like baby's first intro.

251
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:51,540
It's like, Ooh, it's deep and symbolic.

252
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:52,540
It's like, no.

253
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:53,540
That was three.

254
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:55,860
Oh, that was a good year.

255
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:56,860
Yeah.

256
00:17:56,860 --> 00:17:59,180
Before the bad things started to happen.

257
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:02,060
You think it's good here because the Iraq invasion, don't you?

258
00:18:02,060 --> 00:18:03,060
Yep.

259
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:05,940
Iraq invasion and Pokemon Ruby and Sapphire, baby.

260
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:08,900
Hell yeah, brother.

261
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:09,900
Everyone was concerned.

262
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:12,300
Like, Oh my God, it's going to be a big war.

263
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:14,420
He's going to deploy that chemical weapons.

264
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:18,900
He didn't have any, but they black washed his daughter.

265
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:19,900
Yeah.

266
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:20,960
Did I?

267
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,980
His daughter was like a blonde girl.

268
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:25,740
Well, now she's a black girl.

269
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:27,780
I guess, I guess the dad liked racism.

270
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:28,780
Okay.

271
00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:29,780
Right.

272
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:32,780
I know this is going to hit somebody here personal, but anyone who makes eggs like these

273
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:35,580
need to be taken outside and put out of their fucking misery.

274
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:36,580
Hold on.

275
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:39,820
Didn't Lilith just make eggs like those before the show started?

276
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:40,820
Exactly.

277
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:41,820
What's that?

278
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:45,820
I lit it with a cold fire.

279
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:46,820
Yeah man.

280
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:48,740
I also, I like simple eggs too.

281
00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:49,740
They're just like easy.

282
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:53,340
The black girl has a watermelon in her fridge.

283
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:54,340
Oh my God.

284
00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:55,340
Oh my God.

285
00:18:55,940 --> 00:18:58,220
That's a lot of placement.

286
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:00,500
Would you like some purple drink?

287
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:01,500
It's orange.

288
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:02,500
It's orange.

289
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:09,900
Lilith, Lilith, let's hope that none of your more left-leaning friends see this or else

290
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:10,900
you'll be instantly canceled.

291
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:15,900
How does that get destroyed for being in the same presence?

292
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:18,460
Oh God, I remember this song.

293
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:22,440
This song was on the radio every single second of every single day, back in the good old

294
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:23,440
days.

295
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:24,440
He's dependent on me.

296
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:25,540
It's not the same.

297
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:27,540
The outbreak better happen at night or I'll be mad.

298
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:29,540
I thought he was having pancakes.

299
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:31,540
He thought he was having fucking pancakes.

300
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:33,540
The concrete guy is going to be there?

301
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:34,540
Let me stick that some Tabasco.

302
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:35,540
He can't frame until we pull.

303
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:37,540
I had to give the actor some credit though.

304
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:39,540
He actually does look a bit like Joel.

305
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:40,540
I'm not splitting his job.

306
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:41,540
A little bit.

307
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:42,540
Yeah.

308
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:43,540
Okay.

309
00:19:43,540 --> 00:19:45,860
See, I kind of hate this introductionary scene.

310
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:46,860
Not that it's bad.

311
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:47,860
Like this is actually all right.

312
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:50,100
They're having a decent little conversation et cetera, but the zombie apocalypse is about

313
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:51,960
to hit in like five seconds, right?

314
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:53,980
And so they're like, Hey, care about these characters.

315
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:55,520
They're all going to fucking die.

316
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:56,520
Why?

317
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:59,520
Barge, you have to at least put in the effort of caring.

318
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:01,520
Barge don't want to.

319
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:02,520
Barge don't want to.

320
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:05,520
The little black girl who eats watermelon is smart.

321
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:08,520
Barge, calm down.

322
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:12,520
Sometimes I have to create my own entertainment, okay?

323
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:14,520
We can rip on it in time.

324
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:16,520
Page to page.

325
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:20,520
I mean, this is an intro that is similar to the one in the first game, but the one in

326
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:22,520
the first game happened in the middle of the night.

327
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:24,060
Very quick.

328
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:29,060
Listen, we need to build value for these characters so that when this child is eaten to death,

329
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:30,060
we feel bad.

330
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:33,060
Gosh darn it, Barge.

331
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:35,060
If she gets eaten to death, I'll be surprised.

332
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:36,060
Good.

333
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:37,060
Oh my God.

334
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:38,060
Just because she's brown though.

335
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:39,060
Come on.

336
00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:41,060
Just because she's black, she likes watermelon and stealing things.

337
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:42,060
I know.

338
00:20:42,060 --> 00:20:43,060
It's weird.

339
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:44,060
Show, stop.

340
00:20:44,060 --> 00:20:45,060
Please.

341
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:46,060
Show, don't do this.

342
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:49,060
Show's like, I'm going to be racist.

343
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:52,600
I could come by after school, but just for like a little bit.

344
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:53,600
Look, zombies.

345
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:54,600
She'll take what you got.

346
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:56,600
Dad, you love biscuits.

347
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:00,600
Jesus Christ.

348
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:01,600
You are fond of biscuits.

349
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:02,600
I do.

350
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:03,600
But I'm on Atkins.

351
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:04,600
What now?

352
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:05,600
It's, uh, you know what?

353
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:08,600
We got to run, but Sarah will be by later.

354
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:10,600
She'll stay as long as you want.

355
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:12,600
Tell you all about Atkins.

356
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:14,600
I'm going to stay alive for this.

357
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:16,600
Dad, why are you making me stay with the white people?

358
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:20,140
I don't like the white ones, daddy.

359
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:23,140
They don't look like me.

360
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:25,140
Operation Desert Storm.

361
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:28,140
Oh my God, it's the best bush.

362
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:35,140
You won't use any of this shit.

363
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:37,140
You won't use any of this shit in later life.

364
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:39,140
You're going to have a smartphone on you.

365
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:41,140
You're not going to be calculating anything.

366
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:45,140
God, so many teachers told me,

367
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:47,680
you're not going to have a calculator on you all the time.

368
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:49,680
It's like, yes, I fucking will.

369
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:50,680
The phones.

370
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:52,680
The invention of phones.

371
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:54,680
Yeah, but what if a giant mushroom apocalypse comes deaf?

372
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:56,680
Good point, Lilith.

373
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:57,680
Yeah, deaf.

374
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:58,680
Stupid deaf.

375
00:21:58,680 --> 00:21:59,680
Stupid.

376
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:03,680
You know, if the mushroom apocalypse came in 2003,

377
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:06,680
we'd be spared so much fucking bullshit.

378
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:08,680
Oh, the world would be a better place.

379
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:10,680
I don't know about that.

380
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:12,680
Listen, you wouldn't have to deal with

381
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:14,680
female space marines.

382
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:17,220
I'd rather deal with female space marines

383
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:19,220
than figure out where to get food from.

384
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:21,220
At least female space marines are profitable.

385
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:23,220
Very true.

386
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:27,220
Music.

387
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:29,220
That's it?

388
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:31,220
Did you steal your dad's watch?

389
00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:33,220
She stole her dad's money to get her dad a present?

390
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:34,220
God.

391
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:36,220
Kyle, you were wrong.

392
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:38,220
She's not just a thief because she's black.

393
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:40,220
She's actually kind and caring.

394
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:42,220
She's a kind thief.

395
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:44,220
Kyle.

396
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:46,760
You're allowed to interpret that.

397
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:48,760
I've been cancelled.

398
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:50,760
In the original game,

399
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:52,760
didn't she buy a new watch for Joel?

400
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:54,760
She did.

401
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:56,760
I hate their language.

402
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:58,760
I'm sorry.

403
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:00,760
It doesn't make me racist.

404
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:02,760
I just don't like any language

405
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:04,760
that pronounces the...

406
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:06,760
You should go home.

407
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:08,760
I don't know, something's going on.

408
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:10,760
I wonder what.

409
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:12,760
Maybe it's fire or something.

410
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:14,800
The outbreak's gonna happen at night, I assume.

411
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:16,800
Because we're seeing a little bit more

412
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:18,800
before the video game starts.

413
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:21,800
Yeah, we're seeing what leads up to it.

414
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:24,800
Why half those children in the background are eating?

415
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:26,800
There was just a lot of police and stuff on the road today.

416
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:28,800
Well, that's true every day, isn't it?

417
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:30,800
That's American.

418
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:32,800
It's a hellhole.

419
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:35,800
Three nails plus one cross equals four given.

420
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:37,800
Ha ha ha.

421
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:39,800
Jesus.

422
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:41,800
Chocolate chip?

423
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:43,840
Alright, she needs to burn.

424
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:45,840
Yep.

425
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:47,840
She should get bit first for raisin cookies.

426
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:49,840
Seriously, though.

427
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:51,840
She better die.

428
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:53,840
Just put the mushrooms into the cookie.

429
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:55,840
Is the old lady gonna turn into a zombie?

430
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:57,840
TV show, I get what you're doing,

431
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:59,840
but this isn't really your story.

432
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:01,840
Please just get to the zombies.

433
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,840
It's a TV show.

434
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:05,840
It's the establishing episode.

435
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:07,840
Come on, Barge.

436
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:09,840
I understand, but

437
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:11,880
even I know what this story is.

438
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:13,880
Oh god, that's before Blu-ray.

439
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:15,880
They're all low definition.

440
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:23,880
Look, she's turning.

441
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:25,880
Ah, shit.

442
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:27,880
She is.

443
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:29,880
I like how this house

444
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:31,880
is more like 1950s than

445
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:33,880
2003.

446
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:35,880
Oh, Jesus, she is.

447
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:37,880
Oh, that's fucking...

448
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:39,920
I should go.

449
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:41,920
Yeah.

450
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:43,920
You're gonna die with your raisin cookies, bitch.

451
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:45,920
Ha ha ha.

452
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:47,920
She is.

453
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:49,920
Like, as soon as she leaves, I guarantee you they're gonna have

454
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:51,920
a shot of her getting attacked and, like, they don't even notice.

455
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:53,920
Look, the wheelchair

456
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:55,920
is empty.

457
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:57,920
Aw, no?

458
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:59,920
She was just yawning. It's okay.

459
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:01,920
Look, the dog is

460
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:03,920
being sus.

461
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:05,920
Yeah, the dog knows something's up.

462
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:07,960
This is an airborne infection. Why isn't the little

463
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:09,960
black girl starting to eat brains right about now?

464
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:11,960
Uh, the spores...

465
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:13,960
The spores die in direct

466
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:15,960
sunlight.

467
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:17,960
Yeah, but she was inside a second ago.

468
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:19,960
There was sun coming through the windows.

469
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:21,960
It also depends on, again, where the granny got

470
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:23,960
the spores. Yeah, how long it's been.

471
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:25,960
There's a bunch of factors.

472
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:27,960
Yeah, but she didn't strike me like the kind

473
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:29,960
who would be out and about on the regular.

474
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:31,960
The spores take a couple hours

475
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:33,960
to set in.

476
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
There you go, man. You gotta plant them.

477
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
It's me. Water them.

478
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
There's a plant.

479
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Fertilize.

480
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
We're at night time.

481
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
It looks more like day for night, but still.

482
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
Good job.

483
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
You know what the show's gonna do.

484
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
Yep. Yep, here we go.

485
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
Yeah, this is the coach scene. The infamous coach

486
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
scene from the start of the game.

487
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
They gave us the wrong side.

488
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
To be fair, I would rather the

489
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
show be too bright and too dark.

490
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:04,040
True. Remember Game of Thrones?

491
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:06,040
We couldn't see shit.

492
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:08,040
Where'd you get the money for this?

493
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:10,040
Drugs. I sell hardcore

494
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:12,040
drugs. It's better when I do.

495
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:14,040
It was only $20, which I stole

496
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:16,040
from you. I could have

497
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:18,040
stolen $60, but I put the change back

498
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:20,040
because I'm an honest thief. Besides,

499
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:22,040
it's the thought that counts. Well, at least

500
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:24,040
you missed.

501
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:26,040
See, Connor, you were wrong about her. She's a lovely little girl.

502
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:28,040
How did the show end?

503
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:30,040
In the game, she actually

504
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:32,080
paid for it herself, and

505
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:34,080
she had the same joke, hardcore drugs,

506
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:36,080
but then he just said, where'd you get the money

507
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:38,080
for this? Drugs.

508
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:40,080
I sell hardcore drugs. Oh, good.

509
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:42,080
You can start helping out with the mortgage then.

510
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:44,080
Yeah, you wish.

511
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:46,080
Great, you can start paying off the mortgage.

512
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:48,080
It was a better scene.

513
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:50,080
It's not nearly

514
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:52,080
as good. No.

515
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:54,080
But if she's poor, we'll feel worse about her.

516
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:56,080
Maybe.

517
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:58,080
It's somewhat

518
00:26:58,120 --> 00:27:00,120
it's more accurate than the Halo TV show

519
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:02,120
so far. Oh, god, the Halo

520
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:04,120
TV show.

521
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:06,120
And this Pablo's nose is much smaller.

522
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:08,120
I still kind of want to go back and watch that

523
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:10,120
because it was such a train wreck.

524
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:14,120
Wait, that can be our next watch party,

525
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:16,120
guys.

526
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:18,120
I don't feel sick.

527
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:20,120
Well, they're following the major story beats.

528
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:22,120
So far.

529
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:26,120
Jumpscare.

530
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:30,120
Nope,

531
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:32,120
just explosions.

532
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:36,120
Fireworks and it's green.

533
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:38,120
No,

534
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:40,120
the Borg have showed up.

535
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:42,120
On this

536
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:44,120
average evening in the U.S.

537
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:50,120
The feds are finally coming for your

538
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:52,120
guns.

539
00:27:58,120 --> 00:28:00,120
It's been awful

540
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:02,120
protect.

541
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:04,120
It sounds like

542
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:06,120
your family's fun.

543
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:08,120
Mercy.

544
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:10,120
In those

545
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:16,120
they're kind of cute

546
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:18,120
because they look like bananas with lovely bits.

547
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:20,120
Don't want to go home.

548
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:22,120
Granny ate

549
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:24,120
other granny.

550
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:26,120
I don't want those cookies.

551
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:28,160
Mercy.

552
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:30,160
That was not attached well.

553
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:32,160
Now this is all gone completely

554
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:34,160
off script from the game though right now.

555
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:36,160
Yeah, yeah, it is because

556
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:38,160
Joel's supposed to wake her up.

557
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:40,160
Look, the wheelchair

558
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:42,160
is empty now.

559
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:44,160
Look, there's light coming through the window like

560
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:46,160
it's daytime.

561
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:48,160
Listen,

562
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:50,160
after Games of Thrones, better to lighten

563
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:52,160
through dark again.

564
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:54,160
I still wouldn't be walking in here, to be honest.

565
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:56,200
This is so

566
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:58,200
coward.

567
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:00,200
This is so unrealistic behavior.

568
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:02,200
Oh.

569
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:04,200
See, this is the point

570
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:06,200
at which I'd be like, no,

571
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:08,200
I'm leaving. It's time to go back home.

572
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:10,200
I

573
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:12,200
done all I could. Time to leave.

574
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:18,200
Well, that's mildly

575
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:20,200
disturbing.

576
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:22,200
Looks like bean

577
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:24,240
sprouts in her mouth.

578
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:33,240
Yeah, to be fair,

579
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:35,240
being that old and a zombie

580
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:37,240
is not a good combo.

581
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:49,240
Now there's the actions of a

582
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:51,240
seasoned wife beater.

583
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:53,240
Wait, you should go back

584
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:55,240
into your house and get your weapons because

585
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:57,240
you're a soldier. Surely you still have your rifle.

586
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:09,240
Oh no.

587
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:11,240
And they're going to get eaten.

588
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:13,240
Fuck.

589
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:15,240
Because they want to go help.

590
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:17,240
So to be fair,

591
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:19,240
this part of the show is exactly like

592
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:21,240
the game.

593
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:23,240
Yep, now we're back on track.

594
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:27,240
Don't move to the cities,

595
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:29,240
guys.

596
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:31,240
Yep, it's the first place that will go in a

597
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:33,240
fungus apocalypse.

598
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:37,240
Well, at least Jimmy doesn't have to worry

599
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:39,240
about the electricity prices anymore.

600
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:41,240
Yeah,

601
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:43,240
yeah, from the game,

602
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:45,240
exactly.

603
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:47,240
Now we're back on track.

604
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:49,240
From the point of the game, you play as the girl.

605
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:51,240
You can crawl around the back seat and see the entire

606
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:53,240
scene 360 degrees.

607
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:55,240
It was kind of cool, yeah.

608
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:57,240
Yeah, it was pretty cool for the time.

609
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:09,240
We're not getting there.

610
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:11,240
Yeah, that is a smorgasbord.

611
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:13,240
This is why

612
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:15,240
everybody needs to read the

613
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:17,240
zombie survival guide, so you don't make

614
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:19,240
these silly mistakes when the zombie

615
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:21,240
apocalypse hits.

616
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:23,240
This is actually really good.

617
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:25,240
I'm pleasantly surprised.

618
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:27,240
It's actually not

619
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:29,240
terrible.

620
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:31,240
Yet.

621
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:33,240
Keyboard.

622
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:35,240
I quite appreciated the first person shots they did.

623
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:37,240
That was nice. Very video gaming.

624
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:39,240
Uh.

625
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:51,240
I don't remember that.

626
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:53,240
Grab something.

627
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:55,240
Every apocalypse movie

628
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:57,240
has to have the scene where the jumbo jet

629
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:59,240
goes meow.

630
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:01,240
Alright, now I

631
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:03,240
know.

632
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:05,240
I'm surprised that they have like

633
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:07,240
all the buildings the same, too.

634
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:09,240
Yeah, they make a good town.

635
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:11,240
Yeah.

636
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:13,240
Wow.

637
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:15,240
I really enjoy

638
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:17,240
the first person shots, honestly.

639
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:19,240
They're really chaotic and weird.

640
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:21,240
They feel

641
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:23,240
non-cinematic, which is good.

642
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:25,240
It gets me more in the spirit of the video

643
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:27,240
game style of it.

644
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:29,240
Quite nice.

645
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:31,240
Somebody's gonna jump on the fender.

646
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:37,240
That

647
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:39,240
jumbo jet is going to have a hard time

648
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:41,240
pulling off that maneuver.

649
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:43,240
I think it's sawing.

650
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:45,240
Yeah.

651
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:47,240
Move.

652
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:49,240
Move.

653
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:51,240
Wow.

654
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:53,240
Oh, shit.

655
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:59,240
Actually, rather than explode, I'm pretty sure

656
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:01,240
the cockpit and pooches of the plane would be barreling

657
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:03,240
down the street at this point, but

658
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:05,240
fair enough.

659
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:07,240
Listen, it was filled entirely with explosives.

660
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:09,240
But I wish they would have just skipped

661
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:11,240
to this right off the bat and just

662
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:13,240
kind of clover-field it, you know?

663
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:15,240
Don't explain what's gonna happen, just

664
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:17,240
boom, something awful is happening.

665
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:19,240
Panic, panic, panic, panic. What the fuck?

666
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:21,240
Yeah, the prologue kind of sucked on us.

667
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:23,240
They might have actually been better served just

668
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:25,240
barricading themselves in the house.

669
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:27,240
No shit.

670
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:29,240
You don't say.

671
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:31,240
Considering they drove into town,

672
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:33,240
into the shit-show.

673
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:35,240
Yeah, in the game

674
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:37,240
at the very least,

675
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:39,240
a zombie came

676
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:41,240
through, or at

677
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:43,240
least the series would call it clicker

678
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:45,240
with the window,

679
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:47,240
so they couldn't barricade it.

680
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:49,240
Yeah.

681
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:51,240
You should have closed that door.

682
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:53,240
His hands are sort of on the ground.

683
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:55,240
Jesus, that guy's just jumping.

684
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:57,240
That stunt man is pulling out all the

685
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:59,240
stops, good on him.

686
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:01,240
It's giving an unbelievable

687
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:03,240
performance.

688
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:05,240
My dude, that was a fucking

689
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:07,240
exquisite shot.

690
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:09,240
Don't move.

691
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:11,240
Yes, sir.

692
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:13,240
That's not a good sign.

693
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:15,240
He's gonna let him go, though.

694
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:17,240
He's a good person.

695
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:19,240
He's gonna let him go, though.

696
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:21,240
He's a good person.

697
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:23,240
He's gonna let him go, though.

698
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:25,240
Sir,

699
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:27,240
we are not

700
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:29,240
sick!

701
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:31,240
Really?

702
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:33,240
Aw, that's kind of cruel.

703
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:35,240
They made the soldier

704
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:37,240
a lot more mean in this version.

705
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:39,240
He was like regretting it in the game.

706
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:41,240
He was hesitating a lot more.

707
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:43,240
I'm sorry.

708
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:45,240
Oh, there we go.

709
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:47,240
Though, I will

710
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:49,240
say, okay, so, he

711
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:51,240
single shot,

712
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:53,240
fuck nails, a zombie,

713
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:55,240
running, tilt, from

714
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:57,240
the side,

715
00:34:57,240 --> 00:34:59,240
missing the civilians.

716
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:01,240
But he fucks up a burst at point

717
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:03,240
of blank range. He didn't fuck it up,

718
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:05,240
March.

719
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:07,240
He scored a good couple

720
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:09,240
hits.

721
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:11,240
You're okay. You're okay. Move your hand, baby.

722
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:13,240
Those are 5-5-6's.

723
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:15,240
Paolo should be hit, too.

724
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:17,240
I don't think she's gonna be okay.

725
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:19,240
Come on, baby.

726
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:21,240
Is she gone?

727
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:23,240
Come on, please.

728
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:25,240
Is she gonzo?

729
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:27,240
You know,

730
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:29,240
again, I am actually pleasantly

731
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:31,240
surprised so far. Again, I actually

732
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:33,240
would have preferred to skip the fucking

733
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:35,240
preamble. But this is

734
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:37,240
nice, okay?

735
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:39,240
I, too, I'm thinking like, oh, surely

736
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:41,240
he's gonna let them go, right?

737
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:43,240
I don't know what you're about to say, Dev.

738
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:45,240
Arch-C's dying black child.

739
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:47,240
This is nice.

740
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:49,240
You know, I kind of appreciate that.

741
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:51,240
This just reminds me of

742
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:53,240
the good old days.

743
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:55,240
So that was shot for shot exactly the

744
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:57,240
scene from the game.

745
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:59,240
It was very nice. Because I was thinking like, okay,

746
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:01,240
surely the soldier's gonna be like, I can't just kill

747
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:03,240
a fucking dude and his child.

748
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:05,240
Because that would be the normal response.

749
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:07,240
But no, he puts them down.

750
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:09,240
That puts some stakes in it, because that means that

751
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:11,240
the disease is that bad.

752
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:13,240
Granted, I don't think a single soldier would be

753
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:15,240
wandering around unaccompanied in the middle of a zombie

754
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:17,240
pop news, but details, details.

755
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:19,240
No, I don't even know what this is.

756
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:21,240
Ah, no.

757
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:23,240
This is a child who's

758
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:25,240
outside, probably being

759
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:27,240
more fungi than human.

760
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:31,240
Isn't this Ellie?

761
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:33,240
Uh, that looks like a boy?

762
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:39,240
Kyle, we don't do the whole gender

763
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:41,240
thing anymore. Hey, wait, this actually is

764
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:43,240
Boston 2023.

765
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:45,240
Damn, shot for shot, Dev. I see what you mean.

766
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:47,240
Mm, pretty accurate.

767
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:49,240
Don't worry, kid.

768
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:51,240
You're in Boston now. Wakes up.

769
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:53,240
Nooo.

770
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:55,240
You can't leave.

771
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:57,240
You know, they never really, I don't remember what they say

772
00:36:57,240 --> 00:36:59,240
happens in the lore as time goes on,

773
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:01,240
but like, they're not government holdouts.

774
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:03,240
Just not very many.

775
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:05,240
Yeah, like, each city has a

776
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:07,240
US government contingent that are there.

777
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:09,240
And they kind of

778
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:11,240
they're run by the Department of Health?

779
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:13,240
It wouldn't be run by the Department of Health.

780
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:15,240
I think it's because of the whole

781
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:17,240
the whole virus part of it.

782
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:19,240
That's why they're in charge.

783
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:21,240
But it wouldn't.

784
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:23,240
The US Army actually has contingency plans

785
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:25,240
for this shit.

786
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:27,240
For a zombie apocalypse?

787
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:29,240
Yep. To be honest, I've heard

788
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:31,240
that, like, if an actual zombie apocalypse

789
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:33,240
happened, it would be reasonably easy to

790
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:35,240
contain, all things considered.

791
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:37,240
Then again,

792
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:39,240
Then again with COVID, we haven't really

793
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:41,240
we haven't really contained that.

794
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:43,240
The problem would be the hesitation surrounding

795
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:45,240
it. Figuring out what exactly is happening

796
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:47,240
and the inertia of going like, yep, nope,

797
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:49,240
actually, they're zombies.

798
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:51,240
How well they handle it probably depends on what sort of zombies.

799
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:53,240
But like, yeah.

800
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:55,240
It is pretty funny that

801
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:57,240
the actual US military has

802
00:37:57,240 --> 00:37:59,240
a disease for a zombie apocalypse.

803
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:01,240
Who knows?

804
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:03,240
I don't like where this is going.

805
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:05,240
Toys?

806
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:07,240
It was red.

807
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:09,240
It was red.

808
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:11,240
So she's infected.

809
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:13,240
Yep, that needle there.

810
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:15,240
That's medicine.

811
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:17,240
And now you're gonna die.

812
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:19,240
Yep.

813
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:21,240
To be fair, this is a very nice way of doing it.

814
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:23,240
Like, give her hope, like, everything's fine now,

815
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:25,240
it's gonna be great, then she pulls sleep.

816
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:27,240
Yep.

817
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:29,240
Thing is, she was infected.

818
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:31,240
Yeah, they didn't have a choice.

819
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:33,240
Yep.

820
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:35,240
But that way she went down

821
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:37,240
and, you know, she had happy thoughts.

822
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:39,240
Yeah. As sickening and sad as that is.

823
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:41,240
No, no, that is exactly what you should do.

824
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:43,240
Like, you can't save her, okay, make the best out of it.

825
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:45,240
Is this, is this

826
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:47,240
Joel's girlfriend?

827
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:49,240
Yeah.

828
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:51,240
Very ugly looking, if that's her.

829
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:53,240
Well, here's the thing.

830
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:55,240
This is actually the voice actor, actress

831
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:57,240
who played Tess in the game.

832
00:38:57,240 --> 00:38:59,240
They got the same person back.

833
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:01,240
Probably should have got somebody of the appropriate age

834
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:03,240
to do, but yeah, I do appreciate the mantra.

835
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:05,240
It has, it has been ten years

836
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:07,240
since the game, yeah.

837
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:09,240
Yes. I'm surprised this isn't a train wreck

838
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:11,240
so far.

839
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:15,240
There's the kid.

840
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:19,240
Uh-huh.

841
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:21,240
You know, in the

842
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:23,240
post-apocalypse, that's a lot of valuable

843
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:25,240
materials you're throwing away there.

844
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:27,240
Yeah, the shirt and the, yeah,

845
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:29,240
all the stuff.

846
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:31,240
But the shirt's probably like

847
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:33,240
Oh, infected? Yeah, yeah.

848
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:35,240
Spores on the shirt.

849
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:37,240
If there were spores on the shirt, then all of these workers

850
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:39,240
are infected now too.

851
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:41,240
Yeah, that's true. I mean, to be fair,

852
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:43,240
she was put down before the

853
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:45,240
spores could start, you know, coming out of her.

854
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:47,240
Arch, Arch, don't question

855
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:49,240
the efficacy of the masks, okay?

856
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:51,240
That gets you kicked off

857
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:53,240
YouTube.

858
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:55,240
He's got peppered,

859
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:57,240
grey peppered hair.

860
00:39:57,240 --> 00:39:59,240
If he was 36 before,

861
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:01,240
he should be 50.

862
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:03,240
56?

863
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:05,240
Oh, the firefly symbol.

864
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:07,240
I wonder if they'll ruin the firefly people.

865
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:09,240
They'll make them communist or something.

866
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:11,240
Since they're rebelling against the government.

867
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:17,240
I don't want to spoil for Arch.

868
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:19,240
But you can never leave.

869
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:21,240
Uh, pause it for a second.

870
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:23,240
Okay, sure.

871
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:25,240
I like how I just tried to pause it.

872
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:27,240
I don't think I can upload

873
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:29,240
this file to something that would actually

874
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:31,240
work on watch together.

875
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:33,240
What's wrong, Barch? Barch?

876
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:35,240
It's surprisingly good.

877
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:37,240
What do you think, Lilith?

878
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:39,240
I feel like what they added was enough that they

879
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:41,240
it keeps things fresh because

880
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:43,240
if it's just like a four shot for shot remake

881
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:45,240
of the game, then

882
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:47,240
it's played a game.

883
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:49,240
It does need to be a little different, true.

884
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:51,240
And I can get why they

885
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:53,240
explain the fungal infection

886
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:55,240
if it's just the viewers who aren't familiar

887
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:57,240
with the game or the lore.

888
00:40:57,240 --> 00:40:59,240
That way people aren't just going to be like

889
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:01,240
oh wow, this is just like another

890
00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:03,240
this is just like The Walking Dead

891
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:05,240
duh duh duh

892
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:07,240
Yeah, this was like uh

893
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:09,240
I can see the reason why they did that.

894
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:11,240
Hit that play button, Dev.

895
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:13,240
Let's go.

896
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:15,240
My play button's almost in the mail.

897
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:17,240
Hope I get it.

898
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:19,240
I don't know if you deserve it.

899
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:21,240
Why is every Mexican

900
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:23,240
drug dealer, Dev?

901
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:31,240
Communists.

902
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:33,240
Fucking communists.

903
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:35,240
Ruin everything.

904
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:39,240
I don't think she means that.

905
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:41,240
I think this setup

906
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:53,240
Wow.

907
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:55,240
That's different from the game.

908
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:57,240
Yeah.

909
00:41:57,240 --> 00:41:59,240
Communists, more like bomb-unists.

910
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:03,240
Dev, seppuku, no.

911
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:05,240
I knew that would get you.

912
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:11,240
They don't care.

913
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:13,240
Like you could be.

914
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:15,240
They don't know.

915
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:17,240
Is that the...

916
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:19,240
Does she have

917
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:21,240
alcohol fetal syndrome?

918
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:23,240
Cause her face looks fucked.

919
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:25,240
How did they find

920
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:27,240
so many weird looking

921
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:29,240
female characters?

922
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:31,240
We went from Ellen Page.

923
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:33,240
What's wrong with her forehead?

924
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:35,240
It's huge.

925
00:42:35,240 --> 00:42:37,240
You just landed a plane on it.

926
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:39,240
Her nose.

927
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:41,240
Dude, fuck.

928
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:43,240
That forehead's huge.

929
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:45,240
Kibs, give me your best Plinkett impression.

930
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:47,240
Like the size

931
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:49,240
of Russia is how big

932
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:51,240
her forehead is to the rest of us.

933
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:53,240
It's just a huge endless landscape.

934
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:55,240
Wow, she's giving the Roman salute.

935
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:57,240
That escalates it quick.

936
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:03,240
Hydra?

937
00:43:05,240 --> 00:43:07,240
She has none of the charm.

938
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:11,240
Wow, I hate her already.

939
00:43:11,240 --> 00:43:13,240
Why do you like this character?

940
00:43:13,240 --> 00:43:15,240
She doesn't seem to have any of the charm

941
00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:17,240
that Ellie had.

942
00:43:17,240 --> 00:43:19,240
She's supposed to be charming?

943
00:43:19,240 --> 00:43:21,240
She's got a big forehead, alien looking eyes.

944
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:23,240
Jesus.

945
00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:25,240
She just delivered them

946
00:43:25,240 --> 00:43:27,240
so not Ellie-like.

947
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:29,240
Wow, he's being sneaky.

948
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:31,240
Yeah, that's right.

949
00:43:31,240 --> 00:43:33,240
Regular people can't leave the quarantine zone.

950
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:35,240
Can they?

951
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:37,240
Those get shot.

952
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:39,240
Lockdowns.

953
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:41,240
The quarantine zone?

954
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:43,240
I couldn't.

955
00:43:43,240 --> 00:43:45,240
Yep.

956
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:47,240
That's why when the little kid waddled up, they let him in

957
00:43:47,240 --> 00:43:49,240
but they did the test.

958
00:43:49,240 --> 00:43:51,240
And if you're infected, they put you down.

959
00:43:51,240 --> 00:43:53,240
Yeah.

960
00:43:53,240 --> 00:43:55,240
No, I promised Robert that you wouldn't hurt him.

961
00:43:55,240 --> 00:43:57,240
But I would very much like for you to hurt him.

962
00:43:57,240 --> 00:43:59,240
So let's go hunt that motherfucker.

963
00:43:59,240 --> 00:44:01,240
I know.

964
00:44:01,240 --> 00:44:03,240
How dare you.

965
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:05,240
Women? Liars?

966
00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:07,240
What?

967
00:44:07,240 --> 00:44:09,240
Ellie-based.

968
00:44:13,240 --> 00:44:15,240
She's not just a Mary Sue.

969
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:17,240
She's got an ass beat. Hard to be a Mary Sue with an ass beat.

970
00:44:17,240 --> 00:44:19,240
Yeah.

971
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:21,240
Well, the game was made back in 2013

972
00:44:21,240 --> 00:44:23,240
before a lot of the woke nonsense was everywhere.

973
00:44:31,240 --> 00:44:33,240
Very inspirational.

974
00:44:33,240 --> 00:44:35,240
Now this is new.

975
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:37,240
Seeing their perspective.

976
00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:47,240
Okay. Listen up, fucking communists.

977
00:44:51,240 --> 00:44:53,240
You're in a zombie apocalypse.

978
00:44:53,240 --> 00:44:55,240
Military dictatorship is the best you can fucking hope for.

979
00:44:55,240 --> 00:44:57,240
You're just killing humans now.

980
00:44:57,240 --> 00:44:59,240
Disrupting supplies.

981
00:44:59,240 --> 00:45:01,240
Ruining shit.

982
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:03,240
There's a lot of people.

983
00:45:05,240 --> 00:45:07,240
We're quitting? I'd go where?

984
00:45:07,240 --> 00:45:09,240
We're taking that random girl locked in that room.

985
00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:11,240
West.

986
00:45:11,240 --> 00:45:13,240
No, there's actually a reason for this.

987
00:45:13,240 --> 00:45:15,240
Are the African American Women's Liberation Army the bad guys?

988
00:45:15,240 --> 00:45:17,240
Yes.

989
00:45:17,240 --> 00:45:19,240
Yes.

990
00:45:19,240 --> 00:45:21,240
If you're thinking the Fireflies are

991
00:45:21,240 --> 00:45:23,240
quote unquote good guys, they are not.

992
00:45:23,240 --> 00:45:25,240
No.

993
00:45:25,240 --> 00:45:27,240
Immediately. They're blowing shit up

994
00:45:27,240 --> 00:45:29,240
in the only safe zone in the fucking...

995
00:45:29,240 --> 00:45:31,240
I wouldn't consider these people good guys

996
00:45:31,240 --> 00:45:33,240
regardless if they were supposed to be the good guys.

997
00:45:33,240 --> 00:45:35,240
Well, they're also talking about democracy and freedom

998
00:45:35,240 --> 00:45:37,240
though, you know. So, I don't know, maybe...

999
00:45:37,240 --> 00:45:39,240
Here's the thing. If the show

1000
00:45:39,240 --> 00:45:41,240
was going to go down some kind of woke

1001
00:45:41,240 --> 00:45:43,240
rabbit hole, they would

1002
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:45,240
make the Fireflies good guys.

1003
00:45:45,240 --> 00:45:47,240
Even though in the video game the Fireflies were

1004
00:45:47,240 --> 00:45:49,240
hypocrites. Yeah, they were just as bad

1005
00:45:49,240 --> 00:45:51,240
as the government was.

1006
00:45:51,240 --> 00:45:53,240
Yeah, that's what I remember doing.

1007
00:45:53,240 --> 00:45:55,240
If you're feeling loud...

1008
00:45:59,240 --> 00:46:01,240
You're rude.

1009
00:46:01,240 --> 00:46:03,240
Yeah, you just invited him to

1010
00:46:03,240 --> 00:46:05,240
join the communist movement. I wouldn't have

1011
00:46:05,240 --> 00:46:07,240
given him a warning.

1012
00:46:11,240 --> 00:46:13,240
Don't talk about this out walking down the street.

1013
00:46:13,240 --> 00:46:15,240
Listen, they need to for the audience's sake.

1014
00:46:15,240 --> 00:46:17,240
We've got to know what they're doing.

1015
00:46:17,240 --> 00:46:19,240
Yeah, how else would we know?

1016
00:46:19,240 --> 00:46:21,240
We're just going to have to guess.

1017
00:46:21,240 --> 00:46:23,240
Oh my god.

1018
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:27,240
Oh yeah,

1019
00:46:27,240 --> 00:46:29,240
you totally look like the kind of

1020
00:46:29,240 --> 00:46:31,240
strong man to pull that fucking thing off

1021
00:46:31,240 --> 00:46:33,240
the wall.

1022
00:46:33,240 --> 00:46:35,240
Why did you stop him?

1023
00:46:35,240 --> 00:46:37,240
Don't zoom into the

1024
00:46:37,240 --> 00:46:39,240
forehead show. God dammit.

1025
00:46:39,240 --> 00:46:41,240
It's so big.

1026
00:46:41,240 --> 00:46:43,240
She might be an alien.

1027
00:46:43,240 --> 00:46:45,240
Doesn't she have alcohol, fetal syndrome?

1028
00:46:45,240 --> 00:46:47,240
Like for real.

1029
00:46:47,240 --> 00:46:49,240
Look it up, Dev. I think she has it.

1030
00:46:49,240 --> 00:46:51,240
She was in Game of Thrones.

1031
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:53,240
Did she have alcohol,

1032
00:46:53,240 --> 00:46:55,240
fetal syndrome there too? Oh my god, it's not that

1033
00:46:55,240 --> 00:46:57,240
character, is it? It's the Bear Island

1034
00:46:57,240 --> 00:46:59,240
girl.

1035
00:47:01,240 --> 00:47:03,240
That's creepy.

1036
00:47:03,240 --> 00:47:05,240
Are you my fucking mom or something?

1037
00:47:05,240 --> 00:47:07,240
I look like your mom.

1038
00:47:07,240 --> 00:47:09,240
Yeah, that was pretty good.

1039
00:47:09,240 --> 00:47:11,240
That's a good point.

1040
00:47:11,240 --> 00:47:13,240
Terrorist?

1041
00:47:13,240 --> 00:47:15,240
Yes, terrorist.

1042
00:47:19,240 --> 00:47:21,240
Oh god, the Pito DLC.

1043
00:47:25,240 --> 00:47:27,240
Yeah, don't elaborate on that any further.

1044
00:47:27,240 --> 00:47:29,240
Just think about it.

1045
00:47:29,240 --> 00:47:31,240
I forgot about the Pito

1046
00:47:31,240 --> 00:47:33,240
DLC, okay?

1047
00:47:35,240 --> 00:47:37,240
Why is your face so flat?

1048
00:47:37,240 --> 00:47:39,240
It's like an anvil.

1049
00:47:39,240 --> 00:47:41,240
We could craft great weapons on it.

1050
00:47:41,240 --> 00:47:43,240
Jesus.

1051
00:47:43,240 --> 00:47:45,240
Shields are the finest

1052
00:47:45,240 --> 00:47:47,240
shields in armor.

1053
00:47:47,240 --> 00:47:49,240
You know it against her flat face.

1054
00:47:55,240 --> 00:47:57,240
There's an expansion they had

1055
00:47:57,240 --> 00:47:59,240
for Last of Us 1 where she has a

1056
00:47:59,240 --> 00:48:01,240
weird relationship as a child.

1057
00:48:01,240 --> 00:48:03,240
And it was like, ooh, that was just uncanny.

1058
00:48:03,240 --> 00:48:05,240
Well, it was with another child.

1059
00:48:05,240 --> 00:48:07,240
But it was still kind of strange to play through, I will admit.

1060
00:48:07,240 --> 00:48:09,240
They were like eight years old

1061
00:48:09,240 --> 00:48:11,240
or something.

1062
00:48:11,240 --> 00:48:13,240
They were kissing

1063
00:48:13,240 --> 00:48:15,240
and I was like, really? Do you need

1064
00:48:15,240 --> 00:48:17,240
to do that?

1065
00:48:17,240 --> 00:48:19,240
Like, wait until they're older, please.

1066
00:48:19,240 --> 00:48:21,240
Is this necessary?

1067
00:48:21,240 --> 00:48:23,240
No, it isn't.

1068
00:48:23,240 --> 00:48:25,240
Now to be fair, there wasn't any actual Pito

1069
00:48:25,240 --> 00:48:27,240
shit because there was no adults interacting with them.

1070
00:48:27,240 --> 00:48:29,240
I don't think kissing is inherently

1071
00:48:29,240 --> 00:48:31,240
so true.

1072
00:48:31,240 --> 00:48:33,240
It was uncanny.

1073
00:48:33,240 --> 00:48:35,240
I think it was more the fact that the player was playing

1074
00:48:35,240 --> 00:48:37,240
as it, you know?

1075
00:48:37,240 --> 00:48:39,240
That was a bit odd.

1076
00:48:39,240 --> 00:48:41,240
I just remember it was unsettling with our entire friend group

1077
00:48:41,240 --> 00:48:43,240
when we played it.

1078
00:48:43,240 --> 00:48:45,240
That's the one.

1079
00:48:45,240 --> 00:48:47,240
Because, I mean, Kibs, I don't know,

1080
00:48:47,240 --> 00:48:49,240
you remember being like nine or ten years old

1081
00:48:49,240 --> 00:48:51,240
and you get your first smooch from

1082
00:48:51,240 --> 00:48:53,240
a girl in your class and it's all innocent?

1083
00:48:53,240 --> 00:48:55,240
Yeah, but I want to see other

1084
00:48:55,240 --> 00:48:57,240
kids do that. That's weird.

1085
00:48:57,240 --> 00:48:59,240
You just want to do it yourself.

1086
00:48:59,240 --> 00:49:01,240
Yeah, when I did it as a kid,

1087
00:49:01,240 --> 00:49:03,240
that's fine. I don't want to see other people do that.

1088
00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:05,240
I think

1089
00:49:05,240 --> 00:49:07,240
for me,

1090
00:49:07,240 --> 00:49:09,240
it was playing as it

1091
00:49:09,240 --> 00:49:11,240
that was a bit strange.

1092
00:49:13,240 --> 00:49:15,240
Yep, there's a fungus person.

1093
00:49:15,240 --> 00:49:17,240
Also, they'd be infected right now.

1094
00:49:17,240 --> 00:49:19,240
Yeah, put on your masks.

1095
00:49:19,240 --> 00:49:21,240
Oh, there's no mask in the show! Fuck you!

1096
00:49:21,240 --> 00:49:23,240
I forgot!

1097
00:49:23,240 --> 00:49:25,240
No.

1098
00:49:27,240 --> 00:49:29,240
Yeah, they had gas masks.

1099
00:49:29,240 --> 00:49:31,240
Yeah, they had gas masks.

1100
00:49:31,240 --> 00:49:33,240
Because any time they turn into that,

1101
00:49:33,240 --> 00:49:35,240
they turn into sport producers.

1102
00:49:35,240 --> 00:49:37,240
But our friend Pedro

1103
00:49:37,240 --> 00:49:39,240
didn't want to wear masks

1104
00:49:39,240 --> 00:49:41,240
after the Mandalorian, so...

1105
00:49:41,240 --> 00:49:43,240
It's a see-through mask, even.

1106
00:49:43,240 --> 00:49:45,240
He negotiated masks

1107
00:49:45,240 --> 00:49:47,240
out of the lore, basically.

1108
00:49:47,240 --> 00:49:49,240
Are you serious?

1109
00:49:49,240 --> 00:49:51,240
There are rumors going around that he threw

1110
00:49:51,240 --> 00:49:53,240
a hissy fit during the Mandalorian.

1111
00:49:53,240 --> 00:49:55,240
That's why they took his helmet off that one episode

1112
00:49:55,240 --> 00:49:57,240
and that he refused to do anything like that again.

1113
00:49:57,240 --> 00:49:59,240
He's an actor with no integrity,

1114
00:49:59,240 --> 00:50:01,240
if that's the case.

1115
00:50:01,240 --> 00:50:03,240
I respect actors that wear helmets

1116
00:50:03,240 --> 00:50:05,240
and masks more than I do

1117
00:50:05,240 --> 00:50:07,240
those that don't.

1118
00:50:07,240 --> 00:50:09,240
I don't.

1119
00:50:09,240 --> 00:50:11,240
Those that don't.

1120
00:50:11,240 --> 00:50:13,240
The fuck?

1121
00:50:13,240 --> 00:50:15,240
Like the Tread remake?

1122
00:50:15,240 --> 00:50:17,240
That one...

1123
00:50:17,240 --> 00:50:19,240
That Tread happy mask on the entire time?

1124
00:50:19,240 --> 00:50:21,240
That was an excellent movie.

1125
00:50:21,240 --> 00:50:23,240
Great actor, too.

1126
00:50:23,240 --> 00:50:25,240
That was Carl Urban, right?

1127
00:50:25,240 --> 00:50:27,240
Yep.

1128
00:50:27,240 --> 00:50:29,240
Someone's red jelly is leaking out the side.

1129
00:50:29,240 --> 00:50:33,240
That doesn't look like gunpowder.

1130
00:50:33,240 --> 00:50:35,240
That's a hole.

1131
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:37,240
Oh, someone already got to

1132
00:50:37,240 --> 00:50:39,240
the group.

1133
00:50:39,240 --> 00:50:41,240
And there's the battery.

1134
00:50:41,240 --> 00:50:43,240
That's

1135
00:50:43,240 --> 00:50:45,240
very convenient, yeah.

1136
00:50:45,240 --> 00:50:47,240
A little suspicious.

1137
00:50:47,240 --> 00:50:49,240
Wouldn't that be valuable?

1138
00:50:55,240 --> 00:50:57,240
Pull the trigger.

1139
00:50:57,240 --> 00:50:59,240
You'll save us all a lot of trouble.

1140
00:50:59,240 --> 00:51:01,240
So this is who Robert screwed us over with?

1141
00:51:01,240 --> 00:51:03,240
The Che Guevara of Boston?

1142
00:51:03,240 --> 00:51:05,240
Really warm up with going pretty shitty

1143
00:51:05,240 --> 00:51:07,240
for you to be buying from scumbags like him.

1144
00:51:07,240 --> 00:51:09,240
Yeah, it kind of has been.

1145
00:51:09,240 --> 00:51:11,240
The merch was bad, and he obviously didn't take fuck off for an answer.

1146
00:51:11,240 --> 00:51:13,240
Give me my knife.

1147
00:51:13,240 --> 00:51:15,240
What do you need a car battery for?

1148
00:51:15,240 --> 00:51:17,240
Go.

1149
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:19,240
Not at her.

1150
00:51:19,240 --> 00:51:21,240
What do you mean?

1151
00:51:23,240 --> 00:51:25,240
Hey, trigger discipline, though.

1152
00:51:25,240 --> 00:51:29,240
That's a pretty basic test to use Che Guevara in a negative sense.

1153
00:51:29,240 --> 00:51:31,240
Yep.

1154
00:51:31,240 --> 00:51:33,240
You're remarkably chill for a woman whose spleen has been ventilated.

1155
00:51:33,240 --> 00:51:35,240
Yeah.

1156
00:51:51,240 --> 00:51:53,240
Jesus.

1157
00:51:53,240 --> 00:51:55,240
Oh, it is blown off, though.

1158
00:52:03,240 --> 00:52:05,240
What I do have is you.

1159
00:52:05,240 --> 00:52:07,240
And I know what you're both capable of.

1160
00:52:07,240 --> 00:52:09,240
For better or worse.

1161
00:52:11,240 --> 00:52:13,240
I don't think you know what the word squadron means.

1162
00:52:13,240 --> 00:52:15,240
You get her there safely,

1163
00:52:15,240 --> 00:52:17,240
and they'll give you what you deserve.

1164
00:52:17,240 --> 00:52:19,240
Yeah, it's not just a gang of people.

1165
00:52:19,240 --> 00:52:21,240
She's not a very good revolutionary, okay?

1166
00:52:21,240 --> 00:52:23,240
Arch, you gotta be gentle.

1167
00:52:23,240 --> 00:52:25,240
You'll talk it through, but please remember that I'm bleeding out.

1168
00:52:27,240 --> 00:52:31,240
Actually, I think that was her dialogue if you took too long.

1169
00:52:31,240 --> 00:52:33,240
Which is kind of funny.

1170
00:52:33,240 --> 00:52:35,240
It's like, hurry up!

1171
00:52:35,240 --> 00:52:39,240
Man, I kind of want to just push her nose in to make it flat with the rest of her face.

1172
00:52:39,240 --> 00:52:41,240
Jesus.

1173
00:52:41,240 --> 00:52:43,240
I mean, then we could use the anvil.

1174
00:52:43,240 --> 00:52:45,240
The anvil belly.

1175
00:52:45,240 --> 00:52:47,240
She could be a hammer.

1176
00:52:47,240 --> 00:52:51,240
She could. Like, grab her by the ankles and just wail her against the zombies.

1177
00:52:51,240 --> 00:52:53,240
It's a bit mean, but yeah, you could.

1178
00:52:53,240 --> 00:52:55,240
Don't fuck this up.

1179
00:52:55,240 --> 00:52:57,240
Effective.

1180
00:52:57,240 --> 00:52:59,240
Great blunt force damage.

1181
00:52:59,240 --> 00:53:03,240
You could kill many zombies with a hammer that heavy.

1182
00:53:03,240 --> 00:53:05,240
True.

1183
00:53:05,240 --> 00:53:07,240
Looks a bit unwieldy, though.

1184
00:53:07,240 --> 00:53:11,240
I remember when they made this deal, I think it was in a more open location, though.

1185
00:53:11,240 --> 00:53:13,240
Are you sure?

1186
00:53:13,240 --> 00:53:17,240
Yeah, because wasn't there a firefight that you played in game?

1187
00:53:17,240 --> 00:53:19,240
You just got to kill some people.

1188
00:53:21,240 --> 00:53:25,240
Because you got to shoot and stab people by this point.

1189
00:53:29,240 --> 00:53:31,240
She's just going to start stealing stuff.

1190
00:53:41,240 --> 00:53:43,240
Yeah, can she read? I wonder.

1191
00:53:45,240 --> 00:53:47,240
Yeah, I guess so.

1192
00:53:59,240 --> 00:54:01,240
Killing time.

1193
00:54:01,240 --> 00:54:03,240
I'm sure you'll figure that out.

1194
00:54:05,240 --> 00:54:11,240
There's plenty of alcohol on the table there, if you'd like to work on that thing of yours.

1195
00:54:21,240 --> 00:54:25,240
This is an uncomfortably long shot following that simple sentence.

1196
00:54:25,240 --> 00:54:27,240
Because he's having a little bit of PTSD.

1197
00:54:27,240 --> 00:54:31,240
Well, this is another scene they're perfectly recreating from the game.

1198
00:54:31,240 --> 00:54:33,240
Oh, the radio came on when you were sleeping.

1199
00:54:33,240 --> 00:54:35,240
What?

1200
00:54:35,240 --> 00:54:37,240
What was the song?

1201
00:54:37,240 --> 00:54:39,240
It kept saying, like, wake me up before you go-go.

1202
00:54:39,240 --> 00:54:41,240
Ha, ha, cursed.

1203
00:54:41,240 --> 00:54:43,240
Gotcha.

1204
00:54:43,240 --> 00:54:45,240
80s means trouble.

1205
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:47,240
Code broken.

1206
00:54:47,240 --> 00:54:49,240
That's pretty good.

1207
00:54:49,240 --> 00:54:51,240
Pretty clever.

1208
00:54:51,240 --> 00:54:53,240
Well, Ellie was clever in the game, too.

1209
00:54:53,240 --> 00:54:55,240
You got a jacket in your pack?

1210
00:54:55,240 --> 00:54:57,240
Yeah.

1211
00:54:57,240 --> 00:54:59,240
Is she not wearing a jacket?

1212
00:54:59,240 --> 00:55:01,240
Yeah, that's a good point.

1213
00:55:01,240 --> 00:55:03,240
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

1214
00:55:03,240 --> 00:55:05,240
Two jackets.

1215
00:55:05,240 --> 00:55:07,240
All right, well, chilly, I guess.

1216
00:55:07,240 --> 00:55:09,240
Fair enough.

1217
00:55:09,240 --> 00:55:11,240
So far I'm liking the sets, though.

1218
00:55:11,240 --> 00:55:13,240
Yeah.

1219
00:55:13,240 --> 00:55:15,240
It seems like they sunk a lot of money into this.

1220
00:55:15,240 --> 00:55:17,240
And, I mean, I think you only see Boston.

1221
00:55:17,240 --> 00:55:19,240
Like, at this point, they leave Boston and don't come back, right?

1222
00:55:19,240 --> 00:55:21,240
So, it's not like you're going back to this set.

1223
00:55:21,240 --> 00:55:23,240
Yeah, that's true.

1224
00:55:23,240 --> 00:55:25,240
Because if they're ever in the game, they never come back to Boston.

1225
00:55:25,240 --> 00:55:27,240
Because, you know, they're leaving.

1226
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:29,240
Well, the entrance just kind of looks like a prison.

1227
00:55:29,240 --> 00:55:31,240
They probably filled in the gates of a prison, I guess.

1228
00:55:31,240 --> 00:55:33,240
Yeah.

1229
00:55:33,240 --> 00:55:35,240
Just added to the game.

1230
00:55:35,240 --> 00:55:37,240
Yeah.

1231
00:55:37,240 --> 00:55:39,240
Yeah.

1232
00:55:39,240 --> 00:55:41,240
They probably filled in the gates of a prison, I guess.

1233
00:55:41,240 --> 00:55:43,240
Yeah.

1234
00:55:43,240 --> 00:55:45,240
Just added some stuff around.

1235
00:55:45,240 --> 00:55:47,240
Decorated the town to make it look a little run-down.

1236
00:55:47,240 --> 00:55:49,240
Yep.

1237
00:55:49,240 --> 00:55:51,240
Well, I think they intend to come back after this job.

1238
00:55:51,240 --> 00:55:53,240
They just don't because of reasons.

1239
00:55:55,240 --> 00:56:01,240
They were recording a Norwegian big movie set in the World War II once when I was in Oslo.

1240
00:56:01,240 --> 00:56:03,240
And there were swastikas everywhere.

1241
00:56:03,240 --> 00:56:05,240
And it made me feel a bit weird.

1242
00:56:05,240 --> 00:56:07,240
Ha, ha, ha.

1243
00:56:07,240 --> 00:56:13,240
Well, I didn't know. So I just walked down the street and there's a ginormous swastika hanging on Parliament.

1244
00:56:13,240 --> 00:56:15,240
I'm like, huh, something interesting has happened.

1245
00:56:15,240 --> 00:56:17,240
Ha, ha, ha.

1246
00:56:17,240 --> 00:56:19,240
That is something to see, yeah.

1247
00:56:19,240 --> 00:56:21,240
Ah, yes.

1248
00:56:21,240 --> 00:56:23,240
They're walking through the whole universe.

1249
00:56:23,240 --> 00:56:25,240
Change in policy, it seems.

1250
00:56:25,240 --> 00:56:27,240
Yeah.

1251
00:56:27,240 --> 00:56:29,240
That last election was pretty eventful.

1252
00:56:29,240 --> 00:56:31,240
Yep.

1253
00:56:31,240 --> 00:56:37,240
Also, like, they're recreating the levels.

1254
00:56:37,240 --> 00:56:39,240
Yeah, they actually are.

1255
00:56:39,240 --> 00:56:43,240
Because you go under a school bus and then through a ravine with concrete slabs.

1256
00:56:43,240 --> 00:56:47,240
They're actually just doing area for area from the game.

1257
00:56:47,240 --> 00:56:49,240
It's kind of incredible.

1258
00:56:49,240 --> 00:56:53,240
I can't tell if I haven't played it, but...

1259
00:56:53,240 --> 00:56:55,240
This feels like the game.

1260
00:56:55,240 --> 00:56:59,240
Did this fucking demolish the argument of every other poor adaptation, though?

1261
00:56:59,240 --> 00:57:03,240
This demolishes the Halo argument.

1262
00:57:03,240 --> 00:57:07,240
Where they're like, we couldn't just recreate the TV show, it'd be awful.

1263
00:57:07,240 --> 00:57:11,240
This is recreating the video game and it's actually interesting to watch.

1264
00:57:11,240 --> 00:57:17,240
Yeah, because they go under a school bus.

1265
00:57:17,240 --> 00:57:19,240
And do a pipe, yeah.

1266
00:57:19,240 --> 00:57:21,240
Through a ravine with concrete.

1267
00:57:21,240 --> 00:57:23,240
There's a red truck there.

1268
00:57:23,240 --> 00:57:25,240
And then they go into a pipe.

1269
00:57:25,240 --> 00:57:27,240
They remade the level for the set.

1270
00:57:27,240 --> 00:57:29,240
It's kind of nuts.

1271
00:57:29,240 --> 00:57:33,240
Yeah, that's probably going to be in the military class.

1272
00:57:33,240 --> 00:57:35,240
Yeah.

1273
00:57:35,240 --> 00:57:37,240
Mm-hmm.

1274
00:57:37,240 --> 00:57:39,240
That's correct, though.

1275
00:57:39,240 --> 00:57:41,240
That should be coming up soon.

1276
00:57:41,240 --> 00:57:43,240
There it is.

1277
00:57:43,240 --> 00:57:45,240
He's pissed again.

1278
00:57:45,240 --> 00:57:47,240
You gotta shoot him.

1279
00:57:53,240 --> 00:57:59,240
That thing is going to beep red, ain't it?

1280
00:57:59,240 --> 00:58:03,240
Not on her or him, but on that chick.

1281
00:58:03,240 --> 00:58:05,240
Great.

1282
00:58:19,240 --> 00:58:21,240
Yeah.

1283
00:58:23,240 --> 00:58:29,240
That's a good research and flashback.

1284
00:58:37,240 --> 00:58:39,240
He'll be dead soon.

1285
00:58:39,240 --> 00:58:41,240
He's probably dead now.

1286
00:58:41,240 --> 00:58:43,240
See, I think this is actually new to the show.

1287
00:58:43,240 --> 00:58:47,240
Yeah, I don't remember him having a spur go.

1288
00:58:47,240 --> 00:58:49,240
But that's, again...

1289
00:58:53,240 --> 00:58:55,240
Nobody lasts more than a day.

1290
00:58:55,240 --> 00:58:57,240
Just look at the health to you.

1291
00:58:57,240 --> 00:58:59,240
You would have killed me.

1292
00:58:59,240 --> 00:59:01,240
When did it happen?

1293
00:59:01,240 --> 00:59:03,240
It doesn't matter. You have to trust me.

1294
00:59:03,240 --> 00:59:05,240
They're going to catch you if we don't run.

1295
00:59:05,240 --> 00:59:07,240
Joe, we gotta move.

1296
00:59:07,240 --> 00:59:09,240
Yeah, I think it happened later, though.

1297
00:59:09,240 --> 00:59:11,240
It was a different moment.

1298
00:59:11,240 --> 00:59:13,240
Mm-hmm.

1299
00:59:13,240 --> 00:59:15,240
I think. It's been a while for me, too.

1300
00:59:15,240 --> 00:59:17,240
Yeah, take the gun, dude. Take the gun.

1301
00:59:17,240 --> 00:59:19,240
Nice.

1302
00:59:19,240 --> 00:59:21,240
Good upgrade.

1303
00:59:21,240 --> 00:59:23,240
I would have checked his body for some ammo, but, you know.

1304
00:59:23,240 --> 00:59:25,240
So they're hitting all the story beats.

1305
00:59:25,240 --> 00:59:27,240
They're changing things a little bit

1306
00:59:27,240 --> 00:59:29,240
just to make it work for TV,

1307
00:59:29,240 --> 00:59:31,240
but they're not changing it ridiculously.

1308
00:59:31,240 --> 00:59:33,240
It's not like the Halo TV show

1309
00:59:33,240 --> 00:59:35,240
where it has nothing to do with Halo at all.

1310
00:59:35,240 --> 00:59:37,240
Wait, what song is this?

1311
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:39,240
That scene looks pretty good, too.

1312
00:59:39,240 --> 00:59:41,240
It's easy.

1313
00:59:45,240 --> 00:59:47,240
Is that the Tilted Towers?

1314
00:59:47,240 --> 00:59:49,240
Yes.

1315
00:59:51,240 --> 00:59:53,240
There's that one, like...

1316
00:59:53,240 --> 00:59:55,240
There's that one

1317
00:59:55,240 --> 00:59:57,240
very well-known level

1318
00:59:57,240 --> 00:59:59,240
that happens in a Tilted Tower

1319
00:59:59,240 --> 01:00:01,240
that looks exactly like that.

1320
01:00:01,240 --> 01:00:03,240
They're doing so much stuff just for the fans,

1321
01:00:03,240 --> 01:00:05,240
you know what I mean?

1322
01:00:05,240 --> 01:00:07,240
There's a few inaccuracies here and there, though.

1323
01:00:07,240 --> 01:00:09,240
Like, you know, his daughter being black,

1324
01:00:09,240 --> 01:00:11,240
and her daughter was literally white-haired, blue-eyed.

1325
01:00:11,240 --> 01:00:13,240
I'm going to pause this so I don't get fucking copyrighted

1326
01:00:13,240 --> 01:00:15,240
any more than I already am.

1327
01:00:15,240 --> 01:00:17,240
Listen, Kyle, it's the current year.

1328
01:00:17,240 --> 01:00:19,240
They had to do something like that.

1329
01:00:19,240 --> 01:00:21,240
I know, but it's our job to look at it with a critical eye,

1330
01:00:21,240 --> 01:00:23,240
so there are some differences.

1331
01:00:23,240 --> 01:00:25,240
But Joel's hairdo,

1332
01:00:25,240 --> 01:00:27,240
like on the actor,

1333
01:00:27,240 --> 01:00:29,240
the facial hair, the hairstyle,

1334
01:00:29,240 --> 01:00:31,240
him getting the, you know,

1335
01:00:31,240 --> 01:00:35,240
black and salt and black pepper-like style hair,

1336
01:00:35,240 --> 01:00:37,240
where it's mixed with grey there,

1337
01:00:37,240 --> 01:00:39,240
that's accurate.

1338
01:00:39,240 --> 01:00:41,240
That is on the right path there.

1339
01:00:41,240 --> 01:00:43,240
A lot of stuff is just shot-for-shot identical.

1340
01:00:43,240 --> 01:00:45,240
A lot of stuff,

1341
01:00:45,240 --> 01:00:47,240
they try to deliver the lines the same way.

1342
01:00:47,240 --> 01:00:49,240
They make some mistakes here and there,

1343
01:00:49,240 --> 01:00:51,240
they change a few things,

1344
01:00:51,240 --> 01:00:53,240
but it's overall, like,

1345
01:00:53,240 --> 01:00:55,240
very faithful.

1346
01:00:55,240 --> 01:00:59,240
Looks pretty much just like she did in the game.

1347
01:00:59,240 --> 01:01:01,240
Really? I thought she had frizzy hair in the game.

1348
01:01:01,240 --> 01:01:03,240
She had frizzy hair,

1349
01:01:03,240 --> 01:01:05,240
but she pretty much looks right.

1350
01:01:05,240 --> 01:01:07,240
With Ellie,

1351
01:01:07,240 --> 01:01:09,240
I get what everybody's saying.

1352
01:01:09,240 --> 01:01:11,240
I think she, at the very least,

1353
01:01:11,240 --> 01:01:13,240
sounds a bit like Ellie,

1354
01:01:13,240 --> 01:01:15,240
at the very least, like her tones and inclinations.

1355
01:01:15,240 --> 01:01:17,240
She sounds a bit like her,

1356
01:01:17,240 --> 01:01:19,240
but she doesn't look like her,

1357
01:01:19,240 --> 01:01:21,240
and doesn't have the body language of her.

1358
01:01:21,240 --> 01:01:23,240
So for the actress who's playing Ellie,

1359
01:01:23,240 --> 01:01:25,240
she's actually doing a pretty convincing job

1360
01:01:25,240 --> 01:01:27,240
of winning me over via time,

1361
01:01:27,240 --> 01:01:29,240
but, like, definitely the opening shot.

1362
01:01:29,240 --> 01:01:33,240
She doesn't quite have the look of Ellie, though.

1363
01:01:33,240 --> 01:01:35,240
Yeah.

1364
01:01:35,240 --> 01:01:37,240
So, Arch, you don't know any of this stuff, right?

1365
01:01:37,240 --> 01:01:39,240
You're completely ignorant of all this.

1366
01:01:39,240 --> 01:01:41,240
He's just a blondie, that's true.

1367
01:01:41,240 --> 01:01:43,240
From what I see,

1368
01:01:43,240 --> 01:01:45,240
Ellie's character is,

1369
01:01:45,240 --> 01:01:47,240
from the TV show, not the TV show,

1370
01:01:47,240 --> 01:01:49,240
the game,

1371
01:01:49,240 --> 01:01:51,240
from the screenshot, she looks clearly designed

1372
01:01:51,240 --> 01:01:53,240
to be young and cute-looking.

1373
01:01:53,240 --> 01:01:55,240
Like, innocent is a better word.

1374
01:01:55,240 --> 01:01:57,240
You know?

1375
01:01:57,240 --> 01:01:59,240
Little upturned nose, blue inquisitive eyes,

1376
01:01:59,240 --> 01:02:01,240
small mouth, et cetera,

1377
01:02:01,240 --> 01:02:03,240
very clearly designed to

1378
01:02:03,240 --> 01:02:05,240
give an idea of innocence, right?

1379
01:02:05,240 --> 01:02:07,240
She looks like a kid.

1380
01:02:07,240 --> 01:02:09,240
This character in the TV show,

1381
01:02:09,240 --> 01:02:11,240
she doesn't look like a kid.

1382
01:02:11,240 --> 01:02:13,240
She looks like a grown woman

1383
01:02:13,240 --> 01:02:15,240
that's been dressed up as a child

1384
01:02:15,240 --> 01:02:17,240
for reasons.

1385
01:02:17,240 --> 01:02:19,240
Yeah.

1386
01:02:19,240 --> 01:02:21,240
Looked it up, her actress

1387
01:02:21,240 --> 01:02:23,240
is, uh,

1388
01:02:23,240 --> 01:02:25,240
19 years old now.

1389
01:02:25,240 --> 01:02:27,240
When she first came to prominence,

1390
01:02:27,240 --> 01:02:29,240
it was... Really?

1391
01:02:29,240 --> 01:02:31,240
She looks a lot older than that.

1392
01:02:31,240 --> 01:02:33,240
She's 19. When she first came to prominence,

1393
01:02:33,240 --> 01:02:35,240
was

1394
01:02:35,240 --> 01:02:37,240
in 2016

1395
01:02:37,240 --> 01:02:39,240
in Game of Thrones

1396
01:02:39,240 --> 01:02:41,240
Season 6. So how many years ago

1397
01:02:41,240 --> 01:02:43,240
was that? Seven years ago. So she was

1398
01:02:43,240 --> 01:02:45,240
what, 12 back then? As Leanna

1399
01:02:45,240 --> 01:02:47,240
Mormont, she actually looks like she could be Ellie.

1400
01:02:47,240 --> 01:02:49,240
Leanna Mormont, she looks

1401
01:02:49,240 --> 01:02:51,240
more like Ellie.

1402
01:02:51,240 --> 01:02:53,240
She looks like she could be Ellie at

1403
01:02:53,240 --> 01:02:55,240
that age, but she was, she was 12

1404
01:02:55,240 --> 01:02:57,240
in that photo. How old was

1405
01:02:57,240 --> 01:02:59,240
Ellie in the video game? Do you remember?

1406
01:02:59,240 --> 01:03:01,240
I think she was between 12 and 14.

1407
01:03:01,240 --> 01:03:03,240
Okay, gotcha.

1408
01:03:03,240 --> 01:03:05,240
They're probably just like, oh, she was

1409
01:03:05,240 --> 01:03:07,240
great in Game of Thrones, and they're like, wait, that was

1410
01:03:07,240 --> 01:03:09,240
seven years ago.

1411
01:03:09,240 --> 01:03:11,240
Yeah, it's like she's a little too old now.

1412
01:03:11,240 --> 01:03:13,240
It's also just that her

1413
01:03:13,240 --> 01:03:15,240
facial features are wrong

1414
01:03:15,240 --> 01:03:17,240
for this. Like,

1415
01:03:17,240 --> 01:03:19,240
as a kid, she looked

1416
01:03:19,240 --> 01:03:21,240
alright for the role, but now

1417
01:03:21,240 --> 01:03:23,240
she,

1418
01:03:23,240 --> 01:03:25,240
she looks,

1419
01:03:25,240 --> 01:03:27,240
she's got this weird androgynous

1420
01:03:27,240 --> 01:03:29,240
feel to her, and she looks

1421
01:03:29,240 --> 01:03:31,240
way older than

1422
01:03:31,240 --> 01:03:33,240
19. Is that just me?

1423
01:03:33,240 --> 01:03:35,240
I could see her 19, but she does definitely

1424
01:03:35,240 --> 01:03:37,240
look more androgynous than Ellie looked.

1425
01:03:37,240 --> 01:03:39,240
Ellie was not an androgynous character. Okay, Arx,

1426
01:03:39,240 --> 01:03:41,240
this is more for your benefit,

1427
01:03:41,240 --> 01:03:43,240
but it will be interesting to compare.

1428
01:03:43,240 --> 01:03:45,240
This is from The Last of Us Part 1 Remake.

1429
01:03:45,240 --> 01:03:47,240
It's a remake of the original game. All the

1430
01:03:47,240 --> 01:03:49,240
Joel and Ellie cutscenes. We're just going to watch a few,

1431
01:03:49,240 --> 01:03:51,240
and we're not going to watch all of them, and we're not going to watch the whole

1432
01:03:51,240 --> 01:03:53,240
thing, but I just want to show you

1433
01:03:53,240 --> 01:03:55,240
specifically, like...

1434
01:04:01,240 --> 01:04:03,240
Let her go.

1435
01:04:15,240 --> 01:04:17,240
Yeah, you were right, Kibbs. They were in a

1436
01:04:17,240 --> 01:04:19,240
room, not a hallway.

1437
01:04:31,240 --> 01:04:53,240
So, they're hitting the

1438
01:04:53,240 --> 01:04:55,240
same story beats, and they're doing kind of

1439
01:04:55,240 --> 01:04:57,240
the same things.

1440
01:04:57,240 --> 01:04:59,240
I think they have to change some of it,

1441
01:04:59,240 --> 01:05:01,240
but it seems reasonably faithful.

1442
01:05:03,240 --> 01:05:05,240
This is the same scene.

1443
01:05:29,240 --> 01:05:47,240
So, again, same scene. They just kind of paste it differently.

1444
01:05:47,240 --> 01:05:49,240
I think I've heard the original for this one.

1445
01:05:49,240 --> 01:05:53,240
Well, I still think the video game does a lot of things always better.

1446
01:05:53,240 --> 01:05:55,240
Yeah.

1447
01:05:55,240 --> 01:05:57,240
Because it was how the vision was intended to be.

1448
01:05:57,240 --> 01:05:59,240
Yeah, me too.

1449
01:05:59,240 --> 01:06:01,240
Alright.

1450
01:06:03,240 --> 01:06:07,240
Yeah, this scene was different.

1451
01:06:07,240 --> 01:06:09,240
Yep, because it was a soldier, they didn't have a history with it.

1452
01:06:09,240 --> 01:06:11,240
Yeah.

1453
01:06:11,240 --> 01:06:13,240
That was added for the show, I think.

1454
01:06:19,240 --> 01:06:21,240
They also called it in right away.

1455
01:06:25,240 --> 01:06:27,240
Yep.

1456
01:06:29,240 --> 01:06:31,240
Yep.

1457
01:06:55,240 --> 01:06:57,240
No, they do find out here.

1458
01:06:57,240 --> 01:06:59,240
Yep.

1459
01:07:25,240 --> 01:07:27,240
It's three weeks old.

1460
01:07:27,240 --> 01:07:29,240
No, everyone turns within two days, so you stop bullshitting.

1461
01:07:29,240 --> 01:07:31,240
It's three weeks.

1462
01:07:31,240 --> 01:07:33,240
I swear.

1463
01:07:33,240 --> 01:07:35,240
Why would she set you up?

1464
01:07:39,240 --> 01:07:43,240
They take a lot better time explaining it here, though.

1465
01:07:43,240 --> 01:07:59,240
They do, but I will say I think showing the PTSD was probably a better way to do the scene.

1466
01:07:59,240 --> 01:08:01,240
Yeah, a couple of things.

1467
01:08:01,240 --> 01:08:05,240
Joel had a better reaction in the show.

1468
01:08:05,240 --> 01:08:09,240
Now, a soldier being on guard by himself is fucking retarded.

1469
01:08:09,240 --> 01:08:11,240
That was a good scene.

1470
01:08:11,240 --> 01:08:15,240
The PTSD was well explained, and it makes Joel feel more human.

1471
01:08:15,240 --> 01:08:19,240
Whereas here, they both just fucking coldheartedly kill a couple of soldiers like it's nothing.

1472
01:08:19,240 --> 01:08:21,240
Yes.

1473
01:08:21,240 --> 01:08:23,240
Ellie's reaction, too, I think I know what I don't like.

1474
01:08:23,240 --> 01:08:27,240
Because this Ellie is way softer, gentler.

1475
01:08:27,240 --> 01:08:31,240
She feels younger, more naive.

1476
01:08:31,240 --> 01:08:35,240
Like she doesn't understand the seriousness of the situation.

1477
01:08:35,240 --> 01:08:37,240
When she stabs the soldiers, she says, sorry.

1478
01:08:37,240 --> 01:08:39,240
I thought we were just going to hold them up.

1479
01:08:39,240 --> 01:08:41,240
TV show, none of that.

1480
01:08:41,240 --> 01:08:43,240
She just stabs them.

1481
01:08:43,240 --> 01:08:49,240
The far more innocent delivery makes me instantly feel more for her.

1482
01:08:49,240 --> 01:08:51,240
It makes her feel like a young kid in need of protection.

1483
01:08:51,240 --> 01:08:57,240
Whereas in the TV show, there's far too much strong female character in the mix.

1484
01:08:57,240 --> 01:09:01,240
Yeah, she needs to be a little bit more naive.

1485
01:09:01,240 --> 01:09:05,240
Ellie is a strong little lady, and she can actually take a punch.

1486
01:09:05,240 --> 01:09:09,240
She's also extremely vulgar, even in the game.

1487
01:09:09,240 --> 01:09:13,240
But she also is inexperienced, and so death is still hard for her.

1488
01:09:13,240 --> 01:09:21,240
Now, in the video game, it makes a lot more sense that Joel and Tess aren't bothered by death as much, because they've dealt with it so much.

1489
01:09:21,240 --> 01:09:23,240
They've become desensitized to it.

1490
01:09:23,240 --> 01:09:27,240
That's why in the video game, they're not bothered by killing, because they've killed before.

1491
01:09:27,240 --> 01:09:29,240
Many times.

1492
01:09:29,240 --> 01:09:41,240
In the show, it's implied that they've killed two, but in the game, by the time you get to the end of episode one in the show, you've already killed dozens, if not a hundred people.

1493
01:09:41,240 --> 01:09:43,240
Yeah, you could kill a lot of people over the course of the game.

1494
01:09:43,240 --> 01:09:45,240
It is because of a video game, yes.

1495
01:09:45,240 --> 01:09:47,240
But I think you're right, Arch.

1496
01:09:47,240 --> 01:09:57,240
In case you haven't been able to tell at this point, they're trying to do a Joel finds a replacement daughter storyline, obviously, right?

1497
01:09:57,240 --> 01:10:03,240
And to do that, you have to have Ellie be at least kinda likable.

1498
01:10:03,240 --> 01:10:07,240
Well, she needs to be a kid.

1499
01:10:07,240 --> 01:10:09,240
Yeah.

1500
01:10:09,240 --> 01:10:13,240
The character in the TV show does not strike me as a kid at all.

1501
01:10:13,240 --> 01:10:21,240
At the absolute most optimistic, she strikes me as a late teenage know-it-all.

1502
01:10:21,240 --> 01:10:35,240
I looked it up, she's 14 in the first game, she's 12 during the Discovering I'm a Lesbian DLC, and she's 19 in the second game.

1503
01:10:35,240 --> 01:10:39,240
She doesn't seem like a 14-year-old in this show.

1504
01:10:39,240 --> 01:10:45,240
Again, I think that is the thing. There's too much strong female in this.

1505
01:10:45,240 --> 01:10:49,240
Yeah, the whole stabbing the guy and just go rawr at the same time.

1506
01:10:49,240 --> 01:10:57,240
And the thing is too, in the clip you showed there where she tried to do the whole stabby thing to begin with, she was clearly shit at it.

1507
01:10:57,240 --> 01:10:59,240
And she was caught easily.

1508
01:10:59,240 --> 01:11:05,240
Whereas in the TV show, she straight up fucking ambushes Joel, and it's only because he's a ninja that he manages to stop her.

1509
01:11:05,240 --> 01:11:09,240
Let's go, episode 2. Enough intermission.

1510
01:11:09,240 --> 01:11:11,240
Well, this definitely wasn't in the game.

1511
01:11:11,240 --> 01:11:13,240
Nope.

1512
01:11:13,240 --> 01:11:23,240
Jakarta, Indonesia. Wow, we've seen change rather violently. Please speak English. You know you want to.

1513
01:11:23,240 --> 01:11:27,240
Hello!

1514
01:11:27,240 --> 01:11:29,240
We are looking for zombies.

1515
01:11:29,240 --> 01:11:37,240
Wait, they're going to do a racist food thing, aren't they? You guys ate some weird mushrooms and now we're all infected.

1516
01:11:43,240 --> 01:11:53,240
This is all new.

1517
01:11:53,240 --> 01:12:01,240
You say that, but we're going to show you something interesting now.

1518
01:12:01,240 --> 01:12:03,240
Oh damn.

1519
01:12:03,240 --> 01:12:05,240
I didn't need that video game.

1520
01:12:05,240 --> 01:12:10,240
Wait, do I have to censor these boobs? No! Extra work!

1521
01:12:10,240 --> 01:12:12,240
Why do you have to censor the pubes, too?

1522
01:12:12,240 --> 01:12:16,240
Why do you have to support them, isn't it? They'll free the nipple.

1523
01:12:16,240 --> 01:12:18,240
Mmm.

1524
01:12:18,240 --> 01:12:20,240
You jailed the nipple. Now.

1525
01:12:20,240 --> 01:12:28,240
Oh luckily she took time to paint her toes. Isn't that nice?

1526
01:12:28,240 --> 01:12:29,240
Ooh.

1527
01:12:29,240 --> 01:12:32,240
Yeah, it's fungus on the inside.

1528
01:12:32,240 --> 01:12:36,240
She's going to chomp.

1529
01:12:36,240 --> 01:12:39,240
Nah, she'd open her eyes first so she'd really freak out.

1530
01:12:39,240 --> 01:12:41,240
Wriggly tentacles?

1531
01:12:41,240 --> 01:12:45,240
The little tendrils in the mouth, that's new, Dev, isn't it?

1532
01:12:45,240 --> 01:12:52,240
Yeah, that's the transmission method now. Because, remember, they removed the spores. They now transmit via tentacle sex.

1533
01:12:52,240 --> 01:12:59,240
That's why when they were on top of people they kept, like, mouthing over them because the tentacles were planting more fungi bits.

1534
01:12:59,240 --> 01:13:02,240
It still feels like an unnecessary change, if you ask me.

1535
01:13:20,240 --> 01:13:24,240
That is admirably cold and I appreciate that.

1536
01:13:24,240 --> 01:13:29,240
I like how the turtle dude's like, holy shit.

1537
01:13:35,240 --> 01:13:41,240
Hold on. Wait on your woman moment for a second.

1538
01:13:41,240 --> 01:13:48,240
At least be like, wait to bomb till I've left with my family. But no, she's like, I just won't go home and get bombed now.

1539
01:13:48,240 --> 01:13:53,240
Well, she's probably thinking that she might be infected because she was just in there, right?

1540
01:13:53,240 --> 01:13:56,240
Possibly. She was in a vacuum-sealed suit.

1541
01:13:56,240 --> 01:13:58,240
Yeah.

1542
01:13:58,240 --> 01:14:00,240
Plus, remember, again, it's not airborne.

1543
01:14:00,240 --> 01:14:04,240
This intro is still creatively bankrupt. I can't get over it.

1544
01:14:04,240 --> 01:14:13,240
It's like, I don't like these deviations. It feels like the show is thinking to itself, are you actually kind of wanting to do a different zombie apocalypse thing?

1545
01:14:13,240 --> 01:14:19,240
They're like, we don't need these 10 minutes, this is what happened befores.

1546
01:14:19,240 --> 01:14:28,240
Yeah, because all these scenes are is trying to justify the changes to the lore as to why it's not spore-based anymore, which is retarded.

1547
01:14:28,240 --> 01:14:31,240
It's like 20 minutes of pointless justification.

1548
01:14:31,240 --> 01:14:35,240
Because the zombies are spores.

1549
01:14:35,240 --> 01:14:42,240
So the reason why that zombie was on the wall arch is because at the next stage what happens is they start emitting those spores.

1550
01:14:42,240 --> 01:14:45,240
Because that's how they continue to infect and continue to spread.

1551
01:14:45,240 --> 01:14:48,240
Yeah, they're in giant mushrooms, they just start blowing spores everywhere.

1552
01:14:48,240 --> 01:14:53,240
Yeah, but now that doesn't make any sense for them to do that. There's no reason for it.

1553
01:14:53,240 --> 01:14:59,240
The whole point of the zombie reproduction in the game is that it would make spore zones underground.

1554
01:14:59,240 --> 01:15:06,240
Yep. And that has now been invalidated, which kind of undermines the whole reproductive process.

1555
01:15:06,240 --> 01:15:11,240
I think the reason that the clickers were blind is because they were sensitive to light.

1556
01:15:11,240 --> 01:15:15,240
And so that drove them underground to...

1557
01:15:16,240 --> 01:15:24,240
Sensitive to UV, hence why the clickers when they're at that stage go underground to then turn into the big giant spores which produce more airborne spores.

1558
01:15:24,240 --> 01:15:27,240
They just watch all night to make sure she didn't turn overnight.

1559
01:15:31,240 --> 01:15:34,240
That's Boston. I think any spot is as good as any other.

1560
01:15:36,240 --> 01:15:38,240
Just you.

1561
01:15:38,240 --> 01:15:40,240
That's funny.

1562
01:15:42,240 --> 01:15:44,240
I mean you can still just piss in the toilet.

1563
01:15:44,240 --> 01:15:46,240
Racism against the infected.

1564
01:15:49,240 --> 01:15:51,240
Delicious hardtack.

1565
01:15:52,240 --> 01:15:54,240
Bit chewy.

1566
01:15:54,240 --> 01:15:56,240
Raises the bugs.

1567
01:15:56,240 --> 01:15:58,240
Is it chicken?

1568
01:15:58,240 --> 01:16:00,240
Yep.

1569
01:16:00,240 --> 01:16:02,240
Or until they get it from smugglers.

1570
01:16:04,240 --> 01:16:06,240
Guess not you guys.

1571
01:16:07,240 --> 01:16:09,240
Ouch.

1572
01:16:11,240 --> 01:16:14,240
Because you are. Because you're 19.

1573
01:16:26,240 --> 01:16:30,240
You know what? This scene is the same as the game as well.

1574
01:16:30,240 --> 01:16:32,240
They're really sticking to it.

1575
01:16:32,240 --> 01:16:34,240
I had the same conversation.

1576
01:16:34,240 --> 01:16:36,240
Yep, the exact same conversation. Same lines.

1577
01:16:43,240 --> 01:16:45,240
That's kind of funny.

1578
01:16:47,240 --> 01:16:49,240
Pick up your sandwich.

1579
01:16:49,240 --> 01:16:51,240
Yeah, eat your fucking chicken sandwich. What's wrong?

1580
01:16:51,240 --> 01:16:53,240
Absolutely not.

1581
01:16:53,240 --> 01:16:56,240
Okay, Jesus, fine. I'll just have a fucking sandwich out there.

1582
01:16:57,240 --> 01:16:59,240
Let me turn up.

1583
01:17:04,240 --> 01:17:06,240
Jurassic Park theme music.

1584
01:17:08,240 --> 01:17:10,240
Just because it's got overgrown buildings.

1585
01:17:13,240 --> 01:17:15,240
Look, there's even the dinosaurs there.

1586
01:17:15,240 --> 01:17:17,240
That's not dinosaurs. Those are birds.

1587
01:17:17,240 --> 01:17:20,240
Birds, dinosaurs, Kyle. That's what Jurassic Park told me.

1588
01:17:20,240 --> 01:17:23,240
He's like, the word to dinosaurs waxes.

1589
01:17:23,240 --> 01:17:25,240
We should get moving.

1590
01:17:25,240 --> 01:17:27,240
Before the T-Rex finds us.

1591
01:17:27,240 --> 01:17:30,240
And, dude, they have the same leaning tower. It's great.

1592
01:17:30,240 --> 01:17:32,240
They knew what was iconic about the first game.

1593
01:17:32,240 --> 01:17:34,240
And they put it in there.

1594
01:17:35,240 --> 01:17:38,240
So we could do this. So we could basically be like, I member.

1595
01:17:38,240 --> 01:17:41,240
Yep. I'm membering.

1596
01:17:41,240 --> 01:17:44,240
I wonder how much of this is CG and how much of it is like they dressed up a street.

1597
01:17:45,240 --> 01:17:48,240
Well, the crumbly towers, I would have to say, are definitely CG.

1598
01:17:54,240 --> 01:17:56,240
Oh, they're doing the hotel.

1599
01:17:56,240 --> 01:17:59,240
This is CG. You can actually see the hard cuts slightly off in the distance.

1600
01:17:59,240 --> 01:18:01,240
Yeah.

1601
01:18:02,240 --> 01:18:05,240
See, they're going to the hotel and they're just doing the levels of the game.

1602
01:18:05,240 --> 01:18:08,240
It's kind of nice to see them just stick to it.

1603
01:18:14,240 --> 01:18:16,240
Are you there alone?

1604
01:18:17,240 --> 01:18:19,240
Yeah.

1605
01:18:20,240 --> 01:18:22,240
How old are you?

1606
01:18:22,240 --> 01:18:23,240
Fourteen.

1607
01:18:23,240 --> 01:18:25,240
Nineteen.

1608
01:18:25,240 --> 01:18:28,240
Mommy, you got some balls on you, sister.

1609
01:18:29,240 --> 01:18:30,240
Thanks.

1610
01:18:30,240 --> 01:18:33,240
Also, you weren't alone in there, you liar.

1611
01:18:34,240 --> 01:18:36,240
Don't bring up that cringey DLC.

1612
01:18:36,240 --> 01:18:38,240
I played the DLC.

1613
01:18:38,240 --> 01:18:40,240
Nobody's going to be coming after you, right?

1614
01:18:40,240 --> 01:18:43,240
Like mom, dad, boyfriend.

1615
01:18:43,240 --> 01:18:46,240
I'm an orphan and no.

1616
01:18:48,240 --> 01:18:51,240
Because she's a lesbian.

1617
01:18:52,240 --> 01:18:53,240
Did she know that?

1618
01:18:53,240 --> 01:18:56,240
Hey, that DLC was made during current year policy.

1619
01:18:56,240 --> 01:19:01,240
To be fair, she didn't point it out cringily like that one scene in Discovery

1620
01:19:01,240 --> 01:19:05,240
where they force the pronouns in out of nowhere.

1621
01:19:05,240 --> 01:19:06,240
It makes no fucking sense.

1622
01:19:06,240 --> 01:19:08,240
They just use these pronouns to this character.

1623
01:19:08,240 --> 01:19:10,240
It's like, oh, Jesus, why is this in the script?

1624
01:19:10,240 --> 01:19:12,240
She could have made a deal out of it.

1625
01:19:12,240 --> 01:19:14,240
And they're like, no, actually, I'm a lesbian.

1626
01:19:14,240 --> 01:19:16,240
It's my identity.

1627
01:19:16,240 --> 01:19:17,240
And she didn't.

1628
01:19:17,240 --> 01:19:18,240
And I munch rug.

1629
01:19:18,240 --> 01:19:19,240
And she didn't.

1630
01:19:19,240 --> 01:19:21,240
Just let it be.

1631
01:19:23,240 --> 01:19:25,240
That was the mating call of the average Bostonian.

1632
01:19:25,240 --> 01:19:27,240
Wow, food.

1633
01:19:27,240 --> 01:19:28,240
Yeah, man.

1634
01:19:28,240 --> 01:19:29,240
Mm, ducks.

1635
01:19:29,240 --> 01:19:31,240
Put bullets inside of them.

1636
01:19:33,240 --> 01:19:34,240
Oh, look.

1637
01:19:34,240 --> 01:19:35,240
Stop it, frog.

1638
01:19:35,240 --> 01:19:38,240
Pepe is playing a tune.

1639
01:19:39,240 --> 01:19:42,240
I know this, that's pretty cool.

1640
01:19:42,240 --> 01:19:44,240
Yeah, this is the hotel lobby, right?

1641
01:19:44,240 --> 01:19:45,240
Yeah.

1642
01:19:45,240 --> 01:19:50,240
I feel like wandering around in knee-high water with a zombie infection around is a terrible idea.

1643
01:19:50,240 --> 01:19:52,240
But then again, that's just me.

1644
01:19:52,240 --> 01:19:53,240
Yeah.

1645
01:19:53,240 --> 01:19:55,240
You could get a cut, an injury, you could trip.

1646
01:19:55,240 --> 01:20:00,240
Yeah, just in general, wandering around in knee-high, stale water is a bad idea.

1647
01:20:03,240 --> 01:20:04,240
That is plastic.

1648
01:20:04,240 --> 01:20:07,240
And you can see the fucking plastic mold lines.

1649
01:20:07,240 --> 01:20:08,240
Yep.

1650
01:20:08,240 --> 01:20:10,240
Oh, good attempt, I guess.

1651
01:20:10,240 --> 01:20:11,240
Yep.

1652
01:20:11,240 --> 01:20:12,240
And you know what?

1653
01:20:12,240 --> 01:20:16,240
To the story's credit, she's acting a bit more naive this episode.

1654
01:20:16,240 --> 01:20:17,240
Would you want an arch?

1655
01:20:17,240 --> 01:20:21,240
I mean, that was incredibly annoying, the thing she just did, but yeah.

1656
01:20:21,240 --> 01:20:24,240
Well, naivety and annoyingness kind of go together.

1657
01:20:24,240 --> 01:20:27,240
She's pretty much acted like this in the game too, so.

1658
01:20:27,240 --> 01:20:28,240
Yep, yep.

1659
01:20:28,240 --> 01:20:31,240
They're doing just shot for shot, scene for scene, interaction for interaction.

1660
01:20:31,240 --> 01:20:33,240
They're just making the show.

1661
01:20:33,240 --> 01:20:35,240
No excuses, no nonsense.

1662
01:20:35,240 --> 01:20:36,240
No, we can't do this.

1663
01:20:36,240 --> 01:20:39,240
No, there's not enough content in the original lore.

1664
01:20:39,240 --> 01:20:40,240
They're just doing it.

1665
01:20:40,240 --> 01:20:42,240
I'm very impressed.

1666
01:20:45,240 --> 01:20:47,240
Just shoulder the doors in, man, it's okay.

1667
01:20:47,240 --> 01:20:48,240
Right, well.

1668
01:20:48,240 --> 01:20:50,240
It's like 56.

1669
01:20:50,240 --> 01:20:52,240
You fucking shoulder the door in.

1670
01:20:52,240 --> 01:20:58,240
They do have high-powered fucking rifles, so, you know, opening the door wouldn't actually be a problem.

1671
01:20:58,240 --> 01:21:02,240
Yeah, a locked door in an abandoned post-apocalyptic building is not that big of a deal.

1672
01:21:02,240 --> 01:21:05,240
Well, you don't want to waste ammunition.

1673
01:21:05,240 --> 01:21:08,240
You also don't want to make the lock noises.

1674
01:21:08,240 --> 01:21:11,240
Also, Mythbusters did...

1675
01:21:14,240 --> 01:21:17,240
You can actually shoot locks off with them.

1676
01:21:17,240 --> 01:21:18,240
Oh, you can't?

1677
01:21:18,240 --> 01:21:19,240
Yeah.

1678
01:21:19,240 --> 01:21:21,240
Oh, you absolutely can.

1679
01:21:21,240 --> 01:21:22,240
You just need to know where the lock is.

1680
01:21:22,240 --> 01:21:26,240
You don't shoot the lock, you shoot the locking pin.

1681
01:21:26,240 --> 01:21:31,240
You know, the whole Ellie with the switchblade thing was actually a game mechanic,

1682
01:21:31,240 --> 01:21:34,240
because the shivs you could craft were like insta-kill for zombies.

1683
01:21:34,240 --> 01:21:38,240
Whenever you played as Ellie, she had a knife that could just insta-kill constantly to make it easier.

1684
01:21:38,240 --> 01:21:41,240
I actually like this more...

1685
01:21:43,240 --> 01:21:45,240
...sympathetic Joe.

1686
01:21:45,240 --> 01:21:46,240
Or Joe.

1687
01:21:46,240 --> 01:21:47,240
Joel.

1688
01:21:47,240 --> 01:21:48,240
Joel, you got it right.

1689
01:21:48,240 --> 01:21:49,240
Whatever the hell he is.

1690
01:21:49,240 --> 01:21:52,240
Because he's not just a killing machine, he's just a human now.

1691
01:21:52,240 --> 01:21:54,240
Well, yeah, he's on a video game.

1692
01:21:54,240 --> 01:21:57,240
Video games, you gotta have action sequences or...

1693
01:21:57,240 --> 01:21:58,240
Big game boring.

1694
01:21:58,240 --> 01:22:01,240
Where you stealth kill 30 soldiers.

1695
01:22:02,240 --> 01:22:03,240
That was always funny.

1696
01:22:03,240 --> 01:22:07,240
Wow, the dye in those pillows have survived remarkably well.

1697
01:22:07,240 --> 01:22:08,240
Hold on, hold on.

1698
01:22:08,240 --> 01:22:13,240
They've completely remade that one scene.

1699
01:22:13,240 --> 01:22:14,240
Do you recognize this, Kibbs?

1700
01:22:14,240 --> 01:22:16,240
Yes, I do.

1701
01:22:16,240 --> 01:22:18,240
Yeah, it's the first encounter with a clicker.

1702
01:22:18,240 --> 01:22:20,240
They remade the set.

1703
01:22:20,240 --> 01:22:23,240
Like, talk about attention to detail.

1704
01:22:23,240 --> 01:22:26,240
Oh, that's a good one.

1705
01:22:26,240 --> 01:22:28,240
It's pretty much just like from the game.

1706
01:22:28,240 --> 01:22:29,240
Yep.

1707
01:22:31,240 --> 01:22:32,240
Well, that's disgusting.

1708
01:22:32,240 --> 01:22:34,240
Why are they doing that?

1709
01:22:34,240 --> 01:22:36,240
Zombie orgy, baby.

1710
01:22:51,240 --> 01:22:53,240
Oh, they're back in the sun.

1711
01:22:53,240 --> 01:22:54,240
Yeah.

1712
01:23:03,240 --> 01:23:07,240
I don't remember dead, though.

1713
01:23:07,240 --> 01:23:09,240
The underground fiber optic.

1714
01:23:09,240 --> 01:23:10,240
Yep.

1715
01:23:10,240 --> 01:23:12,240
We're doing the fucking Avatar thing.

1716
01:23:12,240 --> 01:23:14,240
Because fungi are intelligent now.

1717
01:23:14,240 --> 01:23:17,240
I'm pretty sure we've seen like underground corsets and stuff.

1718
01:23:17,240 --> 01:23:18,240
No.

1719
01:23:18,240 --> 01:23:20,240
We have, but not to the way she just described it.

1720
01:23:20,240 --> 01:23:21,240
That was different.

1721
01:23:21,240 --> 01:23:22,240
Yeah, it doesn't work like that.

1722
01:23:22,240 --> 01:23:25,240
The Sebi, like hive mind stuff, that's new.

1723
01:23:25,240 --> 01:23:28,240
Oh, it's the zombies that are communists.

1724
01:23:29,240 --> 01:23:32,240
They're all collectivized.

1725
01:23:32,240 --> 01:23:35,240
Well, you're saying this shell is actually based.

1726
01:23:35,240 --> 01:23:39,240
Okay, you just said that if you touch some of the cordyceps,

1727
01:23:39,240 --> 01:23:41,240
everyone around knows, right?

1728
01:23:41,240 --> 01:23:42,240
Are you going to go into this really?

1729
01:23:42,240 --> 01:23:44,240
Don't touch it, dude.

1730
01:23:44,240 --> 01:23:46,240
Dry and dead, I guess.

1731
01:23:46,240 --> 01:23:49,240
It's still weird that they're near it.

1732
01:23:49,240 --> 01:23:50,240
Yeah.

1733
01:23:50,240 --> 01:23:52,240
Without masks.

1734
01:23:53,240 --> 01:23:57,240
I guess this is their way to try and replicate the feel

1735
01:23:57,240 --> 01:24:01,240
of unease of entering a bungled environment

1736
01:24:01,240 --> 01:24:03,240
without having the breathable spores.

1737
01:24:03,240 --> 01:24:04,240
Yeah.

1738
01:24:04,240 --> 01:24:05,240
I guess.

1739
01:24:05,240 --> 01:24:06,240
Yeah.

1740
01:24:08,240 --> 01:24:10,240
Again, I don't see, no, no,

1741
01:24:10,240 --> 01:24:12,240
I do see the point of why they did remove the mask.

1742
01:24:12,240 --> 01:24:16,240
It's because Pablo Escobar there needs to be visualized.

1743
01:24:16,240 --> 01:24:17,240
Yep.

1744
01:24:17,240 --> 01:24:18,240
Congratulations.

1745
01:24:18,240 --> 01:24:20,240
That's why we have the unnecessary flashbacks

1746
01:24:20,240 --> 01:24:23,240
that add really nothing, but just exposition.

1747
01:24:23,240 --> 01:24:26,240
You know, at least the environments look good again.

1748
01:24:26,240 --> 01:24:27,240
Yeah.

1749
01:24:27,240 --> 01:24:30,240
Covered in the fungus, it looks like it's infected.

1750
01:24:30,240 --> 01:24:32,240
It's weird without the masks and, you know,

1751
01:24:32,240 --> 01:24:34,240
having to worry about that.

1752
01:24:34,240 --> 01:24:35,240
The Boston Tea Party,

1753
01:24:35,240 --> 01:24:37,240
where a bunch of Americans dressed up in blackface

1754
01:24:37,240 --> 01:24:39,240
and threw British tea overboard.

1755
01:24:39,240 --> 01:24:41,240
They're pretty based.

1756
01:24:45,240 --> 01:24:47,240
Yeah, clickers.

1757
01:24:51,240 --> 01:24:54,240
I've been attacked by one and it wasn't like that.

1758
01:24:56,240 --> 01:25:00,240
Okay, from this point forward, we are silent,

1759
01:25:00,240 --> 01:25:04,240
not quiet, silent, well, no question.

1760
01:25:04,240 --> 01:25:06,240
You're still whispering, though.

1761
01:25:06,240 --> 01:25:07,240
Ah, yes.

1762
01:25:07,240 --> 01:25:08,240
Old wooden stairs.

1763
01:25:08,240 --> 01:25:11,240
The quietest approach ever.

1764
01:25:11,240 --> 01:25:12,240
Well, what do you want?

1765
01:25:12,240 --> 01:25:14,240
You want them to fly up there?

1766
01:25:14,240 --> 01:25:15,240
True.

1767
01:25:15,240 --> 01:25:18,240
They don't have much of a choice, but...

1768
01:25:18,240 --> 01:25:20,240
It's like he kind of undivides this whole thing.

1769
01:25:20,240 --> 01:25:22,240
Like, we're gonna be quiet, not here, not...

1770
01:25:22,240 --> 01:25:24,240
Hmm, cannons.

1771
01:25:25,240 --> 01:25:28,240
And this is where you unlock the shotgun.

1772
01:25:33,240 --> 01:25:35,240
From Fallout 4.

1773
01:25:37,240 --> 01:25:39,240
You know, houses don't behave like that.

1774
01:25:39,240 --> 01:25:41,240
They don't just randomly go,

1775
01:25:41,240 --> 01:25:43,240
eh, I'm gonna collapse now.

1776
01:25:43,240 --> 01:25:45,240
Yeah, it's like a slow process.

1777
01:25:46,240 --> 01:25:48,240
Oh, there it is.

1778
01:25:48,240 --> 01:25:50,240
Oh, my God, what was that?

1779
01:25:50,240 --> 01:25:51,240
It was data.

1780
01:25:51,240 --> 01:25:53,240
A zombie.

1781
01:25:53,240 --> 01:25:55,240
Yup, there's the clickies.

1782
01:25:55,240 --> 01:25:56,240
Yep.

1783
01:25:56,240 --> 01:25:59,240
The reason they click is because they use echolocation,

1784
01:25:59,240 --> 01:26:01,240
because they can't see.

1785
01:26:01,240 --> 01:26:04,240
No, that's not the case, Dev.

1786
01:26:04,240 --> 01:26:06,240
That's not how echolocation works.

1787
01:26:06,240 --> 01:26:09,240
Yeah, but that's how it works in the game.

1788
01:26:09,240 --> 01:26:10,240
And also...

1789
01:26:10,240 --> 01:26:12,240
That's not how this works.

1790
01:26:12,240 --> 01:26:13,240
And the reason they can't see

1791
01:26:13,240 --> 01:26:16,240
is because they're really sensitive to light now.

1792
01:26:16,240 --> 01:26:19,240
After they've been affected for this long.

1793
01:26:19,240 --> 01:26:21,240
Yep, their face is just a big mushroom now.

1794
01:26:21,240 --> 01:26:23,240
Are they immune to bullets?

1795
01:26:23,240 --> 01:26:25,240
Nope.

1796
01:26:25,240 --> 01:26:27,240
It takes a lot of them.

1797
01:26:27,240 --> 01:26:30,240
Remember, shooting a gun in a city filled with zamboos.

1798
01:26:30,240 --> 01:26:34,240
Also, if you're fighting an echolocative enemy,

1799
01:26:34,240 --> 01:26:36,240
you don't want to be shooting.

1800
01:26:36,240 --> 01:26:37,240
Actually, you do.

1801
01:26:37,240 --> 01:26:39,240
Do you? Why?

1802
01:26:39,240 --> 01:26:42,240
Because it'll blow out their fucking ears.

1803
01:26:42,240 --> 01:26:44,240
No, no, not really.

1804
01:26:44,240 --> 01:26:45,240
No, they will.

1805
01:26:45,240 --> 01:26:47,240
Why do you think sonar stops working

1806
01:26:47,240 --> 01:26:50,240
when there's like death charges nearby?

1807
01:26:50,240 --> 01:26:51,240
Oh, fair enough, eh?

1808
01:26:51,240 --> 01:26:54,240
I mean, in the game, if you shoot, they all just charge you.

1809
01:26:54,240 --> 01:26:55,240
So...

1810
01:27:02,240 --> 01:27:04,240
Watch where you're running, man.

1811
01:27:04,240 --> 01:27:06,240
It's like those enemies in Resident Evil

1812
01:27:06,240 --> 01:27:09,240
where you got to hit gongs to make them run around.

1813
01:27:09,240 --> 01:27:10,240
Oh god, I remember this.

1814
01:27:10,240 --> 01:27:13,240
Zoom in so that you can't see the zombie getting closer.

1815
01:27:13,240 --> 01:27:15,240
That way, when the zombie suddenly appears,

1816
01:27:15,240 --> 01:27:18,240
Kyle will be frightened and scream like a woman.

1817
01:27:18,240 --> 01:27:20,240
Here we go.

1818
01:27:20,240 --> 01:27:21,240
Hi.

1819
01:27:24,240 --> 01:27:26,240
Eh, less of a jump scare than I expected.

1820
01:27:26,240 --> 01:27:27,240
I actually kind of appreciate the fact

1821
01:27:27,240 --> 01:27:29,240
they're trying to build the atmosphere

1822
01:27:29,240 --> 01:27:31,240
instead of simply just a boop.

1823
01:27:31,240 --> 01:27:33,240
Luckily, the ancient wooden floor

1824
01:27:33,240 --> 01:27:35,240
has stopped creaking at this point.

1825
01:27:35,240 --> 01:27:37,240
The topic of Kyle being a woman,

1826
01:27:37,240 --> 01:27:40,240
why do you keep drawing yourself with boobs

1827
01:27:40,240 --> 01:27:43,240
and pregnant and womb tattoos?

1828
01:27:43,240 --> 01:27:44,240
Kibs, you've got to tell us something.

1829
01:27:44,240 --> 01:27:46,240
What's going on here?

1830
01:27:46,240 --> 01:27:47,240
It's not my fault.

1831
01:27:47,240 --> 01:27:49,240
I can't control the artists.

1832
01:27:50,240 --> 01:27:52,240
The fan art of you being a girl?

1833
01:27:52,240 --> 01:27:54,240
It's out of control.

1834
01:27:54,240 --> 01:27:55,240
Oh.

1835
01:27:58,240 --> 01:28:00,240
I'm going to kill a sperm zombie.

1836
01:28:02,240 --> 01:28:05,240
I feel like the gut shots aren't really working, my dude.

1837
01:28:05,240 --> 01:28:07,240
There you go.

1838
01:28:07,240 --> 01:28:08,240
There we go.

1839
01:28:08,240 --> 01:28:13,240
You've got to blow off the giant mushroom on their heads.

1840
01:28:16,240 --> 01:28:18,240
And there you go.

1841
01:28:18,240 --> 01:28:20,240
It seems like head shots do just fine,

1842
01:28:20,240 --> 01:28:21,240
so it seems like the best way to deal with them

1843
01:28:21,240 --> 01:28:22,240
is to walk up to one,

1844
01:28:22,240 --> 01:28:26,240
rest the .357 against their heads, and boom.

1845
01:28:26,240 --> 01:28:29,240
Well, they're lucky that there's only two.

1846
01:28:29,240 --> 01:28:31,240
Yeah, when there's a lot of them, you're kind of fucked.

1847
01:28:31,240 --> 01:28:33,240
Are you fucking kidding me?

1848
01:28:35,240 --> 01:28:38,240
And again, I mean, if it was going to happen to one of us.

1849
01:28:40,240 --> 01:28:41,240
It's fair.

1850
01:28:41,240 --> 01:28:42,240
Yeah.

1851
01:28:42,240 --> 01:28:45,240
So do these zombies react to noise?

1852
01:28:45,240 --> 01:28:46,240
Is that it is?

1853
01:28:46,240 --> 01:28:47,240
Because.

1854
01:28:47,240 --> 01:28:48,240
Yep.

1855
01:28:48,240 --> 01:28:49,240
I do.

1856
01:28:49,240 --> 01:28:50,240
I don't seem to.

1857
01:28:50,240 --> 01:28:51,240
In the game, you can like.

1858
01:28:51,240 --> 01:28:52,240
You can use noises.

1859
01:28:52,240 --> 01:28:53,240
Yeah.

1860
01:28:53,240 --> 01:28:54,240
No, it looks scary.

1861
01:28:54,240 --> 01:28:56,240
That was scary.

1862
01:28:56,240 --> 01:28:57,240
This is wood.

1863
01:28:59,240 --> 01:29:00,240
OK, child.

1864
01:29:00,240 --> 01:29:01,240
Just wait there.

1865
01:29:01,240 --> 01:29:02,240
You're falling.

1866
01:29:02,240 --> 01:29:03,240
Give us a minute.

1867
01:29:03,240 --> 01:29:04,240
Let's go.

1868
01:29:04,240 --> 01:29:05,240
Go watch it.

1869
01:29:10,240 --> 01:29:12,240
Pedro thinks you're being a bit fucking snappy.

1870
01:29:15,240 --> 01:29:17,240
This is actually the way it was in the game, too.

1871
01:29:17,240 --> 01:29:21,240
She was in charge and he was kind of being ordered around

1872
01:29:21,240 --> 01:29:23,240
and was kind of a big old grump about everything.

1873
01:29:27,240 --> 01:29:28,240
Hey, Collin.

1874
01:29:28,240 --> 01:29:29,240
Yep.

1875
01:29:29,240 --> 01:29:33,240
OK, is this where the trip wires start coming in?

1876
01:29:33,240 --> 01:29:36,240
Well, I can't remember.

1877
01:29:36,240 --> 01:29:39,240
Lilith, how about you?

1878
01:29:39,240 --> 01:29:41,240
Because, like, this looks like a level from the game,

1879
01:29:41,240 --> 01:29:43,240
Kibbs and Lilith, if you remember.

1880
01:29:43,240 --> 01:29:44,240
This is.

1881
01:29:44,240 --> 01:29:45,240
Yeah.

1882
01:29:45,240 --> 01:29:48,240
There was a trip wire between the front of the truck

1883
01:29:48,240 --> 01:29:50,240
and the car in the background.

1884
01:29:50,240 --> 01:29:54,240
They positioned it like exactly like the level was.

1885
01:29:54,240 --> 01:29:57,240
There's such incredible attention to detail.

1886
01:29:57,240 --> 01:29:59,240
Probably almost too much, you know.

1887
01:30:03,240 --> 01:30:04,240
Not enough.

1888
01:30:04,240 --> 01:30:05,240
Halo.

1889
01:30:05,240 --> 01:30:06,240
Yeah, fuck.

1890
01:30:06,240 --> 01:30:07,240
Or like Kenobi or whatever.

1891
01:30:07,240 --> 01:30:08,240
Fuck.

1892
01:30:08,240 --> 01:30:09,240
Holy shit.

1893
01:30:09,240 --> 01:30:12,240
So many bad shows and movies out there.

1894
01:30:16,240 --> 01:30:17,240
Oh, hey, look.

1895
01:30:17,240 --> 01:30:18,240
There's a shotgun.

1896
01:30:18,240 --> 01:30:20,240
He can unlock it now.

1897
01:30:20,240 --> 01:30:22,240
That's something, right?

1898
01:30:22,240 --> 01:30:25,240
Our luck had to run out sooner or later.

1899
01:30:25,240 --> 01:30:27,240
All right, here we go.

1900
01:30:27,240 --> 01:30:29,240
Fuck.

1901
01:30:29,240 --> 01:30:30,240
He's infected.

1902
01:30:30,240 --> 01:30:31,240
Oh, fuck.

1903
01:30:35,240 --> 01:30:36,240
He's sleeping now.

1904
01:30:47,240 --> 01:30:48,240
Yeah, it's moving.

1905
01:30:48,240 --> 01:30:51,240
They all know, baby.

1906
01:30:51,240 --> 01:30:52,240
This is new, by the way.

1907
01:30:52,240 --> 01:30:53,240
This is new.

1908
01:30:53,240 --> 01:30:56,240
Yes, this is new.

1909
01:30:56,240 --> 01:30:58,240
So, gunshots, no big deal.

1910
01:30:58,240 --> 01:31:01,240
But the Myconial Network?

1911
01:31:01,240 --> 01:31:03,240
Well.

1912
01:31:03,240 --> 01:31:07,240
Yeah, I'm not sure I feel less than that.

1913
01:31:07,240 --> 01:31:11,240
Well, I think in the game, like, it's soldiers that chase them.

1914
01:31:11,240 --> 01:31:13,240
Yeah, soldiers show up here, yeah.

1915
01:31:13,240 --> 01:31:16,240
And you have to fight off a bunch of human enemies.

1916
01:31:17,240 --> 01:31:19,240
Now it's zombies.

1917
01:31:19,240 --> 01:31:21,240
Because Federer does show up.

1918
01:31:21,240 --> 01:31:22,240
Yeah.

1919
01:31:22,240 --> 01:31:23,240
All of them.

1920
01:31:23,240 --> 01:31:24,240
Maybe a minute.

1921
01:31:24,240 --> 01:31:30,240
Interestingly, they seem to be going more for the idea of the main characters being human.

1922
01:31:30,240 --> 01:31:33,240
Like, they're not vilifying Federer.

1923
01:31:33,240 --> 01:31:34,240
Yeah.

1924
01:31:37,240 --> 01:31:38,240
What are you doing?

1925
01:31:38,240 --> 01:31:40,240
Making sure that they don't follow you.

1926
01:31:40,240 --> 01:31:43,240
I mean, even in the game, Federer wasn't, quote, unquote, evil.

1927
01:31:43,240 --> 01:31:45,240
They were doing what they had to do to survive.

1928
01:31:45,240 --> 01:31:47,240
Yeah, you were killing them by the dozen, I bet.

1929
01:31:47,240 --> 01:31:48,240
You were.

1930
01:31:48,240 --> 01:31:49,240
You were.

1931
01:31:49,240 --> 01:31:51,240
I mean, they were also pretty...

1932
01:31:51,240 --> 01:31:54,240
They were sometimes a bit too far.

1933
01:31:54,240 --> 01:31:58,240
They still, like, indiscriminately, you know, hung people in the town square.

1934
01:31:58,240 --> 01:32:00,240
Say who you can say.

1935
01:32:00,240 --> 01:32:01,240
Well, criminals.

1936
01:32:01,240 --> 01:32:03,240
But we didn't know.

1937
01:32:03,240 --> 01:32:05,240
Yeah, communist dev criminals.

1938
01:32:05,240 --> 01:32:08,240
Yeah, they were military court, you know.

1939
01:32:08,240 --> 01:32:09,240
Pretty fair and balanced.

1940
01:32:09,240 --> 01:32:11,240
Yeah.

1941
01:32:11,240 --> 01:32:13,240
Dev's like, I don't believe this.

1942
01:32:13,240 --> 01:32:17,240
Oh, okay, that's different.

1943
01:32:17,240 --> 01:32:18,240
Yeah, this isn't...

1944
01:32:18,240 --> 01:32:20,240
Didn't she just kill herself, if I remember right?

1945
01:32:20,240 --> 01:32:21,240
Yeah, she shot herself.

1946
01:32:21,240 --> 01:32:23,240
There was no, like, heroic standoff.

1947
01:32:23,240 --> 01:32:25,240
No, she fought off the soldiers, and then...

1948
01:32:25,240 --> 01:32:26,240
Oh, that's right, yeah, yeah.

1949
01:32:26,240 --> 01:32:31,240
She killed, I believe, two, and then she got killed by the soldiers afterwards.

1950
01:32:31,240 --> 01:32:33,240
Right, right, right.

1951
01:32:33,240 --> 01:32:40,240
As the player, you actually get a chance to ambush the soldiers afterwards and get revenge for the test.

1952
01:32:40,240 --> 01:32:42,240
Or you could just run away.

1953
01:32:43,240 --> 01:32:46,240
Alright, you better do it.

1954
01:32:50,240 --> 01:32:52,240
Oh, come on.

1955
01:32:57,240 --> 01:32:59,240
You gotta do it now, dude.

1956
01:33:01,240 --> 01:33:05,240
Don't worry, a lighter isn't hot enough to touch off that shield anyways.

1957
01:33:05,240 --> 01:33:07,240
It's not?

1958
01:33:07,240 --> 01:33:09,240
Nope.

1959
01:33:13,240 --> 01:33:15,240
Oh.

1960
01:33:17,240 --> 01:33:20,240
Well, TV show. You don't need to do that.

1961
01:33:20,240 --> 01:33:21,240
Oh, okay, thank you.

1962
01:33:21,240 --> 01:33:23,240
Oh, that's a bit fucking weird.

1963
01:33:23,240 --> 01:33:25,240
Yeah, thanks.

1964
01:33:29,240 --> 01:33:32,240
Somebody's masturbating right now, I swear to God.

1965
01:33:32,240 --> 01:33:34,240
Somebody somewhere.

1966
01:33:36,240 --> 01:33:38,240
That's a bit gross.

1967
01:33:38,240 --> 01:33:42,240
Also, that's not how a hand-degrainer's cook off either, but never mind, details, details.

1968
01:33:42,240 --> 01:33:44,240
But yeah, a lot of that scene was the same.

1969
01:33:44,240 --> 01:33:47,240
Like, her revealing that she had been bit, the whole thing.

1970
01:33:47,240 --> 01:33:49,240
No, definitely.

1971
01:33:49,240 --> 01:33:53,240
The whole sacrifice and the weir of kissing.

1972
01:33:53,240 --> 01:33:57,240
The end was different, but most of the scene was the same.

1973
01:34:08,240 --> 01:34:23,240
Wow, so there we go.

1974
01:34:23,240 --> 01:34:26,240
Episodes one and two down the hatch.

1975
01:34:26,240 --> 01:34:29,240
I'm stunned at how good it was.

1976
01:34:29,240 --> 01:34:32,240
I was expecting complete and total nonsense.

1977
01:34:32,240 --> 01:34:34,240
No, that was actually pretty good.

1978
01:34:34,240 --> 01:34:37,240
The changes that they made, well, some were a bit strange.

1979
01:34:37,240 --> 01:34:41,240
I think the kiss was probably requested by the actress.

1980
01:34:41,240 --> 01:34:45,240
She probably wanted to go out in a weird but memorable way.

1981
01:34:45,240 --> 01:34:48,240
Yeah, maybe not the kiss itself, but the actual...

1982
01:34:48,240 --> 01:34:50,240
Maybe, I don't know.

1983
01:34:50,240 --> 01:34:53,240
The actual sacrificing yourself to stop the zombie horde thing.

1984
01:34:53,240 --> 01:35:02,240
And again, I actually quite appreciate the fact that they're making the characters not psychotic murder hobos, as they were in the game.

1985
01:35:02,240 --> 01:35:03,240
Yes.

1986
01:35:03,240 --> 01:35:05,240
That's actually a good change.

1987
01:35:05,240 --> 01:35:10,240
I'm not that wowed by the show itself, like the whole pacing, etc.

1988
01:35:10,240 --> 01:35:12,240
It's kind of slow, it's kind of meh.

1989
01:35:12,240 --> 01:35:16,240
I'm frankly not that invested in this supposed child.

1990
01:35:16,240 --> 01:35:24,240
But the simple fact that it's not awful is already much...

1991
01:35:24,240 --> 01:35:32,240
See, for me, one, it's the fact that they actually are following the game as much as they are, which is a miracle in this day and age.

1992
01:35:32,240 --> 01:35:40,240
But as you say, for the show itself, Ellie's not nearly as interesting as she was in the game, but Joel is still pretty interesting.

1993
01:35:40,240 --> 01:35:42,240
Joel is about as interesting as he was.

1994
01:35:42,240 --> 01:35:51,240
It's going to be interesting to see how they go forward, because the thing that's going to make or break the show is the interaction between Joel and Ellie is the same way as it was in the video game.

1995
01:35:51,240 --> 01:35:56,240
Because it was their interactions that sold the game.

1996
01:35:56,240 --> 01:36:00,240
Yeah, the entire premise of the game was based on their relationship.

1997
01:36:00,240 --> 01:36:04,240
And if they don't do that right, then there is no Last of Us.

1998
01:36:04,240 --> 01:36:09,240
Still, I'm surprised. I mean, I expected to only be watching bad stuff on this channel, you know?

1999
01:36:09,240 --> 01:36:13,240
And here we are, watching at least an okay to decent show.

2000
01:36:13,240 --> 01:36:17,240
I'm okay with that. We don't always have to be hit watching Trainwreck.

2001
01:36:17,240 --> 01:36:21,240
I mean, we're not watching a shitty Velma show, at least.

2002
01:36:21,240 --> 01:36:27,240
Hold on. We should start Velma. We should change gears and switch over to Velma instead.

2003
01:36:27,240 --> 01:36:32,240
The show's been shitty enough, we must torture ourselves.

2004
01:36:32,240 --> 01:36:39,240
Naomi is like, Dev, do you want to watch Velma with me? And I'm like, listen, there's no good answer to this question.

2005
01:36:39,240 --> 01:36:43,240
Because either I'm watching Velma or you think I don't want to spend time with you.

2006
01:36:43,240 --> 01:36:51,240
Don't worry. Just the first episode. I think she'll change her mind.

2007
01:36:51,240 --> 01:36:53,240
Well, final thoughts then, everyone?

2008
01:36:53,240 --> 01:37:00,240
I think it's pretty good. I mean, they changed some stuff from the game, obviously, but nobody expected a one-to-one recreation.

2009
01:37:00,240 --> 01:37:04,240
But what they did recreate was actually fairly faithful.

2010
01:37:04,240 --> 01:37:13,240
They created the major sceneries, the major vistas, and the major plot points, for the most part.

2011
01:37:13,240 --> 01:37:19,240
Of course, with some changes, which just makes things a little bit more interesting.

2012
01:37:19,240 --> 01:37:28,240
I find it very interesting that they changed the dates to make it before without explicitly stating it.

2013
01:37:28,240 --> 01:37:35,240
Or saying it to your face, like, this is what we're doing, and this is 2013, guys.

2014
01:37:35,240 --> 01:37:42,240
Oh, this is what would happen if something happened 10 years ago. I don't know how much that would change.

2015
01:37:42,240 --> 01:37:45,240
Yeah, I'm not sure why they did that. I'm not sure why they did that.

2016
01:37:45,240 --> 01:37:50,240
In the original game, the past was set in 2013, because 2013 was the year the game came out.

2017
01:37:50,240 --> 01:37:57,240
And then the present was 2033. And now, the past is 2003, and the present is 2023, which is our current year.

2018
01:37:57,240 --> 01:38:01,240
So I guess they wanted to make it relatable somehow, either way.

2019
01:38:01,240 --> 01:38:04,240
But I'm not sure why they made that change.

2020
01:38:04,240 --> 01:38:07,240
It doesn't really change that much.

2021
01:38:07,240 --> 01:38:12,240
It was fairly faithful to the video game. There are some weird, unnecessary changes.

2022
01:38:12,240 --> 01:38:18,240
Like, if they just didn't do the fungal retcon thing, I think the show would be a little better,

2023
01:38:18,240 --> 01:38:21,240
because it would be more faithful to the original source material.

2024
01:38:21,240 --> 01:38:27,240
I think Arch is correct. I think that the whole reason for the change was down to the actor not wanting to have his face covered up.

2025
01:38:27,240 --> 01:38:34,240
But again, I still have to beg the question, like, the gas masks that Joel wear, you could just use a different one where you can see their face.

2026
01:38:35,240 --> 01:38:37,240
It's not that big of a deal.

2027
01:38:37,240 --> 01:38:42,240
I also don't think Joel wears the gas masks throughout the entire game anyways.

2028
01:38:42,240 --> 01:38:44,240
Only parts of it. In parts of it, yeah.

2029
01:38:44,240 --> 01:38:47,240
But it's only, it's very small sections in the game.

2030
01:38:47,240 --> 01:38:52,240
He does when, like, their room is, like, fumigated with the spores.

2031
01:38:52,240 --> 01:38:53,240
Yeah, yeah.

2032
01:38:53,240 --> 01:38:58,240
He does a couple points in the game, and that's, honestly, I think that's the thing that bugs me the most,

2033
01:38:58,240 --> 01:39:02,240
is because, like, it's such a little thing, it's like, you know, he could have just worn the mask,

2034
01:39:02,240 --> 01:39:07,240
and those sections were short, and in this show, they skip most of those combat sequences anyways,

2035
01:39:07,240 --> 01:39:12,240
and so those gas mask, quote-unquote, sections would have been incredibly short.

2036
01:39:13,240 --> 01:39:14,240
Yeah.

2037
01:39:14,240 --> 01:39:25,240
Oh, yeah. In, like, the game itself, there was even a section where they find, like, a smuggler with his mask broken,

2038
01:39:25,240 --> 01:39:29,240
and you have to either put him out of his misery or leave him to suffer.

2039
01:39:29,240 --> 01:39:31,240
Yep, that was a cool moral laundry.

2040
01:39:31,240 --> 01:39:32,240
Yeah.

2041
01:39:32,240 --> 01:39:35,240
Oh, you're right, Lilith, I completely forgot about that sequence.

2042
01:39:35,240 --> 01:39:37,240
That wasn't even in the game. Or in the show.

2043
01:39:37,240 --> 01:39:38,240
Yeah, in the show, yeah.

2044
01:39:38,240 --> 01:39:44,240
That was, I think, like, the reason why they didn't do it in a show is because, like,

2045
01:39:44,240 --> 01:39:50,240
oh, then the audience is gonna question why aren't they wearing masks or in sections where they should be.

2046
01:39:50,240 --> 01:39:56,240
It might have to do with the fact that masks right now are also a delicate social thing, because...

2047
01:39:56,240 --> 01:39:58,240
I don't think that's it.

2048
01:39:58,240 --> 01:39:59,240
No?

2049
01:39:59,240 --> 01:40:01,240
I can actually enlarge the argument for this.

2050
01:40:01,240 --> 01:40:04,240
These aren't little masks. These are, like, gas masks.

2051
01:40:04,240 --> 01:40:06,240
Yeah, yeah, yeah, but masks are masked.

2052
01:40:06,240 --> 01:40:09,240
I don't think that was the reason at all.

2053
01:40:09,240 --> 01:40:11,240
Well, let's see Arch's logic, though. Let's see Arch's logic.

2054
01:40:11,240 --> 01:40:19,240
The show so far has been studiously inoffensive to our point of view.

2055
01:40:19,240 --> 01:40:24,240
In fact, it's been studiously inoffensive to any point of view. It's simply been a retelling.

2056
01:40:24,240 --> 01:40:25,240
Yep.

2057
01:40:25,240 --> 01:40:30,240
That makes me think, they seem to be going out of their way to do this,

2058
01:40:30,240 --> 01:40:35,240
and if the objective is to create good television that people want to watch,

2059
01:40:35,240 --> 01:40:39,240
that avoids all of the current eardrama, et cetera,

2060
01:40:39,240 --> 01:40:45,240
they probably would want to avoid the mask thing too, just even the inference or suggestion of it,

2061
01:40:45,240 --> 01:40:47,240
because that was a big deal.

2062
01:40:47,240 --> 01:40:51,240
I feel like leaving it out raises more questions.

2063
01:40:51,240 --> 01:40:53,240
Exactly, though, but that's the thing.

2064
01:40:53,240 --> 01:40:56,240
Leaving it out raises more questions for the law.

2065
01:40:56,240 --> 01:41:01,240
The only reason to remove it is either, a, Pedro Pascal and his ego is a word like,

2066
01:41:01,240 --> 01:41:05,240
well, I have to wear a mask for, like, five minutes in two hours of TV show,

2067
01:41:05,240 --> 01:41:10,240
which, I can see it, but I'm also like, that's weird.

2068
01:41:10,240 --> 01:41:14,240
Removing the masks is still a bad thing.

2069
01:41:14,240 --> 01:41:17,240
Because they had to work in two scenes,

2070
01:41:17,240 --> 01:41:20,240
one mask of exposition dump at the beginning that was completely unnecessary,

2071
01:41:20,240 --> 01:41:26,240
and then an entire flashback sequence to characters that don't matter in Jakarta,

2072
01:41:26,240 --> 01:41:29,240
to just simply explain the whole fungal thing again.

2073
01:41:29,240 --> 01:41:33,240
And these scenes were disjointed, they weren't necessary,

2074
01:41:33,240 --> 01:41:36,240
and they were there to try to justify the reason for its existence.

2075
01:41:36,240 --> 01:41:39,240
And in the show, before the show went live,

2076
01:41:39,240 --> 01:41:41,240
the writers and the runners actually talked about,

2077
01:41:41,240 --> 01:41:44,240
oh, the audience, we're doing things this differently,

2078
01:41:44,240 --> 01:41:47,240
and it's going to be a big deal, it's going to be really cool.

2079
01:41:47,240 --> 01:41:50,240
And so far, the only payoff has been, there's little tendrils that come out of their mouth,

2080
01:41:50,240 --> 01:41:55,240
and there's like a really gross kiss scene that just was kind of like,

2081
01:41:55,240 --> 01:41:58,240
ooh, that's just gross. I mean, the zombies are supposed to be gross,

2082
01:41:58,240 --> 01:42:03,240
but that was just a completely different field of weird.

2083
01:42:03,240 --> 01:42:08,240
There's one final thing that I think we should touch on real briefly before we end off the night.

2084
01:42:08,240 --> 01:42:13,240
Usually, when we talk about a show on my channel or your channel or someone else,

2085
01:42:13,240 --> 01:42:18,240
Gundam or Critical Drinker or Mauler or whoever talks about shows in this way,

2086
01:42:18,240 --> 01:42:25,240
I've noticed that a core component of the conversation is the social media backlash,

2087
01:42:25,240 --> 01:42:27,240
because the show is bad, right?

2088
01:42:27,240 --> 01:42:33,240
With Kenobi, it was Riva, with Lord of the Rings, it was the Black Elf,

2089
01:42:33,240 --> 01:42:35,240
but it was really fucking everything, right?

2090
01:42:35,240 --> 01:42:37,240
There's a lot of that shit, and people say,

2091
01:42:37,240 --> 01:42:40,240
well, you just hate the show because you're racist,

2092
01:42:40,240 --> 01:42:43,240
and some people are just racist, and some people,

2093
01:42:43,240 --> 01:42:47,240
they're like, well, why did you have to race swap this character?

2094
01:42:47,240 --> 01:42:52,240
You saw a lot of posts like this, where people were complaining that Joel's daughter

2095
01:42:52,240 --> 01:42:57,240
was changed from a white blonde girl to a half-black girl with frizzy hair.

2096
01:42:57,240 --> 01:43:00,240
Complaint, if we're going to remove the racist aspect of it,

2097
01:43:00,240 --> 01:43:02,240
because I'm sure some of them were just racist,

2098
01:43:02,240 --> 01:43:08,240
but the actual substance of the complaint is that Joel is supposed to be reminded

2099
01:43:08,240 --> 01:43:12,240
of his daughter when he sees Ellie, so they're supposed to look somewhat similar,

2100
01:43:12,240 --> 01:43:17,240
and the two actresses they got in this show look nothing alike.

2101
01:43:17,240 --> 01:43:21,240
It is a pointless change. It does not improve the story in any way.

2102
01:43:21,240 --> 01:43:29,240
It only damages it, but she's only in the show for a little bit and then dies.

2103
01:43:29,240 --> 01:43:30,240
Yes.

2104
01:43:30,240 --> 01:43:32,240
It's not a big deal.

2105
01:43:32,240 --> 01:43:35,240
Meanwhile, Aaron Deere is shoved in your fucking face every five seconds,

2106
01:43:35,240 --> 01:43:40,240
and when the entire show is bad, it is easy to focus on the bad parts of it,

2107
01:43:40,240 --> 01:43:44,240
whereas here, again, he's a race swap daughter, she's there,

2108
01:43:44,240 --> 01:43:47,240
she goes through the motions, then she dies, and it's like, okay, that was it,

2109
01:43:47,240 --> 01:43:50,240
and every other character seems to be okay, so...

2110
01:43:50,240 --> 01:43:54,240
And you know what? She was still a competent actress.

2111
01:43:54,240 --> 01:43:57,240
She still did the job of playing the character very well.

2112
01:43:57,240 --> 01:44:01,240
So far I say she did a better job than Ellie.

2113
01:44:01,240 --> 01:44:04,240
Yeah, she actually did a pretty good job.

2114
01:44:04,240 --> 01:44:13,240
I think my only complaint was that by changing her race to mixed or black,

2115
01:44:13,240 --> 01:44:18,240
they played into the trope of the black character dies first.

2116
01:44:18,240 --> 01:44:20,240
Oh, yeah, that's right, eh? Damn.

2117
01:44:20,240 --> 01:44:21,240
That's true.

2118
01:44:21,240 --> 01:44:26,240
There's also the weird... Okay, so watermelon in the fucking freezer.

2119
01:44:26,240 --> 01:44:30,240
He steals 20 bucks to fix his watch.

2120
01:44:30,240 --> 01:44:31,240
Wow.

2121
01:44:31,240 --> 01:44:35,240
Yeah, in the original game, there was no watermelon in the fridge,

2122
01:44:35,240 --> 01:44:41,240
and she saved up her money to fix the watch, and that was the gift.

2123
01:44:41,240 --> 01:44:42,240
It's...

2124
01:44:42,240 --> 01:44:44,240
That was a strange show.

2125
01:44:44,240 --> 01:44:46,240
Weird choices.

2126
01:44:46,240 --> 01:44:47,240
Yeah.

2127
01:44:47,240 --> 01:44:53,240
Let's make the one character we race swapped into a watermelon-eating thief.

2128
01:44:53,240 --> 01:44:55,240
Hmm.

2129
01:44:55,240 --> 01:44:56,240
I mean...

2130
01:44:56,240 --> 01:44:58,240
That's a bit strange.

2131
01:44:59,240 --> 01:45:03,240
It's most likely that the set dressers didn't even notice it.

2132
01:45:03,240 --> 01:45:07,240
Your racist spider senses are not as advanced as mine.

2133
01:45:07,240 --> 01:45:08,240
Yeah.

2134
01:45:08,240 --> 01:45:09,240
Maybe.

2135
01:45:09,240 --> 01:45:11,240
And I think the set dressers would have noticed it,

2136
01:45:11,240 --> 01:45:17,240
because who puts a full quarter watermelon slice just in the fridge?

2137
01:45:17,240 --> 01:45:19,240
You know what the worst part is?

2138
01:45:19,240 --> 01:45:21,240
I went back to the watermelon slice picture.

2139
01:45:21,240 --> 01:45:22,240
Yeah?

2140
01:45:22,240 --> 01:45:25,240
It's got fucking freezer burns on it.

2141
01:45:25,240 --> 01:45:28,240
It's been in there for years as they wait to do the shot.

2142
01:45:28,240 --> 01:45:34,240
Somebody requisitioned that thing ages in advance and had to put it in there.

2143
01:45:34,240 --> 01:45:36,240
You know what they're doing?

2144
01:45:36,240 --> 01:45:40,240
There was leftover chicken in there that his brother ate, was eating out of.

2145
01:45:40,240 --> 01:45:41,240
He has wings, yeah.

2146
01:45:41,240 --> 01:45:46,240
So it's entirely possible that they were trying to make it look like it's cozy,

2147
01:45:46,240 --> 01:45:50,240
or not cozy, but a little bit slobby in terms of the stuff that's there.

2148
01:45:50,240 --> 01:45:53,240
Because isn't Joel, if I remember right, he doesn't have...

2149
01:45:53,240 --> 01:45:56,240
His wife isn't with him anymore, or is dead.

2150
01:45:56,240 --> 01:45:57,240
Ah, no.

2151
01:45:57,240 --> 01:46:00,240
His wife left him and left the kid behind.

2152
01:46:00,240 --> 01:46:05,240
And so he's kind of a single dad, and so it's giving that single dad vibe.

2153
01:46:05,240 --> 01:46:10,240
A little bit unclean, a little bit rugged.

2154
01:46:10,240 --> 01:46:11,240
Ah, yes.

2155
01:46:11,240 --> 01:46:15,240
Single dads and their fucking random ass watermelons.

2156
01:46:15,240 --> 01:46:16,240
Also, wait, wait.

2157
01:46:16,240 --> 01:46:24,240
In race-swapping Joel's daughter, he must have had sex with a black woman who then abandoned her child.

2158
01:46:24,240 --> 01:46:26,240
That makes that a whole lot worse.

2159
01:46:26,240 --> 01:46:27,240
Jesus!

2160
01:46:27,240 --> 01:46:34,240
Yeah, because in the original lore of the game, Joel's wife walked out on him a year into their relationship,

2161
01:46:34,240 --> 01:46:35,240
and she just kept the kid.

2162
01:46:35,240 --> 01:46:41,240
So if that's the same lore, then she just up and left.

2163
01:46:41,240 --> 01:46:47,240
This is a win. I don't know if they think it's the win they think it is, but it is there.

2164
01:46:47,240 --> 01:46:51,240
Last of Us, turns out, is actually just hyper-based and red-pilled.

2165
01:46:51,240 --> 01:46:53,240
Watches Nick Fuentes every weekend.

2166
01:46:53,240 --> 01:46:55,240
I will say this too, though.

2167
01:46:55,240 --> 01:47:00,240
One thing I also noticed is the fucking stunt people in this show fucking went for it.

2168
01:47:00,240 --> 01:47:04,240
Like the scene where she tries to ambush Joel.

2169
01:47:04,240 --> 01:47:07,240
Pablo fucking chucks that little bitch.

2170
01:47:07,240 --> 01:47:10,240
The wall bulges from the impact.

2171
01:47:10,240 --> 01:47:16,240
And also the zombies that are running and crashing into things and jumping over everything and just falling all over the place, yeah.

2172
01:47:16,240 --> 01:47:20,240
Oh yeah, the actors are putting their entire zombussy into it.

2173
01:47:20,240 --> 01:47:21,240
Zombussy?

2174
01:47:21,240 --> 01:47:22,240
I'm a pussy.

2175
01:47:22,240 --> 01:47:24,240
Yeah.

2176
01:47:24,240 --> 01:47:28,240
It was a surprisingly decent show, which is weird.

2177
01:47:28,240 --> 01:47:30,240
It exists and it isn't complete garbage.

2178
01:47:30,240 --> 01:47:32,240
Yeah, I'm stunned.

2179
01:47:32,240 --> 01:47:35,240
Are we going to keep watching it every week, I guess?

2180
01:47:35,240 --> 01:47:38,240
Well, not that it's good. Is there any point?

2181
01:47:39,240 --> 01:47:40,240
Yeah, I was thinking that too.

2182
01:47:40,240 --> 01:47:42,240
We do gotta switch gears to Velma.

2183
01:47:42,240 --> 01:47:45,240
Well, for fuck's sake, you guys have problems.

2184
01:47:49,240 --> 01:47:52,240
Before it begins, goddammit, Kibbs, fix your mic.

2185
01:47:52,240 --> 01:47:54,240
Fix what?

2186
01:47:54,240 --> 01:47:57,240
Your mic keeps going off, like randomly.

2187
01:47:57,240 --> 01:47:59,240
You can just hear background noises all the time.

2188
01:47:59,240 --> 01:48:00,240
Really?

2189
01:48:00,240 --> 01:48:02,240
Yeah.

2190
01:48:02,240 --> 01:48:04,240
Wow, boomer.

2191
01:48:04,240 --> 01:48:06,240
I'm just gay with that shit.

2192
01:48:06,240 --> 01:48:09,240
You're pulling a Sargon right now.

2193
01:48:09,240 --> 01:48:11,240
Oh Jesus, that's fucking bad.

2194
01:48:11,240 --> 01:48:14,240
No, that's my feelings.

2195
01:48:14,240 --> 01:48:20,240
True, fungi cannot survive if its host's internal temperature is over 94 degrees.

2196
01:48:20,240 --> 01:48:22,240
And apparently there are no reasons for...

2197
01:48:22,240 --> 01:48:25,240
Kibbs, your mic is going crazy again. What happened?

2198
01:48:25,240 --> 01:48:26,240
I...

2199
01:48:26,240 --> 01:48:33,240
Oh God, for some reason I was like, why is there like a mammogram going off in the background?

2200
01:48:33,240 --> 01:48:34,240
Yeah.

2201
01:48:35,240 --> 01:48:38,240
And now he's quiet.

2202
01:48:38,240 --> 01:48:41,240
You're actually very quiet now, Jesus.

2203
01:48:41,240 --> 01:48:43,240
Really? How quiet? How do I do this?

2204
01:48:43,240 --> 01:48:47,240
I've cranked you up to 135 and I can barely hear you.

2205
01:48:53,240 --> 01:48:55,240
Climate change caused it.

2206
01:48:55,240 --> 01:48:58,240
Climate change has caused everything.

2207
01:48:59,240 --> 01:49:03,240
Kibbs, any one of them could become capable of borrowing into our brains and taking control...

2208
01:49:03,240 --> 01:49:05,240
Wait, Kibbs, are you still there?

2209
01:49:08,240 --> 01:49:10,240
Oh my God, dude.

2210
01:49:10,240 --> 01:49:13,240
What the fuck's going on with you today? Because I can barely hear you.

2211
01:49:17,240 --> 01:49:19,240
Is it just me?

2212
01:49:19,240 --> 01:49:21,240
No, he's just boomer.

2213
01:49:23,240 --> 01:49:27,240
It sounds like your volume is at 10%, man.

2214
01:49:28,240 --> 01:49:30,240
I haven't changed anything.

2215
01:49:32,240 --> 01:49:35,240
Maybe my stuff is starting to break, I don't know.

2216
01:49:35,240 --> 01:49:43,240
Go into your sound panel outside of Discord, like your Windows sound panel, and see what your mic levels are at.

2217
01:49:43,240 --> 01:49:46,240
I mean, it should be fine.

2218
01:49:46,240 --> 01:49:48,240
Crank that shit up, Kibbs.

2219
01:49:48,240 --> 01:49:50,240
Even louder.

2220
01:49:50,240 --> 01:49:52,240
How about now? Is that any better?

2221
01:49:52,240 --> 01:49:54,240
Jesus, what the fuck happened?

2222
01:49:54,240 --> 01:49:56,240
What, is it too loud now? I'll turn it down.

2223
01:49:56,240 --> 01:49:59,240
Not only is it too loud, all the background noise is back.

2224
01:49:59,240 --> 01:50:01,240
Is that any better? Is the background noise gone?

2225
01:50:01,240 --> 01:50:07,240
I set you to 200 and I can hear you now, but there's like a loud hum in the background whenever you talk.

2226
01:50:07,240 --> 01:50:10,240
No, it's not that loud. It's only kinda loud.

2227
01:50:13,240 --> 01:50:15,240
What's going on?

2228
01:50:15,240 --> 01:50:17,240
I can't hear it now.

2229
01:50:17,240 --> 01:50:21,240
That sounds like it might be an improperly seated audio cable, so try like...

2230
01:50:21,240 --> 01:50:24,240
Do you use XLR connections for your mics?

2231
01:50:26,240 --> 01:50:30,240
I can't even understand you at this point. It's all just humming.

2232
01:50:30,240 --> 01:50:38,240
What you should do is unplug your XLR connectors, give them a little dust off, and plug them back in.

2233
01:50:43,240 --> 01:50:45,240
Are you back?

2234
01:50:45,240 --> 01:50:47,240
Should be.

2235
01:50:47,240 --> 01:50:49,240
It sounds the exact same.

2236
01:50:49,240 --> 01:50:59,240
Wiggle the cord at the end of the connector and talk at the same time. Try doing that for each end.

2237
01:50:59,240 --> 01:51:01,240
Yeah, anything here?

2238
01:51:01,240 --> 01:51:03,240
Nope.

2239
01:51:03,240 --> 01:51:05,240
How about here?

2240
01:51:05,240 --> 01:51:11,240
That's it. That's the broken one. You probably have a break in your XLR cable.

2241
01:51:11,240 --> 01:51:13,240
Okay, well...

2242
01:51:15,240 --> 01:51:17,240
Get a replacement.

2243
01:51:18,240 --> 01:51:24,240
Okay, so chat. Did you tell your chat the story of what happened today? Of your failure, Kibs?

2244
01:51:24,240 --> 01:51:27,240
How you were an hour late and then your cable didn't work?

2245
01:51:27,240 --> 01:51:31,240
I told them in Galactic Sibs stream, I was like, so I showed up, I was like, hey Dev, how you doing?

2246
01:51:31,240 --> 01:51:36,240
Dev's like, I'm a homosexual. Okay, you know, that's cool for you. I'm not judging.

2247
01:51:36,240 --> 01:51:41,240
Tell them how that went down, and then my mic stopped working because Dev was being fat and very loud.

2248
01:51:41,240 --> 01:51:43,240
That's how it happened, eh?

2249
01:51:44,240 --> 01:51:47,240
It caused me to fall on my microphone and bump the cable.

2250
01:51:47,240 --> 01:51:53,240
Firstly, I've had XLR cables fail in that exact way before, so I recognized the sound as soon as I heard it.

2251
01:51:53,240 --> 01:51:56,240
I was like, Kibs, your XLR is fucked up.

2252
01:51:56,240 --> 01:52:00,240
I'm actually glad you noticed because I was trying to figure out what the fuck was wrong with it.

2253
01:52:00,240 --> 01:52:02,240
Was that the first time it had been happening?

2254
01:52:02,240 --> 01:52:05,240
This is the first time I've ever had to replace my XLR cable.

2255
01:52:05,240 --> 01:52:10,240
Okay. Has it been making that noise since before this morning?

2256
01:52:10,240 --> 01:52:12,240
For about a year.

2257
01:52:13,240 --> 01:52:15,240
Are you fucking serious?

2258
01:52:15,240 --> 01:52:18,240
I know, but it was so, like, anytime I'd unplug it and plug it back in, it was like, fixed.

2259
01:52:18,240 --> 01:52:22,240
I was like, huh, that's weird. Like, it would just seemingly fix itself.

2260
01:52:22,240 --> 01:52:25,240
It's gotten progressively worse in the last month.

2261
01:52:25,240 --> 01:52:28,240
You could have just wiggled it, we could have done the recording.

2262
01:52:29,240 --> 01:52:31,240
It's unstable.

2263
01:52:32,240 --> 01:52:34,240
Like, it's occasionally fasted anyways.

2264
01:52:34,240 --> 01:52:37,240
It's not that unstable, you've been streaming all day.

2265
01:52:37,240 --> 01:52:41,240
Yeah, but I also have the music of the game turned up, so it covers it up when it does act up.

2266
01:52:41,240 --> 01:52:42,240
Oh.

2267
01:52:43,240 --> 01:52:44,240
Yeah.

2268
01:52:45,240 --> 01:52:46,240
Basically.
