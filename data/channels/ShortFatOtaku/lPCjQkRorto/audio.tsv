0	9760	So, we're back again to do another watch party. The first time was a moderate success when
9760	15860	we did Lord of the Rings, The Rings of Power. Not the show, mind you. Just our having fun
15860	21800	with it. We don't even have a name for this series, do we? I just called it Devin Friends
21800	24000	Watch Lord of the Rings last time.
24000	30760	Well, now it's Devin Friends. It's called Devin Friends Watch. There you go. Devin Friends
30760	36480	Watch. I guess so. I guess so. And then insert title. Yeah. We've got Arch, Lilith, and Kibs
36480	46360	here once again. Hello everyone. We're back. We're back. Communism spreads. Communism spreads.
46360	52080	We've come back to watch another one and this time it is The Last of Us TV show on HBO.
52080	58600	I will say we tried to do this once before, but Kibs. Kibs, what did you do? What do you
58600	64240	mean what I do? Well, something killed the last watch party. What was it, Kibs? It wasn't
64240	71180	me. You sneak. I don't know what you're talking about. You sneaker. So, the reason that we're
71180	78120	doing episodes one and two in one go, and also the reason that we are a week late on
78120	84960	episode one. It's Dev's fault. Oh, is it my fault? Yeah. Dev could have told me that
84960	90400	the microphone, my XLR cable was busted, but it took too long. So, we had to wait a whole
90400	98700	week. Can you believe that? We'll let this one slide, Dev, but next time. Alright, Kibs.
98700	103520	Just for that, in post, I'm going to make your avatar a brony again. There's no need
103520	112440	to be mean. So, we are, in fact, going to do episodes one and two in one big, long three
112440	119440	and a half hour session. This is going to be real fun. I'm sure, I'm sure, actually.
119440	127360	You lying sack of shit. So, Arch and Kibs, I was on the Arch cast with you guys, and
127360	131240	we talked a whole bunch about The Last of Us, because Arch, you have no idea what this
131240	135660	show is or what the game is, right? So, we had to fill you in. We talked about the game?
135660	140680	We did, as well. Remember, it's your own show! Where are you? So, Arch, The Last of Us is
140680	149360	a console game. Okay. It is, it's trash. I mean, it is trash, yes. And you know what,
149360	154400	here, because Arch, you never played it, right? Of course not. And you don't know the, you
154400	159080	don't know the, the interest, like the cultural interest surrounding it, right? It's the end
159080	165480	of the PS3 360 Wii console era. The PS3 was a powerhouse for the time. Sony wanted a game
165480	172240	that could truly show off its power. And that game ended up being The Last of Us. This is
172240	178020	at the height of certain trends in gaming. One was the idea of the cinematic experience
178020	182880	game. So, there's lots of, there's lots of cutscenes. There's lots of moments where your
182880	187560	character just walks slowly through an environment and talks to another character. You see a
187560	193800	lot of that in like, God of War nowadays. And like, Tomb Raider does that as well. But
193800	199440	this was, this was kind of the peak of that type of gaming. It's less popular than it
199440	203680	was, but you still kind of see it sometimes. So even though the game had a lot of decent
203680	210800	combat and decent exploration, decent crafting, decent stealth, the game was clearly focused
210800	218720	on a cinematic experience. Second, is that in this period of making video games, and
218720	227120	just in general pop culture, there was a common storytelling motif of an older heroic man
227120	233740	who teams up with an adoptive daughter figure. And generally the idea is that the older man
233740	238760	didn't really have a chance to be a father. And he kind of regrets certain parts of his
238760	243780	past. He's older, he's not really in the game anymore. And the adoptive daughter is
243780	249880	somebody who never knew what life was like before the apocalypse, because this is always
249880	255160	an apocalyptic story. So, older man deals with the fact that the world's gone to shit.
255160	260200	Adoptive daughter doesn't even know what he's talking about. And they come to have a bond.
260200	266120	And if you'll see that in Telltale's Walking Dead with Lee and Clem, you see that in Logan
266120	271920	with Wolverine and whatever that girl's name was in that movie. But basically, this is
271920	278820	a very, very popular storytelling motif back in this period. And probably the best example
278820	286920	of it in gaming was The Last of Us, the relationship between Joel and Ellie. And this game was
286920	294840	basically marketed as the PS3's final triumph. The PS3 was an amazingly popular console.
294840	301520	The PS4 looked to also be similarly amazing. People loved Naughty Dog the developer. And
301520	305560	they were basically hitting all the right notes. All the things that were popular in
305560	309820	what was it 2012 or whatever it was in this game came out. All the things that were popular
309820	315320	this game was doing. So it's less that the game was a high quality game, though it's
315320	321220	like reasonably high quality. It's more that everything that was popular was in this game
321220	328340	all at once at the peak of its popularity. And that turned it into basically a mini cultural
328340	331500	phenomenon within gaming.
331500	337060	Sort of. It was a pretty big deal, but it wasn't like on the power of what you had with
337060	344380	Halo 3. Because that was like everywhere. That was like the Zenith, that was 2007, where
344380	349060	you had gaming where there was like, oh, Mountain Dew can, so you go to fucking Boyger King
349060	353580	and they had stuff. It was it was it was the height of PlayStation's sphere, is what
353580	354580	I would say.
354580	360940	The Archcast clip can fill that in. But Lilith, what is what is your relationship regarding
360940	362100	The Last of Us?
362100	368060	I know about the basic gist and the plot. I've always meant to play it, but like I just
368060	375540	never got around to it. It's just in my backlog, but it's one of those games that's good things
375540	382140	about it. But then I decided that they wanted to do like a remake of the first game that's
382140	389260	pretty much completely the same. Which, you know what? Feel free. Print money. Why not?
389260	393780	I have watched like the gameplay from start to finish, though, so I do know the story
393780	399500	for the first game. I pretty much skipped out on the second one for the most part, aside
399500	401920	from just knowing the story.
401920	406280	You just real good where the transvestite beats everybody to death at the golf club.
406280	412600	Here's the thing. Everyone said that that Abby was trans, but she's not trans. She's
412600	419060	a very muscular woman. Everyone is already like hyper aware of just shoehorned representation.
419060	425420	And also, Abby is very easy to vilify based on her actions within the context of the story.
425420	429920	She's not a well liked character. So I think I think people just like did one plus two
429920	433340	and said, this person's trans. And it's like, well, no, she's actually not trans. Here's
433340	437080	the thing. When it comes to these sort of shows, right, they almost always seem to end
437080	441400	up like trash, these new adaptations, because it happened with Lord of the Rings and it
441400	446880	happened with She-Hulk and it happened with the Halo show and it happened with Velma recently.
446880	452440	Like how many of these shows come out and are just like garbage piles? And I think people
452440	456320	are assuming that it's going to be the same thing with this one. I'm expecting this to
456320	459200	be trash. I don't know about you guys.
459200	465340	Historically, video games and adaptations hasn't been done too well. But, um, lately
465340	470600	seems to people have been breaking the trend. Like Arcane, for example, that was like a
470600	477840	really good adaptation from a video game to a show. And I think, what else? There was
477840	480860	a few, right? Good video game adaptations.
480860	484980	The Super Mario Brothers Movie from 1993.
484980	489300	The best video game adaptations are the ones that have nothing to do with the video game.
489300	495220	Arcane had nothing to do with League of Legends. Cyberpunk had nothing to do with Cyberpunk.
495220	496620	Alright, Cyberpunk.
496620	501980	Oh yeah, the little robot loli that Dimitri likes so much.
501980	508180	But I wouldn't actually discount this one because a key hallmark for a lot of the really
508180	514720	shit adaptations is a really shit cast, because it is usually made as some kind of hobby
514760	520840	product by know-nothing retards like the Winx of Power did, where there's just a large roster
520840	525180	of people you've never heard of and you have no interest in and that can't act to save
525180	532600	their lives. But here, I mean, Pedro Pascal, or Pablo, I'm going to call him frequently.
532600	533600	You fucking racist.
533600	540240	Very solid. No, it's because Pablo Schreiber from the Halo TV series, and now he's the
540240	547640	guy Pablo. I know now. Gabriel Luna as well. This series actually has some actors who might
547640	548640	be able to act.
548640	554360	Well, it's already an issue because they've already dismissed like the spores and a bunch
554360	555360	of other things.
555360	559440	So Arch, the lore of the spores, okay? So there's some, in real life, this is a real
559440	562680	life thing, not a Last of Us thing. There's some sort of a fungus that takes over the
562680	569980	brain of an ant. And what it does is it makes the ant crawl onto the end of a grass blade
569980	577100	so that it can be picked up by a bird. And then the bird eats the ant, and then it gets
577100	581420	shit out. And then that's how the spores of this life form spread across the environment.
581420	584300	It's based on a real, that's a real play, a real...
584300	590220	Yeah, that is a real fungus, yes. And so Amy Hennig, when she was kind of like penning
590220	596480	out the initial ideas of the Last of Us, she's like, well, what if we did a zombie story,
596480	603560	but we did our own twist on it where it was transmitted through fungal spores. And so
603560	609120	you go into these dens of zombies where people are growing into the walls and you're wearing
609120	614300	a gas mask and you have to hold your breath if you ever take the mask off, right? Because
614300	619120	the air is infected with these spores. And the spores are the primary way that the zombie
619120	624160	virus gets around. And basically what happens is the person gets infected by breathing in
624160	628520	the spore and then they have like a zombie stage and then they have a very aggressive
628520	632680	zombie stage called clickers where they have, where they can't, like their, their eyes have
632680	637000	been all grown out and they can't see anymore, but they can echo location. So you have to
637000	641280	like stealth through it. And then once in the final stages, they just turn into like
641280	643840	a giant mushroom and they just grow into the wall.
643840	646520	Yep, and then it's the spores. And then somebody's...
647520	655080	Yeah, yeah. So it was basically a different spin on the zombie story, but the fact that
655080	660440	it was fungal spores was a core component of the lore. And so to see spores will not
660440	664600	exist in The Last of Us HBO, that literally just makes it a normal zombie story.
664600	670720	Yep. They've, they've taken, they've demystified the zombies because like any good zombie setting
670720	675400	like Dead Space or like The Last of Us, when it comes to the fungal spores, what that does
675400	679920	is it helps drive it apart than your just basic bitches, green zambi, you know, it bites
679920	684000	your brains or whatever. Like that's boring. That's old. You got to do something new and
684000	685400	fresh with your zombies.
685400	690640	I don't know if I'd really consider that all that new and fucking fresh, but if you say
690640	691640	so.
691640	697240	What, you don't like stinky mushrooms, you little shit?
697240	701460	In terms of gameplay, it wasn't that different aside from like the, the, the, the breath
701460	705620	mechanic in some of the levels, but in terms of the lore, it did make it feel fresh for
705620	707420	2012 or whatever it was.
707420	708420	Yep.
708420	709420	Remember in 2012.
709420	712940	Very specific spores. I guess they're not absorbed through the eyes.
712940	716340	They had to keep it fresh because by 2012, that was the end.
716340	717340	They wear masks, yeah.
717340	721660	Yep. But 2012 was also the end of the zombie craze because Left 4 Dead 2 and all the zombie
721660	724320	games started to fall out of circulation.
724320	729660	And Walking Dead kind of had its major impact back then. I mean, in World of Warcraft, like
729660	731080	Wrath of the Lich King was wrapping up.
731080	735300	So the zombie thing had come and gone, and this was like the tail end of it.
735300	737420	And so they said, we have to make, if we're going to do a zombie story, you have to do
737420	738420	something different.
738420	741060	So they did, they did spores rather than like a virus.
741060	744900	Yeah, but dismissing console, console stuff is fine.
744900	747940	Well, the thing is you have to respect the fandom, Arch.
747940	749940	I know, they're consoles.
749940	753500	You're about as, you're about as brilliant as they are when it comes to that, if that's
753500	754500	your perspective.
754500	757980	Oh my God, this is Archer's SJW, Arch.
757980	758980	He's rejecting the fandom.
758980	763140	He's like, no, it's my fandom now.
763140	764740	It's not, I reject it.
764740	767420	It's a console fandom.
767420	770800	Whatever damage done to it was probably for the better.
770800	777020	There is one hallmark that I think hasn't been seen too much yet.
777020	783460	So if you recall, when it came to, um, when it came to the Obi Wan Kenobi show, everyone
783460	788840	was, even before the show came out, everyone was talking about all the racist hatred that
788840	791380	the actress of Riva was getting, right?
791380	794540	When it came to the Lord of the Rings show, everyone was talking about the black elf and
794540	796340	his actor and all the racist hatred.
796340	801940	Like I haven't seen much of that this time where there's been this performative wokeness
801940	806220	in the media before this show launches to try to get it off the ground.
806220	809460	Now maybe I just haven't seen the articles yet, but as far as I can tell, that seems
809460	812220	to be absent, which is a good sign.
812220	817660	They also haven't pulled off operation hide behind the black man, uh, to the same degree
817660	818660	in this show.
818660	825500	I mean, if, if Pedro Pascal shows up in episode one now wearing blackface, I'll retract that
825500	830580	statement, but hide behind the Mexican just doesn't have quite the same effect.
830580	832940	Well in this case, they wouldn't be hiding behind the Mexican.
832940	836020	They'd have to hide behind his daughter because I think they race swapped her.
836020	837260	Yeah, we'll have to see though.
837260	838260	We'll have to see.
838260	840780	So hide behind the child.
840780	844620	Because the daughter, the little woman, oh, okay.
844620	846980	Well you can't hide behind the corpse then.
846980	847980	You dumbass.
847980	848980	It's 10 years old.
848980	849980	Okay.
849980	850980	Pulls up the little corpse.
850980	851980	It flops in the wind.
851980	852980	I can't.
852980	853980	Don't attack us.
853980	859300	Like if this child ends up being on screen for like 10 minutes, that was, you just can't
859300	860300	slap him now.
860300	862660	Yeah, probably going to be less than 10 minutes.
862660	863660	She should die pretty quickly.
863660	866460	You can't hide behind the side character, Jesus.
866460	867960	It would be funny if they tried.
867960	876000	So I guess it's time for us to watch the premiere of The Last of Us, another watch party series
876000	877000	begins.
877000	878000	It's going to be awesome.
878000	879000	All right.
879000	880000	Let's rock and roll.
880000	884280	Let's prep up good old VLC because there's no way in hell I'm paying for HBO.
884280	901800	Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah.
901800	902800	I'm a baller.
902800	903800	Yes.
903800	907600	And we end up with a global pandemic pan, meaning all the whole world becomes sickle
907600	909600	at once.
910600	913600	We call it COVID.
913600	915600	No, no, no.
915600	916600	All right.
916600	917600	Well, that's our show.
917600	919680	Hey, that's that dude from the other television show.
919680	920680	That's kind of famous.
920680	925800	I don't like that guy because he used to own slaves, but in the end, what, what would you
925800	931360	just to be clear, you, you do think microorganisms, different show, don't you recognize him?
931360	932360	Kind of bacteria?
932360	933360	No.
933360	934360	You like saying no.
934360	935360	Yes.
935360	938040	He's funny.
938480	944800	It's dominance from Spartacus because there are some fungi who seek not to kill, but to
944800	945800	control.
945800	946800	Let me ask you.
946800	947800	Oh God.
947800	948800	They're actually going to explain that part.
948800	954440	You get it from, I thought that was supposed to be implied fungus psilocybin also fungus.
954440	955440	This is all new to the show.
955440	961080	This isn't wasn't in the game at all because I thought this was supposed to be a little
961080	965900	bit of the secret that it did that whole, you know, brain control, zombie fungus thing.
965900	968660	This is more of a show, don't tell policy.
968660	971420	This is just exposition, which is not good storytelling.
971420	977340	This is, Hey, you don't know anything about this console communist universe of fungus
977340	984660	and by the way, global warming, Cordyceps, Astragalus, anyone in the game already did
984660	993020	the mystery angles and taking control of millions of yeah, I've seen like similar approach to
993020	995660	like the new triathlon series.
995660	1003980	So if that happens, we lose.
1003980	1005700	And that's why you should wear your masks.
1005700	1007820	Oh, it's not entirely true.
1007820	1010780	I was like, there are treatments for fungal infections.
1010780	1014220	It's not literally impossible, but details, details.
1014220	1015220	That's not convenient.
1015220	1016220	It doesn't sound scary.
1016220	1019980	Arch, you know, I don't like, is it game of Thrones again?
1019980	1020980	It is.
1020980	1026820	Oh God, I wish people would stop making this fucking intro.
1026820	1034940	This is creatively bankrupt, but yeah, you know, I'll give it one point, one point because
1034940	1042940	I really enjoy the fact that they're using the original song for my diverse craft of
1042940	1048140	creators who never played the video games if they want to go into the fungal and how
1048140	1051620	big of a threat it is airborne.
1051620	1056020	You can see the particles in the air like that is the bits of the fungus.
1056020	1057020	That's not good.
1057020	1059700	Oh, look, the fungus turned into the two main characters.
1059700	1061020	Wasn't that clever?
1061020	1068100	No, not really, but I mean, it was a shot.
1068100	1069500	It's like baby's first intro.
1069500	1071540	It's like, Ooh, it's deep and symbolic.
1071540	1072540	It's like, no.
1072540	1073540	That was three.
1073540	1075860	Oh, that was a good year.
1075860	1076860	Yeah.
1076860	1079180	Before the bad things started to happen.
1079180	1082060	You think it's good here because the Iraq invasion, don't you?
1082060	1083060	Yep.
1083060	1085940	Iraq invasion and Pokemon Ruby and Sapphire, baby.
1085940	1088900	Hell yeah, brother.
1088900	1089900	Everyone was concerned.
1089900	1092300	Like, Oh my God, it's going to be a big war.
1092300	1094420	He's going to deploy that chemical weapons.
1094420	1098900	He didn't have any, but they black washed his daughter.
1098900	1099900	Yeah.
1099900	1100960	Did I?
1100960	1102980	His daughter was like a blonde girl.
1102980	1105740	Well, now she's a black girl.
1105740	1107780	I guess, I guess the dad liked racism.
1107780	1108780	Okay.
1108780	1109780	Right.
1109780	1112780	I know this is going to hit somebody here personal, but anyone who makes eggs like these
1112780	1115580	need to be taken outside and put out of their fucking misery.
1115580	1116580	Hold on.
1116580	1119820	Didn't Lilith just make eggs like those before the show started?
1119820	1120820	Exactly.
1120820	1121820	What's that?
1121820	1125820	I lit it with a cold fire.
1125820	1126820	Yeah man.
1126820	1128740	I also, I like simple eggs too.
1128740	1129740	They're just like easy.
1129740	1133340	The black girl has a watermelon in her fridge.
1133340	1134340	Oh my God.
1134340	1135340	Oh my God.
1135940	1138220	That's a lot of placement.
1138220	1140500	Would you like some purple drink?
1140500	1141500	It's orange.
1141500	1142500	It's orange.
1142500	1149900	Lilith, Lilith, let's hope that none of your more left-leaning friends see this or else
1149900	1150900	you'll be instantly canceled.
1150900	1155900	How does that get destroyed for being in the same presence?
1155900	1158460	Oh God, I remember this song.
1158460	1162440	This song was on the radio every single second of every single day, back in the good old
1162440	1163440	days.
1163440	1164440	He's dependent on me.
1164540	1165540	It's not the same.
1165540	1167540	The outbreak better happen at night or I'll be mad.
1167540	1169540	I thought he was having pancakes.
1169540	1171540	He thought he was having fucking pancakes.
1171540	1173540	The concrete guy is going to be there?
1173540	1174540	Let me stick that some Tabasco.
1174540	1175540	He can't frame until we pull.
1175540	1177540	I had to give the actor some credit though.
1177540	1179540	He actually does look a bit like Joel.
1179540	1180540	I'm not splitting his job.
1180540	1181540	A little bit.
1181540	1182540	Yeah.
1182540	1183540	Okay.
1183540	1185860	See, I kind of hate this introductionary scene.
1185860	1186860	Not that it's bad.
1186860	1187860	Like this is actually all right.
1187860	1190100	They're having a decent little conversation et cetera, but the zombie apocalypse is about
1190100	1191960	to hit in like five seconds, right?
1191960	1193980	And so they're like, Hey, care about these characters.
1194520	1195520	They're all going to fucking die.
1195520	1196520	Why?
1196520	1199520	Barge, you have to at least put in the effort of caring.
1199520	1201520	Barge don't want to.
1201520	1202520	Barge don't want to.
1202520	1205520	The little black girl who eats watermelon is smart.
1205520	1208520	Barge, calm down.
1208520	1212520	Sometimes I have to create my own entertainment, okay?
1212520	1214520	We can rip on it in time.
1214520	1216520	Page to page.
1216520	1220520	I mean, this is an intro that is similar to the one in the first game, but the one in
1220520	1222520	the first game happened in the middle of the night.
1223060	1224060	Very quick.
1224060	1229060	Listen, we need to build value for these characters so that when this child is eaten to death,
1229060	1230060	we feel bad.
1230060	1233060	Gosh darn it, Barge.
1233060	1235060	If she gets eaten to death, I'll be surprised.
1235060	1236060	Good.
1236060	1237060	Oh my God.
1237060	1238060	Just because she's brown though.
1238060	1239060	Come on.
1239060	1241060	Just because she's black, she likes watermelon and stealing things.
1241060	1242060	I know.
1242060	1243060	It's weird.
1243060	1244060	Show, stop.
1244060	1245060	Please.
1245060	1246060	Show, don't do this.
1246060	1249060	Show's like, I'm going to be racist.
1249600	1252600	I could come by after school, but just for like a little bit.
1252600	1253600	Look, zombies.
1253600	1254600	She'll take what you got.
1254600	1256600	Dad, you love biscuits.
1259600	1260600	Jesus Christ.
1260600	1261600	You are fond of biscuits.
1261600	1262600	I do.
1262600	1263600	But I'm on Atkins.
1263600	1264600	What now?
1264600	1265600	It's, uh, you know what?
1265600	1268600	We got to run, but Sarah will be by later.
1268600	1270600	She'll stay as long as you want.
1270600	1272600	Tell you all about Atkins.
1272600	1274600	I'm going to stay alive for this.
1274600	1276600	Dad, why are you making me stay with the white people?
1277140	1280140	I don't like the white ones, daddy.
1280140	1283140	They don't look like me.
1283140	1285140	Operation Desert Storm.
1285140	1288140	Oh my God, it's the best bush.
1293140	1295140	You won't use any of this shit.
1295140	1297140	You won't use any of this shit in later life.
1297140	1299140	You're going to have a smartphone on you.
1299140	1301140	You're not going to be calculating anything.
1303140	1305140	God, so many teachers told me,
1305680	1307680	you're not going to have a calculator on you all the time.
1307680	1309680	It's like, yes, I fucking will.
1309680	1310680	The phones.
1310680	1312680	The invention of phones.
1312680	1314680	Yeah, but what if a giant mushroom apocalypse comes deaf?
1314680	1316680	Good point, Lilith.
1316680	1317680	Yeah, deaf.
1317680	1318680	Stupid deaf.
1318680	1319680	Stupid.
1319680	1323680	You know, if the mushroom apocalypse came in 2003,
1323680	1326680	we'd be spared so much fucking bullshit.
1326680	1328680	Oh, the world would be a better place.
1328680	1330680	I don't know about that.
1330680	1332680	Listen, you wouldn't have to deal with
1332680	1334680	female space marines.
1335220	1337220	I'd rather deal with female space marines
1337220	1339220	than figure out where to get food from.
1339220	1341220	At least female space marines are profitable.
1341220	1343220	Very true.
1345220	1347220	Music.
1347220	1349220	That's it?
1349220	1351220	Did you steal your dad's watch?
1351220	1353220	She stole her dad's money to get her dad a present?
1353220	1354220	God.
1354220	1356220	Kyle, you were wrong.
1356220	1358220	She's not just a thief because she's black.
1358220	1360220	She's actually kind and caring.
1360220	1362220	She's a kind thief.
1362220	1364220	Kyle.
1364760	1366760	You're allowed to interpret that.
1366760	1368760	I've been cancelled.
1368760	1370760	In the original game,
1370760	1372760	didn't she buy a new watch for Joel?
1372760	1374760	She did.
1374760	1376760	I hate their language.
1376760	1378760	I'm sorry.
1378760	1380760	It doesn't make me racist.
1380760	1382760	I just don't like any language
1382760	1384760	that pronounces the...
1384760	1386760	You should go home.
1386760	1388760	I don't know, something's going on.
1388760	1390760	I wonder what.
1390760	1392760	Maybe it's fire or something.
1392800	1394800	The outbreak's gonna happen at night, I assume.
1394800	1396800	Because we're seeing a little bit more
1396800	1398800	before the video game starts.
1398800	1401800	Yeah, we're seeing what leads up to it.
1401800	1404800	Why half those children in the background are eating?
1404800	1406800	There was just a lot of police and stuff on the road today.
1406800	1408800	Well, that's true every day, isn't it?
1408800	1410800	That's American.
1410800	1412800	It's a hellhole.
1412800	1415800	Three nails plus one cross equals four given.
1415800	1417800	Ha ha ha.
1417800	1419800	Jesus.
1419800	1421800	Chocolate chip?
1421840	1423840	Alright, she needs to burn.
1423840	1425840	Yep.
1425840	1427840	She should get bit first for raisin cookies.
1427840	1429840	Seriously, though.
1429840	1431840	She better die.
1431840	1433840	Just put the mushrooms into the cookie.
1433840	1435840	Is the old lady gonna turn into a zombie?
1435840	1437840	TV show, I get what you're doing,
1437840	1439840	but this isn't really your story.
1439840	1441840	Please just get to the zombies.
1441840	1443840	It's a TV show.
1443840	1445840	It's the establishing episode.
1445840	1447840	Come on, Barge.
1447840	1449840	I understand, but
1449880	1451880	even I know what this story is.
1451880	1453880	Oh god, that's before Blu-ray.
1453880	1455880	They're all low definition.
1461880	1463880	Look, she's turning.
1463880	1465880	Ah, shit.
1465880	1467880	She is.
1467880	1469880	I like how this house
1469880	1471880	is more like 1950s than
1471880	1473880	2003.
1473880	1475880	Oh, Jesus, she is.
1475880	1477880	Oh, that's fucking...
1477920	1479920	I should go.
1479920	1481920	Yeah.
1481920	1483920	You're gonna die with your raisin cookies, bitch.
1483920	1485920	Ha ha ha.
1485920	1487920	She is.
1487920	1489920	Like, as soon as she leaves, I guarantee you they're gonna have
1489920	1491920	a shot of her getting attacked and, like, they don't even notice.
1491920	1493920	Look, the wheelchair
1493920	1495920	is empty.
1495920	1497920	Aw, no?
1497920	1499920	She was just yawning. It's okay.
1499920	1501920	Look, the dog is
1501920	1503920	being sus.
1503920	1505920	Yeah, the dog knows something's up.
1505960	1507960	This is an airborne infection. Why isn't the little
1507960	1509960	black girl starting to eat brains right about now?
1509960	1511960	Uh, the spores...
1511960	1513960	The spores die in direct
1513960	1515960	sunlight.
1515960	1517960	Yeah, but she was inside a second ago.
1517960	1519960	There was sun coming through the windows.
1519960	1521960	It also depends on, again, where the granny got
1521960	1523960	the spores. Yeah, how long it's been.
1523960	1525960	There's a bunch of factors.
1525960	1527960	Yeah, but she didn't strike me like the kind
1527960	1529960	who would be out and about on the regular.
1529960	1531960	The spores take a couple hours
1531960	1533960	to set in.
1534000	1536000	There you go, man. You gotta plant them.
1536000	1538000	It's me. Water them.
1538000	1540000	There's a plant.
1540000	1542000	Fertilize.
1542000	1544000	We're at night time.
1544000	1546000	It looks more like day for night, but still.
1546000	1548000	Good job.
1548000	1550000	You know what the show's gonna do.
1550000	1552000	Yep. Yep, here we go.
1552000	1554000	Yeah, this is the coach scene. The infamous coach
1554000	1556000	scene from the start of the game.
1556000	1558000	They gave us the wrong side.
1558000	1560000	To be fair, I would rather the
1560000	1562000	show be too bright and too dark.
1562040	1564040	True. Remember Game of Thrones?
1564040	1566040	We couldn't see shit.
1566040	1568040	Where'd you get the money for this?
1568040	1570040	Drugs. I sell hardcore
1570040	1572040	drugs. It's better when I do.
1572040	1574040	It was only $20, which I stole
1574040	1576040	from you. I could have
1576040	1578040	stolen $60, but I put the change back
1578040	1580040	because I'm an honest thief. Besides,
1580040	1582040	it's the thought that counts. Well, at least
1582040	1584040	you missed.
1584040	1586040	See, Connor, you were wrong about her. She's a lovely little girl.
1586040	1588040	How did the show end?
1588040	1590040	In the game, she actually
1590080	1592080	paid for it herself, and
1592080	1594080	she had the same joke, hardcore drugs,
1594080	1596080	but then he just said, where'd you get the money
1596080	1598080	for this? Drugs.
1598080	1600080	I sell hardcore drugs. Oh, good.
1600080	1602080	You can start helping out with the mortgage then.
1602080	1604080	Yeah, you wish.
1604080	1606080	Great, you can start paying off the mortgage.
1606080	1608080	It was a better scene.
1608080	1610080	It's not nearly
1610080	1612080	as good. No.
1612080	1614080	But if she's poor, we'll feel worse about her.
1614080	1616080	Maybe.
1616080	1618080	It's somewhat
1618120	1620120	it's more accurate than the Halo TV show
1620120	1622120	so far. Oh, god, the Halo
1622120	1624120	TV show.
1624120	1626120	And this Pablo's nose is much smaller.
1626120	1628120	I still kind of want to go back and watch that
1628120	1630120	because it was such a train wreck.
1632120	1634120	Wait, that can be our next watch party,
1634120	1636120	guys.
1636120	1638120	I don't feel sick.
1638120	1640120	Well, they're following the major story beats.
1640120	1642120	So far.
1644120	1646120	Jumpscare.
1648120	1650120	Nope,
1650120	1652120	just explosions.
1654120	1656120	Fireworks and it's green.
1656120	1658120	No,
1658120	1660120	the Borg have showed up.
1660120	1662120	On this
1662120	1664120	average evening in the U.S.
1668120	1670120	The feds are finally coming for your
1670120	1672120	guns.
1678120	1680120	It's been awful
1680120	1682120	protect.
1682120	1684120	It sounds like
1684120	1686120	your family's fun.
1686120	1688120	Mercy.
1688120	1690120	In those
1694120	1696120	they're kind of cute
1696120	1698120	because they look like bananas with lovely bits.
1698120	1700120	Don't want to go home.
1700120	1702120	Granny ate
1702120	1704120	other granny.
1704120	1706120	I don't want those cookies.
1706160	1708160	Mercy.
1708160	1710160	That was not attached well.
1710160	1712160	Now this is all gone completely
1712160	1714160	off script from the game though right now.
1714160	1716160	Yeah, yeah, it is because
1716160	1718160	Joel's supposed to wake her up.
1718160	1720160	Look, the wheelchair
1720160	1722160	is empty now.
1722160	1724160	Look, there's light coming through the window like
1724160	1726160	it's daytime.
1726160	1728160	Listen,
1728160	1730160	after Games of Thrones, better to lighten
1730160	1732160	through dark again.
1732160	1734160	I still wouldn't be walking in here, to be honest.
1734200	1736200	This is so
1736200	1738200	coward.
1738200	1740200	This is so unrealistic behavior.
1740200	1742200	Oh.
1742200	1744200	See, this is the point
1744200	1746200	at which I'd be like, no,
1746200	1748200	I'm leaving. It's time to go back home.
1748200	1750200	I
1750200	1752200	done all I could. Time to leave.
1756200	1758200	Well, that's mildly
1758200	1760200	disturbing.
1760200	1762200	Looks like bean
1762240	1764240	sprouts in her mouth.
1771240	1773240	Yeah, to be fair,
1773240	1775240	being that old and a zombie
1775240	1777240	is not a good combo.
1787240	1789240	Now there's the actions of a
1789240	1791240	seasoned wife beater.
1791240	1793240	Wait, you should go back
1793240	1795240	into your house and get your weapons because
1795240	1797240	you're a soldier. Surely you still have your rifle.
1807240	1809240	Oh no.
1809240	1811240	And they're going to get eaten.
1811240	1813240	Fuck.
1813240	1815240	Because they want to go help.
1815240	1817240	So to be fair,
1817240	1819240	this part of the show is exactly like
1819240	1821240	the game.
1821240	1823240	Yep, now we're back on track.
1825240	1827240	Don't move to the cities,
1827240	1829240	guys.
1829240	1831240	Yep, it's the first place that will go in a
1831240	1833240	fungus apocalypse.
1835240	1837240	Well, at least Jimmy doesn't have to worry
1837240	1839240	about the electricity prices anymore.
1839240	1841240	Yeah,
1841240	1843240	yeah, from the game,
1843240	1845240	exactly.
1845240	1847240	Now we're back on track.
1847240	1849240	From the point of the game, you play as the girl.
1849240	1851240	You can crawl around the back seat and see the entire
1851240	1853240	scene 360 degrees.
1853240	1855240	It was kind of cool, yeah.
1855240	1857240	Yeah, it was pretty cool for the time.
1867240	1869240	We're not getting there.
1869240	1871240	Yeah, that is a smorgasbord.
1871240	1873240	This is why
1873240	1875240	everybody needs to read the
1875240	1877240	zombie survival guide, so you don't make
1877240	1879240	these silly mistakes when the zombie
1879240	1881240	apocalypse hits.
1881240	1883240	This is actually really good.
1883240	1885240	I'm pleasantly surprised.
1885240	1887240	It's actually not
1887240	1889240	terrible.
1889240	1891240	Yet.
1891240	1893240	Keyboard.
1893240	1895240	I quite appreciated the first person shots they did.
1895240	1897240	That was nice. Very video gaming.
1897240	1899240	Uh.
1909240	1911240	I don't remember that.
1911240	1913240	Grab something.
1913240	1915240	Every apocalypse movie
1915240	1917240	has to have the scene where the jumbo jet
1917240	1919240	goes meow.
1919240	1921240	Alright, now I
1921240	1923240	know.
1923240	1925240	I'm surprised that they have like
1925240	1927240	all the buildings the same, too.
1927240	1929240	Yeah, they make a good town.
1929240	1931240	Yeah.
1931240	1933240	Wow.
1933240	1935240	I really enjoy
1935240	1937240	the first person shots, honestly.
1937240	1939240	They're really chaotic and weird.
1939240	1941240	They feel
1941240	1943240	non-cinematic, which is good.
1943240	1945240	It gets me more in the spirit of the video
1945240	1947240	game style of it.
1947240	1949240	Quite nice.
1949240	1951240	Somebody's gonna jump on the fender.
1955240	1957240	That
1957240	1959240	jumbo jet is going to have a hard time
1959240	1961240	pulling off that maneuver.
1961240	1963240	I think it's sawing.
1963240	1965240	Yeah.
1965240	1967240	Move.
1967240	1969240	Move.
1969240	1971240	Wow.
1971240	1973240	Oh, shit.
1977240	1979240	Actually, rather than explode, I'm pretty sure
1979240	1981240	the cockpit and pooches of the plane would be barreling
1981240	1983240	down the street at this point, but
1983240	1985240	fair enough.
1985240	1987240	Listen, it was filled entirely with explosives.
1987240	1989240	But I wish they would have just skipped
1989240	1991240	to this right off the bat and just
1991240	1993240	kind of clover-field it, you know?
1993240	1995240	Don't explain what's gonna happen, just
1995240	1997240	boom, something awful is happening.
1997240	1999240	Panic, panic, panic, panic. What the fuck?
1999240	2001240	Yeah, the prologue kind of sucked on us.
2001240	2003240	They might have actually been better served just
2003240	2005240	barricading themselves in the house.
2005240	2007240	No shit.
2007240	2009240	You don't say.
2009240	2011240	Considering they drove into town,
2011240	2013240	into the shit-show.
2013240	2015240	Yeah, in the game
2015240	2017240	at the very least,
2017240	2019240	a zombie came
2019240	2021240	through, or at
2021240	2023240	least the series would call it clicker
2023240	2025240	with the window,
2025240	2027240	so they couldn't barricade it.
2027240	2029240	Yeah.
2029240	2031240	You should have closed that door.
2031240	2033240	His hands are sort of on the ground.
2033240	2035240	Jesus, that guy's just jumping.
2035240	2037240	That stunt man is pulling out all the
2037240	2039240	stops, good on him.
2039240	2041240	It's giving an unbelievable
2041240	2043240	performance.
2043240	2045240	My dude, that was a fucking
2045240	2047240	exquisite shot.
2047240	2049240	Don't move.
2049240	2051240	Yes, sir.
2051240	2053240	That's not a good sign.
2053240	2055240	He's gonna let him go, though.
2055240	2057240	He's a good person.
2057240	2059240	He's gonna let him go, though.
2059240	2061240	He's a good person.
2061240	2063240	He's gonna let him go, though.
2063240	2065240	Sir,
2065240	2067240	we are not
2067240	2069240	sick!
2069240	2071240	Really?
2071240	2073240	Aw, that's kind of cruel.
2073240	2075240	They made the soldier
2075240	2077240	a lot more mean in this version.
2077240	2079240	He was like regretting it in the game.
2079240	2081240	He was hesitating a lot more.
2081240	2083240	I'm sorry.
2083240	2085240	Oh, there we go.
2085240	2087240	Though, I will
2087240	2089240	say, okay, so, he
2089240	2091240	single shot,
2091240	2093240	fuck nails, a zombie,
2093240	2095240	running, tilt, from
2095240	2097240	the side,
2097240	2099240	missing the civilians.
2099240	2101240	But he fucks up a burst at point
2101240	2103240	of blank range. He didn't fuck it up,
2103240	2105240	March.
2105240	2107240	He scored a good couple
2107240	2109240	hits.
2109240	2111240	You're okay. You're okay. Move your hand, baby.
2111240	2113240	Those are 5-5-6's.
2113240	2115240	Paolo should be hit, too.
2115240	2117240	I don't think she's gonna be okay.
2117240	2119240	Come on, baby.
2119240	2121240	Is she gone?
2121240	2123240	Come on, please.
2123240	2125240	Is she gonzo?
2125240	2127240	You know,
2127240	2129240	again, I am actually pleasantly
2129240	2131240	surprised so far. Again, I actually
2131240	2133240	would have preferred to skip the fucking
2133240	2135240	preamble. But this is
2135240	2137240	nice, okay?
2137240	2139240	I, too, I'm thinking like, oh, surely
2139240	2141240	he's gonna let them go, right?
2141240	2143240	I don't know what you're about to say, Dev.
2143240	2145240	Arch-C's dying black child.
2145240	2147240	This is nice.
2147240	2149240	You know, I kind of appreciate that.
2149240	2151240	This just reminds me of
2151240	2153240	the good old days.
2153240	2155240	So that was shot for shot exactly the
2155240	2157240	scene from the game.
2157240	2159240	It was very nice. Because I was thinking like, okay,
2159240	2161240	surely the soldier's gonna be like, I can't just kill
2161240	2163240	a fucking dude and his child.
2163240	2165240	Because that would be the normal response.
2165240	2167240	But no, he puts them down.
2167240	2169240	That puts some stakes in it, because that means that
2169240	2171240	the disease is that bad.
2171240	2173240	Granted, I don't think a single soldier would be
2173240	2175240	wandering around unaccompanied in the middle of a zombie
2175240	2177240	pop news, but details, details.
2177240	2179240	No, I don't even know what this is.
2179240	2181240	Ah, no.
2181240	2183240	This is a child who's
2183240	2185240	outside, probably being
2185240	2187240	more fungi than human.
2189240	2191240	Isn't this Ellie?
2191240	2193240	Uh, that looks like a boy?
2197240	2199240	Kyle, we don't do the whole gender
2199240	2201240	thing anymore. Hey, wait, this actually is
2201240	2203240	Boston 2023.
2203240	2205240	Damn, shot for shot, Dev. I see what you mean.
2205240	2207240	Mm, pretty accurate.
2207240	2209240	Don't worry, kid.
2209240	2211240	You're in Boston now. Wakes up.
2211240	2213240	Nooo.
2213240	2215240	You can't leave.
2215240	2217240	You know, they never really, I don't remember what they say
2217240	2219240	happens in the lore as time goes on,
2219240	2221240	but like, they're not government holdouts.
2221240	2223240	Just not very many.
2223240	2225240	Yeah, like, each city has a
2225240	2227240	US government contingent that are there.
2227240	2229240	And they kind of
2229240	2231240	they're run by the Department of Health?
2231240	2233240	It wouldn't be run by the Department of Health.
2233240	2235240	I think it's because of the whole
2235240	2237240	the whole virus part of it.
2237240	2239240	That's why they're in charge.
2239240	2241240	But it wouldn't.
2241240	2243240	The US Army actually has contingency plans
2243240	2245240	for this shit.
2245240	2247240	For a zombie apocalypse?
2247240	2249240	Yep. To be honest, I've heard
2249240	2251240	that, like, if an actual zombie apocalypse
2251240	2253240	happened, it would be reasonably easy to
2253240	2255240	contain, all things considered.
2255240	2257240	Then again,
2257240	2259240	Then again with COVID, we haven't really
2259240	2261240	we haven't really contained that.
2261240	2263240	The problem would be the hesitation surrounding
2263240	2265240	it. Figuring out what exactly is happening
2265240	2267240	and the inertia of going like, yep, nope,
2267240	2269240	actually, they're zombies.
2269240	2271240	How well they handle it probably depends on what sort of zombies.
2271240	2273240	But like, yeah.
2273240	2275240	It is pretty funny that
2275240	2277240	the actual US military has
2277240	2279240	a disease for a zombie apocalypse.
2279240	2281240	Who knows?
2281240	2283240	I don't like where this is going.
2283240	2285240	Toys?
2285240	2287240	It was red.
2287240	2289240	It was red.
2289240	2291240	So she's infected.
2291240	2293240	Yep, that needle there.
2293240	2295240	That's medicine.
2295240	2297240	And now you're gonna die.
2297240	2299240	Yep.
2299240	2301240	To be fair, this is a very nice way of doing it.
2301240	2303240	Like, give her hope, like, everything's fine now,
2303240	2305240	it's gonna be great, then she pulls sleep.
2305240	2307240	Yep.
2307240	2309240	Thing is, she was infected.
2309240	2311240	Yeah, they didn't have a choice.
2311240	2313240	Yep.
2313240	2315240	But that way she went down
2315240	2317240	and, you know, she had happy thoughts.
2317240	2319240	Yeah. As sickening and sad as that is.
2319240	2321240	No, no, that is exactly what you should do.
2321240	2323240	Like, you can't save her, okay, make the best out of it.
2323240	2325240	Is this, is this
2325240	2327240	Joel's girlfriend?
2327240	2329240	Yeah.
2329240	2331240	Very ugly looking, if that's her.
2331240	2333240	Well, here's the thing.
2333240	2335240	This is actually the voice actor, actress
2335240	2337240	who played Tess in the game.
2337240	2339240	They got the same person back.
2339240	2341240	Probably should have got somebody of the appropriate age
2341240	2343240	to do, but yeah, I do appreciate the mantra.
2343240	2345240	It has, it has been ten years
2345240	2347240	since the game, yeah.
2347240	2349240	Yes. I'm surprised this isn't a train wreck
2349240	2351240	so far.
2353240	2355240	There's the kid.
2357240	2359240	Uh-huh.
2359240	2361240	You know, in the
2361240	2363240	post-apocalypse, that's a lot of valuable
2363240	2365240	materials you're throwing away there.
2365240	2367240	Yeah, the shirt and the, yeah,
2367240	2369240	all the stuff.
2369240	2371240	But the shirt's probably like
2371240	2373240	Oh, infected? Yeah, yeah.
2373240	2375240	Spores on the shirt.
2375240	2377240	If there were spores on the shirt, then all of these workers
2377240	2379240	are infected now too.
2379240	2381240	Yeah, that's true. I mean, to be fair,
2381240	2383240	she was put down before the
2383240	2385240	spores could start, you know, coming out of her.
2385240	2387240	Arch, Arch, don't question
2387240	2389240	the efficacy of the masks, okay?
2389240	2391240	That gets you kicked off
2391240	2393240	YouTube.
2393240	2395240	He's got peppered,
2395240	2397240	grey peppered hair.
2397240	2399240	If he was 36 before,
2399240	2401240	he should be 50.
2401240	2403240	56?
2403240	2405240	Oh, the firefly symbol.
2405240	2407240	I wonder if they'll ruin the firefly people.
2407240	2409240	They'll make them communist or something.
2409240	2411240	Since they're rebelling against the government.
2415240	2417240	I don't want to spoil for Arch.
2417240	2419240	But you can never leave.
2419240	2421240	Uh, pause it for a second.
2421240	2423240	Okay, sure.
2423240	2425240	I like how I just tried to pause it.
2425240	2427240	I don't think I can upload
2427240	2429240	this file to something that would actually
2429240	2431240	work on watch together.
2431240	2433240	What's wrong, Barch? Barch?
2433240	2435240	It's surprisingly good.
2435240	2437240	What do you think, Lilith?
2437240	2439240	I feel like what they added was enough that they
2439240	2441240	it keeps things fresh because
2441240	2443240	if it's just like a four shot for shot remake
2443240	2445240	of the game, then
2445240	2447240	it's played a game.
2447240	2449240	It does need to be a little different, true.
2449240	2451240	And I can get why they
2451240	2453240	explain the fungal infection
2453240	2455240	if it's just the viewers who aren't familiar
2455240	2457240	with the game or the lore.
2457240	2459240	That way people aren't just going to be like
2459240	2461240	oh wow, this is just like another
2461240	2463240	this is just like The Walking Dead
2463240	2465240	duh duh duh
2465240	2467240	Yeah, this was like uh
2467240	2469240	I can see the reason why they did that.
2469240	2471240	Hit that play button, Dev.
2471240	2473240	Let's go.
2473240	2475240	My play button's almost in the mail.
2475240	2477240	Hope I get it.
2477240	2479240	I don't know if you deserve it.
2479240	2481240	Why is every Mexican
2481240	2483240	drug dealer, Dev?
2489240	2491240	Communists.
2491240	2493240	Fucking communists.
2493240	2495240	Ruin everything.
2497240	2499240	I don't think she means that.
2499240	2501240	I think this setup
2511240	2513240	Wow.
2513240	2515240	That's different from the game.
2515240	2517240	Yeah.
2517240	2519240	Communists, more like bomb-unists.
2521240	2523240	Dev, seppuku, no.
2523240	2525240	I knew that would get you.
2529240	2531240	They don't care.
2531240	2533240	Like you could be.
2533240	2535240	They don't know.
2535240	2537240	Is that the...
2537240	2539240	Does she have
2539240	2541240	alcohol fetal syndrome?
2541240	2543240	Cause her face looks fucked.
2543240	2545240	How did they find
2545240	2547240	so many weird looking
2547240	2549240	female characters?
2549240	2551240	We went from Ellen Page.
2551240	2553240	What's wrong with her forehead?
2553240	2555240	It's huge.
2555240	2557240	You just landed a plane on it.
2557240	2559240	Her nose.
2559240	2561240	Dude, fuck.
2561240	2563240	That forehead's huge.
2563240	2565240	Kibs, give me your best Plinkett impression.
2565240	2567240	Like the size
2567240	2569240	of Russia is how big
2569240	2571240	her forehead is to the rest of us.
2571240	2573240	It's just a huge endless landscape.
2573240	2575240	Wow, she's giving the Roman salute.
2575240	2577240	That escalates it quick.
2581240	2583240	Hydra?
2585240	2587240	She has none of the charm.
2589240	2591240	Wow, I hate her already.
2591240	2593240	Why do you like this character?
2593240	2595240	She doesn't seem to have any of the charm
2595240	2597240	that Ellie had.
2597240	2599240	She's supposed to be charming?
2599240	2601240	She's got a big forehead, alien looking eyes.
2601240	2603240	Jesus.
2603240	2605240	She just delivered them
2605240	2607240	so not Ellie-like.
2607240	2609240	Wow, he's being sneaky.
2609240	2611240	Yeah, that's right.
2611240	2613240	Regular people can't leave the quarantine zone.
2613240	2615240	Can they?
2615240	2617240	Those get shot.
2617240	2619240	Lockdowns.
2619240	2621240	The quarantine zone?
2621240	2623240	I couldn't.
2623240	2625240	Yep.
2625240	2627240	That's why when the little kid waddled up, they let him in
2627240	2629240	but they did the test.
2629240	2631240	And if you're infected, they put you down.
2631240	2633240	Yeah.
2633240	2635240	No, I promised Robert that you wouldn't hurt him.
2635240	2637240	But I would very much like for you to hurt him.
2637240	2639240	So let's go hunt that motherfucker.
2639240	2641240	I know.
2641240	2643240	How dare you.
2643240	2645240	Women? Liars?
2645240	2647240	What?
2647240	2649240	Ellie-based.
2653240	2655240	She's not just a Mary Sue.
2655240	2657240	She's got an ass beat. Hard to be a Mary Sue with an ass beat.
2657240	2659240	Yeah.
2659240	2661240	Well, the game was made back in 2013
2661240	2663240	before a lot of the woke nonsense was everywhere.
2671240	2673240	Very inspirational.
2673240	2675240	Now this is new.
2675240	2677240	Seeing their perspective.
2685240	2687240	Okay. Listen up, fucking communists.
2691240	2693240	You're in a zombie apocalypse.
2693240	2695240	Military dictatorship is the best you can fucking hope for.
2695240	2697240	You're just killing humans now.
2697240	2699240	Disrupting supplies.
2699240	2701240	Ruining shit.
2701240	2703240	There's a lot of people.
2705240	2707240	We're quitting? I'd go where?
2707240	2709240	We're taking that random girl locked in that room.
2709240	2711240	West.
2711240	2713240	No, there's actually a reason for this.
2713240	2715240	Are the African American Women's Liberation Army the bad guys?
2715240	2717240	Yes.
2717240	2719240	Yes.
2719240	2721240	If you're thinking the Fireflies are
2721240	2723240	quote unquote good guys, they are not.
2723240	2725240	No.
2725240	2727240	Immediately. They're blowing shit up
2727240	2729240	in the only safe zone in the fucking...
2729240	2731240	I wouldn't consider these people good guys
2731240	2733240	regardless if they were supposed to be the good guys.
2733240	2735240	Well, they're also talking about democracy and freedom
2735240	2737240	though, you know. So, I don't know, maybe...
2737240	2739240	Here's the thing. If the show
2739240	2741240	was going to go down some kind of woke
2741240	2743240	rabbit hole, they would
2743240	2745240	make the Fireflies good guys.
2745240	2747240	Even though in the video game the Fireflies were
2747240	2749240	hypocrites. Yeah, they were just as bad
2749240	2751240	as the government was.
2751240	2753240	Yeah, that's what I remember doing.
2753240	2755240	If you're feeling loud...
2759240	2761240	You're rude.
2761240	2763240	Yeah, you just invited him to
2763240	2765240	join the communist movement. I wouldn't have
2765240	2767240	given him a warning.
2771240	2773240	Don't talk about this out walking down the street.
2773240	2775240	Listen, they need to for the audience's sake.
2775240	2777240	We've got to know what they're doing.
2777240	2779240	Yeah, how else would we know?
2779240	2781240	We're just going to have to guess.
2781240	2783240	Oh my god.
2785240	2787240	Oh yeah,
2787240	2789240	you totally look like the kind of
2789240	2791240	strong man to pull that fucking thing off
2791240	2793240	the wall.
2793240	2795240	Why did you stop him?
2795240	2797240	Don't zoom into the
2797240	2799240	forehead show. God dammit.
2799240	2801240	It's so big.
2801240	2803240	She might be an alien.
2803240	2805240	Doesn't she have alcohol, fetal syndrome?
2805240	2807240	Like for real.
2807240	2809240	Look it up, Dev. I think she has it.
2809240	2811240	She was in Game of Thrones.
2811240	2813240	Did she have alcohol,
2813240	2815240	fetal syndrome there too? Oh my god, it's not that
2815240	2817240	character, is it? It's the Bear Island
2817240	2819240	girl.
2821240	2823240	That's creepy.
2823240	2825240	Are you my fucking mom or something?
2825240	2827240	I look like your mom.
2827240	2829240	Yeah, that was pretty good.
2829240	2831240	That's a good point.
2831240	2833240	Terrorist?
2833240	2835240	Yes, terrorist.
2839240	2841240	Oh god, the Pito DLC.
2845240	2847240	Yeah, don't elaborate on that any further.
2847240	2849240	Just think about it.
2849240	2851240	I forgot about the Pito
2851240	2853240	DLC, okay?
2855240	2857240	Why is your face so flat?
2857240	2859240	It's like an anvil.
2859240	2861240	We could craft great weapons on it.
2861240	2863240	Jesus.
2863240	2865240	Shields are the finest
2865240	2867240	shields in armor.
2867240	2869240	You know it against her flat face.
2875240	2877240	There's an expansion they had
2877240	2879240	for Last of Us 1 where she has a
2879240	2881240	weird relationship as a child.
2881240	2883240	And it was like, ooh, that was just uncanny.
2883240	2885240	Well, it was with another child.
2885240	2887240	But it was still kind of strange to play through, I will admit.
2887240	2889240	They were like eight years old
2889240	2891240	or something.
2891240	2893240	They were kissing
2893240	2895240	and I was like, really? Do you need
2895240	2897240	to do that?
2897240	2899240	Like, wait until they're older, please.
2899240	2901240	Is this necessary?
2901240	2903240	No, it isn't.
2903240	2905240	Now to be fair, there wasn't any actual Pito
2905240	2907240	shit because there was no adults interacting with them.
2907240	2909240	I don't think kissing is inherently
2909240	2911240	so true.
2911240	2913240	It was uncanny.
2913240	2915240	I think it was more the fact that the player was playing
2915240	2917240	as it, you know?
2917240	2919240	That was a bit odd.
2919240	2921240	I just remember it was unsettling with our entire friend group
2921240	2923240	when we played it.
2923240	2925240	That's the one.
2925240	2927240	Because, I mean, Kibs, I don't know,
2927240	2929240	you remember being like nine or ten years old
2929240	2931240	and you get your first smooch from
2931240	2933240	a girl in your class and it's all innocent?
2933240	2935240	Yeah, but I want to see other
2935240	2937240	kids do that. That's weird.
2937240	2939240	You just want to do it yourself.
2939240	2941240	Yeah, when I did it as a kid,
2941240	2943240	that's fine. I don't want to see other people do that.
2943240	2945240	I think
2945240	2947240	for me,
2947240	2949240	it was playing as it
2949240	2951240	that was a bit strange.
2953240	2955240	Yep, there's a fungus person.
2955240	2957240	Also, they'd be infected right now.
2957240	2959240	Yeah, put on your masks.
2959240	2961240	Oh, there's no mask in the show! Fuck you!
2961240	2963240	I forgot!
2963240	2965240	No.
2967240	2969240	Yeah, they had gas masks.
2969240	2971240	Yeah, they had gas masks.
2971240	2973240	Because any time they turn into that,
2973240	2975240	they turn into sport producers.
2975240	2977240	But our friend Pedro
2977240	2979240	didn't want to wear masks
2979240	2981240	after the Mandalorian, so...
2981240	2983240	It's a see-through mask, even.
2983240	2985240	He negotiated masks
2985240	2987240	out of the lore, basically.
2987240	2989240	Are you serious?
2989240	2991240	There are rumors going around that he threw
2991240	2993240	a hissy fit during the Mandalorian.
2993240	2995240	That's why they took his helmet off that one episode
2995240	2997240	and that he refused to do anything like that again.
2997240	2999240	He's an actor with no integrity,
2999240	3001240	if that's the case.
3001240	3003240	I respect actors that wear helmets
3003240	3005240	and masks more than I do
3005240	3007240	those that don't.
3007240	3009240	I don't.
3009240	3011240	Those that don't.
3011240	3013240	The fuck?
3013240	3015240	Like the Tread remake?
3015240	3017240	That one...
3017240	3019240	That Tread happy mask on the entire time?
3019240	3021240	That was an excellent movie.
3021240	3023240	Great actor, too.
3023240	3025240	That was Carl Urban, right?
3025240	3027240	Yep.
3027240	3029240	Someone's red jelly is leaking out the side.
3029240	3033240	That doesn't look like gunpowder.
3033240	3035240	That's a hole.
3035240	3037240	Oh, someone already got to
3037240	3039240	the group.
3039240	3041240	And there's the battery.
3041240	3043240	That's
3043240	3045240	very convenient, yeah.
3045240	3047240	A little suspicious.
3047240	3049240	Wouldn't that be valuable?
3055240	3057240	Pull the trigger.
3057240	3059240	You'll save us all a lot of trouble.
3059240	3061240	So this is who Robert screwed us over with?
3061240	3063240	The Che Guevara of Boston?
3063240	3065240	Really warm up with going pretty shitty
3065240	3067240	for you to be buying from scumbags like him.
3067240	3069240	Yeah, it kind of has been.
3069240	3071240	The merch was bad, and he obviously didn't take fuck off for an answer.
3071240	3073240	Give me my knife.
3073240	3075240	What do you need a car battery for?
3075240	3077240	Go.
3077240	3079240	Not at her.
3079240	3081240	What do you mean?
3083240	3085240	Hey, trigger discipline, though.
3085240	3089240	That's a pretty basic test to use Che Guevara in a negative sense.
3089240	3091240	Yep.
3091240	3093240	You're remarkably chill for a woman whose spleen has been ventilated.
3093240	3095240	Yeah.
3111240	3113240	Jesus.
3113240	3115240	Oh, it is blown off, though.
3123240	3125240	What I do have is you.
3125240	3127240	And I know what you're both capable of.
3127240	3129240	For better or worse.
3131240	3133240	I don't think you know what the word squadron means.
3133240	3135240	You get her there safely,
3135240	3137240	and they'll give you what you deserve.
3137240	3139240	Yeah, it's not just a gang of people.
3139240	3141240	She's not a very good revolutionary, okay?
3141240	3143240	Arch, you gotta be gentle.
3143240	3145240	You'll talk it through, but please remember that I'm bleeding out.
3147240	3151240	Actually, I think that was her dialogue if you took too long.
3151240	3153240	Which is kind of funny.
3153240	3155240	It's like, hurry up!
3155240	3159240	Man, I kind of want to just push her nose in to make it flat with the rest of her face.
3159240	3161240	Jesus.
3161240	3163240	I mean, then we could use the anvil.
3163240	3165240	The anvil belly.
3165240	3167240	She could be a hammer.
3167240	3171240	She could. Like, grab her by the ankles and just wail her against the zombies.
3171240	3173240	It's a bit mean, but yeah, you could.
3173240	3175240	Don't fuck this up.
3175240	3177240	Effective.
3177240	3179240	Great blunt force damage.
3179240	3183240	You could kill many zombies with a hammer that heavy.
3183240	3185240	True.
3185240	3187240	Looks a bit unwieldy, though.
3187240	3191240	I remember when they made this deal, I think it was in a more open location, though.
3191240	3193240	Are you sure?
3193240	3197240	Yeah, because wasn't there a firefight that you played in game?
3197240	3199240	You just got to kill some people.
3201240	3205240	Because you got to shoot and stab people by this point.
3209240	3211240	She's just going to start stealing stuff.
3221240	3223240	Yeah, can she read? I wonder.
3225240	3227240	Yeah, I guess so.
3239240	3241240	Killing time.
3241240	3243240	I'm sure you'll figure that out.
3245240	3251240	There's plenty of alcohol on the table there, if you'd like to work on that thing of yours.
3261240	3265240	This is an uncomfortably long shot following that simple sentence.
3265240	3267240	Because he's having a little bit of PTSD.
3267240	3271240	Well, this is another scene they're perfectly recreating from the game.
3271240	3273240	Oh, the radio came on when you were sleeping.
3273240	3275240	What?
3275240	3277240	What was the song?
3277240	3279240	It kept saying, like, wake me up before you go-go.
3279240	3281240	Ha, ha, cursed.
3281240	3283240	Gotcha.
3283240	3285240	80s means trouble.
3285240	3287240	Code broken.
3287240	3289240	That's pretty good.
3289240	3291240	Pretty clever.
3291240	3293240	Well, Ellie was clever in the game, too.
3293240	3295240	You got a jacket in your pack?
3295240	3297240	Yeah.
3297240	3299240	Is she not wearing a jacket?
3299240	3301240	Yeah, that's a good point.
3301240	3303240	Ha, ha, ha, ha.
3303240	3305240	Two jackets.
3305240	3307240	All right, well, chilly, I guess.
3307240	3309240	Fair enough.
3309240	3311240	So far I'm liking the sets, though.
3311240	3313240	Yeah.
3313240	3315240	It seems like they sunk a lot of money into this.
3315240	3317240	And, I mean, I think you only see Boston.
3317240	3319240	Like, at this point, they leave Boston and don't come back, right?
3319240	3321240	So, it's not like you're going back to this set.
3321240	3323240	Yeah, that's true.
3323240	3325240	Because if they're ever in the game, they never come back to Boston.
3325240	3327240	Because, you know, they're leaving.
3327240	3329240	Well, the entrance just kind of looks like a prison.
3329240	3331240	They probably filled in the gates of a prison, I guess.
3331240	3333240	Yeah.
3333240	3335240	Just added to the game.
3335240	3337240	Yeah.
3337240	3339240	Yeah.
3339240	3341240	They probably filled in the gates of a prison, I guess.
3341240	3343240	Yeah.
3343240	3345240	Just added some stuff around.
3345240	3347240	Decorated the town to make it look a little run-down.
3347240	3349240	Yep.
3349240	3351240	Well, I think they intend to come back after this job.
3351240	3353240	They just don't because of reasons.
3355240	3361240	They were recording a Norwegian big movie set in the World War II once when I was in Oslo.
3361240	3363240	And there were swastikas everywhere.
3363240	3365240	And it made me feel a bit weird.
3365240	3367240	Ha, ha, ha.
3367240	3373240	Well, I didn't know. So I just walked down the street and there's a ginormous swastika hanging on Parliament.
3373240	3375240	I'm like, huh, something interesting has happened.
3375240	3377240	Ha, ha, ha.
3377240	3379240	That is something to see, yeah.
3379240	3381240	Ah, yes.
3381240	3383240	They're walking through the whole universe.
3383240	3385240	Change in policy, it seems.
3385240	3387240	Yeah.
3387240	3389240	That last election was pretty eventful.
3389240	3391240	Yep.
3391240	3397240	Also, like, they're recreating the levels.
3397240	3399240	Yeah, they actually are.
3399240	3403240	Because you go under a school bus and then through a ravine with concrete slabs.
3403240	3407240	They're actually just doing area for area from the game.
3407240	3409240	It's kind of incredible.
3409240	3413240	I can't tell if I haven't played it, but...
3413240	3415240	This feels like the game.
3415240	3419240	Did this fucking demolish the argument of every other poor adaptation, though?
3419240	3423240	This demolishes the Halo argument.
3423240	3427240	Where they're like, we couldn't just recreate the TV show, it'd be awful.
3427240	3431240	This is recreating the video game and it's actually interesting to watch.
3431240	3437240	Yeah, because they go under a school bus.
3437240	3439240	And do a pipe, yeah.
3439240	3441240	Through a ravine with concrete.
3441240	3443240	There's a red truck there.
3443240	3445240	And then they go into a pipe.
3445240	3447240	They remade the level for the set.
3447240	3449240	It's kind of nuts.
3449240	3453240	Yeah, that's probably going to be in the military class.
3453240	3455240	Yeah.
3455240	3457240	Mm-hmm.
3457240	3459240	That's correct, though.
3459240	3461240	That should be coming up soon.
3461240	3463240	There it is.
3463240	3465240	He's pissed again.
3465240	3467240	You gotta shoot him.
3473240	3479240	That thing is going to beep red, ain't it?
3479240	3483240	Not on her or him, but on that chick.
3483240	3485240	Great.
3499240	3501240	Yeah.
3503240	3509240	That's a good research and flashback.
3517240	3519240	He'll be dead soon.
3519240	3521240	He's probably dead now.
3521240	3523240	See, I think this is actually new to the show.
3523240	3527240	Yeah, I don't remember him having a spur go.
3527240	3529240	But that's, again...
3533240	3535240	Nobody lasts more than a day.
3535240	3537240	Just look at the health to you.
3537240	3539240	You would have killed me.
3539240	3541240	When did it happen?
3541240	3543240	It doesn't matter. You have to trust me.
3543240	3545240	They're going to catch you if we don't run.
3545240	3547240	Joe, we gotta move.
3547240	3549240	Yeah, I think it happened later, though.
3549240	3551240	It was a different moment.
3551240	3553240	Mm-hmm.
3553240	3555240	I think. It's been a while for me, too.
3555240	3557240	Yeah, take the gun, dude. Take the gun.
3557240	3559240	Nice.
3559240	3561240	Good upgrade.
3561240	3563240	I would have checked his body for some ammo, but, you know.
3563240	3565240	So they're hitting all the story beats.
3565240	3567240	They're changing things a little bit
3567240	3569240	just to make it work for TV,
3569240	3571240	but they're not changing it ridiculously.
3571240	3573240	It's not like the Halo TV show
3573240	3575240	where it has nothing to do with Halo at all.
3575240	3577240	Wait, what song is this?
3577240	3579240	That scene looks pretty good, too.
3579240	3581240	It's easy.
3585240	3587240	Is that the Tilted Towers?
3587240	3589240	Yes.
3591240	3593240	There's that one, like...
3593240	3595240	There's that one
3595240	3597240	very well-known level
3597240	3599240	that happens in a Tilted Tower
3599240	3601240	that looks exactly like that.
3601240	3603240	They're doing so much stuff just for the fans,
3603240	3605240	you know what I mean?
3605240	3607240	There's a few inaccuracies here and there, though.
3607240	3609240	Like, you know, his daughter being black,
3609240	3611240	and her daughter was literally white-haired, blue-eyed.
3611240	3613240	I'm going to pause this so I don't get fucking copyrighted
3613240	3615240	any more than I already am.
3615240	3617240	Listen, Kyle, it's the current year.
3617240	3619240	They had to do something like that.
3619240	3621240	I know, but it's our job to look at it with a critical eye,
3621240	3623240	so there are some differences.
3623240	3625240	But Joel's hairdo,
3625240	3627240	like on the actor,
3627240	3629240	the facial hair, the hairstyle,
3629240	3631240	him getting the, you know,
3631240	3635240	black and salt and black pepper-like style hair,
3635240	3637240	where it's mixed with grey there,
3637240	3639240	that's accurate.
3639240	3641240	That is on the right path there.
3641240	3643240	A lot of stuff is just shot-for-shot identical.
3643240	3645240	A lot of stuff,
3645240	3647240	they try to deliver the lines the same way.
3647240	3649240	They make some mistakes here and there,
3649240	3651240	they change a few things,
3651240	3653240	but it's overall, like,
3653240	3655240	very faithful.
3655240	3659240	Looks pretty much just like she did in the game.
3659240	3661240	Really? I thought she had frizzy hair in the game.
3661240	3663240	She had frizzy hair,
3663240	3665240	but she pretty much looks right.
3665240	3667240	With Ellie,
3667240	3669240	I get what everybody's saying.
3669240	3671240	I think she, at the very least,
3671240	3673240	sounds a bit like Ellie,
3673240	3675240	at the very least, like her tones and inclinations.
3675240	3677240	She sounds a bit like her,
3677240	3679240	but she doesn't look like her,
3679240	3681240	and doesn't have the body language of her.
3681240	3683240	So for the actress who's playing Ellie,
3683240	3685240	she's actually doing a pretty convincing job
3685240	3687240	of winning me over via time,
3687240	3689240	but, like, definitely the opening shot.
3689240	3693240	She doesn't quite have the look of Ellie, though.
3693240	3695240	Yeah.
3695240	3697240	So, Arch, you don't know any of this stuff, right?
3697240	3699240	You're completely ignorant of all this.
3699240	3701240	He's just a blondie, that's true.
3701240	3703240	From what I see,
3703240	3705240	Ellie's character is,
3705240	3707240	from the TV show, not the TV show,
3707240	3709240	the game,
3709240	3711240	from the screenshot, she looks clearly designed
3711240	3713240	to be young and cute-looking.
3713240	3715240	Like, innocent is a better word.
3715240	3717240	You know?
3717240	3719240	Little upturned nose, blue inquisitive eyes,
3719240	3721240	small mouth, et cetera,
3721240	3723240	very clearly designed to
3723240	3725240	give an idea of innocence, right?
3725240	3727240	She looks like a kid.
3727240	3729240	This character in the TV show,
3729240	3731240	she doesn't look like a kid.
3731240	3733240	She looks like a grown woman
3733240	3735240	that's been dressed up as a child
3735240	3737240	for reasons.
3737240	3739240	Yeah.
3739240	3741240	Looked it up, her actress
3741240	3743240	is, uh,
3743240	3745240	19 years old now.
3745240	3747240	When she first came to prominence,
3747240	3749240	it was... Really?
3749240	3751240	She looks a lot older than that.
3751240	3753240	She's 19. When she first came to prominence,
3753240	3755240	was
3755240	3757240	in 2016
3757240	3759240	in Game of Thrones
3759240	3761240	Season 6. So how many years ago
3761240	3763240	was that? Seven years ago. So she was
3763240	3765240	what, 12 back then? As Leanna
3765240	3767240	Mormont, she actually looks like she could be Ellie.
3767240	3769240	Leanna Mormont, she looks
3769240	3771240	more like Ellie.
3771240	3773240	She looks like she could be Ellie at
3773240	3775240	that age, but she was, she was 12
3775240	3777240	in that photo. How old was
3777240	3779240	Ellie in the video game? Do you remember?
3779240	3781240	I think she was between 12 and 14.
3781240	3783240	Okay, gotcha.
3783240	3785240	They're probably just like, oh, she was
3785240	3787240	great in Game of Thrones, and they're like, wait, that was
3787240	3789240	seven years ago.
3789240	3791240	Yeah, it's like she's a little too old now.
3791240	3793240	It's also just that her
3793240	3795240	facial features are wrong
3795240	3797240	for this. Like,
3797240	3799240	as a kid, she looked
3799240	3801240	alright for the role, but now
3801240	3803240	she,
3803240	3805240	she looks,
3805240	3807240	she's got this weird androgynous
3807240	3809240	feel to her, and she looks
3809240	3811240	way older than
3811240	3813240	19. Is that just me?
3813240	3815240	I could see her 19, but she does definitely
3815240	3817240	look more androgynous than Ellie looked.
3817240	3819240	Ellie was not an androgynous character. Okay, Arx,
3819240	3821240	this is more for your benefit,
3821240	3823240	but it will be interesting to compare.
3823240	3825240	This is from The Last of Us Part 1 Remake.
3825240	3827240	It's a remake of the original game. All the
3827240	3829240	Joel and Ellie cutscenes. We're just going to watch a few,
3829240	3831240	and we're not going to watch all of them, and we're not going to watch the whole
3831240	3833240	thing, but I just want to show you
3833240	3835240	specifically, like...
3841240	3843240	Let her go.
3855240	3857240	Yeah, you were right, Kibbs. They were in a
3857240	3859240	room, not a hallway.
3871240	3893240	So, they're hitting the
3893240	3895240	same story beats, and they're doing kind of
3895240	3897240	the same things.
3897240	3899240	I think they have to change some of it,
3899240	3901240	but it seems reasonably faithful.
3903240	3905240	This is the same scene.
3929240	3947240	So, again, same scene. They just kind of paste it differently.
3947240	3949240	I think I've heard the original for this one.
3949240	3953240	Well, I still think the video game does a lot of things always better.
3953240	3955240	Yeah.
3955240	3957240	Because it was how the vision was intended to be.
3957240	3959240	Yeah, me too.
3959240	3961240	Alright.
3963240	3967240	Yeah, this scene was different.
3967240	3969240	Yep, because it was a soldier, they didn't have a history with it.
3969240	3971240	Yeah.
3971240	3973240	That was added for the show, I think.
3979240	3981240	They also called it in right away.
3985240	3987240	Yep.
3989240	3991240	Yep.
4015240	4017240	No, they do find out here.
4017240	4019240	Yep.
4045240	4047240	It's three weeks old.
4047240	4049240	No, everyone turns within two days, so you stop bullshitting.
4049240	4051240	It's three weeks.
4051240	4053240	I swear.
4053240	4055240	Why would she set you up?
4059240	4063240	They take a lot better time explaining it here, though.
4063240	4079240	They do, but I will say I think showing the PTSD was probably a better way to do the scene.
4079240	4081240	Yeah, a couple of things.
4081240	4085240	Joel had a better reaction in the show.
4085240	4089240	Now, a soldier being on guard by himself is fucking retarded.
4089240	4091240	That was a good scene.
4091240	4095240	The PTSD was well explained, and it makes Joel feel more human.
4095240	4099240	Whereas here, they both just fucking coldheartedly kill a couple of soldiers like it's nothing.
4099240	4101240	Yes.
4101240	4103240	Ellie's reaction, too, I think I know what I don't like.
4103240	4107240	Because this Ellie is way softer, gentler.
4107240	4111240	She feels younger, more naive.
4111240	4115240	Like she doesn't understand the seriousness of the situation.
4115240	4117240	When she stabs the soldiers, she says, sorry.
4117240	4119240	I thought we were just going to hold them up.
4119240	4121240	TV show, none of that.
4121240	4123240	She just stabs them.
4123240	4129240	The far more innocent delivery makes me instantly feel more for her.
4129240	4131240	It makes her feel like a young kid in need of protection.
4131240	4137240	Whereas in the TV show, there's far too much strong female character in the mix.
4137240	4141240	Yeah, she needs to be a little bit more naive.
4141240	4145240	Ellie is a strong little lady, and she can actually take a punch.
4145240	4149240	She's also extremely vulgar, even in the game.
4149240	4153240	But she also is inexperienced, and so death is still hard for her.
4153240	4161240	Now, in the video game, it makes a lot more sense that Joel and Tess aren't bothered by death as much, because they've dealt with it so much.
4161240	4163240	They've become desensitized to it.
4163240	4167240	That's why in the video game, they're not bothered by killing, because they've killed before.
4167240	4169240	Many times.
4169240	4181240	In the show, it's implied that they've killed two, but in the game, by the time you get to the end of episode one in the show, you've already killed dozens, if not a hundred people.
4181240	4183240	Yeah, you could kill a lot of people over the course of the game.
4183240	4185240	It is because of a video game, yes.
4185240	4187240	But I think you're right, Arch.
4187240	4197240	In case you haven't been able to tell at this point, they're trying to do a Joel finds a replacement daughter storyline, obviously, right?
4197240	4203240	And to do that, you have to have Ellie be at least kinda likable.
4203240	4207240	Well, she needs to be a kid.
4207240	4209240	Yeah.
4209240	4213240	The character in the TV show does not strike me as a kid at all.
4213240	4221240	At the absolute most optimistic, she strikes me as a late teenage know-it-all.
4221240	4235240	I looked it up, she's 14 in the first game, she's 12 during the Discovering I'm a Lesbian DLC, and she's 19 in the second game.
4235240	4239240	She doesn't seem like a 14-year-old in this show.
4239240	4245240	Again, I think that is the thing. There's too much strong female in this.
4245240	4249240	Yeah, the whole stabbing the guy and just go rawr at the same time.
4249240	4257240	And the thing is too, in the clip you showed there where she tried to do the whole stabby thing to begin with, she was clearly shit at it.
4257240	4259240	And she was caught easily.
4259240	4265240	Whereas in the TV show, she straight up fucking ambushes Joel, and it's only because he's a ninja that he manages to stop her.
4265240	4269240	Let's go, episode 2. Enough intermission.
4269240	4271240	Well, this definitely wasn't in the game.
4271240	4273240	Nope.
4273240	4283240	Jakarta, Indonesia. Wow, we've seen change rather violently. Please speak English. You know you want to.
4283240	4287240	Hello!
4287240	4289240	We are looking for zombies.
4289240	4297240	Wait, they're going to do a racist food thing, aren't they? You guys ate some weird mushrooms and now we're all infected.
4303240	4313240	This is all new.
4313240	4321240	You say that, but we're going to show you something interesting now.
4321240	4323240	Oh damn.
4323240	4325240	I didn't need that video game.
4325240	4330240	Wait, do I have to censor these boobs? No! Extra work!
4330240	4332240	Why do you have to censor the pubes, too?
4332240	4336240	Why do you have to support them, isn't it? They'll free the nipple.
4336240	4338240	Mmm.
4338240	4340240	You jailed the nipple. Now.
4340240	4348240	Oh luckily she took time to paint her toes. Isn't that nice?
4348240	4349240	Ooh.
4349240	4352240	Yeah, it's fungus on the inside.
4352240	4356240	She's going to chomp.
4356240	4359240	Nah, she'd open her eyes first so she'd really freak out.
4359240	4361240	Wriggly tentacles?
4361240	4365240	The little tendrils in the mouth, that's new, Dev, isn't it?
4365240	4372240	Yeah, that's the transmission method now. Because, remember, they removed the spores. They now transmit via tentacle sex.
4372240	4379240	That's why when they were on top of people they kept, like, mouthing over them because the tentacles were planting more fungi bits.
4379240	4382240	It still feels like an unnecessary change, if you ask me.
4400240	4404240	That is admirably cold and I appreciate that.
4404240	4409240	I like how the turtle dude's like, holy shit.
4415240	4421240	Hold on. Wait on your woman moment for a second.
4421240	4428240	At least be like, wait to bomb till I've left with my family. But no, she's like, I just won't go home and get bombed now.
4428240	4433240	Well, she's probably thinking that she might be infected because she was just in there, right?
4433240	4436240	Possibly. She was in a vacuum-sealed suit.
4436240	4438240	Yeah.
4438240	4440240	Plus, remember, again, it's not airborne.
4440240	4444240	This intro is still creatively bankrupt. I can't get over it.
4444240	4453240	It's like, I don't like these deviations. It feels like the show is thinking to itself, are you actually kind of wanting to do a different zombie apocalypse thing?
4453240	4459240	They're like, we don't need these 10 minutes, this is what happened befores.
4459240	4468240	Yeah, because all these scenes are is trying to justify the changes to the lore as to why it's not spore-based anymore, which is retarded.
4468240	4471240	It's like 20 minutes of pointless justification.
4471240	4475240	Because the zombies are spores.
4475240	4482240	So the reason why that zombie was on the wall arch is because at the next stage what happens is they start emitting those spores.
4482240	4485240	Because that's how they continue to infect and continue to spread.
4485240	4488240	Yeah, they're in giant mushrooms, they just start blowing spores everywhere.
4488240	4493240	Yeah, but now that doesn't make any sense for them to do that. There's no reason for it.
4493240	4499240	The whole point of the zombie reproduction in the game is that it would make spore zones underground.
4499240	4506240	Yep. And that has now been invalidated, which kind of undermines the whole reproductive process.
4506240	4511240	I think the reason that the clickers were blind is because they were sensitive to light.
4511240	4515240	And so that drove them underground to...
4516240	4524240	Sensitive to UV, hence why the clickers when they're at that stage go underground to then turn into the big giant spores which produce more airborne spores.
4524240	4527240	They just watch all night to make sure she didn't turn overnight.
4531240	4534240	That's Boston. I think any spot is as good as any other.
4536240	4538240	Just you.
4538240	4540240	That's funny.
4542240	4544240	I mean you can still just piss in the toilet.
4544240	4546240	Racism against the infected.
4549240	4551240	Delicious hardtack.
4552240	4554240	Bit chewy.
4554240	4556240	Raises the bugs.
4556240	4558240	Is it chicken?
4558240	4560240	Yep.
4560240	4562240	Or until they get it from smugglers.
4564240	4566240	Guess not you guys.
4567240	4569240	Ouch.
4571240	4574240	Because you are. Because you're 19.
4586240	4590240	You know what? This scene is the same as the game as well.
4590240	4592240	They're really sticking to it.
4592240	4594240	I had the same conversation.
4594240	4596240	Yep, the exact same conversation. Same lines.
4603240	4605240	That's kind of funny.
4607240	4609240	Pick up your sandwich.
4609240	4611240	Yeah, eat your fucking chicken sandwich. What's wrong?
4611240	4613240	Absolutely not.
4613240	4616240	Okay, Jesus, fine. I'll just have a fucking sandwich out there.
4617240	4619240	Let me turn up.
4624240	4626240	Jurassic Park theme music.
4628240	4630240	Just because it's got overgrown buildings.
4633240	4635240	Look, there's even the dinosaurs there.
4635240	4637240	That's not dinosaurs. Those are birds.
4637240	4640240	Birds, dinosaurs, Kyle. That's what Jurassic Park told me.
4640240	4643240	He's like, the word to dinosaurs waxes.
4643240	4645240	We should get moving.
4645240	4647240	Before the T-Rex finds us.
4647240	4650240	And, dude, they have the same leaning tower. It's great.
4650240	4652240	They knew what was iconic about the first game.
4652240	4654240	And they put it in there.
4655240	4658240	So we could do this. So we could basically be like, I member.
4658240	4661240	Yep. I'm membering.
4661240	4664240	I wonder how much of this is CG and how much of it is like they dressed up a street.
4665240	4668240	Well, the crumbly towers, I would have to say, are definitely CG.
4674240	4676240	Oh, they're doing the hotel.
4676240	4679240	This is CG. You can actually see the hard cuts slightly off in the distance.
4679240	4681240	Yeah.
4682240	4685240	See, they're going to the hotel and they're just doing the levels of the game.
4685240	4688240	It's kind of nice to see them just stick to it.
4694240	4696240	Are you there alone?
4697240	4699240	Yeah.
4700240	4702240	How old are you?
4702240	4703240	Fourteen.
4703240	4705240	Nineteen.
4705240	4708240	Mommy, you got some balls on you, sister.
4709240	4710240	Thanks.
4710240	4713240	Also, you weren't alone in there, you liar.
4714240	4716240	Don't bring up that cringey DLC.
4716240	4718240	I played the DLC.
4718240	4720240	Nobody's going to be coming after you, right?
4720240	4723240	Like mom, dad, boyfriend.
4723240	4726240	I'm an orphan and no.
4728240	4731240	Because she's a lesbian.
4732240	4733240	Did she know that?
4733240	4736240	Hey, that DLC was made during current year policy.
4736240	4741240	To be fair, she didn't point it out cringily like that one scene in Discovery
4741240	4745240	where they force the pronouns in out of nowhere.
4745240	4746240	It makes no fucking sense.
4746240	4748240	They just use these pronouns to this character.
4748240	4750240	It's like, oh, Jesus, why is this in the script?
4750240	4752240	She could have made a deal out of it.
4752240	4754240	And they're like, no, actually, I'm a lesbian.
4754240	4756240	It's my identity.
4756240	4757240	And she didn't.
4757240	4758240	And I munch rug.
4758240	4759240	And she didn't.
4759240	4761240	Just let it be.
4763240	4765240	That was the mating call of the average Bostonian.
4765240	4767240	Wow, food.
4767240	4768240	Yeah, man.
4768240	4769240	Mm, ducks.
4769240	4771240	Put bullets inside of them.
4773240	4774240	Oh, look.
4774240	4775240	Stop it, frog.
4775240	4778240	Pepe is playing a tune.
4779240	4782240	I know this, that's pretty cool.
4782240	4784240	Yeah, this is the hotel lobby, right?
4784240	4785240	Yeah.
4785240	4790240	I feel like wandering around in knee-high water with a zombie infection around is a terrible idea.
4790240	4792240	But then again, that's just me.
4792240	4793240	Yeah.
4793240	4795240	You could get a cut, an injury, you could trip.
4795240	4800240	Yeah, just in general, wandering around in knee-high, stale water is a bad idea.
4803240	4804240	That is plastic.
4804240	4807240	And you can see the fucking plastic mold lines.
4807240	4808240	Yep.
4808240	4810240	Oh, good attempt, I guess.
4810240	4811240	Yep.
4811240	4812240	And you know what?
4812240	4816240	To the story's credit, she's acting a bit more naive this episode.
4816240	4817240	Would you want an arch?
4817240	4821240	I mean, that was incredibly annoying, the thing she just did, but yeah.
4821240	4824240	Well, naivety and annoyingness kind of go together.
4824240	4827240	She's pretty much acted like this in the game too, so.
4827240	4828240	Yep, yep.
4828240	4831240	They're doing just shot for shot, scene for scene, interaction for interaction.
4831240	4833240	They're just making the show.
4833240	4835240	No excuses, no nonsense.
4835240	4836240	No, we can't do this.
4836240	4839240	No, there's not enough content in the original lore.
4839240	4840240	They're just doing it.
4840240	4842240	I'm very impressed.
4845240	4847240	Just shoulder the doors in, man, it's okay.
4847240	4848240	Right, well.
4848240	4850240	It's like 56.
4850240	4852240	You fucking shoulder the door in.
4852240	4858240	They do have high-powered fucking rifles, so, you know, opening the door wouldn't actually be a problem.
4858240	4862240	Yeah, a locked door in an abandoned post-apocalyptic building is not that big of a deal.
4862240	4865240	Well, you don't want to waste ammunition.
4865240	4868240	You also don't want to make the lock noises.
4868240	4871240	Also, Mythbusters did...
4874240	4877240	You can actually shoot locks off with them.
4877240	4878240	Oh, you can't?
4878240	4879240	Yeah.
4879240	4881240	Oh, you absolutely can.
4881240	4882240	You just need to know where the lock is.
4882240	4886240	You don't shoot the lock, you shoot the locking pin.
4886240	4891240	You know, the whole Ellie with the switchblade thing was actually a game mechanic,
4891240	4894240	because the shivs you could craft were like insta-kill for zombies.
4894240	4898240	Whenever you played as Ellie, she had a knife that could just insta-kill constantly to make it easier.
4898240	4901240	I actually like this more...
4903240	4905240	...sympathetic Joe.
4905240	4906240	Or Joe.
4906240	4907240	Joel.
4907240	4908240	Joel, you got it right.
4908240	4909240	Whatever the hell he is.
4909240	4912240	Because he's not just a killing machine, he's just a human now.
4912240	4914240	Well, yeah, he's on a video game.
4914240	4917240	Video games, you gotta have action sequences or...
4917240	4918240	Big game boring.
4918240	4921240	Where you stealth kill 30 soldiers.
4922240	4923240	That was always funny.
4923240	4927240	Wow, the dye in those pillows have survived remarkably well.
4927240	4928240	Hold on, hold on.
4928240	4933240	They've completely remade that one scene.
4933240	4934240	Do you recognize this, Kibbs?
4934240	4936240	Yes, I do.
4936240	4938240	Yeah, it's the first encounter with a clicker.
4938240	4940240	They remade the set.
4940240	4943240	Like, talk about attention to detail.
4943240	4946240	Oh, that's a good one.
4946240	4948240	It's pretty much just like from the game.
4948240	4949240	Yep.
4951240	4952240	Well, that's disgusting.
4952240	4954240	Why are they doing that?
4954240	4956240	Zombie orgy, baby.
4971240	4973240	Oh, they're back in the sun.
4973240	4974240	Yeah.
4983240	4987240	I don't remember dead, though.
4987240	4989240	The underground fiber optic.
4989240	4990240	Yep.
4990240	4992240	We're doing the fucking Avatar thing.
4992240	4994240	Because fungi are intelligent now.
4994240	4997240	I'm pretty sure we've seen like underground corsets and stuff.
4997240	4998240	No.
4998240	5000240	We have, but not to the way she just described it.
5000240	5001240	That was different.
5001240	5002240	Yeah, it doesn't work like that.
5002240	5005240	The Sebi, like hive mind stuff, that's new.
5005240	5008240	Oh, it's the zombies that are communists.
5009240	5012240	They're all collectivized.
5012240	5015240	Well, you're saying this shell is actually based.
5015240	5019240	Okay, you just said that if you touch some of the cordyceps,
5019240	5021240	everyone around knows, right?
5021240	5022240	Are you going to go into this really?
5022240	5024240	Don't touch it, dude.
5024240	5026240	Dry and dead, I guess.
5026240	5029240	It's still weird that they're near it.
5029240	5030240	Yeah.
5030240	5032240	Without masks.
5033240	5037240	I guess this is their way to try and replicate the feel
5037240	5041240	of unease of entering a bungled environment
5041240	5043240	without having the breathable spores.
5043240	5044240	Yeah.
5044240	5045240	I guess.
5045240	5046240	Yeah.
5048240	5050240	Again, I don't see, no, no,
5050240	5052240	I do see the point of why they did remove the mask.
5052240	5056240	It's because Pablo Escobar there needs to be visualized.
5056240	5057240	Yep.
5057240	5058240	Congratulations.
5058240	5060240	That's why we have the unnecessary flashbacks
5060240	5063240	that add really nothing, but just exposition.
5063240	5066240	You know, at least the environments look good again.
5066240	5067240	Yeah.
5067240	5070240	Covered in the fungus, it looks like it's infected.
5070240	5072240	It's weird without the masks and, you know,
5072240	5074240	having to worry about that.
5074240	5075240	The Boston Tea Party,
5075240	5077240	where a bunch of Americans dressed up in blackface
5077240	5079240	and threw British tea overboard.
5079240	5081240	They're pretty based.
5085240	5087240	Yeah, clickers.
5091240	5094240	I've been attacked by one and it wasn't like that.
5096240	5100240	Okay, from this point forward, we are silent,
5100240	5104240	not quiet, silent, well, no question.
5104240	5106240	You're still whispering, though.
5106240	5107240	Ah, yes.
5107240	5108240	Old wooden stairs.
5108240	5111240	The quietest approach ever.
5111240	5112240	Well, what do you want?
5112240	5114240	You want them to fly up there?
5114240	5115240	True.
5115240	5118240	They don't have much of a choice, but...
5118240	5120240	It's like he kind of undivides this whole thing.
5120240	5122240	Like, we're gonna be quiet, not here, not...
5122240	5124240	Hmm, cannons.
5125240	5128240	And this is where you unlock the shotgun.
5133240	5135240	From Fallout 4.
5137240	5139240	You know, houses don't behave like that.
5139240	5141240	They don't just randomly go,
5141240	5143240	eh, I'm gonna collapse now.
5143240	5145240	Yeah, it's like a slow process.
5146240	5148240	Oh, there it is.
5148240	5150240	Oh, my God, what was that?
5150240	5151240	It was data.
5151240	5153240	A zombie.
5153240	5155240	Yup, there's the clickies.
5155240	5156240	Yep.
5156240	5159240	The reason they click is because they use echolocation,
5159240	5161240	because they can't see.
5161240	5164240	No, that's not the case, Dev.
5164240	5166240	That's not how echolocation works.
5166240	5169240	Yeah, but that's how it works in the game.
5169240	5170240	And also...
5170240	5172240	That's not how this works.
5172240	5173240	And the reason they can't see
5173240	5176240	is because they're really sensitive to light now.
5176240	5179240	After they've been affected for this long.
5179240	5181240	Yep, their face is just a big mushroom now.
5181240	5183240	Are they immune to bullets?
5183240	5185240	Nope.
5185240	5187240	It takes a lot of them.
5187240	5190240	Remember, shooting a gun in a city filled with zamboos.
5190240	5194240	Also, if you're fighting an echolocative enemy,
5194240	5196240	you don't want to be shooting.
5196240	5197240	Actually, you do.
5197240	5199240	Do you? Why?
5199240	5202240	Because it'll blow out their fucking ears.
5202240	5204240	No, no, not really.
5204240	5205240	No, they will.
5205240	5207240	Why do you think sonar stops working
5207240	5210240	when there's like death charges nearby?
5210240	5211240	Oh, fair enough, eh?
5211240	5214240	I mean, in the game, if you shoot, they all just charge you.
5214240	5215240	So...
5222240	5224240	Watch where you're running, man.
5224240	5226240	It's like those enemies in Resident Evil
5226240	5229240	where you got to hit gongs to make them run around.
5229240	5230240	Oh god, I remember this.
5230240	5233240	Zoom in so that you can't see the zombie getting closer.
5233240	5235240	That way, when the zombie suddenly appears,
5235240	5238240	Kyle will be frightened and scream like a woman.
5238240	5240240	Here we go.
5240240	5241240	Hi.
5244240	5246240	Eh, less of a jump scare than I expected.
5246240	5247240	I actually kind of appreciate the fact
5247240	5249240	they're trying to build the atmosphere
5249240	5251240	instead of simply just a boop.
5251240	5253240	Luckily, the ancient wooden floor
5253240	5255240	has stopped creaking at this point.
5255240	5257240	The topic of Kyle being a woman,
5257240	5260240	why do you keep drawing yourself with boobs
5260240	5263240	and pregnant and womb tattoos?
5263240	5264240	Kibs, you've got to tell us something.
5264240	5266240	What's going on here?
5266240	5267240	It's not my fault.
5267240	5269240	I can't control the artists.
5270240	5272240	The fan art of you being a girl?
5272240	5274240	It's out of control.
5274240	5275240	Oh.
5278240	5280240	I'm going to kill a sperm zombie.
5282240	5285240	I feel like the gut shots aren't really working, my dude.
5285240	5287240	There you go.
5287240	5288240	There we go.
5288240	5293240	You've got to blow off the giant mushroom on their heads.
5296240	5298240	And there you go.
5298240	5300240	It seems like head shots do just fine,
5300240	5301240	so it seems like the best way to deal with them
5301240	5302240	is to walk up to one,
5302240	5306240	rest the .357 against their heads, and boom.
5306240	5309240	Well, they're lucky that there's only two.
5309240	5311240	Yeah, when there's a lot of them, you're kind of fucked.
5311240	5313240	Are you fucking kidding me?
5315240	5318240	And again, I mean, if it was going to happen to one of us.
5320240	5321240	It's fair.
5321240	5322240	Yeah.
5322240	5325240	So do these zombies react to noise?
5325240	5326240	Is that it is?
5326240	5327240	Because.
5327240	5328240	Yep.
5328240	5329240	I do.
5329240	5330240	I don't seem to.
5330240	5331240	In the game, you can like.
5331240	5332240	You can use noises.
5332240	5333240	Yeah.
5333240	5334240	No, it looks scary.
5334240	5336240	That was scary.
5336240	5337240	This is wood.
5339240	5340240	OK, child.
5340240	5341240	Just wait there.
5341240	5342240	You're falling.
5342240	5343240	Give us a minute.
5343240	5344240	Let's go.
5344240	5345240	Go watch it.
5350240	5352240	Pedro thinks you're being a bit fucking snappy.
5355240	5357240	This is actually the way it was in the game, too.
5357240	5361240	She was in charge and he was kind of being ordered around
5361240	5363240	and was kind of a big old grump about everything.
5367240	5368240	Hey, Collin.
5368240	5369240	Yep.
5369240	5373240	OK, is this where the trip wires start coming in?
5373240	5376240	Well, I can't remember.
5376240	5379240	Lilith, how about you?
5379240	5381240	Because, like, this looks like a level from the game,
5381240	5383240	Kibbs and Lilith, if you remember.
5383240	5384240	This is.
5384240	5385240	Yeah.
5385240	5388240	There was a trip wire between the front of the truck
5388240	5390240	and the car in the background.
5390240	5394240	They positioned it like exactly like the level was.
5394240	5397240	There's such incredible attention to detail.
5397240	5399240	Probably almost too much, you know.
5403240	5404240	Not enough.
5404240	5405240	Halo.
5405240	5406240	Yeah, fuck.
5406240	5407240	Or like Kenobi or whatever.
5407240	5408240	Fuck.
5408240	5409240	Holy shit.
5409240	5412240	So many bad shows and movies out there.
5416240	5417240	Oh, hey, look.
5417240	5418240	There's a shotgun.
5418240	5420240	He can unlock it now.
5420240	5422240	That's something, right?
5422240	5425240	Our luck had to run out sooner or later.
5425240	5427240	All right, here we go.
5427240	5429240	Fuck.
5429240	5430240	He's infected.
5430240	5431240	Oh, fuck.
5435240	5436240	He's sleeping now.
5447240	5448240	Yeah, it's moving.
5448240	5451240	They all know, baby.
5451240	5452240	This is new, by the way.
5452240	5453240	This is new.
5453240	5456240	Yes, this is new.
5456240	5458240	So, gunshots, no big deal.
5458240	5461240	But the Myconial Network?
5461240	5463240	Well.
5463240	5467240	Yeah, I'm not sure I feel less than that.
5467240	5471240	Well, I think in the game, like, it's soldiers that chase them.
5471240	5473240	Yeah, soldiers show up here, yeah.
5473240	5476240	And you have to fight off a bunch of human enemies.
5477240	5479240	Now it's zombies.
5479240	5481240	Because Federer does show up.
5481240	5482240	Yeah.
5482240	5483240	All of them.
5483240	5484240	Maybe a minute.
5484240	5490240	Interestingly, they seem to be going more for the idea of the main characters being human.
5490240	5493240	Like, they're not vilifying Federer.
5493240	5494240	Yeah.
5497240	5498240	What are you doing?
5498240	5500240	Making sure that they don't follow you.
5500240	5503240	I mean, even in the game, Federer wasn't, quote, unquote, evil.
5503240	5505240	They were doing what they had to do to survive.
5505240	5507240	Yeah, you were killing them by the dozen, I bet.
5507240	5508240	You were.
5508240	5509240	You were.
5509240	5511240	I mean, they were also pretty...
5511240	5514240	They were sometimes a bit too far.
5514240	5518240	They still, like, indiscriminately, you know, hung people in the town square.
5518240	5520240	Say who you can say.
5520240	5521240	Well, criminals.
5521240	5523240	But we didn't know.
5523240	5525240	Yeah, communist dev criminals.
5525240	5528240	Yeah, they were military court, you know.
5528240	5529240	Pretty fair and balanced.
5529240	5531240	Yeah.
5531240	5533240	Dev's like, I don't believe this.
5533240	5537240	Oh, okay, that's different.
5537240	5538240	Yeah, this isn't...
5538240	5540240	Didn't she just kill herself, if I remember right?
5540240	5541240	Yeah, she shot herself.
5541240	5543240	There was no, like, heroic standoff.
5543240	5545240	No, she fought off the soldiers, and then...
5545240	5546240	Oh, that's right, yeah, yeah.
5546240	5551240	She killed, I believe, two, and then she got killed by the soldiers afterwards.
5551240	5553240	Right, right, right.
5553240	5560240	As the player, you actually get a chance to ambush the soldiers afterwards and get revenge for the test.
5560240	5562240	Or you could just run away.
5563240	5566240	Alright, you better do it.
5570240	5572240	Oh, come on.
5577240	5579240	You gotta do it now, dude.
5581240	5585240	Don't worry, a lighter isn't hot enough to touch off that shield anyways.
5585240	5587240	It's not?
5587240	5589240	Nope.
5593240	5595240	Oh.
5597240	5600240	Well, TV show. You don't need to do that.
5600240	5601240	Oh, okay, thank you.
5601240	5603240	Oh, that's a bit fucking weird.
5603240	5605240	Yeah, thanks.
5609240	5612240	Somebody's masturbating right now, I swear to God.
5612240	5614240	Somebody somewhere.
5616240	5618240	That's a bit gross.
5618240	5622240	Also, that's not how a hand-degrainer's cook off either, but never mind, details, details.
5622240	5624240	But yeah, a lot of that scene was the same.
5624240	5627240	Like, her revealing that she had been bit, the whole thing.
5627240	5629240	No, definitely.
5629240	5633240	The whole sacrifice and the weir of kissing.
5633240	5637240	The end was different, but most of the scene was the same.
5648240	5663240	Wow, so there we go.
5663240	5666240	Episodes one and two down the hatch.
5666240	5669240	I'm stunned at how good it was.
5669240	5672240	I was expecting complete and total nonsense.
5672240	5674240	No, that was actually pretty good.
5674240	5677240	The changes that they made, well, some were a bit strange.
5677240	5681240	I think the kiss was probably requested by the actress.
5681240	5685240	She probably wanted to go out in a weird but memorable way.
5685240	5688240	Yeah, maybe not the kiss itself, but the actual...
5688240	5690240	Maybe, I don't know.
5690240	5693240	The actual sacrificing yourself to stop the zombie horde thing.
5693240	5702240	And again, I actually quite appreciate the fact that they're making the characters not psychotic murder hobos, as they were in the game.
5702240	5703240	Yes.
5703240	5705240	That's actually a good change.
5705240	5710240	I'm not that wowed by the show itself, like the whole pacing, etc.
5710240	5712240	It's kind of slow, it's kind of meh.
5712240	5716240	I'm frankly not that invested in this supposed child.
5716240	5724240	But the simple fact that it's not awful is already much...
5724240	5732240	See, for me, one, it's the fact that they actually are following the game as much as they are, which is a miracle in this day and age.
5732240	5740240	But as you say, for the show itself, Ellie's not nearly as interesting as she was in the game, but Joel is still pretty interesting.
5740240	5742240	Joel is about as interesting as he was.
5742240	5751240	It's going to be interesting to see how they go forward, because the thing that's going to make or break the show is the interaction between Joel and Ellie is the same way as it was in the video game.
5751240	5756240	Because it was their interactions that sold the game.
5756240	5760240	Yeah, the entire premise of the game was based on their relationship.
5760240	5764240	And if they don't do that right, then there is no Last of Us.
5764240	5769240	Still, I'm surprised. I mean, I expected to only be watching bad stuff on this channel, you know?
5769240	5773240	And here we are, watching at least an okay to decent show.
5773240	5777240	I'm okay with that. We don't always have to be hit watching Trainwreck.
5777240	5781240	I mean, we're not watching a shitty Velma show, at least.
5781240	5787240	Hold on. We should start Velma. We should change gears and switch over to Velma instead.
5787240	5792240	The show's been shitty enough, we must torture ourselves.
5792240	5799240	Naomi is like, Dev, do you want to watch Velma with me? And I'm like, listen, there's no good answer to this question.
5799240	5803240	Because either I'm watching Velma or you think I don't want to spend time with you.
5803240	5811240	Don't worry. Just the first episode. I think she'll change her mind.
5811240	5813240	Well, final thoughts then, everyone?
5813240	5820240	I think it's pretty good. I mean, they changed some stuff from the game, obviously, but nobody expected a one-to-one recreation.
5820240	5824240	But what they did recreate was actually fairly faithful.
5824240	5833240	They created the major sceneries, the major vistas, and the major plot points, for the most part.
5833240	5839240	Of course, with some changes, which just makes things a little bit more interesting.
5839240	5848240	I find it very interesting that they changed the dates to make it before without explicitly stating it.
5848240	5855240	Or saying it to your face, like, this is what we're doing, and this is 2013, guys.
5855240	5862240	Oh, this is what would happen if something happened 10 years ago. I don't know how much that would change.
5862240	5865240	Yeah, I'm not sure why they did that. I'm not sure why they did that.
5865240	5870240	In the original game, the past was set in 2013, because 2013 was the year the game came out.
5870240	5877240	And then the present was 2033. And now, the past is 2003, and the present is 2023, which is our current year.
5877240	5881240	So I guess they wanted to make it relatable somehow, either way.
5881240	5884240	But I'm not sure why they made that change.
5884240	5887240	It doesn't really change that much.
5887240	5892240	It was fairly faithful to the video game. There are some weird, unnecessary changes.
5892240	5898240	Like, if they just didn't do the fungal retcon thing, I think the show would be a little better,
5898240	5901240	because it would be more faithful to the original source material.
5901240	5907240	I think Arch is correct. I think that the whole reason for the change was down to the actor not wanting to have his face covered up.
5907240	5914240	But again, I still have to beg the question, like, the gas masks that Joel wear, you could just use a different one where you can see their face.
5915240	5917240	It's not that big of a deal.
5917240	5922240	I also don't think Joel wears the gas masks throughout the entire game anyways.
5922240	5924240	Only parts of it. In parts of it, yeah.
5924240	5927240	But it's only, it's very small sections in the game.
5927240	5932240	He does when, like, their room is, like, fumigated with the spores.
5932240	5933240	Yeah, yeah.
5933240	5938240	He does a couple points in the game, and that's, honestly, I think that's the thing that bugs me the most,
5938240	5942240	is because, like, it's such a little thing, it's like, you know, he could have just worn the mask,
5942240	5947240	and those sections were short, and in this show, they skip most of those combat sequences anyways,
5947240	5952240	and so those gas mask, quote-unquote, sections would have been incredibly short.
5953240	5954240	Yeah.
5954240	5965240	Oh, yeah. In, like, the game itself, there was even a section where they find, like, a smuggler with his mask broken,
5965240	5969240	and you have to either put him out of his misery or leave him to suffer.
5969240	5971240	Yep, that was a cool moral laundry.
5971240	5972240	Yeah.
5972240	5975240	Oh, you're right, Lilith, I completely forgot about that sequence.
5975240	5977240	That wasn't even in the game. Or in the show.
5977240	5978240	Yeah, in the show, yeah.
5978240	5984240	That was, I think, like, the reason why they didn't do it in a show is because, like,
5984240	5990240	oh, then the audience is gonna question why aren't they wearing masks or in sections where they should be.
5990240	5996240	It might have to do with the fact that masks right now are also a delicate social thing, because...
5996240	5998240	I don't think that's it.
5998240	5999240	No?
5999240	6001240	I can actually enlarge the argument for this.
6001240	6004240	These aren't little masks. These are, like, gas masks.
6004240	6006240	Yeah, yeah, yeah, but masks are masked.
6006240	6009240	I don't think that was the reason at all.
6009240	6011240	Well, let's see Arch's logic, though. Let's see Arch's logic.
6011240	6019240	The show so far has been studiously inoffensive to our point of view.
6019240	6024240	In fact, it's been studiously inoffensive to any point of view. It's simply been a retelling.
6024240	6025240	Yep.
6025240	6030240	That makes me think, they seem to be going out of their way to do this,
6030240	6035240	and if the objective is to create good television that people want to watch,
6035240	6039240	that avoids all of the current eardrama, et cetera,
6039240	6045240	they probably would want to avoid the mask thing too, just even the inference or suggestion of it,
6045240	6047240	because that was a big deal.
6047240	6051240	I feel like leaving it out raises more questions.
6051240	6053240	Exactly, though, but that's the thing.
6053240	6056240	Leaving it out raises more questions for the law.
6056240	6061240	The only reason to remove it is either, a, Pedro Pascal and his ego is a word like,
6061240	6065240	well, I have to wear a mask for, like, five minutes in two hours of TV show,
6065240	6070240	which, I can see it, but I'm also like, that's weird.
6070240	6074240	Removing the masks is still a bad thing.
6074240	6077240	Because they had to work in two scenes,
6077240	6080240	one mask of exposition dump at the beginning that was completely unnecessary,
6080240	6086240	and then an entire flashback sequence to characters that don't matter in Jakarta,
6086240	6089240	to just simply explain the whole fungal thing again.
6089240	6093240	And these scenes were disjointed, they weren't necessary,
6093240	6096240	and they were there to try to justify the reason for its existence.
6096240	6099240	And in the show, before the show went live,
6099240	6101240	the writers and the runners actually talked about,
6101240	6104240	oh, the audience, we're doing things this differently,
6104240	6107240	and it's going to be a big deal, it's going to be really cool.
6107240	6110240	And so far, the only payoff has been, there's little tendrils that come out of their mouth,
6110240	6115240	and there's like a really gross kiss scene that just was kind of like,
6115240	6118240	ooh, that's just gross. I mean, the zombies are supposed to be gross,
6118240	6123240	but that was just a completely different field of weird.
6123240	6128240	There's one final thing that I think we should touch on real briefly before we end off the night.
6128240	6133240	Usually, when we talk about a show on my channel or your channel or someone else,
6133240	6138240	Gundam or Critical Drinker or Mauler or whoever talks about shows in this way,
6138240	6145240	I've noticed that a core component of the conversation is the social media backlash,
6145240	6147240	because the show is bad, right?
6147240	6153240	With Kenobi, it was Riva, with Lord of the Rings, it was the Black Elf,
6153240	6155240	but it was really fucking everything, right?
6155240	6157240	There's a lot of that shit, and people say,
6157240	6160240	well, you just hate the show because you're racist,
6160240	6163240	and some people are just racist, and some people,
6163240	6167240	they're like, well, why did you have to race swap this character?
6167240	6172240	You saw a lot of posts like this, where people were complaining that Joel's daughter
6172240	6177240	was changed from a white blonde girl to a half-black girl with frizzy hair.
6177240	6180240	Complaint, if we're going to remove the racist aspect of it,
6180240	6182240	because I'm sure some of them were just racist,
6182240	6188240	but the actual substance of the complaint is that Joel is supposed to be reminded
6188240	6192240	of his daughter when he sees Ellie, so they're supposed to look somewhat similar,
6192240	6197240	and the two actresses they got in this show look nothing alike.
6197240	6201240	It is a pointless change. It does not improve the story in any way.
6201240	6209240	It only damages it, but she's only in the show for a little bit and then dies.
6209240	6210240	Yes.
6210240	6212240	It's not a big deal.
6212240	6215240	Meanwhile, Aaron Deere is shoved in your fucking face every five seconds,
6215240	6220240	and when the entire show is bad, it is easy to focus on the bad parts of it,
6220240	6224240	whereas here, again, he's a race swap daughter, she's there,
6224240	6227240	she goes through the motions, then she dies, and it's like, okay, that was it,
6227240	6230240	and every other character seems to be okay, so...
6230240	6234240	And you know what? She was still a competent actress.
6234240	6237240	She still did the job of playing the character very well.
6237240	6241240	So far I say she did a better job than Ellie.
6241240	6244240	Yeah, she actually did a pretty good job.
6244240	6253240	I think my only complaint was that by changing her race to mixed or black,
6253240	6258240	they played into the trope of the black character dies first.
6258240	6260240	Oh, yeah, that's right, eh? Damn.
6260240	6261240	That's true.
6261240	6266240	There's also the weird... Okay, so watermelon in the fucking freezer.
6266240	6270240	He steals 20 bucks to fix his watch.
6270240	6271240	Wow.
6271240	6275240	Yeah, in the original game, there was no watermelon in the fridge,
6275240	6281240	and she saved up her money to fix the watch, and that was the gift.
6281240	6282240	It's...
6282240	6284240	That was a strange show.
6284240	6286240	Weird choices.
6286240	6287240	Yeah.
6287240	6293240	Let's make the one character we race swapped into a watermelon-eating thief.
6293240	6295240	Hmm.
6295240	6296240	I mean...
6296240	6298240	That's a bit strange.
6299240	6303240	It's most likely that the set dressers didn't even notice it.
6303240	6307240	Your racist spider senses are not as advanced as mine.
6307240	6308240	Yeah.
6308240	6309240	Maybe.
6309240	6311240	And I think the set dressers would have noticed it,
6311240	6317240	because who puts a full quarter watermelon slice just in the fridge?
6317240	6319240	You know what the worst part is?
6319240	6321240	I went back to the watermelon slice picture.
6321240	6322240	Yeah?
6322240	6325240	It's got fucking freezer burns on it.
6325240	6328240	It's been in there for years as they wait to do the shot.
6328240	6334240	Somebody requisitioned that thing ages in advance and had to put it in there.
6334240	6336240	You know what they're doing?
6336240	6340240	There was leftover chicken in there that his brother ate, was eating out of.
6340240	6341240	He has wings, yeah.
6341240	6346240	So it's entirely possible that they were trying to make it look like it's cozy,
6346240	6350240	or not cozy, but a little bit slobby in terms of the stuff that's there.
6350240	6353240	Because isn't Joel, if I remember right, he doesn't have...
6353240	6356240	His wife isn't with him anymore, or is dead.
6356240	6357240	Ah, no.
6357240	6360240	His wife left him and left the kid behind.
6360240	6365240	And so he's kind of a single dad, and so it's giving that single dad vibe.
6365240	6370240	A little bit unclean, a little bit rugged.
6370240	6371240	Ah, yes.
6371240	6375240	Single dads and their fucking random ass watermelons.
6375240	6376240	Also, wait, wait.
6376240	6384240	In race-swapping Joel's daughter, he must have had sex with a black woman who then abandoned her child.
6384240	6386240	That makes that a whole lot worse.
6386240	6387240	Jesus!
6387240	6394240	Yeah, because in the original lore of the game, Joel's wife walked out on him a year into their relationship,
6394240	6395240	and she just kept the kid.
6395240	6401240	So if that's the same lore, then she just up and left.
6401240	6407240	This is a win. I don't know if they think it's the win they think it is, but it is there.
6407240	6411240	Last of Us, turns out, is actually just hyper-based and red-pilled.
6411240	6413240	Watches Nick Fuentes every weekend.
6413240	6415240	I will say this too, though.
6415240	6420240	One thing I also noticed is the fucking stunt people in this show fucking went for it.
6420240	6424240	Like the scene where she tries to ambush Joel.
6424240	6427240	Pablo fucking chucks that little bitch.
6427240	6430240	The wall bulges from the impact.
6430240	6436240	And also the zombies that are running and crashing into things and jumping over everything and just falling all over the place, yeah.
6436240	6440240	Oh yeah, the actors are putting their entire zombussy into it.
6440240	6441240	Zombussy?
6441240	6442240	I'm a pussy.
6442240	6444240	Yeah.
6444240	6448240	It was a surprisingly decent show, which is weird.
6448240	6450240	It exists and it isn't complete garbage.
6450240	6452240	Yeah, I'm stunned.
6452240	6455240	Are we going to keep watching it every week, I guess?
6455240	6458240	Well, not that it's good. Is there any point?
6459240	6460240	Yeah, I was thinking that too.
6460240	6462240	We do gotta switch gears to Velma.
6462240	6465240	Well, for fuck's sake, you guys have problems.
6469240	6472240	Before it begins, goddammit, Kibbs, fix your mic.
6472240	6474240	Fix what?
6474240	6477240	Your mic keeps going off, like randomly.
6477240	6479240	You can just hear background noises all the time.
6479240	6480240	Really?
6480240	6482240	Yeah.
6482240	6484240	Wow, boomer.
6484240	6486240	I'm just gay with that shit.
6486240	6489240	You're pulling a Sargon right now.
6489240	6491240	Oh Jesus, that's fucking bad.
6491240	6494240	No, that's my feelings.
6494240	6500240	True, fungi cannot survive if its host's internal temperature is over 94 degrees.
6500240	6502240	And apparently there are no reasons for...
6502240	6505240	Kibbs, your mic is going crazy again. What happened?
6505240	6506240	I...
6506240	6513240	Oh God, for some reason I was like, why is there like a mammogram going off in the background?
6513240	6514240	Yeah.
6515240	6518240	And now he's quiet.
6518240	6521240	You're actually very quiet now, Jesus.
6521240	6523240	Really? How quiet? How do I do this?
6523240	6527240	I've cranked you up to 135 and I can barely hear you.
6533240	6535240	Climate change caused it.
6535240	6538240	Climate change has caused everything.
6539240	6543240	Kibbs, any one of them could become capable of borrowing into our brains and taking control...
6543240	6545240	Wait, Kibbs, are you still there?
6548240	6550240	Oh my God, dude.
6550240	6553240	What the fuck's going on with you today? Because I can barely hear you.
6557240	6559240	Is it just me?
6559240	6561240	No, he's just boomer.
6563240	6567240	It sounds like your volume is at 10%, man.
6568240	6570240	I haven't changed anything.
6572240	6575240	Maybe my stuff is starting to break, I don't know.
6575240	6583240	Go into your sound panel outside of Discord, like your Windows sound panel, and see what your mic levels are at.
6583240	6586240	I mean, it should be fine.
6586240	6588240	Crank that shit up, Kibbs.
6588240	6590240	Even louder.
6590240	6592240	How about now? Is that any better?
6592240	6594240	Jesus, what the fuck happened?
6594240	6596240	What, is it too loud now? I'll turn it down.
6596240	6599240	Not only is it too loud, all the background noise is back.
6599240	6601240	Is that any better? Is the background noise gone?
6601240	6607240	I set you to 200 and I can hear you now, but there's like a loud hum in the background whenever you talk.
6607240	6610240	No, it's not that loud. It's only kinda loud.
6613240	6615240	What's going on?
6615240	6617240	I can't hear it now.
6617240	6621240	That sounds like it might be an improperly seated audio cable, so try like...
6621240	6624240	Do you use XLR connections for your mics?
6626240	6630240	I can't even understand you at this point. It's all just humming.
6630240	6638240	What you should do is unplug your XLR connectors, give them a little dust off, and plug them back in.
6643240	6645240	Are you back?
6645240	6647240	Should be.
6647240	6649240	It sounds the exact same.
6649240	6659240	Wiggle the cord at the end of the connector and talk at the same time. Try doing that for each end.
6659240	6661240	Yeah, anything here?
6661240	6663240	Nope.
6663240	6665240	How about here?
6665240	6671240	That's it. That's the broken one. You probably have a break in your XLR cable.
6671240	6673240	Okay, well...
6675240	6677240	Get a replacement.
6678240	6684240	Okay, so chat. Did you tell your chat the story of what happened today? Of your failure, Kibs?
6684240	6687240	How you were an hour late and then your cable didn't work?
6687240	6691240	I told them in Galactic Sibs stream, I was like, so I showed up, I was like, hey Dev, how you doing?
6691240	6696240	Dev's like, I'm a homosexual. Okay, you know, that's cool for you. I'm not judging.
6696240	6701240	Tell them how that went down, and then my mic stopped working because Dev was being fat and very loud.
6701240	6703240	That's how it happened, eh?
6704240	6707240	It caused me to fall on my microphone and bump the cable.
6707240	6713240	Firstly, I've had XLR cables fail in that exact way before, so I recognized the sound as soon as I heard it.
6713240	6716240	I was like, Kibs, your XLR is fucked up.
6716240	6720240	I'm actually glad you noticed because I was trying to figure out what the fuck was wrong with it.
6720240	6722240	Was that the first time it had been happening?
6722240	6725240	This is the first time I've ever had to replace my XLR cable.
6725240	6730240	Okay. Has it been making that noise since before this morning?
6730240	6732240	For about a year.
6733240	6735240	Are you fucking serious?
6735240	6738240	I know, but it was so, like, anytime I'd unplug it and plug it back in, it was like, fixed.
6738240	6742240	I was like, huh, that's weird. Like, it would just seemingly fix itself.
6742240	6745240	It's gotten progressively worse in the last month.
6745240	6748240	You could have just wiggled it, we could have done the recording.
6749240	6751240	It's unstable.
6752240	6754240	Like, it's occasionally fasted anyways.
6754240	6757240	It's not that unstable, you've been streaming all day.
6757240	6761240	Yeah, but I also have the music of the game turned up, so it covers it up when it does act up.
6761240	6762240	Oh.
6763240	6764240	Yeah.
6765240	6766240	Basically.
