WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:09.760
So, we're back again to do another watch party. The first time was a moderate success when

00:09.760 --> 00:15.860
we did Lord of the Rings, The Rings of Power. Not the show, mind you. Just our having fun

00:15.860 --> 00:21.800
with it. We don't even have a name for this series, do we? I just called it Devin Friends

00:21.800 --> 00:24.000
Watch Lord of the Rings last time.

00:24.000 --> 00:30.760
Well, now it's Devin Friends. It's called Devin Friends Watch. There you go. Devin Friends

00:30.760 --> 00:36.480
Watch. I guess so. I guess so. And then insert title. Yeah. We've got Arch, Lilith, and Kibs

00:36.480 --> 00:46.360
here once again. Hello everyone. We're back. We're back. Communism spreads. Communism spreads.

00:46.360 --> 00:52.080
We've come back to watch another one and this time it is The Last of Us TV show on HBO.

00:52.080 --> 00:58.600
I will say we tried to do this once before, but Kibs. Kibs, what did you do? What do you

00:58.600 --> 01:04.240
mean what I do? Well, something killed the last watch party. What was it, Kibs? It wasn't

01:04.240 --> 01:11.180
me. You sneak. I don't know what you're talking about. You sneaker. So, the reason that we're

01:11.180 --> 01:18.120
doing episodes one and two in one go, and also the reason that we are a week late on

01:18.120 --> 01:24.960
episode one. It's Dev's fault. Oh, is it my fault? Yeah. Dev could have told me that

01:24.960 --> 01:30.400
the microphone, my XLR cable was busted, but it took too long. So, we had to wait a whole

01:30.400 --> 01:38.700
week. Can you believe that? We'll let this one slide, Dev, but next time. Alright, Kibs.

01:38.700 --> 01:43.520
Just for that, in post, I'm going to make your avatar a brony again. There's no need

01:43.520 --> 01:52.440
to be mean. So, we are, in fact, going to do episodes one and two in one big, long three

01:52.440 --> 01:59.440
and a half hour session. This is going to be real fun. I'm sure, I'm sure, actually.

01:59.440 --> 02:07.360
You lying sack of shit. So, Arch and Kibs, I was on the Arch cast with you guys, and

02:07.360 --> 02:11.240
we talked a whole bunch about The Last of Us, because Arch, you have no idea what this

02:11.240 --> 02:15.660
show is or what the game is, right? So, we had to fill you in. We talked about the game?

02:15.660 --> 02:20.680
We did, as well. Remember, it's your own show! Where are you? So, Arch, The Last of Us is

02:20.680 --> 02:29.360
a console game. Okay. It is, it's trash. I mean, it is trash, yes. And you know what,

02:29.360 --> 02:34.400
here, because Arch, you never played it, right? Of course not. And you don't know the, you

02:34.400 --> 02:39.080
don't know the, the interest, like the cultural interest surrounding it, right? It's the end

02:39.080 --> 02:45.480
of the PS3 360 Wii console era. The PS3 was a powerhouse for the time. Sony wanted a game

02:45.480 --> 02:52.240
that could truly show off its power. And that game ended up being The Last of Us. This is

02:52.240 --> 02:58.020
at the height of certain trends in gaming. One was the idea of the cinematic experience

02:58.020 --> 03:02.880
game. So, there's lots of, there's lots of cutscenes. There's lots of moments where your

03:02.880 --> 03:07.560
character just walks slowly through an environment and talks to another character. You see a

03:07.560 --> 03:13.800
lot of that in like, God of War nowadays. And like, Tomb Raider does that as well. But

03:13.800 --> 03:19.440
this was, this was kind of the peak of that type of gaming. It's less popular than it

03:19.440 --> 03:23.680
was, but you still kind of see it sometimes. So even though the game had a lot of decent

03:23.680 --> 03:30.800
combat and decent exploration, decent crafting, decent stealth, the game was clearly focused

03:30.800 --> 03:38.720
on a cinematic experience. Second, is that in this period of making video games, and

03:38.720 --> 03:47.120
just in general pop culture, there was a common storytelling motif of an older heroic man

03:47.120 --> 03:53.740
who teams up with an adoptive daughter figure. And generally the idea is that the older man

03:53.740 --> 03:58.760
didn't really have a chance to be a father. And he kind of regrets certain parts of his

03:58.760 --> 04:03.780
past. He's older, he's not really in the game anymore. And the adoptive daughter is

04:03.780 --> 04:09.880
somebody who never knew what life was like before the apocalypse, because this is always

04:09.880 --> 04:15.160
an apocalyptic story. So, older man deals with the fact that the world's gone to shit.

04:15.160 --> 04:20.200
Adoptive daughter doesn't even know what he's talking about. And they come to have a bond.

04:20.200 --> 04:26.120
And if you'll see that in Telltale's Walking Dead with Lee and Clem, you see that in Logan

04:26.120 --> 04:31.920
with Wolverine and whatever that girl's name was in that movie. But basically, this is

04:31.920 --> 04:38.820
a very, very popular storytelling motif back in this period. And probably the best example

04:38.820 --> 04:46.920
of it in gaming was The Last of Us, the relationship between Joel and Ellie. And this game was

04:46.920 --> 04:54.840
basically marketed as the PS3's final triumph. The PS3 was an amazingly popular console.

04:54.840 --> 05:01.520
The PS4 looked to also be similarly amazing. People loved Naughty Dog the developer. And

05:01.520 --> 05:05.560
they were basically hitting all the right notes. All the things that were popular in

05:05.560 --> 05:09.820
what was it 2012 or whatever it was in this game came out. All the things that were popular

05:09.820 --> 05:15.320
this game was doing. So it's less that the game was a high quality game, though it's

05:15.320 --> 05:21.220
like reasonably high quality. It's more that everything that was popular was in this game

05:21.220 --> 05:28.340
all at once at the peak of its popularity. And that turned it into basically a mini cultural

05:28.340 --> 05:31.500
phenomenon within gaming.

05:31.500 --> 05:37.060
Sort of. It was a pretty big deal, but it wasn't like on the power of what you had with

05:37.060 --> 05:44.380
Halo 3. Because that was like everywhere. That was like the Zenith, that was 2007, where

05:44.380 --> 05:49.060
you had gaming where there was like, oh, Mountain Dew can, so you go to fucking Boyger King

05:49.060 --> 05:53.580
and they had stuff. It was it was it was the height of PlayStation's sphere, is what

05:53.580 --> 05:54.580
I would say.

05:54.580 --> 06:00.940
The Archcast clip can fill that in. But Lilith, what is what is your relationship regarding

06:00.940 --> 06:02.100
The Last of Us?

06:02.100 --> 06:08.060
I know about the basic gist and the plot. I've always meant to play it, but like I just

06:08.060 --> 06:15.540
never got around to it. It's just in my backlog, but it's one of those games that's good things

06:15.540 --> 06:22.140
about it. But then I decided that they wanted to do like a remake of the first game that's

06:22.140 --> 06:29.260
pretty much completely the same. Which, you know what? Feel free. Print money. Why not?

06:29.260 --> 06:33.780
I have watched like the gameplay from start to finish, though, so I do know the story

06:33.780 --> 06:39.500
for the first game. I pretty much skipped out on the second one for the most part, aside

06:39.500 --> 06:41.920
from just knowing the story.

06:41.920 --> 06:46.280
You just real good where the transvestite beats everybody to death at the golf club.

06:46.280 --> 06:52.600
Here's the thing. Everyone said that that Abby was trans, but she's not trans. She's

06:52.600 --> 06:59.060
a very muscular woman. Everyone is already like hyper aware of just shoehorned representation.

06:59.060 --> 07:05.420
And also, Abby is very easy to vilify based on her actions within the context of the story.

07:05.420 --> 07:09.920
She's not a well liked character. So I think I think people just like did one plus two

07:09.920 --> 07:13.340
and said, this person's trans. And it's like, well, no, she's actually not trans. Here's

07:13.340 --> 07:17.080
the thing. When it comes to these sort of shows, right, they almost always seem to end

07:17.080 --> 07:21.400
up like trash, these new adaptations, because it happened with Lord of the Rings and it

07:21.400 --> 07:26.880
happened with She-Hulk and it happened with the Halo show and it happened with Velma recently.

07:26.880 --> 07:32.440
Like how many of these shows come out and are just like garbage piles? And I think people

07:32.440 --> 07:36.320
are assuming that it's going to be the same thing with this one. I'm expecting this to

07:36.320 --> 07:39.200
be trash. I don't know about you guys.

07:39.200 --> 07:45.340
Historically, video games and adaptations hasn't been done too well. But, um, lately

07:45.340 --> 07:50.600
seems to people have been breaking the trend. Like Arcane, for example, that was like a

07:50.600 --> 07:57.840
really good adaptation from a video game to a show. And I think, what else? There was

07:57.840 --> 08:00.860
a few, right? Good video game adaptations.

08:00.860 --> 08:04.980
The Super Mario Brothers Movie from 1993.

08:04.980 --> 08:09.300
The best video game adaptations are the ones that have nothing to do with the video game.

08:09.300 --> 08:15.220
Arcane had nothing to do with League of Legends. Cyberpunk had nothing to do with Cyberpunk.

08:15.220 --> 08:16.620
Alright, Cyberpunk.

08:16.620 --> 08:21.980
Oh yeah, the little robot loli that Dimitri likes so much.

08:21.980 --> 08:28.180
But I wouldn't actually discount this one because a key hallmark for a lot of the really

08:28.180 --> 08:34.720
shit adaptations is a really shit cast, because it is usually made as some kind of hobby

08:34.760 --> 08:40.840
product by know-nothing retards like the Winx of Power did, where there's just a large roster

08:40.840 --> 08:45.180
of people you've never heard of and you have no interest in and that can't act to save

08:45.180 --> 08:52.600
their lives. But here, I mean, Pedro Pascal, or Pablo, I'm going to call him frequently.

08:52.600 --> 08:53.600
You fucking racist.

08:53.600 --> 09:00.240
Very solid. No, it's because Pablo Schreiber from the Halo TV series, and now he's the

09:00.240 --> 09:07.640
guy Pablo. I know now. Gabriel Luna as well. This series actually has some actors who might

09:07.640 --> 09:08.640
be able to act.

09:08.640 --> 09:14.360
Well, it's already an issue because they've already dismissed like the spores and a bunch

09:14.360 --> 09:15.360
of other things.

09:15.360 --> 09:19.440
So Arch, the lore of the spores, okay? So there's some, in real life, this is a real

09:19.440 --> 09:22.680
life thing, not a Last of Us thing. There's some sort of a fungus that takes over the

09:22.680 --> 09:29.980
brain of an ant. And what it does is it makes the ant crawl onto the end of a grass blade

09:29.980 --> 09:37.100
so that it can be picked up by a bird. And then the bird eats the ant, and then it gets

09:37.100 --> 09:41.420
shit out. And then that's how the spores of this life form spread across the environment.

09:41.420 --> 09:44.300
It's based on a real, that's a real play, a real...

09:44.300 --> 09:50.220
Yeah, that is a real fungus, yes. And so Amy Hennig, when she was kind of like penning

09:50.220 --> 09:56.480
out the initial ideas of the Last of Us, she's like, well, what if we did a zombie story,

09:56.480 --> 10:03.560
but we did our own twist on it where it was transmitted through fungal spores. And so

10:03.560 --> 10:09.120
you go into these dens of zombies where people are growing into the walls and you're wearing

10:09.120 --> 10:14.300
a gas mask and you have to hold your breath if you ever take the mask off, right? Because

10:14.300 --> 10:19.120
the air is infected with these spores. And the spores are the primary way that the zombie

10:19.120 --> 10:24.160
virus gets around. And basically what happens is the person gets infected by breathing in

10:24.160 --> 10:28.520
the spore and then they have like a zombie stage and then they have a very aggressive

10:28.520 --> 10:32.680
zombie stage called clickers where they have, where they can't, like their, their eyes have

10:32.680 --> 10:37.000
been all grown out and they can't see anymore, but they can echo location. So you have to

10:37.000 --> 10:41.280
like stealth through it. And then once in the final stages, they just turn into like

10:41.280 --> 10:43.840
a giant mushroom and they just grow into the wall.

10:43.840 --> 10:46.520
Yep, and then it's the spores. And then somebody's...

10:47.520 --> 10:55.080
Yeah, yeah. So it was basically a different spin on the zombie story, but the fact that

10:55.080 --> 11:00.440
it was fungal spores was a core component of the lore. And so to see spores will not

11:00.440 --> 11:04.600
exist in The Last of Us HBO, that literally just makes it a normal zombie story.

11:04.600 --> 11:10.720
Yep. They've, they've taken, they've demystified the zombies because like any good zombie setting

11:10.720 --> 11:15.400
like Dead Space or like The Last of Us, when it comes to the fungal spores, what that does

11:15.400 --> 11:19.920
is it helps drive it apart than your just basic bitches, green zambi, you know, it bites

11:19.920 --> 11:24.000
your brains or whatever. Like that's boring. That's old. You got to do something new and

11:24.000 --> 11:25.400
fresh with your zombies.

11:25.400 --> 11:30.640
I don't know if I'd really consider that all that new and fucking fresh, but if you say

11:30.640 --> 11:31.640
so.

11:31.640 --> 11:37.240
What, you don't like stinky mushrooms, you little shit?

11:37.240 --> 11:41.460
In terms of gameplay, it wasn't that different aside from like the, the, the, the breath

11:41.460 --> 11:45.620
mechanic in some of the levels, but in terms of the lore, it did make it feel fresh for

11:45.620 --> 11:47.420
2012 or whatever it was.

11:47.420 --> 11:48.420
Yep.

11:48.420 --> 11:49.420
Remember in 2012.

11:49.420 --> 11:52.940
Very specific spores. I guess they're not absorbed through the eyes.

11:52.940 --> 11:56.340
They had to keep it fresh because by 2012, that was the end.

11:56.340 --> 11:57.340
They wear masks, yeah.

11:57.340 --> 12:01.660
Yep. But 2012 was also the end of the zombie craze because Left 4 Dead 2 and all the zombie

12:01.660 --> 12:04.320
games started to fall out of circulation.

12:04.320 --> 12:09.660
And Walking Dead kind of had its major impact back then. I mean, in World of Warcraft, like

12:09.660 --> 12:11.080
Wrath of the Lich King was wrapping up.

12:11.080 --> 12:15.300
So the zombie thing had come and gone, and this was like the tail end of it.

12:15.300 --> 12:17.420
And so they said, we have to make, if we're going to do a zombie story, you have to do

12:17.420 --> 12:18.420
something different.

12:18.420 --> 12:21.060
So they did, they did spores rather than like a virus.

12:21.060 --> 12:24.900
Yeah, but dismissing console, console stuff is fine.

12:24.900 --> 12:27.940
Well, the thing is you have to respect the fandom, Arch.

12:27.940 --> 12:29.940
I know, they're consoles.

12:29.940 --> 12:33.500
You're about as, you're about as brilliant as they are when it comes to that, if that's

12:33.500 --> 12:34.500
your perspective.

12:34.500 --> 12:37.980
Oh my God, this is Archer's SJW, Arch.

12:37.980 --> 12:38.980
He's rejecting the fandom.

12:38.980 --> 12:43.140
He's like, no, it's my fandom now.

12:43.140 --> 12:44.740
It's not, I reject it.

12:44.740 --> 12:47.420
It's a console fandom.

12:47.420 --> 12:50.800
Whatever damage done to it was probably for the better.

12:50.800 --> 12:57.020
There is one hallmark that I think hasn't been seen too much yet.

12:57.020 --> 13:03.460
So if you recall, when it came to, um, when it came to the Obi Wan Kenobi show, everyone

13:03.460 --> 13:08.840
was, even before the show came out, everyone was talking about all the racist hatred that

13:08.840 --> 13:11.380
the actress of Riva was getting, right?

13:11.380 --> 13:14.540
When it came to the Lord of the Rings show, everyone was talking about the black elf and

13:14.540 --> 13:16.340
his actor and all the racist hatred.

13:16.340 --> 13:21.940
Like I haven't seen much of that this time where there's been this performative wokeness

13:21.940 --> 13:26.220
in the media before this show launches to try to get it off the ground.

13:26.220 --> 13:29.460
Now maybe I just haven't seen the articles yet, but as far as I can tell, that seems

13:29.460 --> 13:32.220
to be absent, which is a good sign.

13:32.220 --> 13:37.660
They also haven't pulled off operation hide behind the black man, uh, to the same degree

13:37.660 --> 13:38.660
in this show.

13:38.660 --> 13:45.500
I mean, if, if Pedro Pascal shows up in episode one now wearing blackface, I'll retract that

13:45.500 --> 13:50.580
statement, but hide behind the Mexican just doesn't have quite the same effect.

13:50.580 --> 13:52.940
Well in this case, they wouldn't be hiding behind the Mexican.

13:52.940 --> 13:56.020
They'd have to hide behind his daughter because I think they race swapped her.

13:56.020 --> 13:57.260
Yeah, we'll have to see though.

13:57.260 --> 13:58.260
We'll have to see.

13:58.260 --> 14:00.780
So hide behind the child.

14:00.780 --> 14:04.620
Because the daughter, the little woman, oh, okay.

14:04.620 --> 14:06.980
Well you can't hide behind the corpse then.

14:06.980 --> 14:07.980
You dumbass.

14:07.980 --> 14:08.980
It's 10 years old.

14:08.980 --> 14:09.980
Okay.

14:09.980 --> 14:10.980
Pulls up the little corpse.

14:10.980 --> 14:11.980
It flops in the wind.

14:11.980 --> 14:12.980
I can't.

14:12.980 --> 14:13.980
Don't attack us.

14:13.980 --> 14:19.300
Like if this child ends up being on screen for like 10 minutes, that was, you just can't

14:19.300 --> 14:20.300
slap him now.

14:20.300 --> 14:22.660
Yeah, probably going to be less than 10 minutes.

14:22.660 --> 14:23.660
She should die pretty quickly.

14:23.660 --> 14:26.460
You can't hide behind the side character, Jesus.

14:26.460 --> 14:27.960
It would be funny if they tried.

14:27.960 --> 14:36.000
So I guess it's time for us to watch the premiere of The Last of Us, another watch party series

14:36.000 --> 14:37.000
begins.

14:37.000 --> 14:38.000
It's going to be awesome.

14:38.000 --> 14:39.000
All right.

14:39.000 --> 14:40.000
Let's rock and roll.

14:40.000 --> 14:44.280
Let's prep up good old VLC because there's no way in hell I'm paying for HBO.

14:44.280 --> 15:01.800
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah.

15:01.800 --> 15:02.800
I'm a baller.

15:02.800 --> 15:03.800
Yes.

15:03.800 --> 15:07.600
And we end up with a global pandemic pan, meaning all the whole world becomes sickle

15:07.600 --> 15:09.600
at once.

15:10.600 --> 15:13.600
We call it COVID.

15:13.600 --> 15:15.600
No, no, no.

15:15.600 --> 15:16.600
All right.

15:16.600 --> 15:17.600
Well, that's our show.

15:17.600 --> 15:19.680
Hey, that's that dude from the other television show.

15:19.680 --> 15:20.680
That's kind of famous.

15:20.680 --> 15:25.800
I don't like that guy because he used to own slaves, but in the end, what, what would you

15:25.800 --> 15:31.360
just to be clear, you, you do think microorganisms, different show, don't you recognize him?

15:31.360 --> 15:32.360
Kind of bacteria?

15:32.360 --> 15:33.360
No.

15:33.360 --> 15:34.360
You like saying no.

15:34.360 --> 15:35.360
Yes.

15:35.360 --> 15:38.040
He's funny.

15:38.480 --> 15:44.800
It's dominance from Spartacus because there are some fungi who seek not to kill, but to

15:44.800 --> 15:45.800
control.

15:45.800 --> 15:46.800
Let me ask you.

15:46.800 --> 15:47.800
Oh God.

15:47.800 --> 15:48.800
They're actually going to explain that part.

15:48.800 --> 15:54.440
You get it from, I thought that was supposed to be implied fungus psilocybin also fungus.

15:54.440 --> 15:55.440
This is all new to the show.

15:55.440 --> 16:01.080
This isn't wasn't in the game at all because I thought this was supposed to be a little

16:01.080 --> 16:05.900
bit of the secret that it did that whole, you know, brain control, zombie fungus thing.

16:05.900 --> 16:08.660
This is more of a show, don't tell policy.

16:08.660 --> 16:11.420
This is just exposition, which is not good storytelling.

16:11.420 --> 16:17.340
This is, Hey, you don't know anything about this console communist universe of fungus

16:17.340 --> 16:24.660
and by the way, global warming, Cordyceps, Astragalus, anyone in the game already did

16:24.660 --> 16:33.020
the mystery angles and taking control of millions of yeah, I've seen like similar approach to

16:33.020 --> 16:35.660
like the new triathlon series.

16:35.660 --> 16:43.980
So if that happens, we lose.

16:43.980 --> 16:45.700
And that's why you should wear your masks.

16:45.700 --> 16:47.820
Oh, it's not entirely true.

16:47.820 --> 16:50.780
I was like, there are treatments for fungal infections.

16:50.780 --> 16:54.220
It's not literally impossible, but details, details.

16:54.220 --> 16:55.220
That's not convenient.

16:55.220 --> 16:56.220
It doesn't sound scary.

16:56.220 --> 16:59.980
Arch, you know, I don't like, is it game of Thrones again?

16:59.980 --> 17:00.980
It is.

17:00.980 --> 17:06.820
Oh God, I wish people would stop making this fucking intro.

17:06.820 --> 17:14.940
This is creatively bankrupt, but yeah, you know, I'll give it one point, one point because

17:14.940 --> 17:22.940
I really enjoy the fact that they're using the original song for my diverse craft of

17:22.940 --> 17:28.140
creators who never played the video games if they want to go into the fungal and how

17:28.140 --> 17:31.620
big of a threat it is airborne.

17:31.620 --> 17:36.020
You can see the particles in the air like that is the bits of the fungus.

17:36.020 --> 17:37.020
That's not good.

17:37.020 --> 17:39.700
Oh, look, the fungus turned into the two main characters.

17:39.700 --> 17:41.020
Wasn't that clever?

17:41.020 --> 17:48.100
No, not really, but I mean, it was a shot.

17:48.100 --> 17:49.500
It's like baby's first intro.

17:49.500 --> 17:51.540
It's like, Ooh, it's deep and symbolic.

17:51.540 --> 17:52.540
It's like, no.

17:52.540 --> 17:53.540
That was three.

17:53.540 --> 17:55.860
Oh, that was a good year.

17:55.860 --> 17:56.860
Yeah.

17:56.860 --> 17:59.180
Before the bad things started to happen.

17:59.180 --> 18:02.060
You think it's good here because the Iraq invasion, don't you?

18:02.060 --> 18:03.060
Yep.

18:03.060 --> 18:05.940
Iraq invasion and Pokemon Ruby and Sapphire, baby.

18:05.940 --> 18:08.900
Hell yeah, brother.

18:08.900 --> 18:09.900
Everyone was concerned.

18:09.900 --> 18:12.300
Like, Oh my God, it's going to be a big war.

18:12.300 --> 18:14.420
He's going to deploy that chemical weapons.

18:14.420 --> 18:18.900
He didn't have any, but they black washed his daughter.

18:18.900 --> 18:19.900
Yeah.

18:19.900 --> 18:20.960
Did I?

18:20.960 --> 18:22.980
His daughter was like a blonde girl.

18:22.980 --> 18:25.740
Well, now she's a black girl.

18:25.740 --> 18:27.780
I guess, I guess the dad liked racism.

18:27.780 --> 18:28.780
Okay.

18:28.780 --> 18:29.780
Right.

18:29.780 --> 18:32.780
I know this is going to hit somebody here personal, but anyone who makes eggs like these

18:32.780 --> 18:35.580
need to be taken outside and put out of their fucking misery.

18:35.580 --> 18:36.580
Hold on.

18:36.580 --> 18:39.820
Didn't Lilith just make eggs like those before the show started?

18:39.820 --> 18:40.820
Exactly.

18:40.820 --> 18:41.820
What's that?

18:41.820 --> 18:45.820
I lit it with a cold fire.

18:45.820 --> 18:46.820
Yeah man.

18:46.820 --> 18:48.740
I also, I like simple eggs too.

18:48.740 --> 18:49.740
They're just like easy.

18:49.740 --> 18:53.340
The black girl has a watermelon in her fridge.

18:53.340 --> 18:54.340
Oh my God.

18:54.340 --> 18:55.340
Oh my God.

18:55.940 --> 18:58.220
That's a lot of placement.

18:58.220 --> 19:00.500
Would you like some purple drink?

19:00.500 --> 19:01.500
It's orange.

19:01.500 --> 19:02.500
It's orange.

19:02.500 --> 19:09.900
Lilith, Lilith, let's hope that none of your more left-leaning friends see this or else

19:09.900 --> 19:10.900
you'll be instantly canceled.

19:10.900 --> 19:15.900
How does that get destroyed for being in the same presence?

19:15.900 --> 19:18.460
Oh God, I remember this song.

19:18.460 --> 19:22.440
This song was on the radio every single second of every single day, back in the good old

19:22.440 --> 19:23.440
days.

19:23.440 --> 19:24.440
He's dependent on me.

19:24.540 --> 19:25.540
It's not the same.

19:25.540 --> 19:27.540
The outbreak better happen at night or I'll be mad.

19:27.540 --> 19:29.540
I thought he was having pancakes.

19:29.540 --> 19:31.540
He thought he was having fucking pancakes.

19:31.540 --> 19:33.540
The concrete guy is going to be there?

19:33.540 --> 19:34.540
Let me stick that some Tabasco.

19:34.540 --> 19:35.540
He can't frame until we pull.

19:35.540 --> 19:37.540
I had to give the actor some credit though.

19:37.540 --> 19:39.540
He actually does look a bit like Joel.

19:39.540 --> 19:40.540
I'm not splitting his job.

19:40.540 --> 19:41.540
A little bit.

19:41.540 --> 19:42.540
Yeah.

19:42.540 --> 19:43.540
Okay.

19:43.540 --> 19:45.860
See, I kind of hate this introductionary scene.

19:45.860 --> 19:46.860
Not that it's bad.

19:46.860 --> 19:47.860
Like this is actually all right.

19:47.860 --> 19:50.100
They're having a decent little conversation et cetera, but the zombie apocalypse is about

19:50.100 --> 19:51.960
to hit in like five seconds, right?

19:51.960 --> 19:53.980
And so they're like, Hey, care about these characters.

19:54.520 --> 19:55.520
They're all going to fucking die.

19:55.520 --> 19:56.520
Why?

19:56.520 --> 19:59.520
Barge, you have to at least put in the effort of caring.

19:59.520 --> 20:01.520
Barge don't want to.

20:01.520 --> 20:02.520
Barge don't want to.

20:02.520 --> 20:05.520
The little black girl who eats watermelon is smart.

20:05.520 --> 20:08.520
Barge, calm down.

20:08.520 --> 20:12.520
Sometimes I have to create my own entertainment, okay?

20:12.520 --> 20:14.520
We can rip on it in time.

20:14.520 --> 20:16.520
Page to page.

20:16.520 --> 20:20.520
I mean, this is an intro that is similar to the one in the first game, but the one in

20:20.520 --> 20:22.520
the first game happened in the middle of the night.

20:23.060 --> 20:24.060
Very quick.

20:24.060 --> 20:29.060
Listen, we need to build value for these characters so that when this child is eaten to death,

20:29.060 --> 20:30.060
we feel bad.

20:30.060 --> 20:33.060
Gosh darn it, Barge.

20:33.060 --> 20:35.060
If she gets eaten to death, I'll be surprised.

20:35.060 --> 20:36.060
Good.

20:36.060 --> 20:37.060
Oh my God.

20:37.060 --> 20:38.060
Just because she's brown though.

20:38.060 --> 20:39.060
Come on.

20:39.060 --> 20:41.060
Just because she's black, she likes watermelon and stealing things.

20:41.060 --> 20:42.060
I know.

20:42.060 --> 20:43.060
It's weird.

20:43.060 --> 20:44.060
Show, stop.

20:44.060 --> 20:45.060
Please.

20:45.060 --> 20:46.060
Show, don't do this.

20:46.060 --> 20:49.060
Show's like, I'm going to be racist.

20:49.600 --> 20:52.600
I could come by after school, but just for like a little bit.

20:52.600 --> 20:53.600
Look, zombies.

20:53.600 --> 20:54.600
She'll take what you got.

20:54.600 --> 20:56.600
Dad, you love biscuits.

20:59.600 --> 21:00.600
Jesus Christ.

21:00.600 --> 21:01.600
You are fond of biscuits.

21:01.600 --> 21:02.600
I do.

21:02.600 --> 21:03.600
But I'm on Atkins.

21:03.600 --> 21:04.600
What now?

21:04.600 --> 21:05.600
It's, uh, you know what?

21:05.600 --> 21:08.600
We got to run, but Sarah will be by later.

21:08.600 --> 21:10.600
She'll stay as long as you want.

21:10.600 --> 21:12.600
Tell you all about Atkins.

21:12.600 --> 21:14.600
I'm going to stay alive for this.

21:14.600 --> 21:16.600
Dad, why are you making me stay with the white people?

21:17.140 --> 21:20.140
I don't like the white ones, daddy.

21:20.140 --> 21:23.140
They don't look like me.

21:23.140 --> 21:25.140
Operation Desert Storm.

21:25.140 --> 21:28.140
Oh my God, it's the best bush.

21:33.140 --> 21:35.140
You won't use any of this shit.

21:35.140 --> 21:37.140
You won't use any of this shit in later life.

21:37.140 --> 21:39.140
You're going to have a smartphone on you.

21:39.140 --> 21:41.140
You're not going to be calculating anything.

21:43.140 --> 21:45.140
God, so many teachers told me,

21:45.680 --> 21:47.680
you're not going to have a calculator on you all the time.

21:47.680 --> 21:49.680
It's like, yes, I fucking will.

21:49.680 --> 21:50.680
The phones.

21:50.680 --> 21:52.680
The invention of phones.

21:52.680 --> 21:54.680
Yeah, but what if a giant mushroom apocalypse comes deaf?

21:54.680 --> 21:56.680
Good point, Lilith.

21:56.680 --> 21:57.680
Yeah, deaf.

21:57.680 --> 21:58.680
Stupid deaf.

21:58.680 --> 21:59.680
Stupid.

21:59.680 --> 22:03.680
You know, if the mushroom apocalypse came in 2003,

22:03.680 --> 22:06.680
we'd be spared so much fucking bullshit.

22:06.680 --> 22:08.680
Oh, the world would be a better place.

22:08.680 --> 22:10.680
I don't know about that.

22:10.680 --> 22:12.680
Listen, you wouldn't have to deal with

22:12.680 --> 22:14.680
female space marines.

22:15.220 --> 22:17.220
I'd rather deal with female space marines

22:17.220 --> 22:19.220
than figure out where to get food from.

22:19.220 --> 22:21.220
At least female space marines are profitable.

22:21.220 --> 22:23.220
Very true.

22:25.220 --> 22:27.220
Music.

22:27.220 --> 22:29.220
That's it?

22:29.220 --> 22:31.220
Did you steal your dad's watch?

22:31.220 --> 22:33.220
She stole her dad's money to get her dad a present?

22:33.220 --> 22:34.220
God.

22:34.220 --> 22:36.220
Kyle, you were wrong.

22:36.220 --> 22:38.220
She's not just a thief because she's black.

22:38.220 --> 22:40.220
She's actually kind and caring.

22:40.220 --> 22:42.220
She's a kind thief.

22:42.220 --> 22:44.220
Kyle.

22:44.760 --> 22:46.760
You're allowed to interpret that.

22:46.760 --> 22:48.760
I've been cancelled.

22:48.760 --> 22:50.760
In the original game,

22:50.760 --> 22:52.760
didn't she buy a new watch for Joel?

22:52.760 --> 22:54.760
She did.

22:54.760 --> 22:56.760
I hate their language.

22:56.760 --> 22:58.760
I'm sorry.

22:58.760 --> 23:00.760
It doesn't make me racist.

23:00.760 --> 23:02.760
I just don't like any language

23:02.760 --> 23:04.760
that pronounces the...

23:04.760 --> 23:06.760
You should go home.

23:06.760 --> 23:08.760
I don't know, something's going on.

23:08.760 --> 23:10.760
I wonder what.

23:10.760 --> 23:12.760
Maybe it's fire or something.

23:12.800 --> 23:14.800
The outbreak's gonna happen at night, I assume.

23:14.800 --> 23:16.800
Because we're seeing a little bit more

23:16.800 --> 23:18.800
before the video game starts.

23:18.800 --> 23:21.800
Yeah, we're seeing what leads up to it.

23:21.800 --> 23:24.800
Why half those children in the background are eating?

23:24.800 --> 23:26.800
There was just a lot of police and stuff on the road today.

23:26.800 --> 23:28.800
Well, that's true every day, isn't it?

23:28.800 --> 23:30.800
That's American.

23:30.800 --> 23:32.800
It's a hellhole.

23:32.800 --> 23:35.800
Three nails plus one cross equals four given.

23:35.800 --> 23:37.800
Ha ha ha.

23:37.800 --> 23:39.800
Jesus.

23:39.800 --> 23:41.800
Chocolate chip?

23:41.840 --> 23:43.840
Alright, she needs to burn.

23:43.840 --> 23:45.840
Yep.

23:45.840 --> 23:47.840
She should get bit first for raisin cookies.

23:47.840 --> 23:49.840
Seriously, though.

23:49.840 --> 23:51.840
She better die.

23:51.840 --> 23:53.840
Just put the mushrooms into the cookie.

23:53.840 --> 23:55.840
Is the old lady gonna turn into a zombie?

23:55.840 --> 23:57.840
TV show, I get what you're doing,

23:57.840 --> 23:59.840
but this isn't really your story.

23:59.840 --> 24:01.840
Please just get to the zombies.

24:01.840 --> 24:03.840
It's a TV show.

24:03.840 --> 24:05.840
It's the establishing episode.

24:05.840 --> 24:07.840
Come on, Barge.

24:07.840 --> 24:09.840
I understand, but

24:09.880 --> 24:11.880
even I know what this story is.

24:11.880 --> 24:13.880
Oh god, that's before Blu-ray.

24:13.880 --> 24:15.880
They're all low definition.

24:21.880 --> 24:23.880
Look, she's turning.

24:23.880 --> 24:25.880
Ah, shit.

24:25.880 --> 24:27.880
She is.

24:27.880 --> 24:29.880
I like how this house

24:29.880 --> 24:31.880
is more like 1950s than

24:31.880 --> 24:33.880
2003.

24:33.880 --> 24:35.880
Oh, Jesus, she is.

24:35.880 --> 24:37.880
Oh, that's fucking...

24:37.920 --> 24:39.920
I should go.

24:39.920 --> 24:41.920
Yeah.

24:41.920 --> 24:43.920
You're gonna die with your raisin cookies, bitch.

24:43.920 --> 24:45.920
Ha ha ha.

24:45.920 --> 24:47.920
She is.

24:47.920 --> 24:49.920
Like, as soon as she leaves, I guarantee you they're gonna have

24:49.920 --> 24:51.920
a shot of her getting attacked and, like, they don't even notice.

24:51.920 --> 24:53.920
Look, the wheelchair

24:53.920 --> 24:55.920
is empty.

24:55.920 --> 24:57.920
Aw, no?

24:57.920 --> 24:59.920
She was just yawning. It's okay.

24:59.920 --> 25:01.920
Look, the dog is

25:01.920 --> 25:03.920
being sus.

25:03.920 --> 25:05.920
Yeah, the dog knows something's up.

25:05.960 --> 25:07.960
This is an airborne infection. Why isn't the little

25:07.960 --> 25:09.960
black girl starting to eat brains right about now?

25:09.960 --> 25:11.960
Uh, the spores...

25:11.960 --> 25:13.960
The spores die in direct

25:13.960 --> 25:15.960
sunlight.

25:15.960 --> 25:17.960
Yeah, but she was inside a second ago.

25:17.960 --> 25:19.960
There was sun coming through the windows.

25:19.960 --> 25:21.960
It also depends on, again, where the granny got

25:21.960 --> 25:23.960
the spores. Yeah, how long it's been.

25:23.960 --> 25:25.960
There's a bunch of factors.

25:25.960 --> 25:27.960
Yeah, but she didn't strike me like the kind

25:27.960 --> 25:29.960
who would be out and about on the regular.

25:29.960 --> 25:31.960
The spores take a couple hours

25:31.960 --> 25:33.960
to set in.

25:34.000 --> 25:36.000
There you go, man. You gotta plant them.

25:36.000 --> 25:38.000
It's me. Water them.

25:38.000 --> 25:40.000
There's a plant.

25:40.000 --> 25:42.000
Fertilize.

25:42.000 --> 25:44.000
We're at night time.

25:44.000 --> 25:46.000
It looks more like day for night, but still.

25:46.000 --> 25:48.000
Good job.

25:48.000 --> 25:50.000
You know what the show's gonna do.

25:50.000 --> 25:52.000
Yep. Yep, here we go.

25:52.000 --> 25:54.000
Yeah, this is the coach scene. The infamous coach

25:54.000 --> 25:56.000
scene from the start of the game.

25:56.000 --> 25:58.000
They gave us the wrong side.

25:58.000 --> 26:00.000
To be fair, I would rather the

26:00.000 --> 26:02.000
show be too bright and too dark.

26:02.040 --> 26:04.040
True. Remember Game of Thrones?

26:04.040 --> 26:06.040
We couldn't see shit.

26:06.040 --> 26:08.040
Where'd you get the money for this?

26:08.040 --> 26:10.040
Drugs. I sell hardcore

26:10.040 --> 26:12.040
drugs. It's better when I do.

26:12.040 --> 26:14.040
It was only $20, which I stole

26:14.040 --> 26:16.040
from you. I could have

26:16.040 --> 26:18.040
stolen $60, but I put the change back

26:18.040 --> 26:20.040
because I'm an honest thief. Besides,

26:20.040 --> 26:22.040
it's the thought that counts. Well, at least

26:22.040 --> 26:24.040
you missed.

26:24.040 --> 26:26.040
See, Connor, you were wrong about her. She's a lovely little girl.

26:26.040 --> 26:28.040
How did the show end?

26:28.040 --> 26:30.040
In the game, she actually

26:30.080 --> 26:32.080
paid for it herself, and

26:32.080 --> 26:34.080
she had the same joke, hardcore drugs,

26:34.080 --> 26:36.080
but then he just said, where'd you get the money

26:36.080 --> 26:38.080
for this? Drugs.

26:38.080 --> 26:40.080
I sell hardcore drugs. Oh, good.

26:40.080 --> 26:42.080
You can start helping out with the mortgage then.

26:42.080 --> 26:44.080
Yeah, you wish.

26:44.080 --> 26:46.080
Great, you can start paying off the mortgage.

26:46.080 --> 26:48.080
It was a better scene.

26:48.080 --> 26:50.080
It's not nearly

26:50.080 --> 26:52.080
as good. No.

26:52.080 --> 26:54.080
But if she's poor, we'll feel worse about her.

26:54.080 --> 26:56.080
Maybe.

26:56.080 --> 26:58.080
It's somewhat

26:58.120 --> 27:00.120
it's more accurate than the Halo TV show

27:00.120 --> 27:02.120
so far. Oh, god, the Halo

27:02.120 --> 27:04.120
TV show.

27:04.120 --> 27:06.120
And this Pablo's nose is much smaller.

27:06.120 --> 27:08.120
I still kind of want to go back and watch that

27:08.120 --> 27:10.120
because it was such a train wreck.

27:12.120 --> 27:14.120
Wait, that can be our next watch party,

27:14.120 --> 27:16.120
guys.

27:16.120 --> 27:18.120
I don't feel sick.

27:18.120 --> 27:20.120
Well, they're following the major story beats.

27:20.120 --> 27:22.120
So far.

27:24.120 --> 27:26.120
Jumpscare.

27:28.120 --> 27:30.120
Nope,

27:30.120 --> 27:32.120
just explosions.

27:34.120 --> 27:36.120
Fireworks and it's green.

27:36.120 --> 27:38.120
No,

27:38.120 --> 27:40.120
the Borg have showed up.

27:40.120 --> 27:42.120
On this

27:42.120 --> 27:44.120
average evening in the U.S.

27:48.120 --> 27:50.120
The feds are finally coming for your

27:50.120 --> 27:52.120
guns.

27:58.120 --> 28:00.120
It's been awful

28:00.120 --> 28:02.120
protect.

28:02.120 --> 28:04.120
It sounds like

28:04.120 --> 28:06.120
your family's fun.

28:06.120 --> 28:08.120
Mercy.

28:08.120 --> 28:10.120
In those

28:14.120 --> 28:16.120
they're kind of cute

28:16.120 --> 28:18.120
because they look like bananas with lovely bits.

28:18.120 --> 28:20.120
Don't want to go home.

28:20.120 --> 28:22.120
Granny ate

28:22.120 --> 28:24.120
other granny.

28:24.120 --> 28:26.120
I don't want those cookies.

28:26.160 --> 28:28.160
Mercy.

28:28.160 --> 28:30.160
That was not attached well.

28:30.160 --> 28:32.160
Now this is all gone completely

28:32.160 --> 28:34.160
off script from the game though right now.

28:34.160 --> 28:36.160
Yeah, yeah, it is because

28:36.160 --> 28:38.160
Joel's supposed to wake her up.

28:38.160 --> 28:40.160
Look, the wheelchair

28:40.160 --> 28:42.160
is empty now.

28:42.160 --> 28:44.160
Look, there's light coming through the window like

28:44.160 --> 28:46.160
it's daytime.

28:46.160 --> 28:48.160
Listen,

28:48.160 --> 28:50.160
after Games of Thrones, better to lighten

28:50.160 --> 28:52.160
through dark again.

28:52.160 --> 28:54.160
I still wouldn't be walking in here, to be honest.

28:54.200 --> 28:56.200
This is so

28:56.200 --> 28:58.200
coward.

28:58.200 --> 29:00.200
This is so unrealistic behavior.

29:00.200 --> 29:02.200
Oh.

29:02.200 --> 29:04.200
See, this is the point

29:04.200 --> 29:06.200
at which I'd be like, no,

29:06.200 --> 29:08.200
I'm leaving. It's time to go back home.

29:08.200 --> 29:10.200
I

29:10.200 --> 29:12.200
done all I could. Time to leave.

29:16.200 --> 29:18.200
Well, that's mildly

29:18.200 --> 29:20.200
disturbing.

29:20.200 --> 29:22.200
Looks like bean

29:22.240 --> 29:24.240
sprouts in her mouth.

29:31.240 --> 29:33.240
Yeah, to be fair,

29:33.240 --> 29:35.240
being that old and a zombie

29:35.240 --> 29:37.240
is not a good combo.

29:47.240 --> 29:49.240
Now there's the actions of a

29:49.240 --> 29:51.240
seasoned wife beater.

29:51.240 --> 29:53.240
Wait, you should go back

29:53.240 --> 29:55.240
into your house and get your weapons because

29:55.240 --> 29:57.240
you're a soldier. Surely you still have your rifle.

30:07.240 --> 30:09.240
Oh no.

30:09.240 --> 30:11.240
And they're going to get eaten.

30:11.240 --> 30:13.240
Fuck.

30:13.240 --> 30:15.240
Because they want to go help.

30:15.240 --> 30:17.240
So to be fair,

30:17.240 --> 30:19.240
this part of the show is exactly like

30:19.240 --> 30:21.240
the game.

30:21.240 --> 30:23.240
Yep, now we're back on track.

30:25.240 --> 30:27.240
Don't move to the cities,

30:27.240 --> 30:29.240
guys.

30:29.240 --> 30:31.240
Yep, it's the first place that will go in a

30:31.240 --> 30:33.240
fungus apocalypse.

30:35.240 --> 30:37.240
Well, at least Jimmy doesn't have to worry

30:37.240 --> 30:39.240
about the electricity prices anymore.

30:39.240 --> 30:41.240
Yeah,

30:41.240 --> 30:43.240
yeah, from the game,

30:43.240 --> 30:45.240
exactly.

30:45.240 --> 30:47.240
Now we're back on track.

30:47.240 --> 30:49.240
From the point of the game, you play as the girl.

30:49.240 --> 30:51.240
You can crawl around the back seat and see the entire

30:51.240 --> 30:53.240
scene 360 degrees.

30:53.240 --> 30:55.240
It was kind of cool, yeah.

30:55.240 --> 30:57.240
Yeah, it was pretty cool for the time.

31:07.240 --> 31:09.240
We're not getting there.

31:09.240 --> 31:11.240
Yeah, that is a smorgasbord.

31:11.240 --> 31:13.240
This is why

31:13.240 --> 31:15.240
everybody needs to read the

31:15.240 --> 31:17.240
zombie survival guide, so you don't make

31:17.240 --> 31:19.240
these silly mistakes when the zombie

31:19.240 --> 31:21.240
apocalypse hits.

31:21.240 --> 31:23.240
This is actually really good.

31:23.240 --> 31:25.240
I'm pleasantly surprised.

31:25.240 --> 31:27.240
It's actually not

31:27.240 --> 31:29.240
terrible.

31:29.240 --> 31:31.240
Yet.

31:31.240 --> 31:33.240
Keyboard.

31:33.240 --> 31:35.240
I quite appreciated the first person shots they did.

31:35.240 --> 31:37.240
That was nice. Very video gaming.

31:37.240 --> 31:39.240
Uh.

31:49.240 --> 31:51.240
I don't remember that.

31:51.240 --> 31:53.240
Grab something.

31:53.240 --> 31:55.240
Every apocalypse movie

31:55.240 --> 31:57.240
has to have the scene where the jumbo jet

31:57.240 --> 31:59.240
goes meow.

31:59.240 --> 32:01.240
Alright, now I

32:01.240 --> 32:03.240
know.

32:03.240 --> 32:05.240
I'm surprised that they have like

32:05.240 --> 32:07.240
all the buildings the same, too.

32:07.240 --> 32:09.240
Yeah, they make a good town.

32:09.240 --> 32:11.240
Yeah.

32:11.240 --> 32:13.240
Wow.

32:13.240 --> 32:15.240
I really enjoy

32:15.240 --> 32:17.240
the first person shots, honestly.

32:17.240 --> 32:19.240
They're really chaotic and weird.

32:19.240 --> 32:21.240
They feel

32:21.240 --> 32:23.240
non-cinematic, which is good.

32:23.240 --> 32:25.240
It gets me more in the spirit of the video

32:25.240 --> 32:27.240
game style of it.

32:27.240 --> 32:29.240
Quite nice.

32:29.240 --> 32:31.240
Somebody's gonna jump on the fender.

32:35.240 --> 32:37.240
That

32:37.240 --> 32:39.240
jumbo jet is going to have a hard time

32:39.240 --> 32:41.240
pulling off that maneuver.

32:41.240 --> 32:43.240
I think it's sawing.

32:43.240 --> 32:45.240
Yeah.

32:45.240 --> 32:47.240
Move.

32:47.240 --> 32:49.240
Move.

32:49.240 --> 32:51.240
Wow.

32:51.240 --> 32:53.240
Oh, shit.

32:57.240 --> 32:59.240
Actually, rather than explode, I'm pretty sure

32:59.240 --> 33:01.240
the cockpit and pooches of the plane would be barreling

33:01.240 --> 33:03.240
down the street at this point, but

33:03.240 --> 33:05.240
fair enough.

33:05.240 --> 33:07.240
Listen, it was filled entirely with explosives.

33:07.240 --> 33:09.240
But I wish they would have just skipped

33:09.240 --> 33:11.240
to this right off the bat and just

33:11.240 --> 33:13.240
kind of clover-field it, you know?

33:13.240 --> 33:15.240
Don't explain what's gonna happen, just

33:15.240 --> 33:17.240
boom, something awful is happening.

33:17.240 --> 33:19.240
Panic, panic, panic, panic. What the fuck?

33:19.240 --> 33:21.240
Yeah, the prologue kind of sucked on us.

33:21.240 --> 33:23.240
They might have actually been better served just

33:23.240 --> 33:25.240
barricading themselves in the house.

33:25.240 --> 33:27.240
No shit.

33:27.240 --> 33:29.240
You don't say.

33:29.240 --> 33:31.240
Considering they drove into town,

33:31.240 --> 33:33.240
into the shit-show.

33:33.240 --> 33:35.240
Yeah, in the game

33:35.240 --> 33:37.240
at the very least,

33:37.240 --> 33:39.240
a zombie came

33:39.240 --> 33:41.240
through, or at

33:41.240 --> 33:43.240
least the series would call it clicker

33:43.240 --> 33:45.240
with the window,

33:45.240 --> 33:47.240
so they couldn't barricade it.

33:47.240 --> 33:49.240
Yeah.

33:49.240 --> 33:51.240
You should have closed that door.

33:51.240 --> 33:53.240
His hands are sort of on the ground.

33:53.240 --> 33:55.240
Jesus, that guy's just jumping.

33:55.240 --> 33:57.240
That stunt man is pulling out all the

33:57.240 --> 33:59.240
stops, good on him.

33:59.240 --> 34:01.240
It's giving an unbelievable

34:01.240 --> 34:03.240
performance.

34:03.240 --> 34:05.240
My dude, that was a fucking

34:05.240 --> 34:07.240
exquisite shot.

34:07.240 --> 34:09.240
Don't move.

34:09.240 --> 34:11.240
Yes, sir.

34:11.240 --> 34:13.240
That's not a good sign.

34:13.240 --> 34:15.240
He's gonna let him go, though.

34:15.240 --> 34:17.240
He's a good person.

34:17.240 --> 34:19.240
He's gonna let him go, though.

34:19.240 --> 34:21.240
He's a good person.

34:21.240 --> 34:23.240
He's gonna let him go, though.

34:23.240 --> 34:25.240
Sir,

34:25.240 --> 34:27.240
we are not

34:27.240 --> 34:29.240
sick!

34:29.240 --> 34:31.240
Really?

34:31.240 --> 34:33.240
Aw, that's kind of cruel.

34:33.240 --> 34:35.240
They made the soldier

34:35.240 --> 34:37.240
a lot more mean in this version.

34:37.240 --> 34:39.240
He was like regretting it in the game.

34:39.240 --> 34:41.240
He was hesitating a lot more.

34:41.240 --> 34:43.240
I'm sorry.

34:43.240 --> 34:45.240
Oh, there we go.

34:45.240 --> 34:47.240
Though, I will

34:47.240 --> 34:49.240
say, okay, so, he

34:49.240 --> 34:51.240
single shot,

34:51.240 --> 34:53.240
fuck nails, a zombie,

34:53.240 --> 34:55.240
running, tilt, from

34:55.240 --> 34:57.240
the side,

34:57.240 --> 34:59.240
missing the civilians.

34:59.240 --> 35:01.240
But he fucks up a burst at point

35:01.240 --> 35:03.240
of blank range. He didn't fuck it up,

35:03.240 --> 35:05.240
March.

35:05.240 --> 35:07.240
He scored a good couple

35:07.240 --> 35:09.240
hits.

35:09.240 --> 35:11.240
You're okay. You're okay. Move your hand, baby.

35:11.240 --> 35:13.240
Those are 5-5-6's.

35:13.240 --> 35:15.240
Paolo should be hit, too.

35:15.240 --> 35:17.240
I don't think she's gonna be okay.

35:17.240 --> 35:19.240
Come on, baby.

35:19.240 --> 35:21.240
Is she gone?

35:21.240 --> 35:23.240
Come on, please.

35:23.240 --> 35:25.240
Is she gonzo?

35:25.240 --> 35:27.240
You know,

35:27.240 --> 35:29.240
again, I am actually pleasantly

35:29.240 --> 35:31.240
surprised so far. Again, I actually

35:31.240 --> 35:33.240
would have preferred to skip the fucking

35:33.240 --> 35:35.240
preamble. But this is

35:35.240 --> 35:37.240
nice, okay?

35:37.240 --> 35:39.240
I, too, I'm thinking like, oh, surely

35:39.240 --> 35:41.240
he's gonna let them go, right?

35:41.240 --> 35:43.240
I don't know what you're about to say, Dev.

35:43.240 --> 35:45.240
Arch-C's dying black child.

35:45.240 --> 35:47.240
This is nice.

35:47.240 --> 35:49.240
You know, I kind of appreciate that.

35:49.240 --> 35:51.240
This just reminds me of

35:51.240 --> 35:53.240
the good old days.

35:53.240 --> 35:55.240
So that was shot for shot exactly the

35:55.240 --> 35:57.240
scene from the game.

35:57.240 --> 35:59.240
It was very nice. Because I was thinking like, okay,

35:59.240 --> 36:01.240
surely the soldier's gonna be like, I can't just kill

36:01.240 --> 36:03.240
a fucking dude and his child.

36:03.240 --> 36:05.240
Because that would be the normal response.

36:05.240 --> 36:07.240
But no, he puts them down.

36:07.240 --> 36:09.240
That puts some stakes in it, because that means that

36:09.240 --> 36:11.240
the disease is that bad.

36:11.240 --> 36:13.240
Granted, I don't think a single soldier would be

36:13.240 --> 36:15.240
wandering around unaccompanied in the middle of a zombie

36:15.240 --> 36:17.240
pop news, but details, details.

36:17.240 --> 36:19.240
No, I don't even know what this is.

36:19.240 --> 36:21.240
Ah, no.

36:21.240 --> 36:23.240
This is a child who's

36:23.240 --> 36:25.240
outside, probably being

36:25.240 --> 36:27.240
more fungi than human.

36:29.240 --> 36:31.240
Isn't this Ellie?

36:31.240 --> 36:33.240
Uh, that looks like a boy?

36:37.240 --> 36:39.240
Kyle, we don't do the whole gender

36:39.240 --> 36:41.240
thing anymore. Hey, wait, this actually is

36:41.240 --> 36:43.240
Boston 2023.

36:43.240 --> 36:45.240
Damn, shot for shot, Dev. I see what you mean.

36:45.240 --> 36:47.240
Mm, pretty accurate.

36:47.240 --> 36:49.240
Don't worry, kid.

36:49.240 --> 36:51.240
You're in Boston now. Wakes up.

36:51.240 --> 36:53.240
Nooo.

36:53.240 --> 36:55.240
You can't leave.

36:55.240 --> 36:57.240
You know, they never really, I don't remember what they say

36:57.240 --> 36:59.240
happens in the lore as time goes on,

36:59.240 --> 37:01.240
but like, they're not government holdouts.

37:01.240 --> 37:03.240
Just not very many.

37:03.240 --> 37:05.240
Yeah, like, each city has a

37:05.240 --> 37:07.240
US government contingent that are there.

37:07.240 --> 37:09.240
And they kind of

37:09.240 --> 37:11.240
they're run by the Department of Health?

37:11.240 --> 37:13.240
It wouldn't be run by the Department of Health.

37:13.240 --> 37:15.240
I think it's because of the whole

37:15.240 --> 37:17.240
the whole virus part of it.

37:17.240 --> 37:19.240
That's why they're in charge.

37:19.240 --> 37:21.240
But it wouldn't.

37:21.240 --> 37:23.240
The US Army actually has contingency plans

37:23.240 --> 37:25.240
for this shit.

37:25.240 --> 37:27.240
For a zombie apocalypse?

37:27.240 --> 37:29.240
Yep. To be honest, I've heard

37:29.240 --> 37:31.240
that, like, if an actual zombie apocalypse

37:31.240 --> 37:33.240
happened, it would be reasonably easy to

37:33.240 --> 37:35.240
contain, all things considered.

37:35.240 --> 37:37.240
Then again,

37:37.240 --> 37:39.240
Then again with COVID, we haven't really

37:39.240 --> 37:41.240
we haven't really contained that.

37:41.240 --> 37:43.240
The problem would be the hesitation surrounding

37:43.240 --> 37:45.240
it. Figuring out what exactly is happening

37:45.240 --> 37:47.240
and the inertia of going like, yep, nope,

37:47.240 --> 37:49.240
actually, they're zombies.

37:49.240 --> 37:51.240
How well they handle it probably depends on what sort of zombies.

37:51.240 --> 37:53.240
But like, yeah.

37:53.240 --> 37:55.240
It is pretty funny that

37:55.240 --> 37:57.240
the actual US military has

37:57.240 --> 37:59.240
a disease for a zombie apocalypse.

37:59.240 --> 38:01.240
Who knows?

38:01.240 --> 38:03.240
I don't like where this is going.

38:03.240 --> 38:05.240
Toys?

38:05.240 --> 38:07.240
It was red.

38:07.240 --> 38:09.240
It was red.

38:09.240 --> 38:11.240
So she's infected.

38:11.240 --> 38:13.240
Yep, that needle there.

38:13.240 --> 38:15.240
That's medicine.

38:15.240 --> 38:17.240
And now you're gonna die.

38:17.240 --> 38:19.240
Yep.

38:19.240 --> 38:21.240
To be fair, this is a very nice way of doing it.

38:21.240 --> 38:23.240
Like, give her hope, like, everything's fine now,

38:23.240 --> 38:25.240
it's gonna be great, then she pulls sleep.

38:25.240 --> 38:27.240
Yep.

38:27.240 --> 38:29.240
Thing is, she was infected.

38:29.240 --> 38:31.240
Yeah, they didn't have a choice.

38:31.240 --> 38:33.240
Yep.

38:33.240 --> 38:35.240
But that way she went down

38:35.240 --> 38:37.240
and, you know, she had happy thoughts.

38:37.240 --> 38:39.240
Yeah. As sickening and sad as that is.

38:39.240 --> 38:41.240
No, no, that is exactly what you should do.

38:41.240 --> 38:43.240
Like, you can't save her, okay, make the best out of it.

38:43.240 --> 38:45.240
Is this, is this

38:45.240 --> 38:47.240
Joel's girlfriend?

38:47.240 --> 38:49.240
Yeah.

38:49.240 --> 38:51.240
Very ugly looking, if that's her.

38:51.240 --> 38:53.240
Well, here's the thing.

38:53.240 --> 38:55.240
This is actually the voice actor, actress

38:55.240 --> 38:57.240
who played Tess in the game.

38:57.240 --> 38:59.240
They got the same person back.

38:59.240 --> 39:01.240
Probably should have got somebody of the appropriate age

39:01.240 --> 39:03.240
to do, but yeah, I do appreciate the mantra.

39:03.240 --> 39:05.240
It has, it has been ten years

39:05.240 --> 39:07.240
since the game, yeah.

39:07.240 --> 39:09.240
Yes. I'm surprised this isn't a train wreck

39:09.240 --> 39:11.240
so far.

39:13.240 --> 39:15.240
There's the kid.

39:17.240 --> 39:19.240
Uh-huh.

39:19.240 --> 39:21.240
You know, in the

39:21.240 --> 39:23.240
post-apocalypse, that's a lot of valuable

39:23.240 --> 39:25.240
materials you're throwing away there.

39:25.240 --> 39:27.240
Yeah, the shirt and the, yeah,

39:27.240 --> 39:29.240
all the stuff.

39:29.240 --> 39:31.240
But the shirt's probably like

39:31.240 --> 39:33.240
Oh, infected? Yeah, yeah.

39:33.240 --> 39:35.240
Spores on the shirt.

39:35.240 --> 39:37.240
If there were spores on the shirt, then all of these workers

39:37.240 --> 39:39.240
are infected now too.

39:39.240 --> 39:41.240
Yeah, that's true. I mean, to be fair,

39:41.240 --> 39:43.240
she was put down before the

39:43.240 --> 39:45.240
spores could start, you know, coming out of her.

39:45.240 --> 39:47.240
Arch, Arch, don't question

39:47.240 --> 39:49.240
the efficacy of the masks, okay?

39:49.240 --> 39:51.240
That gets you kicked off

39:51.240 --> 39:53.240
YouTube.

39:53.240 --> 39:55.240
He's got peppered,

39:55.240 --> 39:57.240
grey peppered hair.

39:57.240 --> 39:59.240
If he was 36 before,

39:59.240 --> 40:01.240
he should be 50.

40:01.240 --> 40:03.240
56?

40:03.240 --> 40:05.240
Oh, the firefly symbol.

40:05.240 --> 40:07.240
I wonder if they'll ruin the firefly people.

40:07.240 --> 40:09.240
They'll make them communist or something.

40:09.240 --> 40:11.240
Since they're rebelling against the government.

40:15.240 --> 40:17.240
I don't want to spoil for Arch.

40:17.240 --> 40:19.240
But you can never leave.

40:19.240 --> 40:21.240
Uh, pause it for a second.

40:21.240 --> 40:23.240
Okay, sure.

40:23.240 --> 40:25.240
I like how I just tried to pause it.

40:25.240 --> 40:27.240
I don't think I can upload

40:27.240 --> 40:29.240
this file to something that would actually

40:29.240 --> 40:31.240
work on watch together.

40:31.240 --> 40:33.240
What's wrong, Barch? Barch?

40:33.240 --> 40:35.240
It's surprisingly good.

40:35.240 --> 40:37.240
What do you think, Lilith?

40:37.240 --> 40:39.240
I feel like what they added was enough that they

40:39.240 --> 40:41.240
it keeps things fresh because

40:41.240 --> 40:43.240
if it's just like a four shot for shot remake

40:43.240 --> 40:45.240
of the game, then

40:45.240 --> 40:47.240
it's played a game.

40:47.240 --> 40:49.240
It does need to be a little different, true.

40:49.240 --> 40:51.240
And I can get why they

40:51.240 --> 40:53.240
explain the fungal infection

40:53.240 --> 40:55.240
if it's just the viewers who aren't familiar

40:55.240 --> 40:57.240
with the game or the lore.

40:57.240 --> 40:59.240
That way people aren't just going to be like

40:59.240 --> 41:01.240
oh wow, this is just like another

41:01.240 --> 41:03.240
this is just like The Walking Dead

41:03.240 --> 41:05.240
duh duh duh

41:05.240 --> 41:07.240
Yeah, this was like uh

41:07.240 --> 41:09.240
I can see the reason why they did that.

41:09.240 --> 41:11.240
Hit that play button, Dev.

41:11.240 --> 41:13.240
Let's go.

41:13.240 --> 41:15.240
My play button's almost in the mail.

41:15.240 --> 41:17.240
Hope I get it.

41:17.240 --> 41:19.240
I don't know if you deserve it.

41:19.240 --> 41:21.240
Why is every Mexican

41:21.240 --> 41:23.240
drug dealer, Dev?

41:29.240 --> 41:31.240
Communists.

41:31.240 --> 41:33.240
Fucking communists.

41:33.240 --> 41:35.240
Ruin everything.

41:37.240 --> 41:39.240
I don't think she means that.

41:39.240 --> 41:41.240
I think this setup

41:51.240 --> 41:53.240
Wow.

41:53.240 --> 41:55.240
That's different from the game.

41:55.240 --> 41:57.240
Yeah.

41:57.240 --> 41:59.240
Communists, more like bomb-unists.

42:01.240 --> 42:03.240
Dev, seppuku, no.

42:03.240 --> 42:05.240
I knew that would get you.

42:09.240 --> 42:11.240
They don't care.

42:11.240 --> 42:13.240
Like you could be.

42:13.240 --> 42:15.240
They don't know.

42:15.240 --> 42:17.240
Is that the...

42:17.240 --> 42:19.240
Does she have

42:19.240 --> 42:21.240
alcohol fetal syndrome?

42:21.240 --> 42:23.240
Cause her face looks fucked.

42:23.240 --> 42:25.240
How did they find

42:25.240 --> 42:27.240
so many weird looking

42:27.240 --> 42:29.240
female characters?

42:29.240 --> 42:31.240
We went from Ellen Page.

42:31.240 --> 42:33.240
What's wrong with her forehead?

42:33.240 --> 42:35.240
It's huge.

42:35.240 --> 42:37.240
You just landed a plane on it.

42:37.240 --> 42:39.240
Her nose.

42:39.240 --> 42:41.240
Dude, fuck.

42:41.240 --> 42:43.240
That forehead's huge.

42:43.240 --> 42:45.240
Kibs, give me your best Plinkett impression.

42:45.240 --> 42:47.240
Like the size

42:47.240 --> 42:49.240
of Russia is how big

42:49.240 --> 42:51.240
her forehead is to the rest of us.

42:51.240 --> 42:53.240
It's just a huge endless landscape.

42:53.240 --> 42:55.240
Wow, she's giving the Roman salute.

42:55.240 --> 42:57.240
That escalates it quick.

43:01.240 --> 43:03.240
Hydra?

43:05.240 --> 43:07.240
She has none of the charm.

43:09.240 --> 43:11.240
Wow, I hate her already.

43:11.240 --> 43:13.240
Why do you like this character?

43:13.240 --> 43:15.240
She doesn't seem to have any of the charm

43:15.240 --> 43:17.240
that Ellie had.

43:17.240 --> 43:19.240
She's supposed to be charming?

43:19.240 --> 43:21.240
She's got a big forehead, alien looking eyes.

43:21.240 --> 43:23.240
Jesus.

43:23.240 --> 43:25.240
She just delivered them

43:25.240 --> 43:27.240
so not Ellie-like.

43:27.240 --> 43:29.240
Wow, he's being sneaky.

43:29.240 --> 43:31.240
Yeah, that's right.

43:31.240 --> 43:33.240
Regular people can't leave the quarantine zone.

43:33.240 --> 43:35.240
Can they?

43:35.240 --> 43:37.240
Those get shot.

43:37.240 --> 43:39.240
Lockdowns.

43:39.240 --> 43:41.240
The quarantine zone?

43:41.240 --> 43:43.240
I couldn't.

43:43.240 --> 43:45.240
Yep.

43:45.240 --> 43:47.240
That's why when the little kid waddled up, they let him in

43:47.240 --> 43:49.240
but they did the test.

43:49.240 --> 43:51.240
And if you're infected, they put you down.

43:51.240 --> 43:53.240
Yeah.

43:53.240 --> 43:55.240
No, I promised Robert that you wouldn't hurt him.

43:55.240 --> 43:57.240
But I would very much like for you to hurt him.

43:57.240 --> 43:59.240
So let's go hunt that motherfucker.

43:59.240 --> 44:01.240
I know.

44:01.240 --> 44:03.240
How dare you.

44:03.240 --> 44:05.240
Women? Liars?

44:05.240 --> 44:07.240
What?

44:07.240 --> 44:09.240
Ellie-based.

44:13.240 --> 44:15.240
She's not just a Mary Sue.

44:15.240 --> 44:17.240
She's got an ass beat. Hard to be a Mary Sue with an ass beat.

44:17.240 --> 44:19.240
Yeah.

44:19.240 --> 44:21.240
Well, the game was made back in 2013

44:21.240 --> 44:23.240
before a lot of the woke nonsense was everywhere.

44:31.240 --> 44:33.240
Very inspirational.

44:33.240 --> 44:35.240
Now this is new.

44:35.240 --> 44:37.240
Seeing their perspective.

44:45.240 --> 44:47.240
Okay. Listen up, fucking communists.

44:51.240 --> 44:53.240
You're in a zombie apocalypse.

44:53.240 --> 44:55.240
Military dictatorship is the best you can fucking hope for.

44:55.240 --> 44:57.240
You're just killing humans now.

44:57.240 --> 44:59.240
Disrupting supplies.

44:59.240 --> 45:01.240
Ruining shit.

45:01.240 --> 45:03.240
There's a lot of people.

45:05.240 --> 45:07.240
We're quitting? I'd go where?

45:07.240 --> 45:09.240
We're taking that random girl locked in that room.

45:09.240 --> 45:11.240
West.

45:11.240 --> 45:13.240
No, there's actually a reason for this.

45:13.240 --> 45:15.240
Are the African American Women's Liberation Army the bad guys?

45:15.240 --> 45:17.240
Yes.

45:17.240 --> 45:19.240
Yes.

45:19.240 --> 45:21.240
If you're thinking the Fireflies are

45:21.240 --> 45:23.240
quote unquote good guys, they are not.

45:23.240 --> 45:25.240
No.

45:25.240 --> 45:27.240
Immediately. They're blowing shit up

45:27.240 --> 45:29.240
in the only safe zone in the fucking...

45:29.240 --> 45:31.240
I wouldn't consider these people good guys

45:31.240 --> 45:33.240
regardless if they were supposed to be the good guys.

45:33.240 --> 45:35.240
Well, they're also talking about democracy and freedom

45:35.240 --> 45:37.240
though, you know. So, I don't know, maybe...

45:37.240 --> 45:39.240
Here's the thing. If the show

45:39.240 --> 45:41.240
was going to go down some kind of woke

45:41.240 --> 45:43.240
rabbit hole, they would

45:43.240 --> 45:45.240
make the Fireflies good guys.

45:45.240 --> 45:47.240
Even though in the video game the Fireflies were

45:47.240 --> 45:49.240
hypocrites. Yeah, they were just as bad

45:49.240 --> 45:51.240
as the government was.

45:51.240 --> 45:53.240
Yeah, that's what I remember doing.

45:53.240 --> 45:55.240
If you're feeling loud...

45:59.240 --> 46:01.240
You're rude.

46:01.240 --> 46:03.240
Yeah, you just invited him to

46:03.240 --> 46:05.240
join the communist movement. I wouldn't have

46:05.240 --> 46:07.240
given him a warning.

46:11.240 --> 46:13.240
Don't talk about this out walking down the street.

46:13.240 --> 46:15.240
Listen, they need to for the audience's sake.

46:15.240 --> 46:17.240
We've got to know what they're doing.

46:17.240 --> 46:19.240
Yeah, how else would we know?

46:19.240 --> 46:21.240
We're just going to have to guess.

46:21.240 --> 46:23.240
Oh my god.

46:25.240 --> 46:27.240
Oh yeah,

46:27.240 --> 46:29.240
you totally look like the kind of

46:29.240 --> 46:31.240
strong man to pull that fucking thing off

46:31.240 --> 46:33.240
the wall.

46:33.240 --> 46:35.240
Why did you stop him?

46:35.240 --> 46:37.240
Don't zoom into the

46:37.240 --> 46:39.240
forehead show. God dammit.

46:39.240 --> 46:41.240
It's so big.

46:41.240 --> 46:43.240
She might be an alien.

46:43.240 --> 46:45.240
Doesn't she have alcohol, fetal syndrome?

46:45.240 --> 46:47.240
Like for real.

46:47.240 --> 46:49.240
Look it up, Dev. I think she has it.

46:49.240 --> 46:51.240
She was in Game of Thrones.

46:51.240 --> 46:53.240
Did she have alcohol,

46:53.240 --> 46:55.240
fetal syndrome there too? Oh my god, it's not that

46:55.240 --> 46:57.240
character, is it? It's the Bear Island

46:57.240 --> 46:59.240
girl.

47:01.240 --> 47:03.240
That's creepy.

47:03.240 --> 47:05.240
Are you my fucking mom or something?

47:05.240 --> 47:07.240
I look like your mom.

47:07.240 --> 47:09.240
Yeah, that was pretty good.

47:09.240 --> 47:11.240
That's a good point.

47:11.240 --> 47:13.240
Terrorist?

47:13.240 --> 47:15.240
Yes, terrorist.

47:19.240 --> 47:21.240
Oh god, the Pito DLC.

47:25.240 --> 47:27.240
Yeah, don't elaborate on that any further.

47:27.240 --> 47:29.240
Just think about it.

47:29.240 --> 47:31.240
I forgot about the Pito

47:31.240 --> 47:33.240
DLC, okay?

47:35.240 --> 47:37.240
Why is your face so flat?

47:37.240 --> 47:39.240
It's like an anvil.

47:39.240 --> 47:41.240
We could craft great weapons on it.

47:41.240 --> 47:43.240
Jesus.

47:43.240 --> 47:45.240
Shields are the finest

47:45.240 --> 47:47.240
shields in armor.

47:47.240 --> 47:49.240
You know it against her flat face.

47:55.240 --> 47:57.240
There's an expansion they had

47:57.240 --> 47:59.240
for Last of Us 1 where she has a

47:59.240 --> 48:01.240
weird relationship as a child.

48:01.240 --> 48:03.240
And it was like, ooh, that was just uncanny.

48:03.240 --> 48:05.240
Well, it was with another child.

48:05.240 --> 48:07.240
But it was still kind of strange to play through, I will admit.

48:07.240 --> 48:09.240
They were like eight years old

48:09.240 --> 48:11.240
or something.

48:11.240 --> 48:13.240
They were kissing

48:13.240 --> 48:15.240
and I was like, really? Do you need

48:15.240 --> 48:17.240
to do that?

48:17.240 --> 48:19.240
Like, wait until they're older, please.

48:19.240 --> 48:21.240
Is this necessary?

48:21.240 --> 48:23.240
No, it isn't.

48:23.240 --> 48:25.240
Now to be fair, there wasn't any actual Pito

48:25.240 --> 48:27.240
shit because there was no adults interacting with them.

48:27.240 --> 48:29.240
I don't think kissing is inherently

48:29.240 --> 48:31.240
so true.

48:31.240 --> 48:33.240
It was uncanny.

48:33.240 --> 48:35.240
I think it was more the fact that the player was playing

48:35.240 --> 48:37.240
as it, you know?

48:37.240 --> 48:39.240
That was a bit odd.

48:39.240 --> 48:41.240
I just remember it was unsettling with our entire friend group

48:41.240 --> 48:43.240
when we played it.

48:43.240 --> 48:45.240
That's the one.

48:45.240 --> 48:47.240
Because, I mean, Kibs, I don't know,

48:47.240 --> 48:49.240
you remember being like nine or ten years old

48:49.240 --> 48:51.240
and you get your first smooch from

48:51.240 --> 48:53.240
a girl in your class and it's all innocent?

48:53.240 --> 48:55.240
Yeah, but I want to see other

48:55.240 --> 48:57.240
kids do that. That's weird.

48:57.240 --> 48:59.240
You just want to do it yourself.

48:59.240 --> 49:01.240
Yeah, when I did it as a kid,

49:01.240 --> 49:03.240
that's fine. I don't want to see other people do that.

49:03.240 --> 49:05.240
I think

49:05.240 --> 49:07.240
for me,

49:07.240 --> 49:09.240
it was playing as it

49:09.240 --> 49:11.240
that was a bit strange.

49:13.240 --> 49:15.240
Yep, there's a fungus person.

49:15.240 --> 49:17.240
Also, they'd be infected right now.

49:17.240 --> 49:19.240
Yeah, put on your masks.

49:19.240 --> 49:21.240
Oh, there's no mask in the show! Fuck you!

49:21.240 --> 49:23.240
I forgot!

49:23.240 --> 49:25.240
No.

49:27.240 --> 49:29.240
Yeah, they had gas masks.

49:29.240 --> 49:31.240
Yeah, they had gas masks.

49:31.240 --> 49:33.240
Because any time they turn into that,

49:33.240 --> 49:35.240
they turn into sport producers.

49:35.240 --> 49:37.240
But our friend Pedro

49:37.240 --> 49:39.240
didn't want to wear masks

49:39.240 --> 49:41.240
after the Mandalorian, so...

49:41.240 --> 49:43.240
It's a see-through mask, even.

49:43.240 --> 49:45.240
He negotiated masks

49:45.240 --> 49:47.240
out of the lore, basically.

49:47.240 --> 49:49.240
Are you serious?

49:49.240 --> 49:51.240
There are rumors going around that he threw

49:51.240 --> 49:53.240
a hissy fit during the Mandalorian.

49:53.240 --> 49:55.240
That's why they took his helmet off that one episode

49:55.240 --> 49:57.240
and that he refused to do anything like that again.

49:57.240 --> 49:59.240
He's an actor with no integrity,

49:59.240 --> 50:01.240
if that's the case.

50:01.240 --> 50:03.240
I respect actors that wear helmets

50:03.240 --> 50:05.240
and masks more than I do

50:05.240 --> 50:07.240
those that don't.

50:07.240 --> 50:09.240
I don't.

50:09.240 --> 50:11.240
Those that don't.

50:11.240 --> 50:13.240
The fuck?

50:13.240 --> 50:15.240
Like the Tread remake?

50:15.240 --> 50:17.240
That one...

50:17.240 --> 50:19.240
That Tread happy mask on the entire time?

50:19.240 --> 50:21.240
That was an excellent movie.

50:21.240 --> 50:23.240
Great actor, too.

50:23.240 --> 50:25.240
That was Carl Urban, right?

50:25.240 --> 50:27.240
Yep.

50:27.240 --> 50:29.240
Someone's red jelly is leaking out the side.

50:29.240 --> 50:33.240
That doesn't look like gunpowder.

50:33.240 --> 50:35.240
That's a hole.

50:35.240 --> 50:37.240
Oh, someone already got to

50:37.240 --> 50:39.240
the group.

50:39.240 --> 50:41.240
And there's the battery.

50:41.240 --> 50:43.240
That's

50:43.240 --> 50:45.240
very convenient, yeah.

50:45.240 --> 50:47.240
A little suspicious.

50:47.240 --> 50:49.240
Wouldn't that be valuable?

50:55.240 --> 50:57.240
Pull the trigger.

50:57.240 --> 50:59.240
You'll save us all a lot of trouble.

50:59.240 --> 51:01.240
So this is who Robert screwed us over with?

51:01.240 --> 51:03.240
The Che Guevara of Boston?

51:03.240 --> 51:05.240
Really warm up with going pretty shitty

51:05.240 --> 51:07.240
for you to be buying from scumbags like him.

51:07.240 --> 51:09.240
Yeah, it kind of has been.

51:09.240 --> 51:11.240
The merch was bad, and he obviously didn't take fuck off for an answer.

51:11.240 --> 51:13.240
Give me my knife.

51:13.240 --> 51:15.240
What do you need a car battery for?

51:15.240 --> 51:17.240
Go.

51:17.240 --> 51:19.240
Not at her.

51:19.240 --> 51:21.240
What do you mean?

51:23.240 --> 51:25.240
Hey, trigger discipline, though.

51:25.240 --> 51:29.240
That's a pretty basic test to use Che Guevara in a negative sense.

51:29.240 --> 51:31.240
Yep.

51:31.240 --> 51:33.240
You're remarkably chill for a woman whose spleen has been ventilated.

51:33.240 --> 51:35.240
Yeah.

51:51.240 --> 51:53.240
Jesus.

51:53.240 --> 51:55.240
Oh, it is blown off, though.

52:03.240 --> 52:05.240
What I do have is you.

52:05.240 --> 52:07.240
And I know what you're both capable of.

52:07.240 --> 52:09.240
For better or worse.

52:11.240 --> 52:13.240
I don't think you know what the word squadron means.

52:13.240 --> 52:15.240
You get her there safely,

52:15.240 --> 52:17.240
and they'll give you what you deserve.

52:17.240 --> 52:19.240
Yeah, it's not just a gang of people.

52:19.240 --> 52:21.240
She's not a very good revolutionary, okay?

52:21.240 --> 52:23.240
Arch, you gotta be gentle.

52:23.240 --> 52:25.240
You'll talk it through, but please remember that I'm bleeding out.

52:27.240 --> 52:31.240
Actually, I think that was her dialogue if you took too long.

52:31.240 --> 52:33.240
Which is kind of funny.

52:33.240 --> 52:35.240
It's like, hurry up!

52:35.240 --> 52:39.240
Man, I kind of want to just push her nose in to make it flat with the rest of her face.

52:39.240 --> 52:41.240
Jesus.

52:41.240 --> 52:43.240
I mean, then we could use the anvil.

52:43.240 --> 52:45.240
The anvil belly.

52:45.240 --> 52:47.240
She could be a hammer.

52:47.240 --> 52:51.240
She could. Like, grab her by the ankles and just wail her against the zombies.

52:51.240 --> 52:53.240
It's a bit mean, but yeah, you could.

52:53.240 --> 52:55.240
Don't fuck this up.

52:55.240 --> 52:57.240
Effective.

52:57.240 --> 52:59.240
Great blunt force damage.

52:59.240 --> 53:03.240
You could kill many zombies with a hammer that heavy.

53:03.240 --> 53:05.240
True.

53:05.240 --> 53:07.240
Looks a bit unwieldy, though.

53:07.240 --> 53:11.240
I remember when they made this deal, I think it was in a more open location, though.

53:11.240 --> 53:13.240
Are you sure?

53:13.240 --> 53:17.240
Yeah, because wasn't there a firefight that you played in game?

53:17.240 --> 53:19.240
You just got to kill some people.

53:21.240 --> 53:25.240
Because you got to shoot and stab people by this point.

53:29.240 --> 53:31.240
She's just going to start stealing stuff.

53:41.240 --> 53:43.240
Yeah, can she read? I wonder.

53:45.240 --> 53:47.240
Yeah, I guess so.

53:59.240 --> 54:01.240
Killing time.

54:01.240 --> 54:03.240
I'm sure you'll figure that out.

54:05.240 --> 54:11.240
There's plenty of alcohol on the table there, if you'd like to work on that thing of yours.

54:21.240 --> 54:25.240
This is an uncomfortably long shot following that simple sentence.

54:25.240 --> 54:27.240
Because he's having a little bit of PTSD.

54:27.240 --> 54:31.240
Well, this is another scene they're perfectly recreating from the game.

54:31.240 --> 54:33.240
Oh, the radio came on when you were sleeping.

54:33.240 --> 54:35.240
What?

54:35.240 --> 54:37.240
What was the song?

54:37.240 --> 54:39.240
It kept saying, like, wake me up before you go-go.

54:39.240 --> 54:41.240
Ha, ha, cursed.

54:41.240 --> 54:43.240
Gotcha.

54:43.240 --> 54:45.240
80s means trouble.

54:45.240 --> 54:47.240
Code broken.

54:47.240 --> 54:49.240
That's pretty good.

54:49.240 --> 54:51.240
Pretty clever.

54:51.240 --> 54:53.240
Well, Ellie was clever in the game, too.

54:53.240 --> 54:55.240
You got a jacket in your pack?

54:55.240 --> 54:57.240
Yeah.

54:57.240 --> 54:59.240
Is she not wearing a jacket?

54:59.240 --> 55:01.240
Yeah, that's a good point.

55:01.240 --> 55:03.240
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

55:03.240 --> 55:05.240
Two jackets.

55:05.240 --> 55:07.240
All right, well, chilly, I guess.

55:07.240 --> 55:09.240
Fair enough.

55:09.240 --> 55:11.240
So far I'm liking the sets, though.

55:11.240 --> 55:13.240
Yeah.

55:13.240 --> 55:15.240
It seems like they sunk a lot of money into this.

55:15.240 --> 55:17.240
And, I mean, I think you only see Boston.

55:17.240 --> 55:19.240
Like, at this point, they leave Boston and don't come back, right?

55:19.240 --> 55:21.240
So, it's not like you're going back to this set.

55:21.240 --> 55:23.240
Yeah, that's true.

55:23.240 --> 55:25.240
Because if they're ever in the game, they never come back to Boston.

55:25.240 --> 55:27.240
Because, you know, they're leaving.

55:27.240 --> 55:29.240
Well, the entrance just kind of looks like a prison.

55:29.240 --> 55:31.240
They probably filled in the gates of a prison, I guess.

55:31.240 --> 55:33.240
Yeah.

55:33.240 --> 55:35.240
Just added to the game.

55:35.240 --> 55:37.240
Yeah.

55:37.240 --> 55:39.240
Yeah.

55:39.240 --> 55:41.240
They probably filled in the gates of a prison, I guess.

55:41.240 --> 55:43.240
Yeah.

55:43.240 --> 55:45.240
Just added some stuff around.

55:45.240 --> 55:47.240
Decorated the town to make it look a little run-down.

55:47.240 --> 55:49.240
Yep.

55:49.240 --> 55:51.240
Well, I think they intend to come back after this job.

55:51.240 --> 55:53.240
They just don't because of reasons.

55:55.240 --> 56:01.240
They were recording a Norwegian big movie set in the World War II once when I was in Oslo.

56:01.240 --> 56:03.240
And there were swastikas everywhere.

56:03.240 --> 56:05.240
And it made me feel a bit weird.

56:05.240 --> 56:07.240
Ha, ha, ha.

56:07.240 --> 56:13.240
Well, I didn't know. So I just walked down the street and there's a ginormous swastika hanging on Parliament.

56:13.240 --> 56:15.240
I'm like, huh, something interesting has happened.

56:15.240 --> 56:17.240
Ha, ha, ha.

56:17.240 --> 56:19.240
That is something to see, yeah.

56:19.240 --> 56:21.240
Ah, yes.

56:21.240 --> 56:23.240
They're walking through the whole universe.

56:23.240 --> 56:25.240
Change in policy, it seems.

56:25.240 --> 56:27.240
Yeah.

56:27.240 --> 56:29.240
That last election was pretty eventful.

56:29.240 --> 56:31.240
Yep.

56:31.240 --> 56:37.240
Also, like, they're recreating the levels.

56:37.240 --> 56:39.240
Yeah, they actually are.

56:39.240 --> 56:43.240
Because you go under a school bus and then through a ravine with concrete slabs.

56:43.240 --> 56:47.240
They're actually just doing area for area from the game.

56:47.240 --> 56:49.240
It's kind of incredible.

56:49.240 --> 56:53.240
I can't tell if I haven't played it, but...

56:53.240 --> 56:55.240
This feels like the game.

56:55.240 --> 56:59.240
Did this fucking demolish the argument of every other poor adaptation, though?

56:59.240 --> 57:03.240
This demolishes the Halo argument.

57:03.240 --> 57:07.240
Where they're like, we couldn't just recreate the TV show, it'd be awful.

57:07.240 --> 57:11.240
This is recreating the video game and it's actually interesting to watch.

57:11.240 --> 57:17.240
Yeah, because they go under a school bus.

57:17.240 --> 57:19.240
And do a pipe, yeah.

57:19.240 --> 57:21.240
Through a ravine with concrete.

57:21.240 --> 57:23.240
There's a red truck there.

57:23.240 --> 57:25.240
And then they go into a pipe.

57:25.240 --> 57:27.240
They remade the level for the set.

57:27.240 --> 57:29.240
It's kind of nuts.

57:29.240 --> 57:33.240
Yeah, that's probably going to be in the military class.

57:33.240 --> 57:35.240
Yeah.

57:35.240 --> 57:37.240
Mm-hmm.

57:37.240 --> 57:39.240
That's correct, though.

57:39.240 --> 57:41.240
That should be coming up soon.

57:41.240 --> 57:43.240
There it is.

57:43.240 --> 57:45.240
He's pissed again.

57:45.240 --> 57:47.240
You gotta shoot him.

57:53.240 --> 57:59.240
That thing is going to beep red, ain't it?

57:59.240 --> 58:03.240
Not on her or him, but on that chick.

58:03.240 --> 58:05.240
Great.

58:19.240 --> 58:21.240
Yeah.

58:23.240 --> 58:29.240
That's a good research and flashback.

58:37.240 --> 58:39.240
He'll be dead soon.

58:39.240 --> 58:41.240
He's probably dead now.

58:41.240 --> 58:43.240
See, I think this is actually new to the show.

58:43.240 --> 58:47.240
Yeah, I don't remember him having a spur go.

58:47.240 --> 58:49.240
But that's, again...

58:53.240 --> 58:55.240
Nobody lasts more than a day.

58:55.240 --> 58:57.240
Just look at the health to you.

58:57.240 --> 58:59.240
You would have killed me.

58:59.240 --> 59:01.240
When did it happen?

59:01.240 --> 59:03.240
It doesn't matter. You have to trust me.

59:03.240 --> 59:05.240
They're going to catch you if we don't run.

59:05.240 --> 59:07.240
Joe, we gotta move.

59:07.240 --> 59:09.240
Yeah, I think it happened later, though.

59:09.240 --> 59:11.240
It was a different moment.

59:11.240 --> 59:13.240
Mm-hmm.

59:13.240 --> 59:15.240
I think. It's been a while for me, too.

59:15.240 --> 59:17.240
Yeah, take the gun, dude. Take the gun.

59:17.240 --> 59:19.240
Nice.

59:19.240 --> 59:21.240
Good upgrade.

59:21.240 --> 59:23.240
I would have checked his body for some ammo, but, you know.

59:23.240 --> 59:25.240
So they're hitting all the story beats.

59:25.240 --> 59:27.240
They're changing things a little bit

59:27.240 --> 59:29.240
just to make it work for TV,

59:29.240 --> 59:31.240
but they're not changing it ridiculously.

59:31.240 --> 59:33.240
It's not like the Halo TV show

59:33.240 --> 59:35.240
where it has nothing to do with Halo at all.

59:35.240 --> 59:37.240
Wait, what song is this?

59:37.240 --> 59:39.240
That scene looks pretty good, too.

59:39.240 --> 59:41.240
It's easy.

59:45.240 --> 59:47.240
Is that the Tilted Towers?

59:47.240 --> 59:49.240
Yes.

59:51.240 --> 59:53.240
There's that one, like...

59:53.240 --> 59:55.240
There's that one

59:55.240 --> 59:57.240
very well-known level

59:57.240 --> 59:59.240
that happens in a Tilted Tower

59:59.240 --> 01:00:01.240
that looks exactly like that.

01:00:01.240 --> 01:00:03.240
They're doing so much stuff just for the fans,

01:00:03.240 --> 01:00:05.240
you know what I mean?

01:00:05.240 --> 01:00:07.240
There's a few inaccuracies here and there, though.

01:00:07.240 --> 01:00:09.240
Like, you know, his daughter being black,

01:00:09.240 --> 01:00:11.240
and her daughter was literally white-haired, blue-eyed.

01:00:11.240 --> 01:00:13.240
I'm going to pause this so I don't get fucking copyrighted

01:00:13.240 --> 01:00:15.240
any more than I already am.

01:00:15.240 --> 01:00:17.240
Listen, Kyle, it's the current year.

01:00:17.240 --> 01:00:19.240
They had to do something like that.

01:00:19.240 --> 01:00:21.240
I know, but it's our job to look at it with a critical eye,

01:00:21.240 --> 01:00:23.240
so there are some differences.

01:00:23.240 --> 01:00:25.240
But Joel's hairdo,

01:00:25.240 --> 01:00:27.240
like on the actor,

01:00:27.240 --> 01:00:29.240
the facial hair, the hairstyle,

01:00:29.240 --> 01:00:31.240
him getting the, you know,

01:00:31.240 --> 01:00:35.240
black and salt and black pepper-like style hair,

01:00:35.240 --> 01:00:37.240
where it's mixed with grey there,

01:00:37.240 --> 01:00:39.240
that's accurate.

01:00:39.240 --> 01:00:41.240
That is on the right path there.

01:00:41.240 --> 01:00:43.240
A lot of stuff is just shot-for-shot identical.

01:00:43.240 --> 01:00:45.240
A lot of stuff,

01:00:45.240 --> 01:00:47.240
they try to deliver the lines the same way.

01:00:47.240 --> 01:00:49.240
They make some mistakes here and there,

01:00:49.240 --> 01:00:51.240
they change a few things,

01:00:51.240 --> 01:00:53.240
but it's overall, like,

01:00:53.240 --> 01:00:55.240
very faithful.

01:00:55.240 --> 01:00:59.240
Looks pretty much just like she did in the game.

01:00:59.240 --> 01:01:01.240
Really? I thought she had frizzy hair in the game.

01:01:01.240 --> 01:01:03.240
She had frizzy hair,

01:01:03.240 --> 01:01:05.240
but she pretty much looks right.

01:01:05.240 --> 01:01:07.240
With Ellie,

01:01:07.240 --> 01:01:09.240
I get what everybody's saying.

01:01:09.240 --> 01:01:11.240
I think she, at the very least,

01:01:11.240 --> 01:01:13.240
sounds a bit like Ellie,

01:01:13.240 --> 01:01:15.240
at the very least, like her tones and inclinations.

01:01:15.240 --> 01:01:17.240
She sounds a bit like her,

01:01:17.240 --> 01:01:19.240
but she doesn't look like her,

01:01:19.240 --> 01:01:21.240
and doesn't have the body language of her.

01:01:21.240 --> 01:01:23.240
So for the actress who's playing Ellie,

01:01:23.240 --> 01:01:25.240
she's actually doing a pretty convincing job

01:01:25.240 --> 01:01:27.240
of winning me over via time,

01:01:27.240 --> 01:01:29.240
but, like, definitely the opening shot.

01:01:29.240 --> 01:01:33.240
She doesn't quite have the look of Ellie, though.

01:01:33.240 --> 01:01:35.240
Yeah.

01:01:35.240 --> 01:01:37.240
So, Arch, you don't know any of this stuff, right?

01:01:37.240 --> 01:01:39.240
You're completely ignorant of all this.

01:01:39.240 --> 01:01:41.240
He's just a blondie, that's true.

01:01:41.240 --> 01:01:43.240
From what I see,

01:01:43.240 --> 01:01:45.240
Ellie's character is,

01:01:45.240 --> 01:01:47.240
from the TV show, not the TV show,

01:01:47.240 --> 01:01:49.240
the game,

01:01:49.240 --> 01:01:51.240
from the screenshot, she looks clearly designed

01:01:51.240 --> 01:01:53.240
to be young and cute-looking.

01:01:53.240 --> 01:01:55.240
Like, innocent is a better word.

01:01:55.240 --> 01:01:57.240
You know?

01:01:57.240 --> 01:01:59.240
Little upturned nose, blue inquisitive eyes,

01:01:59.240 --> 01:02:01.240
small mouth, et cetera,

01:02:01.240 --> 01:02:03.240
very clearly designed to

01:02:03.240 --> 01:02:05.240
give an idea of innocence, right?

01:02:05.240 --> 01:02:07.240
She looks like a kid.

01:02:07.240 --> 01:02:09.240
This character in the TV show,

01:02:09.240 --> 01:02:11.240
she doesn't look like a kid.

01:02:11.240 --> 01:02:13.240
She looks like a grown woman

01:02:13.240 --> 01:02:15.240
that's been dressed up as a child

01:02:15.240 --> 01:02:17.240
for reasons.

01:02:17.240 --> 01:02:19.240
Yeah.

01:02:19.240 --> 01:02:21.240
Looked it up, her actress

01:02:21.240 --> 01:02:23.240
is, uh,

01:02:23.240 --> 01:02:25.240
19 years old now.

01:02:25.240 --> 01:02:27.240
When she first came to prominence,

01:02:27.240 --> 01:02:29.240
it was... Really?

01:02:29.240 --> 01:02:31.240
She looks a lot older than that.

01:02:31.240 --> 01:02:33.240
She's 19. When she first came to prominence,

01:02:33.240 --> 01:02:35.240
was

01:02:35.240 --> 01:02:37.240
in 2016

01:02:37.240 --> 01:02:39.240
in Game of Thrones

01:02:39.240 --> 01:02:41.240
Season 6. So how many years ago

01:02:41.240 --> 01:02:43.240
was that? Seven years ago. So she was

01:02:43.240 --> 01:02:45.240
what, 12 back then? As Leanna

01:02:45.240 --> 01:02:47.240
Mormont, she actually looks like she could be Ellie.

01:02:47.240 --> 01:02:49.240
Leanna Mormont, she looks

01:02:49.240 --> 01:02:51.240
more like Ellie.

01:02:51.240 --> 01:02:53.240
She looks like she could be Ellie at

01:02:53.240 --> 01:02:55.240
that age, but she was, she was 12

01:02:55.240 --> 01:02:57.240
in that photo. How old was

01:02:57.240 --> 01:02:59.240
Ellie in the video game? Do you remember?

01:02:59.240 --> 01:03:01.240
I think she was between 12 and 14.

01:03:01.240 --> 01:03:03.240
Okay, gotcha.

01:03:03.240 --> 01:03:05.240
They're probably just like, oh, she was

01:03:05.240 --> 01:03:07.240
great in Game of Thrones, and they're like, wait, that was

01:03:07.240 --> 01:03:09.240
seven years ago.

01:03:09.240 --> 01:03:11.240
Yeah, it's like she's a little too old now.

01:03:11.240 --> 01:03:13.240
It's also just that her

01:03:13.240 --> 01:03:15.240
facial features are wrong

01:03:15.240 --> 01:03:17.240
for this. Like,

01:03:17.240 --> 01:03:19.240
as a kid, she looked

01:03:19.240 --> 01:03:21.240
alright for the role, but now

01:03:21.240 --> 01:03:23.240
she,

01:03:23.240 --> 01:03:25.240
she looks,

01:03:25.240 --> 01:03:27.240
she's got this weird androgynous

01:03:27.240 --> 01:03:29.240
feel to her, and she looks

01:03:29.240 --> 01:03:31.240
way older than

01:03:31.240 --> 01:03:33.240
19. Is that just me?

01:03:33.240 --> 01:03:35.240
I could see her 19, but she does definitely

01:03:35.240 --> 01:03:37.240
look more androgynous than Ellie looked.

01:03:37.240 --> 01:03:39.240
Ellie was not an androgynous character. Okay, Arx,

01:03:39.240 --> 01:03:41.240
this is more for your benefit,

01:03:41.240 --> 01:03:43.240
but it will be interesting to compare.

01:03:43.240 --> 01:03:45.240
This is from The Last of Us Part 1 Remake.

01:03:45.240 --> 01:03:47.240
It's a remake of the original game. All the

01:03:47.240 --> 01:03:49.240
Joel and Ellie cutscenes. We're just going to watch a few,

01:03:49.240 --> 01:03:51.240
and we're not going to watch all of them, and we're not going to watch the whole

01:03:51.240 --> 01:03:53.240
thing, but I just want to show you

01:03:53.240 --> 01:03:55.240
specifically, like...

01:04:01.240 --> 01:04:03.240
Let her go.

01:04:15.240 --> 01:04:17.240
Yeah, you were right, Kibbs. They were in a

01:04:17.240 --> 01:04:19.240
room, not a hallway.

01:04:31.240 --> 01:04:53.240
So, they're hitting the

01:04:53.240 --> 01:04:55.240
same story beats, and they're doing kind of

01:04:55.240 --> 01:04:57.240
the same things.

01:04:57.240 --> 01:04:59.240
I think they have to change some of it,

01:04:59.240 --> 01:05:01.240
but it seems reasonably faithful.

01:05:03.240 --> 01:05:05.240
This is the same scene.

01:05:29.240 --> 01:05:47.240
So, again, same scene. They just kind of paste it differently.

01:05:47.240 --> 01:05:49.240
I think I've heard the original for this one.

01:05:49.240 --> 01:05:53.240
Well, I still think the video game does a lot of things always better.

01:05:53.240 --> 01:05:55.240
Yeah.

01:05:55.240 --> 01:05:57.240
Because it was how the vision was intended to be.

01:05:57.240 --> 01:05:59.240
Yeah, me too.

01:05:59.240 --> 01:06:01.240
Alright.

01:06:03.240 --> 01:06:07.240
Yeah, this scene was different.

01:06:07.240 --> 01:06:09.240
Yep, because it was a soldier, they didn't have a history with it.

01:06:09.240 --> 01:06:11.240
Yeah.

01:06:11.240 --> 01:06:13.240
That was added for the show, I think.

01:06:19.240 --> 01:06:21.240
They also called it in right away.

01:06:25.240 --> 01:06:27.240
Yep.

01:06:29.240 --> 01:06:31.240
Yep.

01:06:55.240 --> 01:06:57.240
No, they do find out here.

01:06:57.240 --> 01:06:59.240
Yep.

01:07:25.240 --> 01:07:27.240
It's three weeks old.

01:07:27.240 --> 01:07:29.240
No, everyone turns within two days, so you stop bullshitting.

01:07:29.240 --> 01:07:31.240
It's three weeks.

01:07:31.240 --> 01:07:33.240
I swear.

01:07:33.240 --> 01:07:35.240
Why would she set you up?

01:07:39.240 --> 01:07:43.240
They take a lot better time explaining it here, though.

01:07:43.240 --> 01:07:59.240
They do, but I will say I think showing the PTSD was probably a better way to do the scene.

01:07:59.240 --> 01:08:01.240
Yeah, a couple of things.

01:08:01.240 --> 01:08:05.240
Joel had a better reaction in the show.

01:08:05.240 --> 01:08:09.240
Now, a soldier being on guard by himself is fucking retarded.

01:08:09.240 --> 01:08:11.240
That was a good scene.

01:08:11.240 --> 01:08:15.240
The PTSD was well explained, and it makes Joel feel more human.

01:08:15.240 --> 01:08:19.240
Whereas here, they both just fucking coldheartedly kill a couple of soldiers like it's nothing.

01:08:19.240 --> 01:08:21.240
Yes.

01:08:21.240 --> 01:08:23.240
Ellie's reaction, too, I think I know what I don't like.

01:08:23.240 --> 01:08:27.240
Because this Ellie is way softer, gentler.

01:08:27.240 --> 01:08:31.240
She feels younger, more naive.

01:08:31.240 --> 01:08:35.240
Like she doesn't understand the seriousness of the situation.

01:08:35.240 --> 01:08:37.240
When she stabs the soldiers, she says, sorry.

01:08:37.240 --> 01:08:39.240
I thought we were just going to hold them up.

01:08:39.240 --> 01:08:41.240
TV show, none of that.

01:08:41.240 --> 01:08:43.240
She just stabs them.

01:08:43.240 --> 01:08:49.240
The far more innocent delivery makes me instantly feel more for her.

01:08:49.240 --> 01:08:51.240
It makes her feel like a young kid in need of protection.

01:08:51.240 --> 01:08:57.240
Whereas in the TV show, there's far too much strong female character in the mix.

01:08:57.240 --> 01:09:01.240
Yeah, she needs to be a little bit more naive.

01:09:01.240 --> 01:09:05.240
Ellie is a strong little lady, and she can actually take a punch.

01:09:05.240 --> 01:09:09.240
She's also extremely vulgar, even in the game.

01:09:09.240 --> 01:09:13.240
But she also is inexperienced, and so death is still hard for her.

01:09:13.240 --> 01:09:21.240
Now, in the video game, it makes a lot more sense that Joel and Tess aren't bothered by death as much, because they've dealt with it so much.

01:09:21.240 --> 01:09:23.240
They've become desensitized to it.

01:09:23.240 --> 01:09:27.240
That's why in the video game, they're not bothered by killing, because they've killed before.

01:09:27.240 --> 01:09:29.240
Many times.

01:09:29.240 --> 01:09:41.240
In the show, it's implied that they've killed two, but in the game, by the time you get to the end of episode one in the show, you've already killed dozens, if not a hundred people.

01:09:41.240 --> 01:09:43.240
Yeah, you could kill a lot of people over the course of the game.

01:09:43.240 --> 01:09:45.240
It is because of a video game, yes.

01:09:45.240 --> 01:09:47.240
But I think you're right, Arch.

01:09:47.240 --> 01:09:57.240
In case you haven't been able to tell at this point, they're trying to do a Joel finds a replacement daughter storyline, obviously, right?

01:09:57.240 --> 01:10:03.240
And to do that, you have to have Ellie be at least kinda likable.

01:10:03.240 --> 01:10:07.240
Well, she needs to be a kid.

01:10:07.240 --> 01:10:09.240
Yeah.

01:10:09.240 --> 01:10:13.240
The character in the TV show does not strike me as a kid at all.

01:10:13.240 --> 01:10:21.240
At the absolute most optimistic, she strikes me as a late teenage know-it-all.

01:10:21.240 --> 01:10:35.240
I looked it up, she's 14 in the first game, she's 12 during the Discovering I'm a Lesbian DLC, and she's 19 in the second game.

01:10:35.240 --> 01:10:39.240
She doesn't seem like a 14-year-old in this show.

01:10:39.240 --> 01:10:45.240
Again, I think that is the thing. There's too much strong female in this.

01:10:45.240 --> 01:10:49.240
Yeah, the whole stabbing the guy and just go rawr at the same time.

01:10:49.240 --> 01:10:57.240
And the thing is too, in the clip you showed there where she tried to do the whole stabby thing to begin with, she was clearly shit at it.

01:10:57.240 --> 01:10:59.240
And she was caught easily.

01:10:59.240 --> 01:11:05.240
Whereas in the TV show, she straight up fucking ambushes Joel, and it's only because he's a ninja that he manages to stop her.

01:11:05.240 --> 01:11:09.240
Let's go, episode 2. Enough intermission.

01:11:09.240 --> 01:11:11.240
Well, this definitely wasn't in the game.

01:11:11.240 --> 01:11:13.240
Nope.

01:11:13.240 --> 01:11:23.240
Jakarta, Indonesia. Wow, we've seen change rather violently. Please speak English. You know you want to.

01:11:23.240 --> 01:11:27.240
Hello!

01:11:27.240 --> 01:11:29.240
We are looking for zombies.

01:11:29.240 --> 01:11:37.240
Wait, they're going to do a racist food thing, aren't they? You guys ate some weird mushrooms and now we're all infected.

01:11:43.240 --> 01:11:53.240
This is all new.

01:11:53.240 --> 01:12:01.240
You say that, but we're going to show you something interesting now.

01:12:01.240 --> 01:12:03.240
Oh damn.

01:12:03.240 --> 01:12:05.240
I didn't need that video game.

01:12:05.240 --> 01:12:10.240
Wait, do I have to censor these boobs? No! Extra work!

01:12:10.240 --> 01:12:12.240
Why do you have to censor the pubes, too?

01:12:12.240 --> 01:12:16.240
Why do you have to support them, isn't it? They'll free the nipple.

01:12:16.240 --> 01:12:18.240
Mmm.

01:12:18.240 --> 01:12:20.240
You jailed the nipple. Now.

01:12:20.240 --> 01:12:28.240
Oh luckily she took time to paint her toes. Isn't that nice?

01:12:28.240 --> 01:12:29.240
Ooh.

01:12:29.240 --> 01:12:32.240
Yeah, it's fungus on the inside.

01:12:32.240 --> 01:12:36.240
She's going to chomp.

01:12:36.240 --> 01:12:39.240
Nah, she'd open her eyes first so she'd really freak out.

01:12:39.240 --> 01:12:41.240
Wriggly tentacles?

01:12:41.240 --> 01:12:45.240
The little tendrils in the mouth, that's new, Dev, isn't it?

01:12:45.240 --> 01:12:52.240
Yeah, that's the transmission method now. Because, remember, they removed the spores. They now transmit via tentacle sex.

01:12:52.240 --> 01:12:59.240
That's why when they were on top of people they kept, like, mouthing over them because the tentacles were planting more fungi bits.

01:12:59.240 --> 01:13:02.240
It still feels like an unnecessary change, if you ask me.

01:13:20.240 --> 01:13:24.240
That is admirably cold and I appreciate that.

01:13:24.240 --> 01:13:29.240
I like how the turtle dude's like, holy shit.

01:13:35.240 --> 01:13:41.240
Hold on. Wait on your woman moment for a second.

01:13:41.240 --> 01:13:48.240
At least be like, wait to bomb till I've left with my family. But no, she's like, I just won't go home and get bombed now.

01:13:48.240 --> 01:13:53.240
Well, she's probably thinking that she might be infected because she was just in there, right?

01:13:53.240 --> 01:13:56.240
Possibly. She was in a vacuum-sealed suit.

01:13:56.240 --> 01:13:58.240
Yeah.

01:13:58.240 --> 01:14:00.240
Plus, remember, again, it's not airborne.

01:14:00.240 --> 01:14:04.240
This intro is still creatively bankrupt. I can't get over it.

01:14:04.240 --> 01:14:13.240
It's like, I don't like these deviations. It feels like the show is thinking to itself, are you actually kind of wanting to do a different zombie apocalypse thing?

01:14:13.240 --> 01:14:19.240
They're like, we don't need these 10 minutes, this is what happened befores.

01:14:19.240 --> 01:14:28.240
Yeah, because all these scenes are is trying to justify the changes to the lore as to why it's not spore-based anymore, which is retarded.

01:14:28.240 --> 01:14:31.240
It's like 20 minutes of pointless justification.

01:14:31.240 --> 01:14:35.240
Because the zombies are spores.

01:14:35.240 --> 01:14:42.240
So the reason why that zombie was on the wall arch is because at the next stage what happens is they start emitting those spores.

01:14:42.240 --> 01:14:45.240
Because that's how they continue to infect and continue to spread.

01:14:45.240 --> 01:14:48.240
Yeah, they're in giant mushrooms, they just start blowing spores everywhere.

01:14:48.240 --> 01:14:53.240
Yeah, but now that doesn't make any sense for them to do that. There's no reason for it.

01:14:53.240 --> 01:14:59.240
The whole point of the zombie reproduction in the game is that it would make spore zones underground.

01:14:59.240 --> 01:15:06.240
Yep. And that has now been invalidated, which kind of undermines the whole reproductive process.

01:15:06.240 --> 01:15:11.240
I think the reason that the clickers were blind is because they were sensitive to light.

01:15:11.240 --> 01:15:15.240
And so that drove them underground to...

01:15:16.240 --> 01:15:24.240
Sensitive to UV, hence why the clickers when they're at that stage go underground to then turn into the big giant spores which produce more airborne spores.

01:15:24.240 --> 01:15:27.240
They just watch all night to make sure she didn't turn overnight.

01:15:31.240 --> 01:15:34.240
That's Boston. I think any spot is as good as any other.

01:15:36.240 --> 01:15:38.240
Just you.

01:15:38.240 --> 01:15:40.240
That's funny.

01:15:42.240 --> 01:15:44.240
I mean you can still just piss in the toilet.

01:15:44.240 --> 01:15:46.240
Racism against the infected.

01:15:49.240 --> 01:15:51.240
Delicious hardtack.

01:15:52.240 --> 01:15:54.240
Bit chewy.

01:15:54.240 --> 01:15:56.240
Raises the bugs.

01:15:56.240 --> 01:15:58.240
Is it chicken?

01:15:58.240 --> 01:16:00.240
Yep.

01:16:00.240 --> 01:16:02.240
Or until they get it from smugglers.

01:16:04.240 --> 01:16:06.240
Guess not you guys.

01:16:07.240 --> 01:16:09.240
Ouch.

01:16:11.240 --> 01:16:14.240
Because you are. Because you're 19.

01:16:26.240 --> 01:16:30.240
You know what? This scene is the same as the game as well.

01:16:30.240 --> 01:16:32.240
They're really sticking to it.

01:16:32.240 --> 01:16:34.240
I had the same conversation.

01:16:34.240 --> 01:16:36.240
Yep, the exact same conversation. Same lines.

01:16:43.240 --> 01:16:45.240
That's kind of funny.

01:16:47.240 --> 01:16:49.240
Pick up your sandwich.

01:16:49.240 --> 01:16:51.240
Yeah, eat your fucking chicken sandwich. What's wrong?

01:16:51.240 --> 01:16:53.240
Absolutely not.

01:16:53.240 --> 01:16:56.240
Okay, Jesus, fine. I'll just have a fucking sandwich out there.

01:16:57.240 --> 01:16:59.240
Let me turn up.

01:17:04.240 --> 01:17:06.240
Jurassic Park theme music.

01:17:08.240 --> 01:17:10.240
Just because it's got overgrown buildings.

01:17:13.240 --> 01:17:15.240
Look, there's even the dinosaurs there.

01:17:15.240 --> 01:17:17.240
That's not dinosaurs. Those are birds.

01:17:17.240 --> 01:17:20.240
Birds, dinosaurs, Kyle. That's what Jurassic Park told me.

01:17:20.240 --> 01:17:23.240
He's like, the word to dinosaurs waxes.

01:17:23.240 --> 01:17:25.240
We should get moving.

01:17:25.240 --> 01:17:27.240
Before the T-Rex finds us.

01:17:27.240 --> 01:17:30.240
And, dude, they have the same leaning tower. It's great.

01:17:30.240 --> 01:17:32.240
They knew what was iconic about the first game.

01:17:32.240 --> 01:17:34.240
And they put it in there.

01:17:35.240 --> 01:17:38.240
So we could do this. So we could basically be like, I member.

01:17:38.240 --> 01:17:41.240
Yep. I'm membering.

01:17:41.240 --> 01:17:44.240
I wonder how much of this is CG and how much of it is like they dressed up a street.

01:17:45.240 --> 01:17:48.240
Well, the crumbly towers, I would have to say, are definitely CG.

01:17:54.240 --> 01:17:56.240
Oh, they're doing the hotel.

01:17:56.240 --> 01:17:59.240
This is CG. You can actually see the hard cuts slightly off in the distance.

01:17:59.240 --> 01:18:01.240
Yeah.

01:18:02.240 --> 01:18:05.240
See, they're going to the hotel and they're just doing the levels of the game.

01:18:05.240 --> 01:18:08.240
It's kind of nice to see them just stick to it.

01:18:14.240 --> 01:18:16.240
Are you there alone?

01:18:17.240 --> 01:18:19.240
Yeah.

01:18:20.240 --> 01:18:22.240
How old are you?

01:18:22.240 --> 01:18:23.240
Fourteen.

01:18:23.240 --> 01:18:25.240
Nineteen.

01:18:25.240 --> 01:18:28.240
Mommy, you got some balls on you, sister.

01:18:29.240 --> 01:18:30.240
Thanks.

01:18:30.240 --> 01:18:33.240
Also, you weren't alone in there, you liar.

01:18:34.240 --> 01:18:36.240
Don't bring up that cringey DLC.

01:18:36.240 --> 01:18:38.240
I played the DLC.

01:18:38.240 --> 01:18:40.240
Nobody's going to be coming after you, right?

01:18:40.240 --> 01:18:43.240
Like mom, dad, boyfriend.

01:18:43.240 --> 01:18:46.240
I'm an orphan and no.

01:18:48.240 --> 01:18:51.240
Because she's a lesbian.

01:18:52.240 --> 01:18:53.240
Did she know that?

01:18:53.240 --> 01:18:56.240
Hey, that DLC was made during current year policy.

01:18:56.240 --> 01:19:01.240
To be fair, she didn't point it out cringily like that one scene in Discovery

01:19:01.240 --> 01:19:05.240
where they force the pronouns in out of nowhere.

01:19:05.240 --> 01:19:06.240
It makes no fucking sense.

01:19:06.240 --> 01:19:08.240
They just use these pronouns to this character.

01:19:08.240 --> 01:19:10.240
It's like, oh, Jesus, why is this in the script?

01:19:10.240 --> 01:19:12.240
She could have made a deal out of it.

01:19:12.240 --> 01:19:14.240
And they're like, no, actually, I'm a lesbian.

01:19:14.240 --> 01:19:16.240
It's my identity.

01:19:16.240 --> 01:19:17.240
And she didn't.

01:19:17.240 --> 01:19:18.240
And I munch rug.

01:19:18.240 --> 01:19:19.240
And she didn't.

01:19:19.240 --> 01:19:21.240
Just let it be.

01:19:23.240 --> 01:19:25.240
That was the mating call of the average Bostonian.

01:19:25.240 --> 01:19:27.240
Wow, food.

01:19:27.240 --> 01:19:28.240
Yeah, man.

01:19:28.240 --> 01:19:29.240
Mm, ducks.

01:19:29.240 --> 01:19:31.240
Put bullets inside of them.

01:19:33.240 --> 01:19:34.240
Oh, look.

01:19:34.240 --> 01:19:35.240
Stop it, frog.

01:19:35.240 --> 01:19:38.240
Pepe is playing a tune.

01:19:39.240 --> 01:19:42.240
I know this, that's pretty cool.

01:19:42.240 --> 01:19:44.240
Yeah, this is the hotel lobby, right?

01:19:44.240 --> 01:19:45.240
Yeah.

01:19:45.240 --> 01:19:50.240
I feel like wandering around in knee-high water with a zombie infection around is a terrible idea.

01:19:50.240 --> 01:19:52.240
But then again, that's just me.

01:19:52.240 --> 01:19:53.240
Yeah.

01:19:53.240 --> 01:19:55.240
You could get a cut, an injury, you could trip.

01:19:55.240 --> 01:20:00.240
Yeah, just in general, wandering around in knee-high, stale water is a bad idea.

01:20:03.240 --> 01:20:04.240
That is plastic.

01:20:04.240 --> 01:20:07.240
And you can see the fucking plastic mold lines.

01:20:07.240 --> 01:20:08.240
Yep.

01:20:08.240 --> 01:20:10.240
Oh, good attempt, I guess.

01:20:10.240 --> 01:20:11.240
Yep.

01:20:11.240 --> 01:20:12.240
And you know what?

01:20:12.240 --> 01:20:16.240
To the story's credit, she's acting a bit more naive this episode.

01:20:16.240 --> 01:20:17.240
Would you want an arch?

01:20:17.240 --> 01:20:21.240
I mean, that was incredibly annoying, the thing she just did, but yeah.

01:20:21.240 --> 01:20:24.240
Well, naivety and annoyingness kind of go together.

01:20:24.240 --> 01:20:27.240
She's pretty much acted like this in the game too, so.

01:20:27.240 --> 01:20:28.240
Yep, yep.

01:20:28.240 --> 01:20:31.240
They're doing just shot for shot, scene for scene, interaction for interaction.

01:20:31.240 --> 01:20:33.240
They're just making the show.

01:20:33.240 --> 01:20:35.240
No excuses, no nonsense.

01:20:35.240 --> 01:20:36.240
No, we can't do this.

01:20:36.240 --> 01:20:39.240
No, there's not enough content in the original lore.

01:20:39.240 --> 01:20:40.240
They're just doing it.

01:20:40.240 --> 01:20:42.240
I'm very impressed.

01:20:45.240 --> 01:20:47.240
Just shoulder the doors in, man, it's okay.

01:20:47.240 --> 01:20:48.240
Right, well.

01:20:48.240 --> 01:20:50.240
It's like 56.

01:20:50.240 --> 01:20:52.240
You fucking shoulder the door in.

01:20:52.240 --> 01:20:58.240
They do have high-powered fucking rifles, so, you know, opening the door wouldn't actually be a problem.

01:20:58.240 --> 01:21:02.240
Yeah, a locked door in an abandoned post-apocalyptic building is not that big of a deal.

01:21:02.240 --> 01:21:05.240
Well, you don't want to waste ammunition.

01:21:05.240 --> 01:21:08.240
You also don't want to make the lock noises.

01:21:08.240 --> 01:21:11.240
Also, Mythbusters did...

01:21:14.240 --> 01:21:17.240
You can actually shoot locks off with them.

01:21:17.240 --> 01:21:18.240
Oh, you can't?

01:21:18.240 --> 01:21:19.240
Yeah.

01:21:19.240 --> 01:21:21.240
Oh, you absolutely can.

01:21:21.240 --> 01:21:22.240
You just need to know where the lock is.

01:21:22.240 --> 01:21:26.240
You don't shoot the lock, you shoot the locking pin.

01:21:26.240 --> 01:21:31.240
You know, the whole Ellie with the switchblade thing was actually a game mechanic,

01:21:31.240 --> 01:21:34.240
because the shivs you could craft were like insta-kill for zombies.

01:21:34.240 --> 01:21:38.240
Whenever you played as Ellie, she had a knife that could just insta-kill constantly to make it easier.

01:21:38.240 --> 01:21:41.240
I actually like this more...

01:21:43.240 --> 01:21:45.240
...sympathetic Joe.

01:21:45.240 --> 01:21:46.240
Or Joe.

01:21:46.240 --> 01:21:47.240
Joel.

01:21:47.240 --> 01:21:48.240
Joel, you got it right.

01:21:48.240 --> 01:21:49.240
Whatever the hell he is.

01:21:49.240 --> 01:21:52.240
Because he's not just a killing machine, he's just a human now.

01:21:52.240 --> 01:21:54.240
Well, yeah, he's on a video game.

01:21:54.240 --> 01:21:57.240
Video games, you gotta have action sequences or...

01:21:57.240 --> 01:21:58.240
Big game boring.

01:21:58.240 --> 01:22:01.240
Where you stealth kill 30 soldiers.

01:22:02.240 --> 01:22:03.240
That was always funny.

01:22:03.240 --> 01:22:07.240
Wow, the dye in those pillows have survived remarkably well.

01:22:07.240 --> 01:22:08.240
Hold on, hold on.

01:22:08.240 --> 01:22:13.240
They've completely remade that one scene.

01:22:13.240 --> 01:22:14.240
Do you recognize this, Kibbs?

01:22:14.240 --> 01:22:16.240
Yes, I do.

01:22:16.240 --> 01:22:18.240
Yeah, it's the first encounter with a clicker.

01:22:18.240 --> 01:22:20.240
They remade the set.

01:22:20.240 --> 01:22:23.240
Like, talk about attention to detail.

01:22:23.240 --> 01:22:26.240
Oh, that's a good one.

01:22:26.240 --> 01:22:28.240
It's pretty much just like from the game.

01:22:28.240 --> 01:22:29.240
Yep.

01:22:31.240 --> 01:22:32.240
Well, that's disgusting.

01:22:32.240 --> 01:22:34.240
Why are they doing that?

01:22:34.240 --> 01:22:36.240
Zombie orgy, baby.

01:22:51.240 --> 01:22:53.240
Oh, they're back in the sun.

01:22:53.240 --> 01:22:54.240
Yeah.

01:23:03.240 --> 01:23:07.240
I don't remember dead, though.

01:23:07.240 --> 01:23:09.240
The underground fiber optic.

01:23:09.240 --> 01:23:10.240
Yep.

01:23:10.240 --> 01:23:12.240
We're doing the fucking Avatar thing.

01:23:12.240 --> 01:23:14.240
Because fungi are intelligent now.

01:23:14.240 --> 01:23:17.240
I'm pretty sure we've seen like underground corsets and stuff.

01:23:17.240 --> 01:23:18.240
No.

01:23:18.240 --> 01:23:20.240
We have, but not to the way she just described it.

01:23:20.240 --> 01:23:21.240
That was different.

01:23:21.240 --> 01:23:22.240
Yeah, it doesn't work like that.

01:23:22.240 --> 01:23:25.240
The Sebi, like hive mind stuff, that's new.

01:23:25.240 --> 01:23:28.240
Oh, it's the zombies that are communists.

01:23:29.240 --> 01:23:32.240
They're all collectivized.

01:23:32.240 --> 01:23:35.240
Well, you're saying this shell is actually based.

01:23:35.240 --> 01:23:39.240
Okay, you just said that if you touch some of the cordyceps,

01:23:39.240 --> 01:23:41.240
everyone around knows, right?

01:23:41.240 --> 01:23:42.240
Are you going to go into this really?

01:23:42.240 --> 01:23:44.240
Don't touch it, dude.

01:23:44.240 --> 01:23:46.240
Dry and dead, I guess.

01:23:46.240 --> 01:23:49.240
It's still weird that they're near it.

01:23:49.240 --> 01:23:50.240
Yeah.

01:23:50.240 --> 01:23:52.240
Without masks.

01:23:53.240 --> 01:23:57.240
I guess this is their way to try and replicate the feel

01:23:57.240 --> 01:24:01.240
of unease of entering a bungled environment

01:24:01.240 --> 01:24:03.240
without having the breathable spores.

01:24:03.240 --> 01:24:04.240
Yeah.

01:24:04.240 --> 01:24:05.240
I guess.

01:24:05.240 --> 01:24:06.240
Yeah.

01:24:08.240 --> 01:24:10.240
Again, I don't see, no, no,

01:24:10.240 --> 01:24:12.240
I do see the point of why they did remove the mask.

01:24:12.240 --> 01:24:16.240
It's because Pablo Escobar there needs to be visualized.

01:24:16.240 --> 01:24:17.240
Yep.

01:24:17.240 --> 01:24:18.240
Congratulations.

01:24:18.240 --> 01:24:20.240
That's why we have the unnecessary flashbacks

01:24:20.240 --> 01:24:23.240
that add really nothing, but just exposition.

01:24:23.240 --> 01:24:26.240
You know, at least the environments look good again.

01:24:26.240 --> 01:24:27.240
Yeah.

01:24:27.240 --> 01:24:30.240
Covered in the fungus, it looks like it's infected.

01:24:30.240 --> 01:24:32.240
It's weird without the masks and, you know,

01:24:32.240 --> 01:24:34.240
having to worry about that.

01:24:34.240 --> 01:24:35.240
The Boston Tea Party,

01:24:35.240 --> 01:24:37.240
where a bunch of Americans dressed up in blackface

01:24:37.240 --> 01:24:39.240
and threw British tea overboard.

01:24:39.240 --> 01:24:41.240
They're pretty based.

01:24:45.240 --> 01:24:47.240
Yeah, clickers.

01:24:51.240 --> 01:24:54.240
I've been attacked by one and it wasn't like that.

01:24:56.240 --> 01:25:00.240
Okay, from this point forward, we are silent,

01:25:00.240 --> 01:25:04.240
not quiet, silent, well, no question.

01:25:04.240 --> 01:25:06.240
You're still whispering, though.

01:25:06.240 --> 01:25:07.240
Ah, yes.

01:25:07.240 --> 01:25:08.240
Old wooden stairs.

01:25:08.240 --> 01:25:11.240
The quietest approach ever.

01:25:11.240 --> 01:25:12.240
Well, what do you want?

01:25:12.240 --> 01:25:14.240
You want them to fly up there?

01:25:14.240 --> 01:25:15.240
True.

01:25:15.240 --> 01:25:18.240
They don't have much of a choice, but...

01:25:18.240 --> 01:25:20.240
It's like he kind of undivides this whole thing.

01:25:20.240 --> 01:25:22.240
Like, we're gonna be quiet, not here, not...

01:25:22.240 --> 01:25:24.240
Hmm, cannons.

01:25:25.240 --> 01:25:28.240
And this is where you unlock the shotgun.

01:25:33.240 --> 01:25:35.240
From Fallout 4.

01:25:37.240 --> 01:25:39.240
You know, houses don't behave like that.

01:25:39.240 --> 01:25:41.240
They don't just randomly go,

01:25:41.240 --> 01:25:43.240
eh, I'm gonna collapse now.

01:25:43.240 --> 01:25:45.240
Yeah, it's like a slow process.

01:25:46.240 --> 01:25:48.240
Oh, there it is.

01:25:48.240 --> 01:25:50.240
Oh, my God, what was that?

01:25:50.240 --> 01:25:51.240
It was data.

01:25:51.240 --> 01:25:53.240
A zombie.

01:25:53.240 --> 01:25:55.240
Yup, there's the clickies.

01:25:55.240 --> 01:25:56.240
Yep.

01:25:56.240 --> 01:25:59.240
The reason they click is because they use echolocation,

01:25:59.240 --> 01:26:01.240
because they can't see.

01:26:01.240 --> 01:26:04.240
No, that's not the case, Dev.

01:26:04.240 --> 01:26:06.240
That's not how echolocation works.

01:26:06.240 --> 01:26:09.240
Yeah, but that's how it works in the game.

01:26:09.240 --> 01:26:10.240
And also...

01:26:10.240 --> 01:26:12.240
That's not how this works.

01:26:12.240 --> 01:26:13.240
And the reason they can't see

01:26:13.240 --> 01:26:16.240
is because they're really sensitive to light now.

01:26:16.240 --> 01:26:19.240
After they've been affected for this long.

01:26:19.240 --> 01:26:21.240
Yep, their face is just a big mushroom now.

01:26:21.240 --> 01:26:23.240
Are they immune to bullets?

01:26:23.240 --> 01:26:25.240
Nope.

01:26:25.240 --> 01:26:27.240
It takes a lot of them.

01:26:27.240 --> 01:26:30.240
Remember, shooting a gun in a city filled with zamboos.

01:26:30.240 --> 01:26:34.240
Also, if you're fighting an echolocative enemy,

01:26:34.240 --> 01:26:36.240
you don't want to be shooting.

01:26:36.240 --> 01:26:37.240
Actually, you do.

01:26:37.240 --> 01:26:39.240
Do you? Why?

01:26:39.240 --> 01:26:42.240
Because it'll blow out their fucking ears.

01:26:42.240 --> 01:26:44.240
No, no, not really.

01:26:44.240 --> 01:26:45.240
No, they will.

01:26:45.240 --> 01:26:47.240
Why do you think sonar stops working

01:26:47.240 --> 01:26:50.240
when there's like death charges nearby?

01:26:50.240 --> 01:26:51.240
Oh, fair enough, eh?

01:26:51.240 --> 01:26:54.240
I mean, in the game, if you shoot, they all just charge you.

01:26:54.240 --> 01:26:55.240
So...

01:27:02.240 --> 01:27:04.240
Watch where you're running, man.

01:27:04.240 --> 01:27:06.240
It's like those enemies in Resident Evil

01:27:06.240 --> 01:27:09.240
where you got to hit gongs to make them run around.

01:27:09.240 --> 01:27:10.240
Oh god, I remember this.

01:27:10.240 --> 01:27:13.240
Zoom in so that you can't see the zombie getting closer.

01:27:13.240 --> 01:27:15.240
That way, when the zombie suddenly appears,

01:27:15.240 --> 01:27:18.240
Kyle will be frightened and scream like a woman.

01:27:18.240 --> 01:27:20.240
Here we go.

01:27:20.240 --> 01:27:21.240
Hi.

01:27:24.240 --> 01:27:26.240
Eh, less of a jump scare than I expected.

01:27:26.240 --> 01:27:27.240
I actually kind of appreciate the fact

01:27:27.240 --> 01:27:29.240
they're trying to build the atmosphere

01:27:29.240 --> 01:27:31.240
instead of simply just a boop.

01:27:31.240 --> 01:27:33.240
Luckily, the ancient wooden floor

01:27:33.240 --> 01:27:35.240
has stopped creaking at this point.

01:27:35.240 --> 01:27:37.240
The topic of Kyle being a woman,

01:27:37.240 --> 01:27:40.240
why do you keep drawing yourself with boobs

01:27:40.240 --> 01:27:43.240
and pregnant and womb tattoos?

01:27:43.240 --> 01:27:44.240
Kibs, you've got to tell us something.

01:27:44.240 --> 01:27:46.240
What's going on here?

01:27:46.240 --> 01:27:47.240
It's not my fault.

01:27:47.240 --> 01:27:49.240
I can't control the artists.

01:27:50.240 --> 01:27:52.240
The fan art of you being a girl?

01:27:52.240 --> 01:27:54.240
It's out of control.

01:27:54.240 --> 01:27:55.240
Oh.

01:27:58.240 --> 01:28:00.240
I'm going to kill a sperm zombie.

01:28:02.240 --> 01:28:05.240
I feel like the gut shots aren't really working, my dude.

01:28:05.240 --> 01:28:07.240
There you go.

01:28:07.240 --> 01:28:08.240
There we go.

01:28:08.240 --> 01:28:13.240
You've got to blow off the giant mushroom on their heads.

01:28:16.240 --> 01:28:18.240
And there you go.

01:28:18.240 --> 01:28:20.240
It seems like head shots do just fine,

01:28:20.240 --> 01:28:21.240
so it seems like the best way to deal with them

01:28:21.240 --> 01:28:22.240
is to walk up to one,

01:28:22.240 --> 01:28:26.240
rest the .357 against their heads, and boom.

01:28:26.240 --> 01:28:29.240
Well, they're lucky that there's only two.

01:28:29.240 --> 01:28:31.240
Yeah, when there's a lot of them, you're kind of fucked.

01:28:31.240 --> 01:28:33.240
Are you fucking kidding me?

01:28:35.240 --> 01:28:38.240
And again, I mean, if it was going to happen to one of us.

01:28:40.240 --> 01:28:41.240
It's fair.

01:28:41.240 --> 01:28:42.240
Yeah.

01:28:42.240 --> 01:28:45.240
So do these zombies react to noise?

01:28:45.240 --> 01:28:46.240
Is that it is?

01:28:46.240 --> 01:28:47.240
Because.

01:28:47.240 --> 01:28:48.240
Yep.

01:28:48.240 --> 01:28:49.240
I do.

01:28:49.240 --> 01:28:50.240
I don't seem to.

01:28:50.240 --> 01:28:51.240
In the game, you can like.

01:28:51.240 --> 01:28:52.240
You can use noises.

01:28:52.240 --> 01:28:53.240
Yeah.

01:28:53.240 --> 01:28:54.240
No, it looks scary.

01:28:54.240 --> 01:28:56.240
That was scary.

01:28:56.240 --> 01:28:57.240
This is wood.

01:28:59.240 --> 01:29:00.240
OK, child.

01:29:00.240 --> 01:29:01.240
Just wait there.

01:29:01.240 --> 01:29:02.240
You're falling.

01:29:02.240 --> 01:29:03.240
Give us a minute.

01:29:03.240 --> 01:29:04.240
Let's go.

01:29:04.240 --> 01:29:05.240
Go watch it.

01:29:10.240 --> 01:29:12.240
Pedro thinks you're being a bit fucking snappy.

01:29:15.240 --> 01:29:17.240
This is actually the way it was in the game, too.

01:29:17.240 --> 01:29:21.240
She was in charge and he was kind of being ordered around

01:29:21.240 --> 01:29:23.240
and was kind of a big old grump about everything.

01:29:27.240 --> 01:29:28.240
Hey, Collin.

01:29:28.240 --> 01:29:29.240
Yep.

01:29:29.240 --> 01:29:33.240
OK, is this where the trip wires start coming in?

01:29:33.240 --> 01:29:36.240
Well, I can't remember.

01:29:36.240 --> 01:29:39.240
Lilith, how about you?

01:29:39.240 --> 01:29:41.240
Because, like, this looks like a level from the game,

01:29:41.240 --> 01:29:43.240
Kibbs and Lilith, if you remember.

01:29:43.240 --> 01:29:44.240
This is.

01:29:44.240 --> 01:29:45.240
Yeah.

01:29:45.240 --> 01:29:48.240
There was a trip wire between the front of the truck

01:29:48.240 --> 01:29:50.240
and the car in the background.

01:29:50.240 --> 01:29:54.240
They positioned it like exactly like the level was.

01:29:54.240 --> 01:29:57.240
There's such incredible attention to detail.

01:29:57.240 --> 01:29:59.240
Probably almost too much, you know.

01:30:03.240 --> 01:30:04.240
Not enough.

01:30:04.240 --> 01:30:05.240
Halo.

01:30:05.240 --> 01:30:06.240
Yeah, fuck.

01:30:06.240 --> 01:30:07.240
Or like Kenobi or whatever.

01:30:07.240 --> 01:30:08.240
Fuck.

01:30:08.240 --> 01:30:09.240
Holy shit.

01:30:09.240 --> 01:30:12.240
So many bad shows and movies out there.

01:30:16.240 --> 01:30:17.240
Oh, hey, look.

01:30:17.240 --> 01:30:18.240
There's a shotgun.

01:30:18.240 --> 01:30:20.240
He can unlock it now.

01:30:20.240 --> 01:30:22.240
That's something, right?

01:30:22.240 --> 01:30:25.240
Our luck had to run out sooner or later.

01:30:25.240 --> 01:30:27.240
All right, here we go.

01:30:27.240 --> 01:30:29.240
Fuck.

01:30:29.240 --> 01:30:30.240
He's infected.

01:30:30.240 --> 01:30:31.240
Oh, fuck.

01:30:35.240 --> 01:30:36.240
He's sleeping now.

01:30:47.240 --> 01:30:48.240
Yeah, it's moving.

01:30:48.240 --> 01:30:51.240
They all know, baby.

01:30:51.240 --> 01:30:52.240
This is new, by the way.

01:30:52.240 --> 01:30:53.240
This is new.

01:30:53.240 --> 01:30:56.240
Yes, this is new.

01:30:56.240 --> 01:30:58.240
So, gunshots, no big deal.

01:30:58.240 --> 01:31:01.240
But the Myconial Network?

01:31:01.240 --> 01:31:03.240
Well.

01:31:03.240 --> 01:31:07.240
Yeah, I'm not sure I feel less than that.

01:31:07.240 --> 01:31:11.240
Well, I think in the game, like, it's soldiers that chase them.

01:31:11.240 --> 01:31:13.240
Yeah, soldiers show up here, yeah.

01:31:13.240 --> 01:31:16.240
And you have to fight off a bunch of human enemies.

01:31:17.240 --> 01:31:19.240
Now it's zombies.

01:31:19.240 --> 01:31:21.240
Because Federer does show up.

01:31:21.240 --> 01:31:22.240
Yeah.

01:31:22.240 --> 01:31:23.240
All of them.

01:31:23.240 --> 01:31:24.240
Maybe a minute.

01:31:24.240 --> 01:31:30.240
Interestingly, they seem to be going more for the idea of the main characters being human.

01:31:30.240 --> 01:31:33.240
Like, they're not vilifying Federer.

01:31:33.240 --> 01:31:34.240
Yeah.

01:31:37.240 --> 01:31:38.240
What are you doing?

01:31:38.240 --> 01:31:40.240
Making sure that they don't follow you.

01:31:40.240 --> 01:31:43.240
I mean, even in the game, Federer wasn't, quote, unquote, evil.

01:31:43.240 --> 01:31:45.240
They were doing what they had to do to survive.

01:31:45.240 --> 01:31:47.240
Yeah, you were killing them by the dozen, I bet.

01:31:47.240 --> 01:31:48.240
You were.

01:31:48.240 --> 01:31:49.240
You were.

01:31:49.240 --> 01:31:51.240
I mean, they were also pretty...

01:31:51.240 --> 01:31:54.240
They were sometimes a bit too far.

01:31:54.240 --> 01:31:58.240
They still, like, indiscriminately, you know, hung people in the town square.

01:31:58.240 --> 01:32:00.240
Say who you can say.

01:32:00.240 --> 01:32:01.240
Well, criminals.

01:32:01.240 --> 01:32:03.240
But we didn't know.

01:32:03.240 --> 01:32:05.240
Yeah, communist dev criminals.

01:32:05.240 --> 01:32:08.240
Yeah, they were military court, you know.

01:32:08.240 --> 01:32:09.240
Pretty fair and balanced.

01:32:09.240 --> 01:32:11.240
Yeah.

01:32:11.240 --> 01:32:13.240
Dev's like, I don't believe this.

01:32:13.240 --> 01:32:17.240
Oh, okay, that's different.

01:32:17.240 --> 01:32:18.240
Yeah, this isn't...

01:32:18.240 --> 01:32:20.240
Didn't she just kill herself, if I remember right?

01:32:20.240 --> 01:32:21.240
Yeah, she shot herself.

01:32:21.240 --> 01:32:23.240
There was no, like, heroic standoff.

01:32:23.240 --> 01:32:25.240
No, she fought off the soldiers, and then...

01:32:25.240 --> 01:32:26.240
Oh, that's right, yeah, yeah.

01:32:26.240 --> 01:32:31.240
She killed, I believe, two, and then she got killed by the soldiers afterwards.

01:32:31.240 --> 01:32:33.240
Right, right, right.

01:32:33.240 --> 01:32:40.240
As the player, you actually get a chance to ambush the soldiers afterwards and get revenge for the test.

01:32:40.240 --> 01:32:42.240
Or you could just run away.

01:32:43.240 --> 01:32:46.240
Alright, you better do it.

01:32:50.240 --> 01:32:52.240
Oh, come on.

01:32:57.240 --> 01:32:59.240
You gotta do it now, dude.

01:33:01.240 --> 01:33:05.240
Don't worry, a lighter isn't hot enough to touch off that shield anyways.

01:33:05.240 --> 01:33:07.240
It's not?

01:33:07.240 --> 01:33:09.240
Nope.

01:33:13.240 --> 01:33:15.240
Oh.

01:33:17.240 --> 01:33:20.240
Well, TV show. You don't need to do that.

01:33:20.240 --> 01:33:21.240
Oh, okay, thank you.

01:33:21.240 --> 01:33:23.240
Oh, that's a bit fucking weird.

01:33:23.240 --> 01:33:25.240
Yeah, thanks.

01:33:29.240 --> 01:33:32.240
Somebody's masturbating right now, I swear to God.

01:33:32.240 --> 01:33:34.240
Somebody somewhere.

01:33:36.240 --> 01:33:38.240
That's a bit gross.

01:33:38.240 --> 01:33:42.240
Also, that's not how a hand-degrainer's cook off either, but never mind, details, details.

01:33:42.240 --> 01:33:44.240
But yeah, a lot of that scene was the same.

01:33:44.240 --> 01:33:47.240
Like, her revealing that she had been bit, the whole thing.

01:33:47.240 --> 01:33:49.240
No, definitely.

01:33:49.240 --> 01:33:53.240
The whole sacrifice and the weir of kissing.

01:33:53.240 --> 01:33:57.240
The end was different, but most of the scene was the same.

01:34:08.240 --> 01:34:23.240
Wow, so there we go.

01:34:23.240 --> 01:34:26.240
Episodes one and two down the hatch.

01:34:26.240 --> 01:34:29.240
I'm stunned at how good it was.

01:34:29.240 --> 01:34:32.240
I was expecting complete and total nonsense.

01:34:32.240 --> 01:34:34.240
No, that was actually pretty good.

01:34:34.240 --> 01:34:37.240
The changes that they made, well, some were a bit strange.

01:34:37.240 --> 01:34:41.240
I think the kiss was probably requested by the actress.

01:34:41.240 --> 01:34:45.240
She probably wanted to go out in a weird but memorable way.

01:34:45.240 --> 01:34:48.240
Yeah, maybe not the kiss itself, but the actual...

01:34:48.240 --> 01:34:50.240
Maybe, I don't know.

01:34:50.240 --> 01:34:53.240
The actual sacrificing yourself to stop the zombie horde thing.

01:34:53.240 --> 01:35:02.240
And again, I actually quite appreciate the fact that they're making the characters not psychotic murder hobos, as they were in the game.

01:35:02.240 --> 01:35:03.240
Yes.

01:35:03.240 --> 01:35:05.240
That's actually a good change.

01:35:05.240 --> 01:35:10.240
I'm not that wowed by the show itself, like the whole pacing, etc.

01:35:10.240 --> 01:35:12.240
It's kind of slow, it's kind of meh.

01:35:12.240 --> 01:35:16.240
I'm frankly not that invested in this supposed child.

01:35:16.240 --> 01:35:24.240
But the simple fact that it's not awful is already much...

01:35:24.240 --> 01:35:32.240
See, for me, one, it's the fact that they actually are following the game as much as they are, which is a miracle in this day and age.

01:35:32.240 --> 01:35:40.240
But as you say, for the show itself, Ellie's not nearly as interesting as she was in the game, but Joel is still pretty interesting.

01:35:40.240 --> 01:35:42.240
Joel is about as interesting as he was.

01:35:42.240 --> 01:35:51.240
It's going to be interesting to see how they go forward, because the thing that's going to make or break the show is the interaction between Joel and Ellie is the same way as it was in the video game.

01:35:51.240 --> 01:35:56.240
Because it was their interactions that sold the game.

01:35:56.240 --> 01:36:00.240
Yeah, the entire premise of the game was based on their relationship.

01:36:00.240 --> 01:36:04.240
And if they don't do that right, then there is no Last of Us.

01:36:04.240 --> 01:36:09.240
Still, I'm surprised. I mean, I expected to only be watching bad stuff on this channel, you know?

01:36:09.240 --> 01:36:13.240
And here we are, watching at least an okay to decent show.

01:36:13.240 --> 01:36:17.240
I'm okay with that. We don't always have to be hit watching Trainwreck.

01:36:17.240 --> 01:36:21.240
I mean, we're not watching a shitty Velma show, at least.

01:36:21.240 --> 01:36:27.240
Hold on. We should start Velma. We should change gears and switch over to Velma instead.

01:36:27.240 --> 01:36:32.240
The show's been shitty enough, we must torture ourselves.

01:36:32.240 --> 01:36:39.240
Naomi is like, Dev, do you want to watch Velma with me? And I'm like, listen, there's no good answer to this question.

01:36:39.240 --> 01:36:43.240
Because either I'm watching Velma or you think I don't want to spend time with you.

01:36:43.240 --> 01:36:51.240
Don't worry. Just the first episode. I think she'll change her mind.

01:36:51.240 --> 01:36:53.240
Well, final thoughts then, everyone?

01:36:53.240 --> 01:37:00.240
I think it's pretty good. I mean, they changed some stuff from the game, obviously, but nobody expected a one-to-one recreation.

01:37:00.240 --> 01:37:04.240
But what they did recreate was actually fairly faithful.

01:37:04.240 --> 01:37:13.240
They created the major sceneries, the major vistas, and the major plot points, for the most part.

01:37:13.240 --> 01:37:19.240
Of course, with some changes, which just makes things a little bit more interesting.

01:37:19.240 --> 01:37:28.240
I find it very interesting that they changed the dates to make it before without explicitly stating it.

01:37:28.240 --> 01:37:35.240
Or saying it to your face, like, this is what we're doing, and this is 2013, guys.

01:37:35.240 --> 01:37:42.240
Oh, this is what would happen if something happened 10 years ago. I don't know how much that would change.

01:37:42.240 --> 01:37:45.240
Yeah, I'm not sure why they did that. I'm not sure why they did that.

01:37:45.240 --> 01:37:50.240
In the original game, the past was set in 2013, because 2013 was the year the game came out.

01:37:50.240 --> 01:37:57.240
And then the present was 2033. And now, the past is 2003, and the present is 2023, which is our current year.

01:37:57.240 --> 01:38:01.240
So I guess they wanted to make it relatable somehow, either way.

01:38:01.240 --> 01:38:04.240
But I'm not sure why they made that change.

01:38:04.240 --> 01:38:07.240
It doesn't really change that much.

01:38:07.240 --> 01:38:12.240
It was fairly faithful to the video game. There are some weird, unnecessary changes.

01:38:12.240 --> 01:38:18.240
Like, if they just didn't do the fungal retcon thing, I think the show would be a little better,

01:38:18.240 --> 01:38:21.240
because it would be more faithful to the original source material.

01:38:21.240 --> 01:38:27.240
I think Arch is correct. I think that the whole reason for the change was down to the actor not wanting to have his face covered up.

01:38:27.240 --> 01:38:34.240
But again, I still have to beg the question, like, the gas masks that Joel wear, you could just use a different one where you can see their face.

01:38:35.240 --> 01:38:37.240
It's not that big of a deal.

01:38:37.240 --> 01:38:42.240
I also don't think Joel wears the gas masks throughout the entire game anyways.

01:38:42.240 --> 01:38:44.240
Only parts of it. In parts of it, yeah.

01:38:44.240 --> 01:38:47.240
But it's only, it's very small sections in the game.

01:38:47.240 --> 01:38:52.240
He does when, like, their room is, like, fumigated with the spores.

01:38:52.240 --> 01:38:53.240
Yeah, yeah.

01:38:53.240 --> 01:38:58.240
He does a couple points in the game, and that's, honestly, I think that's the thing that bugs me the most,

01:38:58.240 --> 01:39:02.240
is because, like, it's such a little thing, it's like, you know, he could have just worn the mask,

01:39:02.240 --> 01:39:07.240
and those sections were short, and in this show, they skip most of those combat sequences anyways,

01:39:07.240 --> 01:39:12.240
and so those gas mask, quote-unquote, sections would have been incredibly short.

01:39:13.240 --> 01:39:14.240
Yeah.

01:39:14.240 --> 01:39:25.240
Oh, yeah. In, like, the game itself, there was even a section where they find, like, a smuggler with his mask broken,

01:39:25.240 --> 01:39:29.240
and you have to either put him out of his misery or leave him to suffer.

01:39:29.240 --> 01:39:31.240
Yep, that was a cool moral laundry.

01:39:31.240 --> 01:39:32.240
Yeah.

01:39:32.240 --> 01:39:35.240
Oh, you're right, Lilith, I completely forgot about that sequence.

01:39:35.240 --> 01:39:37.240
That wasn't even in the game. Or in the show.

01:39:37.240 --> 01:39:38.240
Yeah, in the show, yeah.

01:39:38.240 --> 01:39:44.240
That was, I think, like, the reason why they didn't do it in a show is because, like,

01:39:44.240 --> 01:39:50.240
oh, then the audience is gonna question why aren't they wearing masks or in sections where they should be.

01:39:50.240 --> 01:39:56.240
It might have to do with the fact that masks right now are also a delicate social thing, because...

01:39:56.240 --> 01:39:58.240
I don't think that's it.

01:39:58.240 --> 01:39:59.240
No?

01:39:59.240 --> 01:40:01.240
I can actually enlarge the argument for this.

01:40:01.240 --> 01:40:04.240
These aren't little masks. These are, like, gas masks.

01:40:04.240 --> 01:40:06.240
Yeah, yeah, yeah, but masks are masked.

01:40:06.240 --> 01:40:09.240
I don't think that was the reason at all.

01:40:09.240 --> 01:40:11.240
Well, let's see Arch's logic, though. Let's see Arch's logic.

01:40:11.240 --> 01:40:19.240
The show so far has been studiously inoffensive to our point of view.

01:40:19.240 --> 01:40:24.240
In fact, it's been studiously inoffensive to any point of view. It's simply been a retelling.

01:40:24.240 --> 01:40:25.240
Yep.

01:40:25.240 --> 01:40:30.240
That makes me think, they seem to be going out of their way to do this,

01:40:30.240 --> 01:40:35.240
and if the objective is to create good television that people want to watch,

01:40:35.240 --> 01:40:39.240
that avoids all of the current eardrama, et cetera,

01:40:39.240 --> 01:40:45.240
they probably would want to avoid the mask thing too, just even the inference or suggestion of it,

01:40:45.240 --> 01:40:47.240
because that was a big deal.

01:40:47.240 --> 01:40:51.240
I feel like leaving it out raises more questions.

01:40:51.240 --> 01:40:53.240
Exactly, though, but that's the thing.

01:40:53.240 --> 01:40:56.240
Leaving it out raises more questions for the law.

01:40:56.240 --> 01:41:01.240
The only reason to remove it is either, a, Pedro Pascal and his ego is a word like,

01:41:01.240 --> 01:41:05.240
well, I have to wear a mask for, like, five minutes in two hours of TV show,

01:41:05.240 --> 01:41:10.240
which, I can see it, but I'm also like, that's weird.

01:41:10.240 --> 01:41:14.240
Removing the masks is still a bad thing.

01:41:14.240 --> 01:41:17.240
Because they had to work in two scenes,

01:41:17.240 --> 01:41:20.240
one mask of exposition dump at the beginning that was completely unnecessary,

01:41:20.240 --> 01:41:26.240
and then an entire flashback sequence to characters that don't matter in Jakarta,

01:41:26.240 --> 01:41:29.240
to just simply explain the whole fungal thing again.

01:41:29.240 --> 01:41:33.240
And these scenes were disjointed, they weren't necessary,

01:41:33.240 --> 01:41:36.240
and they were there to try to justify the reason for its existence.

01:41:36.240 --> 01:41:39.240
And in the show, before the show went live,

01:41:39.240 --> 01:41:41.240
the writers and the runners actually talked about,

01:41:41.240 --> 01:41:44.240
oh, the audience, we're doing things this differently,

01:41:44.240 --> 01:41:47.240
and it's going to be a big deal, it's going to be really cool.

01:41:47.240 --> 01:41:50.240
And so far, the only payoff has been, there's little tendrils that come out of their mouth,

01:41:50.240 --> 01:41:55.240
and there's like a really gross kiss scene that just was kind of like,

01:41:55.240 --> 01:41:58.240
ooh, that's just gross. I mean, the zombies are supposed to be gross,

01:41:58.240 --> 01:42:03.240
but that was just a completely different field of weird.

01:42:03.240 --> 01:42:08.240
There's one final thing that I think we should touch on real briefly before we end off the night.

01:42:08.240 --> 01:42:13.240
Usually, when we talk about a show on my channel or your channel or someone else,

01:42:13.240 --> 01:42:18.240
Gundam or Critical Drinker or Mauler or whoever talks about shows in this way,

01:42:18.240 --> 01:42:25.240
I've noticed that a core component of the conversation is the social media backlash,

01:42:25.240 --> 01:42:27.240
because the show is bad, right?

01:42:27.240 --> 01:42:33.240
With Kenobi, it was Riva, with Lord of the Rings, it was the Black Elf,

01:42:33.240 --> 01:42:35.240
but it was really fucking everything, right?

01:42:35.240 --> 01:42:37.240
There's a lot of that shit, and people say,

01:42:37.240 --> 01:42:40.240
well, you just hate the show because you're racist,

01:42:40.240 --> 01:42:43.240
and some people are just racist, and some people,

01:42:43.240 --> 01:42:47.240
they're like, well, why did you have to race swap this character?

01:42:47.240 --> 01:42:52.240
You saw a lot of posts like this, where people were complaining that Joel's daughter

01:42:52.240 --> 01:42:57.240
was changed from a white blonde girl to a half-black girl with frizzy hair.

01:42:57.240 --> 01:43:00.240
Complaint, if we're going to remove the racist aspect of it,

01:43:00.240 --> 01:43:02.240
because I'm sure some of them were just racist,

01:43:02.240 --> 01:43:08.240
but the actual substance of the complaint is that Joel is supposed to be reminded

01:43:08.240 --> 01:43:12.240
of his daughter when he sees Ellie, so they're supposed to look somewhat similar,

01:43:12.240 --> 01:43:17.240
and the two actresses they got in this show look nothing alike.

01:43:17.240 --> 01:43:21.240
It is a pointless change. It does not improve the story in any way.

01:43:21.240 --> 01:43:29.240
It only damages it, but she's only in the show for a little bit and then dies.

01:43:29.240 --> 01:43:30.240
Yes.

01:43:30.240 --> 01:43:32.240
It's not a big deal.

01:43:32.240 --> 01:43:35.240
Meanwhile, Aaron Deere is shoved in your fucking face every five seconds,

01:43:35.240 --> 01:43:40.240
and when the entire show is bad, it is easy to focus on the bad parts of it,

01:43:40.240 --> 01:43:44.240
whereas here, again, he's a race swap daughter, she's there,

01:43:44.240 --> 01:43:47.240
she goes through the motions, then she dies, and it's like, okay, that was it,

01:43:47.240 --> 01:43:50.240
and every other character seems to be okay, so...

01:43:50.240 --> 01:43:54.240
And you know what? She was still a competent actress.

01:43:54.240 --> 01:43:57.240
She still did the job of playing the character very well.

01:43:57.240 --> 01:44:01.240
So far I say she did a better job than Ellie.

01:44:01.240 --> 01:44:04.240
Yeah, she actually did a pretty good job.

01:44:04.240 --> 01:44:13.240
I think my only complaint was that by changing her race to mixed or black,

01:44:13.240 --> 01:44:18.240
they played into the trope of the black character dies first.

01:44:18.240 --> 01:44:20.240
Oh, yeah, that's right, eh? Damn.

01:44:20.240 --> 01:44:21.240
That's true.

01:44:21.240 --> 01:44:26.240
There's also the weird... Okay, so watermelon in the fucking freezer.

01:44:26.240 --> 01:44:30.240
He steals 20 bucks to fix his watch.

01:44:30.240 --> 01:44:31.240
Wow.

01:44:31.240 --> 01:44:35.240
Yeah, in the original game, there was no watermelon in the fridge,

01:44:35.240 --> 01:44:41.240
and she saved up her money to fix the watch, and that was the gift.

01:44:41.240 --> 01:44:42.240
It's...

01:44:42.240 --> 01:44:44.240
That was a strange show.

01:44:44.240 --> 01:44:46.240
Weird choices.

01:44:46.240 --> 01:44:47.240
Yeah.

01:44:47.240 --> 01:44:53.240
Let's make the one character we race swapped into a watermelon-eating thief.

01:44:53.240 --> 01:44:55.240
Hmm.

01:44:55.240 --> 01:44:56.240
I mean...

01:44:56.240 --> 01:44:58.240
That's a bit strange.

01:44:59.240 --> 01:45:03.240
It's most likely that the set dressers didn't even notice it.

01:45:03.240 --> 01:45:07.240
Your racist spider senses are not as advanced as mine.

01:45:07.240 --> 01:45:08.240
Yeah.

01:45:08.240 --> 01:45:09.240
Maybe.

01:45:09.240 --> 01:45:11.240
And I think the set dressers would have noticed it,

01:45:11.240 --> 01:45:17.240
because who puts a full quarter watermelon slice just in the fridge?

01:45:17.240 --> 01:45:19.240
You know what the worst part is?

01:45:19.240 --> 01:45:21.240
I went back to the watermelon slice picture.

01:45:21.240 --> 01:45:22.240
Yeah?

01:45:22.240 --> 01:45:25.240
It's got fucking freezer burns on it.

01:45:25.240 --> 01:45:28.240
It's been in there for years as they wait to do the shot.

01:45:28.240 --> 01:45:34.240
Somebody requisitioned that thing ages in advance and had to put it in there.

01:45:34.240 --> 01:45:36.240
You know what they're doing?

01:45:36.240 --> 01:45:40.240
There was leftover chicken in there that his brother ate, was eating out of.

01:45:40.240 --> 01:45:41.240
He has wings, yeah.

01:45:41.240 --> 01:45:46.240
So it's entirely possible that they were trying to make it look like it's cozy,

01:45:46.240 --> 01:45:50.240
or not cozy, but a little bit slobby in terms of the stuff that's there.

01:45:50.240 --> 01:45:53.240
Because isn't Joel, if I remember right, he doesn't have...

01:45:53.240 --> 01:45:56.240
His wife isn't with him anymore, or is dead.

01:45:56.240 --> 01:45:57.240
Ah, no.

01:45:57.240 --> 01:46:00.240
His wife left him and left the kid behind.

01:46:00.240 --> 01:46:05.240
And so he's kind of a single dad, and so it's giving that single dad vibe.

01:46:05.240 --> 01:46:10.240
A little bit unclean, a little bit rugged.

01:46:10.240 --> 01:46:11.240
Ah, yes.

01:46:11.240 --> 01:46:15.240
Single dads and their fucking random ass watermelons.

01:46:15.240 --> 01:46:16.240
Also, wait, wait.

01:46:16.240 --> 01:46:24.240
In race-swapping Joel's daughter, he must have had sex with a black woman who then abandoned her child.

01:46:24.240 --> 01:46:26.240
That makes that a whole lot worse.

01:46:26.240 --> 01:46:27.240
Jesus!

01:46:27.240 --> 01:46:34.240
Yeah, because in the original lore of the game, Joel's wife walked out on him a year into their relationship,

01:46:34.240 --> 01:46:35.240
and she just kept the kid.

01:46:35.240 --> 01:46:41.240
So if that's the same lore, then she just up and left.

01:46:41.240 --> 01:46:47.240
This is a win. I don't know if they think it's the win they think it is, but it is there.

01:46:47.240 --> 01:46:51.240
Last of Us, turns out, is actually just hyper-based and red-pilled.

01:46:51.240 --> 01:46:53.240
Watches Nick Fuentes every weekend.

01:46:53.240 --> 01:46:55.240
I will say this too, though.

01:46:55.240 --> 01:47:00.240
One thing I also noticed is the fucking stunt people in this show fucking went for it.

01:47:00.240 --> 01:47:04.240
Like the scene where she tries to ambush Joel.

01:47:04.240 --> 01:47:07.240
Pablo fucking chucks that little bitch.

01:47:07.240 --> 01:47:10.240
The wall bulges from the impact.

01:47:10.240 --> 01:47:16.240
And also the zombies that are running and crashing into things and jumping over everything and just falling all over the place, yeah.

01:47:16.240 --> 01:47:20.240
Oh yeah, the actors are putting their entire zombussy into it.

01:47:20.240 --> 01:47:21.240
Zombussy?

01:47:21.240 --> 01:47:22.240
I'm a pussy.

01:47:22.240 --> 01:47:24.240
Yeah.

01:47:24.240 --> 01:47:28.240
It was a surprisingly decent show, which is weird.

01:47:28.240 --> 01:47:30.240
It exists and it isn't complete garbage.

01:47:30.240 --> 01:47:32.240
Yeah, I'm stunned.

01:47:32.240 --> 01:47:35.240
Are we going to keep watching it every week, I guess?

01:47:35.240 --> 01:47:38.240
Well, not that it's good. Is there any point?

01:47:39.240 --> 01:47:40.240
Yeah, I was thinking that too.

01:47:40.240 --> 01:47:42.240
We do gotta switch gears to Velma.

01:47:42.240 --> 01:47:45.240
Well, for fuck's sake, you guys have problems.

01:47:49.240 --> 01:47:52.240
Before it begins, goddammit, Kibbs, fix your mic.

01:47:52.240 --> 01:47:54.240
Fix what?

01:47:54.240 --> 01:47:57.240
Your mic keeps going off, like randomly.

01:47:57.240 --> 01:47:59.240
You can just hear background noises all the time.

01:47:59.240 --> 01:48:00.240
Really?

01:48:00.240 --> 01:48:02.240
Yeah.

01:48:02.240 --> 01:48:04.240
Wow, boomer.

01:48:04.240 --> 01:48:06.240
I'm just gay with that shit.

01:48:06.240 --> 01:48:09.240
You're pulling a Sargon right now.

01:48:09.240 --> 01:48:11.240
Oh Jesus, that's fucking bad.

01:48:11.240 --> 01:48:14.240
No, that's my feelings.

01:48:14.240 --> 01:48:20.240
True, fungi cannot survive if its host's internal temperature is over 94 degrees.

01:48:20.240 --> 01:48:22.240
And apparently there are no reasons for...

01:48:22.240 --> 01:48:25.240
Kibbs, your mic is going crazy again. What happened?

01:48:25.240 --> 01:48:26.240
I...

01:48:26.240 --> 01:48:33.240
Oh God, for some reason I was like, why is there like a mammogram going off in the background?

01:48:33.240 --> 01:48:34.240
Yeah.

01:48:35.240 --> 01:48:38.240
And now he's quiet.

01:48:38.240 --> 01:48:41.240
You're actually very quiet now, Jesus.

01:48:41.240 --> 01:48:43.240
Really? How quiet? How do I do this?

01:48:43.240 --> 01:48:47.240
I've cranked you up to 135 and I can barely hear you.

01:48:53.240 --> 01:48:55.240
Climate change caused it.

01:48:55.240 --> 01:48:58.240
Climate change has caused everything.

01:48:59.240 --> 01:49:03.240
Kibbs, any one of them could become capable of borrowing into our brains and taking control...

01:49:03.240 --> 01:49:05.240
Wait, Kibbs, are you still there?

01:49:08.240 --> 01:49:10.240
Oh my God, dude.

01:49:10.240 --> 01:49:13.240
What the fuck's going on with you today? Because I can barely hear you.

01:49:17.240 --> 01:49:19.240
Is it just me?

01:49:19.240 --> 01:49:21.240
No, he's just boomer.

01:49:23.240 --> 01:49:27.240
It sounds like your volume is at 10%, man.

01:49:28.240 --> 01:49:30.240
I haven't changed anything.

01:49:32.240 --> 01:49:35.240
Maybe my stuff is starting to break, I don't know.

01:49:35.240 --> 01:49:43.240
Go into your sound panel outside of Discord, like your Windows sound panel, and see what your mic levels are at.

01:49:43.240 --> 01:49:46.240
I mean, it should be fine.

01:49:46.240 --> 01:49:48.240
Crank that shit up, Kibbs.

01:49:48.240 --> 01:49:50.240
Even louder.

01:49:50.240 --> 01:49:52.240
How about now? Is that any better?

01:49:52.240 --> 01:49:54.240
Jesus, what the fuck happened?

01:49:54.240 --> 01:49:56.240
What, is it too loud now? I'll turn it down.

01:49:56.240 --> 01:49:59.240
Not only is it too loud, all the background noise is back.

01:49:59.240 --> 01:50:01.240
Is that any better? Is the background noise gone?

01:50:01.240 --> 01:50:07.240
I set you to 200 and I can hear you now, but there's like a loud hum in the background whenever you talk.

01:50:07.240 --> 01:50:10.240
No, it's not that loud. It's only kinda loud.

01:50:13.240 --> 01:50:15.240
What's going on?

01:50:15.240 --> 01:50:17.240
I can't hear it now.

01:50:17.240 --> 01:50:21.240
That sounds like it might be an improperly seated audio cable, so try like...

01:50:21.240 --> 01:50:24.240
Do you use XLR connections for your mics?

01:50:26.240 --> 01:50:30.240
I can't even understand you at this point. It's all just humming.

01:50:30.240 --> 01:50:38.240
What you should do is unplug your XLR connectors, give them a little dust off, and plug them back in.

01:50:43.240 --> 01:50:45.240
Are you back?

01:50:45.240 --> 01:50:47.240
Should be.

01:50:47.240 --> 01:50:49.240
It sounds the exact same.

01:50:49.240 --> 01:50:59.240
Wiggle the cord at the end of the connector and talk at the same time. Try doing that for each end.

01:50:59.240 --> 01:51:01.240
Yeah, anything here?

01:51:01.240 --> 01:51:03.240
Nope.

01:51:03.240 --> 01:51:05.240
How about here?

01:51:05.240 --> 01:51:11.240
That's it. That's the broken one. You probably have a break in your XLR cable.

01:51:11.240 --> 01:51:13.240
Okay, well...

01:51:15.240 --> 01:51:17.240
Get a replacement.

01:51:18.240 --> 01:51:24.240
Okay, so chat. Did you tell your chat the story of what happened today? Of your failure, Kibs?

01:51:24.240 --> 01:51:27.240
How you were an hour late and then your cable didn't work?

01:51:27.240 --> 01:51:31.240
I told them in Galactic Sibs stream, I was like, so I showed up, I was like, hey Dev, how you doing?

01:51:31.240 --> 01:51:36.240
Dev's like, I'm a homosexual. Okay, you know, that's cool for you. I'm not judging.

01:51:36.240 --> 01:51:41.240
Tell them how that went down, and then my mic stopped working because Dev was being fat and very loud.

01:51:41.240 --> 01:51:43.240
That's how it happened, eh?

01:51:44.240 --> 01:51:47.240
It caused me to fall on my microphone and bump the cable.

01:51:47.240 --> 01:51:53.240
Firstly, I've had XLR cables fail in that exact way before, so I recognized the sound as soon as I heard it.

01:51:53.240 --> 01:51:56.240
I was like, Kibs, your XLR is fucked up.

01:51:56.240 --> 01:52:00.240
I'm actually glad you noticed because I was trying to figure out what the fuck was wrong with it.

01:52:00.240 --> 01:52:02.240
Was that the first time it had been happening?

01:52:02.240 --> 01:52:05.240
This is the first time I've ever had to replace my XLR cable.

01:52:05.240 --> 01:52:10.240
Okay. Has it been making that noise since before this morning?

01:52:10.240 --> 01:52:12.240
For about a year.

01:52:13.240 --> 01:52:15.240
Are you fucking serious?

01:52:15.240 --> 01:52:18.240
I know, but it was so, like, anytime I'd unplug it and plug it back in, it was like, fixed.

01:52:18.240 --> 01:52:22.240
I was like, huh, that's weird. Like, it would just seemingly fix itself.

01:52:22.240 --> 01:52:25.240
It's gotten progressively worse in the last month.

01:52:25.240 --> 01:52:28.240
You could have just wiggled it, we could have done the recording.

01:52:29.240 --> 01:52:31.240
It's unstable.

01:52:32.240 --> 01:52:34.240
Like, it's occasionally fasted anyways.

01:52:34.240 --> 01:52:37.240
It's not that unstable, you've been streaming all day.

01:52:37.240 --> 01:52:41.240
Yeah, but I also have the music of the game turned up, so it covers it up when it does act up.

01:52:41.240 --> 01:52:42.240
Oh.

01:52:43.240 --> 01:52:44.240
Yeah.

01:52:45.240 --> 01:52:46.240
Basically.
