0	4100	Hello my friends, I figured it's time that I update you on what I've been doing.
4100	8420	After all, when I announced my demonetization, a lot of you were very generous with donations.
8420	11820	You gave me most of what I was projected to get from YouTube for this month.
11820	16300	I'm able to reapply for monetization on October 30th, and I've identified the problem so I'm
16300	17300	hoping I'll get it back.
17300	19640	But that's not to say I've been doing nothing all this time.
19640	23400	As always, I've been outputting content over on my gaming channel, Game Boomers.
23400	27660	I've been streaming some Halloween-y games for October, plus Cooking Mama for Canadian
27660	32140	Thanksgiving, and I'll be there shortly after this video goes up with Carrion, so drop by
32140	33140	for that.
33140	37620	I also have another channel called The Dev Kit, where I put up basically random junk.
37620	41940	I've been meaning to edit some unboxings and vlogs that I've shot for that channel, and
41940	45420	just today I put out Naomi building her first PC.
45420	48380	It took us six hours to do, but I cut the video down nicely.
48380	51720	I'm going to keep releasing random odds and ends on that channel too.
51720	55580	There's unboxings, there's Dave's old anime reviews, and a bunch of other stuff that doesn't
55580	60060	strictly fit into the politics or game playthroughs of SFO or GB.
60060	64560	So if you want to see me outside of the usual wheelhouse, consider checking out that channel
64560	65560	too.
65560	69660	And just because I've spent the last two weeks focusing on side projects doesn't mean I haven't
69660	72540	been doing work for my inevitable return to SFO as well.
72540	76740	I've set up a new recording battle station, complete with one of those mics that Joe Rogan
76740	77740	has popularized.
77740	79500	In fact, I'm recording with it right now.
79500	81820	Does it sound any better than the old Blue Yeti?
81820	84020	Oh yeah, the lip balm?
84020	85060	That's for recording.
85060	87340	It prevents your lips from smacking, it really works.
87340	91580	As I've previously said, I don't want to make too many pre-recorded videos while YouTube
91580	93180	takes all the money for them.
93180	96420	I'd rather do SFO streams instead, and then delete them afterward.
96420	97980	So that's what I'm going to do.
97980	102580	I'll be running both Streamlabs and StreamElements so I can pay my bills, and after the streams
102580	105380	are over I'll upload them to the SFO Bitchute channel.
105380	110300	Also, any videos that may prevent re-monetization will be pulled off of this channel and put
110300	111860	on my Devonitize channel.
112020	115460	I don't like the idea of any of my content disappearing permanently, so that channel
115460	119220	will serve as an archive for videos too spicy for the main channel.
119220	121180	Maybe also the stream VODs, I'm not sure.
121180	124060	I've also commissioned some new artwork and music.
124060	127700	I want to do a sort of, uh, channel relaunch when I come back.
127700	130620	I'm reasonably sure that I'll get the monetization back.
130620	134060	I've received some behind-the-scenes help from a few different sources.
134060	137460	And truth be told, I've been itching to get back to scripted videos too, but for now I
137460	140740	am going to stick to streaming because frankly, I don't want to give in to YouTube.
140740	141740	It's that simple.
141740	145900	To recap, you're going to see regular SFO streams from now until I'm back on my feet,
145900	149380	and there will be new artwork and music to go with the new videos once I return.
149380	153340	And I'm going to keep working on my side channels all the while, so if you want to support me,
153340	158060	please consider checking out those projects, my Patreon or Subscribestar, or consider using
158060	160100	my affiliate links in the description.
160100	163020	Any method helps, even if it's just watching and being here.
163020	164420	Alright guys, I'll see you later.
164420	165140	I love you.
