Hello my friends, I figured it's time that I update you on what I've been doing.

00:04.100 --> 00:08.420
After all, when I announced my demonetization, a lot of you were very generous with donations.

00:08.420 --> 00:11.820
You gave me most of what I was projected to get from YouTube for this month.

00:11.820 --> 00:16.300
I'm able to reapply for monetization on October 30th, and I've identified the problem so I'm

00:16.300 --> 00:17.300
hoping I'll get it back.

00:17.300 --> 00:19.640
But that's not to say I've been doing nothing all this time.

00:19.640 --> 00:23.400
As always, I've been outputting content over on my gaming channel, Game Boomers.

00:23.400 --> 00:27.660
I've been streaming some Halloween-y games for October, plus Cooking Mama for Canadian

00:27.660 --> 00:32.140
Thanksgiving, and I'll be there shortly after this video goes up with Carrion, so drop by

00:32.140 --> 00:33.140
for that.

00:33.140 --> 00:37.620
I also have another channel called The Dev Kit, where I put up basically random junk.

00:37.620 --> 00:41.940
I've been meaning to edit some unboxings and vlogs that I've shot for that channel, and

00:41.940 --> 00:45.420
just today I put out Naomi building her first PC.

00:45.420 --> 00:48.380
It took us six hours to do, but I cut the video down nicely.

00:48.380 --> 00:51.720
I'm going to keep releasing random odds and ends on that channel too.

00:51.720 --> 00:55.580
There's unboxings, there's Dave's old anime reviews, and a bunch of other stuff that doesn't

00:55.580 --> 01:00.060
strictly fit into the politics or game playthroughs of SFO or GB.

01:00.060 --> 01:04.560
So if you want to see me outside of the usual wheelhouse, consider checking out that channel

01:04.560 --> 01:05.560
too.

01:05.560 --> 01:09.660
And just because I've spent the last two weeks focusing on side projects doesn't mean I haven't

01:09.660 --> 01:12.540
been doing work for my inevitable return to SFO as well.

01:12.540 --> 01:16.740
I've set up a new recording battle station, complete with one of those mics that Joe Rogan

01:16.740 --> 01:17.740
has popularized.

01:17.740 --> 01:19.500
In fact, I'm recording with it right now.

01:19.500 --> 01:21.820
Does it sound any better than the old Blue Yeti?

01:21.820 --> 01:24.020
Oh yeah, the lip balm?

01:24.020 --> 01:25.060
That's for recording.

01:25.060 --> 01:27.340
It prevents your lips from smacking, it really works.

01:27.340 --> 01:31.580
As I've previously said, I don't want to make too many pre-recorded videos while YouTube

01:31.580 --> 01:33.180
takes all the money for them.

01:33.180 --> 01:36.420
I'd rather do SFO streams instead, and then delete them afterward.

01:36.420 --> 01:37.980
So that's what I'm going to do.

01:37.980 --> 01:42.580
I'll be running both Streamlabs and StreamElements so I can pay my bills, and after the streams

01:42.580 --> 01:45.380
are over I'll upload them to the SFO Bitchute channel.

01:45.380 --> 01:50.300
Also, any videos that may prevent re-monetization will be pulled off of this channel and put

01:50.300 --> 01:51.860
on my Devonitize channel.

01:52.020 --> 01:55.460
I don't like the idea of any of my content disappearing permanently, so that channel

01:55.460 --> 01:59.220
will serve as an archive for videos too spicy for the main channel.

01:59.220 --> 02:01.180
Maybe also the stream VODs, I'm not sure.

02:01.180 --> 02:04.060
I've also commissioned some new artwork and music.

02:04.060 --> 02:07.700
I want to do a sort of, uh, channel relaunch when I come back.

02:07.700 --> 02:10.620
I'm reasonably sure that I'll get the monetization back.

02:10.620 --> 02:14.060
I've received some behind-the-scenes help from a few different sources.

02:14.060 --> 02:17.460
And truth be told, I've been itching to get back to scripted videos too, but for now I

02:17.460 --> 02:20.740
am going to stick to streaming because frankly, I don't want to give in to YouTube.

02:20.740 --> 02:21.740
It's that simple.

02:21.740 --> 02:25.900
To recap, you're going to see regular SFO streams from now until I'm back on my feet,

02:25.900 --> 02:29.380
and there will be new artwork and music to go with the new videos once I return.

02:29.380 --> 02:33.340
And I'm going to keep working on my side channels all the while, so if you want to support me,

02:33.340 --> 02:38.060
please consider checking out those projects, my Patreon or Subscribestar, or consider using

02:38.060 --> 02:40.100
my affiliate links in the description.

02:40.100 --> 02:43.020
Any method helps, even if it's just watching and being here.

02:43.020 --> 02:44.420
Alright guys, I'll see you later.

02:44.420 --> 02:45.140
I love you.
