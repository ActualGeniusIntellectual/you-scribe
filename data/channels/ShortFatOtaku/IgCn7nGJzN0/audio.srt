00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,100
Hello my friends, I figured it's time that I update you on what I've been doing.

2
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:08,420
After all, when I announced my demonetization, a lot of you were very generous with donations.

3
00:00:08,420 --> 00:00:11,820
You gave me most of what I was projected to get from YouTube for this month.

4
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:16,300
I'm able to reapply for monetization on October 30th, and I've identified the problem so I'm

5
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:17,300
hoping I'll get it back.

6
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:19,640
But that's not to say I've been doing nothing all this time.

7
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:23,400
As always, I've been outputting content over on my gaming channel, Game Boomers.

8
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:27,660
I've been streaming some Halloween-y games for October, plus Cooking Mama for Canadian

9
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:32,140
Thanksgiving, and I'll be there shortly after this video goes up with Carrion, so drop by

10
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:33,140
for that.

11
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:37,620
I also have another channel called The Dev Kit, where I put up basically random junk.

12
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:41,940
I've been meaning to edit some unboxings and vlogs that I've shot for that channel, and

13
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:45,420
just today I put out Naomi building her first PC.

14
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:48,380
It took us six hours to do, but I cut the video down nicely.

15
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:51,720
I'm going to keep releasing random odds and ends on that channel too.

16
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:55,580
There's unboxings, there's Dave's old anime reviews, and a bunch of other stuff that doesn't

17
00:00:55,580 --> 00:01:00,060
strictly fit into the politics or game playthroughs of SFO or GB.

18
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:04,560
So if you want to see me outside of the usual wheelhouse, consider checking out that channel

19
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:05,560
too.

20
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:09,660
And just because I've spent the last two weeks focusing on side projects doesn't mean I haven't

21
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:12,540
been doing work for my inevitable return to SFO as well.

22
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:16,740
I've set up a new recording battle station, complete with one of those mics that Joe Rogan

23
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:17,740
has popularized.

24
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:19,500
In fact, I'm recording with it right now.

25
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:21,820
Does it sound any better than the old Blue Yeti?

26
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:24,020
Oh yeah, the lip balm?

27
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:25,060
That's for recording.

28
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:27,340
It prevents your lips from smacking, it really works.

29
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:31,580
As I've previously said, I don't want to make too many pre-recorded videos while YouTube

30
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:33,180
takes all the money for them.

31
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:36,420
I'd rather do SFO streams instead, and then delete them afterward.

32
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:37,980
So that's what I'm going to do.

33
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:42,580
I'll be running both Streamlabs and StreamElements so I can pay my bills, and after the streams

34
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:45,380
are over I'll upload them to the SFO Bitchute channel.

35
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:50,300
Also, any videos that may prevent re-monetization will be pulled off of this channel and put

36
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:51,860
on my Devonitize channel.

37
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:55,460
I don't like the idea of any of my content disappearing permanently, so that channel

38
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:59,220
will serve as an archive for videos too spicy for the main channel.

39
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:01,180
Maybe also the stream VODs, I'm not sure.

40
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:04,060
I've also commissioned some new artwork and music.

41
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:07,700
I want to do a sort of, uh, channel relaunch when I come back.

42
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:10,620
I'm reasonably sure that I'll get the monetization back.

43
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:14,060
I've received some behind-the-scenes help from a few different sources.

44
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:17,460
And truth be told, I've been itching to get back to scripted videos too, but for now I

45
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:20,740
am going to stick to streaming because frankly, I don't want to give in to YouTube.

46
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:21,740
It's that simple.

47
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:25,900
To recap, you're going to see regular SFO streams from now until I'm back on my feet,

48
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:29,380
and there will be new artwork and music to go with the new videos once I return.

49
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:33,340
And I'm going to keep working on my side channels all the while, so if you want to support me,

50
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:38,060
please consider checking out those projects, my Patreon or Subscribestar, or consider using

51
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:40,100
my affiliate links in the description.

52
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:43,020
Any method helps, even if it's just watching and being here.

53
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:44,420
Alright guys, I'll see you later.

54
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:45,140
I love you.
