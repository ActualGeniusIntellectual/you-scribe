00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,680
Alright, I know I said I was doing a different topic today last time, I don't remember

2
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:12,520
what it was, it doesn't matter. Today we're talking about VABing. I covered this in a

3
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:16,200
weekly sip a few weeks back, but in case you didn't watch it, let me give you the details.

4
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:18,820
Or rather, let's let stylists give us the details.

5
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:23,920
Why VABing has become a controversial TikTok trend for people who want to attract a partner.

6
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:29,040
VABing, also known as vaginal dabbing, is the practice of using vaginal fluids as a

7
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:36,000
perfume to attract people, and it is worryingly gaining popularity on TikTok.

8
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:46,720
Now this might be a new trend on TikTok, but it's actually a lot older than that.

9
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:50,760
A lot of articles being published right now promoting the positive effects of VABing

10
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:54,720
mention that this practice has been known about since the 1950s, but they all cite

11
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:58,880
each other without actually, you know, going back to a source. So I went digging for that source,

12
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:00,720
and here's what I found.

13
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:05,560
Pheromones, a new term for a class of biologically active substances, published by doctors Carlson

14
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:11,120
and Lutcher, January 3rd, 1959. This was the first discovery of what we now know as a pheromone,

15
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:14,580
a substance that behaves like a hormone, but instead of being secreted within the bloodstream,

16
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:18,880
is actually secreted outside the animal in order to induce the desired behavior on another

17
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:22,000
organism. As an example, the paper describes the sexual habits of butterflies, where the

18
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,240
female butterfly secretes a substance that, when it comes into contact with the male butterfly's

19
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:29,600
antennae, causes them to be ready to mate. We had no way of describing this chemical

20
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,520
in 1959, so they coined the term pheromone.

21
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:35,520
The science in whether or not humans have pheromones is currently not settled. This

22
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:39,120
paper, Pheromones and Their Effect on Women's Mood and Sexuality, claims that humans do

23
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:44,380
indeed have pheromones, specifically adrostatinone, while the textbook Neurobiology of Chemical

24
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:48,180
Communication claims that adrostatinone is not actually a pheromone. Long story short,

25
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:49,180
we don't know.

26
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:52,000
But that's not going to stop these chicks from rubbing their pussy juice all over.

27
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,840
Welcome to Vabbing 101. Disclaimer, I did not come up with Vabbing, but I've been doing

28
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,960
it for a week and it's been working out for me. You don't need a whole lot of your own

29
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:09,480
scents and juices for a successful VAB. Just a simple, damp VAB on your wrist and behind

30
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:11,920
your neck will work perfectly fine.

31
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:15,640
This is one of the videos that went viral. And man, just check out that list.

32
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:21,720
So number one, make sure you shower and or bathe before you VAB. Number two, wash your

33
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:25,480
hands before you VAB and of course after you VAB.

34
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:29,600
You know, if your Jamba juice is so amazing, why would you need to wash up and make sure

35
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:30,600
it doesn't touch anybody else?

36
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:35,840
The areas you VAB normally are behind your ear and on your wrist. Those are normally

37
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:41,600
surfaces that don't touch other things. So please make sure to not rub your ears or your

38
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:44,120
wrists on other items and or people.

39
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:48,480
Jesus Christ, I am never hugging or shaking hands with anyone ever again. This is too

40
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:52,720
much for me. This chick's account is insane, by the way. It's all either VABing content

41
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:56,960
or health at any size content. Listen, lady, from one fat person to another, we aren't

42
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:59,880
healthy. Let's check out another VABber on TikTok.

43
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:05,280
So here's how I VAB. So myself in my previous video said that I've been doing this for

44
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:10,040
20 years and I have been doing this for 20 years, but I haven't been doing it for 20

45
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:14,960
years and then going out and hanging out in public and asking people to sniff my pussy

46
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:15,960
juice.

47
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:18,040
I don't want to be around anymore.

48
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:24,920
I employ VABbing or encourage VABbing and recommend it as part of like a mating ritual

49
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:29,880
with a current lover that already loves your juices.

50
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:33,880
Wait a minute. I thought the VABbing thing was to attract a new partner, but this lady

51
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:37,440
is using it with her current one. Aren't you supposed to be applying the magic juice to

52
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,160
attract them in the first place?

53
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:44,200
The hottest thing is to have a lover who wants to devour you.

54
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:46,320
Oh, my God, she's into for.

55
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:48,240
Listen, I taste delicious.

56
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:56,240
Like I like I like we should bottle this up and sell it because I taste delicious and

57
00:03:56,240 --> 00:04:00,880
I have zero shame about how I show up in this world.

58
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:02,720
Thank you very much.

59
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:05,040
You know, maybe a little shame is good.

60
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:08,240
Yeah, there's times where shame gets out of hand, goes a little too far, but there's a

61
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:14,040
golden mean, you know, and when a lover has gone down on you and then comes back up to

62
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:19,600
kiss you, that's hot because everybody likes their own brand.

63
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,720
I'm going to let you in on a little secret.

64
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:25,000
All you incels out there, listen, nobody actually tastes good.

65
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,160
If you shower and clean up nice, you know, be respectful for your partner.

66
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,360
The best you're going to get is tasting neutral.

67
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:31,640
Just just all right.

68
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:33,600
Nobody actually wants to gobble that shit up.

69
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,720
Nobody wants to bottle it.

70
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:37,720
That's something that I wish Gwyneth Paltrow would have learned where she put her vag juice

71
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,240
into a candle and tried to sell it.

72
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:43,880
Pheromones are like a secreted chemical hormone and every person's pheromones smell different

73
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:44,920
to different people.

74
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:48,720
And in the wild, animals like secrete their pheromones to attract mates.

75
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:52,280
Jesus Christ, can we keep this shit in the wild, please, lady?

76
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:53,280
Get up there.

77
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,280
Give him a swipe.

78
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:57,440
You don't have to be like fresh out of the shower clean, but relatively clean.

79
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:02,760
Dab, vab behind the ears, on the wrists, maybe a little on the neck.

80
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:05,520
I don't want to live on this planet anymore.

81
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:10,880
And I swear, if you vab, you will attract people like a day, a one night stand, or you'll

82
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,760
just get free drinks all night.

83
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:16,400
Notice how all these women are all talking about dates and one night stands and drinks.

84
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:19,880
They're all deep in the hookup culture where desperate dudes are heading down to the club

85
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:21,520
looking to do this shit anyway.

86
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:24,360
And damn, they all look like they should be aging out of that culture at this point.

87
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:28,200
I don't know what they're putting in pheromone perfume, but it can't replicate your own smell

88
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:30,400
and your own personalized chemicals.

89
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,560
Proceed with caution because it works.

90
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:35,960
By the way, I learned this from the secret keepers podcast a couple of years ago.

91
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:38,720
Shout out Emma and Carly.

92
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,680
You know, we got to check that shit out.

93
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:41,680
Let's give it a listen.

94
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:42,680
I hunted it down.

95
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:48,160
I had met this, this sexpert and she said, if a woman puts her hands in between her legs,

96
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:57,920
like into her vagina juice and rubs it behind her ears, you send off your pheromones and

97
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:01,980
it makes the opposite sex attracted to you fascinating.

98
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:06,060
It's fascinating because it's like a boost of your, your pheromones, right?

99
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:09,000
So we've been getting nonstop real thing.

100
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Yeah.

101
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:14,120
When you click with someone, your, their, their pheromones, cause that's why you get

102
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:16,040
close to someone and you love their smell.

103
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:18,840
So all these guys were coming up to me.

104
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:19,840
It was wild.

105
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:22,960
So I'm sitting there and my friends like, what the fuck?

106
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,960
She's like, what did you VAB?

107
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:25,960
No way.

108
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:26,960
She listens to the podcast.

109
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:27,960
She goes, what did you VAB or something?

110
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:28,960
I was a joke.

111
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:29,960
And I went, I did.

112
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:30,960
And after that?

113
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:34,360
Were these guys going away or were they just lingering?

114
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:41,160
They were like, like lingering, they were lingering, dude.

115
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:43,600
They're lingering because they want to get laid.

116
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:48,960
And you're a vapid shallow person in a vapid shallow subculture full of other vapid shallow

117
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:49,960
people.

118
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:54,400
It's not because you spread your snatch snot all over yourself being, you know, old man

119
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:55,400
Devo.

120
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:58,560
I could have sworn that I've heard of people doing this shit like a decade or two ago.

121
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:03,400
I remember the whole pussy juice as perfume thing being a joke as far back as my teenage

122
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:04,400
years.

123
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:07,960
And though there's no solid documentation of this, it does seem to be the case.

124
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:10,880
This isn't just some new, weird gen Z thing.

125
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:14,320
This is an interesting video about a topic that I'm shocked.

126
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:19,720
I have not made a video about this yet because I've actually been using this technique or

127
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:22,920
researching it and discussing it for the past decade.

128
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:28,120
But I guess the first time I ever officially put it out there was in my new book, man,

129
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:29,960
millennials really do ruin everything.

130
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:33,360
And there are a lot of other things that also seem to be kind of related, not just

131
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:37,520
the goop vagina candle, but stuff like the free bleeding movement where women run around

132
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:41,960
without tampons and you know, free bleed, or those women who have made bread or beer

133
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:46,720
out of their vaginal yeast or the witches who use period blood as reagents for casting

134
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:47,880
magic spells.

135
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:50,240
Why is everyone doing weird shit with their vaginas?

136
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,240
What the fuck, dude?

137
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,840
You don't see guys out there doing this.

138
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:56,640
You don't see them trying to make actual cheese out of their dick cheese or whatever.

139
00:07:56,640 --> 00:08:01,860
In fact, the few times guys do actually do something fucking weird like this, it's generally

140
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:03,600
at the behest of women around them.

141
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:08,400
Like that one chick who claimed that daily semen smoothies kept her free of the coronavirus

142
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:12,960
or the dude who wrote books on how to cook and mix drinks with cum after an experience

143
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:18,280
at a party back in 2006, where after a relevant conversation, he realized, and I'm quoting

144
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:22,320
here, if you want your partner to swallow, you should be willing to eat your own semen.

145
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:27,000
This guy even has videos making one of the drinks, the things some people will do to

146
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
get laid.

147
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,500
I think a lot of this ties back to the sacred womanhood sect of feminism.

148
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:36,140
This is a type of feminism that posits biology ruling the day, that women by virtue of being

149
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:38,280
female have access to a sacred energy.

150
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:42,440
They are connected to the sacred feminine goddess, that their vaginas are sacred life-giving

151
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:43,440
organs.

152
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,440
You know what I'm talking about.

153
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:46,380
Inside of each woman is an incredible force.

154
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:50,400
The sacred feminine, the divine feminine, describes our connection to the mother goddess.

155
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:55,080
This internal power gives us life and calls to her, discover the many facets of our feminine

156
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:57,740
energy and its deeply sacred essence.

157
00:08:57,740 --> 00:09:02,160
The sacred feminine is inherently tied to the gift of life and the conception of a life-giving

158
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:05,520
womb in harmony with mother earth and the rest of creation.

159
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:09,660
It's basically just new age hippie bullshit, specifically adapted to feminism, meant to

160
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:14,040
imbue sex differences with a spirituality that justifies privileging women due to some

161
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:15,040
innate nature.

162
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:18,800
It's also a very trans-exclusive form of feminism because it focuses on biology, but just because

163
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:21,200
it rejects self-ID doesn't make it any less retarded.

164
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:24,540
And this is what people like Gwyneth Paltrow are tapping into when they try to sell you

165
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:29,880
shit like jade eggs to insert in your vag that apparently Chinese queens used to balance

166
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:34,240
hormones, regulate menstrual cycles, increase sexual energy, and connect the second chakra

167
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,940
to the yoni for optimal self-love and well-being.

168
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:40,640
This is basically Gwyneth Paltrow's entire career now, monetizing hippie dippie spiritual

169
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:41,640
femininity.

170
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:42,640
And you know what?

171
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:43,640
It's all bullshit.

172
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:46,020
Your body is still gross and disgusting if you don't wash it.

173
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:49,620
Nobody wants your period blood any more than they want your sweat or your piss.

174
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:52,100
Your vaginal yeast, your fucking vabbing, all of it.

175
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:53,900
It's all pretty fucking foul, guys.

176
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:55,660
I know, I know, don't shame me.

177
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:56,660
It's my natural body.

178
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:57,660
Yeah, I don't care.

179
00:09:57,660 --> 00:09:58,660
This is fucking nasty.

180
00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:00,980
Something being natural doesn't automatically make it good.

181
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:05,020
Do you want dudes to start gathering up all their pre-cum or dig underneath their foreskin

182
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:08,060
and start pabbing before dates too, you fucking animals?

183
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:09,060
Hey, you know what?

184
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:11,420
Naomi's never gonna do any of this insane stuff.

185
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:14,740
No woman is ever gonna be in my life if she does, so you don't gotta care what I think

186
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:15,740
at the end of the day.

187
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:18,420
But maybe you gals should, you know, listen to the experts.

188
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:21,020
The experts y'all are so keen to tout when it suits you.

189
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:24,780
TikTok users are vabbing, wearing their vaginal juices as perfume to activate their natural

190
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:25,780
attraction.

191
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:27,620
A scientist says that makes no sense.

192
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:32,620
Exclusive, doctors warn dangerous, vabbing TikTok trend that sees women use vaginal discharge

193
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:35,060
as perfume could cause thrush or even infertility.

194
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:36,580
Actually, you know what?

195
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:37,580
Keep going.

196
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:40,460
You ladies leaving the gene pool might do the human race a service.

197
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:43,100
At the very least, astrology will go back out of fashion again.

198
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:45,380
You know, at this point, I think I'm just a boomer.

199
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:48,660
I don't really use TikTok, and every time I look over there, it's like everything is

200
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:50,200
on fire all the time.

201
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:53,500
Every week, there's a new brand of retardation that pours out of that site, and it's worse

202
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:54,500
than Twitter is.

203
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:58,300
You know, I have vivid memories of being a babby dev, barely being able to stand all

204
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:02,280
the dumb blondes in my class at school, and then breathing a sigh of relief as the final

205
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:05,980
bell rang and I could go home and spend the rest of my day playing Ogre Battle on the

206
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:06,980
N64 or whatever.

207
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:09,780
And after graduation, I thought I'd left all those bitches behind.

208
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:14,220
But here I am as a grown ass man, and my job is to watch them continue to be retarded on

209
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:15,220
the internet as adults.

210
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:19,500
I don't know whether to be severely disappointed or grateful that this is where I am, getting

211
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:22,780
paid to laugh at people on the internet who frankly should be put away.
