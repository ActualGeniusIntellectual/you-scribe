0	8680	Alright, I know I said I was doing a different topic today last time, I don't remember
8680	12520	what it was, it doesn't matter. Today we're talking about VABing. I covered this in a
12520	16200	weekly sip a few weeks back, but in case you didn't watch it, let me give you the details.
16200	18820	Or rather, let's let stylists give us the details.
18820	23920	Why VABing has become a controversial TikTok trend for people who want to attract a partner.
23920	29040	VABing, also known as vaginal dabbing, is the practice of using vaginal fluids as a
29080	36000	perfume to attract people, and it is worryingly gaining popularity on TikTok.
42240	46720	Now this might be a new trend on TikTok, but it's actually a lot older than that.
46720	50760	A lot of articles being published right now promoting the positive effects of VABing
50760	54720	mention that this practice has been known about since the 1950s, but they all cite
54720	58880	each other without actually, you know, going back to a source. So I went digging for that source,
59720	60720	and here's what I found.
60720	65560	Pheromones, a new term for a class of biologically active substances, published by doctors Carlson
65560	71120	and Lutcher, January 3rd, 1959. This was the first discovery of what we now know as a pheromone,
71120	74580	a substance that behaves like a hormone, but instead of being secreted within the bloodstream,
74580	78880	is actually secreted outside the animal in order to induce the desired behavior on another
78880	82000	organism. As an example, the paper describes the sexual habits of butterflies, where the
82000	86240	female butterfly secretes a substance that, when it comes into contact with the male butterfly's
86240	89600	antennae, causes them to be ready to mate. We had no way of describing this chemical
89600	91520	in 1959, so they coined the term pheromone.
91520	95520	The science in whether or not humans have pheromones is currently not settled. This
95520	99120	paper, Pheromones and Their Effect on Women's Mood and Sexuality, claims that humans do
99120	104380	indeed have pheromones, specifically adrostatinone, while the textbook Neurobiology of Chemical
104380	108180	Communication claims that adrostatinone is not actually a pheromone. Long story short,
108180	109180	we don't know.
109180	112000	But that's not going to stop these chicks from rubbing their pussy juice all over.
112000	117840	Welcome to Vabbing 101. Disclaimer, I did not come up with Vabbing, but I've been doing
117840	121960	it for a week and it's been working out for me. You don't need a whole lot of your own
121960	129480	scents and juices for a successful VAB. Just a simple, damp VAB on your wrist and behind
129480	131920	your neck will work perfectly fine.
131920	135640	This is one of the videos that went viral. And man, just check out that list.
135640	141720	So number one, make sure you shower and or bathe before you VAB. Number two, wash your
141760	145480	hands before you VAB and of course after you VAB.
145480	149600	You know, if your Jamba juice is so amazing, why would you need to wash up and make sure
149600	150600	it doesn't touch anybody else?
150600	155840	The areas you VAB normally are behind your ear and on your wrist. Those are normally
155840	161600	surfaces that don't touch other things. So please make sure to not rub your ears or your
161600	164120	wrists on other items and or people.
164120	168480	Jesus Christ, I am never hugging or shaking hands with anyone ever again. This is too
168480	172720	much for me. This chick's account is insane, by the way. It's all either VABing content
172720	176960	or health at any size content. Listen, lady, from one fat person to another, we aren't
176960	179880	healthy. Let's check out another VABber on TikTok.
179880	185280	So here's how I VAB. So myself in my previous video said that I've been doing this for
185280	190040	20 years and I have been doing this for 20 years, but I haven't been doing it for 20
190040	194960	years and then going out and hanging out in public and asking people to sniff my pussy
194960	195960	juice.
195960	198040	I don't want to be around anymore.
198040	204920	I employ VABbing or encourage VABbing and recommend it as part of like a mating ritual
204920	209880	with a current lover that already loves your juices.
209880	213880	Wait a minute. I thought the VABbing thing was to attract a new partner, but this lady
213880	217440	is using it with her current one. Aren't you supposed to be applying the magic juice to
217440	219160	attract them in the first place?
219160	224200	The hottest thing is to have a lover who wants to devour you.
224240	226320	Oh, my God, she's into for.
226320	228240	Listen, I taste delicious.
228240	236240	Like I like I like we should bottle this up and sell it because I taste delicious and
236240	240880	I have zero shame about how I show up in this world.
240880	242720	Thank you very much.
242720	245040	You know, maybe a little shame is good.
245040	248240	Yeah, there's times where shame gets out of hand, goes a little too far, but there's a
248240	254040	golden mean, you know, and when a lover has gone down on you and then comes back up to
254040	259600	kiss you, that's hot because everybody likes their own brand.
259600	261720	I'm going to let you in on a little secret.
261720	265000	All you incels out there, listen, nobody actually tastes good.
265000	268160	If you shower and clean up nice, you know, be respectful for your partner.
268160	270360	The best you're going to get is tasting neutral.
270360	271640	Just just all right.
271640	273600	Nobody actually wants to gobble that shit up.
273600	274720	Nobody wants to bottle it.
274720	277720	That's something that I wish Gwyneth Paltrow would have learned where she put her vag juice
277720	279240	into a candle and tried to sell it.
279240	283880	Pheromones are like a secreted chemical hormone and every person's pheromones smell different
283920	284920	to different people.
284920	288720	And in the wild, animals like secrete their pheromones to attract mates.
288720	292280	Jesus Christ, can we keep this shit in the wild, please, lady?
292280	293280	Get up there.
293280	294280	Give him a swipe.
294280	297440	You don't have to be like fresh out of the shower clean, but relatively clean.
297440	302760	Dab, vab behind the ears, on the wrists, maybe a little on the neck.
302760	305520	I don't want to live on this planet anymore.
305520	310880	And I swear, if you vab, you will attract people like a day, a one night stand, or you'll
310880	312760	just get free drinks all night.
312760	316400	Notice how all these women are all talking about dates and one night stands and drinks.
316400	319880	They're all deep in the hookup culture where desperate dudes are heading down to the club
319880	321520	looking to do this shit anyway.
321520	324360	And damn, they all look like they should be aging out of that culture at this point.
324360	328200	I don't know what they're putting in pheromone perfume, but it can't replicate your own smell
328200	330400	and your own personalized chemicals.
330400	332560	Proceed with caution because it works.
332560	335960	By the way, I learned this from the secret keepers podcast a couple of years ago.
335960	338720	Shout out Emma and Carly.
338720	340680	You know, we got to check that shit out.
340680	341680	Let's give it a listen.
341680	342680	I hunted it down.
342680	348160	I had met this, this sexpert and she said, if a woman puts her hands in between her legs,
348160	357920	like into her vagina juice and rubs it behind her ears, you send off your pheromones and
357920	361980	it makes the opposite sex attracted to you fascinating.
361980	366060	It's fascinating because it's like a boost of your, your pheromones, right?
366060	369000	So we've been getting nonstop real thing.
369000	370000	Yeah.
370600	374120	When you click with someone, your, their, their pheromones, cause that's why you get
374120	376040	close to someone and you love their smell.
376040	378840	So all these guys were coming up to me.
378840	379840	It was wild.
379840	382960	So I'm sitting there and my friends like, what the fuck?
382960	384960	She's like, what did you VAB?
384960	385960	No way.
385960	386960	She listens to the podcast.
386960	387960	She goes, what did you VAB or something?
387960	388960	I was a joke.
388960	389960	And I went, I did.
389960	390960	And after that?
390960	394360	Were these guys going away or were they just lingering?
394360	401160	They were like, like lingering, they were lingering, dude.
401160	403600	They're lingering because they want to get laid.
403600	408960	And you're a vapid shallow person in a vapid shallow subculture full of other vapid shallow
408960	409960	people.
409960	414400	It's not because you spread your snatch snot all over yourself being, you know, old man
414400	415400	Devo.
415400	418560	I could have sworn that I've heard of people doing this shit like a decade or two ago.
418560	423400	I remember the whole pussy juice as perfume thing being a joke as far back as my teenage
423400	424400	years.
424400	427960	And though there's no solid documentation of this, it does seem to be the case.
427960	430880	This isn't just some new, weird gen Z thing.
430880	434320	This is an interesting video about a topic that I'm shocked.
434320	439720	I have not made a video about this yet because I've actually been using this technique or
439720	442920	researching it and discussing it for the past decade.
442920	448120	But I guess the first time I ever officially put it out there was in my new book, man,
448120	449960	millennials really do ruin everything.
449960	453360	And there are a lot of other things that also seem to be kind of related, not just
453360	457520	the goop vagina candle, but stuff like the free bleeding movement where women run around
457520	461960	without tampons and you know, free bleed, or those women who have made bread or beer
461960	466720	out of their vaginal yeast or the witches who use period blood as reagents for casting
466720	467880	magic spells.
467880	470240	Why is everyone doing weird shit with their vaginas?
470240	471240	What the fuck, dude?
471240	472840	You don't see guys out there doing this.
472840	476640	You don't see them trying to make actual cheese out of their dick cheese or whatever.
476640	481860	In fact, the few times guys do actually do something fucking weird like this, it's generally
481860	483600	at the behest of women around them.
483600	488400	Like that one chick who claimed that daily semen smoothies kept her free of the coronavirus
488400	492960	or the dude who wrote books on how to cook and mix drinks with cum after an experience
492960	498280	at a party back in 2006, where after a relevant conversation, he realized, and I'm quoting
498280	502320	here, if you want your partner to swallow, you should be willing to eat your own semen.
502320	507000	This guy even has videos making one of the drinks, the things some people will do to
507000	508000	get laid.
508000	511500	I think a lot of this ties back to the sacred womanhood sect of feminism.
511500	516140	This is a type of feminism that posits biology ruling the day, that women by virtue of being
516140	518280	female have access to a sacred energy.
518280	522440	They are connected to the sacred feminine goddess, that their vaginas are sacred life-giving
522440	523440	organs.
523440	524440	You know what I'm talking about.
524440	526380	Inside of each woman is an incredible force.
526380	530400	The sacred feminine, the divine feminine, describes our connection to the mother goddess.
530400	535080	This internal power gives us life and calls to her, discover the many facets of our feminine
535080	537740	energy and its deeply sacred essence.
537740	542160	The sacred feminine is inherently tied to the gift of life and the conception of a life-giving
542160	545520	womb in harmony with mother earth and the rest of creation.
545520	549660	It's basically just new age hippie bullshit, specifically adapted to feminism, meant to
549660	554040	imbue sex differences with a spirituality that justifies privileging women due to some
554040	555040	innate nature.
555040	558800	It's also a very trans-exclusive form of feminism because it focuses on biology, but just because
558800	561200	it rejects self-ID doesn't make it any less retarded.
561200	564540	And this is what people like Gwyneth Paltrow are tapping into when they try to sell you
564540	569880	shit like jade eggs to insert in your vag that apparently Chinese queens used to balance
569880	574240	hormones, regulate menstrual cycles, increase sexual energy, and connect the second chakra
574240	576940	to the yoni for optimal self-love and well-being.
576940	580640	This is basically Gwyneth Paltrow's entire career now, monetizing hippie dippie spiritual
580640	581640	femininity.
581640	582640	And you know what?
582640	583640	It's all bullshit.
583640	586020	Your body is still gross and disgusting if you don't wash it.
586020	589620	Nobody wants your period blood any more than they want your sweat or your piss.
589620	592100	Your vaginal yeast, your fucking vabbing, all of it.
592100	593900	It's all pretty fucking foul, guys.
593900	595660	I know, I know, don't shame me.
595660	596660	It's my natural body.
596660	597660	Yeah, I don't care.
597660	598660	This is fucking nasty.
598660	600980	Something being natural doesn't automatically make it good.
600980	605020	Do you want dudes to start gathering up all their pre-cum or dig underneath their foreskin
605020	608060	and start pabbing before dates too, you fucking animals?
608060	609060	Hey, you know what?
609060	611420	Naomi's never gonna do any of this insane stuff.
611420	614740	No woman is ever gonna be in my life if she does, so you don't gotta care what I think
614740	615740	at the end of the day.
615740	618420	But maybe you gals should, you know, listen to the experts.
618420	621020	The experts y'all are so keen to tout when it suits you.
621020	624780	TikTok users are vabbing, wearing their vaginal juices as perfume to activate their natural
624780	625780	attraction.
625780	627620	A scientist says that makes no sense.
627620	632620	Exclusive, doctors warn dangerous, vabbing TikTok trend that sees women use vaginal discharge
632620	635060	as perfume could cause thrush or even infertility.
635060	636580	Actually, you know what?
636580	637580	Keep going.
637580	640460	You ladies leaving the gene pool might do the human race a service.
640460	643100	At the very least, astrology will go back out of fashion again.
643100	645380	You know, at this point, I think I'm just a boomer.
645420	648660	I don't really use TikTok, and every time I look over there, it's like everything is
648660	650200	on fire all the time.
650200	653500	Every week, there's a new brand of retardation that pours out of that site, and it's worse
653500	654500	than Twitter is.
654500	658300	You know, I have vivid memories of being a babby dev, barely being able to stand all
658300	662280	the dumb blondes in my class at school, and then breathing a sigh of relief as the final
662280	665980	bell rang and I could go home and spend the rest of my day playing Ogre Battle on the
665980	666980	N64 or whatever.
666980	669780	And after graduation, I thought I'd left all those bitches behind.
669780	674220	But here I am as a grown ass man, and my job is to watch them continue to be retarded on
674220	675220	the internet as adults.
675220	679500	I don't know whether to be severely disappointed or grateful that this is where I am, getting
679500	682780	paid to laugh at people on the internet who frankly should be put away.
