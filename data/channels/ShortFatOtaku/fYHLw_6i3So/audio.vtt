00:00.000 --> 00:08.680
Alright, I know I said I was doing a different topic today last time, I don't remember

00:08.680 --> 00:12.520
what it was, it doesn't matter. Today we're talking about VABing. I covered this in a

00:12.520 --> 00:16.200
weekly sip a few weeks back, but in case you didn't watch it, let me give you the details.

00:16.200 --> 00:18.820
Or rather, let's let stylists give us the details.

00:18.820 --> 00:23.920
Why VABing has become a controversial TikTok trend for people who want to attract a partner.

00:23.920 --> 00:29.040
VABing, also known as vaginal dabbing, is the practice of using vaginal fluids as a

00:29.080 --> 00:36.000
perfume to attract people, and it is worryingly gaining popularity on TikTok.

00:42.240 --> 00:46.720
Now this might be a new trend on TikTok, but it's actually a lot older than that.

00:46.720 --> 00:50.760
A lot of articles being published right now promoting the positive effects of VABing

00:50.760 --> 00:54.720
mention that this practice has been known about since the 1950s, but they all cite

00:54.720 --> 00:58.880
each other without actually, you know, going back to a source. So I went digging for that source,

00:59.720 --> 01:00.720
and here's what I found.

01:00.720 --> 01:05.560
Pheromones, a new term for a class of biologically active substances, published by doctors Carlson

01:05.560 --> 01:11.120
and Lutcher, January 3rd, 1959. This was the first discovery of what we now know as a pheromone,

01:11.120 --> 01:14.580
a substance that behaves like a hormone, but instead of being secreted within the bloodstream,

01:14.580 --> 01:18.880
is actually secreted outside the animal in order to induce the desired behavior on another

01:18.880 --> 01:22.000
organism. As an example, the paper describes the sexual habits of butterflies, where the

01:22.000 --> 01:26.240
female butterfly secretes a substance that, when it comes into contact with the male butterfly's

01:26.240 --> 01:29.600
antennae, causes them to be ready to mate. We had no way of describing this chemical

01:29.600 --> 01:31.520
in 1959, so they coined the term pheromone.

01:31.520 --> 01:35.520
The science in whether or not humans have pheromones is currently not settled. This

01:35.520 --> 01:39.120
paper, Pheromones and Their Effect on Women's Mood and Sexuality, claims that humans do

01:39.120 --> 01:44.380
indeed have pheromones, specifically adrostatinone, while the textbook Neurobiology of Chemical

01:44.380 --> 01:48.180
Communication claims that adrostatinone is not actually a pheromone. Long story short,

01:48.180 --> 01:49.180
we don't know.

01:49.180 --> 01:52.000
But that's not going to stop these chicks from rubbing their pussy juice all over.

01:52.000 --> 01:57.840
Welcome to Vabbing 101. Disclaimer, I did not come up with Vabbing, but I've been doing

01:57.840 --> 02:01.960
it for a week and it's been working out for me. You don't need a whole lot of your own

02:01.960 --> 02:09.480
scents and juices for a successful VAB. Just a simple, damp VAB on your wrist and behind

02:09.480 --> 02:11.920
your neck will work perfectly fine.

02:11.920 --> 02:15.640
This is one of the videos that went viral. And man, just check out that list.

02:15.640 --> 02:21.720
So number one, make sure you shower and or bathe before you VAB. Number two, wash your

02:21.760 --> 02:25.480
hands before you VAB and of course after you VAB.

02:25.480 --> 02:29.600
You know, if your Jamba juice is so amazing, why would you need to wash up and make sure

02:29.600 --> 02:30.600
it doesn't touch anybody else?

02:30.600 --> 02:35.840
The areas you VAB normally are behind your ear and on your wrist. Those are normally

02:35.840 --> 02:41.600
surfaces that don't touch other things. So please make sure to not rub your ears or your

02:41.600 --> 02:44.120
wrists on other items and or people.

02:44.120 --> 02:48.480
Jesus Christ, I am never hugging or shaking hands with anyone ever again. This is too

02:48.480 --> 02:52.720
much for me. This chick's account is insane, by the way. It's all either VABing content

02:52.720 --> 02:56.960
or health at any size content. Listen, lady, from one fat person to another, we aren't

02:56.960 --> 02:59.880
healthy. Let's check out another VABber on TikTok.

02:59.880 --> 03:05.280
So here's how I VAB. So myself in my previous video said that I've been doing this for

03:05.280 --> 03:10.040
20 years and I have been doing this for 20 years, but I haven't been doing it for 20

03:10.040 --> 03:14.960
years and then going out and hanging out in public and asking people to sniff my pussy

03:14.960 --> 03:15.960
juice.

03:15.960 --> 03:18.040
I don't want to be around anymore.

03:18.040 --> 03:24.920
I employ VABbing or encourage VABbing and recommend it as part of like a mating ritual

03:24.920 --> 03:29.880
with a current lover that already loves your juices.

03:29.880 --> 03:33.880
Wait a minute. I thought the VABbing thing was to attract a new partner, but this lady

03:33.880 --> 03:37.440
is using it with her current one. Aren't you supposed to be applying the magic juice to

03:37.440 --> 03:39.160
attract them in the first place?

03:39.160 --> 03:44.200
The hottest thing is to have a lover who wants to devour you.

03:44.240 --> 03:46.320
Oh, my God, she's into for.

03:46.320 --> 03:48.240
Listen, I taste delicious.

03:48.240 --> 03:56.240
Like I like I like we should bottle this up and sell it because I taste delicious and

03:56.240 --> 04:00.880
I have zero shame about how I show up in this world.

04:00.880 --> 04:02.720
Thank you very much.

04:02.720 --> 04:05.040
You know, maybe a little shame is good.

04:05.040 --> 04:08.240
Yeah, there's times where shame gets out of hand, goes a little too far, but there's a

04:08.240 --> 04:14.040
golden mean, you know, and when a lover has gone down on you and then comes back up to

04:14.040 --> 04:19.600
kiss you, that's hot because everybody likes their own brand.

04:19.600 --> 04:21.720
I'm going to let you in on a little secret.

04:21.720 --> 04:25.000
All you incels out there, listen, nobody actually tastes good.

04:25.000 --> 04:28.160
If you shower and clean up nice, you know, be respectful for your partner.

04:28.160 --> 04:30.360
The best you're going to get is tasting neutral.

04:30.360 --> 04:31.640
Just just all right.

04:31.640 --> 04:33.600
Nobody actually wants to gobble that shit up.

04:33.600 --> 04:34.720
Nobody wants to bottle it.

04:34.720 --> 04:37.720
That's something that I wish Gwyneth Paltrow would have learned where she put her vag juice

04:37.720 --> 04:39.240
into a candle and tried to sell it.

04:39.240 --> 04:43.880
Pheromones are like a secreted chemical hormone and every person's pheromones smell different

04:43.920 --> 04:44.920
to different people.

04:44.920 --> 04:48.720
And in the wild, animals like secrete their pheromones to attract mates.

04:48.720 --> 04:52.280
Jesus Christ, can we keep this shit in the wild, please, lady?

04:52.280 --> 04:53.280
Get up there.

04:53.280 --> 04:54.280
Give him a swipe.

04:54.280 --> 04:57.440
You don't have to be like fresh out of the shower clean, but relatively clean.

04:57.440 --> 05:02.760
Dab, vab behind the ears, on the wrists, maybe a little on the neck.

05:02.760 --> 05:05.520
I don't want to live on this planet anymore.

05:05.520 --> 05:10.880
And I swear, if you vab, you will attract people like a day, a one night stand, or you'll

05:10.880 --> 05:12.760
just get free drinks all night.

05:12.760 --> 05:16.400
Notice how all these women are all talking about dates and one night stands and drinks.

05:16.400 --> 05:19.880
They're all deep in the hookup culture where desperate dudes are heading down to the club

05:19.880 --> 05:21.520
looking to do this shit anyway.

05:21.520 --> 05:24.360
And damn, they all look like they should be aging out of that culture at this point.

05:24.360 --> 05:28.200
I don't know what they're putting in pheromone perfume, but it can't replicate your own smell

05:28.200 --> 05:30.400
and your own personalized chemicals.

05:30.400 --> 05:32.560
Proceed with caution because it works.

05:32.560 --> 05:35.960
By the way, I learned this from the secret keepers podcast a couple of years ago.

05:35.960 --> 05:38.720
Shout out Emma and Carly.

05:38.720 --> 05:40.680
You know, we got to check that shit out.

05:40.680 --> 05:41.680
Let's give it a listen.

05:41.680 --> 05:42.680
I hunted it down.

05:42.680 --> 05:48.160
I had met this, this sexpert and she said, if a woman puts her hands in between her legs,

05:48.160 --> 05:57.920
like into her vagina juice and rubs it behind her ears, you send off your pheromones and

05:57.920 --> 06:01.980
it makes the opposite sex attracted to you fascinating.

06:01.980 --> 06:06.060
It's fascinating because it's like a boost of your, your pheromones, right?

06:06.060 --> 06:09.000
So we've been getting nonstop real thing.

06:09.000 --> 06:10.000
Yeah.

06:10.600 --> 06:14.120
When you click with someone, your, their, their pheromones, cause that's why you get

06:14.120 --> 06:16.040
close to someone and you love their smell.

06:16.040 --> 06:18.840
So all these guys were coming up to me.

06:18.840 --> 06:19.840
It was wild.

06:19.840 --> 06:22.960
So I'm sitting there and my friends like, what the fuck?

06:22.960 --> 06:24.960
She's like, what did you VAB?

06:24.960 --> 06:25.960
No way.

06:25.960 --> 06:26.960
She listens to the podcast.

06:26.960 --> 06:27.960
She goes, what did you VAB or something?

06:27.960 --> 06:28.960
I was a joke.

06:28.960 --> 06:29.960
And I went, I did.

06:29.960 --> 06:30.960
And after that?

06:30.960 --> 06:34.360
Were these guys going away or were they just lingering?

06:34.360 --> 06:41.160
They were like, like lingering, they were lingering, dude.

06:41.160 --> 06:43.600
They're lingering because they want to get laid.

06:43.600 --> 06:48.960
And you're a vapid shallow person in a vapid shallow subculture full of other vapid shallow

06:48.960 --> 06:49.960
people.

06:49.960 --> 06:54.400
It's not because you spread your snatch snot all over yourself being, you know, old man

06:54.400 --> 06:55.400
Devo.

06:55.400 --> 06:58.560
I could have sworn that I've heard of people doing this shit like a decade or two ago.

06:58.560 --> 07:03.400
I remember the whole pussy juice as perfume thing being a joke as far back as my teenage

07:03.400 --> 07:04.400
years.

07:04.400 --> 07:07.960
And though there's no solid documentation of this, it does seem to be the case.

07:07.960 --> 07:10.880
This isn't just some new, weird gen Z thing.

07:10.880 --> 07:14.320
This is an interesting video about a topic that I'm shocked.

07:14.320 --> 07:19.720
I have not made a video about this yet because I've actually been using this technique or

07:19.720 --> 07:22.920
researching it and discussing it for the past decade.

07:22.920 --> 07:28.120
But I guess the first time I ever officially put it out there was in my new book, man,

07:28.120 --> 07:29.960
millennials really do ruin everything.

07:29.960 --> 07:33.360
And there are a lot of other things that also seem to be kind of related, not just

07:33.360 --> 07:37.520
the goop vagina candle, but stuff like the free bleeding movement where women run around

07:37.520 --> 07:41.960
without tampons and you know, free bleed, or those women who have made bread or beer

07:41.960 --> 07:46.720
out of their vaginal yeast or the witches who use period blood as reagents for casting

07:46.720 --> 07:47.880
magic spells.

07:47.880 --> 07:50.240
Why is everyone doing weird shit with their vaginas?

07:50.240 --> 07:51.240
What the fuck, dude?

07:51.240 --> 07:52.840
You don't see guys out there doing this.

07:52.840 --> 07:56.640
You don't see them trying to make actual cheese out of their dick cheese or whatever.

07:56.640 --> 08:01.860
In fact, the few times guys do actually do something fucking weird like this, it's generally

08:01.860 --> 08:03.600
at the behest of women around them.

08:03.600 --> 08:08.400
Like that one chick who claimed that daily semen smoothies kept her free of the coronavirus

08:08.400 --> 08:12.960
or the dude who wrote books on how to cook and mix drinks with cum after an experience

08:12.960 --> 08:18.280
at a party back in 2006, where after a relevant conversation, he realized, and I'm quoting

08:18.280 --> 08:22.320
here, if you want your partner to swallow, you should be willing to eat your own semen.

08:22.320 --> 08:27.000
This guy even has videos making one of the drinks, the things some people will do to

08:27.000 --> 08:28.000
get laid.

08:28.000 --> 08:31.500
I think a lot of this ties back to the sacred womanhood sect of feminism.

08:31.500 --> 08:36.140
This is a type of feminism that posits biology ruling the day, that women by virtue of being

08:36.140 --> 08:38.280
female have access to a sacred energy.

08:38.280 --> 08:42.440
They are connected to the sacred feminine goddess, that their vaginas are sacred life-giving

08:42.440 --> 08:43.440
organs.

08:43.440 --> 08:44.440
You know what I'm talking about.

08:44.440 --> 08:46.380
Inside of each woman is an incredible force.

08:46.380 --> 08:50.400
The sacred feminine, the divine feminine, describes our connection to the mother goddess.

08:50.400 --> 08:55.080
This internal power gives us life and calls to her, discover the many facets of our feminine

08:55.080 --> 08:57.740
energy and its deeply sacred essence.

08:57.740 --> 09:02.160
The sacred feminine is inherently tied to the gift of life and the conception of a life-giving

09:02.160 --> 09:05.520
womb in harmony with mother earth and the rest of creation.

09:05.520 --> 09:09.660
It's basically just new age hippie bullshit, specifically adapted to feminism, meant to

09:09.660 --> 09:14.040
imbue sex differences with a spirituality that justifies privileging women due to some

09:14.040 --> 09:15.040
innate nature.

09:15.040 --> 09:18.800
It's also a very trans-exclusive form of feminism because it focuses on biology, but just because

09:18.800 --> 09:21.200
it rejects self-ID doesn't make it any less retarded.

09:21.200 --> 09:24.540
And this is what people like Gwyneth Paltrow are tapping into when they try to sell you

09:24.540 --> 09:29.880
shit like jade eggs to insert in your vag that apparently Chinese queens used to balance

09:29.880 --> 09:34.240
hormones, regulate menstrual cycles, increase sexual energy, and connect the second chakra

09:34.240 --> 09:36.940
to the yoni for optimal self-love and well-being.

09:36.940 --> 09:40.640
This is basically Gwyneth Paltrow's entire career now, monetizing hippie dippie spiritual

09:40.640 --> 09:41.640
femininity.

09:41.640 --> 09:42.640
And you know what?

09:42.640 --> 09:43.640
It's all bullshit.

09:43.640 --> 09:46.020
Your body is still gross and disgusting if you don't wash it.

09:46.020 --> 09:49.620
Nobody wants your period blood any more than they want your sweat or your piss.

09:49.620 --> 09:52.100
Your vaginal yeast, your fucking vabbing, all of it.

09:52.100 --> 09:53.900
It's all pretty fucking foul, guys.

09:53.900 --> 09:55.660
I know, I know, don't shame me.

09:55.660 --> 09:56.660
It's my natural body.

09:56.660 --> 09:57.660
Yeah, I don't care.

09:57.660 --> 09:58.660
This is fucking nasty.

09:58.660 --> 10:00.980
Something being natural doesn't automatically make it good.

10:00.980 --> 10:05.020
Do you want dudes to start gathering up all their pre-cum or dig underneath their foreskin

10:05.020 --> 10:08.060
and start pabbing before dates too, you fucking animals?

10:08.060 --> 10:09.060
Hey, you know what?

10:09.060 --> 10:11.420
Naomi's never gonna do any of this insane stuff.

10:11.420 --> 10:14.740
No woman is ever gonna be in my life if she does, so you don't gotta care what I think

10:14.740 --> 10:15.740
at the end of the day.

10:15.740 --> 10:18.420
But maybe you gals should, you know, listen to the experts.

10:18.420 --> 10:21.020
The experts y'all are so keen to tout when it suits you.

10:21.020 --> 10:24.780
TikTok users are vabbing, wearing their vaginal juices as perfume to activate their natural

10:24.780 --> 10:25.780
attraction.

10:25.780 --> 10:27.620
A scientist says that makes no sense.

10:27.620 --> 10:32.620
Exclusive, doctors warn dangerous, vabbing TikTok trend that sees women use vaginal discharge

10:32.620 --> 10:35.060
as perfume could cause thrush or even infertility.

10:35.060 --> 10:36.580
Actually, you know what?

10:36.580 --> 10:37.580
Keep going.

10:37.580 --> 10:40.460
You ladies leaving the gene pool might do the human race a service.

10:40.460 --> 10:43.100
At the very least, astrology will go back out of fashion again.

10:43.100 --> 10:45.380
You know, at this point, I think I'm just a boomer.

10:45.420 --> 10:48.660
I don't really use TikTok, and every time I look over there, it's like everything is

10:48.660 --> 10:50.200
on fire all the time.

10:50.200 --> 10:53.500
Every week, there's a new brand of retardation that pours out of that site, and it's worse

10:53.500 --> 10:54.500
than Twitter is.

10:54.500 --> 10:58.300
You know, I have vivid memories of being a babby dev, barely being able to stand all

10:58.300 --> 11:02.280
the dumb blondes in my class at school, and then breathing a sigh of relief as the final

11:02.280 --> 11:05.980
bell rang and I could go home and spend the rest of my day playing Ogre Battle on the

11:05.980 --> 11:06.980
N64 or whatever.

11:06.980 --> 11:09.780
And after graduation, I thought I'd left all those bitches behind.

11:09.780 --> 11:14.220
But here I am as a grown ass man, and my job is to watch them continue to be retarded on

11:14.220 --> 11:15.220
the internet as adults.
