1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,320
Buffy is back, and that's a good thing.

2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:05,600
AI will replace your financial advisor, and that's a good thing.

3
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:08,720
Christianity is a religion for losers, and that's a good thing.

4
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:12,000
America is not a Christian nation, and that's a good thing.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,320
Most people are single, and that's a good thing.

6
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:16,640
You're contagious, and that's a good thing.

7
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:19,440
Government funds local news, and that's a good thing.

8
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:22,480
What the hell is it with absolutely terrible journalists

9
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:26,080
ending their article headlines with the phrase, and that's a good thing?

10
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:30,480
Does it stem from the journalistic class's intrinsic need to march in lockstep?

11
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:33,040
To act like the NPCs they actually are?

12
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:34,480
Is it virtue signaling?

13
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:38,960
Where journalists will write complete garbage meant to appeal to no actual reader,

14
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:43,760
but simply so they can post the article link in their private chats and email groups

15
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:48,000
in order to show their SJW peers their daily contribution to the culture war?

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,440
Or is it simply a ham-fisted extension of the media's desire

17
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:54,160
to control the thoughts and behaviors of the populace?

18
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:58,080
Will the articles and opinion pieces not only reveal the author's positions,

19
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:01,680
but inform the reader of what their opinion should be as well?

20
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:04,160
It's kind of like the SJWs on Twitter who say,

21
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:10,000
oof, or yikes, or problematic, or toxic, or let's unpack this.

22
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:16,400
Honorable mentions go to wow, just wow, maybe, just maybe, let that sink in,

23
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,560
and this, so much this.

24
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:23,040
It's too bad that Shitlord and Yasqueenslay have depreciated.

25
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,200
They were the ones that were the most fun to abuse.

26
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:30,320
Oh well, nothing good ever comes from somebody with pronouns in their bio, I always say.

27
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:33,600
But I think it's more than just journalists informing the plebs

28
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:37,280
of the correct opinion of the day, or virtue signaling to their peers.

29
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:40,320
I genuinely think it's the beginning of a type of newspeak.

30
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:42,960
I'm sure you all understand the reference, but just in case,

31
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:48,320
newspeak is the fictional language from 1984 where the fundamental goal of the language

32
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:51,280
is to delete thoughts by deleting ways of describing them.

33
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,680
The obvious example is the word ungood.

34
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:59,600
Because the word bad no longer exists, people have to use ungood to describe negative things.

35
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:05,040
Through newspeak, nuance in language is lost, and deeper knowledge becomes harder to understand.

36
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:09,520
And because of this, it becomes significantly easier to simply classify all degrees of

37
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:13,040
unapproved behavior under one singular negative label,

38
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:16,320
with no degrees of severity to distinguish them from each other.

39
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:18,160
This might sound familiar to you.

40
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:23,040
Consider that everybody from Hitler to Jordan Peterson to Milo Yiannopoulos

41
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:27,360
to Richard Spencer to Sargon of Akkad have all been called Nazis.

42
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:31,840
Horrifyingly enough, this method of thought control actually works in real life,

43
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,520
at least to a limited extent.

44
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,680
Consider the word Islamophobia.

45
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:40,480
Phobia denotes an irrational fear, but there's certainly rational reasons to fear Islam.

46
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:44,160
But if it's all just Islamophobia, then it's all just irrational.

47
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,680
No nuance is allowed.

48
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:50,160
Sometimes it's not about the crushing of nuance in order to fill the gaps between language.

49
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:53,600
Sometimes it's about the infantilizing of a language in order to remove meaning.

50
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:56,640
Consider verified Twitter SJWs who use the word

51
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:59,680
gross to describe almost everything they disapprove of.

52
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,280
There's no deeper meaning beyond that.

53
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:05,040
It's just gross, the way that a child finds something gross.

54
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:09,440
Is it gross because it has unpleasant physical qualities, like it's slimy or something?

55
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:12,880
Is it gross because they personally don't like the thing themselves?

56
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:15,840
Or is it gross because they don't like it,

57
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:20,640
and they want to associate their subjective dislike with objective physical qualities?

58
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:24,240
The next time you see a SJW on Twitter describe something with the word

59
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:27,200
gross, politely ask them what they mean by the term.

60
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,360
I bet you'll get a blocking in response.

61
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:34,240
If you think I'm off my rocker for characterizing these dumb journalist tropes as newspeak,

62
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:36,000
then finally consider this.

63
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,960
Why do you think that so many SJWs focus on language instead of real-world activism?

64
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:44,160
Aside from being too lazy to get off social media, of course.

65
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:48,800
Why do you think they want the use of personal pronouns to be required through government force?

66
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:53,920
Or for an ever-expanding definition of hate speech to be illegal in every jurisdiction

67
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:56,240
and a bannable offense from the entire internet?

68
00:03:56,240 --> 00:04:00,320
Because they believe if you control the language, then you control the thought behind it.

69
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:01,840
And to some extent that's true.

70
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:06,240
If you have a shorthand label for an idea, it's a lot easier to explain that idea

71
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:10,320
than describing it fully every time you need to speak or write or think about it.

72
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:14,080
But what radicals fail to understand is that language naturally evolves.

73
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:17,360
It can't be socially engineered from the top down.

74
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:21,760
Just like culture or an economy or people's aptitudes can't be socially engineered from

75
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:24,640
the top down, though that certainly doesn't stop them from trying.

76
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:26,480
The tendency for journalists to say,

77
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:30,640
and that's a good thing in their articles shows you exactly what kind of people they are.

78
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:33,680
They're people who believe that through enough political force,

79
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:38,480
populations can be made to not only behave, but think in the way that they desire.

80
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,520
And that's a bad thing.

81
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,520
Heh.
