0	2320	Buffy is back, and that's a good thing.
2320	5600	AI will replace your financial advisor, and that's a good thing.
5600	8720	Christianity is a religion for losers, and that's a good thing.
8720	12000	America is not a Christian nation, and that's a good thing.
12000	14320	Most people are single, and that's a good thing.
14320	16640	You're contagious, and that's a good thing.
16640	19440	Government funds local news, and that's a good thing.
19440	22480	What the hell is it with absolutely terrible journalists
22480	26080	ending their article headlines with the phrase, and that's a good thing?
26080	30480	Does it stem from the journalistic class's intrinsic need to march in lockstep?
30480	33040	To act like the NPCs they actually are?
33040	34480	Is it virtue signaling?
34480	38960	Where journalists will write complete garbage meant to appeal to no actual reader,
38960	43760	but simply so they can post the article link in their private chats and email groups
43760	48000	in order to show their SJW peers their daily contribution to the culture war?
48000	51440	Or is it simply a ham-fisted extension of the media's desire
51440	54160	to control the thoughts and behaviors of the populace?
54160	58080	Will the articles and opinion pieces not only reveal the author's positions,
58080	61680	but inform the reader of what their opinion should be as well?
61680	64160	It's kind of like the SJWs on Twitter who say,
64160	70000	oof, or yikes, or problematic, or toxic, or let's unpack this.
70000	76400	Honorable mentions go to wow, just wow, maybe, just maybe, let that sink in,
76400	78560	and this, so much this.
78560	83040	It's too bad that Shitlord and Yasqueenslay have depreciated.
83040	85200	They were the ones that were the most fun to abuse.
85200	90320	Oh well, nothing good ever comes from somebody with pronouns in their bio, I always say.
90320	93600	But I think it's more than just journalists informing the plebs
93600	97280	of the correct opinion of the day, or virtue signaling to their peers.
97280	100320	I genuinely think it's the beginning of a type of newspeak.
100320	102960	I'm sure you all understand the reference, but just in case,
103520	108320	newspeak is the fictional language from 1984 where the fundamental goal of the language
108320	111280	is to delete thoughts by deleting ways of describing them.
111280	113680	The obvious example is the word ungood.
113680	119600	Because the word bad no longer exists, people have to use ungood to describe negative things.
119600	125040	Through newspeak, nuance in language is lost, and deeper knowledge becomes harder to understand.
125040	129520	And because of this, it becomes significantly easier to simply classify all degrees of
129520	133040	unapproved behavior under one singular negative label,
133040	136320	with no degrees of severity to distinguish them from each other.
136320	138160	This might sound familiar to you.
138160	143040	Consider that everybody from Hitler to Jordan Peterson to Milo Yiannopoulos
143040	147360	to Richard Spencer to Sargon of Akkad have all been called Nazis.
147360	151840	Horrifyingly enough, this method of thought control actually works in real life,
151840	153520	at least to a limited extent.
153520	155680	Consider the word Islamophobia.
155680	160480	Phobia denotes an irrational fear, but there's certainly rational reasons to fear Islam.
160480	164160	But if it's all just Islamophobia, then it's all just irrational.
164160	165680	No nuance is allowed.
165680	170160	Sometimes it's not about the crushing of nuance in order to fill the gaps between language.
170160	173600	Sometimes it's about the infantilizing of a language in order to remove meaning.
173600	176640	Consider verified Twitter SJWs who use the word
176640	179680	gross to describe almost everything they disapprove of.
179680	181280	There's no deeper meaning beyond that.
181280	185040	It's just gross, the way that a child finds something gross.
185040	189440	Is it gross because it has unpleasant physical qualities, like it's slimy or something?
189440	192880	Is it gross because they personally don't like the thing themselves?
192880	195840	Or is it gross because they don't like it,
195840	200640	and they want to associate their subjective dislike with objective physical qualities?
200640	204240	The next time you see a SJW on Twitter describe something with the word
204240	207200	gross, politely ask them what they mean by the term.
207200	209360	I bet you'll get a blocking in response.
209360	214240	If you think I'm off my rocker for characterizing these dumb journalist tropes as newspeak,
214240	216000	then finally consider this.
216000	220960	Why do you think that so many SJWs focus on language instead of real-world activism?
220960	224160	Aside from being too lazy to get off social media, of course.
224160	228800	Why do you think they want the use of personal pronouns to be required through government force?
228800	233920	Or for an ever-expanding definition of hate speech to be illegal in every jurisdiction
233920	236240	and a bannable offense from the entire internet?
236240	240320	Because they believe if you control the language, then you control the thought behind it.
240320	241840	And to some extent that's true.
241840	246240	If you have a shorthand label for an idea, it's a lot easier to explain that idea
246240	250320	than describing it fully every time you need to speak or write or think about it.
250320	254080	But what radicals fail to understand is that language naturally evolves.
254800	257360	It can't be socially engineered from the top down.
257360	261760	Just like culture or an economy or people's aptitudes can't be socially engineered from
261760	264640	the top down, though that certainly doesn't stop them from trying.
264640	266480	The tendency for journalists to say,
266480	270640	and that's a good thing in their articles shows you exactly what kind of people they are.
270640	273680	They're people who believe that through enough political force,
273680	278480	populations can be made to not only behave, but think in the way that they desire.
278480	279520	And that's a bad thing.
280320	281520	Heh.
