00:00.000 --> 00:02.320
Buffy is back, and that's a good thing.

00:02.320 --> 00:05.600
AI will replace your financial advisor, and that's a good thing.

00:05.600 --> 00:08.720
Christianity is a religion for losers, and that's a good thing.

00:08.720 --> 00:12.000
America is not a Christian nation, and that's a good thing.

00:12.000 --> 00:14.320
Most people are single, and that's a good thing.

00:14.320 --> 00:16.640
You're contagious, and that's a good thing.

00:16.640 --> 00:19.440
Government funds local news, and that's a good thing.

00:19.440 --> 00:22.480
What the hell is it with absolutely terrible journalists

00:22.480 --> 00:26.080
ending their article headlines with the phrase, and that's a good thing?

00:26.080 --> 00:30.480
Does it stem from the journalistic class's intrinsic need to march in lockstep?

00:30.480 --> 00:33.040
To act like the NPCs they actually are?

00:33.040 --> 00:34.480
Is it virtue signaling?

00:34.480 --> 00:38.960
Where journalists will write complete garbage meant to appeal to no actual reader,

00:38.960 --> 00:43.760
but simply so they can post the article link in their private chats and email groups

00:43.760 --> 00:48.000
in order to show their SJW peers their daily contribution to the culture war?

00:48.000 --> 00:51.440
Or is it simply a ham-fisted extension of the media's desire

00:51.440 --> 00:54.160
to control the thoughts and behaviors of the populace?

00:54.160 --> 00:58.080
Will the articles and opinion pieces not only reveal the author's positions,

00:58.080 --> 01:01.680
but inform the reader of what their opinion should be as well?

01:01.680 --> 01:04.160
It's kind of like the SJWs on Twitter who say,

01:04.160 --> 01:10.000
oof, or yikes, or problematic, or toxic, or let's unpack this.

01:10.000 --> 01:16.400
Honorable mentions go to wow, just wow, maybe, just maybe, let that sink in,

01:16.400 --> 01:18.560
and this, so much this.

01:18.560 --> 01:23.040
It's too bad that Shitlord and Yasqueenslay have depreciated.

01:23.040 --> 01:25.200
They were the ones that were the most fun to abuse.

01:25.200 --> 01:30.320
Oh well, nothing good ever comes from somebody with pronouns in their bio, I always say.

01:30.320 --> 01:33.600
But I think it's more than just journalists informing the plebs

01:33.600 --> 01:37.280
of the correct opinion of the day, or virtue signaling to their peers.

01:37.280 --> 01:40.320
I genuinely think it's the beginning of a type of newspeak.

01:40.320 --> 01:42.960
I'm sure you all understand the reference, but just in case,

01:43.520 --> 01:48.320
newspeak is the fictional language from 1984 where the fundamental goal of the language

01:48.320 --> 01:51.280
is to delete thoughts by deleting ways of describing them.

01:51.280 --> 01:53.680
The obvious example is the word ungood.

01:53.680 --> 01:59.600
Because the word bad no longer exists, people have to use ungood to describe negative things.

01:59.600 --> 02:05.040
Through newspeak, nuance in language is lost, and deeper knowledge becomes harder to understand.

02:05.040 --> 02:09.520
And because of this, it becomes significantly easier to simply classify all degrees of

02:09.520 --> 02:13.040
unapproved behavior under one singular negative label,

02:13.040 --> 02:16.320
with no degrees of severity to distinguish them from each other.

02:16.320 --> 02:18.160
This might sound familiar to you.

02:18.160 --> 02:23.040
Consider that everybody from Hitler to Jordan Peterson to Milo Yiannopoulos

02:23.040 --> 02:27.360
to Richard Spencer to Sargon of Akkad have all been called Nazis.

02:27.360 --> 02:31.840
Horrifyingly enough, this method of thought control actually works in real life,

02:31.840 --> 02:33.520
at least to a limited extent.

02:33.520 --> 02:35.680
Consider the word Islamophobia.

02:35.680 --> 02:40.480
Phobia denotes an irrational fear, but there's certainly rational reasons to fear Islam.

02:40.480 --> 02:44.160
But if it's all just Islamophobia, then it's all just irrational.

02:44.160 --> 02:45.680
No nuance is allowed.

02:45.680 --> 02:50.160
Sometimes it's not about the crushing of nuance in order to fill the gaps between language.

02:50.160 --> 02:53.600
Sometimes it's about the infantilizing of a language in order to remove meaning.

02:53.600 --> 02:56.640
Consider verified Twitter SJWs who use the word

02:56.640 --> 02:59.680
gross to describe almost everything they disapprove of.

02:59.680 --> 03:01.280
There's no deeper meaning beyond that.

03:01.280 --> 03:05.040
It's just gross, the way that a child finds something gross.

03:05.040 --> 03:09.440
Is it gross because it has unpleasant physical qualities, like it's slimy or something?

03:09.440 --> 03:12.880
Is it gross because they personally don't like the thing themselves?

03:12.880 --> 03:15.840
Or is it gross because they don't like it,

03:15.840 --> 03:20.640
and they want to associate their subjective dislike with objective physical qualities?

03:20.640 --> 03:24.240
The next time you see a SJW on Twitter describe something with the word

03:24.240 --> 03:27.200
gross, politely ask them what they mean by the term.

03:27.200 --> 03:29.360
I bet you'll get a blocking in response.

03:29.360 --> 03:34.240
If you think I'm off my rocker for characterizing these dumb journalist tropes as newspeak,

03:34.240 --> 03:36.000
then finally consider this.

03:36.000 --> 03:40.960
Why do you think that so many SJWs focus on language instead of real-world activism?

03:40.960 --> 03:44.160
Aside from being too lazy to get off social media, of course.

03:44.160 --> 03:48.800
Why do you think they want the use of personal pronouns to be required through government force?

03:48.800 --> 03:53.920
Or for an ever-expanding definition of hate speech to be illegal in every jurisdiction

03:53.920 --> 03:56.240
and a bannable offense from the entire internet?

03:56.240 --> 04:00.320
Because they believe if you control the language, then you control the thought behind it.

04:00.320 --> 04:01.840
And to some extent that's true.

04:01.840 --> 04:06.240
If you have a shorthand label for an idea, it's a lot easier to explain that idea

04:06.240 --> 04:10.320
than describing it fully every time you need to speak or write or think about it.

04:10.320 --> 04:14.080
But what radicals fail to understand is that language naturally evolves.

04:14.800 --> 04:17.360
It can't be socially engineered from the top down.

04:17.360 --> 04:21.760
Just like culture or an economy or people's aptitudes can't be socially engineered from

04:21.760 --> 04:24.640
the top down, though that certainly doesn't stop them from trying.

04:24.640 --> 04:26.480
The tendency for journalists to say,

04:26.480 --> 04:30.640
and that's a good thing in their articles shows you exactly what kind of people they are.

04:30.640 --> 04:33.680
They're people who believe that through enough political force,

04:33.680 --> 04:38.480
populations can be made to not only behave, but think in the way that they desire.

04:38.480 --> 04:39.520
And that's a bad thing.

04:40.320 --> 04:41.520
Heh.
