0	7760	Oh man guys, it's been a rough couple weeks for me.
7760	9040	Naomi's been recovering from surgery.
9040	12320	If you don't watch the gaming streams, or if you don't pay attention to Twitter, or
12320	15480	the community posts, or Discord, or anything really, here's the scoop.
15480	18520	Naomi's been recovering from surgery, and I've been the one who's been taking care
18520	19520	of her.
19520	20520	Meanwhile, the house that I rent is being sold.
20520	23760	I'm not in any danger of being evicted, the new landlord just has to take over the
23760	24760	old contract.
24760	27160	I've had to deal with people showing up in the house to view it, there were something
27160	29000	like 50 people here this past weekend.
29000	31280	I've had a very busy past couple of weeks.
31280	33800	A whole new cycle has, once again, passed me by.
33800	35600	That seems to be a regular occurrence with me.
35600	38480	So starting tomorrow I am going to try to play catch up with some videos.
38480	42360	I'm going to talk about the city bike thing, the black guy getting choked in the subway
42360	44440	thing, probably going to talk about Mizzie at some point.
44440	49080	Right now it is TikTok Tuesday time, let's get going my friends.
49080	51800	And thanks for sticking with me by the way, I do appreciate it.
51800	54240	Oh god, starting off strong, Jesus.
54240	56960	Is this like an environmental thing in the UK?
57960	60120	Oh, there goes his phone!
60120	61120	Damn.
61120	67440	Yeah, I don't know if you've seen these videos before, but there's always like, environmentalists
67440	71600	who just passively get pushed over by random passerby who don't want to deal with this
71600	72600	nonsense.
72600	75080	It's like, get out of the bus lane!
75080	78240	Like none of them are fighting him, and they could all take him if they wanted, but he's
78240	80200	just pissed.
80200	81200	He's done with this nonsense.
81200	83440	It's like, get out of the bus lane!
83440	85440	These people are annoying, dude.
85920	91000	You know, I don't, I'm not condoning violence, but these people are annoying, they're fucking
91000	92000	annoying.
92000	93000	I hate this shit.
93000	95240	Like what are they, what are they actually doing?
95240	98440	They're making random people angry at them.
100440	101440	Goddamn.
101440	104800	Like, no one's going to join them now.
104800	108520	They haven't inconvenienced anyone, certainly not anybody in power, certainly not anyone
108520	110440	that can affect what they want.
111440	120440	It's like, they're just standing in front of the car, why?
120440	124000	This is just, this will just waste moral oil because these people still got to drive around,
124000	125000	you know?
125000	127440	The fucking entitlement of these activists.
127440	131240	You know, I get it, like if there's something major going on, there's a massive breakdown
131240	136200	of society, you have no choice but to clog up the roads to get your point across because
136200	138320	everything else is dysfunctional, I understand.
138320	139520	But do you think that we're really there?
139600	143600	Do you think that this nonsense, just walking down a random side street in a city, preventing
143600	146320	buses from going through, is that going to help your cause?
146320	147320	These people are fucking retarded.
147320	152320	So I met this guy at the gym that I used to go to, and he was hot as F, he was covered
152320	155320	in tabs, he was a little bit older than me because that's how I like it.
155320	156320	Of course.
156320	160320	And then one day I asked if he wanted to make a video.
160320	164320	And we got caught out because when we were leaving, we had a staff member hanging around
164320	166320	outside, and we were kind of like, this looks dodgy.
167120	173120	And then the next day, the manager went up to him and said there was a handprint on the
173120	177120	window in the posy room and wondered if he knew anything about that.
177120	183120	Word got out, people watched it, and we literally got banned from our gym.
183120	184120	What?
184120	187920	So I have to assume this is like an OnlyFans thought.
187920	193120	She just decided to make a video with a random guy at the gym and had sex in the gym, then
193120	194120	got banned from the gym?
194920	197920	Remember like a few months ago, there was that one girl who's like, don't look at me
197920	198920	in the gym.
198920	199920	And that went viral.
199920	200920	This is like the inverse of that.
200920	204920	There are countless obstacles that made this year from a school shooting to having no idea
204920	206920	what life is going to look like after school shooting.
206920	208920	Supportive Mental Health Awareness Month.
208920	212920	I'm partnering with viewers to strip away the stigma of anxiety.
212920	213920	We want you to get your all out.
213920	216920	Not only what's in your pores, but most importantly, what's on your mind too.
216920	223920	Oh, oh my God, dude, dude, I survived a school shooting.
223920	225920	I'm going to sell you these nose strips.
225920	226920	Thanks for the check.
226920	228920	Is that what it takes to get a sponsorship on your channel?
228920	230920	Do I got to go out and survive a shooting?
230920	231920	Is that what I got to do?
231920	234920	Thieves try to walk out with a cart full of groceries.
234920	236920	What are the one of those looting?
236920	237920	Oh my God.
237920	239920	They're just walking out.
239920	240920	What the, what the fuck?
240920	242920	Ladies, what are you doing?
247920	251920	I'm actually kind of happy that all this, all this looting and all this of just rampant
251920	255920	theft and shoplifting is finally being confronted.
255920	257920	Like, you shouldn't be able to do this.
257920	259920	These bitches should be locked up.
259920	261920	Like, what the fuck, man?
265920	269920	Ow, ow, you're hurting me as I try to steal from you.
272920	275920	Seriously, like, fuck these bitches, dude.
282920	287920	Oh, is she going to grab the picture?
287920	288920	Oh my God.
288920	291920	Oh my God, she's going to hit someone with it.
291920	293920	Now it's assault, lady.
293920	295920	Like, what the fuck?
297920	299920	What the fuck, dude?
299920	311920	Jesus.
311920	312920	Fuck these people, man.
312920	314920	Like, this is actually disgusting.
314920	315920	Damn.
315920	316920	Man.
316920	321920	They did all that just for some Gatorade?
321920	324920	They actually got away with it.
324920	325920	Gatorade, man.
325920	327920	You need your electrolytes.
327920	333920	Man, that book that is sitting there in defense of looting, it keeps calling to me every single
333920	334920	TikTok Tuesday.
334920	337920	I just keep, it sits there on the shelf taunting me.
337920	341920	I'm an activist teacher here and I just got to be reading a book about racism.
341920	349920	And did you guys know that going to the bathroom in a toilet and indoor plumbing is actually
349920	351920	from white supremacy and colonialism?
351920	352920	This has to be fake.
352920	358920	So when the white colonists saw the indigenous that they were digging holes and going to
358920	361920	the bathroom outside, they said that that was more like animals.
361920	362920	It is.
362920	368920	And the white colonists decided to have indoor plumbing and toilets to use the bathroom.
368920	369920	Awesome.
369920	375920	And so I just want you to recognize that whenever you are using a toilet, you're basically paying
375920	379920	homage to white supremacy and white colonists.
379920	380920	Okay.
380920	381920	Okay.
381920	383920	That, I don't know.
383920	386920	My, my bullshit alarm is tingling.
386920	387920	I don't know.
387920	388920	My bullshit senses are tingling.
388920	390920	That, that seems like that one might be like a fake.
390920	396920	That one might be someone who's like larping as a Prague or trolling or something like,
396920	399920	hmm, that's a bit too on the nose.
399920	403920	You know, I was convinced for the first half of it, but eventually it was like, hmm, I
403920	404920	don't know.
404920	405920	But you know what?
406920	411920	If this person actually ended up being a real honest to God activist teacher, wouldn't be
411920	412920	surprised.
412920	414920	This one's got no audio.
414920	418920	Oh, what the, and she goes to block.
418920	419920	Okay, hold on.
419920	425240	I got to play that a couple more times cause it's too, it's too short, but it looks like
425240	428920	there's just, they're doing some sort of fetish thing in real life, right?
428920	435040	Like IRL, it looks like there's a guy and then there's, it may be a girl, but in like
435040	440040	a dog position and he's got like a leash, there's a racial component here, obviously.
440040	441040	And it's at the bus stop.
441040	444380	And once the girl in pink notices that it's being recorded, she walks over and blocks
444380	445380	it.
445380	446380	It's like, why block it?
446380	448500	I mean, you're proud enough to be doing this outside.
448500	450040	They're clearly fine with it.
450040	460040	Oh, another fight video, shotlifting video, your food.
460040	464040	Did you pay for it?
464040	472560	Well, yep.
472560	475040	It sounds like she didn't pay for it.
475040	476040	Yep.
476040	482040	Wait, wait, wait, what?
482040	485860	You work three, if you're working three jobs, how is it that you don't have enough money
485860	486860	to feed your family?
486860	488900	You know, three jobs, minimum wage.
488900	491720	Even if you're a waitress, you're still making some tips.
491720	493980	Working three jobs, you should be able to feed your family.
493980	495340	Where's all that money going, lady?
495340	497340	In any case, it doesn't excuse stealing.
497340	498340	Fuck you.
498340	499340	Oh man.
499340	502060	Oh, like mother, like daughter.
502060	504660	Holy, holy, holy shit.
504660	506660	That's oh my God.
506660	511620	Imagine how much stuff that drags up, like how much it tracks.
511620	515180	Imagine walking into like a public restroom and just having that thing trail behind you
515180	516180	for 20 feet.
516180	517180	Jesus.
517180	518500	Oh, fuck.
518500	519500	Why would you do that?
519500	521220	Why would you do that, lady?
521220	523020	This is some clown world ass shit.
523020	527260	African people stay here, Jamaican people stay here, white people stay here, Spanish
527260	529900	people stay here, and black Americans stay here.
529900	535660	I'm not saying not all black Americans are bad, but the ones that came to my place have
535660	537660	been nothing but a problem.
537660	540140	Only two good ones came here, all of them.
540140	545180	Fight late at night, not with me, with each other, the disrespectful, the entitled, the
545180	546180	unappreciative.
546180	547180	Must be an Airbnb.
547180	551620	And it goes that way because America has spoiled them and give them so much free shit when
551620	555300	they think they could come to Jamaica and get the same free shit out here and be nasty
555300	556300	about it.
556300	559980	I'm not saying all of you are like that, but because of that, I'm not risking my health
559980	562340	and my happiness for people.
562340	564100	No short-term stay.
564100	565100	No short-term stay.
565100	566580	It's not going to happen here.
566580	571220	I'm going to eat salt and banana and let goats and cows live into my houses, then I'll help
571220	572220	you come here and stress.
572220	574900	I will not hate my business because of customers.
574900	575900	Man.
575900	579300	Gotta tell her she's being a racist, guys.
579300	586660	You gotta tell her she's being a racist for not wanting black Americans to show up, even
586660	588620	though she's black herself.
588620	592820	This is one of those things where like, yeah, she is actually being racist, but she's gained
592820	599220	this mindset through repeated exposure to bad experiences by bad black Americans.
599220	605340	It's one of those things where I don't approve, but I understand.
605340	607340	What the fuck?
607340	609900	Oh my God.
609900	612640	Justin Trudeau.
612640	614700	What the shit is this?
614700	621660	Blackface is back on the menu, boys.
621660	623660	I'm now super straight.
623660	624660	Why?
624660	625660	Why?
625660	649660	You're not one of them, though, are you, dude?
649660	657980	What the fuck?
657980	658980	Oh my God.
658980	659980	The Mormons.
659980	672660	The Mormons aren't going to like that.
672660	675780	What does this have to do with nature or the North face?
675780	676780	Like what the...
676780	682900	It really feels like there's finally serious pushback against the rainbow capitalist nonsense.
682900	686660	Against just the overwhelming rainbow vomit that is the month of June.
686660	687980	There's finally pushback.
687980	691060	I've been waiting for it for like five fucking years.
691060	692540	Thank God it's actually happening.
692540	694660	All right, my friends, that about does it for me today.
694660	698740	I hope you enjoyed the cancer that I have now inflicted upon you.
698740	700740	Make sure to get some chemo before we do next week.
700740	703020	I will see you guys next time.
703020	703620	I love you.
