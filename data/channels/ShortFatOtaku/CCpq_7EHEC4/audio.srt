1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,760
Oh man guys, it's been a rough couple weeks for me.

2
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:09,040
Naomi's been recovering from surgery.

3
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:12,320
If you don't watch the gaming streams, or if you don't pay attention to Twitter, or

4
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:15,480
the community posts, or Discord, or anything really, here's the scoop.

5
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:18,520
Naomi's been recovering from surgery, and I've been the one who's been taking care

6
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:19,520
of her.

7
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:20,520
Meanwhile, the house that I rent is being sold.

8
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:23,760
I'm not in any danger of being evicted, the new landlord just has to take over the

9
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:24,760
old contract.

10
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:27,160
I've had to deal with people showing up in the house to view it, there were something

11
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:29,000
like 50 people here this past weekend.

12
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,280
I've had a very busy past couple of weeks.

13
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:33,800
A whole new cycle has, once again, passed me by.

14
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:35,600
That seems to be a regular occurrence with me.

15
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:38,480
So starting tomorrow I am going to try to play catch up with some videos.

16
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:42,360
I'm going to talk about the city bike thing, the black guy getting choked in the subway

17
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:44,440
thing, probably going to talk about Mizzie at some point.

18
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:49,080
Right now it is TikTok Tuesday time, let's get going my friends.

19
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:51,800
And thanks for sticking with me by the way, I do appreciate it.

20
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:54,240
Oh god, starting off strong, Jesus.

21
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:56,960
Is this like an environmental thing in the UK?

22
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:00,120
Oh, there goes his phone!

23
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:01,120
Damn.

24
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:07,440
Yeah, I don't know if you've seen these videos before, but there's always like, environmentalists

25
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:11,600
who just passively get pushed over by random passerby who don't want to deal with this

26
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:12,600
nonsense.

27
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:15,080
It's like, get out of the bus lane!

28
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:18,240
Like none of them are fighting him, and they could all take him if they wanted, but he's

29
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:20,200
just pissed.

30
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:21,200
He's done with this nonsense.

31
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,440
It's like, get out of the bus lane!

32
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:25,440
These people are annoying, dude.

33
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:31,000
You know, I don't, I'm not condoning violence, but these people are annoying, they're fucking

34
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
annoying.

35
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I hate this shit.

36
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,240
Like what are they, what are they actually doing?

37
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:38,440
They're making random people angry at them.

38
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:41,440
Goddamn.

39
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:44,800
Like, no one's going to join them now.

40
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:48,520
They haven't inconvenienced anyone, certainly not anybody in power, certainly not anyone

41
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:50,440
that can affect what they want.

42
00:01:51,440 --> 00:02:00,440
It's like, they're just standing in front of the car, why?

43
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:04,000
This is just, this will just waste moral oil because these people still got to drive around,

44
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
you know?

45
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,440
The fucking entitlement of these activists.

46
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:11,240
You know, I get it, like if there's something major going on, there's a massive breakdown

47
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:16,200
of society, you have no choice but to clog up the roads to get your point across because

48
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:18,320
everything else is dysfunctional, I understand.

49
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:19,520
But do you think that we're really there?

50
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:23,600
Do you think that this nonsense, just walking down a random side street in a city, preventing

51
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:26,320
buses from going through, is that going to help your cause?

52
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:27,320
These people are fucking retarded.

53
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:32,320
So I met this guy at the gym that I used to go to, and he was hot as F, he was covered

54
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:35,320
in tabs, he was a little bit older than me because that's how I like it.

55
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:36,320
Of course.

56
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:40,320
And then one day I asked if he wanted to make a video.

57
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:44,320
And we got caught out because when we were leaving, we had a staff member hanging around

58
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:46,320
outside, and we were kind of like, this looks dodgy.

59
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:53,120
And then the next day, the manager went up to him and said there was a handprint on the

60
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:57,120
window in the posy room and wondered if he knew anything about that.

61
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:03,120
Word got out, people watched it, and we literally got banned from our gym.

62
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,120
What?

63
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:07,920
So I have to assume this is like an OnlyFans thought.

64
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:13,120
She just decided to make a video with a random guy at the gym and had sex in the gym, then

65
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,120
got banned from the gym?

66
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:17,920
Remember like a few months ago, there was that one girl who's like, don't look at me

67
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:18,920
in the gym.

68
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:19,920
And that went viral.

69
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:20,920
This is like the inverse of that.

70
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:24,920
There are countless obstacles that made this year from a school shooting to having no idea

71
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:26,920
what life is going to look like after school shooting.

72
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:28,920
Supportive Mental Health Awareness Month.

73
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:32,920
I'm partnering with viewers to strip away the stigma of anxiety.

74
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:33,920
We want you to get your all out.

75
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:36,920
Not only what's in your pores, but most importantly, what's on your mind too.

76
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:43,920
Oh, oh my God, dude, dude, I survived a school shooting.

77
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,920
I'm going to sell you these nose strips.

78
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:46,920
Thanks for the check.

79
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:48,920
Is that what it takes to get a sponsorship on your channel?

80
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:50,920
Do I got to go out and survive a shooting?

81
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:51,920
Is that what I got to do?

82
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:54,920
Thieves try to walk out with a cart full of groceries.

83
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:56,920
What are the one of those looting?

84
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:57,920
Oh my God.

85
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,920
They're just walking out.

86
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:00,920
What the, what the fuck?

87
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:02,920
Ladies, what are you doing?

88
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:11,920
I'm actually kind of happy that all this, all this looting and all this of just rampant

89
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:15,920
theft and shoplifting is finally being confronted.

90
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,920
Like, you shouldn't be able to do this.

91
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,920
These bitches should be locked up.

92
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,920
Like, what the fuck, man?

93
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:29,920
Ow, ow, you're hurting me as I try to steal from you.

94
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:35,920
Seriously, like, fuck these bitches, dude.

95
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:47,920
Oh, is she going to grab the picture?

96
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:48,920
Oh my God.

97
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:51,920
Oh my God, she's going to hit someone with it.

98
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,920
Now it's assault, lady.

99
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,920
Like, what the fuck?

100
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,920
What the fuck, dude?

101
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:11,920
Jesus.

102
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:12,920
Fuck these people, man.

103
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:14,920
Like, this is actually disgusting.

104
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:15,920
Damn.

105
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:16,920
Man.

106
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:21,920
They did all that just for some Gatorade?

107
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:24,920
They actually got away with it.

108
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:25,920
Gatorade, man.

109
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,920
You need your electrolytes.

110
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:33,920
Man, that book that is sitting there in defense of looting, it keeps calling to me every single

111
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:34,920
TikTok Tuesday.

112
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:37,920
I just keep, it sits there on the shelf taunting me.

113
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:41,920
I'm an activist teacher here and I just got to be reading a book about racism.

114
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:49,920
And did you guys know that going to the bathroom in a toilet and indoor plumbing is actually

115
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:51,920
from white supremacy and colonialism?

116
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:52,920
This has to be fake.

117
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:58,920
So when the white colonists saw the indigenous that they were digging holes and going to

118
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:01,920
the bathroom outside, they said that that was more like animals.

119
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:02,920
It is.

120
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:08,920
And the white colonists decided to have indoor plumbing and toilets to use the bathroom.

121
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:09,920
Awesome.

122
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:15,920
And so I just want you to recognize that whenever you are using a toilet, you're basically paying

123
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:19,920
homage to white supremacy and white colonists.

124
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:20,920
Okay.

125
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:21,920
Okay.

126
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,920
That, I don't know.

127
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:26,920
My, my bullshit alarm is tingling.

128
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:27,920
I don't know.

129
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:28,920
My bullshit senses are tingling.

130
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,920
That, that seems like that one might be like a fake.

131
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:36,920
That one might be someone who's like larping as a Prague or trolling or something like,

132
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:39,920
hmm, that's a bit too on the nose.

133
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:43,920
You know, I was convinced for the first half of it, but eventually it was like, hmm, I

134
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:44,920
don't know.

135
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:45,920
But you know what?

136
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:51,920
If this person actually ended up being a real honest to God activist teacher, wouldn't be

137
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:52,920
surprised.

138
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,920
This one's got no audio.

139
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:58,920
Oh, what the, and she goes to block.

140
00:06:58,920 --> 00:06:59,920
Okay, hold on.

141
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:05,240
I got to play that a couple more times cause it's too, it's too short, but it looks like

142
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:08,920
there's just, they're doing some sort of fetish thing in real life, right?

143
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:15,040
Like IRL, it looks like there's a guy and then there's, it may be a girl, but in like

144
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:20,040
a dog position and he's got like a leash, there's a racial component here, obviously.

145
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,040
And it's at the bus stop.

146
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:24,380
And once the girl in pink notices that it's being recorded, she walks over and blocks

147
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:25,380
it.

148
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:26,380
It's like, why block it?

149
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:28,500
I mean, you're proud enough to be doing this outside.

150
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:30,040
They're clearly fine with it.

151
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:40,040
Oh, another fight video, shotlifting video, your food.

152
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:44,040
Did you pay for it?

153
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:52,560
Well, yep.

154
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:55,040
It sounds like she didn't pay for it.

155
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,040
Yep.

156
00:07:56,040 --> 00:08:02,040
Wait, wait, wait, what?

157
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:05,860
You work three, if you're working three jobs, how is it that you don't have enough money

158
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:06,860
to feed your family?

159
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:08,900
You know, three jobs, minimum wage.

160
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:11,720
Even if you're a waitress, you're still making some tips.

161
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:13,980
Working three jobs, you should be able to feed your family.

162
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:15,340
Where's all that money going, lady?

163
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:17,340
In any case, it doesn't excuse stealing.

164
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:18,340
Fuck you.

165
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:19,340
Oh man.

166
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:22,060
Oh, like mother, like daughter.

167
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:24,660
Holy, holy, holy shit.

168
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:26,660
That's oh my God.

169
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:31,620
Imagine how much stuff that drags up, like how much it tracks.

170
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:35,180
Imagine walking into like a public restroom and just having that thing trail behind you

171
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:36,180
for 20 feet.

172
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:37,180
Jesus.

173
00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:38,500
Oh, fuck.

174
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:39,500
Why would you do that?

175
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:41,220
Why would you do that, lady?

176
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:43,020
This is some clown world ass shit.

177
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:47,260
African people stay here, Jamaican people stay here, white people stay here, Spanish

178
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:49,900
people stay here, and black Americans stay here.

179
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:55,660
I'm not saying not all black Americans are bad, but the ones that came to my place have

180
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:57,660
been nothing but a problem.

181
00:08:57,660 --> 00:09:00,140
Only two good ones came here, all of them.

182
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:05,180
Fight late at night, not with me, with each other, the disrespectful, the entitled, the

183
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:06,180
unappreciative.

184
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:07,180
Must be an Airbnb.

185
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:11,620
And it goes that way because America has spoiled them and give them so much free shit when

186
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:15,300
they think they could come to Jamaica and get the same free shit out here and be nasty

187
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:16,300
about it.

188
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:19,980
I'm not saying all of you are like that, but because of that, I'm not risking my health

189
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:22,340
and my happiness for people.

190
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:24,100
No short-term stay.

191
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:25,100
No short-term stay.

192
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:26,580
It's not going to happen here.

193
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:31,220
I'm going to eat salt and banana and let goats and cows live into my houses, then I'll help

194
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:32,220
you come here and stress.

195
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:34,900
I will not hate my business because of customers.

196
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:35,900
Man.

197
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:39,300
Gotta tell her she's being a racist, guys.

198
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:46,660
You gotta tell her she's being a racist for not wanting black Americans to show up, even

199
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:48,620
though she's black herself.

200
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:52,820
This is one of those things where like, yeah, she is actually being racist, but she's gained

201
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:59,220
this mindset through repeated exposure to bad experiences by bad black Americans.

202
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:05,340
It's one of those things where I don't approve, but I understand.

203
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:07,340
What the fuck?

204
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:09,900
Oh my God.

205
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:12,640
Justin Trudeau.

206
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,700
What the shit is this?

207
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:21,660
Blackface is back on the menu, boys.

208
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:23,660
I'm now super straight.

209
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:24,660
Why?

210
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:25,660
Why?

211
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:49,660
You're not one of them, though, are you, dude?

212
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:57,980
What the fuck?

213
00:10:57,980 --> 00:10:58,980
Oh my God.

214
00:10:58,980 --> 00:10:59,980
The Mormons.

215
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:12,660
The Mormons aren't going to like that.

216
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:15,780
What does this have to do with nature or the North face?

217
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:16,780
Like what the...

218
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:22,900
It really feels like there's finally serious pushback against the rainbow capitalist nonsense.

219
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:26,660
Against just the overwhelming rainbow vomit that is the month of June.

220
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:27,980
There's finally pushback.

221
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:31,060
I've been waiting for it for like five fucking years.

222
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:32,540
Thank God it's actually happening.

223
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:34,660
All right, my friends, that about does it for me today.

224
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:38,740
I hope you enjoyed the cancer that I have now inflicted upon you.

225
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:40,740
Make sure to get some chemo before we do next week.

226
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:43,020
I will see you guys next time.

227
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:43,620
I love you.
