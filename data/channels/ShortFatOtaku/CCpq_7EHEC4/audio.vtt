00:00.000 --> 00:07.760
Oh man guys, it's been a rough couple weeks for me.

00:07.760 --> 00:09.040
Naomi's been recovering from surgery.

00:09.040 --> 00:12.320
If you don't watch the gaming streams, or if you don't pay attention to Twitter, or

00:12.320 --> 00:15.480
the community posts, or Discord, or anything really, here's the scoop.

00:15.480 --> 00:18.520
Naomi's been recovering from surgery, and I've been the one who's been taking care

00:18.520 --> 00:19.520
of her.

00:19.520 --> 00:20.520
Meanwhile, the house that I rent is being sold.

00:20.520 --> 00:23.760
I'm not in any danger of being evicted, the new landlord just has to take over the

00:23.760 --> 00:24.760
old contract.

00:24.760 --> 00:27.160
I've had to deal with people showing up in the house to view it, there were something

00:27.160 --> 00:29.000
like 50 people here this past weekend.

00:29.000 --> 00:31.280
I've had a very busy past couple of weeks.

00:31.280 --> 00:33.800
A whole new cycle has, once again, passed me by.

00:33.800 --> 00:35.600
That seems to be a regular occurrence with me.

00:35.600 --> 00:38.480
So starting tomorrow I am going to try to play catch up with some videos.

00:38.480 --> 00:42.360
I'm going to talk about the city bike thing, the black guy getting choked in the subway

00:42.360 --> 00:44.440
thing, probably going to talk about Mizzie at some point.

00:44.440 --> 00:49.080
Right now it is TikTok Tuesday time, let's get going my friends.

00:49.080 --> 00:51.800
And thanks for sticking with me by the way, I do appreciate it.

00:51.800 --> 00:54.240
Oh god, starting off strong, Jesus.

00:54.240 --> 00:56.960
Is this like an environmental thing in the UK?

00:57.960 --> 01:00.120
Oh, there goes his phone!

01:00.120 --> 01:01.120
Damn.

01:01.120 --> 01:07.440
Yeah, I don't know if you've seen these videos before, but there's always like, environmentalists

01:07.440 --> 01:11.600
who just passively get pushed over by random passerby who don't want to deal with this

01:11.600 --> 01:12.600
nonsense.

01:12.600 --> 01:15.080
It's like, get out of the bus lane!

01:15.080 --> 01:18.240
Like none of them are fighting him, and they could all take him if they wanted, but he's

01:18.240 --> 01:20.200
just pissed.

01:20.200 --> 01:21.200
He's done with this nonsense.

01:21.200 --> 01:23.440
It's like, get out of the bus lane!

01:23.440 --> 01:25.440
These people are annoying, dude.

01:25.920 --> 01:31.000
You know, I don't, I'm not condoning violence, but these people are annoying, they're fucking

01:31.000 --> 01:32.000
annoying.

01:32.000 --> 01:33.000
I hate this shit.

01:33.000 --> 01:35.240
Like what are they, what are they actually doing?

01:35.240 --> 01:38.440
They're making random people angry at them.

01:40.440 --> 01:41.440
Goddamn.

01:41.440 --> 01:44.800
Like, no one's going to join them now.

01:44.800 --> 01:48.520
They haven't inconvenienced anyone, certainly not anybody in power, certainly not anyone

01:48.520 --> 01:50.440
that can affect what they want.

01:51.440 --> 02:00.440
It's like, they're just standing in front of the car, why?

02:00.440 --> 02:04.000
This is just, this will just waste moral oil because these people still got to drive around,

02:04.000 --> 02:05.000
you know?

02:05.000 --> 02:07.440
The fucking entitlement of these activists.

02:07.440 --> 02:11.240
You know, I get it, like if there's something major going on, there's a massive breakdown

02:11.240 --> 02:16.200
of society, you have no choice but to clog up the roads to get your point across because

02:16.200 --> 02:18.320
everything else is dysfunctional, I understand.

02:18.320 --> 02:19.520
But do you think that we're really there?

02:19.600 --> 02:23.600
Do you think that this nonsense, just walking down a random side street in a city, preventing

02:23.600 --> 02:26.320
buses from going through, is that going to help your cause?

02:26.320 --> 02:27.320
These people are fucking retarded.

02:27.320 --> 02:32.320
So I met this guy at the gym that I used to go to, and he was hot as F, he was covered

02:32.320 --> 02:35.320
in tabs, he was a little bit older than me because that's how I like it.

02:35.320 --> 02:36.320
Of course.

02:36.320 --> 02:40.320
And then one day I asked if he wanted to make a video.

02:40.320 --> 02:44.320
And we got caught out because when we were leaving, we had a staff member hanging around

02:44.320 --> 02:46.320
outside, and we were kind of like, this looks dodgy.

02:47.120 --> 02:53.120
And then the next day, the manager went up to him and said there was a handprint on the

02:53.120 --> 02:57.120
window in the posy room and wondered if he knew anything about that.

02:57.120 --> 03:03.120
Word got out, people watched it, and we literally got banned from our gym.

03:03.120 --> 03:04.120
What?

03:04.120 --> 03:07.920
So I have to assume this is like an OnlyFans thought.

03:07.920 --> 03:13.120
She just decided to make a video with a random guy at the gym and had sex in the gym, then

03:13.120 --> 03:14.120
got banned from the gym?

03:14.920 --> 03:17.920
Remember like a few months ago, there was that one girl who's like, don't look at me

03:17.920 --> 03:18.920
in the gym.

03:18.920 --> 03:19.920
And that went viral.

03:19.920 --> 03:20.920
This is like the inverse of that.

03:20.920 --> 03:24.920
There are countless obstacles that made this year from a school shooting to having no idea

03:24.920 --> 03:26.920
what life is going to look like after school shooting.

03:26.920 --> 03:28.920
Supportive Mental Health Awareness Month.

03:28.920 --> 03:32.920
I'm partnering with viewers to strip away the stigma of anxiety.

03:32.920 --> 03:33.920
We want you to get your all out.

03:33.920 --> 03:36.920
Not only what's in your pores, but most importantly, what's on your mind too.

03:36.920 --> 03:43.920
Oh, oh my God, dude, dude, I survived a school shooting.

03:43.920 --> 03:45.920
I'm going to sell you these nose strips.

03:45.920 --> 03:46.920
Thanks for the check.

03:46.920 --> 03:48.920
Is that what it takes to get a sponsorship on your channel?

03:48.920 --> 03:50.920
Do I got to go out and survive a shooting?

03:50.920 --> 03:51.920
Is that what I got to do?

03:51.920 --> 03:54.920
Thieves try to walk out with a cart full of groceries.

03:54.920 --> 03:56.920
What are the one of those looting?

03:56.920 --> 03:57.920
Oh my God.

03:57.920 --> 03:59.920
They're just walking out.

03:59.920 --> 04:00.920
What the, what the fuck?

04:00.920 --> 04:02.920
Ladies, what are you doing?

04:07.920 --> 04:11.920
I'm actually kind of happy that all this, all this looting and all this of just rampant

04:11.920 --> 04:15.920
theft and shoplifting is finally being confronted.

04:15.920 --> 04:17.920
Like, you shouldn't be able to do this.

04:17.920 --> 04:19.920
These bitches should be locked up.

04:19.920 --> 04:21.920
Like, what the fuck, man?

04:25.920 --> 04:29.920
Ow, ow, you're hurting me as I try to steal from you.

04:32.920 --> 04:35.920
Seriously, like, fuck these bitches, dude.

04:42.920 --> 04:47.920
Oh, is she going to grab the picture?

04:47.920 --> 04:48.920
Oh my God.

04:48.920 --> 04:51.920
Oh my God, she's going to hit someone with it.

04:51.920 --> 04:53.920
Now it's assault, lady.

04:53.920 --> 04:55.920
Like, what the fuck?

04:57.920 --> 04:59.920
What the fuck, dude?

04:59.920 --> 05:11.920
Jesus.

05:11.920 --> 05:12.920
Fuck these people, man.

05:12.920 --> 05:14.920
Like, this is actually disgusting.

05:14.920 --> 05:15.920
Damn.

05:15.920 --> 05:16.920
Man.

05:16.920 --> 05:21.920
They did all that just for some Gatorade?

05:21.920 --> 05:24.920
They actually got away with it.

05:24.920 --> 05:25.920
Gatorade, man.

05:25.920 --> 05:27.920
You need your electrolytes.

05:27.920 --> 05:33.920
Man, that book that is sitting there in defense of looting, it keeps calling to me every single

05:33.920 --> 05:34.920
TikTok Tuesday.

05:34.920 --> 05:37.920
I just keep, it sits there on the shelf taunting me.

05:37.920 --> 05:41.920
I'm an activist teacher here and I just got to be reading a book about racism.

05:41.920 --> 05:49.920
And did you guys know that going to the bathroom in a toilet and indoor plumbing is actually

05:49.920 --> 05:51.920
from white supremacy and colonialism?

05:51.920 --> 05:52.920
This has to be fake.

05:52.920 --> 05:58.920
So when the white colonists saw the indigenous that they were digging holes and going to

05:58.920 --> 06:01.920
the bathroom outside, they said that that was more like animals.

06:01.920 --> 06:02.920
It is.

06:02.920 --> 06:08.920
And the white colonists decided to have indoor plumbing and toilets to use the bathroom.

06:08.920 --> 06:09.920
Awesome.

06:09.920 --> 06:15.920
And so I just want you to recognize that whenever you are using a toilet, you're basically paying

06:15.920 --> 06:19.920
homage to white supremacy and white colonists.

06:19.920 --> 06:20.920
Okay.

06:20.920 --> 06:21.920
Okay.

06:21.920 --> 06:23.920
That, I don't know.

06:23.920 --> 06:26.920
My, my bullshit alarm is tingling.

06:26.920 --> 06:27.920
I don't know.

06:27.920 --> 06:28.920
My bullshit senses are tingling.

06:28.920 --> 06:30.920
That, that seems like that one might be like a fake.

06:30.920 --> 06:36.920
That one might be someone who's like larping as a Prague or trolling or something like,

06:36.920 --> 06:39.920
hmm, that's a bit too on the nose.

06:39.920 --> 06:43.920
You know, I was convinced for the first half of it, but eventually it was like, hmm, I

06:43.920 --> 06:44.920
don't know.

06:44.920 --> 06:45.920
But you know what?

06:46.920 --> 06:51.920
If this person actually ended up being a real honest to God activist teacher, wouldn't be

06:51.920 --> 06:52.920
surprised.

06:52.920 --> 06:54.920
This one's got no audio.

06:54.920 --> 06:58.920
Oh, what the, and she goes to block.

06:58.920 --> 06:59.920
Okay, hold on.

06:59.920 --> 07:05.240
I got to play that a couple more times cause it's too, it's too short, but it looks like

07:05.240 --> 07:08.920
there's just, they're doing some sort of fetish thing in real life, right?

07:08.920 --> 07:15.040
Like IRL, it looks like there's a guy and then there's, it may be a girl, but in like

07:15.040 --> 07:20.040
a dog position and he's got like a leash, there's a racial component here, obviously.

07:20.040 --> 07:21.040
And it's at the bus stop.

07:21.040 --> 07:24.380
And once the girl in pink notices that it's being recorded, she walks over and blocks

07:24.380 --> 07:25.380
it.

07:25.380 --> 07:26.380
It's like, why block it?

07:26.380 --> 07:28.500
I mean, you're proud enough to be doing this outside.

07:28.500 --> 07:30.040
They're clearly fine with it.

07:30.040 --> 07:40.040
Oh, another fight video, shotlifting video, your food.

07:40.040 --> 07:44.040
Did you pay for it?

07:44.040 --> 07:52.560
Well, yep.

07:52.560 --> 07:55.040
It sounds like she didn't pay for it.

07:55.040 --> 07:56.040
Yep.

07:56.040 --> 08:02.040
Wait, wait, wait, what?

08:02.040 --> 08:05.860
You work three, if you're working three jobs, how is it that you don't have enough money

08:05.860 --> 08:06.860
to feed your family?

08:06.860 --> 08:08.900
You know, three jobs, minimum wage.

08:08.900 --> 08:11.720
Even if you're a waitress, you're still making some tips.

08:11.720 --> 08:13.980
Working three jobs, you should be able to feed your family.

08:13.980 --> 08:15.340
Where's all that money going, lady?

08:15.340 --> 08:17.340
In any case, it doesn't excuse stealing.

08:17.340 --> 08:18.340
Fuck you.

08:18.340 --> 08:19.340
Oh man.

08:19.340 --> 08:22.060
Oh, like mother, like daughter.

08:22.060 --> 08:24.660
Holy, holy, holy shit.

08:24.660 --> 08:26.660
That's oh my God.

08:26.660 --> 08:31.620
Imagine how much stuff that drags up, like how much it tracks.

08:31.620 --> 08:35.180
Imagine walking into like a public restroom and just having that thing trail behind you

08:35.180 --> 08:36.180
for 20 feet.

08:36.180 --> 08:37.180
Jesus.

08:37.180 --> 08:38.500
Oh, fuck.

08:38.500 --> 08:39.500
Why would you do that?

08:39.500 --> 08:41.220
Why would you do that, lady?

08:41.220 --> 08:43.020
This is some clown world ass shit.

08:43.020 --> 08:47.260
African people stay here, Jamaican people stay here, white people stay here, Spanish

08:47.260 --> 08:49.900
people stay here, and black Americans stay here.

08:49.900 --> 08:55.660
I'm not saying not all black Americans are bad, but the ones that came to my place have

08:55.660 --> 08:57.660
been nothing but a problem.

08:57.660 --> 09:00.140
Only two good ones came here, all of them.

09:00.140 --> 09:05.180
Fight late at night, not with me, with each other, the disrespectful, the entitled, the

09:05.180 --> 09:06.180
unappreciative.

09:06.180 --> 09:07.180
Must be an Airbnb.

09:07.180 --> 09:11.620
And it goes that way because America has spoiled them and give them so much free shit when

09:11.620 --> 09:15.300
they think they could come to Jamaica and get the same free shit out here and be nasty

09:15.300 --> 09:16.300
about it.

09:16.300 --> 09:19.980
I'm not saying all of you are like that, but because of that, I'm not risking my health

09:19.980 --> 09:22.340
and my happiness for people.

09:22.340 --> 09:24.100
No short-term stay.

09:24.100 --> 09:25.100
No short-term stay.

09:25.100 --> 09:26.580
It's not going to happen here.

09:26.580 --> 09:31.220
I'm going to eat salt and banana and let goats and cows live into my houses, then I'll help

09:31.220 --> 09:32.220
you come here and stress.

09:32.220 --> 09:34.900
I will not hate my business because of customers.

09:34.900 --> 09:35.900
Man.

09:35.900 --> 09:39.300
Gotta tell her she's being a racist, guys.

09:39.300 --> 09:46.660
You gotta tell her she's being a racist for not wanting black Americans to show up, even

09:46.660 --> 09:48.620
though she's black herself.

09:48.620 --> 09:52.820
This is one of those things where like, yeah, she is actually being racist, but she's gained

09:52.820 --> 09:59.220
this mindset through repeated exposure to bad experiences by bad black Americans.

09:59.220 --> 10:05.340
It's one of those things where I don't approve, but I understand.

10:05.340 --> 10:07.340
What the fuck?

10:07.340 --> 10:09.900
Oh my God.

10:09.900 --> 10:12.640
Justin Trudeau.

10:12.640 --> 10:14.700
What the shit is this?

10:14.700 --> 10:21.660
Blackface is back on the menu, boys.

10:21.660 --> 10:23.660
I'm now super straight.

10:23.660 --> 10:24.660
Why?

10:24.660 --> 10:25.660
Why?

10:25.660 --> 10:49.660
You're not one of them, though, are you, dude?

10:49.660 --> 10:57.980
What the fuck?

10:57.980 --> 10:58.980
Oh my God.

10:58.980 --> 10:59.980
The Mormons.

10:59.980 --> 11:12.660
The Mormons aren't going to like that.

11:12.660 --> 11:15.780
What does this have to do with nature or the North face?

11:15.780 --> 11:16.780
Like what the...

11:16.780 --> 11:22.900
It really feels like there's finally serious pushback against the rainbow capitalist nonsense.

11:22.900 --> 11:26.660
Against just the overwhelming rainbow vomit that is the month of June.

11:26.660 --> 11:27.980
There's finally pushback.

11:27.980 --> 11:31.060
I've been waiting for it for like five fucking years.

11:31.060 --> 11:32.540
Thank God it's actually happening.

11:32.540 --> 11:34.660
All right, my friends, that about does it for me today.

11:34.660 --> 11:38.740
I hope you enjoyed the cancer that I have now inflicted upon you.

11:38.740 --> 11:40.740
Make sure to get some chemo before we do next week.

11:40.740 --> 11:43.020
I will see you guys next time.

11:43.020 --> 11:43.620
I love you.
