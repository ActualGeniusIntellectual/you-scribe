1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,500
It's finally time for a Canadian-centric video.

2
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:12,040
After all this time, I know there's been a lot of demand for certain Canadian topics

3
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:13,040
in recent months.

4
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:15,340
I've seen all those comments, so let's get right to it.

5
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:18,260
After all, a giant truck is headed our way right now.

6
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:19,260
And wouldn't you know it?

7
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:20,260
It's full of medical supplies!

8
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:22,900
What, uh, what do you think I was going to talk about today?

9
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:27,100
I had a conversation with MadriBread a year or two ago, where we briefly talked about

10
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:28,540
the ethics of euthanasia.

11
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:32,760
I pointed out in that conversation that while as a self-owned individual you do have the

12
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:37,200
right to take your own life, if you create an institution around legal suicide, you create

13
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,520
the possibility for perverse incentives.

14
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:42,760
I described to him a hypothetical future, where an old man who is a member of a poor

15
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:46,160
family, rather than become a financial burden on the medical system during the final years

16
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:49,440
of his life, the government offers him the chance of euthanasia and his family gets a

17
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:50,440
cash payout.

18
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:54,000
The point I was making was, if you legalize something, a necessary part of that process

19
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,640
is creating incentives for it.

20
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:59,460
This is one of the stronger arguments against legalization of recreational drugs.

21
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:03,340
Even if a person who's doing drugs and committing no other bad actions is ultimately committing

22
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:07,540
a victimless crime, making the drug use legal has downstream consequences.

23
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:11,320
People who would commit other crimes while high now have easier access.

24
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:14,700
People who wouldn't do drugs if they remained illegal now might do them.

25
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:17,520
The culture shifts towards permissibility of something that really isn't that good

26
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:18,520
for you.

27
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:22,080
And most importantly for this conversation, now there's a new financial motive for more

28
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:24,180
people to get into the drug market.

29
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:26,960
Doing almost anything leads to new incentives.

30
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:32,320
In Canada, MADE, Medical Assistance in Dying, became legal in 2016 to end the suffering

31
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:36,120
of terminally ill adults, after a 2015 legal decision from the Supreme Court.

32
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:40,520
That case, Carter vs Canada 2015, revolved around Kaye Carter, who was a victim of degenerative

33
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:46,060
spinal stenosis, and another woman, Gloria Taylor, a victim of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.

34
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:50,840
The ruling gave Canadian adults who were mentally competent and suffering intolerably and endurably

35
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:53,200
the right to a doctor's assistance in dying.

36
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:57,720
The original 2016 MADE legislation specifically disallowed assisted death on the grounds of

37
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:02,700
mental illness, long-term disability, or any curable condition, and did not make euthanasia

38
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:04,140
available to minors.

39
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:08,280
In 2021, the legislation was amended to allow for death on the grounds of mental illness,

40
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:12,380
and relaxed other stipulations, giving Canada the most permissive assisted suicide laws

41
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:13,380
in the world.

42
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:17,140
Nonetheless, the law only applies to Canadians, to prevent suicide tourism.

43
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:21,500
As per the letter of the law, patients who qualify must sign a written request expressing

44
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:25,080
their wishes to end their life in front of one independent witness who can confirm it

45
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,720
was done willingly free of coercion.

46
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:31,020
Then, two medical personnel must confirm their own written agreement that the patient's

47
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:34,660
condition is in an advanced state of irreversible decline, and that the patient is capable and

48
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:36,380
willing of receiving euthanasia.

49
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:41,400
The 2021 amendment added that if the patient's death is not reasonably foreseeable in the

50
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:44,880
future, another expert in the underlying condition also needs to sign off.

51
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:48,380
As a safeguard against abuse, none of the witnesses or physicians involved can have

52
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:51,480
any legal or financial interest in the outcomes of the patient.

53
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:55,920
The patient must repeatedly express consent, not just imply it, including at the moment

54
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,360
before their death.

55
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,820
Consent can be revoked at any time, in any way.

56
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:03,320
There are no consequences for revoking consent, and no limits on how many attempts you can

57
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:04,320
make.

58
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:08,080
These all seem like reasonable safeguards, especially since, in the absence of them,

59
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:11,920
you'd probably see a lot more abuse of the system, and also because people who kill themselves

60
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:14,760
outside the system also have infinite chances to do so.

61
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:18,100
I personally think that while you do have the right to kill yourself, in almost all

62
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:21,940
situations, you shouldn't, and society is made worse the more permissive exercising

63
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:22,940
that right becomes.

64
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:27,100
I do like the letter of the initial law as it reads, though I think the continued easing

65
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:29,180
of restrictions over time is quite bad.

66
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:32,800
It's important, though, to look at how the law actually functions in reality.

67
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:37,020
Over this past summer, the claim that MADE is the sixth leading cause of death as the

68
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:40,540
poor and disabled begin to check out of Canadian life went viral online.

69
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:44,420
This claim was roundly debunked by the fact checkers over at AFP, who said that the MADE

70
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:47,400
program is not a cause of death, but rather a manner of death.

71
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:51,440
Well, that's a great distinction, but it kinda sidesteps the criticism, doesn't it?

72
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:54,680
The core of the issue is whether or not Canada is euthanizing poor people.

73
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:57,680
It's one thing to say my condition is irreversible and I'd rather be dead.

74
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:00,880
It's another thing entirely to say I would rather keep living but it's too expensive

75
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:02,120
so I might as well die.

76
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:06,320
It seems like the line that all of those safeguards was meant to guard against was quickly crossed

77
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:07,960
by the Canadian government anyway.

78
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:10,640
I know what you might be thinking, Canada's got universal healthcare.

79
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:13,680
The wait times might be bad, yeah, but at least all your shit is paid for.

80
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:17,420
In America, if you can't afford care, you just go bankrupt or die without any help.

81
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:20,120
In Canada, that financial incentive is taken out of the equation.

82
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:24,100
That is the argument that a lot of pro-universal healthcare people make on this topic.

83
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:26,000
The removal of the financial incentive.

84
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,500
I still think that goal is achievable, at least somewhat, but Canada's done it so

85
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:33,280
poorly that at least on this topic, you might as well have no help at all.

86
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:35,340
Check out these examples and you'll see what I mean.

87
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:38,480
This testimony was given in parliament on November 10th, 2020.

88
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,780
My name is Roger Foley.

89
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:41,080
I'm 45 years old.

90
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:45,680
I was born with Spinocerebellar Ataxia, which is a severe neurodegenerative disease.

91
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:49,900
With the assisted dying regime in Canada, I have experienced the lack of care and assistance

92
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:50,900
I need to live.

93
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:52,360
I have been denied food and water.

94
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:55,500
I have not been assisted to transfer, take my medications, and go to the bathroom.

95
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:59,600
I have been abused and berated because I have disabilities and told my needs are too much

96
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,600
work.

97
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,600
My life has been devalued.

98
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:06,020
I have been coerced into assisted death by abuse, neglect, lack of care, and threats.

99
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:09,660
For example, at a time when I was advocating for assistance to live and for self-directed

100
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:13,600
home care, the hospital ethicist and nurses were trying to coerce me into an assisted

101
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:18,760
death by threatening to charge me $1,800 per day or force discharge me without the care

102
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:19,760
I needed to live.

103
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:24,200
I felt pressured by these staff raising assisted dying rather than relieving my suffering with

104
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:26,280
dignified and compassionate care.

105
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:28,760
Hospital staff failed to provide me with the necessities of life.

106
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:31,680
I was starved and denied water for up to 20 days.

107
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:35,120
An expert who reviewed the case concluded a failure to provide necessities of life and

108
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,480
gross negligence.

109
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:40,260
Foley leaked a recording to the Canadian press of doctors trying to get him on board with

110
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:41,260
euthanasia.

111
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:46,460
Roger Foley went from being active and healthy to disabled and helpless because of a rare

112
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:48,460
neurological disease.

113
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:53,100
For the past two and a half years, he's been in hospital in London, Ontario, part of a

114
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:54,960
health care standoff.

115
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:57,060
He wants assisted home care.

116
00:05:57,060 --> 00:06:00,860
Instead, he says he's being offered a medically assisted death.

117
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:05,960
I have not received the care that I need to relieve my suffering, and only being offered

118
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:07,700
is dying.

119
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:12,680
And Foley is releasing audio tapes he took of what he says are two health care workers

120
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:18,400
who keep raising that option when he talks about getting home care teams of his choosing.

121
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:23,000
If I had self-directed farming, then I'd be fine, but...

122
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:29,960
But if you weren't, you just, you can just apply to get assisted if you want it in your

123
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:30,960
life.

124
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:31,960
Like, you know what I mean?

125
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:34,700
You don't have to do it in some dramatic manner.

126
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:37,940
You can apply for assisted, you know.

127
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:44,420
In the second, Foley is told he will be charged more than $1,500 a day if he doesn't go home,

128
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:48,100
with the suggestion he can apply for the right to die.

129
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:50,300
What's the plan that you know of?

130
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:53,020
Roger, this is not my show.

131
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:58,160
I told you my piece of this was to talk to you about if you had interest in assisted

132
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,160
dying.

133
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:06,200
In essence, the tape speaks about encouraging him or asking him if he's interested in assisted

134
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:12,460
dying rather than working with him to provide the services that he needs.

135
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:13,460
And he's not the only one.

136
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:16,600
A woman in Ontario chose maid after failing to get affordable housing.

137
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:19,820
The logic the medical system used to approve her was that the house she was stuck in was

138
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:24,740
not free of cigarette smoke and chemical cleaners, making her diagnosed extreme sensitivity to

139
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:28,000
chemicals in an advanced state of irreversible decline.

140
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,500
She posted a video a week before her death where she said, the government sees me as

141
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:35,180
expendable trash, a complainer, useless, and a pain in the ass.

142
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:38,820
Another woman applied to die because her medical problems required dietary restrictions that

143
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:42,160
she couldn't afford and COVID lockdowns ended her ability to make money.

144
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,660
She's not the only person who blamed COVID restrictions.

145
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:46,700
Another woman, this one from Vancouver, said the same thing.

146
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:51,300
A third woman, suffering from a concussion, had her care so postponed by COVID shutdowns

147
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:55,120
that her condition exacerbated to the point that her personality drastically changed.

148
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,880
She became irritable, unpredictable, and unable to focus.

149
00:07:57,880 --> 00:08:01,180
She also ended up getting euthanized, and the family has brought charges against the

150
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:04,980
government claiming that she clearly did not have the capacity to consent based on her

151
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:05,980
condition.

152
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:09,540
Another man chose death because the quality of government healthcare was so poor he viewed

153
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:11,060
euthanasia as preferable.

154
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:14,940
When his family arrived at the long-term care facility to be with him during his final moments,

155
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:18,820
they found a room full of trash, piss and shit on the floor, and mold on the walls and

156
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:19,820
in the sink.

157
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:22,140
Family members claimed that their shoes were sticking to the floor as they walked through

158
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:23,140
the room.

159
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:26,380
Several photos were released to the press of the state of the room, but one photo wasn't

160
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:27,560
out of respect for the victim.

161
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:31,280
It showed him lying in a bed filled with his own filth, unable to help himself.

162
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:35,100
Another man had his story go viral recently, even though it happened several years ago.

163
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:37,400
He had some medical issues, but none of them were life-threatening.

164
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:42,480
In June of 2019, he was hospitalized, seemingly against his will, over fears he might be suicidal.

165
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:45,020
While he was stuck there, he asked his brother to come bust him out.

166
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:48,880
But within a month of his stay, he had submitted a request to be euthanized, claiming only

167
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:51,580
one health condition as the reason, hearing loss.

168
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:56,180
A suicidal man, stuck in a medical system that permits suicide, maybe even advocates

169
00:08:56,180 --> 00:08:58,800
for suicide, ends up committing suicide.

170
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:02,540
Another story went viral around the same time, this time of a Canadian veteran who was suffering

171
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:05,400
from PTSD and a brain injury due to his service.

172
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:09,660
Somebody who was not at all suicidal was approached with an offer of euthanasia unprompted.

173
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:13,460
This event caused such an outrage that Veterans Affairs Canada admitted publicly that the

174
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:17,980
offer was inappropriate and that appropriate administrative action will be taken in response.

175
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:21,740
A mother with a 25-year-old daughter who had several debilitating medical conditions was

176
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:25,880
told out of the blue by a doctor that assisted suicide is now legal in Canada.

177
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:29,200
She was shocked and refused, upon which the doctor called her selfish.

178
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:33,520
The patient overheard the conversation and claims to be quite traumatized by the exchange.

179
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:37,300
Another man, this one with ALS, chose to die because he claimed the long-term care facility

180
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:38,480
was treating him poorly.

181
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,880
He instead opted to go back home and die with his family.

182
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:44,360
Two other people, one with muscular dystrophy and another with cerebral palsy, said the

183
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:48,480
government healthcare available to them is so poor they feel pushed into euthanasia.

184
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:52,820
And perhaps most egregiously is the case of a man who was approved for euthanasia whose

185
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:57,160
only problem was depression, a condition well known for having suicidal ideation as

186
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:58,160
a symptom.

187
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:01,880
Despite the claim that universal healthcare removes the financial incentive from the equation,

188
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:05,900
a lot of the conversations all of these people had with the medical system revolved around

189
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:06,900
resources.

190
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:10,380
Either they were threatened with outrageous additional fees not covered by the program

191
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:14,240
if they didn't comply, or they were told that they would be selfish in sucking up resources.

192
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:18,240
And this focus on the money is echoed in the October 2020 cost estimate for MADE.

193
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:23,920
After the 2016 era MADE rules, the government saved 86.9 million dollars implementing euthanasia

194
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:26,640
programs rather than caring for people until their natural end of life.

195
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:31,000
But the 2021 expansion of the program was estimated to save an additional 62 million.

196
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,520
This idea that it's only private business that cares about money and governments would

197
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:38,320
never cut corners to save a buck, even if it means acting unethically, is just ridiculous.

198
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,880
We've got to ask the question, how the hell did we get here?

199
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:43,820
Well, I'm going to go down a little bit of a conspiracy rabbit hole on this one.

200
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:47,840
I don't know if this is what happened, but there is at least some circumstantial evidence.

201
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:52,200
The 2021 expansion of the MADE program, the requirement that was designed to stop people

202
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:55,680
from getting euthanized unless they had a debilitating deteriorating condition that

203
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:59,480
was never getting better, that was taken out in response to two lawsuits.

204
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:03,740
The first one is Truchon vs Canada 2019 in Quebec, oh god I'm going to butcher every

205
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:07,940
French name in this, where the judge ruled that the clause violated the charter guarantee

206
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:09,560
of equal protection under the law.

207
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:15,080
The judge presiding over that case was Justice Christine Beaudoin, I don't know, it's a French

208
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:16,080
name.

209
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:19,760
The judge's father, Jean-Louis, has long been an advocate of unfettered euthanasia

210
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:24,840
access, going back decades, though his writings on this topic are almost entirely in French.

211
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:29,140
Considering one of her father's lifelong political goals is unfettered euthanasia access,

212
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:33,520
a goal she seems to share, she may have been too biased to judge on a case on that very

213
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:34,520
same topic.

214
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:37,720
The second case is the precursor to the one that I spoke at the beginning of this video,

215
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:41,680
Carter vs Canada 2012, where the judge, Lynn Smith, gave a similar ruling.

216
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:46,520
The plaintiff is represented by the BCCLA, the British Columbia Civil Liberties Association.

217
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:50,320
Lynn Smith is a former board member of the BCCLA before becoming a judge, and at the

218
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:54,880
time of the trial, Smith's daughter was working with the BCCLA as a legal counsel.

219
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:59,360
Her daughter wasn't, on paper, the lead legal counsel for the Carter vs Canada 2012 case,

220
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:04,040
but she was the lead legal counsel for all the other BCCLA cases happening at the same

221
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:07,680
time, most notably a case regarding the rights of sex workers in British Columbia.

222
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:11,600
It's entirely possible that Smith's ruling was biased based on her own past association

223
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:16,080
with the BCCLA, as well as the fact that her own daughter stood to gain from a win.

224
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:20,240
The government appealed Carter vs Canada 2012, where Smith's decision was overturned.

225
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:23,840
The BCCLA also appealed, leading to Carter vs Canada 2015.

226
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:27,720
The judge of that case, Chief Justice Beverly McLaughlin, has a long friendship with the

227
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:31,840
president and director of the BCCLA, Lindsay Leister.

228
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:46,120
Moreover, she has a personal attachment to the idea of euthanasia, after her husband

229
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:49,800
asked her for help to end his life, long before this became a legal issue, something she admitted

230
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:51,040
to in her memoir.

231
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:57,240
The British Columbia Court of Appeal had rejected Sue's claim to assisted suicide, and she

232
00:12:57,240 --> 00:13:00,900
appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.

233
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:05,840
As the hearing date approached, I worried whether I was still too close to Rory's death

234
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:07,600
to sit on the case.

235
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:11,860
I went to see my Chief Justice, now Antonio Lemaire.

236
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:18,440
He had replaced Brian Dixon as Chief Justice when Brian retired in the spring of 1990.

237
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:21,960
I'm not sure I should sit on this case, I said.

238
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:29,040
I do not have settled views on the outcome, but I feel very close to it after...

239
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:32,720
After what you went through with Rory, he interrupted, I nodded.

240
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:36,200
You should not let that stop you from sitting, he said.

241
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:41,160
Judges are human beings, they bring their life experiences to the cases they decide.

242
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:45,800
One morning as he lay in his bed in our home, he asked a special thing of me to give him

243
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:50,920
the morphine we had been doling out drop by drop, in a single massive dose.

244
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:53,800
I want to die now, he said.

245
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:57,460
Tears in my eyes, I left the room, I could not do it.

246
00:13:57,460 --> 00:14:00,060
I had always thought of myself as gutsy.

247
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:05,960
I had never shrunk from unpleasant things, but this I knew in my heart I could not do,

248
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:11,640
because it was against the law, because I could not physically bring myself to do it.

249
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:16,800
Racked by guilt at failing my husband's last request, I wept in a hospital chair while

250
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:19,200
Rory was in the adjoining treatment room.

251
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:22,600
A doctor found me and I told him everything.

252
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:24,920
I can't do it, I whispered.

253
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:27,180
The doctor did not judge.

254
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:30,280
Then you shouldn't do it, he said, remember you will go on.

255
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:32,600
You have to live with yourself after.

256
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:36,280
And then he added, we'll do what we can.

257
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:40,200
Were the treatments that followed only for pain or did they shorten the remaining days

258
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,380
of his life?

259
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:43,880
I didn't know and I didn't ask.

260
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:48,740
All I knew was that the pain lessened and Rory passed away peacefully.

261
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:52,800
She dissented to a previous euthanasia ruling, Rodriguez vs British Columbia 1993, and then

262
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:56,180
cited her own dissent in her ruling of Carter vs Canada 2015.

263
00:14:56,180 --> 00:15:01,300
It is also possible, like with Smith, McLaughlin was biased in her ruling, both in terms of

264
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:05,220
her preconceived notions on the topic, which may or may not be a problem, but also in her

265
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:09,660
personal relationships with the BCCLA, which is absolutely a problem.

266
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:12,340
And to bring us back around to the start of the video, where I told my dry bread that

267
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:16,440
legalizing a thing creates incentives, we are now actually approaching that point.

268
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:20,360
Though the incentive isn't exactly financial, doctors are beginning to talk about euthanasia

269
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:24,180
by organ donation, where the law does away with the safeguard that a person has to be

270
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:26,060
dead before organs are harvested.

271
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:30,080
Their idea is, if a person requests to die, doctors should euthanize them by removing

272
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:34,240
their still living organs, increasing the chances of a successful transplant.

273
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:38,120
The fact that one of the medical objectives in the debate, I think, is to sort out when

274
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:42,680
we can retrieve organs from donation, helps us understand this values component of the

275
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:43,680
ontological question.

276
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:47,160
I mean, we're so invested in this dead donor rule.

277
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:50,240
And I think that over time, that rule has become so ingrained in the medical community

278
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:56,520
that we hold it out as a foundational principle, not only a rule, but a value.

279
00:15:56,520 --> 00:16:01,320
And I think just as likely, there are people who question that value now.

280
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:05,320
And I know there's perhaps not an appetite to go there.

281
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:10,240
But raising the question, is the dead donor rule even relevant?

282
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:16,580
I think there are some who might want to say, I think back to other contentious debates

283
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:21,600
in the past few years, and then where we're going with medical assistance and dying.

284
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:26,200
The best use of my organs, if I'm going to receive a medically assisted death, might

285
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:35,400
be to not first kill me, and then retrieve my organs, but to have my mode of death as

286
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:39,320
we medically consider death now, to be to retrieve my organs.

287
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:43,200
In principle, I am still ultimately pro euthanasia, because obviously you have the right to kill

288
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:47,240
yourself, not just because you're terminally ill, but even for a stupid reason if you want.

289
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:50,840
It always sounded dumb to me when governments make suicide illegal, it's like, what could

290
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:52,920
you possibly punish them with a death sentence?

291
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:56,800
But the reason it's illegal is to give the state legitimate pathways of interference

292
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,640
with a suicide in progress.

293
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:01,760
The rights conversation lands in the side of the individual to do what they want with

294
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:03,300
their life, including ending it.

295
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:07,040
But there seems to be a bunch of bad actors circling like vultures who have something

296
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:09,440
to gain from making suicide more permissive.

297
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:13,240
As the Canadian state begins to enshrine the right to euthanasia, and begins to slowly

298
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:17,080
pick apart the reasonable gatekeeping measures on that right, we're starting to see these

299
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:21,100
perverse incentives pop up, the end result of a group of people who are ideologically

300
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:23,260
inclined to profit off the death of others.

301
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:27,400
It may not strictly be financial profit, like with American Big Pharma jacking up the prices

302
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:29,660
of simple drugs, but it's profit nonetheless.

303
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:33,200
I predict that we're going to hear many more stories of people being told that they're

304
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:37,440
selfish for being a burden and sucking up more healthcare instead of just dying as ordered,

305
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:41,080
until the general public begins to realize exactly what type of a hole we've dug ourselves

306
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:43,920
by allowing the state to have a moral stake in our health.

307
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:47,760
Though universal healthcare can be good, the ultimate downside of such a system is that

308
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:51,680
it's no longer your say whether or not your care gets funded, it's the government's.

309
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:55,120
Before, you could get all the care you wanted if you paid for it, and yeah, that sucks people

310
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:59,120
who can't pay, but now, your life continues at the whim of a bureaucrat who does not give

311
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,120
a shit about you.
