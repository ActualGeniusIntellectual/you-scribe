WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:08.500
It's finally time for a Canadian-centric video.

00:08.500 --> 00:12.040
After all this time, I know there's been a lot of demand for certain Canadian topics

00:12.040 --> 00:13.040
in recent months.

00:13.040 --> 00:15.340
I've seen all those comments, so let's get right to it.

00:15.340 --> 00:18.260
After all, a giant truck is headed our way right now.

00:18.260 --> 00:19.260
And wouldn't you know it?

00:19.260 --> 00:20.260
It's full of medical supplies!

00:20.260 --> 00:22.900
What, uh, what do you think I was going to talk about today?

00:22.900 --> 00:27.100
I had a conversation with MadriBread a year or two ago, where we briefly talked about

00:27.100 --> 00:28.540
the ethics of euthanasia.

00:28.540 --> 00:32.760
I pointed out in that conversation that while as a self-owned individual you do have the

00:32.760 --> 00:37.200
right to take your own life, if you create an institution around legal suicide, you create

00:37.200 --> 00:39.520
the possibility for perverse incentives.

00:39.520 --> 00:42.760
I described to him a hypothetical future, where an old man who is a member of a poor

00:42.760 --> 00:46.160
family, rather than become a financial burden on the medical system during the final years

00:46.160 --> 00:49.440
of his life, the government offers him the chance of euthanasia and his family gets a

00:49.440 --> 00:50.440
cash payout.

00:50.440 --> 00:54.000
The point I was making was, if you legalize something, a necessary part of that process

00:54.000 --> 00:55.640
is creating incentives for it.

00:55.640 --> 00:59.460
This is one of the stronger arguments against legalization of recreational drugs.

00:59.460 --> 01:03.340
Even if a person who's doing drugs and committing no other bad actions is ultimately committing

01:03.340 --> 01:07.540
a victimless crime, making the drug use legal has downstream consequences.

01:07.540 --> 01:11.320
People who would commit other crimes while high now have easier access.

01:11.320 --> 01:14.700
People who wouldn't do drugs if they remained illegal now might do them.

01:14.700 --> 01:17.520
The culture shifts towards permissibility of something that really isn't that good

01:17.520 --> 01:18.520
for you.

01:18.520 --> 01:22.080
And most importantly for this conversation, now there's a new financial motive for more

01:22.080 --> 01:24.180
people to get into the drug market.

01:24.180 --> 01:26.960
Doing almost anything leads to new incentives.

01:26.960 --> 01:32.320
In Canada, MADE, Medical Assistance in Dying, became legal in 2016 to end the suffering

01:32.320 --> 01:36.120
of terminally ill adults, after a 2015 legal decision from the Supreme Court.

01:36.120 --> 01:40.520
That case, Carter vs Canada 2015, revolved around Kaye Carter, who was a victim of degenerative

01:40.520 --> 01:46.060
spinal stenosis, and another woman, Gloria Taylor, a victim of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.

01:46.060 --> 01:50.840
The ruling gave Canadian adults who were mentally competent and suffering intolerably and endurably

01:50.840 --> 01:53.200
the right to a doctor's assistance in dying.

01:53.220 --> 01:57.720
The original 2016 MADE legislation specifically disallowed assisted death on the grounds of

01:57.720 --> 02:02.700
mental illness, long-term disability, or any curable condition, and did not make euthanasia

02:02.700 --> 02:04.140
available to minors.

02:04.140 --> 02:08.280
In 2021, the legislation was amended to allow for death on the grounds of mental illness,

02:08.280 --> 02:12.380
and relaxed other stipulations, giving Canada the most permissive assisted suicide laws

02:12.380 --> 02:13.380
in the world.

02:13.380 --> 02:17.140
Nonetheless, the law only applies to Canadians, to prevent suicide tourism.

02:17.140 --> 02:21.500
As per the letter of the law, patients who qualify must sign a written request expressing

02:21.500 --> 02:25.080
their wishes to end their life in front of one independent witness who can confirm it

02:25.080 --> 02:26.720
was done willingly free of coercion.

02:26.720 --> 02:31.020
Then, two medical personnel must confirm their own written agreement that the patient's

02:31.020 --> 02:34.660
condition is in an advanced state of irreversible decline, and that the patient is capable and

02:34.660 --> 02:36.380
willing of receiving euthanasia.

02:36.380 --> 02:41.400
The 2021 amendment added that if the patient's death is not reasonably foreseeable in the

02:41.400 --> 02:44.880
future, another expert in the underlying condition also needs to sign off.

02:44.880 --> 02:48.380
As a safeguard against abuse, none of the witnesses or physicians involved can have

02:48.380 --> 02:51.480
any legal or financial interest in the outcomes of the patient.

02:51.480 --> 02:55.920
The patient must repeatedly express consent, not just imply it, including at the moment

02:55.920 --> 02:57.360
before their death.

02:57.360 --> 02:59.820
Consent can be revoked at any time, in any way.

02:59.820 --> 03:03.320
There are no consequences for revoking consent, and no limits on how many attempts you can

03:03.320 --> 03:04.320
make.

03:04.320 --> 03:08.080
These all seem like reasonable safeguards, especially since, in the absence of them,

03:08.080 --> 03:11.920
you'd probably see a lot more abuse of the system, and also because people who kill themselves

03:11.920 --> 03:14.760
outside the system also have infinite chances to do so.

03:14.760 --> 03:18.100
I personally think that while you do have the right to kill yourself, in almost all

03:18.100 --> 03:21.940
situations, you shouldn't, and society is made worse the more permissive exercising

03:21.940 --> 03:22.940
that right becomes.

03:22.940 --> 03:27.100
I do like the letter of the initial law as it reads, though I think the continued easing

03:27.100 --> 03:29.180
of restrictions over time is quite bad.

03:29.180 --> 03:32.800
It's important, though, to look at how the law actually functions in reality.

03:32.800 --> 03:37.020
Over this past summer, the claim that MADE is the sixth leading cause of death as the

03:37.020 --> 03:40.540
poor and disabled begin to check out of Canadian life went viral online.

03:40.540 --> 03:44.420
This claim was roundly debunked by the fact checkers over at AFP, who said that the MADE

03:44.420 --> 03:47.400
program is not a cause of death, but rather a manner of death.

03:47.400 --> 03:51.440
Well, that's a great distinction, but it kinda sidesteps the criticism, doesn't it?

03:51.440 --> 03:54.680
The core of the issue is whether or not Canada is euthanizing poor people.

03:54.680 --> 03:57.680
It's one thing to say my condition is irreversible and I'd rather be dead.

03:57.680 --> 04:00.880
It's another thing entirely to say I would rather keep living but it's too expensive

04:00.880 --> 04:02.120
so I might as well die.

04:02.120 --> 04:06.320
It seems like the line that all of those safeguards was meant to guard against was quickly crossed

04:06.320 --> 04:07.960
by the Canadian government anyway.

04:07.960 --> 04:10.640
I know what you might be thinking, Canada's got universal healthcare.

04:10.640 --> 04:13.680
The wait times might be bad, yeah, but at least all your shit is paid for.

04:13.680 --> 04:17.420
In America, if you can't afford care, you just go bankrupt or die without any help.

04:17.420 --> 04:20.120
In Canada, that financial incentive is taken out of the equation.

04:20.120 --> 04:24.100
That is the argument that a lot of pro-universal healthcare people make on this topic.

04:24.100 --> 04:26.000
The removal of the financial incentive.

04:26.000 --> 04:29.500
I still think that goal is achievable, at least somewhat, but Canada's done it so

04:29.500 --> 04:33.280
poorly that at least on this topic, you might as well have no help at all.

04:33.280 --> 04:35.340
Check out these examples and you'll see what I mean.

04:35.340 --> 04:38.480
This testimony was given in parliament on November 10th, 2020.

04:38.480 --> 04:39.780
My name is Roger Foley.

04:39.780 --> 04:41.080
I'm 45 years old.

04:41.080 --> 04:45.680
I was born with Spinocerebellar Ataxia, which is a severe neurodegenerative disease.

04:45.680 --> 04:49.900
With the assisted dying regime in Canada, I have experienced the lack of care and assistance

04:49.900 --> 04:50.900
I need to live.

04:50.900 --> 04:52.360
I have been denied food and water.

04:52.360 --> 04:55.500
I have not been assisted to transfer, take my medications, and go to the bathroom.

04:55.500 --> 04:59.600
I have been abused and berated because I have disabilities and told my needs are too much

04:59.600 --> 05:00.600
work.

05:00.600 --> 05:01.600
My life has been devalued.

05:01.600 --> 05:06.020
I have been coerced into assisted death by abuse, neglect, lack of care, and threats.

05:06.020 --> 05:09.660
For example, at a time when I was advocating for assistance to live and for self-directed

05:09.660 --> 05:13.600
home care, the hospital ethicist and nurses were trying to coerce me into an assisted

05:13.600 --> 05:18.760
death by threatening to charge me $1,800 per day or force discharge me without the care

05:18.760 --> 05:19.760
I needed to live.

05:19.760 --> 05:24.200
I felt pressured by these staff raising assisted dying rather than relieving my suffering with

05:24.200 --> 05:26.280
dignified and compassionate care.

05:26.280 --> 05:28.760
Hospital staff failed to provide me with the necessities of life.

05:28.760 --> 05:31.680
I was starved and denied water for up to 20 days.

05:31.680 --> 05:35.120
An expert who reviewed the case concluded a failure to provide necessities of life and

05:35.120 --> 05:36.480
gross negligence.

05:36.480 --> 05:40.260
Foley leaked a recording to the Canadian press of doctors trying to get him on board with

05:40.260 --> 05:41.260
euthanasia.

05:41.260 --> 05:46.460
Roger Foley went from being active and healthy to disabled and helpless because of a rare

05:46.460 --> 05:48.460
neurological disease.

05:48.460 --> 05:53.100
For the past two and a half years, he's been in hospital in London, Ontario, part of a

05:53.100 --> 05:54.960
health care standoff.

05:54.960 --> 05:57.060
He wants assisted home care.

05:57.060 --> 06:00.860
Instead, he says he's being offered a medically assisted death.

06:00.860 --> 06:05.960
I have not received the care that I need to relieve my suffering, and only being offered

06:05.960 --> 06:07.700
is dying.

06:07.700 --> 06:12.680
And Foley is releasing audio tapes he took of what he says are two health care workers

06:12.680 --> 06:18.400
who keep raising that option when he talks about getting home care teams of his choosing.

06:18.400 --> 06:23.000
If I had self-directed farming, then I'd be fine, but...

06:23.000 --> 06:29.960
But if you weren't, you just, you can just apply to get assisted if you want it in your

06:29.960 --> 06:30.960
life.

06:30.960 --> 06:31.960
Like, you know what I mean?

06:31.960 --> 06:34.700
You don't have to do it in some dramatic manner.

06:34.700 --> 06:37.940
You can apply for assisted, you know.

06:37.940 --> 06:44.420
In the second, Foley is told he will be charged more than $1,500 a day if he doesn't go home,

06:44.420 --> 06:48.100
with the suggestion he can apply for the right to die.

06:48.100 --> 06:50.300
What's the plan that you know of?

06:50.300 --> 06:53.020
Roger, this is not my show.

06:53.020 --> 06:58.160
I told you my piece of this was to talk to you about if you had interest in assisted

06:58.160 --> 06:59.160
dying.

06:59.160 --> 07:06.200
In essence, the tape speaks about encouraging him or asking him if he's interested in assisted

07:06.200 --> 07:12.460
dying rather than working with him to provide the services that he needs.

07:12.460 --> 07:13.460
And he's not the only one.

07:13.460 --> 07:16.600
A woman in Ontario chose maid after failing to get affordable housing.

07:16.600 --> 07:19.820
The logic the medical system used to approve her was that the house she was stuck in was

07:19.820 --> 07:24.740
not free of cigarette smoke and chemical cleaners, making her diagnosed extreme sensitivity to

07:24.740 --> 07:28.000
chemicals in an advanced state of irreversible decline.

07:28.000 --> 07:31.500
She posted a video a week before her death where she said, the government sees me as

07:31.500 --> 07:35.180
expendable trash, a complainer, useless, and a pain in the ass.

07:35.180 --> 07:38.820
Another woman applied to die because her medical problems required dietary restrictions that

07:38.820 --> 07:42.160
she couldn't afford and COVID lockdowns ended her ability to make money.

07:42.160 --> 07:44.660
She's not the only person who blamed COVID restrictions.

07:44.660 --> 07:46.700
Another woman, this one from Vancouver, said the same thing.

07:46.700 --> 07:51.300
A third woman, suffering from a concussion, had her care so postponed by COVID shutdowns

07:51.300 --> 07:55.120
that her condition exacerbated to the point that her personality drastically changed.

07:55.120 --> 07:57.880
She became irritable, unpredictable, and unable to focus.

07:57.880 --> 08:01.180
She also ended up getting euthanized, and the family has brought charges against the

08:01.180 --> 08:04.980
government claiming that she clearly did not have the capacity to consent based on her

08:04.980 --> 08:05.980
condition.

08:05.980 --> 08:09.540
Another man chose death because the quality of government healthcare was so poor he viewed

08:09.540 --> 08:11.060
euthanasia as preferable.

08:11.060 --> 08:14.940
When his family arrived at the long-term care facility to be with him during his final moments,

08:14.940 --> 08:18.820
they found a room full of trash, piss and shit on the floor, and mold on the walls and

08:18.820 --> 08:19.820
in the sink.

08:19.820 --> 08:22.140
Family members claimed that their shoes were sticking to the floor as they walked through

08:22.140 --> 08:23.140
the room.

08:23.140 --> 08:26.380
Several photos were released to the press of the state of the room, but one photo wasn't

08:26.380 --> 08:27.560
out of respect for the victim.

08:27.560 --> 08:31.280
It showed him lying in a bed filled with his own filth, unable to help himself.

08:31.280 --> 08:35.100
Another man had his story go viral recently, even though it happened several years ago.

08:35.100 --> 08:37.400
He had some medical issues, but none of them were life-threatening.

08:37.400 --> 08:42.480
In June of 2019, he was hospitalized, seemingly against his will, over fears he might be suicidal.

08:42.480 --> 08:45.020
While he was stuck there, he asked his brother to come bust him out.

08:45.020 --> 08:48.880
But within a month of his stay, he had submitted a request to be euthanized, claiming only

08:48.880 --> 08:51.580
one health condition as the reason, hearing loss.

08:51.580 --> 08:56.180
A suicidal man, stuck in a medical system that permits suicide, maybe even advocates

08:56.180 --> 08:58.800
for suicide, ends up committing suicide.

08:58.800 --> 09:02.540
Another story went viral around the same time, this time of a Canadian veteran who was suffering

09:02.540 --> 09:05.400
from PTSD and a brain injury due to his service.

09:05.400 --> 09:09.660
Somebody who was not at all suicidal was approached with an offer of euthanasia unprompted.

09:09.660 --> 09:13.460
This event caused such an outrage that Veterans Affairs Canada admitted publicly that the

09:13.460 --> 09:17.980
offer was inappropriate and that appropriate administrative action will be taken in response.

09:17.980 --> 09:21.740
A mother with a 25-year-old daughter who had several debilitating medical conditions was

09:21.740 --> 09:25.880
told out of the blue by a doctor that assisted suicide is now legal in Canada.

09:25.880 --> 09:29.200
She was shocked and refused, upon which the doctor called her selfish.

09:29.200 --> 09:33.520
The patient overheard the conversation and claims to be quite traumatized by the exchange.

09:33.520 --> 09:37.300
Another man, this one with ALS, chose to die because he claimed the long-term care facility

09:37.300 --> 09:38.480
was treating him poorly.

09:38.480 --> 09:40.880
He instead opted to go back home and die with his family.

09:40.880 --> 09:44.360
Two other people, one with muscular dystrophy and another with cerebral palsy, said the

09:44.360 --> 09:48.480
government healthcare available to them is so poor they feel pushed into euthanasia.

09:48.480 --> 09:52.820
And perhaps most egregiously is the case of a man who was approved for euthanasia whose

09:52.820 --> 09:57.160
only problem was depression, a condition well known for having suicidal ideation as

09:57.160 --> 09:58.160
a symptom.

09:58.160 --> 10:01.880
Despite the claim that universal healthcare removes the financial incentive from the equation,

10:01.880 --> 10:05.900
a lot of the conversations all of these people had with the medical system revolved around

10:05.900 --> 10:06.900
resources.

10:06.900 --> 10:10.380
Either they were threatened with outrageous additional fees not covered by the program

10:10.380 --> 10:14.240
if they didn't comply, or they were told that they would be selfish in sucking up resources.

10:14.240 --> 10:18.240
And this focus on the money is echoed in the October 2020 cost estimate for MADE.

10:18.240 --> 10:23.920
After the 2016 era MADE rules, the government saved 86.9 million dollars implementing euthanasia

10:23.920 --> 10:26.640
programs rather than caring for people until their natural end of life.

10:26.640 --> 10:31.000
But the 2021 expansion of the program was estimated to save an additional 62 million.

10:31.000 --> 10:34.520
This idea that it's only private business that cares about money and governments would

10:34.520 --> 10:38.320
never cut corners to save a buck, even if it means acting unethically, is just ridiculous.

10:38.320 --> 10:40.880
We've got to ask the question, how the hell did we get here?

10:40.880 --> 10:43.820
Well, I'm going to go down a little bit of a conspiracy rabbit hole on this one.

10:43.820 --> 10:47.840
I don't know if this is what happened, but there is at least some circumstantial evidence.

10:47.840 --> 10:52.200
The 2021 expansion of the MADE program, the requirement that was designed to stop people

10:52.200 --> 10:55.680
from getting euthanized unless they had a debilitating deteriorating condition that

10:55.680 --> 10:59.480
was never getting better, that was taken out in response to two lawsuits.

10:59.480 --> 11:03.740
The first one is Truchon vs Canada 2019 in Quebec, oh god I'm going to butcher every

11:03.740 --> 11:07.940
French name in this, where the judge ruled that the clause violated the charter guarantee

11:07.940 --> 11:09.560
of equal protection under the law.

11:09.560 --> 11:15.080
The judge presiding over that case was Justice Christine Beaudoin, I don't know, it's a French

11:15.080 --> 11:16.080
name.

11:16.080 --> 11:19.760
The judge's father, Jean-Louis, has long been an advocate of unfettered euthanasia

11:19.760 --> 11:24.840
access, going back decades, though his writings on this topic are almost entirely in French.

11:24.840 --> 11:29.140
Considering one of her father's lifelong political goals is unfettered euthanasia access,

11:29.140 --> 11:33.520
a goal she seems to share, she may have been too biased to judge on a case on that very

11:33.520 --> 11:34.520
same topic.

11:34.520 --> 11:37.720
The second case is the precursor to the one that I spoke at the beginning of this video,

11:37.720 --> 11:41.680
Carter vs Canada 2012, where the judge, Lynn Smith, gave a similar ruling.

11:41.680 --> 11:46.520
The plaintiff is represented by the BCCLA, the British Columbia Civil Liberties Association.

11:46.520 --> 11:50.320
Lynn Smith is a former board member of the BCCLA before becoming a judge, and at the

11:50.320 --> 11:54.880
time of the trial, Smith's daughter was working with the BCCLA as a legal counsel.

11:54.880 --> 11:59.360
Her daughter wasn't, on paper, the lead legal counsel for the Carter vs Canada 2012 case,

11:59.360 --> 12:04.040
but she was the lead legal counsel for all the other BCCLA cases happening at the same

12:04.040 --> 12:07.680
time, most notably a case regarding the rights of sex workers in British Columbia.

12:07.680 --> 12:11.600
It's entirely possible that Smith's ruling was biased based on her own past association

12:11.600 --> 12:16.080
with the BCCLA, as well as the fact that her own daughter stood to gain from a win.

12:16.080 --> 12:20.240
The government appealed Carter vs Canada 2012, where Smith's decision was overturned.

12:20.240 --> 12:23.840
The BCCLA also appealed, leading to Carter vs Canada 2015.

12:23.840 --> 12:27.720
The judge of that case, Chief Justice Beverly McLaughlin, has a long friendship with the

12:27.720 --> 12:31.840
president and director of the BCCLA, Lindsay Leister.

12:31.840 --> 12:46.120
Moreover, she has a personal attachment to the idea of euthanasia, after her husband

12:46.120 --> 12:49.800
asked her for help to end his life, long before this became a legal issue, something she admitted

12:49.800 --> 12:51.040
to in her memoir.

12:51.040 --> 12:57.240
The British Columbia Court of Appeal had rejected Sue's claim to assisted suicide, and she

12:57.240 --> 13:00.900
appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.

13:00.900 --> 13:05.840
As the hearing date approached, I worried whether I was still too close to Rory's death

13:05.840 --> 13:07.600
to sit on the case.

13:07.600 --> 13:11.860
I went to see my Chief Justice, now Antonio Lemaire.

13:11.860 --> 13:18.440
He had replaced Brian Dixon as Chief Justice when Brian retired in the spring of 1990.

13:18.440 --> 13:21.960
I'm not sure I should sit on this case, I said.

13:21.960 --> 13:29.040
I do not have settled views on the outcome, but I feel very close to it after...

13:29.040 --> 13:32.720
After what you went through with Rory, he interrupted, I nodded.

13:32.720 --> 13:36.200
You should not let that stop you from sitting, he said.

13:36.200 --> 13:41.160
Judges are human beings, they bring their life experiences to the cases they decide.

13:41.160 --> 13:45.800
One morning as he lay in his bed in our home, he asked a special thing of me to give him

13:45.800 --> 13:50.920
the morphine we had been doling out drop by drop, in a single massive dose.

13:50.960 --> 13:53.800
I want to die now, he said.

13:53.800 --> 13:57.460
Tears in my eyes, I left the room, I could not do it.

13:57.460 --> 14:00.060
I had always thought of myself as gutsy.

14:00.060 --> 14:05.960
I had never shrunk from unpleasant things, but this I knew in my heart I could not do,

14:05.960 --> 14:11.640
because it was against the law, because I could not physically bring myself to do it.

14:11.640 --> 14:16.800
Racked by guilt at failing my husband's last request, I wept in a hospital chair while

14:16.800 --> 14:19.200
Rory was in the adjoining treatment room.

14:19.200 --> 14:22.600
A doctor found me and I told him everything.

14:22.600 --> 14:24.920
I can't do it, I whispered.

14:24.920 --> 14:27.180
The doctor did not judge.

14:27.180 --> 14:30.280
Then you shouldn't do it, he said, remember you will go on.

14:30.280 --> 14:32.600
You have to live with yourself after.

14:32.600 --> 14:36.280
And then he added, we'll do what we can.

14:36.280 --> 14:40.200
Were the treatments that followed only for pain or did they shorten the remaining days

14:40.200 --> 14:41.380
of his life?

14:41.380 --> 14:43.880
I didn't know and I didn't ask.

14:43.880 --> 14:48.740
All I knew was that the pain lessened and Rory passed away peacefully.

14:48.740 --> 14:52.800
She dissented to a previous euthanasia ruling, Rodriguez vs British Columbia 1993, and then

14:52.800 --> 14:56.180
cited her own dissent in her ruling of Carter vs Canada 2015.

14:56.180 --> 15:01.300
It is also possible, like with Smith, McLaughlin was biased in her ruling, both in terms of

15:01.300 --> 15:05.220
her preconceived notions on the topic, which may or may not be a problem, but also in her

15:05.220 --> 15:09.660
personal relationships with the BCCLA, which is absolutely a problem.

15:09.660 --> 15:12.340
And to bring us back around to the start of the video, where I told my dry bread that

15:12.340 --> 15:16.440
legalizing a thing creates incentives, we are now actually approaching that point.

15:16.440 --> 15:20.360
Though the incentive isn't exactly financial, doctors are beginning to talk about euthanasia

15:20.360 --> 15:24.180
by organ donation, where the law does away with the safeguard that a person has to be

15:24.180 --> 15:26.060
dead before organs are harvested.

15:26.060 --> 15:30.080
Their idea is, if a person requests to die, doctors should euthanize them by removing

15:30.080 --> 15:34.240
their still living organs, increasing the chances of a successful transplant.

15:34.240 --> 15:38.120
The fact that one of the medical objectives in the debate, I think, is to sort out when

15:38.120 --> 15:42.680
we can retrieve organs from donation, helps us understand this values component of the

15:42.680 --> 15:43.680
ontological question.

15:43.680 --> 15:47.160
I mean, we're so invested in this dead donor rule.

15:47.160 --> 15:50.240
And I think that over time, that rule has become so ingrained in the medical community

15:50.240 --> 15:56.520
that we hold it out as a foundational principle, not only a rule, but a value.

15:56.520 --> 16:01.320
And I think just as likely, there are people who question that value now.

16:01.320 --> 16:05.320
And I know there's perhaps not an appetite to go there.

16:05.320 --> 16:10.240
But raising the question, is the dead donor rule even relevant?

16:10.240 --> 16:16.580
I think there are some who might want to say, I think back to other contentious debates

16:16.580 --> 16:21.600
in the past few years, and then where we're going with medical assistance and dying.

16:21.600 --> 16:26.200
The best use of my organs, if I'm going to receive a medically assisted death, might

16:26.200 --> 16:35.400
be to not first kill me, and then retrieve my organs, but to have my mode of death as

16:35.400 --> 16:39.320
we medically consider death now, to be to retrieve my organs.

16:39.320 --> 16:43.200
In principle, I am still ultimately pro euthanasia, because obviously you have the right to kill

16:43.200 --> 16:47.240
yourself, not just because you're terminally ill, but even for a stupid reason if you want.

16:47.240 --> 16:50.840
It always sounded dumb to me when governments make suicide illegal, it's like, what could

16:50.840 --> 16:52.920
you possibly punish them with a death sentence?

16:52.920 --> 16:56.800
But the reason it's illegal is to give the state legitimate pathways of interference

16:56.800 --> 16:58.640
with a suicide in progress.

16:58.640 --> 17:01.760
The rights conversation lands in the side of the individual to do what they want with

17:01.760 --> 17:03.300
their life, including ending it.

17:03.300 --> 17:07.040
But there seems to be a bunch of bad actors circling like vultures who have something

17:07.040 --> 17:09.440
to gain from making suicide more permissive.

17:09.440 --> 17:13.240
As the Canadian state begins to enshrine the right to euthanasia, and begins to slowly

17:13.240 --> 17:17.080
pick apart the reasonable gatekeeping measures on that right, we're starting to see these

17:17.080 --> 17:21.100
perverse incentives pop up, the end result of a group of people who are ideologically

17:21.100 --> 17:23.260
inclined to profit off the death of others.

17:23.260 --> 17:27.400
It may not strictly be financial profit, like with American Big Pharma jacking up the prices

17:27.400 --> 17:29.660
of simple drugs, but it's profit nonetheless.

17:29.660 --> 17:33.200
I predict that we're going to hear many more stories of people being told that they're

17:33.200 --> 17:37.440
selfish for being a burden and sucking up more healthcare instead of just dying as ordered,

17:37.440 --> 17:41.080
until the general public begins to realize exactly what type of a hole we've dug ourselves

17:41.080 --> 17:43.920
by allowing the state to have a moral stake in our health.

17:43.920 --> 17:47.760
Though universal healthcare can be good, the ultimate downside of such a system is that

17:47.760 --> 17:51.680
it's no longer your say whether or not your care gets funded, it's the government's.

17:51.680 --> 17:55.120
Before, you could get all the care you wanted if you paid for it, and yeah, that sucks people

17:55.120 --> 17:59.120
who can't pay, but now, your life continues at the whim of a bureaucrat who does not give

17:59.120 --> 18:00.120
a shit about you.
