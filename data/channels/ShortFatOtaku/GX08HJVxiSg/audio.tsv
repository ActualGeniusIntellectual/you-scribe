0	8500	It's finally time for a Canadian-centric video.
8500	12040	After all this time, I know there's been a lot of demand for certain Canadian topics
12040	13040	in recent months.
13040	15340	I've seen all those comments, so let's get right to it.
15340	18260	After all, a giant truck is headed our way right now.
18260	19260	And wouldn't you know it?
19260	20260	It's full of medical supplies!
20260	22900	What, uh, what do you think I was going to talk about today?
22900	27100	I had a conversation with MadriBread a year or two ago, where we briefly talked about
27100	28540	the ethics of euthanasia.
28540	32760	I pointed out in that conversation that while as a self-owned individual you do have the
32760	37200	right to take your own life, if you create an institution around legal suicide, you create
37200	39520	the possibility for perverse incentives.
39520	42760	I described to him a hypothetical future, where an old man who is a member of a poor
42760	46160	family, rather than become a financial burden on the medical system during the final years
46160	49440	of his life, the government offers him the chance of euthanasia and his family gets a
49440	50440	cash payout.
50440	54000	The point I was making was, if you legalize something, a necessary part of that process
54000	55640	is creating incentives for it.
55640	59460	This is one of the stronger arguments against legalization of recreational drugs.
59460	63340	Even if a person who's doing drugs and committing no other bad actions is ultimately committing
63340	67540	a victimless crime, making the drug use legal has downstream consequences.
67540	71320	People who would commit other crimes while high now have easier access.
71320	74700	People who wouldn't do drugs if they remained illegal now might do them.
74700	77520	The culture shifts towards permissibility of something that really isn't that good
77520	78520	for you.
78520	82080	And most importantly for this conversation, now there's a new financial motive for more
82080	84180	people to get into the drug market.
84180	86960	Doing almost anything leads to new incentives.
86960	92320	In Canada, MADE, Medical Assistance in Dying, became legal in 2016 to end the suffering
92320	96120	of terminally ill adults, after a 2015 legal decision from the Supreme Court.
96120	100520	That case, Carter vs Canada 2015, revolved around Kaye Carter, who was a victim of degenerative
100520	106060	spinal stenosis, and another woman, Gloria Taylor, a victim of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.
106060	110840	The ruling gave Canadian adults who were mentally competent and suffering intolerably and endurably
110840	113200	the right to a doctor's assistance in dying.
113220	117720	The original 2016 MADE legislation specifically disallowed assisted death on the grounds of
117720	122700	mental illness, long-term disability, or any curable condition, and did not make euthanasia
122700	124140	available to minors.
124140	128280	In 2021, the legislation was amended to allow for death on the grounds of mental illness,
128280	132380	and relaxed other stipulations, giving Canada the most permissive assisted suicide laws
132380	133380	in the world.
133380	137140	Nonetheless, the law only applies to Canadians, to prevent suicide tourism.
137140	141500	As per the letter of the law, patients who qualify must sign a written request expressing
141500	145080	their wishes to end their life in front of one independent witness who can confirm it
145080	146720	was done willingly free of coercion.
146720	151020	Then, two medical personnel must confirm their own written agreement that the patient's
151020	154660	condition is in an advanced state of irreversible decline, and that the patient is capable and
154660	156380	willing of receiving euthanasia.
156380	161400	The 2021 amendment added that if the patient's death is not reasonably foreseeable in the
161400	164880	future, another expert in the underlying condition also needs to sign off.
164880	168380	As a safeguard against abuse, none of the witnesses or physicians involved can have
168380	171480	any legal or financial interest in the outcomes of the patient.
171480	175920	The patient must repeatedly express consent, not just imply it, including at the moment
175920	177360	before their death.
177360	179820	Consent can be revoked at any time, in any way.
179820	183320	There are no consequences for revoking consent, and no limits on how many attempts you can
183320	184320	make.
184320	188080	These all seem like reasonable safeguards, especially since, in the absence of them,
188080	191920	you'd probably see a lot more abuse of the system, and also because people who kill themselves
191920	194760	outside the system also have infinite chances to do so.
194760	198100	I personally think that while you do have the right to kill yourself, in almost all
198100	201940	situations, you shouldn't, and society is made worse the more permissive exercising
201940	202940	that right becomes.
202940	207100	I do like the letter of the initial law as it reads, though I think the continued easing
207100	209180	of restrictions over time is quite bad.
209180	212800	It's important, though, to look at how the law actually functions in reality.
212800	217020	Over this past summer, the claim that MADE is the sixth leading cause of death as the
217020	220540	poor and disabled begin to check out of Canadian life went viral online.
220540	224420	This claim was roundly debunked by the fact checkers over at AFP, who said that the MADE
224420	227400	program is not a cause of death, but rather a manner of death.
227400	231440	Well, that's a great distinction, but it kinda sidesteps the criticism, doesn't it?
231440	234680	The core of the issue is whether or not Canada is euthanizing poor people.
234680	237680	It's one thing to say my condition is irreversible and I'd rather be dead.
237680	240880	It's another thing entirely to say I would rather keep living but it's too expensive
240880	242120	so I might as well die.
242120	246320	It seems like the line that all of those safeguards was meant to guard against was quickly crossed
246320	247960	by the Canadian government anyway.
247960	250640	I know what you might be thinking, Canada's got universal healthcare.
250640	253680	The wait times might be bad, yeah, but at least all your shit is paid for.
253680	257420	In America, if you can't afford care, you just go bankrupt or die without any help.
257420	260120	In Canada, that financial incentive is taken out of the equation.
260120	264100	That is the argument that a lot of pro-universal healthcare people make on this topic.
264100	266000	The removal of the financial incentive.
266000	269500	I still think that goal is achievable, at least somewhat, but Canada's done it so
269500	273280	poorly that at least on this topic, you might as well have no help at all.
273280	275340	Check out these examples and you'll see what I mean.
275340	278480	This testimony was given in parliament on November 10th, 2020.
278480	279780	My name is Roger Foley.
279780	281080	I'm 45 years old.
281080	285680	I was born with Spinocerebellar Ataxia, which is a severe neurodegenerative disease.
285680	289900	With the assisted dying regime in Canada, I have experienced the lack of care and assistance
289900	290900	I need to live.
290900	292360	I have been denied food and water.
292360	295500	I have not been assisted to transfer, take my medications, and go to the bathroom.
295500	299600	I have been abused and berated because I have disabilities and told my needs are too much
299600	300600	work.
300600	301600	My life has been devalued.
301600	306020	I have been coerced into assisted death by abuse, neglect, lack of care, and threats.
306020	309660	For example, at a time when I was advocating for assistance to live and for self-directed
309660	313600	home care, the hospital ethicist and nurses were trying to coerce me into an assisted
313600	318760	death by threatening to charge me $1,800 per day or force discharge me without the care
318760	319760	I needed to live.
319760	324200	I felt pressured by these staff raising assisted dying rather than relieving my suffering with
324200	326280	dignified and compassionate care.
326280	328760	Hospital staff failed to provide me with the necessities of life.
328760	331680	I was starved and denied water for up to 20 days.
331680	335120	An expert who reviewed the case concluded a failure to provide necessities of life and
335120	336480	gross negligence.
336480	340260	Foley leaked a recording to the Canadian press of doctors trying to get him on board with
340260	341260	euthanasia.
341260	346460	Roger Foley went from being active and healthy to disabled and helpless because of a rare
346460	348460	neurological disease.
348460	353100	For the past two and a half years, he's been in hospital in London, Ontario, part of a
353100	354960	health care standoff.
354960	357060	He wants assisted home care.
357060	360860	Instead, he says he's being offered a medically assisted death.
360860	365960	I have not received the care that I need to relieve my suffering, and only being offered
365960	367700	is dying.
367700	372680	And Foley is releasing audio tapes he took of what he says are two health care workers
372680	378400	who keep raising that option when he talks about getting home care teams of his choosing.
378400	383000	If I had self-directed farming, then I'd be fine, but...
383000	389960	But if you weren't, you just, you can just apply to get assisted if you want it in your
389960	390960	life.
390960	391960	Like, you know what I mean?
391960	394700	You don't have to do it in some dramatic manner.
394700	397940	You can apply for assisted, you know.
397940	404420	In the second, Foley is told he will be charged more than $1,500 a day if he doesn't go home,
404420	408100	with the suggestion he can apply for the right to die.
408100	410300	What's the plan that you know of?
410300	413020	Roger, this is not my show.
413020	418160	I told you my piece of this was to talk to you about if you had interest in assisted
418160	419160	dying.
419160	426200	In essence, the tape speaks about encouraging him or asking him if he's interested in assisted
426200	432460	dying rather than working with him to provide the services that he needs.
432460	433460	And he's not the only one.
433460	436600	A woman in Ontario chose maid after failing to get affordable housing.
436600	439820	The logic the medical system used to approve her was that the house she was stuck in was
439820	444740	not free of cigarette smoke and chemical cleaners, making her diagnosed extreme sensitivity to
444740	448000	chemicals in an advanced state of irreversible decline.
448000	451500	She posted a video a week before her death where she said, the government sees me as
451500	455180	expendable trash, a complainer, useless, and a pain in the ass.
455180	458820	Another woman applied to die because her medical problems required dietary restrictions that
458820	462160	she couldn't afford and COVID lockdowns ended her ability to make money.
462160	464660	She's not the only person who blamed COVID restrictions.
464660	466700	Another woman, this one from Vancouver, said the same thing.
466700	471300	A third woman, suffering from a concussion, had her care so postponed by COVID shutdowns
471300	475120	that her condition exacerbated to the point that her personality drastically changed.
475120	477880	She became irritable, unpredictable, and unable to focus.
477880	481180	She also ended up getting euthanized, and the family has brought charges against the
481180	484980	government claiming that she clearly did not have the capacity to consent based on her
484980	485980	condition.
485980	489540	Another man chose death because the quality of government healthcare was so poor he viewed
489540	491060	euthanasia as preferable.
491060	494940	When his family arrived at the long-term care facility to be with him during his final moments,
494940	498820	they found a room full of trash, piss and shit on the floor, and mold on the walls and
498820	499820	in the sink.
499820	502140	Family members claimed that their shoes were sticking to the floor as they walked through
502140	503140	the room.
503140	506380	Several photos were released to the press of the state of the room, but one photo wasn't
506380	507560	out of respect for the victim.
507560	511280	It showed him lying in a bed filled with his own filth, unable to help himself.
511280	515100	Another man had his story go viral recently, even though it happened several years ago.
515100	517400	He had some medical issues, but none of them were life-threatening.
517400	522480	In June of 2019, he was hospitalized, seemingly against his will, over fears he might be suicidal.
522480	525020	While he was stuck there, he asked his brother to come bust him out.
525020	528880	But within a month of his stay, he had submitted a request to be euthanized, claiming only
528880	531580	one health condition as the reason, hearing loss.
531580	536180	A suicidal man, stuck in a medical system that permits suicide, maybe even advocates
536180	538800	for suicide, ends up committing suicide.
538800	542540	Another story went viral around the same time, this time of a Canadian veteran who was suffering
542540	545400	from PTSD and a brain injury due to his service.
545400	549660	Somebody who was not at all suicidal was approached with an offer of euthanasia unprompted.
549660	553460	This event caused such an outrage that Veterans Affairs Canada admitted publicly that the
553460	557980	offer was inappropriate and that appropriate administrative action will be taken in response.
557980	561740	A mother with a 25-year-old daughter who had several debilitating medical conditions was
561740	565880	told out of the blue by a doctor that assisted suicide is now legal in Canada.
565880	569200	She was shocked and refused, upon which the doctor called her selfish.
569200	573520	The patient overheard the conversation and claims to be quite traumatized by the exchange.
573520	577300	Another man, this one with ALS, chose to die because he claimed the long-term care facility
577300	578480	was treating him poorly.
578480	580880	He instead opted to go back home and die with his family.
580880	584360	Two other people, one with muscular dystrophy and another with cerebral palsy, said the
584360	588480	government healthcare available to them is so poor they feel pushed into euthanasia.
588480	592820	And perhaps most egregiously is the case of a man who was approved for euthanasia whose
592820	597160	only problem was depression, a condition well known for having suicidal ideation as
597160	598160	a symptom.
598160	601880	Despite the claim that universal healthcare removes the financial incentive from the equation,
601880	605900	a lot of the conversations all of these people had with the medical system revolved around
605900	606900	resources.
606900	610380	Either they were threatened with outrageous additional fees not covered by the program
610380	614240	if they didn't comply, or they were told that they would be selfish in sucking up resources.
614240	618240	And this focus on the money is echoed in the October 2020 cost estimate for MADE.
618240	623920	After the 2016 era MADE rules, the government saved 86.9 million dollars implementing euthanasia
623920	626640	programs rather than caring for people until their natural end of life.
626640	631000	But the 2021 expansion of the program was estimated to save an additional 62 million.
631000	634520	This idea that it's only private business that cares about money and governments would
634520	638320	never cut corners to save a buck, even if it means acting unethically, is just ridiculous.
638320	640880	We've got to ask the question, how the hell did we get here?
640880	643820	Well, I'm going to go down a little bit of a conspiracy rabbit hole on this one.
643820	647840	I don't know if this is what happened, but there is at least some circumstantial evidence.
647840	652200	The 2021 expansion of the MADE program, the requirement that was designed to stop people
652200	655680	from getting euthanized unless they had a debilitating deteriorating condition that
655680	659480	was never getting better, that was taken out in response to two lawsuits.
659480	663740	The first one is Truchon vs Canada 2019 in Quebec, oh god I'm going to butcher every
663740	667940	French name in this, where the judge ruled that the clause violated the charter guarantee
667940	669560	of equal protection under the law.
669560	675080	The judge presiding over that case was Justice Christine Beaudoin, I don't know, it's a French
675080	676080	name.
676080	679760	The judge's father, Jean-Louis, has long been an advocate of unfettered euthanasia
679760	684840	access, going back decades, though his writings on this topic are almost entirely in French.
684840	689140	Considering one of her father's lifelong political goals is unfettered euthanasia access,
689140	693520	a goal she seems to share, she may have been too biased to judge on a case on that very
693520	694520	same topic.
694520	697720	The second case is the precursor to the one that I spoke at the beginning of this video,
697720	701680	Carter vs Canada 2012, where the judge, Lynn Smith, gave a similar ruling.
701680	706520	The plaintiff is represented by the BCCLA, the British Columbia Civil Liberties Association.
706520	710320	Lynn Smith is a former board member of the BCCLA before becoming a judge, and at the
710320	714880	time of the trial, Smith's daughter was working with the BCCLA as a legal counsel.
714880	719360	Her daughter wasn't, on paper, the lead legal counsel for the Carter vs Canada 2012 case,
719360	724040	but she was the lead legal counsel for all the other BCCLA cases happening at the same
724040	727680	time, most notably a case regarding the rights of sex workers in British Columbia.
727680	731600	It's entirely possible that Smith's ruling was biased based on her own past association
731600	736080	with the BCCLA, as well as the fact that her own daughter stood to gain from a win.
736080	740240	The government appealed Carter vs Canada 2012, where Smith's decision was overturned.
740240	743840	The BCCLA also appealed, leading to Carter vs Canada 2015.
743840	747720	The judge of that case, Chief Justice Beverly McLaughlin, has a long friendship with the
747720	751840	president and director of the BCCLA, Lindsay Leister.
751840	766120	Moreover, she has a personal attachment to the idea of euthanasia, after her husband
766120	769800	asked her for help to end his life, long before this became a legal issue, something she admitted
769800	771040	to in her memoir.
771040	777240	The British Columbia Court of Appeal had rejected Sue's claim to assisted suicide, and she
777240	780900	appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.
780900	785840	As the hearing date approached, I worried whether I was still too close to Rory's death
785840	787600	to sit on the case.
787600	791860	I went to see my Chief Justice, now Antonio Lemaire.
791860	798440	He had replaced Brian Dixon as Chief Justice when Brian retired in the spring of 1990.
798440	801960	I'm not sure I should sit on this case, I said.
801960	809040	I do not have settled views on the outcome, but I feel very close to it after...
809040	812720	After what you went through with Rory, he interrupted, I nodded.
812720	816200	You should not let that stop you from sitting, he said.
816200	821160	Judges are human beings, they bring their life experiences to the cases they decide.
821160	825800	One morning as he lay in his bed in our home, he asked a special thing of me to give him
825800	830920	the morphine we had been doling out drop by drop, in a single massive dose.
830960	833800	I want to die now, he said.
833800	837460	Tears in my eyes, I left the room, I could not do it.
837460	840060	I had always thought of myself as gutsy.
840060	845960	I had never shrunk from unpleasant things, but this I knew in my heart I could not do,
845960	851640	because it was against the law, because I could not physically bring myself to do it.
851640	856800	Racked by guilt at failing my husband's last request, I wept in a hospital chair while
856800	859200	Rory was in the adjoining treatment room.
859200	862600	A doctor found me and I told him everything.
862600	864920	I can't do it, I whispered.
864920	867180	The doctor did not judge.
867180	870280	Then you shouldn't do it, he said, remember you will go on.
870280	872600	You have to live with yourself after.
872600	876280	And then he added, we'll do what we can.
876280	880200	Were the treatments that followed only for pain or did they shorten the remaining days
880200	881380	of his life?
881380	883880	I didn't know and I didn't ask.
883880	888740	All I knew was that the pain lessened and Rory passed away peacefully.
888740	892800	She dissented to a previous euthanasia ruling, Rodriguez vs British Columbia 1993, and then
892800	896180	cited her own dissent in her ruling of Carter vs Canada 2015.
896180	901300	It is also possible, like with Smith, McLaughlin was biased in her ruling, both in terms of
901300	905220	her preconceived notions on the topic, which may or may not be a problem, but also in her
905220	909660	personal relationships with the BCCLA, which is absolutely a problem.
909660	912340	And to bring us back around to the start of the video, where I told my dry bread that
912340	916440	legalizing a thing creates incentives, we are now actually approaching that point.
916440	920360	Though the incentive isn't exactly financial, doctors are beginning to talk about euthanasia
920360	924180	by organ donation, where the law does away with the safeguard that a person has to be
924180	926060	dead before organs are harvested.
926060	930080	Their idea is, if a person requests to die, doctors should euthanize them by removing
930080	934240	their still living organs, increasing the chances of a successful transplant.
934240	938120	The fact that one of the medical objectives in the debate, I think, is to sort out when
938120	942680	we can retrieve organs from donation, helps us understand this values component of the
942680	943680	ontological question.
943680	947160	I mean, we're so invested in this dead donor rule.
947160	950240	And I think that over time, that rule has become so ingrained in the medical community
950240	956520	that we hold it out as a foundational principle, not only a rule, but a value.
956520	961320	And I think just as likely, there are people who question that value now.
961320	965320	And I know there's perhaps not an appetite to go there.
965320	970240	But raising the question, is the dead donor rule even relevant?
970240	976580	I think there are some who might want to say, I think back to other contentious debates
976580	981600	in the past few years, and then where we're going with medical assistance and dying.
981600	986200	The best use of my organs, if I'm going to receive a medically assisted death, might
986200	995400	be to not first kill me, and then retrieve my organs, but to have my mode of death as
995400	999320	we medically consider death now, to be to retrieve my organs.
999320	1003200	In principle, I am still ultimately pro euthanasia, because obviously you have the right to kill
1003200	1007240	yourself, not just because you're terminally ill, but even for a stupid reason if you want.
1007240	1010840	It always sounded dumb to me when governments make suicide illegal, it's like, what could
1010840	1012920	you possibly punish them with a death sentence?
1012920	1016800	But the reason it's illegal is to give the state legitimate pathways of interference
1016800	1018640	with a suicide in progress.
1018640	1021760	The rights conversation lands in the side of the individual to do what they want with
1021760	1023300	their life, including ending it.
1023300	1027040	But there seems to be a bunch of bad actors circling like vultures who have something
1027040	1029440	to gain from making suicide more permissive.
1029440	1033240	As the Canadian state begins to enshrine the right to euthanasia, and begins to slowly
1033240	1037080	pick apart the reasonable gatekeeping measures on that right, we're starting to see these
1037080	1041100	perverse incentives pop up, the end result of a group of people who are ideologically
1041100	1043260	inclined to profit off the death of others.
1043260	1047400	It may not strictly be financial profit, like with American Big Pharma jacking up the prices
1047400	1049660	of simple drugs, but it's profit nonetheless.
1049660	1053200	I predict that we're going to hear many more stories of people being told that they're
1053200	1057440	selfish for being a burden and sucking up more healthcare instead of just dying as ordered,
1057440	1061080	until the general public begins to realize exactly what type of a hole we've dug ourselves
1061080	1063920	by allowing the state to have a moral stake in our health.
1063920	1067760	Though universal healthcare can be good, the ultimate downside of such a system is that
1067760	1071680	it's no longer your say whether or not your care gets funded, it's the government's.
1071680	1075120	Before, you could get all the care you wanted if you paid for it, and yeah, that sucks people
1075120	1079120	who can't pay, but now, your life continues at the whim of a bureaucrat who does not give
1079120	1080120	a shit about you.
