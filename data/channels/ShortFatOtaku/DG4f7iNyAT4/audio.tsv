0	5200	Hey guys! A few of you, actually a lot of you, have asked about the anime content of our channel.
5200	9800	Most of you came here because we used to do only anime reviews, and that's what you wanted to see.
9800	12700	Although nowadays we do a whole lot of other stuff too.
12700	17900	Well those of you waiting on anime content, did you know we've been releasing riffs of Bible Black, the New Testament all this time?
17900	24700	YouTube doesn't accept hand-to-eye or non-safe work videos, so whenever we do them they go up on our BlipTV page or our currently in beta website.
24700	31400	In that same vein, did you know we've also done riffs of the first season of Bible Black, and Boku no Pico, only available at those places?
31400	36900	As for future anime content, I don't mean riffs of hand-to-eye but actual reviews. They are coming.
36900	41100	The final part of Bible Black, the New Testament will be uploaded at the same time as this video,
41100	46700	and then throughout the summer I will be releasing one anime related video every two weeks.
46700	49900	This won't disrupt the video game stuff or anything else we've been releasing,
49900	54600	it's just me getting back on track regarding what a lot of people have been asking for for months.
54600	80800	YouTube doesn't accept hand-to-eye or non-safe work videos, so whenever we do them they go up on our BlipTV page or our currently in beta website.
80800	89500	This won't disrupt the video game stuff or anything else we've been releasing, it's just me getting back on track.
