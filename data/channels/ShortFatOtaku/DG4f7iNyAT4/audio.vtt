Hey guys! A few of you, actually a lot of you, have asked about the anime content of our channel.

00:05.200 --> 00:09.800
Most of you came here because we used to do only anime reviews, and that's what you wanted to see.

00:09.800 --> 00:12.700
Although nowadays we do a whole lot of other stuff too.

00:12.700 --> 00:17.900
Well those of you waiting on anime content, did you know we've been releasing riffs of Bible Black, the New Testament all this time?

00:17.900 --> 00:24.700
YouTube doesn't accept hand-to-eye or non-safe work videos, so whenever we do them they go up on our BlipTV page or our currently in beta website.

00:24.700 --> 00:31.400
In that same vein, did you know we've also done riffs of the first season of Bible Black, and Boku no Pico, only available at those places?

00:31.400 --> 00:36.900
As for future anime content, I don't mean riffs of hand-to-eye but actual reviews. They are coming.

00:36.900 --> 00:41.100
The final part of Bible Black, the New Testament will be uploaded at the same time as this video,

00:41.100 --> 00:46.700
and then throughout the summer I will be releasing one anime related video every two weeks.

00:46.700 --> 00:49.900
This won't disrupt the video game stuff or anything else we've been releasing,

00:49.900 --> 00:54.600
it's just me getting back on track regarding what a lot of people have been asking for for months.

00:54.600 --> 01:20.800
YouTube doesn't accept hand-to-eye or non-safe work videos, so whenever we do them they go up on our BlipTV page or our currently in beta website.

01:20.800 --> 01:29.500
This won't disrupt the video game stuff or anything else we've been releasing, it's just me getting back on track.
