00:00.000 --> 00:10.480
In the past few weeks, like a hundred people have asked me to talk about Jack Murphy.

00:10.480 --> 00:12.760
So here we go!

00:12.760 --> 00:16.660
Jack Murphy is one of those masculinity gurus that seem to be a dime a dozen on the internet

00:16.660 --> 00:17.840
right nowadays.

00:17.840 --> 00:21.920
You know the type, these gruff, older, muscled men who might make video content or maybe

00:21.920 --> 00:25.760
write a blog or something, instructing young men about the traditional masculine gender

00:25.760 --> 00:26.760
role.

00:26.760 --> 00:30.500
One version of this is a website called The Liminal Order, where for the low low price

00:30.500 --> 00:34.680
of $100 a month, Jesus, he will teach you how to be a real man.

00:34.680 --> 00:40.140
At the end of December 2021, he appeared on Sidney Watson's stream, where a few superchats

00:40.140 --> 00:43.080
asked him about the cuck article.

00:43.080 --> 01:05.080
Even though Watson genuinely didn't understand what was going on, Murphy still reacted poorly

01:05.080 --> 01:09.400
to the reference, even going so far as to march out of their studio saying fuck you.

01:09.400 --> 01:16.820
When the show did end, Jack got up, I made an attempt to apologize or to at least ask

01:16.820 --> 01:20.260
what had happened and what had made him react that way.

01:20.260 --> 01:25.840
He told me to go fuck myself, or he either said go fuck yourself or he said fuck you

01:25.840 --> 01:29.160
again, I can't remember which, and then he left.

01:29.160 --> 01:33.760
At that point, Elijah went to go and talk to him to see if the situation might be resolved

01:33.760 --> 01:36.520
and that is when they went to go and get drinks.

01:36.520 --> 01:40.080
Apparently, Watson's editor smoothed things over with him later.

01:40.080 --> 01:45.280
Nonetheless, Murphy felt the need to go on Tim Pool's show and throw shade at Watson

03:45.280 --> 03:56.260
that

03:56.260 --> 04:13.340
The

04:13.340 --> 04:17.140
cuck article in question has been mysteriously scrubbed off the wayback machine.

04:17.140 --> 04:18.500
I wonder how that happened.

04:18.500 --> 04:21.540
But you know what, it's still easy enough to find if you know where to look.

04:21.540 --> 04:25.500
It's titled Cultivating Erotic Energy from a Surprising Source.

04:25.500 --> 04:31.580
October 9th, 2015 by Jack Murphy Today I sent my adoring, loyal, hot girlfriend

04:31.580 --> 04:34.980
of two years to have sex with a stranger from Tinder.

04:34.980 --> 04:39.100
She is currently at his apartment, checked in with me via text, and is presumably sucking

04:39.100 --> 04:41.140
and fucking her way to a good time.

04:41.140 --> 04:42.940
I'm alone writing.

04:42.940 --> 04:43.940
Couldn't be happier.

04:43.940 --> 04:46.580
Um, alright dude.

04:46.580 --> 04:50.500
All jokes aside, if you continue to read this article you can kinda see where he's going

04:50.500 --> 04:51.500
with this.

04:51.500 --> 04:54.980
I've learned over time how my natural disposition is to be dominant.

04:54.980 --> 04:57.180
For submissive women, I'm practically an ideal.

04:57.180 --> 05:04.480
I've had sex slaves, little girls, and tied them all up.

05:04.480 --> 05:07.620
Feminists seek me out to fuck them like the patriarchy.

05:07.620 --> 05:09.020
Jesus Christ dude.

05:09.020 --> 05:10.460
Like yeah, I get it.

05:10.460 --> 05:15.040
The whole LG thing is a kink about women who want to basically act like bratty children

05:15.040 --> 05:18.320
and then get put in their place by their dominant daddies.

05:18.320 --> 05:22.440
But if you're not somebody who's terminally online, this just reads really fucking weird.

05:22.440 --> 05:24.760
The edge gets far from center eventually.

05:24.760 --> 05:26.960
Excitement and novelty can wear off.

05:26.960 --> 05:28.360
Even novelty becomes boring.

05:28.360 --> 05:32.200
There are only so many approaches to sex, so many different ways of doing it.

05:32.200 --> 05:34.560
Only so many different kinds of people and lovers.

05:34.560 --> 05:39.120
For me, and those of us who like to push the edge, eventually the only areas left to explore

05:39.120 --> 05:42.360
become things you can only do as an evolved couple.

05:42.360 --> 05:46.200
You know, to me this actually sounds like you're a coomer who's become so desensitized

05:46.200 --> 05:50.220
to regular sex that you actually need some crazy shit to get off.

05:50.220 --> 05:53.080
You know Jack, no fat would probably do you some good.

05:53.080 --> 05:56.320
The entire experience is regimented according to my rules.

05:56.320 --> 05:57.640
I introduced her to the idea.

05:57.640 --> 05:58.640
I pushed it.

05:58.640 --> 06:00.580
I told her to go on Tinder and find someone.

06:00.580 --> 06:04.040
On the day in question, I tell her when and where to do it.

06:04.040 --> 06:05.780
She checks in with me via text.

06:05.780 --> 06:07.920
I know where she is and I'm waiting for her.

06:07.920 --> 06:08.920
She's not alone.

06:08.920 --> 06:12.960
She is on a mission sent directly by me, and the entire point is for me to get turned on

06:12.960 --> 06:15.120
in a way that wouldn't happen otherwise.

06:15.120 --> 06:18.720
This passage is the core of the matter, and this is probably the one point he actually

06:18.720 --> 06:19.720
has.

06:19.720 --> 06:23.000
True enough, by the modern meaning of the word cuck, he's not actually being cucked

06:23.000 --> 06:27.560
because the idea behind cucking is that the bull acts in order to humiliate the man, while

06:27.560 --> 06:31.480
Murphy's describing a scenario that he has set up for her to play a role in, regardless

06:31.480 --> 06:32.480
of her own will.

06:32.480 --> 06:36.820
In other words, a cuck is a guy who consents to having a more dominant man fuck his girl

06:36.820 --> 06:40.200
because he gets off on the feeling of being emasculated and degraded.

06:40.200 --> 06:42.400
However, Murphy's situation is the opposite.

06:42.400 --> 06:46.720
He's having a less dominant man fuck his girl in order to make her feel degraded and

06:46.720 --> 06:48.840
to further establish his own dominance.

06:48.840 --> 06:50.500
It's kind of like pimping in a way.

06:50.500 --> 06:55.220
Even if a pimp fucks his hoes, nobody would call him a cuck when his hoes fuck John's.

06:55.220 --> 06:59.560
But the problem with Murphy's behavior was probably best described by Sargon on his channel

06:59.560 --> 07:01.060
when he talked about this event.

07:01.060 --> 07:04.520
It might make Murphy an alpha, but it doesn't make him a man.

07:04.520 --> 07:05.520
And I agree.

07:05.520 --> 07:06.860
You might be the dominant one.

07:06.860 --> 07:08.400
You might be in control.

07:08.400 --> 07:13.000
But what do you think it does to the quality, the fabric of your relationship if you act

07:13.000 --> 07:16.840
like a pimp and the girl that you're supposed to cherish acts like a hoe?

07:16.840 --> 07:21.560
What makes this whole thing an actual story in the sense of Internet drama is that after

07:21.560 --> 07:26.600
the Sidney Watson super chat, Jack Murphy repeatedly self-destructed in an attempt to

07:26.600 --> 07:27.920
prevent this from going viral.

07:27.920 --> 07:30.440
In other words, he went full Streisand effect.

07:30.440 --> 07:34.660
The extra attention drawn to the article and Murphy's horrible reaction to it got the attention

07:34.660 --> 07:36.280
of the Internet super sleuths.

07:36.280 --> 07:39.400
I'm not going into too much detail because this is going up on YouTube, but there's a

07:39.400 --> 07:43.560
pile of old pictures and videos where both his girl was fucking other men while he watched

07:43.560 --> 07:46.280
and where he put a bunch of stuff up his own butt.

07:46.280 --> 07:47.280
Now that's what you're into.

07:47.280 --> 07:48.280
Good on you.

07:48.280 --> 07:49.280
Do whatever you want.

07:49.280 --> 07:50.280
I don't care.

07:50.280 --> 07:53.280
But every time a new video or a new bit of info from his past dropped, he'd go on another

07:53.280 --> 07:55.240
Internet meltdown at the height of it.

07:55.240 --> 07:59.120
He was blaming everybody reporting on the event for being part of a revenge porn scandal,

07:59.120 --> 08:02.820
which is a charge that does come with legal ramifications in a lot of places while also

08:02.820 --> 08:07.540
filing DMCA claims everywhere he could to get as many YouTube videos and tweets taken

08:07.540 --> 08:08.940
down as possible.

08:08.940 --> 08:13.020
Murphy turned the liminal order into his own personal war room in an attempt to mobilize

08:13.020 --> 08:15.740
his community against everybody who dared to speak about this.

08:15.740 --> 08:18.980
Sidney Watson, Tim Pool, The Quartering, and everybody else.

08:18.980 --> 08:23.300
Meanwhile, the Internet decided to start up a competing website, The Riminal Order.

08:23.300 --> 08:24.740
And yes, all these links work.

08:24.740 --> 08:26.940
There is a YouTube and a merch store and everything else.

08:26.940 --> 08:28.900
I fucking love the Internet, dude.

08:28.980 --> 08:32.380
Eventually, Jack Murphy dropped a passage where he came clean, admitting that it was

08:32.380 --> 08:36.220
all done when he was short on cash and he was desperate after having lost his job during

08:36.220 --> 08:37.620
a prior canceling event.

08:37.620 --> 08:41.040
The context of that is that he used to work for a school board in some capacity where

08:41.040 --> 08:45.700
back in 2018, some of his online Manosphere content caught up with him and he was let

08:45.700 --> 08:48.780
go, a topic that he talked about on an older episode of Tim Pool.

08:48.780 --> 08:53.380
There has been this ongoing tactic used, I would say, by both sides.

08:53.380 --> 08:55.700
And I don't want to accuse either side of you of using one or the other, but we've seen

08:55.700 --> 08:59.780
it a bit, where they dig up old posts or they accuse them of being something they're not.

08:59.780 --> 09:03.380
And I think a lot of this false accusation stuff of calling people a Nazi or a white supremacist

09:03.380 --> 09:05.380
has come from the left.

09:05.380 --> 09:10.980
Today, I'm going to sit here with Jack Murphy, who is targeted by a campaign specifically

09:10.980 --> 09:13.380
doing this, calling you a white supremacist.

09:13.380 --> 09:15.700
A Nazi and no one associated with which one?

09:15.700 --> 09:16.740
Well, there you go.

09:16.740 --> 09:20.980
Once Lacey McCall had made these accusations for me, then they went digging through old

09:20.980 --> 09:23.300
posts that I had actually deleted.

09:23.300 --> 09:28.100
So they went to the internet archives, as it were, and dug up old stuff that I had written.

09:28.100 --> 09:33.620
When I very first started blogging, completely anonymous, no pictures, pen name, everything.

09:33.620 --> 09:37.300
My first thing I started writing about was sex and relationships.

09:37.300 --> 09:46.020
And one of the things I was writing about were BDSM relationships, consensual adult sexual relationships.

09:46.020 --> 09:49.620
In order to make ends meet, he did all of that crazy stuff and he now regrets it.

09:49.620 --> 09:51.220
And you know what?

09:51.220 --> 09:54.100
If Jack Murphy had said this at the start of the controversy, he probably would have

09:54.100 --> 09:54.980
just slipped by.

09:54.980 --> 09:56.260
He would have had a round of teasing.

09:56.260 --> 09:59.220
And if he took his lumps without complaint, it would have been over and done with.

09:59.220 --> 10:01.460
A true man would know this intuitively.

10:01.460 --> 10:04.820
Instead, he complained and fought the people who dared to speak the truth.

10:04.820 --> 10:06.580
And so he furthered his own destruction.

10:06.580 --> 10:10.820
The smart thing to do, in fact, would be to use his experience to bolster his claims.

10:10.820 --> 10:14.660
If he truly wants to be a beacon of masculinity to his audience, he should have said that

10:14.660 --> 10:18.340
he went down this destructive road, that he tried the cucking and the porn and that it

10:18.340 --> 10:18.900
ruined him.

10:18.900 --> 10:21.700
He doesn't want the next generation of men coming up to make the same mistake.

10:21.700 --> 10:25.940
If his job is to teach these men about masculinity, then this event is how you teach them.

10:25.940 --> 10:27.780
Instead, he taught them the opposite.

10:27.780 --> 10:29.700
There's a fellow I followed on Twitter for a while now.

10:29.700 --> 10:30.980
His name's iHypocrite.

10:30.980 --> 10:33.940
I followed him back during gamergate, and I kept re-following him out of habit every

10:33.940 --> 10:35.060
time I got a new Twitter account.

10:35.060 --> 10:38.580
I know absolutely nothing about this guy, only that the content he posts is sometimes

10:38.580 --> 10:38.820
funny.

10:38.820 --> 10:39.380
That's it.

10:39.380 --> 10:43.540
One day, another one of these Jack Murphy-like masculine accounts posted this.

10:43.540 --> 10:44.740
You need to kill the boy.

10:44.740 --> 10:48.580
No more video games, no more little Japanese cartoons, no more fantasy football, which

10:48.580 --> 10:52.260
is Dungeons and Dragons for jocks, no more large groups of men goofing around in dorms

10:52.260 --> 10:56.580
and studio apartments, no more Full Send and That's Liddy, no more beer pong, no more

10:56.580 --> 10:57.060
Drake.

10:57.060 --> 11:01.780
The idea being, these interests are impediments to growing up, which is a common enough theme

11:01.780 --> 11:03.780
among conservative masculine-centric spheres.

11:03.780 --> 11:04.980
And you know what, fair enough.

11:04.980 --> 11:09.060
After the post went viral, iHypocrite replied with, I love tweets like this because people

11:09.060 --> 11:12.420
wouldn't get so extremely pressed if you weren't touching on something.

11:12.420 --> 11:14.100
Also, fair enough, good point.

11:14.100 --> 11:17.860
Lots of people got angry at the original tweet because they like their video games, maybe

11:17.860 --> 11:20.580
a little bit too much, and they probably felt personally attacked.

11:20.580 --> 11:23.620
I didn't feel personally attacked, but I do love my video games.

11:23.620 --> 11:24.900
But here's where the fun begins.

11:24.900 --> 11:29.220
iHypocrite received this reply, I don't think the people enjoying their hobbies are pressed.

11:29.220 --> 11:33.300
This guy seems to be enjoying himself, and he attached a picture of iHypocrite from 2015,

11:33.300 --> 11:38.500
where he says, this is me, I live in BC, I play PS3, dumb diddle dee, looking like the

11:38.500 --> 11:40.260
quintessential beta soy boy.

11:40.260 --> 11:44.340
Now I thought this was funny, the juxtaposition between this masculine orientation and his

11:44.340 --> 11:45.140
past self.

11:45.140 --> 11:46.500
So I retweeted it.

11:46.500 --> 11:47.380
A grave sin.

11:47.380 --> 11:49.940
I didn't say anything, I didn't comment, I just retweeted.

11:49.940 --> 11:51.700
And iHypocrite blocked me for that.

11:51.700 --> 11:54.820
And then he decided to devote a segment on his stream about me.

11:54.820 --> 11:55.220
Geez.

12:17.460 --> 12:22.020
And I always thought this guy was kind of a weasel, so when I saw that, I blocked him.

12:22.900 --> 12:25.620
You know, I had no idea this guy knew who I was.

12:25.620 --> 12:28.660
I'm not exactly SFO on Twitter, for obvious reasons.

12:28.660 --> 12:31.300
And he plays off this entire rant like he doesn't know who I am.

12:31.300 --> 12:34.420
Not to say that you should know who I am, but I have a feeling that he does.

12:34.420 --> 12:35.780
Short fat otaku.

12:35.780 --> 12:38.660
I'm gonna talk about this guy for a sec, and then wrap it up.

12:39.380 --> 12:41.860
So this is him, I guess.

12:41.860 --> 12:48.740
He's the the fat guy here, wearing the Five Nights at Freddy's t-shirt.

12:48.740 --> 12:50.500
This screenshot is from my gaming channel.

12:50.500 --> 12:52.660
It's at least two years old, judging by the old couch.

12:52.660 --> 12:55.940
Probably older, judging by the relative lack of gray hair and Dave's beard.

12:55.940 --> 12:59.140
And it's from Naomi's birthday stream, because she's wearing the birthday hat.

12:59.140 --> 13:02.980
This is not a common image of me floating around, at least it wasn't before this event.

13:02.980 --> 13:05.700
The most common image of me that can be found online is this one.

13:05.700 --> 13:09.140
This is the one that is overwhelmingly used in hit pieces written about me, and videos

13:09.140 --> 13:11.300
made about me, if they're not using my channel avatar.

13:11.300 --> 13:14.740
In other words, before this all went down, if you didn't know anything about me, and

13:14.740 --> 13:17.860
you wanted to talk about me and use a picture, this is the picture that you would stumble

13:17.860 --> 13:19.140
upon on Google Images.

13:19.140 --> 13:23.780
If you watch my tiny ass gaming side channel, that has none of the clout or reach that SFO

13:23.780 --> 13:26.660
does, then maybe you'll find couch pics like this.

13:26.660 --> 13:31.940
Yeah, I wonder why this guy would be a little bit sensitive about somebody pointing out

13:33.700 --> 13:36.260
people in their perpetual adolescence.

13:36.260 --> 13:38.100
Who's calling who sensitive?

13:38.100 --> 13:40.740
Here, let's see how many people have got blocked on Twitter.

13:40.740 --> 13:42.100
Oh, the list is empty.

13:42.100 --> 13:43.620
I wonder why that could be.

13:43.620 --> 13:48.260
I wonder why he would get so triggered over me laughing at somebody else's tweet that

13:48.260 --> 13:55.300
he felt the need to launch into personal attacks on my appearance on an eight-year-old photo

13:55.300 --> 13:55.940
of me.

13:55.940 --> 13:56.980
What personal attack?

13:56.980 --> 13:58.180
Where's the personal attack?

13:58.180 --> 13:59.700
I retweeted it because it was funny.

13:59.700 --> 14:02.500
It does sound like you're taking this a lot more seriously than I am.

14:02.500 --> 14:09.220
Imagine the cognitive dissonance you have to have to think that you're going to make

14:09.220 --> 14:16.900
fun of somebody because 10 years ago they were in almost as bad a shape as you're in

14:16.900 --> 14:17.220
now.

14:19.220 --> 14:19.940
You know what I'm saying?

14:23.380 --> 14:28.740
How are you going to make fun of somebody's looks when that's what you look like?

14:28.740 --> 14:30.500
And this is really the core of it, isn't it?

14:30.500 --> 14:33.220
You said earlier that I was mad, but you know I'm not mad.

14:33.220 --> 14:34.420
You know I'm making fun of you.

14:34.420 --> 14:35.620
You just admitted it.

14:35.620 --> 14:36.980
That's the real point here.

14:36.980 --> 14:40.740
There was stuff that I cut out like comparing our reach on Twitter or comments about lolicon

14:40.740 --> 14:43.060
because they just have no relevance to this conversation.

14:43.060 --> 14:48.020
They're just side jabs to I guess show that he's totally not angry, but this is the real

14:48.020 --> 14:48.500
point.

14:48.500 --> 14:52.660
This conversation isn't really about the fact that you were once a soy boy and now you're

14:52.660 --> 14:54.420
not or at least you claim you're not.

14:54.420 --> 14:55.940
That it's the same either way.

14:55.940 --> 14:59.460
What truly matters here is your inability to make fun of yourself.

14:59.460 --> 15:02.660
Do you think I don't know what I look like or what my deficiencies are?

15:02.660 --> 15:06.740
Do you think this picture isn't somehow me playing off of that for the benefit of my

15:06.740 --> 15:07.460
audience?

15:07.460 --> 15:08.500
Listen, I hypocrite.

15:09.220 --> 15:10.500
We're on YouTube.

15:10.500 --> 15:11.860
That means we're entertainers.

15:11.860 --> 15:15.380
Sometimes that means we have serious discussions about real topics and hopefully provoke some

15:15.380 --> 15:16.500
thoughts in our viewers.

15:16.500 --> 15:19.300
Sometimes that means we act like clowns and make people laugh.

15:19.300 --> 15:24.020
But what it always means is that we perform at the pleasure of an audience with the expectation

15:24.020 --> 15:25.380
that we give them something.

15:25.380 --> 15:27.300
Something funny, something interesting, something.

15:27.300 --> 15:28.980
And in exchange for that, we get paid.

15:29.540 --> 15:30.500
That's the job.

15:30.500 --> 15:31.940
Sure, it bothers me that I'm fat.

15:31.940 --> 15:32.820
I'm working on it.

15:32.820 --> 15:36.660
But if somebody can get joy at laughing at the fat guy, that means that I've earned my

15:36.660 --> 15:37.700
keep for another day.

15:37.700 --> 15:41.780
And if that also means that I do a goofy voice or I strike a pose or I write a script or

15:41.780 --> 15:45.940
I record a video or I analyze an idea, that is my job.

15:45.940 --> 15:50.180
Why are you so angry that people make fun of the you that existed seven years ago?

15:50.180 --> 15:53.780
And why are you so adamant about framing it as anything other than being mad?

15:53.780 --> 15:55.620
Are you that insecure?

15:55.620 --> 15:56.420
I mean, don't answer.

15:56.420 --> 15:57.620
The answer is obviously yes.

15:57.620 --> 16:01.300
And it's that insecurity that made me want to talk about the side story in a video about

16:01.300 --> 16:02.020
Jack Murphy.

16:02.020 --> 16:06.020
All of these people who talk the big masculine talk on the Internet, it does seem like when

16:06.020 --> 16:09.620
you dig beneath the surface, almost all of them are actually insecure.

16:09.620 --> 16:12.020
And yes, I can hear the right out objection right now.

16:12.020 --> 16:15.140
It's what academic agent called the liberal need to pathologize and project.

16:15.140 --> 16:16.420
But no, it's actually true.

16:16.420 --> 16:20.340
It's even true for him, considering what he used to get up to in his now current hyper

16:20.340 --> 16:21.620
traditionalist stance.

16:21.620 --> 16:25.220
Masculinity, insofar as it's socially constructed, is a habit.

16:25.220 --> 16:29.300
Sure, there is a biological component to it, but regarding that non biological component

16:29.300 --> 16:32.660
of it, reading about it on the liminal order or listening to motivational videos can only

16:32.660 --> 16:33.460
get you so far.

16:33.460 --> 16:35.780
You have to do masculinity.

16:35.780 --> 16:39.380
That is the fundamental flaw with the Jack Murphy's and the Mike Cernovich's of the

16:39.380 --> 16:39.860
world.

16:39.860 --> 16:43.460
Even when they might have something of value to offer in their writing, you learn it far

16:43.460 --> 16:47.700
better by having habits instilled in you from your own father, assuming he's around and

16:47.700 --> 16:48.500
he's a good parent.

16:48.500 --> 16:51.460
And if he's not, though, that doesn't mean you're just doomed to a life of dysfunction.

16:51.460 --> 16:55.700
The habits of responsibility, hard work and grit can be picked up from all sorts of places,

16:55.700 --> 16:59.780
not just your parents and learning how to be a man while it is passed down from father

16:59.780 --> 17:01.220
to son, at least to a point.

17:01.220 --> 17:05.620
Once the son begins interacting with other men outside of his family and especially after

17:05.620 --> 17:09.540
he leaves the nest, he will be figuring out most of masculinity through a pretty brutal

17:09.540 --> 17:11.540
series of trial and error experiments.

17:11.540 --> 17:14.820
And if you're a guy listening to this, that's how it will be for you as well.

17:14.820 --> 17:20.180
In fact, if you were to learn about masculinity only through reading masculine theory, you

17:20.180 --> 17:23.140
would likely come out as an exceptionally dysfunctional human being.

17:23.140 --> 17:27.860
I think that's why we see stuff like masculinity gurus want guys to stop being so nice to women.

17:27.860 --> 17:32.260
Yes, it's true you can't let girls walk all over you, but there is a space between being

17:32.260 --> 17:35.780
a sociopathic asshole and a beta male soy boy cuck.

17:35.780 --> 17:36.900
Like, listen to this shit.

17:36.900 --> 17:40.420
Only effeminate males enjoy being around babies and puppies.

17:40.420 --> 17:44.820
Child comes to me when it's useful and has some baseline human ability for character

17:44.820 --> 17:45.700
building and teaching.

17:45.700 --> 17:48.340
Dog stays away until it's ready to serve and obey.

17:48.340 --> 17:51.380
OMG, it's so cute is absurd to those without a vagina.

17:51.380 --> 17:55.620
This is not the mindset of a real man, it's the mindset of a fucking serial killer.

17:55.620 --> 17:59.620
A well-rounded masculinity includes a space for being a husband and father, and those

17:59.620 --> 18:02.900
roles necessarily require at least a few softer components.

18:02.900 --> 18:06.900
And get this, any dude who talks about a great sex life with his wife is a degenerate in

18:06.900 --> 18:07.460
a dog.

18:07.460 --> 18:11.700
You're supposed to non-romantically love, cherish, and deeply revere your wife and mother

18:11.700 --> 18:12.500
of your children.

18:12.500 --> 18:14.900
Carnal pleasure is with your mistress, not your wife.

18:14.900 --> 18:18.020
This brain-dead take also comes out of that same manosphere.

18:18.020 --> 18:19.540
And I realized something when I first read it.

18:19.540 --> 18:23.860
This is what I believed a functional adult relationship was when I was like 14 years

18:23.860 --> 18:24.180
old.

18:24.180 --> 18:28.580
That people who have been together for years develop a more mature, asexual form of love,

18:28.580 --> 18:32.260
and that sexual desire was something that was childish and meant to be grown out of.

18:32.260 --> 18:36.580
I don't think that way now, but isn't that what all of this masculinity guru shit sounds

18:36.580 --> 18:37.140
like?

18:37.140 --> 18:38.420
Everything I've talked about today.

18:38.420 --> 18:41.220
It sounds like a teenager's idea of what being a man is.

18:41.220 --> 18:44.260
The forcing your girl to fuck other men is alpha stuff.

18:44.260 --> 18:46.740
The growing up means giving up what you love stuff.

18:46.740 --> 18:50.980
The your wife and mother of your children should be pure of your carnal desires stuff.

18:50.980 --> 18:54.180
It all sounds like your balls just dropped five minutes ago.

18:54.180 --> 18:57.700
You've gotten that first hit of testosterone, and you think you know the score, but you

18:57.700 --> 18:58.180
don't.

18:58.180 --> 19:01.460
It's my belief that if you have to tell people you're a real man, then you're not.

19:01.460 --> 19:03.460
If you have to tell people that you're an alpha, you're not.

19:03.460 --> 19:06.900
You have to tell people that you're a high status male or high value or whatever else.

19:06.900 --> 19:07.940
You're just not.

19:07.940 --> 19:10.500
I've also heard that people should be able to tell just by looking at you.

19:10.500 --> 19:14.020
And sure, I can see how that's true in some situations, but the thread that binds everything

19:14.020 --> 19:15.780
in this video together is insecurity.

19:15.780 --> 19:19.380
All of these people are insecure about their pasts or how others perceive that past.

19:19.380 --> 19:23.460
They're insecure about their own masculinity, so they present the most shallow public face

19:23.460 --> 19:26.580
of that masculinity, rendering it teenage and impotent.

19:26.580 --> 19:31.780
One big quality of masculinity that everyone in this video has missed is security.

19:31.780 --> 19:35.540
Security is what your family, friends and community need from you, and it's what you

19:35.540 --> 19:39.780
can offer them, both security in yourself such that you can be trusted to be steady

19:39.780 --> 19:43.300
and security for others such that you can assist and defend when times get tough.

19:43.300 --> 19:47.540
Part of that security is rejecting all of this nonsense and performing the day to day

19:47.540 --> 19:49.380
habits of building your masculinity.

19:49.380 --> 19:52.020
I'm not going to sit here and tell you that I'm a real man or that I have all the answers.

19:52.020 --> 19:52.500
I don't.

19:52.500 --> 19:56.180
I'm certainly no alpha, but I'm secure in my relationship with Naomi and with my friends.

19:56.180 --> 19:57.860
I'm secure in what I'm doing with my life.

19:57.860 --> 20:01.540
And yes, I'm secure in the things that I enjoy in my downtime and the stuff that I'm

20:01.540 --> 20:04.900
not all that secure with, like my weight, for example, I'm working on.

20:04.900 --> 20:05.940
Maybe I'll succeed.

20:05.940 --> 20:08.580
Maybe I won't and I'll die of a fat induced heart attack.

20:08.580 --> 20:10.580
But I'm not giving up, and that's enough for me.

20:11.300 --> 20:13.300
All right, my friends, that is the end of the video.

20:13.300 --> 20:16.900
I know I waited probably a bit too long to talk about Jack Murphy, but I just don't

20:16.900 --> 20:18.980
like talking about breaking news in that way.

20:18.980 --> 20:20.100
I'm not an ambulance chaser.

20:20.100 --> 20:23.700
I wanted to wait until I understood what was underneath the surface of the story, and I

20:23.700 --> 20:24.180
think I did.

20:24.180 --> 20:25.940
As always, I'm streaming on the gaming channel tonight.

20:25.940 --> 20:26.740
Come drop in.

20:26.740 --> 20:27.620
I'll see you there.

20:27.620 --> 20:28.980
Have a good one, guys.

20:28.980 --> 20:29.620
I love you.
