0	10480	In the past few weeks, like a hundred people have asked me to talk about Jack Murphy.
10480	12760	So here we go!
12760	16660	Jack Murphy is one of those masculinity gurus that seem to be a dime a dozen on the internet
16660	17840	right nowadays.
17840	21920	You know the type, these gruff, older, muscled men who might make video content or maybe
21920	25760	write a blog or something, instructing young men about the traditional masculine gender
25760	26760	role.
26760	30500	One version of this is a website called The Liminal Order, where for the low low price
30500	34680	of $100 a month, Jesus, he will teach you how to be a real man.
34680	40140	At the end of December 2021, he appeared on Sidney Watson's stream, where a few superchats
40140	43080	asked him about the cuck article.
43080	65080	Even though Watson genuinely didn't understand what was going on, Murphy still reacted poorly
65080	69400	to the reference, even going so far as to march out of their studio saying fuck you.
69400	76820	When the show did end, Jack got up, I made an attempt to apologize or to at least ask
76820	80260	what had happened and what had made him react that way.
80260	85840	He told me to go fuck myself, or he either said go fuck yourself or he said fuck you
85840	89160	again, I can't remember which, and then he left.
89160	93760	At that point, Elijah went to go and talk to him to see if the situation might be resolved
93760	96520	and that is when they went to go and get drinks.
96520	100080	Apparently, Watson's editor smoothed things over with him later.
100080	105280	Nonetheless, Murphy felt the need to go on Tim Pool's show and throw shade at Watson
225280	236260	that
236260	253340	The
253340	257140	cuck article in question has been mysteriously scrubbed off the wayback machine.
257140	258500	I wonder how that happened.
258500	261540	But you know what, it's still easy enough to find if you know where to look.
261540	265500	It's titled Cultivating Erotic Energy from a Surprising Source.
265500	271580	October 9th, 2015 by Jack Murphy Today I sent my adoring, loyal, hot girlfriend
271580	274980	of two years to have sex with a stranger from Tinder.
274980	279100	She is currently at his apartment, checked in with me via text, and is presumably sucking
279100	281140	and fucking her way to a good time.
281140	282940	I'm alone writing.
282940	283940	Couldn't be happier.
283940	286580	Um, alright dude.
286580	290500	All jokes aside, if you continue to read this article you can kinda see where he's going
290500	291500	with this.
291500	294980	I've learned over time how my natural disposition is to be dominant.
294980	297180	For submissive women, I'm practically an ideal.
297180	304480	I've had sex slaves, little girls, and tied them all up.
304480	307620	Feminists seek me out to fuck them like the patriarchy.
307620	309020	Jesus Christ dude.
309020	310460	Like yeah, I get it.
310460	315040	The whole LG thing is a kink about women who want to basically act like bratty children
315040	318320	and then get put in their place by their dominant daddies.
318320	322440	But if you're not somebody who's terminally online, this just reads really fucking weird.
322440	324760	The edge gets far from center eventually.
324760	326960	Excitement and novelty can wear off.
326960	328360	Even novelty becomes boring.
328360	332200	There are only so many approaches to sex, so many different ways of doing it.
332200	334560	Only so many different kinds of people and lovers.
334560	339120	For me, and those of us who like to push the edge, eventually the only areas left to explore
339120	342360	become things you can only do as an evolved couple.
342360	346200	You know, to me this actually sounds like you're a coomer who's become so desensitized
346200	350220	to regular sex that you actually need some crazy shit to get off.
350220	353080	You know Jack, no fat would probably do you some good.
353080	356320	The entire experience is regimented according to my rules.
356320	357640	I introduced her to the idea.
357640	358640	I pushed it.
358640	360580	I told her to go on Tinder and find someone.
360580	364040	On the day in question, I tell her when and where to do it.
364040	365780	She checks in with me via text.
365780	367920	I know where she is and I'm waiting for her.
367920	368920	She's not alone.
368920	372960	She is on a mission sent directly by me, and the entire point is for me to get turned on
372960	375120	in a way that wouldn't happen otherwise.
375120	378720	This passage is the core of the matter, and this is probably the one point he actually
378720	379720	has.
379720	383000	True enough, by the modern meaning of the word cuck, he's not actually being cucked
383000	387560	because the idea behind cucking is that the bull acts in order to humiliate the man, while
387560	391480	Murphy's describing a scenario that he has set up for her to play a role in, regardless
391480	392480	of her own will.
392480	396820	In other words, a cuck is a guy who consents to having a more dominant man fuck his girl
396820	400200	because he gets off on the feeling of being emasculated and degraded.
400200	402400	However, Murphy's situation is the opposite.
402400	406720	He's having a less dominant man fuck his girl in order to make her feel degraded and
406720	408840	to further establish his own dominance.
408840	410500	It's kind of like pimping in a way.
410500	415220	Even if a pimp fucks his hoes, nobody would call him a cuck when his hoes fuck John's.
415220	419560	But the problem with Murphy's behavior was probably best described by Sargon on his channel
419560	421060	when he talked about this event.
421060	424520	It might make Murphy an alpha, but it doesn't make him a man.
424520	425520	And I agree.
425520	426860	You might be the dominant one.
426860	428400	You might be in control.
428400	433000	But what do you think it does to the quality, the fabric of your relationship if you act
433000	436840	like a pimp and the girl that you're supposed to cherish acts like a hoe?
436840	441560	What makes this whole thing an actual story in the sense of Internet drama is that after
441560	446600	the Sidney Watson super chat, Jack Murphy repeatedly self-destructed in an attempt to
446600	447920	prevent this from going viral.
447920	450440	In other words, he went full Streisand effect.
450440	454660	The extra attention drawn to the article and Murphy's horrible reaction to it got the attention
454660	456280	of the Internet super sleuths.
456280	459400	I'm not going into too much detail because this is going up on YouTube, but there's a
459400	463560	pile of old pictures and videos where both his girl was fucking other men while he watched
463560	466280	and where he put a bunch of stuff up his own butt.
466280	467280	Now that's what you're into.
467280	468280	Good on you.
468280	469280	Do whatever you want.
469280	470280	I don't care.
470280	473280	But every time a new video or a new bit of info from his past dropped, he'd go on another
473280	475240	Internet meltdown at the height of it.
475240	479120	He was blaming everybody reporting on the event for being part of a revenge porn scandal,
479120	482820	which is a charge that does come with legal ramifications in a lot of places while also
482820	487540	filing DMCA claims everywhere he could to get as many YouTube videos and tweets taken
487540	488940	down as possible.
488940	493020	Murphy turned the liminal order into his own personal war room in an attempt to mobilize
493020	495740	his community against everybody who dared to speak about this.
495740	498980	Sidney Watson, Tim Pool, The Quartering, and everybody else.
498980	503300	Meanwhile, the Internet decided to start up a competing website, The Riminal Order.
503300	504740	And yes, all these links work.
504740	506940	There is a YouTube and a merch store and everything else.
506940	508900	I fucking love the Internet, dude.
508980	512380	Eventually, Jack Murphy dropped a passage where he came clean, admitting that it was
512380	516220	all done when he was short on cash and he was desperate after having lost his job during
516220	517620	a prior canceling event.
517620	521040	The context of that is that he used to work for a school board in some capacity where
521040	525700	back in 2018, some of his online Manosphere content caught up with him and he was let
525700	528780	go, a topic that he talked about on an older episode of Tim Pool.
528780	533380	There has been this ongoing tactic used, I would say, by both sides.
533380	535700	And I don't want to accuse either side of you of using one or the other, but we've seen
535700	539780	it a bit, where they dig up old posts or they accuse them of being something they're not.
539780	543380	And I think a lot of this false accusation stuff of calling people a Nazi or a white supremacist
543380	545380	has come from the left.
545380	550980	Today, I'm going to sit here with Jack Murphy, who is targeted by a campaign specifically
550980	553380	doing this, calling you a white supremacist.
553380	555700	A Nazi and no one associated with which one?
555700	556740	Well, there you go.
556740	560980	Once Lacey McCall had made these accusations for me, then they went digging through old
560980	563300	posts that I had actually deleted.
563300	568100	So they went to the internet archives, as it were, and dug up old stuff that I had written.
568100	573620	When I very first started blogging, completely anonymous, no pictures, pen name, everything.
573620	577300	My first thing I started writing about was sex and relationships.
577300	586020	And one of the things I was writing about were BDSM relationships, consensual adult sexual relationships.
586020	589620	In order to make ends meet, he did all of that crazy stuff and he now regrets it.
589620	591220	And you know what?
591220	594100	If Jack Murphy had said this at the start of the controversy, he probably would have
594100	594980	just slipped by.
594980	596260	He would have had a round of teasing.
596260	599220	And if he took his lumps without complaint, it would have been over and done with.
599220	601460	A true man would know this intuitively.
601460	604820	Instead, he complained and fought the people who dared to speak the truth.
604820	606580	And so he furthered his own destruction.
606580	610820	The smart thing to do, in fact, would be to use his experience to bolster his claims.
610820	614660	If he truly wants to be a beacon of masculinity to his audience, he should have said that
614660	618340	he went down this destructive road, that he tried the cucking and the porn and that it
618340	618900	ruined him.
618900	621700	He doesn't want the next generation of men coming up to make the same mistake.
621700	625940	If his job is to teach these men about masculinity, then this event is how you teach them.
625940	627780	Instead, he taught them the opposite.
627780	629700	There's a fellow I followed on Twitter for a while now.
629700	630980	His name's iHypocrite.
630980	633940	I followed him back during gamergate, and I kept re-following him out of habit every
633940	635060	time I got a new Twitter account.
635060	638580	I know absolutely nothing about this guy, only that the content he posts is sometimes
638580	638820	funny.
638820	639380	That's it.
639380	643540	One day, another one of these Jack Murphy-like masculine accounts posted this.
643540	644740	You need to kill the boy.
644740	648580	No more video games, no more little Japanese cartoons, no more fantasy football, which
648580	652260	is Dungeons and Dragons for jocks, no more large groups of men goofing around in dorms
652260	656580	and studio apartments, no more Full Send and That's Liddy, no more beer pong, no more
656580	657060	Drake.
657060	661780	The idea being, these interests are impediments to growing up, which is a common enough theme
661780	663780	among conservative masculine-centric spheres.
663780	664980	And you know what, fair enough.
664980	669060	After the post went viral, iHypocrite replied with, I love tweets like this because people
669060	672420	wouldn't get so extremely pressed if you weren't touching on something.
672420	674100	Also, fair enough, good point.
674100	677860	Lots of people got angry at the original tweet because they like their video games, maybe
677860	680580	a little bit too much, and they probably felt personally attacked.
680580	683620	I didn't feel personally attacked, but I do love my video games.
683620	684900	But here's where the fun begins.
684900	689220	iHypocrite received this reply, I don't think the people enjoying their hobbies are pressed.
689220	693300	This guy seems to be enjoying himself, and he attached a picture of iHypocrite from 2015,
693300	698500	where he says, this is me, I live in BC, I play PS3, dumb diddle dee, looking like the
698500	700260	quintessential beta soy boy.
700260	704340	Now I thought this was funny, the juxtaposition between this masculine orientation and his
704340	705140	past self.
705140	706500	So I retweeted it.
706500	707380	A grave sin.
707380	709940	I didn't say anything, I didn't comment, I just retweeted.
709940	711700	And iHypocrite blocked me for that.
711700	714820	And then he decided to devote a segment on his stream about me.
714820	715220	Geez.
737460	742020	And I always thought this guy was kind of a weasel, so when I saw that, I blocked him.
742900	745620	You know, I had no idea this guy knew who I was.
745620	748660	I'm not exactly SFO on Twitter, for obvious reasons.
748660	751300	And he plays off this entire rant like he doesn't know who I am.
751300	754420	Not to say that you should know who I am, but I have a feeling that he does.
754420	755780	Short fat otaku.
755780	758660	I'm gonna talk about this guy for a sec, and then wrap it up.
759380	761860	So this is him, I guess.
761860	768740	He's the the fat guy here, wearing the Five Nights at Freddy's t-shirt.
768740	770500	This screenshot is from my gaming channel.
770500	772660	It's at least two years old, judging by the old couch.
772660	775940	Probably older, judging by the relative lack of gray hair and Dave's beard.
775940	779140	And it's from Naomi's birthday stream, because she's wearing the birthday hat.
779140	782980	This is not a common image of me floating around, at least it wasn't before this event.
782980	785700	The most common image of me that can be found online is this one.
785700	789140	This is the one that is overwhelmingly used in hit pieces written about me, and videos
789140	791300	made about me, if they're not using my channel avatar.
791300	794740	In other words, before this all went down, if you didn't know anything about me, and
794740	797860	you wanted to talk about me and use a picture, this is the picture that you would stumble
797860	799140	upon on Google Images.
799140	803780	If you watch my tiny ass gaming side channel, that has none of the clout or reach that SFO
803780	806660	does, then maybe you'll find couch pics like this.
806660	811940	Yeah, I wonder why this guy would be a little bit sensitive about somebody pointing out
813700	816260	people in their perpetual adolescence.
816260	818100	Who's calling who sensitive?
818100	820740	Here, let's see how many people have got blocked on Twitter.
820740	822100	Oh, the list is empty.
822100	823620	I wonder why that could be.
823620	828260	I wonder why he would get so triggered over me laughing at somebody else's tweet that
828260	835300	he felt the need to launch into personal attacks on my appearance on an eight-year-old photo
835300	835940	of me.
835940	836980	What personal attack?
836980	838180	Where's the personal attack?
838180	839700	I retweeted it because it was funny.
839700	842500	It does sound like you're taking this a lot more seriously than I am.
842500	849220	Imagine the cognitive dissonance you have to have to think that you're going to make
849220	856900	fun of somebody because 10 years ago they were in almost as bad a shape as you're in
856900	857220	now.
859220	859940	You know what I'm saying?
863380	868740	How are you going to make fun of somebody's looks when that's what you look like?
868740	870500	And this is really the core of it, isn't it?
870500	873220	You said earlier that I was mad, but you know I'm not mad.
873220	874420	You know I'm making fun of you.
874420	875620	You just admitted it.
875620	876980	That's the real point here.
876980	880740	There was stuff that I cut out like comparing our reach on Twitter or comments about lolicon
880740	883060	because they just have no relevance to this conversation.
883060	888020	They're just side jabs to I guess show that he's totally not angry, but this is the real
888020	888500	point.
888500	892660	This conversation isn't really about the fact that you were once a soy boy and now you're
892660	894420	not or at least you claim you're not.
894420	895940	That it's the same either way.
895940	899460	What truly matters here is your inability to make fun of yourself.
899460	902660	Do you think I don't know what I look like or what my deficiencies are?
902660	906740	Do you think this picture isn't somehow me playing off of that for the benefit of my
906740	907460	audience?
907460	908500	Listen, I hypocrite.
909220	910500	We're on YouTube.
910500	911860	That means we're entertainers.
911860	915380	Sometimes that means we have serious discussions about real topics and hopefully provoke some
915380	916500	thoughts in our viewers.
916500	919300	Sometimes that means we act like clowns and make people laugh.
919300	924020	But what it always means is that we perform at the pleasure of an audience with the expectation
924020	925380	that we give them something.
925380	927300	Something funny, something interesting, something.
927300	928980	And in exchange for that, we get paid.
929540	930500	That's the job.
930500	931940	Sure, it bothers me that I'm fat.
931940	932820	I'm working on it.
932820	936660	But if somebody can get joy at laughing at the fat guy, that means that I've earned my
936660	937700	keep for another day.
937700	941780	And if that also means that I do a goofy voice or I strike a pose or I write a script or
941780	945940	I record a video or I analyze an idea, that is my job.
945940	950180	Why are you so angry that people make fun of the you that existed seven years ago?
950180	953780	And why are you so adamant about framing it as anything other than being mad?
953780	955620	Are you that insecure?
955620	956420	I mean, don't answer.
956420	957620	The answer is obviously yes.
957620	961300	And it's that insecurity that made me want to talk about the side story in a video about
961300	962020	Jack Murphy.
962020	966020	All of these people who talk the big masculine talk on the Internet, it does seem like when
966020	969620	you dig beneath the surface, almost all of them are actually insecure.
969620	972020	And yes, I can hear the right out objection right now.
972020	975140	It's what academic agent called the liberal need to pathologize and project.
975140	976420	But no, it's actually true.
976420	980340	It's even true for him, considering what he used to get up to in his now current hyper
980340	981620	traditionalist stance.
981620	985220	Masculinity, insofar as it's socially constructed, is a habit.
985220	989300	Sure, there is a biological component to it, but regarding that non biological component
989300	992660	of it, reading about it on the liminal order or listening to motivational videos can only
992660	993460	get you so far.
993460	995780	You have to do masculinity.
995780	999380	That is the fundamental flaw with the Jack Murphy's and the Mike Cernovich's of the
999380	999860	world.
999860	1003460	Even when they might have something of value to offer in their writing, you learn it far
1003460	1007700	better by having habits instilled in you from your own father, assuming he's around and
1007700	1008500	he's a good parent.
1008500	1011460	And if he's not, though, that doesn't mean you're just doomed to a life of dysfunction.
1011460	1015700	The habits of responsibility, hard work and grit can be picked up from all sorts of places,
1015700	1019780	not just your parents and learning how to be a man while it is passed down from father
1019780	1021220	to son, at least to a point.
1021220	1025620	Once the son begins interacting with other men outside of his family and especially after
1025620	1029540	he leaves the nest, he will be figuring out most of masculinity through a pretty brutal
1029540	1031540	series of trial and error experiments.
1031540	1034820	And if you're a guy listening to this, that's how it will be for you as well.
1034820	1040180	In fact, if you were to learn about masculinity only through reading masculine theory, you
1040180	1043140	would likely come out as an exceptionally dysfunctional human being.
1043140	1047860	I think that's why we see stuff like masculinity gurus want guys to stop being so nice to women.
1047860	1052260	Yes, it's true you can't let girls walk all over you, but there is a space between being
1052260	1055780	a sociopathic asshole and a beta male soy boy cuck.
1055780	1056900	Like, listen to this shit.
1056900	1060420	Only effeminate males enjoy being around babies and puppies.
1060420	1064820	Child comes to me when it's useful and has some baseline human ability for character
1064820	1065700	building and teaching.
1065700	1068340	Dog stays away until it's ready to serve and obey.
1068340	1071380	OMG, it's so cute is absurd to those without a vagina.
1071380	1075620	This is not the mindset of a real man, it's the mindset of a fucking serial killer.
1075620	1079620	A well-rounded masculinity includes a space for being a husband and father, and those
1079620	1082900	roles necessarily require at least a few softer components.
1082900	1086900	And get this, any dude who talks about a great sex life with his wife is a degenerate in
1086900	1087460	a dog.
1087460	1091700	You're supposed to non-romantically love, cherish, and deeply revere your wife and mother
1091700	1092500	of your children.
1092500	1094900	Carnal pleasure is with your mistress, not your wife.
1094900	1098020	This brain-dead take also comes out of that same manosphere.
1098020	1099540	And I realized something when I first read it.
1099540	1103860	This is what I believed a functional adult relationship was when I was like 14 years
1103860	1104180	old.
1104180	1108580	That people who have been together for years develop a more mature, asexual form of love,
1108580	1112260	and that sexual desire was something that was childish and meant to be grown out of.
1112260	1116580	I don't think that way now, but isn't that what all of this masculinity guru shit sounds
1116580	1117140	like?
1117140	1118420	Everything I've talked about today.
1118420	1121220	It sounds like a teenager's idea of what being a man is.
1121220	1124260	The forcing your girl to fuck other men is alpha stuff.
1124260	1126740	The growing up means giving up what you love stuff.
1126740	1130980	The your wife and mother of your children should be pure of your carnal desires stuff.
1130980	1134180	It all sounds like your balls just dropped five minutes ago.
1134180	1137700	You've gotten that first hit of testosterone, and you think you know the score, but you
1137700	1138180	don't.
1138180	1141460	It's my belief that if you have to tell people you're a real man, then you're not.
1141460	1143460	If you have to tell people that you're an alpha, you're not.
1143460	1146900	You have to tell people that you're a high status male or high value or whatever else.
1146900	1147940	You're just not.
1147940	1150500	I've also heard that people should be able to tell just by looking at you.
1150500	1154020	And sure, I can see how that's true in some situations, but the thread that binds everything
1154020	1155780	in this video together is insecurity.
1155780	1159380	All of these people are insecure about their pasts or how others perceive that past.
1159380	1163460	They're insecure about their own masculinity, so they present the most shallow public face
1163460	1166580	of that masculinity, rendering it teenage and impotent.
1166580	1171780	One big quality of masculinity that everyone in this video has missed is security.
1171780	1175540	Security is what your family, friends and community need from you, and it's what you
1175540	1179780	can offer them, both security in yourself such that you can be trusted to be steady
1179780	1183300	and security for others such that you can assist and defend when times get tough.
1183300	1187540	Part of that security is rejecting all of this nonsense and performing the day to day
1187540	1189380	habits of building your masculinity.
1189380	1192020	I'm not going to sit here and tell you that I'm a real man or that I have all the answers.
1192020	1192500	I don't.
1192500	1196180	I'm certainly no alpha, but I'm secure in my relationship with Naomi and with my friends.
1196180	1197860	I'm secure in what I'm doing with my life.
1197860	1201540	And yes, I'm secure in the things that I enjoy in my downtime and the stuff that I'm
1201540	1204900	not all that secure with, like my weight, for example, I'm working on.
1204900	1205940	Maybe I'll succeed.
1205940	1208580	Maybe I won't and I'll die of a fat induced heart attack.
1208580	1210580	But I'm not giving up, and that's enough for me.
1211300	1213300	All right, my friends, that is the end of the video.
1213300	1216900	I know I waited probably a bit too long to talk about Jack Murphy, but I just don't
1216900	1218980	like talking about breaking news in that way.
1218980	1220100	I'm not an ambulance chaser.
1220100	1223700	I wanted to wait until I understood what was underneath the surface of the story, and I
1223700	1224180	think I did.
1224180	1225940	As always, I'm streaming on the gaming channel tonight.
1225940	1226740	Come drop in.
1226740	1227620	I'll see you there.
1227620	1228980	Have a good one, guys.
1228980	1229620	I love you.
