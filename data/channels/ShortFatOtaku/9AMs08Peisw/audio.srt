00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,480
In the past few weeks, like a hundred people have asked me to talk about Jack Murphy.

2
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:12,760
So here we go!

3
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:16,660
Jack Murphy is one of those masculinity gurus that seem to be a dime a dozen on the internet

4
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:17,840
right nowadays.

5
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:21,920
You know the type, these gruff, older, muscled men who might make video content or maybe

6
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:25,760
write a blog or something, instructing young men about the traditional masculine gender

7
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:26,760
role.

8
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:30,500
One version of this is a website called The Liminal Order, where for the low low price

9
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:34,680
of $100 a month, Jesus, he will teach you how to be a real man.

10
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:40,140
At the end of December 2021, he appeared on Sidney Watson's stream, where a few superchats

11
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:43,080
asked him about the cuck article.

12
00:00:43,080 --> 00:01:05,080
Even though Watson genuinely didn't understand what was going on, Murphy still reacted poorly

13
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:09,400
to the reference, even going so far as to march out of their studio saying fuck you.

14
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:16,820
When the show did end, Jack got up, I made an attempt to apologize or to at least ask

15
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:20,260
what had happened and what had made him react that way.

16
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:25,840
He told me to go fuck myself, or he either said go fuck yourself or he said fuck you

17
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:29,160
again, I can't remember which, and then he left.

18
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:33,760
At that point, Elijah went to go and talk to him to see if the situation might be resolved

19
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:36,520
and that is when they went to go and get drinks.

20
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:40,080
Apparently, Watson's editor smoothed things over with him later.

21
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:45,280
Nonetheless, Murphy felt the need to go on Tim Pool's show and throw shade at Watson

22
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:56,260
that

23
00:03:56,260 --> 00:04:13,340
The

24
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:17,140
cuck article in question has been mysteriously scrubbed off the wayback machine.

25
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:18,500
I wonder how that happened.

26
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:21,540
But you know what, it's still easy enough to find if you know where to look.

27
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:25,500
It's titled Cultivating Erotic Energy from a Surprising Source.

28
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:31,580
October 9th, 2015 by Jack Murphy Today I sent my adoring, loyal, hot girlfriend

29
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:34,980
of two years to have sex with a stranger from Tinder.

30
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:39,100
She is currently at his apartment, checked in with me via text, and is presumably sucking

31
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:41,140
and fucking her way to a good time.

32
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:42,940
I'm alone writing.

33
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:43,940
Couldn't be happier.

34
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:46,580
Um, alright dude.

35
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:50,500
All jokes aside, if you continue to read this article you can kinda see where he's going

36
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:51,500
with this.

37
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:54,980
I've learned over time how my natural disposition is to be dominant.

38
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:57,180
For submissive women, I'm practically an ideal.

39
00:04:57,180 --> 00:05:04,480
I've had sex slaves, little girls, and tied them all up.

40
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:07,620
Feminists seek me out to fuck them like the patriarchy.

41
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:09,020
Jesus Christ dude.

42
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:10,460
Like yeah, I get it.

43
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:15,040
The whole LG thing is a kink about women who want to basically act like bratty children

44
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:18,320
and then get put in their place by their dominant daddies.

45
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:22,440
But if you're not somebody who's terminally online, this just reads really fucking weird.

46
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:24,760
The edge gets far from center eventually.

47
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:26,960
Excitement and novelty can wear off.

48
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,360
Even novelty becomes boring.

49
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:32,200
There are only so many approaches to sex, so many different ways of doing it.

50
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:34,560
Only so many different kinds of people and lovers.

51
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:39,120
For me, and those of us who like to push the edge, eventually the only areas left to explore

52
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:42,360
become things you can only do as an evolved couple.

53
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:46,200
You know, to me this actually sounds like you're a coomer who's become so desensitized

54
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:50,220
to regular sex that you actually need some crazy shit to get off.

55
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:53,080
You know Jack, no fat would probably do you some good.

56
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:56,320
The entire experience is regimented according to my rules.

57
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:57,640
I introduced her to the idea.

58
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:58,640
I pushed it.

59
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:00,580
I told her to go on Tinder and find someone.

60
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:04,040
On the day in question, I tell her when and where to do it.

61
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,780
She checks in with me via text.

62
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:07,920
I know where she is and I'm waiting for her.

63
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:08,920
She's not alone.

64
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:12,960
She is on a mission sent directly by me, and the entire point is for me to get turned on

65
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:15,120
in a way that wouldn't happen otherwise.

66
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:18,720
This passage is the core of the matter, and this is probably the one point he actually

67
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:19,720
has.

68
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:23,000
True enough, by the modern meaning of the word cuck, he's not actually being cucked

69
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,560
because the idea behind cucking is that the bull acts in order to humiliate the man, while

70
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:31,480
Murphy's describing a scenario that he has set up for her to play a role in, regardless

71
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:32,480
of her own will.

72
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:36,820
In other words, a cuck is a guy who consents to having a more dominant man fuck his girl

73
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:40,200
because he gets off on the feeling of being emasculated and degraded.

74
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:42,400
However, Murphy's situation is the opposite.

75
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:46,720
He's having a less dominant man fuck his girl in order to make her feel degraded and

76
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,840
to further establish his own dominance.

77
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:50,500
It's kind of like pimping in a way.

78
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:55,220
Even if a pimp fucks his hoes, nobody would call him a cuck when his hoes fuck John's.

79
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:59,560
But the problem with Murphy's behavior was probably best described by Sargon on his channel

80
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:01,060
when he talked about this event.

81
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:04,520
It might make Murphy an alpha, but it doesn't make him a man.

82
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:05,520
And I agree.

83
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:06,860
You might be the dominant one.

84
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:08,400
You might be in control.

85
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:13,000
But what do you think it does to the quality, the fabric of your relationship if you act

86
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,840
like a pimp and the girl that you're supposed to cherish acts like a hoe?

87
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:21,560
What makes this whole thing an actual story in the sense of Internet drama is that after

88
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:26,600
the Sidney Watson super chat, Jack Murphy repeatedly self-destructed in an attempt to

89
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:27,920
prevent this from going viral.

90
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:30,440
In other words, he went full Streisand effect.

91
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:34,660
The extra attention drawn to the article and Murphy's horrible reaction to it got the attention

92
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:36,280
of the Internet super sleuths.

93
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:39,400
I'm not going into too much detail because this is going up on YouTube, but there's a

94
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:43,560
pile of old pictures and videos where both his girl was fucking other men while he watched

95
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:46,280
and where he put a bunch of stuff up his own butt.

96
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:47,280
Now that's what you're into.

97
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,280
Good on you.

98
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:49,280
Do whatever you want.

99
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50,280
I don't care.

100
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:53,280
But every time a new video or a new bit of info from his past dropped, he'd go on another

101
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,240
Internet meltdown at the height of it.

102
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:59,120
He was blaming everybody reporting on the event for being part of a revenge porn scandal,

103
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:02,820
which is a charge that does come with legal ramifications in a lot of places while also

104
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:07,540
filing DMCA claims everywhere he could to get as many YouTube videos and tweets taken

105
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:08,940
down as possible.

106
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:13,020
Murphy turned the liminal order into his own personal war room in an attempt to mobilize

107
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:15,740
his community against everybody who dared to speak about this.

108
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:18,980
Sidney Watson, Tim Pool, The Quartering, and everybody else.

109
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:23,300
Meanwhile, the Internet decided to start up a competing website, The Riminal Order.

110
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:24,740
And yes, all these links work.

111
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:26,940
There is a YouTube and a merch store and everything else.

112
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:28,900
I fucking love the Internet, dude.

113
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:32,380
Eventually, Jack Murphy dropped a passage where he came clean, admitting that it was

114
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:36,220
all done when he was short on cash and he was desperate after having lost his job during

115
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:37,620
a prior canceling event.

116
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:41,040
The context of that is that he used to work for a school board in some capacity where

117
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:45,700
back in 2018, some of his online Manosphere content caught up with him and he was let

118
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:48,780
go, a topic that he talked about on an older episode of Tim Pool.

119
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:53,380
There has been this ongoing tactic used, I would say, by both sides.

120
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:55,700
And I don't want to accuse either side of you of using one or the other, but we've seen

121
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:59,780
it a bit, where they dig up old posts or they accuse them of being something they're not.

122
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:03,380
And I think a lot of this false accusation stuff of calling people a Nazi or a white supremacist

123
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:05,380
has come from the left.

124
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:10,980
Today, I'm going to sit here with Jack Murphy, who is targeted by a campaign specifically

125
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:13,380
doing this, calling you a white supremacist.

126
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:15,700
A Nazi and no one associated with which one?

127
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:16,740
Well, there you go.

128
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:20,980
Once Lacey McCall had made these accusations for me, then they went digging through old

129
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:23,300
posts that I had actually deleted.

130
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:28,100
So they went to the internet archives, as it were, and dug up old stuff that I had written.

131
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:33,620
When I very first started blogging, completely anonymous, no pictures, pen name, everything.

132
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:37,300
My first thing I started writing about was sex and relationships.

133
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:46,020
And one of the things I was writing about were BDSM relationships, consensual adult sexual relationships.

134
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:49,620
In order to make ends meet, he did all of that crazy stuff and he now regrets it.

135
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:51,220
And you know what?

136
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:54,100
If Jack Murphy had said this at the start of the controversy, he probably would have

137
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:54,980
just slipped by.

138
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:56,260
He would have had a round of teasing.

139
00:09:56,260 --> 00:09:59,220
And if he took his lumps without complaint, it would have been over and done with.

140
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:01,460
A true man would know this intuitively.

141
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:04,820
Instead, he complained and fought the people who dared to speak the truth.

142
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:06,580
And so he furthered his own destruction.

143
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:10,820
The smart thing to do, in fact, would be to use his experience to bolster his claims.

144
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:14,660
If he truly wants to be a beacon of masculinity to his audience, he should have said that

145
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:18,340
he went down this destructive road, that he tried the cucking and the porn and that it

146
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:18,900
ruined him.

147
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:21,700
He doesn't want the next generation of men coming up to make the same mistake.

148
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:25,940
If his job is to teach these men about masculinity, then this event is how you teach them.

149
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:27,780
Instead, he taught them the opposite.

150
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:29,700
There's a fellow I followed on Twitter for a while now.

151
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:30,980
His name's iHypocrite.

152
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:33,940
I followed him back during gamergate, and I kept re-following him out of habit every

153
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:35,060
time I got a new Twitter account.

154
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:38,580
I know absolutely nothing about this guy, only that the content he posts is sometimes

155
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:38,820
funny.

156
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:39,380
That's it.

157
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:43,540
One day, another one of these Jack Murphy-like masculine accounts posted this.

158
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:44,740
You need to kill the boy.

159
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:48,580
No more video games, no more little Japanese cartoons, no more fantasy football, which

160
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:52,260
is Dungeons and Dragons for jocks, no more large groups of men goofing around in dorms

161
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:56,580
and studio apartments, no more Full Send and That's Liddy, no more beer pong, no more

162
00:10:56,580 --> 00:10:57,060
Drake.

163
00:10:57,060 --> 00:11:01,780
The idea being, these interests are impediments to growing up, which is a common enough theme

164
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:03,780
among conservative masculine-centric spheres.

165
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:04,980
And you know what, fair enough.

166
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:09,060
After the post went viral, iHypocrite replied with, I love tweets like this because people

167
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:12,420
wouldn't get so extremely pressed if you weren't touching on something.

168
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:14,100
Also, fair enough, good point.

169
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:17,860
Lots of people got angry at the original tweet because they like their video games, maybe

170
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:20,580
a little bit too much, and they probably felt personally attacked.

171
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:23,620
I didn't feel personally attacked, but I do love my video games.

172
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:24,900
But here's where the fun begins.

173
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:29,220
iHypocrite received this reply, I don't think the people enjoying their hobbies are pressed.

174
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:33,300
This guy seems to be enjoying himself, and he attached a picture of iHypocrite from 2015,

175
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:38,500
where he says, this is me, I live in BC, I play PS3, dumb diddle dee, looking like the

176
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:40,260
quintessential beta soy boy.

177
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:44,340
Now I thought this was funny, the juxtaposition between this masculine orientation and his

178
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:45,140
past self.

179
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:46,500
So I retweeted it.

180
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:47,380
A grave sin.

181
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:49,940
I didn't say anything, I didn't comment, I just retweeted.

182
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:51,700
And iHypocrite blocked me for that.

183
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:54,820
And then he decided to devote a segment on his stream about me.

184
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:55,220
Geez.

185
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:22,020
And I always thought this guy was kind of a weasel, so when I saw that, I blocked him.

186
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:25,620
You know, I had no idea this guy knew who I was.

187
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:28,660
I'm not exactly SFO on Twitter, for obvious reasons.

188
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:31,300
And he plays off this entire rant like he doesn't know who I am.

189
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:34,420
Not to say that you should know who I am, but I have a feeling that he does.

190
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:35,780
Short fat otaku.

191
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:38,660
I'm gonna talk about this guy for a sec, and then wrap it up.

192
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:41,860
So this is him, I guess.

193
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:48,740
He's the the fat guy here, wearing the Five Nights at Freddy's t-shirt.

194
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:50,500
This screenshot is from my gaming channel.

195
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:52,660
It's at least two years old, judging by the old couch.

196
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:55,940
Probably older, judging by the relative lack of gray hair and Dave's beard.

197
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:59,140
And it's from Naomi's birthday stream, because she's wearing the birthday hat.

198
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:02,980
This is not a common image of me floating around, at least it wasn't before this event.

199
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:05,700
The most common image of me that can be found online is this one.

200
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:09,140
This is the one that is overwhelmingly used in hit pieces written about me, and videos

201
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:11,300
made about me, if they're not using my channel avatar.

202
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:14,740
In other words, before this all went down, if you didn't know anything about me, and

203
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:17,860
you wanted to talk about me and use a picture, this is the picture that you would stumble

204
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:19,140
upon on Google Images.

205
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:23,780
If you watch my tiny ass gaming side channel, that has none of the clout or reach that SFO

206
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:26,660
does, then maybe you'll find couch pics like this.

207
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:31,940
Yeah, I wonder why this guy would be a little bit sensitive about somebody pointing out

208
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:36,260
people in their perpetual adolescence.

209
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:38,100
Who's calling who sensitive?

210
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:40,740
Here, let's see how many people have got blocked on Twitter.

211
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:42,100
Oh, the list is empty.

212
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:43,620
I wonder why that could be.

213
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:48,260
I wonder why he would get so triggered over me laughing at somebody else's tweet that

214
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:55,300
he felt the need to launch into personal attacks on my appearance on an eight-year-old photo

215
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:55,940
of me.

216
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:56,980
What personal attack?

217
00:13:56,980 --> 00:13:58,180
Where's the personal attack?

218
00:13:58,180 --> 00:13:59,700
I retweeted it because it was funny.

219
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:02,500
It does sound like you're taking this a lot more seriously than I am.

220
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:09,220
Imagine the cognitive dissonance you have to have to think that you're going to make

221
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:16,900
fun of somebody because 10 years ago they were in almost as bad a shape as you're in

222
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:17,220
now.

223
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:19,940
You know what I'm saying?

224
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:28,740
How are you going to make fun of somebody's looks when that's what you look like?

225
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:30,500
And this is really the core of it, isn't it?

226
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:33,220
You said earlier that I was mad, but you know I'm not mad.

227
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:34,420
You know I'm making fun of you.

228
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:35,620
You just admitted it.

229
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:36,980
That's the real point here.

230
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:40,740
There was stuff that I cut out like comparing our reach on Twitter or comments about lolicon

231
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:43,060
because they just have no relevance to this conversation.

232
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:48,020
They're just side jabs to I guess show that he's totally not angry, but this is the real

233
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:48,500
point.

234
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:52,660
This conversation isn't really about the fact that you were once a soy boy and now you're

235
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:54,420
not or at least you claim you're not.

236
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:55,940
That it's the same either way.

237
00:14:55,940 --> 00:14:59,460
What truly matters here is your inability to make fun of yourself.

238
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:02,660
Do you think I don't know what I look like or what my deficiencies are?

239
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:06,740
Do you think this picture isn't somehow me playing off of that for the benefit of my

240
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:07,460
audience?

241
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:08,500
Listen, I hypocrite.

242
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:10,500
We're on YouTube.

243
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:11,860
That means we're entertainers.

244
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:15,380
Sometimes that means we have serious discussions about real topics and hopefully provoke some

245
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:16,500
thoughts in our viewers.

246
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:19,300
Sometimes that means we act like clowns and make people laugh.

247
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:24,020
But what it always means is that we perform at the pleasure of an audience with the expectation

248
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:25,380
that we give them something.

249
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:27,300
Something funny, something interesting, something.

250
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:28,980
And in exchange for that, we get paid.

251
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:30,500
That's the job.

252
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:31,940
Sure, it bothers me that I'm fat.

253
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:32,820
I'm working on it.

254
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:36,660
But if somebody can get joy at laughing at the fat guy, that means that I've earned my

255
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:37,700
keep for another day.

256
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:41,780
And if that also means that I do a goofy voice or I strike a pose or I write a script or

257
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:45,940
I record a video or I analyze an idea, that is my job.

258
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:50,180
Why are you so angry that people make fun of the you that existed seven years ago?

259
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:53,780
And why are you so adamant about framing it as anything other than being mad?

260
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:55,620
Are you that insecure?

261
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:56,420
I mean, don't answer.

262
00:15:56,420 --> 00:15:57,620
The answer is obviously yes.

263
00:15:57,620 --> 00:16:01,300
And it's that insecurity that made me want to talk about the side story in a video about

264
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:02,020
Jack Murphy.

265
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:06,020
All of these people who talk the big masculine talk on the Internet, it does seem like when

266
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:09,620
you dig beneath the surface, almost all of them are actually insecure.

267
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:12,020
And yes, I can hear the right out objection right now.

268
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:15,140
It's what academic agent called the liberal need to pathologize and project.

269
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:16,420
But no, it's actually true.

270
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:20,340
It's even true for him, considering what he used to get up to in his now current hyper

271
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:21,620
traditionalist stance.

272
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:25,220
Masculinity, insofar as it's socially constructed, is a habit.

273
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:29,300
Sure, there is a biological component to it, but regarding that non biological component

274
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:32,660
of it, reading about it on the liminal order or listening to motivational videos can only

275
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:33,460
get you so far.

276
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:35,780
You have to do masculinity.

277
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:39,380
That is the fundamental flaw with the Jack Murphy's and the Mike Cernovich's of the

278
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:39,860
world.

279
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:43,460
Even when they might have something of value to offer in their writing, you learn it far

280
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:47,700
better by having habits instilled in you from your own father, assuming he's around and

281
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:48,500
he's a good parent.

282
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:51,460
And if he's not, though, that doesn't mean you're just doomed to a life of dysfunction.

283
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:55,700
The habits of responsibility, hard work and grit can be picked up from all sorts of places,

284
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:59,780
not just your parents and learning how to be a man while it is passed down from father

285
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:01,220
to son, at least to a point.

286
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:05,620
Once the son begins interacting with other men outside of his family and especially after

287
00:17:05,620 --> 00:17:09,540
he leaves the nest, he will be figuring out most of masculinity through a pretty brutal

288
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:11,540
series of trial and error experiments.

289
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:14,820
And if you're a guy listening to this, that's how it will be for you as well.

290
00:17:14,820 --> 00:17:20,180
In fact, if you were to learn about masculinity only through reading masculine theory, you

291
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:23,140
would likely come out as an exceptionally dysfunctional human being.

292
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:27,860
I think that's why we see stuff like masculinity gurus want guys to stop being so nice to women.

293
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:32,260
Yes, it's true you can't let girls walk all over you, but there is a space between being

294
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:35,780
a sociopathic asshole and a beta male soy boy cuck.

295
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:36,900
Like, listen to this shit.

296
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:40,420
Only effeminate males enjoy being around babies and puppies.

297
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:44,820
Child comes to me when it's useful and has some baseline human ability for character

298
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:45,700
building and teaching.

299
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:48,340
Dog stays away until it's ready to serve and obey.

300
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:51,380
OMG, it's so cute is absurd to those without a vagina.

301
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:55,620
This is not the mindset of a real man, it's the mindset of a fucking serial killer.

302
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:59,620
A well-rounded masculinity includes a space for being a husband and father, and those

303
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:02,900
roles necessarily require at least a few softer components.

304
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:06,900
And get this, any dude who talks about a great sex life with his wife is a degenerate in

305
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:07,460
a dog.

306
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:11,700
You're supposed to non-romantically love, cherish, and deeply revere your wife and mother

307
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:12,500
of your children.

308
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:14,900
Carnal pleasure is with your mistress, not your wife.

309
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:18,020
This brain-dead take also comes out of that same manosphere.

310
00:18:18,020 --> 00:18:19,540
And I realized something when I first read it.

311
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:23,860
This is what I believed a functional adult relationship was when I was like 14 years

312
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:24,180
old.

313
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:28,580
That people who have been together for years develop a more mature, asexual form of love,

314
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:32,260
and that sexual desire was something that was childish and meant to be grown out of.

315
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:36,580
I don't think that way now, but isn't that what all of this masculinity guru shit sounds

316
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:37,140
like?

317
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:38,420
Everything I've talked about today.

318
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:41,220
It sounds like a teenager's idea of what being a man is.

319
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:44,260
The forcing your girl to fuck other men is alpha stuff.

320
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:46,740
The growing up means giving up what you love stuff.

321
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:50,980
The your wife and mother of your children should be pure of your carnal desires stuff.

322
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:54,180
It all sounds like your balls just dropped five minutes ago.

323
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:57,700
You've gotten that first hit of testosterone, and you think you know the score, but you

324
00:18:57,700 --> 00:18:58,180
don't.

325
00:18:58,180 --> 00:19:01,460
It's my belief that if you have to tell people you're a real man, then you're not.

326
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:03,460
If you have to tell people that you're an alpha, you're not.

327
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:06,900
You have to tell people that you're a high status male or high value or whatever else.

328
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:07,940
You're just not.

329
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:10,500
I've also heard that people should be able to tell just by looking at you.

330
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:14,020
And sure, I can see how that's true in some situations, but the thread that binds everything

331
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:15,780
in this video together is insecurity.

332
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:19,380
All of these people are insecure about their pasts or how others perceive that past.

333
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:23,460
They're insecure about their own masculinity, so they present the most shallow public face

334
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:26,580
of that masculinity, rendering it teenage and impotent.

335
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:31,780
One big quality of masculinity that everyone in this video has missed is security.

336
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:35,540
Security is what your family, friends and community need from you, and it's what you

337
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:39,780
can offer them, both security in yourself such that you can be trusted to be steady

338
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:43,300
and security for others such that you can assist and defend when times get tough.

339
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:47,540
Part of that security is rejecting all of this nonsense and performing the day to day

340
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:49,380
habits of building your masculinity.

341
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:52,020
I'm not going to sit here and tell you that I'm a real man or that I have all the answers.

342
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:52,500
I don't.

343
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:56,180
I'm certainly no alpha, but I'm secure in my relationship with Naomi and with my friends.

344
00:19:56,180 --> 00:19:57,860
I'm secure in what I'm doing with my life.

345
00:19:57,860 --> 00:20:01,540
And yes, I'm secure in the things that I enjoy in my downtime and the stuff that I'm

346
00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:04,900
not all that secure with, like my weight, for example, I'm working on.

347
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:05,940
Maybe I'll succeed.

348
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:08,580
Maybe I won't and I'll die of a fat induced heart attack.

349
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:10,580
But I'm not giving up, and that's enough for me.

350
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:13,300
All right, my friends, that is the end of the video.

351
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:16,900
I know I waited probably a bit too long to talk about Jack Murphy, but I just don't

352
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:18,980
like talking about breaking news in that way.

353
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:20,100
I'm not an ambulance chaser.

354
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:23,700
I wanted to wait until I understood what was underneath the surface of the story, and I

355
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:24,180
think I did.

356
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:25,940
As always, I'm streaming on the gaming channel tonight.

357
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:26,740
Come drop in.

358
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:27,620
I'll see you there.

359
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:28,980
Have a good one, guys.

360
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:29,620
I love you.
