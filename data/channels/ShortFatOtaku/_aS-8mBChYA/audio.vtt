Hello my friends, I'm hanging a bit more artwork today.

00:04.200 --> 00:08.940
As you can see, that's Robo from Chrono Trigger, his schematic, and that's the time machine

00:08.940 --> 00:09.940
from Chrono Trigger.

00:09.940 --> 00:14.500
Man, I just licked my posters, however, I'm not doing nothing.

00:14.500 --> 00:18.520
While I'm hanging these posters and spending the day just basically doing odd jobs, I'm

00:18.520 --> 00:26.280
also uploading my entire backlog to my Bitchute channel, that's Bitchute.com, I think it's

00:26.280 --> 00:30.920
slash short fat otaku, maybe it's slash channel slash short fat otaku, it'll be on the screen,

00:30.920 --> 00:31.920
you'll see what it is.

00:31.920 --> 00:37.360
But yeah, see this, this is on the accuracy of Indefensible, it's like a Dylan Cuthbert

00:37.360 --> 00:40.040
video that I did like four years ago.

00:40.040 --> 00:46.080
Basically the entire SFO backlog that isn't currently on my Bitchute channel is being

00:46.080 --> 00:47.880
uploaded there right now.

00:47.880 --> 00:52.060
There have been people asking me about the status of my Bitchute channel, or if I have

00:52.060 --> 00:58.340
one or whatever, well, I do have one, you can go see it, and as of the end of today,

00:58.340 --> 01:03.980
every single video that I've ever put up will be there, they're being uploaded today, as

01:03.980 --> 01:04.980
you watch this video.

01:04.980 --> 01:06.780
Look, it's happening right now!

01:06.780 --> 01:12.300
Yeah, I've still got a bunch more posters to go, so I'll be doing this all day, just

01:12.300 --> 01:14.740
uploading videos and hanging posters.

01:14.740 --> 01:22.020
Tomorrow, I plan to do a Project Veritas video, which I think the recent Google stuff,

01:22.020 --> 01:26.820
I think that's actually quite important to talk about, I just haven't had time to do

01:26.820 --> 01:31.780
it recently, mainly because editing that Dumping with Scrump last night, last night's Dumping

01:31.780 --> 01:37.460
with Scrump, was an incredibly awful situation.

01:37.460 --> 01:41.980
It took a lot out of me doing that, that was like five days of editing, believe it or not.

01:42.220 --> 01:45.820
Oh, and I guess I might as well talk about this now, a lot of people got mad at that

01:45.820 --> 01:51.460
Dumping with Scrump, because they didn't like Lilith's opinion regarding kids and hormones.

01:51.460 --> 01:56.140
Her opinion isn't mine, I'm not willing to deplatform her because we disagree on things,

01:56.140 --> 01:57.540
I'm not an SJW.

01:57.540 --> 02:02.340
I personally think that if you're trans, you probably shouldn't have hormones until you're

02:02.340 --> 02:08.380
18, or like, I know an age of consent in some countries is 16, you know, whatever, point

02:08.380 --> 02:12.380
is, is that it's one of those things that should be relegated to adults and not children.

02:12.380 --> 02:16.180
But yeah, everyone who wants Lilith banned off the channel, I'm sorry, that's not going

02:16.180 --> 02:17.180
to happen.

02:17.180 --> 02:20.620
I'm willing to platform her and disagree with her.

02:20.620 --> 02:22.940
I'm not a moral gatekeeper here, guys, sorry.

02:22.940 --> 02:25.620
I actually like the Pokemon posters too, they're quite nice.

02:25.620 --> 02:32.500
I guess the last thing to announce is that tonight at twitch.tv slash Game Boomers, probably

02:32.500 --> 02:39.220
between 6 and 7pm EST, there's going to be four of us, me, Dave, Jordan, and my girlfriend

02:39.220 --> 02:44.740
Naomi, and we're going to be playing Tales of Vesperia multiplayer.

02:44.740 --> 02:47.660
It's a JRPG with a multiplayer mode.

02:47.660 --> 02:49.380
So swing by in a few hours.

02:49.380 --> 02:50.380
I'll see you there.

02:50.380 --> 02:50.500
I love you.
