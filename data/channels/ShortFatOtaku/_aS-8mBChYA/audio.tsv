0	4200	Hello my friends, I'm hanging a bit more artwork today.
4200	8940	As you can see, that's Robo from Chrono Trigger, his schematic, and that's the time machine
8940	9940	from Chrono Trigger.
9940	14500	Man, I just licked my posters, however, I'm not doing nothing.
14500	18520	While I'm hanging these posters and spending the day just basically doing odd jobs, I'm
18520	26280	also uploading my entire backlog to my Bitchute channel, that's Bitchute.com, I think it's
26280	30920	slash short fat otaku, maybe it's slash channel slash short fat otaku, it'll be on the screen,
30920	31920	you'll see what it is.
31920	37360	But yeah, see this, this is on the accuracy of Indefensible, it's like a Dylan Cuthbert
37360	40040	video that I did like four years ago.
40040	46080	Basically the entire SFO backlog that isn't currently on my Bitchute channel is being
46080	47880	uploaded there right now.
47880	52060	There have been people asking me about the status of my Bitchute channel, or if I have
52060	58340	one or whatever, well, I do have one, you can go see it, and as of the end of today,
58340	63980	every single video that I've ever put up will be there, they're being uploaded today, as
63980	64980	you watch this video.
64980	66780	Look, it's happening right now!
66780	72300	Yeah, I've still got a bunch more posters to go, so I'll be doing this all day, just
72300	74740	uploading videos and hanging posters.
74740	82020	Tomorrow, I plan to do a Project Veritas video, which I think the recent Google stuff,
82020	86820	I think that's actually quite important to talk about, I just haven't had time to do
86820	91780	it recently, mainly because editing that Dumping with Scrump last night, last night's Dumping
91780	97460	with Scrump, was an incredibly awful situation.
97460	101980	It took a lot out of me doing that, that was like five days of editing, believe it or not.
102220	105820	Oh, and I guess I might as well talk about this now, a lot of people got mad at that
105820	111460	Dumping with Scrump, because they didn't like Lilith's opinion regarding kids and hormones.
111460	116140	Her opinion isn't mine, I'm not willing to deplatform her because we disagree on things,
116140	117540	I'm not an SJW.
117540	122340	I personally think that if you're trans, you probably shouldn't have hormones until you're
122340	128380	18, or like, I know an age of consent in some countries is 16, you know, whatever, point
128380	132380	is, is that it's one of those things that should be relegated to adults and not children.
132380	136180	But yeah, everyone who wants Lilith banned off the channel, I'm sorry, that's not going
136180	137180	to happen.
137180	140620	I'm willing to platform her and disagree with her.
140620	142940	I'm not a moral gatekeeper here, guys, sorry.
142940	145620	I actually like the Pokemon posters too, they're quite nice.
145620	152500	I guess the last thing to announce is that tonight at twitch.tv slash Game Boomers, probably
152500	159220	between 6 and 7pm EST, there's going to be four of us, me, Dave, Jordan, and my girlfriend
159220	164740	Naomi, and we're going to be playing Tales of Vesperia multiplayer.
164740	167660	It's a JRPG with a multiplayer mode.
167660	169380	So swing by in a few hours.
169380	170380	I'll see you there.
170380	170500	I love you.
