00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,200
Hello my friends, I'm hanging a bit more artwork today.

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:08,940
As you can see, that's Robo from Chrono Trigger, his schematic, and that's the time machine

3
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:09,940
from Chrono Trigger.

4
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:14,500
Man, I just licked my posters, however, I'm not doing nothing.

5
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:18,520
While I'm hanging these posters and spending the day just basically doing odd jobs, I'm

6
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:26,280
also uploading my entire backlog to my Bitchute channel, that's Bitchute.com, I think it's

7
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:30,920
slash short fat otaku, maybe it's slash channel slash short fat otaku, it'll be on the screen,

8
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:31,920
you'll see what it is.

9
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:37,360
But yeah, see this, this is on the accuracy of Indefensible, it's like a Dylan Cuthbert

10
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:40,040
video that I did like four years ago.

11
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:46,080
Basically the entire SFO backlog that isn't currently on my Bitchute channel is being

12
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:47,880
uploaded there right now.

13
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:52,060
There have been people asking me about the status of my Bitchute channel, or if I have

14
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:58,340
one or whatever, well, I do have one, you can go see it, and as of the end of today,

15
00:00:58,340 --> 00:01:03,980
every single video that I've ever put up will be there, they're being uploaded today, as

16
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:04,980
you watch this video.

17
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:06,780
Look, it's happening right now!

18
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:12,300
Yeah, I've still got a bunch more posters to go, so I'll be doing this all day, just

19
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:14,740
uploading videos and hanging posters.

20
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:22,020
Tomorrow, I plan to do a Project Veritas video, which I think the recent Google stuff,

21
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:26,820
I think that's actually quite important to talk about, I just haven't had time to do

22
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:31,780
it recently, mainly because editing that Dumping with Scrump last night, last night's Dumping

23
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:37,460
with Scrump, was an incredibly awful situation.

24
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:41,980
It took a lot out of me doing that, that was like five days of editing, believe it or not.

25
00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:45,820
Oh, and I guess I might as well talk about this now, a lot of people got mad at that

26
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:51,460
Dumping with Scrump, because they didn't like Lilith's opinion regarding kids and hormones.

27
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:56,140
Her opinion isn't mine, I'm not willing to deplatform her because we disagree on things,

28
00:01:56,140 --> 00:01:57,540
I'm not an SJW.

29
00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:02,340
I personally think that if you're trans, you probably shouldn't have hormones until you're

30
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:08,380
18, or like, I know an age of consent in some countries is 16, you know, whatever, point

31
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:12,380
is, is that it's one of those things that should be relegated to adults and not children.

32
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:16,180
But yeah, everyone who wants Lilith banned off the channel, I'm sorry, that's not going

33
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:17,180
to happen.

34
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:20,620
I'm willing to platform her and disagree with her.

35
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:22,940
I'm not a moral gatekeeper here, guys, sorry.

36
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:25,620
I actually like the Pokemon posters too, they're quite nice.

37
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:32,500
I guess the last thing to announce is that tonight at twitch.tv slash Game Boomers, probably

38
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:39,220
between 6 and 7pm EST, there's going to be four of us, me, Dave, Jordan, and my girlfriend

39
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:44,740
Naomi, and we're going to be playing Tales of Vesperia multiplayer.

40
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:47,660
It's a JRPG with a multiplayer mode.

41
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:49,380
So swing by in a few hours.

42
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:50,380
I'll see you there.

43
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:50,500
I love you.
