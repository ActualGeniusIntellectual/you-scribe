00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,120
Hello, my friends welcome to SJ weekly today, I'm only drinking ice water

2
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:13,080
Because it's actually quite warm out let's start with

3
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:16,120
tor.com's

4
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,800
problematic classics

5
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:22,960
For questions to ask when beloved books haven't aged well

6
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:29,800
Now we all know about the whole the whole huckleberry Finn situation, right?

7
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:38,120
Where because the the word might have some some racialized terms that are no longer considered polite to say

8
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:43,300
People want the book banned or or censored or rewritten

9
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:49,040
which is obviously ridiculous because it was written in the time that it was written and

10
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:51,240
That is what this article is all about

11
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:58,580
I recently decided to reread th whites legendary classic the once and future King at first

12
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:02,500
I was delighted by the exact book. I remembered but from my youth

13
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:11,080
Wart young King Arthur being taught by Merlin goofy King Pelennor sullen Kay a lot of ridiculous adventures with some

14
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:13,160
anti-war

15
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:15,780
anti-totalitarian commentary mixed in for good measure as

16
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:24,600
I continued I found some bits. I didn't remember I hadn't noticed the occasional asides about the base Indians

17
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:30,680
White says archery was a serious business once before it was turned over to Indians and boys

18
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:36,600
He talks about the destructive Indians who chased the settlers across the plains. I

19
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:39,820
Did not feel good about this

20
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:42,580
Well, I'm sure you didn't you know

21
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:46,680
Running into a word that may be considered racist today

22
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:50,040
But in the time the book was written was considered fine

23
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:55,460
Maybe maybe the changing nature of language is something that you will have to

24
00:01:55,980 --> 00:02:01,920
You know come to grips with as an adult then I found the n-word. Oh, no

25
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:10,400
Granted it was used by a bird and an unhinged one at that in a rant where the hawk blames the administration the politicians

26
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:13,500
The Bolsheviks and so on for the state of the world

27
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:19,060
Another character rebukes him for his comments though not for using the word specifically

28
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:24,960
Later in the book Lancelot uses the same word to describe the Saracen Knight

29
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:27,540
Palomides I

30
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:33,120
Couldn't believe it not so much that the word was used but the fact that I didn't remember it. I

31
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,180
mean

32
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:38,740
You were a kid. You probably just brushed it off

33
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:43,860
You probably thought you had stumbled on something that was cool and adult or something, right?

34
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:45,140
And so you just kind of kept it to yourself

35
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:49,660
I was equally shocked that I didn't remember the denigrating comments about Native Americans

36
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:52,300
It left me feeling distressed about the book

37
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:57,340
I had been trying to convince my teenage daughters to read it had that been a mistake

38
00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:00,700
Probably not, you know because

39
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:03,540
consider this consider this

40
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:08,980
you were presumably a teenager probably around the same age as your daughters when you read it and

41
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:14,220
You obviously grew up fine or at the very least you grew into the type of

42
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:23,260
Good obedient progressive that you want your daughters to be your exposure to the word Indian or the n-word

43
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:31,660
Clearly didn't change what you later became. So if your goal is to raise your teenage daughters into good obedient progressives

44
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:40,060
It's probably still gonna happen if they read this book most of us who love speculative fiction run into this problem at some point

45
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:44,140
There are classics of the genre that are uncomfortable for various reasons

46
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:49,580
Some of them are straight-out racist or unrepentantly misogynistic or homophobic or all of the above

47
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:55,380
How and why and when we come to these realizations can change depending on who we are

48
00:03:55,380 --> 00:04:02,740
I'm guessing none of my african-american friends have come across the n-word in a novel and not noticed even as kids

49
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:07,300
so this is the biggest problem that I have with this article is that

50
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:10,140
It completely discounts the possibility

51
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:15,180
that these works of fiction are racist or

52
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:17,380
misogynistic or

53
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:22,580
Homophobic for a point maybe they are those things in order to show why they're wrong

54
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:27,860
maybe they are those things in order to be in support of

55
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:34,080
Progressive or or social justice politics and I'm gonna read between the lines here a little bit. This is why I think

56
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:37,080
Sjw's want to censor

57
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:40,560
Everything for example

58
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:46,880
We have this article here on PC gamer Nazi tattoos removed from survival game scum

59
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:51,880
Developer apologizes the developer and studios to the tattoos inclusion was a mistake

60
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:58,680
after an initial abrasive statement from a community manager now the point of the game is that

61
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:05,640
You I think you play as a convict or someone who is who is in jail somehow and if you don't know what the prison system

62
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:09,000
There are a lot of white supremacists in there

63
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:16,000
There are a lot of legit Nazis who are going to get tattoos of like the the swastika or 1488

64
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:22,960
Somewhere on their bodies. So to have a character that has Nazi tattoos on their bodies. It actually makes sense

65
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:27,580
This doesn't mean that the developer is in support of Nazi ideology

66
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:35,540
it means that the developer has created a character within the world that is in support of Nazi ideology and in this

67
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:43,280
Case, it would make sense that this character would exist, but they're even censoring that now if you have

68
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:45,700
say somebody who is

69
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:47,820
you know politically

70
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:51,140
unengaged or or uneducated or something and

71
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:54,780
They're confronted with

72
00:05:54,820 --> 00:06:01,200
Two different points of view they they have like a Nazi on one side talking about the purity of the white race

73
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:05,060
And then they have an SJW on the other side and the SJW is like no we have to have

74
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:13,440
Complete equality for everyone no matter what and then let's say this uninformed idiot asked something like how come neo-nazis are bad

75
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:19,840
How come the white supremacists are a bad group? You could show them a game like scum with a

76
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:26,520
Shitty neo-nazi character in it show him what he acts like show him what he does and say

77
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:29,600
This is a neo-nazi. That is the point of art

78
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:36,240
Art does in some way reflect reality. It does have something to teach us about the real world

79
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:42,200
But when SJW's censor art that are even in their position

80
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:48,680
Art that would show their political opponents to be as bad as they are in real life

81
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:52,140
That means that SJW's are simply saying

82
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:56,100
You don't need to be taught why Nazis are bad

83
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:59,800
You simply need to believe me when I tell you that they are bad

84
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:04,440
And that's the problem with the Nazi tattoo being removed from the scum game

85
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:07,720
And if we go back here that is the problem with this

86
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:15,040
This four questions to ask when beloved books have an aged well article because the four questions in this article are is

87
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:18,660
This a work I can continue to recommend to others

88
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:22,640
well, just because it has

89
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:28,920
Slurs in it that you didn't notice before it doesn't degrade the quality of the work. In fact, that may be the point of it

90
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:34,280
But if you're an ideologue that is looking to indoctrinate people rather than teach them

91
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:40,400
You might not want them to read it question two. Is this a work I can continue to enjoy privately

92
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:44,040
The answer is honestly why not? This is where you get those people who?

93
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:45,760
have

94
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:51,880
kinks and and either engage in a certain type of sex or watch a certain type of porn and

95
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:59,720
Yet they feel like they shouldn't because it's problematic. Their kink is problematic. You know, you might have like a

96
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:05,480
Feminist woman who is extremely submissive in bed and she says I really like this but you know what?

97
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:10,920
I I feel like I can't do it because I have to be a strong independent woman who don't need no man

98
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:13,040
And that's that that's what this is

99
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:19,680
you can obviously enjoy something privately that you would not recommend to everyone else and

100
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:24,560
You don't even need to bring politics into that discussion to make that determination

101
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:31,000
Question three. Is there another work that doesn't have these problems but occupies the same space

102
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:34,240
this is where we get into the SJW tendency of

103
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:36,920
replacing and co-opting

104
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:40,360
pieces of art and and cannons

105
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:42,920
and whole industries frankly

106
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:47,560
You know, we saw this with Magic the Gathering we saw this with Vampire the Masquerade

107
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:51,520
We saw this with all sorts of tabletop

108
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:57,800
We saw this with Warhammer 40k. We see it with video games soon enough. You're probably gonna hear something like

109
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:04,320
Why would you play Doom eternal or cuphead when there are these?

110
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:09,680
SJW friendly alternatives in the same genre as those games and

111
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:17,560
Question four. Can I create a work that is a corrective to the problematic work? I love this is where you get

112
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:19,880
like the the Star Wars

113
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:26,920
Situation where SJW's come into Star Wars and just completely overwrite everything and destroy it

114
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:34,240
This is where you get the comics gate situation where SJW's roll into comics completely co-opt everything and destroy it

115
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:39,440
These questions are basically how can I prevent the spread of work?

116
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,560
that is problematic and

117
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:43,000
How can I?

118
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:48,760
Whitewash things to be in line with social justice and speaking of whitewashing the past

119
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:56,200
Here's an archived tweet from Vox. You can draw a straight line from John McCain to Donald Trump through Sarah Palin

120
00:09:56,400 --> 00:10:02,800
This tweet was later deleted because it came just after John McCain had died, but it links to this article, which is still up

121
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:07,520
John McCain Sarah Palin and the rise of reality TV politics

122
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:13,640
McCain empowered a demagogue who put the Republican Party on them on the path to Donald Trump

123
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:19,960
The party of Donald Trump began almost ten years ago to the day when John McCain tapped Sarah Palin to join his ticket

124
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:23,320
It's one of the most important moments of McCain's career

125
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:28,060
He proved willing to empower a demagogue when he thought doing so would improve his political fortunes

126
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:35,400
Exactly the sin so many of his colleagues in the Republican Party have committed since Trump won their party's nomination and a lot of this

127
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:41,840
Is just a general recap of the stupidity of Sarah Palin in the 2008 elections

128
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:47,920
And I think we all know that at this point. However, what's interesting is that the article claims McCain

129
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:50,440
Sacrificed his values to win

130
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:53,880
McCain's campaign was in freefall at the end of August 2008

131
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:59,480
He needed a Hail Mary the author of this article flew to Alaska the day after Palin was tapped

132
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:04,160
He headed to the city's clerk office to pick up copies of meeting minutes from when she was mayor

133
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:10,240
I assumed the McCain campaign had done the same but no as I wrote at the time

134
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:15,960
I just got off the phone with a very helpful city clerk at the West Silla City Clerk's Office

135
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:21,840
Christie Smithers who was pulling some documents for me from when governor Sarah Palin was mayor

136
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:27,240
I told her I appreciated her help since I'm sure she's been bombarded with requests in the last few weeks

137
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:33,720
The clerk's office keeps all city council meeting agendas minutes legislation ordinances, etc

138
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:38,940
She chuckled then she told me that I'm the first person who has asked her office for anything

139
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:47,960
McCain was prepared to put Palin a heartbeat away from the presidency without even checking if she could do the job

140
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,680
Instead he picked her because she seemed like a good play to the base

141
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:57,580
Now this is a very interesting line of thought and let's remember it for later

142
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,680
Palin unleashed reality politics

143
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:06,180
McCain and Palin lost but after the election Palin stayed in the limelight for a time

144
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:08,960
She got a deal with Fox News and traveled the country

145
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:12,160
endorsing and stumping for Tea Party candidates

146
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:19,440
Schmidt who had pushed McCain to select Palin was depicted in the HBO version of the reported story of the 2008 campaign

147
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:23,360
Game change as racked with guilt for his role in the decision

148
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:27,840
This wasn't a campaign. It was a bad reality show he says

149
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:35,000
Palin herself went on to sign an actual deal for a reality TV show and here's where we get back to Vox's tweet

150
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:39,120
you can draw a straight line from John McCain to Donald Trump through Sarah Palin and

151
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:41,720
Vox is right

152
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:46,640
but not for the reason that they outline in this article in this article Vox makes the claim that

153
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:54,760
John McCain legitimized Sarah Palin and Sarah Palin was basically just a doofy

154
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:58,280
Made-up version of a reality TV star and

155
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:05,360
Then her popularity allowed for an actual reality TV star Donald Trump to take the presidency

156
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:14,000
That's not necessarily how it happened though because I am old enough to remember the 2008 elections with

157
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:17,160
with a lot of clarity I remember

158
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:19,840
very clearly I

159
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:24,040
Remember John McCain that that whole very famous exchange where he was with a?

160
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:28,480
Woman at a rally and she she's exclaimed

161
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:35,600
I believe Obama's an Arab and what she meant by that was was a Muslim and and potentially a supporter of

162
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:41,640
Radical Islam and McCain stole the microphone away and said no ma'am

163
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:45,240
He's an honest family man that I have

164
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:48,500
significant disagreements with on the issues

165
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:54,380
But John McCain outright said that if Obama were to win

166
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:59,140
he would not believe that Obama would take the country down the path of of

167
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:04,260
Radical Islamist treason or something he just said that he disagreed with his politics

168
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:11,620
But that he was ultimately a good guy and really that seemed to be the turning point of the election because Obama's

169
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:19,380
Popularity had had had become so huge so great and the Republican base had seemed to go off the rails

170
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:25,100
So much that when McCain had to step in and defend Obama from his own base

171
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:30,100
It was it was done the election was over at that point, and that was the turning point however

172
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:33,420
it was still the right thing to do it was still the honorable thing to do and

173
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:39,980
Despite that the media still absolutely destroyed John McCain

174
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:47,260
I remember this very clearly he was he was tired and feathered. He was slandered the far-left called him a

175
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:53,940
Nazi and a tyrant and you know all the things that they called Donald Trump today

176
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:58,780
Basically even as John McCain was acting reasonably and honorably

177
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:04,540
The left took a giant shit on him, and then the same thing happened with Romney

178
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:10,620
Romney acted very civilly even though he had obvious disagreements with Obama and

179
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:16,860
The left still tired and feathered him like he was some kind of Satan spawn

180
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:23,280
And he lost so when the third time comes around and Donald Trump is is now the Republican candidate

181
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:28,020
He just said fuck it. I'm gonna get tired and feathered anyway

182
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:36,180
So how about I do something that is worth being tired and feathered for and that's why we have Donald Trump as president because I

183
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:43,060
Think everyone clued in over the course of the early 2000s everyone clued in to what the media does

184
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:47,800
To right-wing candidates whether or not they deserve it

185
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:53,580
They'll just completely shit on them act like that the Democrats have some kind of

186
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:59,860
Inherent moral high ground which they don't and no matter how reasonable the person on the right acts

187
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:06,020
They still just get a smear job ran against them. It just seems to be how it is and that's why we have Trump

188
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:11,360
That's the line that you can draw between John McCain and Trump Vox. It doesn't go through Sarah Palin

189
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:16,700
It it goes through the the left-wing bias of the media that has existed

190
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:22,340
Since the Bush years frankly and if you want an example of that left-wing media bias

191
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:24,340
Let's read this article

192
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:27,660
immigrants don't need to integrate you do oh

193
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:37,500
There's no such thing as integration for immigrants and their descendants

194
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:44,900
Growing up in rural Britain Wales to be precise. I was the poster child for immigration. My teachers liked me

195
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:51,920
I was a prefect I captained my team. I won ribbons on sports day attended high grades and did after-school activities

196
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:55,200
I did everything they tell young brown kids to do

197
00:16:55,760 --> 00:17:02,880
It never occurred to me that I was the only one who considered myself just like everyone else. I'm sure that's not the case

198
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:11,320
Once I was far enough away several years later somewhere between Cairo and Gaza after a Facebook exchange with an old classmate

199
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,600
Who told me that he knows I'm a good person

200
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:19,680
So I don't need to apologize for whatever it was that some Muslim had done a file opened in the back of my mind

201
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:25,660
For months it began to fill with memories I'd shrugged off poo-pooed or not given a second thought to at the time

202
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:32,960
like when I was 19 lying on a trolley in a hotel conference room in central Durham a needle in my arm and a

203
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:36,680
Bag of my o-plus switching or somewhere around might near my hip. I

204
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:42,720
Knew that donating blood made me act oddly that the gore of it made me giggle uncontrollably

205
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:49,240
I tried to redirect my need to make a noise by babbling rolling my tongue ridiculously and popping my cheeks it helped

206
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:52,640
The nurse walked up to me to check on my sack of blood. I

207
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,380
Stole a look at it and it only made me babble more

208
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:59,800
You're speaking in your language, aren't you?

209
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:06,640
Because a nervous brown teenager prattling at the grossness of giving blood must of course be speaking her native language

210
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:10,880
My language is English. Damn it. I'm sure this was traumatizing

211
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:18,000
I'm absolutely sure this was just a harrowing experience for you, and I'm sorry that you had to deal with it

212
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:21,800
Also, I just realized there's this comment some somehow up here and it says

213
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:29,840
Integration an already problematic concept that should be abandoned in favor of acceptance. What?

214
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:32,120
Okay

215
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:34,120
There's a reason that

216
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:40,020
Societies want integration. It's not because of racism. It's not because of any kind of

217
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:42,880
racial or ethnic or religious hatred

218
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,000
it's because

219
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
societies have a

220
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:52,560
Duty to promote social cohesion at least to a point certainly not over the rights of the individual

221
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:57,740
but at least to a point and they have a duty to to continue the existence of

222
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:00,280
the native culture of that society

223
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,840
You know

224
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:07,040
There is a native British culture. That is not

225
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:09,720
British Islamic or

226
00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:16,000
British Chinese or British anything else, but just straight-up British and

227
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:19,920
Britain has a responsibility to maintain that culture

228
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:23,400
Canada has a responsibility to maintain its native culture

229
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:30,760
And by the way that includes Canada's native non-white population the people that were here before Europeans came over

230
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:36,240
Absolutely, their culture should be preserved the same with the United States the same with any country

231
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:41,560
It's very obvious that that Muslim immigrants to Britain are not part of

232
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:48,360
Native British culture and that in Britain native British culture does have to at least be given

233
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:50,760
some type of precedent

234
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:53,560
Some type of consideration

235
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:59,820
So this idea that no you're not going to integrate that the

236
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:04,600
Natives of the area have to integrate into you. It's a ridiculous notion

237
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:11,160
There's no question that my hijab my skin color and my innate foreignness despite being born and raised in the UK

238
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:14,080
Is what got me put in lower sets?

239
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:16,000
Okay

240
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,440
No

241
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:19,440
No

242
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:24,520
This is this is another big problem with social justice is that they view

243
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:28,480
differences as one always being an

244
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:36,040
Instance of the greater versus the lesser and to always being a power struggle. You can definitely have

245
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:43,960
Separate but equal you can definitely have things that are different but still considered with the same amount of at least

246
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:45,840
cultural respect

247
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:51,040
instead of telling the foreigners to assimilate Britain you should take a long hard look at yourself because

248
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:57,840
Participation does not bring minorities acceptance in order to achieve harmony in Britain's multicultural landscape

249
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:00,760
It's not immigrants who need to integrate. It's the white majority

250
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:02,760
Majority

251
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:07,840
Until the majority stops treating people of color like a curiosity for their entertainment

252
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:13,160
The country will be stuck in an existential crisis in which British children grow up as outsiders

253
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:19,160
This is this is really interesting. Okay, because in this article

254
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:25,680
Almost everything that she brings up has to do with not everything but almost everything

255
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:29,160
She brings up has to do with her being a Muslim wearing a hijab

256
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:32,920
Talking about her hair, which is obviously covered up in public view

257
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:35,680
None of these things are racial

258
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:37,640
You know if you were to take you know

259
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:42,680
She says she's Iraqi Iraqi by heart British by upbringing if you were to take an an Iraqi girl

260
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:46,360
who wasn't a Muslim or at least didn't wear a hijab and

261
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:51,280
Raised her in Britain. She would likely just be straight-up accepted

262
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:57,920
When you wear something like a hijab, it's it's almost like a social handshake

263
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:05,280
It's you making a direct statement about who you are and the value system that you live your life by

264
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:10,020
Because only a certain type of woman wears a hijab a Muslim woman

265
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:15,240
it's very similar to a Christian wearing a very visible rosary that's also a statement and

266
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,920
If you don't like what that statement says to other people

267
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:22,720
Maybe you should not make that statement
