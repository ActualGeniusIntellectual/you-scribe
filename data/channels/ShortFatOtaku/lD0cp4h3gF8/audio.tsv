0	7120	Hello, my friends welcome to SJ weekly today, I'm only drinking ice water
9960	13080	Because it's actually quite warm out let's start with
14120	16120	tor.com's
16800	18800	problematic classics
18880	22960	For questions to ask when beloved books haven't aged well
24360	29800	Now we all know about the whole the whole huckleberry Finn situation, right?
30600	38120	Where because the the word might have some some racialized terms that are no longer considered polite to say
38640	43300	People want the book banned or or censored or rewritten
43800	49040	which is obviously ridiculous because it was written in the time that it was written and
49480	51240	That is what this article is all about
51240	58580	I recently decided to reread th whites legendary classic the once and future King at first
58620	62500	I was delighted by the exact book. I remembered but from my youth
63060	71080	Wart young King Arthur being taught by Merlin goofy King Pelennor sullen Kay a lot of ridiculous adventures with some
71460	73160	anti-war
73160	75780	anti-totalitarian commentary mixed in for good measure as
76740	84600	I continued I found some bits. I didn't remember I hadn't noticed the occasional asides about the base Indians
85080	90680	White says archery was a serious business once before it was turned over to Indians and boys
91380	96600	He talks about the destructive Indians who chased the settlers across the plains. I
97820	99820	Did not feel good about this
100260	102580	Well, I'm sure you didn't you know
103240	106680	Running into a word that may be considered racist today
106680	110040	But in the time the book was written was considered fine
110040	115460	Maybe maybe the changing nature of language is something that you will have to
115980	121920	You know come to grips with as an adult then I found the n-word. Oh, no
122520	130400	Granted it was used by a bird and an unhinged one at that in a rant where the hawk blames the administration the politicians
130400	133500	The Bolsheviks and so on for the state of the world
134240	139060	Another character rebukes him for his comments though not for using the word specifically
140060	144960	Later in the book Lancelot uses the same word to describe the Saracen Knight
145820	147540	Palomides I
147540	153120	Couldn't believe it not so much that the word was used but the fact that I didn't remember it. I
154000	155180	mean
155180	158740	You were a kid. You probably just brushed it off
158780	163860	You probably thought you had stumbled on something that was cool and adult or something, right?
163860	165140	And so you just kind of kept it to yourself
165140	169660	I was equally shocked that I didn't remember the denigrating comments about Native Americans
169820	172300	It left me feeling distressed about the book
172300	177340	I had been trying to convince my teenage daughters to read it had that been a mistake
178540	180700	Probably not, you know because
181540	183540	consider this consider this
183540	188980	you were presumably a teenager probably around the same age as your daughters when you read it and
189540	194220	You obviously grew up fine or at the very least you grew into the type of
195140	203260	Good obedient progressive that you want your daughters to be your exposure to the word Indian or the n-word
203920	211660	Clearly didn't change what you later became. So if your goal is to raise your teenage daughters into good obedient progressives
212420	220060	It's probably still gonna happen if they read this book most of us who love speculative fiction run into this problem at some point
220380	224140	There are classics of the genre that are uncomfortable for various reasons
224340	229580	Some of them are straight-out racist or unrepentantly misogynistic or homophobic or all of the above
229860	235380	How and why and when we come to these realizations can change depending on who we are
235380	242740	I'm guessing none of my african-american friends have come across the n-word in a novel and not noticed even as kids
243220	247300	so this is the biggest problem that I have with this article is that
247620	250140	It completely discounts the possibility
250860	255180	that these works of fiction are racist or
255940	257380	misogynistic or
257380	262580	Homophobic for a point maybe they are those things in order to show why they're wrong
263100	267860	maybe they are those things in order to be in support of
268420	274080	Progressive or or social justice politics and I'm gonna read between the lines here a little bit. This is why I think
275080	277080	Sjw's want to censor
278760	280560	Everything for example
280560	286880	We have this article here on PC gamer Nazi tattoos removed from survival game scum
287520	291880	Developer apologizes the developer and studios to the tattoos inclusion was a mistake
292320	298680	after an initial abrasive statement from a community manager now the point of the game is that
299280	305640	You I think you play as a convict or someone who is who is in jail somehow and if you don't know what the prison system
306120	309000	There are a lot of white supremacists in there
309000	316000	There are a lot of legit Nazis who are going to get tattoos of like the the swastika or 1488
316580	322960	Somewhere on their bodies. So to have a character that has Nazi tattoos on their bodies. It actually makes sense
322960	327580	This doesn't mean that the developer is in support of Nazi ideology
327620	335540	it means that the developer has created a character within the world that is in support of Nazi ideology and in this
335540	343280	Case, it would make sense that this character would exist, but they're even censoring that now if you have
343700	345700	say somebody who is
345820	347820	you know politically
347820	351140	unengaged or or uneducated or something and
352980	354780	They're confronted with
354820	361200	Two different points of view they they have like a Nazi on one side talking about the purity of the white race
361200	365060	And then they have an SJW on the other side and the SJW is like no we have to have
365340	373440	Complete equality for everyone no matter what and then let's say this uninformed idiot asked something like how come neo-nazis are bad
373440	379840	How come the white supremacists are a bad group? You could show them a game like scum with a
380520	386520	Shitty neo-nazi character in it show him what he acts like show him what he does and say
386520	389600	This is a neo-nazi. That is the point of art
390120	396240	Art does in some way reflect reality. It does have something to teach us about the real world
397320	402200	But when SJW's censor art that are even in their position
403000	408680	Art that would show their political opponents to be as bad as they are in real life
409640	412140	That means that SJW's are simply saying
412720	416100	You don't need to be taught why Nazis are bad
416400	419800	You simply need to believe me when I tell you that they are bad
419800	424440	And that's the problem with the Nazi tattoo being removed from the scum game
424440	427720	And if we go back here that is the problem with this
428480	435040	This four questions to ask when beloved books have an aged well article because the four questions in this article are is
435760	438660	This a work I can continue to recommend to others
439760	442640	well, just because it has
443360	448920	Slurs in it that you didn't notice before it doesn't degrade the quality of the work. In fact, that may be the point of it
449600	454280	But if you're an ideologue that is looking to indoctrinate people rather than teach them
454360	460400	You might not want them to read it question two. Is this a work I can continue to enjoy privately
460560	464040	The answer is honestly why not? This is where you get those people who?
464640	465760	have
465760	471880	kinks and and either engage in a certain type of sex or watch a certain type of porn and
472120	479720	Yet they feel like they shouldn't because it's problematic. Their kink is problematic. You know, you might have like a
480360	485480	Feminist woman who is extremely submissive in bed and she says I really like this but you know what?
485480	490920	I I feel like I can't do it because I have to be a strong independent woman who don't need no man
491040	493040	And that's that that's what this is
493200	499680	you can obviously enjoy something privately that you would not recommend to everyone else and
501280	504560	You don't even need to bring politics into that discussion to make that determination
505440	511000	Question three. Is there another work that doesn't have these problems but occupies the same space
511160	514240	this is where we get into the SJW tendency of
514920	516920	replacing and co-opting
517960	520360	pieces of art and and cannons
520920	522920	and whole industries frankly
523480	527560	You know, we saw this with Magic the Gathering we saw this with Vampire the Masquerade
528240	531520	We saw this with all sorts of tabletop
532640	537800	We saw this with Warhammer 40k. We see it with video games soon enough. You're probably gonna hear something like
538360	544320	Why would you play Doom eternal or cuphead when there are these?
545080	549680	SJW friendly alternatives in the same genre as those games and
550120	557560	Question four. Can I create a work that is a corrective to the problematic work? I love this is where you get
557880	559880	like the the Star Wars
560560	566920	Situation where SJW's come into Star Wars and just completely overwrite everything and destroy it
566960	574240	This is where you get the comics gate situation where SJW's roll into comics completely co-opt everything and destroy it
574240	579440	These questions are basically how can I prevent the spread of work?
579680	581560	that is problematic and
581560	583000	How can I?
583000	588760	Whitewash things to be in line with social justice and speaking of whitewashing the past
588760	596200	Here's an archived tweet from Vox. You can draw a straight line from John McCain to Donald Trump through Sarah Palin
596400	602800	This tweet was later deleted because it came just after John McCain had died, but it links to this article, which is still up
603800	607520	John McCain Sarah Palin and the rise of reality TV politics
608400	613640	McCain empowered a demagogue who put the Republican Party on them on the path to Donald Trump
613640	619960	The party of Donald Trump began almost ten years ago to the day when John McCain tapped Sarah Palin to join his ticket
620600	623320	It's one of the most important moments of McCain's career
623480	628060	He proved willing to empower a demagogue when he thought doing so would improve his political fortunes
628400	635400	Exactly the sin so many of his colleagues in the Republican Party have committed since Trump won their party's nomination and a lot of this
635480	641840	Is just a general recap of the stupidity of Sarah Palin in the 2008 elections
642440	647920	And I think we all know that at this point. However, what's interesting is that the article claims McCain
648440	650440	Sacrificed his values to win
650800	653880	McCain's campaign was in freefall at the end of August 2008
653880	659480	He needed a Hail Mary the author of this article flew to Alaska the day after Palin was tapped
659480	664160	He headed to the city's clerk office to pick up copies of meeting minutes from when she was mayor
664160	670240	I assumed the McCain campaign had done the same but no as I wrote at the time
670240	675960	I just got off the phone with a very helpful city clerk at the West Silla City Clerk's Office
676480	681840	Christie Smithers who was pulling some documents for me from when governor Sarah Palin was mayor
681840	687240	I told her I appreciated her help since I'm sure she's been bombarded with requests in the last few weeks
687880	693720	The clerk's office keeps all city council meeting agendas minutes legislation ordinances, etc
694240	698940	She chuckled then she told me that I'm the first person who has asked her office for anything
700920	707960	McCain was prepared to put Palin a heartbeat away from the presidency without even checking if she could do the job
709000	712680	Instead he picked her because she seemed like a good play to the base
713360	717580	Now this is a very interesting line of thought and let's remember it for later
718160	720680	Palin unleashed reality politics
721280	726180	McCain and Palin lost but after the election Palin stayed in the limelight for a time
726520	728960	She got a deal with Fox News and traveled the country
729800	732160	endorsing and stumping for Tea Party candidates
732600	739440	Schmidt who had pushed McCain to select Palin was depicted in the HBO version of the reported story of the 2008 campaign
739660	743360	Game change as racked with guilt for his role in the decision
744240	747840	This wasn't a campaign. It was a bad reality show he says
748400	755000	Palin herself went on to sign an actual deal for a reality TV show and here's where we get back to Vox's tweet
755000	759120	you can draw a straight line from John McCain to Donald Trump through Sarah Palin and
760120	761720	Vox is right
761720	766640	but not for the reason that they outline in this article in this article Vox makes the claim that
767560	774760	John McCain legitimized Sarah Palin and Sarah Palin was basically just a doofy
775320	778280	Made-up version of a reality TV star and
778920	785360	Then her popularity allowed for an actual reality TV star Donald Trump to take the presidency
786440	794000	That's not necessarily how it happened though because I am old enough to remember the 2008 elections with
794660	797160	with a lot of clarity I remember
797920	799840	very clearly I
799840	804040	Remember John McCain that that whole very famous exchange where he was with a?
805160	808480	Woman at a rally and she she's exclaimed
808480	815600	I believe Obama's an Arab and what she meant by that was was a Muslim and and potentially a supporter of
816680	821640	Radical Islam and McCain stole the microphone away and said no ma'am
822400	825240	He's an honest family man that I have
826240	828500	significant disagreements with on the issues
829300	834380	But John McCain outright said that if Obama were to win
834500	839140	he would not believe that Obama would take the country down the path of of
839820	844260	Radical Islamist treason or something he just said that he disagreed with his politics
844500	851620	But that he was ultimately a good guy and really that seemed to be the turning point of the election because Obama's
852500	859380	Popularity had had had become so huge so great and the Republican base had seemed to go off the rails
859420	865100	So much that when McCain had to step in and defend Obama from his own base
865100	870100	It was it was done the election was over at that point, and that was the turning point however
870100	873420	it was still the right thing to do it was still the honorable thing to do and
874600	879980	Despite that the media still absolutely destroyed John McCain
880020	887260	I remember this very clearly he was he was tired and feathered. He was slandered the far-left called him a
888660	893940	Nazi and a tyrant and you know all the things that they called Donald Trump today
894100	898780	Basically even as John McCain was acting reasonably and honorably
899860	904540	The left took a giant shit on him, and then the same thing happened with Romney
905220	910620	Romney acted very civilly even though he had obvious disagreements with Obama and
911220	916860	The left still tired and feathered him like he was some kind of Satan spawn
916860	923280	And he lost so when the third time comes around and Donald Trump is is now the Republican candidate
924340	928020	He just said fuck it. I'm gonna get tired and feathered anyway
928380	936180	So how about I do something that is worth being tired and feathered for and that's why we have Donald Trump as president because I
936460	943060	Think everyone clued in over the course of the early 2000s everyone clued in to what the media does
943740	947800	To right-wing candidates whether or not they deserve it
947980	953580	They'll just completely shit on them act like that the Democrats have some kind of
953980	959860	Inherent moral high ground which they don't and no matter how reasonable the person on the right acts
960140	966020	They still just get a smear job ran against them. It just seems to be how it is and that's why we have Trump
966020	971360	That's the line that you can draw between John McCain and Trump Vox. It doesn't go through Sarah Palin
971860	976700	It it goes through the the left-wing bias of the media that has existed
977100	982340	Since the Bush years frankly and if you want an example of that left-wing media bias
982340	984340	Let's read this article
984540	987660	immigrants don't need to integrate you do oh
992220	997500	There's no such thing as integration for immigrants and their descendants
998580	1004900	Growing up in rural Britain Wales to be precise. I was the poster child for immigration. My teachers liked me
1004900	1011920	I was a prefect I captained my team. I won ribbons on sports day attended high grades and did after-school activities
1011960	1015200	I did everything they tell young brown kids to do
1015760	1022880	It never occurred to me that I was the only one who considered myself just like everyone else. I'm sure that's not the case
1025000	1031320	Once I was far enough away several years later somewhere between Cairo and Gaza after a Facebook exchange with an old classmate
1031760	1033600	Who told me that he knows I'm a good person
1033600	1039680	So I don't need to apologize for whatever it was that some Muslim had done a file opened in the back of my mind
1040560	1045660	For months it began to fill with memories I'd shrugged off poo-pooed or not given a second thought to at the time
1046360	1052960	like when I was 19 lying on a trolley in a hotel conference room in central Durham a needle in my arm and a
1052960	1056680	Bag of my o-plus switching or somewhere around might near my hip. I
1057940	1062720	Knew that donating blood made me act oddly that the gore of it made me giggle uncontrollably
1062720	1069240	I tried to redirect my need to make a noise by babbling rolling my tongue ridiculously and popping my cheeks it helped
1070040	1072640	The nurse walked up to me to check on my sack of blood. I
1074000	1076380	Stole a look at it and it only made me babble more
1077040	1079800	You're speaking in your language, aren't you?
1080600	1086640	Because a nervous brown teenager prattling at the grossness of giving blood must of course be speaking her native language
1087140	1090880	My language is English. Damn it. I'm sure this was traumatizing
1091200	1098000	I'm absolutely sure this was just a harrowing experience for you, and I'm sorry that you had to deal with it
1098040	1101800	Also, I just realized there's this comment some somehow up here and it says
1103800	1109840	Integration an already problematic concept that should be abandoned in favor of acceptance. What?
1110980	1112120	Okay
1112120	1114120	There's a reason that
1114480	1120020	Societies want integration. It's not because of racism. It's not because of any kind of
1120580	1122880	racial or ethnic or religious hatred
1123440	1125000	it's because
1125000	1127000	societies have a
1127320	1132560	Duty to promote social cohesion at least to a point certainly not over the rights of the individual
1132560	1137740	but at least to a point and they have a duty to to continue the existence of
1138280	1140280	the native culture of that society
1141000	1142840	You know
1142840	1147040	There is a native British culture. That is not
1147720	1149720	British Islamic or
1149860	1156000	British Chinese or British anything else, but just straight-up British and
1156720	1159920	Britain has a responsibility to maintain that culture
1160400	1163400	Canada has a responsibility to maintain its native culture
1163400	1170760	And by the way that includes Canada's native non-white population the people that were here before Europeans came over
1171240	1176240	Absolutely, their culture should be preserved the same with the United States the same with any country
1176240	1181560	It's very obvious that that Muslim immigrants to Britain are not part of
1182120	1188360	Native British culture and that in Britain native British culture does have to at least be given
1188760	1190760	some type of precedent
1191560	1193560	Some type of consideration
1195240	1199820	So this idea that no you're not going to integrate that the
1200880	1204600	Natives of the area have to integrate into you. It's a ridiculous notion
1204880	1211160	There's no question that my hijab my skin color and my innate foreignness despite being born and raised in the UK
1211280	1214080	Is what got me put in lower sets?
1214600	1216000	Okay
1216000	1217440	No
1217440	1219440	No
1220160	1224520	This is this is another big problem with social justice is that they view
1225280	1228480	differences as one always being an
1229000	1236040	Instance of the greater versus the lesser and to always being a power struggle. You can definitely have
1236960	1243960	Separate but equal you can definitely have things that are different but still considered with the same amount of at least
1244320	1245840	cultural respect
1245840	1251040	instead of telling the foreigners to assimilate Britain you should take a long hard look at yourself because
1251600	1257840	Participation does not bring minorities acceptance in order to achieve harmony in Britain's multicultural landscape
1257840	1260760	It's not immigrants who need to integrate. It's the white majority
1260760	1262760	Majority
