00:00.000 --> 00:07.120
Hello, my friends welcome to SJ weekly today, I'm only drinking ice water

00:09.960 --> 00:13.080
Because it's actually quite warm out let's start with

00:14.120 --> 00:16.120
tor.com's

00:16.800 --> 00:18.800
problematic classics

00:18.880 --> 00:22.960
For questions to ask when beloved books haven't aged well

00:24.360 --> 00:29.800
Now we all know about the whole the whole huckleberry Finn situation, right?

00:30.600 --> 00:38.120
Where because the the word might have some some racialized terms that are no longer considered polite to say

00:38.640 --> 00:43.300
People want the book banned or or censored or rewritten

00:43.800 --> 00:49.040
which is obviously ridiculous because it was written in the time that it was written and

00:49.480 --> 00:51.240
That is what this article is all about

00:51.240 --> 00:58.580
I recently decided to reread th whites legendary classic the once and future King at first

00:58.620 --> 01:02.500
I was delighted by the exact book. I remembered but from my youth

01:03.060 --> 01:11.080
Wart young King Arthur being taught by Merlin goofy King Pelennor sullen Kay a lot of ridiculous adventures with some

01:11.460 --> 01:13.160
anti-war

01:13.160 --> 01:15.780
anti-totalitarian commentary mixed in for good measure as

01:16.740 --> 01:24.600
I continued I found some bits. I didn't remember I hadn't noticed the occasional asides about the base Indians

01:25.080 --> 01:30.680
White says archery was a serious business once before it was turned over to Indians and boys

01:31.380 --> 01:36.600
He talks about the destructive Indians who chased the settlers across the plains. I

01:37.820 --> 01:39.820
Did not feel good about this

01:40.260 --> 01:42.580
Well, I'm sure you didn't you know

01:43.240 --> 01:46.680
Running into a word that may be considered racist today

01:46.680 --> 01:50.040
But in the time the book was written was considered fine

01:50.040 --> 01:55.460
Maybe maybe the changing nature of language is something that you will have to

01:55.980 --> 02:01.920
You know come to grips with as an adult then I found the n-word. Oh, no

02:02.520 --> 02:10.400
Granted it was used by a bird and an unhinged one at that in a rant where the hawk blames the administration the politicians

02:10.400 --> 02:13.500
The Bolsheviks and so on for the state of the world

02:14.240 --> 02:19.060
Another character rebukes him for his comments though not for using the word specifically

02:20.060 --> 02:24.960
Later in the book Lancelot uses the same word to describe the Saracen Knight

02:25.820 --> 02:27.540
Palomides I

02:27.540 --> 02:33.120
Couldn't believe it not so much that the word was used but the fact that I didn't remember it. I

02:34.000 --> 02:35.180
mean

02:35.180 --> 02:38.740
You were a kid. You probably just brushed it off

02:38.780 --> 02:43.860
You probably thought you had stumbled on something that was cool and adult or something, right?

02:43.860 --> 02:45.140
And so you just kind of kept it to yourself

02:45.140 --> 02:49.660
I was equally shocked that I didn't remember the denigrating comments about Native Americans

02:49.820 --> 02:52.300
It left me feeling distressed about the book

02:52.300 --> 02:57.340
I had been trying to convince my teenage daughters to read it had that been a mistake

02:58.540 --> 03:00.700
Probably not, you know because

03:01.540 --> 03:03.540
consider this consider this

03:03.540 --> 03:08.980
you were presumably a teenager probably around the same age as your daughters when you read it and

03:09.540 --> 03:14.220
You obviously grew up fine or at the very least you grew into the type of

03:15.140 --> 03:23.260
Good obedient progressive that you want your daughters to be your exposure to the word Indian or the n-word

03:23.920 --> 03:31.660
Clearly didn't change what you later became. So if your goal is to raise your teenage daughters into good obedient progressives

03:32.420 --> 03:40.060
It's probably still gonna happen if they read this book most of us who love speculative fiction run into this problem at some point

03:40.380 --> 03:44.140
There are classics of the genre that are uncomfortable for various reasons

03:44.340 --> 03:49.580
Some of them are straight-out racist or unrepentantly misogynistic or homophobic or all of the above

03:49.860 --> 03:55.380
How and why and when we come to these realizations can change depending on who we are

03:55.380 --> 04:02.740
I'm guessing none of my african-american friends have come across the n-word in a novel and not noticed even as kids

04:03.220 --> 04:07.300
so this is the biggest problem that I have with this article is that

04:07.620 --> 04:10.140
It completely discounts the possibility

04:10.860 --> 04:15.180
that these works of fiction are racist or

04:15.940 --> 04:17.380
misogynistic or

04:17.380 --> 04:22.580
Homophobic for a point maybe they are those things in order to show why they're wrong

04:23.100 --> 04:27.860
maybe they are those things in order to be in support of

04:28.420 --> 04:34.080
Progressive or or social justice politics and I'm gonna read between the lines here a little bit. This is why I think

04:35.080 --> 04:37.080
Sjw's want to censor

04:38.760 --> 04:40.560
Everything for example

04:40.560 --> 04:46.880
We have this article here on PC gamer Nazi tattoos removed from survival game scum

04:47.520 --> 04:51.880
Developer apologizes the developer and studios to the tattoos inclusion was a mistake

04:52.320 --> 04:58.680
after an initial abrasive statement from a community manager now the point of the game is that

04:59.280 --> 05:05.640
You I think you play as a convict or someone who is who is in jail somehow and if you don't know what the prison system

05:06.120 --> 05:09.000
There are a lot of white supremacists in there

05:09.000 --> 05:16.000
There are a lot of legit Nazis who are going to get tattoos of like the the swastika or 1488

05:16.580 --> 05:22.960
Somewhere on their bodies. So to have a character that has Nazi tattoos on their bodies. It actually makes sense

05:22.960 --> 05:27.580
This doesn't mean that the developer is in support of Nazi ideology

05:27.620 --> 05:35.540
it means that the developer has created a character within the world that is in support of Nazi ideology and in this

05:35.540 --> 05:43.280
Case, it would make sense that this character would exist, but they're even censoring that now if you have

05:43.700 --> 05:45.700
say somebody who is

05:45.820 --> 05:47.820
you know politically

05:47.820 --> 05:51.140
unengaged or or uneducated or something and

05:52.980 --> 05:54.780
They're confronted with

05:54.820 --> 06:01.200
Two different points of view they they have like a Nazi on one side talking about the purity of the white race

06:01.200 --> 06:05.060
And then they have an SJW on the other side and the SJW is like no we have to have

06:05.340 --> 06:13.440
Complete equality for everyone no matter what and then let's say this uninformed idiot asked something like how come neo-nazis are bad

06:13.440 --> 06:19.840
How come the white supremacists are a bad group? You could show them a game like scum with a

06:20.520 --> 06:26.520
Shitty neo-nazi character in it show him what he acts like show him what he does and say

06:26.520 --> 06:29.600
This is a neo-nazi. That is the point of art

06:30.120 --> 06:36.240
Art does in some way reflect reality. It does have something to teach us about the real world

06:37.320 --> 06:42.200
But when SJW's censor art that are even in their position

06:43.000 --> 06:48.680
Art that would show their political opponents to be as bad as they are in real life

06:49.640 --> 06:52.140
That means that SJW's are simply saying

06:52.720 --> 06:56.100
You don't need to be taught why Nazis are bad

06:56.400 --> 06:59.800
You simply need to believe me when I tell you that they are bad

06:59.800 --> 07:04.440
And that's the problem with the Nazi tattoo being removed from the scum game

07:04.440 --> 07:07.720
And if we go back here that is the problem with this

07:08.480 --> 07:15.040
This four questions to ask when beloved books have an aged well article because the four questions in this article are is

07:15.760 --> 07:18.660
This a work I can continue to recommend to others

07:19.760 --> 07:22.640
well, just because it has

07:23.360 --> 07:28.920
Slurs in it that you didn't notice before it doesn't degrade the quality of the work. In fact, that may be the point of it

07:29.600 --> 07:34.280
But if you're an ideologue that is looking to indoctrinate people rather than teach them

07:34.360 --> 07:40.400
You might not want them to read it question two. Is this a work I can continue to enjoy privately

07:40.560 --> 07:44.040
The answer is honestly why not? This is where you get those people who?

07:44.640 --> 07:45.760
have

07:45.760 --> 07:51.880
kinks and and either engage in a certain type of sex or watch a certain type of porn and

07:52.120 --> 07:59.720
Yet they feel like they shouldn't because it's problematic. Their kink is problematic. You know, you might have like a

08:00.360 --> 08:05.480
Feminist woman who is extremely submissive in bed and she says I really like this but you know what?

08:05.480 --> 08:10.920
I I feel like I can't do it because I have to be a strong independent woman who don't need no man

08:11.040 --> 08:13.040
And that's that that's what this is

08:13.200 --> 08:19.680
you can obviously enjoy something privately that you would not recommend to everyone else and

08:21.280 --> 08:24.560
You don't even need to bring politics into that discussion to make that determination

08:25.440 --> 08:31.000
Question three. Is there another work that doesn't have these problems but occupies the same space

08:31.160 --> 08:34.240
this is where we get into the SJW tendency of

08:34.920 --> 08:36.920
replacing and co-opting

08:37.960 --> 08:40.360
pieces of art and and cannons

08:40.920 --> 08:42.920
and whole industries frankly

08:43.480 --> 08:47.560
You know, we saw this with Magic the Gathering we saw this with Vampire the Masquerade

08:48.240 --> 08:51.520
We saw this with all sorts of tabletop

08:52.640 --> 08:57.800
We saw this with Warhammer 40k. We see it with video games soon enough. You're probably gonna hear something like

08:58.360 --> 09:04.320
Why would you play Doom eternal or cuphead when there are these?

09:05.080 --> 09:09.680
SJW friendly alternatives in the same genre as those games and

09:10.120 --> 09:17.560
Question four. Can I create a work that is a corrective to the problematic work? I love this is where you get

09:17.880 --> 09:19.880
like the the Star Wars

09:20.560 --> 09:26.920
Situation where SJW's come into Star Wars and just completely overwrite everything and destroy it

09:26.960 --> 09:34.240
This is where you get the comics gate situation where SJW's roll into comics completely co-opt everything and destroy it

09:34.240 --> 09:39.440
These questions are basically how can I prevent the spread of work?

09:39.680 --> 09:41.560
that is problematic and

09:41.560 --> 09:43.000
How can I?

09:43.000 --> 09:48.760
Whitewash things to be in line with social justice and speaking of whitewashing the past

09:48.760 --> 09:56.200
Here's an archived tweet from Vox. You can draw a straight line from John McCain to Donald Trump through Sarah Palin

09:56.400 --> 10:02.800
This tweet was later deleted because it came just after John McCain had died, but it links to this article, which is still up

10:03.800 --> 10:07.520
John McCain Sarah Palin and the rise of reality TV politics

10:08.400 --> 10:13.640
McCain empowered a demagogue who put the Republican Party on them on the path to Donald Trump

10:13.640 --> 10:19.960
The party of Donald Trump began almost ten years ago to the day when John McCain tapped Sarah Palin to join his ticket

10:20.600 --> 10:23.320
It's one of the most important moments of McCain's career

10:23.480 --> 10:28.060
He proved willing to empower a demagogue when he thought doing so would improve his political fortunes

10:28.400 --> 10:35.400
Exactly the sin so many of his colleagues in the Republican Party have committed since Trump won their party's nomination and a lot of this

10:35.480 --> 10:41.840
Is just a general recap of the stupidity of Sarah Palin in the 2008 elections

10:42.440 --> 10:47.920
And I think we all know that at this point. However, what's interesting is that the article claims McCain

10:48.440 --> 10:50.440
Sacrificed his values to win

10:50.800 --> 10:53.880
McCain's campaign was in freefall at the end of August 2008

10:53.880 --> 10:59.480
He needed a Hail Mary the author of this article flew to Alaska the day after Palin was tapped

10:59.480 --> 11:04.160
He headed to the city's clerk office to pick up copies of meeting minutes from when she was mayor

11:04.160 --> 11:10.240
I assumed the McCain campaign had done the same but no as I wrote at the time

11:10.240 --> 11:15.960
I just got off the phone with a very helpful city clerk at the West Silla City Clerk's Office

11:16.480 --> 11:21.840
Christie Smithers who was pulling some documents for me from when governor Sarah Palin was mayor

11:21.840 --> 11:27.240
I told her I appreciated her help since I'm sure she's been bombarded with requests in the last few weeks

11:27.880 --> 11:33.720
The clerk's office keeps all city council meeting agendas minutes legislation ordinances, etc

11:34.240 --> 11:38.940
She chuckled then she told me that I'm the first person who has asked her office for anything

11:40.920 --> 11:47.960
McCain was prepared to put Palin a heartbeat away from the presidency without even checking if she could do the job

11:49.000 --> 11:52.680
Instead he picked her because she seemed like a good play to the base

11:53.360 --> 11:57.580
Now this is a very interesting line of thought and let's remember it for later

11:58.160 --> 12:00.680
Palin unleashed reality politics

12:01.280 --> 12:06.180
McCain and Palin lost but after the election Palin stayed in the limelight for a time

12:06.520 --> 12:08.960
She got a deal with Fox News and traveled the country

12:09.800 --> 12:12.160
endorsing and stumping for Tea Party candidates

12:12.600 --> 12:19.440
Schmidt who had pushed McCain to select Palin was depicted in the HBO version of the reported story of the 2008 campaign

12:19.660 --> 12:23.360
Game change as racked with guilt for his role in the decision

12:24.240 --> 12:27.840
This wasn't a campaign. It was a bad reality show he says

12:28.400 --> 12:35.000
Palin herself went on to sign an actual deal for a reality TV show and here's where we get back to Vox's tweet

12:35.000 --> 12:39.120
you can draw a straight line from John McCain to Donald Trump through Sarah Palin and

12:40.120 --> 12:41.720
Vox is right

12:41.720 --> 12:46.640
but not for the reason that they outline in this article in this article Vox makes the claim that

12:47.560 --> 12:54.760
John McCain legitimized Sarah Palin and Sarah Palin was basically just a doofy

12:55.320 --> 12:58.280
Made-up version of a reality TV star and

12:58.920 --> 13:05.360
Then her popularity allowed for an actual reality TV star Donald Trump to take the presidency

13:06.440 --> 13:14.000
That's not necessarily how it happened though because I am old enough to remember the 2008 elections with

13:14.660 --> 13:17.160
with a lot of clarity I remember

13:17.920 --> 13:19.840
very clearly I

13:19.840 --> 13:24.040
Remember John McCain that that whole very famous exchange where he was with a?

13:25.160 --> 13:28.480
Woman at a rally and she she's exclaimed

13:28.480 --> 13:35.600
I believe Obama's an Arab and what she meant by that was was a Muslim and and potentially a supporter of

13:36.680 --> 13:41.640
Radical Islam and McCain stole the microphone away and said no ma'am

13:42.400 --> 13:45.240
He's an honest family man that I have

13:46.240 --> 13:48.500
significant disagreements with on the issues

13:49.300 --> 13:54.380
But John McCain outright said that if Obama were to win

13:54.500 --> 13:59.140
he would not believe that Obama would take the country down the path of of

13:59.820 --> 14:04.260
Radical Islamist treason or something he just said that he disagreed with his politics

14:04.500 --> 14:11.620
But that he was ultimately a good guy and really that seemed to be the turning point of the election because Obama's

14:12.500 --> 14:19.380
Popularity had had had become so huge so great and the Republican base had seemed to go off the rails

14:19.420 --> 14:25.100
So much that when McCain had to step in and defend Obama from his own base

14:25.100 --> 14:30.100
It was it was done the election was over at that point, and that was the turning point however

14:30.100 --> 14:33.420
it was still the right thing to do it was still the honorable thing to do and

14:34.600 --> 14:39.980
Despite that the media still absolutely destroyed John McCain

14:40.020 --> 14:47.260
I remember this very clearly he was he was tired and feathered. He was slandered the far-left called him a

14:48.660 --> 14:53.940
Nazi and a tyrant and you know all the things that they called Donald Trump today

14:54.100 --> 14:58.780
Basically even as John McCain was acting reasonably and honorably

14:59.860 --> 15:04.540
The left took a giant shit on him, and then the same thing happened with Romney

15:05.220 --> 15:10.620
Romney acted very civilly even though he had obvious disagreements with Obama and

15:11.220 --> 15:16.860
The left still tired and feathered him like he was some kind of Satan spawn

15:16.860 --> 15:23.280
And he lost so when the third time comes around and Donald Trump is is now the Republican candidate

15:24.340 --> 15:28.020
He just said fuck it. I'm gonna get tired and feathered anyway

15:28.380 --> 15:36.180
So how about I do something that is worth being tired and feathered for and that's why we have Donald Trump as president because I

15:36.460 --> 15:43.060
Think everyone clued in over the course of the early 2000s everyone clued in to what the media does

15:43.740 --> 15:47.800
To right-wing candidates whether or not they deserve it

15:47.980 --> 15:53.580
They'll just completely shit on them act like that the Democrats have some kind of

15:53.980 --> 15:59.860
Inherent moral high ground which they don't and no matter how reasonable the person on the right acts

16:00.140 --> 16:06.020
They still just get a smear job ran against them. It just seems to be how it is and that's why we have Trump

16:06.020 --> 16:11.360
That's the line that you can draw between John McCain and Trump Vox. It doesn't go through Sarah Palin

16:11.860 --> 16:16.700
It it goes through the the left-wing bias of the media that has existed

16:17.100 --> 16:22.340
Since the Bush years frankly and if you want an example of that left-wing media bias

16:22.340 --> 16:24.340
Let's read this article

16:24.540 --> 16:27.660
immigrants don't need to integrate you do oh

16:32.220 --> 16:37.500
There's no such thing as integration for immigrants and their descendants

16:38.580 --> 16:44.900
Growing up in rural Britain Wales to be precise. I was the poster child for immigration. My teachers liked me

16:44.900 --> 16:51.920
I was a prefect I captained my team. I won ribbons on sports day attended high grades and did after-school activities

16:51.960 --> 16:55.200
I did everything they tell young brown kids to do

16:55.760 --> 17:02.880
It never occurred to me that I was the only one who considered myself just like everyone else. I'm sure that's not the case

17:05.000 --> 17:11.320
Once I was far enough away several years later somewhere between Cairo and Gaza after a Facebook exchange with an old classmate

17:11.760 --> 17:13.600
Who told me that he knows I'm a good person

17:13.600 --> 17:19.680
So I don't need to apologize for whatever it was that some Muslim had done a file opened in the back of my mind

17:20.560 --> 17:25.660
For months it began to fill with memories I'd shrugged off poo-pooed or not given a second thought to at the time

17:26.360 --> 17:32.960
like when I was 19 lying on a trolley in a hotel conference room in central Durham a needle in my arm and a

17:32.960 --> 17:36.680
Bag of my o-plus switching or somewhere around might near my hip. I

17:37.940 --> 17:42.720
Knew that donating blood made me act oddly that the gore of it made me giggle uncontrollably

17:42.720 --> 17:49.240
I tried to redirect my need to make a noise by babbling rolling my tongue ridiculously and popping my cheeks it helped

17:50.040 --> 17:52.640
The nurse walked up to me to check on my sack of blood. I

17:54.000 --> 17:56.380
Stole a look at it and it only made me babble more

17:57.040 --> 17:59.800
You're speaking in your language, aren't you?

18:00.600 --> 18:06.640
Because a nervous brown teenager prattling at the grossness of giving blood must of course be speaking her native language

18:07.140 --> 18:10.880
My language is English. Damn it. I'm sure this was traumatizing

18:11.200 --> 18:18.000
I'm absolutely sure this was just a harrowing experience for you, and I'm sorry that you had to deal with it

18:18.040 --> 18:21.800
Also, I just realized there's this comment some somehow up here and it says

18:23.800 --> 18:29.840
Integration an already problematic concept that should be abandoned in favor of acceptance. What?

18:30.980 --> 18:32.120
Okay

18:32.120 --> 18:34.120
There's a reason that

18:34.480 --> 18:40.020
Societies want integration. It's not because of racism. It's not because of any kind of

18:40.580 --> 18:42.880
racial or ethnic or religious hatred

18:43.440 --> 18:45.000
it's because

18:45.000 --> 18:47.000
societies have a

18:47.320 --> 18:52.560
Duty to promote social cohesion at least to a point certainly not over the rights of the individual

18:52.560 --> 18:57.740
but at least to a point and they have a duty to to continue the existence of

18:58.280 --> 19:00.280
the native culture of that society

19:01.000 --> 19:02.840
You know

19:02.840 --> 19:07.040
There is a native British culture. That is not

19:07.720 --> 19:09.720
British Islamic or

19:09.860 --> 19:16.000
British Chinese or British anything else, but just straight-up British and

19:16.720 --> 19:19.920
Britain has a responsibility to maintain that culture

19:20.400 --> 19:23.400
Canada has a responsibility to maintain its native culture

19:23.400 --> 19:30.760
And by the way that includes Canada's native non-white population the people that were here before Europeans came over

19:31.240 --> 19:36.240
Absolutely, their culture should be preserved the same with the United States the same with any country

19:36.240 --> 19:41.560
It's very obvious that that Muslim immigrants to Britain are not part of

19:42.120 --> 19:48.360
Native British culture and that in Britain native British culture does have to at least be given

19:48.760 --> 19:50.760
some type of precedent

19:51.560 --> 19:53.560
Some type of consideration

19:55.240 --> 19:59.820
So this idea that no you're not going to integrate that the

20:00.880 --> 20:04.600
Natives of the area have to integrate into you. It's a ridiculous notion

20:04.880 --> 20:11.160
There's no question that my hijab my skin color and my innate foreignness despite being born and raised in the UK

20:11.280 --> 20:14.080
Is what got me put in lower sets?

20:14.600 --> 20:16.000
Okay

20:16.000 --> 20:17.440
No

20:17.440 --> 20:19.440
No

20:20.160 --> 20:24.520
This is this is another big problem with social justice is that they view

20:25.280 --> 20:28.480
differences as one always being an

20:29.000 --> 20:36.040
Instance of the greater versus the lesser and to always being a power struggle. You can definitely have

20:36.960 --> 20:43.960
Separate but equal you can definitely have things that are different but still considered with the same amount of at least

20:44.320 --> 20:45.840
cultural respect

20:45.840 --> 20:51.040
instead of telling the foreigners to assimilate Britain you should take a long hard look at yourself because

20:51.600 --> 20:57.840
Participation does not bring minorities acceptance in order to achieve harmony in Britain's multicultural landscape

20:57.840 --> 21:00.760
It's not immigrants who need to integrate. It's the white majority

21:00.760 --> 21:02.760
Majority

21:02.760 --> 21:07.840
Until the majority stops treating people of color like a curiosity for their entertainment

21:08.200 --> 21:13.160
The country will be stuck in an existential crisis in which British children grow up as outsiders

21:14.200 --> 21:19.160
This is this is really interesting. Okay, because in this article

21:20.080 --> 21:25.680
Almost everything that she brings up has to do with not everything but almost everything

21:25.680 --> 21:29.160
She brings up has to do with her being a Muslim wearing a hijab

21:29.880 --> 21:32.920
Talking about her hair, which is obviously covered up in public view

21:33.680 --> 21:35.680
None of these things are racial

21:35.920 --> 21:37.640
You know if you were to take you know

21:37.640 --> 21:42.680
She says she's Iraqi Iraqi by heart British by upbringing if you were to take an an Iraqi girl

21:43.120 --> 21:46.360
who wasn't a Muslim or at least didn't wear a hijab and

21:47.040 --> 21:51.280
Raised her in Britain. She would likely just be straight-up accepted

21:51.960 --> 21:57.920
When you wear something like a hijab, it's it's almost like a social handshake

21:57.960 --> 22:05.280
It's you making a direct statement about who you are and the value system that you live your life by

22:05.920 --> 22:10.020
Because only a certain type of woman wears a hijab a Muslim woman

22:10.020 --> 22:15.240
it's very similar to a Christian wearing a very visible rosary that's also a statement and

22:16.000 --> 22:19.920
If you don't like what that statement says to other people

22:19.920 --> 22:22.720
Maybe you should not make that statement
