WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:10.000
All right, my friends, I'm making another short, quick video as filler because I actually

00:10.000 --> 00:15.320
am working on something quite big. So today, let's take a look at last week's slop gate.

00:15.320 --> 00:18.720
It started off with this tweet, a surprising amount of replies talk about Mexican food,

00:18.720 --> 00:19.720
which is hilarious.

00:19.720 --> 00:24.080
We are so good at putting slop on a tortilla. What do you say about that Frenchy is posting

00:24.080 --> 00:28.880
an L. Nobody outside the US or Mexico cares about Mexican food. You can add Canada to

00:28.880 --> 00:31.720
that, as much as we can be considered a different country than America, but you get the point.

00:31.720 --> 00:36.440
The reply came from this Bloomberg journal, The one thing that can unite America in this

00:36.440 --> 00:41.740
age of hyperpartisanship is dunking on bad food takes. And then my pal Sargon gave this

00:41.740 --> 00:47.720
counter reply, which is what went viral. Mexican food is absolutely atrocious though. The chilis

00:47.720 --> 00:52.800
are there to hide the taste of poor quality ingredients, not enhance the flavor. Listen,

00:52.800 --> 00:56.640
if you've been on Twitter for any length of time, you know that you can't be white, especially

00:56.640 --> 01:01.040
white British and insult the food of any other culture. Whether you're objectively correct

01:01.040 --> 01:06.380
or not, it doesn't matter. A united army of white cosmopolitan hipsters and brown immigrants

01:06.380 --> 01:10.020
will come out of the woodwork to talk about how unspiced your food is.

01:10.020 --> 01:13.740
Of course, Sargon knew this would happen, which is why he immediately posted the image

01:13.740 --> 01:18.560
of a snuggling Homer Simpson with the caption, me posting an opinion like this just before

01:18.560 --> 01:23.200
I go to sleep. He fully expected to wake up with millions of people raging at him, which

01:23.200 --> 01:28.000
he did. He's probably remembering the seasoning police fiasco, where a bunch of brown people

01:28.000 --> 01:32.580
shat on a white woman for not seasoning her chicken, when she replied that she put fresh

01:32.580 --> 01:37.300
vegetables in the roasting pan instead of dry herbs. Dry garlic and celery powder and

01:37.300 --> 01:41.640
pepper flakes, they're all fine, but you can't beat actually putting garlic and celery

01:41.640 --> 01:46.280
and pepper in the dish. She then called everyone shitting on her the seasoning police, which

01:46.280 --> 01:51.380
black progressives on TikTok immediately took as a racial slur. And then white identarians

01:51.380 --> 01:56.700
on Twitter immediately began using as a racial slur in reply. And the whole thing culminated

01:56.700 --> 02:00.380
with collages of black people washing their chicken with dish soap.

02:00.380 --> 02:04.820
But we've come back around to the spice conversation once again, and everyone replied to Sargon

02:04.820 --> 02:10.260
with the same tired repeated insults. British plus bad food plus bad teeth plus white plus

02:10.260 --> 02:14.660
racist plus L plus ratio. Here's one reply that I think really exemplifies the whole

02:14.660 --> 02:19.020
thing. Tell me you've never had Mexican food without telling me you've never had Mexican

02:19.020 --> 02:23.620
food. Posted along with a picture of a pan filled with shrimp, lime wedges, avocado slices,

02:23.620 --> 02:29.460
a ton of onions and peppers and other spices, all laid out on a bed of fried, sauced rice.

02:29.460 --> 02:33.180
Sargon called it an assault on the senses rather than a meal, when someone else chimed

02:33.180 --> 02:37.020
in with that common cope of, British people conquered the whole world for spices, they

02:37.020 --> 02:41.540
never used any of them. Sargon replied with, surely this just shows we've recognized

02:41.540 --> 02:45.980
the corrupting nature of spices and decided on the path of virtue. Have you considered

02:45.980 --> 02:50.660
that your taste buds have been so debauched that they're unable to detect quality? The

02:50.660 --> 02:54.820
American's palate is so abused by the food of the foreigner that he can't distinguish

02:54.820 --> 02:59.700
flavors outside of an extreme range. It is either blisteringly spicy or mind-numbingly

02:59.700 --> 03:03.180
sweet. He is the victim of Culinary Stockholm Syndrome.

03:03.180 --> 03:08.820
Now these takes are absolutely written for maximum troll effect, but Sargon does genuinely

03:08.820 --> 03:12.700
feel this way. Let's go back to that dish with the shrimps and limes and avocado. To

03:12.700 --> 03:16.140
be honest, I'd probably eat this and enjoy it, but I wouldn't want to have it every

03:16.140 --> 03:20.620
day. Sargon's right in that if a meal is extremely spicy, or hell, just fill with a

03:20.620 --> 03:24.780
dozen different contrasting flavors, it does get to be a bit numbing. It's kind of like

03:24.780 --> 03:28.980
the culinary version of the Jack Murphy thing, where he advertised himself as pushing the

03:28.980 --> 03:33.680
edge of masculine sexuality, which is why he had to resort to riding dildos and ruining

03:33.680 --> 03:38.020
his asshole and pimping out his wife to other dudes in order to try and get off. There's

03:38.020 --> 03:42.220
a generalized lesson about vice here. If you pursue what's pleasurable too much you become

03:42.260 --> 03:47.100
numb to it, and you have to go to even further extremes in order to satiate your appetites.

03:47.100 --> 03:50.940
This applies to sex, and it applies to food. By the way, I'm not some kind of wimp who

03:50.940 --> 03:54.580
can't handle spicy food myself. I enjoy spicy food, but I don't want to have it all the

03:54.580 --> 03:58.480
time. It's a nice treat once in a while, but you know what? I genuinely enjoy bland

03:58.480 --> 04:02.780
food just as much. Sometimes I'm actually just in the mood for toast with butter, or

04:02.780 --> 04:07.120
oatmeal, or plain old chicken noodle soup. Not everything has to be dipped in sweet chili

04:07.120 --> 04:11.340
heat Doritos powder or something. When you look at an English breakfast, yes, it's

04:11.340 --> 04:14.820
on the spice side, but it also looks really good. With the exception of the tomatoes,

04:14.820 --> 04:18.840
I don't really like tomatoes, I would eat everything here and enjoy it. I like my eggs

04:18.840 --> 04:23.300
and sausages with spices or sauces, but I also like them plain. Sometimes you actually

04:23.300 --> 04:28.100
want to taste the egg and the sausage, and not just the spice or the sauce, you know?

04:28.100 --> 04:32.940
Anyway, this whole thing went viral under the hashtag Slopgate, and now I have to explain

04:32.940 --> 04:38.120
to you the weird underlying meme. For a while now on 4chan, there's been a meme known

04:38.120 --> 04:43.880
as Goislop. Yes, it's antisemitic, but it's also funny as hell. The idea is, because

04:43.880 --> 04:48.420
the denizens of the pole board believe that the Jews control everything from the shadows,

04:48.420 --> 04:51.840
everything that is made for the common man to consume, whether that's food or entertainment

04:51.840 --> 04:57.660
or whatever, is Goislop. Slop refers to its low quality, and Goi refers to goyim, a Hebrew

04:57.660 --> 05:02.080
word for a non-Jew. Of course, they believe that this makes the consumers of the Goislop

05:02.080 --> 05:06.560
easy to control by the secret Jewish conspiracy that runs the world from behind the scenes.

05:06.560 --> 05:09.840
It's obviously a stupid premise, but it's still really funny, and the term got picked

05:09.840 --> 05:15.580
up outside of 4chan as a more generalized descriptor of low quality food. It still occasionally

05:15.580 --> 05:19.940
gets used in terms of movies or music or other pop culture things. For example, a recent

05:19.940 --> 05:25.800
variant is Todd Slop, referring to Todd Howard and the perceived low quality of Starfield,

05:25.800 --> 05:29.760
as well as the general Bethesda pattern of re-releasing the same game for the past 15

05:29.760 --> 05:34.560
years. But, for the most part, the Goislop meme now refers to exclusively low quality

05:34.560 --> 05:39.280
food. Also, in a lot of more recent uses, the Goi part has been dropped, rendering the

05:39.280 --> 05:44.040
meme just Slop now. Partially because people who aren't anti-Semitic want to use a more

05:44.040 --> 05:47.880
sanitized version of the joke for fun, and partially because legitimate anti-Semites

05:47.880 --> 05:53.120
want to go stealth. So, what actually is the Slop that Sargon's referring to? Academic

05:53.120 --> 05:57.520
Agent made a tweet that seems to exemplify it. Left equals order, right equals chaos,

05:57.520 --> 06:01.240
Slopgate! The left pitcher is of a sliced roast. The right pitcher looks like a lasagna

06:01.240 --> 06:05.200
or a casserole filled up to the brim with sauces and spices. Gonna be honest, they both

06:05.200 --> 06:09.200
look good to me. AA did the same thing as Sargon. He ramped the trolling up while still

06:09.200 --> 06:13.280
believing the underlying core message. The ingredients do not cohere. I can't even

06:13.280 --> 06:18.240
remember if it's chicken or pork. The beans are hard. Everything is leveled and undifferentiated.

06:18.240 --> 06:22.840
The spirit of the quesadilla is egalitarian and democratic. The melting pot made manifest.

06:22.840 --> 06:27.160
Okay, let me translate what's actually going on here. If you look at British food, or French

06:27.160 --> 06:30.980
or German, or even Japanese, you'll generally notice that the various foods in the meal

06:30.980 --> 06:34.460
are separate. If you want to have some of the meat on its own, or the vegetables, the

06:34.460 --> 06:37.940
potatoes, or the bread, you can. If you want to mix them together and enjoy them in one

06:37.940 --> 06:42.420
bite, you can. But the point is that each dish is its own thing, and if it's done correctly

06:42.420 --> 06:46.380
they're complementary. Compare that with Italian food, or Mexican food, or Indian food,

06:46.380 --> 06:50.300
where generally all of the various components of the meal are mixed together into one whole.

06:50.300 --> 06:54.700
The proteins, the carbs, the vegetables, are all cooked together and turned into one mass.

06:54.700 --> 06:59.460
This is the Slop. This type of cooking can be used to hide subpar ingredients by mixing

06:59.460 --> 07:04.380
them in with better stuff. Sauces and spices can also serve the same purpose. And historically,

07:04.380 --> 07:09.020
a lot of the cultures that produce Slop food today in this way tended to over-spice their

07:09.020 --> 07:12.820
meat regularly in order to try and prevent it from going bad, or so that they could stomach

07:12.820 --> 07:16.580
it if it actually was a little bit off. Now, there's some very good food that can

07:16.580 --> 07:20.940
come out of this culinary practice. Chinese and Vietnamese stir-fries are a great example

07:20.940 --> 07:24.820
of mixed mass food that is excellent. I'm also not saying that the British or the French

07:24.820 --> 07:29.140
or whoever else don't have their own Slop foods as well. If lasagna is a Slop food,

07:29.140 --> 07:33.420
and it most certainly is, then Shepherd's Pie is also a Slop food, especially after

07:33.420 --> 07:35.820
you've had a couple of bites and the whole thing goops up.

07:35.820 --> 07:40.540
When academic agent says the spirit of the quesadilla is egalitarian and democratic,

07:40.540 --> 07:45.680
he's comparing the more classless society of the United States to the Slop-like consistency

07:45.680 --> 07:51.500
of its food. Countries with more intact class systems like Britain, well they have undemocratic

07:51.500 --> 07:54.420
food. Things aren't all mixed together, they're separate, each part of the meal

07:54.420 --> 07:59.260
representing a unique complementary tier. But American culture is fundamentally base,

07:59.260 --> 08:03.680
with no social classes, no nobility. All of its food is Slop. All of its people are Slop.

08:03.680 --> 08:07.540
At least this is his view. However, what he views as negative, Americans

08:07.540 --> 08:12.780
tend to view as positive. In the mid-20th century, a concept came about called democratic

08:12.780 --> 08:17.220
culture. This didn't refer to voting or governance, but rather the idea that America

08:17.220 --> 08:22.560
was somehow a better place because the common man and the elite man had the same practices

08:22.560 --> 08:27.560
and preferences. That American culture was more democratic and therefore more united.

08:27.560 --> 08:32.440
Now this is at least somewhat true, and it is partially good. My video on meritocracy

08:32.440 --> 08:37.000
was all about how aligning the interests of the elites and the commoners through a shared

08:37.000 --> 08:42.520
culture is the best way to empower commoners. But this isn't universally good. The practices

08:42.520 --> 08:46.600
of the elites tend to have negative effects the commoners don't have the resources to

08:46.600 --> 08:49.520
manage, which is something I explained in my video on luxury beliefs.

08:49.560 --> 08:53.600
But nonetheless, having a more democratic culture is something Americans tend to pride

08:53.600 --> 08:58.080
themselves in, and that Europeans tend to look down upon Americans for. Moreover, at

08:58.080 --> 09:03.760
least some of academic agents' politics seems to be based in resentment of this Americanized

09:03.760 --> 09:08.880
democratic culture being imposed onto a more class-conscious Britain. This is why people

09:08.880 --> 09:13.320
of his political stripe were the first ones that I noticed to use terms like lizzofication

09:13.320 --> 09:17.960
to refer to this idea of American baseness versus European class, which I covered in

09:17.960 --> 09:22.200
my Lizzo video recently. Boy, I'm getting really good at those in-video advertisements,

09:22.200 --> 09:26.360
eh? What's really at the core of this is that a dumb food take went viral and people

09:26.360 --> 09:31.080
lost their minds yet again. Sargon very clearly prefers British food, and that's fine. For

09:31.080 --> 09:34.760
me personally, I like all of it. That's probably why I'm so fat. I can sit down and enjoy a

09:34.760 --> 09:38.680
roast with some vegetables and potatoes, or an English breakfast, or something like sushi,

09:38.680 --> 09:43.320
for example, all of these differentiated foods. I can also enjoy Mexican or Italian or Indian.

09:43.320 --> 09:47.880
I like spicy food, I like bland food, I like it all. My taste changes day to day. I'm not

09:47.880 --> 09:51.720
somebody whose face puckers the minute a bit of flavor is added, but I'm also not somebody

09:51.720 --> 09:56.200
who's burnt his tongue off so hard that a Carolina reaper tastes like novocaine. For me,

09:56.200 --> 10:00.360
the funniest thing about this is that it went viral at all. Imagine being so fucking weird

10:00.360 --> 10:04.120
and nosy that you have to police people for enjoying the food they like, even if you think

10:04.120 --> 10:08.840
that it's bland British food. Yeah, I know, Sargon kicked off Slopgate by insulting Mexican

10:08.840 --> 10:13.080
food first, but that's only after a decade or two of slop dominance on the internet.

10:13.080 --> 10:17.080
Listen, you know what? I'm coming out as a full food supremacist. We need to keep the

10:17.080 --> 10:21.880
different races of food separate, a different spot on the plate for every food. Close the borders,

10:21.880 --> 10:26.120
build the wall. Our precious white potatoes are going to turn into brown slop if we don't

10:26.120 --> 10:30.680
establish the edible no state. Yeah, that sounded better on paper.
