0	10000	All right, my friends, I'm making another short, quick video as filler because I actually
10000	15320	am working on something quite big. So today, let's take a look at last week's slop gate.
15320	18720	It started off with this tweet, a surprising amount of replies talk about Mexican food,
18720	19720	which is hilarious.
19720	24080	We are so good at putting slop on a tortilla. What do you say about that Frenchy is posting
24080	28880	an L. Nobody outside the US or Mexico cares about Mexican food. You can add Canada to
28880	31720	that, as much as we can be considered a different country than America, but you get the point.
31720	36440	The reply came from this Bloomberg journal, The one thing that can unite America in this
36440	41740	age of hyperpartisanship is dunking on bad food takes. And then my pal Sargon gave this
41740	47720	counter reply, which is what went viral. Mexican food is absolutely atrocious though. The chilis
47720	52800	are there to hide the taste of poor quality ingredients, not enhance the flavor. Listen,
52800	56640	if you've been on Twitter for any length of time, you know that you can't be white, especially
56640	61040	white British and insult the food of any other culture. Whether you're objectively correct
61040	66380	or not, it doesn't matter. A united army of white cosmopolitan hipsters and brown immigrants
66380	70020	will come out of the woodwork to talk about how unspiced your food is.
70020	73740	Of course, Sargon knew this would happen, which is why he immediately posted the image
73740	78560	of a snuggling Homer Simpson with the caption, me posting an opinion like this just before
78560	83200	I go to sleep. He fully expected to wake up with millions of people raging at him, which
83200	88000	he did. He's probably remembering the seasoning police fiasco, where a bunch of brown people
88000	92580	shat on a white woman for not seasoning her chicken, when she replied that she put fresh
92580	97300	vegetables in the roasting pan instead of dry herbs. Dry garlic and celery powder and
97300	101640	pepper flakes, they're all fine, but you can't beat actually putting garlic and celery
101640	106280	and pepper in the dish. She then called everyone shitting on her the seasoning police, which
106280	111380	black progressives on TikTok immediately took as a racial slur. And then white identarians
111380	116700	on Twitter immediately began using as a racial slur in reply. And the whole thing culminated
116700	120380	with collages of black people washing their chicken with dish soap.
120380	124820	But we've come back around to the spice conversation once again, and everyone replied to Sargon
124820	130260	with the same tired repeated insults. British plus bad food plus bad teeth plus white plus
130260	134660	racist plus L plus ratio. Here's one reply that I think really exemplifies the whole
134660	139020	thing. Tell me you've never had Mexican food without telling me you've never had Mexican
139020	143620	food. Posted along with a picture of a pan filled with shrimp, lime wedges, avocado slices,
143620	149460	a ton of onions and peppers and other spices, all laid out on a bed of fried, sauced rice.
149460	153180	Sargon called it an assault on the senses rather than a meal, when someone else chimed
153180	157020	in with that common cope of, British people conquered the whole world for spices, they
157020	161540	never used any of them. Sargon replied with, surely this just shows we've recognized
161540	165980	the corrupting nature of spices and decided on the path of virtue. Have you considered
165980	170660	that your taste buds have been so debauched that they're unable to detect quality? The
170660	174820	American's palate is so abused by the food of the foreigner that he can't distinguish
174820	179700	flavors outside of an extreme range. It is either blisteringly spicy or mind-numbingly
179700	183180	sweet. He is the victim of Culinary Stockholm Syndrome.
183180	188820	Now these takes are absolutely written for maximum troll effect, but Sargon does genuinely
188820	192700	feel this way. Let's go back to that dish with the shrimps and limes and avocado. To
192700	196140	be honest, I'd probably eat this and enjoy it, but I wouldn't want to have it every
196140	200620	day. Sargon's right in that if a meal is extremely spicy, or hell, just fill with a
200620	204780	dozen different contrasting flavors, it does get to be a bit numbing. It's kind of like
204780	208980	the culinary version of the Jack Murphy thing, where he advertised himself as pushing the
208980	213680	edge of masculine sexuality, which is why he had to resort to riding dildos and ruining
213680	218020	his asshole and pimping out his wife to other dudes in order to try and get off. There's
218020	222220	a generalized lesson about vice here. If you pursue what's pleasurable too much you become
222260	227100	numb to it, and you have to go to even further extremes in order to satiate your appetites.
227100	230940	This applies to sex, and it applies to food. By the way, I'm not some kind of wimp who
230940	234580	can't handle spicy food myself. I enjoy spicy food, but I don't want to have it all the
234580	238480	time. It's a nice treat once in a while, but you know what? I genuinely enjoy bland
238480	242780	food just as much. Sometimes I'm actually just in the mood for toast with butter, or
242780	247120	oatmeal, or plain old chicken noodle soup. Not everything has to be dipped in sweet chili
247120	251340	heat Doritos powder or something. When you look at an English breakfast, yes, it's
251340	254820	on the spice side, but it also looks really good. With the exception of the tomatoes,
254820	258840	I don't really like tomatoes, I would eat everything here and enjoy it. I like my eggs
258840	263300	and sausages with spices or sauces, but I also like them plain. Sometimes you actually
263300	268100	want to taste the egg and the sausage, and not just the spice or the sauce, you know?
268100	272940	Anyway, this whole thing went viral under the hashtag Slopgate, and now I have to explain
272940	278120	to you the weird underlying meme. For a while now on 4chan, there's been a meme known
278120	283880	as Goislop. Yes, it's antisemitic, but it's also funny as hell. The idea is, because
283880	288420	the denizens of the pole board believe that the Jews control everything from the shadows,
288420	291840	everything that is made for the common man to consume, whether that's food or entertainment
291840	297660	or whatever, is Goislop. Slop refers to its low quality, and Goi refers to goyim, a Hebrew
297660	302080	word for a non-Jew. Of course, they believe that this makes the consumers of the Goislop
302080	306560	easy to control by the secret Jewish conspiracy that runs the world from behind the scenes.
306560	309840	It's obviously a stupid premise, but it's still really funny, and the term got picked
309840	315580	up outside of 4chan as a more generalized descriptor of low quality food. It still occasionally
315580	319940	gets used in terms of movies or music or other pop culture things. For example, a recent
319940	325800	variant is Todd Slop, referring to Todd Howard and the perceived low quality of Starfield,
325800	329760	as well as the general Bethesda pattern of re-releasing the same game for the past 15
329760	334560	years. But, for the most part, the Goislop meme now refers to exclusively low quality
334560	339280	food. Also, in a lot of more recent uses, the Goi part has been dropped, rendering the
339280	344040	meme just Slop now. Partially because people who aren't anti-Semitic want to use a more
344040	347880	sanitized version of the joke for fun, and partially because legitimate anti-Semites
347880	353120	want to go stealth. So, what actually is the Slop that Sargon's referring to? Academic
353120	357520	Agent made a tweet that seems to exemplify it. Left equals order, right equals chaos,
357520	361240	Slopgate! The left pitcher is of a sliced roast. The right pitcher looks like a lasagna
361240	365200	or a casserole filled up to the brim with sauces and spices. Gonna be honest, they both
365200	369200	look good to me. AA did the same thing as Sargon. He ramped the trolling up while still
369200	373280	believing the underlying core message. The ingredients do not cohere. I can't even
373280	378240	remember if it's chicken or pork. The beans are hard. Everything is leveled and undifferentiated.
378240	382840	The spirit of the quesadilla is egalitarian and democratic. The melting pot made manifest.
382840	387160	Okay, let me translate what's actually going on here. If you look at British food, or French
387160	390980	or German, or even Japanese, you'll generally notice that the various foods in the meal
390980	394460	are separate. If you want to have some of the meat on its own, or the vegetables, the
394460	397940	potatoes, or the bread, you can. If you want to mix them together and enjoy them in one
397940	402420	bite, you can. But the point is that each dish is its own thing, and if it's done correctly
402420	406380	they're complementary. Compare that with Italian food, or Mexican food, or Indian food,
406380	410300	where generally all of the various components of the meal are mixed together into one whole.
410300	414700	The proteins, the carbs, the vegetables, are all cooked together and turned into one mass.
414700	419460	This is the Slop. This type of cooking can be used to hide subpar ingredients by mixing
419460	424380	them in with better stuff. Sauces and spices can also serve the same purpose. And historically,
424380	429020	a lot of the cultures that produce Slop food today in this way tended to over-spice their
429020	432820	meat regularly in order to try and prevent it from going bad, or so that they could stomach
432820	436580	it if it actually was a little bit off. Now, there's some very good food that can
436580	440940	come out of this culinary practice. Chinese and Vietnamese stir-fries are a great example
440940	444820	of mixed mass food that is excellent. I'm also not saying that the British or the French
444820	449140	or whoever else don't have their own Slop foods as well. If lasagna is a Slop food,
449140	453420	and it most certainly is, then Shepherd's Pie is also a Slop food, especially after
453420	455820	you've had a couple of bites and the whole thing goops up.
455820	460540	When academic agent says the spirit of the quesadilla is egalitarian and democratic,
460540	465680	he's comparing the more classless society of the United States to the Slop-like consistency
465680	471500	of its food. Countries with more intact class systems like Britain, well they have undemocratic
471500	474420	food. Things aren't all mixed together, they're separate, each part of the meal
474420	479260	representing a unique complementary tier. But American culture is fundamentally base,
479260	483680	with no social classes, no nobility. All of its food is Slop. All of its people are Slop.
483680	487540	At least this is his view. However, what he views as negative, Americans
487540	492780	tend to view as positive. In the mid-20th century, a concept came about called democratic
492780	497220	culture. This didn't refer to voting or governance, but rather the idea that America
497220	502560	was somehow a better place because the common man and the elite man had the same practices
502560	507560	and preferences. That American culture was more democratic and therefore more united.
507560	512440	Now this is at least somewhat true, and it is partially good. My video on meritocracy
512440	517000	was all about how aligning the interests of the elites and the commoners through a shared
517000	522520	culture is the best way to empower commoners. But this isn't universally good. The practices
522520	526600	of the elites tend to have negative effects the commoners don't have the resources to
526600	529520	manage, which is something I explained in my video on luxury beliefs.
529560	533600	But nonetheless, having a more democratic culture is something Americans tend to pride
533600	538080	themselves in, and that Europeans tend to look down upon Americans for. Moreover, at
538080	543760	least some of academic agents' politics seems to be based in resentment of this Americanized
543760	548880	democratic culture being imposed onto a more class-conscious Britain. This is why people
548880	553320	of his political stripe were the first ones that I noticed to use terms like lizzofication
553320	557960	to refer to this idea of American baseness versus European class, which I covered in
557960	562200	my Lizzo video recently. Boy, I'm getting really good at those in-video advertisements,
562200	566360	eh? What's really at the core of this is that a dumb food take went viral and people
566360	571080	lost their minds yet again. Sargon very clearly prefers British food, and that's fine. For
571080	574760	me personally, I like all of it. That's probably why I'm so fat. I can sit down and enjoy a
574760	578680	roast with some vegetables and potatoes, or an English breakfast, or something like sushi,
578680	583320	for example, all of these differentiated foods. I can also enjoy Mexican or Italian or Indian.
583320	587880	I like spicy food, I like bland food, I like it all. My taste changes day to day. I'm not
587880	591720	somebody whose face puckers the minute a bit of flavor is added, but I'm also not somebody
591720	596200	who's burnt his tongue off so hard that a Carolina reaper tastes like novocaine. For me,
596200	600360	the funniest thing about this is that it went viral at all. Imagine being so fucking weird
600360	604120	and nosy that you have to police people for enjoying the food they like, even if you think
604120	608840	that it's bland British food. Yeah, I know, Sargon kicked off Slopgate by insulting Mexican
608840	613080	food first, but that's only after a decade or two of slop dominance on the internet.
613080	617080	Listen, you know what? I'm coming out as a full food supremacist. We need to keep the
617080	621880	different races of food separate, a different spot on the plate for every food. Close the borders,
621880	626120	build the wall. Our precious white potatoes are going to turn into brown slop if we don't
626120	630680	establish the edible no state. Yeah, that sounded better on paper.
