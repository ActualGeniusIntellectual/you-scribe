00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
All right, my friends, I'm making another short, quick video as filler because I actually

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,320
am working on something quite big. So today, let's take a look at last week's slop gate.

3
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:18,720
It started off with this tweet, a surprising amount of replies talk about Mexican food,

4
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:19,720
which is hilarious.

5
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:24,080
We are so good at putting slop on a tortilla. What do you say about that Frenchy is posting

6
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:28,880
an L. Nobody outside the US or Mexico cares about Mexican food. You can add Canada to

7
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:31,720
that, as much as we can be considered a different country than America, but you get the point.

8
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:36,440
The reply came from this Bloomberg journal, The one thing that can unite America in this

9
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:41,740
age of hyperpartisanship is dunking on bad food takes. And then my pal Sargon gave this

10
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:47,720
counter reply, which is what went viral. Mexican food is absolutely atrocious though. The chilis

11
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:52,800
are there to hide the taste of poor quality ingredients, not enhance the flavor. Listen,

12
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:56,640
if you've been on Twitter for any length of time, you know that you can't be white, especially

13
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:01,040
white British and insult the food of any other culture. Whether you're objectively correct

14
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:06,380
or not, it doesn't matter. A united army of white cosmopolitan hipsters and brown immigrants

15
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:10,020
will come out of the woodwork to talk about how unspiced your food is.

16
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:13,740
Of course, Sargon knew this would happen, which is why he immediately posted the image

17
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:18,560
of a snuggling Homer Simpson with the caption, me posting an opinion like this just before

18
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:23,200
I go to sleep. He fully expected to wake up with millions of people raging at him, which

19
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:28,000
he did. He's probably remembering the seasoning police fiasco, where a bunch of brown people

20
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,580
shat on a white woman for not seasoning her chicken, when she replied that she put fresh

21
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:37,300
vegetables in the roasting pan instead of dry herbs. Dry garlic and celery powder and

22
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:41,640
pepper flakes, they're all fine, but you can't beat actually putting garlic and celery

23
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:46,280
and pepper in the dish. She then called everyone shitting on her the seasoning police, which

24
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:51,380
black progressives on TikTok immediately took as a racial slur. And then white identarians

25
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:56,700
on Twitter immediately began using as a racial slur in reply. And the whole thing culminated

26
00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:00,380
with collages of black people washing their chicken with dish soap.

27
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:04,820
But we've come back around to the spice conversation once again, and everyone replied to Sargon

28
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:10,260
with the same tired repeated insults. British plus bad food plus bad teeth plus white plus

29
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:14,660
racist plus L plus ratio. Here's one reply that I think really exemplifies the whole

30
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:19,020
thing. Tell me you've never had Mexican food without telling me you've never had Mexican

31
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:23,620
food. Posted along with a picture of a pan filled with shrimp, lime wedges, avocado slices,

32
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:29,460
a ton of onions and peppers and other spices, all laid out on a bed of fried, sauced rice.

33
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:33,180
Sargon called it an assault on the senses rather than a meal, when someone else chimed

34
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:37,020
in with that common cope of, British people conquered the whole world for spices, they

35
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:41,540
never used any of them. Sargon replied with, surely this just shows we've recognized

36
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:45,980
the corrupting nature of spices and decided on the path of virtue. Have you considered

37
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:50,660
that your taste buds have been so debauched that they're unable to detect quality? The

38
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:54,820
American's palate is so abused by the food of the foreigner that he can't distinguish

39
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:59,700
flavors outside of an extreme range. It is either blisteringly spicy or mind-numbingly

40
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:03,180
sweet. He is the victim of Culinary Stockholm Syndrome.

41
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:08,820
Now these takes are absolutely written for maximum troll effect, but Sargon does genuinely

42
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:12,700
feel this way. Let's go back to that dish with the shrimps and limes and avocado. To

43
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:16,140
be honest, I'd probably eat this and enjoy it, but I wouldn't want to have it every

44
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:20,620
day. Sargon's right in that if a meal is extremely spicy, or hell, just fill with a

45
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:24,780
dozen different contrasting flavors, it does get to be a bit numbing. It's kind of like

46
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:28,980
the culinary version of the Jack Murphy thing, where he advertised himself as pushing the

47
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:33,680
edge of masculine sexuality, which is why he had to resort to riding dildos and ruining

48
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:38,020
his asshole and pimping out his wife to other dudes in order to try and get off. There's

49
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:42,220
a generalized lesson about vice here. If you pursue what's pleasurable too much you become

50
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:47,100
numb to it, and you have to go to even further extremes in order to satiate your appetites.

51
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:50,940
This applies to sex, and it applies to food. By the way, I'm not some kind of wimp who

52
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:54,580
can't handle spicy food myself. I enjoy spicy food, but I don't want to have it all the

53
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:58,480
time. It's a nice treat once in a while, but you know what? I genuinely enjoy bland

54
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:02,780
food just as much. Sometimes I'm actually just in the mood for toast with butter, or

55
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:07,120
oatmeal, or plain old chicken noodle soup. Not everything has to be dipped in sweet chili

56
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:11,340
heat Doritos powder or something. When you look at an English breakfast, yes, it's

57
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:14,820
on the spice side, but it also looks really good. With the exception of the tomatoes,

58
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:18,840
I don't really like tomatoes, I would eat everything here and enjoy it. I like my eggs

59
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:23,300
and sausages with spices or sauces, but I also like them plain. Sometimes you actually

60
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:28,100
want to taste the egg and the sausage, and not just the spice or the sauce, you know?

61
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:32,940
Anyway, this whole thing went viral under the hashtag Slopgate, and now I have to explain

62
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:38,120
to you the weird underlying meme. For a while now on 4chan, there's been a meme known

63
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:43,880
as Goislop. Yes, it's antisemitic, but it's also funny as hell. The idea is, because

64
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:48,420
the denizens of the pole board believe that the Jews control everything from the shadows,

65
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:51,840
everything that is made for the common man to consume, whether that's food or entertainment

66
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:57,660
or whatever, is Goislop. Slop refers to its low quality, and Goi refers to goyim, a Hebrew

67
00:04:57,660 --> 00:05:02,080
word for a non-Jew. Of course, they believe that this makes the consumers of the Goislop

68
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:06,560
easy to control by the secret Jewish conspiracy that runs the world from behind the scenes.

69
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:09,840
It's obviously a stupid premise, but it's still really funny, and the term got picked

70
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:15,580
up outside of 4chan as a more generalized descriptor of low quality food. It still occasionally

71
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:19,940
gets used in terms of movies or music or other pop culture things. For example, a recent

72
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:25,800
variant is Todd Slop, referring to Todd Howard and the perceived low quality of Starfield,

73
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:29,760
as well as the general Bethesda pattern of re-releasing the same game for the past 15

74
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:34,560
years. But, for the most part, the Goislop meme now refers to exclusively low quality

75
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:39,280
food. Also, in a lot of more recent uses, the Goi part has been dropped, rendering the

76
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:44,040
meme just Slop now. Partially because people who aren't anti-Semitic want to use a more

77
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:47,880
sanitized version of the joke for fun, and partially because legitimate anti-Semites

78
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:53,120
want to go stealth. So, what actually is the Slop that Sargon's referring to? Academic

79
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:57,520
Agent made a tweet that seems to exemplify it. Left equals order, right equals chaos,

80
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:01,240
Slopgate! The left pitcher is of a sliced roast. The right pitcher looks like a lasagna

81
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:05,200
or a casserole filled up to the brim with sauces and spices. Gonna be honest, they both

82
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:09,200
look good to me. AA did the same thing as Sargon. He ramped the trolling up while still

83
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:13,280
believing the underlying core message. The ingredients do not cohere. I can't even

84
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:18,240
remember if it's chicken or pork. The beans are hard. Everything is leveled and undifferentiated.

85
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:22,840
The spirit of the quesadilla is egalitarian and democratic. The melting pot made manifest.

86
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:27,160
Okay, let me translate what's actually going on here. If you look at British food, or French

87
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:30,980
or German, or even Japanese, you'll generally notice that the various foods in the meal

88
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:34,460
are separate. If you want to have some of the meat on its own, or the vegetables, the

89
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:37,940
potatoes, or the bread, you can. If you want to mix them together and enjoy them in one

90
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:42,420
bite, you can. But the point is that each dish is its own thing, and if it's done correctly

91
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:46,380
they're complementary. Compare that with Italian food, or Mexican food, or Indian food,

92
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:50,300
where generally all of the various components of the meal are mixed together into one whole.

93
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:54,700
The proteins, the carbs, the vegetables, are all cooked together and turned into one mass.

94
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:59,460
This is the Slop. This type of cooking can be used to hide subpar ingredients by mixing

95
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:04,380
them in with better stuff. Sauces and spices can also serve the same purpose. And historically,

96
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:09,020
a lot of the cultures that produce Slop food today in this way tended to over-spice their

97
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:12,820
meat regularly in order to try and prevent it from going bad, or so that they could stomach

98
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:16,580
it if it actually was a little bit off. Now, there's some very good food that can

99
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:20,940
come out of this culinary practice. Chinese and Vietnamese stir-fries are a great example

100
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:24,820
of mixed mass food that is excellent. I'm also not saying that the British or the French

101
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:29,140
or whoever else don't have their own Slop foods as well. If lasagna is a Slop food,

102
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:33,420
and it most certainly is, then Shepherd's Pie is also a Slop food, especially after

103
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:35,820
you've had a couple of bites and the whole thing goops up.

104
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:40,540
When academic agent says the spirit of the quesadilla is egalitarian and democratic,

105
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:45,680
he's comparing the more classless society of the United States to the Slop-like consistency

106
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:51,500
of its food. Countries with more intact class systems like Britain, well they have undemocratic

107
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:54,420
food. Things aren't all mixed together, they're separate, each part of the meal

108
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:59,260
representing a unique complementary tier. But American culture is fundamentally base,

109
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:03,680
with no social classes, no nobility. All of its food is Slop. All of its people are Slop.

110
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:07,540
At least this is his view. However, what he views as negative, Americans

111
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:12,780
tend to view as positive. In the mid-20th century, a concept came about called democratic

112
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:17,220
culture. This didn't refer to voting or governance, but rather the idea that America

113
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:22,560
was somehow a better place because the common man and the elite man had the same practices

114
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:27,560
and preferences. That American culture was more democratic and therefore more united.

115
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:32,440
Now this is at least somewhat true, and it is partially good. My video on meritocracy

116
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:37,000
was all about how aligning the interests of the elites and the commoners through a shared

117
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:42,520
culture is the best way to empower commoners. But this isn't universally good. The practices

118
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:46,600
of the elites tend to have negative effects the commoners don't have the resources to

119
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:49,520
manage, which is something I explained in my video on luxury beliefs.

120
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:53,600
But nonetheless, having a more democratic culture is something Americans tend to pride

121
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:58,080
themselves in, and that Europeans tend to look down upon Americans for. Moreover, at

122
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:03,760
least some of academic agents' politics seems to be based in resentment of this Americanized

123
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:08,880
democratic culture being imposed onto a more class-conscious Britain. This is why people

124
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:13,320
of his political stripe were the first ones that I noticed to use terms like lizzofication

125
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:17,960
to refer to this idea of American baseness versus European class, which I covered in

126
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:22,200
my Lizzo video recently. Boy, I'm getting really good at those in-video advertisements,

127
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:26,360
eh? What's really at the core of this is that a dumb food take went viral and people

128
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:31,080
lost their minds yet again. Sargon very clearly prefers British food, and that's fine. For

129
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:34,760
me personally, I like all of it. That's probably why I'm so fat. I can sit down and enjoy a

130
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:38,680
roast with some vegetables and potatoes, or an English breakfast, or something like sushi,

131
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:43,320
for example, all of these differentiated foods. I can also enjoy Mexican or Italian or Indian.

132
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:47,880
I like spicy food, I like bland food, I like it all. My taste changes day to day. I'm not

133
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:51,720
somebody whose face puckers the minute a bit of flavor is added, but I'm also not somebody

134
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:56,200
who's burnt his tongue off so hard that a Carolina reaper tastes like novocaine. For me,

135
00:09:56,200 --> 00:10:00,360
the funniest thing about this is that it went viral at all. Imagine being so fucking weird

136
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:04,120
and nosy that you have to police people for enjoying the food they like, even if you think

137
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:08,840
that it's bland British food. Yeah, I know, Sargon kicked off Slopgate by insulting Mexican

138
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:13,080
food first, but that's only after a decade or two of slop dominance on the internet.

139
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:17,080
Listen, you know what? I'm coming out as a full food supremacist. We need to keep the

140
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:21,880
different races of food separate, a different spot on the plate for every food. Close the borders,

141
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:26,120
build the wall. Our precious white potatoes are going to turn into brown slop if we don't

142
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:30,680
establish the edible no state. Yeah, that sounded better on paper.
