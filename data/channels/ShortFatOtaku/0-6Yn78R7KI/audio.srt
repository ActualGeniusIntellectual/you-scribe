1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,440
When I was putting the finishing touches on the Charlottesville video, the Boston rally

2
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:04,780
started going down.

3
00:00:04,780 --> 00:00:08,300
And my initial reaction was, I've got to do something on this.

4
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:11,400
And then shortly after, the Phoenix rally thing happened.

5
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:13,840
And then the Barcelona terror attack went down too.

6
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:14,840
And then the Charleston shooting.

7
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:17,120
And then the Buckingham Palace sword attack.

8
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:20,280
And then the media shat itself to Trump's response to Hurricane Matthew.

9
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:21,880
Holy shit, it's hard to keep up.

10
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:25,920
I could do a play-by-play of each event, if people really wanted me to.

11
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,160
Like I did with Charlottesville.

12
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:29,820
Show the big happenings, analyze them, give my take.

13
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:33,240
But frankly, there's a lot of people out there that have done so already, with varying

14
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:34,740
degrees of competency.

15
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:37,420
Ranging from far better than me to far worse.

16
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:40,060
I think there's something bigger here that we have to discuss though.

17
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:43,180
Something that links all these seemingly disparate events together.

18
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:47,100
I'll still do some analysis, but I want to discuss the big picture for a minute.

19
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:49,420
Let's talk about the theory of Howland's Spheres.

20
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:54,200
Daniel Howland, in his book The Uncensored War, devised a theory that divides all political

21
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:56,340
discourse into three concentric circles.

22
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:59,940
The inner circle, known as the sphere of consensus, contains all knowledge in which

23
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:03,800
there is widespread agreement, or at least the perception of widespread agreement.

24
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:07,660
Within this first sphere, journalists feel free to invoke a generalized we when discussing

25
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:11,200
their points of view, and often take for granted shared values and assumptions.

26
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:15,300
The middle circle, known as the sphere of controversy, is where rational and informed

27
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:17,580
people regularly hold differing views on a topic.

28
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:21,380
To an ethical journalist, these topics are therefore the most important to cover, and

29
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:24,340
also the most important to remain unbiased about in their coverage.

30
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:27,660
In order to present an objective as possible view of the situation to the public.

31
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:32,500
The outer circle, known as the sphere of deviance, is basically the place where bad stories go

32
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:33,500
to die.

33
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:36,820
This is the realm of topics that journalists generally do not discuss at all, either because

34
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:41,340
they are obviously false or unfounded, they're taboo, or they're so insignificant that

35
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:42,660
they're simply not newsworthy.

36
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:47,840
If these topics ever are discussed, they're specifically framed as ridiculous, dangerous,

37
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,380
or in some other way, marginal.

38
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:53,340
Here's a simplistic example of the spheres in action, and I'll use the Nazis because

39
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:56,140
they're going to be coming up in this video more than a few times.

40
00:01:56,140 --> 00:02:00,060
The claim, Nazis are bad, directly falls within the sphere of consensus.

41
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:04,700
The majority of people agree that Nazis are in fact bad, to the point that you don't

42
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:08,680
really need to explain why they're bad anymore when writing an article on Nazis.

43
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:13,860
To contrast, the phrase, Hitler did nothing wrong, and no I don't mean the meme you

44
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:18,220
see everywhere on the internet, I mean an actual serious interpretation of that phrase,

45
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:19,860
belongs within the sphere of deviance.

46
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:24,640
You're very rarely going to see this interpretation of Hitler in the media, and when you do, it's

47
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:29,660
going to be used to showcase the danger or insanity of a subject on the fringes of society.

48
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:35,300
Meanwhile, a hypothetical article titled, say, Neo-Nazis hold Unite the Right rally

49
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:38,220
in Charlottesville, sits within the sphere of controversy.

50
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:42,220
The title itself invokes the Nazis are bad assumption from the sphere of consensus, and

51
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:46,100
this invocation implies that the article will not be taking the stance that Hitler did nothing

52
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:48,420
wrong from the sphere of deviance.

53
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:52,620
Basically, the outer circle consists of topics that must never be discussed, and the inner

54
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:57,220
circle consists of topics that can be discussed but rarely are, simply because they're considered

55
00:02:57,220 --> 00:02:58,220
to be common sense.

56
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:00,260
Now, why am I bringing all this up?

57
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:04,300
Because Hellen's spheres accurately represents the way in which journalists see the world,

58
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:08,420
and as the individual journalists or even specific outlets and organizations change,

59
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:10,920
the contents of the three spheres also change.

60
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:15,860
For example, where left-wing outlets like Salon or Vice or whatever are more than willing

61
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:20,660
to blanket every single attendee of Unite the Right as a neo-nazi, a right-wing outlet

62
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:25,600
like, say, Fox News, may be more willing to call them alt-right instead of neo-nazi, or

63
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:29,660
mention that multiple different factions of people, some with very different sets of goals

64
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:32,600
and visions, all attended Unite the Right.

65
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:38,060
So the statement, not everybody at Unite the Right was a neo-nazi, sits cleanly within

66
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:41,980
the sphere of deviance for left-leaning publications and journalists, but is actually within the

67
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:46,300
sphere of controversy for centrist and right-leaning publications and journalists.

68
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:49,020
Keep this idea in mind, we'll be coming back to it a bit later.

69
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:51,940
Let's check out what the Boston rally actually was.

70
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:54,980
Thousands march in Boston in protest of controversial rally.

71
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:59,160
Thousands of counter-demonstrators march Sunday in downtown Boston in a largely peaceful response

72
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:03,300
to a self-described free speech rally that had sparked concerns of possible violence.

73
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:07,620
It's clear today that Boston stood for peace and love, not bigotry and hate, the Boston

74
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:08,620
mayor said.

75
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:12,380
On the embedded video in this CNN article, the news ticker reads,

76
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:16,280
Tense scenes erupt in Boston as thousands march against hate.

77
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:17,820
And the crowd was very large.

78
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:19,940
ABC caught an aerial view of these counter-protesters.

79
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:22,900
And it looks like thousands of them are flooding the streets.

80
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:25,480
But let's try and get some footage shot by people on the ground, I'm sure we can dig

81
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:26,480
some up.

82
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:31,540
Evan McMurry, working for ABC, got ahold of an enlightening video shot by a drone regarding

83
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:32,640
the crowd size.

84
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:36,340
He says, this is the first video I've seen that really shows the disparity between the

85
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:40,540
quote, free speech rally, and the thousands of counter-demonstrators.

86
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:44,940
It doesn't sound like he's taking a neutral opinion on this one, guys.

87
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:46,340
Why do you think that could be?

88
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:50,500
At least, in the video, we can see that the Boston police actually set up barricades,

89
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:54,000
preventing the counter-protesters from approaching the park's rotunda, where a gathering of

90
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:59,760
what was estimated to be about 30 people showed up to protest such hateful topics as Massantos

91
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:04,900
genetically modified food, black lives actually mattering, and the views of a local candidate

92
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:07,920
running for office using the hashtag, shiva4senate.

93
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:13,340
That shiva guy, by the way, is Dr. Shiva Ayadurai, and he uploaded his speech at the Boston Free

94
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:15,260
Speech Rally to his YouTube channel.

95
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:16,260
Here's a few choice bits.

96
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:17,260
They tried to stop us today, didn't they?

97
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:18,260
But, you know, we weren't cowed down.

98
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:28,260
And I will always stand up for all of you, and all of us here, in many ways, are true

99
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:29,260
patriots.

100
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:33,340
Because we, in spite of that noise out there, we're here to stand up for something very

101
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:35,820
fundamental, which is called free speech.

102
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:40,340
And let me tell you that they tried to prevent me from coming here, as you may have heard

103
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:41,340
in the media.

104
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:46,300
They asked me why I associated myself with all of you guys, even though they have no

105
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:48,580
idea who you or we are.

106
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:50,580
Let me remind you about Joe Biden.

107
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:55,860
He's a guy who said Obama, which many of those people support, is the first clean, quote

108
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:58,300
unquote clean and articulate black man.

109
00:05:58,300 --> 00:05:59,300
He's a racist.

110
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:01,580
But no one asked about that, did they?

111
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:06,220
Hillary Clinton stereotyped and mocked my people, Indians.

112
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:11,340
You can go see the YouTube video, in a very offensive manner, just go look at it.

113
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:14,300
She mocked Mahatma Gandhi, who's one of the icons of Indians.

114
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:18,780
You see, you won't find a lot of Indians like me here, because my parents were considered

115
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:19,780
low caste.

116
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:23,700
Lower caste than most of those people out there, who don't even know what it means to

117
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:24,700
be that.

118
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:28,980
The establishment is what's infested with racists, not us.

119
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:30,620
I don't see any racists here.

120
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:33,380
Yeah, this guy just seems like a fucking Nazi, doesn't he?

121
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:35,900
He probably put an armband on right after the video ended.

122
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:37,980
But wait, what the fuck is this?

123
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:39,940
Who's this cleric Larper in the background?

124
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:45,460
Well, it turns out they're from the Healing Church, otherwise known as THC, and they

125
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:47,100
have something to add to this rally.

126
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:56,700
You should look at the Healing Church on Facebook, and I'm like, I outrank Pope Francis.

127
00:06:56,700 --> 00:07:02,780
I'm the Hebrew-Catholic Trump, to which it's grand, it's attached.

128
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:06,140
They're not fascists, or Nazis, they're just hippies.

129
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:11,900
That's the tree of life, oh lord, the tree of life.

130
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:14,300
I'm just looking at it.

131
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:15,980
One moment, this is a prayer service.

132
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:18,380
Oh, sorry, sorry.

133
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:25,340
You and me, come to the church.

134
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:27,500
They're just a bunch of fucking hippies, man.

135
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:31,780
Are these the insane white supremacists you thousands of morons came to fight?

136
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:33,180
A bunch of peace pipers?

137
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:35,580
That's not gonna stop Antifa, oh no.

138
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:39,700
One guy got stabbed in the hand, because he's got a neo-nazi haircut like Richard Spencer,

139
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:42,380
and so therefore he must also be a neo-nazi.

140
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:44,140
Never mind that it's just a fucking haircut.

141
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:48,500
Never mind that this style was all the rage with male hipsters and SJWs under one year

142
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:49,500
ago.

143
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:53,820
Never mind that closed-minded conservatives would attack long-haired male hippies back

144
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:56,660
in the 70s with the exact same fucking logic.

145
00:07:56,660 --> 00:08:00,500
Here's an independent journalist, Jessica Weese, who covered the counterprotest.

146
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:04,460
Tensions high, I was just surrounded by activists who screamed at me, called me a traitor for

147
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:06,820
asking a man in a Trump hat why he was here.

148
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:10,780
So when a journalist decides to actually ask for the point of view of public enemy number

149
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:16,340
one, the Trump supporter, the mega hat wearer, the conservative, they're traitors now?

150
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:20,540
It really seems like Antifa and the left in a more general sense want complete control

151
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:22,040
over the media narrative.

152
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:25,080
Here's an elderly woman holding the American flag at a rally.

153
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:29,440
Here's an Antifa thug dragging her across the park, solely because she's showing her

154
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:57,760
patriotism in public.

155
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:01,280
Here's some angry protesters demanding of a heavily tattooed man his opinions on white

156
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:22,620
people before another guy comes up behind him and sucker punches him behind the ear.

157
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:25,240
Never mind that there's no proof this guy was actually a Nazi.

158
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:28,280
Never mind that even if he was, he wasn't being violent.

159
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:33,200
Here's Joey Salads, who went undercover as part of Antifa's infamous black blocs,

160
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:37,160
in order to capture abuses committed by the protesters, abuses which include the unprovoked

161
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:41,040
assault of an innocent Trump supporter who was simply walking down the street.

162
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:44,920
Here's an Antifa member demanding a woman take off her shirt, because the shirt in question

163
00:09:44,920 --> 00:10:09,980
has a logo on it that he considers to be oppressive.

164
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:12,420
Damn dude if you want to see some titties they're all over the internet.

165
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:13,420
Give it a break.

166
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:17,100
Here's a picture from the Boston Globe of counter protesters attacking a free speech

167
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:21,380
demonstrator, complete with the phrase free speech in quotes in the byline, letting us

168
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:26,020
all know that the Globe's position is that these people aren't really free speech advocates,

169
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:27,020
just neo-Nazis.

170
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:31,500
Here's a woman who's holding a sign stating that she disagrees with both Antifa and neo-Nazis,

171
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:34,600
but supports freedom of speech for those groups as a matter of principle.

172
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:37,660
An Antifa twitter, by the way, has since doxxed her for this.

173
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:42,020
Here's a member of the Boston Antifa network named Kevin, claiming that the stabbing of

174
00:10:42,020 --> 00:11:10,060
a police horse is justified because the horse is racist.

175
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:28,400
Yeah, I wish I was making this insane shit up guys.

176
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:34,600
So a quick recap of Boston, a free speech rally held by hippies and stoners and Indian

177
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:44,040
politicians speaking truth to power, gets crashed by thousands of violent protesters

178
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:48,880
wearing black masks and carrying weapons, who proceed to attack innocent people and

179
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,300
cause property damage.

180
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:51,880
It really makes you think, you know.

181
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:57,220
It's almost like Antifa, the anti-fascist group, are the actual fascists.

182
00:11:57,220 --> 00:12:00,300
But let's bring back the theory of Holland Spheres for a second and look at some of these

183
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:02,200
events with that framework in mind.

184
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:06,840
Remember CNN's news ticker, tense scenes erupt in Boston as thousands march against

185
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:07,840
hate?

186
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:13,120
CNN has very clearly defined the Boston counter protest as a march against hate, and by implication,

187
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:15,720
the free speech rally as a rally for hate.

188
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:20,680
Therefore the statement, the Boston rally was a rally for hate, sits within CNN's

189
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:21,680
sphere of consensus.

190
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:23,960
The sphere where things are simply taken for granted.

191
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:28,160
There was no debate on whether or not the Boston rally really was a rally for hate.

192
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:30,280
It was simply assumed that it was.

193
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:34,240
Even though the Boston free speech rally was clearly not attended by hateful people.

194
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:38,020
Even though to anybody who paid attention, the statement, the Boston rally is a rally

195
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:41,440
for hate, would very obviously sit within the sphere of deviance.

196
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:46,440
But against logic, reason, and the facts of the situation, CNN put it in the sphere of

197
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:47,440
consensus.

198
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:50,800
When Jessica Weis decided to ask a Trump supporter what his motive was at the rally, she was

199
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:53,200
making a public declaration as a journalist.

200
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:57,620
She was stating that the idea that Trump supporters may have legitimate grievances, and may exercise

201
00:12:57,620 --> 00:13:01,220
their rights to peacefully protest about those grievances, exists within the sphere

202
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:02,220
of controversy.

203
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:07,580
That it is not to be immediately dismissed, nor immediately assumed, but it is to be discussed.

204
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:11,500
And she was accosted for it, because these people want that idea to be within the sphere

205
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:12,500
of deviance.

206
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:16,380
And this brings me to my larger point, Holland's spheres, as a theory, doesn't just apply

207
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:17,380
to journalism.

208
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:22,420
It applies to all human interaction, and it accurately describes how Antifa, and its supporters,

209
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:25,100
are attempting to manipulate popular opinion of these events.

210
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:29,100
For example, let's say five computer programmers are discussing a topic related to computer

211
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:30,100
programming.

212
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:33,020
They don't need to explain the basics of computer programming to each other every time

213
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:36,740
they have a conversation, even though that stuff is obviously necessary knowledge to

214
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:38,460
be able to understand the conversation.

215
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:42,420
The basics of computer programming exist within the sphere of consensus in this example.

216
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:46,700
However, if a professor of computer programming is teaching a classroom of first years how

217
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:52,260
to program, the basics of computer programming are not within the sphere of consensus, but

218
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:53,980
within the sphere of controversy.

219
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:58,280
In an interpersonal sense, you can think of the sphere of consensus to be the context

220
00:13:58,280 --> 00:13:59,700
of any given situation.

221
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:02,940
If you have it, you can adequately understand the arguments to come.

222
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:05,980
And without it, what comes next will simply be meaningless to you.

223
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:07,280
Here's another example.

224
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:09,280
Say you have two separate friend groups.

225
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:11,540
In one group, racist humor is appreciated.

226
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:13,180
In another group, it is frowned upon.

227
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:16,560
In the first group, racist humor is situated within the sphere of controversy.

228
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:19,580
And in the second group, it is situated within the sphere of deviance.

229
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:23,820
And these classifications still stem from the sphere of consensus, the context of that

230
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:24,820
friend group.

231
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:27,880
In the first group, the sphere of consensus consists of knowing that nobody in the group

232
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:29,380
is actually racist.

233
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:33,340
In the second group, the sphere of consensus consists of not finding any racist joke funny

234
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:34,340
as principal.

235
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:37,860
Holland's Spheres, in my opinion, is an accurate representation of how any grouping

236
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:41,780
of people larger than one self-polices its language and thoughts.

237
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:47,040
Any friend group, organization, news outlet, website, government, workplace, protest, or

238
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:51,160
any other collective of people, can have its opinions and ideas modeled by Holland's

239
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:52,160
Spheres.

240
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:55,000
And the contents and sizes of these spheres are not universal.

241
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,880
When two separate groups with two very different models of Holland's Spheres encounter each

242
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:01,480
other, they clash on ideological grounds.

243
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:03,760
This is, say, Antifa and the Alt-Right.

244
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:08,160
However, sometimes a subgroup within a larger parent group will try to force the parent

245
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:10,820
group's spheres to more resemble the subgroups.

246
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:13,160
This is Antifa and the American Electorate.

247
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:17,600
In other words, this is Antifa forcing its ideas, its views, and its definitions onto

248
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:22,120
the rest of the US citizenry that doesn't necessarily share those ideas, views, or definitions.

249
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:25,900
And the theory of Holland's Spheres show us how Antifa is attempting to control not

250
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:31,520
only what may or may not be discussed, aka the spheres of controversy and deviance respectively,

251
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:35,320
but also the context of any given situation, aka the sphere of consensus.

252
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:37,460
They don't even hide this anymore.

253
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:41,880
On RefuseFascism.org, Antifa has announced a November 4th national conference.

254
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:43,600
Check out the language used in this flyer.

255
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:48,160
It's time to get serious about driving the Trump-slash-Pence regime from power.

256
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,400
This nightmare must end.

257
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:51,220
The Trump-Pence regime must go.

258
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:54,800
In the name of humanity, we refuse to accept the fascist America.

259
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:59,000
Now, has the past nine months of Trump in the Oval Office been a nightmare?

260
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,240
Well, no.

261
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:01,240
Not really.

262
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:02,240
It hasn't been great.

263
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:05,500
I'm sure some people on the right are happy, some people on the left are not.

264
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:07,860
But it hasn't been this dystopian nightmare.

265
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:11,500
Do these people have the authority to declare anything in the name of humanity?

266
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:14,300
No, and yet they do with conviction.

267
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:15,780
Is America fascist?

268
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:19,580
Well, no, Trump was elected through a legitimate process.

269
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:20,680
That doesn't seem to matter.

270
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:22,980
Is any of this reflective of reality?

271
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:27,860
No, and yet that's the language they use and the ideas they hold.

272
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:32,720
Dystopian nightmare, fascist America, and Trump regime are ideas within their sphere

273
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:37,300
of consensus, and they plan to make it within everybody else's spheres of consensus too

274
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:39,060
by any means necessary.

275
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:42,740
Are you still not convinced this is a language war as well as a physical one?

276
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:45,820
Check out Boston Antifa's Facebook post on the counter protest.

277
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:52,260
There is no room for capitalists, conservatives, libertarians, classical liberals, or supporters

278
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:54,680
of the US Constitution in our city.

279
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:55,860
You must leave.

280
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:57,460
Hashtag Boston resist.

281
00:16:57,460 --> 00:17:01,560
All of these ideas they've just listed off, they're all the same to them, despite being

282
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:03,300
radically different ideas.

283
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:06,260
In the minds of Antifa members, they're all strung together because they're all

284
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:07,820
within the sphere of deviance.

285
00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:09,780
That's their only uniting trait.

286
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:12,500
I know, this all sounds a little bit out there sometimes.

287
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:15,740
But with Hallen's spheres in mind, take a look at the headlines that came out after

288
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:18,160
Boston and Charlotte's villain Phoenix.

289
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:22,900
Unmasking the leftist Antifa movement, activists seek peace through violence.

290
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:24,840
Antifa is short for anti-fascists.

291
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:27,900
Their main goal is disrupting neo-Nazis and white supremacists.

292
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:29,640
Seeking peace through violence.

293
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:30,820
Peace through violence.

294
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:35,180
It's insane to think that CNN would be apologizing this fucking hard for people who start street

295
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:38,260
battles at peaceful protests, but here we are.

296
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:43,020
Neo-Nazi violence, even neo-Nazi speech, exists within the sphere of deviance for CNN.

297
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:44,460
But Antifa violence?

298
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:45,460
Sphere of controversy.

299
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:47,300
Let's give that one a fair shake.

300
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:50,660
CNN eventually changed the subtitle of the article and scrubbed it of all peace through

301
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:51,940
violence references.

302
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:55,080
Presumably after they realized that the rest of the world didn't actually share their

303
00:17:55,080 --> 00:18:00,580
ideological bent on the subject, but they didn't edit their Facebook posts or video.

304
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:01,700
Because they're idiots.

305
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:04,220
Check out CNN's coverage of Phoenix, too.

306
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:20,820
So, Antifa's violence, sphere of controversy, Trump's speech being angry, sphere of consensus.

307
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:22,340
Are you seeing a pattern yet?

308
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:26,380
When the alt-right uses domestic violence imagery to make a mockery of Antifa, the BBC

309
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:31,020
is more concerned with the smearing of Antifa's public image than it is of the accuracy of

310
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:35,540
the alt-right's mockery, which is very telling considering Antifa's actual tendency

311
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:38,500
to attack anybody that disagrees with them, including women.

312
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:42,060
The Huffington Post put out an article stating that being a soldier will turn you into a

313
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:43,060
racist.

314
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:46,780
The Guardian considers rational centrists to be the true ideologues, presumably for

315
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:48,860
not adhering to leftist ideology.

316
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:50,560
And here's the hottest take yet.

317
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:54,580
Charles Barkley is a great example of a black white supremacist.

318
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:58,380
I know this is going beyond Antifa now and into general regressive left bullshit, but

319
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:01,220
I want to make sure this point gets across to you as clearly as possible.

320
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:04,340
Here's a diagram of the Holland Spheres for average everyday people.

321
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:08,020
Here's a diagram of the Holland Spheres for the violent minority known as Antifa.

322
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:10,580
And they're sympathizing mouthpieces within the mainstream media.

323
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:11,820
Do you see the difference?

324
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:15,480
Do you see how many fewer ideas are within the sphere of controversy?

325
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:19,420
More ideas that they consider to be ideologically in line with them are within the sphere of

326
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:20,420
consensus.

327
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:24,420
It's not even worth debating those ones, they're universally good and true, and you

328
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:25,940
should just accept that.

329
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:29,660
Additionally, more ideas that they consider to be ideologically opposed to them are within

330
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:30,660
the sphere of deviance.

331
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:34,780
They're evil, and false, and only worth talking about negatively, and if you disagree

332
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:37,300
in any way, you must be evil and false too.

333
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:41,580
It's my opinion that if you graph out the sum of all the ideas of any echo chamber into

334
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:45,780
a set of Holland Spheres, you're going to get a large inner circle, and even larger

335
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:49,100
outer circle, with very little room for debate in the middle.

336
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:52,260
I would say that this is indicative of an intellectually unhealthy group.

337
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:56,980
A free society would have a much larger middle sphere, reflecting its tendency to use rational

338
00:19:56,980 --> 00:19:58,980
discourse to settle matters of debate.

339
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:03,660
So when the next Boston or Phoenix protest happens, when the next Barcelona or Charleston

340
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:08,400
attack goes down, and you start to read or listen or watch various news sources, keep

341
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,220
an eye on Holland Spheres.

342
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:13,740
What are they simply assuming to be commonly held positions that you disagree with?

343
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:17,500
What are they going out of their way to reference negatively, or twisting themselves into pretzels

344
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:18,700
in order to excuse?

345
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:22,580
Pay just as much attention to those things as to what they're actually saying, if not

346
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:23,580
more so.

347
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:27,300
And as for you Antifa, your revolution's not going to work if you think you can actually

348
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:31,420
call for a time out during a battle in order to get your fucking service dog.

349
00:20:48,700 --> 00:21:07,480
Thanks for watching everybody, sorry this one's a little late, I like to do these once

350
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:10,500
a week generally and I know it's been longer than that since Charlottesville.

351
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:13,820
My real problem was I didn't want to do just another surface level run down of the Boston

352
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:17,020
events, and I struggled a bit trying to find the angle I wanted to take.

353
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:20,040
It was actually by chance that I discovered Holland's theory of the spheres of public

354
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:22,900
discourse, and I realized that it fit in with the topic really well.

355
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:26,500
If somebody were attempting to manipulate popular opinion on a larger scale using the

356
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:29,780
media, the changing contents of the spheres would be a good way to get that point across

357
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:31,380
in a visual sense.

358
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:34,620
Thanks to everybody who supports me on Patreon, you guys help keep these videos flowing.

359
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:39,620
If you want to keep up with what I do, I post generalized project schedules over at facebook.com

360
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:44,500
slash sfotaku and specific releases as well as a lot of other bullshit over at twitter.com

361
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:45,500
slash sharpheadotaku.

362
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:49,460
There's also a discord channel where I chat with people regularly, links in the description.

363
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:55,140
I also maintain a gaming channel over at youtube.com slash c slash no talent gaming, and I stream

364
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:58,740
around four times a week at twitch.tv slash shortheadotaku.

365
00:21:58,740 --> 00:22:00,900
Alright pals, that about wraps it up for me.

366
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:26,380
I love you.

367
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:41,940
Thanks for watching.
