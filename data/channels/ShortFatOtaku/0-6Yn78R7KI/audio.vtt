00:00.000 --> 00:03.440
When I was putting the finishing touches on the Charlottesville video, the Boston rally

00:03.440 --> 00:04.780
started going down.

00:04.780 --> 00:08.300
And my initial reaction was, I've got to do something on this.

00:08.300 --> 00:11.400
And then shortly after, the Phoenix rally thing happened.

00:11.400 --> 00:13.840
And then the Barcelona terror attack went down too.

00:13.840 --> 00:14.840
And then the Charleston shooting.

00:14.840 --> 00:17.120
And then the Buckingham Palace sword attack.

00:17.120 --> 00:20.280
And then the media shat itself to Trump's response to Hurricane Matthew.

00:20.280 --> 00:21.880
Holy shit, it's hard to keep up.

00:21.880 --> 00:25.920
I could do a play-by-play of each event, if people really wanted me to.

00:25.920 --> 00:27.160
Like I did with Charlottesville.

00:27.160 --> 00:29.820
Show the big happenings, analyze them, give my take.

00:29.820 --> 00:33.240
But frankly, there's a lot of people out there that have done so already, with varying

00:33.240 --> 00:34.740
degrees of competency.

00:34.740 --> 00:37.420
Ranging from far better than me to far worse.

00:37.420 --> 00:40.060
I think there's something bigger here that we have to discuss though.

00:40.060 --> 00:43.180
Something that links all these seemingly disparate events together.

00:43.180 --> 00:47.100
I'll still do some analysis, but I want to discuss the big picture for a minute.

00:47.100 --> 00:49.420
Let's talk about the theory of Howland's Spheres.

00:49.420 --> 00:54.200
Daniel Howland, in his book The Uncensored War, devised a theory that divides all political

00:54.200 --> 00:56.340
discourse into three concentric circles.

00:56.340 --> 00:59.940
The inner circle, known as the sphere of consensus, contains all knowledge in which

00:59.940 --> 01:03.800
there is widespread agreement, or at least the perception of widespread agreement.

01:03.800 --> 01:07.660
Within this first sphere, journalists feel free to invoke a generalized we when discussing

01:07.660 --> 01:11.200
their points of view, and often take for granted shared values and assumptions.

01:11.200 --> 01:15.300
The middle circle, known as the sphere of controversy, is where rational and informed

01:15.300 --> 01:17.580
people regularly hold differing views on a topic.

01:17.580 --> 01:21.380
To an ethical journalist, these topics are therefore the most important to cover, and

01:21.380 --> 01:24.340
also the most important to remain unbiased about in their coverage.

01:24.340 --> 01:27.660
In order to present an objective as possible view of the situation to the public.

01:27.660 --> 01:32.500
The outer circle, known as the sphere of deviance, is basically the place where bad stories go

01:32.500 --> 01:33.500
to die.

01:33.500 --> 01:36.820
This is the realm of topics that journalists generally do not discuss at all, either because

01:36.820 --> 01:41.340
they are obviously false or unfounded, they're taboo, or they're so insignificant that

01:41.340 --> 01:42.660
they're simply not newsworthy.

01:42.660 --> 01:47.840
If these topics ever are discussed, they're specifically framed as ridiculous, dangerous,

01:47.840 --> 01:49.380
or in some other way, marginal.

01:49.380 --> 01:53.340
Here's a simplistic example of the spheres in action, and I'll use the Nazis because

01:53.340 --> 01:56.140
they're going to be coming up in this video more than a few times.

01:56.140 --> 02:00.060
The claim, Nazis are bad, directly falls within the sphere of consensus.

02:00.060 --> 02:04.700
The majority of people agree that Nazis are in fact bad, to the point that you don't

02:04.700 --> 02:08.680
really need to explain why they're bad anymore when writing an article on Nazis.

02:08.680 --> 02:13.860
To contrast, the phrase, Hitler did nothing wrong, and no I don't mean the meme you

02:13.860 --> 02:18.220
see everywhere on the internet, I mean an actual serious interpretation of that phrase,

02:18.220 --> 02:19.860
belongs within the sphere of deviance.

02:19.860 --> 02:24.640
You're very rarely going to see this interpretation of Hitler in the media, and when you do, it's

02:24.640 --> 02:29.660
going to be used to showcase the danger or insanity of a subject on the fringes of society.

02:29.660 --> 02:35.300
Meanwhile, a hypothetical article titled, say, Neo-Nazis hold Unite the Right rally

02:35.300 --> 02:38.220
in Charlottesville, sits within the sphere of controversy.

02:38.220 --> 02:42.220
The title itself invokes the Nazis are bad assumption from the sphere of consensus, and

02:42.220 --> 02:46.100
this invocation implies that the article will not be taking the stance that Hitler did nothing

02:46.100 --> 02:48.420
wrong from the sphere of deviance.

02:48.460 --> 02:52.620
Basically, the outer circle consists of topics that must never be discussed, and the inner

02:52.620 --> 02:57.220
circle consists of topics that can be discussed but rarely are, simply because they're considered

02:57.220 --> 02:58.220
to be common sense.

02:58.220 --> 03:00.260
Now, why am I bringing all this up?

03:00.260 --> 03:04.300
Because Hellen's spheres accurately represents the way in which journalists see the world,

03:04.300 --> 03:08.420
and as the individual journalists or even specific outlets and organizations change,

03:08.420 --> 03:10.920
the contents of the three spheres also change.

03:10.920 --> 03:15.860
For example, where left-wing outlets like Salon or Vice or whatever are more than willing

03:15.860 --> 03:20.660
to blanket every single attendee of Unite the Right as a neo-nazi, a right-wing outlet

03:20.660 --> 03:25.600
like, say, Fox News, may be more willing to call them alt-right instead of neo-nazi, or

03:25.600 --> 03:29.660
mention that multiple different factions of people, some with very different sets of goals

03:29.660 --> 03:32.600
and visions, all attended Unite the Right.

03:32.600 --> 03:38.060
So the statement, not everybody at Unite the Right was a neo-nazi, sits cleanly within

03:38.060 --> 03:41.980
the sphere of deviance for left-leaning publications and journalists, but is actually within the

03:41.980 --> 03:46.300
sphere of controversy for centrist and right-leaning publications and journalists.

03:46.300 --> 03:49.020
Keep this idea in mind, we'll be coming back to it a bit later.

03:49.020 --> 03:51.940
Let's check out what the Boston rally actually was.

03:51.940 --> 03:54.980
Thousands march in Boston in protest of controversial rally.

03:54.980 --> 03:59.160
Thousands of counter-demonstrators march Sunday in downtown Boston in a largely peaceful response

03:59.160 --> 04:03.300
to a self-described free speech rally that had sparked concerns of possible violence.

04:03.300 --> 04:07.620
It's clear today that Boston stood for peace and love, not bigotry and hate, the Boston

04:07.620 --> 04:08.620
mayor said.

04:08.620 --> 04:12.380
On the embedded video in this CNN article, the news ticker reads,

04:12.380 --> 04:16.280
Tense scenes erupt in Boston as thousands march against hate.

04:16.280 --> 04:17.820
And the crowd was very large.

04:17.820 --> 04:19.940
ABC caught an aerial view of these counter-protesters.

04:19.940 --> 04:22.900
And it looks like thousands of them are flooding the streets.

04:22.900 --> 04:25.480
But let's try and get some footage shot by people on the ground, I'm sure we can dig

04:25.480 --> 04:26.480
some up.

04:26.480 --> 04:31.540
Evan McMurry, working for ABC, got ahold of an enlightening video shot by a drone regarding

04:31.540 --> 04:32.640
the crowd size.

04:32.640 --> 04:36.340
He says, this is the first video I've seen that really shows the disparity between the

04:36.340 --> 04:40.540
quote, free speech rally, and the thousands of counter-demonstrators.

04:40.540 --> 04:44.940
It doesn't sound like he's taking a neutral opinion on this one, guys.

04:44.940 --> 04:46.340
Why do you think that could be?

04:46.340 --> 04:50.500
At least, in the video, we can see that the Boston police actually set up barricades,

04:50.500 --> 04:54.000
preventing the counter-protesters from approaching the park's rotunda, where a gathering of

04:54.000 --> 04:59.760
what was estimated to be about 30 people showed up to protest such hateful topics as Massantos

04:59.760 --> 05:04.900
genetically modified food, black lives actually mattering, and the views of a local candidate

05:04.900 --> 05:07.920
running for office using the hashtag, shiva4senate.

05:07.920 --> 05:13.340
That shiva guy, by the way, is Dr. Shiva Ayadurai, and he uploaded his speech at the Boston Free

05:13.340 --> 05:15.260
Speech Rally to his YouTube channel.

05:15.260 --> 05:16.260
Here's a few choice bits.

05:16.260 --> 05:17.260
They tried to stop us today, didn't they?

05:17.260 --> 05:18.260
But, you know, we weren't cowed down.

05:18.260 --> 05:28.260
And I will always stand up for all of you, and all of us here, in many ways, are true

05:28.260 --> 05:29.260
patriots.

05:29.260 --> 05:33.340
Because we, in spite of that noise out there, we're here to stand up for something very

05:33.340 --> 05:35.820
fundamental, which is called free speech.

05:35.820 --> 05:40.340
And let me tell you that they tried to prevent me from coming here, as you may have heard

05:40.340 --> 05:41.340
in the media.

05:41.340 --> 05:46.300
They asked me why I associated myself with all of you guys, even though they have no

05:46.300 --> 05:48.580
idea who you or we are.

05:48.580 --> 05:50.580
Let me remind you about Joe Biden.

05:50.580 --> 05:55.860
He's a guy who said Obama, which many of those people support, is the first clean, quote

05:55.860 --> 05:58.300
unquote clean and articulate black man.

05:58.300 --> 05:59.300
He's a racist.

05:59.300 --> 06:01.580
But no one asked about that, did they?

06:01.580 --> 06:06.220
Hillary Clinton stereotyped and mocked my people, Indians.

06:06.220 --> 06:11.340
You can go see the YouTube video, in a very offensive manner, just go look at it.

06:11.340 --> 06:14.300
She mocked Mahatma Gandhi, who's one of the icons of Indians.

06:14.300 --> 06:18.780
You see, you won't find a lot of Indians like me here, because my parents were considered

06:18.780 --> 06:19.780
low caste.

06:19.780 --> 06:23.700
Lower caste than most of those people out there, who don't even know what it means to

06:23.700 --> 06:24.700
be that.

06:24.700 --> 06:28.980
The establishment is what's infested with racists, not us.

06:28.980 --> 06:30.620
I don't see any racists here.

06:30.660 --> 06:33.380
Yeah, this guy just seems like a fucking Nazi, doesn't he?

06:33.380 --> 06:35.900
He probably put an armband on right after the video ended.

06:35.900 --> 06:37.980
But wait, what the fuck is this?

06:37.980 --> 06:39.940
Who's this cleric Larper in the background?

06:39.940 --> 06:45.460
Well, it turns out they're from the Healing Church, otherwise known as THC, and they

06:45.460 --> 06:47.100
have something to add to this rally.

06:47.100 --> 06:56.700
You should look at the Healing Church on Facebook, and I'm like, I outrank Pope Francis.

06:56.700 --> 07:02.780
I'm the Hebrew-Catholic Trump, to which it's grand, it's attached.

07:02.780 --> 07:06.140
They're not fascists, or Nazis, they're just hippies.

07:06.140 --> 07:11.900
That's the tree of life, oh lord, the tree of life.

07:11.900 --> 07:14.300
I'm just looking at it.

07:14.300 --> 07:15.980
One moment, this is a prayer service.

07:15.980 --> 07:18.380
Oh, sorry, sorry.

07:18.380 --> 07:25.340
You and me, come to the church.

07:25.580 --> 07:27.500
They're just a bunch of fucking hippies, man.

07:27.500 --> 07:31.780
Are these the insane white supremacists you thousands of morons came to fight?

07:31.780 --> 07:33.180
A bunch of peace pipers?

07:33.180 --> 07:35.580
That's not gonna stop Antifa, oh no.

07:35.580 --> 07:39.700
One guy got stabbed in the hand, because he's got a neo-nazi haircut like Richard Spencer,

07:39.700 --> 07:42.380
and so therefore he must also be a neo-nazi.

07:42.380 --> 07:44.140
Never mind that it's just a fucking haircut.

07:44.140 --> 07:48.500
Never mind that this style was all the rage with male hipsters and SJWs under one year

07:48.500 --> 07:49.500
ago.

07:49.500 --> 07:53.820
Never mind that closed-minded conservatives would attack long-haired male hippies back

07:53.820 --> 07:56.660
in the 70s with the exact same fucking logic.

07:56.660 --> 08:00.500
Here's an independent journalist, Jessica Weese, who covered the counterprotest.

08:00.500 --> 08:04.460
Tensions high, I was just surrounded by activists who screamed at me, called me a traitor for

08:04.460 --> 08:06.820
asking a man in a Trump hat why he was here.

08:06.820 --> 08:10.780
So when a journalist decides to actually ask for the point of view of public enemy number

08:10.780 --> 08:16.340
one, the Trump supporter, the mega hat wearer, the conservative, they're traitors now?

08:16.340 --> 08:20.540
It really seems like Antifa and the left in a more general sense want complete control

08:20.540 --> 08:22.040
over the media narrative.

08:22.040 --> 08:25.080
Here's an elderly woman holding the American flag at a rally.

08:25.080 --> 08:29.440
Here's an Antifa thug dragging her across the park, solely because she's showing her

08:29.440 --> 08:57.760
patriotism in public.

08:57.760 --> 09:01.280
Here's some angry protesters demanding of a heavily tattooed man his opinions on white

09:01.280 --> 09:22.620
people before another guy comes up behind him and sucker punches him behind the ear.

09:22.620 --> 09:25.240
Never mind that there's no proof this guy was actually a Nazi.

09:25.240 --> 09:28.280
Never mind that even if he was, he wasn't being violent.

09:28.280 --> 09:33.200
Here's Joey Salads, who went undercover as part of Antifa's infamous black blocs,

09:33.200 --> 09:37.160
in order to capture abuses committed by the protesters, abuses which include the unprovoked

09:37.160 --> 09:41.040
assault of an innocent Trump supporter who was simply walking down the street.

09:41.040 --> 09:44.920
Here's an Antifa member demanding a woman take off her shirt, because the shirt in question

09:44.920 --> 10:09.980
has a logo on it that he considers to be oppressive.

10:09.980 --> 10:12.420
Damn dude if you want to see some titties they're all over the internet.

10:12.420 --> 10:13.420
Give it a break.

10:13.420 --> 10:17.100
Here's a picture from the Boston Globe of counter protesters attacking a free speech

10:17.100 --> 10:21.380
demonstrator, complete with the phrase free speech in quotes in the byline, letting us

10:21.380 --> 10:26.020
all know that the Globe's position is that these people aren't really free speech advocates,

10:26.020 --> 10:27.020
just neo-Nazis.

10:27.020 --> 10:31.500
Here's a woman who's holding a sign stating that she disagrees with both Antifa and neo-Nazis,

10:31.500 --> 10:34.600
but supports freedom of speech for those groups as a matter of principle.

10:34.600 --> 10:37.660
An Antifa twitter, by the way, has since doxxed her for this.

10:37.660 --> 10:42.020
Here's a member of the Boston Antifa network named Kevin, claiming that the stabbing of

10:42.020 --> 11:10.060
a police horse is justified because the horse is racist.

11:10.060 --> 11:28.400
Yeah, I wish I was making this insane shit up guys.

11:28.400 --> 11:34.600
So a quick recap of Boston, a free speech rally held by hippies and stoners and Indian

11:34.600 --> 11:44.040
politicians speaking truth to power, gets crashed by thousands of violent protesters

11:44.040 --> 11:48.880
wearing black masks and carrying weapons, who proceed to attack innocent people and

11:48.880 --> 11:50.300
cause property damage.

11:50.300 --> 11:51.880
It really makes you think, you know.

11:51.880 --> 11:57.220
It's almost like Antifa, the anti-fascist group, are the actual fascists.

11:57.220 --> 12:00.300
But let's bring back the theory of Holland Spheres for a second and look at some of these

12:00.300 --> 12:02.200
events with that framework in mind.

12:02.200 --> 12:06.840
Remember CNN's news ticker, tense scenes erupt in Boston as thousands march against

12:06.840 --> 12:07.840
hate?

12:07.840 --> 12:13.120
CNN has very clearly defined the Boston counter protest as a march against hate, and by implication,

12:13.120 --> 12:15.720
the free speech rally as a rally for hate.

12:15.720 --> 12:20.680
Therefore the statement, the Boston rally was a rally for hate, sits within CNN's

12:20.680 --> 12:21.680
sphere of consensus.

12:21.680 --> 12:23.960
The sphere where things are simply taken for granted.

12:23.960 --> 12:28.160
There was no debate on whether or not the Boston rally really was a rally for hate.

12:28.160 --> 12:30.280
It was simply assumed that it was.

12:30.280 --> 12:34.240
Even though the Boston free speech rally was clearly not attended by hateful people.

12:34.240 --> 12:38.020
Even though to anybody who paid attention, the statement, the Boston rally is a rally

12:38.020 --> 12:41.440
for hate, would very obviously sit within the sphere of deviance.

12:41.440 --> 12:46.440
But against logic, reason, and the facts of the situation, CNN put it in the sphere of

12:46.440 --> 12:47.440
consensus.

12:47.440 --> 12:50.800
When Jessica Weis decided to ask a Trump supporter what his motive was at the rally, she was

12:50.800 --> 12:53.200
making a public declaration as a journalist.

12:53.200 --> 12:57.620
She was stating that the idea that Trump supporters may have legitimate grievances, and may exercise

12:57.620 --> 13:01.220
their rights to peacefully protest about those grievances, exists within the sphere

13:01.220 --> 13:02.220
of controversy.

13:02.220 --> 13:07.580
That it is not to be immediately dismissed, nor immediately assumed, but it is to be discussed.

13:07.580 --> 13:11.500
And she was accosted for it, because these people want that idea to be within the sphere

13:11.500 --> 13:12.500
of deviance.

13:12.500 --> 13:16.380
And this brings me to my larger point, Holland's spheres, as a theory, doesn't just apply

13:16.380 --> 13:17.380
to journalism.

13:17.380 --> 13:22.420
It applies to all human interaction, and it accurately describes how Antifa, and its supporters,

13:22.420 --> 13:25.100
are attempting to manipulate popular opinion of these events.

13:25.100 --> 13:29.100
For example, let's say five computer programmers are discussing a topic related to computer

13:29.100 --> 13:30.100
programming.

13:30.100 --> 13:33.020
They don't need to explain the basics of computer programming to each other every time

13:33.020 --> 13:36.740
they have a conversation, even though that stuff is obviously necessary knowledge to

13:36.740 --> 13:38.460
be able to understand the conversation.

13:38.460 --> 13:42.420
The basics of computer programming exist within the sphere of consensus in this example.

13:42.420 --> 13:46.700
However, if a professor of computer programming is teaching a classroom of first years how

13:46.700 --> 13:52.260
to program, the basics of computer programming are not within the sphere of consensus, but

13:52.260 --> 13:53.980
within the sphere of controversy.

13:53.980 --> 13:58.280
In an interpersonal sense, you can think of the sphere of consensus to be the context

13:58.280 --> 13:59.700
of any given situation.

13:59.700 --> 14:02.940
If you have it, you can adequately understand the arguments to come.

14:02.940 --> 14:05.980
And without it, what comes next will simply be meaningless to you.

14:05.980 --> 14:07.280
Here's another example.

14:07.280 --> 14:09.280
Say you have two separate friend groups.

14:09.280 --> 14:11.540
In one group, racist humor is appreciated.

14:11.540 --> 14:13.180
In another group, it is frowned upon.

14:13.180 --> 14:16.560
In the first group, racist humor is situated within the sphere of controversy.

14:16.560 --> 14:19.580
And in the second group, it is situated within the sphere of deviance.

14:19.580 --> 14:23.820
And these classifications still stem from the sphere of consensus, the context of that

14:23.820 --> 14:24.820
friend group.

14:24.820 --> 14:27.880
In the first group, the sphere of consensus consists of knowing that nobody in the group

14:27.880 --> 14:29.380
is actually racist.

14:29.380 --> 14:33.340
In the second group, the sphere of consensus consists of not finding any racist joke funny

14:33.340 --> 14:34.340
as principal.

14:34.340 --> 14:37.860
Holland's Spheres, in my opinion, is an accurate representation of how any grouping

14:37.860 --> 14:41.780
of people larger than one self-polices its language and thoughts.

14:41.780 --> 14:47.040
Any friend group, organization, news outlet, website, government, workplace, protest, or

14:47.040 --> 14:51.160
any other collective of people, can have its opinions and ideas modeled by Holland's

14:51.160 --> 14:52.160
Spheres.

14:52.160 --> 14:55.000
And the contents and sizes of these spheres are not universal.

14:55.000 --> 14:58.880
When two separate groups with two very different models of Holland's Spheres encounter each

14:58.880 --> 15:01.480
other, they clash on ideological grounds.

15:01.480 --> 15:03.760
This is, say, Antifa and the Alt-Right.

15:03.760 --> 15:08.160
However, sometimes a subgroup within a larger parent group will try to force the parent

15:08.160 --> 15:10.820
group's spheres to more resemble the subgroups.

15:10.820 --> 15:13.160
This is Antifa and the American Electorate.

15:13.160 --> 15:17.600
In other words, this is Antifa forcing its ideas, its views, and its definitions onto

15:17.600 --> 15:22.120
the rest of the US citizenry that doesn't necessarily share those ideas, views, or definitions.

15:22.120 --> 15:25.900
And the theory of Holland's Spheres show us how Antifa is attempting to control not

15:25.900 --> 15:31.520
only what may or may not be discussed, aka the spheres of controversy and deviance respectively,

15:31.520 --> 15:35.320
but also the context of any given situation, aka the sphere of consensus.

15:35.320 --> 15:37.460
They don't even hide this anymore.

15:37.460 --> 15:41.880
On RefuseFascism.org, Antifa has announced a November 4th national conference.

15:41.880 --> 15:43.600
Check out the language used in this flyer.

15:43.600 --> 15:48.160
It's time to get serious about driving the Trump-slash-Pence regime from power.

15:48.160 --> 15:49.400
This nightmare must end.

15:49.400 --> 15:51.220
The Trump-Pence regime must go.

15:51.220 --> 15:54.800
In the name of humanity, we refuse to accept the fascist America.

15:54.800 --> 15:59.000
Now, has the past nine months of Trump in the Oval Office been a nightmare?

15:59.000 --> 16:00.240
Well, no.

16:00.240 --> 16:01.240
Not really.

16:01.240 --> 16:02.240
It hasn't been great.

16:02.240 --> 16:05.500
I'm sure some people on the right are happy, some people on the left are not.

16:05.500 --> 16:07.860
But it hasn't been this dystopian nightmare.

16:07.860 --> 16:11.500
Do these people have the authority to declare anything in the name of humanity?

16:11.500 --> 16:14.300
No, and yet they do with conviction.

16:14.300 --> 16:15.780
Is America fascist?

16:15.780 --> 16:19.580
Well, no, Trump was elected through a legitimate process.

16:19.580 --> 16:20.680
That doesn't seem to matter.

16:20.680 --> 16:22.980
Is any of this reflective of reality?

16:22.980 --> 16:27.860
No, and yet that's the language they use and the ideas they hold.

16:27.860 --> 16:32.720
Dystopian nightmare, fascist America, and Trump regime are ideas within their sphere

16:32.720 --> 16:37.300
of consensus, and they plan to make it within everybody else's spheres of consensus too

16:37.300 --> 16:39.060
by any means necessary.

16:39.060 --> 16:42.740
Are you still not convinced this is a language war as well as a physical one?

16:42.740 --> 16:45.820
Check out Boston Antifa's Facebook post on the counter protest.

16:45.820 --> 16:52.260
There is no room for capitalists, conservatives, libertarians, classical liberals, or supporters

16:52.260 --> 16:54.680
of the US Constitution in our city.

16:54.680 --> 16:55.860
You must leave.

16:55.860 --> 16:57.460
Hashtag Boston resist.

16:57.460 --> 17:01.560
All of these ideas they've just listed off, they're all the same to them, despite being

17:01.560 --> 17:03.300
radically different ideas.

17:03.300 --> 17:06.260
In the minds of Antifa members, they're all strung together because they're all

17:06.260 --> 17:07.820
within the sphere of deviance.

17:07.820 --> 17:09.780
That's their only uniting trait.

17:09.780 --> 17:12.500
I know, this all sounds a little bit out there sometimes.

17:12.500 --> 17:15.740
But with Hallen's spheres in mind, take a look at the headlines that came out after

17:15.740 --> 17:18.160
Boston and Charlotte's villain Phoenix.

17:18.160 --> 17:22.900
Unmasking the leftist Antifa movement, activists seek peace through violence.

17:22.900 --> 17:24.840
Antifa is short for anti-fascists.

17:24.840 --> 17:27.900
Their main goal is disrupting neo-Nazis and white supremacists.

17:27.900 --> 17:29.640
Seeking peace through violence.

17:29.640 --> 17:30.820
Peace through violence.

17:30.820 --> 17:35.180
It's insane to think that CNN would be apologizing this fucking hard for people who start street

17:35.180 --> 17:38.260
battles at peaceful protests, but here we are.

17:38.260 --> 17:43.020
Neo-Nazi violence, even neo-Nazi speech, exists within the sphere of deviance for CNN.

17:43.020 --> 17:44.460
But Antifa violence?

17:44.460 --> 17:45.460
Sphere of controversy.

17:45.460 --> 17:47.300
Let's give that one a fair shake.

17:47.300 --> 17:50.660
CNN eventually changed the subtitle of the article and scrubbed it of all peace through

17:50.660 --> 17:51.940
violence references.

17:51.940 --> 17:55.080
Presumably after they realized that the rest of the world didn't actually share their

17:55.080 --> 18:00.580
ideological bent on the subject, but they didn't edit their Facebook posts or video.

18:00.580 --> 18:01.700
Because they're idiots.

18:01.700 --> 18:04.220
Check out CNN's coverage of Phoenix, too.

18:04.220 --> 18:20.820
So, Antifa's violence, sphere of controversy, Trump's speech being angry, sphere of consensus.

18:20.820 --> 18:22.340
Are you seeing a pattern yet?

18:22.340 --> 18:26.380
When the alt-right uses domestic violence imagery to make a mockery of Antifa, the BBC

18:26.380 --> 18:31.020
is more concerned with the smearing of Antifa's public image than it is of the accuracy of

18:31.020 --> 18:35.540
the alt-right's mockery, which is very telling considering Antifa's actual tendency

18:35.540 --> 18:38.500
to attack anybody that disagrees with them, including women.

18:38.500 --> 18:42.060
The Huffington Post put out an article stating that being a soldier will turn you into a

18:42.060 --> 18:43.060
racist.

18:43.060 --> 18:46.780
The Guardian considers rational centrists to be the true ideologues, presumably for

18:46.780 --> 18:48.860
not adhering to leftist ideology.

18:48.860 --> 18:50.560
And here's the hottest take yet.

18:50.560 --> 18:54.580
Charles Barkley is a great example of a black white supremacist.

18:54.580 --> 18:58.380
I know this is going beyond Antifa now and into general regressive left bullshit, but

18:58.380 --> 19:01.220
I want to make sure this point gets across to you as clearly as possible.

19:01.220 --> 19:04.340
Here's a diagram of the Holland Spheres for average everyday people.

19:04.340 --> 19:08.020
Here's a diagram of the Holland Spheres for the violent minority known as Antifa.

19:08.020 --> 19:10.580
And they're sympathizing mouthpieces within the mainstream media.

19:10.580 --> 19:11.820
Do you see the difference?

19:11.820 --> 19:15.480
Do you see how many fewer ideas are within the sphere of controversy?

19:15.480 --> 19:19.420
More ideas that they consider to be ideologically in line with them are within the sphere of

19:19.420 --> 19:20.420
consensus.

19:20.420 --> 19:24.420
It's not even worth debating those ones, they're universally good and true, and you

19:24.420 --> 19:25.940
should just accept that.

19:25.940 --> 19:29.660
Additionally, more ideas that they consider to be ideologically opposed to them are within

19:29.660 --> 19:30.660
the sphere of deviance.

19:30.660 --> 19:34.780
They're evil, and false, and only worth talking about negatively, and if you disagree

19:34.780 --> 19:37.300
in any way, you must be evil and false too.

19:37.300 --> 19:41.580
It's my opinion that if you graph out the sum of all the ideas of any echo chamber into

19:41.580 --> 19:45.780
a set of Holland Spheres, you're going to get a large inner circle, and even larger

19:45.780 --> 19:49.100
outer circle, with very little room for debate in the middle.

19:49.100 --> 19:52.260
I would say that this is indicative of an intellectually unhealthy group.

19:52.300 --> 19:56.980
A free society would have a much larger middle sphere, reflecting its tendency to use rational

19:56.980 --> 19:58.980
discourse to settle matters of debate.

19:58.980 --> 20:03.660
So when the next Boston or Phoenix protest happens, when the next Barcelona or Charleston

20:03.660 --> 20:08.400
attack goes down, and you start to read or listen or watch various news sources, keep

20:08.400 --> 20:10.220
an eye on Holland Spheres.

20:10.220 --> 20:13.740
What are they simply assuming to be commonly held positions that you disagree with?

20:13.740 --> 20:17.500
What are they going out of their way to reference negatively, or twisting themselves into pretzels

20:17.500 --> 20:18.700
in order to excuse?

20:18.700 --> 20:22.580
Pay just as much attention to those things as to what they're actually saying, if not

20:22.580 --> 20:23.580
more so.

20:23.580 --> 20:27.300
And as for you Antifa, your revolution's not going to work if you think you can actually

20:27.300 --> 20:31.420
call for a time out during a battle in order to get your fucking service dog.

20:48.700 --> 21:07.480
Thanks for watching everybody, sorry this one's a little late, I like to do these once

21:07.480 --> 21:10.500
a week generally and I know it's been longer than that since Charlottesville.

21:10.500 --> 21:13.820
My real problem was I didn't want to do just another surface level run down of the Boston

21:13.820 --> 21:17.020
events, and I struggled a bit trying to find the angle I wanted to take.

21:17.020 --> 21:20.040
It was actually by chance that I discovered Holland's theory of the spheres of public

21:20.040 --> 21:22.900
discourse, and I realized that it fit in with the topic really well.

21:22.900 --> 21:26.500
If somebody were attempting to manipulate popular opinion on a larger scale using the

21:26.500 --> 21:29.780
media, the changing contents of the spheres would be a good way to get that point across

21:29.780 --> 21:31.380
in a visual sense.

21:31.380 --> 21:34.620
Thanks to everybody who supports me on Patreon, you guys help keep these videos flowing.

21:34.620 --> 21:39.620
If you want to keep up with what I do, I post generalized project schedules over at facebook.com

21:39.620 --> 21:44.500
slash sfotaku and specific releases as well as a lot of other bullshit over at twitter.com

21:44.500 --> 21:45.500
slash sharpheadotaku.

21:45.500 --> 21:49.460
There's also a discord channel where I chat with people regularly, links in the description.

21:49.460 --> 21:55.140
I also maintain a gaming channel over at youtube.com slash c slash no talent gaming, and I stream

21:55.140 --> 21:58.740
around four times a week at twitch.tv slash shortheadotaku.

21:58.740 --> 22:00.900
Alright pals, that about wraps it up for me.

22:00.900 --> 22:26.380
I love you.

22:26.380 --> 22:41.940
Thanks for watching.
