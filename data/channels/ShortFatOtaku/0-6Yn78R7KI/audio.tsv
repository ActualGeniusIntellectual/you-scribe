0	3440	When I was putting the finishing touches on the Charlottesville video, the Boston rally
3440	4780	started going down.
4780	8300	And my initial reaction was, I've got to do something on this.
8300	11400	And then shortly after, the Phoenix rally thing happened.
11400	13840	And then the Barcelona terror attack went down too.
13840	14840	And then the Charleston shooting.
14840	17120	And then the Buckingham Palace sword attack.
17120	20280	And then the media shat itself to Trump's response to Hurricane Matthew.
20280	21880	Holy shit, it's hard to keep up.
21880	25920	I could do a play-by-play of each event, if people really wanted me to.
25920	27160	Like I did with Charlottesville.
27160	29820	Show the big happenings, analyze them, give my take.
29820	33240	But frankly, there's a lot of people out there that have done so already, with varying
33240	34740	degrees of competency.
34740	37420	Ranging from far better than me to far worse.
37420	40060	I think there's something bigger here that we have to discuss though.
40060	43180	Something that links all these seemingly disparate events together.
43180	47100	I'll still do some analysis, but I want to discuss the big picture for a minute.
47100	49420	Let's talk about the theory of Howland's Spheres.
49420	54200	Daniel Howland, in his book The Uncensored War, devised a theory that divides all political
54200	56340	discourse into three concentric circles.
56340	59940	The inner circle, known as the sphere of consensus, contains all knowledge in which
59940	63800	there is widespread agreement, or at least the perception of widespread agreement.
63800	67660	Within this first sphere, journalists feel free to invoke a generalized we when discussing
67660	71200	their points of view, and often take for granted shared values and assumptions.
71200	75300	The middle circle, known as the sphere of controversy, is where rational and informed
75300	77580	people regularly hold differing views on a topic.
77580	81380	To an ethical journalist, these topics are therefore the most important to cover, and
81380	84340	also the most important to remain unbiased about in their coverage.
84340	87660	In order to present an objective as possible view of the situation to the public.
87660	92500	The outer circle, known as the sphere of deviance, is basically the place where bad stories go
92500	93500	to die.
93500	96820	This is the realm of topics that journalists generally do not discuss at all, either because
96820	101340	they are obviously false or unfounded, they're taboo, or they're so insignificant that
101340	102660	they're simply not newsworthy.
102660	107840	If these topics ever are discussed, they're specifically framed as ridiculous, dangerous,
107840	109380	or in some other way, marginal.
109380	113340	Here's a simplistic example of the spheres in action, and I'll use the Nazis because
113340	116140	they're going to be coming up in this video more than a few times.
116140	120060	The claim, Nazis are bad, directly falls within the sphere of consensus.
120060	124700	The majority of people agree that Nazis are in fact bad, to the point that you don't
124700	128680	really need to explain why they're bad anymore when writing an article on Nazis.
128680	133860	To contrast, the phrase, Hitler did nothing wrong, and no I don't mean the meme you
133860	138220	see everywhere on the internet, I mean an actual serious interpretation of that phrase,
138220	139860	belongs within the sphere of deviance.
139860	144640	You're very rarely going to see this interpretation of Hitler in the media, and when you do, it's
144640	149660	going to be used to showcase the danger or insanity of a subject on the fringes of society.
149660	155300	Meanwhile, a hypothetical article titled, say, Neo-Nazis hold Unite the Right rally
155300	158220	in Charlottesville, sits within the sphere of controversy.
158220	162220	The title itself invokes the Nazis are bad assumption from the sphere of consensus, and
162220	166100	this invocation implies that the article will not be taking the stance that Hitler did nothing
166100	168420	wrong from the sphere of deviance.
168460	172620	Basically, the outer circle consists of topics that must never be discussed, and the inner
172620	177220	circle consists of topics that can be discussed but rarely are, simply because they're considered
177220	178220	to be common sense.
178220	180260	Now, why am I bringing all this up?
180260	184300	Because Hellen's spheres accurately represents the way in which journalists see the world,
184300	188420	and as the individual journalists or even specific outlets and organizations change,
188420	190920	the contents of the three spheres also change.
190920	195860	For example, where left-wing outlets like Salon or Vice or whatever are more than willing
195860	200660	to blanket every single attendee of Unite the Right as a neo-nazi, a right-wing outlet
200660	205600	like, say, Fox News, may be more willing to call them alt-right instead of neo-nazi, or
205600	209660	mention that multiple different factions of people, some with very different sets of goals
209660	212600	and visions, all attended Unite the Right.
212600	218060	So the statement, not everybody at Unite the Right was a neo-nazi, sits cleanly within
218060	221980	the sphere of deviance for left-leaning publications and journalists, but is actually within the
221980	226300	sphere of controversy for centrist and right-leaning publications and journalists.
226300	229020	Keep this idea in mind, we'll be coming back to it a bit later.
229020	231940	Let's check out what the Boston rally actually was.
231940	234980	Thousands march in Boston in protest of controversial rally.
234980	239160	Thousands of counter-demonstrators march Sunday in downtown Boston in a largely peaceful response
239160	243300	to a self-described free speech rally that had sparked concerns of possible violence.
243300	247620	It's clear today that Boston stood for peace and love, not bigotry and hate, the Boston
247620	248620	mayor said.
248620	252380	On the embedded video in this CNN article, the news ticker reads,
252380	256280	Tense scenes erupt in Boston as thousands march against hate.
256280	257820	And the crowd was very large.
257820	259940	ABC caught an aerial view of these counter-protesters.
259940	262900	And it looks like thousands of them are flooding the streets.
262900	265480	But let's try and get some footage shot by people on the ground, I'm sure we can dig
265480	266480	some up.
266480	271540	Evan McMurry, working for ABC, got ahold of an enlightening video shot by a drone regarding
271540	272640	the crowd size.
272640	276340	He says, this is the first video I've seen that really shows the disparity between the
276340	280540	quote, free speech rally, and the thousands of counter-demonstrators.
280540	284940	It doesn't sound like he's taking a neutral opinion on this one, guys.
284940	286340	Why do you think that could be?
286340	290500	At least, in the video, we can see that the Boston police actually set up barricades,
290500	294000	preventing the counter-protesters from approaching the park's rotunda, where a gathering of
294000	299760	what was estimated to be about 30 people showed up to protest such hateful topics as Massantos
299760	304900	genetically modified food, black lives actually mattering, and the views of a local candidate
304900	307920	running for office using the hashtag, shiva4senate.
307920	313340	That shiva guy, by the way, is Dr. Shiva Ayadurai, and he uploaded his speech at the Boston Free
313340	315260	Speech Rally to his YouTube channel.
315260	316260	Here's a few choice bits.
316260	317260	They tried to stop us today, didn't they?
317260	318260	But, you know, we weren't cowed down.
318260	328260	And I will always stand up for all of you, and all of us here, in many ways, are true
328260	329260	patriots.
329260	333340	Because we, in spite of that noise out there, we're here to stand up for something very
333340	335820	fundamental, which is called free speech.
335820	340340	And let me tell you that they tried to prevent me from coming here, as you may have heard
340340	341340	in the media.
341340	346300	They asked me why I associated myself with all of you guys, even though they have no
346300	348580	idea who you or we are.
348580	350580	Let me remind you about Joe Biden.
350580	355860	He's a guy who said Obama, which many of those people support, is the first clean, quote
355860	358300	unquote clean and articulate black man.
358300	359300	He's a racist.
359300	361580	But no one asked about that, did they?
361580	366220	Hillary Clinton stereotyped and mocked my people, Indians.
366220	371340	You can go see the YouTube video, in a very offensive manner, just go look at it.
371340	374300	She mocked Mahatma Gandhi, who's one of the icons of Indians.
374300	378780	You see, you won't find a lot of Indians like me here, because my parents were considered
378780	379780	low caste.
379780	383700	Lower caste than most of those people out there, who don't even know what it means to
383700	384700	be that.
384700	388980	The establishment is what's infested with racists, not us.
388980	390620	I don't see any racists here.
390660	393380	Yeah, this guy just seems like a fucking Nazi, doesn't he?
393380	395900	He probably put an armband on right after the video ended.
395900	397980	But wait, what the fuck is this?
397980	399940	Who's this cleric Larper in the background?
399940	405460	Well, it turns out they're from the Healing Church, otherwise known as THC, and they
405460	407100	have something to add to this rally.
407100	416700	You should look at the Healing Church on Facebook, and I'm like, I outrank Pope Francis.
416700	422780	I'm the Hebrew-Catholic Trump, to which it's grand, it's attached.
422780	426140	They're not fascists, or Nazis, they're just hippies.
426140	431900	That's the tree of life, oh lord, the tree of life.
431900	434300	I'm just looking at it.
434300	435980	One moment, this is a prayer service.
435980	438380	Oh, sorry, sorry.
438380	445340	You and me, come to the church.
445580	447500	They're just a bunch of fucking hippies, man.
447500	451780	Are these the insane white supremacists you thousands of morons came to fight?
451780	453180	A bunch of peace pipers?
453180	455580	That's not gonna stop Antifa, oh no.
455580	459700	One guy got stabbed in the hand, because he's got a neo-nazi haircut like Richard Spencer,
459700	462380	and so therefore he must also be a neo-nazi.
462380	464140	Never mind that it's just a fucking haircut.
464140	468500	Never mind that this style was all the rage with male hipsters and SJWs under one year
468500	469500	ago.
469500	473820	Never mind that closed-minded conservatives would attack long-haired male hippies back
473820	476660	in the 70s with the exact same fucking logic.
476660	480500	Here's an independent journalist, Jessica Weese, who covered the counterprotest.
480500	484460	Tensions high, I was just surrounded by activists who screamed at me, called me a traitor for
484460	486820	asking a man in a Trump hat why he was here.
486820	490780	So when a journalist decides to actually ask for the point of view of public enemy number
490780	496340	one, the Trump supporter, the mega hat wearer, the conservative, they're traitors now?
496340	500540	It really seems like Antifa and the left in a more general sense want complete control
500540	502040	over the media narrative.
502040	505080	Here's an elderly woman holding the American flag at a rally.
505080	509440	Here's an Antifa thug dragging her across the park, solely because she's showing her
509440	537760	patriotism in public.
537760	541280	Here's some angry protesters demanding of a heavily tattooed man his opinions on white
541280	562620	people before another guy comes up behind him and sucker punches him behind the ear.
562620	565240	Never mind that there's no proof this guy was actually a Nazi.
565240	568280	Never mind that even if he was, he wasn't being violent.
568280	573200	Here's Joey Salads, who went undercover as part of Antifa's infamous black blocs,
573200	577160	in order to capture abuses committed by the protesters, abuses which include the unprovoked
577160	581040	assault of an innocent Trump supporter who was simply walking down the street.
581040	584920	Here's an Antifa member demanding a woman take off her shirt, because the shirt in question
584920	609980	has a logo on it that he considers to be oppressive.
609980	612420	Damn dude if you want to see some titties they're all over the internet.
612420	613420	Give it a break.
613420	617100	Here's a picture from the Boston Globe of counter protesters attacking a free speech
617100	621380	demonstrator, complete with the phrase free speech in quotes in the byline, letting us
621380	626020	all know that the Globe's position is that these people aren't really free speech advocates,
626020	627020	just neo-Nazis.
627020	631500	Here's a woman who's holding a sign stating that she disagrees with both Antifa and neo-Nazis,
631500	634600	but supports freedom of speech for those groups as a matter of principle.
634600	637660	An Antifa twitter, by the way, has since doxxed her for this.
637660	642020	Here's a member of the Boston Antifa network named Kevin, claiming that the stabbing of
642020	670060	a police horse is justified because the horse is racist.
670060	688400	Yeah, I wish I was making this insane shit up guys.
688400	694600	So a quick recap of Boston, a free speech rally held by hippies and stoners and Indian
694600	704040	politicians speaking truth to power, gets crashed by thousands of violent protesters
704040	708880	wearing black masks and carrying weapons, who proceed to attack innocent people and
708880	710300	cause property damage.
710300	711880	It really makes you think, you know.
711880	717220	It's almost like Antifa, the anti-fascist group, are the actual fascists.
717220	720300	But let's bring back the theory of Holland Spheres for a second and look at some of these
720300	722200	events with that framework in mind.
722200	726840	Remember CNN's news ticker, tense scenes erupt in Boston as thousands march against
726840	727840	hate?
727840	733120	CNN has very clearly defined the Boston counter protest as a march against hate, and by implication,
733120	735720	the free speech rally as a rally for hate.
735720	740680	Therefore the statement, the Boston rally was a rally for hate, sits within CNN's
740680	741680	sphere of consensus.
741680	743960	The sphere where things are simply taken for granted.
743960	748160	There was no debate on whether or not the Boston rally really was a rally for hate.
748160	750280	It was simply assumed that it was.
750280	754240	Even though the Boston free speech rally was clearly not attended by hateful people.
754240	758020	Even though to anybody who paid attention, the statement, the Boston rally is a rally
758020	761440	for hate, would very obviously sit within the sphere of deviance.
761440	766440	But against logic, reason, and the facts of the situation, CNN put it in the sphere of
766440	767440	consensus.
767440	770800	When Jessica Weis decided to ask a Trump supporter what his motive was at the rally, she was
770800	773200	making a public declaration as a journalist.
773200	777620	She was stating that the idea that Trump supporters may have legitimate grievances, and may exercise
777620	781220	their rights to peacefully protest about those grievances, exists within the sphere
781220	782220	of controversy.
782220	787580	That it is not to be immediately dismissed, nor immediately assumed, but it is to be discussed.
787580	791500	And she was accosted for it, because these people want that idea to be within the sphere
791500	792500	of deviance.
792500	796380	And this brings me to my larger point, Holland's spheres, as a theory, doesn't just apply
796380	797380	to journalism.
797380	802420	It applies to all human interaction, and it accurately describes how Antifa, and its supporters,
802420	805100	are attempting to manipulate popular opinion of these events.
805100	809100	For example, let's say five computer programmers are discussing a topic related to computer
809100	810100	programming.
810100	813020	They don't need to explain the basics of computer programming to each other every time
813020	816740	they have a conversation, even though that stuff is obviously necessary knowledge to
816740	818460	be able to understand the conversation.
818460	822420	The basics of computer programming exist within the sphere of consensus in this example.
822420	826700	However, if a professor of computer programming is teaching a classroom of first years how
826700	832260	to program, the basics of computer programming are not within the sphere of consensus, but
832260	833980	within the sphere of controversy.
833980	838280	In an interpersonal sense, you can think of the sphere of consensus to be the context
838280	839700	of any given situation.
839700	842940	If you have it, you can adequately understand the arguments to come.
842940	845980	And without it, what comes next will simply be meaningless to you.
845980	847280	Here's another example.
847280	849280	Say you have two separate friend groups.
849280	851540	In one group, racist humor is appreciated.
851540	853180	In another group, it is frowned upon.
853180	856560	In the first group, racist humor is situated within the sphere of controversy.
856560	859580	And in the second group, it is situated within the sphere of deviance.
859580	863820	And these classifications still stem from the sphere of consensus, the context of that
863820	864820	friend group.
864820	867880	In the first group, the sphere of consensus consists of knowing that nobody in the group
867880	869380	is actually racist.
869380	873340	In the second group, the sphere of consensus consists of not finding any racist joke funny
873340	874340	as principal.
874340	877860	Holland's Spheres, in my opinion, is an accurate representation of how any grouping
877860	881780	of people larger than one self-polices its language and thoughts.
881780	887040	Any friend group, organization, news outlet, website, government, workplace, protest, or
887040	891160	any other collective of people, can have its opinions and ideas modeled by Holland's
891160	892160	Spheres.
892160	895000	And the contents and sizes of these spheres are not universal.
895000	898880	When two separate groups with two very different models of Holland's Spheres encounter each
898880	901480	other, they clash on ideological grounds.
901480	903760	This is, say, Antifa and the Alt-Right.
903760	908160	However, sometimes a subgroup within a larger parent group will try to force the parent
908160	910820	group's spheres to more resemble the subgroups.
910820	913160	This is Antifa and the American Electorate.
913160	917600	In other words, this is Antifa forcing its ideas, its views, and its definitions onto
917600	922120	the rest of the US citizenry that doesn't necessarily share those ideas, views, or definitions.
922120	925900	And the theory of Holland's Spheres show us how Antifa is attempting to control not
925900	931520	only what may or may not be discussed, aka the spheres of controversy and deviance respectively,
931520	935320	but also the context of any given situation, aka the sphere of consensus.
935320	937460	They don't even hide this anymore.
937460	941880	On RefuseFascism.org, Antifa has announced a November 4th national conference.
941880	943600	Check out the language used in this flyer.
943600	948160	It's time to get serious about driving the Trump-slash-Pence regime from power.
948160	949400	This nightmare must end.
949400	951220	The Trump-Pence regime must go.
951220	954800	In the name of humanity, we refuse to accept the fascist America.
954800	959000	Now, has the past nine months of Trump in the Oval Office been a nightmare?
959000	960240	Well, no.
960240	961240	Not really.
961240	962240	It hasn't been great.
962240	965500	I'm sure some people on the right are happy, some people on the left are not.
965500	967860	But it hasn't been this dystopian nightmare.
967860	971500	Do these people have the authority to declare anything in the name of humanity?
971500	974300	No, and yet they do with conviction.
974300	975780	Is America fascist?
975780	979580	Well, no, Trump was elected through a legitimate process.
979580	980680	That doesn't seem to matter.
980680	982980	Is any of this reflective of reality?
982980	987860	No, and yet that's the language they use and the ideas they hold.
987860	992720	Dystopian nightmare, fascist America, and Trump regime are ideas within their sphere
992720	997300	of consensus, and they plan to make it within everybody else's spheres of consensus too
997300	999060	by any means necessary.
999060	1002740	Are you still not convinced this is a language war as well as a physical one?
1002740	1005820	Check out Boston Antifa's Facebook post on the counter protest.
1005820	1012260	There is no room for capitalists, conservatives, libertarians, classical liberals, or supporters
1012260	1014680	of the US Constitution in our city.
1014680	1015860	You must leave.
1015860	1017460	Hashtag Boston resist.
1017460	1021560	All of these ideas they've just listed off, they're all the same to them, despite being
1021560	1023300	radically different ideas.
1023300	1026260	In the minds of Antifa members, they're all strung together because they're all
1026260	1027820	within the sphere of deviance.
1027820	1029780	That's their only uniting trait.
1029780	1032500	I know, this all sounds a little bit out there sometimes.
1032500	1035740	But with Hallen's spheres in mind, take a look at the headlines that came out after
1035740	1038160	Boston and Charlotte's villain Phoenix.
1038160	1042900	Unmasking the leftist Antifa movement, activists seek peace through violence.
1042900	1044840	Antifa is short for anti-fascists.
1044840	1047900	Their main goal is disrupting neo-Nazis and white supremacists.
1047900	1049640	Seeking peace through violence.
1049640	1050820	Peace through violence.
1050820	1055180	It's insane to think that CNN would be apologizing this fucking hard for people who start street
1055180	1058260	battles at peaceful protests, but here we are.
1058260	1063020	Neo-Nazi violence, even neo-Nazi speech, exists within the sphere of deviance for CNN.
1063020	1064460	But Antifa violence?
1064460	1065460	Sphere of controversy.
1065460	1067300	Let's give that one a fair shake.
1067300	1070660	CNN eventually changed the subtitle of the article and scrubbed it of all peace through
1070660	1071940	violence references.
1071940	1075080	Presumably after they realized that the rest of the world didn't actually share their
1075080	1080580	ideological bent on the subject, but they didn't edit their Facebook posts or video.
1080580	1081700	Because they're idiots.
1081700	1084220	Check out CNN's coverage of Phoenix, too.
1084220	1100820	So, Antifa's violence, sphere of controversy, Trump's speech being angry, sphere of consensus.
1100820	1102340	Are you seeing a pattern yet?
1102340	1106380	When the alt-right uses domestic violence imagery to make a mockery of Antifa, the BBC
1106380	1111020	is more concerned with the smearing of Antifa's public image than it is of the accuracy of
1111020	1115540	the alt-right's mockery, which is very telling considering Antifa's actual tendency
1115540	1118500	to attack anybody that disagrees with them, including women.
1118500	1122060	The Huffington Post put out an article stating that being a soldier will turn you into a
1122060	1123060	racist.
1123060	1126780	The Guardian considers rational centrists to be the true ideologues, presumably for
1126780	1128860	not adhering to leftist ideology.
1128860	1130560	And here's the hottest take yet.
1130560	1134580	Charles Barkley is a great example of a black white supremacist.
1134580	1138380	I know this is going beyond Antifa now and into general regressive left bullshit, but
1138380	1141220	I want to make sure this point gets across to you as clearly as possible.
1141220	1144340	Here's a diagram of the Holland Spheres for average everyday people.
1144340	1148020	Here's a diagram of the Holland Spheres for the violent minority known as Antifa.
1148020	1150580	And they're sympathizing mouthpieces within the mainstream media.
1150580	1151820	Do you see the difference?
1151820	1155480	Do you see how many fewer ideas are within the sphere of controversy?
1155480	1159420	More ideas that they consider to be ideologically in line with them are within the sphere of
1159420	1160420	consensus.
1160420	1164420	It's not even worth debating those ones, they're universally good and true, and you
1164420	1165940	should just accept that.
1165940	1169660	Additionally, more ideas that they consider to be ideologically opposed to them are within
1169660	1170660	the sphere of deviance.
1170660	1174780	They're evil, and false, and only worth talking about negatively, and if you disagree
1174780	1177300	in any way, you must be evil and false too.
1177300	1181580	It's my opinion that if you graph out the sum of all the ideas of any echo chamber into
1181580	1185780	a set of Holland Spheres, you're going to get a large inner circle, and even larger
1185780	1189100	outer circle, with very little room for debate in the middle.
1189100	1192260	I would say that this is indicative of an intellectually unhealthy group.
1192300	1196980	A free society would have a much larger middle sphere, reflecting its tendency to use rational
1196980	1198980	discourse to settle matters of debate.
1198980	1203660	So when the next Boston or Phoenix protest happens, when the next Barcelona or Charleston
1203660	1208400	attack goes down, and you start to read or listen or watch various news sources, keep
1208400	1210220	an eye on Holland Spheres.
1210220	1213740	What are they simply assuming to be commonly held positions that you disagree with?
1213740	1217500	What are they going out of their way to reference negatively, or twisting themselves into pretzels
1217500	1218700	in order to excuse?
1218700	1222580	Pay just as much attention to those things as to what they're actually saying, if not
1222580	1223580	more so.
1223580	1227300	And as for you Antifa, your revolution's not going to work if you think you can actually
1227300	1231420	call for a time out during a battle in order to get your fucking service dog.
1248700	1267480	Thanks for watching everybody, sorry this one's a little late, I like to do these once
1267480	1270500	a week generally and I know it's been longer than that since Charlottesville.
1270500	1273820	My real problem was I didn't want to do just another surface level run down of the Boston
1273820	1277020	events, and I struggled a bit trying to find the angle I wanted to take.
1277020	1280040	It was actually by chance that I discovered Holland's theory of the spheres of public
1280040	1282900	discourse, and I realized that it fit in with the topic really well.
1282900	1286500	If somebody were attempting to manipulate popular opinion on a larger scale using the
1286500	1289780	media, the changing contents of the spheres would be a good way to get that point across
1289780	1291380	in a visual sense.
1291380	1294620	Thanks to everybody who supports me on Patreon, you guys help keep these videos flowing.
1294620	1299620	If you want to keep up with what I do, I post generalized project schedules over at facebook.com
1299620	1304500	slash sfotaku and specific releases as well as a lot of other bullshit over at twitter.com
1304500	1305500	slash sharpheadotaku.
1305500	1309460	There's also a discord channel where I chat with people regularly, links in the description.
1309460	1315140	I also maintain a gaming channel over at youtube.com slash c slash no talent gaming, and I stream
1315140	1318740	around four times a week at twitch.tv slash shortheadotaku.
1318740	1320900	Alright pals, that about wraps it up for me.
1320900	1346380	I love you.
1346380	1361940	Thanks for watching.
