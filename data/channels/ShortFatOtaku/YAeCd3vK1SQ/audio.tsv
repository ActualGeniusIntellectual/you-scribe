0	4500	So yesterday was Thanksgiving. Not for me, I'm Canadian, we have our Thanksgiving in October.
4500	10500	But in the States, it was all about turkeys and pumpkin pie and visits with family members people don't usually get to see all that much.
10500	15500	And if you're even remotely different from the rest of the family, in temperament or hobby or whatever,
15500	17500	I'm guessing you can relate to this scene.
17500	22000	Well, well, look who decided to leave their cave today. Yeah, fuck you two.
22000	27000	I'll take a wild guess that you, like me, remember exactly what this was like.
27000	32500	Or maybe you're young enough to be experiencing it for yourself right now, in which case, let me assure you, it gets better.
32500	38500	At the very least, when you move out, you can do whatever you like, even if it means avoiding these family get-togethers. Like I do.
38500	46000	But this ritual, this reoccurrence of the family's black sheep being mocked publicly simply for reminding people that they exist,
46000	51000	I'd wager that we all know what that feels like, and that we've all thought to ourselves at one point or another,
51000	56000	yeah, I'm in my cave because being alone in there is better than being out here with you.
56000	60000	I mean, say what you want about gamers, it's pretty clear that they want to be left alone to game,
60000	65000	and not actively turn awkward social situations into ideological fights.
65000	67000	That's what social justice warriors do, though.
67000	73500	Every year, around Thanksgiving, and to a lesser extent, other holidays, like clockwork, these articles come out.
73500	76500	How to have a conversation with your angry uncle over Thanksgiving.
76500	80500	You're morally obligated to call out your racist relatives at Thanksgiving.
80500	84000	The annual dinner is the perfect time for uncomfortable conversation.
84000	87000	Fun ways to come out to your shitty family this Thanksgiving.
87000	92500	When I was younger, I'd hide away with my Nintendo 64 and avoid the family because they were all religious right types.
92500	98500	But man, if I were a kid nowadays, I'd be hiding away with my PlayStation 4 to avoid the SJWs.
98500	106500	In any case, it's no surprise that social-justicy type people would actively try to turn the one day of peace that the family might get into a warzone.
106500	112500	It's all a part of that postmodernist, deconstructionist garbage, where nothing has any inherent value,
112500	117500	it's all a brutal power structure, and every human interaction ever is simply a game of conflict.
117500	124500	Lovely people to eat dinner with, but instead of your racist uncle complaining that you've brought your black girlfriend to the table,
124500	128500	soon enough it'll be your progressive aunt ranting about your whiteness or the patriarchy.
128500	133000	These articles are preaching to their own crowds, but in a very specific way.
133000	138000	They're written from the point of view of a young coastal elite, as all of these columnists tend to be,
138000	141500	having to make the arduous journey back to their flyover state home town,
141500	146500	and for a short time during the holidays, lower themselves to visiting with the hinterland savages.
146500	154000	And just so the point gets across, if you're not living in places like LA or New York, these articles consider you as one of the savages.
154000	158000	We need more people standing up to racism and bigotry than ever before, because guess what?
158000	162500	The racists aren't worried about offending us, so why are we worried about offending them?
162500	168000	Well, if your goal isn't family peace, you shouldn't be worried about offending them, privileged HuffPo writer.
168000	173000	However, considering that your camp wants to make giving offense a part of hate speech laws,
173000	179000	maybe you should give up your attempts to be edgy little shits around the dinner table, unless you want to find yourself guilty of a hate crime.
179000	185000	All of this garbage is an extension of Anita Sarkeesian's everything is sexist, everything is racist nonsense,
185000	193000	where there can be no fun, no happiness, no celebration, no reprieve, just the eternal hunt for all things problematic in society.
193000	194500	And why wouldn't it be this way?
194500	201500	These people are attacking conservative politicians and celebrities when they go out to eat, go to work, or even at their homes.
201500	204500	Why wouldn't they take a giant shit on the holidays?
204500	212000	As long as the SJWs consider the totality of the human experience to be a vicious power struggle between ideologies, then this will never ever stop.
212500	215000	Speaking of Anita, what does she have to say about this?
215000	221500	Hey feminist killjoys, this episode is going to be a quick one, because we know you're dying to get back to slap fighting with your older brother,
221500	226500	napping on your childhood twin bed, and pretending to go to the store for more ice so you can smoke in your car.
226500	232000	Jesus, you sound like someone who is nearly 40 and has yet to discover what truly makes them happy in life.
232000	238500	Don't just leave the room when your racist uncle says something offensive, make sure he and everyone around you knows why you're leaving the room.
238500	245000	Look him in the eye and say, that was incredibly racist. Then get up and leave. Maybe knock something off the table as you go.
245000	251000	Yes, absolutely. Be completely selfish. Make sure everyone knows you're raising a gigantic stink over nothing.
251000	254500	Make all of your relatives count the seconds until you're back on the plane to LA.
254500	258500	Recognize that keeping the peace is just code for emotional manipulation.
258500	265500	You don't owe it to your racist uncle to let him spew hot garbage over the dressing and sweet potato pie just because your mom doesn't want any drama at the table.
265500	267500	No free dinner is worth that.
267500	275000	If you thought I was exaggerating when I said that social justice warriors consider the totality of the human experience to be a power struggle, well, here you go.
275000	279500	Enlist the non-terrible members of your family in challenging your racist uncle with you.
279500	287500	Why are you the only one who has to make a stand? Tell your sister to pause the DVR on the football game, back you up, and act like a decent human being for once.
287500	294000	And if there are no non-terrible members of your family that you can join forces with, why are you even still wasting your precious air miles on them?
294000	298500	Why not start a new holiday tradition with that friend who's staying at home drinking boxed wine?
298500	305500	If you are such an entitled shitbag that no one can even stand you, then unite with a fellow single cat lady and share your sorrows.
305500	309500	Okay, I've devoted enough of this video to Anita. She's not even relevant anymore, so fuck it.
309500	316000	My point is, Thanksgiving may be over, but Christmas is around the corner, and it's only going to get worse as time goes on.
316000	326500	There are many legitimate reasons to cut family off. They could be abusive, or they could be legitimately racist, to the point that if you're in an interracial relationship, they go out of their way to shit on your partner.
326500	334500	There are also many legitimate reasons to just let people's minor faults slide for a weekend, because you only see them once a year and the stakes just aren't that high.
334500	342000	Not every offense is worth declaring war over. Microaggressions are just a stupid idea, but don't sit on the fence about it like a pussy either.
342000	350500	Don't huff off during the family party and cause a big scene and ruin everyone else's night, just so you can gobble up all those attention points. Either keep the peace or don't show up.
350500	355500	That's why, when I was a kid, I just didn't leave my cave at all. Smash Brothers was calling.
355500	358500	And that's why, as an adult, I generally don't go back home either.
358500	363500	Smash Brothers Ultimate in two weeks, guys. I'll see you over on my Twitch channel. I love you.
