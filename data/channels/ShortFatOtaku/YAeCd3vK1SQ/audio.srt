00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,500
So yesterday was Thanksgiving. Not for me, I'm Canadian, we have our Thanksgiving in October.

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:10,500
But in the States, it was all about turkeys and pumpkin pie and visits with family members people don't usually get to see all that much.

3
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:15,500
And if you're even remotely different from the rest of the family, in temperament or hobby or whatever,

4
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:17,500
I'm guessing you can relate to this scene.

5
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:22,000
Well, well, look who decided to leave their cave today. Yeah, fuck you two.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
I'll take a wild guess that you, like me, remember exactly what this was like.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,500
Or maybe you're young enough to be experiencing it for yourself right now, in which case, let me assure you, it gets better.

8
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:38,500
At the very least, when you move out, you can do whatever you like, even if it means avoiding these family get-togethers. Like I do.

9
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:46,000
But this ritual, this reoccurrence of the family's black sheep being mocked publicly simply for reminding people that they exist,

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I'd wager that we all know what that feels like, and that we've all thought to ourselves at one point or another,

11
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,000
yeah, I'm in my cave because being alone in there is better than being out here with you.

12
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I mean, say what you want about gamers, it's pretty clear that they want to be left alone to game,

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
and not actively turn awkward social situations into ideological fights.

14
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
That's what social justice warriors do, though.

15
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:13,500
Every year, around Thanksgiving, and to a lesser extent, other holidays, like clockwork, these articles come out.

16
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:16,500
How to have a conversation with your angry uncle over Thanksgiving.

17
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:20,500
You're morally obligated to call out your racist relatives at Thanksgiving.

18
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:24,000
The annual dinner is the perfect time for uncomfortable conversation.

19
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Fun ways to come out to your shitty family this Thanksgiving.

20
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,500
When I was younger, I'd hide away with my Nintendo 64 and avoid the family because they were all religious right types.

21
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:38,500
But man, if I were a kid nowadays, I'd be hiding away with my PlayStation 4 to avoid the SJWs.

22
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:46,500
In any case, it's no surprise that social-justicy type people would actively try to turn the one day of peace that the family might get into a warzone.

23
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:52,500
It's all a part of that postmodernist, deconstructionist garbage, where nothing has any inherent value,

24
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:57,500
it's all a brutal power structure, and every human interaction ever is simply a game of conflict.

25
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:04,500
Lovely people to eat dinner with, but instead of your racist uncle complaining that you've brought your black girlfriend to the table,

26
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:08,500
soon enough it'll be your progressive aunt ranting about your whiteness or the patriarchy.

27
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:13,000
These articles are preaching to their own crowds, but in a very specific way.

28
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:18,000
They're written from the point of view of a young coastal elite, as all of these columnists tend to be,

29
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,500
having to make the arduous journey back to their flyover state home town,

30
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:26,500
and for a short time during the holidays, lower themselves to visiting with the hinterland savages.

31
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:34,000
And just so the point gets across, if you're not living in places like LA or New York, these articles consider you as one of the savages.

32
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
We need more people standing up to racism and bigotry than ever before, because guess what?

33
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,500
The racists aren't worried about offending us, so why are we worried about offending them?

34
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:48,000
Well, if your goal isn't family peace, you shouldn't be worried about offending them, privileged HuffPo writer.

35
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,000
However, considering that your camp wants to make giving offense a part of hate speech laws,

36
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:59,000
maybe you should give up your attempts to be edgy little shits around the dinner table, unless you want to find yourself guilty of a hate crime.

37
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:05,000
All of this garbage is an extension of Anita Sarkeesian's everything is sexist, everything is racist nonsense,

38
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:13,000
where there can be no fun, no happiness, no celebration, no reprieve, just the eternal hunt for all things problematic in society.

39
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,500
And why wouldn't it be this way?

40
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:21,500
These people are attacking conservative politicians and celebrities when they go out to eat, go to work, or even at their homes.

41
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:24,500
Why wouldn't they take a giant shit on the holidays?

42
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:32,000
As long as the SJWs consider the totality of the human experience to be a vicious power struggle between ideologies, then this will never ever stop.

43
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:35,000
Speaking of Anita, what does she have to say about this?

44
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:41,500
Hey feminist killjoys, this episode is going to be a quick one, because we know you're dying to get back to slap fighting with your older brother,

45
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:46,500
napping on your childhood twin bed, and pretending to go to the store for more ice so you can smoke in your car.

46
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:52,000
Jesus, you sound like someone who is nearly 40 and has yet to discover what truly makes them happy in life.

47
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:58,500
Don't just leave the room when your racist uncle says something offensive, make sure he and everyone around you knows why you're leaving the room.

48
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:05,000
Look him in the eye and say, that was incredibly racist. Then get up and leave. Maybe knock something off the table as you go.

49
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Yes, absolutely. Be completely selfish. Make sure everyone knows you're raising a gigantic stink over nothing.

50
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,500
Make all of your relatives count the seconds until you're back on the plane to LA.

51
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:18,500
Recognize that keeping the peace is just code for emotional manipulation.

52
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:25,500
You don't owe it to your racist uncle to let him spew hot garbage over the dressing and sweet potato pie just because your mom doesn't want any drama at the table.

53
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:27,500
No free dinner is worth that.

54
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:35,000
If you thought I was exaggerating when I said that social justice warriors consider the totality of the human experience to be a power struggle, well, here you go.

55
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,500
Enlist the non-terrible members of your family in challenging your racist uncle with you.

56
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:47,500
Why are you the only one who has to make a stand? Tell your sister to pause the DVR on the football game, back you up, and act like a decent human being for once.

57
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:54,000
And if there are no non-terrible members of your family that you can join forces with, why are you even still wasting your precious air miles on them?

58
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,500
Why not start a new holiday tradition with that friend who's staying at home drinking boxed wine?

59
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:05,500
If you are such an entitled shitbag that no one can even stand you, then unite with a fellow single cat lady and share your sorrows.

60
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:09,500
Okay, I've devoted enough of this video to Anita. She's not even relevant anymore, so fuck it.

61
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:16,000
My point is, Thanksgiving may be over, but Christmas is around the corner, and it's only going to get worse as time goes on.

62
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:26,500
There are many legitimate reasons to cut family off. They could be abusive, or they could be legitimately racist, to the point that if you're in an interracial relationship, they go out of their way to shit on your partner.

63
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:34,500
There are also many legitimate reasons to just let people's minor faults slide for a weekend, because you only see them once a year and the stakes just aren't that high.

64
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:42,000
Not every offense is worth declaring war over. Microaggressions are just a stupid idea, but don't sit on the fence about it like a pussy either.

65
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:50,500
Don't huff off during the family party and cause a big scene and ruin everyone else's night, just so you can gobble up all those attention points. Either keep the peace or don't show up.

66
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:55,500
That's why, when I was a kid, I just didn't leave my cave at all. Smash Brothers was calling.

67
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:58,500
And that's why, as an adult, I generally don't go back home either.

68
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:03,500
Smash Brothers Ultimate in two weeks, guys. I'll see you over on my Twitch channel. I love you.
