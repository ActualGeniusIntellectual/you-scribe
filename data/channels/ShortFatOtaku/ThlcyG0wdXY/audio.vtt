00:00.000 --> 00:06.240
Welcome to SJ Weekly, guys, for this week. I know last week there was a few complaints about the

00:06.240 --> 00:13.840
fact that there was no slurping of the usual daily coffee, so I will of course cut right to the chase.

00:21.680 --> 00:28.240
You know what? If I could, I would always have that first sip of coffee over and over and over

00:28.240 --> 00:32.400
again. It's the best part of coffee. I know this is coming out a day late, I'm very sorry about

00:32.400 --> 00:37.840
that, but it's not like I did nothing yesterday. The January community stream was held on this

00:37.840 --> 00:44.880
channel yesterday. All people who either sub to me on Twitch, on my Twitch channel, or they give

00:44.880 --> 00:49.200
at least five bucks on Patreon, which by the way, you don't have to worry about anymore because

00:49.200 --> 00:53.680
Subscribestar now works, but basically if people financially support the channel, they come on a

00:53.680 --> 00:58.640
voice call with me, and then we watch a movie together, and that was yesterday's stream. So

00:58.640 --> 01:03.280
even though SJ Weekly is a day late, I didn't do nothing yesterday, and in fact we had a lot of fun

01:03.280 --> 01:10.240
watching the fourth and final Channel Awesome movie. It was fucking atrocious. And speaking

01:10.240 --> 01:15.360
of Subscribestar and Patreon, yeah, Subscribestar is actually working, so I'm going to be setting

01:15.360 --> 01:20.400
up the Subscribestar account in the next few days, but it is operational, so if you want to support

01:20.400 --> 01:24.880
the show financially again and you left Patreon and you're looking for a way to do it, you can go

01:24.880 --> 01:31.200
to Subscribestar.com slash shortfidotaku. But let's get on with it. Here's this week's

01:31.200 --> 01:37.680
ridiculous person, ridiculous account. Her name seems to be Hikio Mikado, a real space girl

01:37.680 --> 01:44.400
visiting virtuality. I'm sure you are, darling. Activist against evil. Well, who isn't? I'm a

01:44.400 --> 01:53.760
Christian, I'm a lesbian, I'm ENFJ, I'm Mercurian, social justice warrior, vegetarian,

01:54.480 --> 02:01.040
something in Japanese, and hashtag resist. I'm surprised there's no pronouns in that bio.

02:01.040 --> 02:05.040
So Elizabeth Warren posts something about how, due to the government shutdown,

02:05.600 --> 02:09.920
domestic violence shelters are cutting services due to lack of funding. And I mean, that is a

02:09.920 --> 02:14.320
problem with a prolonged shutdown, is that a lot of services that need funding don't get it,

02:14.320 --> 02:18.240
and that's something that can't be ignored. But Elizabeth Warren, bless her heart, says Donald

02:18.240 --> 02:23.040
Trump and the Republicans are making a choice to keep survivors of domestic abuse in danger

02:23.040 --> 02:28.240
rather than reopen our government. Hashtag Trump shutdown. Maybe you guys should come to the table

02:28.240 --> 02:35.440
and work out a deal on the wall then. You already know what the Republicans want. Try to cut a deal.

02:35.440 --> 02:39.280
Stop being obstructionists. But anyway, here's our terrible account,

02:39.280 --> 02:46.560
hikimikado. Hashtag expel Mitch McConnell and open the government. I don't know if it's quite that

02:46.560 --> 02:52.480
easy. Vote on the budget you already had with bipartisan support. If they actually had bipartisan

02:52.480 --> 02:56.000
support, they would do that. They clearly don't have the support for their budget.

02:57.200 --> 03:04.000
If hashtag traitor Trump vetoes it, override the veto with that same bipartisan support.

03:04.960 --> 03:11.440
Yeah, that's not how it works. You can have enough votes to pass a bill and then when it's vetoed,

03:11.440 --> 03:17.280
you have to have even more votes. It's not just casting the same votes again. I don't think you

03:17.280 --> 03:22.160
understand how your government works. Rescue the 800,000 federal workers that Trump has

03:22.160 --> 03:30.080
held hostage like he's holding a fucking gun to their heads. Hashtag save USA from fascism.

03:31.040 --> 03:36.480
Nothing that's been described in this situation is fascism. In fact, what would be fascism is

03:36.480 --> 03:42.320
ordering a government back to work that did not agree on something. Let's move on to our first

03:42.320 --> 03:48.960
article today on Vox. And right away I notice, where did our ads go? Yeah, I ad blocked them.

03:48.960 --> 03:54.960
Fuck you, Vox. I hope you start firing people too. Social media is rotting democracy from within.

03:55.920 --> 04:00.960
How social platforms enable far right politicians campaigns to undermine democracy.

04:00.960 --> 04:06.560
I can already tell exactly why they're saying this and it's because despite all the terrible

04:06.560 --> 04:10.480
shit social media companies have been doing recently, and they've been doing a lot of

04:10.480 --> 04:19.280
terrible shit, there's still a little bit of impartiality to them. Like I've seen SJWs on

04:19.280 --> 04:26.800
Twitter get fucked by the rules designed to protect SJWs. So very clearly it's not a perfectly

04:26.800 --> 04:33.520
biased system yet. And right now the positions of conservatives are more amenable to the general

04:33.520 --> 04:38.800
population than the positions of leftists. And there's no surprise as to why that is.

04:38.800 --> 04:43.920
It's because the left abandoned liberalism. The left abandoned personal freedom. It abandoned

04:43.920 --> 04:48.960
property rights, freedom of speech. And the right decided to swoop in and claim those things.

04:49.200 --> 04:54.160
Since most people like those things, most people are now starting to go right. And because the

04:54.160 --> 04:58.800
marketplace of social media companies is inherently based in freedom of speech,

04:58.800 --> 05:05.280
even as they try to suppress that speech, there's always going to be a bent towards freedom on any

05:05.280 --> 05:10.240
social media platform. And if it's the conservatives that are taking up that position politically,

05:10.240 --> 05:14.240
they're going to be popular on those social media platforms. It makes complete sense to me.

05:14.240 --> 05:18.640
Even as like, you know, YouTube and Reddit and Facebook and Twitter all start censoring people,

05:19.280 --> 05:24.880
there's still a cry for freedom on those platforms. There's still people finding ways to

05:25.440 --> 05:30.320
work around the rules. There's still people finding ways to fool the algorithms. And at

05:30.320 --> 05:36.160
some point when all of those safety measures, those stopgap measures are closed, the social

05:36.160 --> 05:41.520
media network in question will likely die the same way that Tumblr died. Because to put it plainly,

05:41.520 --> 05:47.600
the people desire freedom, and social media networks offer freedom. And the less freedom

05:47.600 --> 05:52.160
they offer over time, the less popular they're going to be in the long run. But yeah, that's

05:52.160 --> 05:55.680
what this article is likely about. I'm just guessing I haven't even read it yet. But basically

05:55.680 --> 06:02.640
that because the left has abandoned freedom as a political principle, and social networks are

06:02.640 --> 06:09.440
inherently based in freedom, now it turns out that far right politicians campaigns use social media

06:09.440 --> 06:14.000
to undermine democracy. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, they're not undermining democracy,

06:14.000 --> 06:19.360
they're undermining you. At the inauguration of Brazil's new far right president, Bolsonaro in

06:19.360 --> 06:24.560
early January, a crowd of his supporters began a surprising chant. They weren't cheering for

06:24.560 --> 06:29.440
Bolsonaro or his running mate or their party. Instead, they're reciting the names of social

06:29.440 --> 06:34.800
media platforms. Facebook, Facebook, Facebook, the crowd yelled, WhatsApp, WhatsApp, WhatsApp.

06:35.600 --> 06:39.360
They were crediting the platforms with their man's victory, and they aren't entirely wrong.

06:40.000 --> 06:45.680
During the campaign, a conservative pro-business interest group funded a massive disinformation

06:45.680 --> 06:50.960
campaign on WhatsApp. I'm sure it was disinformation only. False and damaging

06:50.960 --> 06:55.360
information about Bolsonaro's left wing opponent, including fake news mocked up to look like

06:55.360 --> 07:00.160
neutral fact checks, spread like wildfire in the run up to the October 8th vote.

07:00.160 --> 07:05.040
This deluge, according to one Brazilian expert, played a role in Bolsonaro's victory.

07:30.160 --> 07:34.560
Social media networks give the plebs a way to voice their concerns,

07:34.560 --> 07:38.640
as well as to group up together in ways that they wouldn't have been able to before the internet,

07:38.640 --> 07:43.360
and spread their ideas. And the people that hold cultural power right now, which are people

07:43.360 --> 07:48.800
on the far left, don't like that. They don't like the plebs speaking up. They simply want to speak

07:48.800 --> 07:54.400
for the plebs. Social media, once seen as a profoundly democratic technology, is increasingly

07:54.480 --> 08:00.640
serving the needs of authoritarians and their allies. No, it just turns out that it's still

08:00.640 --> 08:05.920
a democratic technology, despite how much they're fucking it up. It's just that you are against

08:05.920 --> 08:11.760
democracy now. That's the point. The people are switching away from your political point of view,

08:11.760 --> 08:16.160
so you think that social media networks are to blame. Social media can certainly help

08:16.160 --> 08:21.520
pro-democracy movements at times, but they overall give far-right parties and authoritarians an

08:21.520 --> 08:27.600
advantage. Well, keep in mind that authoritarians can be far-right or far-left. Being a tyrant is

08:27.600 --> 08:35.760
not exclusive to one political stripe. Nazis might be far-right tyrants, and communists might be

08:35.760 --> 08:41.120
far-left tyrants, but they're still tyrants. And I have to ask you this, why do you think that

08:41.120 --> 08:48.160
social media gives far-right parties and authoritarians an advantage, and not far-left

08:48.160 --> 08:54.480
parties and far-left authoritarians an advantage? What's the difference? Why is it that only the

08:54.480 --> 09:00.800
right benefits from social media? Is it because the left can't meme? That's definitely a possibility.

09:00.800 --> 09:07.600
Or is it because far-left extremism is just really unpopular right now, and social media lets people

09:07.600 --> 09:13.040
talk about that? Maybe that's the advantage. I'm sure at some point in the future, far-right

09:13.040 --> 09:17.680
extremism will become unpopular again. Certainly more unpopular than it already is. Because these

09:17.680 --> 09:22.320
things seem to work in a pendulum. And there's going to be people like you, probably at Vox,

09:22.320 --> 09:27.520
applauding social media for allowing young leftists to voice their concerns about the

09:27.520 --> 09:33.760
populist far-right. But right now, because they're against you, they give authoritarians an advantage.

09:33.760 --> 09:38.400
This is just so fucking transparent and disgusting. And you know what? It's on Vox,

09:38.400 --> 09:43.920
so I'm not surprised. Over on the pluralist, we have bikini climber freezes to death on

09:43.920 --> 09:51.680
mountain while waiting for help to arrive. What? A Taiwanese social media star,

09:51.680 --> 09:58.320
known for scaling mountains in the semi-nude, was found dead after falling into a 100-foot

09:58.320 --> 10:06.640
deep gulch on Monday. The day before, 36-year-old Gigi Wu, known online as the bikini climber,

10:06.640 --> 10:11.920
had tumbled into a ravine in Yushan National Park, where she tried to scale the country's tallest

10:11.920 --> 10:17.360
summit, Taiwan News reported. Her leg was injured by the fall, Wu immediately called a friend and

10:17.360 --> 10:22.400
reported her location to the best of her ability. Yet it took security forces more than 24 hours to

10:22.400 --> 10:28.160
locate her, by which time she was already dead from hyperthermia. Maybe you shouldn't... I know

10:28.160 --> 10:32.480
it's a bit too late to talk about this now, Jesus Christ, but maybe you shouldn't climb mountains in

10:32.480 --> 10:37.840
a fucking bikini. I get it, that's your thing, right? You're going to be a social media star,

10:37.840 --> 10:41.680
you're going to have a gimmick, there's your gimmick, be a good looking girl, climb mountains

10:41.680 --> 10:47.680
in a bikini, I understand, but maybe it wasn't worth fucking dying for. While daredevil tragedies

10:47.680 --> 10:52.560
are nothing new, the promise of social media exposure has enticed many inexperienced attention

10:52.560 --> 10:59.440
mongers into taking on increasingly dangerous and sometimes deadly challenges. Examples transcend

10:59.440 --> 11:06.560
age and country. A Romanian teen who caught fire after trying to take a selfie on top of a running

11:06.560 --> 11:13.440
train. V, V is that you buddy? On the BBC news we have speedboat killer Jack Sheppard,

11:13.440 --> 11:20.800
Georgia link confirmed. There's a speedboat killer? Okay, let's read the article.

11:20.800 --> 11:25.440
Police in Georgia have confirmed that they are working with the Met police to track a fugitive

11:25.440 --> 11:33.200
who was convicted of killing his date in a speedboat crash on the Thames. He killed his date

11:33.920 --> 11:41.040
okay and in a speedboat crash like maybe I mean if if the speedboat crashed does that really

11:41.040 --> 11:45.760
mean that you killed your your date if you crashed your speedboat like I don't I don't know how it

11:45.760 --> 11:51.040
works I know that in a car like if you do you do you if you're driving a car and you and you like

11:51.040 --> 11:56.640
accidentally get into a crash in your car are you are you held liable for murder if a passenger

11:56.640 --> 12:02.880
also died like I don't know maybe it doesn't necessarily seem right but I don't I don't know

12:02.880 --> 12:06.960
Jack Sheppard 31 was sentenced to six years in July for the manslaughter of 24 year old

12:06.960 --> 12:13.520
Charlotte Brown however he was absent from his trial after fleeing the UK in March and he he

12:13.520 --> 12:19.520
went to Georgia so he just he just made bail and ran okay Sheppard made his first appearance at the

12:19.520 --> 12:25.520
old Bailey on 26th of January where he entered a not guilty plea to a charge of manslaughter by

12:25.520 --> 12:32.720
gross negligence okay so he wasn't murder manslaughter by gross negligence he was somehow

12:32.720 --> 12:37.760
negligent what actually happened in the event though after meeting on the dating website

12:37.760 --> 12:45.040
okcupid Sheppard took Miss Brown on a date on the 8th of December 2015 he spent 150 pounds on wine

12:45.040 --> 12:49.920
and food at a restaurant in the shard before taking Miss Brown on a speedboat he claimed he

12:49.920 --> 12:56.640
owned okay here's here's the map of their little speedboat trip one they board the speedboat at

12:56.640 --> 13:03.440
Hammersmith bridge two Jack Sheppard drives the boat at speeds of 26 to 34 knots I don't know if

13:03.440 --> 13:08.400
that's too fast like I don't I don't know anything about boats and they drives it to three so he

13:08.400 --> 13:16.880
drives all the way up to when Westminster bridge turns around oh at four around Battersea bridge

13:16.880 --> 13:19.520
Charlotte Brown takes control of the boat

13:22.160 --> 13:29.280
and at five near the plantation wharf the boat veers left and hits a submerged submerged object

13:30.240 --> 13:33.840
Miss Brown and Sheppard were thrown from the boat when it hit branches in the water

13:35.680 --> 13:39.440
Sheppard was found clinging to the hull and Miss Brown was pulled from the water

13:39.440 --> 13:45.840
unconscious and unresponsive a post-mortem examination found she died from cold water

13:45.840 --> 13:51.200
immersion hold on a minute if if she took the control of the boat at four

13:51.200 --> 13:58.560
isn't she responsible for her own death like what why is he a speedboat killer he wasn't even

13:58.560 --> 14:04.640
driving the boat like if if she wanted to drive and he handed the control of the boat over to her

14:05.680 --> 14:12.240
and then she crashes the boat killing herself and almost killing the guy why is he the killer

14:12.960 --> 14:19.280
why is he somehow responsible even through gross negligence are women not considered full adults

14:19.280 --> 14:24.880
in the UK maybe he fled to Georgia because he knew that as shitty as the UK is right now he

14:24.880 --> 14:29.920
wasn't going to get a fair fucking trial and speaking of the UK being shitty it was revealed

14:29.920 --> 14:35.840
that dozens of girls subjected to breast ironing in the UK perpetrators consider it a traditional

14:35.840 --> 14:42.800
measure to stop unwanted male attention an African practice of ironing a girl's chest with

14:42.800 --> 14:49.200
a hot stone to delay breast formation is spreading in the UK with anecdotal evidence of dozens of

14:49.200 --> 14:56.320
recent cases community workers in London Yorkshire Essex and the West Midlands have told the Guardian

14:56.320 --> 15:01.440
of cases in which preteen girls from the diaspora of several African countries are subjected to the

15:01.440 --> 15:07.120
painful abuse of an ultimately futile practice you know if you're gonna import people from

15:07.120 --> 15:12.800
from wildly different cultures than than your own this might be a good reason as to why there

15:12.800 --> 15:19.600
should be an impetus that they assimilate into your culture it is fine if African people move

15:19.600 --> 15:27.600
to the UK to become British it's fine if Middle Eastern people move to the UK to become British

15:27.600 --> 15:32.720
if they want to keep doing the same bullshit that turned their countries into dusty shitholes

15:32.720 --> 15:38.400
in the first place they should probably fucking stay there you can call me a racist all you want

15:38.400 --> 15:45.520
I do not want to see preteen girls have their chests fucking ironed in the UK or in Canada or

15:45.520 --> 15:51.680
the States or in any other first world nation where we have moved beyond this type of stupid

15:51.680 --> 15:56.240
barbarism one woman living in the suburbs of an English city told the Guardian how she went about

15:56.240 --> 16:01.120
ironing her daughter's chest at the first sign of puberty I took the stone I warmed it and then I

16:01.120 --> 16:06.640
started massaging my daughter's chest and then the stone was a little bit hot when I started

16:06.640 --> 16:11.840
massaging she said mommy it's hot the child developed bruising and the mother was eventually

16:11.840 --> 16:17.440
questioned by police before being released with a caution just with a caution guys you can't

16:17.440 --> 16:22.480
actually arrest her because this is her beautiful native culture you can't actually arrest her for

16:22.480 --> 16:28.160
fucking child abuse because it seems that no matter what the only thing that British police

16:28.160 --> 16:35.920
do is give out cautions that's all they do when something is way too serious and pretty much

16:35.920 --> 16:41.040
requires somebody being thrown in jail for the rest of their fucking lives they get a caution

16:41.040 --> 16:48.000
but also when somebody does absolutely nothing wrong they still get a caution it's cautions

16:48.000 --> 16:54.240
for everyone in the UK UK man details run in with Britain's thought police no crime has been

16:54.240 --> 17:01.120
committed but I need to check your thinking no you don't the police do not need to check your

17:01.120 --> 17:06.400
thinking they do not need to check my thinking until I break the law the police can fuck off

17:06.400 --> 17:13.520
at some point I'm gonna have to do a video on just how shitty the UK is because I keep seeing

17:13.520 --> 17:18.320
more and more of these ridiculous stories and things do not seem to be getting better

17:18.320 --> 17:23.680
a former police officer in the UK has had his thoughts checked by police claiming to

17:23.680 --> 17:29.680
represent the LGBTQ community Humberside police tracked Harry Miller to his place of work

17:29.680 --> 17:35.120
after acquiring 30 tweets including a number of limericks that he had liked from his personal

17:35.120 --> 17:40.400
account he liked them that's the problem he pressed the fucking like button on twitter

17:40.400 --> 17:46.240
according to the officer Miller had not committed a hate crime by liking the tweets but the event

17:46.240 --> 17:51.920
was still to be recorded as a hate incident they really are watching fucking everything at this

17:51.920 --> 17:57.760
point are they after being subject to a 30-minute police inquiry Miller was warned to watch his

17:57.760 --> 18:03.920
words or risk losing his job as potential LGBTQ employees would not have a safe space if they

18:03.920 --> 18:08.560
decided to work for Miller following the incident Miller posted a series of tweets detailing the

18:08.560 --> 18:13.360
account got a call from director saying cops wanted to speak to me he had sense not to give

18:13.360 --> 18:18.880
out my number but he said but he said he'd pass on details I rang spoke to PC from Humberside

18:18.880 --> 18:24.240
introduces himself as representing the LGBTQ community on a report of hate speech by me

18:25.040 --> 18:30.320
they found me via my company had been all over the website and decided if I employed trans people at

18:30.320 --> 18:35.280
all it was not a safe place for them and work should know the cops said he was in possession

18:35.280 --> 18:41.680
of 30 tweets by me I asked if any contained criminal material he said no I asked if any

18:41.680 --> 18:48.080
came close to being criminal and he read me a limerick honestly a limerick a cop read me

18:48.080 --> 18:54.720
a limerick over the phone I said I didn't write that he said ah but you liked it and promoted it

18:55.920 --> 19:01.520
I asked why he was wasting his time on a non-crime he said it's not a crime but it will be

19:01.520 --> 19:06.800
recorded as a hate incident so I've added to a statistic even though there is no crime which

19:06.800 --> 19:11.520
brings me to my next point I asked how could there be a victim if as he's established there was no

19:11.520 --> 19:17.840
crime he said that's just how it works my comment was that by framing the complainant as a victim

19:17.840 --> 19:23.680
this made me by default a criminal I asked him to desist from using it this is where it gets

19:23.680 --> 19:28.160
incredibly sinister the cop told me that he needed to speak with me because even though I'd committed

19:28.160 --> 19:34.800
no crime whatsoever he needed and I quote to check my thinking he said sometimes a woman's

19:34.800 --> 19:39.840
brain grows a man's body in the womb and that's what transgender is you can imagine my response

19:40.400 --> 19:45.920
lastly he told me that I needed to watch my words more carefully or I was at risk of being sacked by

19:45.920 --> 19:50.160
the company for hate speech at which point I wished him well and said I needed to go rinse

19:50.160 --> 19:55.280
my socks according to humberside police a hate crime is anything that you think might have been

19:55.280 --> 20:00.720
motivated by hostility or prejudice to become a victim of a hate crime you don't even need to be

20:00.720 --> 20:05.760
the target you simply have to witness somebody being targeted and you're granted victim status

20:06.640 --> 20:15.200
this is ridiculous this needs to fucking stop period this is something that everybody has an

20:15.200 --> 20:20.720
obligation to oppose this will be how the new tyranny of the 21st century is built

20:21.360 --> 20:26.560
through bullshit like this and we can thank the sjws for popularizing it and far left

20:26.560 --> 20:33.760
politicians for empowering the state to act on this bullshit it has to stop all right guys I'm

20:33.760 --> 20:40.560
