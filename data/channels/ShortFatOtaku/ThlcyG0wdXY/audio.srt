00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,240
Welcome to SJ Weekly, guys, for this week. I know last week there was a few complaints about the

2
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:13,840
fact that there was no slurping of the usual daily coffee, so I will of course cut right to the chase.

3
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:28,240
You know what? If I could, I would always have that first sip of coffee over and over and over

4
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:32,400
again. It's the best part of coffee. I know this is coming out a day late, I'm very sorry about

5
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:37,840
that, but it's not like I did nothing yesterday. The January community stream was held on this

6
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:44,880
channel yesterday. All people who either sub to me on Twitch, on my Twitch channel, or they give

7
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:49,200
at least five bucks on Patreon, which by the way, you don't have to worry about anymore because

8
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:53,680
Subscribestar now works, but basically if people financially support the channel, they come on a

9
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:58,640
voice call with me, and then we watch a movie together, and that was yesterday's stream. So

10
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:03,280
even though SJ Weekly is a day late, I didn't do nothing yesterday, and in fact we had a lot of fun

11
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:10,240
watching the fourth and final Channel Awesome movie. It was fucking atrocious. And speaking

12
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:15,360
of Subscribestar and Patreon, yeah, Subscribestar is actually working, so I'm going to be setting

13
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:20,400
up the Subscribestar account in the next few days, but it is operational, so if you want to support

14
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:24,880
the show financially again and you left Patreon and you're looking for a way to do it, you can go

15
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:31,200
to Subscribestar.com slash shortfidotaku. But let's get on with it. Here's this week's

16
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:37,680
ridiculous person, ridiculous account. Her name seems to be Hikio Mikado, a real space girl

17
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:44,400
visiting virtuality. I'm sure you are, darling. Activist against evil. Well, who isn't? I'm a

18
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:53,760
Christian, I'm a lesbian, I'm ENFJ, I'm Mercurian, social justice warrior, vegetarian,

19
00:01:54,480 --> 00:02:01,040
something in Japanese, and hashtag resist. I'm surprised there's no pronouns in that bio.

20
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:05,040
So Elizabeth Warren posts something about how, due to the government shutdown,

21
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:09,920
domestic violence shelters are cutting services due to lack of funding. And I mean, that is a

22
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:14,320
problem with a prolonged shutdown, is that a lot of services that need funding don't get it,

23
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:18,240
and that's something that can't be ignored. But Elizabeth Warren, bless her heart, says Donald

24
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:23,040
Trump and the Republicans are making a choice to keep survivors of domestic abuse in danger

25
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:28,240
rather than reopen our government. Hashtag Trump shutdown. Maybe you guys should come to the table

26
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:35,440
and work out a deal on the wall then. You already know what the Republicans want. Try to cut a deal.

27
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:39,280
Stop being obstructionists. But anyway, here's our terrible account,

28
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:46,560
hikimikado. Hashtag expel Mitch McConnell and open the government. I don't know if it's quite that

29
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:52,480
easy. Vote on the budget you already had with bipartisan support. If they actually had bipartisan

30
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:56,000
support, they would do that. They clearly don't have the support for their budget.

31
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:04,000
If hashtag traitor Trump vetoes it, override the veto with that same bipartisan support.

32
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:11,440
Yeah, that's not how it works. You can have enough votes to pass a bill and then when it's vetoed,

33
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:17,280
you have to have even more votes. It's not just casting the same votes again. I don't think you

34
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:22,160
understand how your government works. Rescue the 800,000 federal workers that Trump has

35
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:30,080
held hostage like he's holding a fucking gun to their heads. Hashtag save USA from fascism.

36
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:36,480
Nothing that's been described in this situation is fascism. In fact, what would be fascism is

37
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:42,320
ordering a government back to work that did not agree on something. Let's move on to our first

38
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:48,960
article today on Vox. And right away I notice, where did our ads go? Yeah, I ad blocked them.

39
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:54,960
Fuck you, Vox. I hope you start firing people too. Social media is rotting democracy from within.

40
00:03:55,920 --> 00:04:00,960
How social platforms enable far right politicians campaigns to undermine democracy.

41
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:06,560
I can already tell exactly why they're saying this and it's because despite all the terrible

42
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:10,480
shit social media companies have been doing recently, and they've been doing a lot of

43
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:19,280
terrible shit, there's still a little bit of impartiality to them. Like I've seen SJWs on

44
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:26,800
Twitter get fucked by the rules designed to protect SJWs. So very clearly it's not a perfectly

45
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:33,520
biased system yet. And right now the positions of conservatives are more amenable to the general

46
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:38,800
population than the positions of leftists. And there's no surprise as to why that is.

47
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:43,920
It's because the left abandoned liberalism. The left abandoned personal freedom. It abandoned

48
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:48,960
property rights, freedom of speech. And the right decided to swoop in and claim those things.

49
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:54,160
Since most people like those things, most people are now starting to go right. And because the

50
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:58,800
marketplace of social media companies is inherently based in freedom of speech,

51
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:05,280
even as they try to suppress that speech, there's always going to be a bent towards freedom on any

52
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:10,240
social media platform. And if it's the conservatives that are taking up that position politically,

53
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:14,240
they're going to be popular on those social media platforms. It makes complete sense to me.

54
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:18,640
Even as like, you know, YouTube and Reddit and Facebook and Twitter all start censoring people,

55
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:24,880
there's still a cry for freedom on those platforms. There's still people finding ways to

56
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:30,320
work around the rules. There's still people finding ways to fool the algorithms. And at

57
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:36,160
some point when all of those safety measures, those stopgap measures are closed, the social

58
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:41,520
media network in question will likely die the same way that Tumblr died. Because to put it plainly,

59
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:47,600
the people desire freedom, and social media networks offer freedom. And the less freedom

60
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:52,160
they offer over time, the less popular they're going to be in the long run. But yeah, that's

61
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:55,680
what this article is likely about. I'm just guessing I haven't even read it yet. But basically

62
00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:02,640
that because the left has abandoned freedom as a political principle, and social networks are

63
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:09,440
inherently based in freedom, now it turns out that far right politicians campaigns use social media

64
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:14,000
to undermine democracy. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, they're not undermining democracy,

65
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:19,360
they're undermining you. At the inauguration of Brazil's new far right president, Bolsonaro in

66
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:24,560
early January, a crowd of his supporters began a surprising chant. They weren't cheering for

67
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:29,440
Bolsonaro or his running mate or their party. Instead, they're reciting the names of social

68
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:34,800
media platforms. Facebook, Facebook, Facebook, the crowd yelled, WhatsApp, WhatsApp, WhatsApp.

69
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:39,360
They were crediting the platforms with their man's victory, and they aren't entirely wrong.

70
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:45,680
During the campaign, a conservative pro-business interest group funded a massive disinformation

71
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:50,960
campaign on WhatsApp. I'm sure it was disinformation only. False and damaging

72
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:55,360
information about Bolsonaro's left wing opponent, including fake news mocked up to look like

73
00:06:55,360 --> 00:07:00,160
neutral fact checks, spread like wildfire in the run up to the October 8th vote.

74
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:05,040
This deluge, according to one Brazilian expert, played a role in Bolsonaro's victory.

75
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:34,560
Social media networks give the plebs a way to voice their concerns,

76
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:38,640
as well as to group up together in ways that they wouldn't have been able to before the internet,

77
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:43,360
and spread their ideas. And the people that hold cultural power right now, which are people

78
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:48,800
on the far left, don't like that. They don't like the plebs speaking up. They simply want to speak

79
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:54,400
for the plebs. Social media, once seen as a profoundly democratic technology, is increasingly

80
00:07:54,480 --> 00:08:00,640
serving the needs of authoritarians and their allies. No, it just turns out that it's still

81
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:05,920
a democratic technology, despite how much they're fucking it up. It's just that you are against

82
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:11,760
democracy now. That's the point. The people are switching away from your political point of view,

83
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:16,160
so you think that social media networks are to blame. Social media can certainly help

84
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:21,520
pro-democracy movements at times, but they overall give far-right parties and authoritarians an

85
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:27,600
advantage. Well, keep in mind that authoritarians can be far-right or far-left. Being a tyrant is

86
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:35,760
not exclusive to one political stripe. Nazis might be far-right tyrants, and communists might be

87
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:41,120
far-left tyrants, but they're still tyrants. And I have to ask you this, why do you think that

88
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:48,160
social media gives far-right parties and authoritarians an advantage, and not far-left

89
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:54,480
parties and far-left authoritarians an advantage? What's the difference? Why is it that only the

90
00:08:54,480 --> 00:09:00,800
right benefits from social media? Is it because the left can't meme? That's definitely a possibility.

91
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:07,600
Or is it because far-left extremism is just really unpopular right now, and social media lets people

92
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:13,040
talk about that? Maybe that's the advantage. I'm sure at some point in the future, far-right

93
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:17,680
extremism will become unpopular again. Certainly more unpopular than it already is. Because these

94
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:22,320
things seem to work in a pendulum. And there's going to be people like you, probably at Vox,

95
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:27,520
applauding social media for allowing young leftists to voice their concerns about the

96
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:33,760
populist far-right. But right now, because they're against you, they give authoritarians an advantage.

97
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:38,400
This is just so fucking transparent and disgusting. And you know what? It's on Vox,

98
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:43,920
so I'm not surprised. Over on the pluralist, we have bikini climber freezes to death on

99
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:51,680
mountain while waiting for help to arrive. What? A Taiwanese social media star,

100
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:58,320
known for scaling mountains in the semi-nude, was found dead after falling into a 100-foot

101
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:06,640
deep gulch on Monday. The day before, 36-year-old Gigi Wu, known online as the bikini climber,

102
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:11,920
had tumbled into a ravine in Yushan National Park, where she tried to scale the country's tallest

103
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:17,360
summit, Taiwan News reported. Her leg was injured by the fall, Wu immediately called a friend and

104
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:22,400
reported her location to the best of her ability. Yet it took security forces more than 24 hours to

105
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:28,160
locate her, by which time she was already dead from hyperthermia. Maybe you shouldn't... I know

106
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:32,480
it's a bit too late to talk about this now, Jesus Christ, but maybe you shouldn't climb mountains in

107
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:37,840
a fucking bikini. I get it, that's your thing, right? You're going to be a social media star,

108
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:41,680
you're going to have a gimmick, there's your gimmick, be a good looking girl, climb mountains

109
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:47,680
in a bikini, I understand, but maybe it wasn't worth fucking dying for. While daredevil tragedies

110
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:52,560
are nothing new, the promise of social media exposure has enticed many inexperienced attention

111
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:59,440
mongers into taking on increasingly dangerous and sometimes deadly challenges. Examples transcend

112
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:06,560
age and country. A Romanian teen who caught fire after trying to take a selfie on top of a running

113
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:13,440
train. V, V is that you buddy? On the BBC news we have speedboat killer Jack Sheppard,

114
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:20,800
Georgia link confirmed. There's a speedboat killer? Okay, let's read the article.

115
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:25,440
Police in Georgia have confirmed that they are working with the Met police to track a fugitive

116
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:33,200
who was convicted of killing his date in a speedboat crash on the Thames. He killed his date

117
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:41,040
okay and in a speedboat crash like maybe I mean if if the speedboat crashed does that really

118
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:45,760
mean that you killed your your date if you crashed your speedboat like I don't I don't know how it

119
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:51,040
works I know that in a car like if you do you do you if you're driving a car and you and you like

120
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:56,640
accidentally get into a crash in your car are you are you held liable for murder if a passenger

121
00:11:56,640 --> 00:12:02,880
also died like I don't know maybe it doesn't necessarily seem right but I don't I don't know

122
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:06,960
Jack Sheppard 31 was sentenced to six years in July for the manslaughter of 24 year old

123
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:13,520
Charlotte Brown however he was absent from his trial after fleeing the UK in March and he he

124
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:19,520
went to Georgia so he just he just made bail and ran okay Sheppard made his first appearance at the

125
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:25,520
old Bailey on 26th of January where he entered a not guilty plea to a charge of manslaughter by

126
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:32,720
gross negligence okay so he wasn't murder manslaughter by gross negligence he was somehow

127
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:37,760
negligent what actually happened in the event though after meeting on the dating website

128
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:45,040
okcupid Sheppard took Miss Brown on a date on the 8th of December 2015 he spent 150 pounds on wine

129
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:49,920
and food at a restaurant in the shard before taking Miss Brown on a speedboat he claimed he

130
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:56,640
owned okay here's here's the map of their little speedboat trip one they board the speedboat at

131
00:12:56,640 --> 00:13:03,440
Hammersmith bridge two Jack Sheppard drives the boat at speeds of 26 to 34 knots I don't know if

132
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:08,400
that's too fast like I don't I don't know anything about boats and they drives it to three so he

133
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:16,880
drives all the way up to when Westminster bridge turns around oh at four around Battersea bridge

134
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:19,520
Charlotte Brown takes control of the boat

135
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:29,280
and at five near the plantation wharf the boat veers left and hits a submerged submerged object

136
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:33,840
Miss Brown and Sheppard were thrown from the boat when it hit branches in the water

137
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:39,440
Sheppard was found clinging to the hull and Miss Brown was pulled from the water

138
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:45,840
unconscious and unresponsive a post-mortem examination found she died from cold water

139
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:51,200
immersion hold on a minute if if she took the control of the boat at four

140
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:58,560
isn't she responsible for her own death like what why is he a speedboat killer he wasn't even

141
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:04,640
driving the boat like if if she wanted to drive and he handed the control of the boat over to her

142
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:12,240
and then she crashes the boat killing herself and almost killing the guy why is he the killer

143
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:19,280
why is he somehow responsible even through gross negligence are women not considered full adults

144
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:24,880
in the UK maybe he fled to Georgia because he knew that as shitty as the UK is right now he

145
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:29,920
wasn't going to get a fair fucking trial and speaking of the UK being shitty it was revealed

146
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:35,840
that dozens of girls subjected to breast ironing in the UK perpetrators consider it a traditional

147
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:42,800
measure to stop unwanted male attention an African practice of ironing a girl's chest with

148
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:49,200
a hot stone to delay breast formation is spreading in the UK with anecdotal evidence of dozens of

149
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:56,320
recent cases community workers in London Yorkshire Essex and the West Midlands have told the Guardian

150
00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:01,440
of cases in which preteen girls from the diaspora of several African countries are subjected to the

151
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:07,120
painful abuse of an ultimately futile practice you know if you're gonna import people from

152
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:12,800
from wildly different cultures than than your own this might be a good reason as to why there

153
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:19,600
should be an impetus that they assimilate into your culture it is fine if African people move

154
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:27,600
to the UK to become British it's fine if Middle Eastern people move to the UK to become British

155
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:32,720
if they want to keep doing the same bullshit that turned their countries into dusty shitholes

156
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:38,400
in the first place they should probably fucking stay there you can call me a racist all you want

157
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:45,520
I do not want to see preteen girls have their chests fucking ironed in the UK or in Canada or

158
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:51,680
the States or in any other first world nation where we have moved beyond this type of stupid

159
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:56,240
barbarism one woman living in the suburbs of an English city told the Guardian how she went about

160
00:15:56,240 --> 00:16:01,120
ironing her daughter's chest at the first sign of puberty I took the stone I warmed it and then I

161
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:06,640
started massaging my daughter's chest and then the stone was a little bit hot when I started

162
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:11,840
massaging she said mommy it's hot the child developed bruising and the mother was eventually

163
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:17,440
questioned by police before being released with a caution just with a caution guys you can't

164
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:22,480
actually arrest her because this is her beautiful native culture you can't actually arrest her for

165
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:28,160
fucking child abuse because it seems that no matter what the only thing that British police

166
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:35,920
do is give out cautions that's all they do when something is way too serious and pretty much

167
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:41,040
requires somebody being thrown in jail for the rest of their fucking lives they get a caution

168
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:48,000
but also when somebody does absolutely nothing wrong they still get a caution it's cautions

169
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:54,240
for everyone in the UK UK man details run in with Britain's thought police no crime has been

170
00:16:54,240 --> 00:17:01,120
committed but I need to check your thinking no you don't the police do not need to check your

171
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:06,400
thinking they do not need to check my thinking until I break the law the police can fuck off

172
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:13,520
at some point I'm gonna have to do a video on just how shitty the UK is because I keep seeing

173
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:18,320
more and more of these ridiculous stories and things do not seem to be getting better

174
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:23,680
a former police officer in the UK has had his thoughts checked by police claiming to

175
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:29,680
represent the LGBTQ community Humberside police tracked Harry Miller to his place of work

176
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:35,120
after acquiring 30 tweets including a number of limericks that he had liked from his personal

177
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:40,400
account he liked them that's the problem he pressed the fucking like button on twitter

178
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:46,240
according to the officer Miller had not committed a hate crime by liking the tweets but the event

179
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:51,920
was still to be recorded as a hate incident they really are watching fucking everything at this

180
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:57,760
point are they after being subject to a 30-minute police inquiry Miller was warned to watch his

181
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:03,920
words or risk losing his job as potential LGBTQ employees would not have a safe space if they

182
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:08,560
decided to work for Miller following the incident Miller posted a series of tweets detailing the

183
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:13,360
account got a call from director saying cops wanted to speak to me he had sense not to give

184
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:18,880
out my number but he said but he said he'd pass on details I rang spoke to PC from Humberside

185
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:24,240
introduces himself as representing the LGBTQ community on a report of hate speech by me

186
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:30,320
they found me via my company had been all over the website and decided if I employed trans people at

187
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:35,280
all it was not a safe place for them and work should know the cops said he was in possession

188
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:41,680
of 30 tweets by me I asked if any contained criminal material he said no I asked if any

189
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:48,080
came close to being criminal and he read me a limerick honestly a limerick a cop read me

190
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:54,720
a limerick over the phone I said I didn't write that he said ah but you liked it and promoted it

191
00:18:55,920 --> 00:19:01,520
I asked why he was wasting his time on a non-crime he said it's not a crime but it will be

192
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:06,800
recorded as a hate incident so I've added to a statistic even though there is no crime which

193
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:11,520
brings me to my next point I asked how could there be a victim if as he's established there was no

194
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:17,840
crime he said that's just how it works my comment was that by framing the complainant as a victim

195
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:23,680
this made me by default a criminal I asked him to desist from using it this is where it gets

196
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:28,160
incredibly sinister the cop told me that he needed to speak with me because even though I'd committed

197
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:34,800
no crime whatsoever he needed and I quote to check my thinking he said sometimes a woman's

198
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:39,840
brain grows a man's body in the womb and that's what transgender is you can imagine my response

199
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:45,920
lastly he told me that I needed to watch my words more carefully or I was at risk of being sacked by

200
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:50,160
the company for hate speech at which point I wished him well and said I needed to go rinse

201
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:55,280
my socks according to humberside police a hate crime is anything that you think might have been

202
00:19:55,280 --> 00:20:00,720
motivated by hostility or prejudice to become a victim of a hate crime you don't even need to be

203
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:05,760
the target you simply have to witness somebody being targeted and you're granted victim status

204
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:15,200
this is ridiculous this needs to fucking stop period this is something that everybody has an

205
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:20,720
obligation to oppose this will be how the new tyranny of the 21st century is built

206
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:26,560
through bullshit like this and we can thank the sjws for popularizing it and far left

207
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:33,760
politicians for empowering the state to act on this bullshit it has to stop all right guys I'm
