0	6240	Welcome to SJ Weekly, guys, for this week. I know last week there was a few complaints about the
6240	13840	fact that there was no slurping of the usual daily coffee, so I will of course cut right to the chase.
21680	28240	You know what? If I could, I would always have that first sip of coffee over and over and over
28240	32400	again. It's the best part of coffee. I know this is coming out a day late, I'm very sorry about
32400	37840	that, but it's not like I did nothing yesterday. The January community stream was held on this
37840	44880	channel yesterday. All people who either sub to me on Twitch, on my Twitch channel, or they give
44880	49200	at least five bucks on Patreon, which by the way, you don't have to worry about anymore because
49200	53680	Subscribestar now works, but basically if people financially support the channel, they come on a
53680	58640	voice call with me, and then we watch a movie together, and that was yesterday's stream. So
58640	63280	even though SJ Weekly is a day late, I didn't do nothing yesterday, and in fact we had a lot of fun
63280	70240	watching the fourth and final Channel Awesome movie. It was fucking atrocious. And speaking
70240	75360	of Subscribestar and Patreon, yeah, Subscribestar is actually working, so I'm going to be setting
75360	80400	up the Subscribestar account in the next few days, but it is operational, so if you want to support
80400	84880	the show financially again and you left Patreon and you're looking for a way to do it, you can go
84880	91200	to Subscribestar.com slash shortfidotaku. But let's get on with it. Here's this week's
91200	97680	ridiculous person, ridiculous account. Her name seems to be Hikio Mikado, a real space girl
97680	104400	visiting virtuality. I'm sure you are, darling. Activist against evil. Well, who isn't? I'm a
104400	113760	Christian, I'm a lesbian, I'm ENFJ, I'm Mercurian, social justice warrior, vegetarian,
114480	121040	something in Japanese, and hashtag resist. I'm surprised there's no pronouns in that bio.
121040	125040	So Elizabeth Warren posts something about how, due to the government shutdown,
125600	129920	domestic violence shelters are cutting services due to lack of funding. And I mean, that is a
129920	134320	problem with a prolonged shutdown, is that a lot of services that need funding don't get it,
134320	138240	and that's something that can't be ignored. But Elizabeth Warren, bless her heart, says Donald
138240	143040	Trump and the Republicans are making a choice to keep survivors of domestic abuse in danger
143040	148240	rather than reopen our government. Hashtag Trump shutdown. Maybe you guys should come to the table
148240	155440	and work out a deal on the wall then. You already know what the Republicans want. Try to cut a deal.
155440	159280	Stop being obstructionists. But anyway, here's our terrible account,
159280	166560	hikimikado. Hashtag expel Mitch McConnell and open the government. I don't know if it's quite that
166560	172480	easy. Vote on the budget you already had with bipartisan support. If they actually had bipartisan
172480	176000	support, they would do that. They clearly don't have the support for their budget.
177200	184000	If hashtag traitor Trump vetoes it, override the veto with that same bipartisan support.
184960	191440	Yeah, that's not how it works. You can have enough votes to pass a bill and then when it's vetoed,
191440	197280	you have to have even more votes. It's not just casting the same votes again. I don't think you
197280	202160	understand how your government works. Rescue the 800,000 federal workers that Trump has
202160	210080	held hostage like he's holding a fucking gun to their heads. Hashtag save USA from fascism.
211040	216480	Nothing that's been described in this situation is fascism. In fact, what would be fascism is
216480	222320	ordering a government back to work that did not agree on something. Let's move on to our first
222320	228960	article today on Vox. And right away I notice, where did our ads go? Yeah, I ad blocked them.
228960	234960	Fuck you, Vox. I hope you start firing people too. Social media is rotting democracy from within.
235920	240960	How social platforms enable far right politicians campaigns to undermine democracy.
240960	246560	I can already tell exactly why they're saying this and it's because despite all the terrible
246560	250480	shit social media companies have been doing recently, and they've been doing a lot of
250480	259280	terrible shit, there's still a little bit of impartiality to them. Like I've seen SJWs on
259280	266800	Twitter get fucked by the rules designed to protect SJWs. So very clearly it's not a perfectly
266800	273520	biased system yet. And right now the positions of conservatives are more amenable to the general
273520	278800	population than the positions of leftists. And there's no surprise as to why that is.
278800	283920	It's because the left abandoned liberalism. The left abandoned personal freedom. It abandoned
283920	288960	property rights, freedom of speech. And the right decided to swoop in and claim those things.
289200	294160	Since most people like those things, most people are now starting to go right. And because the
294160	298800	marketplace of social media companies is inherently based in freedom of speech,
298800	305280	even as they try to suppress that speech, there's always going to be a bent towards freedom on any
305280	310240	social media platform. And if it's the conservatives that are taking up that position politically,
310240	314240	they're going to be popular on those social media platforms. It makes complete sense to me.
314240	318640	Even as like, you know, YouTube and Reddit and Facebook and Twitter all start censoring people,
319280	324880	there's still a cry for freedom on those platforms. There's still people finding ways to
325440	330320	work around the rules. There's still people finding ways to fool the algorithms. And at
330320	336160	some point when all of those safety measures, those stopgap measures are closed, the social
336160	341520	media network in question will likely die the same way that Tumblr died. Because to put it plainly,
341520	347600	the people desire freedom, and social media networks offer freedom. And the less freedom
347600	352160	they offer over time, the less popular they're going to be in the long run. But yeah, that's
352160	355680	what this article is likely about. I'm just guessing I haven't even read it yet. But basically
355680	362640	that because the left has abandoned freedom as a political principle, and social networks are
362640	369440	inherently based in freedom, now it turns out that far right politicians campaigns use social media
369440	374000	to undermine democracy. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, they're not undermining democracy,
374000	379360	they're undermining you. At the inauguration of Brazil's new far right president, Bolsonaro in
379360	384560	early January, a crowd of his supporters began a surprising chant. They weren't cheering for
384560	389440	Bolsonaro or his running mate or their party. Instead, they're reciting the names of social
389440	394800	media platforms. Facebook, Facebook, Facebook, the crowd yelled, WhatsApp, WhatsApp, WhatsApp.
395600	399360	They were crediting the platforms with their man's victory, and they aren't entirely wrong.
400000	405680	During the campaign, a conservative pro-business interest group funded a massive disinformation
405680	410960	campaign on WhatsApp. I'm sure it was disinformation only. False and damaging
410960	415360	information about Bolsonaro's left wing opponent, including fake news mocked up to look like
415360	420160	neutral fact checks, spread like wildfire in the run up to the October 8th vote.
420160	425040	This deluge, according to one Brazilian expert, played a role in Bolsonaro's victory.
450160	454560	Social media networks give the plebs a way to voice their concerns,
454560	458640	as well as to group up together in ways that they wouldn't have been able to before the internet,
458640	463360	and spread their ideas. And the people that hold cultural power right now, which are people
463360	468800	on the far left, don't like that. They don't like the plebs speaking up. They simply want to speak
468800	474400	for the plebs. Social media, once seen as a profoundly democratic technology, is increasingly
474480	480640	serving the needs of authoritarians and their allies. No, it just turns out that it's still
480640	485920	a democratic technology, despite how much they're fucking it up. It's just that you are against
485920	491760	democracy now. That's the point. The people are switching away from your political point of view,
491760	496160	so you think that social media networks are to blame. Social media can certainly help
496160	501520	pro-democracy movements at times, but they overall give far-right parties and authoritarians an
501520	507600	advantage. Well, keep in mind that authoritarians can be far-right or far-left. Being a tyrant is
507600	515760	not exclusive to one political stripe. Nazis might be far-right tyrants, and communists might be
515760	521120	far-left tyrants, but they're still tyrants. And I have to ask you this, why do you think that
521120	528160	social media gives far-right parties and authoritarians an advantage, and not far-left
528160	534480	parties and far-left authoritarians an advantage? What's the difference? Why is it that only the
534480	540800	right benefits from social media? Is it because the left can't meme? That's definitely a possibility.
540800	547600	Or is it because far-left extremism is just really unpopular right now, and social media lets people
547600	553040	talk about that? Maybe that's the advantage. I'm sure at some point in the future, far-right
553040	557680	extremism will become unpopular again. Certainly more unpopular than it already is. Because these
557680	562320	things seem to work in a pendulum. And there's going to be people like you, probably at Vox,
562320	567520	applauding social media for allowing young leftists to voice their concerns about the
567520	573760	populist far-right. But right now, because they're against you, they give authoritarians an advantage.
573760	578400	This is just so fucking transparent and disgusting. And you know what? It's on Vox,
578400	583920	so I'm not surprised. Over on the pluralist, we have bikini climber freezes to death on
583920	591680	mountain while waiting for help to arrive. What? A Taiwanese social media star,
591680	598320	known for scaling mountains in the semi-nude, was found dead after falling into a 100-foot
598320	606640	deep gulch on Monday. The day before, 36-year-old Gigi Wu, known online as the bikini climber,
606640	611920	had tumbled into a ravine in Yushan National Park, where she tried to scale the country's tallest
611920	617360	summit, Taiwan News reported. Her leg was injured by the fall, Wu immediately called a friend and
617360	622400	reported her location to the best of her ability. Yet it took security forces more than 24 hours to
622400	628160	locate her, by which time she was already dead from hyperthermia. Maybe you shouldn't... I know
628160	632480	it's a bit too late to talk about this now, Jesus Christ, but maybe you shouldn't climb mountains in
632480	637840	a fucking bikini. I get it, that's your thing, right? You're going to be a social media star,
637840	641680	you're going to have a gimmick, there's your gimmick, be a good looking girl, climb mountains
641680	647680	in a bikini, I understand, but maybe it wasn't worth fucking dying for. While daredevil tragedies
647680	652560	are nothing new, the promise of social media exposure has enticed many inexperienced attention
652560	659440	mongers into taking on increasingly dangerous and sometimes deadly challenges. Examples transcend
659440	666560	age and country. A Romanian teen who caught fire after trying to take a selfie on top of a running
666560	673440	train. V, V is that you buddy? On the BBC news we have speedboat killer Jack Sheppard,
673440	680800	Georgia link confirmed. There's a speedboat killer? Okay, let's read the article.
680800	685440	Police in Georgia have confirmed that they are working with the Met police to track a fugitive
685440	693200	who was convicted of killing his date in a speedboat crash on the Thames. He killed his date
693920	701040	okay and in a speedboat crash like maybe I mean if if the speedboat crashed does that really
701040	705760	mean that you killed your your date if you crashed your speedboat like I don't I don't know how it
705760	711040	works I know that in a car like if you do you do you if you're driving a car and you and you like
711040	716640	accidentally get into a crash in your car are you are you held liable for murder if a passenger
716640	722880	also died like I don't know maybe it doesn't necessarily seem right but I don't I don't know
722880	726960	Jack Sheppard 31 was sentenced to six years in July for the manslaughter of 24 year old
726960	733520	Charlotte Brown however he was absent from his trial after fleeing the UK in March and he he
733520	739520	went to Georgia so he just he just made bail and ran okay Sheppard made his first appearance at the
739520	745520	old Bailey on 26th of January where he entered a not guilty plea to a charge of manslaughter by
745520	752720	gross negligence okay so he wasn't murder manslaughter by gross negligence he was somehow
752720	757760	negligent what actually happened in the event though after meeting on the dating website
757760	765040	okcupid Sheppard took Miss Brown on a date on the 8th of December 2015 he spent 150 pounds on wine
765040	769920	and food at a restaurant in the shard before taking Miss Brown on a speedboat he claimed he
769920	776640	owned okay here's here's the map of their little speedboat trip one they board the speedboat at
776640	783440	Hammersmith bridge two Jack Sheppard drives the boat at speeds of 26 to 34 knots I don't know if
783440	788400	that's too fast like I don't I don't know anything about boats and they drives it to three so he
788400	796880	drives all the way up to when Westminster bridge turns around oh at four around Battersea bridge
796880	799520	Charlotte Brown takes control of the boat
802160	809280	and at five near the plantation wharf the boat veers left and hits a submerged submerged object
810240	813840	Miss Brown and Sheppard were thrown from the boat when it hit branches in the water
815680	819440	Sheppard was found clinging to the hull and Miss Brown was pulled from the water
819440	825840	unconscious and unresponsive a post-mortem examination found she died from cold water
825840	831200	immersion hold on a minute if if she took the control of the boat at four
831200	838560	isn't she responsible for her own death like what why is he a speedboat killer he wasn't even
838560	844640	driving the boat like if if she wanted to drive and he handed the control of the boat over to her
845680	852240	and then she crashes the boat killing herself and almost killing the guy why is he the killer
852960	859280	why is he somehow responsible even through gross negligence are women not considered full adults
859280	864880	in the UK maybe he fled to Georgia because he knew that as shitty as the UK is right now he
864880	869920	wasn't going to get a fair fucking trial and speaking of the UK being shitty it was revealed
869920	875840	that dozens of girls subjected to breast ironing in the UK perpetrators consider it a traditional
875840	882800	measure to stop unwanted male attention an African practice of ironing a girl's chest with
882800	889200	a hot stone to delay breast formation is spreading in the UK with anecdotal evidence of dozens of
889200	896320	recent cases community workers in London Yorkshire Essex and the West Midlands have told the Guardian
896320	901440	of cases in which preteen girls from the diaspora of several African countries are subjected to the
901440	907120	painful abuse of an ultimately futile practice you know if you're gonna import people from
907120	912800	from wildly different cultures than than your own this might be a good reason as to why there
912800	919600	should be an impetus that they assimilate into your culture it is fine if African people move
919600	927600	to the UK to become British it's fine if Middle Eastern people move to the UK to become British
927600	932720	if they want to keep doing the same bullshit that turned their countries into dusty shitholes
932720	938400	in the first place they should probably fucking stay there you can call me a racist all you want
938400	945520	I do not want to see preteen girls have their chests fucking ironed in the UK or in Canada or
945520	951680	the States or in any other first world nation where we have moved beyond this type of stupid
951680	956240	barbarism one woman living in the suburbs of an English city told the Guardian how she went about
956240	961120	ironing her daughter's chest at the first sign of puberty I took the stone I warmed it and then I
961120	966640	started massaging my daughter's chest and then the stone was a little bit hot when I started
966640	971840	massaging she said mommy it's hot the child developed bruising and the mother was eventually
971840	977440	questioned by police before being released with a caution just with a caution guys you can't
977440	982480	actually arrest her because this is her beautiful native culture you can't actually arrest her for
982480	988160	fucking child abuse because it seems that no matter what the only thing that British police
988160	995920	do is give out cautions that's all they do when something is way too serious and pretty much
995920	1001040	requires somebody being thrown in jail for the rest of their fucking lives they get a caution
1001040	1008000	but also when somebody does absolutely nothing wrong they still get a caution it's cautions
1008000	1014240	for everyone in the UK UK man details run in with Britain's thought police no crime has been
1014240	1021120	committed but I need to check your thinking no you don't the police do not need to check your
1021120	1026400	thinking they do not need to check my thinking until I break the law the police can fuck off
1026400	1033520	at some point I'm gonna have to do a video on just how shitty the UK is because I keep seeing
1033520	1038320	more and more of these ridiculous stories and things do not seem to be getting better
1038320	1043680	a former police officer in the UK has had his thoughts checked by police claiming to
1043680	1049680	represent the LGBTQ community Humberside police tracked Harry Miller to his place of work
1049680	1055120	after acquiring 30 tweets including a number of limericks that he had liked from his personal
1055120	1060400	account he liked them that's the problem he pressed the fucking like button on twitter
1060400	1066240	according to the officer Miller had not committed a hate crime by liking the tweets but the event
1066240	1071920	was still to be recorded as a hate incident they really are watching fucking everything at this
1071920	1077760	point are they after being subject to a 30-minute police inquiry Miller was warned to watch his
1077760	1083920	words or risk losing his job as potential LGBTQ employees would not have a safe space if they
1083920	1088560	decided to work for Miller following the incident Miller posted a series of tweets detailing the
1088560	1093360	account got a call from director saying cops wanted to speak to me he had sense not to give
1093360	1098880	out my number but he said but he said he'd pass on details I rang spoke to PC from Humberside
1098880	1104240	introduces himself as representing the LGBTQ community on a report of hate speech by me
1105040	1110320	they found me via my company had been all over the website and decided if I employed trans people at
1110320	1115280	all it was not a safe place for them and work should know the cops said he was in possession
1115280	1121680	of 30 tweets by me I asked if any contained criminal material he said no I asked if any
1121680	1128080	came close to being criminal and he read me a limerick honestly a limerick a cop read me
1128080	1134720	a limerick over the phone I said I didn't write that he said ah but you liked it and promoted it
1135920	1141520	I asked why he was wasting his time on a non-crime he said it's not a crime but it will be
1141520	1146800	recorded as a hate incident so I've added to a statistic even though there is no crime which
1146800	1151520	brings me to my next point I asked how could there be a victim if as he's established there was no
1151520	1157840	crime he said that's just how it works my comment was that by framing the complainant as a victim
1157840	1163680	this made me by default a criminal I asked him to desist from using it this is where it gets
1163680	1168160	incredibly sinister the cop told me that he needed to speak with me because even though I'd committed
1168160	1174800	no crime whatsoever he needed and I quote to check my thinking he said sometimes a woman's
1174800	1179840	brain grows a man's body in the womb and that's what transgender is you can imagine my response
1180400	1185920	lastly he told me that I needed to watch my words more carefully or I was at risk of being sacked by
1185920	1190160	the company for hate speech at which point I wished him well and said I needed to go rinse
1190160	1195280	my socks according to humberside police a hate crime is anything that you think might have been
1195280	1200720	motivated by hostility or prejudice to become a victim of a hate crime you don't even need to be
1200720	1205760	the target you simply have to witness somebody being targeted and you're granted victim status
1206640	1215200	this is ridiculous this needs to fucking stop period this is something that everybody has an
1215200	1220720	obligation to oppose this will be how the new tyranny of the 21st century is built
1221360	1226560	through bullshit like this and we can thank the sjws for popularizing it and far left
1226560	1233760	politicians for empowering the state to act on this bullshit it has to stop all right guys I'm
1233760	1240560	done man it gets more and more disheartening the more videos I make I have to admit oh fuck me
