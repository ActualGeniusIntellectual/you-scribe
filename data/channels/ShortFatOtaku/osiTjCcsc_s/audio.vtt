00:00.000 --> 00:09.600
Maybe I'm just an old man, but I would hope that most of the people currently listening

00:09.600 --> 00:13.120
to this video remember the video game Mortal Panics of the 1990s.

00:13.120 --> 00:15.440
Or at least know about them, I'm not alone right?

00:15.440 --> 00:20.060
You guys must know about how, when the original Mortal Kombat game hit consoles, Nintendo

00:20.060 --> 00:24.800
censored the SNES version of all of its blood and gore, but the overwhelming popularity

00:24.800 --> 00:28.820
of the series on the Genesis and in the arcade led to a congressional hearing on whether

00:28.820 --> 00:32.580
or not content of video games needed to be regulated, considering they were all marketed

00:32.580 --> 00:33.580
at kids.

00:33.580 --> 00:34.860
You guys know about that right?

00:34.860 --> 00:40.240
Or how about when, during that same congressional hearing, Joe Lieberman lambasted Sega for

00:40.240 --> 00:44.820
the game Night Trap, which he said promoted sexual violence against women, while admitting

00:44.820 --> 00:48.660
he never actually played the game, while the game itself was really just you taking the

00:48.660 --> 00:53.820
job of watching security cameras for creepsters, sneaking into a mansion to abduct girls from

00:53.820 --> 00:57.180
a sleepover party, and saving them by triggering traps at the right time?

00:57.180 --> 00:58.300
You know about that right?

00:58.300 --> 01:01.580
You guys didn't just hear about all this watching the internet historian or something

01:01.580 --> 01:02.580
right?

01:02.580 --> 01:05.080
You must remember being a kid and talking about this nonsense at school with your friends

01:05.080 --> 01:06.080
like me.

01:06.080 --> 01:07.180
I'm not just old am I?

01:07.180 --> 01:11.980
A core component of why people like me grew up believing in the very broad tent of left

01:11.980 --> 01:14.100
wing politics is Jack Thompson.

01:14.100 --> 01:18.980
Thompson was a Florida based lawyer who came to prominence going after rappers in the 1990s

01:18.980 --> 01:20.320
from a conservative perspective.

01:20.320 --> 01:24.900
He believed that the excessive violence in rap music qualified as obscene and therefore

01:24.900 --> 01:25.940
needed to be censored.

01:25.940 --> 01:29.460
His attention later shifted to video games, using the same arguments.

01:29.460 --> 01:32.580
In fact, now that I'm talking about it, I'm pretty sure that a good part of why

01:32.580 --> 01:38.020
young politically disengaged gamers believe the right wing was anti-free speech is probably

01:38.020 --> 01:39.020
due to Jack Thompson.

01:39.020 --> 01:43.060
Thompson routinely provided the early internet with amazing quotes and sound bites, and found

01:43.060 --> 01:48.460
himself lampooned in places like Penny Arcade, Game Facts, uh sorry, Sega Sages as it was

01:48.460 --> 01:52.180
known back then, and Newgrounds, which were the closest thing we had to social media at

01:52.180 --> 01:53.180
the time.

01:53.420 --> 01:58.440
Thompson said that they were committing Pearl Harbor 2 due to their widespread popularity.

01:58.440 --> 01:59.440
He also said,

02:13.820 --> 02:18.820
If some whacked out adult wants to spend his time playing Grand Theft Auto Vice City, one

02:18.820 --> 02:23.140
has to wonder why he doesn't get a life, but when it comes to kids, it has a demonstrable

02:23.140 --> 02:27.220
impact on their behavior and the development of the frontal lobes of their brain.

02:27.220 --> 02:31.080
And regarding rumble controllers, which were new at the time, they give you a pleasurable

02:31.080 --> 02:33.700
buzz back into your hands with each kill.

02:33.700 --> 02:39.180
This is operant conditioning, behavior modification right out of BF Skinner's lab.

02:39.180 --> 02:43.180
Thompson would go on to blame multiple school shootings and other murders on video games,

02:43.180 --> 02:47.620
most notably Columbine because one of the shooters owned a copy of the original Doom.

02:47.620 --> 02:51.780
Thompson eventually destroyed himself by repeatedly filing frivolous lawsuits to the Florida court

02:51.780 --> 02:56.020
surrounding these topics, and was eventually disbarred in 2008, to the widespread cheer

02:56.020 --> 02:57.780
and laughter of everybody.

02:57.780 --> 03:01.140
And by the way, one of those lawsuits was against Midway, the company that actually

03:01.140 --> 03:05.040
creates the Mortal Kombat games, not because of Mortal Kombat's violence, but because the

03:05.040 --> 03:09.700
character creator in Mortal Kombat Armageddon allowed people to create any character they

03:09.700 --> 03:14.460
like, and gamers were overwhelmingly creating Jack Thompsons in the game to kick the shit

03:14.460 --> 03:15.460
out of him.

03:15.460 --> 03:19.900
But despite Thompson fading away into the anals of gaming history, that didn't stop

03:19.900 --> 03:22.020
the moral panic surrounding video games.

03:22.020 --> 03:27.980
Back when Mass Effect 1 came out, the infamous right-wing news outlet Fox News ran a hitpiece

03:27.980 --> 03:33.180
on the game, claiming it promoted lesbianism to your children because Liara, a blue alien

03:33.180 --> 03:39.060
whose species only consists of women, could engage in what looks like, by human standards,

03:39.060 --> 03:42.700
lesbian sex with a player character if you chose to play as a woman.

03:42.700 --> 03:47.780
BioWare, the developer, would massively trim down the same-sex romance options in the game's

03:47.780 --> 03:52.960
sequel Mass Effect 2, and the people behind the game outright admitted in early 2021 that

03:52.960 --> 03:57.800
they had felt pressured specifically to cut the same-sex romance option for the obviously

03:57.800 --> 04:01.820
bisexual character Jack, due to that Fox News controversy.

04:01.820 --> 04:05.860
If you think the gaming industry has finally managed to shake itself of this moral panic

04:05.860 --> 04:09.340
nonsense, I'm afraid to say it's continued to the present day.

04:09.340 --> 04:14.900
Just a month ago, an Illinois House rep introduced a bill to ban the sale of all violent video

04:14.900 --> 04:18.780
games in the state, with the reasoning that doing so would somehow curb the uptick of

04:18.780 --> 04:19.780
violence in Chicago.

04:19.780 --> 04:25.820
And in 2019, the porn game Rape Day was banned from sale on Steam.

04:25.820 --> 04:30.020
And because politicians are going to politic, the question of regulating or banning certain

04:30.020 --> 04:32.060
types of video games was once again raised.

04:32.060 --> 04:34.980
But wait a minute, isn't Nicola Sturgeon a lefty?

04:34.980 --> 04:39.220
Up until now, all of this censorship BS we've been discussing has been coming from the right.

04:39.220 --> 04:44.280
Well, we are now in a new era of moral panic, where the left uses the same line of argument

04:44.280 --> 04:45.360
as the right.

04:45.360 --> 04:49.800
And no, it's not the libs or the rad libs or whatever, we discussed why it's not already

04:49.800 --> 04:50.800
in this video.

04:50.800 --> 04:55.880
This is leftist censorship, using idpol as its basis, claiming race issues or women's

04:55.880 --> 05:01.040
issues or anti-war or whatever the fuck to censor the artist, as all authoritarians do.

05:01.040 --> 05:05.160
And oh boy are these leftist censors Jack Thompson on steroids or what?

05:05.160 --> 05:09.800
Wokes Golds lost their minds because Call of Duty Modern Warfare, a game about war,

05:09.800 --> 05:12.000
features white phosphorous as a weapon.

05:12.000 --> 05:16.840
Wokes Golds blamed the Christchurch shooter's actions on video games, going so far as to

05:16.840 --> 05:21.800
say his live stream of the event looked like a video game for indoctrination purposes.

05:21.800 --> 05:25.880
Wokes Golds pinned the Parkland shooting on video games, claiming that video games cause

05:25.880 --> 05:28.680
violence is like how smoking causes lung cancer.

05:28.680 --> 05:32.680
Wokes Golds blame porn and video games for surges in violent crime.

05:32.680 --> 05:37.520
Wokes Golds brushed off the protest against Blizzard's legitimately awful actions as

05:37.520 --> 05:39.020
racism towards China.

05:39.020 --> 05:44.240
Wokes Golds dogpiled Niche Gamer for, I'm not making this up, interviewing the creator

05:44.240 --> 05:49.220
of the Yakuza video game series and actually being a fan of that game, which you think

05:49.220 --> 05:52.580
would be necessary if you were going to be a part of the enthusiast press.

05:52.580 --> 05:57.360
Seriously, these people shat all over Niche Gamer for interviewing a game developer, treating

05:57.360 --> 05:59.900
him positively and enjoying his games.

05:59.900 --> 06:00.900
What the fuck?

06:00.900 --> 06:04.700
I mean, why should a games journalist actually like video games, right?

06:04.700 --> 06:07.980
Why should he be happy to talk to the developer of the game that he likes?

06:07.980 --> 06:12.340
Well, why would gamers go to a forum about video games and expect to be able to actually

06:12.340 --> 06:14.060
talk about video games?

06:14.060 --> 06:18.740
Places like r slash games on Reddit are just full of people who hate gamers.

06:18.740 --> 06:24.900
In fact, r slash games decided for its April Fool's Day joke of 2019 to shut itself down

06:24.900 --> 06:30.080
for a day and then post a long Wokes Gold thread about how racist and sexist gamers

06:30.080 --> 06:35.260
are and how gamers have a moral obligation to minorities to follow the social justice

06:35.260 --> 06:36.260
way.

06:36.260 --> 06:37.460
I think we all know why this is, right?

06:37.460 --> 06:41.940
If you're here on my channel watching this video, you probably already know that social

06:41.940 --> 06:44.040
justice is a corrupting influence.

06:44.040 --> 06:47.800
It's a seeping contagion that spreads from community to community, slowly turning them

06:47.800 --> 06:50.940
away from their original intentions and towards leftist causes.

06:50.940 --> 06:55.040
These people came into the original atheism community and shit it up, turning people like

06:55.040 --> 07:01.540
the amazing atheist from fedora tipping edgelords into weird quasi-boy-motor contra-points ripoffs.

07:01.540 --> 07:05.180
They came into the let's play community and shit it up, where prominent let's players

07:05.180 --> 07:09.080
were once not afraid to actually be funny and now they're all just boring.

07:09.080 --> 07:13.140
They came into the internet reviewer community and shit it up, where edgy jokes were replaced

07:13.140 --> 07:17.660
with constant tone policing, and people like Lindsay Ellis who pioneered the genre now

07:17.660 --> 07:21.460
expressed constant regret at contributing to the angry reviewer trend.

07:21.460 --> 07:24.940
They moved into comics and shit it up, they moved into Magic the Gathering and shit it

07:24.940 --> 07:29.300
up, and as we all know, they moved into gaming and something different happened.

07:29.300 --> 07:33.380
Oh, they still shit it up, gaming sucks now, but gamergate happened.

07:33.580 --> 07:36.260
Unlike everybody else, gamers didn't just roll over and take it.

07:36.260 --> 07:40.060
Maybe it's because the gamers of the early 2010s were bullied as kids and found gaming

07:40.060 --> 07:41.460
to be their only refuge.

07:41.460 --> 07:45.980
Maybe it's because gaming is inherently competitive and gamers can be autistically laser focused

07:45.980 --> 07:46.980
on something.

07:46.980 --> 07:51.300
Maybe it's because gamers generally spend a lot of time in rowdy spots online like newgrounds

07:51.300 --> 07:55.480
and 4chan, and they're used to smack talk in game, so they've grown a thick skin.

07:55.480 --> 08:00.180
But unlike everybody else, gamers didn't just open the gates to the trojan horse.

08:00.180 --> 08:01.480
Gamers said fuck off.

08:01.480 --> 08:06.280
And ever since then, the moral panics have increased in both number and intensity, but

08:06.280 --> 08:08.160
from the left, not the right.

08:08.160 --> 08:12.200
Anna Valens, we regret to inform you the gamers are at it again.

08:12.200 --> 08:16.420
Gamers take themselves way too seriously, but they're also homophobic and must be stopped.

08:16.420 --> 08:21.720
Megan Condas, from Fortnite to alt-right, video games are white nationalist recruitment.

08:21.720 --> 08:24.320
Also I'm a professor of video games, I know what I'm talking about lol.

08:24.320 --> 08:28.960
Ashley Lynch, geek spaces are radicalized online and lead to the alt-right.

08:28.960 --> 08:31.160
Gamers are Nazis because they post Pepe the Frog.

08:31.160 --> 08:33.760
Reset era is, of course, the bottom of the iceberg.

08:33.760 --> 08:38.240
You can trace the Trump presidency and the resurgence of neo-nazium back to two people,

08:38.240 --> 08:43.520
Zoe Quinn's ex-boyfriend who started gamergate, and World of Warcraft player and terrorist

08:43.520 --> 08:44.520
Anders Breivik.

08:44.520 --> 08:46.280
It's gamers all the way down.

08:46.280 --> 08:50.760
This honestly just feels a lot like old people not understanding what young people do, and

08:50.760 --> 08:54.400
therefore immediately believing it to be bad based on their ignorance.

08:54.400 --> 08:58.440
Despite the theorized link between game violence and real violence being disproved at this

08:58.440 --> 09:02.640
point, there is a reason that video games are denounced for their violence by both Bernie

09:03.640 --> 09:08.400
I get appalled when I say that as a father of four and a grandfather of seven, if you

09:08.400 --> 09:12.580
look at these video games, if you look at some of the movies out there, some stuff that's

09:12.580 --> 09:18.080
on TV, there is so much gratuitous violence.

09:18.080 --> 09:23.880
And I can't help but think that that just desensitizes children and people in general

09:23.880 --> 09:25.640
to what it is about.

09:25.640 --> 09:30.080
You know, you have films where people are spraying guns and killing people.

09:31.080 --> 09:34.880
It desensitizes you to death and killing.

09:34.880 --> 09:37.580
So I think there's a lot of work that has to be done.

09:37.580 --> 09:38.820
And Donald Trump.

09:38.820 --> 09:44.560
This includes the gruesome and grisly video games that are now commonplace.

09:44.560 --> 09:51.000
It is too easy today for troubled youth to surround themselves with a culture that celebrates

09:51.000 --> 09:52.120
violence.

09:52.120 --> 09:53.720
These guys are just too old to get it.

09:53.720 --> 09:55.960
Kind of feels like I am at this point sometimes.

09:55.960 --> 09:59.240
But a lot of these people aren't old, so it's not just an age thing.

09:59.400 --> 10:04.080
The effect we're witnessing here is absolutely what I discussed in my play is subversive

10:04.080 --> 10:05.080
video.

10:05.080 --> 10:09.560
The act of play inherently allows you to consider possibilities that run counter to the current

10:09.560 --> 10:10.560
power structure.

10:10.560 --> 10:14.280
So when the right wields power, they censor entertainment that sparks the imagination

10:14.280 --> 10:16.320
while the left cries for free speech.

10:16.320 --> 10:19.680
And when the left wields power, they censor entertainment that sparks the imagination

10:19.680 --> 10:21.760
while the right cries for free speech.

10:21.760 --> 10:23.240
Nothing has actually changed.

10:23.240 --> 10:25.640
We've just been around long enough to see the pendulum swing.

10:25.640 --> 10:27.380
This isn't just an old person thing.

10:27.500 --> 10:31.140
There are middle aged people, even young people, who still believe that they're the current

10:31.140 --> 10:32.340
counter culture.

10:32.340 --> 10:35.300
Have no idea why zoomers are largely rejecting them.

10:35.300 --> 10:36.300
YouTubers?

10:36.300 --> 10:37.980
They're secret racists of course.

10:37.980 --> 10:38.980
Hashtag?

10:38.980 --> 10:41.460
You mean fashtag, the new alt-right hate symbol.

10:41.460 --> 10:43.300
Even socialists are getting in on this.

10:43.300 --> 10:46.580
Of course edgy memes are the neo-nazi entry point dude.

10:46.580 --> 10:49.900
It's not that the youngsters are rejecting your political and cultural hegemony because

10:49.900 --> 10:51.320
they value free speech.

10:51.320 --> 10:55.580
Or hell, just for the sake of pissing you off for the fun of it, it has to be fascism.

10:55.580 --> 10:57.820
Milk, the okay hand symbol, Pepe.

10:57.820 --> 11:02.340
It's all just kids trolling adults and adults who still think that they're kids, yelling

11:02.340 --> 11:05.420
and screaming about a rising tide of fascism that doesn't really exist.

11:05.420 --> 11:07.260
Oh yeah, also anime porn.

11:07.260 --> 11:09.340
If you whack off to hentai, you're a Trumpster.

11:09.340 --> 11:12.740
Okay Karen, why don't we just go back to blaming Elvis for spiritual degeneracy?

11:12.740 --> 11:14.740
I mean, why not?

11:14.740 --> 11:16.580
Before it was video games, it was Dungeons and Dragons.

11:16.580 --> 11:19.100
The Jack Chick comics were fucking hilarious by the way.

11:19.100 --> 11:20.300
Before that, it was television.

11:20.300 --> 11:25.420
Back in 1977, there was a high profile murder involving a 15 year old who was a TV addict

11:25.420 --> 11:28.060
and so television shows had their own moral panic.

11:28.060 --> 11:32.980
In 1948, three boys tortured and tried to kill another boy and the media said they were

11:32.980 --> 11:34.400
comic book addicts.

11:34.400 --> 11:37.980
Why worry about the atom bomb when America is filled with millions of comic fans?

11:37.980 --> 11:42.780
In 1946, radio drama programs were ruining the youth of today.

11:42.780 --> 11:47.900
In 1904, a young murderer was reported to have been addicted to dime novel reading.

11:47.900 --> 11:50.360
It is the same thing every time.

11:50.360 --> 11:54.500
From the turn of the century up to the leftists of today, people in power don't understand

11:54.500 --> 11:59.380
why the youth reject them and so what young people do must be demonized.

11:59.380 --> 12:04.560
Back in the day, a person who worked on the A&E show Intervention was known to anonymously

12:04.560 --> 12:06.980
surf the video game board on 4chan.

12:06.980 --> 12:10.540
Intervention is exactly what it sounds like, a reality TV show where they find mostly drug

12:10.540 --> 12:14.060
addicts and go through their histories, their current lives, stage an intervention with

12:14.060 --> 12:17.180
their families on camera and then follow up to see if they stayed sober.

12:17.180 --> 12:20.100
The framing, the music, it's exactly what you'd expect from this kind of show.

12:20.100 --> 12:23.660
But this anonymous person posted on V that soon, the episode lineup with the show's

12:23.660 --> 12:27.340
first season would be revealed and that among the alcoholics and heroin addicts, there would

12:27.340 --> 12:29.340
be an episode about video game addiction.

12:29.340 --> 12:34.700
This episode became a meme immediately after it aired on May 1st, 2005 and reaction images

12:34.700 --> 12:38.900
harvested from it are still occasionally used because it was over the top ridiculous.

12:38.900 --> 12:43.380
The other addicts in the series are primarily physically dependent on their drug of choice.

12:43.380 --> 12:48.420
Yes, they had shitty lives and those lives caused them to start using drugs but physical

12:48.420 --> 12:51.860
dependence on those drugs was what was holding them back now.

12:51.860 --> 12:55.860
Not so with Peter, who threw himself into video games because his entire life was shitty.

12:55.860 --> 12:59.500
And it was pretty clear that while he would probably still be a casual gamer, he would

12:59.500 --> 13:04.660
not be spending 18 hours straight playing Dance Dance Revolution if his family life

13:04.660 --> 13:05.900
was not so fucked up.

13:05.900 --> 13:09.220
And I think this is probably the case with Columbine, with the TV addict, the comic book

13:09.220 --> 13:10.420
addict, the dime novel addict.

13:10.420 --> 13:15.340
Moral panics are rarely justified but in those few cases where there appears to be a link,

13:15.340 --> 13:20.320
I would bet that obsession over entertainment was not a cause of their violence but rather

13:20.320 --> 13:24.600
a coping mechanism used to make their life bearable until it wasn't.

13:24.600 --> 13:29.160
And it is particularly disgusting to see leftists, who spent literal generations being on the

13:29.160 --> 13:33.760
receiving end of this shit in one form or another, suddenly turn a complete 180 on the

13:33.760 --> 13:35.780
topic now that they're the popular culture.

13:35.780 --> 13:39.320
The counterculture is definitionally counter-left right now.

13:39.320 --> 13:42.940
And so of course they must be hidden fascists instead of hidden communists.

13:42.940 --> 13:47.600
When the right says degenerate and subversive, the left says reactionary and problematic.

13:47.600 --> 13:49.000
But it's ultimately the same thing.

13:49.000 --> 13:53.240
However, the left is correct about one thing, that the political leanings of gamers appear

13:53.240 --> 13:54.840
not to be leftist at all.

13:54.840 --> 14:00.080
According to a survey conducted by the Entertainment Software Association, gamers, as a group,

14:00.080 --> 14:01.880
appear to be more politically engaged than average.

14:01.880 --> 14:06.800
They're more likely to vote, they lean left on social issues and right on economic ones,

14:06.800 --> 14:09.280
and they prioritize the economy and their concerns.

14:09.280 --> 14:10.960
In other words, they're libertarians.

14:10.960 --> 14:15.480
And that is enough for smooth-brained socialists to consider gamers to be fascists, to the

14:15.480 --> 14:19.720
point that, when Trump was feuding with journalists, if you were to notice that, regardless of

14:19.720 --> 14:24.440
Trump's faults, the journalists also acted inappropriately, they would bring up the specter

14:24.440 --> 14:25.680
of Gamergate.

14:25.680 --> 14:28.080
This nonsense continues to the present day.

14:28.080 --> 14:32.400
Six Days in Fallujah is a game that was shat on back during the Jack Thompson Fox News

14:32.400 --> 14:37.200
era of video game censorship, by rightoids, because the Battle of Fallujah had just happened

14:37.200 --> 14:38.260
and it was too soon.

14:38.260 --> 14:43.820
It went into development hell only to resurf in 2021 and get shat on again by leftists

14:43.820 --> 14:45.460
for glorifying the war in Iraq.

14:45.460 --> 14:50.180
I have said consistently that the left and the right are both ultimately authoritarian

14:50.180 --> 14:51.460
and I stand by that.

14:51.460 --> 14:55.880
The fact that people can swing so wildly between the two opposite ends of the spectrum means

14:55.880 --> 14:58.960
that the spectrum itself is factually inaccurate.

14:58.960 --> 15:03.020
Radical leftism and radical rightism are just anti-individualism with different coats of

15:03.020 --> 15:04.020
paint.

15:04.020 --> 15:07.320
And these people never actually change their thinking or their behaviors, they're just

15:07.320 --> 15:09.020
tyrants looking for a cause.

15:09.020 --> 15:12.860
It's funny to see people who once defended Harry Potter from the Christian book burners

15:12.900 --> 15:15.300
now burning those very same books themselves.

15:15.300 --> 15:19.600
Yes, the situation surrounding Six Days in Fallujah spurred me into making this video,

15:19.600 --> 15:22.260
but I realized pretty quickly it's ultimately a non-story.

15:22.260 --> 15:25.520
In fact, even though it's only been a few days, I'm pretty sure it's blown over

15:25.520 --> 15:26.520
at this point.

15:26.520 --> 15:30.280
What I realized when thinking about the history of all this stuff is that the real story here

15:30.280 --> 15:32.040
is the actions of gamers themselves.

15:32.040 --> 15:33.880
Yes, gaming's shitty right now.

15:33.880 --> 15:38.880
There's microtransactions, always online, battle royale, censorship from all sides,

15:38.880 --> 15:43.620
loot boxes, screeching indie SJWs, China simps, and woke-skulled journalists.

15:43.620 --> 15:48.100
But unlike every other community that SJWs planted their flag into, gamers didn't change.

15:48.100 --> 15:50.760
They didn't cuck out and become socialists themselves.

15:50.760 --> 15:54.620
They built a giant middle finger and have left it up to this very day.

15:54.620 --> 15:57.900
They still want games that cater to their sensibilities and they're still getting

15:57.900 --> 15:58.900
them.

15:58.900 --> 16:00.860
Despite the screaming from the left that gamers are dead.

16:00.860 --> 16:04.340
We declared them dead years ago guys, why are you still making games for them?

16:04.340 --> 16:08.640
Those companies who go woke are slowly finding themselves going broke and it's actually

16:08.640 --> 16:09.640
quite refreshing.

16:09.640 --> 16:14.740
It's a slow process, all consumer revolts are, but it has been a long, patient string

16:14.740 --> 16:15.740
of victories.

16:15.740 --> 16:19.940
The Last of Us Part 2 is a disaster, while the Demon's Souls remake is not, and the

16:19.940 --> 16:21.900
market is generally taking notice.

16:21.900 --> 16:26.740
Even among indie games, stuff like Hollow Knight or Isaac is considered top tier despite

16:26.740 --> 16:27.900
being decisively non-political.

16:27.900 --> 16:31.460
I don't really know how to end this video, I just feel bright for the future of video

16:31.460 --> 16:33.800
games, despite all the problems that we have.

16:33.800 --> 16:37.660
Not because the SJWs are gone, nah they'll probably always be around, but because despite

16:37.660 --> 16:42.600
being propped up by every institution in this community, the actual rank and file gamers

16:42.600 --> 16:44.000
are largely rejecting them.

16:44.000 --> 16:48.740
I'm happy that I can still fire up my twitch stream and play what games I want to play

16:48.740 --> 16:51.680
to an audience who I know aren't woke's goals themselves.

16:51.680 --> 16:56.360
I'm happy that I can still pop over to Newgrounds or 4chan and talk to people who actually care

16:56.360 --> 16:57.360
about games.

16:57.360 --> 17:02.260
And I'm happy that the accredited, official, institutional parts of gaming culture have

17:02.260 --> 17:07.120
massive overhead costs associated with them, while nobody actually gives a shit about whether

17:07.120 --> 17:08.420
they live or die.

17:08.420 --> 17:13.660
The left may have won the throne, but the peasants no longer swear fealty to it.

17:13.660 --> 17:15.380
