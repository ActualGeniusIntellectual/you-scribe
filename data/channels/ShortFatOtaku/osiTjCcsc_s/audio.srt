1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,600
Maybe I'm just an old man, but I would hope that most of the people currently listening

2
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:13,120
to this video remember the video game Mortal Panics of the 1990s.

3
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:15,440
Or at least know about them, I'm not alone right?

4
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:20,060
You guys must know about how, when the original Mortal Kombat game hit consoles, Nintendo

5
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:24,800
censored the SNES version of all of its blood and gore, but the overwhelming popularity

6
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:28,820
of the series on the Genesis and in the arcade led to a congressional hearing on whether

7
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:32,580
or not content of video games needed to be regulated, considering they were all marketed

8
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:33,580
at kids.

9
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:34,860
You guys know about that right?

10
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:40,240
Or how about when, during that same congressional hearing, Joe Lieberman lambasted Sega for

11
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:44,820
the game Night Trap, which he said promoted sexual violence against women, while admitting

12
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:48,660
he never actually played the game, while the game itself was really just you taking the

13
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:53,820
job of watching security cameras for creepsters, sneaking into a mansion to abduct girls from

14
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:57,180
a sleepover party, and saving them by triggering traps at the right time?

15
00:00:57,180 --> 00:00:58,300
You know about that right?

16
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:01,580
You guys didn't just hear about all this watching the internet historian or something

17
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:02,580
right?

18
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:05,080
You must remember being a kid and talking about this nonsense at school with your friends

19
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:06,080
like me.

20
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:07,180
I'm not just old am I?

21
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:11,980
A core component of why people like me grew up believing in the very broad tent of left

22
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:14,100
wing politics is Jack Thompson.

23
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:18,980
Thompson was a Florida based lawyer who came to prominence going after rappers in the 1990s

24
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:20,320
from a conservative perspective.

25
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:24,900
He believed that the excessive violence in rap music qualified as obscene and therefore

26
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:25,940
needed to be censored.

27
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:29,460
His attention later shifted to video games, using the same arguments.

28
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:32,580
In fact, now that I'm talking about it, I'm pretty sure that a good part of why

29
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:38,020
young politically disengaged gamers believe the right wing was anti-free speech is probably

30
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:39,020
due to Jack Thompson.

31
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:43,060
Thompson routinely provided the early internet with amazing quotes and sound bites, and found

32
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:48,460
himself lampooned in places like Penny Arcade, Game Facts, uh sorry, Sega Sages as it was

33
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:52,180
known back then, and Newgrounds, which were the closest thing we had to social media at

34
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:53,180
the time.

35
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:58,440
Thompson said that they were committing Pearl Harbor 2 due to their widespread popularity.

36
00:01:58,440 --> 00:01:59,440
He also said,

37
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:18,820
If some whacked out adult wants to spend his time playing Grand Theft Auto Vice City, one

38
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:23,140
has to wonder why he doesn't get a life, but when it comes to kids, it has a demonstrable

39
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:27,220
impact on their behavior and the development of the frontal lobes of their brain.

40
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:31,080
And regarding rumble controllers, which were new at the time, they give you a pleasurable

41
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:33,700
buzz back into your hands with each kill.

42
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:39,180
This is operant conditioning, behavior modification right out of BF Skinner's lab.

43
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:43,180
Thompson would go on to blame multiple school shootings and other murders on video games,

44
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:47,620
most notably Columbine because one of the shooters owned a copy of the original Doom.

45
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:51,780
Thompson eventually destroyed himself by repeatedly filing frivolous lawsuits to the Florida court

46
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:56,020
surrounding these topics, and was eventually disbarred in 2008, to the widespread cheer

47
00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:57,780
and laughter of everybody.

48
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:01,140
And by the way, one of those lawsuits was against Midway, the company that actually

49
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:05,040
creates the Mortal Kombat games, not because of Mortal Kombat's violence, but because the

50
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:09,700
character creator in Mortal Kombat Armageddon allowed people to create any character they

51
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:14,460
like, and gamers were overwhelmingly creating Jack Thompsons in the game to kick the shit

52
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:15,460
out of him.

53
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:19,900
But despite Thompson fading away into the anals of gaming history, that didn't stop

54
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:22,020
the moral panic surrounding video games.

55
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:27,980
Back when Mass Effect 1 came out, the infamous right-wing news outlet Fox News ran a hitpiece

56
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:33,180
on the game, claiming it promoted lesbianism to your children because Liara, a blue alien

57
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:39,060
whose species only consists of women, could engage in what looks like, by human standards,

58
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:42,700
lesbian sex with a player character if you chose to play as a woman.

59
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:47,780
BioWare, the developer, would massively trim down the same-sex romance options in the game's

60
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:52,960
sequel Mass Effect 2, and the people behind the game outright admitted in early 2021 that

61
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:57,800
they had felt pressured specifically to cut the same-sex romance option for the obviously

62
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:01,820
bisexual character Jack, due to that Fox News controversy.

63
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:05,860
If you think the gaming industry has finally managed to shake itself of this moral panic

64
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:09,340
nonsense, I'm afraid to say it's continued to the present day.

65
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:14,900
Just a month ago, an Illinois House rep introduced a bill to ban the sale of all violent video

66
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:18,780
games in the state, with the reasoning that doing so would somehow curb the uptick of

67
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:19,780
violence in Chicago.

68
00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:25,820
And in 2019, the porn game Rape Day was banned from sale on Steam.

69
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:30,020
And because politicians are going to politic, the question of regulating or banning certain

70
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:32,060
types of video games was once again raised.

71
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:34,980
But wait a minute, isn't Nicola Sturgeon a lefty?

72
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:39,220
Up until now, all of this censorship BS we've been discussing has been coming from the right.

73
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:44,280
Well, we are now in a new era of moral panic, where the left uses the same line of argument

74
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:45,360
as the right.

75
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:49,800
And no, it's not the libs or the rad libs or whatever, we discussed why it's not already

76
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:50,800
in this video.

77
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:55,880
This is leftist censorship, using idpol as its basis, claiming race issues or women's

78
00:04:55,880 --> 00:05:01,040
issues or anti-war or whatever the fuck to censor the artist, as all authoritarians do.

79
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:05,160
And oh boy are these leftist censors Jack Thompson on steroids or what?

80
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:09,800
Wokes Golds lost their minds because Call of Duty Modern Warfare, a game about war,

81
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:12,000
features white phosphorous as a weapon.

82
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,840
Wokes Golds blamed the Christchurch shooter's actions on video games, going so far as to

83
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:21,800
say his live stream of the event looked like a video game for indoctrination purposes.

84
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:25,880
Wokes Golds pinned the Parkland shooting on video games, claiming that video games cause

85
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:28,680
violence is like how smoking causes lung cancer.

86
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:32,680
Wokes Golds blame porn and video games for surges in violent crime.

87
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:37,520
Wokes Golds brushed off the protest against Blizzard's legitimately awful actions as

88
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,020
racism towards China.

89
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:44,240
Wokes Golds dogpiled Niche Gamer for, I'm not making this up, interviewing the creator

90
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:49,220
of the Yakuza video game series and actually being a fan of that game, which you think

91
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:52,580
would be necessary if you were going to be a part of the enthusiast press.

92
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:57,360
Seriously, these people shat all over Niche Gamer for interviewing a game developer, treating

93
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,900
him positively and enjoying his games.

94
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:00,900
What the fuck?

95
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:04,700
I mean, why should a games journalist actually like video games, right?

96
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:07,980
Why should he be happy to talk to the developer of the game that he likes?

97
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:12,340
Well, why would gamers go to a forum about video games and expect to be able to actually

98
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:14,060
talk about video games?

99
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:18,740
Places like r slash games on Reddit are just full of people who hate gamers.

100
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:24,900
In fact, r slash games decided for its April Fool's Day joke of 2019 to shut itself down

101
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:30,080
for a day and then post a long Wokes Gold thread about how racist and sexist gamers

102
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:35,260
are and how gamers have a moral obligation to minorities to follow the social justice

103
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:36,260
way.

104
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:37,460
I think we all know why this is, right?

105
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:41,940
If you're here on my channel watching this video, you probably already know that social

106
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:44,040
justice is a corrupting influence.

107
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:47,800
It's a seeping contagion that spreads from community to community, slowly turning them

108
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:50,940
away from their original intentions and towards leftist causes.

109
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:55,040
These people came into the original atheism community and shit it up, turning people like

110
00:06:55,040 --> 00:07:01,540
the amazing atheist from fedora tipping edgelords into weird quasi-boy-motor contra-points ripoffs.

111
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:05,180
They came into the let's play community and shit it up, where prominent let's players

112
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:09,080
were once not afraid to actually be funny and now they're all just boring.

113
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:13,140
They came into the internet reviewer community and shit it up, where edgy jokes were replaced

114
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:17,660
with constant tone policing, and people like Lindsay Ellis who pioneered the genre now

115
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:21,460
expressed constant regret at contributing to the angry reviewer trend.

116
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:24,940
They moved into comics and shit it up, they moved into Magic the Gathering and shit it

117
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:29,300
up, and as we all know, they moved into gaming and something different happened.

118
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:33,380
Oh, they still shit it up, gaming sucks now, but gamergate happened.

119
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:36,260
Unlike everybody else, gamers didn't just roll over and take it.

120
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:40,060
Maybe it's because the gamers of the early 2010s were bullied as kids and found gaming

121
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:41,460
to be their only refuge.

122
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:45,980
Maybe it's because gaming is inherently competitive and gamers can be autistically laser focused

123
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:46,980
on something.

124
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:51,300
Maybe it's because gamers generally spend a lot of time in rowdy spots online like newgrounds

125
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:55,480
and 4chan, and they're used to smack talk in game, so they've grown a thick skin.

126
00:07:55,480 --> 00:08:00,180
But unlike everybody else, gamers didn't just open the gates to the trojan horse.

127
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:01,480
Gamers said fuck off.

128
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:06,280
And ever since then, the moral panics have increased in both number and intensity, but

129
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:08,160
from the left, not the right.

130
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:12,200
Anna Valens, we regret to inform you the gamers are at it again.

131
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:16,420
Gamers take themselves way too seriously, but they're also homophobic and must be stopped.

132
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:21,720
Megan Condas, from Fortnite to alt-right, video games are white nationalist recruitment.

133
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:24,320
Also I'm a professor of video games, I know what I'm talking about lol.

134
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:28,960
Ashley Lynch, geek spaces are radicalized online and lead to the alt-right.

135
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:31,160
Gamers are Nazis because they post Pepe the Frog.

136
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:33,760
Reset era is, of course, the bottom of the iceberg.

137
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:38,240
You can trace the Trump presidency and the resurgence of neo-nazium back to two people,

138
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:43,520
Zoe Quinn's ex-boyfriend who started gamergate, and World of Warcraft player and terrorist

139
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:44,520
Anders Breivik.

140
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:46,280
It's gamers all the way down.

141
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:50,760
This honestly just feels a lot like old people not understanding what young people do, and

142
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:54,400
therefore immediately believing it to be bad based on their ignorance.

143
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:58,440
Despite the theorized link between game violence and real violence being disproved at this

144
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:02,640
point, there is a reason that video games are denounced for their violence by both Bernie

145
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:08,400
I get appalled when I say that as a father of four and a grandfather of seven, if you

146
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:12,580
look at these video games, if you look at some of the movies out there, some stuff that's

147
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:18,080
on TV, there is so much gratuitous violence.

148
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:23,880
And I can't help but think that that just desensitizes children and people in general

149
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:25,640
to what it is about.

150
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:30,080
You know, you have films where people are spraying guns and killing people.

151
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:34,880
It desensitizes you to death and killing.

152
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:37,580
So I think there's a lot of work that has to be done.

153
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:38,820
And Donald Trump.

154
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:44,560
This includes the gruesome and grisly video games that are now commonplace.

155
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:51,000
It is too easy today for troubled youth to surround themselves with a culture that celebrates

156
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,120
violence.

157
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:53,720
These guys are just too old to get it.

158
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:55,960
Kind of feels like I am at this point sometimes.

159
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:59,240
But a lot of these people aren't old, so it's not just an age thing.

160
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:04,080
The effect we're witnessing here is absolutely what I discussed in my play is subversive

161
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,080
video.

162
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:09,560
The act of play inherently allows you to consider possibilities that run counter to the current

163
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:10,560
power structure.

164
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:14,280
So when the right wields power, they censor entertainment that sparks the imagination

165
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:16,320
while the left cries for free speech.

166
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:19,680
And when the left wields power, they censor entertainment that sparks the imagination

167
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,760
while the right cries for free speech.

168
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,240
Nothing has actually changed.

169
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:25,640
We've just been around long enough to see the pendulum swing.

170
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:27,380
This isn't just an old person thing.

171
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:31,140
There are middle aged people, even young people, who still believe that they're the current

172
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:32,340
counter culture.

173
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:35,300
Have no idea why zoomers are largely rejecting them.

174
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:36,300
YouTubers?

175
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:37,980
They're secret racists of course.

176
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:38,980
Hashtag?

177
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:41,460
You mean fashtag, the new alt-right hate symbol.

178
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:43,300
Even socialists are getting in on this.

179
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:46,580
Of course edgy memes are the neo-nazi entry point dude.

180
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:49,900
It's not that the youngsters are rejecting your political and cultural hegemony because

181
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:51,320
they value free speech.

182
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:55,580
Or hell, just for the sake of pissing you off for the fun of it, it has to be fascism.

183
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:57,820
Milk, the okay hand symbol, Pepe.

184
00:10:57,820 --> 00:11:02,340
It's all just kids trolling adults and adults who still think that they're kids, yelling

185
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:05,420
and screaming about a rising tide of fascism that doesn't really exist.

186
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:07,260
Oh yeah, also anime porn.

187
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:09,340
If you whack off to hentai, you're a Trumpster.

188
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:12,740
Okay Karen, why don't we just go back to blaming Elvis for spiritual degeneracy?

189
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:14,740
I mean, why not?

190
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:16,580
Before it was video games, it was Dungeons and Dragons.

191
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:19,100
The Jack Chick comics were fucking hilarious by the way.

192
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:20,300
Before that, it was television.

193
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:25,420
Back in 1977, there was a high profile murder involving a 15 year old who was a TV addict

194
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:28,060
and so television shows had their own moral panic.

195
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:32,980
In 1948, three boys tortured and tried to kill another boy and the media said they were

196
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:34,400
comic book addicts.

197
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:37,980
Why worry about the atom bomb when America is filled with millions of comic fans?

198
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:42,780
In 1946, radio drama programs were ruining the youth of today.

199
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:47,900
In 1904, a young murderer was reported to have been addicted to dime novel reading.

200
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:50,360
It is the same thing every time.

201
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:54,500
From the turn of the century up to the leftists of today, people in power don't understand

202
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:59,380
why the youth reject them and so what young people do must be demonized.

203
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:04,560
Back in the day, a person who worked on the A&E show Intervention was known to anonymously

204
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,980
surf the video game board on 4chan.

205
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:10,540
Intervention is exactly what it sounds like, a reality TV show where they find mostly drug

206
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:14,060
addicts and go through their histories, their current lives, stage an intervention with

207
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:17,180
their families on camera and then follow up to see if they stayed sober.

208
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:20,100
The framing, the music, it's exactly what you'd expect from this kind of show.

209
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:23,660
But this anonymous person posted on V that soon, the episode lineup with the show's

210
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:27,340
first season would be revealed and that among the alcoholics and heroin addicts, there would

211
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:29,340
be an episode about video game addiction.

212
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:34,700
This episode became a meme immediately after it aired on May 1st, 2005 and reaction images

213
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:38,900
harvested from it are still occasionally used because it was over the top ridiculous.

214
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:43,380
The other addicts in the series are primarily physically dependent on their drug of choice.

215
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:48,420
Yes, they had shitty lives and those lives caused them to start using drugs but physical

216
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:51,860
dependence on those drugs was what was holding them back now.

217
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:55,860
Not so with Peter, who threw himself into video games because his entire life was shitty.

218
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:59,500
And it was pretty clear that while he would probably still be a casual gamer, he would

219
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:04,660
not be spending 18 hours straight playing Dance Dance Revolution if his family life

220
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:05,900
was not so fucked up.

221
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:09,220
And I think this is probably the case with Columbine, with the TV addict, the comic book

222
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:10,420
addict, the dime novel addict.

223
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:15,340
Moral panics are rarely justified but in those few cases where there appears to be a link,

224
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:20,320
I would bet that obsession over entertainment was not a cause of their violence but rather

225
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:24,600
a coping mechanism used to make their life bearable until it wasn't.

226
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:29,160
And it is particularly disgusting to see leftists, who spent literal generations being on the

227
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:33,760
receiving end of this shit in one form or another, suddenly turn a complete 180 on the

228
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:35,780
topic now that they're the popular culture.

229
00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:39,320
The counterculture is definitionally counter-left right now.

230
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:42,940
And so of course they must be hidden fascists instead of hidden communists.

231
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:47,600
When the right says degenerate and subversive, the left says reactionary and problematic.

232
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,000
But it's ultimately the same thing.

233
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:53,240
However, the left is correct about one thing, that the political leanings of gamers appear

234
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:54,840
not to be leftist at all.

235
00:13:54,840 --> 00:14:00,080
According to a survey conducted by the Entertainment Software Association, gamers, as a group,

236
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:01,880
appear to be more politically engaged than average.

237
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:06,800
They're more likely to vote, they lean left on social issues and right on economic ones,

238
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:09,280
and they prioritize the economy and their concerns.

239
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:10,960
In other words, they're libertarians.

240
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:15,480
And that is enough for smooth-brained socialists to consider gamers to be fascists, to the

241
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:19,720
point that, when Trump was feuding with journalists, if you were to notice that, regardless of

242
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:24,440
Trump's faults, the journalists also acted inappropriately, they would bring up the specter

243
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:25,680
of Gamergate.

244
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:28,080
This nonsense continues to the present day.

245
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:32,400
Six Days in Fallujah is a game that was shat on back during the Jack Thompson Fox News

246
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:37,200
era of video game censorship, by rightoids, because the Battle of Fallujah had just happened

247
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,260
and it was too soon.

248
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:43,820
It went into development hell only to resurf in 2021 and get shat on again by leftists

249
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:45,460
for glorifying the war in Iraq.

250
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:50,180
I have said consistently that the left and the right are both ultimately authoritarian

251
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:51,460
and I stand by that.

252
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:55,880
The fact that people can swing so wildly between the two opposite ends of the spectrum means

253
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:58,960
that the spectrum itself is factually inaccurate.

254
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:03,020
Radical leftism and radical rightism are just anti-individualism with different coats of

255
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:04,020
paint.

256
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:07,320
And these people never actually change their thinking or their behaviors, they're just

257
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:09,020
tyrants looking for a cause.

258
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:12,860
It's funny to see people who once defended Harry Potter from the Christian book burners

259
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:15,300
now burning those very same books themselves.

260
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:19,600
Yes, the situation surrounding Six Days in Fallujah spurred me into making this video,

261
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:22,260
but I realized pretty quickly it's ultimately a non-story.

262
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:25,520
In fact, even though it's only been a few days, I'm pretty sure it's blown over

263
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:26,520
at this point.

264
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:30,280
What I realized when thinking about the history of all this stuff is that the real story here

265
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:32,040
is the actions of gamers themselves.

266
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:33,880
Yes, gaming's shitty right now.

267
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:38,880
There's microtransactions, always online, battle royale, censorship from all sides,

268
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:43,620
loot boxes, screeching indie SJWs, China simps, and woke-skulled journalists.

269
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:48,100
But unlike every other community that SJWs planted their flag into, gamers didn't change.

270
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:50,760
They didn't cuck out and become socialists themselves.

271
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:54,620
They built a giant middle finger and have left it up to this very day.

272
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:57,900
They still want games that cater to their sensibilities and they're still getting

273
00:15:57,900 --> 00:15:58,900
them.

274
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:00,860
Despite the screaming from the left that gamers are dead.

275
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:04,340
We declared them dead years ago guys, why are you still making games for them?

276
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:08,640
Those companies who go woke are slowly finding themselves going broke and it's actually

277
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:09,640
quite refreshing.

278
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:14,740
It's a slow process, all consumer revolts are, but it has been a long, patient string

279
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:15,740
of victories.

280
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:19,940
The Last of Us Part 2 is a disaster, while the Demon's Souls remake is not, and the

281
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:21,900
market is generally taking notice.

282
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:26,740
Even among indie games, stuff like Hollow Knight or Isaac is considered top tier despite

283
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:27,900
being decisively non-political.

284
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:31,460
I don't really know how to end this video, I just feel bright for the future of video

285
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:33,800
games, despite all the problems that we have.

286
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:37,660
Not because the SJWs are gone, nah they'll probably always be around, but because despite

287
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:42,600
being propped up by every institution in this community, the actual rank and file gamers

288
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:44,000
are largely rejecting them.

289
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,740
I'm happy that I can still fire up my twitch stream and play what games I want to play

290
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:51,680
to an audience who I know aren't woke's goals themselves.

291
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:56,360
I'm happy that I can still pop over to Newgrounds or 4chan and talk to people who actually care

292
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:57,360
about games.

293
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:02,260
And I'm happy that the accredited, official, institutional parts of gaming culture have

294
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:07,120
massive overhead costs associated with them, while nobody actually gives a shit about whether

295
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:08,420
they live or die.

296
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:13,660
The left may have won the throne, but the peasants no longer swear fealty to it.

297
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:15,380
Thank you for watching my friends.
