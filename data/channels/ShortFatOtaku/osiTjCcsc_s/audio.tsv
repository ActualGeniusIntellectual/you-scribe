0	9600	Maybe I'm just an old man, but I would hope that most of the people currently listening
9600	13120	to this video remember the video game Mortal Panics of the 1990s.
13120	15440	Or at least know about them, I'm not alone right?
15440	20060	You guys must know about how, when the original Mortal Kombat game hit consoles, Nintendo
20060	24800	censored the SNES version of all of its blood and gore, but the overwhelming popularity
24800	28820	of the series on the Genesis and in the arcade led to a congressional hearing on whether
28820	32580	or not content of video games needed to be regulated, considering they were all marketed
32580	33580	at kids.
33580	34860	You guys know about that right?
34860	40240	Or how about when, during that same congressional hearing, Joe Lieberman lambasted Sega for
40240	44820	the game Night Trap, which he said promoted sexual violence against women, while admitting
44820	48660	he never actually played the game, while the game itself was really just you taking the
48660	53820	job of watching security cameras for creepsters, sneaking into a mansion to abduct girls from
53820	57180	a sleepover party, and saving them by triggering traps at the right time?
57180	58300	You know about that right?
58300	61580	You guys didn't just hear about all this watching the internet historian or something
61580	62580	right?
62580	65080	You must remember being a kid and talking about this nonsense at school with your friends
65080	66080	like me.
66080	67180	I'm not just old am I?
67180	71980	A core component of why people like me grew up believing in the very broad tent of left
71980	74100	wing politics is Jack Thompson.
74100	78980	Thompson was a Florida based lawyer who came to prominence going after rappers in the 1990s
78980	80320	from a conservative perspective.
80320	84900	He believed that the excessive violence in rap music qualified as obscene and therefore
84900	85940	needed to be censored.
85940	89460	His attention later shifted to video games, using the same arguments.
89460	92580	In fact, now that I'm talking about it, I'm pretty sure that a good part of why
92580	98020	young politically disengaged gamers believe the right wing was anti-free speech is probably
98020	99020	due to Jack Thompson.
99020	103060	Thompson routinely provided the early internet with amazing quotes and sound bites, and found
103060	108460	himself lampooned in places like Penny Arcade, Game Facts, uh sorry, Sega Sages as it was
108460	112180	known back then, and Newgrounds, which were the closest thing we had to social media at
112180	113180	the time.
113420	118440	Thompson said that they were committing Pearl Harbor 2 due to their widespread popularity.
118440	119440	He also said,
133820	138820	If some whacked out adult wants to spend his time playing Grand Theft Auto Vice City, one
138820	143140	has to wonder why he doesn't get a life, but when it comes to kids, it has a demonstrable
143140	147220	impact on their behavior and the development of the frontal lobes of their brain.
147220	151080	And regarding rumble controllers, which were new at the time, they give you a pleasurable
151080	153700	buzz back into your hands with each kill.
153700	159180	This is operant conditioning, behavior modification right out of BF Skinner's lab.
159180	163180	Thompson would go on to blame multiple school shootings and other murders on video games,
163180	167620	most notably Columbine because one of the shooters owned a copy of the original Doom.
167620	171780	Thompson eventually destroyed himself by repeatedly filing frivolous lawsuits to the Florida court
171780	176020	surrounding these topics, and was eventually disbarred in 2008, to the widespread cheer
176020	177780	and laughter of everybody.
177780	181140	And by the way, one of those lawsuits was against Midway, the company that actually
181140	185040	creates the Mortal Kombat games, not because of Mortal Kombat's violence, but because the
185040	189700	character creator in Mortal Kombat Armageddon allowed people to create any character they
189700	194460	like, and gamers were overwhelmingly creating Jack Thompsons in the game to kick the shit
194460	195460	out of him.
195460	199900	But despite Thompson fading away into the anals of gaming history, that didn't stop
199900	202020	the moral panic surrounding video games.
202020	207980	Back when Mass Effect 1 came out, the infamous right-wing news outlet Fox News ran a hitpiece
207980	213180	on the game, claiming it promoted lesbianism to your children because Liara, a blue alien
213180	219060	whose species only consists of women, could engage in what looks like, by human standards,
219060	222700	lesbian sex with a player character if you chose to play as a woman.
222700	227780	BioWare, the developer, would massively trim down the same-sex romance options in the game's
227780	232960	sequel Mass Effect 2, and the people behind the game outright admitted in early 2021 that
232960	237800	they had felt pressured specifically to cut the same-sex romance option for the obviously
237800	241820	bisexual character Jack, due to that Fox News controversy.
241820	245860	If you think the gaming industry has finally managed to shake itself of this moral panic
245860	249340	nonsense, I'm afraid to say it's continued to the present day.
249340	254900	Just a month ago, an Illinois House rep introduced a bill to ban the sale of all violent video
254900	258780	games in the state, with the reasoning that doing so would somehow curb the uptick of
258780	259780	violence in Chicago.
259780	265820	And in 2019, the porn game Rape Day was banned from sale on Steam.
265820	270020	And because politicians are going to politic, the question of regulating or banning certain
270020	272060	types of video games was once again raised.
272060	274980	But wait a minute, isn't Nicola Sturgeon a lefty?
274980	279220	Up until now, all of this censorship BS we've been discussing has been coming from the right.
279220	284280	Well, we are now in a new era of moral panic, where the left uses the same line of argument
284280	285360	as the right.
285360	289800	And no, it's not the libs or the rad libs or whatever, we discussed why it's not already
289800	290800	in this video.
290800	295880	This is leftist censorship, using idpol as its basis, claiming race issues or women's
295880	301040	issues or anti-war or whatever the fuck to censor the artist, as all authoritarians do.
301040	305160	And oh boy are these leftist censors Jack Thompson on steroids or what?
305160	309800	Wokes Golds lost their minds because Call of Duty Modern Warfare, a game about war,
309800	312000	features white phosphorous as a weapon.
312000	316840	Wokes Golds blamed the Christchurch shooter's actions on video games, going so far as to
316840	321800	say his live stream of the event looked like a video game for indoctrination purposes.
321800	325880	Wokes Golds pinned the Parkland shooting on video games, claiming that video games cause
325880	328680	violence is like how smoking causes lung cancer.
328680	332680	Wokes Golds blame porn and video games for surges in violent crime.
332680	337520	Wokes Golds brushed off the protest against Blizzard's legitimately awful actions as
337520	339020	racism towards China.
339020	344240	Wokes Golds dogpiled Niche Gamer for, I'm not making this up, interviewing the creator
344240	349220	of the Yakuza video game series and actually being a fan of that game, which you think
349220	352580	would be necessary if you were going to be a part of the enthusiast press.
352580	357360	Seriously, these people shat all over Niche Gamer for interviewing a game developer, treating
357360	359900	him positively and enjoying his games.
359900	360900	What the fuck?
360900	364700	I mean, why should a games journalist actually like video games, right?
364700	367980	Why should he be happy to talk to the developer of the game that he likes?
367980	372340	Well, why would gamers go to a forum about video games and expect to be able to actually
372340	374060	talk about video games?
374060	378740	Places like r slash games on Reddit are just full of people who hate gamers.
378740	384900	In fact, r slash games decided for its April Fool's Day joke of 2019 to shut itself down
384900	390080	for a day and then post a long Wokes Gold thread about how racist and sexist gamers
390080	395260	are and how gamers have a moral obligation to minorities to follow the social justice
395260	396260	way.
396260	397460	I think we all know why this is, right?
397460	401940	If you're here on my channel watching this video, you probably already know that social
401940	404040	justice is a corrupting influence.
404040	407800	It's a seeping contagion that spreads from community to community, slowly turning them
407800	410940	away from their original intentions and towards leftist causes.
410940	415040	These people came into the original atheism community and shit it up, turning people like
415040	421540	the amazing atheist from fedora tipping edgelords into weird quasi-boy-motor contra-points ripoffs.
421540	425180	They came into the let's play community and shit it up, where prominent let's players
425180	429080	were once not afraid to actually be funny and now they're all just boring.
429080	433140	They came into the internet reviewer community and shit it up, where edgy jokes were replaced
433140	437660	with constant tone policing, and people like Lindsay Ellis who pioneered the genre now
437660	441460	expressed constant regret at contributing to the angry reviewer trend.
441460	444940	They moved into comics and shit it up, they moved into Magic the Gathering and shit it
444940	449300	up, and as we all know, they moved into gaming and something different happened.
449300	453380	Oh, they still shit it up, gaming sucks now, but gamergate happened.
453580	456260	Unlike everybody else, gamers didn't just roll over and take it.
456260	460060	Maybe it's because the gamers of the early 2010s were bullied as kids and found gaming
460060	461460	to be their only refuge.
461460	465980	Maybe it's because gaming is inherently competitive and gamers can be autistically laser focused
465980	466980	on something.
466980	471300	Maybe it's because gamers generally spend a lot of time in rowdy spots online like newgrounds
471300	475480	and 4chan, and they're used to smack talk in game, so they've grown a thick skin.
475480	480180	But unlike everybody else, gamers didn't just open the gates to the trojan horse.
480180	481480	Gamers said fuck off.
481480	486280	And ever since then, the moral panics have increased in both number and intensity, but
486280	488160	from the left, not the right.
488160	492200	Anna Valens, we regret to inform you the gamers are at it again.
492200	496420	Gamers take themselves way too seriously, but they're also homophobic and must be stopped.
496420	501720	Megan Condas, from Fortnite to alt-right, video games are white nationalist recruitment.
501720	504320	Also I'm a professor of video games, I know what I'm talking about lol.
504320	508960	Ashley Lynch, geek spaces are radicalized online and lead to the alt-right.
508960	511160	Gamers are Nazis because they post Pepe the Frog.
511160	513760	Reset era is, of course, the bottom of the iceberg.
513760	518240	You can trace the Trump presidency and the resurgence of neo-nazium back to two people,
518240	523520	Zoe Quinn's ex-boyfriend who started gamergate, and World of Warcraft player and terrorist
523520	524520	Anders Breivik.
524520	526280	It's gamers all the way down.
526280	530760	This honestly just feels a lot like old people not understanding what young people do, and
530760	534400	therefore immediately believing it to be bad based on their ignorance.
534400	538440	Despite the theorized link between game violence and real violence being disproved at this
538440	542640	point, there is a reason that video games are denounced for their violence by both Bernie
543640	548400	I get appalled when I say that as a father of four and a grandfather of seven, if you
548400	552580	look at these video games, if you look at some of the movies out there, some stuff that's
552580	558080	on TV, there is so much gratuitous violence.
558080	563880	And I can't help but think that that just desensitizes children and people in general
563880	565640	to what it is about.
565640	570080	You know, you have films where people are spraying guns and killing people.
571080	574880	It desensitizes you to death and killing.
574880	577580	So I think there's a lot of work that has to be done.
577580	578820	And Donald Trump.
578820	584560	This includes the gruesome and grisly video games that are now commonplace.
584560	591000	It is too easy today for troubled youth to surround themselves with a culture that celebrates
591000	592120	violence.
592120	593720	These guys are just too old to get it.
593720	595960	Kind of feels like I am at this point sometimes.
595960	599240	But a lot of these people aren't old, so it's not just an age thing.
599400	604080	The effect we're witnessing here is absolutely what I discussed in my play is subversive
604080	605080	video.
605080	609560	The act of play inherently allows you to consider possibilities that run counter to the current
609560	610560	power structure.
610560	614280	So when the right wields power, they censor entertainment that sparks the imagination
614280	616320	while the left cries for free speech.
616320	619680	And when the left wields power, they censor entertainment that sparks the imagination
619680	621760	while the right cries for free speech.
621760	623240	Nothing has actually changed.
623240	625640	We've just been around long enough to see the pendulum swing.
625640	627380	This isn't just an old person thing.
627500	631140	There are middle aged people, even young people, who still believe that they're the current
631140	632340	counter culture.
632340	635300	Have no idea why zoomers are largely rejecting them.
635300	636300	YouTubers?
636300	637980	They're secret racists of course.
637980	638980	Hashtag?
638980	641460	You mean fashtag, the new alt-right hate symbol.
641460	643300	Even socialists are getting in on this.
643300	646580	Of course edgy memes are the neo-nazi entry point dude.
646580	649900	It's not that the youngsters are rejecting your political and cultural hegemony because
649900	651320	they value free speech.
651320	655580	Or hell, just for the sake of pissing you off for the fun of it, it has to be fascism.
655580	657820	Milk, the okay hand symbol, Pepe.
657820	662340	It's all just kids trolling adults and adults who still think that they're kids, yelling
662340	665420	and screaming about a rising tide of fascism that doesn't really exist.
665420	667260	Oh yeah, also anime porn.
667260	669340	If you whack off to hentai, you're a Trumpster.
669340	672740	Okay Karen, why don't we just go back to blaming Elvis for spiritual degeneracy?
672740	674740	I mean, why not?
674740	676580	Before it was video games, it was Dungeons and Dragons.
676580	679100	The Jack Chick comics were fucking hilarious by the way.
679100	680300	Before that, it was television.
680300	685420	Back in 1977, there was a high profile murder involving a 15 year old who was a TV addict
685420	688060	and so television shows had their own moral panic.
688060	692980	In 1948, three boys tortured and tried to kill another boy and the media said they were
692980	694400	comic book addicts.
694400	697980	Why worry about the atom bomb when America is filled with millions of comic fans?
697980	702780	In 1946, radio drama programs were ruining the youth of today.
702780	707900	In 1904, a young murderer was reported to have been addicted to dime novel reading.
707900	710360	It is the same thing every time.
710360	714500	From the turn of the century up to the leftists of today, people in power don't understand
714500	719380	why the youth reject them and so what young people do must be demonized.
719380	724560	Back in the day, a person who worked on the A&E show Intervention was known to anonymously
724560	726980	surf the video game board on 4chan.
726980	730540	Intervention is exactly what it sounds like, a reality TV show where they find mostly drug
730540	734060	addicts and go through their histories, their current lives, stage an intervention with
734060	737180	their families on camera and then follow up to see if they stayed sober.
737180	740100	The framing, the music, it's exactly what you'd expect from this kind of show.
740100	743660	But this anonymous person posted on V that soon, the episode lineup with the show's
743660	747340	first season would be revealed and that among the alcoholics and heroin addicts, there would
747340	749340	be an episode about video game addiction.
749340	754700	This episode became a meme immediately after it aired on May 1st, 2005 and reaction images
754700	758900	harvested from it are still occasionally used because it was over the top ridiculous.
758900	763380	The other addicts in the series are primarily physically dependent on their drug of choice.
763380	768420	Yes, they had shitty lives and those lives caused them to start using drugs but physical
768420	771860	dependence on those drugs was what was holding them back now.
771860	775860	Not so with Peter, who threw himself into video games because his entire life was shitty.
775860	779500	And it was pretty clear that while he would probably still be a casual gamer, he would
779500	784660	not be spending 18 hours straight playing Dance Dance Revolution if his family life
784660	785900	was not so fucked up.
785900	789220	And I think this is probably the case with Columbine, with the TV addict, the comic book
789220	790420	addict, the dime novel addict.
790420	795340	Moral panics are rarely justified but in those few cases where there appears to be a link,
795340	800320	I would bet that obsession over entertainment was not a cause of their violence but rather
800320	804600	a coping mechanism used to make their life bearable until it wasn't.
804600	809160	And it is particularly disgusting to see leftists, who spent literal generations being on the
809160	813760	receiving end of this shit in one form or another, suddenly turn a complete 180 on the
813760	815780	topic now that they're the popular culture.
815780	819320	The counterculture is definitionally counter-left right now.
819320	822940	And so of course they must be hidden fascists instead of hidden communists.
822940	827600	When the right says degenerate and subversive, the left says reactionary and problematic.
827600	829000	But it's ultimately the same thing.
829000	833240	However, the left is correct about one thing, that the political leanings of gamers appear
833240	834840	not to be leftist at all.
834840	840080	According to a survey conducted by the Entertainment Software Association, gamers, as a group,
840080	841880	appear to be more politically engaged than average.
841880	846800	They're more likely to vote, they lean left on social issues and right on economic ones,
846800	849280	and they prioritize the economy and their concerns.
849280	850960	In other words, they're libertarians.
850960	855480	And that is enough for smooth-brained socialists to consider gamers to be fascists, to the
855480	859720	point that, when Trump was feuding with journalists, if you were to notice that, regardless of
859720	864440	Trump's faults, the journalists also acted inappropriately, they would bring up the specter
864440	865680	of Gamergate.
865680	868080	This nonsense continues to the present day.
868080	872400	Six Days in Fallujah is a game that was shat on back during the Jack Thompson Fox News
872400	877200	era of video game censorship, by rightoids, because the Battle of Fallujah had just happened
877200	878260	and it was too soon.
878260	883820	It went into development hell only to resurf in 2021 and get shat on again by leftists
883820	885460	for glorifying the war in Iraq.
885460	890180	I have said consistently that the left and the right are both ultimately authoritarian
890180	891460	and I stand by that.
891460	895880	The fact that people can swing so wildly between the two opposite ends of the spectrum means
895880	898960	that the spectrum itself is factually inaccurate.
898960	903020	Radical leftism and radical rightism are just anti-individualism with different coats of
903020	904020	paint.
904020	907320	And these people never actually change their thinking or their behaviors, they're just
907320	909020	tyrants looking for a cause.
909020	912860	It's funny to see people who once defended Harry Potter from the Christian book burners
912900	915300	now burning those very same books themselves.
915300	919600	Yes, the situation surrounding Six Days in Fallujah spurred me into making this video,
919600	922260	but I realized pretty quickly it's ultimately a non-story.
922260	925520	In fact, even though it's only been a few days, I'm pretty sure it's blown over
925520	926520	at this point.
926520	930280	What I realized when thinking about the history of all this stuff is that the real story here
930280	932040	is the actions of gamers themselves.
932040	933880	Yes, gaming's shitty right now.
933880	938880	There's microtransactions, always online, battle royale, censorship from all sides,
938880	943620	loot boxes, screeching indie SJWs, China simps, and woke-skulled journalists.
943620	948100	But unlike every other community that SJWs planted their flag into, gamers didn't change.
948100	950760	They didn't cuck out and become socialists themselves.
950760	954620	They built a giant middle finger and have left it up to this very day.
954620	957900	They still want games that cater to their sensibilities and they're still getting
957900	958900	them.
958900	960860	Despite the screaming from the left that gamers are dead.
960860	964340	We declared them dead years ago guys, why are you still making games for them?
964340	968640	Those companies who go woke are slowly finding themselves going broke and it's actually
968640	969640	quite refreshing.
969640	974740	It's a slow process, all consumer revolts are, but it has been a long, patient string
974740	975740	of victories.
975740	979940	The Last of Us Part 2 is a disaster, while the Demon's Souls remake is not, and the
979940	981900	market is generally taking notice.
981900	986740	Even among indie games, stuff like Hollow Knight or Isaac is considered top tier despite
986740	987900	being decisively non-political.
987900	991460	I don't really know how to end this video, I just feel bright for the future of video
991460	993800	games, despite all the problems that we have.
993800	997660	Not because the SJWs are gone, nah they'll probably always be around, but because despite
997660	1002600	being propped up by every institution in this community, the actual rank and file gamers
1002600	1004000	are largely rejecting them.
1004000	1008740	I'm happy that I can still fire up my twitch stream and play what games I want to play
1008740	1011680	to an audience who I know aren't woke's goals themselves.
1011680	1016360	I'm happy that I can still pop over to Newgrounds or 4chan and talk to people who actually care
1016360	1017360	about games.
1017360	1022260	And I'm happy that the accredited, official, institutional parts of gaming culture have
1022260	1027120	massive overhead costs associated with them, while nobody actually gives a shit about whether
1027120	1028420	they live or die.
1028420	1033660	The left may have won the throne, but the peasants no longer swear fealty to it.
1033660	1035380	Thank you for watching my friends.
1035380	1040420	If you enjoyed this video, please feel free to share it around and do all the other algorithm-positive
1040420	1043380	stuff that the YouTube engagement metrics like, I don't know.

1052140	1052640	I love you.
