1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,200
Michael Bloomberg gave us all a wild ride, didn't he?

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:05,120
I mean, he shows up out of nowhere.

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:07,360
He's not even on the ballots of the first few states,

4
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:09,200
or part of the first Democratic debates,

5
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:13,040
and yet for a short while there it was Bloomberg, Bloomberg, Bloomberg everywhere.

6
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:17,360
I guess he was banking on the fact that he and Trump are once at least somewhat close.

7
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:20,800
Though to be fair, back in the 90s and 2000s Trump had connections everywhere

8
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:21,920
because he wasn't a politician.

9
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:25,200
Those connections basically fell apart when he won 2016.

10
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:28,480
But Bloomberg is ultimately cut from the same cloth as Trump.

11
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:31,600
He's not nearly as charismatic, his debate performance proved that,

12
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:35,120
but he's a rich New York oligarch that wanted to get into politics.

13
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:36,640
It's pretty much the same story.

14
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:38,960
And I bet Bloomberg's thought process was,

15
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:42,560
well, if Trump did it with the Republicans, surely I can do it with the Democrats, right?

16
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:43,680
I mean, I've got more money.

17
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:46,640
Like, way more money.

18
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:48,720
Ridiculously more money, in fact.

19
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:52,960
I gotta say, it's very strange for the Democratic party to have even allowed this to happen at all.

20
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:56,720
I mean, their base right now, their rhetoric is anti-billionaire,

21
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:59,200
and yet here's somebody who's far richer than Trump.

22
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:01,520
And in fact, his supporters kept repeating that,

23
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,360
that Bloomberg was richer than Trump.

24
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:05,600
As if this was some kind of own.

25
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:06,240
I don't get it.

26
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:10,480
I thought you guys were against wealth inequality, not neener, neener, I'm richer than you.

27
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:14,320
Though at the same time, considering that socialists often believe that

28
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:16,640
the rich is just somebody richer than them,

29
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:19,920
well, if you keep shifting those goalposts to their logical conclusion,

30
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,760
I guess Bloomberg can be a leftist.

31
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:25,520
So Bloomberg burned through a whole ton of money to try to get himself elected.

32
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:28,160
Nearly $500 million, I think, by the end.

33
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:29,520
That's a lot of money.

34
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:30,480
But not for him.

35
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:33,360
That's less than 1% of what Bloomberg's currently worth.

36
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,840
And oh boy, were there ads for him everywhere.

37
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:38,320
TV ads, radio ads, internet ads.

38
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:39,760
If you were in a Super Tuesday state,

39
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:42,800
you couldn't walk outside without tripping over Bloomberg's head somewhere.

40
00:01:55,520 --> 00:02:08,320
And yes, the rumors that he was paying off internet personalities to shill for him online,

41
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:09,520
that was true too.

42
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,680
YouTube, Instagram, TikTok, Twitter.

43
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,040
He put money into all of them.

44
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:15,200
How many of you stumbled across an account like this

45
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,960
while you were on social media recently?

46
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,640
Like Henry Ford Bloomberg.

47
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:21,520
This account will be solely for campaigning for Mike Bloomberg.

48
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:24,560
It's just some college student who needed money, I guess.

49
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,560
Hey kid, can you make me some memes?

50
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,560
Make me seem cool in the eyes of the other kids?

51
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,560
Post that shit on Twitter, that'll get me some votes.

52
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,400
Yeah, I'll pay for your college, don't worry about it.

53
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:38,320
Of course, as it turned out, the quality and accuracy of all of this stuff was dubious at best.

54
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:41,920
Mike Bloomberg's campaign has deleted a series of satirical tweets

55
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:45,600
where they invented quotes from Bernie Sanders about a host of dictators.

56
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:48,240
I guess they're banking on the fact that no one would be able to tell the truth

57
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:50,960
considering Bernie's actual quotes about some dictators.

58
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:54,000
But still, considering that those are probably $100,000 a tweet,

59
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,680
that's a pretty big loss to delete him.

60
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:00,160
However, he spent so much goddamn money and went up in the polls so much

61
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:04,000
that the DNC actually, by their own rules, had to take him seriously.

62
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,520
So when Mike Bloomberg asked for a delay to the next Democratic town hall,

63
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,520
CNN listened to him.

64
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:11,440
And yeah, did you guys watch that debate?

65
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,040
It was brutal.

66
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:17,840
Are you willing to release all of those women from those non-disclosure agreements

67
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:20,160
so we can hear their side of the story?

68
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:25,520
We have a very few non-disclosure agreements.

69
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,000
How many is that?

70
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,040
Let me finish.

71
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:27,760
How many is that?

72
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:33,840
None of them accuse me of doing anything other than maybe they didn't like the joke I told.

73
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:38,000
Fortunately, I make a lot of money and we do business all around the world

74
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,040
and we are preparing it.

75
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:43,120
The number of pages will probably be thousands of pages.

76
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,560
I can't go to TurboTax.

77
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:48,400
Mike found out the hard way that the one thing you can't really buy is charisma.

78
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:52,320
The official Team Bloomberg account on Twitter

79
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:55,840
decided to make a thread highlighting all the acts of vandalism

80
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,400
against the various campaign offices around the country.

81
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,480
And they kept ending each tweet with,

82
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,320
America deserves better.

83
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:07,360
Like the problem here is that these are inner-city locations that are plagued by poverty and crime.

84
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,240
And that this vandalism is happening by people breaking in

85
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:12,480
because they're trying to find stuff to sell, I guess?

86
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,040
I don't know.

87
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:15,040
You know, the narrative people push to desperation.

88
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,920
But really, this just looks like people don't like you, Mike.

89
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:19,920
I'm sorry, dude.

90
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:23,360
Probably the funniest one was the Bloomberg office in Flint.

91
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,360
That's some very polite graffiti there, isn't it?

92
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:27,360
They didn't spray paint the windows.

93
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:30,960
They just put up some paper and then spray painted on the paper.

94
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:33,760
Also, I do think it's probably worth pointing out that

95
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:36,880
Flint's landmark problem has been its lack of drinking water

96
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,800
for something like three or four years now.

97
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:43,840
It's a problem that the city of Flint estimates will take about $55 million to fix.

98
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:47,280
That is 10% of what Bloomberg wasted on this failed campaign.

99
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:51,120
I have a feeling that if he actually just foot the bill for fixing up Flint,

100
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:54,960
that would have gone a lot further than flooding ads everywhere that no one actually liked.

101
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:58,480
Oh, there's also the fact that Bloomberg, back in 2014,

102
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:02,080
backed Rick Snyder's campaign to the tune of $3 million.

103
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:06,000
Governor Snyder would go on to preside over the Flint water crisis

104
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,600
and mismanage it so badly that he bears personal significant legal responsibility for it.

105
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,440
You bet on the wrong horse, Mike.

106
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,200
What is it with all these wine moms?

107
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:18,800
Acting like the Democratic primary is a literal trial by combat or something.

108
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:21,520
I've never heard the crowd boo in any of these debates, not once.

109
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,760
Suddenly they're booing anyone who goes after Bloomberg.

110
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:26,240
Anyone who thinks this isn't sketchy has a baby brain.

111
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:30,080
It is absolutely up Bloomberg's alley to buy off crowds.

112
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,360
But get this take.

113
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,000
Good.

114
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,800
They must learn to leave Mike Bloomberg alone.

115
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,160
Yep, very good, Karen.

116
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,200
Thank you very much.

117
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:39,920
About 20 more tweets like that and your mortgage will be paid off.

118
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:42,720
And then there was this weird video.

119
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:46,480
We call on Senator Sanders to condemn the hateful speech from his supporters

120
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:48,400
and end the Trump-like rhetoric.

121
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,080
America deserves better.

122
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:55,120
Yeah, dude, even as this guy floods the internet using paid shills to spit out his nonsense,

123
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:59,360
he's also crying about mean tweets, I guess.

124
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:02,720
I will say, though, I do recognize a couple of shitlords in this video.

125
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:06,320
Congratulations to everyone who made it into Bloomberg's meme reel.

126
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:10,880
Also, Bloomberg believes that the astrological powers that be will hand him the win.

127
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:12,160
What the hell?

128
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:16,960
You fellow Aquarians, I just want you to know that we are thoughtful.

129
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,680
We are independent and even keel.

130
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:25,520
And it will not surprise you to know that our current president is not an Aquarian.

131
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:26,320
He's a Gemini.

132
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:28,880
I knew you wouldn't be surprised.

133
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,240
Rip that Gemini vote.

134
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,640
Wait, I'm a Gemini.

135
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:35,760
Of course, behind the stupidity, there are more serious problems.

136
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:39,600
Bloomberg definitely dug into Bernie for praising Fidel Castro.

137
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,000
But at least Bernie did that some time ago.

138
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,280
Bloomberg recently praised Chinese communism.

139
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:48,640
The former New York mayor signaled that he intends to run in the

140
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:52,240
unrepentant Stalinist lane of the Democratic primary.

141
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:55,920
Bloomberg argued that the Chinese Communist Party was ecologically friendly,

142
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:59,760
democratically accountable and invulnerable to the threat of revolution.

143
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:04,000
Bloomberg, the Communist Party wants to stay in power in China, and they listen to the public.

144
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,760
When the public says I can't breathe the air, Xi Jinping is not a dictator.

145
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:10,400
He has to satisfy his constituents or he's not going to survive.

146
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,000
He's not a dictator?

147
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,800
No, he has a constituency to answer to.

148
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:15,760
He doesn't have a vote.

149
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:16,800
He doesn't have democracy.

150
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,640
He's not held accountable by voters.

151
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:22,480
If his advisors gave him, is the check on him just a revolution?

152
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:24,080
You're not going to have a revolution.

153
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:27,120
No government survives without the will of the majority of its people.

154
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:30,800
I don't think Bloomberg understands how politics works.

155
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:32,800
There's also this.

156
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:35,760
64 different women have filed 40 lawsuits against

157
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:38,480
Michael Bloomberg for sexual harassment and discrimination.

158
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:41,520
In Bloomberg's 1997 autobiography,

159
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:46,320
staffers found themselves uncomfortably reading their billionaire founders' boasts

160
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:49,120
about keeping a girlfriend in every city and other

161
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,760
womanizing exploits as a Wall Street up and comer.

162
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:53,360
Here's a few fun quotes.

163
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,680
I like theater, dining and chasing women.

164
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,480
I really want to have Jennifer Lopez.

165
00:07:58,480 --> 00:07:59,920
I mean, have dinner with her.

166
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:04,560
A top aide said Bloomberg frequently remarked nice tits upon seeing attractive women.

167
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:07,120
If women wanted to be appreciated for their brains,

168
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,760
they'd go to the library instead of to Bloomingdale's.

169
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:12,480
And of the computer terminal that made him a billionaire,

170
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:14,720
it will do everything, including give you head.

171
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:17,200
I guess that puts a lot of you girls out of business.

172
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:20,880
This is of the same caliber as Trump's grab him by the pussy comments, but

173
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:24,480
no one's really raising an uproar this time, are they?

174
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:28,080
I guess stuff like sexual assault or objectification is completely fine

175
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:30,960
to the establishment left as long as you have the right politics.

176
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:34,240
It seems to be the same thing regarding Bloomberg's record on race.

177
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,560
Here's the mayor who instituted stop and frisk.

178
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:39,600
And yet the Democratic Party is just welcoming him with open arms.

179
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,520
Oh, no, wait, here's their defense.

180
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:45,760
Democrats are condemning Bloomberg because 64 women have accused him of speaking nasty.

181
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,920
Bloomberg employs 20,000 people.

182
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:51,840
64 people is 0.003 percent.

183
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:55,200
Instead of praising the man for creating 20,000 jobs,

184
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:58,800
let's berate him because 0.003 percent complained.

185
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,800
With that attitude, we will reelect Trump.

186
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,640
Not only is this an incredible reach,

187
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:06,480
but it is probably the worst case of Trump derangement syndrome I've ever seen.

188
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,000
Trump is not Satan.

189
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,880
It is certainly possible that there could be people running

190
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:13,680
within the Democratic Party that are worse than Trump.

191
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,760
And Bloomberg's probably one of them.

192
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:16,400
Sorry.

193
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:21,040
Well, all this time, all this money spent flooding ads everywhere,

194
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:25,440
hiring people on social media, doing whatever it is that you can to buy an election.

195
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,600
Where did it get Mike Bloomberg in the end?

196
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:32,400
What has the past three months and 500 million dollars really culminated in?

197
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,320
Womp, womp.

198
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:38,320
Michael Bloomberg ends U.S. presidential campaign.

199
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,880
He decided to endorse Biden, by the way.

200
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,160
What the hell was the point of that?

201
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:45,760
Mike, you could have literally just endorsed Biden.

202
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:50,720
You didn't need to run around for three months and blow all this money on literally nothing.

203
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:53,600
Everyone knew you weren't going to go anywhere with this, man.

204
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,920
Like, were you being taken on a ride by somebody?

205
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:56,640
I don't get it.

206
00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:00,000
Did you have to launder 500 million really quick for some reason?

207
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,120
The most interesting thing about the rise and fall of Mike Bloomberg

208
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:06,320
is that it did actually expose how easy it would be

209
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,960
for a billionaire oligarch to buy an election.

210
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,560
Mike only spent 500 million.

211
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:14,560
What if he decided to actually spend like 5 billion or something

212
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:17,600
and start six months earlier so he was actually ready to go?

213
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,400
Who knows?

214
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:21,360
In that case, we might actually see a Bloomberg nomination.

215
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,520
He threw so much money at the process

216
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:26,880
that all of his flaws didn't matter, at least until he had to debate.

217
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:29,520
In my opinion, the debate is what fundamentally killed him.

218
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,680
And you know, with all that money, Bloomberg,

219
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:34,400
you probably could have spent a little bit on debating lessons, come on.

220
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,680
But what do we do next time?

221
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,040
What do we do in 2024?

222
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:40,960
What do we do when some rich jerk who's not actually interested in being a public servant

223
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:45,440
decides to dump an entire fortune on an election and simply win it like that?

224
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:50,400
I mean, we've been complaining now for over a decade about the danger of super PACs

225
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:54,240
on how elites can funnel near unlimited amounts of money into campaigns.

226
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,760
But Bloomberg bypassed all that.

227
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,440
He just ran himself.

228
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,440
Of course, there is the alternative angle.

229
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:04,320
People are screeching bloody murder at the fact that Bloomberg tried to buy an election.

230
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:07,040
And fair enough, there's a lot wrong with that.

231
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:11,040
But a lot of the Democratic establishment right now, they're doing the same thing.

232
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,880
They're just not spending their own money.

233
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:15,520
When a candidate promises the electorate free stuff,

234
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:20,560
it can be health care, it can be schooling, student loans, housing, food, you name it,

235
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,320
that stuff still has to be paid for.

236
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:27,120
It still has to be produced by somebody and they have to be compensated for their labor.

237
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:30,960
So while Bloomberg's attempt to buy an election is unconscionable,

238
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:35,520
there's also a very strong argument that any candidate running on a platform of

239
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:38,640
we will take stuff away from the rich, stuff that they earned,

240
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:42,160
and by the way that you won't take away because they're just going to go to a different country,

241
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:45,280
but we'll take it away from them and we'll give it to the rest of you.

242
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:47,680
That's still fundamentally buying an election.

243
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:50,400
It's just that the candidate's not using their own money to buy it.

244
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:54,800
They're writing a giant IOU, one that will probably end up being worthless in the long run.

245
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,960
Every system of government has its flaws.

246
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:59,280
Democracy too, even though I think it's the best one.

247
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:02,240
At one point, only landowners were allowed to vote.

248
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:04,320
The claim nowadays is that that was racist.

249
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:07,760
It meant that poor people or disenfranchised people could never actually have a say

250
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:10,560
in the workings of the government and their voice needs to be heard.

251
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,560
And fair enough, I agree with that assessment.

252
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:17,760
But the logic behind only landowners having a vote was because back at that time period,

253
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:21,760
landowners had a disproportionate amount to lose from government policy.

254
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:25,520
People who didn't own land back then, they wouldn't have to worry about, for example,

255
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:27,520
what happens to their property during a war.

256
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:29,920
What happens if it's reappropriated by the state?

257
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:32,960
A simplistic example of this fear would be something like,

258
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:35,440
okay, you have a guy who owns a parcel of land,

259
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:38,960
and then suddenly 50 squatters show up and want to squat on that land.

260
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:42,480
And because everyone can vote, the local county has an election,

261
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:45,520
all the squatters vote for the candidate that will allow them to squat on the land,

262
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:47,360
and suddenly the guy's property rights don't matter.

263
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,760
It's a far-fetched example, but it's what they were trying to prevent.

264
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:52,880
Later in history, it was decided that only men could vote and not women.

265
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:55,680
Again, the argument against this was that it was fundamentally sexist,

266
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:58,480
that women should have a say in how the nations run because they live in it,

267
00:12:58,480 --> 00:12:59,360
they're citizens of it.

268
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:01,040
And I also fundamentally agree.

269
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:03,360
But I also understand the other side of the argument.

270
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:07,440
If only men are getting drafted, if only men have to go to war,

271
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:10,480
why should women have a vote in whether or not the nation goes to war?

272
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:13,120
It's not them putting their lives on the line.

273
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:17,040
In that way, the right to vote was tied to the obligation to serve in the military.

274
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,960
But now we have a completely different problem.

275
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:22,400
And no, I'm not advocating for removing the right to vote from everyone,

276
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:24,400
I'm simply describing the problem that we have.

277
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:28,240
We are in a situation where a sizable amount of the population is completely apolitical.

278
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,360
They just don't care.

279
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:33,360
They don't care what the left, the right, Republicans, Democrats, it doesn't matter.

280
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:37,280
The best way to get those people to vote is to promise them something for nothing.

281
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:41,520
It's to promise them a sale, a good deal, a buy one, get one free.

282
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:45,360
The same thing that a lot of local stores do when they hand out flyers or announce

283
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,880
or announce deals or something.

284
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,720
They say, hey, you come, you shop here.

285
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,400
Well, we got all this stuff on sale.

286
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:53,280
Here's all the reasons you should shop with us rather than our competitor.

287
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:57,200
Because we have a large mass of people that are politically disengaged,

288
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:59,760
that is fundamentally what politics has turned into.

289
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,760
Vote for me, I'll give you an Obama phone.

290
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:03,600
Vote for me, there's free health care.

291
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:04,800
Vote for me, schooling.

292
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,000
Vote for me, housing.

293
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,360
The apolitical person won't actually care too much about the issues.

294
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:12,000
They'll simply take whatever deal sounds good to them.

295
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,840
And the apathy of the voter is a well-known major flaw of universal suffrage.

296
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:17,920
It has been since long before I was born.

297
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:23,120
And Michael Bloomberg's campaign represents that flaw taken to its logical extreme.

298
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:25,920
He didn't even need to promise anything concrete.

299
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:28,240
He just had to spend, spend, spend.

300
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:31,520
Of course, what fixes this is not removing universal suffrage.

301
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:34,400
It's encouraging a more engaged voting population.

302
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:38,320
People who will actually think through the issues and consider what is the best course

303
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:43,280
of action for the nation and not simply voting because this guy promised me free shit that I want.

304
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:44,960
Anyway, Bloomberg's a joke.

305
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:46,080
I'm glad he's gone.

306
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:47,600
I'll see you next time.

307
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:48,160
I love you.

308
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:34,160
Thank you.
