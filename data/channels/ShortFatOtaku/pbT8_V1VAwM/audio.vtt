00:00.000 --> 00:03.200
Michael Bloomberg gave us all a wild ride, didn't he?

00:03.200 --> 00:05.120
I mean, he shows up out of nowhere.

00:05.120 --> 00:07.360
He's not even on the ballots of the first few states,

00:07.360 --> 00:09.200
or part of the first Democratic debates,

00:09.200 --> 00:13.040
and yet for a short while there it was Bloomberg, Bloomberg, Bloomberg everywhere.

00:13.040 --> 00:17.360
I guess he was banking on the fact that he and Trump are once at least somewhat close.

00:17.360 --> 00:20.800
Though to be fair, back in the 90s and 2000s Trump had connections everywhere

00:20.800 --> 00:21.920
because he wasn't a politician.

00:21.920 --> 00:25.200
Those connections basically fell apart when he won 2016.

00:25.200 --> 00:28.480
But Bloomberg is ultimately cut from the same cloth as Trump.

00:28.480 --> 00:31.600
He's not nearly as charismatic, his debate performance proved that,

00:31.600 --> 00:35.120
but he's a rich New York oligarch that wanted to get into politics.

00:35.120 --> 00:36.640
It's pretty much the same story.

00:36.640 --> 00:38.960
And I bet Bloomberg's thought process was,

00:38.960 --> 00:42.560
well, if Trump did it with the Republicans, surely I can do it with the Democrats, right?

00:42.560 --> 00:43.680
I mean, I've got more money.

00:44.400 --> 00:46.640
Like, way more money.

00:46.640 --> 00:48.720
Ridiculously more money, in fact.

00:48.720 --> 00:52.960
I gotta say, it's very strange for the Democratic party to have even allowed this to happen at all.

00:52.960 --> 00:56.720
I mean, their base right now, their rhetoric is anti-billionaire,

00:56.720 --> 00:59.200
and yet here's somebody who's far richer than Trump.

00:59.200 --> 01:01.520
And in fact, his supporters kept repeating that,

01:01.520 --> 01:03.360
that Bloomberg was richer than Trump.

01:03.360 --> 01:05.600
As if this was some kind of own.

01:05.600 --> 01:06.240
I don't get it.

01:06.240 --> 01:10.480
I thought you guys were against wealth inequality, not neener, neener, I'm richer than you.

01:10.480 --> 01:14.320
Though at the same time, considering that socialists often believe that

01:14.320 --> 01:16.640
the rich is just somebody richer than them,

01:16.640 --> 01:19.920
well, if you keep shifting those goalposts to their logical conclusion,

01:19.920 --> 01:21.760
I guess Bloomberg can be a leftist.

01:21.760 --> 01:25.520
So Bloomberg burned through a whole ton of money to try to get himself elected.

01:25.520 --> 01:28.160
Nearly $500 million, I think, by the end.

01:28.160 --> 01:29.520
That's a lot of money.

01:29.520 --> 01:30.480
But not for him.

01:30.480 --> 01:33.360
That's less than 1% of what Bloomberg's currently worth.

01:33.360 --> 01:35.840
And oh boy, were there ads for him everywhere.

01:35.840 --> 01:38.320
TV ads, radio ads, internet ads.

01:38.320 --> 01:39.760
If you were in a Super Tuesday state,

01:39.760 --> 01:42.800
you couldn't walk outside without tripping over Bloomberg's head somewhere.

01:55.520 --> 02:08.320
And yes, the rumors that he was paying off internet personalities to shill for him online,

02:08.320 --> 02:09.520
that was true too.

02:09.520 --> 02:11.680
YouTube, Instagram, TikTok, Twitter.

02:11.680 --> 02:13.040
He put money into all of them.

02:13.040 --> 02:15.200
How many of you stumbled across an account like this

02:15.200 --> 02:16.960
while you were on social media recently?

02:16.960 --> 02:18.640
Like Henry Ford Bloomberg.

02:18.640 --> 02:21.520
This account will be solely for campaigning for Mike Bloomberg.

02:21.520 --> 02:24.560
It's just some college student who needed money, I guess.

02:24.560 --> 02:26.560
Hey kid, can you make me some memes?

02:26.560 --> 02:28.560
Make me seem cool in the eyes of the other kids?

02:28.560 --> 02:30.560
Post that shit on Twitter, that'll get me some votes.

02:30.560 --> 02:32.400
Yeah, I'll pay for your college, don't worry about it.

02:32.400 --> 02:38.320
Of course, as it turned out, the quality and accuracy of all of this stuff was dubious at best.

02:38.320 --> 02:41.920
Mike Bloomberg's campaign has deleted a series of satirical tweets

02:41.920 --> 02:45.600
where they invented quotes from Bernie Sanders about a host of dictators.

02:45.600 --> 02:48.240
I guess they're banking on the fact that no one would be able to tell the truth

02:48.240 --> 02:50.960
considering Bernie's actual quotes about some dictators.

02:50.960 --> 02:54.000
But still, considering that those are probably $100,000 a tweet,

02:54.000 --> 02:55.680
that's a pretty big loss to delete him.

02:55.680 --> 03:00.160
However, he spent so much goddamn money and went up in the polls so much

03:00.160 --> 03:04.000
that the DNC actually, by their own rules, had to take him seriously.

03:04.000 --> 03:07.520
So when Mike Bloomberg asked for a delay to the next Democratic town hall,

03:08.080 --> 03:09.520
CNN listened to him.

03:09.520 --> 03:11.440
And yeah, did you guys watch that debate?

03:12.000 --> 03:13.040
It was brutal.

03:13.040 --> 03:17.840
Are you willing to release all of those women from those non-disclosure agreements

03:17.840 --> 03:20.160
so we can hear their side of the story?

03:21.120 --> 03:25.520
We have a very few non-disclosure agreements.

03:25.520 --> 03:26.000
How many is that?

03:26.000 --> 03:27.040
Let me finish.

03:27.040 --> 03:27.760
How many is that?

03:27.760 --> 03:33.840
None of them accuse me of doing anything other than maybe they didn't like the joke I told.

03:33.840 --> 03:38.000
Fortunately, I make a lot of money and we do business all around the world

03:38.000 --> 03:39.040
and we are preparing it.

03:39.760 --> 03:43.120
The number of pages will probably be thousands of pages.

03:43.120 --> 03:44.560
I can't go to TurboTax.

03:44.560 --> 03:48.400
Mike found out the hard way that the one thing you can't really buy is charisma.

03:48.400 --> 03:52.320
The official Team Bloomberg account on Twitter

03:52.320 --> 03:55.840
decided to make a thread highlighting all the acts of vandalism

03:55.840 --> 03:58.400
against the various campaign offices around the country.

03:58.400 --> 04:00.480
And they kept ending each tweet with,

04:00.480 --> 04:02.320
America deserves better.

04:02.320 --> 04:07.360
Like the problem here is that these are inner-city locations that are plagued by poverty and crime.

04:07.360 --> 04:10.240
And that this vandalism is happening by people breaking in

04:10.240 --> 04:12.480
because they're trying to find stuff to sell, I guess?

04:12.480 --> 04:13.040
I don't know.

04:13.040 --> 04:15.040
You know, the narrative people push to desperation.

04:15.040 --> 04:17.920
But really, this just looks like people don't like you, Mike.

04:18.800 --> 04:19.920
I'm sorry, dude.

04:19.920 --> 04:23.360
Probably the funniest one was the Bloomberg office in Flint.

04:23.360 --> 04:25.360
That's some very polite graffiti there, isn't it?

04:25.920 --> 04:27.360
They didn't spray paint the windows.

04:27.360 --> 04:30.960
They just put up some paper and then spray painted on the paper.

04:30.960 --> 04:33.760
Also, I do think it's probably worth pointing out that

04:33.760 --> 04:36.880
Flint's landmark problem has been its lack of drinking water

04:36.880 --> 04:38.800
for something like three or four years now.

04:38.800 --> 04:43.840
It's a problem that the city of Flint estimates will take about $55 million to fix.

04:43.840 --> 04:47.280
That is 10% of what Bloomberg wasted on this failed campaign.

04:47.280 --> 04:51.120
I have a feeling that if he actually just foot the bill for fixing up Flint,

04:51.120 --> 04:54.960
that would have gone a lot further than flooding ads everywhere that no one actually liked.

04:54.960 --> 04:58.480
Oh, there's also the fact that Bloomberg, back in 2014,

04:58.480 --> 05:02.080
backed Rick Snyder's campaign to the tune of $3 million.

05:02.080 --> 05:06.000
Governor Snyder would go on to preside over the Flint water crisis

05:06.000 --> 05:11.600
and mismanage it so badly that he bears personal significant legal responsibility for it.

05:11.600 --> 05:13.440
You bet on the wrong horse, Mike.

05:13.440 --> 05:15.200
What is it with all these wine moms?

05:15.280 --> 05:18.800
Acting like the Democratic primary is a literal trial by combat or something.

05:18.800 --> 05:21.520
I've never heard the crowd boo in any of these debates, not once.

05:21.520 --> 05:23.760
Suddenly they're booing anyone who goes after Bloomberg.

05:23.760 --> 05:26.240
Anyone who thinks this isn't sketchy has a baby brain.

05:26.240 --> 05:30.080
It is absolutely up Bloomberg's alley to buy off crowds.

05:30.080 --> 05:31.360
But get this take.

05:31.360 --> 05:32.000
Good.

05:32.000 --> 05:34.800
They must learn to leave Mike Bloomberg alone.

05:34.800 --> 05:36.160
Yep, very good, Karen.

05:36.160 --> 05:37.200
Thank you very much.

05:37.200 --> 05:39.920
About 20 more tweets like that and your mortgage will be paid off.

05:40.640 --> 05:42.720
And then there was this weird video.

05:42.720 --> 05:46.480
We call on Senator Sanders to condemn the hateful speech from his supporters

05:46.480 --> 05:48.400
and end the Trump-like rhetoric.

05:48.400 --> 05:50.080
America deserves better.

05:50.080 --> 05:55.120
Yeah, dude, even as this guy floods the internet using paid shills to spit out his nonsense,

05:55.120 --> 05:59.360
he's also crying about mean tweets, I guess.

05:59.360 --> 06:02.720
I will say, though, I do recognize a couple of shitlords in this video.

06:02.720 --> 06:06.320
Congratulations to everyone who made it into Bloomberg's meme reel.

06:06.320 --> 06:10.880
Also, Bloomberg believes that the astrological powers that be will hand him the win.

06:11.520 --> 06:12.160
What the hell?

06:12.720 --> 06:16.960
You fellow Aquarians, I just want you to know that we are thoughtful.

06:16.960 --> 06:19.680
We are independent and even keel.

06:20.240 --> 06:25.520
And it will not surprise you to know that our current president is not an Aquarian.

06:25.520 --> 06:26.320
He's a Gemini.

06:27.280 --> 06:28.880
I knew you wouldn't be surprised.

06:28.880 --> 06:30.240
Rip that Gemini vote.

06:30.960 --> 06:32.640
Wait, I'm a Gemini.

06:32.640 --> 06:35.760
Of course, behind the stupidity, there are more serious problems.

06:35.760 --> 06:39.600
Bloomberg definitely dug into Bernie for praising Fidel Castro.

06:39.600 --> 06:42.000
But at least Bernie did that some time ago.

06:42.000 --> 06:45.280
Bloomberg recently praised Chinese communism.

06:45.280 --> 06:48.640
The former New York mayor signaled that he intends to run in the

06:48.640 --> 06:52.240
unrepentant Stalinist lane of the Democratic primary.

06:52.240 --> 06:55.920
Bloomberg argued that the Chinese Communist Party was ecologically friendly,

06:55.920 --> 06:59.760
democratically accountable and invulnerable to the threat of revolution.

06:59.760 --> 07:04.000
Bloomberg, the Communist Party wants to stay in power in China, and they listen to the public.

07:04.000 --> 07:07.760
When the public says I can't breathe the air, Xi Jinping is not a dictator.

07:07.760 --> 07:10.400
He has to satisfy his constituents or he's not going to survive.

07:10.960 --> 07:12.000
He's not a dictator?

07:12.720 --> 07:14.800
No, he has a constituency to answer to.

07:14.800 --> 07:15.760
He doesn't have a vote.

07:15.760 --> 07:16.800
He doesn't have democracy.

07:16.800 --> 07:18.640
He's not held accountable by voters.

07:18.640 --> 07:22.480
If his advisors gave him, is the check on him just a revolution?

07:22.480 --> 07:24.080
You're not going to have a revolution.

07:24.080 --> 07:27.120
No government survives without the will of the majority of its people.

07:27.120 --> 07:30.800
I don't think Bloomberg understands how politics works.

07:31.520 --> 07:32.800
There's also this.

07:32.800 --> 07:35.760
64 different women have filed 40 lawsuits against

07:35.760 --> 07:38.480
Michael Bloomberg for sexual harassment and discrimination.

07:38.480 --> 07:41.520
In Bloomberg's 1997 autobiography,

07:41.520 --> 07:46.320
staffers found themselves uncomfortably reading their billionaire founders' boasts

07:46.320 --> 07:49.120
about keeping a girlfriend in every city and other

07:49.120 --> 07:51.760
womanizing exploits as a Wall Street up and comer.

07:51.760 --> 07:53.360
Here's a few fun quotes.

07:53.360 --> 07:55.680
I like theater, dining and chasing women.

07:56.240 --> 07:58.480
I really want to have Jennifer Lopez.

07:58.480 --> 07:59.920
I mean, have dinner with her.

07:59.920 --> 08:04.560
A top aide said Bloomberg frequently remarked nice tits upon seeing attractive women.

08:04.560 --> 08:07.120
If women wanted to be appreciated for their brains,

08:07.120 --> 08:09.760
they'd go to the library instead of to Bloomingdale's.

08:09.760 --> 08:12.480
And of the computer terminal that made him a billionaire,

08:12.480 --> 08:14.720
it will do everything, including give you head.

08:14.720 --> 08:17.200
I guess that puts a lot of you girls out of business.

08:17.200 --> 08:20.880
This is of the same caliber as Trump's grab him by the pussy comments, but

08:21.680 --> 08:24.480
no one's really raising an uproar this time, are they?

08:24.480 --> 08:28.080
I guess stuff like sexual assault or objectification is completely fine

08:28.080 --> 08:30.960
to the establishment left as long as you have the right politics.

08:30.960 --> 08:34.240
It seems to be the same thing regarding Bloomberg's record on race.

08:34.240 --> 08:36.560
Here's the mayor who instituted stop and frisk.

08:36.560 --> 08:39.600
And yet the Democratic Party is just welcoming him with open arms.

08:39.600 --> 08:41.520
Oh, no, wait, here's their defense.

08:41.520 --> 08:45.760
Democrats are condemning Bloomberg because 64 women have accused him of speaking nasty.

08:45.760 --> 08:47.920
Bloomberg employs 20,000 people.

08:48.560 --> 08:51.840
64 people is 0.003 percent.

08:52.400 --> 08:55.200
Instead of praising the man for creating 20,000 jobs,

08:55.200 --> 08:58.800
let's berate him because 0.003 percent complained.

08:58.800 --> 09:00.800
With that attitude, we will reelect Trump.

09:00.800 --> 09:02.640
Not only is this an incredible reach,

09:02.640 --> 09:06.480
but it is probably the worst case of Trump derangement syndrome I've ever seen.

09:06.480 --> 09:08.000
Trump is not Satan.

09:08.000 --> 09:10.880
It is certainly possible that there could be people running

09:10.880 --> 09:13.680
within the Democratic Party that are worse than Trump.

09:14.240 --> 09:15.760
And Bloomberg's probably one of them.

09:15.760 --> 09:16.400
Sorry.

09:16.400 --> 09:21.040
Well, all this time, all this money spent flooding ads everywhere,

09:21.040 --> 09:25.440
hiring people on social media, doing whatever it is that you can to buy an election.

09:25.440 --> 09:27.600
Where did it get Mike Bloomberg in the end?

09:27.600 --> 09:32.400
What has the past three months and 500 million dollars really culminated in?

09:33.040 --> 09:34.320
Womp, womp.

09:34.880 --> 09:38.320
Michael Bloomberg ends U.S. presidential campaign.

09:38.320 --> 09:40.880
He decided to endorse Biden, by the way.

09:40.880 --> 09:42.160
What the hell was the point of that?

09:42.720 --> 09:45.760
Mike, you could have literally just endorsed Biden.

09:45.760 --> 09:50.720
You didn't need to run around for three months and blow all this money on literally nothing.

09:50.720 --> 09:53.600
Everyone knew you weren't going to go anywhere with this, man.

09:53.600 --> 09:55.920
Like, were you being taken on a ride by somebody?

09:55.920 --> 09:56.640
I don't get it.

09:56.640 --> 10:00.000
Did you have to launder 500 million really quick for some reason?

10:00.000 --> 10:03.120
The most interesting thing about the rise and fall of Mike Bloomberg

10:03.120 --> 10:06.320
is that it did actually expose how easy it would be

10:06.320 --> 10:08.960
for a billionaire oligarch to buy an election.

10:08.960 --> 10:10.560
Mike only spent 500 million.

10:10.560 --> 10:14.560
What if he decided to actually spend like 5 billion or something

10:14.560 --> 10:17.600
and start six months earlier so he was actually ready to go?

10:17.600 --> 10:18.400
Who knows?

10:18.400 --> 10:21.360
In that case, we might actually see a Bloomberg nomination.

10:21.360 --> 10:23.520
He threw so much money at the process

10:23.520 --> 10:26.880
that all of his flaws didn't matter, at least until he had to debate.

10:26.880 --> 10:29.520
In my opinion, the debate is what fundamentally killed him.

10:29.600 --> 10:31.680
And you know, with all that money, Bloomberg,

10:31.680 --> 10:34.400
you probably could have spent a little bit on debating lessons, come on.

10:34.400 --> 10:35.680
But what do we do next time?

10:35.680 --> 10:37.040
What do we do in 2024?

10:37.040 --> 10:40.960
What do we do when some rich jerk who's not actually interested in being a public servant

10:40.960 --> 10:45.440
decides to dump an entire fortune on an election and simply win it like that?

10:45.440 --> 10:50.400
I mean, we've been complaining now for over a decade about the danger of super PACs

10:50.400 --> 10:54.240
on how elites can funnel near unlimited amounts of money into campaigns.

10:54.240 --> 10:55.760
But Bloomberg bypassed all that.

10:55.760 --> 10:57.440
He just ran himself.

10:57.440 --> 10:59.440
Of course, there is the alternative angle.

11:00.240 --> 11:04.320
People are screeching bloody murder at the fact that Bloomberg tried to buy an election.

11:04.320 --> 11:07.040
And fair enough, there's a lot wrong with that.

11:07.040 --> 11:11.040
But a lot of the Democratic establishment right now, they're doing the same thing.

11:11.040 --> 11:12.880
They're just not spending their own money.

11:12.880 --> 11:15.520
When a candidate promises the electorate free stuff,

11:15.520 --> 11:20.560
it can be health care, it can be schooling, student loans, housing, food, you name it,

11:20.560 --> 11:22.320
that stuff still has to be paid for.

11:22.320 --> 11:27.120
It still has to be produced by somebody and they have to be compensated for their labor.

11:27.120 --> 11:30.960
So while Bloomberg's attempt to buy an election is unconscionable,

11:30.960 --> 11:35.520
there's also a very strong argument that any candidate running on a platform of

11:35.520 --> 11:38.640
we will take stuff away from the rich, stuff that they earned,

11:38.640 --> 11:42.160
and by the way that you won't take away because they're just going to go to a different country,

11:42.160 --> 11:45.280
but we'll take it away from them and we'll give it to the rest of you.

11:45.280 --> 11:47.680
That's still fundamentally buying an election.

11:47.680 --> 11:50.400
It's just that the candidate's not using their own money to buy it.

11:50.400 --> 11:54.800
They're writing a giant IOU, one that will probably end up being worthless in the long run.

11:54.800 --> 11:56.960
Every system of government has its flaws.

11:56.960 --> 11:59.280
Democracy too, even though I think it's the best one.

11:59.280 --> 12:02.240
At one point, only landowners were allowed to vote.

12:02.240 --> 12:04.320
The claim nowadays is that that was racist.

12:04.320 --> 12:07.760
It meant that poor people or disenfranchised people could never actually have a say

12:07.760 --> 12:10.560
in the workings of the government and their voice needs to be heard.

12:10.560 --> 12:12.560
And fair enough, I agree with that assessment.

12:12.560 --> 12:17.760
But the logic behind only landowners having a vote was because back at that time period,

12:17.760 --> 12:21.760
landowners had a disproportionate amount to lose from government policy.

12:21.760 --> 12:25.520
People who didn't own land back then, they wouldn't have to worry about, for example,

12:25.520 --> 12:27.520
what happens to their property during a war.

12:27.520 --> 12:29.920
What happens if it's reappropriated by the state?

12:29.920 --> 12:32.960
A simplistic example of this fear would be something like,

12:32.960 --> 12:35.440
okay, you have a guy who owns a parcel of land,

12:35.440 --> 12:38.960
and then suddenly 50 squatters show up and want to squat on that land.

12:38.960 --> 12:42.480
And because everyone can vote, the local county has an election,

12:42.480 --> 12:45.520
all the squatters vote for the candidate that will allow them to squat on the land,

12:45.520 --> 12:47.360
and suddenly the guy's property rights don't matter.

12:47.360 --> 12:49.760
It's a far-fetched example, but it's what they were trying to prevent.

12:49.760 --> 12:52.880
Later in history, it was decided that only men could vote and not women.

12:52.880 --> 12:55.680
Again, the argument against this was that it was fundamentally sexist,

12:55.680 --> 12:58.480
that women should have a say in how the nations run because they live in it,

12:58.480 --> 12:59.360
they're citizens of it.

12:59.360 --> 13:01.040
And I also fundamentally agree.

13:01.040 --> 13:03.360
But I also understand the other side of the argument.

13:03.360 --> 13:07.440
If only men are getting drafted, if only men have to go to war,

13:07.440 --> 13:10.480
why should women have a vote in whether or not the nation goes to war?

13:11.120 --> 13:13.120
It's not them putting their lives on the line.

13:13.120 --> 13:17.040
In that way, the right to vote was tied to the obligation to serve in the military.

13:17.040 --> 13:18.960
But now we have a completely different problem.

13:18.960 --> 13:22.400
And no, I'm not advocating for removing the right to vote from everyone,

13:22.400 --> 13:24.400
I'm simply describing the problem that we have.

13:24.400 --> 13:28.240
We are in a situation where a sizable amount of the population is completely apolitical.

13:28.240 --> 13:29.360
They just don't care.

13:29.360 --> 13:33.360
They don't care what the left, the right, Republicans, Democrats, it doesn't matter.

13:33.360 --> 13:37.280
The best way to get those people to vote is to promise them something for nothing.

13:37.280 --> 13:41.520
It's to promise them a sale, a good deal, a buy one, get one free.

13:41.520 --> 13:45.360
The same thing that a lot of local stores do when they hand out flyers or announce

13:45.360 --> 13:46.880
or announce deals or something.

13:46.880 --> 13:48.720
They say, hey, you come, you shop here.

13:48.720 --> 13:50.400
Well, we got all this stuff on sale.

13:50.400 --> 13:53.280
Here's all the reasons you should shop with us rather than our competitor.

13:53.280 --> 13:57.200
Because we have a large mass of people that are politically disengaged,

13:57.200 --> 13:59.760
that is fundamentally what politics has turned into.

13:59.760 --> 14:01.760
Vote for me, I'll give you an Obama phone.

14:01.760 --> 14:03.600
Vote for me, there's free health care.

14:03.600 --> 14:04.800
Vote for me, schooling.

14:04.800 --> 14:06.000
Vote for me, housing.

14:06.000 --> 14:09.360
The apolitical person won't actually care too much about the issues.

14:09.360 --> 14:12.000
They'll simply take whatever deal sounds good to them.

14:12.000 --> 14:15.840
And the apathy of the voter is a well-known major flaw of universal suffrage.

14:15.840 --> 14:17.920
It has been since long before I was born.

14:17.920 --> 14:23.120
And Michael Bloomberg's campaign represents that flaw taken to its logical extreme.

14:23.120 --> 14:25.920
He didn't even need to promise anything concrete.

14:25.920 --> 14:28.240
He just had to spend, spend, spend.

14:28.240 --> 14:31.520
Of course, what fixes this is not removing universal suffrage.

14:31.520 --> 14:34.400
It's encouraging a more engaged voting population.

14:34.400 --> 14:38.320
People who will actually think through the issues and consider what is the best course

14:38.320 --> 14:43.280
of action for the nation and not simply voting because this guy promised me free shit that I want.

14:43.280 --> 14:44.960
Anyway, Bloomberg's a joke.

14:44.960 --> 14:46.080
I'm glad he's gone.

14:46.080 --> 14:47.600
I'll see you next time.

14:47.600 --> 14:48.160
I love you.

15:17.600 --> 15:34.160
Thank you.
