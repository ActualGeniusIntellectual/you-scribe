0	3200	Michael Bloomberg gave us all a wild ride, didn't he?
3200	5120	I mean, he shows up out of nowhere.
5120	7360	He's not even on the ballots of the first few states,
7360	9200	or part of the first Democratic debates,
9200	13040	and yet for a short while there it was Bloomberg, Bloomberg, Bloomberg everywhere.
13040	17360	I guess he was banking on the fact that he and Trump are once at least somewhat close.
17360	20800	Though to be fair, back in the 90s and 2000s Trump had connections everywhere
20800	21920	because he wasn't a politician.
21920	25200	Those connections basically fell apart when he won 2016.
25200	28480	But Bloomberg is ultimately cut from the same cloth as Trump.
28480	31600	He's not nearly as charismatic, his debate performance proved that,
31600	35120	but he's a rich New York oligarch that wanted to get into politics.
35120	36640	It's pretty much the same story.
36640	38960	And I bet Bloomberg's thought process was,
38960	42560	well, if Trump did it with the Republicans, surely I can do it with the Democrats, right?
42560	43680	I mean, I've got more money.
44400	46640	Like, way more money.
46640	48720	Ridiculously more money, in fact.
48720	52960	I gotta say, it's very strange for the Democratic party to have even allowed this to happen at all.
52960	56720	I mean, their base right now, their rhetoric is anti-billionaire,
56720	59200	and yet here's somebody who's far richer than Trump.
59200	61520	And in fact, his supporters kept repeating that,
61520	63360	that Bloomberg was richer than Trump.
63360	65600	As if this was some kind of own.
65600	66240	I don't get it.
66240	70480	I thought you guys were against wealth inequality, not neener, neener, I'm richer than you.
70480	74320	Though at the same time, considering that socialists often believe that
74320	76640	the rich is just somebody richer than them,
76640	79920	well, if you keep shifting those goalposts to their logical conclusion,
79920	81760	I guess Bloomberg can be a leftist.
81760	85520	So Bloomberg burned through a whole ton of money to try to get himself elected.
85520	88160	Nearly $500 million, I think, by the end.
88160	89520	That's a lot of money.
89520	90480	But not for him.
90480	93360	That's less than 1% of what Bloomberg's currently worth.
93360	95840	And oh boy, were there ads for him everywhere.
95840	98320	TV ads, radio ads, internet ads.
98320	99760	If you were in a Super Tuesday state,
99760	102800	you couldn't walk outside without tripping over Bloomberg's head somewhere.
115520	128320	And yes, the rumors that he was paying off internet personalities to shill for him online,
128320	129520	that was true too.
129520	131680	YouTube, Instagram, TikTok, Twitter.
131680	133040	He put money into all of them.
133040	135200	How many of you stumbled across an account like this
135200	136960	while you were on social media recently?
136960	138640	Like Henry Ford Bloomberg.
138640	141520	This account will be solely for campaigning for Mike Bloomberg.
141520	144560	It's just some college student who needed money, I guess.
144560	146560	Hey kid, can you make me some memes?
146560	148560	Make me seem cool in the eyes of the other kids?
148560	150560	Post that shit on Twitter, that'll get me some votes.
150560	152400	Yeah, I'll pay for your college, don't worry about it.
152400	158320	Of course, as it turned out, the quality and accuracy of all of this stuff was dubious at best.
158320	161920	Mike Bloomberg's campaign has deleted a series of satirical tweets
161920	165600	where they invented quotes from Bernie Sanders about a host of dictators.
165600	168240	I guess they're banking on the fact that no one would be able to tell the truth
168240	170960	considering Bernie's actual quotes about some dictators.
170960	174000	But still, considering that those are probably $100,000 a tweet,
174000	175680	that's a pretty big loss to delete him.
175680	180160	However, he spent so much goddamn money and went up in the polls so much
180160	184000	that the DNC actually, by their own rules, had to take him seriously.
184000	187520	So when Mike Bloomberg asked for a delay to the next Democratic town hall,
188080	189520	CNN listened to him.
189520	191440	And yeah, did you guys watch that debate?
192000	193040	It was brutal.
193040	197840	Are you willing to release all of those women from those non-disclosure agreements
197840	200160	so we can hear their side of the story?
201120	205520	We have a very few non-disclosure agreements.
205520	206000	How many is that?
206000	207040	Let me finish.
207040	207760	How many is that?
207760	213840	None of them accuse me of doing anything other than maybe they didn't like the joke I told.
213840	218000	Fortunately, I make a lot of money and we do business all around the world
218000	219040	and we are preparing it.
219760	223120	The number of pages will probably be thousands of pages.
223120	224560	I can't go to TurboTax.
224560	228400	Mike found out the hard way that the one thing you can't really buy is charisma.
228400	232320	The official Team Bloomberg account on Twitter
232320	235840	decided to make a thread highlighting all the acts of vandalism
235840	238400	against the various campaign offices around the country.
238400	240480	And they kept ending each tweet with,
240480	242320	America deserves better.
242320	247360	Like the problem here is that these are inner-city locations that are plagued by poverty and crime.
247360	250240	And that this vandalism is happening by people breaking in
250240	252480	because they're trying to find stuff to sell, I guess?
252480	253040	I don't know.
253040	255040	You know, the narrative people push to desperation.
255040	257920	But really, this just looks like people don't like you, Mike.
258800	259920	I'm sorry, dude.
259920	263360	Probably the funniest one was the Bloomberg office in Flint.
263360	265360	That's some very polite graffiti there, isn't it?
265920	267360	They didn't spray paint the windows.
267360	270960	They just put up some paper and then spray painted on the paper.
270960	273760	Also, I do think it's probably worth pointing out that
273760	276880	Flint's landmark problem has been its lack of drinking water
276880	278800	for something like three or four years now.
278800	283840	It's a problem that the city of Flint estimates will take about $55 million to fix.
283840	287280	That is 10% of what Bloomberg wasted on this failed campaign.
287280	291120	I have a feeling that if he actually just foot the bill for fixing up Flint,
291120	294960	that would have gone a lot further than flooding ads everywhere that no one actually liked.
294960	298480	Oh, there's also the fact that Bloomberg, back in 2014,
298480	302080	backed Rick Snyder's campaign to the tune of $3 million.
302080	306000	Governor Snyder would go on to preside over the Flint water crisis
306000	311600	and mismanage it so badly that he bears personal significant legal responsibility for it.
311600	313440	You bet on the wrong horse, Mike.
313440	315200	What is it with all these wine moms?
315280	318800	Acting like the Democratic primary is a literal trial by combat or something.
318800	321520	I've never heard the crowd boo in any of these debates, not once.
321520	323760	Suddenly they're booing anyone who goes after Bloomberg.
323760	326240	Anyone who thinks this isn't sketchy has a baby brain.
326240	330080	It is absolutely up Bloomberg's alley to buy off crowds.
330080	331360	But get this take.
331360	332000	Good.
332000	334800	They must learn to leave Mike Bloomberg alone.
334800	336160	Yep, very good, Karen.
336160	337200	Thank you very much.
337200	339920	About 20 more tweets like that and your mortgage will be paid off.
340640	342720	And then there was this weird video.
342720	346480	We call on Senator Sanders to condemn the hateful speech from his supporters
346480	348400	and end the Trump-like rhetoric.
348400	350080	America deserves better.
350080	355120	Yeah, dude, even as this guy floods the internet using paid shills to spit out his nonsense,
355120	359360	he's also crying about mean tweets, I guess.
359360	362720	I will say, though, I do recognize a couple of shitlords in this video.
362720	366320	Congratulations to everyone who made it into Bloomberg's meme reel.
366320	370880	Also, Bloomberg believes that the astrological powers that be will hand him the win.
371520	372160	What the hell?
372720	376960	You fellow Aquarians, I just want you to know that we are thoughtful.
376960	379680	We are independent and even keel.
380240	385520	And it will not surprise you to know that our current president is not an Aquarian.
385520	386320	He's a Gemini.
387280	388880	I knew you wouldn't be surprised.
388880	390240	Rip that Gemini vote.
390960	392640	Wait, I'm a Gemini.
392640	395760	Of course, behind the stupidity, there are more serious problems.
395760	399600	Bloomberg definitely dug into Bernie for praising Fidel Castro.
399600	402000	But at least Bernie did that some time ago.
402000	405280	Bloomberg recently praised Chinese communism.
405280	408640	The former New York mayor signaled that he intends to run in the
408640	412240	unrepentant Stalinist lane of the Democratic primary.
412240	415920	Bloomberg argued that the Chinese Communist Party was ecologically friendly,
415920	419760	democratically accountable and invulnerable to the threat of revolution.
419760	424000	Bloomberg, the Communist Party wants to stay in power in China, and they listen to the public.
424000	427760	When the public says I can't breathe the air, Xi Jinping is not a dictator.
427760	430400	He has to satisfy his constituents or he's not going to survive.
430960	432000	He's not a dictator?
432720	434800	No, he has a constituency to answer to.
434800	435760	He doesn't have a vote.
435760	436800	He doesn't have democracy.
436800	438640	He's not held accountable by voters.
438640	442480	If his advisors gave him, is the check on him just a revolution?
442480	444080	You're not going to have a revolution.
444080	447120	No government survives without the will of the majority of its people.
447120	450800	I don't think Bloomberg understands how politics works.
451520	452800	There's also this.
452800	455760	64 different women have filed 40 lawsuits against
455760	458480	Michael Bloomberg for sexual harassment and discrimination.
458480	461520	In Bloomberg's 1997 autobiography,
461520	466320	staffers found themselves uncomfortably reading their billionaire founders' boasts
466320	469120	about keeping a girlfriend in every city and other
469120	471760	womanizing exploits as a Wall Street up and comer.
471760	473360	Here's a few fun quotes.
473360	475680	I like theater, dining and chasing women.
476240	478480	I really want to have Jennifer Lopez.
478480	479920	I mean, have dinner with her.
479920	484560	A top aide said Bloomberg frequently remarked nice tits upon seeing attractive women.
484560	487120	If women wanted to be appreciated for their brains,
487120	489760	they'd go to the library instead of to Bloomingdale's.
489760	492480	And of the computer terminal that made him a billionaire,
492480	494720	it will do everything, including give you head.
494720	497200	I guess that puts a lot of you girls out of business.
497200	500880	This is of the same caliber as Trump's grab him by the pussy comments, but
501680	504480	no one's really raising an uproar this time, are they?
504480	508080	I guess stuff like sexual assault or objectification is completely fine
508080	510960	to the establishment left as long as you have the right politics.
510960	514240	It seems to be the same thing regarding Bloomberg's record on race.
514240	516560	Here's the mayor who instituted stop and frisk.
516560	519600	And yet the Democratic Party is just welcoming him with open arms.
519600	521520	Oh, no, wait, here's their defense.
521520	525760	Democrats are condemning Bloomberg because 64 women have accused him of speaking nasty.
525760	527920	Bloomberg employs 20,000 people.
528560	531840	64 people is 0.003 percent.
532400	535200	Instead of praising the man for creating 20,000 jobs,
535200	538800	let's berate him because 0.003 percent complained.
538800	540800	With that attitude, we will reelect Trump.
540800	542640	Not only is this an incredible reach,
542640	546480	but it is probably the worst case of Trump derangement syndrome I've ever seen.
546480	548000	Trump is not Satan.
548000	550880	It is certainly possible that there could be people running
550880	553680	within the Democratic Party that are worse than Trump.
554240	555760	And Bloomberg's probably one of them.
555760	556400	Sorry.
556400	561040	Well, all this time, all this money spent flooding ads everywhere,
561040	565440	hiring people on social media, doing whatever it is that you can to buy an election.
565440	567600	Where did it get Mike Bloomberg in the end?
567600	572400	What has the past three months and 500 million dollars really culminated in?
573040	574320	Womp, womp.
574880	578320	Michael Bloomberg ends U.S. presidential campaign.
578320	580880	He decided to endorse Biden, by the way.
580880	582160	What the hell was the point of that?
582720	585760	Mike, you could have literally just endorsed Biden.
585760	590720	You didn't need to run around for three months and blow all this money on literally nothing.
590720	593600	Everyone knew you weren't going to go anywhere with this, man.
593600	595920	Like, were you being taken on a ride by somebody?
595920	596640	I don't get it.
596640	600000	Did you have to launder 500 million really quick for some reason?
600000	603120	The most interesting thing about the rise and fall of Mike Bloomberg
603120	606320	is that it did actually expose how easy it would be
606320	608960	for a billionaire oligarch to buy an election.
608960	610560	Mike only spent 500 million.
610560	614560	What if he decided to actually spend like 5 billion or something
614560	617600	and start six months earlier so he was actually ready to go?
617600	618400	Who knows?
618400	621360	In that case, we might actually see a Bloomberg nomination.
621360	623520	He threw so much money at the process
623520	626880	that all of his flaws didn't matter, at least until he had to debate.
626880	629520	In my opinion, the debate is what fundamentally killed him.
629600	631680	And you know, with all that money, Bloomberg,
631680	634400	you probably could have spent a little bit on debating lessons, come on.
634400	635680	But what do we do next time?
635680	637040	What do we do in 2024?
637040	640960	What do we do when some rich jerk who's not actually interested in being a public servant
640960	645440	decides to dump an entire fortune on an election and simply win it like that?
645440	650400	I mean, we've been complaining now for over a decade about the danger of super PACs
650400	654240	on how elites can funnel near unlimited amounts of money into campaigns.
654240	655760	But Bloomberg bypassed all that.
655760	657440	He just ran himself.
657440	659440	Of course, there is the alternative angle.
660240	664320	People are screeching bloody murder at the fact that Bloomberg tried to buy an election.
664320	667040	And fair enough, there's a lot wrong with that.
667040	671040	But a lot of the Democratic establishment right now, they're doing the same thing.
671040	672880	They're just not spending their own money.
672880	675520	When a candidate promises the electorate free stuff,
675520	680560	it can be health care, it can be schooling, student loans, housing, food, you name it,
680560	682320	that stuff still has to be paid for.
682320	687120	It still has to be produced by somebody and they have to be compensated for their labor.
687120	690960	So while Bloomberg's attempt to buy an election is unconscionable,
690960	695520	there's also a very strong argument that any candidate running on a platform of
695520	698640	we will take stuff away from the rich, stuff that they earned,
698640	702160	and by the way that you won't take away because they're just going to go to a different country,
702160	705280	but we'll take it away from them and we'll give it to the rest of you.
705280	707680	That's still fundamentally buying an election.
707680	710400	It's just that the candidate's not using their own money to buy it.
710400	714800	They're writing a giant IOU, one that will probably end up being worthless in the long run.
714800	716960	Every system of government has its flaws.
716960	719280	Democracy too, even though I think it's the best one.
719280	722240	At one point, only landowners were allowed to vote.
722240	724320	The claim nowadays is that that was racist.
724320	727760	It meant that poor people or disenfranchised people could never actually have a say
727760	730560	in the workings of the government and their voice needs to be heard.
730560	732560	And fair enough, I agree with that assessment.
732560	737760	But the logic behind only landowners having a vote was because back at that time period,
737760	741760	landowners had a disproportionate amount to lose from government policy.
741760	745520	People who didn't own land back then, they wouldn't have to worry about, for example,
745520	747520	what happens to their property during a war.
747520	749920	What happens if it's reappropriated by the state?
749920	752960	A simplistic example of this fear would be something like,
752960	755440	okay, you have a guy who owns a parcel of land,
755440	758960	and then suddenly 50 squatters show up and want to squat on that land.
758960	762480	And because everyone can vote, the local county has an election,
762480	765520	all the squatters vote for the candidate that will allow them to squat on the land,
765520	767360	and suddenly the guy's property rights don't matter.
767360	769760	It's a far-fetched example, but it's what they were trying to prevent.
769760	772880	Later in history, it was decided that only men could vote and not women.
772880	775680	Again, the argument against this was that it was fundamentally sexist,
775680	778480	that women should have a say in how the nations run because they live in it,
778480	779360	they're citizens of it.
779360	781040	And I also fundamentally agree.
781040	783360	But I also understand the other side of the argument.
783360	787440	If only men are getting drafted, if only men have to go to war,
787440	790480	why should women have a vote in whether or not the nation goes to war?
791120	793120	It's not them putting their lives on the line.
793120	797040	In that way, the right to vote was tied to the obligation to serve in the military.
797040	798960	But now we have a completely different problem.
798960	802400	And no, I'm not advocating for removing the right to vote from everyone,
802400	804400	I'm simply describing the problem that we have.
804400	808240	We are in a situation where a sizable amount of the population is completely apolitical.
808240	809360	They just don't care.
809360	813360	They don't care what the left, the right, Republicans, Democrats, it doesn't matter.
813360	817280	The best way to get those people to vote is to promise them something for nothing.
817280	821520	It's to promise them a sale, a good deal, a buy one, get one free.
821520	825360	The same thing that a lot of local stores do when they hand out flyers or announce
825360	826880	or announce deals or something.
826880	828720	They say, hey, you come, you shop here.
828720	830400	Well, we got all this stuff on sale.
830400	833280	Here's all the reasons you should shop with us rather than our competitor.
833280	837200	Because we have a large mass of people that are politically disengaged,
837200	839760	that is fundamentally what politics has turned into.
839760	841760	Vote for me, I'll give you an Obama phone.
841760	843600	Vote for me, there's free health care.
843600	844800	Vote for me, schooling.
844800	846000	Vote for me, housing.
846000	849360	The apolitical person won't actually care too much about the issues.
849360	852000	They'll simply take whatever deal sounds good to them.
852000	855840	And the apathy of the voter is a well-known major flaw of universal suffrage.
855840	857920	It has been since long before I was born.
857920	863120	And Michael Bloomberg's campaign represents that flaw taken to its logical extreme.
863120	865920	He didn't even need to promise anything concrete.
865920	868240	He just had to spend, spend, spend.
868240	871520	Of course, what fixes this is not removing universal suffrage.
871520	874400	It's encouraging a more engaged voting population.
874400	878320	People who will actually think through the issues and consider what is the best course
878320	883280	of action for the nation and not simply voting because this guy promised me free shit that I want.
883280	884960	Anyway, Bloomberg's a joke.
884960	886080	I'm glad he's gone.
886080	887600	I'll see you next time.
887600	888160	I love you.
917600	934160	Thank you.
