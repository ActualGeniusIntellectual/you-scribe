00:00.000 --> 00:08.200
Good morning gamers!

00:08.200 --> 00:11.520
Yes it's true, I've been gone for a little bit, and yes it's true, I'm back!

00:11.520 --> 00:15.640
I have been working on some rather large projects that I hope one day will in fact see the light

00:15.640 --> 00:16.640
of day.

00:16.640 --> 00:19.120
For those of you who actually watch my streams, you know what I'm talking about, because

00:19.120 --> 00:21.960
I've described them in a bit more detail over there, and if you haven't, what's

00:21.960 --> 00:22.960
wrong with you?

00:22.960 --> 00:25.560
I'll talk a bit more about them tonight on stream again, in case you wanted to ask

00:25.560 --> 00:28.040
some questions or hear about it or whatever.

00:28.040 --> 00:34.120
But today we are talking about champagne socialists, bougie communists, the people

00:34.120 --> 00:38.560
who say eat the rich even though they are the rich that will inevitably be eaten.

00:38.560 --> 00:42.680
Now of course in one of my more recent videos, we talked about Black Lives Matter leader

00:42.680 --> 00:48.760
Patrisse Khan Cullors, and how despite her Marxism, her equality above all rhetoric,

00:48.760 --> 00:52.860
she's raking in the cash and buying four separate homes.

00:52.860 --> 00:54.940
Well, let's listen to her talk about it.

01:22.860 --> 01:28.980
Sure, and I think that is a critique that is wanting.

01:28.980 --> 01:37.420
And I say that because the way that I live my life is in direct support to Black people,

01:37.420 --> 01:41.260
including my Black family members, first and foremost.

01:41.260 --> 01:49.060
And for so many Black folks who are able to invest in themselves and their community,

01:49.060 --> 01:52.940
they choose to invest in their family, and that's what I've chosen to do.

01:52.940 --> 01:58.060
I have a child, I have a brother that has severe mental illness that I take care of,

01:58.060 --> 02:02.820
I support my mother, and I support many other family members of mine.

02:02.820 --> 02:11.620
And so I see my money as not my own, I see it as my family's money as well.

02:11.620 --> 02:12.960
Pretty incredible, eh?

02:12.960 --> 02:19.040
Is that all it takes to make this massive wealth accumulation acceptable within a Marxist

02:19.040 --> 02:20.040
lens?

02:20.040 --> 02:25.800
So every billionaire, every dirty, rotten capitalist who is raking in the dough hand

02:25.800 --> 02:31.080
over fist, if they're doing it for their families, if they're taking care of their families,

02:31.080 --> 02:32.200
it's okay.

02:32.200 --> 02:33.280
Is that what I'm hearing here?

02:33.280 --> 02:37.880
Or maybe it's because her family is Black, and therefore she can say that by taking care

02:37.880 --> 02:40.960
of her family, she is taking care of Black people.

02:40.960 --> 02:44.640
If you're looking at it through a race lens, I guess that makes sense, but it's still pretty

02:44.640 --> 02:45.700
disgusting, eh?

02:45.700 --> 02:50.620
Of course the actual truth is, it does not betray Marxist principles in practice because

02:50.620 --> 02:55.980
it is exactly what every single Marxist leader has ever done throughout the entire history

02:55.980 --> 02:57.340
of Marxism.

02:57.340 --> 03:01.380
And yes, there will be idiots on the left who will look at this and say, this isn't

03:01.380 --> 03:06.340
a leftist problem, this is a liberal problem, she's a rad lib, intersectionality and identity

03:06.340 --> 03:08.180
politics, that's rad lib shit.

03:08.180 --> 03:10.620
Yeah, I'm not convinced of that.

03:10.620 --> 03:15.580
I was at the publications table today, and I was speaking to this young person from Arizona

03:15.580 --> 03:23.700
who's trying to fight SB 1070, and he grabbed a book, and he said, it's like Mal's red book.

03:23.700 --> 03:28.500
And I was like, man, that's what I was thinking, and it was just really cool to hear him make

03:28.500 --> 03:29.500
that connection.

03:29.500 --> 03:35.420
And I was like, how about you buy 10 to 15 of these books, and you all have a youth organizing

03:35.420 --> 03:39.760
group where you talk about it, and you really try to engage this, and we can just kind of,

03:39.760 --> 03:42.880
we need to build off of this.

03:42.880 --> 03:47.840
No liberal would ever compare their writing to Mao's little red book.

03:47.840 --> 03:50.880
That is the rhetoric of a socialist revolutionary.

03:50.880 --> 03:56.120
Moreover, I like how she just says, yeah, just, you know, buy 10, 15 of those books,

03:56.120 --> 03:59.640
why don't you pay for my houses, poor people?

03:59.640 --> 04:00.640
Here's what I mean, though.

04:00.640 --> 04:01.920
Look at this person's bio.

04:01.920 --> 04:08.800
Yeah, it's cancerous, but this is what a leftist would say is a liberal bio, is a rad lib bio.

04:08.800 --> 04:11.720
Nothing in here talks about class conflict or class struggle.

04:11.720 --> 04:17.200
Nothing in here talks about Marxism or socialism or communism, it is all idpol.

04:17.200 --> 04:22.520
And yet, hot take, the rural white America that left-wing people flirt so much with loving

04:22.520 --> 04:24.420
is a bunch of landlords.

04:24.420 --> 04:30.000
They are far, far more repulsive than the professional managerial class that is so hated,

04:30.000 --> 04:33.600
and the fact that they are not identified as class enemies is a failure.

04:33.600 --> 04:38.480
Like you want to invoke Mao, liquidate white farmers and hand their land over to the Latin

04:38.480 --> 04:42.760
next farm workers and convert it back to native land directly.

04:42.760 --> 04:44.260
These are not liberal positions.

04:44.260 --> 04:49.100
In fact, as contradictory as it might sound on the face of it, these are bourgeois socialist

04:49.100 --> 04:50.160
opinions.

04:50.160 --> 04:55.240
This is literally kill the kulaks rhetoric, kill the poor who refuse to revolt with us.

04:55.240 --> 04:56.240
Remember new guy?

04:56.240 --> 05:01.680
Well, here's Mallory Jessica Yoshida's person who drew that comic and who still a year and

05:01.680 --> 05:03.740
a half later has not gotten over it.

05:03.740 --> 05:07.800
She has no empathy for the wealthy and wants to steal from the rich.

05:08.120 --> 05:10.760
You gotta pay quite a bit to live in Seattle, but fine.

05:10.760 --> 05:14.480
Howdy, I'm the weird and dorky cartoonist behind Nightmare Girls.

05:14.480 --> 05:15.560
Money please!

05:15.560 --> 05:18.280
It is great when they just get straight to the point, isn't it?

05:18.280 --> 05:20.040
Give me what you have.

05:20.040 --> 05:21.040
That's all it is.

05:21.040 --> 05:26.840
Beneath, you know what, I think beneath most socialist activism is just egoism in the end.

05:26.840 --> 05:32.920
When supplies of drugs run low, drug prices mysteriously rise, data shows.

05:32.920 --> 05:36.560
And the less competition, the higher the price hikes.

05:36.560 --> 05:40.380
This can't be a real article, I mean I know it's on Ars Technica, but you have to be

05:40.380 --> 05:44.420
ignorant of all economics to be surprised at this, right?

05:44.420 --> 05:52.560
When nearly 100 drugs became scarce between 2015 and 2016, their prices mysteriously increased

05:52.560 --> 05:55.780
more than twice as fast as their expected rate.

05:55.780 --> 06:00.260
An analysis recently published reveals the price hikes were highest if the pharmaceutical

06:00.260 --> 06:04.000
companies behind the drugs had little competition.

06:04.000 --> 06:04.500
Are-

06:09.500 --> 06:11.240
Literally Econ 101.

06:11.240 --> 06:14.060
Wha- how is this happening?

06:14.060 --> 06:16.600
No one's competing with these guys?

06:16.600 --> 06:17.600
Supplies running out?

06:17.600 --> 06:18.640
Why are the prices going up?

06:18.640 --> 06:20.520
This happened here in Canada last summer.

06:20.520 --> 06:25.200
The vandalism of a Nazi monument in Ontario is being investigated as a hate crime.

06:25.200 --> 06:28.080
Oh jeez, we have Nazi monuments here apparently.

06:28.080 --> 06:32.200
A monument in Oakville Ontario commemorating those who served under Adolf Hitler in the

06:32.200 --> 06:36.640
14th SS division was recently graffitied with the words Nazi war monument.

06:36.640 --> 06:40.400
The incident which police say appeared to target an identifiable group is being investigated

06:40.400 --> 06:42.320
as a hate-motivated crime.

06:42.320 --> 06:47.760
I guess if the legal definition of hate-motivated crime is targeting an identifiable group,

06:47.760 --> 06:50.440
SS officers is an identifiable group.

06:50.440 --> 06:52.480
But here's the actual situation.

06:52.480 --> 06:57.480
Someone painted Nazi war monument on a stone cenotaph located in Oakville in the Saint

06:57.480 --> 06:59.960
Volodymyr Ukrainian cemetery.

06:59.960 --> 07:05.300
Oakville has a large population of Ukrainian immigrants and refugees, and the 14th SS division

07:05.300 --> 07:08.360
was made up of Ukrainians who pledged allegiance to Hitler.

07:08.360 --> 07:11.560
Some members of the division have been accused of killing Polish women and children as well

07:11.560 --> 07:13.680
as Jews during the second world war.

07:13.680 --> 07:14.840
So fair enough.

07:14.840 --> 07:18.920
Countries like Ukraine and Poland and others, who have historically found themselves between

07:18.920 --> 07:22.760
a rock and a hard place, with the Russians and the Germans on either side, probably did

07:22.760 --> 07:24.960
have some people who ended up doing this stuff.

07:24.960 --> 07:28.560
And you know, even though this is part of some Ukrainian cultural heritage, maybe we

07:28.560 --> 07:30.760
shouldn't be doing this sort of stuff in Canada, eh?

07:30.760 --> 07:35.160
Of course it might be the case that the reason that the 14th SS division is memorialized

07:35.160 --> 07:40.360
in places like Canada is not because they were actually the 14th SS division.

07:40.360 --> 07:41.940
They were at one point.

07:41.940 --> 07:46.180
The actual history of the division is that it was one of the only divisions that was

07:46.180 --> 07:51.080
not found guilty of any wrongdoing during the second world war at the Nuremberg trials.

07:51.080 --> 07:56.640
Additionally, a lot of the individuals involved were forced into service, and as the Nazis

07:56.640 --> 08:01.520
began to lose the war, large parts of the unit started working for the Ukrainian Insurgent

08:01.520 --> 08:06.440
Army, which was a paramilitary organization that fought during World War II against the

08:06.440 --> 08:09.720
Soviet Union, Communist Poland, as well as Nazi Germany.

08:09.720 --> 08:15.860
And in the wars last year, the entire 14th SS division abandoned Germany and became the

08:15.860 --> 08:18.060
first Ukrainian division.

08:18.060 --> 08:22.200
In other words, it's not as simple as saying that these people were Nazis and that was

08:22.200 --> 08:23.200
that.

08:23.200 --> 08:26.520
A large number of veterans from this division did in fact move to Canada and end up in Oakville,

08:26.520 --> 08:28.680
but they were all vetted by the Canadian government.

08:28.680 --> 08:31.280
And as best as we can tell, they seem to be innocent.

08:31.280 --> 08:36.400
Of course, if you're a brain dead bougie communist, you're just going to spray paint Nazi war

08:36.400 --> 08:38.120
monument and leave it at that.

08:38.120 --> 08:42.880
In much the same way, when Canada began building a memorial to the victims of communism, of

08:42.880 --> 08:46.340
course these same people will spray paint on it, communism will win.

08:46.340 --> 08:50.720
The best part about this is that it's not even denying the victims of communism.

08:50.720 --> 08:54.860
It's not denying the fact that they were victims, that they got liquidated, that they were put

08:54.860 --> 08:56.800
in camps and mass and killed.

08:56.800 --> 09:00.260
It's simply saying, yeah, no, communism is going to win anyway.

09:00.260 --> 09:02.820
We will kill all these people and it's not going to be a problem because we're going

09:02.820 --> 09:03.820
to win.

09:03.820 --> 09:04.820
Like, holy shit.

09:04.820 --> 09:05.820
It's one thing to deny atrocities.

09:05.820 --> 09:08.380
It's another thing entirely to say those atrocities were good.

09:08.380 --> 09:11.940
And you can find this image anywhere, but this particular one that I'm looking at is

09:11.940 --> 09:18.420
on r slash America's Socialists, a pro socialist subreddit.

09:18.420 --> 09:21.100
And check out some of the comments under this image.

09:21.100 --> 09:22.220
You people are absolute scum.

09:22.220 --> 09:25.340
I have a few Romanian construction worker friends that would love to enlighten you about

09:25.340 --> 09:29.560
life under communism, a naive consumer of heartbreaking stories.

09:29.560 --> 09:33.700
They're all innocent victims of communism, but if you check most of their stories, the

09:33.700 --> 09:35.340
reality is quite different.

09:35.340 --> 09:40.740
I personally checked more than one such story and all of these innocent victims can either

09:40.740 --> 09:43.620
be murderers or Nazi collaborators.

09:43.620 --> 09:47.200
Canada sheltered thousands of Nazi criminals after world war II.

09:47.200 --> 09:52.200
The descendants of these scum built such memorials with impunity and invent millions of victims

09:52.200 --> 09:53.320
of communism.

09:53.320 --> 09:56.200
I like how you can't be a liberal and oppose communism.

09:56.200 --> 09:58.480
If you oppose communism, you have to be a fascist.

09:58.480 --> 10:05.360
These people do not understand why normal, everyday, nonpolitical, unaligned people oppose

10:05.360 --> 10:06.360
them.

10:06.360 --> 10:07.360
And I'm sure you guys remember this too.

10:07.360 --> 10:12.520
A same energy where a us cadet who wore a Che Guevara t-shirt underneath his uniform

10:12.520 --> 10:16.720
and had communism will win in his hat got completely expelled.

10:16.720 --> 10:19.720
I think he, I think he first ruined his life after doing a quick search.

10:19.720 --> 10:24.920
This image took place in a back in 2018, he hasn't really done anything since.

10:24.920 --> 10:28.640
He just retweets a bunch of lefties on Twitter, but he isn't, he doesn't seem to be doing

10:28.640 --> 10:31.000
anything in any political space.

10:31.000 --> 10:32.000
Good job, dude.

10:32.000 --> 10:33.000
You did it.

10:33.000 --> 10:34.000
You beat capitalism.

10:34.000 --> 10:36.880
But of course the best takes come from a tanky collective.

10:36.880 --> 10:41.340
DM this guy, any cursed tanky takes you might find here, I'll give you a lightning round

10:41.340 --> 10:42.760
of these ridiculous takes.

10:42.760 --> 10:46.800
What the hell kind of socialist rejects and demonizes Stalin.

10:46.800 --> 10:50.840
Imagine playing teacher's pet to the bourgeoisie, lapping up their propaganda and slander against

10:50.840 --> 10:53.440
one of the greatest revolutionary thinkers and leaders of all time.

10:53.440 --> 10:55.120
Oh, I'm one of the good socialists.

10:55.120 --> 10:56.740
I hate Stalin.

10:56.740 --> 10:58.840
Imagine standing for Hitler.

10:58.840 --> 11:01.080
That is the level that we're talking about here.

11:01.080 --> 11:05.780
The US is more authoritarian than China ever will be.

11:05.780 --> 11:07.400
Fucking incredible, dude.

11:07.400 --> 11:08.720
Are we exterminating the Uyghurs?

11:08.720 --> 11:10.660
Do we have a social credit system?

11:10.660 --> 11:15.920
And speaking of the Uyghurs, it's better to be Uyghurs because Uyghurs don't, Uyghurs

11:15.920 --> 11:20.400
doesn't suffer any repression unlike our Palestinian comrades.

11:20.400 --> 11:21.400
That's how it is, eh?

11:21.400 --> 11:25.520
You just define oppression as something that only non-socialist countries can do.

11:25.520 --> 11:31.000
There's a fellow on Twitter named Besfort, reactionary, so you're just a filthy communist?

11:31.000 --> 11:32.760
Me, yes, thank you very much.

11:32.760 --> 11:36.920
Turns out Besfort is the founder and CEO of a company.

11:36.920 --> 11:40.200
You're not much of a communist, are you?

11:40.200 --> 11:42.120
Hammer and sickle and name.

11:42.120 --> 11:45.880
In that case, fascism is based.

11:45.880 --> 11:46.880
What is?

11:46.880 --> 11:47.880
What?

11:47.880 --> 11:52.640
Oh, he's referring to red fascists, otherwise known as the Soviets.

11:52.640 --> 11:56.640
It was the Kuomintang who did little to defeat the Japanese.

11:56.640 --> 11:59.380
They chose to fight the communists who were fighting the Japanese.

11:59.380 --> 12:01.400
As a result, the communists became more popular.

12:01.400 --> 12:04.880
They won the war in China and I'm using their flag, you fucking Maoist.

12:04.880 --> 12:10.940
So the Kuomintang ended up becoming the Taiwan liberal government and before World War II,

12:10.940 --> 12:14.360
the nationalists were fighting the communists in a civil war in China.

12:14.360 --> 12:18.480
They basically set aside their civil war when the Japanese invaded and then resumed

12:18.480 --> 12:20.600
it after World War II was over.

12:20.600 --> 12:24.880
It's true that the Chinese nationalists viewed the communists as the worst threat compared

12:24.880 --> 12:25.880
to the Japanese.

12:25.880 --> 12:26.880
And guess what?

12:26.880 --> 12:27.880
They were right.

12:27.880 --> 12:31.480
And yes, they do think that red fascism is good.

12:31.480 --> 12:35.800
Wow, I don't even know how to present this to you.

12:35.800 --> 12:37.380
There's no jokes that can be made.

12:37.380 --> 12:39.720
There's no like lightheartedness here.

12:39.720 --> 12:42.200
It's just, they're just open about it.

12:42.200 --> 12:48.120
And dude, I already dealt with time traveling famines and forest massacres.

12:48.120 --> 12:51.920
Now I got to deal with time traveling forged documents.

12:51.920 --> 12:55.800
There's a lot of Nazisploitation fiction that has time traveling in it, right?

12:55.800 --> 13:00.720
Along with vampires and werewolves and robots and hidden moon bases and shit.

13:00.720 --> 13:05.000
People in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, otherwise known as North Korea,

13:05.000 --> 13:09.560
have a better standard of living than many in the US and other Western nations.

13:09.560 --> 13:12.200
Stop repeating imperialist bullshit.

13:12.200 --> 13:17.400
If you were living in North Korea, you would not even have the crab in your avatar to eat.

13:17.400 --> 13:19.480
Get the difference yet, Vosch?

13:19.480 --> 13:22.320
Nazis started the Holocaust and communists ended the Holocaust.

13:22.320 --> 13:27.460
I can't believe I have to come to Vosch's defense here because he is at least nominally

13:27.460 --> 13:28.460
anti-tanky.

13:28.460 --> 13:33.680
But yeah, I'm not going to be pro Nazi collaborator or pro Gulag, thank you very much.

13:33.680 --> 13:41.800
Plus this guy here, this guy that he used as the Nazi image, he ended up being an embarrassment

13:41.800 --> 13:47.000
to the Nazi party because he was considered to be the exemplar of the Aryan race.

13:47.000 --> 13:50.880
And yet he was like one quarter or one eighth Jewish, it turned out later.

13:50.880 --> 13:56.360
Rural voters are incredibly stupid, incredibly racist, incredibly evangelical, or incredibly

13:56.360 --> 13:57.640
fascist.

13:57.640 --> 13:58.820
Often all four.

13:58.820 --> 14:04.860
This is literally just socialist moves to the city to pay $5,000 for a one room apartment

14:04.860 --> 14:05.860
and hates his hometown.

14:05.860 --> 14:11.000
And here's the reply he got, no poverty stricken underfunded areas aren't as educated or up

14:11.000 --> 14:13.020
to moral code as I think they should be.

14:13.020 --> 14:14.020
Let's leave them to suffer.

14:14.020 --> 14:18.660
And he said, if it were up to me, their suffering would not be the result of indifference, but

14:18.660 --> 14:21.020
direct action.

14:21.020 --> 14:23.340
Socialists hate the poor.

14:23.340 --> 14:26.300
Nazi death camps are bad and Soviet gulags are good.

14:26.300 --> 14:29.740
Fuck, do we need to go any further?

14:29.740 --> 14:33.660
I was hoping this video would be kind of funny, maybe we can have some laughs, make some jokes.

14:33.660 --> 14:38.460
We've had a couple jokes so far, but I'm just stunned.

14:38.460 --> 14:43.260
I'm stunned at leftist communists and the shit that they say.

14:43.260 --> 14:47.600
Your reminder, today is delete Facebook day because Zuckerberg will favor Donald Trump's

14:47.600 --> 14:50.320
freedom of speech over democracy.

14:50.320 --> 14:51.320
He's out of office.

14:51.320 --> 14:52.860
He's been out of office for six months.

14:52.860 --> 14:56.540
Is this going to be like rent free and leftist heads for a while?

14:56.540 --> 15:01.020
Is Donald Trump going to be the political equivalent of that one girl that got away?

15:01.020 --> 15:06.360
So your family suffered under quote unquote communism.

15:06.360 --> 15:07.980
Why should I care?

15:07.980 --> 15:08.980
Look at this smug motherfucker.

15:08.980 --> 15:10.220
Do you even need to play the video?

15:10.220 --> 15:11.220
Look at this guy.

15:11.220 --> 15:14.420
Yeah, I don't care if my politics killed your family members.

15:14.420 --> 15:15.420
What's that?

15:15.420 --> 15:20.100
Is that the sound of me losing the whole ass moral high ground when it comes to slavery?

15:20.100 --> 15:25.420
How could you have lived through 2020 and not become a communist based fucking Tina

15:25.420 --> 15:26.420
here?

15:26.420 --> 15:27.660
I've been following her on Twitter for a while.

15:27.660 --> 15:34.420
She's great because my morgue only has a capacity of 2,500 bodies, but COVID yeah, we never

15:34.420 --> 15:35.700
reach capacity.

15:35.700 --> 15:39.000
It's always incredible when people working in healthcare, working in science come out

15:39.000 --> 15:43.660
and completely debunk everything regarding the mainstream media narrative victims of

15:43.660 --> 15:49.040
communism Memorial foundation adds a global coronavirus deaths to its tally of historical

15:49.040 --> 15:54.440
victims of communism.

15:54.440 --> 15:58.480
The victims of communism Memorial foundation is officially recognizing global coronavirus

15:58.480 --> 16:02.240
deaths as the fault of the Chinese government and adding them to its tally of historical

16:02.240 --> 16:06.160
victims of communism, the organization announced on Friday.

16:06.160 --> 16:12.020
You know, if commies are going to do this really stupid song and dance of blaming like

16:12.020 --> 16:18.880
people who die of starvation on say capitalism, which is dumb for a thousand fucking reasons,

16:18.880 --> 16:22.780
but if they're going to do that, then he, I guess this makes sense.

16:22.780 --> 16:25.120
Let's watch the advancement of a character arc.

16:25.120 --> 16:26.120
Okay.

16:26.120 --> 16:32.920
From DSA racist, I actually, I actually kind of know this guy.

16:32.920 --> 16:36.800
He has been hating on me on and off for fucking years.

16:36.800 --> 16:41.720
Vash is one of the most badly read, terribly spoken, incoherent bread tubers out there.

16:41.720 --> 16:45.400
I wouldn't trust the leftism of a single one of his followers.

16:45.400 --> 16:46.400
I mean, fair enough.

16:46.400 --> 16:47.840
He that that's true.

16:47.840 --> 16:51.640
But we're now into real leftist versus rad lib territory.

16:51.640 --> 16:57.480
And our friend e-boy neat is taking up the position that the bread tubers are rad libs

16:57.480 --> 16:58.760
actually in he's.

16:58.760 --> 16:59.920
He is the real leftist.

16:59.920 --> 17:00.920
Okay.

17:00.920 --> 17:02.080
Well let's see what this real leftism is.

17:02.080 --> 17:07.500
The Uyghur genocide is a CIA manufactured myth pushed by the national endowment for

17:07.500 --> 17:11.120
democracy, which is a us state department slush fund.

17:11.120 --> 17:17.040
I swear to God, you know how like the right wing has, has the Q Anon cultists who are

17:17.040 --> 17:19.800
really believing some wild ass out there shit.

17:19.800 --> 17:25.180
I have a feeling the CIA is that same kind of thing to, to the radical leftists who are

17:25.180 --> 17:27.780
believing wild ass out there shit.

17:27.780 --> 17:35.480
Not only was there no cultural genocide, Tiananmen square was a CIA operation too.

17:35.480 --> 17:36.480
Fuck it.

17:36.480 --> 17:37.480
I'm done with theatrics.

17:37.480 --> 17:38.480
You know what?

17:38.480 --> 17:44.260
Genocide good.

17:44.260 --> 17:47.660
Real leftism is when genocide good.

17:47.660 --> 17:48.660
Holy fuck.

17:48.660 --> 17:49.660
Oh yeah.

17:49.660 --> 17:53.100
This is the thing that I mentioned on Adam and such as show a couple of days ago.

17:53.100 --> 17:54.380
It turns out it wasn't a Twitter post.

17:54.380 --> 17:58.740
It was actually a Reddit post, but somebody posted on, um, on Contra points as subreddit

17:58.740 --> 17:59.740
is Contra.

17:59.740 --> 18:00.740
Okay.

18:00.740 --> 18:04.920
And then the, uh, the post is removed, but it has to do with how Contra has been looking

18:04.920 --> 18:06.660
on camera recently.

18:06.660 --> 18:09.700
Those of you who don't know she has a drug problem and some of the things going on and

18:09.700 --> 18:12.740
Contra says, that's my hair growing back in.

18:12.740 --> 18:17.100
I guess 4chan wouldn't know about that cause they can't afford that all.

18:17.100 --> 18:23.060
What she's referring here to here specifically is how there is a 4chan board for trans people,

18:23.060 --> 18:27.500
which is, it can be a little bit insular and a little bit out there to be honest, but a

18:27.500 --> 18:31.620
lot of the trans people that are quite poor and can't afford a lot of the various surgeries

18:31.620 --> 18:34.420
and um, and things that are involved in transitioning.

18:34.420 --> 18:41.140
And so here is a Contra points making fun of poor 4chan trannies who can't afford to

18:41.140 --> 18:43.220
do the things that they want to do.

18:43.220 --> 18:44.940
Fuck me, dude.

18:44.940 --> 18:48.660
Like I've been called a transphobic before.

18:48.660 --> 18:49.980
I don't think I am.

18:49.980 --> 18:54.200
There are certainly things that I don't understand about the whole, the whole trans situation,

18:54.200 --> 18:57.020
but I try my best to at least learn about them.

18:57.020 --> 19:01.380
Um, and I'm also as polite as I can be whenever possible because there's no reason not to

19:01.380 --> 19:02.920
be right.

19:02.920 --> 19:07.700
But fuck, I wouldn't make fun of somebody because they can't afford to transition.

19:07.700 --> 19:09.220
Like what, what the fuck?

19:09.220 --> 19:14.180
When people, people call Contra points a rad lib, like she's not a true leftist.

19:14.180 --> 19:18.340
It seems like whenever we find like a person who's like, no, I'm a real leftist, I'm actually

19:18.340 --> 19:20.660
a socialist, I'm not a rad lib.

19:20.660 --> 19:24.720
And then they say like one ridiculous thing and then suddenly they're cast out as a rad

19:24.720 --> 19:28.300
lib, but that's everybody, that's everybody in the movement.

19:28.300 --> 19:34.600
They're all that the U S is worse than Nazi Germany.

19:34.600 --> 19:38.640
So if it were world war II right now in the U S we're fighting against Nazi Germany and

19:38.640 --> 19:42.240
Imperial Japan, you would support the latter too?

19:42.240 --> 19:46.720
Says the person with the hammer and sickle in their name again, because I said, because

19:46.720 --> 19:51.360
I oppose the U S I would be supporting those becoming fascist to own the libs.

19:51.360 --> 19:55.800
I swear to God, it turns out that like socialists, at least the ones that are more honest about

19:55.800 --> 20:00.360
the ideology understand that a socialist society is not the goal of socialism.

20:00.360 --> 20:02.000
It's the destruction of liberalism.

20:02.000 --> 20:03.000
That's it.

20:03.000 --> 20:08.120
Socialism itself is just straight up unachievable, but it is the tool that they will use to dismantle

20:08.120 --> 20:11.220
the liberal state and then bring in their totalitarianism.

20:11.220 --> 20:14.200
I'm so fucking tired of the anti-tanky left.

20:14.200 --> 20:17.200
They just pissed me the fuck off and annoy me to no end.

20:17.200 --> 20:20.880
How dare you be against the worst societies in the history of the planet?

20:20.880 --> 20:24.060
The Katyn massacre was literal Nazi war propaganda.

20:24.060 --> 20:29.120
The Nazis revealed it an investigation by Poland and the USSR slash Russian Federation

20:29.120 --> 20:32.760
later found there was less than a third, as many victims as initially reported, and they

20:32.760 --> 20:35.000
were executed by German weapons.

20:35.000 --> 20:37.480
Then why did the USSR admit that it happened?

20:37.480 --> 20:45.640
Okay, so what it was was an ethnic cleansing of polls by the Soviets after Nazi Germany

20:45.640 --> 20:47.960
and Soviet Russia cut Poland in half.

20:47.960 --> 20:51.520
When the Nazis later invaded the Soviet Union, they discovered the atrocity and presented

20:51.520 --> 20:52.720
it to the world.

20:52.720 --> 20:57.160
And history has since shown that they presented it to the world accurately because after the

20:57.160 --> 21:01.720
Soviet Union fell, the Russians revealed evidence that yes, the Stalinists had indeed done it.

21:01.720 --> 21:05.880
The Nazis were clearly guilty of their own crimes, but they presented this one accurately

21:05.880 --> 21:10.520
and it is a common socialist talking point today to deny the Katyn massacre.

21:10.520 --> 21:15.200
In fact, I think Vosch actually did it once a couple years ago, but I don't think he knew

21:15.200 --> 21:16.200
what it was.

21:16.200 --> 21:20.240
He just knew that leftists deny the Katyn massacre, so he was going to deny it.

21:20.240 --> 21:22.560
I hope he's since changed his stance.

21:22.560 --> 21:25.960
And this happened recently from Black Hammer Times.

21:25.960 --> 21:30.840
Thanks to all of you, Black Hammer has successfully liberated 200 acres of land to build our city

21:30.840 --> 21:33.080
for colonized people only.

21:33.080 --> 21:36.520
We are located high up in the mountains, 10,000 feet in the air with rich soil.

21:36.520 --> 21:40.400
We have one lake and three rivers on the land.

21:40.400 --> 21:44.680
The Black Hammer Times are in fact a radical socialist group.

21:44.680 --> 21:48.640
They've now, they've now purchased, presumably purchased this land and they're building a

21:48.640 --> 21:51.840
commune and you know, good for them.

21:51.840 --> 21:53.360
It's their choice to do what they want.

21:53.360 --> 21:54.360
Go ahead.

21:54.360 --> 21:57.280
But keep in mind, this is going to be a commune run by this guy.

21:57.280 --> 21:59.280
Hello Antifa.

21:59.280 --> 22:02.000
It's me, Ghazi.

22:02.000 --> 22:06.800
The commander in chief of the Black Hammer organization.

22:06.800 --> 22:07.800
Land back.

22:07.800 --> 22:08.800
Land back.

22:08.800 --> 22:09.800
Land back.

22:09.800 --> 22:10.800
Land back.

22:10.800 --> 22:16.480
I heard you had some not so nice things to say about me.

22:16.480 --> 22:24.040
I heard you had some nice things to say about my hammers.

22:24.040 --> 22:34.040
I heard you had not so nice things to do to one of my members, one of my dear, dear members,

22:34.040 --> 22:38.720
an African Filipino mother that you doxxed and thought you could get away with it, thought

22:38.720 --> 22:42.520
we were going to back down, thought we were going to take it.

22:42.520 --> 22:45.360
No, that's not going to happen.

22:45.360 --> 22:48.360
You messed with the wrong one this time.

22:48.360 --> 22:49.360
Yes.

22:49.360 --> 22:50.360
Oh yes you did.

22:50.360 --> 22:51.360
Oh yes you did.

22:52.360 --> 23:03.360
Because we don't take it lightly when harm is done to our African colonized women.

23:03.360 --> 23:11.360
And that's why at Black Hammer we say, touch one, touch all, touch one, touch all, touch

23:11.360 --> 23:19.360
one, touch all, touch one, touch all, touch one, touch all, and you touched one of us.

23:19.360 --> 23:25.360
So now you touched all of us and we're going to have to do something about it.

23:25.360 --> 23:29.360
And with takes like this, didn't you call Anne Frank a colonizer?

23:29.360 --> 23:30.360
She is.

23:30.360 --> 23:36.360
You know how there's like a lot of hatred towards Jewish people from Black people, like

23:36.360 --> 23:39.360
in very general terms, like the Louis Farrakhan types?

23:39.360 --> 23:41.360
Yeah, that is the cloth these people are cut from.

23:41.360 --> 23:45.360
Y'all going to, y'all whites going to keep asking us how we're going to keep ourselves

23:45.360 --> 23:47.360
warm up in the mountains?

23:47.360 --> 23:51.360
Y'all already know it just takes a good book to burn and some nice wood.

23:51.360 --> 23:54.360
So they're going to burn Anne Frank's books to keep warm.

23:54.360 --> 23:55.360
Holy fuck.

23:55.360 --> 23:59.360
Colonizers have enslaved, genocided, ate, tortured, and oppressed us for centuries.

23:59.360 --> 24:03.360
But get mad when we say we're going to burn a white girl's diary.

24:03.360 --> 24:07.360
Sorry, but we don't share the same material reality with daughters of German imperialists

24:07.360 --> 24:09.360
and armies that killed our people.

24:09.360 --> 24:13.360
When your socialism is woke enough to murder the Jews.

24:13.360 --> 24:14.360
Fuck.

24:14.360 --> 24:19.360
This will be probably the most insane take in this entire video.

24:19.360 --> 24:22.360
And it's going to be because there's actually a lot of it.

24:22.360 --> 24:23.360
So let's, let's check this out.

24:23.360 --> 24:24.360
Okay.

24:24.360 --> 24:25.360
This is on Quora.

24:25.360 --> 24:27.360
It's an answer to the question, what do communists want?

24:27.360 --> 24:32.360
I want to stop having to be on the defensive against propaganda and liberal lies about

24:32.360 --> 24:33.360
communism.

24:33.360 --> 24:37.360
Anti communists regurgitate some cold war or Nazi propaganda about socialism always

24:37.360 --> 24:39.360
failing, or Mao killed a gazillion people.

24:39.360 --> 24:42.360
And somehow this is supposed to surprise, shock and deflate me.

24:42.360 --> 24:43.360
Yeah.

24:43.360 --> 24:47.360
You sound like the Nazi who, when he's told that there are 6 million Jews dead, he's

24:47.360 --> 24:49.360
like, I know it's good.

24:49.360 --> 24:50.360
Isn't it?

24:50.360 --> 24:53.360
When I present actual facts that debunk the lies instead of them addressing my facts,

24:53.360 --> 24:56.360
they call me a Stalin apologist, Holocaust denier, et cetera.

24:56.360 --> 24:57.360
Who's being irrational.

24:57.360 --> 25:00.360
Who's using the facts or am I supposed to just say, okay, thank you for enlightening

25:00.360 --> 25:04.360
me with your capitalist propaganda and Russia phobic white nationalism.

25:04.360 --> 25:07.360
Weren't the Russians white people don't want to cooperate.

25:07.360 --> 25:11.360
You will have to use violence to stop those who resist having their riches nationalized.

25:11.360 --> 25:14.360
You have to fill up the prisons with people who refuse to pay their taxes.

25:14.360 --> 25:15.360
That's actually true.

25:15.360 --> 25:19.360
If a bunch of insulin manufacturing executives take up arms to prevent the people from nationalizing

25:19.360 --> 25:24.360
the industry and saving lives by bringing down the cost of insulin, then if violence

25:24.360 --> 25:28.360
is used to resist their violence, why is this a moral problem for me?

25:28.360 --> 25:29.360
Hold on.

25:29.360 --> 25:30.360
Wait.

25:30.360 --> 25:31.360
To resist.

25:31.360 --> 25:32.360
No, no.

25:32.360 --> 25:34.360
If violence is used to resist their, hold on.

25:34.360 --> 25:36.360
You're the one using the, you're the one starting the violence here, man.

25:36.360 --> 25:40.360
If a bunch of insulin manufacturing executives take up arms to prevent the people from nationalizing

25:40.360 --> 25:42.360
the industry, listen, they own the business.

25:42.360 --> 25:43.360
All right.

25:43.360 --> 25:49.360
In preventing the people from nationalizing their industry, they are the ones on the defense.

25:49.360 --> 25:54.360
If violence is used to resist their violence, which is already a resistance of my violence,

25:54.360 --> 25:56.360
why is this a moral problem for me?

25:56.360 --> 25:58.360
See, he has to phrase it as if he's on the defensive, but he's not.

25:58.360 --> 25:59.360
He's the aggressor.

25:59.360 --> 26:01.360
I would enjoy smashing them.

26:01.360 --> 26:02.360
It would mean justice is done.

26:02.360 --> 26:06.360
Justice is done when we prevent people from who own their property from doing what they

26:06.360 --> 26:07.360
like with it.

26:07.360 --> 26:08.360
Yeah.

26:08.360 --> 26:09.360
Yeah.

26:09.360 --> 26:13.360
Justice requires that people can learn to be more pro-social and less selfish.

26:13.360 --> 26:14.360
Just straight up propaganda.

26:14.360 --> 26:15.360
All right.

26:15.360 --> 26:17.360
No, I don't feel sorry for the kulaks.

26:17.360 --> 26:20.360
They killed many families during their riots.

26:20.360 --> 26:24.360
They slaughtered half the livestock used to farm the land.

26:24.360 --> 26:27.360
They hid grain to speculate on prices, knowing people were suffering.

26:27.360 --> 26:29.360
They probably hid grain to eat themselves, you fuck.

26:29.360 --> 26:33.360
They encourage others to stop growing again, which would have made the famine worse.

26:33.360 --> 26:34.360
They deserved it.

26:34.360 --> 26:36.360
In this photo, Soviet workers found them hiding grain.

26:36.360 --> 26:38.360
The kulaks deserve what they got.

26:38.360 --> 26:44.360
So, if you own a farm and you want to, say, you know, own the means of production and

26:44.360 --> 26:49.360
keep the produce of your labor, then you're a kulak.

26:49.360 --> 26:53.360
Literally what socialists say they want before they take power after they take power.

26:53.360 --> 26:56.360
If people actually have it, you're a fucking kulak.

26:56.360 --> 26:58.360
Democracy stinks.

26:58.360 --> 27:01.360
This guy's mask off about it.

27:01.360 --> 27:04.360
Studies have shown there is no relationship between the public wants and policy enactment.

27:04.360 --> 27:05.360
Zero.

27:05.360 --> 27:06.360
Yeah.

27:06.360 --> 27:07.360
Okay.

27:07.360 --> 27:08.360
Not all the time, but sometimes.

27:08.360 --> 27:10.360
American-style representative democracy is a farce.

27:10.360 --> 27:11.360
The rich own the politicians.

27:11.360 --> 27:16.360
At least in China, they have a functional and well-run government that plans the economy.

27:16.360 --> 27:21.360
China only started becoming relevant when they liberalized and opened up.

27:21.360 --> 27:22.360
And they're not even that liberal.

27:22.360 --> 27:25.360
They just allowed some kind of liberal economics to take hold.

27:25.360 --> 27:27.360
Human nature is communism.

27:27.360 --> 27:32.360
Up until 12,000 years ago, humans lived as hunter-gatherers in communist societies.

27:32.360 --> 27:35.360
Moneyless, stateless, and classless.

27:35.360 --> 27:38.360
It sounds like you're a reactionary, my friend, trying to go back to the past.

27:38.360 --> 27:41.360
Evolution has shaped us towards communism, not capitalism.

27:41.360 --> 27:42.360
Not bullshit.

27:42.360 --> 27:47.360
Again, I've talked about this before in the past, and there will probably be a much deeper video on the subject in the future,

27:47.360 --> 27:50.360
but we are evolutionarily shaped towards liberalism, in fact.

27:50.360 --> 27:56.360
There is a reason that we have a base understanding of property in our psychology that seems to be innate.

27:56.360 --> 27:58.360
People have no understanding of communism.

27:58.360 --> 28:03.360
At the beginning of the movie, 2001, A Space Odyssey, the early humans wake up to find the monolith.

28:03.360 --> 28:05.360
They nervously approach it, not sure what to make of it.

28:05.360 --> 28:08.360
It fascinates them, so they get closer and poke it.

28:08.360 --> 28:09.360
But then they cower away.

28:09.360 --> 28:13.360
They are intrigued, terrified, fascinated, and mystified by it.

28:13.360 --> 28:14.360
It is alien to them.

28:14.360 --> 28:17.360
It is so beyond their range of comprehension.

28:17.360 --> 28:18.360
It is literally beyond anything they could imagine.

28:18.360 --> 28:19.360
It is alien.

28:19.360 --> 28:21.360
They don't know what to make of it.

28:21.360 --> 28:22.360
Their best guesses are not even close.

28:22.360 --> 28:25.360
It is an entirely different paradigm.

28:25.360 --> 28:28.360
It represents the next leap forward of human existence, and they don't know it.

28:28.360 --> 28:32.360
I see this same phenomenon on how people approach communism.

28:32.360 --> 28:33.360
There is no difference.

28:33.360 --> 28:35.360
Communism is the monolith.

28:35.360 --> 28:36.360
Hold on.

28:36.360 --> 28:40.360
In the previous point, you said that communism was what we lived in.

28:40.360 --> 28:41.360
It's our nature.

28:41.360 --> 28:46.360
And now you're saying that it's this alien object that is completely not like us at all.

28:46.360 --> 28:49.360
And moreover, you're worshipping it like a god.

28:49.360 --> 28:54.360
This is some literal God is the State fascist shit here.

28:54.360 --> 28:56.360
No, Joseph Stalin wasn't a monster.

28:56.360 --> 28:58.360
No, he didn't cause the Holodomor.

28:58.360 --> 28:59.360
He didn't kill 60 million people.

28:59.360 --> 29:01.360
He didn't become besties with Hitler.

29:01.360 --> 29:03.360
The kulaks deserved it.

29:03.360 --> 29:06.360
And the purges were not a cynical attempt by him to grab power.

29:06.360 --> 29:09.360
The people voted for the purges and wanted them.

29:09.360 --> 29:10.360
Hold on.

29:10.360 --> 29:12.360
Didn't you just say that democracy was bad?

29:12.360 --> 29:13.360
Wait.

29:13.360 --> 29:14.360
Wait.

29:14.360 --> 29:15.360
Wait.

29:15.360 --> 29:16.360
Hold on.

29:16.360 --> 29:17.360
I gotta parse this here.

29:17.360 --> 29:18.360
Democracy bad.

29:18.360 --> 29:20.360
That's what he said in a previous point.

29:20.360 --> 29:28.360
But he also said democracy, people voted for purges, and purges good.

29:28.360 --> 29:33.360
Like this guy contradicts his own points constantly in this.

29:33.360 --> 29:35.360
Democracy bad unless they vote for what I want.

29:35.360 --> 29:38.360
Holodomor isn't real, but the kulaks deserved it.

29:38.360 --> 29:41.360
Communism is both the future and our ancient past.

29:41.360 --> 29:42.360
Fuck, dude.

29:42.360 --> 29:45.360
Mao and friends didn't kill a gazillion.

29:45.360 --> 29:49.360
Mao and friends sounds like a Saturday morning cartoon show.

29:49.360 --> 29:50.360
Fuck.

29:50.360 --> 29:51.360
They didn't intentionally cause famines.

29:51.360 --> 29:55.360
The overall majority of those who were killed by communists were traitors, saboteurs, Nazis,

29:56.360 --> 30:01.360
and class enemies hellbent on returning people to capitalist slavery.

30:01.360 --> 30:06.360
I don't know what kind of warped reality you have to live in to think any of these things,

30:06.360 --> 30:07.360
man.

30:07.360 --> 30:08.360
To think that the Soviets were good.

30:08.360 --> 30:10.360
To think that the Maoists were good.

30:10.360 --> 30:12.360
Or the Cubans or the Venezuelans.

30:12.360 --> 30:13.360
Like fuck me, dude.

30:13.360 --> 30:15.360
Like, you've seen this meme before, right?

30:15.360 --> 30:18.360
Where it's the Joker and it's like, you don't like capitalism, yet you exist.

30:18.360 --> 30:21.360
iPhone, Venezuela, sometimes it's vuvuzela.

30:21.360 --> 30:24.360
Bottom text, 100 billion dead.

30:24.360 --> 30:28.360
Even like Shu On Head has said this in her videos at some point.

30:28.360 --> 30:30.360
And it's amazing.

30:30.360 --> 30:39.360
Like, imagine being a Nazi in 2021 and someone approaches you with the legitimate, obvious,

30:39.360 --> 30:43.360
glaring problems in the fact that you're a Nazi, okay?

30:43.360 --> 30:47.360
And then you say, lol, Germany, Jews, 6 million cookies baked.

30:47.360 --> 30:52.360
The fact that you can memeify something does not actually refute that thing.

30:52.360 --> 30:57.360
But that's something that people like Shu, the socialist millennials and zoomers don't

30:57.360 --> 30:58.360
really understand.

30:58.360 --> 31:01.360
To them, memeifying is the same thing as refuting.

31:01.360 --> 31:06.360
There seems to be this common attitude among these types of people where all sincerity

31:06.360 --> 31:08.360
is run down by irony.

31:08.360 --> 31:09.360
Cynicism rules the day.

31:09.360 --> 31:13.360
And if you're hopeful or if you're building towards something or if you're happy or

31:13.360 --> 31:17.360
you feel like you have your life on track, if you're grateful, if you have a sense

31:17.360 --> 31:21.360
of duty, if you value love over casual sexual connection.

31:21.360 --> 31:27.360
Any of these more esoteric qualities, these people would absolutely batter you with cynicism.

31:27.360 --> 31:29.360
And fair enough, cynical humor is pretty funny.

31:29.360 --> 31:34.360
But I really do think this too cool for school, I'm a cynic about everything, fedora tipping

31:34.360 --> 31:40.360
atheist edgelord nonsense has defined a lot of their politics as well as their emotional

31:40.360 --> 31:41.360
state.

31:41.360 --> 31:43.360
Probably why all the atheist YouTubers became socialists in the end.

31:43.360 --> 31:46.360
And of course, this is what these people are, guys.

31:46.360 --> 31:49.360
Reddit's r slash socialism survey.

31:49.360 --> 31:54.360
48% unemployed, 61% live with their parents, 14% support free speech.

31:54.360 --> 31:55.360
Is anyone surprised?

31:55.360 --> 31:59.360
Now, like, I'm not going to shit on people if they're unemployed, it can be hard to

31:59.360 --> 32:00.360
get a job.

32:00.360 --> 32:02.360
I'm not going to show them if they're living with their parents.

32:02.360 --> 32:04.360
Sometimes it's hard to get started in life.

32:04.360 --> 32:07.360
Or maybe you're saving money so that you can actually go and do something big with

32:07.360 --> 32:08.360
it.

32:08.360 --> 32:11.360
But the free speech thing, that's pretty unacceptable, isn't it?

32:11.360 --> 32:15.360
The stereotype of leftists and socialists on the right wing is one of spoiled losers unemployed

32:16.360 --> 32:19.360
listless with no regard for economics or the law.

32:19.360 --> 32:21.360
But just how true is the stereotype?

32:21.360 --> 32:25.360
According to a public survey on Reddit's r slash socialism board, it's painfully

32:25.360 --> 32:26.360
accurate.

32:26.360 --> 32:30.360
According to the survey, in which the results were self-admitted by the predominantly leftist

32:30.360 --> 32:35.360
users of the board, 48% of the young socialists are unemployed and a stratospherically high

32:35.360 --> 32:38.360
number of 61% still live with their parents.

32:38.360 --> 32:43.360
Furthermore, the results found that 69% of the board's users were uneducated, 46% support

32:43.360 --> 32:48.360
violent riots, and just 14% support the constitutional definition of unlimited free speech.

32:48.360 --> 32:52.360
This is not the first time that documentation of leftists being losers has been confirmed

32:52.360 --> 32:57.360
as a study of Antifa activists in Europe confirmed that 9 out of 10 leftist protesters still

32:57.360 --> 32:58.360
live with their parents.

32:58.360 --> 33:04.360
Alright, uh, obvious bias of this article being left aside for a minute.

33:04.360 --> 33:07.360
It is funny to see this sort of thing get confirmed, isn't it?

33:07.360 --> 33:09.360
Again, I do have some sympathy for them.

33:09.360 --> 33:12.360
There is a difference between the guy who lives at home because he's taking care of

33:12.360 --> 33:15.360
his parents, or his parents live 15 minutes away from the university and he's going

33:15.360 --> 33:18.360
to school and it's just cheaper to stay there, or if he's saving up money to move

33:18.360 --> 33:23.360
away or launch a business or go to school or buy his own place, you know, whatever.

33:23.360 --> 33:27.360
There are reasons to do this stuff, but I don't have much sympathy for people who

33:27.360 --> 33:32.360
just sit around and waste what little money they have on, on booze or drugs or worthless

33:32.360 --> 33:35.360
shit that doesn't help them get ahead and then complain that they're still living

33:35.360 --> 33:36.360
at their parents.

33:36.360 --> 33:38.360
You make choices, you have to live with them.

33:38.360 --> 33:40.360
I will say these people generally do have good intentions.

33:40.360 --> 33:45.360
They believe that their ideas, as idealistic and utopian as they are, they can make everyone

33:45.360 --> 33:47.360
equal and eliminate all injustice.

33:47.360 --> 33:50.360
The eliminate all injustice stuff is good, even though it's unobtainable.

33:50.360 --> 33:52.360
The making everyone equal stuff isn't good.

33:52.360 --> 33:56.360
As long as there are differences in the quality and quantity of production, there will always

33:56.360 --> 33:57.360
be inequality.

33:57.360 --> 34:00.360
Trying to make everyone equal is actually not a good idea.

34:00.360 --> 34:01.360
It's a bad idea.

34:01.360 --> 34:03.360
But on the surface level, I can see why it's appealing to some people.

34:03.360 --> 34:07.360
You know, you don't want there to be racism or sexism, so fair enough.

34:07.360 --> 34:11.360
But the problem with them is that they're idealistic and utopian, even the good things

34:11.360 --> 34:12.360
that they want to do.

34:12.360 --> 34:16.360
And in my opinion, there's not much good, but even the good things that they want to

34:16.360 --> 34:18.360
do, they cannot actually accomplish.

34:18.360 --> 34:22.360
The libertarian socialists cannot actually do what they want to do without becoming the

34:22.360 --> 34:24.360
tankies they claim to despise.

34:24.360 --> 34:28.360
But the worst part of all is when they see people who disagree with them, whether that

34:28.360 --> 34:33.360
be conservatives or liberals or even fascists, but you know, they have their own problems.

34:33.360 --> 34:38.360
The socialists get very angry because from their point of view, they're working to save

34:38.360 --> 34:41.360
the world and they can't understand why no one else wants to save it with them.

34:41.360 --> 34:45.360
So they just look at everyone and say that they're hateful or they're bigoted or they

34:45.360 --> 34:46.360
want people to be oppressed.

34:46.360 --> 34:50.360
And the actual answer is that most people who are liberals and who are conservatives,

34:50.360 --> 34:52.360
they're realists who want freedom.

34:52.360 --> 34:56.360
And they understand that freedom and equality are somewhat incompatible because if you allow

34:56.360 --> 35:01.360
people to simply be free and do what they want, they will act in an unequal manner.

35:01.360 --> 35:07.360
And you end up with socialists outright despising non socialists because they think they're evil.

35:07.360 --> 35:11.360
They think they're on a glorious crusade to save human civilization from itself.

35:11.360 --> 35:15.360
And that is how you get to all of the examples I've shown you today from the intersectionalists

35:15.360 --> 35:19.360
talking about class war and class conflict to the socialists who decry the Stalinists

35:19.360 --> 35:23.360
simply because they have not yet allowed their ideas to come to their natural end.

35:23.360 --> 35:27.360
And the Stalinists themselves for being the fascist pieces of shit that they actually are.

35:27.360 --> 35:32.360
This is why people say that the radical left is good while the radical right is bad.

35:32.360 --> 35:38.360
That the radical left simply means extreme equality for everyone, even though that would actually be bad.

35:38.360 --> 35:41.360
And the radical right wants to eradicate everyone who's not them.

35:41.360 --> 35:46.360
But from the radical right's point of view, they just want extreme freedom for everyone.

35:46.360 --> 35:49.360
And they view the radical left as wanting to eradicate everyone who's not them.

35:49.360 --> 35:51.360
As always, the truth is somewhere in the middle.

35:51.360 --> 35:56.360
If you don't think that both extreme ends of the spectrum have a taste for genocide,

35:56.360 --> 35:58.360
you have to be historically ignorant.

35:58.360 --> 36:03.360
But at the same time, there are well-meaning leftists out there who simply want people to be cared for.

36:03.360 --> 36:07.360
And there are well-meaning rightists out there who simply want people to be left alone.

36:07.360 --> 36:13.360
I think, to your average person, the rightist position seems less harmful overall

36:13.360 --> 36:15.360
because if you're left alone, well then you're just left alone.

36:15.360 --> 36:19.360
You might suffer, you might not suffer, but at the very least the situation will be in your hands.

36:19.360 --> 36:25.360
Meanwhile, the goals of the moderate leftist requires a lot more centralized control to actually do the caring.

36:25.360 --> 36:27.360
So when things go wrong, they go wrong for everyone.

36:27.360 --> 36:32.360
I think this might be the core reason why a lot of moderate leftists sometimes carry water for the tankies.

36:32.360 --> 36:39.360
While in my experience anyway, it's somewhat rare that the free marketeers carry water for the imperialists and the monarchists.

36:39.360 --> 36:42.360
But that is the champagne socialist in a nutshell.

36:42.360 --> 36:50.360
Sometimes good people with sometimes good intentions who will ultimately be discarded if a socialist revolution ever actually happens.

36:50.360 --> 37:00.360
And just in case you think that might actually happen someday, I'll leave you with this fun video of a Democratic Socialist of America meeting on April 14th, 2021.

37:00.360 --> 37:04.360
These people ain't ever getting shit done, guys. Don't worry about it.

37:04.360 --> 37:13.360
If we want to defeat capitalism, we are going to need a party that will organize working people to fight for the demands that we want and to win socialism.

37:13.360 --> 37:14.360
Thank you so much.

37:14.360 --> 37:17.360
Quick point of privilege. Quick point of personal privilege.

37:18.360 --> 37:21.360
Guys, first of all, James Jackson, Sacramento, he him.

37:21.360 --> 37:24.360
I just want to say, can we please keep the chatter to a minimum?

37:24.360 --> 37:27.360
I'm one of the people who's very, very prone to sensory overload.

37:27.360 --> 37:29.360
There's a lot of whispering and chatter going on.

37:29.360 --> 37:31.360
It's making it very difficult for me to focus.

37:31.360 --> 37:36.360
Please, can we just, I know we're all fresh and ready to go, but can we please just keep the chatter to a minimum?

37:36.360 --> 37:38.360
It's affecting my ability to focus. Thank you.

37:38.360 --> 37:39.360
Thank you, comrade.

37:39.360 --> 37:42.360
Okay, is there a speaker against name, chapter, pronoun?

37:42.360 --> 37:44.360
Point of personal privilege. Point of personal privilege.

37:44.360 --> 37:45.360
Yes.

37:45.360 --> 37:50.360
Please do not use gendered language to address everyone.

37:52.360 --> 37:53.360
Okay.
