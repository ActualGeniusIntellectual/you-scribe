1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,200
Good morning gamers!

2
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:11,520
Yes it's true, I've been gone for a little bit, and yes it's true, I'm back!

3
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:15,640
I have been working on some rather large projects that I hope one day will in fact see the light

4
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:16,640
of day.

5
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:19,120
For those of you who actually watch my streams, you know what I'm talking about, because

6
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:21,960
I've described them in a bit more detail over there, and if you haven't, what's

7
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:22,960
wrong with you?

8
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:25,560
I'll talk a bit more about them tonight on stream again, in case you wanted to ask

9
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:28,040
some questions or hear about it or whatever.

10
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:34,120
But today we are talking about champagne socialists, bougie communists, the people

11
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:38,560
who say eat the rich even though they are the rich that will inevitably be eaten.

12
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:42,680
Now of course in one of my more recent videos, we talked about Black Lives Matter leader

13
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:48,760
Patrisse Khan Cullors, and how despite her Marxism, her equality above all rhetoric,

14
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:52,860
she's raking in the cash and buying four separate homes.

15
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:54,940
Well, let's listen to her talk about it.

16
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:28,980
Sure, and I think that is a critique that is wanting.

17
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:37,420
And I say that because the way that I live my life is in direct support to Black people,

18
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:41,260
including my Black family members, first and foremost.

19
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:49,060
And for so many Black folks who are able to invest in themselves and their community,

20
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:52,940
they choose to invest in their family, and that's what I've chosen to do.

21
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:58,060
I have a child, I have a brother that has severe mental illness that I take care of,

22
00:01:58,060 --> 00:02:02,820
I support my mother, and I support many other family members of mine.

23
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:11,620
And so I see my money as not my own, I see it as my family's money as well.

24
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:12,960
Pretty incredible, eh?

25
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:19,040
Is that all it takes to make this massive wealth accumulation acceptable within a Marxist

26
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,040
lens?

27
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:25,800
So every billionaire, every dirty, rotten capitalist who is raking in the dough hand

28
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:31,080
over fist, if they're doing it for their families, if they're taking care of their families,

29
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,200
it's okay.

30
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:33,280
Is that what I'm hearing here?

31
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:37,880
Or maybe it's because her family is Black, and therefore she can say that by taking care

32
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:40,960
of her family, she is taking care of Black people.

33
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:44,640
If you're looking at it through a race lens, I guess that makes sense, but it's still pretty

34
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:45,700
disgusting, eh?

35
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:50,620
Of course the actual truth is, it does not betray Marxist principles in practice because

36
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:55,980
it is exactly what every single Marxist leader has ever done throughout the entire history

37
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:57,340
of Marxism.

38
00:02:57,340 --> 00:03:01,380
And yes, there will be idiots on the left who will look at this and say, this isn't

39
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:06,340
a leftist problem, this is a liberal problem, she's a rad lib, intersectionality and identity

40
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:08,180
politics, that's rad lib shit.

41
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:10,620
Yeah, I'm not convinced of that.

42
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:15,580
I was at the publications table today, and I was speaking to this young person from Arizona

43
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:23,700
who's trying to fight SB 1070, and he grabbed a book, and he said, it's like Mal's red book.

44
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:28,500
And I was like, man, that's what I was thinking, and it was just really cool to hear him make

45
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:29,500
that connection.

46
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:35,420
And I was like, how about you buy 10 to 15 of these books, and you all have a youth organizing

47
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:39,760
group where you talk about it, and you really try to engage this, and we can just kind of,

48
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:42,880
we need to build off of this.

49
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:47,840
No liberal would ever compare their writing to Mao's little red book.

50
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:50,880
That is the rhetoric of a socialist revolutionary.

51
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:56,120
Moreover, I like how she just says, yeah, just, you know, buy 10, 15 of those books,

52
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:59,640
why don't you pay for my houses, poor people?

53
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:00,640
Here's what I mean, though.

54
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,920
Look at this person's bio.

55
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:08,800
Yeah, it's cancerous, but this is what a leftist would say is a liberal bio, is a rad lib bio.

56
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:11,720
Nothing in here talks about class conflict or class struggle.

57
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:17,200
Nothing in here talks about Marxism or socialism or communism, it is all idpol.

58
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:22,520
And yet, hot take, the rural white America that left-wing people flirt so much with loving

59
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:24,420
is a bunch of landlords.

60
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:30,000
They are far, far more repulsive than the professional managerial class that is so hated,

61
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,600
and the fact that they are not identified as class enemies is a failure.

62
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:38,480
Like you want to invoke Mao, liquidate white farmers and hand their land over to the Latin

63
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:42,760
next farm workers and convert it back to native land directly.

64
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:44,260
These are not liberal positions.

65
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:49,100
In fact, as contradictory as it might sound on the face of it, these are bourgeois socialist

66
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:50,160
opinions.

67
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:55,240
This is literally kill the kulaks rhetoric, kill the poor who refuse to revolt with us.

68
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:56,240
Remember new guy?

69
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:01,680
Well, here's Mallory Jessica Yoshida's person who drew that comic and who still a year and

70
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,740
a half later has not gotten over it.

71
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:07,800
She has no empathy for the wealthy and wants to steal from the rich.

72
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:10,760
You gotta pay quite a bit to live in Seattle, but fine.

73
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:14,480
Howdy, I'm the weird and dorky cartoonist behind Nightmare Girls.

74
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,560
Money please!

75
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:18,280
It is great when they just get straight to the point, isn't it?

76
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:20,040
Give me what you have.

77
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,040
That's all it is.

78
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:26,840
Beneath, you know what, I think beneath most socialist activism is just egoism in the end.

79
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:32,920
When supplies of drugs run low, drug prices mysteriously rise, data shows.

80
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:36,560
And the less competition, the higher the price hikes.

81
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:40,380
This can't be a real article, I mean I know it's on Ars Technica, but you have to be

82
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:44,420
ignorant of all economics to be surprised at this, right?

83
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:52,560
When nearly 100 drugs became scarce between 2015 and 2016, their prices mysteriously increased

84
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,780
more than twice as fast as their expected rate.

85
00:05:55,780 --> 00:06:00,260
An analysis recently published reveals the price hikes were highest if the pharmaceutical

86
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:04,000
companies behind the drugs had little competition.

87
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:04,500
Are-

88
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:11,240
Literally Econ 101.

89
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:14,060
Wha- how is this happening?

90
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:16,600
No one's competing with these guys?

91
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:17,600
Supplies running out?

92
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,640
Why are the prices going up?

93
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:20,520
This happened here in Canada last summer.

94
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:25,200
The vandalism of a Nazi monument in Ontario is being investigated as a hate crime.

95
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:28,080
Oh jeez, we have Nazi monuments here apparently.

96
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:32,200
A monument in Oakville Ontario commemorating those who served under Adolf Hitler in the

97
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:36,640
14th SS division was recently graffitied with the words Nazi war monument.

98
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:40,400
The incident which police say appeared to target an identifiable group is being investigated

99
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,320
as a hate-motivated crime.

100
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:47,760
I guess if the legal definition of hate-motivated crime is targeting an identifiable group,

101
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:50,440
SS officers is an identifiable group.

102
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:52,480
But here's the actual situation.

103
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:57,480
Someone painted Nazi war monument on a stone cenotaph located in Oakville in the Saint

104
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:59,960
Volodymyr Ukrainian cemetery.

105
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:05,300
Oakville has a large population of Ukrainian immigrants and refugees, and the 14th SS division

106
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:08,360
was made up of Ukrainians who pledged allegiance to Hitler.

107
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:11,560
Some members of the division have been accused of killing Polish women and children as well

108
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:13,680
as Jews during the second world war.

109
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:14,840
So fair enough.

110
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:18,920
Countries like Ukraine and Poland and others, who have historically found themselves between

111
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:22,760
a rock and a hard place, with the Russians and the Germans on either side, probably did

112
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:24,960
have some people who ended up doing this stuff.

113
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:28,560
And you know, even though this is part of some Ukrainian cultural heritage, maybe we

114
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,760
shouldn't be doing this sort of stuff in Canada, eh?

115
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:35,160
Of course it might be the case that the reason that the 14th SS division is memorialized

116
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:40,360
in places like Canada is not because they were actually the 14th SS division.

117
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:41,940
They were at one point.

118
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:46,180
The actual history of the division is that it was one of the only divisions that was

119
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:51,080
not found guilty of any wrongdoing during the second world war at the Nuremberg trials.

120
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:56,640
Additionally, a lot of the individuals involved were forced into service, and as the Nazis

121
00:07:56,640 --> 00:08:01,520
began to lose the war, large parts of the unit started working for the Ukrainian Insurgent

122
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:06,440
Army, which was a paramilitary organization that fought during World War II against the

123
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:09,720
Soviet Union, Communist Poland, as well as Nazi Germany.

124
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:15,860
And in the wars last year, the entire 14th SS division abandoned Germany and became the

125
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:18,060
first Ukrainian division.

126
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:22,200
In other words, it's not as simple as saying that these people were Nazis and that was

127
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,200
that.

128
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:26,520
A large number of veterans from this division did in fact move to Canada and end up in Oakville,

129
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:28,680
but they were all vetted by the Canadian government.

130
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:31,280
And as best as we can tell, they seem to be innocent.

131
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:36,400
Of course, if you're a brain dead bougie communist, you're just going to spray paint Nazi war

132
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:38,120
monument and leave it at that.

133
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:42,880
In much the same way, when Canada began building a memorial to the victims of communism, of

134
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:46,340
course these same people will spray paint on it, communism will win.

135
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:50,720
The best part about this is that it's not even denying the victims of communism.

136
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:54,860
It's not denying the fact that they were victims, that they got liquidated, that they were put

137
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:56,800
in camps and mass and killed.

138
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:00,260
It's simply saying, yeah, no, communism is going to win anyway.

139
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:02,820
We will kill all these people and it's not going to be a problem because we're going

140
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:03,820
to win.

141
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:04,820
Like, holy shit.

142
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:05,820
It's one thing to deny atrocities.

143
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:08,380
It's another thing entirely to say those atrocities were good.

144
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:11,940
And you can find this image anywhere, but this particular one that I'm looking at is

145
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:18,420
on r slash America's Socialists, a pro socialist subreddit.

146
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:21,100
And check out some of the comments under this image.

147
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:22,220
You people are absolute scum.

148
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:25,340
I have a few Romanian construction worker friends that would love to enlighten you about

149
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:29,560
life under communism, a naive consumer of heartbreaking stories.

150
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:33,700
They're all innocent victims of communism, but if you check most of their stories, the

151
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:35,340
reality is quite different.

152
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:40,740
I personally checked more than one such story and all of these innocent victims can either

153
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:43,620
be murderers or Nazi collaborators.

154
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:47,200
Canada sheltered thousands of Nazi criminals after world war II.

155
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:52,200
The descendants of these scum built such memorials with impunity and invent millions of victims

156
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,320
of communism.

157
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:56,200
I like how you can't be a liberal and oppose communism.

158
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:58,480
If you oppose communism, you have to be a fascist.

159
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:05,360
These people do not understand why normal, everyday, nonpolitical, unaligned people oppose

160
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,360
them.

161
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:07,360
And I'm sure you guys remember this too.

162
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:12,520
A same energy where a us cadet who wore a Che Guevara t-shirt underneath his uniform

163
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:16,720
and had communism will win in his hat got completely expelled.

164
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:19,720
I think he, I think he first ruined his life after doing a quick search.

165
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:24,920
This image took place in a back in 2018, he hasn't really done anything since.

166
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:28,640
He just retweets a bunch of lefties on Twitter, but he isn't, he doesn't seem to be doing

167
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:31,000
anything in any political space.

168
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Good job, dude.

169
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
You did it.

170
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
You beat capitalism.

171
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,880
But of course the best takes come from a tanky collective.

172
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:41,340
DM this guy, any cursed tanky takes you might find here, I'll give you a lightning round

173
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:42,760
of these ridiculous takes.

174
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:46,800
What the hell kind of socialist rejects and demonizes Stalin.

175
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:50,840
Imagine playing teacher's pet to the bourgeoisie, lapping up their propaganda and slander against

176
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:53,440
one of the greatest revolutionary thinkers and leaders of all time.

177
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,120
Oh, I'm one of the good socialists.

178
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,740
I hate Stalin.

179
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:58,840
Imagine standing for Hitler.

180
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:01,080
That is the level that we're talking about here.

181
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:05,780
The US is more authoritarian than China ever will be.

182
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:07,400
Fucking incredible, dude.

183
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,720
Are we exterminating the Uyghurs?

184
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,660
Do we have a social credit system?

185
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:15,920
And speaking of the Uyghurs, it's better to be Uyghurs because Uyghurs don't, Uyghurs

186
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:20,400
doesn't suffer any repression unlike our Palestinian comrades.

187
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:21,400
That's how it is, eh?

188
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:25,520
You just define oppression as something that only non-socialist countries can do.

189
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:31,000
There's a fellow on Twitter named Besfort, reactionary, so you're just a filthy communist?

190
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,760
Me, yes, thank you very much.

191
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:36,920
Turns out Besfort is the founder and CEO of a company.

192
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:40,200
You're not much of a communist, are you?

193
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,120
Hammer and sickle and name.

194
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:45,880
In that case, fascism is based.

195
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:46,880
What is?

196
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:47,880
What?

197
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:52,640
Oh, he's referring to red fascists, otherwise known as the Soviets.

198
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:56,640
It was the Kuomintang who did little to defeat the Japanese.

199
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:59,380
They chose to fight the communists who were fighting the Japanese.

200
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:01,400
As a result, the communists became more popular.

201
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:04,880
They won the war in China and I'm using their flag, you fucking Maoist.

202
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:10,940
So the Kuomintang ended up becoming the Taiwan liberal government and before World War II,

203
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:14,360
the nationalists were fighting the communists in a civil war in China.

204
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:18,480
They basically set aside their civil war when the Japanese invaded and then resumed

205
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,600
it after World War II was over.

206
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:24,880
It's true that the Chinese nationalists viewed the communists as the worst threat compared

207
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:25,880
to the Japanese.

208
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:26,880
And guess what?

209
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:27,880
They were right.

210
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:31,480
And yes, they do think that red fascism is good.

211
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:35,800
Wow, I don't even know how to present this to you.

212
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:37,380
There's no jokes that can be made.

213
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:39,720
There's no like lightheartedness here.

214
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:42,200
It's just, they're just open about it.

215
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:48,120
And dude, I already dealt with time traveling famines and forest massacres.

216
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:51,920
Now I got to deal with time traveling forged documents.

217
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:55,800
There's a lot of Nazisploitation fiction that has time traveling in it, right?

218
00:12:55,800 --> 00:13:00,720
Along with vampires and werewolves and robots and hidden moon bases and shit.

219
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:05,000
People in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, otherwise known as North Korea,

220
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:09,560
have a better standard of living than many in the US and other Western nations.

221
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:12,200
Stop repeating imperialist bullshit.

222
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:17,400
If you were living in North Korea, you would not even have the crab in your avatar to eat.

223
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:19,480
Get the difference yet, Vosch?

224
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:22,320
Nazis started the Holocaust and communists ended the Holocaust.

225
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:27,460
I can't believe I have to come to Vosch's defense here because he is at least nominally

226
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:28,460
anti-tanky.

227
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:33,680
But yeah, I'm not going to be pro Nazi collaborator or pro Gulag, thank you very much.

228
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:41,800
Plus this guy here, this guy that he used as the Nazi image, he ended up being an embarrassment

229
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:47,000
to the Nazi party because he was considered to be the exemplar of the Aryan race.

230
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,880
And yet he was like one quarter or one eighth Jewish, it turned out later.

231
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:56,360
Rural voters are incredibly stupid, incredibly racist, incredibly evangelical, or incredibly

232
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:57,640
fascist.

233
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:58,820
Often all four.

234
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:04,860
This is literally just socialist moves to the city to pay $5,000 for a one room apartment

235
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:05,860
and hates his hometown.

236
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:11,000
And here's the reply he got, no poverty stricken underfunded areas aren't as educated or up

237
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,020
to moral code as I think they should be.

238
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:14,020
Let's leave them to suffer.

239
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:18,660
And he said, if it were up to me, their suffering would not be the result of indifference, but

240
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:21,020
direct action.

241
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:23,340
Socialists hate the poor.

242
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:26,300
Nazi death camps are bad and Soviet gulags are good.

243
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:29,740
Fuck, do we need to go any further?

244
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:33,660
I was hoping this video would be kind of funny, maybe we can have some laughs, make some jokes.

245
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:38,460
We've had a couple jokes so far, but I'm just stunned.

246
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:43,260
I'm stunned at leftist communists and the shit that they say.

247
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:47,600
Your reminder, today is delete Facebook day because Zuckerberg will favor Donald Trump's

248
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:50,320
freedom of speech over democracy.

249
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,320
He's out of office.

250
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:52,860
He's been out of office for six months.

251
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:56,540
Is this going to be like rent free and leftist heads for a while?

252
00:14:56,540 --> 00:15:01,020
Is Donald Trump going to be the political equivalent of that one girl that got away?

253
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:06,360
So your family suffered under quote unquote communism.

254
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:07,980
Why should I care?

255
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:08,980
Look at this smug motherfucker.

256
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:10,220
Do you even need to play the video?

257
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:11,220
Look at this guy.

258
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:14,420
Yeah, I don't care if my politics killed your family members.

259
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:15,420
What's that?

260
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:20,100
Is that the sound of me losing the whole ass moral high ground when it comes to slavery?

261
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:25,420
How could you have lived through 2020 and not become a communist based fucking Tina

262
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:26,420
here?

263
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:27,660
I've been following her on Twitter for a while.

264
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:34,420
She's great because my morgue only has a capacity of 2,500 bodies, but COVID yeah, we never

265
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:35,700
reach capacity.

266
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:39,000
It's always incredible when people working in healthcare, working in science come out

267
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:43,660
and completely debunk everything regarding the mainstream media narrative victims of

268
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:49,040
communism Memorial foundation adds a global coronavirus deaths to its tally of historical

269
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:54,440
victims of communism.

270
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:58,480
The victims of communism Memorial foundation is officially recognizing global coronavirus

271
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:02,240
deaths as the fault of the Chinese government and adding them to its tally of historical

272
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:06,160
victims of communism, the organization announced on Friday.

273
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:12,020
You know, if commies are going to do this really stupid song and dance of blaming like

274
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:18,880
people who die of starvation on say capitalism, which is dumb for a thousand fucking reasons,

275
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:22,780
but if they're going to do that, then he, I guess this makes sense.

276
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:25,120
Let's watch the advancement of a character arc.

277
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,120
Okay.

278
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:32,920
From DSA racist, I actually, I actually kind of know this guy.

279
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:36,800
He has been hating on me on and off for fucking years.

280
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:41,720
Vash is one of the most badly read, terribly spoken, incoherent bread tubers out there.

281
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:45,400
I wouldn't trust the leftism of a single one of his followers.

282
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:46,400
I mean, fair enough.

283
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:47,840
He that that's true.

284
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:51,640
But we're now into real leftist versus rad lib territory.

285
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:57,480
And our friend e-boy neat is taking up the position that the bread tubers are rad libs

286
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:58,760
actually in he's.

287
00:16:58,760 --> 00:16:59,920
He is the real leftist.

288
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:00,920
Okay.

289
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:02,080
Well let's see what this real leftism is.

290
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:07,500
The Uyghur genocide is a CIA manufactured myth pushed by the national endowment for

291
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:11,120
democracy, which is a us state department slush fund.

292
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:17,040
I swear to God, you know how like the right wing has, has the Q Anon cultists who are

293
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:19,800
really believing some wild ass out there shit.

294
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:25,180
I have a feeling the CIA is that same kind of thing to, to the radical leftists who are

295
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:27,780
believing wild ass out there shit.

296
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:35,480
Not only was there no cultural genocide, Tiananmen square was a CIA operation too.

297
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:36,480
Fuck it.

298
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:37,480
I'm done with theatrics.

299
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:38,480
You know what?

300
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:44,260
Genocide good.

301
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:47,660
Real leftism is when genocide good.

302
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:48,660
Holy fuck.

303
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:49,660
Oh yeah.

304
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:53,100
This is the thing that I mentioned on Adam and such as show a couple of days ago.

305
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:54,380
It turns out it wasn't a Twitter post.

306
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:58,740
It was actually a Reddit post, but somebody posted on, um, on Contra points as subreddit

307
00:17:58,740 --> 00:17:59,740
is Contra.

308
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:00,740
Okay.

309
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:04,920
And then the, uh, the post is removed, but it has to do with how Contra has been looking

310
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:06,660
on camera recently.

311
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:09,700
Those of you who don't know she has a drug problem and some of the things going on and

312
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:12,740
Contra says, that's my hair growing back in.

313
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:17,100
I guess 4chan wouldn't know about that cause they can't afford that all.

314
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:23,060
What she's referring here to here specifically is how there is a 4chan board for trans people,

315
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:27,500
which is, it can be a little bit insular and a little bit out there to be honest, but a

316
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:31,620
lot of the trans people that are quite poor and can't afford a lot of the various surgeries

317
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:34,420
and um, and things that are involved in transitioning.

318
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:41,140
And so here is a Contra points making fun of poor 4chan trannies who can't afford to

319
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:43,220
do the things that they want to do.

320
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:44,940
Fuck me, dude.

321
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:48,660
Like I've been called a transphobic before.

322
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:49,980
I don't think I am.

323
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:54,200
There are certainly things that I don't understand about the whole, the whole trans situation,

324
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:57,020
but I try my best to at least learn about them.

325
00:18:57,020 --> 00:19:01,380
Um, and I'm also as polite as I can be whenever possible because there's no reason not to

326
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:02,920
be right.

327
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:07,700
But fuck, I wouldn't make fun of somebody because they can't afford to transition.

328
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:09,220
Like what, what the fuck?

329
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:14,180
When people, people call Contra points a rad lib, like she's not a true leftist.

330
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:18,340
It seems like whenever we find like a person who's like, no, I'm a real leftist, I'm actually

331
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:20,660
a socialist, I'm not a rad lib.

332
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:24,720
And then they say like one ridiculous thing and then suddenly they're cast out as a rad

333
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:28,300
lib, but that's everybody, that's everybody in the movement.

334
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:34,600
They're all that the U S is worse than Nazi Germany.

335
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:38,640
So if it were world war II right now in the U S we're fighting against Nazi Germany and

336
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:42,240
Imperial Japan, you would support the latter too?

337
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:46,720
Says the person with the hammer and sickle in their name again, because I said, because

338
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:51,360
I oppose the U S I would be supporting those becoming fascist to own the libs.

339
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:55,800
I swear to God, it turns out that like socialists, at least the ones that are more honest about

340
00:19:55,800 --> 00:20:00,360
the ideology understand that a socialist society is not the goal of socialism.

341
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:02,000
It's the destruction of liberalism.

342
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
That's it.

343
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:08,120
Socialism itself is just straight up unachievable, but it is the tool that they will use to dismantle

344
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:11,220
the liberal state and then bring in their totalitarianism.

345
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:14,200
I'm so fucking tired of the anti-tanky left.

346
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:17,200
They just pissed me the fuck off and annoy me to no end.

347
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:20,880
How dare you be against the worst societies in the history of the planet?

348
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:24,060
The Katyn massacre was literal Nazi war propaganda.

349
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:29,120
The Nazis revealed it an investigation by Poland and the USSR slash Russian Federation

350
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:32,760
later found there was less than a third, as many victims as initially reported, and they

351
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:35,000
were executed by German weapons.

352
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,480
Then why did the USSR admit that it happened?

353
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:45,640
Okay, so what it was was an ethnic cleansing of polls by the Soviets after Nazi Germany

354
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:47,960
and Soviet Russia cut Poland in half.

355
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:51,520
When the Nazis later invaded the Soviet Union, they discovered the atrocity and presented

356
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:52,720
it to the world.

357
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:57,160
And history has since shown that they presented it to the world accurately because after the

358
00:20:57,160 --> 00:21:01,720
Soviet Union fell, the Russians revealed evidence that yes, the Stalinists had indeed done it.

359
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:05,880
The Nazis were clearly guilty of their own crimes, but they presented this one accurately

360
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:10,520
and it is a common socialist talking point today to deny the Katyn massacre.

361
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:15,200
In fact, I think Vosch actually did it once a couple years ago, but I don't think he knew

362
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,200
what it was.

363
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:20,240
He just knew that leftists deny the Katyn massacre, so he was going to deny it.

364
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:22,560
I hope he's since changed his stance.

365
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:25,960
And this happened recently from Black Hammer Times.

366
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:30,840
Thanks to all of you, Black Hammer has successfully liberated 200 acres of land to build our city

367
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:33,080
for colonized people only.

368
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:36,520
We are located high up in the mountains, 10,000 feet in the air with rich soil.

369
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:40,400
We have one lake and three rivers on the land.

370
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:44,680
The Black Hammer Times are in fact a radical socialist group.

371
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:48,640
They've now, they've now purchased, presumably purchased this land and they're building a

372
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:51,840
commune and you know, good for them.

373
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:53,360
It's their choice to do what they want.

374
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:54,360
Go ahead.

375
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:57,280
But keep in mind, this is going to be a commune run by this guy.

376
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:59,280
Hello Antifa.

377
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:02,000
It's me, Ghazi.

378
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:06,800
The commander in chief of the Black Hammer organization.

379
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:07,800
Land back.

380
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:08,800
Land back.

381
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:09,800
Land back.

382
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:10,800
Land back.

383
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:16,480
I heard you had some not so nice things to say about me.

384
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:24,040
I heard you had some nice things to say about my hammers.

385
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:34,040
I heard you had not so nice things to do to one of my members, one of my dear, dear members,

386
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:38,720
an African Filipino mother that you doxxed and thought you could get away with it, thought

387
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:42,520
we were going to back down, thought we were going to take it.

388
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:45,360
No, that's not going to happen.

389
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:48,360
You messed with the wrong one this time.

390
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:49,360
Yes.

391
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:50,360
Oh yes you did.

392
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:51,360
Oh yes you did.

393
00:22:52,360 --> 00:23:03,360
Because we don't take it lightly when harm is done to our African colonized women.

394
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:11,360
And that's why at Black Hammer we say, touch one, touch all, touch one, touch all, touch

395
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:19,360
one, touch all, touch one, touch all, touch one, touch all, and you touched one of us.

396
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:25,360
So now you touched all of us and we're going to have to do something about it.

397
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:29,360
And with takes like this, didn't you call Anne Frank a colonizer?

398
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:30,360
She is.

399
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:36,360
You know how there's like a lot of hatred towards Jewish people from Black people, like

400
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:39,360
in very general terms, like the Louis Farrakhan types?

401
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:41,360
Yeah, that is the cloth these people are cut from.

402
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:45,360
Y'all going to, y'all whites going to keep asking us how we're going to keep ourselves

403
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:47,360
warm up in the mountains?

404
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:51,360
Y'all already know it just takes a good book to burn and some nice wood.

405
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:54,360
So they're going to burn Anne Frank's books to keep warm.

406
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:55,360
Holy fuck.

407
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:59,360
Colonizers have enslaved, genocided, ate, tortured, and oppressed us for centuries.

408
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:03,360
But get mad when we say we're going to burn a white girl's diary.

409
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:07,360
Sorry, but we don't share the same material reality with daughters of German imperialists

410
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:09,360
and armies that killed our people.

411
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:13,360
When your socialism is woke enough to murder the Jews.

412
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:14,360
Fuck.

413
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:19,360
This will be probably the most insane take in this entire video.

414
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:22,360
And it's going to be because there's actually a lot of it.

415
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:23,360
So let's, let's check this out.

416
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:24,360
Okay.

417
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:25,360
This is on Quora.

418
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:27,360
It's an answer to the question, what do communists want?

419
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:32,360
I want to stop having to be on the defensive against propaganda and liberal lies about

420
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:33,360
communism.

421
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:37,360
Anti communists regurgitate some cold war or Nazi propaganda about socialism always

422
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:39,360
failing, or Mao killed a gazillion people.

423
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:42,360
And somehow this is supposed to surprise, shock and deflate me.

424
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:43,360
Yeah.

425
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:47,360
You sound like the Nazi who, when he's told that there are 6 million Jews dead, he's

426
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,360
like, I know it's good.

427
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:50,360
Isn't it?

428
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:53,360
When I present actual facts that debunk the lies instead of them addressing my facts,

429
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:56,360
they call me a Stalin apologist, Holocaust denier, et cetera.

430
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:57,360
Who's being irrational.

431
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:00,360
Who's using the facts or am I supposed to just say, okay, thank you for enlightening

432
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:04,360
me with your capitalist propaganda and Russia phobic white nationalism.

433
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:07,360
Weren't the Russians white people don't want to cooperate.

434
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:11,360
You will have to use violence to stop those who resist having their riches nationalized.

435
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:14,360
You have to fill up the prisons with people who refuse to pay their taxes.

436
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:15,360
That's actually true.

437
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:19,360
If a bunch of insulin manufacturing executives take up arms to prevent the people from nationalizing

438
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:24,360
the industry and saving lives by bringing down the cost of insulin, then if violence

439
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:28,360
is used to resist their violence, why is this a moral problem for me?

440
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:29,360
Hold on.

441
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:30,360
Wait.

442
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:31,360
To resist.

443
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:32,360
No, no.

444
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:34,360
If violence is used to resist their, hold on.

445
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:36,360
You're the one using the, you're the one starting the violence here, man.

446
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:40,360
If a bunch of insulin manufacturing executives take up arms to prevent the people from nationalizing

447
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:42,360
the industry, listen, they own the business.

448
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:43,360
All right.

449
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:49,360
In preventing the people from nationalizing their industry, they are the ones on the defense.

450
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:54,360
If violence is used to resist their violence, which is already a resistance of my violence,

451
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:56,360
why is this a moral problem for me?

452
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:58,360
See, he has to phrase it as if he's on the defensive, but he's not.

453
00:25:58,360 --> 00:25:59,360
He's the aggressor.

454
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:01,360
I would enjoy smashing them.

455
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:02,360
It would mean justice is done.

456
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:06,360
Justice is done when we prevent people from who own their property from doing what they

457
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:07,360
like with it.

458
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:08,360
Yeah.

459
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:09,360
Yeah.

460
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:13,360
Justice requires that people can learn to be more pro-social and less selfish.

461
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:14,360
Just straight up propaganda.

462
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:15,360
All right.

463
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:17,360
No, I don't feel sorry for the kulaks.

464
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:20,360
They killed many families during their riots.

465
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:24,360
They slaughtered half the livestock used to farm the land.

466
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:27,360
They hid grain to speculate on prices, knowing people were suffering.

467
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:29,360
They probably hid grain to eat themselves, you fuck.

468
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:33,360
They encourage others to stop growing again, which would have made the famine worse.

469
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:34,360
They deserved it.

470
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:36,360
In this photo, Soviet workers found them hiding grain.

471
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:38,360
The kulaks deserve what they got.

472
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:44,360
So, if you own a farm and you want to, say, you know, own the means of production and

473
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:49,360
keep the produce of your labor, then you're a kulak.

474
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:53,360
Literally what socialists say they want before they take power after they take power.

475
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:56,360
If people actually have it, you're a fucking kulak.

476
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:58,360
Democracy stinks.

477
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:01,360
This guy's mask off about it.

478
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:04,360
Studies have shown there is no relationship between the public wants and policy enactment.

479
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:05,360
Zero.

480
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:06,360
Yeah.

481
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:07,360
Okay.

482
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:08,360
Not all the time, but sometimes.

483
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:10,360
American-style representative democracy is a farce.

484
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:11,360
The rich own the politicians.

485
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:16,360
At least in China, they have a functional and well-run government that plans the economy.

486
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:21,360
China only started becoming relevant when they liberalized and opened up.

487
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:22,360
And they're not even that liberal.

488
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:25,360
They just allowed some kind of liberal economics to take hold.

489
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:27,360
Human nature is communism.

490
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:32,360
Up until 12,000 years ago, humans lived as hunter-gatherers in communist societies.

491
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:35,360
Moneyless, stateless, and classless.

492
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:38,360
It sounds like you're a reactionary, my friend, trying to go back to the past.

493
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:41,360
Evolution has shaped us towards communism, not capitalism.

494
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:42,360
Not bullshit.

495
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:47,360
Again, I've talked about this before in the past, and there will probably be a much deeper video on the subject in the future,

496
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:50,360
but we are evolutionarily shaped towards liberalism, in fact.

497
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:56,360
There is a reason that we have a base understanding of property in our psychology that seems to be innate.

498
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:58,360
People have no understanding of communism.

499
00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:03,360
At the beginning of the movie, 2001, A Space Odyssey, the early humans wake up to find the monolith.

500
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:05,360
They nervously approach it, not sure what to make of it.

501
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:08,360
It fascinates them, so they get closer and poke it.

502
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:09,360
But then they cower away.

503
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:13,360
They are intrigued, terrified, fascinated, and mystified by it.

504
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:14,360
It is alien to them.

505
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:17,360
It is so beyond their range of comprehension.

506
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:18,360
It is literally beyond anything they could imagine.

507
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:19,360
It is alien.

508
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:21,360
They don't know what to make of it.

509
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:22,360
Their best guesses are not even close.

510
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:25,360
It is an entirely different paradigm.

511
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:28,360
It represents the next leap forward of human existence, and they don't know it.

512
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:32,360
I see this same phenomenon on how people approach communism.

513
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:33,360
There is no difference.

514
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:35,360
Communism is the monolith.

515
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:36,360
Hold on.

516
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:40,360
In the previous point, you said that communism was what we lived in.

517
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:41,360
It's our nature.

518
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:46,360
And now you're saying that it's this alien object that is completely not like us at all.

519
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:49,360
And moreover, you're worshipping it like a god.

520
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:54,360
This is some literal God is the State fascist shit here.

521
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:56,360
No, Joseph Stalin wasn't a monster.

522
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:58,360
No, he didn't cause the Holodomor.

523
00:28:58,360 --> 00:28:59,360
He didn't kill 60 million people.

524
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:01,360
He didn't become besties with Hitler.

525
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:03,360
The kulaks deserved it.

526
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:06,360
And the purges were not a cynical attempt by him to grab power.

527
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:09,360
The people voted for the purges and wanted them.

528
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:10,360
Hold on.

529
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:12,360
Didn't you just say that democracy was bad?

530
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:13,360
Wait.

531
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:14,360
Wait.

532
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:15,360
Wait.

533
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:16,360
Hold on.

534
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:17,360
I gotta parse this here.

535
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:18,360
Democracy bad.

536
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:20,360
That's what he said in a previous point.

537
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:28,360
But he also said democracy, people voted for purges, and purges good.

538
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:33,360
Like this guy contradicts his own points constantly in this.

539
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:35,360
Democracy bad unless they vote for what I want.

540
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:38,360
Holodomor isn't real, but the kulaks deserved it.

541
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:41,360
Communism is both the future and our ancient past.

542
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:42,360
Fuck, dude.

543
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:45,360
Mao and friends didn't kill a gazillion.

544
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:49,360
Mao and friends sounds like a Saturday morning cartoon show.

545
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:50,360
Fuck.

546
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:51,360
They didn't intentionally cause famines.

547
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:55,360
The overall majority of those who were killed by communists were traitors, saboteurs, Nazis,

548
00:29:56,360 --> 00:30:01,360
and class enemies hellbent on returning people to capitalist slavery.

549
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:06,360
I don't know what kind of warped reality you have to live in to think any of these things,

550
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:07,360
man.

551
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:08,360
To think that the Soviets were good.

552
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:10,360
To think that the Maoists were good.

553
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:12,360
Or the Cubans or the Venezuelans.

554
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:13,360
Like fuck me, dude.

555
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:15,360
Like, you've seen this meme before, right?

556
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:18,360
Where it's the Joker and it's like, you don't like capitalism, yet you exist.

557
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:21,360
iPhone, Venezuela, sometimes it's vuvuzela.

558
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:24,360
Bottom text, 100 billion dead.

559
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:28,360
Even like Shu On Head has said this in her videos at some point.

560
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:30,360
And it's amazing.

561
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:39,360
Like, imagine being a Nazi in 2021 and someone approaches you with the legitimate, obvious,

562
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:43,360
glaring problems in the fact that you're a Nazi, okay?

563
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:47,360
And then you say, lol, Germany, Jews, 6 million cookies baked.

564
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:52,360
The fact that you can memeify something does not actually refute that thing.

565
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:57,360
But that's something that people like Shu, the socialist millennials and zoomers don't

566
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:58,360
really understand.

567
00:30:58,360 --> 00:31:01,360
To them, memeifying is the same thing as refuting.

568
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:06,360
There seems to be this common attitude among these types of people where all sincerity

569
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:08,360
is run down by irony.

570
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:09,360
Cynicism rules the day.

571
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:13,360
And if you're hopeful or if you're building towards something or if you're happy or

572
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:17,360
you feel like you have your life on track, if you're grateful, if you have a sense

573
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:21,360
of duty, if you value love over casual sexual connection.

574
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:27,360
Any of these more esoteric qualities, these people would absolutely batter you with cynicism.

575
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:29,360
And fair enough, cynical humor is pretty funny.

576
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:34,360
But I really do think this too cool for school, I'm a cynic about everything, fedora tipping

577
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:40,360
atheist edgelord nonsense has defined a lot of their politics as well as their emotional

578
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:41,360
state.

579
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:43,360
Probably why all the atheist YouTubers became socialists in the end.

580
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:46,360
And of course, this is what these people are, guys.

581
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:49,360
Reddit's r slash socialism survey.

582
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:54,360
48% unemployed, 61% live with their parents, 14% support free speech.

583
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:55,360
Is anyone surprised?

584
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:59,360
Now, like, I'm not going to shit on people if they're unemployed, it can be hard to

585
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:00,360
get a job.

586
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:02,360
I'm not going to show them if they're living with their parents.

587
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:04,360
Sometimes it's hard to get started in life.

588
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:07,360
Or maybe you're saving money so that you can actually go and do something big with

589
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:08,360
it.

590
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:11,360
But the free speech thing, that's pretty unacceptable, isn't it?

591
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:15,360
The stereotype of leftists and socialists on the right wing is one of spoiled losers unemployed

592
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:19,360
listless with no regard for economics or the law.

593
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:21,360
But just how true is the stereotype?

594
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:25,360
According to a public survey on Reddit's r slash socialism board, it's painfully

595
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:26,360
accurate.

596
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:30,360
According to the survey, in which the results were self-admitted by the predominantly leftist

597
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:35,360
users of the board, 48% of the young socialists are unemployed and a stratospherically high

598
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:38,360
number of 61% still live with their parents.

599
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:43,360
Furthermore, the results found that 69% of the board's users were uneducated, 46% support

600
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:48,360
violent riots, and just 14% support the constitutional definition of unlimited free speech.

601
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:52,360
This is not the first time that documentation of leftists being losers has been confirmed

602
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:57,360
as a study of Antifa activists in Europe confirmed that 9 out of 10 leftist protesters still

603
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:58,360
live with their parents.

604
00:32:58,360 --> 00:33:04,360
Alright, uh, obvious bias of this article being left aside for a minute.

605
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:07,360
It is funny to see this sort of thing get confirmed, isn't it?

606
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:09,360
Again, I do have some sympathy for them.

607
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:12,360
There is a difference between the guy who lives at home because he's taking care of

608
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:15,360
his parents, or his parents live 15 minutes away from the university and he's going

609
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:18,360
to school and it's just cheaper to stay there, or if he's saving up money to move

610
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:23,360
away or launch a business or go to school or buy his own place, you know, whatever.

611
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:27,360
There are reasons to do this stuff, but I don't have much sympathy for people who

612
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:32,360
just sit around and waste what little money they have on, on booze or drugs or worthless

613
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:35,360
shit that doesn't help them get ahead and then complain that they're still living

614
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:36,360
at their parents.

615
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:38,360
You make choices, you have to live with them.

616
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:40,360
I will say these people generally do have good intentions.

617
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:45,360
They believe that their ideas, as idealistic and utopian as they are, they can make everyone

618
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:47,360
equal and eliminate all injustice.

619
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:50,360
The eliminate all injustice stuff is good, even though it's unobtainable.

620
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:52,360
The making everyone equal stuff isn't good.

621
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:56,360
As long as there are differences in the quality and quantity of production, there will always

622
00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:57,360
be inequality.

623
00:33:57,360 --> 00:34:00,360
Trying to make everyone equal is actually not a good idea.

624
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:01,360
It's a bad idea.

625
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:03,360
But on the surface level, I can see why it's appealing to some people.

626
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:07,360
You know, you don't want there to be racism or sexism, so fair enough.

627
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:11,360
But the problem with them is that they're idealistic and utopian, even the good things

628
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:12,360
that they want to do.

629
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:16,360
And in my opinion, there's not much good, but even the good things that they want to

630
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:18,360
do, they cannot actually accomplish.

631
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:22,360
The libertarian socialists cannot actually do what they want to do without becoming the

632
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:24,360
tankies they claim to despise.

633
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:28,360
But the worst part of all is when they see people who disagree with them, whether that

634
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:33,360
be conservatives or liberals or even fascists, but you know, they have their own problems.

635
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:38,360
The socialists get very angry because from their point of view, they're working to save

636
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:41,360
the world and they can't understand why no one else wants to save it with them.

637
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:45,360
So they just look at everyone and say that they're hateful or they're bigoted or they

638
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:46,360
want people to be oppressed.

639
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:50,360
And the actual answer is that most people who are liberals and who are conservatives,

640
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:52,360
they're realists who want freedom.

641
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:56,360
And they understand that freedom and equality are somewhat incompatible because if you allow

642
00:34:56,360 --> 00:35:01,360
people to simply be free and do what they want, they will act in an unequal manner.

643
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:07,360
And you end up with socialists outright despising non socialists because they think they're evil.

644
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:11,360
They think they're on a glorious crusade to save human civilization from itself.

645
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:15,360
And that is how you get to all of the examples I've shown you today from the intersectionalists

646
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:19,360
talking about class war and class conflict to the socialists who decry the Stalinists

647
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:23,360
simply because they have not yet allowed their ideas to come to their natural end.

648
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:27,360
And the Stalinists themselves for being the fascist pieces of shit that they actually are.

649
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:32,360
This is why people say that the radical left is good while the radical right is bad.

650
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:38,360
That the radical left simply means extreme equality for everyone, even though that would actually be bad.

651
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:41,360
And the radical right wants to eradicate everyone who's not them.

652
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:46,360
But from the radical right's point of view, they just want extreme freedom for everyone.

653
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:49,360
And they view the radical left as wanting to eradicate everyone who's not them.

654
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:51,360
As always, the truth is somewhere in the middle.

655
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:56,360
If you don't think that both extreme ends of the spectrum have a taste for genocide,

656
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:58,360
you have to be historically ignorant.

657
00:35:58,360 --> 00:36:03,360
But at the same time, there are well-meaning leftists out there who simply want people to be cared for.

658
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:07,360
And there are well-meaning rightists out there who simply want people to be left alone.

659
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:13,360
I think, to your average person, the rightist position seems less harmful overall

660
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:15,360
because if you're left alone, well then you're just left alone.

661
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:19,360
You might suffer, you might not suffer, but at the very least the situation will be in your hands.

662
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:25,360
Meanwhile, the goals of the moderate leftist requires a lot more centralized control to actually do the caring.

663
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:27,360
So when things go wrong, they go wrong for everyone.

664
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:32,360
I think this might be the core reason why a lot of moderate leftists sometimes carry water for the tankies.

665
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:39,360
While in my experience anyway, it's somewhat rare that the free marketeers carry water for the imperialists and the monarchists.

666
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:42,360
But that is the champagne socialist in a nutshell.

667
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:50,360
Sometimes good people with sometimes good intentions who will ultimately be discarded if a socialist revolution ever actually happens.

668
00:36:50,360 --> 00:37:00,360
And just in case you think that might actually happen someday, I'll leave you with this fun video of a Democratic Socialist of America meeting on April 14th, 2021.

669
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:04,360
These people ain't ever getting shit done, guys. Don't worry about it.

670
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:13,360
If we want to defeat capitalism, we are going to need a party that will organize working people to fight for the demands that we want and to win socialism.

671
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:14,360
Thank you so much.

672
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:17,360
Quick point of privilege. Quick point of personal privilege.

673
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:21,360
Guys, first of all, James Jackson, Sacramento, he him.

674
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:24,360
I just want to say, can we please keep the chatter to a minimum?

675
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:27,360
I'm one of the people who's very, very prone to sensory overload.

676
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:29,360
There's a lot of whispering and chatter going on.

677
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:31,360
It's making it very difficult for me to focus.

678
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:36,360
Please, can we just, I know we're all fresh and ready to go, but can we please just keep the chatter to a minimum?

679
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:38,360
It's affecting my ability to focus. Thank you.

680
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:39,360
Thank you, comrade.

681
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:42,360
Okay, is there a speaker against name, chapter, pronoun?

682
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:44,360
Point of personal privilege. Point of personal privilege.

683
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:45,360
Yes.

684
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:50,360
Please do not use gendered language to address everyone.

685
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:53,360
Okay.
