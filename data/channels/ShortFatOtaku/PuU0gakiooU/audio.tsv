0	8200	Good morning gamers!
8200	11520	Yes it's true, I've been gone for a little bit, and yes it's true, I'm back!
11520	15640	I have been working on some rather large projects that I hope one day will in fact see the light
15640	16640	of day.
16640	19120	For those of you who actually watch my streams, you know what I'm talking about, because
19120	21960	I've described them in a bit more detail over there, and if you haven't, what's
21960	22960	wrong with you?
22960	25560	I'll talk a bit more about them tonight on stream again, in case you wanted to ask
25560	28040	some questions or hear about it or whatever.
28040	34120	But today we are talking about champagne socialists, bougie communists, the people
34120	38560	who say eat the rich even though they are the rich that will inevitably be eaten.
38560	42680	Now of course in one of my more recent videos, we talked about Black Lives Matter leader
42680	48760	Patrisse Khan Cullors, and how despite her Marxism, her equality above all rhetoric,
48760	52860	she's raking in the cash and buying four separate homes.
52860	54940	Well, let's listen to her talk about it.
82860	88980	Sure, and I think that is a critique that is wanting.
88980	97420	And I say that because the way that I live my life is in direct support to Black people,
97420	101260	including my Black family members, first and foremost.
101260	109060	And for so many Black folks who are able to invest in themselves and their community,
109060	112940	they choose to invest in their family, and that's what I've chosen to do.
112940	118060	I have a child, I have a brother that has severe mental illness that I take care of,
118060	122820	I support my mother, and I support many other family members of mine.
122820	131620	And so I see my money as not my own, I see it as my family's money as well.
131620	132960	Pretty incredible, eh?
132960	139040	Is that all it takes to make this massive wealth accumulation acceptable within a Marxist
139040	140040	lens?
140040	145800	So every billionaire, every dirty, rotten capitalist who is raking in the dough hand
145800	151080	over fist, if they're doing it for their families, if they're taking care of their families,
151080	152200	it's okay.
152200	153280	Is that what I'm hearing here?
153280	157880	Or maybe it's because her family is Black, and therefore she can say that by taking care
157880	160960	of her family, she is taking care of Black people.
160960	164640	If you're looking at it through a race lens, I guess that makes sense, but it's still pretty
164640	165700	disgusting, eh?
165700	170620	Of course the actual truth is, it does not betray Marxist principles in practice because
170620	175980	it is exactly what every single Marxist leader has ever done throughout the entire history
175980	177340	of Marxism.
177340	181380	And yes, there will be idiots on the left who will look at this and say, this isn't
181380	186340	a leftist problem, this is a liberal problem, she's a rad lib, intersectionality and identity
186340	188180	politics, that's rad lib shit.
188180	190620	Yeah, I'm not convinced of that.
190620	195580	I was at the publications table today, and I was speaking to this young person from Arizona
195580	203700	who's trying to fight SB 1070, and he grabbed a book, and he said, it's like Mal's red book.
203700	208500	And I was like, man, that's what I was thinking, and it was just really cool to hear him make
208500	209500	that connection.
209500	215420	And I was like, how about you buy 10 to 15 of these books, and you all have a youth organizing
215420	219760	group where you talk about it, and you really try to engage this, and we can just kind of,
219760	222880	we need to build off of this.
222880	227840	No liberal would ever compare their writing to Mao's little red book.
227840	230880	That is the rhetoric of a socialist revolutionary.
230880	236120	Moreover, I like how she just says, yeah, just, you know, buy 10, 15 of those books,
236120	239640	why don't you pay for my houses, poor people?
239640	240640	Here's what I mean, though.
240640	241920	Look at this person's bio.
241920	248800	Yeah, it's cancerous, but this is what a leftist would say is a liberal bio, is a rad lib bio.
248800	251720	Nothing in here talks about class conflict or class struggle.
251720	257200	Nothing in here talks about Marxism or socialism or communism, it is all idpol.
257200	262520	And yet, hot take, the rural white America that left-wing people flirt so much with loving
262520	264420	is a bunch of landlords.
264420	270000	They are far, far more repulsive than the professional managerial class that is so hated,
270000	273600	and the fact that they are not identified as class enemies is a failure.
273600	278480	Like you want to invoke Mao, liquidate white farmers and hand their land over to the Latin
278480	282760	next farm workers and convert it back to native land directly.
282760	284260	These are not liberal positions.
284260	289100	In fact, as contradictory as it might sound on the face of it, these are bourgeois socialist
289100	290160	opinions.
290160	295240	This is literally kill the kulaks rhetoric, kill the poor who refuse to revolt with us.
295240	296240	Remember new guy?
296240	301680	Well, here's Mallory Jessica Yoshida's person who drew that comic and who still a year and
301680	303740	a half later has not gotten over it.
303740	307800	She has no empathy for the wealthy and wants to steal from the rich.
308120	310760	You gotta pay quite a bit to live in Seattle, but fine.
310760	314480	Howdy, I'm the weird and dorky cartoonist behind Nightmare Girls.
314480	315560	Money please!
315560	318280	It is great when they just get straight to the point, isn't it?
318280	320040	Give me what you have.
320040	321040	That's all it is.
321040	326840	Beneath, you know what, I think beneath most socialist activism is just egoism in the end.
326840	332920	When supplies of drugs run low, drug prices mysteriously rise, data shows.
332920	336560	And the less competition, the higher the price hikes.
336560	340380	This can't be a real article, I mean I know it's on Ars Technica, but you have to be
340380	344420	ignorant of all economics to be surprised at this, right?
344420	352560	When nearly 100 drugs became scarce between 2015 and 2016, their prices mysteriously increased
352560	355780	more than twice as fast as their expected rate.
355780	360260	An analysis recently published reveals the price hikes were highest if the pharmaceutical
360260	364000	companies behind the drugs had little competition.
364000	364500	Are-
369500	371240	Literally Econ 101.
371240	374060	Wha- how is this happening?
374060	376600	No one's competing with these guys?
376600	377600	Supplies running out?
377600	378640	Why are the prices going up?
378640	380520	This happened here in Canada last summer.
380520	385200	The vandalism of a Nazi monument in Ontario is being investigated as a hate crime.
385200	388080	Oh jeez, we have Nazi monuments here apparently.
388080	392200	A monument in Oakville Ontario commemorating those who served under Adolf Hitler in the
392200	396640	14th SS division was recently graffitied with the words Nazi war monument.
396640	400400	The incident which police say appeared to target an identifiable group is being investigated
400400	402320	as a hate-motivated crime.
402320	407760	I guess if the legal definition of hate-motivated crime is targeting an identifiable group,
407760	410440	SS officers is an identifiable group.
410440	412480	But here's the actual situation.
412480	417480	Someone painted Nazi war monument on a stone cenotaph located in Oakville in the Saint
417480	419960	Volodymyr Ukrainian cemetery.
419960	425300	Oakville has a large population of Ukrainian immigrants and refugees, and the 14th SS division
425300	428360	was made up of Ukrainians who pledged allegiance to Hitler.
428360	431560	Some members of the division have been accused of killing Polish women and children as well
431560	433680	as Jews during the second world war.
433680	434840	So fair enough.
434840	438920	Countries like Ukraine and Poland and others, who have historically found themselves between
438920	442760	a rock and a hard place, with the Russians and the Germans on either side, probably did
442760	444960	have some people who ended up doing this stuff.
444960	448560	And you know, even though this is part of some Ukrainian cultural heritage, maybe we
448560	450760	shouldn't be doing this sort of stuff in Canada, eh?
450760	455160	Of course it might be the case that the reason that the 14th SS division is memorialized
455160	460360	in places like Canada is not because they were actually the 14th SS division.
460360	461940	They were at one point.
461940	466180	The actual history of the division is that it was one of the only divisions that was
466180	471080	not found guilty of any wrongdoing during the second world war at the Nuremberg trials.
471080	476640	Additionally, a lot of the individuals involved were forced into service, and as the Nazis
476640	481520	began to lose the war, large parts of the unit started working for the Ukrainian Insurgent
481520	486440	Army, which was a paramilitary organization that fought during World War II against the
486440	489720	Soviet Union, Communist Poland, as well as Nazi Germany.
489720	495860	And in the wars last year, the entire 14th SS division abandoned Germany and became the
495860	498060	first Ukrainian division.
498060	502200	In other words, it's not as simple as saying that these people were Nazis and that was
502200	503200	that.
503200	506520	A large number of veterans from this division did in fact move to Canada and end up in Oakville,
506520	508680	but they were all vetted by the Canadian government.
508680	511280	And as best as we can tell, they seem to be innocent.
511280	516400	Of course, if you're a brain dead bougie communist, you're just going to spray paint Nazi war
516400	518120	monument and leave it at that.
518120	522880	In much the same way, when Canada began building a memorial to the victims of communism, of
522880	526340	course these same people will spray paint on it, communism will win.
526340	530720	The best part about this is that it's not even denying the victims of communism.
530720	534860	It's not denying the fact that they were victims, that they got liquidated, that they were put
534860	536800	in camps and mass and killed.
536800	540260	It's simply saying, yeah, no, communism is going to win anyway.
540260	542820	We will kill all these people and it's not going to be a problem because we're going
542820	543820	to win.
543820	544820	Like, holy shit.
544820	545820	It's one thing to deny atrocities.
545820	548380	It's another thing entirely to say those atrocities were good.
548380	551940	And you can find this image anywhere, but this particular one that I'm looking at is
551940	558420	on r slash America's Socialists, a pro socialist subreddit.
558420	561100	And check out some of the comments under this image.
561100	562220	You people are absolute scum.
562220	565340	I have a few Romanian construction worker friends that would love to enlighten you about
565340	569560	life under communism, a naive consumer of heartbreaking stories.
569560	573700	They're all innocent victims of communism, but if you check most of their stories, the
573700	575340	reality is quite different.
575340	580740	I personally checked more than one such story and all of these innocent victims can either
580740	583620	be murderers or Nazi collaborators.
583620	587200	Canada sheltered thousands of Nazi criminals after world war II.
587200	592200	The descendants of these scum built such memorials with impunity and invent millions of victims
592200	593320	of communism.
593320	596200	I like how you can't be a liberal and oppose communism.
596200	598480	If you oppose communism, you have to be a fascist.
598480	605360	These people do not understand why normal, everyday, nonpolitical, unaligned people oppose
605360	606360	them.
606360	607360	And I'm sure you guys remember this too.
607360	612520	A same energy where a us cadet who wore a Che Guevara t-shirt underneath his uniform
612520	616720	and had communism will win in his hat got completely expelled.
616720	619720	I think he, I think he first ruined his life after doing a quick search.
619720	624920	This image took place in a back in 2018, he hasn't really done anything since.
624920	628640	He just retweets a bunch of lefties on Twitter, but he isn't, he doesn't seem to be doing
628640	631000	anything in any political space.
631000	632000	Good job, dude.
632000	633000	You did it.
633000	634000	You beat capitalism.
634000	636880	But of course the best takes come from a tanky collective.
636880	641340	DM this guy, any cursed tanky takes you might find here, I'll give you a lightning round
641340	642760	of these ridiculous takes.
642760	646800	What the hell kind of socialist rejects and demonizes Stalin.
646800	650840	Imagine playing teacher's pet to the bourgeoisie, lapping up their propaganda and slander against
650840	653440	one of the greatest revolutionary thinkers and leaders of all time.
653440	655120	Oh, I'm one of the good socialists.
655120	656740	I hate Stalin.
656740	658840	Imagine standing for Hitler.
658840	661080	That is the level that we're talking about here.
661080	665780	The US is more authoritarian than China ever will be.
665780	667400	Fucking incredible, dude.
667400	668720	Are we exterminating the Uyghurs?
668720	670660	Do we have a social credit system?
670660	675920	And speaking of the Uyghurs, it's better to be Uyghurs because Uyghurs don't, Uyghurs
675920	680400	doesn't suffer any repression unlike our Palestinian comrades.
680400	681400	That's how it is, eh?
681400	685520	You just define oppression as something that only non-socialist countries can do.
685520	691000	There's a fellow on Twitter named Besfort, reactionary, so you're just a filthy communist?
691000	692760	Me, yes, thank you very much.
692760	696920	Turns out Besfort is the founder and CEO of a company.
696920	700200	You're not much of a communist, are you?
700200	702120	Hammer and sickle and name.
702120	705880	In that case, fascism is based.
705880	706880	What is?
706880	707880	What?
707880	712640	Oh, he's referring to red fascists, otherwise known as the Soviets.
712640	716640	It was the Kuomintang who did little to defeat the Japanese.
716640	719380	They chose to fight the communists who were fighting the Japanese.
719380	721400	As a result, the communists became more popular.
721400	724880	They won the war in China and I'm using their flag, you fucking Maoist.
724880	730940	So the Kuomintang ended up becoming the Taiwan liberal government and before World War II,
730940	734360	the nationalists were fighting the communists in a civil war in China.
734360	738480	They basically set aside their civil war when the Japanese invaded and then resumed
738480	740600	it after World War II was over.
740600	744880	It's true that the Chinese nationalists viewed the communists as the worst threat compared
744880	745880	to the Japanese.
745880	746880	And guess what?
746880	747880	They were right.
747880	751480	And yes, they do think that red fascism is good.
751480	755800	Wow, I don't even know how to present this to you.
755800	757380	There's no jokes that can be made.
757380	759720	There's no like lightheartedness here.
759720	762200	It's just, they're just open about it.
762200	768120	And dude, I already dealt with time traveling famines and forest massacres.
768120	771920	Now I got to deal with time traveling forged documents.
771920	775800	There's a lot of Nazisploitation fiction that has time traveling in it, right?
775800	780720	Along with vampires and werewolves and robots and hidden moon bases and shit.
780720	785000	People in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, otherwise known as North Korea,
785000	789560	have a better standard of living than many in the US and other Western nations.
789560	792200	Stop repeating imperialist bullshit.
792200	797400	If you were living in North Korea, you would not even have the crab in your avatar to eat.
797400	799480	Get the difference yet, Vosch?
799480	802320	Nazis started the Holocaust and communists ended the Holocaust.
802320	807460	I can't believe I have to come to Vosch's defense here because he is at least nominally
807460	808460	anti-tanky.
808460	813680	But yeah, I'm not going to be pro Nazi collaborator or pro Gulag, thank you very much.
813680	821800	Plus this guy here, this guy that he used as the Nazi image, he ended up being an embarrassment
821800	827000	to the Nazi party because he was considered to be the exemplar of the Aryan race.
827000	830880	And yet he was like one quarter or one eighth Jewish, it turned out later.
830880	836360	Rural voters are incredibly stupid, incredibly racist, incredibly evangelical, or incredibly
836360	837640	fascist.
837640	838820	Often all four.
838820	844860	This is literally just socialist moves to the city to pay $5,000 for a one room apartment
844860	845860	and hates his hometown.
845860	851000	And here's the reply he got, no poverty stricken underfunded areas aren't as educated or up
851000	853020	to moral code as I think they should be.
853020	854020	Let's leave them to suffer.
854020	858660	And he said, if it were up to me, their suffering would not be the result of indifference, but
858660	861020	direct action.
861020	863340	Socialists hate the poor.
863340	866300	Nazi death camps are bad and Soviet gulags are good.
866300	869740	Fuck, do we need to go any further?
869740	873660	I was hoping this video would be kind of funny, maybe we can have some laughs, make some jokes.
873660	878460	We've had a couple jokes so far, but I'm just stunned.
878460	883260	I'm stunned at leftist communists and the shit that they say.
883260	887600	Your reminder, today is delete Facebook day because Zuckerberg will favor Donald Trump's
887600	890320	freedom of speech over democracy.
890320	891320	He's out of office.
891320	892860	He's been out of office for six months.
892860	896540	Is this going to be like rent free and leftist heads for a while?
896540	901020	Is Donald Trump going to be the political equivalent of that one girl that got away?
901020	906360	So your family suffered under quote unquote communism.
906360	907980	Why should I care?
907980	908980	Look at this smug motherfucker.
908980	910220	Do you even need to play the video?
910220	911220	Look at this guy.
911220	914420	Yeah, I don't care if my politics killed your family members.
914420	915420	What's that?
915420	920100	Is that the sound of me losing the whole ass moral high ground when it comes to slavery?
920100	925420	How could you have lived through 2020 and not become a communist based fucking Tina
925420	926420	here?
926420	927660	I've been following her on Twitter for a while.
927660	934420	She's great because my morgue only has a capacity of 2,500 bodies, but COVID yeah, we never
934420	935700	reach capacity.
935700	939000	It's always incredible when people working in healthcare, working in science come out
939000	943660	and completely debunk everything regarding the mainstream media narrative victims of
943660	949040	communism Memorial foundation adds a global coronavirus deaths to its tally of historical
949040	954440	victims of communism.
954440	958480	The victims of communism Memorial foundation is officially recognizing global coronavirus
958480	962240	deaths as the fault of the Chinese government and adding them to its tally of historical
962240	966160	victims of communism, the organization announced on Friday.
966160	972020	You know, if commies are going to do this really stupid song and dance of blaming like
972020	978880	people who die of starvation on say capitalism, which is dumb for a thousand fucking reasons,
978880	982780	but if they're going to do that, then he, I guess this makes sense.
982780	985120	Let's watch the advancement of a character arc.
985120	986120	Okay.
986120	992920	From DSA racist, I actually, I actually kind of know this guy.
992920	996800	He has been hating on me on and off for fucking years.
996800	1001720	Vash is one of the most badly read, terribly spoken, incoherent bread tubers out there.
1001720	1005400	I wouldn't trust the leftism of a single one of his followers.
1005400	1006400	I mean, fair enough.
1006400	1007840	He that that's true.
1007840	1011640	But we're now into real leftist versus rad lib territory.
1011640	1017480	And our friend e-boy neat is taking up the position that the bread tubers are rad libs
1017480	1018760	actually in he's.
1018760	1019920	He is the real leftist.
1019920	1020920	Okay.
1020920	1022080	Well let's see what this real leftism is.
1022080	1027500	The Uyghur genocide is a CIA manufactured myth pushed by the national endowment for
1027500	1031120	democracy, which is a us state department slush fund.
1031120	1037040	I swear to God, you know how like the right wing has, has the Q Anon cultists who are
1037040	1039800	really believing some wild ass out there shit.
1039800	1045180	I have a feeling the CIA is that same kind of thing to, to the radical leftists who are
1045180	1047780	believing wild ass out there shit.
1047780	1055480	Not only was there no cultural genocide, Tiananmen square was a CIA operation too.
1055480	1056480	Fuck it.
1056480	1057480	I'm done with theatrics.
1057480	1058480	You know what?
1058480	1064260	Genocide good.
1064260	1067660	Real leftism is when genocide good.
1067660	1068660	Holy fuck.
1068660	1069660	Oh yeah.
1069660	1073100	This is the thing that I mentioned on Adam and such as show a couple of days ago.
1073100	1074380	It turns out it wasn't a Twitter post.
1074380	1078740	It was actually a Reddit post, but somebody posted on, um, on Contra points as subreddit
1078740	1079740	is Contra.
1079740	1080740	Okay.
1080740	1084920	And then the, uh, the post is removed, but it has to do with how Contra has been looking
1084920	1086660	on camera recently.
1086660	1089700	Those of you who don't know she has a drug problem and some of the things going on and
1089700	1092740	Contra says, that's my hair growing back in.
1092740	1097100	I guess 4chan wouldn't know about that cause they can't afford that all.
1097100	1103060	What she's referring here to here specifically is how there is a 4chan board for trans people,
1103060	1107500	which is, it can be a little bit insular and a little bit out there to be honest, but a
1107500	1111620	lot of the trans people that are quite poor and can't afford a lot of the various surgeries
1111620	1114420	and um, and things that are involved in transitioning.
1114420	1121140	And so here is a Contra points making fun of poor 4chan trannies who can't afford to
1121140	1123220	do the things that they want to do.
1123220	1124940	Fuck me, dude.
1124940	1128660	Like I've been called a transphobic before.
1128660	1129980	I don't think I am.
1129980	1134200	There are certainly things that I don't understand about the whole, the whole trans situation,
1134200	1137020	but I try my best to at least learn about them.
1137020	1141380	Um, and I'm also as polite as I can be whenever possible because there's no reason not to
1141380	1142920	be right.
1142920	1147700	But fuck, I wouldn't make fun of somebody because they can't afford to transition.
1147700	1149220	Like what, what the fuck?
1149220	1154180	When people, people call Contra points a rad lib, like she's not a true leftist.
1154180	1158340	It seems like whenever we find like a person who's like, no, I'm a real leftist, I'm actually
1158340	1160660	a socialist, I'm not a rad lib.
1160660	1164720	And then they say like one ridiculous thing and then suddenly they're cast out as a rad
1164720	1168300	lib, but that's everybody, that's everybody in the movement.
1168300	1174600	They're all that the U S is worse than Nazi Germany.
1174600	1178640	So if it were world war II right now in the U S we're fighting against Nazi Germany and
1178640	1182240	Imperial Japan, you would support the latter too?
1182240	1186720	Says the person with the hammer and sickle in their name again, because I said, because
1186720	1191360	I oppose the U S I would be supporting those becoming fascist to own the libs.
1191360	1195800	I swear to God, it turns out that like socialists, at least the ones that are more honest about
1195800	1200360	the ideology understand that a socialist society is not the goal of socialism.
1200360	1202000	It's the destruction of liberalism.
1202000	1203000	That's it.
1203000	1208120	Socialism itself is just straight up unachievable, but it is the tool that they will use to dismantle
1208120	1211220	the liberal state and then bring in their totalitarianism.
1211220	1214200	I'm so fucking tired of the anti-tanky left.
1214200	1217200	They just pissed me the fuck off and annoy me to no end.
1217200	1220880	How dare you be against the worst societies in the history of the planet?
1220880	1224060	The Katyn massacre was literal Nazi war propaganda.
1224060	1229120	The Nazis revealed it an investigation by Poland and the USSR slash Russian Federation
1229120	1232760	later found there was less than a third, as many victims as initially reported, and they
1232760	1235000	were executed by German weapons.
1235000	1237480	Then why did the USSR admit that it happened?
1237480	1245640	Okay, so what it was was an ethnic cleansing of polls by the Soviets after Nazi Germany
1245640	1247960	and Soviet Russia cut Poland in half.
1247960	1251520	When the Nazis later invaded the Soviet Union, they discovered the atrocity and presented
1251520	1252720	it to the world.
1252720	1257160	And history has since shown that they presented it to the world accurately because after the
1257160	1261720	Soviet Union fell, the Russians revealed evidence that yes, the Stalinists had indeed done it.
1261720	1265880	The Nazis were clearly guilty of their own crimes, but they presented this one accurately
1265880	1270520	and it is a common socialist talking point today to deny the Katyn massacre.
1270520	1275200	In fact, I think Vosch actually did it once a couple years ago, but I don't think he knew
1275200	1276200	what it was.
1276200	1280240	He just knew that leftists deny the Katyn massacre, so he was going to deny it.
1280240	1282560	I hope he's since changed his stance.
1282560	1285960	And this happened recently from Black Hammer Times.
1285960	1290840	Thanks to all of you, Black Hammer has successfully liberated 200 acres of land to build our city
1290840	1293080	for colonized people only.
1293080	1296520	We are located high up in the mountains, 10,000 feet in the air with rich soil.
1296520	1300400	We have one lake and three rivers on the land.
1300400	1304680	The Black Hammer Times are in fact a radical socialist group.
1304680	1308640	They've now, they've now purchased, presumably purchased this land and they're building a
1308640	1311840	commune and you know, good for them.
1311840	1313360	It's their choice to do what they want.
1313360	1314360	Go ahead.
1314360	1317280	But keep in mind, this is going to be a commune run by this guy.
1317280	1319280	Hello Antifa.
1319280	1322000	It's me, Ghazi.
1322000	1326800	The commander in chief of the Black Hammer organization.
1326800	1327800	Land back.
1327800	1328800	Land back.
1328800	1329800	Land back.
1329800	1330800	Land back.
1330800	1336480	I heard you had some not so nice things to say about me.
1336480	1344040	I heard you had some nice things to say about my hammers.
1344040	1354040	I heard you had not so nice things to do to one of my members, one of my dear, dear members,
1354040	1358720	an African Filipino mother that you doxxed and thought you could get away with it, thought
1358720	1362520	we were going to back down, thought we were going to take it.
1362520	1365360	No, that's not going to happen.
1365360	1368360	You messed with the wrong one this time.
1368360	1369360	Yes.
1369360	1370360	Oh yes you did.
1370360	1371360	Oh yes you did.
1372360	1383360	Because we don't take it lightly when harm is done to our African colonized women.
1383360	1391360	And that's why at Black Hammer we say, touch one, touch all, touch one, touch all, touch
1391360	1399360	one, touch all, touch one, touch all, touch one, touch all, and you touched one of us.
1399360	1405360	So now you touched all of us and we're going to have to do something about it.
1405360	1409360	And with takes like this, didn't you call Anne Frank a colonizer?
1409360	1410360	She is.
1410360	1416360	You know how there's like a lot of hatred towards Jewish people from Black people, like
1416360	1419360	in very general terms, like the Louis Farrakhan types?
1419360	1421360	Yeah, that is the cloth these people are cut from.
1421360	1425360	Y'all going to, y'all whites going to keep asking us how we're going to keep ourselves
1425360	1427360	warm up in the mountains?
1427360	1431360	Y'all already know it just takes a good book to burn and some nice wood.
1431360	1434360	So they're going to burn Anne Frank's books to keep warm.
1434360	1435360	Holy fuck.
1435360	1439360	Colonizers have enslaved, genocided, ate, tortured, and oppressed us for centuries.
1439360	1443360	But get mad when we say we're going to burn a white girl's diary.
1443360	1447360	Sorry, but we don't share the same material reality with daughters of German imperialists
1447360	1449360	and armies that killed our people.
1449360	1453360	When your socialism is woke enough to murder the Jews.
1453360	1454360	Fuck.
1454360	1459360	This will be probably the most insane take in this entire video.
1459360	1462360	And it's going to be because there's actually a lot of it.
1462360	1463360	So let's, let's check this out.
1463360	1464360	Okay.
1464360	1465360	This is on Quora.
1465360	1467360	It's an answer to the question, what do communists want?
1467360	1472360	I want to stop having to be on the defensive against propaganda and liberal lies about
1472360	1473360	communism.
1473360	1477360	Anti communists regurgitate some cold war or Nazi propaganda about socialism always
1477360	1479360	failing, or Mao killed a gazillion people.
1479360	1482360	And somehow this is supposed to surprise, shock and deflate me.
1482360	1483360	Yeah.
1483360	1487360	You sound like the Nazi who, when he's told that there are 6 million Jews dead, he's
1487360	1489360	like, I know it's good.
1489360	1490360	Isn't it?
1490360	1493360	When I present actual facts that debunk the lies instead of them addressing my facts,
1493360	1496360	they call me a Stalin apologist, Holocaust denier, et cetera.
1496360	1497360	Who's being irrational.
1497360	1500360	Who's using the facts or am I supposed to just say, okay, thank you for enlightening
1500360	1504360	me with your capitalist propaganda and Russia phobic white nationalism.
1504360	1507360	Weren't the Russians white people don't want to cooperate.
1507360	1511360	You will have to use violence to stop those who resist having their riches nationalized.
1511360	1514360	You have to fill up the prisons with people who refuse to pay their taxes.
1514360	1515360	That's actually true.
1515360	1519360	If a bunch of insulin manufacturing executives take up arms to prevent the people from nationalizing
1519360	1524360	the industry and saving lives by bringing down the cost of insulin, then if violence
1524360	1528360	is used to resist their violence, why is this a moral problem for me?
1528360	1529360	Hold on.
1529360	1530360	Wait.
1530360	1531360	To resist.
1531360	1532360	No, no.
1532360	1534360	If violence is used to resist their, hold on.
1534360	1536360	You're the one using the, you're the one starting the violence here, man.
1536360	1540360	If a bunch of insulin manufacturing executives take up arms to prevent the people from nationalizing
1540360	1542360	the industry, listen, they own the business.
1542360	1543360	All right.
1543360	1549360	In preventing the people from nationalizing their industry, they are the ones on the defense.
1549360	1554360	If violence is used to resist their violence, which is already a resistance of my violence,
1554360	1556360	why is this a moral problem for me?
1556360	1558360	See, he has to phrase it as if he's on the defensive, but he's not.
1558360	1559360	He's the aggressor.
1559360	1561360	I would enjoy smashing them.
1561360	1562360	It would mean justice is done.
1562360	1566360	Justice is done when we prevent people from who own their property from doing what they
1566360	1567360	like with it.
1567360	1568360	Yeah.
1568360	1569360	Yeah.
1569360	1573360	Justice requires that people can learn to be more pro-social and less selfish.
1573360	1574360	Just straight up propaganda.
1574360	1575360	All right.
1575360	1577360	No, I don't feel sorry for the kulaks.
1577360	1580360	They killed many families during their riots.
1580360	1584360	They slaughtered half the livestock used to farm the land.
1584360	1587360	They hid grain to speculate on prices, knowing people were suffering.
1587360	1589360	They probably hid grain to eat themselves, you fuck.
1589360	1593360	They encourage others to stop growing again, which would have made the famine worse.
1593360	1594360	They deserved it.
1594360	1596360	In this photo, Soviet workers found them hiding grain.
1596360	1598360	The kulaks deserve what they got.
1598360	1604360	So, if you own a farm and you want to, say, you know, own the means of production and
1604360	1609360	keep the produce of your labor, then you're a kulak.
1609360	1613360	Literally what socialists say they want before they take power after they take power.
1613360	1616360	If people actually have it, you're a fucking kulak.
1616360	1618360	Democracy stinks.
1618360	1621360	This guy's mask off about it.
1621360	1624360	Studies have shown there is no relationship between the public wants and policy enactment.
1624360	1625360	Zero.
1625360	1626360	Yeah.
1626360	1627360	Okay.
1627360	1628360	Not all the time, but sometimes.
1628360	1630360	American-style representative democracy is a farce.
1630360	1631360	The rich own the politicians.
1631360	1636360	At least in China, they have a functional and well-run government that plans the economy.
1636360	1641360	China only started becoming relevant when they liberalized and opened up.
1641360	1642360	And they're not even that liberal.
1642360	1645360	They just allowed some kind of liberal economics to take hold.
1645360	1647360	Human nature is communism.
1647360	1652360	Up until 12,000 years ago, humans lived as hunter-gatherers in communist societies.
1652360	1655360	Moneyless, stateless, and classless.
1655360	1658360	It sounds like you're a reactionary, my friend, trying to go back to the past.
1658360	1661360	Evolution has shaped us towards communism, not capitalism.
1661360	1662360	Not bullshit.
1662360	1667360	Again, I've talked about this before in the past, and there will probably be a much deeper video on the subject in the future,
1667360	1670360	but we are evolutionarily shaped towards liberalism, in fact.
1670360	1676360	There is a reason that we have a base understanding of property in our psychology that seems to be innate.
1676360	1678360	People have no understanding of communism.
1678360	1683360	At the beginning of the movie, 2001, A Space Odyssey, the early humans wake up to find the monolith.
1683360	1685360	They nervously approach it, not sure what to make of it.
1685360	1688360	It fascinates them, so they get closer and poke it.
1688360	1689360	But then they cower away.
1689360	1693360	They are intrigued, terrified, fascinated, and mystified by it.
1693360	1694360	It is alien to them.
1694360	1697360	It is so beyond their range of comprehension.
1697360	1698360	It is literally beyond anything they could imagine.
1698360	1699360	It is alien.
1699360	1701360	They don't know what to make of it.
1701360	1702360	Their best guesses are not even close.
1702360	1705360	It is an entirely different paradigm.
1705360	1708360	It represents the next leap forward of human existence, and they don't know it.
1708360	1712360	I see this same phenomenon on how people approach communism.
1712360	1713360	There is no difference.
1713360	1715360	Communism is the monolith.
1715360	1716360	Hold on.
1716360	1720360	In the previous point, you said that communism was what we lived in.
1720360	1721360	It's our nature.
1721360	1726360	And now you're saying that it's this alien object that is completely not like us at all.
1726360	1729360	And moreover, you're worshipping it like a god.
1729360	1734360	This is some literal God is the State fascist shit here.
1734360	1736360	No, Joseph Stalin wasn't a monster.
1736360	1738360	No, he didn't cause the Holodomor.
1738360	1739360	He didn't kill 60 million people.
1739360	1741360	He didn't become besties with Hitler.
1741360	1743360	The kulaks deserved it.
1743360	1746360	And the purges were not a cynical attempt by him to grab power.
1746360	1749360	The people voted for the purges and wanted them.
1749360	1750360	Hold on.
1750360	1752360	Didn't you just say that democracy was bad?
1752360	1753360	Wait.
1753360	1754360	Wait.
1754360	1755360	Wait.
1755360	1756360	Hold on.
1756360	1757360	I gotta parse this here.
1757360	1758360	Democracy bad.
1758360	1760360	That's what he said in a previous point.
1760360	1768360	But he also said democracy, people voted for purges, and purges good.
1768360	1773360	Like this guy contradicts his own points constantly in this.
1773360	1775360	Democracy bad unless they vote for what I want.
1775360	1778360	Holodomor isn't real, but the kulaks deserved it.
1778360	1781360	Communism is both the future and our ancient past.
1781360	1782360	Fuck, dude.
1782360	1785360	Mao and friends didn't kill a gazillion.
1785360	1789360	Mao and friends sounds like a Saturday morning cartoon show.
1789360	1790360	Fuck.
1790360	1791360	They didn't intentionally cause famines.
1791360	1795360	The overall majority of those who were killed by communists were traitors, saboteurs, Nazis,
1796360	1801360	and class enemies hellbent on returning people to capitalist slavery.
1801360	1806360	I don't know what kind of warped reality you have to live in to think any of these things,
1806360	1807360	man.
1807360	1808360	To think that the Soviets were good.
1808360	1810360	To think that the Maoists were good.
1810360	1812360	Or the Cubans or the Venezuelans.
1812360	1813360	Like fuck me, dude.
1813360	1815360	Like, you've seen this meme before, right?
1815360	1818360	Where it's the Joker and it's like, you don't like capitalism, yet you exist.
1818360	1821360	iPhone, Venezuela, sometimes it's vuvuzela.
1821360	1824360	Bottom text, 100 billion dead.
1824360	1828360	Even like Shu On Head has said this in her videos at some point.
1828360	1830360	And it's amazing.
1830360	1839360	Like, imagine being a Nazi in 2021 and someone approaches you with the legitimate, obvious,
1839360	1843360	glaring problems in the fact that you're a Nazi, okay?
1843360	1847360	And then you say, lol, Germany, Jews, 6 million cookies baked.
1847360	1852360	The fact that you can memeify something does not actually refute that thing.
1852360	1857360	But that's something that people like Shu, the socialist millennials and zoomers don't
1857360	1858360	really understand.
1858360	1861360	To them, memeifying is the same thing as refuting.
1861360	1866360	There seems to be this common attitude among these types of people where all sincerity
1866360	1868360	is run down by irony.
1868360	1869360	Cynicism rules the day.
1869360	1873360	And if you're hopeful or if you're building towards something or if you're happy or
1873360	1877360	you feel like you have your life on track, if you're grateful, if you have a sense
1877360	1881360	of duty, if you value love over casual sexual connection.
1881360	1887360	Any of these more esoteric qualities, these people would absolutely batter you with cynicism.
1887360	1889360	And fair enough, cynical humor is pretty funny.
1889360	1894360	But I really do think this too cool for school, I'm a cynic about everything, fedora tipping
1894360	1900360	atheist edgelord nonsense has defined a lot of their politics as well as their emotional
1900360	1901360	state.
1901360	1903360	Probably why all the atheist YouTubers became socialists in the end.
1903360	1906360	And of course, this is what these people are, guys.
1906360	1909360	Reddit's r slash socialism survey.
1909360	1914360	48% unemployed, 61% live with their parents, 14% support free speech.
1914360	1915360	Is anyone surprised?
1915360	1919360	Now, like, I'm not going to shit on people if they're unemployed, it can be hard to
1919360	1920360	get a job.
1920360	1922360	I'm not going to show them if they're living with their parents.
1922360	1924360	Sometimes it's hard to get started in life.
1924360	1927360	Or maybe you're saving money so that you can actually go and do something big with
1927360	1928360	it.
1928360	1931360	But the free speech thing, that's pretty unacceptable, isn't it?
1931360	1935360	The stereotype of leftists and socialists on the right wing is one of spoiled losers unemployed
1936360	1939360	listless with no regard for economics or the law.
1939360	1941360	But just how true is the stereotype?
1941360	1945360	According to a public survey on Reddit's r slash socialism board, it's painfully
1945360	1946360	accurate.
1946360	1950360	According to the survey, in which the results were self-admitted by the predominantly leftist
1950360	1955360	users of the board, 48% of the young socialists are unemployed and a stratospherically high
1955360	1958360	number of 61% still live with their parents.
1958360	1963360	Furthermore, the results found that 69% of the board's users were uneducated, 46% support
1963360	1968360	violent riots, and just 14% support the constitutional definition of unlimited free speech.
1968360	1972360	This is not the first time that documentation of leftists being losers has been confirmed
1972360	1977360	as a study of Antifa activists in Europe confirmed that 9 out of 10 leftist protesters still
1977360	1978360	live with their parents.
1978360	1984360	Alright, uh, obvious bias of this article being left aside for a minute.
1984360	1987360	It is funny to see this sort of thing get confirmed, isn't it?
1987360	1989360	Again, I do have some sympathy for them.
1989360	1992360	There is a difference between the guy who lives at home because he's taking care of
1992360	1995360	his parents, or his parents live 15 minutes away from the university and he's going
1995360	1998360	to school and it's just cheaper to stay there, or if he's saving up money to move
1998360	2003360	away or launch a business or go to school or buy his own place, you know, whatever.
2003360	2007360	There are reasons to do this stuff, but I don't have much sympathy for people who
2007360	2012360	just sit around and waste what little money they have on, on booze or drugs or worthless
2012360	2015360	shit that doesn't help them get ahead and then complain that they're still living
2015360	2016360	at their parents.
2016360	2018360	You make choices, you have to live with them.
2018360	2020360	I will say these people generally do have good intentions.
2020360	2025360	They believe that their ideas, as idealistic and utopian as they are, they can make everyone
2025360	2027360	equal and eliminate all injustice.
2027360	2030360	The eliminate all injustice stuff is good, even though it's unobtainable.
2030360	2032360	The making everyone equal stuff isn't good.
2032360	2036360	As long as there are differences in the quality and quantity of production, there will always
2036360	2037360	be inequality.
2037360	2040360	Trying to make everyone equal is actually not a good idea.
2040360	2041360	It's a bad idea.
2041360	2043360	But on the surface level, I can see why it's appealing to some people.
2043360	2047360	You know, you don't want there to be racism or sexism, so fair enough.
2047360	2051360	But the problem with them is that they're idealistic and utopian, even the good things
2051360	2052360	that they want to do.
2052360	2056360	And in my opinion, there's not much good, but even the good things that they want to
2056360	2058360	do, they cannot actually accomplish.
2058360	2062360	The libertarian socialists cannot actually do what they want to do without becoming the
2062360	2064360	tankies they claim to despise.
2064360	2068360	But the worst part of all is when they see people who disagree with them, whether that
2068360	2073360	be conservatives or liberals or even fascists, but you know, they have their own problems.
2073360	2078360	The socialists get very angry because from their point of view, they're working to save
2078360	2081360	the world and they can't understand why no one else wants to save it with them.
2081360	2085360	So they just look at everyone and say that they're hateful or they're bigoted or they
2085360	2086360	want people to be oppressed.
2086360	2090360	And the actual answer is that most people who are liberals and who are conservatives,
2090360	2092360	they're realists who want freedom.
2092360	2096360	And they understand that freedom and equality are somewhat incompatible because if you allow
2096360	2101360	people to simply be free and do what they want, they will act in an unequal manner.
2101360	2107360	And you end up with socialists outright despising non socialists because they think they're evil.
2107360	2111360	They think they're on a glorious crusade to save human civilization from itself.
2111360	2115360	And that is how you get to all of the examples I've shown you today from the intersectionalists
2115360	2119360	talking about class war and class conflict to the socialists who decry the Stalinists
2119360	2123360	simply because they have not yet allowed their ideas to come to their natural end.
2123360	2127360	And the Stalinists themselves for being the fascist pieces of shit that they actually are.
2127360	2132360	This is why people say that the radical left is good while the radical right is bad.
2132360	2138360	That the radical left simply means extreme equality for everyone, even though that would actually be bad.
2138360	2141360	And the radical right wants to eradicate everyone who's not them.
2141360	2146360	But from the radical right's point of view, they just want extreme freedom for everyone.
2146360	2149360	And they view the radical left as wanting to eradicate everyone who's not them.
2149360	2151360	As always, the truth is somewhere in the middle.
2151360	2156360	If you don't think that both extreme ends of the spectrum have a taste for genocide,
2156360	2158360	you have to be historically ignorant.
2158360	2163360	But at the same time, there are well-meaning leftists out there who simply want people to be cared for.
2163360	2167360	And there are well-meaning rightists out there who simply want people to be left alone.
2167360	2173360	I think, to your average person, the rightist position seems less harmful overall
2173360	2175360	because if you're left alone, well then you're just left alone.
2175360	2179360	You might suffer, you might not suffer, but at the very least the situation will be in your hands.
2179360	2185360	Meanwhile, the goals of the moderate leftist requires a lot more centralized control to actually do the caring.
2185360	2187360	So when things go wrong, they go wrong for everyone.
2187360	2192360	I think this might be the core reason why a lot of moderate leftists sometimes carry water for the tankies.
2192360	2199360	While in my experience anyway, it's somewhat rare that the free marketeers carry water for the imperialists and the monarchists.
2199360	2202360	But that is the champagne socialist in a nutshell.
2202360	2210360	Sometimes good people with sometimes good intentions who will ultimately be discarded if a socialist revolution ever actually happens.
2210360	2220360	And just in case you think that might actually happen someday, I'll leave you with this fun video of a Democratic Socialist of America meeting on April 14th, 2021.
2220360	2224360	These people ain't ever getting shit done, guys. Don't worry about it.
2224360	2233360	If we want to defeat capitalism, we are going to need a party that will organize working people to fight for the demands that we want and to win socialism.
2233360	2234360	Thank you so much.
2234360	2237360	Quick point of privilege. Quick point of personal privilege.
2238360	2241360	Guys, first of all, James Jackson, Sacramento, he him.
2241360	2244360	I just want to say, can we please keep the chatter to a minimum?
2244360	2247360	I'm one of the people who's very, very prone to sensory overload.
2247360	2249360	There's a lot of whispering and chatter going on.
2249360	2251360	It's making it very difficult for me to focus.
2251360	2256360	Please, can we just, I know we're all fresh and ready to go, but can we please just keep the chatter to a minimum?
2256360	2258360	It's affecting my ability to focus. Thank you.
2258360	2259360	Thank you, comrade.
2259360	2262360	Okay, is there a speaker against name, chapter, pronoun?
2262360	2264360	Point of personal privilege. Point of personal privilege.
2264360	2265360	Yes.
2265360	2270360	Please do not use gendered language to address everyone.
2272360	2273360	Okay.
