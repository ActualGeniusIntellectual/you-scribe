0	11160	A month ago, a relatively unknown subreddit called r slash anti-work went viral.
11160	15480	The point of the sub, at least at that time, was to highlight feel-good conversations of
15480	17660	workers sticking it to their shitty bosses.
17660	21320	The point of the sub, at least at that time, was to highlight feel-good conversations of
21320	23760	workers sticking it to their bad bosses.
23760	25160	Everyone loves a good dose of karma.
25160	26680	I mean, check this stuff out.
26680	28640	I think this was the one that made the sub famous.
28640	29640	Good evening.
29640	32060	I was reviewing the cameras from our shift today and noticed that you were sitting on
32060	33700	a stool for the majority of your shift.
33700	37480	This is completely unacceptable behavior and we'll be discussing it tomorrow before shift.
37480	38480	I cleared it with the lead.
38480	41240	I have two broken bones in my left foot, doctor documented.
41240	45860	Aside from that, I packed 240 uph for the entirety of my shift, 12 full hours.
45860	49360	I'm not sure if you're aware, but we do have a ranked list for packing displayed directly
49360	50360	above our stations.
50360	51920	My efforts earned me first place today.
51920	55360	So just to be clear, my impressive performance was overshadowed by the fact that I wasn't
55360	56760	uncomfortable enough while doing it.
56760	58660	I'm really not appreciating your attitude.
58660	61280	You could have just said the first part where it was clear with another lead instead of
61280	62280	being disrespectful.
62280	64280	This type of behavior isn't going to get you anywhere here.
64280	67920	Hey, thanks for wasting my precious off time with some garbage you didn't bother to investigate
67920	68920	beforehand.
68920	70280	Seriously, 240 uph.
70280	73320	What you claimed you'd depend on the performance there, I achieved it and I get grief because
73320	74320	I was sitting while doing it.
74320	75840	You guys need to get your priorities straight.
75840	77800	It's no wonder that you have such difficulties retaining staff.
77800	79480	I'm not concerned with going anywhere there.
79480	81640	It's a toxic environment with ignorant people at the helm.
81640	83500	I won't be in tomorrow or ever again.
83500	85040	We don't need to rush to you leaving.
85040	86040	Please talk this in the morning.
86040	87040	We can sort it out.
87040	88040	No, thanks.
88040	89040	Have a good life.
89040	93360	This is a classic example of a boss not understanding that he's about to lose his best employee
93360	95680	because he just has to maintain his position of power.
95680	98560	This sounds like a pretty skilled worker who will definitely land on his feet and this
98560	102120	sounds like a business that will probably flounder as they lose more and more employees
102120	103440	to bad decisions like this.
103440	104600	Let's check out this one.
104600	105600	Where are you at?
105600	106600	You told Mark you could work tonight.
106600	107600	No, I didn't.
107600	108600	I told Mark I couldn't work Monday.
108600	111000	You told him you couldn't work in the morning, but you could work normal hours.
111000	113240	As you know, I found out yesterday my dad passed away.
113240	116840	I'm going to go ahead and take at least the one day I get a week off to mourn his death.
116840	118920	I am so sorry for any inconveniences I'll cause you.
118920	120040	My uncle died a few days ago.
120040	121040	I lost my grandma.
121040	122040	Stop being a victim.
122040	123040	Mail me my check.
123040	124040	I quit.
124040	125040	Go fuck yourself.
125040	126040	That holy fuck.
126040	127040	Okay.
127040	129160	So obviously the boss is being fucking ridiculous here.
129160	131220	Like I don't think anyone's going to argue that.
131220	135200	The only point I will give the boss is that it sounds like earlier in the conversation
135200	139080	he's expecting him to come in and he hasn't yet been informed that his dad passed away.
139080	140080	That could be the case.
140080	141760	You don't have to leave work because someone dies.
141760	146000	You should, you should tell them obviously, but yeah, this whole stop being a victim thing,
146000	149960	man, that boss lost any, you know, the one sympathy point I had for him.
149960	150960	He lost it.
150960	153520	Hey Brandon, we're short staff for the rest of the year because Sarah just quit without
153520	154520	any warning.
154520	155520	Early backed up.
155520	157480	So I'm going to need you to come in during Thanksgiving this year.
157480	160040	Don't be shocked if you have to come in during Christmas Eve and day two.
160040	163520	Hey, you know, personally, I'd probably take that if it actually included, um, over time.
163520	164520	Fuck yeah.
164520	165520	I already told you three weeks ago.
165520	167960	I need that week off and you agreed now you're changing your mind.
167960	170760	I will not be working Thanksgiving and if you ask again, I will not be working for you
170760	171760	at all anymore.
171760	175040	We've had to set expectations with you multiple times this year.
175040	176620	Coming in is the least you can do.
176620	178200	Your PTO request has been denied.
178200	179520	I'm not asking you to come in.
179520	180820	I'm telling you that you have to.
180820	183240	I'm telling you that you'll have no worker at all now.
183240	184240	I quit.
184240	185240	I'm actually on the fence about this one.
185240	186980	You know, I mean he put in for time off.
186980	188280	It sounds like it's been denied though.
188280	189280	Clearly not officially.
189280	191880	We don't know what set expectations means.
191880	194880	It could be that they're terrible bosses or it could be he's a terrible employee.
194880	195880	Who knows?
195880	196880	Hey, Becky canceled on Saturday.
196880	198400	I need you to come in and cover for her.
198400	199400	That's not my problem.
199400	200400	Saturday is my day off.
200400	202240	I'm working eight days straight and really need it.
202240	203240	Damn.
203240	204240	I'm sorry.
204240	205240	We're short staffed.
205240	206240	I need you.
206240	207240	I'm not coming in.
207240	208240	So you have to.
208240	209240	I'll see you Saturday.
209240	210240	No, you won't.
210240	211240	I'm not coming in.
211240	212240	You can't make me.
212240	213240	You sure you want to do this?
213240	214240	You really want to put your health insurance on the lot?
214240	215240	Jesus.
215240	216240	Health insurance.
216240	217240	Like back when I worked other jobs.
217240	218240	Yeah.
218240	219240	I had the occasional dispute about time off.
219240	220240	I never had someone say this.
220240	221240	What are you going to do?
221240	222240	Fire me?
222240	225680	I know you're short staffed after Hunter and Page quit last week and you're already short
225680	226680	bartenders.
227480	228480	I accept that type of attitude.
228480	229480	Last chance.
229480	230480	I'll see you Sunday.
230480	231480	I won't see you again.
231480	232480	Did you really just threaten me with health insurance?
232480	233480	Whatever.
233480	234480	I'm done with this.
234480	235480	You can consider this my notice.
235480	236480	I don't know if you're bullshit.
236480	237480	Shitty bosses definitely do exist out there guys.
237480	240720	And sometimes they definitely do need to be put in their place, but it seems like leftoids
240720	245120	believe that the entire left is pro worker and the entire right is pro boss.
245120	249240	And that's it evenly cuts into two different camps and it's like, no, that's not how the
249240	250240	world is at all.
250240	251240	I need you tomorrow.
251240	252240	Saturdays are my days off.
252240	253240	I'll be with my fiance.
253240	254240	I'm short and I need you to come in.
254240	255240	Okay.
255240	256240	How much am I getting?
256800	258080	You're short staffed and you need to work tomorrow.
258080	260200	We call that expedited for 39 75.
260200	261880	I can be there tomorrow for 13.
261880	263300	I'll see you on Monday.
263300	264300	That's cheeky.
264300	266880	Most of my jobs that I've had have been union jobs.
266880	270680	And so the, the rate is basically set.
270680	274240	Even if you, even if your boss wants to give you a raise like this, they can't has to go
274240	275360	by the union contract.
275360	278560	But assuming this is a non union job, this is absolutely something that you can do.
278560	279560	You should do it.
279560	280560	Hello.
280560	281960	Sophia has just quit and we're already short staffed.
281960	284880	I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but it looks like I need to come in on Thanksgiving.
285520	286520	Unfortunately, I'll be out of town visiting family.
286520	287840	As I told you in October, you approved it.
287840	288840	I'm an older chairman plans.
288840	289840	I'm sorry.
289840	290840	I'm going to appreciate the tone.
290840	291840	What tone?
291840	293360	We have enough staff in October.
293360	294360	What I said no longer applies.
294360	295360	Again.
295360	296360	I apologize.
296360	297360	We need to come into Thanksgiving.
297360	298360	It won't be happening.
298360	299360	Speak to me like that again.
299360	300360	And you'll be really short staffed.
300360	303360	You're about to get yourself into some big trouble cooperate, or you may find yourself
303360	304500	here on Christmas as well.
304500	305500	Got it.
305500	306500	Yeah.
306500	307500	I'm not sure how I put up with your shit for almost a year.
307500	308500	I quit.
308500	309500	Good luck finding someone else though.
309500	314720	How, how dumb do you have to be to just keep doubling down like you boss, Mike, Mike from
314720	315720	work?
315720	316720	You need this person.
316720	317720	What are you?
317720	318720	What are you doing?
318720	319720	Oh God.
319720	322840	The boss's name this time is Robert C.P.
322840	325480	I need you to come in from 11 a.m. to 10 p.m. today.
325480	326480	We have an event scheduled.
326480	327480	Only one bartender.
327480	328480	No, thank you.
328480	329480	Tomorrow's my day off.
329480	330480	You need to be a team player.
330480	331480	It isn't all about you.
331480	332480	Please come in tomorrow.
332480	335040	Why are you just now telling me at 3 a.m. that you need me to work 11 hours tomorrow?
335040	336040	I've had a few drinks.
336040	338620	I don't feel like coming into work hung over and working from that long of a day on my
338620	339620	day off.
339620	341000	You need to stay ready for work.
341000	343680	Getting too drunk is not a good look if you can't stay prepared.
343680	344680	Sometimes things happen.
345640	348080	You're telling the bartender not to drink on his time off?
348080	350520	Want to go tell the chefs not to eat off the clock too?
350520	353520	Dude, if you had given me more notice I would have considered it and just not have had any
353520	354720	drinks so I don't have to work hung over.
354720	357800	But you waited too long, I'm already drunk and I don't feel like coming in while hung
357800	358800	over.
358800	359800	Don't you know how to bartend too?
359800	363640	Even if you don't we literally have flashcards for each drink on the menu for each event.
363640	366840	You can literally just tape them to the counter and use them as a guide to make the drinks
366840	367840	yourself.
367840	369760	We are going to talk about this attitude when you come in on Sunday.
369760	371080	No we're not.
371080	372200	Bartenders are needed all over the place now.
372200	374880	I think I'll just go to work at one of the dozens of places I'm hiring around here.
374880	375880	I'm fed up with you.
375880	376880	Give me a call.
376880	377880	Let me make such an impulsive decision.
377880	380880	You're making a mistake because you're drunk and you think it's a good idea.
380880	382760	When you wake up tomorrow you're going to regret this.
382760	386240	Eat my ass.
386240	390080	If they want you to be on call make sure that they're paying you so that you're on call.
390080	394360	I must admit I haven't really had the displeasure of experiencing any of this kind of stuff.
394360	397720	Places that would call me in when I work for them and I said listen I'm sorry I can't do
397720	398720	it today.
398720	400880	They're just like okay understood you know have a good day and that was it.
400880	405080	No one ever pressured me when I said no it was no and maybe just like a Canadian thing
405080	409240	because most people around here like they don't they don't get this stuff.
409240	413520	I think everybody's felt this way before you've got a shitty boss who clearly doesn't know
413520	417300	how integral you are to the operation or who doesn't care and thinks he has your balls
417300	421000	in a vice and you always daydream about the day you can finally tell him to fuck off because
421000	423460	you don't need this job anymore you quit.
423460	427760	Those aren't illegitimate feelings and since we have to go into political theory now Marx's
427760	432080	idea of alienation is one of the only things he got kind of right.
432080	436080	The theory of alienation is basically the idea that living in a capitalist society with
436080	440640	social classes creates an alienation of people from aspects of their nature resulting in
440640	442960	an estrangement from their own humanity.
442960	446800	Specifically in this case the alienation of production Marx theorized that a worker who
446800	451120	does not work for himself and keep the full produce of his labor but instead works for
451120	456080	another and exchanges his labor for money experiences alienation from his own labor.
456080	459760	In practical terms because he's lost the ability to direct his own production since
459760	464060	that's managed by a boss as a consequence he loses the ability to determine a portion
464060	466880	of his own life that time spent on the clock.
466880	471680	Marx's view was that downstream from this alienation was an eventual loss of the right
471680	475960	to think of themselves as the director of their own actions to define their relationships
475960	481420	with others and eventually the loss of ownership as a concept itself meaning that people would
481420	484440	not mentally understand what it means to own something.
484440	488520	In this conception Marx has presented what he believes to be liberalism's ultimate
488520	489520	end.
489520	493800	Workers as legally autonomous self-owned human beings but who have no choice but to enter
493800	498160	into business contracts with the bourgeoisie to sell themselves to survive and eventually
498160	503640	whose lives and consciousness revolves entirely around the selling of the self and this does
503640	507800	in fact seem to be the case though I think Marx overstates his argument at the end there
507800	512500	when he thinks that the most grinding long-term employment results in people losing the faculty
512500	514280	of self-thought and self-ownership.
514280	518320	But what's obvious to me is that what Marx considers to be liberalism's end it's a better
518320	521500	version of what socialism's actual end is.
521500	526000	Every commie in Prague out there every so-called left libertarian, libertarian socialist and
526000	530280	comm whatever despite the tenets of their theories they're all calling for increasing
530280	532980	government control especially in the wake of COVID.
532980	537240	They're all cheering on the increasing authoritarian centralization of the modern era.
537240	541700	They literally think you own nothing and will be happy is a good end.
541700	544180	Communism is a philosophy full of contradictions in this way.
544180	548300	All of the evil it does it claims its enemies will do and then when they do it they call
548300	549300	it good.
549300	553540	R slash anti-work like any other sub on reddit before it rapidly stopped being about funny
553540	557200	stories and interactions with shitty bosses and quickly became all about politics.
557200	561180	The sub now no longer features interesting text exchanges it's all about leftist theory,
561180	564240	articles about strikes, twitter screen caps about communist bullshit.
564240	565660	You know exactly what I'm talking about.
565660	569820	The entire sub has missed the main point and the entirety of the socialist movement has
569820	571760	missed it for the last hundred years.
571760	578020	That workers walking off the job is not socialist praxis it's not unionism it's liberal capitalism
578020	579260	in action.
579260	583060	Liberalism's founding moral principle isn't capitalism it's choice.
583060	588660	If we accept that we are free thinking feeling speaking beings with rights and responsibilities
588660	592540	that means we're self-owned our bodies and our lives are our property.
592540	595940	That means we can consent to arrangements with others we can say yes or no and that
595940	599780	means that we can consent to a job with a wage or we can stop consenting to it and stop
599780	600780	receiving the wage.
600780	603900	We don't live in a feudal society where the king can march up and order his serfs to work
603900	604900	under the threat of death.
604900	608420	We also don't live in a socialist society where the local commissar or SS officer can
608420	610160	give us a work voucher at gunpoint.
610160	615200	What the leftoids call capitalism is just the aggregate consent of people making deals
615200	619620	within a liberal framework and to shatter capitalism you must shatter the ability of
619620	621200	people to give consent.
621200	625240	The common socialist rebuttal to this hard truth is Vosch's coconuts argument which I
625240	626320	have gone over before.
626320	630480	The TLDR of it is if other people own all the businesses and you need to eat food you
630480	634320	must work in their business to be able to afford the food and so it's no different in
634320	637000	practicality than being ordered to work by a king.
637000	640720	This argument falls flat on its head however as soon as you ask how else it should be.
640720	643600	They inevitably say something like you should be given food because the human right you
643600	647200	shouldn't have to work for and the logical end result of that is that farmers who labor
647200	651200	to create food must be forced to give it up without compensation because it's the right
651200	654740	of other people to eat it and in that case why would you ever be a farmer?
654740	659460	This is why all socialist societies that grow beyond a simple family unit eventually starve.
659460	660460	Here's a great example.
685660	689380	And by the way there is another operating major thing here which is that all of these
689380	692380	societies have an abundance.
692380	698380	Despite having a gross abundance America has more than enough to feed the whole world.
698380	704340	We have such a great abundance and yet we still force people to work and I don't think
704340	707740	that would be a problem in an abundant communist society where things are shared.
707740	709300	I don't think that would be a problem at all.
709300	712700	If somebody decided for their own reasons I mean I think people have good reasons for
712700	713780	not wanting to work.
713820	717580	What demon mama is describing here if you dig a bit deeper is a situation where farmers
717580	719140	get paid nothing for their food.
719140	723420	It's not even a blowjobs for coconuts exchange, it's blowjobs for nothing, it's a worse
723420	724420	arrangement.
724420	729140	And though she will never say it if you scratch beneath the surface her politics and the politics
729140	735540	of every other socialist communist left anarchist whatever is all about that shattering of consent.
735540	738900	Returning to r slash anti work what makes the sub so funny is that they think they're
738900	742940	engaging in revolutionary praxis but the truth is this is liberalism just working as intended.
743100	747020	You got a shitty boss or a shitty job quit take labor elsewhere or work for yourself.
747020	750420	Somebody even posted this tweet talking about a company that raised its wages to attract
750420	753820	workers and suddenly they no longer had a labor shortage like it was somehow an own
753820	754900	of capitalism.
754900	756740	No this is how the system is meant to work.
756740	760620	The reason you don't think it works this way is a combination of shitty Marxist professors
760620	764820	telling you nonsense while you're in school and living in decades of unfettered immigration
764820	768700	decreasing the value of your labor due to inflated foreign competition.
768700	772760	It turns out when there's not many workers and too many jobs companies start competing
772760	775300	to buy labor and the price of labor goes up.
775300	778260	This is a fact that somebody with a professional level career knows all too well.
778260	781960	If you're high up in a company if you've got rare or invaluable skills organizations
781960	785320	will outbid each other to secure you because you're a valuable asset.
785320	789680	The reason non-compete clauses are big in the professional world is because if you quit
789680	793060	your boss doesn't want you taking all of your knowledge to their competitors and that
793060	795600	non-compete comes at the pay bump to compensate for it.
795600	799720	The current anti-work phenomenon is not something that could happen in any socialist system.
799720	802480	In a stateless moneyless classless society forget it.
802480	806040	Why should you have access to the commune stores if you aren't contributing to it?
806040	808100	Either you'll be kicked out or the commune will collapse.
808100	813280	In a more national socialist or national syndicalist society the economy is almost always restructured
813280	817600	into a neo-guildist system where you must be a member of the national trade union in
817600	821320	order to even qualify for work and then the powers that be will direct your production
821320	823600	for the good of the nation or the people or whatever.
823600	825200	You will never own your labor.
825200	827020	Your labor will belong to the collective.
827020	831260	Soviet Russia, Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy all implemented their command economies in
831260	835440	this way with some minor variations and communist China is doing the same right now.
835440	837420	But none of this is liberal economics.
837420	841180	None of this is anything close to free market capitalism and only when you have a sufficiently
841180	845420	free market do individuals have the freedom to quit jobs, make lateral moves or start
845420	846420	businesses of their own.
846420	850900	The people at r slash anti-work are literally too stupid to understand that they're cheering
850900	854060	for socialism while performing liberal praxis.
854060	855060	Please come into work.
855060	856060	We are short staffed.
856060	857060	No, fuck you.
857060	858060	I'm busy.
858060	859060	Well then you're fired jackass.
859060	860060	Don't come back.
860060	861060	Okay, I pull up.
861060	864740	You and all your friends.
864740	865740	I got baited.
865740	867100	I got baited guys.
