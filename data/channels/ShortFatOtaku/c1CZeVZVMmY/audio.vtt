00:00.000 --> 00:11.160
A month ago, a relatively unknown subreddit called r slash anti-work went viral.

00:11.160 --> 00:15.480
The point of the sub, at least at that time, was to highlight feel-good conversations of

00:15.480 --> 00:17.660
workers sticking it to their shitty bosses.

00:17.660 --> 00:21.320
The point of the sub, at least at that time, was to highlight feel-good conversations of

00:21.320 --> 00:23.760
workers sticking it to their bad bosses.

00:23.760 --> 00:25.160
Everyone loves a good dose of karma.

00:25.160 --> 00:26.680
I mean, check this stuff out.

00:26.680 --> 00:28.640
I think this was the one that made the sub famous.

00:28.640 --> 00:29.640
Good evening.

00:29.640 --> 00:32.060
I was reviewing the cameras from our shift today and noticed that you were sitting on

00:32.060 --> 00:33.700
a stool for the majority of your shift.

00:33.700 --> 00:37.480
This is completely unacceptable behavior and we'll be discussing it tomorrow before shift.

00:37.480 --> 00:38.480
I cleared it with the lead.

00:38.480 --> 00:41.240
I have two broken bones in my left foot, doctor documented.

00:41.240 --> 00:45.860
Aside from that, I packed 240 uph for the entirety of my shift, 12 full hours.

00:45.860 --> 00:49.360
I'm not sure if you're aware, but we do have a ranked list for packing displayed directly

00:49.360 --> 00:50.360
above our stations.

00:50.360 --> 00:51.920
My efforts earned me first place today.

00:51.920 --> 00:55.360
So just to be clear, my impressive performance was overshadowed by the fact that I wasn't

00:55.360 --> 00:56.760
uncomfortable enough while doing it.

00:56.760 --> 00:58.660
I'm really not appreciating your attitude.

00:58.660 --> 01:01.280
You could have just said the first part where it was clear with another lead instead of

01:01.280 --> 01:02.280
being disrespectful.

01:02.280 --> 01:04.280
This type of behavior isn't going to get you anywhere here.

01:04.280 --> 01:07.920
Hey, thanks for wasting my precious off time with some garbage you didn't bother to investigate

01:07.920 --> 01:08.920
beforehand.

01:08.920 --> 01:10.280
Seriously, 240 uph.

01:10.280 --> 01:13.320
What you claimed you'd depend on the performance there, I achieved it and I get grief because

01:13.320 --> 01:14.320
I was sitting while doing it.

01:14.320 --> 01:15.840
You guys need to get your priorities straight.

01:15.840 --> 01:17.800
It's no wonder that you have such difficulties retaining staff.

01:17.800 --> 01:19.480
I'm not concerned with going anywhere there.

01:19.480 --> 01:21.640
It's a toxic environment with ignorant people at the helm.

01:21.640 --> 01:23.500
I won't be in tomorrow or ever again.

01:23.500 --> 01:25.040
We don't need to rush to you leaving.

01:25.040 --> 01:26.040
Please talk this in the morning.

01:26.040 --> 01:27.040
We can sort it out.

01:27.040 --> 01:28.040
No, thanks.

01:28.040 --> 01:29.040
Have a good life.

01:29.040 --> 01:33.360
This is a classic example of a boss not understanding that he's about to lose his best employee

01:33.360 --> 01:35.680
because he just has to maintain his position of power.

01:35.680 --> 01:38.560
This sounds like a pretty skilled worker who will definitely land on his feet and this

01:38.560 --> 01:42.120
sounds like a business that will probably flounder as they lose more and more employees

01:42.120 --> 01:43.440
to bad decisions like this.

01:43.440 --> 01:44.600
Let's check out this one.

01:44.600 --> 01:45.600
Where are you at?

01:45.600 --> 01:46.600
You told Mark you could work tonight.

01:46.600 --> 01:47.600
No, I didn't.

01:47.600 --> 01:48.600
I told Mark I couldn't work Monday.

01:48.600 --> 01:51.000
You told him you couldn't work in the morning, but you could work normal hours.

01:51.000 --> 01:53.240
As you know, I found out yesterday my dad passed away.

01:53.240 --> 01:56.840
I'm going to go ahead and take at least the one day I get a week off to mourn his death.

01:56.840 --> 01:58.920
I am so sorry for any inconveniences I'll cause you.

01:58.920 --> 02:00.040
My uncle died a few days ago.

02:00.040 --> 02:01.040
I lost my grandma.

02:01.040 --> 02:02.040
Stop being a victim.

02:02.040 --> 02:03.040
Mail me my check.

02:03.040 --> 02:04.040
I quit.

02:04.040 --> 02:05.040
Go fuck yourself.

02:05.040 --> 02:06.040
That holy fuck.

02:06.040 --> 02:07.040
Okay.

02:07.040 --> 02:09.160
So obviously the boss is being fucking ridiculous here.

02:09.160 --> 02:11.220
Like I don't think anyone's going to argue that.

02:11.220 --> 02:15.200
The only point I will give the boss is that it sounds like earlier in the conversation

02:15.200 --> 02:19.080
he's expecting him to come in and he hasn't yet been informed that his dad passed away.

02:19.080 --> 02:20.080
That could be the case.

02:20.080 --> 02:21.760
You don't have to leave work because someone dies.

02:21.760 --> 02:26.000
You should, you should tell them obviously, but yeah, this whole stop being a victim thing,

02:26.000 --> 02:29.960
man, that boss lost any, you know, the one sympathy point I had for him.

02:29.960 --> 02:30.960
He lost it.

02:30.960 --> 02:33.520
Hey Brandon, we're short staff for the rest of the year because Sarah just quit without

02:33.520 --> 02:34.520
any warning.

02:34.520 --> 02:35.520
Early backed up.

02:35.520 --> 02:37.480
So I'm going to need you to come in during Thanksgiving this year.

02:37.480 --> 02:40.040
Don't be shocked if you have to come in during Christmas Eve and day two.

02:40.040 --> 02:43.520
Hey, you know, personally, I'd probably take that if it actually included, um, over time.

02:43.520 --> 02:44.520
Fuck yeah.

02:44.520 --> 02:45.520
I already told you three weeks ago.

02:45.520 --> 02:47.960
I need that week off and you agreed now you're changing your mind.

02:47.960 --> 02:50.760
I will not be working Thanksgiving and if you ask again, I will not be working for you

02:50.760 --> 02:51.760
at all anymore.

02:51.760 --> 02:55.040
We've had to set expectations with you multiple times this year.

02:55.040 --> 02:56.620
Coming in is the least you can do.

02:56.620 --> 02:58.200
Your PTO request has been denied.

02:58.200 --> 02:59.520
I'm not asking you to come in.

02:59.520 --> 03:00.820
I'm telling you that you have to.

03:00.820 --> 03:03.240
I'm telling you that you'll have no worker at all now.

03:03.240 --> 03:04.240
I quit.

03:04.240 --> 03:05.240
I'm actually on the fence about this one.

03:05.240 --> 03:06.980
You know, I mean he put in for time off.

03:06.980 --> 03:08.280
It sounds like it's been denied though.

03:08.280 --> 03:09.280
Clearly not officially.

03:09.280 --> 03:11.880
We don't know what set expectations means.

03:11.880 --> 03:14.880
It could be that they're terrible bosses or it could be he's a terrible employee.

03:14.880 --> 03:15.880
Who knows?

03:15.880 --> 03:16.880
Hey, Becky canceled on Saturday.

03:16.880 --> 03:18.400
I need you to come in and cover for her.

03:18.400 --> 03:19.400
That's not my problem.

03:19.400 --> 03:20.400
Saturday is my day off.

03:20.400 --> 03:22.240
I'm working eight days straight and really need it.

03:22.240 --> 03:23.240
Damn.

03:23.240 --> 03:24.240
I'm sorry.

03:24.240 --> 03:25.240
We're short staffed.

03:25.240 --> 03:26.240
I need you.

03:26.240 --> 03:27.240
I'm not coming in.

03:27.240 --> 03:28.240
So you have to.

03:28.240 --> 03:29.240
I'll see you Saturday.

03:29.240 --> 03:30.240
No, you won't.

03:30.240 --> 03:31.240
I'm not coming in.

03:31.240 --> 03:32.240
You can't make me.

03:32.240 --> 03:33.240
You sure you want to do this?

03:33.240 --> 03:34.240
You really want to put your health insurance on the lot?

03:34.240 --> 03:35.240
Jesus.

03:35.240 --> 03:36.240
Health insurance.

03:36.240 --> 03:37.240
Like back when I worked other jobs.

03:37.240 --> 03:38.240
Yeah.

03:38.240 --> 03:39.240
I had the occasional dispute about time off.

03:39.240 --> 03:40.240
I never had someone say this.

03:40.240 --> 03:41.240
What are you going to do?

03:41.240 --> 03:42.240
Fire me?

03:42.240 --> 03:45.680
I know you're short staffed after Hunter and Page quit last week and you're already short

03:45.680 --> 03:46.680
bartenders.

03:47.480 --> 03:48.480
I accept that type of attitude.

03:48.480 --> 03:49.480
Last chance.

03:49.480 --> 03:50.480
I'll see you Sunday.

03:50.480 --> 03:51.480
I won't see you again.

03:51.480 --> 03:52.480
Did you really just threaten me with health insurance?

03:52.480 --> 03:53.480
Whatever.

03:53.480 --> 03:54.480
I'm done with this.

03:54.480 --> 03:55.480
You can consider this my notice.

03:55.480 --> 03:56.480
I don't know if you're bullshit.

03:56.480 --> 03:57.480
Shitty bosses definitely do exist out there guys.

03:57.480 --> 04:00.720
And sometimes they definitely do need to be put in their place, but it seems like leftoids

04:00.720 --> 04:05.120
believe that the entire left is pro worker and the entire right is pro boss.

04:05.120 --> 04:09.240
And that's it evenly cuts into two different camps and it's like, no, that's not how the

04:09.240 --> 04:10.240
world is at all.

04:10.240 --> 04:11.240
I need you tomorrow.

04:11.240 --> 04:12.240
Saturdays are my days off.

04:12.240 --> 04:13.240
I'll be with my fiance.

04:13.240 --> 04:14.240
I'm short and I need you to come in.

04:14.240 --> 04:15.240
Okay.

04:15.240 --> 04:16.240
How much am I getting?

04:16.800 --> 04:18.080
You're short staffed and you need to work tomorrow.

04:18.080 --> 04:20.200
We call that expedited for 39 75.

04:20.200 --> 04:21.880
I can be there tomorrow for 13.

04:21.880 --> 04:23.300
I'll see you on Monday.

04:23.300 --> 04:24.300
That's cheeky.

04:24.300 --> 04:26.880
Most of my jobs that I've had have been union jobs.

04:26.880 --> 04:30.680
And so the, the rate is basically set.

04:30.680 --> 04:34.240
Even if you, even if your boss wants to give you a raise like this, they can't has to go

04:34.240 --> 04:35.360
by the union contract.

04:35.360 --> 04:38.560
But assuming this is a non union job, this is absolutely something that you can do.

04:38.560 --> 04:39.560
You should do it.

04:39.560 --> 04:40.560
Hello.

04:40.560 --> 04:41.960
Sophia has just quit and we're already short staffed.

04:41.960 --> 04:44.880
I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but it looks like I need to come in on Thanksgiving.

04:45.520 --> 04:46.520
Unfortunately, I'll be out of town visiting family.

04:46.520 --> 04:47.840
As I told you in October, you approved it.

04:47.840 --> 04:48.840
I'm an older chairman plans.

04:48.840 --> 04:49.840
I'm sorry.

04:49.840 --> 04:50.840
I'm going to appreciate the tone.

04:50.840 --> 04:51.840
What tone?

04:51.840 --> 04:53.360
We have enough staff in October.

04:53.360 --> 04:54.360
What I said no longer applies.

04:54.360 --> 04:55.360
Again.

04:55.360 --> 04:56.360
I apologize.

04:56.360 --> 04:57.360
We need to come into Thanksgiving.

04:57.360 --> 04:58.360
It won't be happening.

04:58.360 --> 04:59.360
Speak to me like that again.

04:59.360 --> 05:00.360
And you'll be really short staffed.

05:00.360 --> 05:03.360
You're about to get yourself into some big trouble cooperate, or you may find yourself

05:03.360 --> 05:04.500
here on Christmas as well.

05:04.500 --> 05:05.500
Got it.

05:05.500 --> 05:06.500
Yeah.

05:06.500 --> 05:07.500
I'm not sure how I put up with your shit for almost a year.

05:07.500 --> 05:08.500
I quit.

05:08.500 --> 05:09.500
Good luck finding someone else though.

05:09.500 --> 05:14.720
How, how dumb do you have to be to just keep doubling down like you boss, Mike, Mike from

05:14.720 --> 05:15.720
work?

05:15.720 --> 05:16.720
You need this person.

05:16.720 --> 05:17.720
What are you?

05:17.720 --> 05:18.720
What are you doing?

05:18.720 --> 05:19.720
Oh God.

05:19.720 --> 05:22.840
The boss's name this time is Robert C.P.

05:22.840 --> 05:25.480
I need you to come in from 11 a.m. to 10 p.m. today.

05:25.480 --> 05:26.480
We have an event scheduled.

05:26.480 --> 05:27.480
Only one bartender.

05:27.480 --> 05:28.480
No, thank you.

05:28.480 --> 05:29.480
Tomorrow's my day off.

05:29.480 --> 05:30.480
You need to be a team player.

05:30.480 --> 05:31.480
It isn't all about you.

05:31.480 --> 05:32.480
Please come in tomorrow.

05:32.480 --> 05:35.040
Why are you just now telling me at 3 a.m. that you need me to work 11 hours tomorrow?

05:35.040 --> 05:36.040
I've had a few drinks.

05:36.040 --> 05:38.620
I don't feel like coming into work hung over and working from that long of a day on my

05:38.620 --> 05:39.620
day off.

05:39.620 --> 05:41.000
You need to stay ready for work.

05:41.000 --> 05:43.680
Getting too drunk is not a good look if you can't stay prepared.

05:43.680 --> 05:44.680
Sometimes things happen.

05:45.640 --> 05:48.080
You're telling the bartender not to drink on his time off?

05:48.080 --> 05:50.520
Want to go tell the chefs not to eat off the clock too?

05:50.520 --> 05:53.520
Dude, if you had given me more notice I would have considered it and just not have had any

05:53.520 --> 05:54.720
drinks so I don't have to work hung over.

05:54.720 --> 05:57.800
But you waited too long, I'm already drunk and I don't feel like coming in while hung

05:57.800 --> 05:58.800
over.

05:58.800 --> 05:59.800
Don't you know how to bartend too?

05:59.800 --> 06:03.640
Even if you don't we literally have flashcards for each drink on the menu for each event.

06:03.640 --> 06:06.840
You can literally just tape them to the counter and use them as a guide to make the drinks

06:06.840 --> 06:07.840
yourself.

06:07.840 --> 06:09.760
We are going to talk about this attitude when you come in on Sunday.

06:09.760 --> 06:11.080
No we're not.

06:11.080 --> 06:12.200
Bartenders are needed all over the place now.

06:12.200 --> 06:14.880
I think I'll just go to work at one of the dozens of places I'm hiring around here.

06:14.880 --> 06:15.880
I'm fed up with you.

06:15.880 --> 06:16.880
Give me a call.

06:16.880 --> 06:17.880
Let me make such an impulsive decision.

06:17.880 --> 06:20.880
You're making a mistake because you're drunk and you think it's a good idea.

06:20.880 --> 06:22.760
When you wake up tomorrow you're going to regret this.

06:22.760 --> 06:26.240
Eat my ass.

06:26.240 --> 06:30.080
If they want you to be on call make sure that they're paying you so that you're on call.

06:30.080 --> 06:34.360
I must admit I haven't really had the displeasure of experiencing any of this kind of stuff.

06:34.360 --> 06:37.720
Places that would call me in when I work for them and I said listen I'm sorry I can't do

06:37.720 --> 06:38.720
it today.

06:38.720 --> 06:40.880
They're just like okay understood you know have a good day and that was it.

06:40.880 --> 06:45.080
No one ever pressured me when I said no it was no and maybe just like a Canadian thing

06:45.080 --> 06:49.240
because most people around here like they don't they don't get this stuff.

06:49.240 --> 06:53.520
I think everybody's felt this way before you've got a shitty boss who clearly doesn't know

06:53.520 --> 06:57.300
how integral you are to the operation or who doesn't care and thinks he has your balls

06:57.300 --> 07:01.000
in a vice and you always daydream about the day you can finally tell him to fuck off because

07:01.000 --> 07:03.460
you don't need this job anymore you quit.

07:03.460 --> 07:07.760
Those aren't illegitimate feelings and since we have to go into political theory now Marx's

07:07.760 --> 07:12.080
idea of alienation is one of the only things he got kind of right.

07:12.080 --> 07:16.080
The theory of alienation is basically the idea that living in a capitalist society with

07:16.080 --> 07:20.640
social classes creates an alienation of people from aspects of their nature resulting in

07:20.640 --> 07:22.960
an estrangement from their own humanity.

07:22.960 --> 07:26.800
Specifically in this case the alienation of production Marx theorized that a worker who

07:26.800 --> 07:31.120
does not work for himself and keep the full produce of his labor but instead works for

07:31.120 --> 07:36.080
another and exchanges his labor for money experiences alienation from his own labor.

07:36.080 --> 07:39.760
In practical terms because he's lost the ability to direct his own production since

07:39.760 --> 07:44.060
that's managed by a boss as a consequence he loses the ability to determine a portion

07:44.060 --> 07:46.880
of his own life that time spent on the clock.

07:46.880 --> 07:51.680
Marx's view was that downstream from this alienation was an eventual loss of the right

07:51.680 --> 07:55.960
to think of themselves as the director of their own actions to define their relationships

07:55.960 --> 08:01.420
with others and eventually the loss of ownership as a concept itself meaning that people would

08:01.420 --> 08:04.440
not mentally understand what it means to own something.

08:04.440 --> 08:08.520
In this conception Marx has presented what he believes to be liberalism's ultimate

08:08.520 --> 08:09.520
end.

08:09.520 --> 08:13.800
Workers as legally autonomous self-owned human beings but who have no choice but to enter

08:13.800 --> 08:18.160
into business contracts with the bourgeoisie to sell themselves to survive and eventually

08:18.160 --> 08:23.640
whose lives and consciousness revolves entirely around the selling of the self and this does

08:23.640 --> 08:27.800
in fact seem to be the case though I think Marx overstates his argument at the end there

08:27.800 --> 08:32.500
when he thinks that the most grinding long-term employment results in people losing the faculty

08:32.500 --> 08:34.280
of self-thought and self-ownership.

08:34.280 --> 08:38.320
But what's obvious to me is that what Marx considers to be liberalism's end it's a better

08:38.320 --> 08:41.500
version of what socialism's actual end is.

08:41.500 --> 08:46.000
Every commie in Prague out there every so-called left libertarian, libertarian socialist and

08:46.000 --> 08:50.280
comm whatever despite the tenets of their theories they're all calling for increasing

08:50.280 --> 08:52.980
government control especially in the wake of COVID.

08:52.980 --> 08:57.240
They're all cheering on the increasing authoritarian centralization of the modern era.

08:57.240 --> 09:01.700
They literally think you own nothing and will be happy is a good end.

09:01.700 --> 09:04.180
Communism is a philosophy full of contradictions in this way.

09:04.180 --> 09:08.300
All of the evil it does it claims its enemies will do and then when they do it they call

09:08.300 --> 09:09.300
it good.

09:09.300 --> 09:13.540
R slash anti-work like any other sub on reddit before it rapidly stopped being about funny

09:13.540 --> 09:17.200
stories and interactions with shitty bosses and quickly became all about politics.

09:17.200 --> 09:21.180
The sub now no longer features interesting text exchanges it's all about leftist theory,

09:21.180 --> 09:24.240
articles about strikes, twitter screen caps about communist bullshit.

09:24.240 --> 09:25.660
You know exactly what I'm talking about.

09:25.660 --> 09:29.820
The entire sub has missed the main point and the entirety of the socialist movement has

09:29.820 --> 09:31.760
missed it for the last hundred years.

09:31.760 --> 09:38.020
That workers walking off the job is not socialist praxis it's not unionism it's liberal capitalism

09:38.020 --> 09:39.260
in action.

09:39.260 --> 09:43.060
Liberalism's founding moral principle isn't capitalism it's choice.

09:43.060 --> 09:48.660
If we accept that we are free thinking feeling speaking beings with rights and responsibilities

09:48.660 --> 09:52.540
that means we're self-owned our bodies and our lives are our property.

09:52.540 --> 09:55.940
That means we can consent to arrangements with others we can say yes or no and that

09:55.940 --> 09:59.780
means that we can consent to a job with a wage or we can stop consenting to it and stop

09:59.780 --> 10:00.780
receiving the wage.

10:00.780 --> 10:03.900
We don't live in a feudal society where the king can march up and order his serfs to work

10:03.900 --> 10:04.900
under the threat of death.

10:04.900 --> 10:08.420
We also don't live in a socialist society where the local commissar or SS officer can

10:08.420 --> 10:10.160
give us a work voucher at gunpoint.

10:10.160 --> 10:15.200
What the leftoids call capitalism is just the aggregate consent of people making deals

10:15.200 --> 10:19.620
within a liberal framework and to shatter capitalism you must shatter the ability of

10:19.620 --> 10:21.200
people to give consent.

10:21.200 --> 10:25.240
The common socialist rebuttal to this hard truth is Vosch's coconuts argument which I

10:25.240 --> 10:26.320
have gone over before.

10:26.320 --> 10:30.480
The TLDR of it is if other people own all the businesses and you need to eat food you

10:30.480 --> 10:34.320
must work in their business to be able to afford the food and so it's no different in

10:34.320 --> 10:37.000
practicality than being ordered to work by a king.

10:37.000 --> 10:40.720
This argument falls flat on its head however as soon as you ask how else it should be.

10:40.720 --> 10:43.600
They inevitably say something like you should be given food because the human right you

10:43.600 --> 10:47.200
shouldn't have to work for and the logical end result of that is that farmers who labor

10:47.200 --> 10:51.200
to create food must be forced to give it up without compensation because it's the right

10:51.200 --> 10:54.740
of other people to eat it and in that case why would you ever be a farmer?

10:54.740 --> 10:59.460
This is why all socialist societies that grow beyond a simple family unit eventually starve.

10:59.460 --> 11:00.460
Here's a great example.

11:25.660 --> 11:29.380
And by the way there is another operating major thing here which is that all of these

11:29.380 --> 11:32.380
societies have an abundance.

11:32.380 --> 11:38.380
Despite having a gross abundance America has more than enough to feed the whole world.

11:38.380 --> 11:44.340
We have such a great abundance and yet we still force people to work and I don't think

11:44.340 --> 11:47.740
that would be a problem in an abundant communist society where things are shared.

11:47.740 --> 11:49.300
I don't think that would be a problem at all.

11:49.300 --> 11:52.700
If somebody decided for their own reasons I mean I think people have good reasons for

11:52.700 --> 11:53.780
not wanting to work.

11:53.820 --> 11:57.580
What demon mama is describing here if you dig a bit deeper is a situation where farmers

11:57.580 --> 11:59.140
get paid nothing for their food.

11:59.140 --> 12:03.420
It's not even a blowjobs for coconuts exchange, it's blowjobs for nothing, it's a worse

12:03.420 --> 12:04.420
arrangement.

12:04.420 --> 12:09.140
And though she will never say it if you scratch beneath the surface her politics and the politics

12:09.140 --> 12:15.540
of every other socialist communist left anarchist whatever is all about that shattering of consent.

12:15.540 --> 12:18.900
Returning to r slash anti work what makes the sub so funny is that they think they're

12:18.900 --> 12:22.940
engaging in revolutionary praxis but the truth is this is liberalism just working as intended.

12:23.100 --> 12:27.020
You got a shitty boss or a shitty job quit take labor elsewhere or work for yourself.

12:27.020 --> 12:30.420
Somebody even posted this tweet talking about a company that raised its wages to attract

12:30.420 --> 12:33.820
workers and suddenly they no longer had a labor shortage like it was somehow an own

12:33.820 --> 12:34.900
of capitalism.

12:34.900 --> 12:36.740
No this is how the system is meant to work.

12:36.740 --> 12:40.620
The reason you don't think it works this way is a combination of shitty Marxist professors

12:40.620 --> 12:44.820
telling you nonsense while you're in school and living in decades of unfettered immigration

12:44.820 --> 12:48.700
decreasing the value of your labor due to inflated foreign competition.

12:48.700 --> 12:52.760
It turns out when there's not many workers and too many jobs companies start competing

12:52.760 --> 12:55.300
to buy labor and the price of labor goes up.

12:55.300 --> 12:58.260
This is a fact that somebody with a professional level career knows all too well.

12:58.260 --> 13:01.960
If you're high up in a company if you've got rare or invaluable skills organizations

13:01.960 --> 13:05.320
will outbid each other to secure you because you're a valuable asset.

13:05.320 --> 13:09.680
The reason non-compete clauses are big in the professional world is because if you quit

13:09.680 --> 13:13.060
your boss doesn't want you taking all of your knowledge to their competitors and that

13:13.060 --> 13:15.600
non-compete comes at the pay bump to compensate for it.

13:15.600 --> 13:19.720
The current anti-work phenomenon is not something that could happen in any socialist system.

13:19.720 --> 13:22.480
In a stateless moneyless classless society forget it.

13:22.480 --> 13:26.040
Why should you have access to the commune stores if you aren't contributing to it?

13:26.040 --> 13:28.100
Either you'll be kicked out or the commune will collapse.

13:28.100 --> 13:33.280
In a more national socialist or national syndicalist society the economy is almost always restructured

13:33.280 --> 13:37.600
into a neo-guildist system where you must be a member of the national trade union in

13:37.600 --> 13:41.320
order to even qualify for work and then the powers that be will direct your production

13:41.320 --> 13:43.600
for the good of the nation or the people or whatever.

13:43.600 --> 13:45.200
You will never own your labor.

13:45.200 --> 13:47.020
Your labor will belong to the collective.

13:47.020 --> 13:51.260
Soviet Russia, Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy all implemented their command economies in

13:51.260 --> 13:55.440
this way with some minor variations and communist China is doing the same right now.

13:55.440 --> 13:57.420
But none of this is liberal economics.

13:57.420 --> 14:01.180
None of this is anything close to free market capitalism and only when you have a sufficiently

14:01.180 --> 14:05.420
free market do individuals have the freedom to quit jobs, make lateral moves or start

14:05.420 --> 14:06.420
businesses of their own.

14:06.420 --> 14:10.900
The people at r slash anti-work are literally too stupid to understand that they're cheering

14:10.900 --> 14:14.060
for socialism while performing liberal praxis.

14:14.060 --> 14:15.060
Please come into work.

14:15.060 --> 14:16.060
We are short staffed.

14:16.060 --> 14:17.060
No, fuck you.

14:17.060 --> 14:18.060
I'm busy.

14:18.060 --> 14:19.060
Well then you're fired jackass.

14:19.060 --> 14:20.060
Don't come back.

14:20.060 --> 14:21.060
Okay, I pull up.

14:21.060 --> 14:24.740
You and all your friends.

14:24.740 --> 14:25.740
I got baited.

14:25.740 --> 14:27.100
I got baited guys.
