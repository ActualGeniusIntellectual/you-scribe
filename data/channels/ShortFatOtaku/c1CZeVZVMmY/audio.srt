00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,160
A month ago, a relatively unknown subreddit called r slash anti-work went viral.

2
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:15,480
The point of the sub, at least at that time, was to highlight feel-good conversations of

3
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:17,660
workers sticking it to their shitty bosses.

4
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:21,320
The point of the sub, at least at that time, was to highlight feel-good conversations of

5
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:23,760
workers sticking it to their bad bosses.

6
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,160
Everyone loves a good dose of karma.

7
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:26,680
I mean, check this stuff out.

8
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:28,640
I think this was the one that made the sub famous.

9
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:29,640
Good evening.

10
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:32,060
I was reviewing the cameras from our shift today and noticed that you were sitting on

11
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:33,700
a stool for the majority of your shift.

12
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:37,480
This is completely unacceptable behavior and we'll be discussing it tomorrow before shift.

13
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:38,480
I cleared it with the lead.

14
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:41,240
I have two broken bones in my left foot, doctor documented.

15
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:45,860
Aside from that, I packed 240 uph for the entirety of my shift, 12 full hours.

16
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:49,360
I'm not sure if you're aware, but we do have a ranked list for packing displayed directly

17
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:50,360
above our stations.

18
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:51,920
My efforts earned me first place today.

19
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:55,360
So just to be clear, my impressive performance was overshadowed by the fact that I wasn't

20
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:56,760
uncomfortable enough while doing it.

21
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:58,660
I'm really not appreciating your attitude.

22
00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:01,280
You could have just said the first part where it was clear with another lead instead of

23
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:02,280
being disrespectful.

24
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:04,280
This type of behavior isn't going to get you anywhere here.

25
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:07,920
Hey, thanks for wasting my precious off time with some garbage you didn't bother to investigate

26
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:08,920
beforehand.

27
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:10,280
Seriously, 240 uph.

28
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:13,320
What you claimed you'd depend on the performance there, I achieved it and I get grief because

29
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:14,320
I was sitting while doing it.

30
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:15,840
You guys need to get your priorities straight.

31
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,800
It's no wonder that you have such difficulties retaining staff.

32
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:19,480
I'm not concerned with going anywhere there.

33
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:21,640
It's a toxic environment with ignorant people at the helm.

34
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:23,500
I won't be in tomorrow or ever again.

35
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:25,040
We don't need to rush to you leaving.

36
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:26,040
Please talk this in the morning.

37
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:27,040
We can sort it out.

38
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,040
No, thanks.

39
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:29,040
Have a good life.

40
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:33,360
This is a classic example of a boss not understanding that he's about to lose his best employee

41
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,680
because he just has to maintain his position of power.

42
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:38,560
This sounds like a pretty skilled worker who will definitely land on his feet and this

43
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:42,120
sounds like a business that will probably flounder as they lose more and more employees

44
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:43,440
to bad decisions like this.

45
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:44,600
Let's check out this one.

46
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:45,600
Where are you at?

47
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:46,600
You told Mark you could work tonight.

48
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:47,600
No, I didn't.

49
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:48,600
I told Mark I couldn't work Monday.

50
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:51,000
You told him you couldn't work in the morning, but you could work normal hours.

51
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,240
As you know, I found out yesterday my dad passed away.

52
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:56,840
I'm going to go ahead and take at least the one day I get a week off to mourn his death.

53
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:58,920
I am so sorry for any inconveniences I'll cause you.

54
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,040
My uncle died a few days ago.

55
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,040
I lost my grandma.

56
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,040
Stop being a victim.

57
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,040
Mail me my check.

58
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,040
I quit.

59
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,040
Go fuck yourself.

60
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,040
That holy fuck.

61
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:07,040
Okay.

62
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,160
So obviously the boss is being fucking ridiculous here.

63
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:11,220
Like I don't think anyone's going to argue that.

64
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:15,200
The only point I will give the boss is that it sounds like earlier in the conversation

65
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:19,080
he's expecting him to come in and he hasn't yet been informed that his dad passed away.

66
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:20,080
That could be the case.

67
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,760
You don't have to leave work because someone dies.

68
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:26,000
You should, you should tell them obviously, but yeah, this whole stop being a victim thing,

69
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,960
man, that boss lost any, you know, the one sympathy point I had for him.

70
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:30,960
He lost it.

71
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:33,520
Hey Brandon, we're short staff for the rest of the year because Sarah just quit without

72
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:34,520
any warning.

73
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,520
Early backed up.

74
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:37,480
So I'm going to need you to come in during Thanksgiving this year.

75
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:40,040
Don't be shocked if you have to come in during Christmas Eve and day two.

76
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:43,520
Hey, you know, personally, I'd probably take that if it actually included, um, over time.

77
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,520
Fuck yeah.

78
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,520
I already told you three weeks ago.

79
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:47,960
I need that week off and you agreed now you're changing your mind.

80
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:50,760
I will not be working Thanksgiving and if you ask again, I will not be working for you

81
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:51,760
at all anymore.

82
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:55,040
We've had to set expectations with you multiple times this year.

83
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,620
Coming in is the least you can do.

84
00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:58,200
Your PTO request has been denied.

85
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,520
I'm not asking you to come in.

86
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:00,820
I'm telling you that you have to.

87
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:03,240
I'm telling you that you'll have no worker at all now.

88
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,240
I quit.

89
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,240
I'm actually on the fence about this one.

90
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,980
You know, I mean he put in for time off.

91
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:08,280
It sounds like it's been denied though.

92
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,280
Clearly not officially.

93
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,880
We don't know what set expectations means.

94
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:14,880
It could be that they're terrible bosses or it could be he's a terrible employee.

95
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:15,880
Who knows?

96
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:16,880
Hey, Becky canceled on Saturday.

97
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:18,400
I need you to come in and cover for her.

98
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,400
That's not my problem.

99
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,400
Saturday is my day off.

100
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,240
I'm working eight days straight and really need it.

101
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,240
Damn.

102
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,240
I'm sorry.

103
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,240
We're short staffed.

104
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,240
I need you.

105
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,240
I'm not coming in.

106
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,240
So you have to.

107
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,240
I'll see you Saturday.

108
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,240
No, you won't.

109
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,240
I'm not coming in.

110
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,240
You can't make me.

111
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,240
You sure you want to do this?

112
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,240
You really want to put your health insurance on the lot?

113
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:35,240
Jesus.

114
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,240
Health insurance.

115
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,240
Like back when I worked other jobs.

116
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,240
Yeah.

117
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,240
I had the occasional dispute about time off.

118
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,240
I never had someone say this.

119
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,240
What are you going to do?

120
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,240
Fire me?

121
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:45,680
I know you're short staffed after Hunter and Page quit last week and you're already short

122
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:46,680
bartenders.

123
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:48,480
I accept that type of attitude.

124
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:49,480
Last chance.

125
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:50,480
I'll see you Sunday.

126
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,480
I won't see you again.

127
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:52,480
Did you really just threaten me with health insurance?

128
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:53,480
Whatever.

129
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:54,480
I'm done with this.

130
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:55,480
You can consider this my notice.

131
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:56,480
I don't know if you're bullshit.

132
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:57,480
Shitty bosses definitely do exist out there guys.

133
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:00,720
And sometimes they definitely do need to be put in their place, but it seems like leftoids

134
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:05,120
believe that the entire left is pro worker and the entire right is pro boss.

135
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:09,240
And that's it evenly cuts into two different camps and it's like, no, that's not how the

136
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:10,240
world is at all.

137
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,240
I need you tomorrow.

138
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,240
Saturdays are my days off.

139
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,240
I'll be with my fiance.

140
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,240
I'm short and I need you to come in.

141
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,240
Okay.

142
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,240
How much am I getting?

143
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,080
You're short staffed and you need to work tomorrow.

144
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:20,200
We call that expedited for 39 75.

145
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,880
I can be there tomorrow for 13.

146
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:23,300
I'll see you on Monday.

147
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:24,300
That's cheeky.

148
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:26,880
Most of my jobs that I've had have been union jobs.

149
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:30,680
And so the, the rate is basically set.

150
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:34,240
Even if you, even if your boss wants to give you a raise like this, they can't has to go

151
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,360
by the union contract.

152
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:38,560
But assuming this is a non union job, this is absolutely something that you can do.

153
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,560
You should do it.

154
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:40,560
Hello.

155
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:41,960
Sophia has just quit and we're already short staffed.

156
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:44,880
I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but it looks like I need to come in on Thanksgiving.

157
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:46,520
Unfortunately, I'll be out of town visiting family.

158
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:47,840
As I told you in October, you approved it.

159
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:48,840
I'm an older chairman plans.

160
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:49,840
I'm sorry.

161
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:50,840
I'm going to appreciate the tone.

162
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:51,840
What tone?

163
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,360
We have enough staff in October.

164
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,360
What I said no longer applies.

165
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,360
Again.

166
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,360
I apologize.

167
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:57,360
We need to come into Thanksgiving.

168
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,360
It won't be happening.

169
00:04:58,360 --> 00:04:59,360
Speak to me like that again.

170
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,360
And you'll be really short staffed.

171
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:03,360
You're about to get yourself into some big trouble cooperate, or you may find yourself

172
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,500
here on Christmas as well.

173
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:05,500
Got it.

174
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:06,500
Yeah.

175
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:07,500
I'm not sure how I put up with your shit for almost a year.

176
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:08,500
I quit.

177
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:09,500
Good luck finding someone else though.

178
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:14,720
How, how dumb do you have to be to just keep doubling down like you boss, Mike, Mike from

179
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:15,720
work?

180
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:16,720
You need this person.

181
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:17,720
What are you?

182
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:18,720
What are you doing?

183
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:19,720
Oh God.

184
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:22,840
The boss's name this time is Robert C.P.

185
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:25,480
I need you to come in from 11 a.m. to 10 p.m. today.

186
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:26,480
We have an event scheduled.

187
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,480
Only one bartender.

188
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,480
No, thank you.

189
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,480
Tomorrow's my day off.

190
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:30,480
You need to be a team player.

191
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:31,480
It isn't all about you.

192
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,480
Please come in tomorrow.

193
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:35,040
Why are you just now telling me at 3 a.m. that you need me to work 11 hours tomorrow?

194
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,040
I've had a few drinks.

195
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:38,620
I don't feel like coming into work hung over and working from that long of a day on my

196
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:39,620
day off.

197
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:41,000
You need to stay ready for work.

198
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,680
Getting too drunk is not a good look if you can't stay prepared.

199
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:44,680
Sometimes things happen.

200
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:48,080
You're telling the bartender not to drink on his time off?

201
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,520
Want to go tell the chefs not to eat off the clock too?

202
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:53,520
Dude, if you had given me more notice I would have considered it and just not have had any

203
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:54,720
drinks so I don't have to work hung over.

204
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:57,800
But you waited too long, I'm already drunk and I don't feel like coming in while hung

205
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:58,800
over.

206
00:05:58,800 --> 00:05:59,800
Don't you know how to bartend too?

207
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:03,640
Even if you don't we literally have flashcards for each drink on the menu for each event.

208
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:06,840
You can literally just tape them to the counter and use them as a guide to make the drinks

209
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:07,840
yourself.

210
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,760
We are going to talk about this attitude when you come in on Sunday.

211
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:11,080
No we're not.

212
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:12,200
Bartenders are needed all over the place now.

213
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:14,880
I think I'll just go to work at one of the dozens of places I'm hiring around here.

214
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:15,880
I'm fed up with you.

215
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:16,880
Give me a call.

216
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:17,880
Let me make such an impulsive decision.

217
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:20,880
You're making a mistake because you're drunk and you think it's a good idea.

218
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,760
When you wake up tomorrow you're going to regret this.

219
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:26,240
Eat my ass.

220
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:30,080
If they want you to be on call make sure that they're paying you so that you're on call.

221
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:34,360
I must admit I haven't really had the displeasure of experiencing any of this kind of stuff.

222
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:37,720
Places that would call me in when I work for them and I said listen I'm sorry I can't do

223
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:38,720
it today.

224
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,880
They're just like okay understood you know have a good day and that was it.

225
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:45,080
No one ever pressured me when I said no it was no and maybe just like a Canadian thing

226
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:49,240
because most people around here like they don't they don't get this stuff.

227
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:53,520
I think everybody's felt this way before you've got a shitty boss who clearly doesn't know

228
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:57,300
how integral you are to the operation or who doesn't care and thinks he has your balls

229
00:06:57,300 --> 00:07:01,000
in a vice and you always daydream about the day you can finally tell him to fuck off because

230
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,460
you don't need this job anymore you quit.

231
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:07,760
Those aren't illegitimate feelings and since we have to go into political theory now Marx's

232
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:12,080
idea of alienation is one of the only things he got kind of right.

233
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:16,080
The theory of alienation is basically the idea that living in a capitalist society with

234
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:20,640
social classes creates an alienation of people from aspects of their nature resulting in

235
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:22,960
an estrangement from their own humanity.

236
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:26,800
Specifically in this case the alienation of production Marx theorized that a worker who

237
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:31,120
does not work for himself and keep the full produce of his labor but instead works for

238
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:36,080
another and exchanges his labor for money experiences alienation from his own labor.

239
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:39,760
In practical terms because he's lost the ability to direct his own production since

240
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:44,060
that's managed by a boss as a consequence he loses the ability to determine a portion

241
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:46,880
of his own life that time spent on the clock.

242
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:51,680
Marx's view was that downstream from this alienation was an eventual loss of the right

243
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:55,960
to think of themselves as the director of their own actions to define their relationships

244
00:07:55,960 --> 00:08:01,420
with others and eventually the loss of ownership as a concept itself meaning that people would

245
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:04,440
not mentally understand what it means to own something.

246
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:08,520
In this conception Marx has presented what he believes to be liberalism's ultimate

247
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:09,520
end.

248
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:13,800
Workers as legally autonomous self-owned human beings but who have no choice but to enter

249
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:18,160
into business contracts with the bourgeoisie to sell themselves to survive and eventually

250
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:23,640
whose lives and consciousness revolves entirely around the selling of the self and this does

251
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:27,800
in fact seem to be the case though I think Marx overstates his argument at the end there

252
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:32,500
when he thinks that the most grinding long-term employment results in people losing the faculty

253
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:34,280
of self-thought and self-ownership.

254
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:38,320
But what's obvious to me is that what Marx considers to be liberalism's end it's a better

255
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:41,500
version of what socialism's actual end is.

256
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:46,000
Every commie in Prague out there every so-called left libertarian, libertarian socialist and

257
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,280
comm whatever despite the tenets of their theories they're all calling for increasing

258
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:52,980
government control especially in the wake of COVID.

259
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:57,240
They're all cheering on the increasing authoritarian centralization of the modern era.

260
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:01,700
They literally think you own nothing and will be happy is a good end.

261
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:04,180
Communism is a philosophy full of contradictions in this way.

262
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:08,300
All of the evil it does it claims its enemies will do and then when they do it they call

263
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:09,300
it good.

264
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:13,540
R slash anti-work like any other sub on reddit before it rapidly stopped being about funny

265
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:17,200
stories and interactions with shitty bosses and quickly became all about politics.

266
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:21,180
The sub now no longer features interesting text exchanges it's all about leftist theory,

267
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:24,240
articles about strikes, twitter screen caps about communist bullshit.

268
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,660
You know exactly what I'm talking about.

269
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:29,820
The entire sub has missed the main point and the entirety of the socialist movement has

270
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:31,760
missed it for the last hundred years.

271
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:38,020
That workers walking off the job is not socialist praxis it's not unionism it's liberal capitalism

272
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:39,260
in action.

273
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:43,060
Liberalism's founding moral principle isn't capitalism it's choice.

274
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:48,660
If we accept that we are free thinking feeling speaking beings with rights and responsibilities

275
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:52,540
that means we're self-owned our bodies and our lives are our property.

276
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:55,940
That means we can consent to arrangements with others we can say yes or no and that

277
00:09:55,940 --> 00:09:59,780
means that we can consent to a job with a wage or we can stop consenting to it and stop

278
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:00,780
receiving the wage.

279
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:03,900
We don't live in a feudal society where the king can march up and order his serfs to work

280
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:04,900
under the threat of death.

281
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:08,420
We also don't live in a socialist society where the local commissar or SS officer can

282
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:10,160
give us a work voucher at gunpoint.

283
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:15,200
What the leftoids call capitalism is just the aggregate consent of people making deals

284
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:19,620
within a liberal framework and to shatter capitalism you must shatter the ability of

285
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:21,200
people to give consent.

286
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:25,240
The common socialist rebuttal to this hard truth is Vosch's coconuts argument which I

287
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:26,320
have gone over before.

288
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:30,480
The TLDR of it is if other people own all the businesses and you need to eat food you

289
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:34,320
must work in their business to be able to afford the food and so it's no different in

290
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:37,000
practicality than being ordered to work by a king.

291
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,720
This argument falls flat on its head however as soon as you ask how else it should be.

292
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:43,600
They inevitably say something like you should be given food because the human right you

293
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:47,200
shouldn't have to work for and the logical end result of that is that farmers who labor

294
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:51,200
to create food must be forced to give it up without compensation because it's the right

295
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:54,740
of other people to eat it and in that case why would you ever be a farmer?

296
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:59,460
This is why all socialist societies that grow beyond a simple family unit eventually starve.

297
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:00,460
Here's a great example.

298
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:29,380
And by the way there is another operating major thing here which is that all of these

299
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:32,380
societies have an abundance.

300
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:38,380
Despite having a gross abundance America has more than enough to feed the whole world.

301
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:44,340
We have such a great abundance and yet we still force people to work and I don't think

302
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:47,740
that would be a problem in an abundant communist society where things are shared.

303
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:49,300
I don't think that would be a problem at all.

304
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:52,700
If somebody decided for their own reasons I mean I think people have good reasons for

305
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:53,780
not wanting to work.

306
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:57,580
What demon mama is describing here if you dig a bit deeper is a situation where farmers

307
00:11:57,580 --> 00:11:59,140
get paid nothing for their food.

308
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:03,420
It's not even a blowjobs for coconuts exchange, it's blowjobs for nothing, it's a worse

309
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:04,420
arrangement.

310
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:09,140
And though she will never say it if you scratch beneath the surface her politics and the politics

311
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:15,540
of every other socialist communist left anarchist whatever is all about that shattering of consent.

312
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:18,900
Returning to r slash anti work what makes the sub so funny is that they think they're

313
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:22,940
engaging in revolutionary praxis but the truth is this is liberalism just working as intended.

314
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:27,020
You got a shitty boss or a shitty job quit take labor elsewhere or work for yourself.

315
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:30,420
Somebody even posted this tweet talking about a company that raised its wages to attract

316
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:33,820
workers and suddenly they no longer had a labor shortage like it was somehow an own

317
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:34,900
of capitalism.

318
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:36,740
No this is how the system is meant to work.

319
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:40,620
The reason you don't think it works this way is a combination of shitty Marxist professors

320
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:44,820
telling you nonsense while you're in school and living in decades of unfettered immigration

321
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:48,700
decreasing the value of your labor due to inflated foreign competition.

322
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:52,760
It turns out when there's not many workers and too many jobs companies start competing

323
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:55,300
to buy labor and the price of labor goes up.

324
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:58,260
This is a fact that somebody with a professional level career knows all too well.

325
00:12:58,260 --> 00:13:01,960
If you're high up in a company if you've got rare or invaluable skills organizations

326
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:05,320
will outbid each other to secure you because you're a valuable asset.

327
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:09,680
The reason non-compete clauses are big in the professional world is because if you quit

328
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:13,060
your boss doesn't want you taking all of your knowledge to their competitors and that

329
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:15,600
non-compete comes at the pay bump to compensate for it.

330
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:19,720
The current anti-work phenomenon is not something that could happen in any socialist system.

331
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:22,480
In a stateless moneyless classless society forget it.

332
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:26,040
Why should you have access to the commune stores if you aren't contributing to it?

333
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:28,100
Either you'll be kicked out or the commune will collapse.

334
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:33,280
In a more national socialist or national syndicalist society the economy is almost always restructured

335
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:37,600
into a neo-guildist system where you must be a member of the national trade union in

336
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:41,320
order to even qualify for work and then the powers that be will direct your production

337
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,600
for the good of the nation or the people or whatever.

338
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,200
You will never own your labor.

339
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:47,020
Your labor will belong to the collective.

340
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:51,260
Soviet Russia, Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy all implemented their command economies in

341
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:55,440
this way with some minor variations and communist China is doing the same right now.

342
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,420
But none of this is liberal economics.

343
00:13:57,420 --> 00:14:01,180
None of this is anything close to free market capitalism and only when you have a sufficiently

344
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:05,420
free market do individuals have the freedom to quit jobs, make lateral moves or start

345
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:06,420
businesses of their own.

346
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:10,900
The people at r slash anti-work are literally too stupid to understand that they're cheering

347
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:14,060
for socialism while performing liberal praxis.

348
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:15,060
Please come into work.

349
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:16,060
We are short staffed.

350
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:17,060
No, fuck you.

351
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:18,060
I'm busy.

352
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:19,060
Well then you're fired jackass.

353
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:20,060
Don't come back.

354
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:21,060
Okay, I pull up.

355
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:24,740
You and all your friends.

356
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:25,740
I got baited.

357
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:27,100
I got baited guys.
