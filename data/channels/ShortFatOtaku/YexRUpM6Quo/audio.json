{"text": " Welcome to the channel Generation Hope, making the world a better place, one story at a time. New videos Monday, Wednesday, Friday, 314,000 subscribers, and their videos regularly get more views than that. And jeez, look at these thumbnails, like, that's an awful Photoshop job. What's with that guy's mouth? Oh my God. It almost seems like it's AI-generated, caught-on-footage videos with these titles and the way that it looks. Well, in any case, you can see exactly what kind of channel this is. You have Bully Tells Kid Meet Me Outside, Plumber Scams Wife, Wife Fakes Cancer, etc. etc. These are all videos that seem to talk about real-life events where somebody's being ridiculous and then they get their comeuppance at the end. And videos like this are kind of cathartic, you know? When you see a viral TikTok where a person is raging and they get thrown out of a store and everyone clapped. Of course they did. They all clapped. But it kind of feels good. It hits a certain spot in our monkey brains. And this seems to be a channel that just manufactures those videos repeatedly. But if you were to actually look over the various dates that these videos were uploaded, you'll notice that there's one that's missing. And in fact, I have the missing video right here. It's currently set to private. Video unavailable. What happened here? I got that URL because the video is linked on various forums and websites, including mainstream social media. And as we can see, the title of the video is racist Karen whips black boys for playing basketball. What happens next is shocking. Oh my fucking God. Thankfully the internet never forgets. So somebody uploaded a copy of it because of course they did. All right, let's watch this shit guys. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, Oh my fucking...

Even your father got scared Yes, really Look These two are like the same age. You may be too young to remember But your father and I used to have a crazy white neighbor who used to always bother us just because we were black America he tried to get us evicted He lied and said that we would play our music too loud and that we damaged his property But you know what your father and I never let him win Weren't you scared? We had black lives matter on our side. It's terrifying having a crazy white neighbor trying to mess up your life But it's not about being scared. It's about standing up for yourself while being scared But it's a hard model, I don't know if I can do it. I'm stuck in this room. Sure Roy You're not these people need the paycheck.

Holy shit, okay Listen, I don't know if you guys know but us white people we just walk around with whips, you know Just in case slavery comes back. We're always prepared for that shit. Okay We tuck them away in our in our pockets in our purses Jesus I don't know what in the fuck the person who made this video is thinking it was even a person That did a human aside from the actors even touch this or is it all like AI generated like the scripts? There's like a drone camera going around just like okay time to record with that right now Don't you touch him or I will knock your teeth out if you're hitting his legs Help he just bails You disabled crippled piece of trash No one's coming for you you're not worth it you and your kind Now it's been what 180 years since slavery was abolished And I'm gonna give you a lash for every year That that god-given right was taken away got me I don't care I wonder what how that the actress files were saying the shoes won't break my spirit My mom told me not to be afraid of evil people like you and where's your mama now, huh? It's just you and me So let's have a little fun. She is having fun with this role Here's my oh, yeah Nobody messes with my boy like that lady You ought to be ashamed of yourself Vince call the cops and tell them that there's a lunatic at the park going around whipping people I'm gonna punch this this bitch Yeah, we have a hate crime at Greensboro Park. I hate crime one to be fair. Yes, it is this time Baby, are you okay? Yes, mom. She me a few times, but I didn't let her break my spirit or scare me away Just like you told me to do. Yeah good I'm glad you didn't let evil win. Your father would be so proud that thing has a father. Shut it I'm not through with you yet. I'm gonna make sure you go to jail for a long time Who do you think they're gonna believe huh a criminal or an innocent white lady? Don't worry about that I was recording the entire time you were attacking Roy now. We have all the evidence. We need to lock you up. Yeah She Ain't even fighting man. She's just You know, even with that video against me, you're not winning a trial. They're gonna rule in my favor. They always do Okay, they know that you people are criminals and liars and crack dealers lady I don't know why you have so much hate in your heart, but good will always win over because the script says so Quite I'm running out of patience with you. Trust me. You don't want her to run out of patience Oh Hey the cops are here Once the cops arrived Vince showed them the video evidence of Mallory whipping Roy Mallory was arrested and sent to jail everyone claps However, Roy and Vince continued to enjoy playing basketball without anyone bothering them again It's good to treat everyone with what you standing up. It was all fake It's okay to stand up for yourself when someone treats you bad, even if it's scary Hmm Like That feels like it should have been a a cartoon PSA For like six year olds or something, you know but no someone actually filmed that and Edited it and put it up with the music and the acting and and the script now this video has been taken down off the channel Um, probably because it's even for a channel like this It's just too over-the-top and I get it if you're gonna make a PSA for kids I don't even know who the fuck is the same for let's assume it's kids If you're making PSA for kids, you have to make the conflict very exaggerated because this is not how Real racism in 2022 operates. You're not gonna get an angry white lady with a whip Attacking black people on the basketball court. It's the most distilled form of all of the various like viral tik-toks of Crazy people screaming slurs and getting recorded and then getting arrested or like starting fights in restaurants or whatever That's what this channel basically is and I guess what what this is is these people here generation Hope they figured out that there is an audience for these kind of viral videos. So they're like fuck it We'll just make them What does make? Videos that are like aped off of actual real-life viral videos and will turn them into public service Announcements and we'll write them for five-year-olds with brain damage Racist cops arrest black family what happens next is shocking wait cop mistreats black mother What happens next is shocking evil son? Poisons mother for her money. What happens next is shocking They're just they're using the same title for each one of these dude I did decide to look this up and last summer on The New York Times There was an article done on this channel the internet demands uplifting videos So he stages them dar mon and other wholesome channels combine the high-definition Slickness of today's at YouTube content with the feel of a corporate training video It's all people being assholes simulated assholes and they're getting their simulated co-op Watch enough of man's videos and you can't help noticing how ruthlessly and tactically they employ up-to-the-minute caricatures and stereotypes Fine-tuned to soar within YouTube's algorithm numerous videos rip off the theme of white Karen's accusing black men of crimes These are stories we already know having watched the real-life versions go viral man recognizing our appetite for more Obliges by staging it but he also comforts us by ensuring that the antagonists always get their comeuppance the smooth conclusion We're denied in the real world and he flatters us by making the problematic character So obviously wrong that we have no choice but to identify with goodness and often to feel bizarrely Moved by the uplifting outcome. We always knew was coming like this has been kind of fun and goofy That video was fucking ridiculous and I understand now why they took it down because holy shit I don't think you can make the claim that we live in this perpetually terminally racist society where the white patriarchy rules over everyone and all white people are just Fucking devils when there is so little Racism that people have to stage it for YouTube videos to satisfy that demand of bad people getting their comeuppance I do think it says something about the state of our world if you have to stage Racism for racism to be relevant and also that there is such an appetite for anti-racism that channels like this can Survive and thrive on the internet. No, I'm gonna do here. I'm gonna start a Kickstarter I want you guys all to donate to the Kickstarter. I'm gonna do a series of PSA is like this but it's gonna be for gamers Okay how gamers are oppressed and we're gonna do like Gamer kids sitting down playing games and then like mean girls come up and beat the shit out of them I'm gonna do it. I can hear the music in my head already You have like the slow piano when the kid goes home with like a black eye and is that his Super Nintendo cartridge is broken This is gonna go gangbusters guys. All right, that's what I've got for you today. Hope you enjoyed it Hope you enjoyed the ridiculousness That is generation Hope as always I'm on the gaming channel tonight to game boomers and I will see you there or I'll see you next time Have a good one.
