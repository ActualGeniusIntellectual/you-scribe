0	11240	Welcome to the channel Generation Hope, making the world a better place, one story at a time.
11240	18440	New videos Monday, Wednesday, Friday, 314,000 subscribers, and their videos regularly get
18440	19760	more views than that.
19760	23840	And jeez, look at these thumbnails, like, that's an awful Photoshop job.
23840	25240	What's with that guy's mouth?
25240	26240	Oh my God.
26240	31960	It almost seems like it's AI-generated, caught-on-footage videos with these titles and the way that
31960	32960	it looks.
32960	35660	Well, in any case, you can see exactly what kind of channel this is.
35660	41040	You have Bully Tells Kid Meet Me Outside, Plumber Scams Wife, Wife Fakes Cancer, etc.
41040	42040	etc.
42040	48000	These are all videos that seem to talk about real-life events where somebody's being ridiculous
48000	50060	and then they get their comeuppance at the end.
50060	51920	And videos like this are kind of cathartic, you know?
51920	55360	When you see a viral TikTok where a person is raging and they get thrown out of a store
55360	56440	and everyone clapped.
56440	57440	Of course they did.
57440	58440	They all clapped.
58440	59960	But it kind of feels good.
59960	62760	It hits a certain spot in our monkey brains.
62760	67880	And this seems to be a channel that just manufactures those videos repeatedly.
67880	71560	But if you were to actually look over the various dates that these videos were uploaded,
71560	73040	you'll notice that there's one that's missing.
73040	75320	And in fact, I have the missing video right here.
75320	76860	It's currently set to private.
76860	77880	Video unavailable.
77880	78880	What happened here?
78880	83120	I got that URL because the video is linked on various forums and websites, including
83120	84320	mainstream social media.
84320	91960	And as we can see, the title of the video is racist Karen whips black boys for playing
91960	93320	basketball.
93320	95760	What happens next is shocking.
95760	98440	Oh my fucking God.
98440	100040	Thankfully the internet never forgets.
100040	103440	So somebody uploaded a copy of it because of course they did.
103440	107240	All right, let's watch this shit guys.

328540	332080	Man, we're not giving you our ball. That's stealing. It's our ball
332460	339160	If you don't give me that ball right now, I'm gonna call the police and tell them that you assaulted me
339760	345140	Why would you lie like that? I've done nothing wrong to you. Who do you think they're gonna believe, huh?

359140	361140	Jesus
362080	364080	Oh
364660	368860	Okay, hold on this is like this is like if you asked Twitter to
369780	372820	Create a racist woman. This is who they would create
376860	378860	Now that's a good little slave
380100	387340	Wait, is this like a BDSM thing? Oh my god my ball you got issues lady get out
388060	390060	Get out
390760	392760	Come on
395840	403000	Don't fucking drop a man don't don't tip him over that's what I thought. I hope I never see those thugs running around my neighborhood again
407240	409240	Jesus Christ
412240	414240	Everybody get up. It's now okay
417280	419280	Hey baby, how was your day?

427400	429400	It's fine
429560	431880	It's nothing. I'm just tired
433000	438740	Roy some awful acting, you know, I'm your mother and mothers always know when their children are lying to them
439240	441920	Talk to me. Yes Queen. What's the matter?
441920	449740	This racist white lady was calling me name
451900	453900	Wait a second, wait a second
456700	460760	This racist white hold on he he fucks the line up
460760	468020	He says racy instead of racist and they they put it in the subtitle. Well, I just reshoot the scene dude
468480	473440	Calling me names and Brendan to call the cops if I didn't leave the basketball court. I didn't do nothing
475040	481300	When did this happen just now? Yes me and Vince were playing and she just gave it to us screaming at us
487940	489940	Dude you're like 35 Roy. I
491120	497160	Know that you miss your father and that everything has been crazy since the accident. I miss him, too
498020	505120	He always knew what to say when something bad happened. But unfortunately, he's his music dude
505640	506780	Roy
506780	510440	You might be disabled, but you can still stand up for yourself
510440	515120	If somebody is pushing you around and trying to intimidate you don't let them do that
515640	518600	You should let them know that they shouldn't be doing that. You got it
519760	523520	You tell them I know they don't attack all of this is scary
523520	529260	I get scared you get scared, but that doesn't mean you don't stand up for yourself. Okay?
529940	531940	Even your father got scared
533420	535420	Yes, really
536780	537920	Look
537920	540900	These two are like the same age. You may be too young to remember
541580	549660	But your father and I used to have a crazy white neighbor who used to always bother us just because we were black
550740	552740	America he tried to get us evicted
553120	559000	He lied and said that we would play our music too loud and that we damaged his property
559440	563520	But you know what your father and I never let him win
564480	571560	Weren't you scared? We had black lives matter on our side. It's terrifying having a crazy white neighbor trying to mess up your life
572200	578320	But it's not about being scared. It's about standing up for yourself while being scared
578980	584060	But it's a hard model, I don't know if I can do it. I'm stuck in this room. Sure Roy
584780	587580	You're not these people need the paycheck. You're capable
588420	590420	Someone do you like that?
591780	596100	Crazy white lady anymore. Oh my god, but you have a right to be outside
597020	599460	Don't let her take that from you. You got that
599980	604260	Yes, ma and call me right away the next time something like this happens
604800	608360	Nobody is gonna be out there messing with my boy. You're my baby

650220	651940	Earlier that day
651940	653940	Did they fuck up their own timeline?
654480	657040	Cuz it seems like this scene is gonna happen the next day
657040	662500	In fact, she's wearing different clothes like look at her. She has like this clothes and then in the previous day
663320	665080	She's wearing these clothes
665080	670480	So they have like they have the continuity right but they didn't put in the proper title card. Morning, sweetie

783320	787280	Listen, I don't know if you guys know but us white people we just walk around with whips, you know
787280	790560	Just in case slavery comes back. We're always prepared for that shit. Okay
792560	795760	We tuck them away in our in our pockets in our purses Jesus
795760	801180	I don't know what in the fuck the person who made this video is thinking it was even a person
801280	806540	That did a human aside from the actors even touch this or is it all like AI generated like the scripts?
806880	811700	There's like a drone camera going around just like okay time to record with that right now
817400	820940	Don't you touch him or I will knock your teeth out if you're hitting his legs
821440	823440	Help he just bails
824640	828160	You disabled crippled piece of trash
830180	836140	No one's coming for you you're not worth it you and your kind
839360	844600	Now it's been what 180 years since slavery was abolished
846160	849300	And I'm gonna give you a lash for every year
849960	854080	That that god-given right was taken away got me I don't care
854080	857920	I wonder what how that the actress files were saying the shoes won't break my spirit
858720	863680	My mom told me not to be afraid of evil people like you and where's your mama now, huh?
864240	866160	It's just you and me
866160	869360	So let's have a little fun. She is having fun with this role
870120	872120	Here's my oh, yeah
872940	875120	Nobody messes with my boy like that lady
875300	881980	You ought to be ashamed of yourself Vince call the cops and tell them that there's a lunatic at the park going around whipping people
881980	883980	I'm gonna punch this this bitch
884220	889460	Yeah, we have a hate crime at Greensboro Park. I hate crime one to be fair. Yes, it is this time
890860	897380	Baby, are you okay? Yes, mom. She me a few times, but I didn't let her break my spirit or scare me away
897580	899900	Just like you told me to do. Yeah good
899920	905800	I'm glad you didn't let evil win. Your father would be so proud that thing has a father. Shut it
906120	910440	I'm not through with you yet. I'm gonna make sure you go to jail for a long time
910520	917120	Who do you think they're gonna believe huh a criminal or an innocent white lady? Don't worry about that
917120	923160	I was recording the entire time you were attacking Roy now. We have all the evidence. We need to lock you up. Yeah
929900	931600	She
931600	933600	Ain't even fighting man. She's just
934000	939840	You know, even with that video against me, you're not winning a trial. They're gonna rule in my favor. They always do
940040	946280	Okay, they know that you people are criminals and liars and crack dealers lady
946280	953300	I don't know why you have so much hate in your heart, but good will always win over because the script says so
953760	958920	Quite I'm running out of patience with you. Trust me. You don't want her to run out of patience
958920	960920	Oh
960980	962980	Hey the cops are here
964020	968460	Once the cops arrived Vince showed them the video evidence of Mallory whipping Roy
969180	971780	Mallory was arrested and sent to jail everyone claps
972700	977740	However, Roy and Vince continued to enjoy playing basketball without anyone bothering them again
978500	982340	It's good to treat everyone with what you standing up. It was all fake
982340	986180	It's okay to stand up for yourself when someone treats you bad, even if it's scary
989580	991580	Hmm
992280	993980	Like
993980	998260	That feels like it should have been a a cartoon PSA
998940	1001180	For like six year olds or something, you know
1001460	1003940	but no someone actually filmed that and
1003940	1010080	Edited it and put it up with the music and the acting and and the script now this video has been taken down off the channel
1010660	1014620	Um, probably because it's even for a channel like this
1014620	1019840	It's just too over-the-top and I get it if you're gonna make a PSA for kids
1019840	1022560	I don't even know who the fuck is the same for let's assume it's kids
1022560	1027780	If you're making PSA for kids, you have to make the conflict very exaggerated because this is not how
1028520	1034280	Real racism in 2022 operates. You're not gonna get an angry white lady with a whip
1034740	1042560	Attacking black people on the basketball court. It's the most distilled form of all of the various like viral tik-toks of
1043100	1049300	Crazy people screaming slurs and getting recorded and then getting arrested or like starting fights in restaurants or whatever
1049300	1055140	That's what this channel basically is and I guess what what this is is these people here generation
1055140	1060240	Hope they figured out that there is an audience for these kind of viral videos. So they're like fuck it
1060380	1061500	We'll just make them
1061500	1062700	What does make?
1062700	1068260	Videos that are like aped off of actual real-life viral videos and will turn them into public service
1068480	1072240	Announcements and we'll write them for five-year-olds with brain damage
1074140	1079920	Racist cops arrest black family what happens next is shocking wait cop mistreats black mother
1080000	1082840	What happens next is shocking evil son?
1083380	1087240	Poisons mother for her money. What happens next is shocking
1087240	1089860	They're just they're using the same title for each one of these dude
1089860	1093060	I did decide to look this up and last summer on The New York Times
1093200	1097060	There was an article done on this channel the internet demands uplifting videos
1097080	1101320	So he stages them dar mon and other wholesome channels combine the high-definition
1101640	1105400	Slickness of today's at YouTube content with the feel of a corporate training video
1105700	1110820	It's all people being assholes simulated assholes and they're getting their simulated co-op
1111040	1118840	Watch enough of man's videos and you can't help noticing how ruthlessly and tactically they employ up-to-the-minute caricatures and stereotypes
1119560	1125700	Fine-tuned to soar within YouTube's algorithm numerous videos rip off the theme of white Karen's accusing black men of crimes
1125700	1132180	These are stories we already know having watched the real-life versions go viral man recognizing our appetite for more
1132640	1138920	Obliges by staging it but he also comforts us by ensuring that the antagonists always get their comeuppance the smooth conclusion
1138920	1142720	We're denied in the real world and he flatters us by making the problematic character
1142720	1148720	So obviously wrong that we have no choice but to identify with goodness and often to feel bizarrely
1148920	1154080	Moved by the uplifting outcome. We always knew was coming like this has been kind of fun and goofy
1154080	1159140	That video was fucking ridiculous and I understand now why they took it down because holy shit
1159140	1162380	I don't think you can make the claim that we live in this
1163140	1169480	perpetually terminally racist society where the white patriarchy rules over everyone and all white people are just
1169740	1172260	Fucking devils when there is so little
1172580	1178260	Racism that people have to stage it for YouTube videos to satisfy that demand of bad people getting their comeuppance
1178260	1183020	I do think it says something about the state of our world if you have to stage
1183680	1190520	Racism for racism to be relevant and also that there is such an appetite for anti-racism that channels like this can
1190640	1195000	Survive and thrive on the internet. No, I'm gonna do here. I'm gonna start a Kickstarter
