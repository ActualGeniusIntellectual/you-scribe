00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,240
Welcome to the channel Generation Hope, making the world a better place, one story at a time.

2
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:18,440
New videos Monday, Wednesday, Friday, 314,000 subscribers, and their videos regularly get

3
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:19,760
more views than that.

4
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:23,840
And jeez, look at these thumbnails, like, that's an awful Photoshop job.

5
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:25,240
What's with that guy's mouth?

6
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:26,240
Oh my God.

7
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:31,960
It almost seems like it's AI-generated, caught-on-footage videos with these titles and the way that

8
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:32,960
it looks.

9
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:35,660
Well, in any case, you can see exactly what kind of channel this is.

10
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:41,040
You have Bully Tells Kid Meet Me Outside, Plumber Scams Wife, Wife Fakes Cancer, etc.

11
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:42,040
etc.

12
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:48,000
These are all videos that seem to talk about real-life events where somebody's being ridiculous

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,060
and then they get their comeuppance at the end.

14
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:51,920
And videos like this are kind of cathartic, you know?

15
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:55,360
When you see a viral TikTok where a person is raging and they get thrown out of a store

16
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:56,440
and everyone clapped.

17
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:57,440
Of course they did.

18
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:58,440
They all clapped.

19
00:00:58,440 --> 00:00:59,960
But it kind of feels good.

20
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:02,760
It hits a certain spot in our monkey brains.

21
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:07,880
And this seems to be a channel that just manufactures those videos repeatedly.

22
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:11,560
But if you were to actually look over the various dates that these videos were uploaded,

23
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:13,040
you'll notice that there's one that's missing.

24
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:15,320
And in fact, I have the missing video right here.

25
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:16,860
It's currently set to private.

26
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:17,880
Video unavailable.

27
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:18,880
What happened here?

28
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:23,120
I got that URL because the video is linked on various forums and websites, including

29
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:24,320
mainstream social media.

30
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:31,960
And as we can see, the title of the video is racist Karen whips black boys for playing

31
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:33,320
basketball.

32
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:35,760
What happens next is shocking.

33
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:38,440
Oh my fucking God.

34
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:40,040
Thankfully the internet never forgets.

35
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:43,440
So somebody uploaded a copy of it because of course they did.

36
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:47,240
All right, let's watch this shit guys.

37
00:01:47,240 --> 00:02:11,200
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey,

40
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,480
Oh my fucking...

41
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:37,740
Like, I know the title.

42
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:41,800
I know the title told us, but I didn't expect that out the fucking gate.

43
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:46,180
Oh my God, okay, okay, okay, hold on, let's, let's try that again.

44
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:48,180
Hey

45

46
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:55,780

47
00:02:56,300 --> 00:03:01,500
Listen lady. We aren't breaking any laws by having fun here at the park. I won't let you intimidate us anymore

48
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:04,380
Are you talking back to me boy? I?

49
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,340
Guess you forgot who used to own your car

50
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:10,780
Right now

51
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:12,780

53
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:23,860
He just fucking bails out. Holy shit. Okay, um

By the way, man, I'm sorry to hear about your dad

58
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:53,100
Yeah, I heard about the car accident in the news Jesus

59
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:58,900
Okay, this guy's this guy's black and he's in a wheelchair and he just lost his dad

60
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:04,700
How many fucking depression points does this guy get is gonna be trans too? Hey, man, it's okay

61
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:09,100
I know I'm in a wheelchair now and I won't be able to live my dream of playing in the NBA

62
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:11,800
But he's me. My mom is still alive

63
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,560
grateful for that

64
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:17,080
Exposition for sure. I'm glad you're allowed to bro

65
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:20,560
That way I can keep trying to dunk on you

66
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:33,000
All right, all right, all right, okay get their feet work there I'm not quite Kobe, I'm sorry

68
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:41,100
Is that a cripple joke?

69
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,680
No, you can make the jokes I can't

70
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:49,560
Was that how it works? You can't do it. Look at these hood rats and fasting my neighborhood Jesus. I

71
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,400
Wish they all just went away

72
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:55,320
That way we could keep it pure like the good old days

73
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:58,320
Jesus good sure even talking to anybody just by herself

74
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:02,600
Hey

75
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:06,680
There are no criminals here. You know that loitering is illegal, right?

76
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:10,900
Not that your kind of people like to follow the rules, but as long as I'm here

77
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:16,340
I'm gonna make sure that this neighborhood is safe. Oh my god care being so rude lady. Yeah

78
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:20,380
We're not criminals for people just like you we live here

79
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:28,140
You do not live here. You filthy rat. Oh now give me that ball and get out of my neighborhood

80
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:32,080
Man, we're not giving you our ball. That's stealing. It's our ball

81
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:39,160
If you don't give me that ball right now, I'm gonna call the police and tell them that you assaulted me

82
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:45,140
Why would you lie like that? I've done nothing wrong to you. Who do you think they're gonna believe, huh?

83
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:49,740
Oh my god, like you or a sweet scared little white lady like me

84
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:55,560
Roy just give her the ball. Let's get out. You fucking cuck. It's not worth the trouble. Yeah

85
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:58,180
Listen to your friend Tyrone

86
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:01,140
Jesus

87
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:04,080
Oh

88
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:08,860
Okay, hold on this is like this is like if you asked Twitter to

89
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:12,820
Create a racist woman. This is who they would create

90
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:18,860
Now that's a good little slave

91
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:27,340
Wait, is this like a BDSM thing? Oh my god my ball you got issues lady get out

Come on

94
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:43,000
Don't fucking drop a man don't don't tip him over that's what I thought. I hope I never see those thugs running around my neighborhood again

95
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,240
Jesus Christ

96
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,240
Everybody get up. It's now okay

97
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:59,280
Hey baby, how was your day?

98
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:06,200
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa slow down there champ. Is everything okay?

99
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,400
It's fine

100
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:11,880
It's nothing. I'm just tired

101
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:18,740
Roy some awful acting, you know, I'm your mother and mothers always know when their children are lying to them

102
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:21,920
Talk to me. Yes Queen. What's the matter?

103
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:29,740
This racist white lady was calling me name

104
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:33,900
Wait a second, wait a second

105
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:40,760
This racist white hold on he he fucks the line up

106
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:48,020
He says racy instead of racist and they they put it in the subtitle. Well, I just reshoot the scene dude

107
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:53,440
Calling me names and Brendan to call the cops if I didn't leave the basketball court. I didn't do nothing

108
00:07:55,040 --> 00:08:01,300
When did this happen just now? Yes me and Vince were playing and she just gave it to us screaming at us

109
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:09,940
Dude you're like 35 Roy. I

110
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:17,160
Know that you miss your father and that everything has been crazy since the accident. I miss him, too

111
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:25,120
He always knew what to say when something bad happened. But unfortunately, he's his music dude

112
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:26,780
Roy

113
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:30,440
You might be disabled, but you can still stand up for yourself

114
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:35,120
If somebody is pushing you around and trying to intimidate you don't let them do that

115
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:38,600
You should let them know that they shouldn't be doing that. You got it

116
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:43,520
You tell them I know they don't attack all of this is scary

117
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:49,260
I get scared you get scared, but that doesn't mean you don't stand up for yourself. Okay?

118
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:51,940
Even your father got scared

119
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:55,420
Yes, really

120
00:08:56,780 --> 00:08:57,920
Look

121
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:00,900
These two are like the same age. You may be too young to remember

122
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:09,660
But your father and I used to have a crazy white neighbor who used to always bother us just because we were black

123
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:12,740
America he tried to get us evicted

124
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:19,000
He lied and said that we would play our music too loud and that we damaged his property

125
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:23,520
But you know what your father and I never let him win

126
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:31,560
Weren't you scared? We had black lives matter on our side. It's terrifying having a crazy white neighbor trying to mess up your life

127
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:38,320
But it's not about being scared. It's about standing up for yourself while being scared

128
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:44,060
But it's a hard model, I don't know if I can do it. I'm stuck in this room. Sure Roy

129
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:47,580
You're not these people need the paycheck. You're capable

130
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:50,420
Someone do you like that?

131
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:56,100
Crazy white lady anymore. Oh my god, but you have a right to be outside

132
00:09:57,020 --> 00:09:59,460
Don't let her take that from you. You got that

133
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:04,260
Yes, ma and call me right away the next time something like this happens

134
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:08,360
Nobody is gonna be out there messing with my boy. You're my baby

135
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:10,260
now

136
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:12,260
Go ahead. Get some rest

137
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:14,680
You've had a long day. All right

138
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,360
Ma I shit my pants. Can you help me out first?

139
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:20,360
Thanks so much for cheering me on

140
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:29,560
Let me just get in here

141
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:31,560
Oh

142
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:40,540
Good morning, sweetie the next day. Hold on. We're at 707. Okay

143
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:44,940
Here's the whip cracking scene which we haven't seen yet

144
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:51,940
Earlier that day

145
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:53,940
Did they fuck up their own timeline?

146
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:57,040
Cuz it seems like this scene is gonna happen the next day

147
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:02,500
In fact, she's wearing different clothes like look at her. She has like this clothes and then in the previous day

148
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:05,080
She's wearing these clothes

149
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:10,480
So they have like they have the continuity right but they didn't put in the proper title card. Morning, sweetie

150
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:13,800
You passed out like a rock. How did you sleep?

151
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,480
Good, I guess I was tired

152
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:18,920

153
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:26,220
Guess don't be too tired because I need you to give this a try. Oh my gosh

00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:32,980
Bob you bought me a new basketball. Yes, I did and I want you to go down to the basketball court and have some fun

155
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:35,500

00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:39,460
Remember what we talked about don't live in fear, honey

00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:42,980
I think he's actually older than her just a phone call away

158
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:45,820
The basketball court is five minutes down the street

159
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:52,840
And if you call me, I'll be there to go and have some fun. Okay. Okay, I'll go. Thanks so much mom. I love you

Hey Vince

164
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:11,800
New ball is what took you so long slowpoke, dude. Remember wheelchair. Okay

165
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:14,400
Okay, I see you got a new basketball

166
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:17,780
Want to play a game let's do it. All right, show me what you got

167
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:27,500
Here we go

168
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:38,460
She just has a fucking whip oh

169
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:42,420
My god

170
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:48,040
What did I tell you criminals about coming back to my neighborhood what the fuck just get out of here no Vince

171
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:50,040
I won't let her ruin our fun

172
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:55,760
Listen lady, we aren't breaking any laws by having fun here at the park. I won't let you intimidate us anymore

173
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:57,960
Are you talking back to me?

174
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,280
Holy shit, okay

175
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:07,280
Listen, I don't know if you guys know but us white people we just walk around with whips, you know

176
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:10,560
Just in case slavery comes back. We're always prepared for that shit. Okay

177
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:15,760
We tuck them away in our in our pockets in our purses Jesus

178
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:21,180
I don't know what in the fuck the person who made this video is thinking it was even a person

179
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:26,540
That did a human aside from the actors even touch this or is it all like AI generated like the scripts?

180
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:31,700
There's like a drone camera going around just like okay time to record with that right now

181
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:40,940
Don't you touch him or I will knock your teeth out if you're hitting his legs

182
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,440
Help he just bails

183
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:48,160
You disabled crippled piece of trash

184
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:56,140
No one's coming for you you're not worth it you and your kind

185
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:04,600
Now it's been what 180 years since slavery was abolished

186
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:09,300
And I'm gonna give you a lash for every year

187
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:14,080
That that god-given right was taken away got me I don't care

188
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:17,920
I wonder what how that the actress files were saying the shoes won't break my spirit

189
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:23,680
My mom told me not to be afraid of evil people like you and where's your mama now, huh?

190
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,160
It's just you and me

191
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:29,360
So let's have a little fun. She is having fun with this role

192
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:32,120
Here's my oh, yeah

193
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:35,120
Nobody messes with my boy like that lady

194
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:41,980
You ought to be ashamed of yourself Vince call the cops and tell them that there's a lunatic at the park going around whipping people

195
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:43,980
I'm gonna punch this this bitch

196
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:49,460
Yeah, we have a hate crime at Greensboro Park. I hate crime one to be fair. Yes, it is this time

197
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:57,380
Baby, are you okay? Yes, mom. She me a few times, but I didn't let her break my spirit or scare me away

198
00:14:57,580 --> 00:14:59,900
Just like you told me to do. Yeah good

199
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:05,800
I'm glad you didn't let evil win. Your father would be so proud that thing has a father. Shut it

200
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:10,440
I'm not through with you yet. I'm gonna make sure you go to jail for a long time

201
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:17,120
Who do you think they're gonna believe huh a criminal or an innocent white lady? Don't worry about that

202
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:23,160
I was recording the entire time you were attacking Roy now. We have all the evidence. We need to lock you up. Yeah

203
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:31,600
She

204
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,600
Ain't even fighting man. She's just

205
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:39,840
You know, even with that video against me, you're not winning a trial. They're gonna rule in my favor. They always do

206
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:46,280
Okay, they know that you people are criminals and liars and crack dealers lady

207
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:53,300
I don't know why you have so much hate in your heart, but good will always win over because the script says so

208
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:58,920
Quite I'm running out of patience with you. Trust me. You don't want her to run out of patience

209
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:00,920
Oh

210
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:02,980
Hey the cops are here

211
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:08,460
Once the cops arrived Vince showed them the video evidence of Mallory whipping Roy

212
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:11,780
Mallory was arrested and sent to jail everyone claps

213
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:17,740
However, Roy and Vince continued to enjoy playing basketball without anyone bothering them again

214
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:22,340
It's good to treat everyone with what you standing up. It was all fake

215
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:26,180
It's okay to stand up for yourself when someone treats you bad, even if it's scary

216
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:31,580
Hmm

217
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:33,980
Like

218
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:38,260
That feels like it should have been a a cartoon PSA

219
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:41,180
For like six year olds or something, you know

220
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:43,940
but no someone actually filmed that and

221
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:50,080
Edited it and put it up with the music and the acting and and the script now this video has been taken down off the channel

222
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:54,620
Um, probably because it's even for a channel like this

223
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:59,840
It's just too over-the-top and I get it if you're gonna make a PSA for kids

224
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:02,560
I don't even know who the fuck is the same for let's assume it's kids

225
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:07,780
If you're making PSA for kids, you have to make the conflict very exaggerated because this is not how

226
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:14,280
Real racism in 2022 operates. You're not gonna get an angry white lady with a whip

227
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:22,560
Attacking black people on the basketball court. It's the most distilled form of all of the various like viral tik-toks of

228
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:29,300
Crazy people screaming slurs and getting recorded and then getting arrested or like starting fights in restaurants or whatever

229
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:35,140
That's what this channel basically is and I guess what what this is is these people here generation

230
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:40,240
Hope they figured out that there is an audience for these kind of viral videos. So they're like fuck it

231
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:41,500
We'll just make them

232
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:42,700
What does make?

233
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:48,260
Videos that are like aped off of actual real-life viral videos and will turn them into public service

234
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:52,240
Announcements and we'll write them for five-year-olds with brain damage

235
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:59,920
Racist cops arrest black family what happens next is shocking wait cop mistreats black mother

236
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,840
What happens next is shocking evil son?

237
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:07,240
Poisons mother for her money. What happens next is shocking

238
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:09,860
They're just they're using the same title for each one of these dude

239
00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:13,060
I did decide to look this up and last summer on The New York Times

240
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:17,060
There was an article done on this channel the internet demands uplifting videos

241
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:21,320
So he stages them dar mon and other wholesome channels combine the high-definition

242
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:25,400
Slickness of today's at YouTube content with the feel of a corporate training video

243
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:30,820
It's all people being assholes simulated assholes and they're getting their simulated co-op

244
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:38,840
Watch enough of man's videos and you can't help noticing how ruthlessly and tactically they employ up-to-the-minute caricatures and stereotypes

245
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:45,700
Fine-tuned to soar within YouTube's algorithm numerous videos rip off the theme of white Karen's accusing black men of crimes

246
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:52,180
These are stories we already know having watched the real-life versions go viral man recognizing our appetite for more

247
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:58,920
Obliges by staging it but he also comforts us by ensuring that the antagonists always get their comeuppance the smooth conclusion

248
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:02,720
We're denied in the real world and he flatters us by making the problematic character

249
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:08,720
So obviously wrong that we have no choice but to identify with goodness and often to feel bizarrely

250
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:14,080
Moved by the uplifting outcome. We always knew was coming like this has been kind of fun and goofy

251
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:19,140
That video was fucking ridiculous and I understand now why they took it down because holy shit

252
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:22,380
I don't think you can make the claim that we live in this

253
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:29,480
perpetually terminally racist society where the white patriarchy rules over everyone and all white people are just

254
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:32,260
Fucking devils when there is so little

255
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:38,260
Racism that people have to stage it for YouTube videos to satisfy that demand of bad people getting their comeuppance

256
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:43,020
I do think it says something about the state of our world if you have to stage

257
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:50,520
Racism for racism to be relevant and also that there is such an appetite for anti-racism that channels like this can

258
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:55,000
Survive and thrive on the internet. No, I'm gonna do here. I'm gonna start a Kickstarter

259
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,240
I want you guys all to donate to the Kickstarter. I'm gonna do a series of

260
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:01,340
PSA is like this but it's gonna be for gamers

261
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:02,200
Okay

262
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:05,080
how gamers are oppressed and we're gonna do like

263
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:09,840
Gamer kids sitting down playing games and then like mean girls come up and beat the shit out of them

264
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:12,060
I'm gonna do it. I can hear the music in my head already

265
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:17,980
You have like the slow piano when the kid goes home with like a black eye and is that his Super Nintendo cartridge is broken

266
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:22,700
This is gonna go gangbusters guys. All right, that's what I've got for you today. Hope you enjoyed it

267
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:24,700
Hope you enjoyed the ridiculousness

268
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:25,980
That is generation

269
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:30,940
Hope as always I'm on the gaming channel tonight to game boomers and I will see you there or I'll see you next time

270
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:33,140
Have a good one. I love you
