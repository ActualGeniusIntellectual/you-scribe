Welcome to the channel Generation Hope, making the world a better place, one story at a time.

00:11.240 --> 00:18.440
New videos Monday, Wednesday, Friday, 314,000 subscribers, and their videos regularly get

00:18.440 --> 00:19.760
more views than that.

00:19.760 --> 00:23.840
And jeez, look at these thumbnails, like, that's an awful Photoshop job.

00:23.840 --> 00:25.240
What's with that guy's mouth?

00:25.240 --> 00:26.240
Oh my God.

00:26.240 --> 00:31.960
It almost seems like it's AI-generated, caught-on-footage videos with these titles and the way that

00:31.960 --> 00:32.960
it looks.

00:32.960 --> 00:35.660
Well, in any case, you can see exactly what kind of channel this is.

00:35.660 --> 00:41.040
You have Bully Tells Kid Meet Me Outside, Plumber Scams Wife, Wife Fakes Cancer, etc.

00:41.040 --> 00:42.040
etc.

00:42.040 --> 00:48.000
These are all videos that seem to talk about real-life events where somebody's being ridiculous

00:48.000 --> 00:50.060
and then they get their comeuppance at the end.

00:50.060 --> 00:51.920
And videos like this are kind of cathartic, you know?

00:51.920 --> 00:55.360
When you see a viral TikTok where a person is raging and they get thrown out of a store

00:55.360 --> 00:56.440
and everyone clapped.

00:56.440 --> 00:57.440
Of course they did.

00:57.440 --> 00:58.440
They all clapped.

00:58.440 --> 00:59.960
But it kind of feels good.

00:59.960 --> 01:02.760
It hits a certain spot in our monkey brains.

01:02.760 --> 01:07.880
And this seems to be a channel that just manufactures those videos repeatedly.

01:07.880 --> 01:11.560
But if you were to actually look over the various dates that these videos were uploaded,

01:11.560 --> 01:13.040
you'll notice that there's one that's missing.

01:13.040 --> 01:15.320
And in fact, I have the missing video right here.

01:15.320 --> 01:16.860
It's currently set to private.

01:16.860 --> 01:17.880
Video unavailable.

01:17.880 --> 01:18.880
What happened here?

01:18.880 --> 01:23.120
I got that URL because the video is linked on various forums and websites, including

01:23.120 --> 01:24.320
mainstream social media.

01:24.320 --> 01:31.960
And as we can see, the title of the video is racist Karen whips black boys for playing

01:31.960 --> 01:33.320
basketball.

01:33.320 --> 01:35.760
What happens next is shocking.

01:35.760 --> 01:38.440
Oh my fucking God.

01:38.440 --> 01:40.040
Thankfully the internet never forgets.

01:40.040 --> 01:43.440
So somebody uploaded a copy of it because of course they did.

01:43.440 --> 01:47.240
All right, let's watch this shit guys.

01:47.240 --> 02:11.200
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey,

02:33.800 --> 02:35.480
Oh my fucking...

02:35.480 --> 02:37.740
Like, I know the title.

02:37.740 --> 02:41.800
I know the title told us, but I didn't expect that out the fucking gate.

02:41.800 --> 02:46.180
Oh my God, okay, okay, okay, hold on, let's, let's try that again.

02:46.180 --> 02:48.180
Hey

02:48.580 --> 02:53.780

02:53.780 --> 02:55.780

02:56.300 --> 03:01.500
Listen lady. We aren't breaking any laws by having fun here at the park. I won't let you intimidate us anymore

03:01.660 --> 03:04.380
Are you talking back to me boy? I?

03:05.200 --> 03:07.340
Guess you forgot who used to own your car

03:08.780 --> 03:10.780

03:54.380 --> 03:58.900
Okay, this guy's this guy's black and he's in a wheelchair and he just lost his dad

03:58.980 --> 04:04.700
How many fucking depression points does this guy get is gonna be trans too? Hey, man, it's okay

04:04.700 --> 04:09.100
I know I'm in a wheelchair now and I won't be able to live my dream of playing in the NBA

04:09.100 --> 04:11.800
But he's me. My mom is still alive

04:12.560 --> 04:14.560
grateful for that

04:14.600 --> 04:17.080
Exposition for sure. I'm glad you're allowed to bro

04:18.220 --> 04:20.560

04:39.100 --> 04:41.100
Is that a cripple joke?

04:41.680 --> 04:43.680
No, you can make the jokes I can't

04:44.120 --> 04:49.560
Was that how it works? You can't do it. Look at these hood rats and fasting my neighborhood Jesus. I

04:50.400 --> 04:52.400
Wish they all just went away

04:52.660 --> 04:55.320
That way we could keep it pure like the good old days

04:55.960 --> 04:58.320
Jesus good sure even talking to anybody just by herself

05:01.080 --> 05:02.600
Hey

05:02.600 --> 05:06.680
There are no criminals here. You know that loitering is illegal, right?

05:06.820 --> 05:10.900
Not that your kind of people like to follow the rules, but as long as I'm here

05:10.900 --> 05:16.340
I'm gonna make sure that this neighborhood is safe. Oh my god care being so rude lady. Yeah

05:16.940 --> 05:20.380
We're not criminals for people just like you we live here

05:21.180 --> 05:28.140
You do not live here. You filthy rat. Oh now give me that ball and get out of my neighborhood

05:28.540 --> 05:32.080
Man, we're not giving you our ball. That's stealing. It's our ball

05:32.460 --> 05:39.160
If you don't give me that ball right now, I'm gonna call the police and tell them that you assaulted me

05:39.760 --> 05:45.140
Why would you lie like that? I've done nothing wrong to you. Who do you think they're gonna believe, huh?

05:45.140 --> 05:49.740
Oh my god, like you or a sweet scared little white lady like me

05:50.380 --> 05:55.560
Roy just give her the ball. Let's get out. You fucking cuck. It's not worth the trouble. Yeah

Jesus

06:02.080 --> 06:04.080
Oh

06:04.660 --> 06:08.860
Okay, hold on this is like this is like if you asked Twitter to

06:09.780 --> 06:12.820
Create a racist woman. This is who they would create

06:16.860 --> 06:18.860
Now that's a good little slave

06:20.100 --> 06:27.340
Wait, is this like a BDSM thing? Oh my god my ball you got issues lady get out

06:28.060 --> 06:30.060
Get out

06:30.760 --> 06:32.760

06:35.840 --> 06:43.000
Don't fucking drop a man don't don't tip him over that's what I thought. I hope I never see those thugs running around my neighborhood again

06:47.240 --> 06:49.240
Jesus Christ

06:52.240 --> 06:54.240
Everybody get up. It's now okay

06:57.280 --> 06:59.280
Hey baby, how was your day?

07:00.720 --> 07:06.200
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa slow down there champ. Is everything okay?

07:07.400 --> 07:09.400
It's fine

07:09.560 --> 07:11.880
It's nothing. I'm just tired

07:13.000 --> 07:18.740
Roy some awful acting, you know, I'm your mother and mothers always know when their children are lying to them

07:19.240 --> 07:21.920
Talk to me. Yes Queen. What's the matter?

07:21.920 --> 07:29.740
This racist white lady was calling me name

07:31.900 --> 07:33.900
Wait a second, wait a second

07:36.700 --> 07:40.760
This racist white hold on he he fucks the line up

07:40.760 --> 07:48.020
He says racy instead of racist and they they put it in the subtitle. Well, I just reshoot the scene dude

07:48.480 --> 07:53.440
Calling me names and Brendan to call the cops if I didn't leave the basketball court. I didn't do nothing

07:55.040 --> 08:01.300
When did this happen just now? Yes me and Vince were playing and she just gave it to us screaming at us

08:07.940 --> 08:09.940
Dude you're like 35 Roy. I

08:11.120 --> 08:17.160
Know that you miss your father and that everything has been crazy since the accident. I miss him, too

08:18.020 --> 08:25.120
He always knew what to say when something bad happened. But unfortunately, he's his music dude

08:25.640 --> 08:26.780
Roy

08:26.780 --> 08:30.440
You might be disabled, but you can still stand up for yourself

08:30.440 --> 08:35.120
If somebody is pushing you around and trying to intimidate you don't let them do that

08:35.640 --> 08:38.600
You should let them know that they shouldn't be doing that. You got it

08:39.760 --> 08:43.520
You tell them I know they don't attack all of this is scary

08:43.520 --> 08:49.260
I get scared you get scared, but that doesn't mean you don't stand up for yourself. Okay?

08:49.940 --> 08:51.940
Even your father got scared

08:53.420 --> 08:55.420
Yes, really

08:56.780 --> 08:57.920
Look

08:57.920 --> 09:00.900
These two are like the same age. You may be too young to remember

09:01.580 --> 09:09.660
But your father and I used to have a crazy white neighbor who used to always bother us just because we were black

09:10.740 --> 09:12.740
America he tried to get us evicted

09:13.120 --> 09:19.000
He lied and said that we would play our music too loud and that we damaged his property

09:19.440 --> 09:23.520
But you know what your father and I never let him win

09:24.480 --> 09:31.560
Weren't you scared? We had black lives matter on our side. It's terrifying having a crazy white neighbor trying to mess up your life

09:32.200 --> 09:38.320
But it's not about being scared. It's about standing up for yourself while being scared

09:38.980 --> 09:44.060
But it's a hard model, I don't know if I can do it. I'm stuck in this room. Sure Roy

09:44.780 --> 09:47.580
You're not these people need the paycheck. You're capable

09:48.420 --> 09:50.420
Someone do you like that?

09:51.780 --> 09:56.100
Crazy white lady anymore. Oh my god, but you have a right to be outside

09:57.020 --> 09:59.460
Don't let her take that from you. You got that

09:59.980 --> 10:04.260
Yes, ma and call me right away the next time something like this happens

10:04.800 --> 10:08.360
Nobody is gonna be out there messing with my boy. You're my baby

10:09.060 --> 10:10.260
now

10:10.260 --> 10:12.260
Go ahead. Get some rest

10:12.520 --> 10:14.680
You've had a long day. All right

10:15.360 --> 10:17.360
Ma I shit my pants. Can you help me out first?

10:18.360 --> 10:20.360

10:42.860 --> 10:44.940

10:50.220 --> 10:51.940
Earlier that day

10:51.940 --> 10:53.940
Did they fuck up their own timeline?

10:54.480 --> 10:57.040
Cuz it seems like this scene is gonna happen the next day

10:57.040 --> 11:02.500
In fact, she's wearing different clothes like look at her. She has like this clothes and then in the previous day

11:03.320 --> 11:05.080
She's wearing these clothes

11:05.080 --> 11:10.480
So they have like they have the continuity right but they didn't put in the proper title card. Morning, sweetie

11:10.920 --> 11:13.800

13:12.560 --> 13:15.760
We tuck them away in our in our pockets in our purses Jesus

13:15.760 --> 13:21.180
I don't know what in the fuck the person who made this video is thinking it was even a person

13:21.280 --> 13:26.540
That did a human aside from the actors even touch this or is it all like AI generated like the scripts?

13:26.880 --> 13:31.700
There's like a drone camera going around just like okay time to record with that right now

13:37.400 --> 13:40.940
Don't you touch him or I will knock your teeth out if you're hitting his legs

13:41.440 --> 13:43.440
Help he just bails

13:44.640 --> 13:48.160
You disabled crippled piece of trash

13:50.180 --> 13:56.140
No one's coming for you you're not worth it you and your kind

13:59.360 --> 14:04.600
Now it's been what 180 years since slavery was abolished

14:06.160 --> 14:09.300
And I'm gonna give you a lash for every year

14:09.960 --> 14:14.080
That that god-given right was taken away got me I don't care

14:14.080 --> 14:17.920
I wonder what how that the actress files were saying the shoes won't break my spirit

14:18.720 --> 14:23.680
My mom told me not to be afraid of evil people like you and where's your mama now, huh?

14:24.240 --> 14:26.160
It's just you and me

14:26.160 --> 14:29.360
So let's have a little fun. She is having fun with this role

14:30.120 --> 14:32.120
Here's my oh, yeah

14:32.940 --> 14:35.120
Nobody messes with my boy like that lady

14:35.300 --> 14:41.980
You ought to be ashamed of yourself Vince call the cops and tell them that there's a lunatic at the park going around whipping people

14:41.980 --> 14:43.980
I'm gonna punch this this bitch

14:44.220 --> 14:49.460
Yeah, we have a hate crime at Greensboro Park. I hate crime one to be fair. Yes, it is this time

14:50.860 --> 14:57.380
Baby, are you okay? Yes, mom. She me a few times, but I didn't let her break my spirit or scare me away

14:57.580 --> 14:59.900
Just like you told me to do. Yeah good

14:59.920 --> 15:05.800
I'm glad you didn't let evil win. Your father would be so proud that thing has a father. Shut it

15:06.120 --> 15:10.440
I'm not through with you yet. I'm gonna make sure you go to jail for a long time

15:10.520 --> 15:17.120
Who do you think they're gonna believe huh a criminal or an innocent white lady? Don't worry about that

15:17.120 --> 15:23.160
I was recording the entire time you were attacking Roy now. We have all the evidence. We need to lock you up. Yeah

15:29.900 --> 15:31.600
She

15:31.600 --> 15:33.600
Ain't even fighting man. She's just

15:34.000 --> 15:39.840
You know, even with that video against me, you're not winning a trial. They're gonna rule in my favor. They always do

15:40.040 --> 15:46.280
Okay, they know that you people are criminals and liars and crack dealers lady

15:46.280 --> 15:53.300
I don't know why you have so much hate in your heart, but good will always win over because the script says so

15:53.760 --> 15:58.920
Quite I'm running out of patience with you. Trust me. You don't want her to run out of patience

15:58.920 --> 16:00.920
Oh

16:00.980 --> 16:02.980
Hey the cops are here

16:04.020 --> 16:08.460
Once the cops arrived Vince showed them the video evidence of Mallory whipping Roy

16:09.180 --> 16:11.780
Mallory was arrested and sent to jail everyone claps

16:12.700 --> 16:17.740
However, Roy and Vince continued to enjoy playing basketball without anyone bothering them again

16:18.500 --> 16:22.340
It's good to treat everyone with what you standing up. It was all fake

16:22.340 --> 16:26.180
It's okay to stand up for yourself when someone treats you bad, even if it's scary

16:29.580 --> 16:31.580
Hmm

16:32.280 --> 16:33.980
Like

16:33.980 --> 16:38.260
That feels like it should have been a a cartoon PSA

16:38.940 --> 16:41.180
For like six year olds or something, you know

16:41.460 --> 16:43.940
but no someone actually filmed that and

16:43.940 --> 16:50.080
Edited it and put it up with the music and the acting and and the script now this video has been taken down off the channel

16:50.660 --> 16:54.620
Um, probably because it's even for a channel like this

16:54.620 --> 16:59.840
It's just too over-the-top and I get it if you're gonna make a PSA for kids

16:59.840 --> 17:02.560
I don't even know who the fuck is the same for let's assume it's kids

17:02.560 --> 17:07.780
If you're making PSA for kids, you have to make the conflict very exaggerated because this is not how

17:08.520 --> 17:14.280
Real racism in 2022 operates. You're not gonna get an angry white lady with a whip

17:14.740 --> 17:22.560
Attacking black people on the basketball court. It's the most distilled form of all of the various like viral tik-toks of

17:23.100 --> 17:29.300
Crazy people screaming slurs and getting recorded and then getting arrested or like starting fights in restaurants or whatever

17:29.300 --> 17:35.140
That's what this channel basically is and I guess what what this is is these people here generation

17:35.140 --> 17:40.240
Hope they figured out that there is an audience for these kind of viral videos. So they're like fuck it

17:40.380 --> 17:41.500
We'll just make them

17:41.500 --> 17:42.700
What does make?

17:42.700 --> 17:48.260
Videos that are like aped off of actual real-life viral videos and will turn them into public service

17:48.480 --> 17:52.240
Announcements and we'll write them for five-year-olds with brain damage

17:54.140 --> 17:59.920
Racist cops arrest black family what happens next is shocking wait cop mistreats black mother

18:00.000 --> 18:02.840
What happens next is shocking evil son?

18:03.380 --> 18:07.240
Poisons mother for her money. What happens next is shocking

18:07.240 --> 18:09.860
They're just they're using the same title for each one of these dude

18:09.860 --> 18:13.060
I did decide to look this up and last summer on The New York Times

18:13.200 --> 18:17.060
There was an article done on this channel the internet demands uplifting videos

18:17.080 --> 18:21.320
So he stages them dar mon and other wholesome channels combine the high-definition

18:21.640 --> 18:25.400
Slickness of today's at YouTube content with the feel of a corporate training video

18:25.700 --> 18:30.820
It's all people being assholes simulated assholes and they're getting their simulated co-op

18:31.040 --> 18:38.840
Watch enough of man's videos and you can't help noticing how ruthlessly and tactically they employ up-to-the-minute caricatures and stereotypes

18:39.560 --> 18:45.700
Fine-tuned to soar within YouTube's algorithm numerous videos rip off the theme of white Karen's accusing black men of crimes

18:45.700 --> 18:52.180
These are stories we already know having watched the real-life versions go viral man recognizing our appetite for more

18:52.640 --> 18:58.920
Obliges by staging it but he also comforts us by ensuring that the antagonists always get their comeuppance the smooth conclusion

18:58.920 --> 19:02.720
We're denied in the real world and he flatters us by making the problematic character

19:02.720 --> 19:08.720
So obviously wrong that we have no choice but to identify with goodness and often to feel bizarrely

19:08.920 --> 19:14.080
Moved by the uplifting outcome. We always knew was coming like this has been kind of fun and goofy

19:14.080 --> 19:19.140
That video was fucking ridiculous and I understand now why they took it down because holy shit

19:19.140 --> 19:22.380
I don't think you can make the claim that we live in this

19:23.140 --> 19:29.480
perpetually terminally racist society where the white patriarchy rules over everyone and all white people are just

19:29.740 --> 19:32.260
Fucking devils when there is so little

19:32.580 --> 19:38.260
Racism that people have to stage it for YouTube videos to satisfy that demand of bad people getting their comeuppance

19:38.260 --> 19:43.020
I do think it says something about the state of our world if you have to stage

19:43.680 --> 19:50.520
Racism for racism to be relevant and also that there is such an appetite for anti-racism that channels like this can

19:50.640 --> 19:55.000
Survive and thrive on the internet. No, I'm gonna do here. I'm gonna start a Kickstarter

19:55.000 --> 19:58.240
I want you guys all to donate to the Kickstarter. I'm gonna do a series of

19:58.800 --> 20:01.340
PSA is like this but it's gonna be for gamers

20:01.520 --> 20:02.200
Okay

20:02.200 --> 20:05.080
how gamers are oppressed and we're gonna do like

20:05.200 --> 20:09.840
Gamer kids sitting down playing games and then like mean girls come up and beat the shit out of them

20:09.860 --> 20:12.060
I'm gonna do it. I can hear the music in my head already

20:12.180 --> 20:17.980
You have like the slow piano when the kid goes home with like a black eye and is that his Super Nintendo cartridge is broken

20:17.980 --> 20:22.700
This is gonna go gangbusters guys. All right, that's what I've got for you today. Hope you enjoyed it

20:22.700 --> 20:24.700
Hope you enjoyed the ridiculousness

20:24.700 --> 20:25.980
That is generation

20:25.980 --> 20:30.940
Hope as always I'm on the gaming channel tonight to game boomers and I will see you there or I'll see you next time

20:31.140 --> 20:33.140
Have a good one. I love you
