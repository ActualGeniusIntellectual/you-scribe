00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,980
Today's video is another case of somebody sending me a submission for TikTok Tuesday

2
00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:13,600
and me realizing this is actually worth going over in more detail.

3
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:17,220
The broader topic is about cancel culture, and though I've spoken about it before on

4
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:20,140
this channel, it's been a while, and there's new stuff to talk about.

5
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:21,940
Let's start with Viral TikTok.

6
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:26,380
This clip blew up over the last weekend, netting 650,000 views.

7
00:00:51,940 --> 00:01:20,820
So

8
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:25,540
the story is, the one recording the video, Lizzie Ash Music, claims that this guy grabbed

9
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:29,140
her wig while walking by on the streets of New York at night.

10
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:32,540
The third person in the video is the guy's friend, who knows that his pal is looking

11
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:35,240
like an asshole and is begging him to apologize.

12
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:38,740
But the guy doesn't seem to know what's going on, he's falling forward, he's ignoring

13
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:42,100
people talking to him, when he does reply, he doesn't seem to understand what's being

14
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:43,100
said to him.

15
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:46,100
It's very clear that this dude is drunk and stumbling home from the bar at the end

16
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:47,100
of the night.

17
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:49,600
But he probably actually did snatch her wig.

18
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:53,620
With a bright fucking beacon like that, that's something a drunk guy looking for a laugh

19
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:54,620
might try to do.

20
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:58,060
Plus, the fact that his friend is on camera trying to defuse the situation by asking him

21
00:01:58,060 --> 00:02:00,980
to apologize, yeah, I don't think it's too likely that she's just making the whole

22
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:01,980
story up.

23
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:05,620
We didn't see it happen, but it is believable, and yeah, that's a shitty thing to do.

24
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:08,420
It probably even counts as some form of assault, legally.

25
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:12,680
She showed off in a later video that the wig is actually quite attached to her hair and

26
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:14,700
did real damage being ripped off.

27
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:19,140
But look at this.

28
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:23,420
If you pull the wig, it looks like it's going to come off, right?

29
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:29,160
And then it gets stuck because it has combs in it.

30
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:33,200
So he ended up pulling my hair in order to officially take it off.

31
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:38,100
You have to then yank down and then try your best.

32
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:41,100
It's still not coming off.

33
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:45,780
He dead pulled my whole wig off.

34
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:49,620
But as a result of the video going viral, this guy got his life destroyed.

35
00:02:49,620 --> 00:03:15,420
He goes into further detail in a third video.

36
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:53,180
The internet tracked him down and discovered he was an associate at the law firm Leader

37
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:57,260
Burcon Kalau and Silverstein.

38
00:03:57,260 --> 00:03:59,860
The firm put out a public statement that reads,

39
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:04,960
We have been made aware of a video of a non-work-related incident involving one of our associates circulating

40
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,020
on social media.

41
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:11,300
We take seriously any inappropriate behavior by any employee, whether inside or outside

42
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:12,300
the workplace.

43
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:14,100
This associate is no longer with the firm.

44
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:16,660
Now listen, I'm not going to sit here and simp for this guy.

45
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:20,260
Even if grabbing the wig isn't something he would have done when he was sober.

46
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:21,780
Even if he doesn't remember doing it.

47
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:28,140
You are responsible for what you do when you're drunk because you chose to get drunk.

48
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:29,540
This applies to drunk driving.

49
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:34,100
And yes, unpopular opinion alert, it applies to a good chunk of sexual activity as well.

50
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:39,320
So obviously, it also applies to when you yank a random woman's wig off in the street.

51
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:42,480
He committed assault, she went to the cops, which is exactly what she should do.

52
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,480
That's her legal right.

53
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:45,100
Now look at the wording of that statement again.

54
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:50,180
We take seriously any inappropriate behavior by any employee, whether inside or outside

55
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:51,280
the workplace.

56
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,780
Any inappropriate behavior?

57
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:57,200
If this guy tells an edgy joke in the privacy of his own home to his old high school friends,

58
00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:01,000
and the law firm has a fucking spy drone hovering at the apartment window recording it, should

59
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
he be fired then?

60
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,520
What is the limit on this shit?

61
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:07,760
I mentioned in my video about the City Bike Karen that I hate how our society has decided

62
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:11,480
that a workplace can just police random workers off the clock and it's no big deal.

63
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:14,620
If you're not a public face of the company, if you're not the CEO or something, if you're

64
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:18,180
just a cog in the machine and you're not getting paid on your off time, why the fuck are you

65
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:20,420
being held to company standard on your off time?

66
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:23,340
It's ridiculous, but this is where progressives have led us.

67
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:27,600
Liberals, conservatives, libertarians, capitalists of all types tend to respect the barrier between

68
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,940
private and public.

69
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:32,420
It's progressives who overwhelmingly preach that because everything is political, there

70
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:37,340
should be levers of power available to destroy somebody who does something immoral regardless

71
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:38,720
of its legality.

72
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,660
So what is the limit on that principle?

73
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,640
Again, forget about the legality for a second.

74
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:45,400
The wig snatcher is already finding himself in legal trouble because the wig woman went

75
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:46,400
to the cops.

76
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:49,640
But should he have been fired for something totally unrelated to his job?

77
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:53,240
The wig woman frames the conversation as if she's just holding him accountable by recording

78
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:54,240
him with her phone.

79
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:58,420
But what that actually means is she's doxing him and then uploading his face and ruining

80
00:05:58,420 --> 00:05:59,420
his life.

81
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:01,560
What makes that the appropriate thing to do?

82
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:05,740
Maybe you think that legality itself is the standard, that as long as something is illegal,

83
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:08,840
it should also be grounds to be cancelable and fireable.

84
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:11,100
That's not necessarily a bad position to hold.

85
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:14,820
We see lots of examples of people doing beyond the pale stuff, and it feels correct when

86
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:15,820
they lose their job.

87
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:19,760
I went over an example on yesterday's weekly sip of a feminist professor who vandalized

88
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:24,460
a pro-life display on campus and then, when asked about that event by journalists, held

89
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:26,700
up a machete to one of their necks.

90
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:30,300
That might not have been done strictly during work hours, but she did get fired for it.

91
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:33,980
Though this one is quite extreme, and to be honest, it probably would have naturally led

92
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:35,300
to her firing anyway.

93
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:37,780
If she had to go to jail, she couldn't attend her job.

94
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:42,120
The issue is, the people who overwhelmingly wield the cancel culture power right now,

95
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:46,360
progressives, they don't think the limit for a reasonable canceling is just legality.

96
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:50,000
They think the limit is whether or not the target is aligned with them politically.

97
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,260
Now, sometimes that alignment literally means, do you hold the same political views as me?

98
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:55,720
But there is more to it than that.

99
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:57,560
Look at the wig-snatcher story again.

100
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:02,560
He's a presumably straight, white male working in law, while she's a black female, probably

101
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:05,840
some flavor of queer, and she's working as an artiste.

102
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:09,300
Even if they both happened to hold the same political opinions and voted for the same

103
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:10,980
candidates and policies.

104
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:16,660
Because blackness and whiteness are now political ideologies themselves in the progressive zeitgeist,

105
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:21,180
she automatically classified him not just as a douchebag but a political enemy after

106
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:22,520
he snatched her wig.

107
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:25,380
And sometimes, the issue at play is power dynamics.

108
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:29,020
Progressives tend to talk about punching up and punching down a lot, especially online,

109
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:33,560
where the idea is, despite other factors like political affiliation or race or sexuality

110
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:34,560
or gender.

111
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:39,080
If there is a class disparity, or a power disparity, or a reach disparity, like if one

112
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:43,120
party has a larger platform, that also creates opposing political classes.

113
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:47,540
This was what was at the core of the ultimately deranged Mr. Girl report on Destiny, where

114
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:51,380
the basics of Mr. Girl's argument was that Destiny had an extra responsibility due to

115
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:54,020
his size when dealing with smaller creators.

116
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:58,440
That they could punch, but he had to tie one hand behind his back when counter-punching.

117
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:01,360
This idea is all over the fucking internet right now.

118
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:06,640
How many times have you seen people, quote, come forward with bullshit docs or manifestos

119
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:10,700
and make claims about how a YouTuber treated them inappropriately four years ago or six

120
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:12,100
years ago or whatever.

121
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:15,000
Something that can't be proven anymore and was never reported to the police, and we're

122
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,460
just expected to believe all women because of some residual me too effect.

123
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:19,660
These stories all read the same.

124
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:24,040
I'm so scared to speak up because I used to run with some mid-tier Twitch stream you've

125
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,040
never heard of before.

126
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:28,120
I'm not doing this for the clout, even though I'm going to link my own Twitch channel or

127
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:30,560
my OnlyFans or whatever in the end of the Twitlonger.

128
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:35,460
We met back in 2017 on Discord where he groomed me by being nice to me, and then after the

129
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:39,640
relationship ran its course, I felt betrayed because he used his star power to get me to

130
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:41,400
send him pictures of my butthole.

131
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:43,040
All of these stories sound the same, dude.

132
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:45,040
And listen, I'm not sitting here saying that they're all fake.

133
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:49,200
There are absolutely people who have used the one drop of celebrity that being a mid-level

134
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:52,920
streamer nets them to get nudes from girls in a way that the girls later regret, who

135
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:56,440
have gotten into parties and got girls drunk and taken advantage of them, who have roped

136
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:58,860
in girls with big promises and left them hanging.

137
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:02,460
There's very real stories out there of people doing this with underage targets, too.

138
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:05,960
I'm not being unsympathetic to any real victims.

139
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:10,280
At the same time, every time I see a tweet chain describing the most one-sided series

140
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:15,380
of events that amount to a scorned lover looking to capitalize on a possibly real, possibly

141
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:20,300
fake event that happened five years ago that they may or may not be traumatized by, where

142
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:24,100
the target is somebody who is much bigger than them and who has moved on from them,

143
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:26,060
I just don't care anymore.

144
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:29,660
I hate sounding like Andrew Tate in his old videos, but fuck me, dude, bring it to the

145
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:30,660
cops.

146
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:34,700
The court of public opinion is not the appropriate place for most of this stuff, and I just don't

147
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:35,700
care anymore.

148
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:40,140
So, those are the three possible vectors for a successful canceling event.

149
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:43,220
Political dynamics, demographic dynamics, and power dynamics.

150
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:45,900
If your canceling attempt can lean on one of those three to demonize your target, you

151
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:47,200
might actually pull it off.

152
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,580
Of course, it's not that simple.

153
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:52,480
One, progressives tend to ignore a specific power dynamic, attractiveness privilege.

154
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:56,080
If all else being equal, a pretty person cancels an ugly person, it's no problem

155
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:58,440
despite it obviously being punching down.

156
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:03,020
Considering that, as a very general average, left-leaning people do tend to be slightly

157
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:06,260
more attractive than right-leaning people, I'm not surprised that this is a hierarchy

158
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:08,520
that the left doesn't really care too much about tearing down.

159
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:13,760
Two, and more importantly, when the various dynamics clash, the winner is always the political

160
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:14,760
dynamic.

161
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:17,280
In other words, when it's a white progressive versus a black conservative, it's the black

162
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:18,640
person who gets cancelled.

163
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:26,480
Take this video of Tim Pool having his beanie snatched off his head.

164
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:34,020
Now, because the beanie wasn't pinned down like Wig Girl's wig was, it didn't physically

165
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:35,020
damage him.

166
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:39,200
It's obviously not a one-to-one comparison, but it is in roughly the same class of thing,

167
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,040
and it's also likely a form of assault.

168
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:44,680
How many leftoids laughed at Tim Pool in this clip, shouting about him getting owned and

169
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:49,060
how hilarious it is, while calling the guy who did the snatching a hero and not doxing

170
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:50,720
him and not ruining his life?

171
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:55,800
I bet those same leftoids were 100% on board with stringing up the wig snatcher.

172
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:59,620
Even though, in both cases, it's a racial minority getting harassed by a white man,

173
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:03,860
it counts for Wig Girl and it doesn't count for Tim Pool because of political alignment.

174
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:07,860
This is why we've seen nonsense like how Asians are honorary whites or how black-white

175
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:09,140
supremacy is a thing.

176
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:12,520
When the demographic dynamic disagrees with the political dynamic, the dissenter has to

177
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:15,080
be de-raced by the progressive lens.

178
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:18,100
Do you want an even more stark example of this effect in action?

179
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:39,580
Watch this trans woman wear a mega-hat at a Pride event.

180
00:11:39,580 --> 00:12:07,220
You

181
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:24,220
need to calm down, sir.

182
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:27,780
This person is absolutely part of the demographics of Pride, being trans.

183
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:29,580
This is literally her community.

184
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:32,380
But the political alignment made that point moot.

185
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:36,640
She's not actually trans anymore, in the progressive view, because being progressive is a necessary

186
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:38,920
component of truly being trans.

187
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:42,540
This is something that I went over in detail in my video documenting people who were physically

188
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:46,440
attacked for wearing mega-hats in public during Trump's presidency.

189
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:51,120
Some of those attackers did face legal repercussions, but none of them were ever canceled by the

190
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,120
internet mob.

191
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:54,320
The question at this point is, why?

192
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,460
Why is it like this?

193
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:59,740
If you want an hour-long, deep answer to that question, go watch my video on the philosophy

194
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:01,160
of Antonio Gramsci.

195
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:05,920
The TLDR is, Gramsci in political theory and everybody who has descended from his work,

196
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:11,000
even if unknowingly, like the modern progressive movement in the West, has three basic axioms.

197
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
1.

198
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,840
Moving the world more leftward is good.

199
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:15,400
It doesn't matter what type of leftism.

200
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:17,520
Doesn't matter if you're an incrementalist or revolutionary.

201
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:19,800
More left equals more good, simple as.

202
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:20,800
2.

203
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,620
Any method to move the world more leftward is morally permissible.

204
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:27,440
If somebody objects to the morality of your chosen method, they're objecting to your outcome.

205
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,480
Again, more left means more good.

206
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:33,380
Because you're pursuing a better world, even a utopian world, all paths that lead in that

207
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:34,840
direction are valid.

208
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:35,840
3.

209
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:40,280
This is the first result of 1 and 2 when a liberal calls for neutrality in debate, neutrality

210
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:44,060
in institutions, even neutrality in things that you'd think would be naturally objective

211
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:45,100
like science.

212
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:48,480
The liberal is simply blind to the nature of power.

213
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:53,200
Liberal neutrality does not truly exist because it necessarily privileges a specific liberal

214
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,240
political position.

215
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:58,960
And anything more leftward than that imposed neutrality is preferable because, again, more

216
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:00,280
left is more good.

217
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:04,760
Therefore, when leftism and neutrality are at odds, leftism should win.

218
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:05,760
4.

219
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:08,720
Multiple right-wing political theorists have observed and described this ratchet effect

220
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:09,720
leftward.

221
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:12,000
Moldbug stated that Cthulhu always swims left.

222
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,920
One of Robert Conquest's three laws of politics is any institution not explicitly right-wing

223
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:18,680
will become left-wing over time.

224
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:19,960
They're all getting at the same thing.

225
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:23,980
Progressives slowly boiling the frog on wider cultural subversion, with each moment a new

226
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:28,580
data point, pulling fire alarms on a conservative speaker at a university campus, spam reporting

227
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:32,560
somebody's social media because they are your political enemy, pushing for people who aren't

228
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:34,240
even terrorist groups or anything.

229
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:37,580
They just don't hold progressive opinions to have their bank accounts shut down.

230
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:41,820
Going after history itself, whether that's old books, old movies, old songs, or dead

231
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:42,820
public figures.

232
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:47,160
And, of course, attacking regular people who aren't in any way any sort of extremist,

233
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:50,180
but support the idea of liberal neutrality itself.

234
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:54,060
This is where everything is political is trotted out, to be used as a battering ram to shame

235
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:55,720
the liberal into compliance.

236
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:57,040
And of course, it's not happening.

237
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:58,040
It's not real.

238
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:59,160
This is just the natural state, guys.

239
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:02,360
This is how it's always been, how it always will be, how it should be.

240
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:04,280
It's consequence culture, guys.

241
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:07,000
If people do bad things, shouldn't they be punished?

242
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,720
Even a child knows that bullies should be held accountable.

243
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:12,480
Of course, the progressives doing the canceling aren't bullies, they just want to make the

244
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:13,480
world a better place.

245
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:14,960
They're just clapping back.

246
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:16,400
Their goals make it acceptable.

247
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:18,320
It's all so tiring.

248
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:21,920
The left has reinvented all of the worst aspects of the internet, that they screamed about

249
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:25,200
being dangerous right-wing extremism back in the 2010s.

250
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:27,580
Doxing, targeted harassment, life ruination.

251
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:31,360
But because it's done in the service of their good cause, it's acceptable.

252
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:34,680
Before everyone had a camera in their pocket, people weren't scared of doing something stupid

253
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:37,600
in public, because there was no chance it would be immortalized.

254
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:40,200
See my nostalgia as fascism video for more on that idea.

255
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:44,540
Do you know what we did back in the 90s and 2000s if we were slighted by some dumb drunk

256
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:45,600
fuck on the street?

257
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,240
We moved on because it didn't matter.

258
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:48,760
If it was serious, we might have fought them.

259
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:50,700
If it was really serious, we would call the cops.

260
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:54,160
But the proportionality of those three responses was correct.

261
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:55,320
Not so nowadays.

262
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:59,640
Nowadays, even the slightest of offenses, which have been rebranded as microaggressions,

263
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:02,840
to the progressive, are deserving of the most extreme response.

264
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:06,460
But to most people who have their head on straight, snatching a wig off that lady's

265
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:08,540
head while drunk is an asshole thing to do.

266
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:10,940
But it's not worth ruining the guy's life over.

267
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:15,380
The left is, slowly, finally, beginning to lose some of its cultural dominance.

268
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:16,640
At least online, anyway.

269
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:21,160
And I expect their Puritanism to ramp up hard, as their claws are forcefully pried out of

270
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:22,680
the death grip they've got us all in.

271
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:27,080
They are just like the religious fundamentalists of yesteryear, who can't leave people alone

272
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:28,560
to live their private lives.

273
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:32,040
Who must butt into every space to make sure the proper views are followed.

274
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:35,520
Who must punish anybody for any deviation from orthodoxy.

275
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:37,680
These people are butting totalitarians.

276
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:41,760
They lack the total political power to actually enforce their morality on everybody at all

277
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:43,980
times like a true totalitarian system would.

278
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:47,040
And so cancel culture is their next best attempt.

279
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:51,840
If they can't make it illegal to be a non-progressive, they will make it financially costly, morally

280
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:54,120
repugnant, and culturally taboo instead.
