0	9980	Today's video is another case of somebody sending me a submission for TikTok Tuesday
9980	13600	and me realizing this is actually worth going over in more detail.
13600	17220	The broader topic is about cancel culture, and though I've spoken about it before on
17220	20140	this channel, it's been a while, and there's new stuff to talk about.
20140	21940	Let's start with Viral TikTok.
21940	26380	This clip blew up over the last weekend, netting 650,000 views.
51940	80820	So
80820	85540	the story is, the one recording the video, Lizzie Ash Music, claims that this guy grabbed
85540	89140	her wig while walking by on the streets of New York at night.
89140	92540	The third person in the video is the guy's friend, who knows that his pal is looking
92540	95240	like an asshole and is begging him to apologize.
95240	98740	But the guy doesn't seem to know what's going on, he's falling forward, he's ignoring
98740	102100	people talking to him, when he does reply, he doesn't seem to understand what's being
102100	103100	said to him.
103100	106100	It's very clear that this dude is drunk and stumbling home from the bar at the end
106100	107100	of the night.
107100	109600	But he probably actually did snatch her wig.
109600	113620	With a bright fucking beacon like that, that's something a drunk guy looking for a laugh
113620	114620	might try to do.
114620	118060	Plus, the fact that his friend is on camera trying to defuse the situation by asking him
118060	120980	to apologize, yeah, I don't think it's too likely that she's just making the whole
120980	121980	story up.
121980	125620	We didn't see it happen, but it is believable, and yeah, that's a shitty thing to do.
125620	128420	It probably even counts as some form of assault, legally.
128420	132680	She showed off in a later video that the wig is actually quite attached to her hair and
132680	134700	did real damage being ripped off.
137100	139140	But look at this.
139140	143420	If you pull the wig, it looks like it's going to come off, right?
143420	149160	And then it gets stuck because it has combs in it.
149160	153200	So he ended up pulling my hair in order to officially take it off.
153200	158100	You have to then yank down and then try your best.
158100	161100	It's still not coming off.
161100	165780	He dead pulled my whole wig off.
165780	169620	But as a result of the video going viral, this guy got his life destroyed.
169620	195420	He goes into further detail in a third video.
225420	233180	The internet tracked him down and discovered he was an associate at the law firm Leader
233180	237260	Burcon Kalau and Silverstein.
237260	239860	The firm put out a public statement that reads,
239860	244960	We have been made aware of a video of a non-work-related incident involving one of our associates circulating
244960	246020	on social media.
246020	251300	We take seriously any inappropriate behavior by any employee, whether inside or outside
251300	252300	the workplace.
252300	254100	This associate is no longer with the firm.
254100	256660	Now listen, I'm not going to sit here and simp for this guy.
256660	260260	Even if grabbing the wig isn't something he would have done when he was sober.
260260	261780	Even if he doesn't remember doing it.
261780	268140	You are responsible for what you do when you're drunk because you chose to get drunk.
268140	269540	This applies to drunk driving.
269540	274100	And yes, unpopular opinion alert, it applies to a good chunk of sexual activity as well.
274100	279320	So obviously, it also applies to when you yank a random woman's wig off in the street.
279320	282480	He committed assault, she went to the cops, which is exactly what she should do.
282480	283480	That's her legal right.
283480	285100	Now look at the wording of that statement again.
285100	290180	We take seriously any inappropriate behavior by any employee, whether inside or outside
290180	291280	the workplace.
291280	292780	Any inappropriate behavior?
292780	297200	If this guy tells an edgy joke in the privacy of his own home to his old high school friends,
297200	301000	and the law firm has a fucking spy drone hovering at the apartment window recording it, should
301000	302000	he be fired then?
302000	303520	What is the limit on this shit?
303520	307760	I mentioned in my video about the City Bike Karen that I hate how our society has decided
307760	311480	that a workplace can just police random workers off the clock and it's no big deal.
311480	314620	If you're not a public face of the company, if you're not the CEO or something, if you're
314620	318180	just a cog in the machine and you're not getting paid on your off time, why the fuck are you
318180	320420	being held to company standard on your off time?
320420	323340	It's ridiculous, but this is where progressives have led us.
323340	327600	Liberals, conservatives, libertarians, capitalists of all types tend to respect the barrier between
327600	328940	private and public.
328940	332420	It's progressives who overwhelmingly preach that because everything is political, there
332420	337340	should be levers of power available to destroy somebody who does something immoral regardless
337340	338720	of its legality.
338720	340660	So what is the limit on that principle?
340840	342640	Again, forget about the legality for a second.
342640	345400	The wig snatcher is already finding himself in legal trouble because the wig woman went
345400	346400	to the cops.
346400	349640	But should he have been fired for something totally unrelated to his job?
349640	353240	The wig woman frames the conversation as if she's just holding him accountable by recording
353240	354240	him with her phone.
354240	358420	But what that actually means is she's doxing him and then uploading his face and ruining
358420	359420	his life.
359420	361560	What makes that the appropriate thing to do?
361560	365740	Maybe you think that legality itself is the standard, that as long as something is illegal,
365740	368840	it should also be grounds to be cancelable and fireable.
368840	371100	That's not necessarily a bad position to hold.
371100	374820	We see lots of examples of people doing beyond the pale stuff, and it feels correct when
374820	375820	they lose their job.
375820	379760	I went over an example on yesterday's weekly sip of a feminist professor who vandalized
379760	384460	a pro-life display on campus and then, when asked about that event by journalists, held
384460	386700	up a machete to one of their necks.
386700	390300	That might not have been done strictly during work hours, but she did get fired for it.
390300	393980	Though this one is quite extreme, and to be honest, it probably would have naturally led
393980	395300	to her firing anyway.
395300	397780	If she had to go to jail, she couldn't attend her job.
397780	402120	The issue is, the people who overwhelmingly wield the cancel culture power right now,
402120	406360	progressives, they don't think the limit for a reasonable canceling is just legality.
406360	410000	They think the limit is whether or not the target is aligned with them politically.
410000	414260	Now, sometimes that alignment literally means, do you hold the same political views as me?
414260	415720	But there is more to it than that.
415720	417560	Look at the wig-snatcher story again.
417560	422560	He's a presumably straight, white male working in law, while she's a black female, probably
422560	425840	some flavor of queer, and she's working as an artiste.
425840	429300	Even if they both happened to hold the same political opinions and voted for the same
429300	430980	candidates and policies.
430980	436660	Because blackness and whiteness are now political ideologies themselves in the progressive zeitgeist,
436660	441180	she automatically classified him not just as a douchebag but a political enemy after
441180	442520	he snatched her wig.
442520	445380	And sometimes, the issue at play is power dynamics.
445380	449020	Progressives tend to talk about punching up and punching down a lot, especially online,
449020	453560	where the idea is, despite other factors like political affiliation or race or sexuality
453560	454560	or gender.
454560	459080	If there is a class disparity, or a power disparity, or a reach disparity, like if one
459080	463120	party has a larger platform, that also creates opposing political classes.
463120	467540	This was what was at the core of the ultimately deranged Mr. Girl report on Destiny, where
467540	471380	the basics of Mr. Girl's argument was that Destiny had an extra responsibility due to
471380	474020	his size when dealing with smaller creators.
474020	478440	That they could punch, but he had to tie one hand behind his back when counter-punching.
478440	481360	This idea is all over the fucking internet right now.
481360	486640	How many times have you seen people, quote, come forward with bullshit docs or manifestos
486640	490700	and make claims about how a YouTuber treated them inappropriately four years ago or six
490700	492100	years ago or whatever.
492100	495000	Something that can't be proven anymore and was never reported to the police, and we're
495000	498460	just expected to believe all women because of some residual me too effect.
498460	499660	These stories all read the same.
499660	504040	I'm so scared to speak up because I used to run with some mid-tier Twitch stream you've
504040	505040	never heard of before.
505040	508120	I'm not doing this for the clout, even though I'm going to link my own Twitch channel or
508120	510560	my OnlyFans or whatever in the end of the Twitlonger.
510560	515460	We met back in 2017 on Discord where he groomed me by being nice to me, and then after the
515460	519640	relationship ran its course, I felt betrayed because he used his star power to get me to
519640	521400	send him pictures of my butthole.
521400	523040	All of these stories sound the same, dude.
523040	525040	And listen, I'm not sitting here saying that they're all fake.
525040	529200	There are absolutely people who have used the one drop of celebrity that being a mid-level
529200	532920	streamer nets them to get nudes from girls in a way that the girls later regret, who
532920	536440	have gotten into parties and got girls drunk and taken advantage of them, who have roped
536440	538860	in girls with big promises and left them hanging.
538860	542460	There's very real stories out there of people doing this with underage targets, too.
542460	545960	I'm not being unsympathetic to any real victims.
545960	550280	At the same time, every time I see a tweet chain describing the most one-sided series
550280	555380	of events that amount to a scorned lover looking to capitalize on a possibly real, possibly
555380	560300	fake event that happened five years ago that they may or may not be traumatized by, where
560300	564100	the target is somebody who is much bigger than them and who has moved on from them,
564100	566060	I just don't care anymore.
566060	569660	I hate sounding like Andrew Tate in his old videos, but fuck me, dude, bring it to the
569660	570660	cops.
570660	574700	The court of public opinion is not the appropriate place for most of this stuff, and I just don't
574700	575700	care anymore.
575700	580140	So, those are the three possible vectors for a successful canceling event.
580140	583220	Political dynamics, demographic dynamics, and power dynamics.
583220	585900	If your canceling attempt can lean on one of those three to demonize your target, you
585900	587200	might actually pull it off.
587200	588580	Of course, it's not that simple.
588580	592480	One, progressives tend to ignore a specific power dynamic, attractiveness privilege.
592480	596080	If all else being equal, a pretty person cancels an ugly person, it's no problem
596080	598440	despite it obviously being punching down.
598440	603020	Considering that, as a very general average, left-leaning people do tend to be slightly
603020	606260	more attractive than right-leaning people, I'm not surprised that this is a hierarchy
606260	608520	that the left doesn't really care too much about tearing down.
608520	613760	Two, and more importantly, when the various dynamics clash, the winner is always the political
613760	614760	dynamic.
614760	617280	In other words, when it's a white progressive versus a black conservative, it's the black
617280	618640	person who gets cancelled.
618640	626480	Take this video of Tim Pool having his beanie snatched off his head.
626480	634020	Now, because the beanie wasn't pinned down like Wig Girl's wig was, it didn't physically
634020	635020	damage him.
635020	639200	It's obviously not a one-to-one comparison, but it is in roughly the same class of thing,
639200	641040	and it's also likely a form of assault.
641040	644680	How many leftoids laughed at Tim Pool in this clip, shouting about him getting owned and
644680	649060	how hilarious it is, while calling the guy who did the snatching a hero and not doxing
649060	650720	him and not ruining his life?
650720	655800	I bet those same leftoids were 100% on board with stringing up the wig snatcher.
655800	659620	Even though, in both cases, it's a racial minority getting harassed by a white man,
659620	663860	it counts for Wig Girl and it doesn't count for Tim Pool because of political alignment.
663860	667860	This is why we've seen nonsense like how Asians are honorary whites or how black-white
667860	669140	supremacy is a thing.
669140	672520	When the demographic dynamic disagrees with the political dynamic, the dissenter has to
672520	675080	be de-raced by the progressive lens.
675080	678100	Do you want an even more stark example of this effect in action?
678100	699580	Watch this trans woman wear a mega-hat at a Pride event.
699580	727220	You
727220	744220	need to calm down, sir.
744220	747780	This person is absolutely part of the demographics of Pride, being trans.
747780	749580	This is literally her community.
749580	752380	But the political alignment made that point moot.
752380	756640	She's not actually trans anymore, in the progressive view, because being progressive is a necessary
756640	758920	component of truly being trans.
758920	762540	This is something that I went over in detail in my video documenting people who were physically
762540	766440	attacked for wearing mega-hats in public during Trump's presidency.
766440	771120	Some of those attackers did face legal repercussions, but none of them were ever canceled by the
771120	772120	internet mob.
772120	774320	The question at this point is, why?
774320	775460	Why is it like this?
775460	779740	If you want an hour-long, deep answer to that question, go watch my video on the philosophy
779740	781160	of Antonio Gramsci.
781160	785920	The TLDR is, Gramsci in political theory and everybody who has descended from his work,
785920	791000	even if unknowingly, like the modern progressive movement in the West, has three basic axioms.
791000	792000	1.
792000	793840	Moving the world more leftward is good.
793840	795400	It doesn't matter what type of leftism.
795400	797520	Doesn't matter if you're an incrementalist or revolutionary.
797520	799800	More left equals more good, simple as.
799800	800800	2.
800800	803620	Any method to move the world more leftward is morally permissible.
803620	807440	If somebody objects to the morality of your chosen method, they're objecting to your outcome.
807440	809480	Again, more left means more good.
809480	813380	Because you're pursuing a better world, even a utopian world, all paths that lead in that
813380	814840	direction are valid.
814840	815840	3.
815840	820280	This is the first result of 1 and 2 when a liberal calls for neutrality in debate, neutrality
820280	824060	in institutions, even neutrality in things that you'd think would be naturally objective
824060	825100	like science.
825100	828480	The liberal is simply blind to the nature of power.
828480	833200	Liberal neutrality does not truly exist because it necessarily privileges a specific liberal
833200	834240	political position.
834240	838960	And anything more leftward than that imposed neutrality is preferable because, again, more
838960	840280	left is more good.
840280	844760	Therefore, when leftism and neutrality are at odds, leftism should win.
844760	845760	4.
845760	848720	Multiple right-wing political theorists have observed and described this ratchet effect
848720	849720	leftward.
849720	852000	Moldbug stated that Cthulhu always swims left.
852000	856920	One of Robert Conquest's three laws of politics is any institution not explicitly right-wing
856920	858680	will become left-wing over time.
858680	859960	They're all getting at the same thing.
859960	863980	Progressives slowly boiling the frog on wider cultural subversion, with each moment a new
863980	868580	data point, pulling fire alarms on a conservative speaker at a university campus, spam reporting
868580	872560	somebody's social media because they are your political enemy, pushing for people who aren't
872560	874240	even terrorist groups or anything.
874240	877580	They just don't hold progressive opinions to have their bank accounts shut down.
877580	881820	Going after history itself, whether that's old books, old movies, old songs, or dead
881820	882820	public figures.
882820	887160	And, of course, attacking regular people who aren't in any way any sort of extremist,
887160	890180	but support the idea of liberal neutrality itself.
890180	894060	This is where everything is political is trotted out, to be used as a battering ram to shame
894060	895720	the liberal into compliance.
895720	897040	And of course, it's not happening.
897040	898040	It's not real.
898040	899160	This is just the natural state, guys.
899160	902360	This is how it's always been, how it always will be, how it should be.
902360	904280	It's consequence culture, guys.
904280	907000	If people do bad things, shouldn't they be punished?
907000	909720	Even a child knows that bullies should be held accountable.
909720	912480	Of course, the progressives doing the canceling aren't bullies, they just want to make the
912480	913480	world a better place.
913480	914960	They're just clapping back.
914960	916400	Their goals make it acceptable.
916400	918320	It's all so tiring.
918320	921920	The left has reinvented all of the worst aspects of the internet, that they screamed about
921920	925200	being dangerous right-wing extremism back in the 2010s.
925200	927580	Doxing, targeted harassment, life ruination.
927580	931360	But because it's done in the service of their good cause, it's acceptable.
931360	934680	Before everyone had a camera in their pocket, people weren't scared of doing something stupid
934680	937600	in public, because there was no chance it would be immortalized.
937600	940200	See my nostalgia as fascism video for more on that idea.
940200	944540	Do you know what we did back in the 90s and 2000s if we were slighted by some dumb drunk
944540	945600	fuck on the street?
945600	947240	We moved on because it didn't matter.
947240	948760	If it was serious, we might have fought them.
948760	950700	If it was really serious, we would call the cops.
950700	954160	But the proportionality of those three responses was correct.
954160	955320	Not so nowadays.
955320	959640	Nowadays, even the slightest of offenses, which have been rebranded as microaggressions,
959640	962840	to the progressive, are deserving of the most extreme response.
962840	966460	But to most people who have their head on straight, snatching a wig off that lady's
966460	968540	head while drunk is an asshole thing to do.
968540	970940	But it's not worth ruining the guy's life over.
970940	975380	The left is, slowly, finally, beginning to lose some of its cultural dominance.
975380	976640	At least online, anyway.
976640	981160	And I expect their Puritanism to ramp up hard, as their claws are forcefully pried out of
981160	982680	the death grip they've got us all in.
982680	987080	They are just like the religious fundamentalists of yesteryear, who can't leave people alone
