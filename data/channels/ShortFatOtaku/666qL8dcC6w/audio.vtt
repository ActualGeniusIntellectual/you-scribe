00:00.000 --> 00:09.980
Today's video is another case of somebody sending me a submission for TikTok Tuesday

00:09.980 --> 00:13.600
and me realizing this is actually worth going over in more detail.

00:13.600 --> 00:17.220
The broader topic is about cancel culture, and though I've spoken about it before on

00:17.220 --> 00:20.140
this channel, it's been a while, and there's new stuff to talk about.

00:20.140 --> 00:21.940
Let's start with Viral TikTok.

00:21.940 --> 00:26.380
This clip blew up over the last weekend, netting 650,000 views.

00:51.940 --> 01:20.820
So

01:20.820 --> 01:25.540
the story is, the one recording the video, Lizzie Ash Music, claims that this guy grabbed

01:25.540 --> 01:29.140
her wig while walking by on the streets of New York at night.

01:29.140 --> 01:32.540
The third person in the video is the guy's friend, who knows that his pal is looking

01:32.540 --> 01:35.240
like an asshole and is begging him to apologize.

01:35.240 --> 01:38.740
But the guy doesn't seem to know what's going on, he's falling forward, he's ignoring

01:38.740 --> 01:42.100
people talking to him, when he does reply, he doesn't seem to understand what's being

01:42.100 --> 01:43.100
said to him.

01:43.100 --> 01:46.100
It's very clear that this dude is drunk and stumbling home from the bar at the end

01:46.100 --> 01:47.100
of the night.

01:47.100 --> 01:49.600
But he probably actually did snatch her wig.

01:49.600 --> 01:53.620
With a bright fucking beacon like that, that's something a drunk guy looking for a laugh

01:53.620 --> 01:54.620
might try to do.

01:54.620 --> 01:58.060
Plus, the fact that his friend is on camera trying to defuse the situation by asking him

01:58.060 --> 02:00.980
to apologize, yeah, I don't think it's too likely that she's just making the whole

02:00.980 --> 02:01.980
story up.

02:01.980 --> 02:05.620
We didn't see it happen, but it is believable, and yeah, that's a shitty thing to do.

02:05.620 --> 02:08.420
It probably even counts as some form of assault, legally.

02:08.420 --> 02:12.680
She showed off in a later video that the wig is actually quite attached to her hair and

02:12.680 --> 02:14.700
did real damage being ripped off.

02:17.100 --> 02:19.140
But look at this.

02:19.140 --> 02:23.420
If you pull the wig, it looks like it's going to come off, right?

02:23.420 --> 02:29.160
And then it gets stuck because it has combs in it.

02:29.160 --> 02:33.200
So he ended up pulling my hair in order to officially take it off.

02:33.200 --> 02:38.100
You have to then yank down and then try your best.

02:38.100 --> 02:41.100
It's still not coming off.

02:41.100 --> 02:45.780
He dead pulled my whole wig off.

02:45.780 --> 02:49.620
But as a result of the video going viral, this guy got his life destroyed.

02:49.620 --> 03:15.420
He goes into further detail in a third video.

03:45.420 --> 03:53.180
The internet tracked him down and discovered he was an associate at the law firm Leader

03:53.180 --> 03:57.260
Burcon Kalau and Silverstein.

03:57.260 --> 03:59.860
The firm put out a public statement that reads,

03:59.860 --> 04:04.960
We have been made aware of a video of a non-work-related incident involving one of our associates circulating

04:04.960 --> 04:06.020
on social media.

04:06.020 --> 04:11.300
We take seriously any inappropriate behavior by any employee, whether inside or outside

04:11.300 --> 04:12.300
the workplace.

04:12.300 --> 04:14.100
This associate is no longer with the firm.

04:14.100 --> 04:16.660
Now listen, I'm not going to sit here and simp for this guy.

04:16.660 --> 04:20.260
Even if grabbing the wig isn't something he would have done when he was sober.

04:20.260 --> 04:21.780
Even if he doesn't remember doing it.

04:21.780 --> 04:28.140
You are responsible for what you do when you're drunk because you chose to get drunk.

04:28.140 --> 04:29.540
This applies to drunk driving.

04:29.540 --> 04:34.100
And yes, unpopular opinion alert, it applies to a good chunk of sexual activity as well.

04:34.100 --> 04:39.320
So obviously, it also applies to when you yank a random woman's wig off in the street.

04:39.320 --> 04:42.480
He committed assault, she went to the cops, which is exactly what she should do.

04:42.480 --> 04:43.480
That's her legal right.

04:43.480 --> 04:45.100
Now look at the wording of that statement again.

04:45.100 --> 04:50.180
We take seriously any inappropriate behavior by any employee, whether inside or outside

04:50.180 --> 04:51.280
the workplace.

04:51.280 --> 04:52.780
Any inappropriate behavior?

04:52.780 --> 04:57.200
If this guy tells an edgy joke in the privacy of his own home to his old high school friends,

04:57.200 --> 05:01.000
and the law firm has a fucking spy drone hovering at the apartment window recording it, should

05:01.000 --> 05:02.000
he be fired then?

05:02.000 --> 05:03.520
What is the limit on this shit?

05:03.520 --> 05:07.760
I mentioned in my video about the City Bike Karen that I hate how our society has decided

05:07.760 --> 05:11.480
that a workplace can just police random workers off the clock and it's no big deal.

05:11.480 --> 05:14.620
If you're not a public face of the company, if you're not the CEO or something, if you're

05:14.620 --> 05:18.180
just a cog in the machine and you're not getting paid on your off time, why the fuck are you

05:18.180 --> 05:20.420
being held to company standard on your off time?

05:20.420 --> 05:23.340
It's ridiculous, but this is where progressives have led us.

05:23.340 --> 05:27.600
Liberals, conservatives, libertarians, capitalists of all types tend to respect the barrier between

05:27.600 --> 05:28.940
private and public.

05:28.940 --> 05:32.420
It's progressives who overwhelmingly preach that because everything is political, there

05:32.420 --> 05:37.340
should be levers of power available to destroy somebody who does something immoral regardless

05:37.340 --> 05:38.720
of its legality.

05:38.720 --> 05:40.660
So what is the limit on that principle?

05:40.840 --> 05:42.640
Again, forget about the legality for a second.

05:42.640 --> 05:45.400
The wig snatcher is already finding himself in legal trouble because the wig woman went

05:45.400 --> 05:46.400
to the cops.

05:46.400 --> 05:49.640
But should he have been fired for something totally unrelated to his job?

05:49.640 --> 05:53.240
The wig woman frames the conversation as if she's just holding him accountable by recording

05:53.240 --> 05:54.240
him with her phone.

05:54.240 --> 05:58.420
But what that actually means is she's doxing him and then uploading his face and ruining

05:58.420 --> 05:59.420
his life.

05:59.420 --> 06:01.560
What makes that the appropriate thing to do?

06:01.560 --> 06:05.740
Maybe you think that legality itself is the standard, that as long as something is illegal,

06:05.740 --> 06:08.840
it should also be grounds to be cancelable and fireable.

06:08.840 --> 06:11.100
That's not necessarily a bad position to hold.

06:11.100 --> 06:14.820
We see lots of examples of people doing beyond the pale stuff, and it feels correct when

06:14.820 --> 06:15.820
they lose their job.

06:15.820 --> 06:19.760
I went over an example on yesterday's weekly sip of a feminist professor who vandalized

06:19.760 --> 06:24.460
a pro-life display on campus and then, when asked about that event by journalists, held

06:24.460 --> 06:26.700
up a machete to one of their necks.

06:26.700 --> 06:30.300
That might not have been done strictly during work hours, but she did get fired for it.

06:30.300 --> 06:33.980
Though this one is quite extreme, and to be honest, it probably would have naturally led

06:33.980 --> 06:35.300
to her firing anyway.

06:35.300 --> 06:37.780
If she had to go to jail, she couldn't attend her job.

06:37.780 --> 06:42.120
The issue is, the people who overwhelmingly wield the cancel culture power right now,

06:42.120 --> 06:46.360
progressives, they don't think the limit for a reasonable canceling is just legality.

06:46.360 --> 06:50.000
They think the limit is whether or not the target is aligned with them politically.

06:50.000 --> 06:54.260
Now, sometimes that alignment literally means, do you hold the same political views as me?

06:54.260 --> 06:55.720
But there is more to it than that.

06:55.720 --> 06:57.560
Look at the wig-snatcher story again.

06:57.560 --> 07:02.560
He's a presumably straight, white male working in law, while she's a black female, probably

07:02.560 --> 07:05.840
some flavor of queer, and she's working as an artiste.

07:05.840 --> 07:09.300
Even if they both happened to hold the same political opinions and voted for the same

07:09.300 --> 07:10.980
candidates and policies.

07:10.980 --> 07:16.660
Because blackness and whiteness are now political ideologies themselves in the progressive zeitgeist,

07:16.660 --> 07:21.180
she automatically classified him not just as a douchebag but a political enemy after

07:21.180 --> 07:22.520
he snatched her wig.

07:22.520 --> 07:25.380
And sometimes, the issue at play is power dynamics.

07:25.380 --> 07:29.020
Progressives tend to talk about punching up and punching down a lot, especially online,

07:29.020 --> 07:33.560
where the idea is, despite other factors like political affiliation or race or sexuality

07:33.560 --> 07:34.560
or gender.

07:34.560 --> 07:39.080
If there is a class disparity, or a power disparity, or a reach disparity, like if one

07:39.080 --> 07:43.120
party has a larger platform, that also creates opposing political classes.

07:43.120 --> 07:47.540
This was what was at the core of the ultimately deranged Mr. Girl report on Destiny, where

07:47.540 --> 07:51.380
the basics of Mr. Girl's argument was that Destiny had an extra responsibility due to

07:51.380 --> 07:54.020
his size when dealing with smaller creators.

07:54.020 --> 07:58.440
That they could punch, but he had to tie one hand behind his back when counter-punching.

07:58.440 --> 08:01.360
This idea is all over the fucking internet right now.

08:01.360 --> 08:06.640
How many times have you seen people, quote, come forward with bullshit docs or manifestos

08:06.640 --> 08:10.700
and make claims about how a YouTuber treated them inappropriately four years ago or six

08:10.700 --> 08:12.100
years ago or whatever.

08:12.100 --> 08:15.000
Something that can't be proven anymore and was never reported to the police, and we're

08:15.000 --> 08:18.460
just expected to believe all women because of some residual me too effect.

08:18.460 --> 08:19.660
These stories all read the same.

08:19.660 --> 08:24.040
I'm so scared to speak up because I used to run with some mid-tier Twitch stream you've

08:24.040 --> 08:25.040
never heard of before.

08:25.040 --> 08:28.120
I'm not doing this for the clout, even though I'm going to link my own Twitch channel or

08:28.120 --> 08:30.560
my OnlyFans or whatever in the end of the Twitlonger.

08:30.560 --> 08:35.460
We met back in 2017 on Discord where he groomed me by being nice to me, and then after the

08:35.460 --> 08:39.640
relationship ran its course, I felt betrayed because he used his star power to get me to

08:39.640 --> 08:41.400
send him pictures of my butthole.

08:41.400 --> 08:43.040
All of these stories sound the same, dude.

08:43.040 --> 08:45.040
And listen, I'm not sitting here saying that they're all fake.

08:45.040 --> 08:49.200
There are absolutely people who have used the one drop of celebrity that being a mid-level

08:49.200 --> 08:52.920
streamer nets them to get nudes from girls in a way that the girls later regret, who

08:52.920 --> 08:56.440
have gotten into parties and got girls drunk and taken advantage of them, who have roped

08:56.440 --> 08:58.860
in girls with big promises and left them hanging.

08:58.860 --> 09:02.460
There's very real stories out there of people doing this with underage targets, too.

09:02.460 --> 09:05.960
I'm not being unsympathetic to any real victims.

09:05.960 --> 09:10.280
At the same time, every time I see a tweet chain describing the most one-sided series

09:10.280 --> 09:15.380
of events that amount to a scorned lover looking to capitalize on a possibly real, possibly

09:15.380 --> 09:20.300
fake event that happened five years ago that they may or may not be traumatized by, where

09:20.300 --> 09:24.100
the target is somebody who is much bigger than them and who has moved on from them,

09:24.100 --> 09:26.060
I just don't care anymore.

09:26.060 --> 09:29.660
I hate sounding like Andrew Tate in his old videos, but fuck me, dude, bring it to the

09:29.660 --> 09:30.660
cops.

09:30.660 --> 09:34.700
The court of public opinion is not the appropriate place for most of this stuff, and I just don't

09:34.700 --> 09:35.700
care anymore.

09:35.700 --> 09:40.140
So, those are the three possible vectors for a successful canceling event.

09:40.140 --> 09:43.220
Political dynamics, demographic dynamics, and power dynamics.

09:43.220 --> 09:45.900
If your canceling attempt can lean on one of those three to demonize your target, you

09:45.900 --> 09:47.200
might actually pull it off.

09:47.200 --> 09:48.580
Of course, it's not that simple.

09:48.580 --> 09:52.480
One, progressives tend to ignore a specific power dynamic, attractiveness privilege.

09:52.480 --> 09:56.080
If all else being equal, a pretty person cancels an ugly person, it's no problem

09:56.080 --> 09:58.440
despite it obviously being punching down.

09:58.440 --> 10:03.020
Considering that, as a very general average, left-leaning people do tend to be slightly

10:03.020 --> 10:06.260
more attractive than right-leaning people, I'm not surprised that this is a hierarchy

10:06.260 --> 10:08.520
that the left doesn't really care too much about tearing down.

10:08.520 --> 10:13.760
Two, and more importantly, when the various dynamics clash, the winner is always the political

10:13.760 --> 10:14.760
dynamic.

10:14.760 --> 10:17.280
In other words, when it's a white progressive versus a black conservative, it's the black

10:17.280 --> 10:18.640
person who gets cancelled.

10:18.640 --> 10:26.480
Take this video of Tim Pool having his beanie snatched off his head.

10:26.480 --> 10:34.020
Now, because the beanie wasn't pinned down like Wig Girl's wig was, it didn't physically

10:34.020 --> 10:35.020
damage him.

10:35.020 --> 10:39.200
It's obviously not a one-to-one comparison, but it is in roughly the same class of thing,

10:39.200 --> 10:41.040
and it's also likely a form of assault.

10:41.040 --> 10:44.680
How many leftoids laughed at Tim Pool in this clip, shouting about him getting owned and

10:44.680 --> 10:49.060
how hilarious it is, while calling the guy who did the snatching a hero and not doxing

10:49.060 --> 10:50.720
him and not ruining his life?

10:50.720 --> 10:55.800
I bet those same leftoids were 100% on board with stringing up the wig snatcher.

10:55.800 --> 10:59.620
Even though, in both cases, it's a racial minority getting harassed by a white man,

10:59.620 --> 11:03.860
it counts for Wig Girl and it doesn't count for Tim Pool because of political alignment.

11:03.860 --> 11:07.860
This is why we've seen nonsense like how Asians are honorary whites or how black-white

11:07.860 --> 11:09.140
supremacy is a thing.

11:09.140 --> 11:12.520
When the demographic dynamic disagrees with the political dynamic, the dissenter has to

11:12.520 --> 11:15.080
be de-raced by the progressive lens.

11:15.080 --> 11:18.100
Do you want an even more stark example of this effect in action?

11:18.100 --> 11:39.580
Watch this trans woman wear a mega-hat at a Pride event.

11:39.580 --> 12:07.220
You

12:07.220 --> 12:24.220
need to calm down, sir.

12:24.220 --> 12:27.780
This person is absolutely part of the demographics of Pride, being trans.

12:27.780 --> 12:29.580
This is literally her community.

12:29.580 --> 12:32.380
But the political alignment made that point moot.

12:32.380 --> 12:36.640
She's not actually trans anymore, in the progressive view, because being progressive is a necessary

12:36.640 --> 12:38.920
component of truly being trans.

12:38.920 --> 12:42.540
This is something that I went over in detail in my video documenting people who were physically

12:42.540 --> 12:46.440
attacked for wearing mega-hats in public during Trump's presidency.

12:46.440 --> 12:51.120
Some of those attackers did face legal repercussions, but none of them were ever canceled by the

12:51.120 --> 12:52.120
internet mob.

12:52.120 --> 12:54.320
The question at this point is, why?

12:54.320 --> 12:55.460
Why is it like this?

12:55.460 --> 12:59.740
If you want an hour-long, deep answer to that question, go watch my video on the philosophy

12:59.740 --> 13:01.160
of Antonio Gramsci.

13:01.160 --> 13:05.920
The TLDR is, Gramsci in political theory and everybody who has descended from his work,

13:05.920 --> 13:11.000
even if unknowingly, like the modern progressive movement in the West, has three basic axioms.

13:11.000 --> 13:12.000
1.

13:12.000 --> 13:13.840
Moving the world more leftward is good.

13:13.840 --> 13:15.400
It doesn't matter what type of leftism.

13:15.400 --> 13:17.520
Doesn't matter if you're an incrementalist or revolutionary.

13:17.520 --> 13:19.800
More left equals more good, simple as.

13:19.800 --> 13:20.800
2.

13:20.800 --> 13:23.620
Any method to move the world more leftward is morally permissible.

13:23.620 --> 13:27.440
If somebody objects to the morality of your chosen method, they're objecting to your outcome.

13:27.440 --> 13:29.480
Again, more left means more good.

13:29.480 --> 13:33.380
Because you're pursuing a better world, even a utopian world, all paths that lead in that

13:33.380 --> 13:34.840
direction are valid.

13:34.840 --> 13:35.840
3.

13:35.840 --> 13:40.280
This is the first result of 1 and 2 when a liberal calls for neutrality in debate, neutrality

13:40.280 --> 13:44.060
in institutions, even neutrality in things that you'd think would be naturally objective

13:44.060 --> 13:45.100
like science.

13:45.100 --> 13:48.480
The liberal is simply blind to the nature of power.

13:48.480 --> 13:53.200
Liberal neutrality does not truly exist because it necessarily privileges a specific liberal

13:53.200 --> 13:54.240
political position.

13:54.240 --> 13:58.960
And anything more leftward than that imposed neutrality is preferable because, again, more

13:58.960 --> 14:00.280
left is more good.

14:00.280 --> 14:04.760
Therefore, when leftism and neutrality are at odds, leftism should win.

14:04.760 --> 14:05.760
4.

14:05.760 --> 14:08.720
Multiple right-wing political theorists have observed and described this ratchet effect

14:08.720 --> 14:09.720
leftward.

14:09.720 --> 14:12.000
Moldbug stated that Cthulhu always swims left.

14:12.000 --> 14:16.920
One of Robert Conquest's three laws of politics is any institution not explicitly right-wing

14:16.920 --> 14:18.680
will become left-wing over time.

14:18.680 --> 14:19.960
They're all getting at the same thing.

14:19.960 --> 14:23.980
Progressives slowly boiling the frog on wider cultural subversion, with each moment a new

14:23.980 --> 14:28.580
data point, pulling fire alarms on a conservative speaker at a university campus, spam reporting

14:28.580 --> 14:32.560
somebody's social media because they are your political enemy, pushing for people who aren't

14:32.560 --> 14:34.240
even terrorist groups or anything.

14:34.240 --> 14:37.580
They just don't hold progressive opinions to have their bank accounts shut down.

14:37.580 --> 14:41.820
Going after history itself, whether that's old books, old movies, old songs, or dead

14:41.820 --> 14:42.820
public figures.

14:42.820 --> 14:47.160
And, of course, attacking regular people who aren't in any way any sort of extremist,

14:47.160 --> 14:50.180
but support the idea of liberal neutrality itself.

14:50.180 --> 14:54.060
This is where everything is political is trotted out, to be used as a battering ram to shame

14:54.060 --> 14:55.720
the liberal into compliance.

14:55.720 --> 14:57.040
And of course, it's not happening.

14:57.040 --> 14:58.040
It's not real.

14:58.040 --> 14:59.160
This is just the natural state, guys.

14:59.160 --> 15:02.360
This is how it's always been, how it always will be, how it should be.

15:02.360 --> 15:04.280
It's consequence culture, guys.

15:04.280 --> 15:07.000
If people do bad things, shouldn't they be punished?

15:07.000 --> 15:09.720
Even a child knows that bullies should be held accountable.

15:09.720 --> 15:12.480
Of course, the progressives doing the canceling aren't bullies, they just want to make the

15:12.480 --> 15:13.480
world a better place.

15:13.480 --> 15:14.960
They're just clapping back.

15:14.960 --> 15:16.400
Their goals make it acceptable.

15:16.400 --> 15:18.320
It's all so tiring.

15:18.320 --> 15:21.920
The left has reinvented all of the worst aspects of the internet, that they screamed about

15:21.920 --> 15:25.200
being dangerous right-wing extremism back in the 2010s.

15:25.200 --> 15:27.580
Doxing, targeted harassment, life ruination.

15:27.580 --> 15:31.360
But because it's done in the service of their good cause, it's acceptable.

15:31.360 --> 15:34.680
Before everyone had a camera in their pocket, people weren't scared of doing something stupid

15:34.680 --> 15:37.600
in public, because there was no chance it would be immortalized.

15:37.600 --> 15:40.200
See my nostalgia as fascism video for more on that idea.

15:40.200 --> 15:44.540
Do you know what we did back in the 90s and 2000s if we were slighted by some dumb drunk

15:44.540 --> 15:45.600
fuck on the street?

15:45.600 --> 15:47.240
We moved on because it didn't matter.

15:47.240 --> 15:48.760
If it was serious, we might have fought them.

15:48.760 --> 15:50.700
If it was really serious, we would call the cops.

15:50.700 --> 15:54.160
But the proportionality of those three responses was correct.

15:54.160 --> 15:55.320
Not so nowadays.

15:55.320 --> 15:59.640
Nowadays, even the slightest of offenses, which have been rebranded as microaggressions,

15:59.640 --> 16:02.840
to the progressive, are deserving of the most extreme response.

16:02.840 --> 16:06.460
But to most people who have their head on straight, snatching a wig off that lady's

16:06.460 --> 16:08.540
head while drunk is an asshole thing to do.

16:08.540 --> 16:10.940
But it's not worth ruining the guy's life over.

16:10.940 --> 16:15.380
The left is, slowly, finally, beginning to lose some of its cultural dominance.

16:15.380 --> 16:16.640
At least online, anyway.

16:16.640 --> 16:21.160
And I expect their Puritanism to ramp up hard, as their claws are forcefully pried out of

16:21.160 --> 16:22.680
the death grip they've got us all in.

16:22.680 --> 16:27.080
They are just like the religious fundamentalists of yesteryear, who can't leave people alone

16:27.080 --> 16:28.560
to live their private lives.

16:28.560 --> 16:32.040
Who must butt into every space to make sure the proper views are followed.

16:32.040 --> 16:35.520
Who must punish anybody for any deviation from orthodoxy.

16:35.520 --> 16:37.680
These people are butting totalitarians.

16:37.680 --> 16:41.760
They lack the total political power to actually enforce their morality on everybody at all

16:41.760 --> 16:43.980
times like a true totalitarian system would.

16:43.980 --> 16:47.040
And so cancel culture is their next best attempt.

16:47.040 --> 16:51.840
If they can't make it illegal to be a non-progressive, they will make it financially costly, morally

16:51.840 --> 16:54.120
repugnant, and culturally taboo instead.
