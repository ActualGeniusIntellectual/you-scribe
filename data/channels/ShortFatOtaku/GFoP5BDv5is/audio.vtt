WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.800
Hey guys a few things of note before we start this video one is that I apologize

00:04.800 --> 00:08.240
but I was quite sick yesterday and it kind of comes off in the recording

00:08.240 --> 00:13.040
two is that Arsh is sick which is why he didn't show up hey at least I did

00:13.040 --> 00:17.680
and three is that there's a whole bunch of outtakes that can be found on the side channel

00:17.680 --> 00:21.280
Devonatized and also linked at the end of the video so make sure to check those out

00:21.280 --> 00:25.600
enjoy the garbage fest that is Lord of the Rings the rings of power

00:25.600 --> 00:31.760
I know you had covid how's that doing Lilith?

00:32.880 --> 00:36.560
I still feel a little bit sick my throat's a little bit out but

00:37.600 --> 00:46.080
imagine catching covid at this stage embarrassing this would be like my my like fourth time having it

00:47.120 --> 00:52.480
that's brutal you go outside just like a lot I'm kind of jeez I gotta I gotta mute kids here

00:52.480 --> 00:59.840
what the fuck is it is playing audio for you guys yes what the fuck how

01:01.680 --> 01:07.280
it should even be started I think it's just hold on I'm just gonna yeah yeah

01:07.280 --> 01:14.480
Kibs you never understand you never do the audio correctly it always fucks up it's them like this

01:14.480 --> 01:21.520
is the menu right it's them look at that little mute symbol right there muted I feel like they

01:21.520 --> 01:25.920
autoplay the episode to try to make you an interested like they're that desperate also

01:25.920 --> 01:31.920
it's dropped a 3.0 now yeah you know what I think's going on with it man I think like there's

01:31.920 --> 01:38.800
some kind of weird player issue where the where the video is like behind the page still playing

01:40.480 --> 01:44.720
did you get that in some in bed sites where like maybe that's how they get uh our view count

01:44.720 --> 01:54.480
really I mean how else exactly come as a view well one thing I have been noticing is that even

01:54.480 --> 02:01.040
the normies are starting to figure this out those low reviews they just aren't going away

02:01.040 --> 02:06.000
you know they're growing a little bit I have a message for you on behalf of one of our mutual

02:06.000 --> 02:12.320
subscribers he works as a packaging company he told me that um in his packaging place the

02:12.320 --> 02:18.080
amazon stickers and stuff actually arrived a couple months before the launch and most of

02:18.080 --> 02:21.840
the warehouse stuff and they were basically just sort of sitting there and then they finally got

02:21.840 --> 02:26.880
around to using it so they were already pre-planning the uh putting the stickers on

02:26.880 --> 02:33.600
everything yeah and actually speaking of that as well so I have a viewer who's in Montreal

02:33.600 --> 02:39.440
and who sent me basically a giant advertisement that's taking over one of the main

02:40.240 --> 02:46.240
subway stations in Montreal for this show they just like plastered it on the ground they

02:46.240 --> 02:52.080
plastered it on the walls and it's just like please watch so this is like apparently fucking

02:52.080 --> 02:57.760
everywhere right now oh my god there's a there's a payphone still in this station Jesus I feel like

02:57.760 --> 03:04.640
I'm in the 90s again the advertisements get even wackier because for example if you own a

03:05.200 --> 03:10.800
legal copy of photoshop and you were to open it up right now you're gonna get artwork as

03:10.800 --> 03:20.000
a splash screen of lord of the rings as your loading page an adobe deal huh too yep so now

03:20.000 --> 03:26.960
I haven't seen this because I don't have my copy of photoshop legally but if you happen to have

03:27.200 --> 03:34.960
fuck adobe what's going on is adobe has made this big deal with lord of the rings they're

03:34.960 --> 03:39.280
just putting a bunch of lord of the rings shit into the app that you paid for because fuck you

03:39.280 --> 03:45.280
and in fact people have been complaining about it because this guy's like this is revolting I pay

03:45.280 --> 03:50.240
monthly for photoshop and now I'm forced to see an ad for the amazon rings of power series every

03:50.240 --> 03:55.680
time I open it this is a disservice to the to the consumer what is the next step having to see a 30

03:55.680 --> 04:00.880
second ad to save a file it's like fair enough you know I don't want this to be the way that apps

04:00.880 --> 04:06.640
go in the future it's one thing to run ads cyberpunk future oh god you know it's one thing

04:06.640 --> 04:10.240
to run ads on a youtube video it's another thing on an application that you just have on your

04:10.240 --> 04:19.280
computer right and it has been slowly coming out that amazon is offering youtubers big stacks of

04:19.280 --> 04:24.560
money to just blanket praise the show now I haven't gotten my stack yet

04:29.200 --> 04:33.200
suddenly it's a great show yeah so for example this came out with um hello future me

04:33.840 --> 04:39.600
he was given an email from amazon to promote rings of power on his channel he asked amazon

04:39.600 --> 04:43.280
hey can I review it honestly and not just simply praise you and they ghosted him so they are

04:43.280 --> 04:48.320
looking for people who will just say the show is good and will give you a bunch of bezos bucks

04:48.320 --> 04:52.640
this story with hello future me that was reported on bounding into comics so that's something that

04:52.640 --> 04:58.400
everything knows but I have for you a dev exclusive I'm in contact with a youtuber a

04:58.400 --> 05:04.560
friend of mine who is way bigger than all of us way bigger than sargon this friend of mine came

05:04.560 --> 05:11.360
to me in private and showed me an email there is a lord of the rings phone game for this show

05:12.080 --> 05:18.800
that I haven't heard of at all but as part of the promo deal he was offered to do some kind

05:18.800 --> 05:22.400
of promotional tie-in for the phone game as part of the show's advertising project

05:23.040 --> 05:30.400
and he was offered for one change of his profile picture on all of his social media

05:30.400 --> 05:39.040
and two retweets oh that is a lot of money that's wild yeah apparently everyone who has like

05:39.040 --> 05:45.520
millions of subs on youtube they're just getting scattershotted these emails hoping that someone's

05:45.520 --> 05:52.000
gonna bite um well they're probably like from an advertising agency that amazon's contracted you

05:52.000 --> 05:56.400
know gave him a budget said just go pay off these guys to do this like that's pretty common you know

05:56.400 --> 06:02.640
i've i've received from a dozen different companies all offers to do a promo for raid

06:02.640 --> 06:09.440
shadow legends you know it's just big enough yeah i am but i never answer them actually actually

06:10.240 --> 06:14.320
a funny thing my editor keeps saying dev can you please look at the promo folder

06:14.320 --> 06:19.040
just look at some of these we need some money i'm just like i will not compromise my ideals

06:21.520 --> 06:24.960
here's a man of principles are you trying to flex on arch stop that

06:26.240 --> 06:30.640
well here's the thing like i'm not against the idea of doing an ad if it's something i was

06:30.640 --> 06:34.480
already gonna say it's like say the show is good it's like well if i think it is sure

06:35.200 --> 06:38.800
yeah i'm not gonna get bought i'm not gonna be bought though you know it's pretty problematic

06:39.360 --> 06:46.400
too for you because people rely on you to like express yourself honestly and if you compromise

06:46.400 --> 06:52.880
that then people have less reason to listen to you in the future yep yeah for your irreversibly

06:52.880 --> 06:59.920
damaging your uh portfolio yeah you know reputation i would basically only do something if i believed

06:59.920 --> 07:04.400
in it so for example i actually do like hello fresh as a product so i wouldn't mind doing a

07:04.400 --> 07:09.680
hello fresh ad but like i'm not gonna do something unless i unless i don't already believe in it

07:09.680 --> 07:14.240
that's the dev way i guess so wait so in regards to raid shadow legends wouldn't you try it

07:15.280 --> 07:20.960
to find out if you like it what if you like it what if you love it oh god don't make me play

07:20.960 --> 07:27.360
raid shadow legends listen dev come on i hear from arcs all the time it's not get bad cubes

07:27.360 --> 07:32.320
but he always says that on youtube when we're live he always says it when he has a big check

07:32.320 --> 07:38.960
dangling in front of him he's like you know this raid shadow is pretty good actually probably does

07:38.960 --> 07:44.480
feel good when you get a few thousand bucks doesn't it but all right there's lots of advertising

07:44.480 --> 07:49.680
money flying around for this show and absolutely none of it is going to us so let's get it on the

07:49.680 --> 07:57.120
road kibs that's let's watch episode six what's it called uh hold on it is called the phantom

07:57.120 --> 08:02.400
penis the phantom well it was a good guess but it's called undoon which might mean phantom

08:02.400 --> 08:08.080
penis in uh orcish or whatever listen lillith we spent 30 minutes talking about trans stuff before

08:08.080 --> 08:17.680
the call started we can't keep going we can't do it udun let's roll now watch this ah crap

08:17.760 --> 08:24.720
skip the intro basically nice thank you okay it came pre-skipped amazon really does know what we

08:24.720 --> 08:29.600
want it wait hold on it's it was this far along because this is when i stopped it by closing and

08:29.600 --> 08:35.840
opening the window again so it was playing in the background holy shit my theory was correct

08:36.480 --> 08:41.840
they're all fake views that's what it is if you open the page you get it you give them a view

08:41.840 --> 08:48.240
just by opening it even if you don't watch it oh my fucking god i can't believe it yeah

08:48.240 --> 08:52.960
i don't know if that's been proven but we just proved it now listen if you're a conspiracy

08:52.960 --> 08:57.760
theorist that means that you're a fascist according to some kids so you can't promote

08:57.760 --> 09:02.720
these ideas you're gonna get fact checked you get debunked well well it happens sometimes

09:03.680 --> 09:11.040
there's dirty fingies those are his cocaine fingernails probably nice nails oh god have you

09:11.040 --> 09:16.240
seen that picture of princess leia's actress with the cocaine fingernail in the movies look she

09:16.240 --> 09:30.320
likes to play hard i'd like that's why it's liked oh my god the orcs are revolting oh my god wait

09:30.320 --> 09:36.960
pause the video kibs okay i just realized we didn't actually address why ark isn't here

09:36.960 --> 09:41.680
ark sorry yes arch we we didn't we didn't even we forgot

09:44.080 --> 09:49.600

oops yeah oh god i'm sorry guys yeah so i have the coof and lillith has the coof and arch has

09:57.520 --> 10:03.520
the coof but the two of us we have the metal to actually show up and arch is sleeping it off

10:04.000 --> 10:10.960
he's weak to be fair i'm so fucking brain fogged i'm so brain fogged right now that like i didn't

10:10.960 --> 10:15.520
even think to fucking oh my god i didn't even think to tell you guys that arch isn't here i'm

10:15.520 --> 10:20.400
sorry arch isn't here i'm sure he'll be back next week with apologies and chocolates he'll

10:20.400 --> 10:28.720
never apologize but you can you can hope i guess god damn it well we watched the entire episode

10:28.720 --> 10:34.240
with him just to torture yeah no we didn't record it all right let's go let's see let's

10:34.240 --> 10:41.120
see the trial that awaits us they got a fat one this is what liberals look like

10:42.480 --> 10:48.000
dude they ruined it with more wokeness dude that guy was like oh shit i probably chose

10:48.000 --> 10:53.040
the wrong team and the bad guy are we the baddies

10:53.040 --> 10:58.400
they looked like it i don't know they look pretty trustworthy to me

10:58.400 --> 11:03.760
they're brave beautiful stunning immigrants okay they've come here looking for a new life

11:06.080 --> 11:12.880
you ever look at those like portland and teeth and look shots it's just these guys oh god it is yeah

11:12.880 --> 11:17.360
taftas are you gonna start like skull measuring soon is the skull measuring arc

11:18.080 --> 11:26.720
yeah exactly and they're gone are they gonna sneak attack first strike bonus

11:32.320 --> 11:39.600
wait is this plan just to like okay solo them oh the tower's gonna collapse

11:41.840 --> 11:45.680
okay wait whoa whoa whoa that seems like a bit okay

11:47.360 --> 11:51.120
i don't get this

11:53.920 --> 11:58.160
and trap them in there yep wait what happened to the horde of orcs coming up

11:59.680 --> 12:00.640
they all went in i guess

12:03.520 --> 12:04.240
i guess so

12:04.240 --> 12:08.000
oh

12:13.680 --> 12:18.800
jesus now how'd they get over there and they have oh i have a problem with that

12:19.520 --> 12:22.000
those lights could be seen for miles yep

12:22.720 --> 12:24.480
we have to make ready the village

12:27.680 --> 12:34.320
wait the the far less defensible village the castle was yeah i was gonna say that narrow

12:34.320 --> 12:38.480
pass they would never be able to breach if they barricaded it not in a reasonable time span

12:38.480 --> 12:43.280
that's what i was gonna say they seem a bit close to the army yeah just a pinch

12:44.080 --> 12:47.360
all right so we just saw the the anti-helms deep all right

12:52.960 --> 12:53.920
god jesus

12:56.080 --> 13:00.320
where's his liver that's a waste at least give it to the horde all right

13:02.160 --> 13:05.760
you know i don't like the whole wearing plate armor in the deck of a ship thing

13:08.080 --> 13:12.240
like that that's something you put on once you're getting ready to to leave the ship

13:12.240 --> 13:18.480
because you're not you can't swim in that shit uh yeah you're right you just sink instantly yeah

13:19.200 --> 13:24.800
i just noticed her hair when braided is the same length as her hair when not braided

13:24.800 --> 13:29.600
you think she uses extensions in the show i mean from what i understand of women's hair that's not

13:29.600 --> 13:32.720
really that possible i've seen the only braided hair a whole bunch of times it always gets

13:32.720 --> 13:37.840
shorter it doesn't get that much shorter though yes it depends on how big your braids are yomi

13:37.840 --> 13:43.200
has a lot of hair and it does get noticeably shorter it's like down to her butt at this point

13:49.120 --> 13:51.840
oh but the kid's gonna know he's gonna follow him

13:54.080 --> 14:02.720
i think that's good protection okay just that'll stop him

14:04.000 --> 14:10.640
all who cannot fight will be barricaded inside this is to be our peace our fallback point

14:10.720 --> 14:17.520
okay take off all of you the wooden thatch building that's flammable is

14:18.400 --> 14:21.200
the final step i don't know i don't know about this one

14:27.120 --> 14:35.920
isn't this a quote from the main movies uh kind of sounds like it in fact it's trying to imitate

14:35.920 --> 14:40.480
it i'm pretty sure but i don't think they've ever said that movies there was even something similar

14:40.480 --> 14:45.840
in the previous episode when elrond was was getting his own pep talk they are trying to

14:45.840 --> 14:50.560
imitate the uh the original peter jackson movies though and this whole sequence does feel like that

14:50.560 --> 14:58.000
mandalorian episode now which one the one where um mando and kara dune are basically teaching the

14:58.000 --> 15:01.920
villagers how to fight because they're going to get invaded and they're setting up traps and

15:01.920 --> 15:06.320
they're like learning it's a trope that's used in a lot of movies where the villagers have to defend

15:06.400 --> 15:10.880
home and there's the one warrior that knows what he's doing yep they're like a bit short notice

15:10.880 --> 15:17.920
like they were just right there next to like the orcs that kind of work and they escaped with

15:17.920 --> 15:23.760
enough time to do this best part is this little village is like right below the castle so you

15:23.760 --> 15:36.080
think the orcs would be like looking like hey wait a minute he wants to plant some

15:37.040 --> 15:42.560
oh they finally kissed that actress is really pretty i don't blame him

15:43.200 --> 15:46.960
look at how tiny that village looks but holy smokes it's like three buildings

15:48.320 --> 15:52.720
there's like 40 people that live in them it's like if you're playing an old rpg in the super

15:52.720 --> 15:57.440
nintendo it's like this is a big town and there's like five buildings oh god

16:00.880 --> 16:05.360
i ate a bunch of spicy ramen before we started just to try and keep my sinuses open and now

16:05.360 --> 16:13.120
they're starting to close again definitely a good move like you guys had a full day you could have

16:13.120 --> 16:17.040
just ran and with the sick of the elderly like i'll give them that they probably wouldn't have

16:17.040 --> 16:22.960
gotten far yeah but they can only travel at night their enemies that's true that doesn't give them a

16:23.600 --> 16:31.200
advantage yeah 16 hours versus eight and you open move to an open field and cross the planes

16:31.280 --> 16:35.680
like what are they gonna do is that their battering ram

16:40.080 --> 16:43.200
oh jesus rip

16:48.320 --> 16:50.080
the hammering sickle always wins

16:54.720 --> 16:56.000
well if you had the same idea

17:01.360 --> 17:03.360
boom oh did they just like

17:07.040 --> 17:11.040
oh it's like oops laugh track

17:11.840 --> 17:14.880
hahaha

17:28.080 --> 17:30.480
jesus look at that grandma shield maiden going

17:31.760 --> 17:38.000
oh yeah if archer here he's tearing that apart listen old lady's still got some spirit

17:41.680 --> 17:42.400
just eats him

17:49.600 --> 17:55.120
wait when did the elves learn kung fu uh when they need them to

17:58.480 --> 18:02.880
get started in the hobbit just got worse

18:11.280 --> 18:17.040
jesus that's a bit much

18:23.200 --> 18:27.760
gooey's gonna get his mouth let's not kiss this time that's uh

18:35.280 --> 18:38.960
it all happened off screen they've actually won yes

18:41.280 --> 18:42.880
that's how you save on budget

18:51.360 --> 18:57.680
okay i picked the wrong side i mean they're still bad guys like they betrayed them yeah

18:59.040 --> 19:04.800
why are all the betrayers black or brown what what is this show trying to say

19:05.760 --> 19:11.280
okay here we go gingers are also a minority oh shit

19:17.920 --> 19:21.120
knew that victory was too easy yeah it's time to go inside guys

19:24.480 --> 19:25.600
oh there goes the girlfriend

19:26.240 --> 19:35.200
key to the key to the tavern tavern yes let's all huddle up inside a wooden building that the

19:35.200 --> 19:40.960
enemy could just burn down very easily i have a feeling the uh newman orange will show up just

19:40.960 --> 19:49.440
in the nick of time very nice of the orcs to just let them do this give them the breathing room

19:49.840 --> 20:07.280
um-hmm that blood's coming up fast by the way yeah yeah

20:07.280 --> 20:10.400
the wake up mother

20:17.440 --> 20:20.720
oh my god so is she just holding her breath i guess

20:23.200 --> 20:27.760
i just wanted to see how long i could hold my breath it works up in mighty quiet

20:27.760 --> 20:33.280
while they were doing the entire thing no they're it's a turn-based game they're waiting their turn

20:33.520 --> 20:38.800
hey we're here so that they came to save this village i guess

20:40.560 --> 20:43.840
apparently they knew this specific village is under attack too yeah

20:48.000 --> 20:55.440
you can only just stand there and wait for it yeah yeah at this point

21:04.000 --> 21:08.000
so

21:10.720 --> 21:14.400
so i guess archer's theory that there's a time skip was wrong

21:16.000 --> 21:22.480
yep which makes the story a lot dumber let me guess they gave they did that just so the bad

21:22.480 --> 21:27.920
guy could get the weapon so i can get away with the weapon to be a problem later oh god

21:28.720 --> 21:36.160
you know

21:39.200 --> 21:47.520
the action's actually not bad yeah we're actually there yeah it's actually a lot more entertaining

21:47.520 --> 21:50.960
than the horror footage i'll give them that i don't think we're seeing them this episode

21:51.760 --> 21:56.560
i think the focus he has on the this storyline yeah which i kind of prefer to be honest with you

21:57.360 --> 22:02.320
so where an entire squad of elves fell to this guy gladiel's just gonna do it

22:04.160 --> 22:06.400
yeah she's she's got girl power

22:11.200 --> 22:18.880
oh shit she used the speed buff she popped it you know i will say this for this show

22:19.520 --> 22:22.480
they're clearly like going out into the woods and shooting this there

22:23.440 --> 22:26.160
it's not just cg nonsense it's like all right good

22:27.760 --> 22:32.880
they're putting on the afro problem is it's just only did the same thing for the writing

22:32.880 --> 22:37.440
wait how do you get ahead that's an excellent question

22:45.280 --> 22:46.880
we still have to find out his lore

22:47.440 --> 22:51.280
i need him yeah end his neck

22:53.920 --> 22:55.280
straight down it is

23:00.720 --> 23:09.280
unsatisfies it by drinking semen

23:17.040 --> 23:23.280
preferred pronouns so wait is the implication here is that he's

23:24.240 --> 23:31.440
with the what the urakai came from that's what they're trying to say yeah probably

23:32.240 --> 23:37.120
you know i don't think that's how that works because the orcs are elves those are the ones

23:37.120 --> 23:43.840
that were taken by yeah they're like corrupted elves they were dragged down to the earth that's

23:43.840 --> 23:49.600
why they pulled them out of the mud creations of the one master of the secret fire the same as you

23:50.560 --> 23:59.360
is worthy of the breath of life and just as worthy of a home oh my god the orcs aren't bad guys now

24:05.760 --> 24:08.000
the framing is so reactionary

24:08.640 --> 24:13.760
it's clearly they're not worthy of the same like dignity

24:16.320 --> 24:20.080
so the story implication is that like some people are just unequal

24:22.000 --> 24:29.200
and it's wrong to believe this yeah because like the villain here is saying we're all equal

24:29.200 --> 24:35.360
everyone's the same he's a socialist show gonna be like no actually people aren't equal

24:36.320 --> 24:42.080
well here's the thing teftash if you're a maggot shud for example then you're not equal

24:43.840 --> 24:47.920
oh the orcs the orcs the orcs are trump supporters

24:50.400 --> 24:52.880
they deserve to be banned from twitter immediately

24:53.680 --> 25:00.800
oh my god so true and the good and the beautiful are people like galadriel who vote with her

25:01.760 --> 25:10.640
perhaps they really have no reason to keep them alive no if i could just hold on to that feeling

25:12.880 --> 25:16.160
keep it with me don't stop believing

25:19.680 --> 25:26.640
what they're gonna bang alpha c kibs what what the heck

25:26.640 --> 25:34.480
they really are just adding whatever they want i guess romance of galadriel okay

25:35.120 --> 25:43.280
bit strange but all right look that's the power of himbo okay halbrand played by hasan piker

25:45.120 --> 25:50.560
you know most of the town is dead half of them joined the enemy and a bunch of them died like

25:51.440 --> 25:56.640
party party dev this town is uh gonna be a bit scarred you might say

25:57.760 --> 25:59.280
get over really quickly okay

26:05.120 --> 26:12.560
actually most of them are dead girl bosses girl bosses look at underneath her armpit

26:12.560 --> 26:16.480
she's wearing the t-shirt wait they're not just gonna keep it here are they

26:16.800 --> 26:22.800
yeah wouldn't it want to return it to like a more secure place the front line i'll be fine

26:28.000 --> 26:34.960
you must not accept the dark side yes that that was what sam that was what sam said to frodo

26:34.960 --> 26:39.120
oh is it like literally the same words yeah i i just watched it like a little bit ago

26:39.680 --> 26:44.080
was it resist the ring of sword power yeah they're doing the same thing like they're

26:44.080 --> 26:49.200
gonna use the sword like the ring the same trope just say precious do it oh wait hold on

26:55.280 --> 26:59.360
oh my oh wait you got away with it anyways

27:14.960 --> 27:20.400
yeah i'm not sure that the the various sauron artifacts had the same pull as the one ring did

27:23.280 --> 27:26.160
yeah they're leaning in on trying to copy it too much

27:27.600 --> 27:35.360
uh wait a minute it's just the key to the dam

27:40.240 --> 27:43.600
the message of the story is that infrastructure is evil

27:44.640 --> 27:49.120
it's cursed dams this is what hydropower does

27:51.440 --> 27:54.560
this is what happens if you raise taxes and build a dam guys

27:55.360 --> 28:02.480
they want to move away from coal saron's work he's all about green energy

28:02.640 --> 28:10.880
so

28:11.920 --> 28:13.600
oh it's coming through all the tunnels first

28:18.000 --> 28:24.880
it's all part of their plan they dug this thing

28:24.880 --> 28:32.880
so wait what where's okay

28:37.520 --> 28:39.040
oh they're making obsidian

28:43.040 --> 28:50.560
no minecraft reference no yeah no they're trying to get another i have many questions

28:55.600 --> 28:58.320
and how they knew how to do this and how that works

29:02.240 --> 29:04.480
and so now that wait what the orcs are free now

29:07.200 --> 29:11.440
oh jesus okay that doesn't happen in minecraft

29:14.400 --> 29:21.200
poor villagers take catch a break wait take shelter they're all on fire take take shelter

29:22.080 --> 29:27.040
and all the buildings that are on fire yes and all the buildings that are all made out of straw

29:29.680 --> 29:32.480
oh wait is this how it becomes the black lands

29:35.120 --> 29:39.920
probably but it feels a bit weird that this is the reason why

29:40.720 --> 29:43.840
no you know what they're doing they're making mount doom that's what they did

29:46.000 --> 29:47.680
it's the origin story

29:51.440 --> 29:56.560
mount doom didn't exist it had like we had to show it being created yep

30:02.080 --> 30:02.640
she's dead

30:08.400 --> 30:12.320
oh so the other guy escaped how did he escape how does everyone just escape all the time

30:12.320 --> 30:27.360
oh my fucking god all right another episode of the greatest television series okay

30:29.040 --> 30:33.200
the world's beginning to disagree with that sentiment they're a bunch of

30:34.080 --> 30:34.880
liars

30:39.520 --> 30:45.040
they're all gonna die from like the the just the ash alone like they're waiting for the volcano

30:45.040 --> 30:49.840
okay or just that that is a big enough eruption that it's going to cause like a nuclear winter

30:49.840 --> 30:56.080
on the planet the next few years no crops yeah it's gonna be pretty bad so um i'm curious as

30:56.080 --> 31:00.720
to how they're gonna roll this off and like the next episode we'll have like some ash land and

31:00.800 --> 31:07.200
then they'll be like oh it's all better now okay so i just wanna i just wanna see if we can parse

31:07.200 --> 31:13.920
this so somehow the old man who he must be dead that guy like he's fucked he gets a hold of the

31:13.920 --> 31:21.920
key and he opens the dam not knowing what it does but he opens the dam and they just they they built

31:22.880 --> 31:30.960
not bad yeah he's like oh he's like oh shit what did i do he's like an idiot okay so he opens the

31:30.960 --> 31:37.040
dam and the water floods down and but then they built these canals and they just knew to do this

31:37.040 --> 31:42.560
i guess they had it all this is all part of their plan this is a big plan to use the water to ignite

31:42.560 --> 31:49.920
the magma because that would guaranteeably cause mount doom to explode that seems a bit contrived

31:49.920 --> 31:54.320
i'm not gonna lie yeah okay so i i know it's a thing in warhammer for example there's a

31:54.320 --> 31:57.840
bunch of tunnels underground that go deep and deep and deep and there's a bunch of things

31:57.840 --> 32:02.560
that happen down in the tunnels but i don't think that if you were to dig deep enough

32:02.560 --> 32:09.920
you would find a giant hole that's like huge several kilometers just a big cave

32:09.920 --> 32:14.320
down to the center of the earth where all the lava hangs out like i don't think that's how that works

32:14.320 --> 32:23.920
um you generally you should take geology class dub because i think it's perfectly accurate

32:24.480 --> 32:35.280
because uh there's always gonna be a lava a giant lava cape yeah yeah a lava but not necessarily

32:35.280 --> 32:42.720
okay and it funnels it up perfectly so it explodes outwards and basically creates a bomb

32:43.280 --> 32:48.480
you see the water yeah the water was basically a chain reaction don't ask me how but it basically

32:48.480 --> 32:54.880
caused it to boom boom yeah let me okay so that part i could actually see because like i've seen

32:55.760 --> 33:00.160
um you know how lava reacts by having water poured on it really quickly or like the inverse

33:01.600 --> 33:06.880
it gets violent yeah it erupts so i've seen stuff like that yeah like if you if you because

33:07.600 --> 33:12.000
the the heat wants to rise and so it goes through the cold and like pressurizes upwards so

33:12.000 --> 33:17.680
i get that i just don't buy there's a giant fucking cave down there well i feel like the

33:17.680 --> 33:23.040
more realistic thing to happen would be like the cave collapsing in on itself yeah if it's not like

33:24.720 --> 33:30.240
yeah but like i get why they wouldn't show that because it would it wouldn't look good

33:30.240 --> 33:34.560
if it was just like a tube it's a lot more impressive to show like a giant cave

33:35.040 --> 33:42.000
mm-hmm and also like i think there was lightning in in the eruption like where did the lightning

33:42.000 --> 33:50.080
come from from the evil from the feels wrong but i feel like there's gonna be some geology

33:50.080 --> 33:56.800
nerd who's like um actually that makes perfect sense yes so this episode went from like kind

33:56.800 --> 34:02.560
of ridiculous start with some of the fighting but then like the main bulk of the action was actually

34:02.560 --> 34:08.720
like half decent and then it was like what it just spun off into ridiculousness right in the

34:08.720 --> 34:14.800
last five minutes where it's just like oh a lot cooler things could have happened rather than like

34:14.800 --> 34:19.840
the explosions in the water like what if it unleashed like some like ancient evil beast

34:20.720 --> 34:26.240
and that's terrorizing them maybe that would be that would be cool that'd be quite this

34:26.240 --> 34:30.720
spectacle and i feel like it would make more sense because you could just like lock it behind doors

34:30.720 --> 34:38.720
and then it would like awaken with the ancient magics also i don't like this trend where we have

34:38.720 --> 34:43.840
to show where like fucking everything comes from we don't need to know where mount dune comes from

34:45.200 --> 34:50.080
oh fuck solo don't remind me it's like we have to have origin stories for everything like this

34:50.080 --> 34:55.120
is why it's ashen like dude sometimes maybe the land is just that way because of the positioning

34:55.120 --> 35:01.440
well especially with lord of the rings right one of the amazing things that toki did was like he

35:01.440 --> 35:08.240
knew when to have mystery in the stories i went to let your imagination fill in the gaps so i

35:08.240 --> 35:14.720
hope we don't go down the path of explaining every little thing the note we gotta it's gotta all be

35:14.720 --> 35:20.160
rationalistically explained nothing can just be for flair anymore well i think it works for some

35:20.160 --> 35:27.520
stories but i think that other times it can just be like a cheap way of sort of drawing connections

35:27.520 --> 35:33.920
between yourself and the previous source material in a way that ends up like cheapening outwards

35:33.920 --> 35:38.640
the source material i mean like midichlorians is like the perfect old school example of this

35:38.640 --> 35:44.960
because there is so much like mysticism and interest and intrigue in the forest and that

35:44.960 --> 35:50.640
was kind of stripped away and that sucks because that mysticism was like a very

35:51.920 --> 35:58.240
i think it was a core part of what made the force so cool and to kind of remove that sucked

36:00.000 --> 36:05.840
yeah yeah i agree and the same thing with mordor here like we're seeing how mordor was formed but

36:07.440 --> 36:12.800
i don't i i think it might even make it less interesting to know that oh it turns out that

36:12.800 --> 36:19.040
it was foreign because an idiot opened the gate to a dam and then the water rushed in and caused

36:19.040 --> 36:25.440
a volcanic eruption that that is a lot less interesting than you know it's it's the land

36:25.440 --> 36:33.120
of the dark lord what like what is what does he even have the motivation to do that at the end

36:34.160 --> 36:40.720
like you know your bosses are like defeated bro like why are you still working for him

36:40.720 --> 36:47.120
i guess in for penny in for buck i guess i mean maybe killed a teenager so but he also seemed

36:47.120 --> 36:52.080
stupid like he was kind of not necessarily possessed in the same way as the ring by the

36:52.080 --> 36:56.640
sword but he it seems like he had some kind of compulsion maybe because there was that earlier

36:56.640 --> 37:02.000
scene where he's talking to the kid and he's like no sauron is kid he's kind of acting like a crack

37:02.000 --> 37:09.680
dealer so maybe maybe it's like a yeah he's like schizophrenic for sauron when he talked about

37:09.680 --> 37:17.520
orcs he talked about the fact that uh yeah i remember he was lamenting about the sun how he

37:17.520 --> 37:24.000
was gonna have to blot it out so this is this is him doing that because yeah oh yeah yeah yeah

37:24.000 --> 37:28.640
that was a couple episodes ago but i do remember that i mean that's kind of a cool connection then

37:29.520 --> 37:35.040
i kind of want to see like i want to see a prequel to this prequel literally called

37:35.040 --> 37:40.960
schizo for sauron and it's like a romance between sauron and like him when he was younger

37:42.320 --> 37:45.520
yeah i was just totally in his head

37:48.560 --> 37:51.680
jesus oh my god and it's framed like a romantic comedy

37:55.120 --> 38:02.560
oh sauron oh you i wonder what arch is going to say about this when he sees it

38:03.200 --> 38:06.880
oh he's gonna be he's gonna be fucking enraged i think

38:10.640 --> 38:17.440
oh god the the spicy is the spicy noodles have fully worn off i think i i think i need to get

38:17.440 --> 38:24.560
to bed before before i like fully descend into madness you i'm sure you've all seen a game of

38:24.560 --> 38:30.080
thrones and how there was that usually there's like that one big episode where they they cut

38:30.080 --> 38:34.880
all the side stories and they focus on one arc so they did like battle of the black water where

38:34.880 --> 38:42.640
it was just that fight or they did the battle at um at the wall where it was just the wildlings

38:42.640 --> 38:47.920
attacking castle black and i think they really wanted this to feel like that like they were just

38:47.920 --> 38:53.680
doing one thing today and it's going to be this fight and that's it and they were kind of really

38:53.680 --> 39:00.400
trying to do it to do that kind of thing but it just felt sort of cheap yeah i'm not exactly sure

39:00.400 --> 39:07.280
why i think it's because we just don't have the same one location but well the same connection

39:07.280 --> 39:11.760
to the characters yeah that's what it is yeah there's no connection to the characters and i

39:11.760 --> 39:16.400
don't care about any of them with the exception of maybe the villain who seems he's kind of

39:16.400 --> 39:22.960
interesting even if it breaks lore conventions still with with the urakai but fine he's at least

39:22.960 --> 39:28.800
he has at least has a character the urakai urakai are the thing saruman made he's an uruk

39:29.760 --> 39:36.160
yeah he's at the precursor right if you they're claiming that he's like the first or part of the

39:36.160 --> 39:42.400
first urics that they were that close but which is weird because from my understanding of the lore

39:42.400 --> 39:48.480
is that the urics all came out like the orcs we know because they were but they're all that

39:48.480 --> 39:53.840
corrupted and warped and twisted they weren't really elven looking anymore well maybe he's

39:53.840 --> 40:07.760
a work in progress you know they didn't finish him you know at least there was no harfoots

40:08.960 --> 40:16.240
that's true the next episode will be 100 harfoots that's also just as a horror

40:16.720 --> 40:22.560
just to make up for it how many how many episodes left so there's eight right so there's two more

40:22.560 --> 40:29.200
to go in this season and there's five seasons god help us all this this seems to be like too

40:30.000 --> 40:37.120
early an episode for a giant climax like this yeah i agree i think this is like the fake-out

40:37.120 --> 40:40.960
episode because there's gonna be like another episode because now now the war is gonna have

40:40.960 --> 40:46.400
to escalate because now the orcs have the power of darkness on their side so like the good guys

40:46.400 --> 40:51.520
are gonna be on the back foot next episode is what i had to guess yeah these guys because then

40:51.520 --> 40:55.120
they're gonna have to retreat and they're going to go back and get like a bigger army and then form

40:55.120 --> 41:00.960
the uh recall because this is gonna lead to the last alliance of men and elves which is that big

41:00.960 --> 41:06.000
battle at the beginning of fellowship of the ring the elves and men uh basically are fighting you

41:06.000 --> 41:12.320
know saron mordor this is all leading up to that point so i don't know where we are on the timeline

41:12.320 --> 41:18.400
before that but isildur is here so i don't know yeah maybe that's the plan but isildur is middle

41:18.400 --> 41:24.480
aged still has to like have his balls drop a bit more yeah he's gotta he's gotta become more of a

41:24.480 --> 41:29.840
leader and he hasn't really gone through a leadership arc well to be fair he does end up

41:29.840 --> 41:36.800
like not destroying the ring so maybe he could just be a be not a leader right up to the end

41:37.360 --> 41:40.880
i guess that's the thing about an episode like this is there's actually not much to talk about

41:40.880 --> 41:45.840
you know it wasn't they weren't jumping around between different scenes and we couldn't like oh

41:45.840 --> 41:52.240
well here's what happened with elrond and like it really was just one scene and the battle happened
