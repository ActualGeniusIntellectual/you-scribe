0	4800	Hey guys a few things of note before we start this video one is that I apologize
4800	8240	but I was quite sick yesterday and it kind of comes off in the recording
8240	13040	two is that Arsh is sick which is why he didn't show up hey at least I did
13040	17680	and three is that there's a whole bunch of outtakes that can be found on the side channel
17680	21280	Devonatized and also linked at the end of the video so make sure to check those out
21280	25600	enjoy the garbage fest that is Lord of the Rings the rings of power
25600	31760	I know you had covid how's that doing Lilith?
32880	36560	I still feel a little bit sick my throat's a little bit out but
37600	46080	imagine catching covid at this stage embarrassing this would be like my my like fourth time having it
47120	52480	that's brutal you go outside just like a lot I'm kind of jeez I gotta I gotta mute kids here
52480	59840	what the fuck is it is playing audio for you guys yes what the fuck how
61680	67280	it should even be started I think it's just hold on I'm just gonna yeah yeah
67280	74480	Kibs you never understand you never do the audio correctly it always fucks up it's them like this
74480	81520	is the menu right it's them look at that little mute symbol right there muted I feel like they
81520	85920	autoplay the episode to try to make you an interested like they're that desperate also
85920	91920	it's dropped a 3.0 now yeah you know what I think's going on with it man I think like there's
91920	98800	some kind of weird player issue where the where the video is like behind the page still playing
100480	104720	did you get that in some in bed sites where like maybe that's how they get uh our view count
104720	114480	really I mean how else exactly come as a view well one thing I have been noticing is that even
114480	121040	the normies are starting to figure this out those low reviews they just aren't going away
121040	126000	you know they're growing a little bit I have a message for you on behalf of one of our mutual
126000	132320	subscribers he works as a packaging company he told me that um in his packaging place the
132320	138080	amazon stickers and stuff actually arrived a couple months before the launch and most of
138080	141840	the warehouse stuff and they were basically just sort of sitting there and then they finally got
141840	146880	around to using it so they were already pre-planning the uh putting the stickers on
146880	153600	everything yeah and actually speaking of that as well so I have a viewer who's in Montreal
153600	159440	and who sent me basically a giant advertisement that's taking over one of the main
160240	166240	subway stations in Montreal for this show they just like plastered it on the ground they
166240	172080	plastered it on the walls and it's just like please watch so this is like apparently fucking
172080	177760	everywhere right now oh my god there's a there's a payphone still in this station Jesus I feel like
177760	184640	I'm in the 90s again the advertisements get even wackier because for example if you own a
185200	190800	legal copy of photoshop and you were to open it up right now you're gonna get artwork as
190800	200000	a splash screen of lord of the rings as your loading page an adobe deal huh too yep so now
200000	206960	I haven't seen this because I don't have my copy of photoshop legally but if you happen to have
207200	214960	fuck adobe what's going on is adobe has made this big deal with lord of the rings they're
214960	219280	just putting a bunch of lord of the rings shit into the app that you paid for because fuck you
219280	225280	and in fact people have been complaining about it because this guy's like this is revolting I pay
225280	230240	monthly for photoshop and now I'm forced to see an ad for the amazon rings of power series every
230240	235680	time I open it this is a disservice to the to the consumer what is the next step having to see a 30
235680	240880	second ad to save a file it's like fair enough you know I don't want this to be the way that apps
240880	246640	go in the future it's one thing to run ads cyberpunk future oh god you know it's one thing
246640	250240	to run ads on a youtube video it's another thing on an application that you just have on your
250240	259280	computer right and it has been slowly coming out that amazon is offering youtubers big stacks of
259280	264560	money to just blanket praise the show now I haven't gotten my stack yet
269200	273200	suddenly it's a great show yeah so for example this came out with um hello future me
273840	279600	he was given an email from amazon to promote rings of power on his channel he asked amazon
279600	283280	hey can I review it honestly and not just simply praise you and they ghosted him so they are
283280	288320	looking for people who will just say the show is good and will give you a bunch of bezos bucks
288320	292640	this story with hello future me that was reported on bounding into comics so that's something that
292640	298400	everything knows but I have for you a dev exclusive I'm in contact with a youtuber a
298400	304560	friend of mine who is way bigger than all of us way bigger than sargon this friend of mine came
304560	311360	to me in private and showed me an email there is a lord of the rings phone game for this show
312080	318800	that I haven't heard of at all but as part of the promo deal he was offered to do some kind
318800	322400	of promotional tie-in for the phone game as part of the show's advertising project
323040	330400	and he was offered for one change of his profile picture on all of his social media
330400	339040	and two retweets oh that is a lot of money that's wild yeah apparently everyone who has like
339040	345520	millions of subs on youtube they're just getting scattershotted these emails hoping that someone's
345520	352000	gonna bite um well they're probably like from an advertising agency that amazon's contracted you
352000	356400	know gave him a budget said just go pay off these guys to do this like that's pretty common you know
356400	362640	i've i've received from a dozen different companies all offers to do a promo for raid
362640	369440	shadow legends you know it's just big enough yeah i am but i never answer them actually actually
370240	374320	a funny thing my editor keeps saying dev can you please look at the promo folder
374320	379040	just look at some of these we need some money i'm just like i will not compromise my ideals
381520	384960	here's a man of principles are you trying to flex on arch stop that
386240	390640	well here's the thing like i'm not against the idea of doing an ad if it's something i was
390640	394480	already gonna say it's like say the show is good it's like well if i think it is sure
395200	398800	yeah i'm not gonna get bought i'm not gonna be bought though you know it's pretty problematic
399360	406400	too for you because people rely on you to like express yourself honestly and if you compromise
406400	412880	that then people have less reason to listen to you in the future yep yeah for your irreversibly
412880	419920	damaging your uh portfolio yeah you know reputation i would basically only do something if i believed
419920	424400	in it so for example i actually do like hello fresh as a product so i wouldn't mind doing a
424400	429680	hello fresh ad but like i'm not gonna do something unless i unless i don't already believe in it
429680	434240	that's the dev way i guess so wait so in regards to raid shadow legends wouldn't you try it
435280	440960	to find out if you like it what if you like it what if you love it oh god don't make me play
440960	447360	raid shadow legends listen dev come on i hear from arcs all the time it's not get bad cubes
447360	452320	but he always says that on youtube when we're live he always says it when he has a big check
452320	458960	dangling in front of him he's like you know this raid shadow is pretty good actually probably does
458960	464480	feel good when you get a few thousand bucks doesn't it but all right there's lots of advertising
464480	469680	money flying around for this show and absolutely none of it is going to us so let's get it on the
469680	477120	road kibs that's let's watch episode six what's it called uh hold on it is called the phantom
477120	482400	penis the phantom well it was a good guess but it's called undoon which might mean phantom
482400	488080	penis in uh orcish or whatever listen lillith we spent 30 minutes talking about trans stuff before
488080	497680	the call started we can't keep going we can't do it udun let's roll now watch this ah crap
497760	504720	skip the intro basically nice thank you okay it came pre-skipped amazon really does know what we
504720	509600	want it wait hold on it's it was this far along because this is when i stopped it by closing and
509600	515840	opening the window again so it was playing in the background holy shit my theory was correct
516480	521840	they're all fake views that's what it is if you open the page you get it you give them a view
521840	528240	just by opening it even if you don't watch it oh my fucking god i can't believe it yeah
528240	532960	i don't know if that's been proven but we just proved it now listen if you're a conspiracy
532960	537760	theorist that means that you're a fascist according to some kids so you can't promote
537760	542720	these ideas you're gonna get fact checked you get debunked well well it happens sometimes
543680	551040	there's dirty fingies those are his cocaine fingernails probably nice nails oh god have you
551040	556240	seen that picture of princess leia's actress with the cocaine fingernail in the movies look she
556240	570320	likes to play hard i'd like that's why it's liked oh my god the orcs are revolting oh my god wait
570320	576960	pause the video kibs okay i just realized we didn't actually address why ark isn't here
576960	581680	ark sorry yes arch we we didn't we didn't even we forgot
584080	589600	whoops oh my god we talked about it literally before the stream or the recording so
589600	597520	oops yeah oh god i'm sorry guys yeah so i have the coof and lillith has the coof and arch has
597520	603520	the coof but the two of us we have the metal to actually show up and arch is sleeping it off
604000	610960	he's weak to be fair i'm so fucking brain fogged i'm so brain fogged right now that like i didn't
610960	615520	even think to fucking oh my god i didn't even think to tell you guys that arch isn't here i'm
615520	620400	sorry arch isn't here i'm sure he'll be back next week with apologies and chocolates he'll
620400	628720	never apologize but you can you can hope i guess god damn it well we watched the entire episode
628720	634240	with him just to torture yeah no we didn't record it all right let's go let's see let's
634240	641120	see the trial that awaits us they got a fat one this is what liberals look like
642480	648000	dude they ruined it with more wokeness dude that guy was like oh shit i probably chose
648000	653040	the wrong team and the bad guy are we the baddies
653040	658400	they looked like it i don't know they look pretty trustworthy to me
658400	663760	they're brave beautiful stunning immigrants okay they've come here looking for a new life
666080	672880	you ever look at those like portland and teeth and look shots it's just these guys oh god it is yeah
672880	677360	taftas are you gonna start like skull measuring soon is the skull measuring arc
678080	686720	yeah exactly and they're gone are they gonna sneak attack first strike bonus
692320	699600	wait is this plan just to like okay solo them oh the tower's gonna collapse
701840	705680	okay wait whoa whoa whoa that seems like a bit okay
707360	711120	i don't get this
713920	718160	and trap them in there yep wait what happened to the horde of orcs coming up
719680	720640	they all went in i guess
723520	724240	i guess so
724240	728000	oh
733680	738800	jesus now how'd they get over there and they have oh i have a problem with that
739520	742000	those lights could be seen for miles yep
742720	744480	we have to make ready the village
747680	754320	wait the the far less defensible village the castle was yeah i was gonna say that narrow
754320	758480	pass they would never be able to breach if they barricaded it not in a reasonable time span
758480	763280	that's what i was gonna say they seem a bit close to the army yeah just a pinch
764080	767360	all right so we just saw the the anti-helms deep all right
772960	773920	god jesus
776080	780320	where's his liver that's a waste at least give it to the horde all right
782160	785760	you know i don't like the whole wearing plate armor in the deck of a ship thing
788080	792240	like that that's something you put on once you're getting ready to to leave the ship
792240	798480	because you're not you can't swim in that shit uh yeah you're right you just sink instantly yeah
799200	804800	i just noticed her hair when braided is the same length as her hair when not braided
804800	809600	you think she uses extensions in the show i mean from what i understand of women's hair that's not
809600	812720	really that possible i've seen the only braided hair a whole bunch of times it always gets
812720	817840	shorter it doesn't get that much shorter though yes it depends on how big your braids are yomi
817840	823200	has a lot of hair and it does get noticeably shorter it's like down to her butt at this point
829120	831840	oh but the kid's gonna know he's gonna follow him
834080	842720	i think that's good protection okay just that'll stop him
844000	850640	all who cannot fight will be barricaded inside this is to be our peace our fallback point
850720	857520	okay take off all of you the wooden thatch building that's flammable is
858400	861200	the final step i don't know i don't know about this one
867120	875920	isn't this a quote from the main movies uh kind of sounds like it in fact it's trying to imitate
875920	880480	it i'm pretty sure but i don't think they've ever said that movies there was even something similar
880480	885840	in the previous episode when elrond was was getting his own pep talk they are trying to
885840	890560	imitate the uh the original peter jackson movies though and this whole sequence does feel like that
890560	898000	mandalorian episode now which one the one where um mando and kara dune are basically teaching the
898000	901920	villagers how to fight because they're going to get invaded and they're setting up traps and
901920	906320	they're like learning it's a trope that's used in a lot of movies where the villagers have to defend
906400	910880	home and there's the one warrior that knows what he's doing yep they're like a bit short notice
910880	917920	like they were just right there next to like the orcs that kind of work and they escaped with
917920	923760	enough time to do this best part is this little village is like right below the castle so you
923760	936080	think the orcs would be like looking like hey wait a minute he wants to plant some
937040	942560	oh they finally kissed that actress is really pretty i don't blame him
943200	946960	look at how tiny that village looks but holy smokes it's like three buildings
948320	952720	there's like 40 people that live in them it's like if you're playing an old rpg in the super
952720	957440	nintendo it's like this is a big town and there's like five buildings oh god
960880	965360	i ate a bunch of spicy ramen before we started just to try and keep my sinuses open and now
965360	973120	they're starting to close again definitely a good move like you guys had a full day you could have
973120	977040	just ran and with the sick of the elderly like i'll give them that they probably wouldn't have
977040	982960	gotten far yeah but they can only travel at night their enemies that's true that doesn't give them a
983600	991200	advantage yeah 16 hours versus eight and you open move to an open field and cross the planes
991280	995680	like what are they gonna do is that their battering ram
1000080	1003200	oh jesus rip
1008320	1010080	the hammering sickle always wins
1014720	1016000	well if you had the same idea
1021360	1023360	boom oh did they just like
1027040	1031040	oh it's like oops laugh track
1031840	1034880	hahaha
1048080	1050480	jesus look at that grandma shield maiden going
1051760	1058000	oh yeah if archer here he's tearing that apart listen old lady's still got some spirit
1061680	1062400	just eats him
1069600	1075120	wait when did the elves learn kung fu uh when they need them to
1078480	1082880	get started in the hobbit just got worse
1091280	1097040	jesus that's a bit much
1103200	1107760	gooey's gonna get his mouth let's not kiss this time that's uh
1115280	1118960	it all happened off screen they've actually won yes
1121280	1122880	that's how you save on budget
1131360	1137680	okay i picked the wrong side i mean they're still bad guys like they betrayed them yeah
1139040	1144800	why are all the betrayers black or brown what what is this show trying to say
1145760	1151280	okay here we go gingers are also a minority oh shit
1157920	1161120	knew that victory was too easy yeah it's time to go inside guys
1164480	1165600	oh there goes the girlfriend
1166240	1175200	key to the key to the tavern tavern yes let's all huddle up inside a wooden building that the
1175200	1180960	enemy could just burn down very easily i have a feeling the uh newman orange will show up just
1180960	1189440	in the nick of time very nice of the orcs to just let them do this give them the breathing room
1189840	1207280	um-hmm that blood's coming up fast by the way yeah yeah
1207280	1210400	the wake up mother
1217440	1220720	oh my god so is she just holding her breath i guess
1223200	1227760	i just wanted to see how long i could hold my breath it works up in mighty quiet
1227760	1233280	while they were doing the entire thing no they're it's a turn-based game they're waiting their turn
1233520	1238800	hey we're here so that they came to save this village i guess
1240560	1243840	apparently they knew this specific village is under attack too yeah
1248000	1255440	you can only just stand there and wait for it yeah yeah at this point
1264000	1268000	so
1270720	1274400	so i guess archer's theory that there's a time skip was wrong
1276000	1282480	yep which makes the story a lot dumber let me guess they gave they did that just so the bad
1282480	1287920	guy could get the weapon so i can get away with the weapon to be a problem later oh god
1288720	1296160	you know
1299200	1307520	the action's actually not bad yeah we're actually there yeah it's actually a lot more entertaining
1307520	1310960	than the horror footage i'll give them that i don't think we're seeing them this episode
1311760	1316560	i think the focus he has on the this storyline yeah which i kind of prefer to be honest with you
1317360	1322320	so where an entire squad of elves fell to this guy gladiel's just gonna do it
1324160	1326400	yeah she's she's got girl power
1331200	1338880	oh shit she used the speed buff she popped it you know i will say this for this show
1339520	1342480	they're clearly like going out into the woods and shooting this there
1343440	1346160	it's not just cg nonsense it's like all right good
1347760	1352880	they're putting on the afro problem is it's just only did the same thing for the writing
1352880	1357440	wait how do you get ahead that's an excellent question
1365280	1366880	we still have to find out his lore
1367440	1371280	i need him yeah end his neck
1373920	1375280	straight down it is
1380720	1389280	unsatisfies it by drinking semen
1397040	1403280	preferred pronouns so wait is the implication here is that he's
1404240	1411440	with the what the urakai came from that's what they're trying to say yeah probably
1412240	1417120	you know i don't think that's how that works because the orcs are elves those are the ones
1417120	1423840	that were taken by yeah they're like corrupted elves they were dragged down to the earth that's
1423840	1429600	why they pulled them out of the mud creations of the one master of the secret fire the same as you
1430560	1439360	is worthy of the breath of life and just as worthy of a home oh my god the orcs aren't bad guys now
1445760	1448000	the framing is so reactionary
1448640	1453760	it's clearly they're not worthy of the same like dignity
1456320	1460080	so the story implication is that like some people are just unequal
1462000	1469200	and it's wrong to believe this yeah because like the villain here is saying we're all equal
1469200	1475360	everyone's the same he's a socialist show gonna be like no actually people aren't equal
1476320	1482080	well here's the thing teftash if you're a maggot shud for example then you're not equal
1483840	1487920	oh the orcs the orcs the orcs are trump supporters
1490400	1492880	they deserve to be banned from twitter immediately
1493680	1500800	oh my god so true and the good and the beautiful are people like galadriel who vote with her
1501760	1510640	perhaps they really have no reason to keep them alive no if i could just hold on to that feeling
1512880	1516160	keep it with me don't stop believing
1519680	1526640	what they're gonna bang alpha c kibs what what the heck
1526640	1534480	they really are just adding whatever they want i guess romance of galadriel okay
1535120	1543280	bit strange but all right look that's the power of himbo okay halbrand played by hasan piker
1545120	1550560	you know most of the town is dead half of them joined the enemy and a bunch of them died like
1551440	1556640	party party dev this town is uh gonna be a bit scarred you might say
1557760	1559280	get over really quickly okay
1565120	1572560	actually most of them are dead girl bosses girl bosses look at underneath her armpit
1572560	1576480	she's wearing the t-shirt wait they're not just gonna keep it here are they
1576800	1582800	yeah wouldn't it want to return it to like a more secure place the front line i'll be fine
1588000	1594960	you must not accept the dark side yes that that was what sam that was what sam said to frodo
1594960	1599120	oh is it like literally the same words yeah i i just watched it like a little bit ago
1599680	1604080	was it resist the ring of sword power yeah they're doing the same thing like they're
1604080	1609200	gonna use the sword like the ring the same trope just say precious do it oh wait hold on
1615280	1619360	oh my oh wait you got away with it anyways
1634960	1640400	yeah i'm not sure that the the various sauron artifacts had the same pull as the one ring did
1643280	1646160	yeah they're leaning in on trying to copy it too much
1647600	1655360	uh wait a minute it's just the key to the dam
1660240	1663600	the message of the story is that infrastructure is evil
1664640	1669120	it's cursed dams this is what hydropower does
1671440	1674560	this is what happens if you raise taxes and build a dam guys
1675360	1682480	they want to move away from coal saron's work he's all about green energy
1682640	1690880	so
1691920	1693600	oh it's coming through all the tunnels first
1698000	1704880	it's all part of their plan they dug this thing
1704880	1712880	so wait what where's okay
1717520	1719040	oh they're making obsidian
1723040	1730560	no minecraft reference no yeah no they're trying to get another i have many questions
1735600	1738320	and how they knew how to do this and how that works
1742240	1744480	and so now that wait what the orcs are free now
1747200	1751440	oh jesus okay that doesn't happen in minecraft
1754400	1761200	poor villagers take catch a break wait take shelter they're all on fire take take shelter
1762080	1767040	and all the buildings that are on fire yes and all the buildings that are all made out of straw
1769680	1772480	oh wait is this how it becomes the black lands
1775120	1779920	probably but it feels a bit weird that this is the reason why
1780720	1783840	no you know what they're doing they're making mount doom that's what they did
1786000	1787680	it's the origin story
1791440	1796560	mount doom didn't exist it had like we had to show it being created yep
1802080	1802640	she's dead
1808400	1812320	oh so the other guy escaped how did he escape how does everyone just escape all the time
1812320	1827360	oh my fucking god all right another episode of the greatest television series okay
1829040	1833200	the world's beginning to disagree with that sentiment they're a bunch of
1834080	1834880	liars
1839520	1845040	they're all gonna die from like the the just the ash alone like they're waiting for the volcano
1845040	1849840	okay or just that that is a big enough eruption that it's going to cause like a nuclear winter
1849840	1856080	on the planet the next few years no crops yeah it's gonna be pretty bad so um i'm curious as
1856080	1860720	to how they're gonna roll this off and like the next episode we'll have like some ash land and
1860800	1867200	then they'll be like oh it's all better now okay so i just wanna i just wanna see if we can parse
1867200	1873920	this so somehow the old man who he must be dead that guy like he's fucked he gets a hold of the
1873920	1881920	key and he opens the dam not knowing what it does but he opens the dam and they just they they built
1882880	1890960	not bad yeah he's like oh he's like oh shit what did i do he's like an idiot okay so he opens the
1890960	1897040	dam and the water floods down and but then they built these canals and they just knew to do this
1897040	1902560	i guess they had it all this is all part of their plan this is a big plan to use the water to ignite
1902560	1909920	the magma because that would guaranteeably cause mount doom to explode that seems a bit contrived
1909920	1914320	i'm not gonna lie yeah okay so i i know it's a thing in warhammer for example there's a
1914320	1917840	bunch of tunnels underground that go deep and deep and deep and there's a bunch of things
1917840	1922560	that happen down in the tunnels but i don't think that if you were to dig deep enough
1922560	1929920	you would find a giant hole that's like huge several kilometers just a big cave
1929920	1934320	down to the center of the earth where all the lava hangs out like i don't think that's how that works
1934320	1943920	um you generally you should take geology class dub because i think it's perfectly accurate
1944480	1955280	because uh there's always gonna be a lava a giant lava cape yeah yeah a lava but not necessarily
1955280	1962720	okay and it funnels it up perfectly so it explodes outwards and basically creates a bomb
1963280	1968480	you see the water yeah the water was basically a chain reaction don't ask me how but it basically
1968480	1974880	caused it to boom boom yeah let me okay so that part i could actually see because like i've seen
1975760	1980160	um you know how lava reacts by having water poured on it really quickly or like the inverse
1981600	1986880	it gets violent yeah it erupts so i've seen stuff like that yeah like if you if you because
1987600	1992000	the the heat wants to rise and so it goes through the cold and like pressurizes upwards so
1992000	1997680	i get that i just don't buy there's a giant fucking cave down there well i feel like the
1997680	2003040	more realistic thing to happen would be like the cave collapsing in on itself yeah if it's not like
2004720	2010240	yeah but like i get why they wouldn't show that because it would it wouldn't look good
2010240	2014560	if it was just like a tube it's a lot more impressive to show like a giant cave
2015040	2022000	mm-hmm and also like i think there was lightning in in the eruption like where did the lightning
2022000	2030080	come from from the evil from the feels wrong but i feel like there's gonna be some geology
2030080	2036800	nerd who's like um actually that makes perfect sense yes so this episode went from like kind
2036800	2042560	of ridiculous start with some of the fighting but then like the main bulk of the action was actually
2042560	2048720	like half decent and then it was like what it just spun off into ridiculousness right in the
2048720	2054800	last five minutes where it's just like oh a lot cooler things could have happened rather than like
2054800	2059840	the explosions in the water like what if it unleashed like some like ancient evil beast
2060720	2066240	and that's terrorizing them maybe that would be that would be cool that'd be quite this
2066240	2070720	spectacle and i feel like it would make more sense because you could just like lock it behind doors
2070720	2078720	and then it would like awaken with the ancient magics also i don't like this trend where we have
2078720	2083840	to show where like fucking everything comes from we don't need to know where mount dune comes from
2085200	2090080	oh fuck solo don't remind me it's like we have to have origin stories for everything like this
2090080	2095120	is why it's ashen like dude sometimes maybe the land is just that way because of the positioning
2095120	2101440	well especially with lord of the rings right one of the amazing things that toki did was like he
2101440	2108240	knew when to have mystery in the stories i went to let your imagination fill in the gaps so i
2108240	2114720	hope we don't go down the path of explaining every little thing the note we gotta it's gotta all be
2114720	2120160	rationalistically explained nothing can just be for flair anymore well i think it works for some
2120160	2127520	stories but i think that other times it can just be like a cheap way of sort of drawing connections
2127520	2133920	between yourself and the previous source material in a way that ends up like cheapening outwards
2133920	2138640	the source material i mean like midichlorians is like the perfect old school example of this
2138640	2144960	because there is so much like mysticism and interest and intrigue in the forest and that
2144960	2150640	was kind of stripped away and that sucks because that mysticism was like a very
2151920	2158240	i think it was a core part of what made the force so cool and to kind of remove that sucked
2160000	2165840	yeah yeah i agree and the same thing with mordor here like we're seeing how mordor was formed but
2167440	2172800	i don't i i think it might even make it less interesting to know that oh it turns out that
2172800	2179040	it was foreign because an idiot opened the gate to a dam and then the water rushed in and caused
2179040	2185440	a volcanic eruption that that is a lot less interesting than you know it's it's the land
2185440	2193120	of the dark lord what like what is what does he even have the motivation to do that at the end
2194160	2200720	like you know your bosses are like defeated bro like why are you still working for him
2200720	2207120	i guess in for penny in for buck i guess i mean maybe killed a teenager so but he also seemed
2207120	2212080	stupid like he was kind of not necessarily possessed in the same way as the ring by the
2212080	2216640	sword but he it seems like he had some kind of compulsion maybe because there was that earlier
2216640	2222000	scene where he's talking to the kid and he's like no sauron is kid he's kind of acting like a crack
2222000	2229680	dealer so maybe maybe it's like a yeah he's like schizophrenic for sauron when he talked about
2229680	2237520	orcs he talked about the fact that uh yeah i remember he was lamenting about the sun how he
2237520	2244000	was gonna have to blot it out so this is this is him doing that because yeah oh yeah yeah yeah
2244000	2248640	that was a couple episodes ago but i do remember that i mean that's kind of a cool connection then
2249520	2255040	i kind of want to see like i want to see a prequel to this prequel literally called
2255040	2260960	schizo for sauron and it's like a romance between sauron and like him when he was younger
2262320	2265520	yeah i was just totally in his head
2268560	2271680	jesus oh my god and it's framed like a romantic comedy
2275120	2282560	oh sauron oh you i wonder what arch is going to say about this when he sees it
2283200	2286880	oh he's gonna be he's gonna be fucking enraged i think
2290640	2297440	oh god the the spicy is the spicy noodles have fully worn off i think i i think i need to get
2297440	2304560	to bed before before i like fully descend into madness you i'm sure you've all seen a game of
2304560	2310080	thrones and how there was that usually there's like that one big episode where they they cut
2310080	2314880	all the side stories and they focus on one arc so they did like battle of the black water where
2314880	2322640	it was just that fight or they did the battle at um at the wall where it was just the wildlings
2322640	2327920	attacking castle black and i think they really wanted this to feel like that like they were just
2327920	2333680	doing one thing today and it's going to be this fight and that's it and they were kind of really
2333680	2340400	trying to do it to do that kind of thing but it just felt sort of cheap yeah i'm not exactly sure
2340400	2347280	why i think it's because we just don't have the same one location but well the same connection
2347280	2351760	to the characters yeah that's what it is yeah there's no connection to the characters and i
2351760	2356400	don't care about any of them with the exception of maybe the villain who seems he's kind of
2356400	2362960	interesting even if it breaks lore conventions still with with the urakai but fine he's at least
2362960	2368800	he has at least has a character the urakai urakai are the thing saruman made he's an uruk
2369760	2376160	yeah he's at the precursor right if you they're claiming that he's like the first or part of the
2376160	2382400	first urics that they were that close but which is weird because from my understanding of the lore
2382400	2388480	is that the urics all came out like the orcs we know because they were but they're all that
2388480	2393840	corrupted and warped and twisted they weren't really elven looking anymore well maybe he's
2393840	2407760	a work in progress you know they didn't finish him you know at least there was no harfoots
2408960	2416240	that's true the next episode will be 100 harfoots that's also just as a horror
2416720	2422560	just to make up for it how many how many episodes left so there's eight right so there's two more
2422560	2429200	to go in this season and there's five seasons god help us all this this seems to be like too
2430000	2437120	early an episode for a giant climax like this yeah i agree i think this is like the fake-out
2437120	2440960	episode because there's gonna be like another episode because now now the war is gonna have
2440960	2446400	to escalate because now the orcs have the power of darkness on their side so like the good guys
2446400	2451520	are gonna be on the back foot next episode is what i had to guess yeah these guys because then
2451520	2455120	they're gonna have to retreat and they're going to go back and get like a bigger army and then form
2455120	2460960	the uh recall because this is gonna lead to the last alliance of men and elves which is that big
2460960	2466000	battle at the beginning of fellowship of the ring the elves and men uh basically are fighting you
2466000	2472320	know saron mordor this is all leading up to that point so i don't know where we are on the timeline
2472320	2478400	before that but isildur is here so i don't know yeah maybe that's the plan but isildur is middle
2478400	2484480	aged still has to like have his balls drop a bit more yeah he's gotta he's gotta become more of a
2484480	2489840	leader and he hasn't really gone through a leadership arc well to be fair he does end up
2489840	2496800	like not destroying the ring so maybe he could just be a be not a leader right up to the end
2497360	2500880	i guess that's the thing about an episode like this is there's actually not much to talk about
2500880	2505840	you know it wasn't they weren't jumping around between different scenes and we couldn't like oh
2505840	2512240	well here's what happened with elrond and like it really was just one scene and the battle happened
2512880	2520000	and then the ridiculous eruption happened and it's like okay then so sorry to disappoint everyone
2520000	2526160	but i guess i guess that's the end of the episode i mean don't worry we're just as disappointed as
2526160	2532400	you that's what it is but hey there's always next week there's always hopefully arch will be here
2532400	2539120	that time
