1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,800
Hey guys a few things of note before we start this video one is that I apologize

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:08,240
but I was quite sick yesterday and it kind of comes off in the recording

3
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:13,040
two is that Arsh is sick which is why he didn't show up hey at least I did

4
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:17,680
and three is that there's a whole bunch of outtakes that can be found on the side channel

5
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:21,280
Devonatized and also linked at the end of the video so make sure to check those out

6
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:25,600
enjoy the garbage fest that is Lord of the Rings the rings of power

7
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:31,760
I know you had covid how's that doing Lilith?

8
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,560
I still feel a little bit sick my throat's a little bit out but

9
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:46,080
imagine catching covid at this stage embarrassing this would be like my my like fourth time having it

10
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:52,480
that's brutal you go outside just like a lot I'm kind of jeez I gotta I gotta mute kids here

11
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:59,840
what the fuck is it is playing audio for you guys yes what the fuck how

12
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:07,280
it should even be started I think it's just hold on I'm just gonna yeah yeah

13
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:14,480
Kibs you never understand you never do the audio correctly it always fucks up it's them like this

14
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:21,520
is the menu right it's them look at that little mute symbol right there muted I feel like they

15
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:25,920
autoplay the episode to try to make you an interested like they're that desperate also

16
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:31,920
it's dropped a 3.0 now yeah you know what I think's going on with it man I think like there's

17
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:38,800
some kind of weird player issue where the where the video is like behind the page still playing

18
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:44,720
did you get that in some in bed sites where like maybe that's how they get uh our view count

19
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:54,480
really I mean how else exactly come as a view well one thing I have been noticing is that even

20
00:01:54,480 --> 00:02:01,040
the normies are starting to figure this out those low reviews they just aren't going away

21
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:06,000
you know they're growing a little bit I have a message for you on behalf of one of our mutual

22
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:12,320
subscribers he works as a packaging company he told me that um in his packaging place the

23
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:18,080
amazon stickers and stuff actually arrived a couple months before the launch and most of

24
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:21,840
the warehouse stuff and they were basically just sort of sitting there and then they finally got

25
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:26,880
around to using it so they were already pre-planning the uh putting the stickers on

26
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:33,600
everything yeah and actually speaking of that as well so I have a viewer who's in Montreal

27
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:39,440
and who sent me basically a giant advertisement that's taking over one of the main

28
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:46,240
subway stations in Montreal for this show they just like plastered it on the ground they

29
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:52,080
plastered it on the walls and it's just like please watch so this is like apparently fucking

30
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:57,760
everywhere right now oh my god there's a there's a payphone still in this station Jesus I feel like

31
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:04,640
I'm in the 90s again the advertisements get even wackier because for example if you own a

32
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:10,800
legal copy of photoshop and you were to open it up right now you're gonna get artwork as

33
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:20,000
a splash screen of lord of the rings as your loading page an adobe deal huh too yep so now

34
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:26,960
I haven't seen this because I don't have my copy of photoshop legally but if you happen to have

35
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:34,960
fuck adobe what's going on is adobe has made this big deal with lord of the rings they're

36
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:39,280
just putting a bunch of lord of the rings shit into the app that you paid for because fuck you

37
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:45,280
and in fact people have been complaining about it because this guy's like this is revolting I pay

38
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:50,240
monthly for photoshop and now I'm forced to see an ad for the amazon rings of power series every

39
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:55,680
time I open it this is a disservice to the to the consumer what is the next step having to see a 30

40
00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:00,880
second ad to save a file it's like fair enough you know I don't want this to be the way that apps

41
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:06,640
go in the future it's one thing to run ads cyberpunk future oh god you know it's one thing

42
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:10,240
to run ads on a youtube video it's another thing on an application that you just have on your

43
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:19,280
computer right and it has been slowly coming out that amazon is offering youtubers big stacks of

44
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:24,560
money to just blanket praise the show now I haven't gotten my stack yet

45
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:33,200
suddenly it's a great show yeah so for example this came out with um hello future me

46
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:39,600
he was given an email from amazon to promote rings of power on his channel he asked amazon

47
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:43,280
hey can I review it honestly and not just simply praise you and they ghosted him so they are

48
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:48,320
looking for people who will just say the show is good and will give you a bunch of bezos bucks

49
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:52,640
this story with hello future me that was reported on bounding into comics so that's something that

50
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:58,400
everything knows but I have for you a dev exclusive I'm in contact with a youtuber a

51
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:04,560
friend of mine who is way bigger than all of us way bigger than sargon this friend of mine came

52
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:11,360
to me in private and showed me an email there is a lord of the rings phone game for this show

53
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:18,800
that I haven't heard of at all but as part of the promo deal he was offered to do some kind

54
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:22,400
of promotional tie-in for the phone game as part of the show's advertising project

55
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:30,400
and he was offered for one change of his profile picture on all of his social media

56
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:39,040
and two retweets oh that is a lot of money that's wild yeah apparently everyone who has like

57
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:45,520
millions of subs on youtube they're just getting scattershotted these emails hoping that someone's

58
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:52,000
gonna bite um well they're probably like from an advertising agency that amazon's contracted you

59
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,400
know gave him a budget said just go pay off these guys to do this like that's pretty common you know

60
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:02,640
i've i've received from a dozen different companies all offers to do a promo for raid

61
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:09,440
shadow legends you know it's just big enough yeah i am but i never answer them actually actually

62
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:14,320
a funny thing my editor keeps saying dev can you please look at the promo folder

63
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:19,040
just look at some of these we need some money i'm just like i will not compromise my ideals

64
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:24,960
here's a man of principles are you trying to flex on arch stop that

65
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:30,640
well here's the thing like i'm not against the idea of doing an ad if it's something i was

66
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:34,480
already gonna say it's like say the show is good it's like well if i think it is sure

67
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:38,800
yeah i'm not gonna get bought i'm not gonna be bought though you know it's pretty problematic

68
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:46,400
too for you because people rely on you to like express yourself honestly and if you compromise

69
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:52,880
that then people have less reason to listen to you in the future yep yeah for your irreversibly

70
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:59,920
damaging your uh portfolio yeah you know reputation i would basically only do something if i believed

71
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:04,400
in it so for example i actually do like hello fresh as a product so i wouldn't mind doing a

72
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:09,680
hello fresh ad but like i'm not gonna do something unless i unless i don't already believe in it

73
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:14,240
that's the dev way i guess so wait so in regards to raid shadow legends wouldn't you try it

74
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:20,960
to find out if you like it what if you like it what if you love it oh god don't make me play

75
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:27,360
raid shadow legends listen dev come on i hear from arcs all the time it's not get bad cubes

76
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:32,320
but he always says that on youtube when we're live he always says it when he has a big check

77
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:38,960
dangling in front of him he's like you know this raid shadow is pretty good actually probably does

78
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:44,480
feel good when you get a few thousand bucks doesn't it but all right there's lots of advertising

79
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:49,680
money flying around for this show and absolutely none of it is going to us so let's get it on the

80
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:57,120
road kibs that's let's watch episode six what's it called uh hold on it is called the phantom

81
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:02,400
penis the phantom well it was a good guess but it's called undoon which might mean phantom

82
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:08,080
penis in uh orcish or whatever listen lillith we spent 30 minutes talking about trans stuff before

83
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:17,680
the call started we can't keep going we can't do it udun let's roll now watch this ah crap

84
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:24,720
skip the intro basically nice thank you okay it came pre-skipped amazon really does know what we

85
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:29,600
want it wait hold on it's it was this far along because this is when i stopped it by closing and

86
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:35,840
opening the window again so it was playing in the background holy shit my theory was correct

87
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:41,840
they're all fake views that's what it is if you open the page you get it you give them a view

88
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:48,240
just by opening it even if you don't watch it oh my fucking god i can't believe it yeah

89
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:52,960
i don't know if that's been proven but we just proved it now listen if you're a conspiracy

90
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:57,760
theorist that means that you're a fascist according to some kids so you can't promote

91
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:02,720
these ideas you're gonna get fact checked you get debunked well well it happens sometimes

92
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:11,040
there's dirty fingies those are his cocaine fingernails probably nice nails oh god have you

93
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:16,240
seen that picture of princess leia's actress with the cocaine fingernail in the movies look she

94
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:30,320
likes to play hard i'd like that's why it's liked oh my god the orcs are revolting oh my god wait

95
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:36,960

00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:53,040
the wrong team and the bad guy are we the baddies

108
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:58,400

109
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:03,760
they're brave beautiful stunning immigrants okay they've come here looking for a new life

110
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:12,880
you ever look at those like portland and teeth and look shots it's just these guys oh god it is yeah

113
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:39,600

114
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:45,680
okay wait whoa whoa whoa that seems like a bit okay

115
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:51,120
i don't get this

116
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:58,160
and trap them in there yep wait what happened to the horde of orcs coming up

117
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:00,640
they all went in i guess

118
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:04,240
i guess so

119
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:08,000
oh

120
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:18,800
jesus now how'd they get over there and they have oh i have a problem with that

121
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:22,000
those lights could be seen for miles yep

122
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,480
we have to make ready the village

123
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:34,320
wait the the far less defensible village the castle was yeah i was gonna say that narrow

124
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:38,480
pass they would never be able to breach if they barricaded it not in a reasonable time span

125
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:43,280
that's what i was gonna say they seem a bit close to the army yeah just a pinch

126
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:47,360
all right so we just saw the the anti-helms deep all right

127
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:53,920
god jesus

128
00:12:56,080 --> 00:13:00,320
where's his liver that's a waste at least give it to the horde all right

129
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:05,760
you know i don't like the whole wearing plate armor in the deck of a ship thing

130
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:12,240
like that that's something you put on once you're getting ready to to leave the ship

131
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:18,480
because you're not you can't swim in that shit uh yeah you're right you just sink instantly yeah

132
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:24,800
i just noticed her hair when braided is the same length as her hair when not braided

133
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:29,600
you think she uses extensions in the show i mean from what i understand of women's hair that's not

134
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,720
really that possible i've seen the only braided hair a whole bunch of times it always gets

135
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:37,840
shorter it doesn't get that much shorter though yes it depends on how big your braids are yomi

136
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:43,200
has a lot of hair and it does get noticeably shorter it's like down to her butt at this point

137
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:51,840
oh but the kid's gonna know he's gonna follow him

138
00:13:54,080 --> 00:14:02,720
i think that's good protection okay just that'll stop him

139
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:10,640
all who cannot fight will be barricaded inside this is to be our peace our fallback point

140
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:17,520
okay take off all of you the wooden thatch building that's flammable is

141
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:21,200
the final step i don't know i don't know about this one

142
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:35,920
isn't this a quote from the main movies uh kind of sounds like it in fact it's trying to imitate

143
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:40,480
it i'm pretty sure but i don't think they've ever said that movies there was even something similar

144
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:45,840
in the previous episode when elrond was was getting his own pep talk they are trying to

145
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:50,560
imitate the uh the original peter jackson movies though and this whole sequence does feel like that

146
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:58,000
mandalorian episode now which one the one where um mando and kara dune are basically teaching the

147
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,920
villagers how to fight because they're going to get invaded and they're setting up traps and

148
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:06,320
they're like learning it's a trope that's used in a lot of movies where the villagers have to defend

149
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:10,880
home and there's the one warrior that knows what he's doing yep they're like a bit short notice

150
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:17,920
like they were just right there next to like the orcs that kind of work and they escaped with

151
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:23,760
enough time to do this best part is this little village is like right below the castle so you

152
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:36,080
think the orcs would be like looking like hey wait a minute he wants to plant some

153
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:42,560
oh they finally kissed that actress is really pretty i don't blame him

154
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:46,960
look at how tiny that village looks but holy smokes it's like three buildings

155
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:52,720
there's like 40 people that live in them it's like if you're playing an old rpg in the super

156
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:57,440
nintendo it's like this is a big town and there's like five buildings oh god

157
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:05,360
i ate a bunch of spicy ramen before we started just to try and keep my sinuses open and now

158
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:13,120
they're starting to close again definitely a good move like you guys had a full day you could have

159
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:17,040
just ran and with the sick of the elderly like i'll give them that they probably wouldn't have

160
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:22,960
gotten far yeah but they can only travel at night their enemies that's true that doesn't give them a

161
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:31,200
advantage yeah 16 hours versus eight and you open move to an open field and cross the planes

162
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:35,680
like what are they gonna do is that their battering ram

163
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:43,200
oh jesus rip

164
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:50,080
the hammering sickle always wins

165
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,000
well if you had the same idea

166
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:03,360
boom oh did they just like

167
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:11,040
oh it's like oops laugh track

168
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:14,880
hahaha

169
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:30,480
jesus look at that grandma shield maiden going

170
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:38,000
oh yeah if archer here he's tearing that apart listen old lady's still got some spirit

171
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:42,400
just eats him

172
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:55,120
wait when did the elves learn kung fu uh when they need them to

173
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:02,880
get started in the hobbit just got worse

174
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:17,040
jesus that's a bit much

175
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:27,760
gooey's gonna get his mouth let's not kiss this time that's uh

176
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:38,960
it all happened off screen they've actually won yes

177
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:42,880
that's how you save on budget

178
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:57,680
okay i picked the wrong side i mean they're still bad guys like they betrayed them yeah

179
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:04,800
why are all the betrayers black or brown what what is this show trying to say

180
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:11,280
okay here we go gingers are also a minority oh shit

181
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:21,120
knew that victory was too easy yeah it's time to go inside guys

182
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:25,600
oh there goes the girlfriend

183
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:35,200
key to the key to the tavern tavern yes let's all huddle up inside a wooden building that the

184
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:40,960
enemy could just burn down very easily i have a feeling the uh newman orange will show up just

185
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:49,440
in the nick of time very nice of the orcs to just let them do this give them the breathing room

186
00:19:49,840 --> 00:20:07,280
um-hmm that blood's coming up fast by the way yeah yeah

187
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:10,400
the wake up mother

188
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:20,720
oh my god so is she just holding her breath i guess

189
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:27,760
i just wanted to see how long i could hold my breath it works up in mighty quiet

190
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:33,280
while they were doing the entire thing no they're it's a turn-based game they're waiting their turn

191
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:38,800
hey we're here so that they came to save this village i guess

192
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:43,840
apparently they knew this specific village is under attack too yeah

193
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:55,440
you can only just stand there and wait for it yeah yeah at this point

194
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:08,000
so

195
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:14,400
so i guess archer's theory that there's a time skip was wrong

196
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:22,480
yep which makes the story a lot dumber let me guess they gave they did that just so the bad

197
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:27,920
guy could get the weapon so i can get away with the weapon to be a problem later oh god

198
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:36,160
you know

199
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:47,520
the action's actually not bad yeah we're actually there yeah it's actually a lot more entertaining

200
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:50,960
than the horror footage i'll give them that i don't think we're seeing them this episode

201
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:56,560
i think the focus he has on the this storyline yeah which i kind of prefer to be honest with you

202
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:02,320
so where an entire squad of elves fell to this guy gladiel's just gonna do it

203
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:06,400
yeah she's she's got girl power

204
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:18,880
oh shit she used the speed buff she popped it you know i will say this for this show

205
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:22,480
they're clearly like going out into the woods and shooting this there

206
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:26,160
it's not just cg nonsense it's like all right good

207
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:32,880
they're putting on the afro problem is it's just only did the same thing for the writing

208
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:37,440
wait how do you get ahead that's an excellent question

209
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:46,880
we still have to find out his lore

210
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:51,280
i need him yeah end his neck

211
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:55,280
straight down it is

212
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:09,280
unsatisfies it by drinking semen

213
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:23,280
preferred pronouns so wait is the implication here is that he's

214
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:31,440
with the what the urakai came from that's what they're trying to say yeah probably

215
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:37,120
you know i don't think that's how that works because the orcs are elves those are the ones

216
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:43,840
that were taken by yeah they're like corrupted elves they were dragged down to the earth that's

217
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:49,600
why they pulled them out of the mud creations of the one master of the secret fire the same as you

218
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:59,360
is worthy of the breath of life and just as worthy of a home oh my god the orcs aren't bad guys now

219
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:08,000
the framing is so reactionary

220
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:13,760
it's clearly they're not worthy of the same like dignity

221
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:20,080
so the story implication is that like some people are just unequal

222
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:29,200
and it's wrong to believe this yeah because like the villain here is saying we're all equal

223
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:35,360
everyone's the same he's a socialist show gonna be like no actually people aren't equal

224
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:42,080
well here's the thing teftash if you're a maggot shud for example then you're not equal

225
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:47,920
oh the orcs the orcs the orcs are trump supporters

226
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,880
they deserve to be banned from twitter immediately

227
00:24:53,680 --> 00:25:00,800
oh my god so true and the good and the beautiful are people like galadriel who vote with her

228
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:10,640
perhaps they really have no reason to keep them alive no if i could just hold on to that feeling

229
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:16,160
keep it with me don't stop believing

230
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:26,640
what they're gonna bang alpha c kibs what what the heck

231
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:34,480
they really are just adding whatever they want i guess romance of galadriel okay

232
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:43,280
bit strange but all right look that's the power of himbo okay halbrand played by hasan piker

233
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:50,560
you know most of the town is dead half of them joined the enemy and a bunch of them died like

234
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:56,640
party party dev this town is uh gonna be a bit scarred you might say

235
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:59,280
get over really quickly okay

236
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:12,560
actually most of them are dead girl bosses girl bosses look at underneath her armpit

237
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:16,480
she's wearing the t-shirt wait they're not just gonna keep it here are they

238
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:22,800
yeah wouldn't it want to return it to like a more secure place the front line i'll be fine

239
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:34,960
you must not accept the dark side yes that that was what sam that was what sam said to frodo

240
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:39,120
oh is it like literally the same words yeah i i just watched it like a little bit ago

241
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:44,080
was it resist the ring of sword power yeah they're doing the same thing like they're

242
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:49,200
gonna use the sword like the ring the same trope just say precious do it oh wait hold on

243
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:59,360
oh my oh wait you got away with it anyways

244
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:20,400
yeah i'm not sure that the the various sauron artifacts had the same pull as the one ring did

245
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:26,160
yeah they're leaning in on trying to copy it too much

246
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:35,360
uh wait a minute it's just the key to the dam

247
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:43,600
the message of the story is that infrastructure is evil

248
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:49,120
it's cursed dams this is what hydropower does

249
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:54,560
this is what happens if you raise taxes and build a dam guys

250
00:27:55,360 --> 00:28:02,480
they want to move away from coal saron's work he's all about green energy

251
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:10,880
so

252
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:13,600
oh it's coming through all the tunnels first

253
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:24,880
it's all part of their plan they dug this thing

254
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:32,880
so wait what where's okay

255
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:39,040
oh they're making obsidian

256
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:50,560
no minecraft reference no yeah no they're trying to get another i have many questions

257
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:58,320
and how they knew how to do this and how that works

258
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:04,480
and so now that wait what the orcs are free now

259
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:11,440
oh jesus okay that doesn't happen in minecraft

260
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:21,200
poor villagers take catch a break wait take shelter they're all on fire take take shelter

261
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:27,040
and all the buildings that are on fire yes and all the buildings that are all made out of straw

262
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:32,480
oh wait is this how it becomes the black lands

263
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:39,920
probably but it feels a bit weird that this is the reason why

264
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:43,840
no you know what they're doing they're making mount doom that's what they did

265
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,680
it's the origin story

266
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:56,560
mount doom didn't exist it had like we had to show it being created yep

267
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:02,640
she's dead

268
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:12,320
oh so the other guy escaped how did he escape how does everyone just escape all the time

269
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:27,360
oh my fucking god all right another episode of the greatest television series okay

270
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:33,200
the world's beginning to disagree with that sentiment they're a bunch of

271
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:34,880
liars

272
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:45,040
they're all gonna die from like the the just the ash alone like they're waiting for the volcano

273
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:49,840
okay or just that that is a big enough eruption that it's going to cause like a nuclear winter

274
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:56,080
on the planet the next few years no crops yeah it's gonna be pretty bad so um i'm curious as

275
00:30:56,080 --> 00:31:00,720
to how they're gonna roll this off and like the next episode we'll have like some ash land and

276
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:07,200
then they'll be like oh it's all better now okay so i just wanna i just wanna see if we can parse

277
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:13,920
this so somehow the old man who he must be dead that guy like he's fucked he gets a hold of the

278
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:21,920
key and he opens the dam not knowing what it does but he opens the dam and they just they they built

279
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:30,960
not bad yeah he's like oh he's like oh shit what did i do he's like an idiot okay so he opens the

280
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:37,040
dam and the water floods down and but then they built these canals and they just knew to do this

281
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:42,560
i guess they had it all this is all part of their plan this is a big plan to use the water to ignite

282
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:49,920
the magma because that would guaranteeably cause mount doom to explode that seems a bit contrived

283
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:54,320
i'm not gonna lie yeah okay so i i know it's a thing in warhammer for example there's a

284
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:57,840
bunch of tunnels underground that go deep and deep and deep and there's a bunch of things

285
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:02,560
that happen down in the tunnels but i don't think that if you were to dig deep enough

286
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:09,920
you would find a giant hole that's like huge several kilometers just a big cave

287
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:14,320
down to the center of the earth where all the lava hangs out like i don't think that's how that works

288
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:23,920
um you generally you should take geology class dub because i think it's perfectly accurate

289
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:35,280
because uh there's always gonna be a lava a giant lava cape yeah yeah a lava but not necessarily

290
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:42,720
okay and it funnels it up perfectly so it explodes outwards and basically creates a bomb

291
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:48,480
you see the water yeah the water was basically a chain reaction don't ask me how but it basically

292
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:54,880
caused it to boom boom yeah let me okay so that part i could actually see because like i've seen

293
00:32:55,760 --> 00:33:00,160
um you know how lava reacts by having water poured on it really quickly or like the inverse

294
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:06,880
it gets violent yeah it erupts so i've seen stuff like that yeah like if you if you because

295
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:12,000
the the heat wants to rise and so it goes through the cold and like pressurizes upwards so

296
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:17,680
i get that i just don't buy there's a giant fucking cave down there well i feel like the

297
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:23,040
more realistic thing to happen would be like the cave collapsing in on itself yeah if it's not like

298
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:30,240
yeah but like i get why they wouldn't show that because it would it wouldn't look good

299
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:34,560
if it was just like a tube it's a lot more impressive to show like a giant cave

300
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:42,000
mm-hmm and also like i think there was lightning in in the eruption like where did the lightning

301
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:50,080
come from from the evil from the feels wrong but i feel like there's gonna be some geology

302
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:56,800
nerd who's like um actually that makes perfect sense yes so this episode went from like kind

303
00:33:56,800 --> 00:34:02,560
of ridiculous start with some of the fighting but then like the main bulk of the action was actually

304
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:08,720
like half decent and then it was like what it just spun off into ridiculousness right in the

305
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:14,800
last five minutes where it's just like oh a lot cooler things could have happened rather than like

306
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:19,840
the explosions in the water like what if it unleashed like some like ancient evil beast

307
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:26,240
and that's terrorizing them maybe that would be that would be cool that'd be quite this

308
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:30,720
spectacle and i feel like it would make more sense because you could just like lock it behind doors

309
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:38,720
and then it would like awaken with the ancient magics also i don't like this trend where we have

310
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:43,840
to show where like fucking everything comes from we don't need to know where mount dune comes from

311
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:50,080
oh fuck solo don't remind me it's like we have to have origin stories for everything like this

312
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:55,120
is why it's ashen like dude sometimes maybe the land is just that way because of the positioning

313
00:34:55,120 --> 00:35:01,440
well especially with lord of the rings right one of the amazing things that toki did was like he

314
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:08,240
knew when to have mystery in the stories i went to let your imagination fill in the gaps so i

315
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:14,720
hope we don't go down the path of explaining every little thing the note we gotta it's gotta all be

316
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:20,160
rationalistically explained nothing can just be for flair anymore well i think it works for some

317
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:27,520
stories but i think that other times it can just be like a cheap way of sort of drawing connections

318
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:33,920
between yourself and the previous source material in a way that ends up like cheapening outwards

319
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:38,640
the source material i mean like midichlorians is like the perfect old school example of this

320
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:44,960
because there is so much like mysticism and interest and intrigue in the forest and that

321
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:50,640
was kind of stripped away and that sucks because that mysticism was like a very

322
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:58,240
i think it was a core part of what made the force so cool and to kind of remove that sucked

323
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:05,840
yeah yeah i agree and the same thing with mordor here like we're seeing how mordor was formed but

324
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:12,800
i don't i i think it might even make it less interesting to know that oh it turns out that

325
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:19,040
it was foreign because an idiot opened the gate to a dam and then the water rushed in and caused

326
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:25,440
a volcanic eruption that that is a lot less interesting than you know it's it's the land

327
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:33,120
of the dark lord what like what is what does he even have the motivation to do that at the end

328
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:40,720
like you know your bosses are like defeated bro like why are you still working for him

329
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:47,120
i guess in for penny in for buck i guess i mean maybe killed a teenager so but he also seemed

330
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:52,080
stupid like he was kind of not necessarily possessed in the same way as the ring by the

331
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:56,640
sword but he it seems like he had some kind of compulsion maybe because there was that earlier

332
00:36:56,640 --> 00:37:02,000
scene where he's talking to the kid and he's like no sauron is kid he's kind of acting like a crack

333
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:09,680
dealer so maybe maybe it's like a yeah he's like schizophrenic for sauron when he talked about

334
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:17,520
orcs he talked about the fact that uh yeah i remember he was lamenting about the sun how he

335
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:24,000
was gonna have to blot it out so this is this is him doing that because yeah oh yeah yeah yeah

336
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:28,640
that was a couple episodes ago but i do remember that i mean that's kind of a cool connection then

337
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:35,040
i kind of want to see like i want to see a prequel to this prequel literally called

338
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:40,960
schizo for sauron and it's like a romance between sauron and like him when he was younger

339
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:45,520
yeah i was just totally in his head

340
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:51,680
jesus oh my god and it's framed like a romantic comedy

341
00:37:55,120 --> 00:38:02,560
oh sauron oh you i wonder what arch is going to say about this when he sees it

342
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:06,880
oh he's gonna be he's gonna be fucking enraged i think

343
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:17,440
oh god the the spicy is the spicy noodles have fully worn off i think i i think i need to get

344
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:24,560
to bed before before i like fully descend into madness you i'm sure you've all seen a game of

345
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:30,080
thrones and how there was that usually there's like that one big episode where they they cut

346
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:34,880
all the side stories and they focus on one arc so they did like battle of the black water where

347
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:42,640
it was just that fight or they did the battle at um at the wall where it was just the wildlings

348
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:47,920
attacking castle black and i think they really wanted this to feel like that like they were just

349
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:53,680
doing one thing today and it's going to be this fight and that's it and they were kind of really

350
00:38:53,680 --> 00:39:00,400
trying to do it to do that kind of thing but it just felt sort of cheap yeah i'm not exactly sure

351
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:07,280
why i think it's because we just don't have the same one location but well the same connection

352
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:11,760
to the characters yeah that's what it is yeah there's no connection to the characters and i

353
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:16,400
don't care about any of them with the exception of maybe the villain who seems he's kind of

354
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:22,960
interesting even if it breaks lore conventions still with with the urakai but fine he's at least

355
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:28,800
he has at least has a character the urakai urakai are the thing saruman made he's an uruk

356
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:36,160
yeah he's at the precursor right if you they're claiming that he's like the first or part of the

357
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:42,400
first urics that they were that close but which is weird because from my understanding of the lore

358
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:48,480
is that the urics all came out like the orcs we know because they were but they're all that

359
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:53,840
corrupted and warped and twisted they weren't really elven looking anymore well maybe he's

360
00:39:53,840 --> 00:40:07,760
a work in progress you know they didn't finish him you know at least there was no harfoots

361
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:16,240
that's true the next episode will be 100 harfoots that's also just as a horror

362
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:22,560
just to make up for it how many how many episodes left so there's eight right so there's two more

363
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:29,200
to go in this season and there's five seasons god help us all this this seems to be like too

364
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:37,120
early an episode for a giant climax like this yeah i agree i think this is like the fake-out

365
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:40,960
episode because there's gonna be like another episode because now now the war is gonna have

366
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:46,400
to escalate because now the orcs have the power of darkness on their side so like the good guys

367
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:51,520
are gonna be on the back foot next episode is what i had to guess yeah these guys because then

368
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:55,120
they're gonna have to retreat and they're going to go back and get like a bigger army and then form

369
00:40:55,120 --> 00:41:00,960
the uh recall because this is gonna lead to the last alliance of men and elves which is that big

370
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:06,000
battle at the beginning of fellowship of the ring the elves and men uh basically are fighting you

371
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:12,320
know saron mordor this is all leading up to that point so i don't know where we are on the timeline

372
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:18,400
before that but isildur is here so i don't know yeah maybe that's the plan but isildur is middle

373
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:24,480
aged still has to like have his balls drop a bit more yeah he's gotta he's gotta become more of a

374
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:29,840
leader and he hasn't really gone through a leadership arc well to be fair he does end up

375
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:36,800
like not destroying the ring so maybe he could just be a be not a leader right up to the end

376
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:40,880
i guess that's the thing about an episode like this is there's actually not much to talk about

377
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:45,840
you know it wasn't they weren't jumping around between different scenes and we couldn't like oh

378
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:52,240
well here's what happened with elrond and like it really was just one scene and the battle happened

379
00:41:52,880 --> 00:42:00,000
and then the ridiculous eruption happened and it's like okay then so sorry to disappoint everyone

380
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:06,160
but i guess i guess that's the end of the episode i mean don't worry we're just as disappointed as

381
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:12,400
you that's what it is but hey there's always next week there's always hopefully arch will be here

382
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:19,120
that time
