Hey guys, it's Dev, and we've gotta have a talk.

00:02.640 --> 00:07.160
The channel's going on hiatus again, but it's not going to be like previous hiatuses.

00:07.160 --> 00:11.340
Most of you probably know this, we have an editor working with us on the videos who calls

00:11.340 --> 00:12.340
herself camera lady.

00:12.340 --> 00:15.680
Well a week ago or so, she took off to Newfoundland.

00:15.680 --> 00:19.000
She's handling some family stuff over there and I don't know when she'll be back.

00:19.000 --> 00:22.960
Not that it matters to you guys too much because you don't actually see her, but it does affect

00:22.960 --> 00:23.960
the videos.

00:23.960 --> 00:28.920
During previous hiatuses, like back in December or March, we just took a week off from uploading

00:28.920 --> 00:29.920
anything.

00:29.920 --> 00:31.160
This one's going to be different.

00:31.160 --> 00:36.200
Cam edited several videos in advance, and I'm posting them, but there are some she didn't

00:36.200 --> 00:37.200
get to.

00:37.200 --> 00:43.680
Sonic, Barkley, SoulSilver, and Banjo seem to be in order for the time being, while Link

00:43.680 --> 00:45.800
to the Past and the anime stuff isn't.

00:45.800 --> 00:50.360
So this hiatus is more of an editing freeze than an uploading freeze.

00:50.360 --> 00:54.960
I know how to edit a little bit, but I'm not nearly as good as her at it.

00:54.960 --> 00:59.240
I'll try to keep us up to date, but until she gets back we simply might miss some upload

00:59.240 --> 01:00.240
days.

01:00.240 --> 01:01.240
It's not all bad though.

01:01.240 --> 01:05.240
We're making arrangements to be able to put out even more content in the near future,

01:05.240 --> 01:09.560
including reviving the idea of having multiple anime videos per month.

01:09.560 --> 01:10.360
Cross your fingers.
