0	2640	Hey guys, it's Dev, and we've gotta have a talk.
2640	7160	The channel's going on hiatus again, but it's not going to be like previous hiatuses.
7160	11340	Most of you probably know this, we have an editor working with us on the videos who calls
11340	12340	herself camera lady.
12340	15680	Well a week ago or so, she took off to Newfoundland.
15680	19000	She's handling some family stuff over there and I don't know when she'll be back.
19000	22960	Not that it matters to you guys too much because you don't actually see her, but it does affect
22960	23960	the videos.
23960	28920	During previous hiatuses, like back in December or March, we just took a week off from uploading
28920	29920	anything.
29920	31160	This one's going to be different.
31160	36200	Cam edited several videos in advance, and I'm posting them, but there are some she didn't
36200	37200	get to.
37200	43680	Sonic, Barkley, SoulSilver, and Banjo seem to be in order for the time being, while Link
43680	45800	to the Past and the anime stuff isn't.
45800	50360	So this hiatus is more of an editing freeze than an uploading freeze.
50360	54960	I know how to edit a little bit, but I'm not nearly as good as her at it.
54960	59240	I'll try to keep us up to date, but until she gets back we simply might miss some upload
59240	60240	days.
60240	61240	It's not all bad though.
61240	65240	We're making arrangements to be able to put out even more content in the near future,
65240	69560	including reviving the idea of having multiple anime videos per month.
69560	70360	Cross your fingers.
