0	12000	It's the early morning guys. Can you hear all those birds? Are these our cucumbers?
12000	18000	These are our cucumbers. Are these our limp cucumbers? I told you they would be limp. Oh my god, that's a huge mess.
18000	25000	Yeah, one of them sold a little. Oops. Only one. Only one! No, no, I know, I know. The thing with these, they're not bad.
26000	33000	You just need a little TLC. We finally got cucumbers guys. How bad is the mess?
33000	35000	It's pretty bad.
35000	41000	So last night there was frost, however this time we were prepared, unlike last year, we bought a tarp.
41000	44000	Oh, it's going to blow away.
44000	51000	Okay, so the garden survived the frost. We have our cucumbers and they'll be going in today.
51000	57000	This is a big tarp though. It's like 13 feet by 13 feet. I've got to roll it up or something.
57000	67000	And we're basically folding it and rolling it the way that I learned in scouts. The one thing I remember is how to fold and roll a flag and it works for literally everything else.
67000	71000	It's actually a pretty decent tarp too. It wasn't even that expensive.
71000	78000	Great for Walmart sometimes I suppose. Wasn't it? Wasn't it? Can they entire? Oh my god, no, Walmart!
79000	88000	Anyway, we'll stuff it in the shed somewhere. Maybe up at the top. Don't step on the plants Dev. I won't. I don't believe you.
88000	96000	We had moved the lettuce here just to get it underneath the tarp for the night, but it can come back out now.
96000	103000	I get to stick my hands and manure straight on once more this year. How does that make you feel Naomi?
103000	105000	You're going to give me cholera.
105000	107000	Dig down.
107000	109000	And a big ol' handful.
109000	111000	Ooh, it's kind of congealed in here.
111000	113000	You've got to mix it up again.
113000	114000	Gross.
114000	122000	Since you're willing to touch manure with your bare skin, how much would people have to pay you to eat it?
122000	124000	Probably a fair bit.
124000	126000	How much? Give us a number Dev.
126000	127000	I don't know.
127000	128000	Give us a number.
128000	129000	A fair bit.
129000	130000	Number.
130000	131000	You're a numb skull.
131000	133000	Yes, that doesn't change the question.
133000	137000	With the cucumbers in, Naomi's giving it the ol' garden.
137000	139000	The ol' garden? Is that what I'm doing?
139000	141000	The ol' watering is what I mean.
141000	142000	Is that what I'm doing Dev?
142000	144000	Let's see how it all turns out.
144000	148000	I think the laundry is going to hit you soon. It's flapping right above you.
148000	150000	It's too short for it to hit you.
150000	152000	Oh, it's caught in the tree.
152000	154000	Is that how we always get bugs in our laundry?
154000	155000	Yes.
156000	158000	Oh my God, guys.
158000	164000	It's very dark out here and it's way too early for it to be this dark.
164000	176000	And the reason is, out of nowhere a huge storm is blowing in right now.
176000	178000	And there's going to be hail tonight.
178000	182000	So that tarp's got to go back on this garden.
182000	184000	Oh God, the rain's starting.
186000	187000	I can't reach it.
187000	188000	It's up here, right?
188000	189000	Why did I put it up here?
189000	191000	Because you're dumb.
191000	193000	Nope, we got it. Okay.
193000	195000	Oh God, the rain.
198000	200000	Oh my God, guys.
202000	205000	I don't know if you can hear me. This is what it looks like.
205000	210000	We've pulled the tarp as tight as possible.
210000	211000	Oh God, we're soaked.
211000	216000	You pull the tarp as tight as possible and use bricks to hold it up.
216000	219000	And we hope that's going to stay.
219000	222000	And hopefully nothing gets crushed by pooling water.
227000	228000	Oh God.
229000	232000	And here it is from the upstairs view.
232000	236000	Oh God, I hope the plants don't get fucked.
237000	238000	Oh.
242000	247000	I have a feeling that water's going to weigh it down too much and those bricks are going to come down.
247000	249000	All we can do is hope for the...
249000	251000	I don't even mind rain this hard.
251000	253000	It's the fact that it might be hailing that's the problem.
253000	255000	Oh, there they go.
256000	258000	There they go.
267000	273000	It is 7 am. We're out in the garden after last night's adventure.
273000	277000	The tarp is drying off on the clothesline.
277000	283000	Though, to be honest, the clothesline's not big enough because it basically touches the ground.
283000	288000	I'm going to inspect the plants to see what happened.
288000	291000	There was thankfully no actual hail, but there could have been.
291000	293000	A lot of these guys look okay.
293000	296000	A lot of these peas, they look just fine.
296000	298000	The tomatoes look okay too.
298000	300000	This one looks flattened.
300000	302000	Did you break it all?
302000	304000	No, it doesn't seem like it.
304000	306000	Spinach looks fine.
306000	309000	The kale's barely moved, but kale takes a long time to grow anyway.
309000	312000	This pepper plant looks pretty mashed up.
312000	314000	That leaf broke.
314000	315000	That's done.
315000	318000	The main stem is still intact, so maybe it'll be okay.
318000	320000	This one back here lost a leaf.
320000	322000	This one back here lost a leaf.
322000	325000	And this one there broke a leaf at the bottom.
325000	328000	I mean, all the stalks are still going though.
328000	330000	And then here's our poor cucumbers.
330000	332000	They stopped being so limp.
332000	334000	I don't know if the storm crushed them or what.
334000	336000	I mean, they're withering.
336000	338000	I hope we didn't lose anything.
338000	341000	I wouldn't want to have to restart the garden, you know?
341000	344000	So this is about a week after the storm.
344000	346000	And there's good news and bad news.
346000	348000	Good news, look at all that lettuce.
348000	351000	I'm going to trim it and start eating it because it's pretty much time.
351000	353000	Same with the spinach. Look at the spinach, guys.
353000	355000	It's really going.
355000	356000	That's the good news.
356000	358000	The kale takes a while to grow.
358000	359000	And same with the peppers and stuff.
359000	360000	But here's the bad news.
360000	364000	The bad news is all of those kind of wilty looking cucumbers all died.
364000	367000	I don't know if it was just the fact that they're wilty.
367000	371000	Or if it was the fact that the storm killed them.
371000	374000	To be fair, no offense to you, Naomi.
374000	377000	It's just that your store is kind of shitty and I didn't expect them to actually work out.
377000	380000	We've got to go buy new cucumbers because these ones, like, they died.
380000	383000	It's kind of funny because a few of them, like, you can see how limp they are.
383000	385000	They're just like in the dirt.
385000	387000	A couple of them came back and then died again.
387000	390000	So we're going to go try to find some more robust cucumbers today.
390000	393000	A few fresh weeds growing. Geez, these things really took off.
393000	396000	Yeah, man, you've got to weed the garden regularly.
396000	397000	I'll leave that to you.
397000	398000	Yeah?
398000	400000	The peas themselves look okay.
400000	403000	We've just got to start pushing them towards the lattice, you know?
404000	407000	I think there was one pea that was kind of floppy, but I think it's...
407000	409000	Is it this one here?
409000	411000	Is this the floppy pea?
411000	413000	Yes.
413000	415000	No, this one here...
415000	417000	Wait, that's just a leaf.
417000	419000	These aren't necessarily... They're kind of floppy.
419000	421000	I think they're actually okay.
421000	424000	I think we've just got to, like, pull these towards...
424000	427000	I think if I can just... Come on.
427000	429000	Come on, just... This way!
429000	431000	They'll figure it out. They'll figure it out.
431000	433000	I think they will. I think they might need human intervention.
433000	435000	Okay, but, like, there's only so much...
435000	438000	Like, I can't just yank them. They're still kind of tiny.
438000	441000	It's been kind of cold and kind of wet after that storm came through, so...
441000	444000	Well, it's the slowest art warming up again.
444000	447000	Yeah, but, hey, all the leaves are going good, so we've got to start having salads soon.
447000	449000	Yum, yum.
449000	451000	I mean, more salad than we've already been having.
451000	452000	Yeah.
452000	455000	Geez, this is a huge selection.
455000	457000	I don't see any cucumbers, though, do you?
457000	458000	No.
458000	460000	Ow, I just bonked my head in something.
460000	462000	These are actually in pretty decent shape.
462000	463000	I mean, like, this one's not.
463000	464000	And this one's not.
464000	465000	And this one's not.
465000	467000	Like, look at that.
467000	468000	But...
468000	469000	Let me... Ouch.
469000	470000	I bonked my head again.
470000	471000	Is it a cucumber?
471000	472000	Yes.
472000	473000	Cucumber.
473000	475000	And it's actually in pretty decent shape, yeah.
475000	478000	Hey, Naomi, how mad would you be if I sprayed you with that thing?
478000	480000	Well, pretty mad.
480000	482000	Is that the case?
482000	483000	Yeah, it is, yeah.
483000	486000	I'm actually surprised that we got such good ones right away.
486000	488000	I thought we had to shop around.
488000	489000	Geez.
489000	490000	Here they are.
490000	491000	Alright.
491000	492000	I'm gonna put them in.
492000	494000	Should I put the seatbelt on them?
494000	496000	Do you want to tuck them in?
496000	499000	Taking a break from salad stuff for sushi.
499000	501000	Guys, Naomi likes getting hand rolls.
501000	502000	What a pleb.
502000	505000	Alright, we're back at the ol' homestead.
505000	506000	Pull.
506000	508000	This thing's just dead.
508000	510000	Pull it out.
510000	513000	Whatever remains will go into the compost.
513000	516000	And then we do the whole diggy again.
516000	518000	Let's hope these new ones work out.
518000	520000	Oh, the manure has dried up quite a bit.
520000	521000	Big handful.
521000	523000	In it goes.
523000	527000	And now, how do we get it out?
527000	528000	I was going to do it one-handed.
528000	530000	I just wanted to put the camera down.
530000	536000	And just, oh, look at that.
536000	540000	And now, put it through the mesh.
540000	545000	I don't want anything to get caught accidentally.
545000	548000	And there it goes.
548000	550000	Our new cucumbers.
550000	556000	Let's hope these ones do not die like the last ones did.
556000	558000	Hey, check this out.
558000	560000	I began digging the next hole.
560000	562000	And this little guy, he just popped out.
562000	564000	He's a little wormy.
564000	565000	He's moving.
565000	567000	Do you see him?
567000	568000	Hey, buddy.
568000	570000	Oh, he's going back in.
570000	571000	There we go.
572000	575000	All four are in.
575000	577000	Unless the garden's doing OK.
577000	581000	There's Naomi honking her way up the driveway.
581000	584000	Hey, Naomi.
584000	586000	Do you know if it's going to rain today?
586000	587000	So is it raining?
587000	588000	No.
588000	589000	No?
589000	590000	Not raining.
590000	591000	OK, I guess I have to water the garden then.
591000	592000	Also, I got a really poopy hand.
592000	593000	You want some?
593000	595000	Fuck off.
595000	596000	Here we are.
596000	598000	Back side of the house.
598000	601000	Get some water.
601000	604000	I don't even know if you can hear me, but.
604000	608000	So hopefully, you don't have to replace any more plants.
608000	610000	That'd be nice.
610000	612000	I'm not fond of having to do it.
612000	616000	But that is just a necessity sometimes.
616000	620000	Now, it's a couple of days later and check it out.
620000	627000	These cucumber sprouts are doing OK.
628000	634000	It looks like this, this pea broke in the wind or something.
634000	636000	Well, that sucks.
636000	639000	But the peas seem to be going all right.
639000	640000	It's going for the tomato thing.
640000	641000	No.
641000	643000	Stop going for the tomato thing.
643000	644000	It's literally right here.
644000	647000	Look at this spinach, guys.
647000	653000	I should be able to literally just pick off all the leaves.
653000	655000	Like so.
655000	658000	Look at all the decent leaves.
658000	663000	And the plant will regrow with new leaves.
663000	666000	But the real prize is this lettuce and it's got to be cut now.
666000	668000	I can't even fit it in the frame.
668000	671000	OK, so if I just.
671000	673000	Ow.
673000	677000	Take the scissors and just like a cut.
680000	683000	I can just cut all the leaves.
683000	684000	Lettuce with gravel in it.
684000	685000	No problem.
685000	692000	Just give a few inches of the plant left.
697000	700000	Give a few inches of the plant left.
700000	705000	And it should be OK to keep growing back.
705000	707000	Little stump there.
707000	710000	I've been told that'll keep growing back.
710000	711000	So let's hope.
711000	712000	So there we go.
712000	714000	I've got a bowl full of red leaf lettuce.
714000	716000	A bowl full of spinach.
716000	718000	And we cut two of the spinach plants.
718000	720000	Either two will be for tomorrow.
720000	724000	And either half of the lettuce bed will be for tomorrow as well.
724000	726000	OK, Naomi, I have the salad stuff.
726000	728000	Do you want it washed?
728000	730000	Obviously, Dev.
730000	733000	That's not an actual question.
733000	735000	Fuck.
735000	736000	But I mean that.
736000	737000	You could probably just.
737000	738000	No.
743000	748000	Oh, my God, do you hear that?
748000	751000	Look at the deck.
753000	755000	That's hail.
755000	758000	And that's the garden getting hailed on.
758000	761000	God damn it.
761000	764000	Look, this little ice ball landed on the windowsill.
764000	767000	That's what's hitting my garden right now.
767000	768000	Look at the roof of the shed.
768000	771000	Look at the roof of the shed.
771000	774000	I hope I don't lose the whole thing.
