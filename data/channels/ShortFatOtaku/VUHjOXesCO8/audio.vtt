00:00.000 --> 00:12.000
It's the early morning guys. Can you hear all those birds? Are these our cucumbers?

00:12.000 --> 00:18.000
These are our cucumbers. Are these our limp cucumbers? I told you they would be limp. Oh my god, that's a huge mess.

00:18.000 --> 00:25.000
Yeah, one of them sold a little. Oops. Only one. Only one! No, no, I know, I know. The thing with these, they're not bad.

00:26.000 --> 00:33.000
You just need a little TLC. We finally got cucumbers guys. How bad is the mess?

00:33.000 --> 00:35.000
It's pretty bad.

00:35.000 --> 00:41.000
So last night there was frost, however this time we were prepared, unlike last year, we bought a tarp.

00:41.000 --> 00:44.000
Oh, it's going to blow away.

00:44.000 --> 00:51.000
Okay, so the garden survived the frost. We have our cucumbers and they'll be going in today.

00:51.000 --> 00:57.000
This is a big tarp though. It's like 13 feet by 13 feet. I've got to roll it up or something.

00:57.000 --> 01:07.000
And we're basically folding it and rolling it the way that I learned in scouts. The one thing I remember is how to fold and roll a flag and it works for literally everything else.

01:07.000 --> 01:11.000
It's actually a pretty decent tarp too. It wasn't even that expensive.

01:11.000 --> 01:18.000
Great for Walmart sometimes I suppose. Wasn't it? Wasn't it? Can they entire? Oh my god, no, Walmart!

01:19.000 --> 01:28.000
Anyway, we'll stuff it in the shed somewhere. Maybe up at the top. Don't step on the plants Dev. I won't. I don't believe you.

01:28.000 --> 01:36.000
We had moved the lettuce here just to get it underneath the tarp for the night, but it can come back out now.

01:36.000 --> 01:43.000
I get to stick my hands and manure straight on once more this year. How does that make you feel Naomi?

01:43.000 --> 01:45.000
You're going to give me cholera.

01:45.000 --> 01:47.000
Dig down.

01:47.000 --> 01:49.000
And a big ol' handful.

01:49.000 --> 01:51.000
Ooh, it's kind of congealed in here.

01:51.000 --> 01:53.000
You've got to mix it up again.

01:53.000 --> 01:54.000
Gross.

01:54.000 --> 02:02.000
Since you're willing to touch manure with your bare skin, how much would people have to pay you to eat it?

02:02.000 --> 02:04.000
Probably a fair bit.

02:04.000 --> 02:06.000
How much? Give us a number Dev.

02:06.000 --> 02:07.000
I don't know.

02:07.000 --> 02:08.000
Give us a number.

02:08.000 --> 02:09.000
A fair bit.

02:09.000 --> 02:10.000
Number.

02:10.000 --> 02:11.000
You're a numb skull.

02:11.000 --> 02:13.000
Yes, that doesn't change the question.

02:13.000 --> 02:17.000
With the cucumbers in, Naomi's giving it the ol' garden.

02:17.000 --> 02:19.000
The ol' garden? Is that what I'm doing?

02:19.000 --> 02:21.000
The ol' watering is what I mean.

02:21.000 --> 02:22.000
Is that what I'm doing Dev?

02:22.000 --> 02:24.000
Let's see how it all turns out.

02:24.000 --> 02:28.000
I think the laundry is going to hit you soon. It's flapping right above you.

02:28.000 --> 02:30.000
It's too short for it to hit you.

02:30.000 --> 02:32.000
Oh, it's caught in the tree.

02:32.000 --> 02:34.000
Is that how we always get bugs in our laundry?

02:34.000 --> 02:35.000
Yes.

02:36.000 --> 02:38.000
Oh my God, guys.

02:38.000 --> 02:44.000
It's very dark out here and it's way too early for it to be this dark.

02:44.000 --> 02:56.000
And the reason is, out of nowhere a huge storm is blowing in right now.

02:56.000 --> 02:58.000
And there's going to be hail tonight.

02:58.000 --> 03:02.000
So that tarp's got to go back on this garden.

03:02.000 --> 03:04.000
Oh God, the rain's starting.

03:06.000 --> 03:07.000
I can't reach it.

03:07.000 --> 03:08.000
It's up here, right?

03:08.000 --> 03:09.000
Why did I put it up here?

03:09.000 --> 03:11.000
Because you're dumb.

03:11.000 --> 03:13.000
Nope, we got it. Okay.

03:13.000 --> 03:15.000
Oh God, the rain.

03:18.000 --> 03:20.000
Oh my God, guys.

03:22.000 --> 03:25.000
I don't know if you can hear me. This is what it looks like.

03:25.000 --> 03:30.000
We've pulled the tarp as tight as possible.

03:30.000 --> 03:31.000
Oh God, we're soaked.

03:31.000 --> 03:36.000
You pull the tarp as tight as possible and use bricks to hold it up.

03:36.000 --> 03:39.000
And we hope that's going to stay.

03:39.000 --> 03:42.000
And hopefully nothing gets crushed by pooling water.

03:47.000 --> 03:48.000
Oh God.

03:49.000 --> 03:52.000
And here it is from the upstairs view.

03:52.000 --> 03:56.000
Oh God, I hope the plants don't get fucked.

03:57.000 --> 03:58.000
Oh.

04:02.000 --> 04:07.000
I have a feeling that water's going to weigh it down too much and those bricks are going to come down.

04:07.000 --> 04:09.000
All we can do is hope for the...

04:09.000 --> 04:11.000
I don't even mind rain this hard.

04:11.000 --> 04:13.000
It's the fact that it might be hailing that's the problem.

04:13.000 --> 04:15.000
Oh, there they go.

04:16.000 --> 04:18.000
There they go.

04:27.000 --> 04:33.000
It is 7 am. We're out in the garden after last night's adventure.

04:33.000 --> 04:37.000
The tarp is drying off on the clothesline.

04:37.000 --> 04:43.000
Though, to be honest, the clothesline's not big enough because it basically touches the ground.

04:43.000 --> 04:48.000
I'm going to inspect the plants to see what happened.

04:48.000 --> 04:51.000
There was thankfully no actual hail, but there could have been.

04:51.000 --> 04:53.000
A lot of these guys look okay.

04:53.000 --> 04:56.000
A lot of these peas, they look just fine.

04:56.000 --> 04:58.000
The tomatoes look okay too.

04:58.000 --> 05:00.000
This one looks flattened.

05:00.000 --> 05:02.000
Did you break it all?

05:02.000 --> 05:04.000
No, it doesn't seem like it.

05:04.000 --> 05:06.000
Spinach looks fine.

05:06.000 --> 05:09.000
The kale's barely moved, but kale takes a long time to grow anyway.

05:09.000 --> 05:12.000
This pepper plant looks pretty mashed up.

05:12.000 --> 05:14.000
That leaf broke.

05:14.000 --> 05:15.000
That's done.

05:15.000 --> 05:18.000
The main stem is still intact, so maybe it'll be okay.

05:18.000 --> 05:20.000
This one back here lost a leaf.

05:20.000 --> 05:22.000
This one back here lost a leaf.

05:22.000 --> 05:25.000
And this one there broke a leaf at the bottom.

05:25.000 --> 05:28.000
I mean, all the stalks are still going though.

05:28.000 --> 05:30.000
And then here's our poor cucumbers.

05:30.000 --> 05:32.000
They stopped being so limp.

05:32.000 --> 05:34.000
I don't know if the storm crushed them or what.

05:34.000 --> 05:36.000
I mean, they're withering.

05:36.000 --> 05:38.000
I hope we didn't lose anything.

05:38.000 --> 05:41.000
I wouldn't want to have to restart the garden, you know?

05:41.000 --> 05:44.000
So this is about a week after the storm.

05:44.000 --> 05:46.000
And there's good news and bad news.

05:46.000 --> 05:48.000
Good news, look at all that lettuce.

05:48.000 --> 05:51.000
I'm going to trim it and start eating it because it's pretty much time.

05:51.000 --> 05:53.000
Same with the spinach. Look at the spinach, guys.

05:53.000 --> 05:55.000
It's really going.

05:55.000 --> 05:56.000
That's the good news.

05:56.000 --> 05:58.000
The kale takes a while to grow.

05:58.000 --> 05:59.000
And same with the peppers and stuff.

05:59.000 --> 06:00.000
But here's the bad news.

06:00.000 --> 06:04.000
The bad news is all of those kind of wilty looking cucumbers all died.

06:04.000 --> 06:07.000
I don't know if it was just the fact that they're wilty.

06:07.000 --> 06:11.000
Or if it was the fact that the storm killed them.

06:11.000 --> 06:14.000
To be fair, no offense to you, Naomi.

06:14.000 --> 06:17.000
It's just that your store is kind of shitty and I didn't expect them to actually work out.

06:17.000 --> 06:20.000
We've got to go buy new cucumbers because these ones, like, they died.

06:20.000 --> 06:23.000
It's kind of funny because a few of them, like, you can see how limp they are.

06:23.000 --> 06:25.000
They're just like in the dirt.

06:25.000 --> 06:27.000
A couple of them came back and then died again.

06:27.000 --> 06:30.000
So we're going to go try to find some more robust cucumbers today.

06:30.000 --> 06:33.000
A few fresh weeds growing. Geez, these things really took off.

06:33.000 --> 06:36.000
Yeah, man, you've got to weed the garden regularly.

06:36.000 --> 06:37.000
I'll leave that to you.

06:37.000 --> 06:38.000
Yeah?

06:38.000 --> 06:40.000
The peas themselves look okay.

06:40.000 --> 06:43.000
We've just got to start pushing them towards the lattice, you know?

06:44.000 --> 06:47.000
I think there was one pea that was kind of floppy, but I think it's...

06:47.000 --> 06:49.000
Is it this one here?

06:49.000 --> 06:51.000
Is this the floppy pea?

06:51.000 --> 06:53.000
Yes.

06:53.000 --> 06:55.000
No, this one here...

06:55.000 --> 06:57.000
Wait, that's just a leaf.

06:57.000 --> 06:59.000
These aren't necessarily... They're kind of floppy.

06:59.000 --> 07:01.000
I think they're actually okay.

07:01.000 --> 07:04.000
I think we've just got to, like, pull these towards...

07:04.000 --> 07:07.000
I think if I can just... Come on.

07:07.000 --> 07:09.000
Come on, just... This way!

07:09.000 --> 07:11.000
They'll figure it out. They'll figure it out.

07:11.000 --> 07:13.000
I think they will. I think they might need human intervention.

07:13.000 --> 07:15.000
Okay, but, like, there's only so much...

07:15.000 --> 07:18.000
Like, I can't just yank them. They're still kind of tiny.

07:18.000 --> 07:21.000
It's been kind of cold and kind of wet after that storm came through, so...

07:21.000 --> 07:24.000
Well, it's the slowest art warming up again.

07:24.000 --> 07:27.000
Yeah, but, hey, all the leaves are going good, so we've got to start having salads soon.

07:27.000 --> 07:29.000
Yum, yum.

07:29.000 --> 07:31.000
I mean, more salad than we've already been having.

07:31.000 --> 07:32.000
Yeah.

07:32.000 --> 07:35.000
Geez, this is a huge selection.

07:35.000 --> 07:37.000
I don't see any cucumbers, though, do you?

07:37.000 --> 07:38.000
No.

07:38.000 --> 07:40.000
Ow, I just bonked my head in something.

07:40.000 --> 07:42.000
These are actually in pretty decent shape.

07:42.000 --> 07:43.000
I mean, like, this one's not.

07:43.000 --> 07:44.000
And this one's not.

07:44.000 --> 07:45.000
And this one's not.

07:45.000 --> 07:47.000
Like, look at that.

07:47.000 --> 07:48.000
But...

07:48.000 --> 07:49.000
Let me... Ouch.

07:49.000 --> 07:50.000
I bonked my head again.

07:50.000 --> 07:51.000
Is it a cucumber?

07:51.000 --> 07:52.000
Yes.

07:52.000 --> 07:53.000
Cucumber.

07:53.000 --> 07:55.000
And it's actually in pretty decent shape, yeah.

07:55.000 --> 07:58.000
Hey, Naomi, how mad would you be if I sprayed you with that thing?

07:58.000 --> 08:00.000
Well, pretty mad.

08:00.000 --> 08:02.000
Is that the case?

08:02.000 --> 08:03.000
Yeah, it is, yeah.

08:03.000 --> 08:06.000
I'm actually surprised that we got such good ones right away.

08:06.000 --> 08:08.000
I thought we had to shop around.

08:08.000 --> 08:09.000
Geez.

08:09.000 --> 08:10.000
Here they are.

08:10.000 --> 08:11.000
Alright.

08:11.000 --> 08:12.000
I'm gonna put them in.

08:12.000 --> 08:14.000
Should I put the seatbelt on them?

08:14.000 --> 08:16.000
Do you want to tuck them in?

08:16.000 --> 08:19.000
Taking a break from salad stuff for sushi.

08:19.000 --> 08:21.000
Guys, Naomi likes getting hand rolls.

08:21.000 --> 08:22.000
What a pleb.

08:22.000 --> 08:25.000
Alright, we're back at the ol' homestead.

08:25.000 --> 08:26.000
Pull.

08:26.000 --> 08:28.000
This thing's just dead.

08:28.000 --> 08:30.000
Pull it out.

08:30.000 --> 08:33.000
Whatever remains will go into the compost.

08:33.000 --> 08:36.000
And then we do the whole diggy again.

08:36.000 --> 08:38.000
Let's hope these new ones work out.

08:38.000 --> 08:40.000
Oh, the manure has dried up quite a bit.

08:40.000 --> 08:41.000
Big handful.

08:41.000 --> 08:43.000
In it goes.

08:43.000 --> 08:47.000
And now, how do we get it out?

08:47.000 --> 08:48.000
I was going to do it one-handed.

08:48.000 --> 08:50.000
I just wanted to put the camera down.

08:50.000 --> 08:56.000
And just, oh, look at that.

08:56.000 --> 09:00.000
And now, put it through the mesh.

09:00.000 --> 09:05.000
I don't want anything to get caught accidentally.

09:05.000 --> 09:08.000
And there it goes.

09:08.000 --> 09:10.000
Our new cucumbers.

09:10.000 --> 09:16.000
Let's hope these ones do not die like the last ones did.

09:16.000 --> 09:18.000
Hey, check this out.

09:18.000 --> 09:20.000
I began digging the next hole.

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
And this little guy, he just popped out.

09:22.000 --> 09:24.000
He's a little wormy.

09:24.000 --> 09:25.000
He's moving.

09:25.000 --> 09:27.000
Do you see him?

09:27.000 --> 09:28.000
Hey, buddy.

09:28.000 --> 09:30.000
Oh, he's going back in.

09:30.000 --> 09:31.000
There we go.

09:32.000 --> 09:35.000
All four are in.

09:35.000 --> 09:37.000
Unless the garden's doing OK.

09:37.000 --> 09:41.000
There's Naomi honking her way up the driveway.

09:41.000 --> 09:44.000
Hey, Naomi.

09:44.000 --> 09:46.000
Do you know if it's going to rain today?

09:46.000 --> 09:47.000
So is it raining?

09:47.000 --> 09:48.000
No.

09:48.000 --> 09:49.000
No?

09:49.000 --> 09:50.000
Not raining.

09:50.000 --> 09:51.000
OK, I guess I have to water the garden then.

09:51.000 --> 09:52.000
Also, I got a really poopy hand.

09:52.000 --> 09:53.000
You want some?

09:53.000 --> 09:55.000
Fuck off.

09:55.000 --> 09:56.000
Here we are.

09:56.000 --> 09:58.000
Back side of the house.

09:58.000 --> 10:01.000
Get some water.

10:01.000 --> 10:04.000
I don't even know if you can hear me, but.

10:04.000 --> 10:08.000
So hopefully, you don't have to replace any more plants.

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
That'd be nice.

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
I'm not fond of having to do it.

10:12.000 --> 10:16.000
But that is just a necessity sometimes.

10:16.000 --> 10:20.000
Now, it's a couple of days later and check it out.

10:20.000 --> 10:27.000
These cucumber sprouts are doing OK.

10:28.000 --> 10:34.000
It looks like this, this pea broke in the wind or something.

10:34.000 --> 10:36.000
Well, that sucks.

10:36.000 --> 10:39.000
But the peas seem to be going all right.

10:39.000 --> 10:40.000
It's going for the tomato thing.

10:40.000 --> 10:41.000
No.

10:41.000 --> 10:43.000
Stop going for the tomato thing.

10:43.000 --> 10:44.000
It's literally right here.

10:44.000 --> 10:47.000
Look at this spinach, guys.

10:47.000 --> 10:53.000
I should be able to literally just pick off all the leaves.

10:53.000 --> 10:55.000
Like so.

10:55.000 --> 10:58.000
Look at all the decent leaves.

10:58.000 --> 11:03.000
And the plant will regrow with new leaves.

11:03.000 --> 11:06.000
But the real prize is this lettuce and it's got to be cut now.

11:06.000 --> 11:08.000
I can't even fit it in the frame.

11:08.000 --> 11:11.000
OK, so if I just.

11:11.000 --> 11:13.000
Ow.

11:13.000 --> 11:17.000
Take the scissors and just like a cut.

11:20.000 --> 11:23.000
I can just cut all the leaves.

11:23.000 --> 11:24.000
Lettuce with gravel in it.

11:24.000 --> 11:25.000
No problem.

11:25.000 --> 11:32.000
Just give a few inches of the plant left.

11:37.000 --> 11:40.000
Give a few inches of the plant left.

11:40.000 --> 11:45.000
And it should be OK to keep growing back.

11:45.000 --> 11:47.000
Little stump there.

11:47.000 --> 11:50.000
I've been told that'll keep growing back.

11:50.000 --> 11:51.000
So let's hope.

11:51.000 --> 11:52.000
So there we go.

11:52.000 --> 11:54.000
I've got a bowl full of red leaf lettuce.

11:54.000 --> 11:56.000
A bowl full of spinach.

11:56.000 --> 11:58.000
And we cut two of the spinach plants.

11:58.000 --> 12:00.000
Either two will be for tomorrow.

12:00.000 --> 12:04.000
And either half of the lettuce bed will be for tomorrow as well.

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
OK, Naomi, I have the salad stuff.

12:06.000 --> 12:08.000
Do you want it washed?

12:08.000 --> 12:10.000
Obviously, Dev.

12:10.000 --> 12:13.000
That's not an actual question.

12:13.000 --> 12:15.000
Fuck.

12:15.000 --> 12:16.000
But I mean that.

12:16.000 --> 12:17.000
You could probably just.

12:17.000 --> 12:18.000
No.

12:23.000 --> 12:28.000
Oh, my God, do you hear that?

12:28.000 --> 12:31.000
Look at the deck.

12:33.000 --> 12:35.000
That's hail.

12:35.000 --> 12:38.000
And that's the garden getting hailed on.

12:38.000 --> 12:41.000
God damn it.

12:41.000 --> 12:44.000
Look, this little ice ball landed on the windowsill.

12:44.000 --> 12:47.000
That's what's hitting my garden right now.

12:47.000 --> 12:48.000
Look at the roof of the shed.

12:48.000 --> 12:51.000
Look at the roof of the shed.

12:51.000 --> 12:54.000
I hope I don't lose the whole thing.
