1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,000
It's the early morning guys. Can you hear all those birds? Are these our cucumbers?

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:18,000
These are our cucumbers. Are these our limp cucumbers? I told you they would be limp. Oh my god, that's a huge mess.

3
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Yeah, one of them sold a little. Oops. Only one. Only one! No, no, I know, I know. The thing with these, they're not bad.

4
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:33,000
You just need a little TLC. We finally got cucumbers guys. How bad is the mess?

5
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
It's pretty bad.

6
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:41,000
So last night there was frost, however this time we were prepared, unlike last year, we bought a tarp.

7
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Oh, it's going to blow away.

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Okay, so the garden survived the frost. We have our cucumbers and they'll be going in today.

9
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:57,000
This is a big tarp though. It's like 13 feet by 13 feet. I've got to roll it up or something.

10
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:07,000
And we're basically folding it and rolling it the way that I learned in scouts. The one thing I remember is how to fold and roll a flag and it works for literally everything else.

11
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
It's actually a pretty decent tarp too. It wasn't even that expensive.

12
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Great for Walmart sometimes I suppose. Wasn't it? Wasn't it? Can they entire? Oh my god, no, Walmart!

13
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Anyway, we'll stuff it in the shed somewhere. Maybe up at the top. Don't step on the plants Dev. I won't. I don't believe you.

14
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:36,000
We had moved the lettuce here just to get it underneath the tarp for the night, but it can come back out now.

15
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I get to stick my hands and manure straight on once more this year. How does that make you feel Naomi?

16
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
You're going to give me cholera.

17
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Dig down.

18
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
And a big ol' handful.

19
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Ooh, it's kind of congealed in here.

20
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
You've got to mix it up again.

21
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Gross.

22
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Since you're willing to touch manure with your bare skin, how much would people have to pay you to eat it?

23
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Probably a fair bit.

24
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
How much? Give us a number Dev.

25
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I don't know.

26
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Give us a number.

27
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
A fair bit.

28
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Number.

29
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
You're a numb skull.

30
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Yes, that doesn't change the question.

31
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
With the cucumbers in, Naomi's giving it the ol' garden.

32
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
The ol' garden? Is that what I'm doing?

33
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
The ol' watering is what I mean.

34
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Is that what I'm doing Dev?

35
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Let's see how it all turns out.

36
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I think the laundry is going to hit you soon. It's flapping right above you.

37
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
It's too short for it to hit you.

38
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Oh, it's caught in the tree.

39
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Is that how we always get bugs in our laundry?

40
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Yes.

41
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Oh my God, guys.

42
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:44,000
It's very dark out here and it's way too early for it to be this dark.

43
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:56,000
And the reason is, out of nowhere a huge storm is blowing in right now.

44
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
And there's going to be hail tonight.

45
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
So that tarp's got to go back on this garden.

46
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Oh God, the rain's starting.

47
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I can't reach it.

48
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
It's up here, right?

49
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Why did I put it up here?

50
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Because you're dumb.

51
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Nope, we got it. Okay.

52
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Oh God, the rain.

53
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Oh my God, guys.

54
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I don't know if you can hear me. This is what it looks like.

55
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:30,000
We've pulled the tarp as tight as possible.

56
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Oh God, we're soaked.

57
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:36,000
You pull the tarp as tight as possible and use bricks to hold it up.

58
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
And we hope that's going to stay.

59
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
And hopefully nothing gets crushed by pooling water.

60
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Oh God.

61
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
And here it is from the upstairs view.

62
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Oh God, I hope the plants don't get fucked.

63
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Oh.

64
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I have a feeling that water's going to weigh it down too much and those bricks are going to come down.

65
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
All we can do is hope for the...

66
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I don't even mind rain this hard.

67
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
It's the fact that it might be hailing that's the problem.

68
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Oh, there they go.

69
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
There they go.

70
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:33,000
It is 7 am. We're out in the garden after last night's adventure.

71
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,000
The tarp is drying off on the clothesline.

72
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Though, to be honest, the clothesline's not big enough because it basically touches the ground.

73
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I'm going to inspect the plants to see what happened.

74
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
There was thankfully no actual hail, but there could have been.

75
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
A lot of these guys look okay.

76
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
A lot of these peas, they look just fine.

77
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
The tomatoes look okay too.

78
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
This one looks flattened.

79
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Did you break it all?

80
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
No, it doesn't seem like it.

81
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Spinach looks fine.

82
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
The kale's barely moved, but kale takes a long time to grow anyway.

83
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
This pepper plant looks pretty mashed up.

84
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
That leaf broke.

85
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
That's done.

86
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
The main stem is still intact, so maybe it'll be okay.

87
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
This one back here lost a leaf.

88
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
This one back here lost a leaf.

89
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
And this one there broke a leaf at the bottom.

90
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I mean, all the stalks are still going though.

91
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
And then here's our poor cucumbers.

92
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
They stopped being so limp.

93
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I don't know if the storm crushed them or what.

94
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I mean, they're withering.

95
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I hope we didn't lose anything.

96
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
I wouldn't want to have to restart the garden, you know?

97
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
So this is about a week after the storm.

98
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
And there's good news and bad news.

99
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Good news, look at all that lettuce.

100
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I'm going to trim it and start eating it because it's pretty much time.

101
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Same with the spinach. Look at the spinach, guys.

102
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
It's really going.

103
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
That's the good news.

104
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
The kale takes a while to grow.

105
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
And same with the peppers and stuff.

106
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
But here's the bad news.

107
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,000
The bad news is all of those kind of wilty looking cucumbers all died.

108
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I don't know if it was just the fact that they're wilty.

109
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Or if it was the fact that the storm killed them.

110
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
To be fair, no offense to you, Naomi.

111
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
It's just that your store is kind of shitty and I didn't expect them to actually work out.

112
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
We've got to go buy new cucumbers because these ones, like, they died.

113
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
It's kind of funny because a few of them, like, you can see how limp they are.

114
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
They're just like in the dirt.

115
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
A couple of them came back and then died again.

116
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
So we're going to go try to find some more robust cucumbers today.

117
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
A few fresh weeds growing. Geez, these things really took off.

118
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Yeah, man, you've got to weed the garden regularly.

119
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I'll leave that to you.

120
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Yeah?

121
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
The peas themselves look okay.

122
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
We've just got to start pushing them towards the lattice, you know?

123
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I think there was one pea that was kind of floppy, but I think it's...

124
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Is it this one here?

125
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Is this the floppy pea?

126
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Yes.

127
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
No, this one here...

128
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Wait, that's just a leaf.

129
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
These aren't necessarily... They're kind of floppy.

130
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
I think they're actually okay.

131
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I think we've just got to, like, pull these towards...

132
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
I think if I can just... Come on.

133
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Come on, just... This way!

134
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
They'll figure it out. They'll figure it out.

135
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I think they will. I think they might need human intervention.

136
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Okay, but, like, there's only so much...

137
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Like, I can't just yank them. They're still kind of tiny.

138
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
It's been kind of cold and kind of wet after that storm came through, so...

139
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Well, it's the slowest art warming up again.

140
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Yeah, but, hey, all the leaves are going good, so we've got to start having salads soon.

141
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Yum, yum.

142
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
I mean, more salad than we've already been having.

143
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Yeah.

144
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Geez, this is a huge selection.

145
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
I don't see any cucumbers, though, do you?

146
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
No.

147
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Ow, I just bonked my head in something.

148
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
These are actually in pretty decent shape.

149
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
I mean, like, this one's not.

150
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
And this one's not.

151
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
And this one's not.

152
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Like, look at that.

153
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
But...

154
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Let me... Ouch.

155
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I bonked my head again.

156
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Is it a cucumber?

157
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Yes.

158
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Cucumber.

159
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
And it's actually in pretty decent shape, yeah.

160
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Hey, Naomi, how mad would you be if I sprayed you with that thing?

161
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Well, pretty mad.

162
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Is that the case?

163
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Yeah, it is, yeah.

164
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I'm actually surprised that we got such good ones right away.

165
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
I thought we had to shop around.

166
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Geez.

167
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Here they are.

168
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Alright.

169
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I'm gonna put them in.

170
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Should I put the seatbelt on them?

171
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Do you want to tuck them in?

172
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Taking a break from salad stuff for sushi.

173
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Guys, Naomi likes getting hand rolls.

174
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
What a pleb.

175
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Alright, we're back at the ol' homestead.

176
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Pull.

177
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
This thing's just dead.

178
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Pull it out.

179
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Whatever remains will go into the compost.

180
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
And then we do the whole diggy again.

181
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Let's hope these new ones work out.

182
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Oh, the manure has dried up quite a bit.

183
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Big handful.

184
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
In it goes.

185
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:47,000
And now, how do we get it out?

186
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
I was going to do it one-handed.

187
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I just wanted to put the camera down.

188
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:56,000
And just, oh, look at that.

189
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,000
And now, put it through the mesh.

190
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:05,000
I don't want anything to get caught accidentally.

191
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
And there it goes.

192
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Our new cucumbers.

193
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Let's hope these ones do not die like the last ones did.

194
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Hey, check this out.

195
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I began digging the next hole.

196
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
And this little guy, he just popped out.

197
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
He's a little wormy.

198
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
He's moving.

199
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Do you see him?

200
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Hey, buddy.

201
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Oh, he's going back in.

202
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
There we go.

203
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
All four are in.

204
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Unless the garden's doing OK.

205
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,000
There's Naomi honking her way up the driveway.

206
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Hey, Naomi.

207
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Do you know if it's going to rain today?

208
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
So is it raining?

209
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
No.

210
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
No?

211
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Not raining.

212
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
OK, I guess I have to water the garden then.

213
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Also, I got a really poopy hand.

214
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
You want some?

215
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Fuck off.

216
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Here we are.

217
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Back side of the house.

218
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Get some water.

219
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
I don't even know if you can hear me, but.

220
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,000
So hopefully, you don't have to replace any more plants.

221
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
That'd be nice.

222
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
I'm not fond of having to do it.

223
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,000
But that is just a necessity sometimes.

224
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Now, it's a couple of days later and check it out.

225
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:27,000
These cucumber sprouts are doing OK.

226
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:34,000
It looks like this, this pea broke in the wind or something.

227
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Well, that sucks.

228
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
But the peas seem to be going all right.

229
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
It's going for the tomato thing.

230
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
No.

231
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Stop going for the tomato thing.

232
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
It's literally right here.

233
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Look at this spinach, guys.

234
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:53,000
I should be able to literally just pick off all the leaves.

235
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Like so.

236
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Look at all the decent leaves.

237
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:03,000
And the plant will regrow with new leaves.

238
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,000
But the real prize is this lettuce and it's got to be cut now.

239
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
I can't even fit it in the frame.

240
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
OK, so if I just.

241
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Ow.

242
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Take the scissors and just like a cut.

243
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
I can just cut all the leaves.

244
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Lettuce with gravel in it.

245
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
No problem.

246
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Just give a few inches of the plant left.

247
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Give a few inches of the plant left.

248
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:45,000
And it should be OK to keep growing back.

249
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Little stump there.

250
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,000
I've been told that'll keep growing back.

251
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
So let's hope.

252
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
So there we go.

253
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
I've got a bowl full of red leaf lettuce.

254
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
A bowl full of spinach.

255
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
And we cut two of the spinach plants.

256
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Either two will be for tomorrow.

257
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,000
And either half of the lettuce bed will be for tomorrow as well.

258
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
OK, Naomi, I have the salad stuff.

259
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Do you want it washed?

260
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Obviously, Dev.

261
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
That's not an actual question.

262
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Fuck.

263
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
But I mean that.

264
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
You could probably just.

265
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
No.

266
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Oh, my God, do you hear that?

267
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Look at the deck.

268
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
That's hail.

269
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,000
And that's the garden getting hailed on.

270
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
God damn it.

271
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Look, this little ice ball landed on the windowsill.

272
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,000
That's what's hitting my garden right now.

273
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Look at the roof of the shed.

274
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Look at the roof of the shed.

275
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
I hope I don't lose the whole thing.
