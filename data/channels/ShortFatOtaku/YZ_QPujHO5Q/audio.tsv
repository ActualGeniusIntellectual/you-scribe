0	10300	Tangentially related to the whole trigger warning thing is using an asterisk to censor
10300	14620	a name, generally by replacing the first vowel with the asterisk.
14620	16160	It looks something like this.
16160	20360	Trigger warning, sexual assault, rape, and murder, with various letters being censored.
20360	21960	I'm sure you've noticed this before.
21960	25160	And yeah, this is pretty messed up, isn't it?
25160	26160	Jesus.
26160	27160	It is.
27160	30160	It goes hand in hand with trigger warnings, simply as part of the warning.
30160	35880	So you don't have to be even further triggered by looking at the full word of murder or rape.
35880	40940	Now what this actually comes from is a website called Atsizklar.com, I think it's pronounced.
40940	43120	I don't know, it's Turkish and I can't pronounce any of that.
43120	48080	But it was a Turkish ultra nationalist website, kind of like stormfront.org, but for Turkish
48080	49080	people.
49080	55040	Back in 2009, the admins of that forum wanted to censor debates about Kurdish people.
55040	56920	So they set up a filter on their forums.
56920	59260	You couldn't post Kurd or Kurdish.
59260	64680	To bypass this, people started to put an asterisk in place of the U in Kurd.
64680	68700	And eventually that form of Kurd began to be used as an insult.
68700	72880	This floated around the Turkish internet for a while, but around 2012, I remember seeing
72880	77400	it on some more obscure sites like 4chan or other smaller message boards.
77400	80240	By 2017, it had broken into the English mainstream.
80240	81960	And now you see it all the time like this.
81960	82960	Wake up.
82960	83960	Still not British.
83960	85640	It basically improves noticeably.
85640	91560	It started as slang terminology to disparagingly refer to people of different ethnic or national
91560	92560	origins.
92560	96520	But when it crossed the language barrier and jumped over to the English side of the internet,
96520	101940	because of the asterisks already heavy use in censorship, the two uses combined and became
101940	104300	their own very strange phenomenon.
104300	109800	The combination of censorship as well as adding the ethnic or group identity element basically
109800	114080	made the asterisk a perfect pairing with stuff like trigger warnings, which is why
114080	115640	you get messages like this.
115640	116640	Trigger warning.
116640	117640	Misogyny.
117640	118640	Incels.
118640	119640	Murder.
119640	120860	I recently proposed to our project manager of introducing performance metrics to keep
120860	121860	our developers in check.
121860	125440	We will collect the data and use it to determine whether employee productivity is up.
125440	130200	This absolute incel, with a censored E of course, emailed me this bigoted message.
130200	132240	I have submitted to HR his threatening response.
132240	136720	And the message was just basically, implement this and I will kill you.
136720	140520	I mean, I can see how that can be taken as a joke, but you know what?
140520	142800	You're working in a professional environment, maybe you should cool it.
142800	144840	But nonetheless, incel is censored.
144840	146880	Yeah, I'm kind of curious actually.
146880	155200	What if we did something like, I N C asterisks L and search for that specific, what do we
155200	156200	get?
156200	159100	What is it with men making group chats about women they don't like?
159100	160260	Incel behavior.
160260	163160	Men of means don't do, wait, women do this about men.
163160	164160	Jesus.
164160	168320	This is gonna make me sound like an incel, but VTubers don't make me, why are you censoring
168320	169320	incel?
169320	171240	There's no, oh, it's because, oh, oh, okay.
171240	175880	I'm looking forward to an incel revolution when they have the first female bond.
175880	178640	There's no way these people, these random ass people are triggered.
178640	179640	I mean, maybe.
179640	181360	Why do they feel the need to do this?
181360	183360	All right, let's try murder.
183360	185480	M asterisks R D E R.
185480	188720	Yeah, when it comes to murder, these seem to be more like jokey, right?
188720	191000	Like they're kind of in on the joke, they get it.
191000	192000	Fair enough.
192000	194960	How about rape?
194960	199420	Why slut shaming contributes to rape culture, enthusiastic consent and sex positively are
199420	200720	widely undesirable.
200720	204420	I'm just gonna, I'm just gonna, I'm not gonna listen to your nonsense, but how soft do you
204420	208840	have to be to censor the word rape when talking about rape culture?
208840	212480	The superintendent looked the father in the eye and said that not only did the rape not
212480	214760	happen, but the student did not exist.
214760	219840	The sheriff's department found and charged the student with two counts of forcible, why
219840	222900	are you censoring sodomy?
222900	225440	Sometimes it's hard to tell whether it's a joke or not, but eventually it does become
225440	226440	rather ridiculous.
226440	227440	Doesn't it?
227440	229840	I understand that doctors are including obesity.
229840	233600	There's the censored one, obesity as an underlying medical condition that late, that leads to
233600	234920	death in COVID patients.
234920	238760	Do these doctors have any idea what kind of impact this has on families to be told that
238760	242040	their loved one's body shape is partly to blame for their death?
242040	243540	It's true though, isn't it?
243540	249760	Do you have any idea what kind of impact being told that being fat has negative health consequences?
250480	253520	This is, I can't believe that I'm seeing this stuff.
253520	255620	Nobody can be told anything negative now.
255620	256960	These are all spoiled children.
256960	260200	Give me one good reason for recording fatness as a cause of death.
260200	265840	Well, how about if you're so fat that your heart can no longer beat because it's encased
265840	269640	in a globe of fat and it just can't move anymore.
269640	272280	Imagine being so triggered by the word obesity that you have to censor it.
272280	273280	It's fucking wild, isn't it?
273280	277280	Remember when the fragile white, there's, I guess there, I don't know why they're sensing
277280	286580	fragile, but white, fragile white men made these stupid, is stupid a slur that needs
286580	291320	to be censored?
291320	292320	You know what?
292320	298440	I think, I think the next, the next frontier and all of this stuff will be like intelligence-ist.
298440	302320	If you're too smart, you're too privileged and we need to equalize you with all the dumb
302320	303320	people.
303320	307680	This is all fun and games, but this tendency of using the asterisk in this way actually
307680	313000	took a swerve at one point where they began using it on like real events or real people's
313000	314000	names.
314000	320480	As if talking about somebody, just referencing that they exist as a human is just too triggering.
320480	322240	You can't, you can't do it in public.
322240	324280	Content warning, trigger warning, hi, hi.
324280	325280	Just a heads up.
325280	332160	If you see Jake Paul, Jake Paul pop up on your feeds, it's probably about sexual assault
332160	334580	and human trafficking.
334580	339560	So please be careful when reading, dude, never drive a vehicle ever again.
339560	344480	I'm not going to comment on JK Rowling's new book other than that the portag's ridiculous
344480	346000	name makes me laugh every time I see it.
346000	347000	That's right.
347000	351380	JK Rowling went from like the progressive darling to persona non grata, progressive
351380	352380	non grata.
352380	359200	Here, let's see if I can like do this, you know, search Rowling.
359200	362540	I know this is nothing new, but I go through phases where I'm reminded how deeply hurt
362540	365200	I am by JK Rowling and I can't let it go.
365200	369260	I am so angry with the fact that I can't look or think about Harry Potter without getting
369260	371520	incredibly sad or feeling so betrayed.
371520	375440	I wonder how they would react if they like walk by a bookstore and there's like a sign
375440	379000	for like a new book or something and it says by JK Rowling.
379000	380000	Do they have seizures?
380000	382040	Do they just start like shaking on the ground?
382040	384640	Turfs can have Rowling and Chappelle.
384640	387080	I'm going to have to do a video on this Chappelle thing, aren't I?
387080	391040	It just keeps blowing up with the Netflix walkouts and stuff breaking white feminist
391040	398200	queen Margaret Atwood joins the ranks of JK and who I can't even tell who this person
398200	399600	is.
399600	404120	I can't recognize who is this person with these with these sensors.
404120	405240	I can't even look it up.
405240	409360	In fact, the whole can't even look it up seems to be the purpose of some of this.
409360	414140	The use of asterisks in this way eventually transitioned not only to show how the person
414140	419260	that you're talking about is they who must not be named, ironically enough, but also
419260	424740	because a lot of these people, especially if they're on Twitter, they think that these
424740	429780	larger known figures, these public figures, these creators sometimes that they name search
429780	430780	themselves.
430780	433220	And I'm sure people name search themselves at least once in a while.
433220	436980	You know, I might do it like once a year or something instead of curiosity.
436980	442520	But most people who are too busy doing their own thing, not spending all this time on Twitter
442520	443960	on Google name searching themselves.
443960	448560	They're not like reading their own Kiwi Farms threads or something, except shoe on head.
448560	453800	She does actually do that, but just called the TCU PD to report the large social gathering
453800	458760	caused by Steven Crowder and they told me that TCU gave him a permit to be there.
458760	460480	They can't do anything else.
460480	466080	Like do you think Steven Crowder just sits up at night searching for his name on Twitter
466080	469480	and you do this so that he won't notice that you're being critical of him in public?
469480	473720	Like it's either that or you genuinely think that the name Steven Crowder is triggering.
473720	474800	It's one of the two.
474800	477000	So I guess pick which way that you're going to be stupid then.
477000	478000	All right.
478000	479000	All right.
479000	480000	I got to see how far some of this goes.
480000	481000	Okay.
481000	482000	Let's try out Sargon.
482000	487900	Do you think it would be, I think it would be the, the A that gets censored or the O.
487900	489600	Let's try the A first.
489600	494360	That video of Sargon reacting to the don't say the R slur PSA by perpetuating repeating
494360	497280	every slur in the video and angrily shouting, who the fuck do you think you are?
497280	501040	My mom tells you exactly at which stage of the development his brain got stuck on.
501040	502040	What stage do you mean?
502040	505520	You mean the stage that you don't want to be told by some fucking nanny what to do?
505520	506520	I don't know, dude.
506520	510480	You sound kind of like a retard when you see a decent long play YouTube channel that likes
510480	512120	and follow Sargon of a kid.
512120	517760	I, uh, I'm not going to name any names, but at this point I know a number of very large
517760	520080	gaming YouTubers who watch my content.
520080	524120	Hi guys, by the way, people who are way past the 1 million sub Mark, not going to reveal
524120	526120	who they are, but yeah.
526120	532560	If you have a favorite gaming channel on YouTube, they're probably watching antisocialist content
532560	533560	and good.
533560	535680	I can hear my dad listening to Sargon.
535680	537360	You didn't even censor it properly.
537360	541760	And also, I guess he wants to learn about the tenants of dadism since he has a dad after
541760	542760	all.
542760	543760	This is back in 2016.
543760	545000	They've been doing this for a while.
545000	550000	Sargon fans are upset that gray bloke is an anti-feminist Nazi now, not politically incorrect
550000	551680	like he supposedly was before.
551680	556880	You go back to like a lot of, a lot of YouTubers from like 2010, 2011, 2012, all of them said
556880	560120	stuff like retard and faggot, all of them.
560120	564400	Even people who are squeaky clean now, like Veritasium, it makes every single person at
564400	567320	interviews look like a complete retard or Vsauce.
567320	576800	Wonder woman, Wonder woman, Wonder woman, Wonder woman, Wonder woman, Wonder woman,
576800	580800	Wonder woman, Wonder woman, Wonder woman, Wonder woman, Wonder woman, Wonder woman,
580800	585920	Wonder woman, Wonder woman, Wonder woman, Wonder woman, Wonder woman, Wonder woman,
585920	586920	Wonder woman, Wonder woman, Wonder woman, Wonder woman, Wonder woman, Wonder woman,
586920	587920	Wonder woman, Wonder woman, Wonder woman, Wonder woman, Wonder woman, Wonder woman,
587920	588920	Wonder woman, Wonder woman, Wonder woman, Wonder woman, Wonder woman, Wonder woman,
588920	589920	Wonder woman, Wonder woman, Wonder woman, Wonder woman, Wonder woman, Wonder woman,
589920	590920	Wonder woman, Wonder woman, Wonder woman, Wonder woman, Wonder woman, Wonder woman,
590920	591920	Wonder woman, Wonder woman, Wonder woman, Wonder woman, Wonder woman, Wonder woman,
591920	592920	Wonder woman, Wonder woman, Wonder woman, Wonder woman, Wonder woman, Wonder woman,
592920	593920	Wonder woman, Wonder woman, Wonder woman, Wonder woman, Wonder woman, Wonder woman,
593920	594920	Wonder woman, Wonder woman, Wonder woman, Wonder woman, Wonder woman, Wonder woman,
594920	595920	Wonder woman, Wonder woman, Wonder woman, Wonder woman, Wonder woman, Wonder woman,
595920	596920	Wait, really?
596920	598960	Like, no, no, they're not.
598960	599960	You can fuck around.
599960	600960	You can make jokes.
600960	603880	You can be not serious sometimes.
603880	606280	You can engage in banter and still be a good person.
606280	610480	I feel like I'm unearthing hidden gems by searching for people's names like this.
610480	611480	Let's try something else.
611480	617880	Why don't we try, um, let's try Ben Shapiro, let's just do Shapiro, do something like that.
617880	618880	Let's try it.
618880	619880	What do we get?
619880	624000	Oh God, Kyle Calagren, that guy with the glasses leftover, just had a minor heart attack seeing
624000	625680	the name of the actress playing Dorothy.
625680	628080	It's not Ben Shapiro's sister, they just have the same name.
628080	631120	Imagine having a heart attack because the sister of a political pundit that you don't
631120	634200	like might have a public facing job.
634200	635200	Fucking unreal.
635200	636360	These people are soft, dude.
636360	637620	Someone please come and shoot me.
637620	641960	My older brother's listening to Ben Shapiro's review of the Squid Game at 1.5 times speed
641960	642960	at full volume.
642960	643960	Based!
643960	646680	But listen, though, he's not, he's not at Giga child levels yet.
646680	648200	You have to watch it at two times speed.
648200	652240	My new hobby is censoring the names of people I don't like, like Ben Shapiro.
652240	655880	I think it's so funny for no reason.
655880	657880	Me too, buddy.
657880	660320	Alright, let's try Dankula.
660320	664200	Think we got something for Dankula?
664200	668240	The absolute shock of seeing someone retweet Dankula onto my timeline.
668240	670040	Been a while since I had to unfollow manually.
670040	671840	Yeah, it's, it's rough, isn't it?
671840	676520	To see his wholesome takes about his child and his wife, maybe some free speech stuff.
676520	679800	Every once in a while, that picture of his balls with like a smiley face on them.
679800	683680	If I hadn't done the tweet that Count Dankula replied to, would he have replied to somebody
683680	684920	else instead with the same thing?
684920	686360	Am I taking one for the team?
686360	690440	Or have my actions inadvertently caused more fascist bullshit to be in the world than there
690440	691640	would have been otherwise?
691640	694560	This is your brain on pure consequentialist ethics, guys.
694560	697720	Oh my god, I said something that an undesirable touched.
697720	700660	I need to sit here for the next six hours and calculate this shit out.
700660	704040	My face when I block all the weird Dankula fanboys amendments.
704040	707040	Hold on a minute.
707040	708400	What?
708400	710760	You're white.
710760	712320	You're fucking white, dude.
712320	715040	What is this digital ass black face you're engaging in here?
715040	716600	Get the fuck out of here.
716600	720240	I see Dankula is complaining cancel culture is stopping him from ever getting a normal
720240	721240	job.
721240	722240	It's all the mean lefty's fault.
722240	726960	Nothing to do with the idea nobody would want to employ an unwashed cunt who's very public,
726960	730880	unapologetic, racist, misogynist bullshit landed him in court.
730880	735400	You mean teaching a dog how to salute?
735400	736520	How to do the Nazi salute?
736520	739120	Like, is that what we're talking about?
739120	740120	You know what?
740120	741120	Fuck it.
741120	742120	I'm going to recreate that.
742120	743400	As soon as I get a dog, I'm recreating it.
743400	744400	Fuck it.
744400	746120	Sorry, Naomi.
746120	747920	Content warming transphobia.
747920	752240	She ratted out a trans sex worker to count Dankula for some reason.
752240	753880	Here's what happened.
753880	758960	A UK labor peer referring to trans women as creatures.
758960	759960	Never mind that shit.
759960	760960	What's her name?
760960	763680	It's for research.
763680	765080	So hold on, hold on.
765080	766680	It's it's problematic.
766680	771860	It's problematic if you put porn up and then somebody that you let's say you don't you
771860	774880	don't agree with politically decides to whack off to it.
774880	780600	What the what the fuck you call this ratting out a trans sex worker ratting out to what
780600	781600	end?
781600	782600	Cummies?
782600	783600	I wonder.
783600	784600	I think we'll get something for for Arch.
784600	792080	I mean, his his name starts with A. So it'd be like RCH something like that.
792080	793080	I don't know.
793080	795080	Let's see.
795080	797320	That doesn't seem like it.
797320	798720	Probably the same for V as well.
798720	799720	Like his name is too.
799720	801680	It's too short and it's too relatively normal.
801680	804280	And on the flip side of that, there's no way you're getting anything from my name.
804280	806280	Like what would it be?
806280	807280	S.H.
807280	813000	Or to for her to her to cool something like that.
813000	814000	Like, look at that.
814000	815600	There's no way of getting anything.
815600	817040	No, of course not.
817040	820000	Some of us are just uncensorable, I guess.
820000	825280	In fact, if you were to search for SFO, you would get stuff about the airport, the San
825280	826640	Francisco International Airport.
826640	832800	What's really funny is that Bad Bunny, yes, the the five dollars girl, five dollars a
832800	833800	month.
833800	834800	Yeah.
834800	835800	Her.
835800	839740	She does this for Destiny and Vash constantly, like half her Twitter account is about talking
839740	840740	about them.
840740	843680	And yet she censors their name every single time.
843680	848340	And to be honest, searching that censored version of Vash dredges up some of the funniest
848340	850820	leftist infighting stuff I've seen in a while.
850820	857700	Vash is definitely real chaser energy for for smacking his big manly penis against inferior
857700	858700	trans girl.
858700	862900	Oh, my God, dude, how does anybody take this guy seriously?
862900	865420	Y'all, I'm just never talking about Vash again.
865420	870220	I'm so fucking tired of getting well actually a dozen times every ask the most simplest,
870220	871740	most basic questions.
871740	872740	I don't care.
872740	876300	He's a fed.
876300	880820	He's so cringe when people say like his name is some kind of trigger word.
880820	885120	You normalize this stuff, you know, you already treat these trigger words seriously.
885120	887820	So on what grounds do you stand when you complain about this stuff?
887820	893260	I mean, it's public knowledge at this point that Vash engaged in some weird sexual harassment
893260	895620	slash grooming stuff years ago.
895620	900860	He's admitted on his own channel even if his victim decided to say Vash in this manner
900860	902500	with a censored letter.
902500	904020	How could you possibly object?
904020	908160	It sounds like you're just a Vash fan who doesn't like the fact that your favorite Internet
908160	910780	e-celeb is triggering.
910780	912380	We're back on Moviebob review.
912380	920540	So did Doug Walker, Doug Walker go full right wing to get his subs back up or is he an angry
920540	922420	post left bro now?
922420	924780	Doug Walker is he just a movie guy.
924780	925780	He's a nostalgia critic.
925780	929300	He's like the most milk toast of Internet people.
929300	931960	And he's the guy that you have to censor for a Moviebob.
931960	935360	Doug Walker left behind by the superior future.
935360	939360	It is awfully fucking weird how many people are chummy with Doug Walker at.
939360	940360	Okay.
940360	941360	Okay.
941360	943940	I thought it was just gonna be a Moviebob.
943940	945400	People are actually doing this one.
945400	947520	I remember seeing this back during the new guy thing.
947520	950520	I don't understand why stealing from rich people is bad.
950520	953760	Isn't it always morally correct to steal from the mega rich?
953760	958380	Like if Yulon Moles got a garage full of Telsa stone for him, I'd be laughing too.
958380	959680	But she says gamer bro.
959680	962360	If she's referring to someone like PewDiePie, well, he's racist as hell.
962360	965960	So this individual just seems to be a moral leper.
965960	969000	All right, let's do PewDiePie.
969000	970000	Here we go.
970000	971000	Yep.
971000	972000	Lots of nonsense.
972000	976600	Are you gonna next PewDiePie exclusive deal?
976600	981200	This all right, literally supports PewDiePie.
981200	983840	If you find PewDiePie attractive, you're not seeing heaven.
983840	984840	It's wild.
984840	986400	It's just this whole video.
986400	987400	It's been kind of nonsense.
987400	989760	To be honest, this probably isn't one of my greatest.
989760	994840	But the point is, is that they think either one, these names are actually trigger words.
994840	999540	Two, they think all these creators actually have the time or the care to name search themselves.
999540	1004120	Or three, they want to shit talk somebody online and not receive any kind of clap back
1004120	1005720	from people who disagree with them.
1005720	1007780	And so they make themselves a bit more unsearchable.
1007780	1008780	You know what?
1008780	1015360	For old time's sake, let's do gamer gate.
1015360	1018920	When you're trying to inform the FBI, the siege of Washington was actually the act of
1018920	1024520	a secret cabal of gamers to control the government called gamer gate, but they won't stop laughing.
1024520	1026120	This one is going to be more jokey than the others.
1026120	1027120	I'm pretty sure.
1027120	1028120	Oh, no, wait.
1028120	1029120	Nevermind.
1029120	1030120	Lindsay Ellis has taken it seriously.
1030120	1034200	I'm reminded of when gamer gate happened and Todd in the shadows wrote an article condemning
1034200	1035800	their movement.
1035800	1037680	And all of these dudes were like, man, I thought you were cool.
1037680	1041120	And his response was, where did I go wrong that you thought I'd agree with you?
1041120	1046100	Because as we've said before, you've all cultivated an edgy audience, and then you turned into
1046100	1047900	moral busybodies.
1047900	1052400	The craziest example of all, though, in my opinion, is Sophia Narwhits.
1052400	1055120	Now, Sophia Narwhits is a friend of mine.
1055120	1057240	She's a trans woman, a journalist, a streamer.
1057240	1061600	She did on the ground reporting in Minneapolis during the George Floyd riots, and she likes
1061600	1066680	to spend her spare time on Twitch playing the absolute worst fucking games that I've
1066680	1067680	ever seen.
1067680	1068960	You know what I got?
1068960	1072280	Let's do the feminist robot game.
1072280	1077280	Let's do can androids pray?
1077280	1085860	This is narrative experience about angry femme mech pilots at the end of the world.
1085860	1088920	And so we literally have Sophia derangement syndrome now.
1088920	1092400	I get the biggest erection when people are afraid to say my name.
1092400	1096920	I have a priori finished my next piece, which should come out on either the ninth or the
1096920	1097920	tenth.
1097920	1102920	It ties neatly into my Sophia Narwhits piece as a broader critique of the independent right-wing
1102920	1106740	media ecosystem as power-coddling bootlickers.
1106740	1108240	People know who Sophia Narwhits is.
1108240	1110280	I've never heard of A. Khaled.
1110280	1112280	Stop retweeting Sophia Narwhits.
1112280	1116700	She may be on the ground for the Minneapolis stuff, but she's a right-wing chud responsible
1116700	1119700	for endangering the lives of thousands of journalists.
1119700	1121920	She's more of a journalist than those thousands.
1121920	1124200	She's actually out there doing real reporting.
1124200	1126000	There are plenty of people documenting the protests.
1126000	1128480	You don't have to retweet Sophia Narwhits.
1128480	1131360	It won't stop her blowing up because not enough people know who she is, but at least folks
1131360	1133360	in the games industry just had to avoid it, you know?
1133360	1137760	Oh my God, this person is doing real work and they're being credited for it.
1137760	1140320	We need more trans people in gaming.
1140320	1142520	No not Sophia Narwhits.
1142520	1149060	This is kind of like how Larry Elder was the black face of white supremacy for a while.
1149060	1154400	If a majority of the content you create is reactionary outrage regarding McGame's journalism
1154400	1158160	instead of actual meaningful content about video games, then you don't have a say in
1158160	1160480	how people should go do their fucking job.
1160480	1166000	It costs zero dollars to mind your own business and not send hate mobs against marginalized
1166000	1167000	writers.
1167000	1172040	Sophia Narwhits and Colin Moriarty need to go outside for once in their miserable lives.
1172040	1173980	Isn't Sophia Narwhits the marginalized one?
1173980	1174980	She's trans.
1174980	1177920	Does she have like what people call passing privilege I guess?
1177920	1178920	So she doesn't count?
1178920	1180420	Like what's going on?
1180420	1185340	Young trans women like Sophia Narwhits still tweet about gamergate in the year 2021.
1185340	1189320	She's not as relevant as people like ContraPoints or Blaire White but she's equally annoying.
1189320	1193920	It honestly feels a bit like jealousy, like these people who are taking off, who are nonetheless
1193920	1197900	not approved by the progressive machinery, and all these other people are just angry
1197900	1198900	about it.
1198900	1202780	Thinking back on the time Sophia Narwhits shared a post from my little blog about how
1202780	1207820	Rage 2 does a lazy job aping features of real genetic disease in its monster designs, with
1207820	1212940	her chud audience and a bunch of boneheads trying to come for me, a PhD human geneticist.
1212940	1216620	This might have to be a video that I do, like a different video, but I've had this idea
1216620	1221960	floating around in my head for the idea of semi-privacy, which I think really just boils
1221960	1224320	down to wanting the entire world to be a safe space.
1224320	1230080	But what it is, is people who have small platforms, they post something public, and it is public,
1230080	1234660	but because they have such little reach, it feels private, and so when something that
1234660	1238580	they post blows up, and it blows up for, say, a bad reason, like they gave a really bad
1238580	1243100	take, or someone says, look how stupid this is, they're like, oh my god, my safe space
1243100	1246460	is being breached, how dare you come in here and ruin my day.
1246460	1248300	It's like you posted it publicly, dude.
1248300	1252520	Just because you're not used to having your dumb fucking takes noticed, doesn't mean that
1252520	1256560	suddenly your rights are being violated when somebody notices your dumb take finally.
1256560	1260660	I get the feeling that Sophia Narwhits is like what would have happened if Valerie Keefe
1260660	1265820	had mastered appealing to the far right through gaming and being the ultimate pick-me, a fee
1265820	1266820	MRA.
1266820	1272020	You gotta admit, pick-me-quizzling is a hell of a grift, or I mean look, hell of a look.
1272020	1277540	The whole pick-me thing is just wild, like, if you don't line up with their politics,
1277540	1281260	and yet you are not, you know, the straight white male, but you are part of a demographic
1281260	1284820	that they claim to speak for, then you're not a real person, you're a pick-me.
1284820	1287460	You're not doing it because this is what you want, or this is your temperament, or this
1287460	1290940	is your real politics, or your real views, or your real desires.
1290940	1295640	You're doing it because you want attention from the straight white men, and so you're
1295640	1296780	saying pick-me.
1296780	1301780	It's kind of amazing because these same people, back during when Gamergate was on, they decried
1301780	1303700	the whole idea of the fake gamer girl.
1303700	1306940	You know, the girl who doesn't actually play video games, but she poses with a controller
1306940	1310580	or something in her mouth, and then she says, look at me, silly boys, girls can video games
1310580	1311580	too.
1311580	1314100	And the actual nerds, the guys who, you know, were picked on for playing games when they
1314100	1317860	were a kid, because that was a thing when I was young, and got bullied by guys and girls
1317860	1321920	alike for it, those nerds looked at those gamer girls and said, look how fucking fake
1321920	1322920	you are.
1322920	1326100	This is just, this is just you trying to get attention, and sometimes it was, but also
1326100	1331060	sometimes real gamer girls, girls who actually played video games, they got lumped in, and
1331060	1333820	those guys said, you're just wanting attention, get the fuck out of here, which wasn't necessarily
1333820	1334820	the right thing to do.
1334820	1340180	But my point is, people on the left decried the nerds for doing that, and now they do
1340180	1341180	it.
1341180	1342180	They do it when they say pick me.
1342180	1343980	It's the same thing, but it's in reverse.
1343980	1348620	These people didn't actually change how they behave, they're still the fucking bullies,
1348620	1350900	they just change what team they play for.
1350900	1354380	There's so much more, it's kind of insane, and ironically all you have to do is just
1354380	1359540	go check out Sofia Naros's twitter, and it's just full of people who are losing their shit
1359540	1364980	because she is the person that she is, and it's always amusing to see people melt down
1364980	1369100	at somebody else's success, solely because they don't like the politics of the other
1369100	1370100	person.
1370100	1374180	How dare you be successful, how dare you have a life, how dare you even be around.
1374180	1378540	Anyway, this wasn't actually a serious video, it's me goofing around for a bit, having some
1378540	1379540	laughs.
1379540	1381820	I'm not going to take everything seriously, you know, I'm not that kind of guy.
1381820	1385660	I hope showing you some of the idiocy that's out there in the world, especially on twitter,
1385660	1388980	was at least worth the time for you, maybe you found it as funny as I did.
1388980	1393140	Thanks for watching, I'll be streaming some more at twitch.tv slash game boomers, and
1393140	1394940	I'll see you in the next video.
1394940	1396740	Thanks very much guys, I love you.
