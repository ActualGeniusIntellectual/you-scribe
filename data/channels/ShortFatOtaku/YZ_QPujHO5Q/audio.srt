1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,300
Tangentially related to the whole trigger warning thing is using an asterisk to censor

2
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:14,620
a name, generally by replacing the first vowel with the asterisk.

3
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:16,160
It looks something like this.

4
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:20,360
Trigger warning, sexual assault, rape, and murder, with various letters being censored.

5
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:21,960
I'm sure you've noticed this before.

6
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:25,160
And yeah, this is pretty messed up, isn't it?

7
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:26,160
Jesus.

8
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:27,160
It is.

9
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:30,160
It goes hand in hand with trigger warnings, simply as part of the warning.

10
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:35,880
So you don't have to be even further triggered by looking at the full word of murder or rape.

11
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:40,940
Now what this actually comes from is a website called Atsizklar.com, I think it's pronounced.

12
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:43,120
I don't know, it's Turkish and I can't pronounce any of that.

13
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:48,080
But it was a Turkish ultra nationalist website, kind of like stormfront.org, but for Turkish

14
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:49,080
people.

15
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:55,040
Back in 2009, the admins of that forum wanted to censor debates about Kurdish people.

16
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:56,920
So they set up a filter on their forums.

17
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:59,260
You couldn't post Kurd or Kurdish.

18
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:04,680
To bypass this, people started to put an asterisk in place of the U in Kurd.

19
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:08,700
And eventually that form of Kurd began to be used as an insult.

20
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:12,880
This floated around the Turkish internet for a while, but around 2012, I remember seeing

21
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:17,400
it on some more obscure sites like 4chan or other smaller message boards.

22
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:20,240
By 2017, it had broken into the English mainstream.

23
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:21,960
And now you see it all the time like this.

24
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:22,960
Wake up.

25
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:23,960
Still not British.

26
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:25,640
It basically improves noticeably.

27
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:31,560
It started as slang terminology to disparagingly refer to people of different ethnic or national

28
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:32,560
origins.

29
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:36,520
But when it crossed the language barrier and jumped over to the English side of the internet,

30
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:41,940
because of the asterisks already heavy use in censorship, the two uses combined and became

31
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:44,300
their own very strange phenomenon.

32
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:49,800
The combination of censorship as well as adding the ethnic or group identity element basically

33
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:54,080
made the asterisk a perfect pairing with stuff like trigger warnings, which is why

34
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,640
you get messages like this.

35
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:56,640
Trigger warning.

36
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:57,640
Misogyny.

37
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:58,640
Incels.

38
00:01:58,640 --> 00:01:59,640
Murder.

39
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:00,860
I recently proposed to our project manager of introducing performance metrics to keep

40
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:01,860
our developers in check.

41
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:05,440
We will collect the data and use it to determine whether employee productivity is up.

42
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:10,200
This absolute incel, with a censored E of course, emailed me this bigoted message.

43
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:12,240
I have submitted to HR his threatening response.

44
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:16,720
And the message was just basically, implement this and I will kill you.

45
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:20,520
I mean, I can see how that can be taken as a joke, but you know what?

46
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:22,800
You're working in a professional environment, maybe you should cool it.

47
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,840
But nonetheless, incel is censored.

48
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:26,880
Yeah, I'm kind of curious actually.

49
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:35,200
What if we did something like, I N C asterisks L and search for that specific, what do we

50
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,200
get?

51
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:39,100
What is it with men making group chats about women they don't like?

52
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:40,260
Incel behavior.

53
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:43,160
Men of means don't do, wait, women do this about men.

54
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,160
Jesus.

55
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:48,320
This is gonna make me sound like an incel, but VTubers don't make me, why are you censoring

56
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:49,320
incel?

57
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:51,240
There's no, oh, it's because, oh, oh, okay.

58
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:55,880
I'm looking forward to an incel revolution when they have the first female bond.

59
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:58,640
There's no way these people, these random ass people are triggered.

60
00:02:58,640 --> 00:02:59,640
I mean, maybe.

61
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:01,360
Why do they feel the need to do this?

62
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,360
All right, let's try murder.

63
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,480
M asterisks R D E R.

64
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:08,720
Yeah, when it comes to murder, these seem to be more like jokey, right?

65
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:11,000
Like they're kind of in on the joke, they get it.

66
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Fair enough.

67
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,960
How about rape?

68
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:19,420
Why slut shaming contributes to rape culture, enthusiastic consent and sex positively are

69
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:20,720
widely undesirable.

70
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:24,420
I'm just gonna, I'm just gonna, I'm not gonna listen to your nonsense, but how soft do you

71
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:28,840
have to be to censor the word rape when talking about rape culture?

72
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:32,480
The superintendent looked the father in the eye and said that not only did the rape not

73
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,760
happen, but the student did not exist.

74
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:39,840
The sheriff's department found and charged the student with two counts of forcible, why

75
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:42,900
are you censoring sodomy?

76
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:45,440
Sometimes it's hard to tell whether it's a joke or not, but eventually it does become

77
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,440
rather ridiculous.

78
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:47,440
Doesn't it?

79
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,840
I understand that doctors are including obesity.

80
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:53,600
There's the censored one, obesity as an underlying medical condition that late, that leads to

81
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:54,920
death in COVID patients.

82
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:58,760
Do these doctors have any idea what kind of impact this has on families to be told that

83
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:02,040
their loved one's body shape is partly to blame for their death?

84
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:03,540
It's true though, isn't it?

85
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:09,760
Do you have any idea what kind of impact being told that being fat has negative health consequences?

86
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:13,520
This is, I can't believe that I'm seeing this stuff.

87
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:15,620
Nobody can be told anything negative now.

88
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:16,960
These are all spoiled children.

89
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:20,200
Give me one good reason for recording fatness as a cause of death.

90
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:25,840
Well, how about if you're so fat that your heart can no longer beat because it's encased

91
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:29,640
in a globe of fat and it just can't move anymore.

92
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:32,280
Imagine being so triggered by the word obesity that you have to censor it.

93
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:33,280
It's fucking wild, isn't it?

94
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:37,280
Remember when the fragile white, there's, I guess there, I don't know why they're sensing

95
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:46,580
fragile, but white, fragile white men made these stupid, is stupid a slur that needs

96
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:51,320
to be censored?

97
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:52,320
You know what?

98
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:58,440
I think, I think the next, the next frontier and all of this stuff will be like intelligence-ist.

99
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:02,320
If you're too smart, you're too privileged and we need to equalize you with all the dumb

100
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,320
people.

101
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:07,680
This is all fun and games, but this tendency of using the asterisk in this way actually

102
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:13,000
took a swerve at one point where they began using it on like real events or real people's

103
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
names.

104
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:20,480
As if talking about somebody, just referencing that they exist as a human is just too triggering.

105
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:22,240
You can't, you can't do it in public.

106
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,280
Content warning, trigger warning, hi, hi.

107
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:25,280
Just a heads up.

108
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:32,160
If you see Jake Paul, Jake Paul pop up on your feeds, it's probably about sexual assault

109
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,580
and human trafficking.

110
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:39,560
So please be careful when reading, dude, never drive a vehicle ever again.

111
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:44,480
I'm not going to comment on JK Rowling's new book other than that the portag's ridiculous

112
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:46,000
name makes me laugh every time I see it.

113
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
That's right.

114
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,380
JK Rowling went from like the progressive darling to persona non grata, progressive

115
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:52,380
non grata.

116
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:59,200
Here, let's see if I can like do this, you know, search Rowling.

117
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:02,540
I know this is nothing new, but I go through phases where I'm reminded how deeply hurt

118
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:05,200
I am by JK Rowling and I can't let it go.

119
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:09,260
I am so angry with the fact that I can't look or think about Harry Potter without getting

120
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:11,520
incredibly sad or feeling so betrayed.

121
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:15,440
I wonder how they would react if they like walk by a bookstore and there's like a sign

122
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:19,000
for like a new book or something and it says by JK Rowling.

123
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Do they have seizures?

124
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,040
Do they just start like shaking on the ground?

125
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:24,640
Turfs can have Rowling and Chappelle.

126
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:27,080
I'm going to have to do a video on this Chappelle thing, aren't I?

127
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:31,040
It just keeps blowing up with the Netflix walkouts and stuff breaking white feminist

128
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:38,200
queen Margaret Atwood joins the ranks of JK and who I can't even tell who this person

129
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,600
is.

130
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:44,120
I can't recognize who is this person with these with these sensors.

131
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,240
I can't even look it up.

132
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:49,360
In fact, the whole can't even look it up seems to be the purpose of some of this.

133
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:54,140
The use of asterisks in this way eventually transitioned not only to show how the person

134
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:59,260
that you're talking about is they who must not be named, ironically enough, but also

135
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:04,740
because a lot of these people, especially if they're on Twitter, they think that these

136
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:09,780
larger known figures, these public figures, these creators sometimes that they name search

137
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:10,780
themselves.

138
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:13,220
And I'm sure people name search themselves at least once in a while.

139
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:16,980
You know, I might do it like once a year or something instead of curiosity.

140
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:22,520
But most people who are too busy doing their own thing, not spending all this time on Twitter

141
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:23,960
on Google name searching themselves.

142
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:28,560
They're not like reading their own Kiwi Farms threads or something, except shoe on head.

143
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:33,800
She does actually do that, but just called the TCU PD to report the large social gathering

144
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:38,760
caused by Steven Crowder and they told me that TCU gave him a permit to be there.

145
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:40,480
They can't do anything else.

146
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:46,080
Like do you think Steven Crowder just sits up at night searching for his name on Twitter

147
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:49,480
and you do this so that he won't notice that you're being critical of him in public?

148
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:53,720
Like it's either that or you genuinely think that the name Steven Crowder is triggering.

149
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:54,800
It's one of the two.

150
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:57,000
So I guess pick which way that you're going to be stupid then.

151
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
All right.

152
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
All right.

153
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I got to see how far some of this goes.

154
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Okay.

155
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Let's try out Sargon.

156
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:07,900
Do you think it would be, I think it would be the, the A that gets censored or the O.

157
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:09,600
Let's try the A first.

158
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:14,360
That video of Sargon reacting to the don't say the R slur PSA by perpetuating repeating

159
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:17,280
every slur in the video and angrily shouting, who the fuck do you think you are?

160
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:21,040
My mom tells you exactly at which stage of the development his brain got stuck on.

161
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,040
What stage do you mean?

162
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:25,520
You mean the stage that you don't want to be told by some fucking nanny what to do?

163
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:26,520
I don't know, dude.

164
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:30,480
You sound kind of like a retard when you see a decent long play YouTube channel that likes

165
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:32,120
and follow Sargon of a kid.

166
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:37,760
I, uh, I'm not going to name any names, but at this point I know a number of very large

167
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:40,080
gaming YouTubers who watch my content.

168
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:44,120
Hi guys, by the way, people who are way past the 1 million sub Mark, not going to reveal

169
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:46,120
who they are, but yeah.

170
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:52,560
If you have a favorite gaming channel on YouTube, they're probably watching antisocialist content

171
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:53,560
and good.

172
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:55,680
I can hear my dad listening to Sargon.

173
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,360
You didn't even censor it properly.

174
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:01,760
And also, I guess he wants to learn about the tenants of dadism since he has a dad after

175
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:02,760
all.

176
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:03,760
This is back in 2016.

177
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,000
They've been doing this for a while.

178
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Sargon fans are upset that gray bloke is an anti-feminist Nazi now, not politically incorrect

179
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,680
like he supposedly was before.

180
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:16,880
You go back to like a lot of, a lot of YouTubers from like 2010, 2011, 2012, all of them said

181
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:20,120
stuff like retard and faggot, all of them.

182
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:24,400
Even people who are squeaky clean now, like Veritasium, it makes every single person at

183
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:27,320
interviews look like a complete retard or Vsauce.

184
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:36,800
Wonder woman, Wonder woman, Wonder woman, Wonder woman, Wonder woman, Wonder woman,

185
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:40,800
Wonder woman, Wonder woman, Wonder woman, Wonder woman, Wonder woman, Wonder woman,

186
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:45,920
Wonder woman, Wonder woman, Wonder woman, Wonder woman, Wonder woman, Wonder woman,

187
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:46,920
Wonder woman, Wonder woman, Wonder woman, Wonder woman, Wonder woman, Wonder woman,

188
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:47,920
Wonder woman, Wonder woman, Wonder woman, Wonder woman, Wonder woman, Wonder woman,

189
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:48,920
Wonder woman, Wonder woman, Wonder woman, Wonder woman, Wonder woman, Wonder woman,

190
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:49,920
Wonder woman, Wonder woman, Wonder woman, Wonder woman, Wonder woman, Wonder woman,

191
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:50,920
Wonder woman, Wonder woman, Wonder woman, Wonder woman, Wonder woman, Wonder woman,

192
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:51,920
Wonder woman, Wonder woman, Wonder woman, Wonder woman, Wonder woman, Wonder woman,

193
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:52,920
Wonder woman, Wonder woman, Wonder woman, Wonder woman, Wonder woman, Wonder woman,

194
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:53,920
Wonder woman, Wonder woman, Wonder woman, Wonder woman, Wonder woman, Wonder woman,

195
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:54,920
Wonder woman, Wonder woman, Wonder woman, Wonder woman, Wonder woman, Wonder woman,

196
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:55,920
Wonder woman, Wonder woman, Wonder woman, Wonder woman, Wonder woman, Wonder woman,

197
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:56,920
Wait, really?

198
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:58,960
Like, no, no, they're not.

199
00:09:58,960 --> 00:09:59,960
You can fuck around.

200
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:00,960
You can make jokes.

201
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:03,880
You can be not serious sometimes.

202
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:06,280
You can engage in banter and still be a good person.

203
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:10,480
I feel like I'm unearthing hidden gems by searching for people's names like this.

204
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:11,480
Let's try something else.

205
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:17,880
Why don't we try, um, let's try Ben Shapiro, let's just do Shapiro, do something like that.

206
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:18,880
Let's try it.

207
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:19,880
What do we get?

208
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:24,000
Oh God, Kyle Calagren, that guy with the glasses leftover, just had a minor heart attack seeing

209
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,680
the name of the actress playing Dorothy.

210
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:28,080
It's not Ben Shapiro's sister, they just have the same name.

211
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:31,120
Imagine having a heart attack because the sister of a political pundit that you don't

212
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:34,200
like might have a public facing job.

213
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,200
Fucking unreal.

214
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,360
These people are soft, dude.

215
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:37,620
Someone please come and shoot me.

216
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:41,960
My older brother's listening to Ben Shapiro's review of the Squid Game at 1.5 times speed

217
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:42,960
at full volume.

218
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:43,960
Based!

219
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:46,680
But listen, though, he's not, he's not at Giga child levels yet.

220
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:48,200
You have to watch it at two times speed.

221
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:52,240
My new hobby is censoring the names of people I don't like, like Ben Shapiro.

222
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:55,880
I think it's so funny for no reason.

223
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:57,880
Me too, buddy.

224
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:00,320
Alright, let's try Dankula.

225
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:04,200
Think we got something for Dankula?

226
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:08,240
The absolute shock of seeing someone retweet Dankula onto my timeline.

227
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,040
Been a while since I had to unfollow manually.

228
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:11,840
Yeah, it's, it's rough, isn't it?

229
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:16,520
To see his wholesome takes about his child and his wife, maybe some free speech stuff.

230
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:19,800
Every once in a while, that picture of his balls with like a smiley face on them.

231
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:23,680
If I hadn't done the tweet that Count Dankula replied to, would he have replied to somebody

232
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:24,920
else instead with the same thing?

233
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:26,360
Am I taking one for the team?

234
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:30,440
Or have my actions inadvertently caused more fascist bullshit to be in the world than there

235
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,640
would have been otherwise?

236
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:34,560
This is your brain on pure consequentialist ethics, guys.

237
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:37,720
Oh my god, I said something that an undesirable touched.

238
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:40,660
I need to sit here for the next six hours and calculate this shit out.

239
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:44,040
My face when I block all the weird Dankula fanboys amendments.

240
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:47,040
Hold on a minute.

241
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,400
What?

242
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:50,760
You're white.

243
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:52,320
You're fucking white, dude.

244
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:55,040
What is this digital ass black face you're engaging in here?

245
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,600
Get the fuck out of here.

246
00:11:56,600 --> 00:12:00,240
I see Dankula is complaining cancel culture is stopping him from ever getting a normal

247
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,240
job.

248
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:02,240
It's all the mean lefty's fault.

249
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:06,960
Nothing to do with the idea nobody would want to employ an unwashed cunt who's very public,

250
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:10,880
unapologetic, racist, misogynist bullshit landed him in court.

251
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:15,400
You mean teaching a dog how to salute?

252
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:16,520
How to do the Nazi salute?

253
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:19,120
Like, is that what we're talking about?

254
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,120
You know what?

255
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:21,120
Fuck it.

256
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,120
I'm going to recreate that.

257
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:23,400
As soon as I get a dog, I'm recreating it.

258
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:24,400
Fuck it.

259
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:26,120
Sorry, Naomi.

260
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,920
Content warming transphobia.

261
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:32,240
She ratted out a trans sex worker to count Dankula for some reason.

262
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,880
Here's what happened.

263
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:38,960
A UK labor peer referring to trans women as creatures.

264
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:39,960
Never mind that shit.

265
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:40,960
What's her name?

266
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:43,680
It's for research.

267
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,080
So hold on, hold on.

268
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:46,680
It's it's problematic.

269
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:51,860
It's problematic if you put porn up and then somebody that you let's say you don't you

270
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:54,880
don't agree with politically decides to whack off to it.

271
00:12:54,880 --> 00:13:00,600
What the what the fuck you call this ratting out a trans sex worker ratting out to what

272
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:01,600
end?

273
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:02,600
Cummies?

274
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:03,600
I wonder.

275
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:04,600
I think we'll get something for for Arch.

276
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:12,080
I mean, his his name starts with A. So it'd be like RCH something like that.

277
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:13,080
I don't know.

278
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:15,080
Let's see.

279
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:17,320
That doesn't seem like it.

280
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:18,720
Probably the same for V as well.

281
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:19,720
Like his name is too.

282
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:21,680
It's too short and it's too relatively normal.

283
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:24,280
And on the flip side of that, there's no way you're getting anything from my name.

284
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:26,280
Like what would it be?

285
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:27,280
S.H.

286
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:33,000
Or to for her to her to cool something like that.

287
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Like, look at that.

288
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,600
There's no way of getting anything.

289
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,040
No, of course not.

290
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:40,000
Some of us are just uncensorable, I guess.

291
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:45,280
In fact, if you were to search for SFO, you would get stuff about the airport, the San

292
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:46,640
Francisco International Airport.

293
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:52,800
What's really funny is that Bad Bunny, yes, the the five dollars girl, five dollars a

294
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:53,800
month.

295
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:54,800
Yeah.

296
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:55,800
Her.

297
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:59,740
She does this for Destiny and Vash constantly, like half her Twitter account is about talking

298
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:00,740
about them.

299
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:03,680
And yet she censors their name every single time.

300
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:08,340
And to be honest, searching that censored version of Vash dredges up some of the funniest

301
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:10,820
leftist infighting stuff I've seen in a while.

302
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:17,700
Vash is definitely real chaser energy for for smacking his big manly penis against inferior

303
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:18,700
trans girl.

304
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:22,900
Oh, my God, dude, how does anybody take this guy seriously?

305
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:25,420
Y'all, I'm just never talking about Vash again.

306
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:30,220
I'm so fucking tired of getting well actually a dozen times every ask the most simplest,

307
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:31,740
most basic questions.

308
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:32,740
I don't care.

309
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:36,300
He's a fed.

310
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:40,820
He's so cringe when people say like his name is some kind of trigger word.

311
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:45,120
You normalize this stuff, you know, you already treat these trigger words seriously.

312
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,820
So on what grounds do you stand when you complain about this stuff?

313
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:53,260
I mean, it's public knowledge at this point that Vash engaged in some weird sexual harassment

314
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:55,620
slash grooming stuff years ago.

315
00:14:55,620 --> 00:15:00,860
He's admitted on his own channel even if his victim decided to say Vash in this manner

316
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:02,500
with a censored letter.

317
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:04,020
How could you possibly object?

318
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:08,160
It sounds like you're just a Vash fan who doesn't like the fact that your favorite Internet

319
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:10,780
e-celeb is triggering.

320
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:12,380
We're back on Moviebob review.

321
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:20,540
So did Doug Walker, Doug Walker go full right wing to get his subs back up or is he an angry

322
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:22,420
post left bro now?

323
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:24,780
Doug Walker is he just a movie guy.

324
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:25,780
He's a nostalgia critic.

325
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:29,300
He's like the most milk toast of Internet people.

326
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:31,960
And he's the guy that you have to censor for a Moviebob.

327
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:35,360
Doug Walker left behind by the superior future.

328
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:39,360
It is awfully fucking weird how many people are chummy with Doug Walker at.

329
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:40,360
Okay.

330
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:41,360
Okay.

331
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:43,940
I thought it was just gonna be a Moviebob.

332
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:45,400
People are actually doing this one.

333
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:47,520
I remember seeing this back during the new guy thing.

334
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:50,520
I don't understand why stealing from rich people is bad.

335
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:53,760
Isn't it always morally correct to steal from the mega rich?

336
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:58,380
Like if Yulon Moles got a garage full of Telsa stone for him, I'd be laughing too.

337
00:15:58,380 --> 00:15:59,680
But she says gamer bro.

338
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:02,360
If she's referring to someone like PewDiePie, well, he's racist as hell.

339
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:05,960
So this individual just seems to be a moral leper.

340
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:09,000
All right, let's do PewDiePie.

341
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Here we go.

342
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Yep.

343
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Lots of nonsense.

344
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,600
Are you gonna next PewDiePie exclusive deal?

345
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:21,200
This all right, literally supports PewDiePie.

346
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:23,840
If you find PewDiePie attractive, you're not seeing heaven.

347
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:24,840
It's wild.

348
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:26,400
It's just this whole video.

349
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:27,400
It's been kind of nonsense.

350
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:29,760
To be honest, this probably isn't one of my greatest.

351
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:34,840
But the point is, is that they think either one, these names are actually trigger words.

352
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:39,540
Two, they think all these creators actually have the time or the care to name search themselves.

353
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:44,120
Or three, they want to shit talk somebody online and not receive any kind of clap back

354
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:45,720
from people who disagree with them.

355
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:47,780
And so they make themselves a bit more unsearchable.

356
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:48,780
You know what?

357
00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:55,360
For old time's sake, let's do gamer gate.

358
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:58,920
When you're trying to inform the FBI, the siege of Washington was actually the act of

359
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:04,520
a secret cabal of gamers to control the government called gamer gate, but they won't stop laughing.

360
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:06,120
This one is going to be more jokey than the others.

361
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:07,120
I'm pretty sure.

362
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:08,120
Oh, no, wait.

363
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:09,120
Nevermind.

364
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:10,120
Lindsay Ellis has taken it seriously.

365
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:14,200
I'm reminded of when gamer gate happened and Todd in the shadows wrote an article condemning

366
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,800
their movement.

367
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:17,680
And all of these dudes were like, man, I thought you were cool.

368
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:21,120
And his response was, where did I go wrong that you thought I'd agree with you?

369
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:26,100
Because as we've said before, you've all cultivated an edgy audience, and then you turned into

370
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:27,900
moral busybodies.

371
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:32,400
The craziest example of all, though, in my opinion, is Sophia Narwhits.

372
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:35,120
Now, Sophia Narwhits is a friend of mine.

373
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:37,240
She's a trans woman, a journalist, a streamer.

374
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:41,600
She did on the ground reporting in Minneapolis during the George Floyd riots, and she likes

375
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:46,680
to spend her spare time on Twitch playing the absolute worst fucking games that I've

376
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:47,680
ever seen.

377
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:48,960
You know what I got?

378
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:52,280
Let's do the feminist robot game.

379
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:57,280
Let's do can androids pray?

380
00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:05,860
This is narrative experience about angry femme mech pilots at the end of the world.

381
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:08,920
And so we literally have Sophia derangement syndrome now.

382
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:12,400
I get the biggest erection when people are afraid to say my name.

383
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:16,920
I have a priori finished my next piece, which should come out on either the ninth or the

384
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:17,920
tenth.

385
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:22,920
It ties neatly into my Sophia Narwhits piece as a broader critique of the independent right-wing

386
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:26,740
media ecosystem as power-coddling bootlickers.

387
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:28,240
People know who Sophia Narwhits is.

388
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,280
I've never heard of A. Khaled.

389
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:32,280
Stop retweeting Sophia Narwhits.

390
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:36,700
She may be on the ground for the Minneapolis stuff, but she's a right-wing chud responsible

391
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:39,700
for endangering the lives of thousands of journalists.

392
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:41,920
She's more of a journalist than those thousands.

393
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:44,200
She's actually out there doing real reporting.

394
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:46,000
There are plenty of people documenting the protests.

395
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,480
You don't have to retweet Sophia Narwhits.

396
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:51,360
It won't stop her blowing up because not enough people know who she is, but at least folks

397
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:53,360
in the games industry just had to avoid it, you know?

398
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:57,760
Oh my God, this person is doing real work and they're being credited for it.

399
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:00,320
We need more trans people in gaming.

400
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:02,520
No not Sophia Narwhits.

401
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:09,060
This is kind of like how Larry Elder was the black face of white supremacy for a while.

402
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:14,400
If a majority of the content you create is reactionary outrage regarding McGame's journalism

403
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:18,160
instead of actual meaningful content about video games, then you don't have a say in

404
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:20,480
how people should go do their fucking job.

405
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:26,000
It costs zero dollars to mind your own business and not send hate mobs against marginalized

406
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
writers.

407
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:32,040
Sophia Narwhits and Colin Moriarty need to go outside for once in their miserable lives.

408
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:33,980
Isn't Sophia Narwhits the marginalized one?

409
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:34,980
She's trans.

410
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:37,920
Does she have like what people call passing privilege I guess?

411
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:38,920
So she doesn't count?

412
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:40,420
Like what's going on?

413
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:45,340
Young trans women like Sophia Narwhits still tweet about gamergate in the year 2021.

414
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:49,320
She's not as relevant as people like ContraPoints or Blaire White but she's equally annoying.

415
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:53,920
It honestly feels a bit like jealousy, like these people who are taking off, who are nonetheless

416
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:57,900
not approved by the progressive machinery, and all these other people are just angry

417
00:19:57,900 --> 00:19:58,900
about it.

418
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:02,780
Thinking back on the time Sophia Narwhits shared a post from my little blog about how

419
00:20:02,780 --> 00:20:07,820
Rage 2 does a lazy job aping features of real genetic disease in its monster designs, with

420
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:12,940
her chud audience and a bunch of boneheads trying to come for me, a PhD human geneticist.

421
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:16,620
This might have to be a video that I do, like a different video, but I've had this idea

422
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:21,960
floating around in my head for the idea of semi-privacy, which I think really just boils

423
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:24,320
down to wanting the entire world to be a safe space.

424
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:30,080
But what it is, is people who have small platforms, they post something public, and it is public,

425
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:34,660
but because they have such little reach, it feels private, and so when something that

426
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:38,580
they post blows up, and it blows up for, say, a bad reason, like they gave a really bad

427
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:43,100
take, or someone says, look how stupid this is, they're like, oh my god, my safe space

428
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:46,460
is being breached, how dare you come in here and ruin my day.

429
00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:48,300
It's like you posted it publicly, dude.

430
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:52,520
Just because you're not used to having your dumb fucking takes noticed, doesn't mean that

431
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:56,560
suddenly your rights are being violated when somebody notices your dumb take finally.

432
00:20:56,560 --> 00:21:00,660
I get the feeling that Sophia Narwhits is like what would have happened if Valerie Keefe

433
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:05,820
had mastered appealing to the far right through gaming and being the ultimate pick-me, a fee

434
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:06,820
MRA.

435
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:12,020
You gotta admit, pick-me-quizzling is a hell of a grift, or I mean look, hell of a look.

436
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:17,540
The whole pick-me thing is just wild, like, if you don't line up with their politics,

437
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:21,260
and yet you are not, you know, the straight white male, but you are part of a demographic

438
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:24,820
that they claim to speak for, then you're not a real person, you're a pick-me.

439
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:27,460
You're not doing it because this is what you want, or this is your temperament, or this

440
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:30,940
is your real politics, or your real views, or your real desires.

441
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:35,640
You're doing it because you want attention from the straight white men, and so you're

442
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:36,780
saying pick-me.

443
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:41,780
It's kind of amazing because these same people, back during when Gamergate was on, they decried

444
00:21:41,780 --> 00:21:43,700
the whole idea of the fake gamer girl.

445
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:46,940
You know, the girl who doesn't actually play video games, but she poses with a controller

446
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:50,580
or something in her mouth, and then she says, look at me, silly boys, girls can video games

447
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:51,580
too.

448
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:54,100
And the actual nerds, the guys who, you know, were picked on for playing games when they

449
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:57,860
were a kid, because that was a thing when I was young, and got bullied by guys and girls

450
00:21:57,860 --> 00:22:01,920
alike for it, those nerds looked at those gamer girls and said, look how fucking fake

451
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:02,920
you are.

452
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:06,100
This is just, this is just you trying to get attention, and sometimes it was, but also

453
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:11,060
sometimes real gamer girls, girls who actually played video games, they got lumped in, and

454
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:13,820
those guys said, you're just wanting attention, get the fuck out of here, which wasn't necessarily

455
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:14,820
the right thing to do.

456
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:20,180
But my point is, people on the left decried the nerds for doing that, and now they do

457
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:21,180
it.

458
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:22,180
They do it when they say pick me.

459
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:23,980
It's the same thing, but it's in reverse.

460
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:28,620
These people didn't actually change how they behave, they're still the fucking bullies,

461
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:30,900
they just change what team they play for.

462
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:34,380
There's so much more, it's kind of insane, and ironically all you have to do is just

463
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:39,540
go check out Sofia Naros's twitter, and it's just full of people who are losing their shit

464
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:44,980
because she is the person that she is, and it's always amusing to see people melt down

465
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:49,100
at somebody else's success, solely because they don't like the politics of the other

466
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:50,100
person.

467
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:54,180
How dare you be successful, how dare you have a life, how dare you even be around.

468
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:58,540
Anyway, this wasn't actually a serious video, it's me goofing around for a bit, having some

469
00:22:58,540 --> 00:22:59,540
laughs.

470
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:01,820
I'm not going to take everything seriously, you know, I'm not that kind of guy.

471
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:05,660
I hope showing you some of the idiocy that's out there in the world, especially on twitter,

472
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:08,980
was at least worth the time for you, maybe you found it as funny as I did.

473
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:13,140
Thanks for watching, I'll be streaming some more at twitch.tv slash game boomers, and

474
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:14,940
I'll see you in the next video.

475
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:16,740
Thanks very much guys, I love you.
