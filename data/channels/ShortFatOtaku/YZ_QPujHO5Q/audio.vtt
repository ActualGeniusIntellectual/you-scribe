00:00.000 --> 00:10.300
Tangentially related to the whole trigger warning thing is using an asterisk to censor

00:10.300 --> 00:14.620
a name, generally by replacing the first vowel with the asterisk.

00:14.620 --> 00:16.160
It looks something like this.

00:16.160 --> 00:20.360
Trigger warning, sexual assault, rape, and murder, with various letters being censored.

00:20.360 --> 00:21.960
I'm sure you've noticed this before.

00:21.960 --> 00:25.160
And yeah, this is pretty messed up, isn't it?

00:25.160 --> 00:26.160
Jesus.

00:26.160 --> 00:27.160
It is.

00:27.160 --> 00:30.160
It goes hand in hand with trigger warnings, simply as part of the warning.

00:30.160 --> 00:35.880
So you don't have to be even further triggered by looking at the full word of murder or rape.

00:35.880 --> 00:40.940
Now what this actually comes from is a website called Atsizklar.com, I think it's pronounced.

00:40.940 --> 00:43.120
I don't know, it's Turkish and I can't pronounce any of that.

00:43.120 --> 00:48.080
But it was a Turkish ultra nationalist website, kind of like stormfront.org, but for Turkish

00:48.080 --> 00:49.080
people.

00:49.080 --> 00:55.040
Back in 2009, the admins of that forum wanted to censor debates about Kurdish people.

00:55.040 --> 00:56.920
So they set up a filter on their forums.

00:56.920 --> 00:59.260
You couldn't post Kurd or Kurdish.

00:59.260 --> 01:04.680
To bypass this, people started to put an asterisk in place of the U in Kurd.

01:04.680 --> 01:08.700
And eventually that form of Kurd began to be used as an insult.

01:08.700 --> 01:12.880
This floated around the Turkish internet for a while, but around 2012, I remember seeing

01:12.880 --> 01:17.400
it on some more obscure sites like 4chan or other smaller message boards.

01:17.400 --> 01:20.240
By 2017, it had broken into the English mainstream.

01:20.240 --> 01:21.960
And now you see it all the time like this.

01:21.960 --> 01:22.960
Wake up.

01:22.960 --> 01:23.960
Still not British.

01:23.960 --> 01:25.640
It basically improves noticeably.

01:25.640 --> 01:31.560
It started as slang terminology to disparagingly refer to people of different ethnic or national

01:31.560 --> 01:32.560
origins.

01:32.560 --> 01:36.520
But when it crossed the language barrier and jumped over to the English side of the internet,

01:36.520 --> 01:41.940
because of the asterisks already heavy use in censorship, the two uses combined and became

01:41.940 --> 01:44.300
their own very strange phenomenon.

01:44.300 --> 01:49.800
The combination of censorship as well as adding the ethnic or group identity element basically

01:49.800 --> 01:54.080
made the asterisk a perfect pairing with stuff like trigger warnings, which is why

01:54.080 --> 01:55.640
you get messages like this.

01:55.640 --> 01:56.640
Trigger warning.

01:56.640 --> 01:57.640
Misogyny.

01:57.640 --> 01:58.640
Incels.

01:58.640 --> 01:59.640
Murder.

01:59.640 --> 02:00.860
I recently proposed to our project manager of introducing performance metrics to keep

02:00.860 --> 02:01.860
our developers in check.

02:01.860 --> 02:05.440
We will collect the data and use it to determine whether employee productivity is up.

02:05.440 --> 02:10.200
This absolute incel, with a censored E of course, emailed me this bigoted message.

02:10.200 --> 02:12.240
I have submitted to HR his threatening response.

02:12.240 --> 02:16.720
And the message was just basically, implement this and I will kill you.

02:16.720 --> 02:20.520
I mean, I can see how that can be taken as a joke, but you know what?

02:20.520 --> 02:22.800
You're working in a professional environment, maybe you should cool it.

02:22.800 --> 02:24.840
But nonetheless, incel is censored.

02:24.840 --> 02:26.880
Yeah, I'm kind of curious actually.

02:26.880 --> 02:35.200
What if we did something like, I N C asterisks L and search for that specific, what do we

02:35.200 --> 02:36.200
get?

02:36.200 --> 02:39.100
What is it with men making group chats about women they don't like?

02:39.100 --> 02:40.260
Incel behavior.

02:40.260 --> 02:43.160
Men of means don't do, wait, women do this about men.

02:43.160 --> 02:44.160
Jesus.

02:44.160 --> 02:48.320
This is gonna make me sound like an incel, but VTubers don't make me, why are you censoring

02:48.320 --> 02:49.320
incel?

02:49.320 --> 02:51.240
There's no, oh, it's because, oh, oh, okay.

02:51.240 --> 02:55.880
I'm looking forward to an incel revolution when they have the first female bond.

02:55.880 --> 02:58.640
There's no way these people, these random ass people are triggered.

02:58.640 --> 02:59.640
I mean, maybe.

02:59.640 --> 03:01.360
Why do they feel the need to do this?

03:01.360 --> 03:03.360
All right, let's try murder.

03:03.360 --> 03:05.480
M asterisks R D E R.

03:05.480 --> 03:08.720
Yeah, when it comes to murder, these seem to be more like jokey, right?

03:08.720 --> 03:11.000
Like they're kind of in on the joke, they get it.

03:11.000 --> 03:12.000
Fair enough.

03:12.000 --> 03:14.960
How about rape?

03:14.960 --> 03:19.420
Why slut shaming contributes to rape culture, enthusiastic consent and sex positively are

03:19.420 --> 03:20.720
widely undesirable.

03:20.720 --> 03:24.420
I'm just gonna, I'm just gonna, I'm not gonna listen to your nonsense, but how soft do you

03:24.420 --> 03:28.840
have to be to censor the word rape when talking about rape culture?

03:28.840 --> 03:32.480
The superintendent looked the father in the eye and said that not only did the rape not

03:32.480 --> 03:34.760
happen, but the student did not exist.

03:34.760 --> 03:39.840
The sheriff's department found and charged the student with two counts of forcible, why

03:39.840 --> 03:42.900
are you censoring sodomy?

03:42.900 --> 03:45.440
Sometimes it's hard to tell whether it's a joke or not, but eventually it does become

03:45.440 --> 03:46.440
rather ridiculous.

03:46.440 --> 03:47.440
Doesn't it?

03:47.440 --> 03:49.840
I understand that doctors are including obesity.

03:49.840 --> 03:53.600
There's the censored one, obesity as an underlying medical condition that late, that leads to

03:53.600 --> 03:54.920
death in COVID patients.

03:54.920 --> 03:58.760
Do these doctors have any idea what kind of impact this has on families to be told that

03:58.760 --> 04:02.040
their loved one's body shape is partly to blame for their death?

04:02.040 --> 04:03.540
It's true though, isn't it?

04:03.540 --> 04:09.760
Do you have any idea what kind of impact being told that being fat has negative health consequences?

04:10.480 --> 04:13.520
This is, I can't believe that I'm seeing this stuff.

04:13.520 --> 04:15.620
Nobody can be told anything negative now.

04:15.620 --> 04:16.960
These are all spoiled children.

04:16.960 --> 04:20.200
Give me one good reason for recording fatness as a cause of death.

04:20.200 --> 04:25.840
Well, how about if you're so fat that your heart can no longer beat because it's encased

04:25.840 --> 04:29.640
in a globe of fat and it just can't move anymore.

04:29.640 --> 04:32.280
Imagine being so triggered by the word obesity that you have to censor it.

04:32.280 --> 04:33.280
It's fucking wild, isn't it?

04:33.280 --> 04:37.280
Remember when the fragile white, there's, I guess there, I don't know why they're sensing

04:37.280 --> 04:46.580
fragile, but white, fragile white men made these stupid, is stupid a slur that needs

04:46.580 --> 04:51.320
to be censored?

04:51.320 --> 04:52.320
You know what?

04:52.320 --> 04:58.440
I think, I think the next, the next frontier and all of this stuff will be like intelligence-ist.

04:58.440 --> 05:02.320
If you're too smart, you're too privileged and we need to equalize you with all the dumb

05:02.320 --> 05:03.320
people.

05:03.320 --> 05:07.680
This is all fun and games, but this tendency of using the asterisk in this way actually

05:07.680 --> 05:13.000
took a swerve at one point where they began using it on like real events or real people's

05:13.000 --> 05:14.000
names.

05:14.000 --> 05:20.480
As if talking about somebody, just referencing that they exist as a human is just too triggering.

05:20.480 --> 05:22.240
You can't, you can't do it in public.

05:22.240 --> 05:24.280
Content warning, trigger warning, hi, hi.

05:24.280 --> 05:25.280
Just a heads up.

05:25.280 --> 05:32.160
If you see Jake Paul, Jake Paul pop up on your feeds, it's probably about sexual assault

05:32.160 --> 05:34.580
and human trafficking.

05:34.580 --> 05:39.560
So please be careful when reading, dude, never drive a vehicle ever again.

05:39.560 --> 05:44.480
I'm not going to comment on JK Rowling's new book other than that the portag's ridiculous

05:44.480 --> 05:46.000
name makes me laugh every time I see it.

05:46.000 --> 05:47.000
That's right.

05:47.000 --> 05:51.380
JK Rowling went from like the progressive darling to persona non grata, progressive

05:51.380 --> 05:52.380
non grata.

05:52.380 --> 05:59.200
Here, let's see if I can like do this, you know, search Rowling.

05:59.200 --> 06:02.540
I know this is nothing new, but I go through phases where I'm reminded how deeply hurt

06:02.540 --> 06:05.200
I am by JK Rowling and I can't let it go.

06:05.200 --> 06:09.260
I am so angry with the fact that I can't look or think about Harry Potter without getting

06:09.260 --> 06:11.520
incredibly sad or feeling so betrayed.

06:11.520 --> 06:15.440
I wonder how they would react if they like walk by a bookstore and there's like a sign

06:15.440 --> 06:19.000
for like a new book or something and it says by JK Rowling.

06:19.000 --> 06:20.000
Do they have seizures?

06:20.000 --> 06:22.040
Do they just start like shaking on the ground?

06:22.040 --> 06:24.640
Turfs can have Rowling and Chappelle.

06:24.640 --> 06:27.080
I'm going to have to do a video on this Chappelle thing, aren't I?

06:27.080 --> 06:31.040
It just keeps blowing up with the Netflix walkouts and stuff breaking white feminist

06:31.040 --> 06:38.200
queen Margaret Atwood joins the ranks of JK and who I can't even tell who this person

06:38.200 --> 06:39.600
is.

06:39.600 --> 06:44.120
I can't recognize who is this person with these with these sensors.

06:44.120 --> 06:45.240
I can't even look it up.

06:45.240 --> 06:49.360
In fact, the whole can't even look it up seems to be the purpose of some of this.

06:49.360 --> 06:54.140
The use of asterisks in this way eventually transitioned not only to show how the person

06:54.140 --> 06:59.260
that you're talking about is they who must not be named, ironically enough, but also

06:59.260 --> 07:04.740
because a lot of these people, especially if they're on Twitter, they think that these

07:04.740 --> 07:09.780
larger known figures, these public figures, these creators sometimes that they name search

07:09.780 --> 07:10.780
themselves.

07:10.780 --> 07:13.220
And I'm sure people name search themselves at least once in a while.

07:13.220 --> 07:16.980
You know, I might do it like once a year or something instead of curiosity.

07:16.980 --> 07:22.520
But most people who are too busy doing their own thing, not spending all this time on Twitter

07:22.520 --> 07:23.960
on Google name searching themselves.

07:23.960 --> 07:28.560
They're not like reading their own Kiwi Farms threads or something, except shoe on head.

07:28.560 --> 07:33.800
She does actually do that, but just called the TCU PD to report the large social gathering

07:33.800 --> 07:38.760
caused by Steven Crowder and they told me that TCU gave him a permit to be there.

07:38.760 --> 07:40.480
They can't do anything else.

07:40.480 --> 07:46.080
Like do you think Steven Crowder just sits up at night searching for his name on Twitter

07:46.080 --> 07:49.480
and you do this so that he won't notice that you're being critical of him in public?

07:49.480 --> 07:53.720
Like it's either that or you genuinely think that the name Steven Crowder is triggering.

07:53.720 --> 07:54.800
It's one of the two.

07:54.800 --> 07:57.000
So I guess pick which way that you're going to be stupid then.

07:57.000 --> 07:58.000
All right.

07:58.000 --> 07:59.000
All right.

07:59.000 --> 08:00.000
I got to see how far some of this goes.

08:00.000 --> 08:01.000
Okay.

08:01.000 --> 08:02.000
Let's try out Sargon.

08:02.000 --> 08:07.900
Do you think it would be, I think it would be the, the A that gets censored or the O.

08:07.900 --> 08:09.600
Let's try the A first.

08:09.600 --> 08:14.360
That video of Sargon reacting to the don't say the R slur PSA by perpetuating repeating

08:14.360 --> 08:17.280
every slur in the video and angrily shouting, who the fuck do you think you are?

08:17.280 --> 08:21.040
My mom tells you exactly at which stage of the development his brain got stuck on.

08:21.040 --> 08:22.040
What stage do you mean?

08:22.040 --> 08:25.520
You mean the stage that you don't want to be told by some fucking nanny what to do?

08:25.520 --> 08:26.520
I don't know, dude.

08:26.520 --> 08:30.480
You sound kind of like a retard when you see a decent long play YouTube channel that likes

08:30.480 --> 08:32.120
and follow Sargon of a kid.

08:32.120 --> 08:37.760
I, uh, I'm not going to name any names, but at this point I know a number of very large

08:37.760 --> 08:40.080
gaming YouTubers who watch my content.

08:40.080 --> 08:44.120
Hi guys, by the way, people who are way past the 1 million sub Mark, not going to reveal

08:44.120 --> 08:46.120
who they are, but yeah.

08:46.120 --> 08:52.560
If you have a favorite gaming channel on YouTube, they're probably watching antisocialist content

08:52.560 --> 08:53.560
and good.

08:53.560 --> 08:55.680
I can hear my dad listening to Sargon.

08:55.680 --> 08:57.360
You didn't even censor it properly.

08:57.360 --> 09:01.760
And also, I guess he wants to learn about the tenants of dadism since he has a dad after

09:01.760 --> 09:02.760
all.

09:02.760 --> 09:03.760
This is back in 2016.

09:03.760 --> 09:05.000
They've been doing this for a while.

09:05.000 --> 09:10.000
Sargon fans are upset that gray bloke is an anti-feminist Nazi now, not politically incorrect

09:10.000 --> 09:11.680
like he supposedly was before.

09:11.680 --> 09:16.880
You go back to like a lot of, a lot of YouTubers from like 2010, 2011, 2012, all of them said

09:16.880 --> 09:20.120
stuff like retard and faggot, all of them.

09:20.120 --> 09:24.400
Even people who are squeaky clean now, like Veritasium, it makes every single person at

09:24.400 --> 09:27.320
interviews look like a complete retard or Vsauce.

09:27.320 --> 09:36.800
Wonder woman, Wonder woman, Wonder woman, Wonder woman, Wonder woman, Wonder woman,

09:36.800 --> 09:40.800
Wonder woman, Wonder woman, Wonder woman, Wonder woman, Wonder woman, Wonder woman,

09:40.800 --> 09:45.920
Wonder woman, Wonder woman, Wonder woman, Wonder woman, Wonder woman, Wonder woman,

09:45.920 --> 09:46.920
Wonder woman, Wonder woman, Wonder woman, Wonder woman, Wonder woman, Wonder woman,

09:46.920 --> 09:47.920
Wonder woman, Wonder woman, Wonder woman, Wonder woman, Wonder woman, Wonder woman,

09:47.920 --> 09:48.920
Wonder woman, Wonder woman, Wonder woman, Wonder woman, Wonder woman, Wonder woman,

09:48.920 --> 09:49.920
Wonder woman, Wonder woman, Wonder woman, Wonder woman, Wonder woman, Wonder woman,

09:49.920 --> 09:50.920
Wonder woman, Wonder woman, Wonder woman, Wonder woman, Wonder woman, Wonder woman,

09:50.920 --> 09:51.920
Wonder woman, Wonder woman, Wonder woman, Wonder woman, Wonder woman, Wonder woman,

09:51.920 --> 09:52.920
Wonder woman, Wonder woman, Wonder woman, Wonder woman, Wonder woman, Wonder woman,

09:52.920 --> 09:53.920
Wonder woman, Wonder woman, Wonder woman, Wonder woman, Wonder woman, Wonder woman,

09:53.920 --> 09:54.920
Wonder woman, Wonder woman, Wonder woman, Wonder woman, Wonder woman, Wonder woman,

09:54.920 --> 09:55.920
Wonder woman, Wonder woman, Wonder woman, Wonder woman, Wonder woman, Wonder woman,

09:55.920 --> 09:56.920
Wait, really?

09:56.920 --> 09:58.960
Like, no, no, they're not.

09:58.960 --> 09:59.960
You can fuck around.

09:59.960 --> 10:00.960
You can make jokes.

10:00.960 --> 10:03.880
You can be not serious sometimes.

10:03.880 --> 10:06.280
You can engage in banter and still be a good person.

10:06.280 --> 10:10.480
I feel like I'm unearthing hidden gems by searching for people's names like this.

10:10.480 --> 10:11.480
Let's try something else.

10:11.480 --> 10:17.880
Why don't we try, um, let's try Ben Shapiro, let's just do Shapiro, do something like that.

10:17.880 --> 10:18.880
Let's try it.

10:18.880 --> 10:19.880
What do we get?

10:19.880 --> 10:24.000
Oh God, Kyle Calagren, that guy with the glasses leftover, just had a minor heart attack seeing

10:24.000 --> 10:25.680
the name of the actress playing Dorothy.

10:25.680 --> 10:28.080
It's not Ben Shapiro's sister, they just have the same name.

10:28.080 --> 10:31.120
Imagine having a heart attack because the sister of a political pundit that you don't

10:31.120 --> 10:34.200
like might have a public facing job.

10:34.200 --> 10:35.200
Fucking unreal.

10:35.200 --> 10:36.360
These people are soft, dude.

10:36.360 --> 10:37.620
Someone please come and shoot me.

10:37.620 --> 10:41.960
My older brother's listening to Ben Shapiro's review of the Squid Game at 1.5 times speed

10:41.960 --> 10:42.960
at full volume.

10:42.960 --> 10:43.960
Based!

10:43.960 --> 10:46.680
But listen, though, he's not, he's not at Giga child levels yet.

10:46.680 --> 10:48.200
You have to watch it at two times speed.

10:48.200 --> 10:52.240
My new hobby is censoring the names of people I don't like, like Ben Shapiro.

10:52.240 --> 10:55.880
I think it's so funny for no reason.

10:55.880 --> 10:57.880
Me too, buddy.

10:57.880 --> 11:00.320
Alright, let's try Dankula.

11:00.320 --> 11:04.200
Think we got something for Dankula?

11:04.200 --> 11:08.240
The absolute shock of seeing someone retweet Dankula onto my timeline.

11:08.240 --> 11:10.040
Been a while since I had to unfollow manually.

11:10.040 --> 11:11.840
Yeah, it's, it's rough, isn't it?

11:11.840 --> 11:16.520
To see his wholesome takes about his child and his wife, maybe some free speech stuff.

11:16.520 --> 11:19.800
Every once in a while, that picture of his balls with like a smiley face on them.

11:19.800 --> 11:23.680
If I hadn't done the tweet that Count Dankula replied to, would he have replied to somebody

11:23.680 --> 11:24.920
else instead with the same thing?

11:24.920 --> 11:26.360
Am I taking one for the team?

11:26.360 --> 11:30.440
Or have my actions inadvertently caused more fascist bullshit to be in the world than there

11:30.440 --> 11:31.640
would have been otherwise?

11:31.640 --> 11:34.560
This is your brain on pure consequentialist ethics, guys.

11:34.560 --> 11:37.720
Oh my god, I said something that an undesirable touched.

11:37.720 --> 11:40.660
I need to sit here for the next six hours and calculate this shit out.

11:40.660 --> 11:44.040
My face when I block all the weird Dankula fanboys amendments.

11:44.040 --> 11:47.040
Hold on a minute.

11:47.040 --> 11:48.400
What?

11:48.400 --> 11:50.760
You're white.

11:50.760 --> 11:52.320
You're fucking white, dude.

11:52.320 --> 11:55.040
What is this digital ass black face you're engaging in here?

11:55.040 --> 11:56.600
Get the fuck out of here.

11:56.600 --> 12:00.240
I see Dankula is complaining cancel culture is stopping him from ever getting a normal

12:00.240 --> 12:01.240
job.

12:01.240 --> 12:02.240
It's all the mean lefty's fault.

12:02.240 --> 12:06.960
Nothing to do with the idea nobody would want to employ an unwashed cunt who's very public,

12:06.960 --> 12:10.880
unapologetic, racist, misogynist bullshit landed him in court.

12:10.880 --> 12:15.400
You mean teaching a dog how to salute?

12:15.400 --> 12:16.520
How to do the Nazi salute?

12:16.520 --> 12:19.120
Like, is that what we're talking about?

12:19.120 --> 12:20.120
You know what?

12:20.120 --> 12:21.120
Fuck it.

12:21.120 --> 12:22.120
I'm going to recreate that.

12:22.120 --> 12:23.400
As soon as I get a dog, I'm recreating it.

12:23.400 --> 12:24.400
Fuck it.

12:24.400 --> 12:26.120
Sorry, Naomi.

12:26.120 --> 12:27.920
Content warming transphobia.

12:27.920 --> 12:32.240
She ratted out a trans sex worker to count Dankula for some reason.

12:32.240 --> 12:33.880
Here's what happened.

12:33.880 --> 12:38.960
A UK labor peer referring to trans women as creatures.

12:38.960 --> 12:39.960
Never mind that shit.

12:39.960 --> 12:40.960
What's her name?

12:40.960 --> 12:43.680
It's for research.

12:43.680 --> 12:45.080
So hold on, hold on.

12:45.080 --> 12:46.680
It's it's problematic.

12:46.680 --> 12:51.860
It's problematic if you put porn up and then somebody that you let's say you don't you

12:51.860 --> 12:54.880
don't agree with politically decides to whack off to it.

12:54.880 --> 13:00.600
What the what the fuck you call this ratting out a trans sex worker ratting out to what

13:00.600 --> 13:01.600
end?

13:01.600 --> 13:02.600
Cummies?

13:02.600 --> 13:03.600
I wonder.

13:03.600 --> 13:04.600
I think we'll get something for for Arch.

13:04.600 --> 13:12.080
I mean, his his name starts with A. So it'd be like RCH something like that.

13:12.080 --> 13:13.080
I don't know.

13:13.080 --> 13:15.080
Let's see.

13:15.080 --> 13:17.320
That doesn't seem like it.

13:17.320 --> 13:18.720
Probably the same for V as well.

13:18.720 --> 13:19.720
Like his name is too.

13:19.720 --> 13:21.680
It's too short and it's too relatively normal.

13:21.680 --> 13:24.280
And on the flip side of that, there's no way you're getting anything from my name.

13:24.280 --> 13:26.280
Like what would it be?

13:26.280 --> 13:27.280
S.H.

13:27.280 --> 13:33.000
Or to for her to her to cool something like that.

13:33.000 --> 13:34.000
Like, look at that.

13:34.000 --> 13:35.600
There's no way of getting anything.

13:35.600 --> 13:37.040
No, of course not.

13:37.040 --> 13:40.000
Some of us are just uncensorable, I guess.

13:40.000 --> 13:45.280
In fact, if you were to search for SFO, you would get stuff about the airport, the San

13:45.280 --> 13:46.640
Francisco International Airport.

13:46.640 --> 13:52.800
What's really funny is that Bad Bunny, yes, the the five dollars girl, five dollars a

13:52.800 --> 13:53.800
month.

13:53.800 --> 13:54.800
Yeah.

13:54.800 --> 13:55.800
Her.

13:55.800 --> 13:59.740
She does this for Destiny and Vash constantly, like half her Twitter account is about talking

13:59.740 --> 14:00.740
about them.

14:00.740 --> 14:03.680
And yet she censors their name every single time.

14:03.680 --> 14:08.340
And to be honest, searching that censored version of Vash dredges up some of the funniest

14:08.340 --> 14:10.820
leftist infighting stuff I've seen in a while.

14:10.820 --> 14:17.700
Vash is definitely real chaser energy for for smacking his big manly penis against inferior

14:17.700 --> 14:18.700
trans girl.

14:18.700 --> 14:22.900
Oh, my God, dude, how does anybody take this guy seriously?

14:22.900 --> 14:25.420
Y'all, I'm just never talking about Vash again.

14:25.420 --> 14:30.220
I'm so fucking tired of getting well actually a dozen times every ask the most simplest,

14:30.220 --> 14:31.740
most basic questions.

14:31.740 --> 14:32.740
I don't care.

14:32.740 --> 14:36.300
He's a fed.

14:36.300 --> 14:40.820
He's so cringe when people say like his name is some kind of trigger word.

14:40.820 --> 14:45.120
You normalize this stuff, you know, you already treat these trigger words seriously.

14:45.120 --> 14:47.820
So on what grounds do you stand when you complain about this stuff?

14:47.820 --> 14:53.260
I mean, it's public knowledge at this point that Vash engaged in some weird sexual harassment

14:53.260 --> 14:55.620
slash grooming stuff years ago.

14:55.620 --> 15:00.860
He's admitted on his own channel even if his victim decided to say Vash in this manner

15:00.860 --> 15:02.500
with a censored letter.

15:02.500 --> 15:04.020
How could you possibly object?

15:04.020 --> 15:08.160
It sounds like you're just a Vash fan who doesn't like the fact that your favorite Internet

15:08.160 --> 15:10.780
e-celeb is triggering.

15:10.780 --> 15:12.380
We're back on Moviebob review.

15:12.380 --> 15:20.540
So did Doug Walker, Doug Walker go full right wing to get his subs back up or is he an angry

15:20.540 --> 15:22.420
post left bro now?

15:22.420 --> 15:24.780
Doug Walker is he just a movie guy.

15:24.780 --> 15:25.780
He's a nostalgia critic.

15:25.780 --> 15:29.300
He's like the most milk toast of Internet people.

15:29.300 --> 15:31.960
And he's the guy that you have to censor for a Moviebob.

15:31.960 --> 15:35.360
Doug Walker left behind by the superior future.

15:35.360 --> 15:39.360
It is awfully fucking weird how many people are chummy with Doug Walker at.

15:39.360 --> 15:40.360
Okay.

15:40.360 --> 15:41.360
Okay.

15:41.360 --> 15:43.940
I thought it was just gonna be a Moviebob.

15:43.940 --> 15:45.400
People are actually doing this one.

15:45.400 --> 15:47.520
I remember seeing this back during the new guy thing.

15:47.520 --> 15:50.520
I don't understand why stealing from rich people is bad.

15:50.520 --> 15:53.760
Isn't it always morally correct to steal from the mega rich?

15:53.760 --> 15:58.380
Like if Yulon Moles got a garage full of Telsa stone for him, I'd be laughing too.

15:58.380 --> 15:59.680
But she says gamer bro.

15:59.680 --> 16:02.360
If she's referring to someone like PewDiePie, well, he's racist as hell.

16:02.360 --> 16:05.960
So this individual just seems to be a moral leper.

16:05.960 --> 16:09.000
All right, let's do PewDiePie.

16:09.000 --> 16:10.000
Here we go.

16:10.000 --> 16:11.000
Yep.

16:11.000 --> 16:12.000
Lots of nonsense.

16:12.000 --> 16:16.600
Are you gonna next PewDiePie exclusive deal?

16:16.600 --> 16:21.200
This all right, literally supports PewDiePie.

16:21.200 --> 16:23.840
If you find PewDiePie attractive, you're not seeing heaven.

16:23.840 --> 16:24.840
It's wild.

16:24.840 --> 16:26.400
It's just this whole video.

16:26.400 --> 16:27.400
It's been kind of nonsense.

16:27.400 --> 16:29.760
To be honest, this probably isn't one of my greatest.

16:29.760 --> 16:34.840
But the point is, is that they think either one, these names are actually trigger words.

16:34.840 --> 16:39.540
Two, they think all these creators actually have the time or the care to name search themselves.

16:39.540 --> 16:44.120
Or three, they want to shit talk somebody online and not receive any kind of clap back

16:44.120 --> 16:45.720
from people who disagree with them.

16:45.720 --> 16:47.780
And so they make themselves a bit more unsearchable.

16:47.780 --> 16:48.780
You know what?

16:48.780 --> 16:55.360
For old time's sake, let's do gamer gate.

16:55.360 --> 16:58.920
When you're trying to inform the FBI, the siege of Washington was actually the act of

16:58.920 --> 17:04.520
a secret cabal of gamers to control the government called gamer gate, but they won't stop laughing.

17:04.520 --> 17:06.120
This one is going to be more jokey than the others.

17:06.120 --> 17:07.120
I'm pretty sure.

17:07.120 --> 17:08.120
Oh, no, wait.

17:08.120 --> 17:09.120
Nevermind.

17:09.120 --> 17:10.120
Lindsay Ellis has taken it seriously.

17:10.120 --> 17:14.200
I'm reminded of when gamer gate happened and Todd in the shadows wrote an article condemning

17:14.200 --> 17:15.800
their movement.

17:15.800 --> 17:17.680
And all of these dudes were like, man, I thought you were cool.

17:17.680 --> 17:21.120
And his response was, where did I go wrong that you thought I'd agree with you?

17:21.120 --> 17:26.100
Because as we've said before, you've all cultivated an edgy audience, and then you turned into

17:26.100 --> 17:27.900
moral busybodies.

17:27.900 --> 17:32.400
The craziest example of all, though, in my opinion, is Sophia Narwhits.

17:32.400 --> 17:35.120
Now, Sophia Narwhits is a friend of mine.

17:35.120 --> 17:37.240
She's a trans woman, a journalist, a streamer.

17:37.240 --> 17:41.600
She did on the ground reporting in Minneapolis during the George Floyd riots, and she likes

17:41.600 --> 17:46.680
to spend her spare time on Twitch playing the absolute worst fucking games that I've

17:46.680 --> 17:47.680
ever seen.

17:47.680 --> 17:48.960
You know what I got?

17:48.960 --> 17:52.280
Let's do the feminist robot game.

17:52.280 --> 17:57.280
Let's do can androids pray?

17:57.280 --> 18:05.860
This is narrative experience about angry femme mech pilots at the end of the world.

18:05.860 --> 18:08.920
And so we literally have Sophia derangement syndrome now.

18:08.920 --> 18:12.400
I get the biggest erection when people are afraid to say my name.

18:12.400 --> 18:16.920
I have a priori finished my next piece, which should come out on either the ninth or the

18:16.920 --> 18:17.920
tenth.

18:17.920 --> 18:22.920
It ties neatly into my Sophia Narwhits piece as a broader critique of the independent right-wing

18:22.920 --> 18:26.740
media ecosystem as power-coddling bootlickers.

18:26.740 --> 18:28.240
People know who Sophia Narwhits is.

18:28.240 --> 18:30.280
I've never heard of A. Khaled.

18:30.280 --> 18:32.280
Stop retweeting Sophia Narwhits.

18:32.280 --> 18:36.700
She may be on the ground for the Minneapolis stuff, but she's a right-wing chud responsible

18:36.700 --> 18:39.700
for endangering the lives of thousands of journalists.

18:39.700 --> 18:41.920
She's more of a journalist than those thousands.

18:41.920 --> 18:44.200
She's actually out there doing real reporting.

18:44.200 --> 18:46.000
There are plenty of people documenting the protests.

18:46.000 --> 18:48.480
You don't have to retweet Sophia Narwhits.

18:48.480 --> 18:51.360
It won't stop her blowing up because not enough people know who she is, but at least folks

18:51.360 --> 18:53.360
in the games industry just had to avoid it, you know?

18:53.360 --> 18:57.760
Oh my God, this person is doing real work and they're being credited for it.

18:57.760 --> 19:00.320
We need more trans people in gaming.

19:00.320 --> 19:02.520
No not Sophia Narwhits.

19:02.520 --> 19:09.060
This is kind of like how Larry Elder was the black face of white supremacy for a while.

19:09.060 --> 19:14.400
If a majority of the content you create is reactionary outrage regarding McGame's journalism

19:14.400 --> 19:18.160
instead of actual meaningful content about video games, then you don't have a say in

19:18.160 --> 19:20.480
how people should go do their fucking job.

19:20.480 --> 19:26.000
It costs zero dollars to mind your own business and not send hate mobs against marginalized

19:26.000 --> 19:27.000
writers.

19:27.000 --> 19:32.040
Sophia Narwhits and Colin Moriarty need to go outside for once in their miserable lives.

19:32.040 --> 19:33.980
Isn't Sophia Narwhits the marginalized one?

19:33.980 --> 19:34.980
She's trans.

19:34.980 --> 19:37.920
Does she have like what people call passing privilege I guess?

19:37.920 --> 19:38.920
So she doesn't count?

19:38.920 --> 19:40.420
Like what's going on?

19:40.420 --> 19:45.340
Young trans women like Sophia Narwhits still tweet about gamergate in the year 2021.

19:45.340 --> 19:49.320
She's not as relevant as people like ContraPoints or Blaire White but she's equally annoying.

19:49.320 --> 19:53.920
It honestly feels a bit like jealousy, like these people who are taking off, who are nonetheless

19:53.920 --> 19:57.900
not approved by the progressive machinery, and all these other people are just angry

19:57.900 --> 19:58.900
about it.

19:58.900 --> 20:02.780
Thinking back on the time Sophia Narwhits shared a post from my little blog about how

20:02.780 --> 20:07.820
Rage 2 does a lazy job aping features of real genetic disease in its monster designs, with

20:07.820 --> 20:12.940
her chud audience and a bunch of boneheads trying to come for me, a PhD human geneticist.

20:12.940 --> 20:16.620
This might have to be a video that I do, like a different video, but I've had this idea

20:16.620 --> 20:21.960
floating around in my head for the idea of semi-privacy, which I think really just boils

20:21.960 --> 20:24.320
down to wanting the entire world to be a safe space.

20:24.320 --> 20:30.080
But what it is, is people who have small platforms, they post something public, and it is public,

20:30.080 --> 20:34.660
but because they have such little reach, it feels private, and so when something that

20:34.660 --> 20:38.580
they post blows up, and it blows up for, say, a bad reason, like they gave a really bad

20:38.580 --> 20:43.100
take, or someone says, look how stupid this is, they're like, oh my god, my safe space

20:43.100 --> 20:46.460
is being breached, how dare you come in here and ruin my day.

20:46.460 --> 20:48.300
It's like you posted it publicly, dude.

20:48.300 --> 20:52.520
Just because you're not used to having your dumb fucking takes noticed, doesn't mean that

20:52.520 --> 20:56.560
suddenly your rights are being violated when somebody notices your dumb take finally.

20:56.560 --> 21:00.660
I get the feeling that Sophia Narwhits is like what would have happened if Valerie Keefe

21:00.660 --> 21:05.820
had mastered appealing to the far right through gaming and being the ultimate pick-me, a fee

21:05.820 --> 21:06.820
MRA.

21:06.820 --> 21:12.020
You gotta admit, pick-me-quizzling is a hell of a grift, or I mean look, hell of a look.

21:12.020 --> 21:17.540
The whole pick-me thing is just wild, like, if you don't line up with their politics,

21:17.540 --> 21:21.260
and yet you are not, you know, the straight white male, but you are part of a demographic

21:21.260 --> 21:24.820
that they claim to speak for, then you're not a real person, you're a pick-me.

21:24.820 --> 21:27.460
You're not doing it because this is what you want, or this is your temperament, or this

21:27.460 --> 21:30.940
is your real politics, or your real views, or your real desires.

21:30.940 --> 21:35.640
You're doing it because you want attention from the straight white men, and so you're

21:35.640 --> 21:36.780
saying pick-me.

21:36.780 --> 21:41.780
It's kind of amazing because these same people, back during when Gamergate was on, they decried

21:41.780 --> 21:43.700
the whole idea of the fake gamer girl.

21:43.700 --> 21:46.940
You know, the girl who doesn't actually play video games, but she poses with a controller

21:46.940 --> 21:50.580
or something in her mouth, and then she says, look at me, silly boys, girls can video games

21:50.580 --> 21:51.580
too.

21:51.580 --> 21:54.100
And the actual nerds, the guys who, you know, were picked on for playing games when they

21:54.100 --> 21:57.860
were a kid, because that was a thing when I was young, and got bullied by guys and girls

21:57.860 --> 22:01.920
alike for it, those nerds looked at those gamer girls and said, look how fucking fake

22:01.920 --> 22:02.920
you are.

22:02.920 --> 22:06.100
This is just, this is just you trying to get attention, and sometimes it was, but also

22:06.100 --> 22:11.060
sometimes real gamer girls, girls who actually played video games, they got lumped in, and

22:11.060 --> 22:13.820
those guys said, you're just wanting attention, get the fuck out of here, which wasn't necessarily

22:13.820 --> 22:14.820
the right thing to do.

22:14.820 --> 22:20.180
But my point is, people on the left decried the nerds for doing that, and now they do

22:20.180 --> 22:21.180
it.

22:21.180 --> 22:22.180
They do it when they say pick me.

22:22.180 --> 22:23.980
It's the same thing, but it's in reverse.

22:23.980 --> 22:28.620
These people didn't actually change how they behave, they're still the fucking bullies,

22:28.620 --> 22:30.900
they just change what team they play for.

22:30.900 --> 22:34.380
There's so much more, it's kind of insane, and ironically all you have to do is just

22:34.380 --> 22:39.540
go check out Sofia Naros's twitter, and it's just full of people who are losing their shit

22:39.540 --> 22:44.980
because she is the person that she is, and it's always amusing to see people melt down

22:44.980 --> 22:49.100
at somebody else's success, solely because they don't like the politics of the other

22:49.100 --> 22:50.100
person.

22:50.100 --> 22:54.180
How dare you be successful, how dare you have a life, how dare you even be around.

22:54.180 --> 22:58.540
Anyway, this wasn't actually a serious video, it's me goofing around for a bit, having some

22:58.540 --> 22:59.540
laughs.

22:59.540 --> 23:01.820
I'm not going to take everything seriously, you know, I'm not that kind of guy.

23:01.820 --> 23:05.660
I hope showing you some of the idiocy that's out there in the world, especially on twitter,

23:05.660 --> 23:08.980
was at least worth the time for you, maybe you found it as funny as I did.

23:08.980 --> 23:13.140
Thanks for watching, I'll be streaming some more at twitch.tv slash game boomers, and

23:13.140 --> 23:14.940
I'll see you in the next video.

23:14.940 --> 23:16.740
Thanks very much guys, I love you.
