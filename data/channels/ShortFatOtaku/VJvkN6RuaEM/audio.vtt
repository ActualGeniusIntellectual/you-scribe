00:00.000 --> 00:09.360
Oh my god, the government's coming to take away your gas stove!

00:09.360 --> 00:12.960
At least, that's the most absurd story of the current news cycle.

00:12.960 --> 00:16.760
I gotta admit, I actually didn't know that gas stoves, the way that Americans have them,

00:16.760 --> 00:20.960
where there's a little electricity-fed lighter that sparks a trickle of gas, even existed

00:20.960 --> 00:22.240
until my teen years.

00:22.240 --> 00:26.420
I know, gas stoves exist in Canada, but growing up, everyone I knew either had an electric

00:26.420 --> 00:31.100
stove with the plug-in coils, or more recently, an induction stove, where electromagnetism

00:31.100 --> 00:34.320
heats up the pot or pan itself without heating up anything else.

00:34.320 --> 00:35.820
Those ones are actually kind of spooky.

00:35.820 --> 00:39.740
You can touch the stove and not feel anything, but any metal in the direct vicinity will

00:39.740 --> 00:41.900
heat up due to the electromagnetic field.

00:41.900 --> 00:46.340
You can find tons of videos online, generally showing the same demo, where a pan is cut

00:46.340 --> 00:50.020
in half, sitting on the induction stove, where what's in the pan is cooking and what's

00:50.020 --> 00:51.620
on the element directly isn't.

00:51.620 --> 00:55.220
Sometimes you can even find videos of people putting stuff between the stove top and the

00:55.220 --> 00:59.020
pan, stuff that's clearly flammable like a towel or something, and the food's cooking

00:59.020 --> 01:00.220
while the towel's just fine.

01:00.220 --> 01:04.460
It's due to how futuristic-feeling that induction stovetops are that is behind this

01:04.460 --> 01:08.140
general, cultural view that they are the future of cooking at home.

01:08.140 --> 01:12.200
The induction stovetops you can buy right now are all generally touch-screen and smart

01:12.200 --> 01:16.340
house-enabled, adding to this progress-oriented, futuristic aesthetic and attitude.

01:16.340 --> 01:20.220
The problem, naturally, comes from the idea that new technology isn't just another option

01:20.220 --> 01:23.900
among a marketplace of options, and let the one that fulfills consumer demand the best

01:23.900 --> 01:24.900
win.

01:24.900 --> 01:28.160
The company jumps in and says, no, you can't have the old options anymore, which seems

01:28.160 --> 01:32.280
to be the starting point of the current gas stove viral controversy.

01:32.280 --> 01:37.660
The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission will move to regulate gas stoves as new research

01:37.660 --> 01:41.740
links them to childhood asthma, says Bloomberg, with a commissioner saying that health and

01:41.740 --> 01:45.420
respiratory problems are a hidden hazard, and any option is on the table.

01:45.420 --> 01:48.500
Products that can't be made safe can be banned, and the backlash to this news was

01:48.500 --> 01:49.500
rather extreme.

01:49.500 --> 01:52.740
Not surprising, since 40% of stoves in America are gas stoves.

01:52.740 --> 01:54.340
I'll never give up my gas stove.

01:54.340 --> 01:58.180
If the maniacs in the White House come for my stove, they can pry it from my cold, dead

01:58.180 --> 01:59.180
hands.

01:59.180 --> 02:00.180
Come and take it!

02:00.180 --> 02:02.560
Second Amendment rhetoric for gas stoves kind of makes sense.

02:02.560 --> 02:04.380
Gas can obviously be used as a weapon.

02:04.380 --> 02:08.500
We've got libs of TikTok pointing out yet again the obvious hypocrisy, gas stoves for

02:08.500 --> 02:09.860
me but not for thee.

02:09.860 --> 02:13.660
Those in power seek to implement these measures top-down onto the common person while not

02:13.660 --> 02:15.220
actually living them themselves.

02:15.220 --> 02:19.300
I have never used a gas stove, but if the liberals try to ban them, I'm getting one.

02:19.300 --> 02:21.860
My gas stove now identifies as an electric stove.

02:21.860 --> 02:24.780
I'll be firing up my gas stove today, high heat.

02:24.780 --> 02:26.380
You should too and enjoy a nice meal.

02:26.380 --> 02:29.020
Don't let the radical left scare you from living life.

02:29.020 --> 02:30.380
Holy shit, guys.

02:30.380 --> 02:34.580
Before even getting into any of the substance here, like the science behind the use of gas

02:34.580 --> 02:37.420
stoves and health, or the veracity of the claims that the government's coming for

02:37.420 --> 02:39.820
them, just on the surface, these people are brain-rotted.

02:39.820 --> 02:44.740
Yeah, some of them are memes, like the assault gas stove, or the dude cooking every single

02:44.740 --> 02:47.140
possible egg he can before gas is outlawed.

02:47.140 --> 02:48.540
There's some funny shit in here.

02:48.540 --> 02:53.820
But some of these reactions are real, uncut, culture-war-infected slices of human frontal

02:53.820 --> 02:54.820
lobe.

02:54.820 --> 02:58.700
Like, you know how there's this view of leftoids as NPCs who just mindlessly swallow

02:58.700 --> 03:01.980
what the establishment tells them without a single critical thought in their heads?

03:01.980 --> 03:06.140
They're just brain-dead March of Progress culture warriors who have no clue what they're

03:06.140 --> 03:07.140
doing?

03:07.140 --> 03:10.720
There's an equivalent idea of rightoids as NPCs who just mindlessly reject what the

03:10.720 --> 03:12.220
establishment tells them.

03:12.220 --> 03:16.460
Automatically assuming anything said by anybody from any institution is not only false, but

03:16.460 --> 03:19.780
ironclad proof of the craziest possible conspiracy.

03:19.780 --> 03:23.300
The left follows the popular narrative without even considering the problems with it.

03:23.300 --> 03:27.080
But the right rejects the popular narrative without even considering when and where it

03:27.080 --> 03:28.560
might be correct.

03:28.560 --> 03:32.780
Even DeSantis is talking about not cooking to the gas stove ban, which is primarily just

03:32.780 --> 03:37.940
him virtue signaling, considering that Florida has the lowest rate of gas stove usage in

03:37.940 --> 03:38.940
America.

03:38.940 --> 03:40.940
There's even this guy, though I think he's just memeing.

03:40.940 --> 03:58.940
Yeah, he's gotta be memeing.

03:58.940 --> 04:03.300
But still, I'm surprised so many people are actually earnestly saying this is a Biden

04:03.300 --> 04:04.300
initiative.

04:04.300 --> 04:08.780
Joe Biden wants to take gas stoves like Obama took the guns Americans still have 15 years

04:08.780 --> 04:09.780
later.

04:09.780 --> 04:12.740
Let's cut through the bullshit, let's ignore all the nonsense, let's discover

04:12.740 --> 04:14.060
what's actually happening.

04:14.060 --> 04:18.980
In that Bloomberg article, the opinion on gas stoves is given by Richard Trumka Jr.,

04:18.980 --> 04:21.540
who works for the US Consumer Product Safety Commission.

04:21.540 --> 04:25.000
But he's not its leader or anybody important, he's just a random guy.

04:25.000 --> 04:29.000
The chair of that organization has gone on record saying that while current research

04:29.000 --> 04:33.040
does suggest that emissions from gas stoves may be hazardous, his organization has no

04:33.040 --> 04:34.540
intention of banning them.

04:34.540 --> 04:38.080
And the White House put out a statement asserting that the Biden administration does not support

04:38.080 --> 04:39.800
a ban on gas stoves.

04:39.800 --> 04:43.480
But just because the feds aren't doing it doesn't mean it's not happening in some

04:43.480 --> 04:44.480
places.

04:44.480 --> 04:49.800
San Diego plans to phase 90% of all gas in the city out by 2035, shifting over to electric.

04:49.800 --> 04:53.280
And this applies not only to new buildings, but retrofitting old ones as well.

04:53.280 --> 04:57.840
Los Angeles moved to ban gas stoves in all new buildings starting January 1, 2023.

04:57.840 --> 05:00.480
But unlike San Diego, they don't require a retrofit.

05:00.480 --> 05:04.920
This is in lockstep with broader efforts in California to move away from gas by 2030,

05:04.920 --> 05:08.800
like rebates to get your old stoves and heaters replaced, as well as requiring industry to

05:08.800 --> 05:11.000
only offer zero emission options.

05:11.000 --> 05:15.820
A similar program is also underway in the UK, as well as other American cities.

05:15.820 --> 05:19.200
When you turn on the stove to make a meal, you probably aren't thinking about climate

05:19.200 --> 05:20.200
change.

05:20.200 --> 05:24.580
But major cities across the country are passing bans on gas stoves and other appliances that

05:24.580 --> 05:28.360
run on natural gas because of their planet warming emissions.

05:28.360 --> 05:33.420
It's a big deal because nearly 187 million Americans use natural gas in their homes.

05:33.420 --> 05:37.220
So even though Biden and the feds aren't the ones doing it, there's still clearly

05:37.220 --> 05:39.240
people out there who want to see it happen.

05:39.240 --> 05:44.020
We already know why they want to, their primary stated reason is likely going to be environmental.

05:44.020 --> 05:47.480
Even though like with oil, natural gas used by regular individuals is likely going to

05:47.480 --> 05:51.320
be a lot less than rich people or corporations or governments, they're still going to ask

05:51.320 --> 05:52.980
the little man to take it dry.

05:52.980 --> 05:57.300
But to my surprise, they're actually not leaning on the environmental aspect this time,

05:57.300 --> 05:59.580
but instead on the public health aspect.

05:59.580 --> 06:03.020
This whole story was kicked off by Trump's personal comments to Bloomberg, but he was

06:03.020 --> 06:07.680
getting his information from this November 2022 study, Population Attributable Fraction

06:07.680 --> 06:12.020
of Gas Stoves and Childhood Asthma in the United States, which looked at exactly what

06:12.020 --> 06:13.020
it says in the title.

06:13.020 --> 06:17.580
They found that 12.7% of childhood asthma in the United States was attributable to gas

06:17.580 --> 06:18.800
stove use at home.

06:18.800 --> 06:22.400
Some conspiratorial minded people out there will point out that two of the principles

06:22.400 --> 06:26.980
behind the study work for the Rocky Mountain Institute, a company that does business doing

06:26.980 --> 06:30.680
these retrofits, and therefore they might have a financial incentive to promote the

06:30.680 --> 06:32.480
idea that more of them should be done.

06:32.480 --> 06:36.540
But on the other hand, people with exactly that type of experience are the ones you'd

06:36.540 --> 06:38.700
want to have some input on this topic.

06:38.700 --> 06:43.020
And the other two principles are unrelated to the RMI, instead working for the University

06:43.020 --> 06:47.180
of Sydney in Australia and the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York.

06:47.180 --> 06:52.100
I have seen, during online debates on this topic, more right-leaning people counter this

06:52.100 --> 06:57.100
November 2022 study with a contrasting study from 2013, Cooking Fuels and the Prevalence

06:57.100 --> 07:02.140
of Asthma, a global analysis of phase 3 of the International Study of Asthma and Allergies

07:02.140 --> 07:03.260
in Childhood.

07:03.260 --> 07:08.080
Most notably cited by Steve Everly in this viral thread, who stated, the largest analysis

07:08.080 --> 07:14.440
of any link between gas stoves and childhood asthma, 500,000 plus children sampled worldwide,

07:14.440 --> 07:19.540
found no evidence of an association between the use of gas as a cooking fuel and either

07:19.540 --> 07:21.720
asthma symptoms or asthma diagnosis.

07:21.720 --> 07:25.860
That's a pretty damning response to the people he claims are ignorant of the study.

07:25.860 --> 07:29.280
The only problem is, Everly is reading the study incorrectly.

07:29.280 --> 07:34.400
One of this study's principles, Professor Bert Bruenkrief of Utrecht University in

07:34.400 --> 07:40.020
the Netherlands, came out and clarified that his 2013 study did indeed find a correlation

07:40.020 --> 07:45.080
between open fire cooking and asthma in children, but failed to find a correlation between gas

07:45.080 --> 07:49.740
as a fuel in open fire cooking, specifically, and asthma in children, and that people like

07:49.740 --> 07:53.600
Everly are entirely incorrect in their interpretation of the data.

07:53.600 --> 07:57.720
In other words, this means that all forms of open fire cooking, burning coal or wood

07:57.720 --> 08:03.520
or gas or oil or anything else, are all correlated with asthma in children, yes, including gas,

08:03.520 --> 08:08.200
but that gas isn't any more correlated with asthma than the other burnable options.

08:08.200 --> 08:13.600
And the funniest bit of all is, that more recent 2022 study linking asthma and gas stoves,

08:13.600 --> 08:18.600
it's based on, among other things, Bruenkrief's body of work, being a meta-analysis of 40

08:18.600 --> 08:22.520
research papers studying a link between burning gas and asthma.

08:22.520 --> 08:26.040
Where Everly is correct in his thread is in his focus on ventilation.

08:26.040 --> 08:28.380
Regardless of how you cook, ventilation is important.

08:28.380 --> 08:33.360
Data from the Ernest Orlando Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory shows that not only cooking

08:33.360 --> 08:37.760
method, but what you're cooking, what oil you cook with, and how hot you cook, all drastically

08:37.760 --> 08:41.920
change the breathable emissions the act of cooking generates, with olive oil, a common

08:41.920 --> 08:44.120
cooking ingredient, being particularly volatile.

08:44.120 --> 08:47.780
None of this means that gas stoves aren't linked with asthma in children anymore, they

08:47.780 --> 08:52.520
still are, but it does mean that the conversation is more nuanced than gas bad.

08:52.520 --> 08:56.640
It might be the case that a properly ventilated kitchen sees the risk minimized, which is

08:56.640 --> 09:00.920
Everly's point, and seems to be echoed by another study, CO2 exposure, ventilation,

09:00.920 --> 09:05.720
thermal comfort, and health risks in low-income home kitchens of 12 global cities, which found

09:05.720 --> 09:09.960
that CO2 concentration in kitchens depended on cooking method, ventilation, and size of

09:09.960 --> 09:11.060
the kitchen space.

09:11.060 --> 09:15.360
My layman's guess is that a small kitchen with a gas stove and low ventilation, which

09:15.360 --> 09:18.940
is likely common for a lot of poor people in America, is going to represent some sort

09:18.940 --> 09:23.460
of health hazard, and that both ventilation and cooking method are variables that can

09:23.460 --> 09:25.580
be adjusted to improve the situation.

09:25.580 --> 09:27.780
Hold on guys, I found this while editing.

09:27.780 --> 09:32.860
This is from Studying the Optimal Ventilation for Environmental Indoor Air Quality April

09:32.860 --> 09:38.360
2022, and it shows that while a whole bunch of things are actually helped with ventilation,

09:38.360 --> 09:43.440
nitrogen dioxide isn't, and nitrogen dioxide is one of the main sources the other studies

09:43.440 --> 09:46.120
were looking at when it came to asthma in children.

09:46.120 --> 09:51.520
Though it might be the case that good ventilation has way less of an impact than I initially

09:51.520 --> 09:52.520
thought.

09:52.520 --> 09:55.240
And it really all is just about what kind of stove you have.

09:55.240 --> 09:59.240
That seems to cover the facts, but nonetheless, you can still find rightoids who are gurgling

09:59.240 --> 10:03.200
about gas stoves being the way it's always been in America, and it needs to keep being

10:03.200 --> 10:06.980
that way, and nobody's died from this before, despite the common trope of a grandma accident

10:06.980 --> 10:10.840
leaving the gas on, or somebody suicidal sticking their head in an oven, and the climate impacts

10:10.840 --> 10:14.160
aren't real, and it's all just leftoids who want to institute a power grab and make

10:14.160 --> 10:15.160
you suffer.

10:15.200 --> 10:16.640
It could be that, for sure.

10:16.640 --> 10:21.240
There is a small possibility of all of this being faked for political reasons, but it's

10:21.240 --> 10:25.640
just as possible that gas stoves are actually really bad for you, and all the pushback from

10:25.640 --> 10:30.080
rightoids is also just a power grab on behalf of the oil industry which wants to keep seeing

10:30.080 --> 10:34.220
those big fat municipal paychecks rolling in for the service of supplying gas lines

10:34.220 --> 10:38.460
to every building in the city, and every culture warrior crying on Twitter is cucking themselves

10:38.460 --> 10:42.040
to big energy and their Republican partners using gas as a kickback system.

10:42.040 --> 10:47.080
It turns out, both sides are capable of conspiratorial thinking, and both sound retarded when doing

10:47.080 --> 10:48.080
it.

10:48.080 --> 10:50.800
The final question remains then, should we ban gas stoves?

10:50.800 --> 10:54.340
Well, it's not like we don't ban other things when we discover they're harmful

10:54.340 --> 10:55.340
to us.

10:55.340 --> 10:58.160
Imagine if we discovered the link between asbestos and cancer in 2023.

10:58.160 --> 11:02.520
Oh my god, there would be a Twitter culture war over it, with people screaming that asbestos

11:02.520 --> 11:05.920
never did nothing wrong and it's all just Biden pushing a climate agenda and all this

11:05.920 --> 11:06.920
other nonsense.

11:06.920 --> 11:08.080
And forget about seatbelts.

11:08.080 --> 11:10.920
There were already people claiming they'd never wear them back when those were first

11:10.920 --> 11:11.920
made mandatory too.

11:11.920 --> 11:16.800
I'll have to detour the town to get to Kalamazoo, if they pass the seatbelt ordinance, I don't

11:16.800 --> 11:18.120
use the seatbelt.

11:18.120 --> 11:22.360
I wouldn't wear my seatbelt, if I get caught, I get caught I guess.

11:22.360 --> 11:27.320
I oppose it on the basis that it replaces the free will of the individual with the desires

11:27.320 --> 11:28.320
of the state.

11:28.320 --> 11:32.320
You can't force people to do things, you know, if they think that it's necessary, they're

11:32.320 --> 11:34.120
poor, if they don't think so.

11:34.120 --> 11:41.600
The question here is whether we have the right, whether we have the responsibility, whether

11:41.600 --> 11:52.640
we have the judgment to turn to the citizens of this state and be there in 1984, big brother.

11:52.640 --> 11:57.120
But all that being said, we also keep around harmful things that we like.

11:57.120 --> 12:00.720
Cigarettes are harmful both to the smoker and those around him, and they're still legal.

12:00.720 --> 12:03.060
Alcohol is probably the most harmful thing in human history.

12:03.060 --> 12:06.040
The vast majority of all rapes and assaults are committed by drunk people.

12:06.040 --> 12:08.280
Half of the victims of those crimes are also drunk.

12:08.280 --> 12:10.800
Health problems, car accidents, you fucking name it.

12:10.800 --> 12:13.240
Alcohol is a major killer, and yet, it's still legal.

12:13.240 --> 12:17.820
I would even describe alcohol as one of the great examples as to how the elites of society

12:17.820 --> 12:22.120
cannot simply dictate their will top-down in a democratic system, much to the chagrin

12:22.120 --> 12:24.760
of the elite theorist, political realist types.

12:24.760 --> 12:29.400
As when prohibition came to an end in America, the elites still wanted alcohol gone, and

12:29.400 --> 12:32.520
yet their ideas were so unpopular, they lost.

12:32.520 --> 12:36.000
Soft drugs like weed are slowly becoming decriminalized or legalized.

12:36.000 --> 12:39.560
And yes, sorry stoners, they do also carry a degree of harm with them.

12:39.560 --> 12:40.920
Burn is harmful but legal.

12:40.920 --> 12:42.640
Gambling is harmful but legal.

12:42.640 --> 12:47.560
The point is, gas stoves being harmful is not enough of a reason to ban them.

12:47.560 --> 12:52.200
It seems to me that it becomes reasonable to ban old technology or practices only through

12:52.200 --> 12:54.000
a specific set of criteria.

12:54.000 --> 12:55.000
1.

12:55.000 --> 12:59.320
If the old technology or practice is significantly harmful and not just to yourself but other

12:59.320 --> 13:00.320
people.

13:00.320 --> 13:01.320
2.

13:01.320 --> 13:05.280
If there is a replacement technology or practice that is just as functional and less harmful.

13:05.280 --> 13:08.640
Being less harmful and significantly less functional is a disqualifier.

13:08.720 --> 13:09.720
3.

13:09.720 --> 13:13.720
If the ban comes with either a grandfather clause or a significantly lengthy activation

13:13.720 --> 13:14.720
period.

13:14.720 --> 13:17.720
Think about these rules for a little bit and you'll realize they probably make sense.

13:17.720 --> 13:21.720
If we invented a cigarette right now that had all the positives of cigarettes, the same

13:21.720 --> 13:25.800
buzz, the same taste, even the same addictive nature, but none of the health problems, it

13:25.800 --> 13:29.780
seems reasonable that our society would ban the old cigarettes from being produced.

13:29.780 --> 13:32.280
If you still had or found the old ones, you could smoke them.

13:32.280 --> 13:35.660
But if your local store only sold the new ones, I don't think it would be this huge

13:35.660 --> 13:37.800
infringement on your rights or anything like that.

13:37.960 --> 13:41.320
The counterargument, of course, is that the powers that be could claim their replacement

13:41.320 --> 13:45.280
technology is just as good, but it actually isn't, and you should just shut up about

13:45.280 --> 13:46.280
it.

13:46.280 --> 13:49.700
That's why you can occasionally find rightoids saying that not only gas stoves good, but

13:49.700 --> 13:51.400
induction stoves bad.

13:51.400 --> 13:55.600
All the positive claims about induction stoves are just propaganda from big induction.

13:55.600 --> 13:58.880
And to their credit, induction does come with a few problems.

13:58.880 --> 14:02.520
Ceramic pots and pans don't work with it, due to electromagnetism requiring metal.

14:02.520 --> 14:06.800
It can mess with some electronic devices, most notably pacemakers and hearing aids.

14:06.800 --> 14:12.240
And oftentimes induction stovetops are touch-activated, making them hard to use with greasy, wet,

14:12.240 --> 14:13.320
or dirty hands.

14:13.320 --> 14:16.960
And they're also often tied into the whole smart home ecosystem, which brings along its

14:16.960 --> 14:21.360
own cyberpunk-esque set of always-online, always-connected dystopian issues.

14:21.360 --> 14:23.560
But it's not like the stoves themselves don't cook your food.

14:23.560 --> 14:26.880
The technology works just fine, and the other problems can be avoided or ironed out.

14:26.880 --> 14:29.360
That doesn't mean that I'm pro-making-everything-induction.

14:29.360 --> 14:31.640
In my opinion, gas stoves shouldn't be banned.

14:31.640 --> 14:35.320
Even though they do cause some harm, it's nowhere near something like smoking or drinking.

14:35.320 --> 14:37.940
If the government wants to offer some sort of financial incentive to switch over to a

14:37.940 --> 14:41.040
non-gas option, that's fine with me, but the people who want gas should be able to

14:41.040 --> 14:42.040
get it.

14:42.040 --> 14:44.920
Probably the worst part about this story, though, is how conservatives and progressives

14:44.920 --> 14:49.560
are slowly brain-damaging each other over time, by associating various cognitive steps

14:49.560 --> 14:53.200
with a particular political coalition, and therefore causing the rival faction to be

14:53.200 --> 14:55.360
less able to think certain thoughts.

14:55.360 --> 14:58.900
Tell me, if you're more right-leaning than me, when I mocked rightoids for thinking that

14:58.900 --> 15:02.580
Biden was coming for your gas stoves, did you feel the knee-jerk reaction to leave a

15:02.580 --> 15:06.120
comment about how stupid I was, how devoted I am to being a moderate, that I can't put

15:06.120 --> 15:08.180
the dots together and see the real story?

15:08.180 --> 15:11.540
If you're more left-leaning than me, when I mocked leftoids for thinking that Republican

15:11.540 --> 15:15.180
support for gas stoves was a cover for their support of the gas industry, and that they

15:15.180 --> 15:19.600
were just using common people's fears, did you feel a similar knee-jerk reaction to leave

15:19.600 --> 15:20.600
a similar comment?

15:20.600 --> 15:22.220
Here's an example of what I'm getting at.

15:22.220 --> 15:27.060
When concepts like free speech or economic growth become attached to the right, it becomes

15:27.060 --> 15:31.540
harder for people who view themselves as left-wing to advocate for those positions, even if it

15:31.540 --> 15:35.540
means forsaking good arguments that are correct by their own definition.

15:35.540 --> 15:40.020
Arguments that are pro-free speech or pro-economic growth that lead to things a left-leaning

15:40.020 --> 15:45.020
person might consider good still end up sticking in their throat because those are right-wing

15:45.020 --> 15:46.360
positions, right-wing ideas.

15:46.360 --> 15:48.960
And this concept works in reverse too, obviously.

15:48.960 --> 15:52.720
Pollution is bad or climate change is bad has become attached to the left, and people

15:52.720 --> 15:56.820
who view themselves as right-wing seem to also have a hard time adopting an argument

15:56.820 --> 16:00.360
that would help the right but also accepts the left-wing presupposition that pollution

16:00.360 --> 16:01.360
is bad.

16:01.360 --> 16:05.540
The result is that certain ideas, even if they're correct, become locked away mentally

16:05.540 --> 16:06.760
for the partisan.

16:06.760 --> 16:08.020
Mental habits are reinforced.

16:08.020 --> 16:11.740
I can't make a free speech argument that's right-wing, or I can't make an environmental

16:11.740 --> 16:15.900
argument that's left-wing, when what we should be doing is making not left arguments

16:15.900 --> 16:18.500
or right arguments, but good arguments.

16:18.500 --> 16:22.660
The gas stove story is honestly not a big deal, but everyone's reaction to it shows

16:22.660 --> 16:25.500
you just how brain-rotted all these people are.

16:25.500 --> 16:29.420
Don't be afraid to use the arguments of your opponents if they're actually correct.

16:29.420 --> 16:30.980
Don't just react.

16:30.980 --> 16:31.980
Think.

16:31.980 --> 16:32.980
Think.

16:32.980 --> 16:33.980
Think.

16:33.980 --> 16:34.980
Think.

16:34.980 --> 16:35.980
Think.

16:35.980 --> 16:36.980
Think.

16:36.980 --> 16:37.980
Think.

16:37.980 --> 16:38.980
Think.

16:38.980 --> 16:39.980
Think.

16:39.980 --> 16:40.980
Think.

16:40.980 --> 16:41.980
Think.

16:41.980 --> 16:42.980
Think.

16:42.980 --> 16:43.980
Think.

16:43.980 --> 16:44.980
Think.

16:44.980 --> 16:45.980
Think.

16:45.980 --> 16:46.980
Think.

16:46.980 --> 16:47.980
Think.

16:47.980 --> 16:48.980
Think.

16:48.980 --> 16:49.980
Think.

16:49.980 --> 16:50.980
Think.

16:50.980 --> 16:51.980
Think.

16:51.980 --> 16:52.980
Think.

16:52.980 --> 16:53.480
Think.
