1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,360
Oh my god, the government's coming to take away your gas stove!

2
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:12,960
At least, that's the most absurd story of the current news cycle.

3
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:16,760
I gotta admit, I actually didn't know that gas stoves, the way that Americans have them,

4
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:20,960
where there's a little electricity-fed lighter that sparks a trickle of gas, even existed

5
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:22,240
until my teen years.

6
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:26,420
I know, gas stoves exist in Canada, but growing up, everyone I knew either had an electric

7
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:31,100
stove with the plug-in coils, or more recently, an induction stove, where electromagnetism

8
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:34,320
heats up the pot or pan itself without heating up anything else.

9
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:35,820
Those ones are actually kind of spooky.

10
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:39,740
You can touch the stove and not feel anything, but any metal in the direct vicinity will

11
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:41,900
heat up due to the electromagnetic field.

12
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:46,340
You can find tons of videos online, generally showing the same demo, where a pan is cut

13
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:50,020
in half, sitting on the induction stove, where what's in the pan is cooking and what's

14
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:51,620
on the element directly isn't.

15
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:55,220
Sometimes you can even find videos of people putting stuff between the stove top and the

16
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:59,020
pan, stuff that's clearly flammable like a towel or something, and the food's cooking

17
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:00,220
while the towel's just fine.

18
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:04,460
It's due to how futuristic-feeling that induction stovetops are that is behind this

19
00:01:04,460 --> 00:01:08,140
general, cultural view that they are the future of cooking at home.

20
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:12,200
The induction stovetops you can buy right now are all generally touch-screen and smart

21
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:16,340
house-enabled, adding to this progress-oriented, futuristic aesthetic and attitude.

22
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:20,220
The problem, naturally, comes from the idea that new technology isn't just another option

23
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:23,900
among a marketplace of options, and let the one that fulfills consumer demand the best

24
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:24,900
win.

25
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:28,160
The company jumps in and says, no, you can't have the old options anymore, which seems

26
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:32,280
to be the starting point of the current gas stove viral controversy.

27
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:37,660
The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission will move to regulate gas stoves as new research

28
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:41,740
links them to childhood asthma, says Bloomberg, with a commissioner saying that health and

29
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:45,420
respiratory problems are a hidden hazard, and any option is on the table.

30
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:48,500
Products that can't be made safe can be banned, and the backlash to this news was

31
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:49,500
rather extreme.

32
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:52,740
Not surprising, since 40% of stoves in America are gas stoves.

33
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:54,340
I'll never give up my gas stove.

34
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:58,180
If the maniacs in the White House come for my stove, they can pry it from my cold, dead

35
00:01:58,180 --> 00:01:59,180
hands.

36
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:00,180
Come and take it!

37
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:02,560
Second Amendment rhetoric for gas stoves kind of makes sense.

38
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,380
Gas can obviously be used as a weapon.

39
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:08,500
We've got libs of TikTok pointing out yet again the obvious hypocrisy, gas stoves for

40
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:09,860
me but not for thee.

41
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:13,660
Those in power seek to implement these measures top-down onto the common person while not

42
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:15,220
actually living them themselves.

43
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:19,300
I have never used a gas stove, but if the liberals try to ban them, I'm getting one.

44
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:21,860
My gas stove now identifies as an electric stove.

45
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:24,780
I'll be firing up my gas stove today, high heat.

46
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:26,380
You should too and enjoy a nice meal.

47
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:29,020
Don't let the radical left scare you from living life.

48
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:30,380
Holy shit, guys.

49
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:34,580
Before even getting into any of the substance here, like the science behind the use of gas

50
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:37,420
stoves and health, or the veracity of the claims that the government's coming for

51
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:39,820
them, just on the surface, these people are brain-rotted.

52
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:44,740
Yeah, some of them are memes, like the assault gas stove, or the dude cooking every single

53
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:47,140
possible egg he can before gas is outlawed.

54
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:48,540
There's some funny shit in here.

55
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:53,820
But some of these reactions are real, uncut, culture-war-infected slices of human frontal

56
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:54,820
lobe.

57
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:58,700
Like, you know how there's this view of leftoids as NPCs who just mindlessly swallow

58
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:01,980
what the establishment tells them without a single critical thought in their heads?

59
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:06,140
They're just brain-dead March of Progress culture warriors who have no clue what they're

60
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:07,140
doing?

61
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:10,720
There's an equivalent idea of rightoids as NPCs who just mindlessly reject what the

62
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,220
establishment tells them.

63
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:16,460
Automatically assuming anything said by anybody from any institution is not only false, but

64
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:19,780
ironclad proof of the craziest possible conspiracy.

65
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:23,300
The left follows the popular narrative without even considering the problems with it.

66
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:27,080
But the right rejects the popular narrative without even considering when and where it

67
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:28,560
might be correct.

68
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:32,780
Even DeSantis is talking about not cooking to the gas stove ban, which is primarily just

69
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:37,940
him virtue signaling, considering that Florida has the lowest rate of gas stove usage in

70
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:38,940
America.

71
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:40,940
There's even this guy, though I think he's just memeing.

72
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:58,940
Yeah, he's gotta be memeing.

73
00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:03,300
But still, I'm surprised so many people are actually earnestly saying this is a Biden

74
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:04,300
initiative.

75
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:08,780
Joe Biden wants to take gas stoves like Obama took the guns Americans still have 15 years

76
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:09,780
later.

77
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:12,740
Let's cut through the bullshit, let's ignore all the nonsense, let's discover

78
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:14,060
what's actually happening.

79
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:18,980
In that Bloomberg article, the opinion on gas stoves is given by Richard Trumka Jr.,

80
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:21,540
who works for the US Consumer Product Safety Commission.

81
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:25,000
But he's not its leader or anybody important, he's just a random guy.

82
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,000
The chair of that organization has gone on record saying that while current research

83
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,040
does suggest that emissions from gas stoves may be hazardous, his organization has no

84
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,540
intention of banning them.

85
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:38,080
And the White House put out a statement asserting that the Biden administration does not support

86
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,800
a ban on gas stoves.

87
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:43,480
But just because the feds aren't doing it doesn't mean it's not happening in some

88
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:44,480
places.

89
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:49,800
San Diego plans to phase 90% of all gas in the city out by 2035, shifting over to electric.

90
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:53,280
And this applies not only to new buildings, but retrofitting old ones as well.

91
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:57,840
Los Angeles moved to ban gas stoves in all new buildings starting January 1, 2023.

92
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,480
But unlike San Diego, they don't require a retrofit.

93
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:04,920
This is in lockstep with broader efforts in California to move away from gas by 2030,

94
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:08,800
like rebates to get your old stoves and heaters replaced, as well as requiring industry to

95
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,000
only offer zero emission options.

96
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,820
A similar program is also underway in the UK, as well as other American cities.

97
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:19,200
When you turn on the stove to make a meal, you probably aren't thinking about climate

98
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:20,200
change.

99
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:24,580
But major cities across the country are passing bans on gas stoves and other appliances that

100
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:28,360
run on natural gas because of their planet warming emissions.

101
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:33,420
It's a big deal because nearly 187 million Americans use natural gas in their homes.

102
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:37,220
So even though Biden and the feds aren't the ones doing it, there's still clearly

103
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:39,240
people out there who want to see it happen.

104
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:44,020
We already know why they want to, their primary stated reason is likely going to be environmental.

105
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:47,480
Even though like with oil, natural gas used by regular individuals is likely going to

106
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:51,320
be a lot less than rich people or corporations or governments, they're still going to ask

107
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:52,980
the little man to take it dry.

108
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:57,300
But to my surprise, they're actually not leaning on the environmental aspect this time,

109
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:59,580
but instead on the public health aspect.

110
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:03,020
This whole story was kicked off by Trump's personal comments to Bloomberg, but he was

111
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:07,680
getting his information from this November 2022 study, Population Attributable Fraction

112
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:12,020
of Gas Stoves and Childhood Asthma in the United States, which looked at exactly what

113
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:13,020
it says in the title.

114
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:17,580
They found that 12.7% of childhood asthma in the United States was attributable to gas

115
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:18,800
stove use at home.

116
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:22,400
Some conspiratorial minded people out there will point out that two of the principles

117
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:26,980
behind the study work for the Rocky Mountain Institute, a company that does business doing

118
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:30,680
these retrofits, and therefore they might have a financial incentive to promote the

119
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:32,480
idea that more of them should be done.

120
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:36,540
But on the other hand, people with exactly that type of experience are the ones you'd

121
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:38,700
want to have some input on this topic.

122
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:43,020
And the other two principles are unrelated to the RMI, instead working for the University

123
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:47,180
of Sydney in Australia and the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York.

124
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:52,100
I have seen, during online debates on this topic, more right-leaning people counter this

125
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:57,100
November 2022 study with a contrasting study from 2013, Cooking Fuels and the Prevalence

126
00:06:57,100 --> 00:07:02,140
of Asthma, a global analysis of phase 3 of the International Study of Asthma and Allergies

127
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:03,260
in Childhood.

128
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:08,080
Most notably cited by Steve Everly in this viral thread, who stated, the largest analysis

129
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:14,440
of any link between gas stoves and childhood asthma, 500,000 plus children sampled worldwide,

130
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:19,540
found no evidence of an association between the use of gas as a cooking fuel and either

131
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:21,720
asthma symptoms or asthma diagnosis.

132
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:25,860
That's a pretty damning response to the people he claims are ignorant of the study.

133
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:29,280
The only problem is, Everly is reading the study incorrectly.

134
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:34,400
One of this study's principles, Professor Bert Bruenkrief of Utrecht University in

135
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:40,020
the Netherlands, came out and clarified that his 2013 study did indeed find a correlation

136
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:45,080
between open fire cooking and asthma in children, but failed to find a correlation between gas

137
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:49,740
as a fuel in open fire cooking, specifically, and asthma in children, and that people like

138
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:53,600
Everly are entirely incorrect in their interpretation of the data.

139
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:57,720
In other words, this means that all forms of open fire cooking, burning coal or wood

140
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:03,520
or gas or oil or anything else, are all correlated with asthma in children, yes, including gas,

141
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:08,200
but that gas isn't any more correlated with asthma than the other burnable options.

142
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:13,600
And the funniest bit of all is, that more recent 2022 study linking asthma and gas stoves,

143
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:18,600
it's based on, among other things, Bruenkrief's body of work, being a meta-analysis of 40

144
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:22,520
research papers studying a link between burning gas and asthma.

145
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:26,040
Where Everly is correct in his thread is in his focus on ventilation.

146
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:28,380
Regardless of how you cook, ventilation is important.

147
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:33,360
Data from the Ernest Orlando Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory shows that not only cooking

148
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:37,760
method, but what you're cooking, what oil you cook with, and how hot you cook, all drastically

149
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:41,920
change the breathable emissions the act of cooking generates, with olive oil, a common

150
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:44,120
cooking ingredient, being particularly volatile.

151
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:47,780
None of this means that gas stoves aren't linked with asthma in children anymore, they

152
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:52,520
still are, but it does mean that the conversation is more nuanced than gas bad.

153
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:56,640
It might be the case that a properly ventilated kitchen sees the risk minimized, which is

154
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:00,920
Everly's point, and seems to be echoed by another study, CO2 exposure, ventilation,

155
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:05,720
thermal comfort, and health risks in low-income home kitchens of 12 global cities, which found

156
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:09,960
that CO2 concentration in kitchens depended on cooking method, ventilation, and size of

157
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,060
the kitchen space.

158
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:15,360
My layman's guess is that a small kitchen with a gas stove and low ventilation, which

159
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:18,940
is likely common for a lot of poor people in America, is going to represent some sort

160
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:23,460
of health hazard, and that both ventilation and cooking method are variables that can

161
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:25,580
be adjusted to improve the situation.

162
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:27,780
Hold on guys, I found this while editing.

163
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:32,860
This is from Studying the Optimal Ventilation for Environmental Indoor Air Quality April

164
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:38,360
2022, and it shows that while a whole bunch of things are actually helped with ventilation,

165
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:43,440
nitrogen dioxide isn't, and nitrogen dioxide is one of the main sources the other studies

166
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:46,120
were looking at when it came to asthma in children.

167
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:51,520
Though it might be the case that good ventilation has way less of an impact than I initially

168
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:52,520
thought.

169
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:55,240
And it really all is just about what kind of stove you have.

170
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:59,240
That seems to cover the facts, but nonetheless, you can still find rightoids who are gurgling

171
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:03,200
about gas stoves being the way it's always been in America, and it needs to keep being

172
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:06,980
that way, and nobody's died from this before, despite the common trope of a grandma accident

173
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:10,840
leaving the gas on, or somebody suicidal sticking their head in an oven, and the climate impacts

174
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:14,160
aren't real, and it's all just leftoids who want to institute a power grab and make

175
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,160
you suffer.

176
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,640
It could be that, for sure.

177
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:21,240
There is a small possibility of all of this being faked for political reasons, but it's

178
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:25,640
just as possible that gas stoves are actually really bad for you, and all the pushback from

179
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:30,080
rightoids is also just a power grab on behalf of the oil industry which wants to keep seeing

180
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:34,220
those big fat municipal paychecks rolling in for the service of supplying gas lines

181
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:38,460
to every building in the city, and every culture warrior crying on Twitter is cucking themselves

182
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:42,040
to big energy and their Republican partners using gas as a kickback system.

183
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:47,080
It turns out, both sides are capable of conspiratorial thinking, and both sound retarded when doing

184
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:48,080
it.

185
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:50,800
The final question remains then, should we ban gas stoves?

186
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:54,340
Well, it's not like we don't ban other things when we discover they're harmful

187
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:55,340
to us.

188
00:10:55,340 --> 00:10:58,160
Imagine if we discovered the link between asbestos and cancer in 2023.

189
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:02,520
Oh my god, there would be a Twitter culture war over it, with people screaming that asbestos

190
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:05,920
never did nothing wrong and it's all just Biden pushing a climate agenda and all this

191
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:06,920
other nonsense.

192
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:08,080
And forget about seatbelts.

193
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:10,920
There were already people claiming they'd never wear them back when those were first

194
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:11,920
made mandatory too.

195
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:16,800
I'll have to detour the town to get to Kalamazoo, if they pass the seatbelt ordinance, I don't

196
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,120
use the seatbelt.

197
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:22,360
I wouldn't wear my seatbelt, if I get caught, I get caught I guess.

198
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:27,320
I oppose it on the basis that it replaces the free will of the individual with the desires

199
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,320
of the state.

200
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:32,320
You can't force people to do things, you know, if they think that it's necessary, they're

201
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,120
poor, if they don't think so.

202
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:41,600
The question here is whether we have the right, whether we have the responsibility, whether

203
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:52,640
we have the judgment to turn to the citizens of this state and be there in 1984, big brother.

204
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:57,120
But all that being said, we also keep around harmful things that we like.

205
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:00,720
Cigarettes are harmful both to the smoker and those around him, and they're still legal.

206
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,060
Alcohol is probably the most harmful thing in human history.

207
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:06,040
The vast majority of all rapes and assaults are committed by drunk people.

208
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:08,280
Half of the victims of those crimes are also drunk.

209
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:10,800
Health problems, car accidents, you fucking name it.

210
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:13,240
Alcohol is a major killer, and yet, it's still legal.

211
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:17,820
I would even describe alcohol as one of the great examples as to how the elites of society

212
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:22,120
cannot simply dictate their will top-down in a democratic system, much to the chagrin

213
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:24,760
of the elite theorist, political realist types.

214
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:29,400
As when prohibition came to an end in America, the elites still wanted alcohol gone, and

215
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:32,520
yet their ideas were so unpopular, they lost.

216
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:36,000
Soft drugs like weed are slowly becoming decriminalized or legalized.

217
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,560
And yes, sorry stoners, they do also carry a degree of harm with them.

218
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:40,920
Burn is harmful but legal.

219
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:42,640
Gambling is harmful but legal.

220
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:47,560
The point is, gas stoves being harmful is not enough of a reason to ban them.

221
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:52,200
It seems to me that it becomes reasonable to ban old technology or practices only through

222
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:54,000
a specific set of criteria.

223
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
1.

224
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:59,320
If the old technology or practice is significantly harmful and not just to yourself but other

225
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,320
people.

226
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,320
2.

227
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:05,280
If there is a replacement technology or practice that is just as functional and less harmful.

228
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:08,640
Being less harmful and significantly less functional is a disqualifier.

229
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:09,720
3.

230
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:13,720
If the ban comes with either a grandfather clause or a significantly lengthy activation

231
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:14,720
period.

232
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:17,720
Think about these rules for a little bit and you'll realize they probably make sense.

233
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:21,720
If we invented a cigarette right now that had all the positives of cigarettes, the same

234
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:25,800
buzz, the same taste, even the same addictive nature, but none of the health problems, it

235
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:29,780
seems reasonable that our society would ban the old cigarettes from being produced.

236
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:32,280
If you still had or found the old ones, you could smoke them.

237
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:35,660
But if your local store only sold the new ones, I don't think it would be this huge

238
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:37,800
infringement on your rights or anything like that.

239
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:41,320
The counterargument, of course, is that the powers that be could claim their replacement

240
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:45,280
technology is just as good, but it actually isn't, and you should just shut up about

241
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:46,280
it.

242
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:49,700
That's why you can occasionally find rightoids saying that not only gas stoves good, but

243
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:51,400
induction stoves bad.

244
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:55,600
All the positive claims about induction stoves are just propaganda from big induction.

245
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:58,880
And to their credit, induction does come with a few problems.

246
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:02,520
Ceramic pots and pans don't work with it, due to electromagnetism requiring metal.

247
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:06,800
It can mess with some electronic devices, most notably pacemakers and hearing aids.

248
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:12,240
And oftentimes induction stovetops are touch-activated, making them hard to use with greasy, wet,

249
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,320
or dirty hands.

250
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:16,960
And they're also often tied into the whole smart home ecosystem, which brings along its

251
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:21,360
own cyberpunk-esque set of always-online, always-connected dystopian issues.

252
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,560
But it's not like the stoves themselves don't cook your food.

253
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:26,880
The technology works just fine, and the other problems can be avoided or ironed out.

254
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:29,360
That doesn't mean that I'm pro-making-everything-induction.

255
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,640
In my opinion, gas stoves shouldn't be banned.

256
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:35,320
Even though they do cause some harm, it's nowhere near something like smoking or drinking.

257
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:37,940
If the government wants to offer some sort of financial incentive to switch over to a

258
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:41,040
non-gas option, that's fine with me, but the people who want gas should be able to

259
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,040
get it.

260
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:44,920
Probably the worst part about this story, though, is how conservatives and progressives

261
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:49,560
are slowly brain-damaging each other over time, by associating various cognitive steps

262
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:53,200
with a particular political coalition, and therefore causing the rival faction to be

263
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:55,360
less able to think certain thoughts.

264
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:58,900
Tell me, if you're more right-leaning than me, when I mocked rightoids for thinking that

265
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:02,580
Biden was coming for your gas stoves, did you feel the knee-jerk reaction to leave a

266
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:06,120
comment about how stupid I was, how devoted I am to being a moderate, that I can't put

267
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:08,180
the dots together and see the real story?

268
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:11,540
If you're more left-leaning than me, when I mocked leftoids for thinking that Republican

269
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:15,180
support for gas stoves was a cover for their support of the gas industry, and that they

270
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:19,600
were just using common people's fears, did you feel a similar knee-jerk reaction to leave

271
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:20,600
a similar comment?

272
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:22,220
Here's an example of what I'm getting at.

273
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:27,060
When concepts like free speech or economic growth become attached to the right, it becomes

274
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:31,540
harder for people who view themselves as left-wing to advocate for those positions, even if it

275
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:35,540
means forsaking good arguments that are correct by their own definition.

276
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:40,020
Arguments that are pro-free speech or pro-economic growth that lead to things a left-leaning

277
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:45,020
person might consider good still end up sticking in their throat because those are right-wing

278
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:46,360
positions, right-wing ideas.

279
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:48,960
And this concept works in reverse too, obviously.

280
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:52,720
Pollution is bad or climate change is bad has become attached to the left, and people

281
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:56,820
who view themselves as right-wing seem to also have a hard time adopting an argument

282
00:15:56,820 --> 00:16:00,360
that would help the right but also accepts the left-wing presupposition that pollution

283
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:01,360
is bad.

284
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:05,540
The result is that certain ideas, even if they're correct, become locked away mentally

285
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:06,760
for the partisan.

286
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:08,020
Mental habits are reinforced.

287
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:11,740
I can't make a free speech argument that's right-wing, or I can't make an environmental

288
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:15,900
argument that's left-wing, when what we should be doing is making not left arguments

289
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:18,500
or right arguments, but good arguments.

290
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:22,660
The gas stove story is honestly not a big deal, but everyone's reaction to it shows

291
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:25,500
you just how brain-rotted all these people are.

292
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:29,420
Don't be afraid to use the arguments of your opponents if they're actually correct.

293
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:30,980
Don't just react.

294
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:31,980
Think.

295
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:32,980
Think.

296
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:33,980
Think.

297
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:34,980
Think.

298
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:35,980
Think.

299
00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:36,980
Think.

300
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:37,980
Think.

301
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:38,980
Think.

302
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:39,980
Think.

303
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:40,980
Think.

304
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:41,980
Think.

305
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:42,980
Think.

306
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:43,980
Think.

307
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:44,980
Think.

308
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:45,980
Think.

309
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:46,980
Think.

310
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:47,980
Think.

311
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:48,980
Think.

312
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:49,980
Think.

313
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:50,980

Think.

315
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:52,980
