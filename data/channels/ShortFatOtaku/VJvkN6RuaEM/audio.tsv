0	9360	Oh my god, the government's coming to take away your gas stove!
9360	12960	At least, that's the most absurd story of the current news cycle.
12960	16760	I gotta admit, I actually didn't know that gas stoves, the way that Americans have them,
16760	20960	where there's a little electricity-fed lighter that sparks a trickle of gas, even existed
20960	22240	until my teen years.
22240	26420	I know, gas stoves exist in Canada, but growing up, everyone I knew either had an electric
26420	31100	stove with the plug-in coils, or more recently, an induction stove, where electromagnetism
31100	34320	heats up the pot or pan itself without heating up anything else.
34320	35820	Those ones are actually kind of spooky.
35820	39740	You can touch the stove and not feel anything, but any metal in the direct vicinity will
39740	41900	heat up due to the electromagnetic field.
41900	46340	You can find tons of videos online, generally showing the same demo, where a pan is cut
46340	50020	in half, sitting on the induction stove, where what's in the pan is cooking and what's
50020	51620	on the element directly isn't.
51620	55220	Sometimes you can even find videos of people putting stuff between the stove top and the
55220	59020	pan, stuff that's clearly flammable like a towel or something, and the food's cooking
59020	60220	while the towel's just fine.
60220	64460	It's due to how futuristic-feeling that induction stovetops are that is behind this
64460	68140	general, cultural view that they are the future of cooking at home.
68140	72200	The induction stovetops you can buy right now are all generally touch-screen and smart
72200	76340	house-enabled, adding to this progress-oriented, futuristic aesthetic and attitude.
76340	80220	The problem, naturally, comes from the idea that new technology isn't just another option
80220	83900	among a marketplace of options, and let the one that fulfills consumer demand the best
83900	84900	win.
84900	88160	The company jumps in and says, no, you can't have the old options anymore, which seems
88160	92280	to be the starting point of the current gas stove viral controversy.
92280	97660	The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission will move to regulate gas stoves as new research
97660	101740	links them to childhood asthma, says Bloomberg, with a commissioner saying that health and
101740	105420	respiratory problems are a hidden hazard, and any option is on the table.
105420	108500	Products that can't be made safe can be banned, and the backlash to this news was
108500	109500	rather extreme.
109500	112740	Not surprising, since 40% of stoves in America are gas stoves.
112740	114340	I'll never give up my gas stove.
114340	118180	If the maniacs in the White House come for my stove, they can pry it from my cold, dead
118180	119180	hands.
119180	120180	Come and take it!
120180	122560	Second Amendment rhetoric for gas stoves kind of makes sense.
122560	124380	Gas can obviously be used as a weapon.
124380	128500	We've got libs of TikTok pointing out yet again the obvious hypocrisy, gas stoves for
128500	129860	me but not for thee.
129860	133660	Those in power seek to implement these measures top-down onto the common person while not
133660	135220	actually living them themselves.
135220	139300	I have never used a gas stove, but if the liberals try to ban them, I'm getting one.
139300	141860	My gas stove now identifies as an electric stove.
141860	144780	I'll be firing up my gas stove today, high heat.
144780	146380	You should too and enjoy a nice meal.
146380	149020	Don't let the radical left scare you from living life.
149020	150380	Holy shit, guys.
150380	154580	Before even getting into any of the substance here, like the science behind the use of gas
154580	157420	stoves and health, or the veracity of the claims that the government's coming for
157420	159820	them, just on the surface, these people are brain-rotted.
159820	164740	Yeah, some of them are memes, like the assault gas stove, or the dude cooking every single
164740	167140	possible egg he can before gas is outlawed.
167140	168540	There's some funny shit in here.
168540	173820	But some of these reactions are real, uncut, culture-war-infected slices of human frontal
173820	174820	lobe.
174820	178700	Like, you know how there's this view of leftoids as NPCs who just mindlessly swallow
178700	181980	what the establishment tells them without a single critical thought in their heads?
181980	186140	They're just brain-dead March of Progress culture warriors who have no clue what they're
186140	187140	doing?
187140	190720	There's an equivalent idea of rightoids as NPCs who just mindlessly reject what the
190720	192220	establishment tells them.
192220	196460	Automatically assuming anything said by anybody from any institution is not only false, but
196460	199780	ironclad proof of the craziest possible conspiracy.
199780	203300	The left follows the popular narrative without even considering the problems with it.
203300	207080	But the right rejects the popular narrative without even considering when and where it
207080	208560	might be correct.
208560	212780	Even DeSantis is talking about not cooking to the gas stove ban, which is primarily just
212780	217940	him virtue signaling, considering that Florida has the lowest rate of gas stove usage in
217940	218940	America.
218940	220940	There's even this guy, though I think he's just memeing.
220940	238940	Yeah, he's gotta be memeing.
238940	243300	But still, I'm surprised so many people are actually earnestly saying this is a Biden
243300	244300	initiative.
244300	248780	Joe Biden wants to take gas stoves like Obama took the guns Americans still have 15 years
248780	249780	later.
249780	252740	Let's cut through the bullshit, let's ignore all the nonsense, let's discover
252740	254060	what's actually happening.
254060	258980	In that Bloomberg article, the opinion on gas stoves is given by Richard Trumka Jr.,
258980	261540	who works for the US Consumer Product Safety Commission.
261540	265000	But he's not its leader or anybody important, he's just a random guy.
265000	269000	The chair of that organization has gone on record saying that while current research
269000	273040	does suggest that emissions from gas stoves may be hazardous, his organization has no
273040	274540	intention of banning them.
274540	278080	And the White House put out a statement asserting that the Biden administration does not support
278080	279800	a ban on gas stoves.
279800	283480	But just because the feds aren't doing it doesn't mean it's not happening in some
283480	284480	places.
284480	289800	San Diego plans to phase 90% of all gas in the city out by 2035, shifting over to electric.
289800	293280	And this applies not only to new buildings, but retrofitting old ones as well.
293280	297840	Los Angeles moved to ban gas stoves in all new buildings starting January 1, 2023.
297840	300480	But unlike San Diego, they don't require a retrofit.
300480	304920	This is in lockstep with broader efforts in California to move away from gas by 2030,
304920	308800	like rebates to get your old stoves and heaters replaced, as well as requiring industry to
308800	311000	only offer zero emission options.
311000	315820	A similar program is also underway in the UK, as well as other American cities.
315820	319200	When you turn on the stove to make a meal, you probably aren't thinking about climate
319200	320200	change.
320200	324580	But major cities across the country are passing bans on gas stoves and other appliances that
324580	328360	run on natural gas because of their planet warming emissions.
328360	333420	It's a big deal because nearly 187 million Americans use natural gas in their homes.
333420	337220	So even though Biden and the feds aren't the ones doing it, there's still clearly
337220	339240	people out there who want to see it happen.
339240	344020	We already know why they want to, their primary stated reason is likely going to be environmental.
344020	347480	Even though like with oil, natural gas used by regular individuals is likely going to
347480	351320	be a lot less than rich people or corporations or governments, they're still going to ask
351320	352980	the little man to take it dry.
352980	357300	But to my surprise, they're actually not leaning on the environmental aspect this time,
357300	359580	but instead on the public health aspect.
359580	363020	This whole story was kicked off by Trump's personal comments to Bloomberg, but he was
363020	367680	getting his information from this November 2022 study, Population Attributable Fraction
367680	372020	of Gas Stoves and Childhood Asthma in the United States, which looked at exactly what
372020	373020	it says in the title.
373020	377580	They found that 12.7% of childhood asthma in the United States was attributable to gas
377580	378800	stove use at home.
378800	382400	Some conspiratorial minded people out there will point out that two of the principles
382400	386980	behind the study work for the Rocky Mountain Institute, a company that does business doing
386980	390680	these retrofits, and therefore they might have a financial incentive to promote the
390680	392480	idea that more of them should be done.
392480	396540	But on the other hand, people with exactly that type of experience are the ones you'd
396540	398700	want to have some input on this topic.
398700	403020	And the other two principles are unrelated to the RMI, instead working for the University
403020	407180	of Sydney in Australia and the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York.
407180	412100	I have seen, during online debates on this topic, more right-leaning people counter this
412100	417100	November 2022 study with a contrasting study from 2013, Cooking Fuels and the Prevalence
417100	422140	of Asthma, a global analysis of phase 3 of the International Study of Asthma and Allergies
422140	423260	in Childhood.
423260	428080	Most notably cited by Steve Everly in this viral thread, who stated, the largest analysis
428080	434440	of any link between gas stoves and childhood asthma, 500,000 plus children sampled worldwide,
434440	439540	found no evidence of an association between the use of gas as a cooking fuel and either
439540	441720	asthma symptoms or asthma diagnosis.
441720	445860	That's a pretty damning response to the people he claims are ignorant of the study.
445860	449280	The only problem is, Everly is reading the study incorrectly.
449280	454400	One of this study's principles, Professor Bert Bruenkrief of Utrecht University in
454400	460020	the Netherlands, came out and clarified that his 2013 study did indeed find a correlation
460020	465080	between open fire cooking and asthma in children, but failed to find a correlation between gas
465080	469740	as a fuel in open fire cooking, specifically, and asthma in children, and that people like
469740	473600	Everly are entirely incorrect in their interpretation of the data.
473600	477720	In other words, this means that all forms of open fire cooking, burning coal or wood
477720	483520	or gas or oil or anything else, are all correlated with asthma in children, yes, including gas,
483520	488200	but that gas isn't any more correlated with asthma than the other burnable options.
488200	493600	And the funniest bit of all is, that more recent 2022 study linking asthma and gas stoves,
493600	498600	it's based on, among other things, Bruenkrief's body of work, being a meta-analysis of 40
498600	502520	research papers studying a link between burning gas and asthma.
502520	506040	Where Everly is correct in his thread is in his focus on ventilation.
506040	508380	Regardless of how you cook, ventilation is important.
508380	513360	Data from the Ernest Orlando Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory shows that not only cooking
513360	517760	method, but what you're cooking, what oil you cook with, and how hot you cook, all drastically
517760	521920	change the breathable emissions the act of cooking generates, with olive oil, a common
521920	524120	cooking ingredient, being particularly volatile.
524120	527780	None of this means that gas stoves aren't linked with asthma in children anymore, they
527780	532520	still are, but it does mean that the conversation is more nuanced than gas bad.
532520	536640	It might be the case that a properly ventilated kitchen sees the risk minimized, which is
536640	540920	Everly's point, and seems to be echoed by another study, CO2 exposure, ventilation,
540920	545720	thermal comfort, and health risks in low-income home kitchens of 12 global cities, which found
545720	549960	that CO2 concentration in kitchens depended on cooking method, ventilation, and size of
549960	551060	the kitchen space.
551060	555360	My layman's guess is that a small kitchen with a gas stove and low ventilation, which
555360	558940	is likely common for a lot of poor people in America, is going to represent some sort
558940	563460	of health hazard, and that both ventilation and cooking method are variables that can
563460	565580	be adjusted to improve the situation.
565580	567780	Hold on guys, I found this while editing.
567780	572860	This is from Studying the Optimal Ventilation for Environmental Indoor Air Quality April
572860	578360	2022, and it shows that while a whole bunch of things are actually helped with ventilation,
578360	583440	nitrogen dioxide isn't, and nitrogen dioxide is one of the main sources the other studies
583440	586120	were looking at when it came to asthma in children.
586120	591520	Though it might be the case that good ventilation has way less of an impact than I initially
591520	592520	thought.
592520	595240	And it really all is just about what kind of stove you have.
595240	599240	That seems to cover the facts, but nonetheless, you can still find rightoids who are gurgling
599240	603200	about gas stoves being the way it's always been in America, and it needs to keep being
603200	606980	that way, and nobody's died from this before, despite the common trope of a grandma accident
606980	610840	leaving the gas on, or somebody suicidal sticking their head in an oven, and the climate impacts
610840	614160	aren't real, and it's all just leftoids who want to institute a power grab and make
614160	615160	you suffer.
615200	616640	It could be that, for sure.
616640	621240	There is a small possibility of all of this being faked for political reasons, but it's
621240	625640	just as possible that gas stoves are actually really bad for you, and all the pushback from
625640	630080	rightoids is also just a power grab on behalf of the oil industry which wants to keep seeing
630080	634220	those big fat municipal paychecks rolling in for the service of supplying gas lines
634220	638460	to every building in the city, and every culture warrior crying on Twitter is cucking themselves
638460	642040	to big energy and their Republican partners using gas as a kickback system.
642040	647080	It turns out, both sides are capable of conspiratorial thinking, and both sound retarded when doing
647080	648080	it.
648080	650800	The final question remains then, should we ban gas stoves?
650800	654340	Well, it's not like we don't ban other things when we discover they're harmful
654340	655340	to us.
655340	658160	Imagine if we discovered the link between asbestos and cancer in 2023.
658160	662520	Oh my god, there would be a Twitter culture war over it, with people screaming that asbestos
662520	665920	never did nothing wrong and it's all just Biden pushing a climate agenda and all this
665920	666920	other nonsense.
666920	668080	And forget about seatbelts.
668080	670920	There were already people claiming they'd never wear them back when those were first
670920	671920	made mandatory too.
671920	676800	I'll have to detour the town to get to Kalamazoo, if they pass the seatbelt ordinance, I don't
676800	678120	use the seatbelt.
678120	682360	I wouldn't wear my seatbelt, if I get caught, I get caught I guess.
682360	687320	I oppose it on the basis that it replaces the free will of the individual with the desires
687320	688320	of the state.
688320	692320	You can't force people to do things, you know, if they think that it's necessary, they're
692320	694120	poor, if they don't think so.
694120	701600	The question here is whether we have the right, whether we have the responsibility, whether
701600	712640	we have the judgment to turn to the citizens of this state and be there in 1984, big brother.
712640	717120	But all that being said, we also keep around harmful things that we like.
717120	720720	Cigarettes are harmful both to the smoker and those around him, and they're still legal.
720720	723060	Alcohol is probably the most harmful thing in human history.
723060	726040	The vast majority of all rapes and assaults are committed by drunk people.
726040	728280	Half of the victims of those crimes are also drunk.
728280	730800	Health problems, car accidents, you fucking name it.
730800	733240	Alcohol is a major killer, and yet, it's still legal.
733240	737820	I would even describe alcohol as one of the great examples as to how the elites of society
737820	742120	cannot simply dictate their will top-down in a democratic system, much to the chagrin
742120	744760	of the elite theorist, political realist types.
744760	749400	As when prohibition came to an end in America, the elites still wanted alcohol gone, and
749400	752520	yet their ideas were so unpopular, they lost.
752520	756000	Soft drugs like weed are slowly becoming decriminalized or legalized.
756000	759560	And yes, sorry stoners, they do also carry a degree of harm with them.
759560	760920	Burn is harmful but legal.
760920	762640	Gambling is harmful but legal.
762640	767560	The point is, gas stoves being harmful is not enough of a reason to ban them.
767560	772200	It seems to me that it becomes reasonable to ban old technology or practices only through
772200	774000	a specific set of criteria.
774000	775000	1.
775000	779320	If the old technology or practice is significantly harmful and not just to yourself but other
779320	780320	people.
780320	781320	2.
781320	785280	If there is a replacement technology or practice that is just as functional and less harmful.
785280	788640	Being less harmful and significantly less functional is a disqualifier.
788720	789720	3.
789720	793720	If the ban comes with either a grandfather clause or a significantly lengthy activation
793720	794720	period.
794720	797720	Think about these rules for a little bit and you'll realize they probably make sense.
797720	801720	If we invented a cigarette right now that had all the positives of cigarettes, the same
801720	805800	buzz, the same taste, even the same addictive nature, but none of the health problems, it
805800	809780	seems reasonable that our society would ban the old cigarettes from being produced.
809780	812280	If you still had or found the old ones, you could smoke them.
812280	815660	But if your local store only sold the new ones, I don't think it would be this huge
815660	817800	infringement on your rights or anything like that.
817960	821320	The counterargument, of course, is that the powers that be could claim their replacement
821320	825280	technology is just as good, but it actually isn't, and you should just shut up about
825280	826280	it.
826280	829700	That's why you can occasionally find rightoids saying that not only gas stoves good, but
829700	831400	induction stoves bad.
831400	835600	All the positive claims about induction stoves are just propaganda from big induction.
835600	838880	And to their credit, induction does come with a few problems.
838880	842520	Ceramic pots and pans don't work with it, due to electromagnetism requiring metal.
842520	846800	It can mess with some electronic devices, most notably pacemakers and hearing aids.
846800	852240	And oftentimes induction stovetops are touch-activated, making them hard to use with greasy, wet,
852240	853320	or dirty hands.
853320	856960	And they're also often tied into the whole smart home ecosystem, which brings along its
856960	861360	own cyberpunk-esque set of always-online, always-connected dystopian issues.
861360	863560	But it's not like the stoves themselves don't cook your food.
863560	866880	The technology works just fine, and the other problems can be avoided or ironed out.
866880	869360	That doesn't mean that I'm pro-making-everything-induction.
869360	871640	In my opinion, gas stoves shouldn't be banned.
871640	875320	Even though they do cause some harm, it's nowhere near something like smoking or drinking.
875320	877940	If the government wants to offer some sort of financial incentive to switch over to a
877940	881040	non-gas option, that's fine with me, but the people who want gas should be able to
881040	882040	get it.
882040	884920	Probably the worst part about this story, though, is how conservatives and progressives
884920	889560	are slowly brain-damaging each other over time, by associating various cognitive steps
889560	893200	with a particular political coalition, and therefore causing the rival faction to be
893200	895360	less able to think certain thoughts.
895360	898900	Tell me, if you're more right-leaning than me, when I mocked rightoids for thinking that
898900	902580	Biden was coming for your gas stoves, did you feel the knee-jerk reaction to leave a
902580	906120	comment about how stupid I was, how devoted I am to being a moderate, that I can't put
906120	908180	the dots together and see the real story?
908180	911540	If you're more left-leaning than me, when I mocked leftoids for thinking that Republican
911540	915180	support for gas stoves was a cover for their support of the gas industry, and that they
915180	919600	were just using common people's fears, did you feel a similar knee-jerk reaction to leave
919600	920600	a similar comment?
920600	922220	Here's an example of what I'm getting at.
922220	927060	When concepts like free speech or economic growth become attached to the right, it becomes
927060	931540	harder for people who view themselves as left-wing to advocate for those positions, even if it
931540	935540	means forsaking good arguments that are correct by their own definition.
935540	940020	Arguments that are pro-free speech or pro-economic growth that lead to things a left-leaning
940020	945020	person might consider good still end up sticking in their throat because those are right-wing
945020	946360	positions, right-wing ideas.
946360	948960	And this concept works in reverse too, obviously.
948960	952720	Pollution is bad or climate change is bad has become attached to the left, and people
952720	956820	who view themselves as right-wing seem to also have a hard time adopting an argument
956820	960360	that would help the right but also accepts the left-wing presupposition that pollution
960360	961360	is bad.
961360	965540	The result is that certain ideas, even if they're correct, become locked away mentally
965540	966760	for the partisan.
966760	968020	Mental habits are reinforced.
968020	971740	I can't make a free speech argument that's right-wing, or I can't make an environmental
971740	975900	argument that's left-wing, when what we should be doing is making not left arguments
975900	978500	or right arguments, but good arguments.
978500	982660	The gas stove story is honestly not a big deal, but everyone's reaction to it shows
982660	985500	you just how brain-rotted all these people are.
985500	989420	Don't be afraid to use the arguments of your opponents if they're actually correct.
989420	990980	Don't just react.
990980	991980	Think.
