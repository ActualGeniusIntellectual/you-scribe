0	7720	We're back for another round of Lord of the Rings, the Rings of Power.
7720	9760	This time, Arch is with us.
9760	11760	How are you doing, Arch?
11760	12760	Thick.
12760	13760	Still recovering.
13760	20360	Are you still recovering, Arch, are you okay?
20360	23880	Death is no longer near, but it is in the vicinity.
23880	28920	So before we get into anything else, I would just like to quickly touch base with you,
28920	29920	Arch.
29920	33280	TLDR, what did you think of the last episode?
33280	37240	The creation of Mount Doom.
37240	40300	Everything's got to have an origin story, Arch, we have to explain everything.
40300	43840	I mean, we actually know how Mount Doom was created, but details.
43840	45080	Wait, did we actually?
45080	46760	What's the lore on that?
46760	48240	It was created by Morgoth.
48240	52720	Uh-uh, not according to the show, Arch.
52720	55240	Morgoth didn't create it, it was the water.
55240	56440	The water made it.
56440	58160	That was a big splash.
58200	64400	That's one of those problems, because in the actual story, Mount Doom was created by literal
64400	69240	Satan, which gives it power, which is why it's the only place the ring could be created.
69240	74120	Now it's just a volcano, which means the ring could have been destroyed wherever.
74120	78520	Like, Gandalf could have made a fire and that would have fixed the whole problem.
78520	79520	Maybe...
79520	80520	Definitely made it a lot less special.
80520	81520	Yeah.
81520	85680	Maybe somebody, maybe a wizard will be walking by one day and like drop his magic potions
85680	87640	and do it accidentally and make it special.
87640	89640	It's like, oops!
89640	92440	You know what they'll do?
92440	94000	They'll throw the Harfoots in there.
94000	95600	That's how they did it.
95600	96600	Yeah.
96600	101520	As soon as Sauron, that's Sauron, Jesus, as soon as Sauron regains his senses, and is
101520	106300	like, oh, I'm actually a person, he'll lead the Harfoots over and just dump them in.
106300	107300	That's how it'll work.
107300	109320	Now hold on, was this a Freudian slip?
109320	113400	Like Sauron's like the great evil, like what are you doing, dude?
113400	114400	No one tell them.
114880	117680	Mordor just turned Mordor into a giant Applebee's.
117680	122600	Look, I finished outloading the episode.
122600	125840	You already torrented it while we were doing our little preamble intro?
125840	126840	Oh shit.
126840	127840	Wait, hold on.
127840	128840	Wait, Arch!
128840	130280	Is your internet fast now?
130280	131280	Yes.
131280	136380	A nice man came to my house and he put a cable inside of my house and I'm using that cable
136380	140600	to transmit lights at a high speed and this light turns into information.
140600	145160	You finally got fiber optic out in the wilderness of Norway.
145160	150160	Another bit of news on the ratings front, because we've talked about ratings a few times
150160	151940	over the course of this series.
151940	153680	This was published.
153680	159480	Amazon's Rings of Power isn't making as big of a splash as HBO's House of the Dragon,
159480	163800	and it shows the potential risks of dueling big budget fantasy shows.
163800	169240	This does seem to be a thing that everyone's saying now that both shows have been, they've
169240	172600	been getting through their stories and the seasons are kind of coming to a close.
172600	177480	I've been watching both of them and I have to say, as a whole package, House of the Dragon
177480	182640	is so much better than Rings of Power, it's not even funny.
182640	183640	Still shit though.
183640	187720	I'd rather, I'd rather watch The Next Generation or something old.
187720	191840	What, you mean Degrassi The Next Generation, Kibs?
191840	193280	Hold on.
193280	195280	Sit down, Dev.
195280	201800	Well, first of all, I don't, I don't know that lore nearly is as much, so what's happening
201800	204720	in that show is still kind of surprising me a bit.
204720	211400	Secondly, they just seem to have that Game of Thrones edge that, you know, they're willing
211400	214720	to do a few things that Lord of the Rings is probably never going to be willing to do.
214720	223160	Like for example, having an underage niece and an uncle fuck, that's like, all right,
223160	224160	fair enough.
225040	227840	It was the medieval period, I get it.
227840	231160	Everyone's comparing them in terms of like popularity, right?
231160	235640	And it, it really seemed like when Amazon was talking about, you know, the 25 million
235640	241560	viewers in the first episode, they were really trying to take a stab at HBO over this, because
241560	243800	these are the two shows that are competing right now.
243800	250080	There was a leak from, you guys know who Overlord is on YouTube?
250080	251360	I'm sure you do, Arch.
251360	252360	No?
252360	253360	Okay.
253360	258160	Well, he, he has reliably leaked things from the industry before.
258160	262840	He can't, he doesn't reveal a source because they're in Hollywood, but he has reliably
262840	265560	leaked things, things that turned out to be true.
265560	273760	And he is saying that he has an inside word that Amazon's first episode numbers were 9.5
273760	277720	million and then they dropped by half for episode three.
277720	281200	So not the 25 that everyone's saying.
281200	282720	See that is the problem.
282760	291480	We have no actually genuinely reliable information because first we're told like a 1.8 million,
291480	292960	but that wasn't all devices.
292960	293960	Okay.
293960	298320	And House of the Dragon had more than that, more than that at 4.8, then we're told 25
298320	299320	million.
299320	300320	All right.
300320	301320	That's one fuck of a leap.
301320	304000	And now it's like nine, but it's, was cut in half.
304000	309120	Meanwhile, uh, House of Dragons, I've seen the numbers go drastically down to the point
309120	311960	now they're talking about maybe only a million million.
312000	313000	Okay.
313000	319800	Like, what do we believe if I can House of Dragons right now is like a zero one point
319800	323240	over cyberpunk edge runners, which I just watched the other day.
323240	326000	Like there is no comparing those two shows.
326000	327000	I haven't seen that.
327000	328000	Is that good?
328000	330840	It is very good.
330840	333940	Barge is also in the desperate camp I see.
333940	339200	It seems to be the case that like quasi indie animation has really taken off.
339200	343000	Finally, we're getting out of the CalArts era and into some decent stuff.
343000	344000	Hold on.
344000	345000	That's not indie.
345000	346000	Fuck.
346000	347000	Yeah, no.
347000	348000	That's triple A.
348000	349800	Studio Trigger is not an indie studio.
349800	351600	Oh, is that who's doing it?
351600	352600	Okay.
352600	353600	Nevermind.
353600	354600	Jesus.
354600	355600	All right.
355600	358520	They got a lot of flack for recycling a lot of similar, well, let's just say things were
358520	360240	similar in designs.
360240	363160	Oh, I was thinking of the League of Legends show.
363160	364160	Nevermind.
364160	365160	Okay.
365160	366160	Oh yeah.
367160	370880	The story in Arcane is not amazing.
370880	374600	It's quite standard, but the animation quality is beyond this world.
374600	377040	Also the dragon is better.
377040	378040	It's a soap opera though.
378040	379040	Yeah, it is.
379040	380040	It is.
380040	381040	It needs like a Tyrion.
381040	383760	It needs a Tyrion character to lighten the mood sometimes, but it's mostly a pretty good
383760	384760	show so far.
384760	387880	I also think it needs more like variety in the storytelling.
387880	388880	Yes.
388880	389880	Yeah.
389880	390880	But you know what?
390880	392880	Considering how shit everything else has been, I'll take it.
392880	393880	Yeah, no.
393880	394880	Wow.
394880	395880	Settling for less.
396600	397600	Yeah.
397600	398600	Sometimes you have to man.
398600	399960	This is literally the problem.
399960	404520	The reason why House of Dragon has like an 8.7 score, which is ridiculous for that piece
404520	408440	of shit show is because of people who are like Dev who's like, everything's shocked.
408440	412040	Not just Dev, that boss too.
412040	418320	Like, wow, this cereal only has 75% horse feces in it.
418320	419320	Amazing.
419320	423920	I compare, I only mostly notice it.
423960	430720	He can feel the fucking half digested oats crunch, but doing these teething still chewing.
430720	432720	Could be worse.
432720	442000	Dev, it could be worse, at least you're not Anthony Burch.
442000	443000	It could be worse.
443000	446460	You might be watching Rings of Power.
446460	448240	I actually enjoy House of the Dragon.
448240	449560	I don't know why you think it's shit, Arch.
449560	450760	I think it's actually like half decent.
450760	451760	I'm enjoying it.
451800	454280	I enjoyed the part where the children were killing one another.
454280	458400	I quite liked that, but beyond that, I liked very little.
458400	459400	Really?
459400	461160	Pacing for me.
461160	462840	Very stupid show.
462840	463840	It's so fast.
463840	466480	What is it, stupid?
466480	470000	Every single episode has commenced with an enormous time skip.
470000	472840	The smallest of which has been a measly six months.
472840	473840	Yeah.
473840	478720	I mean, it's because like in the book, it's just like almost bullet points and there's
478720	485360	like a lot of history and they're really trying to like expand it as much as possible.
485360	489840	I think they can just slow down the pacing and make it a longer series.
489840	493200	I height almost every single casting choice.
493200	499240	You have young Raheamon, who looks like fetal alcohol syndrome, the advertisement.
499240	504480	You have Daemon, who's just, his face is weird and I don't like it.
504480	509440	The king is rotting and yet he refuses to fucking die, even though they've been like,
509440	512680	oh, he's dead like seven times now.
512680	516800	And then there's the goddamn Valerians, who are all black now, which annoys me because
516800	520400	her children aren't black and nobody seems to be raising this point.
520400	523560	It's like, hold on, your children are the wrong color, Raheamon.
523560	524560	This is suspicious.
524560	526840	And the king is like, no, you can't say that.
526840	531960	But seriously, though, yeah, that was the clip from Gordon Ramsay.
531960	533400	It's black.
533400	536560	The worst part is about, this is in the House of the Dragon show or something, but I'm just
536560	539560	going to, you know, as a quick aside.
539560	546420	The worst part is, is the reason they made the Valerians black is because the main character
546420	551560	of the Valerians, the grandfather of the entire clan, Corallus Valerian, he was described
551560	554440	as having like olive or tan skin.
554440	560560	Not because he was black, but because he was the only person from that family to like sail
560560	561560	around the world.
561560	562560	And he spent a lot of time on ships.
562560	563560	He was very tanned.
563560	566840	He spent a lot of time outdoors.
566840	570360	And there's like pictures of like, there's like lore pictures of him from the other books.
570360	573920	And he's standing with like other people from Westeros, and he's clearly darker than the
573920	574960	rest of them.
574960	576880	But he's not black.
576880	584840	And I think that that that really just seemed to be shoehorning representation and of course,
584840	590560	his entire clan is black now, like the Valerians are black, it just means they get to pass.
590560	594840	It also means we get to hear that fucking ancient annoying defense again, like what
594840	597040	dragons are okay, but not black people.
597040	598040	Yes.
598040	599040	Yes.
599040	601760	In a universe where dragons are literally more commonplace than like people.
601760	602760	Yes.
602760	607000	It's not even just the Valerians, there's random extras who are black and it just annoys
607000	609480	me these days because I look at that.
609480	613280	And I think to myself, that was a boardroom decision, not a writing one.
613280	617360	And yeah, for me, it ruins my interest in the show because I'm like, okay, well, this
617360	618360	is political.
618360	620360	I don't want that.
620360	623200	These black person, they ruined.
623200	624200	Yes.
624200	625200	Oh, God.
625200	630000	At least in medieval England, it's like, hello, hi, how did you come here?
630000	631200	Very long thought, right?
631200	633400	Are we are we a show full of racists?
633400	634400	Yes.
634400	639600	All I'm saying is that when I was at what it is, I love Jews too.
639600	644400	I am going to make a Shaka Zulu TV show and there's going to be one white person in Shaka's
644400	645400	army.
645400	646440	No one will ever mention him.
646440	650440	He'll just be there in every single fucking scene.
650440	652080	Just in the background, hanging out.
652080	653080	Yep.
653080	654080	He's going to look like everybody else.
654080	657840	He's going to have his cowhide shield and he's going to be pale as fuck and a ginger
657840	663840	and nobody's ever going to mention it.
663840	666600	Taftaz is just like quietly like, I don't want to get canceled.
666600	667600	I can't say anything.
667600	668600	I can't afford.
668600	670000	I'm just starting my channel.
670000	671000	I can't.
671000	674320	I think I've already been canceled for lots of things.
674320	675920	Oh, yeah, that's true.
675920	678360	I've, I've seen some of your debates regarding trans issues.
678360	681320	I know what's going on.
681320	690420	So someone who watches us actually bought that cringy elf ears shirt.
690420	695800	It's I mean, it's not, it's not a bad shirt, but it's very clearly just like a regular
695800	700840	blue shirt that you might get for five cents from China with this shit just printed right
700840	701840	on top of it.
701840	705600	And it'll wash out after about a year or two going through the washing machine.
705600	709720	Well, like most diversity, it doesn't stand up to water well.
709720	714280	Oh, my God, Arch, you are going to get my channel fucking banned.
714280	718360	Arch is racist.
718360	719360	You know this.
719360	720660	We all know this.
720660	725220	I guess the final thing I'll point out before we get on the road here is I did a video maybe
725220	730680	a year ago looking at like the initial Vanity Fair expose, it was an expose.
730720	733000	It was what was it like a preview of the show.
733000	735720	As I was making that video, I dug into why this was happening.
735720	740440	And basically what happened was Tolkien's son died because Tolkien's son wasn't letting
740440	741960	any of this shit happen.
741960	744060	But as soon as he died, the floodgates kind of opened.
744060	750320	And then back in like 2015 or 2016, Amazon quietly bought a bunch just dropped a bunch
750320	755040	of money to get to pick up the series and like quietly started beginning making this.
755040	760280	This came out just a few days ago on The Hollywood Reporter.
760280	764680	This is an interview with some people who are showrunners of the show, and they're talking
764680	769240	about season two and, you know, the poor fan reception and all this.
769240	771740	But one nugget right in the middle of it.
771740	777760	Basically back while the series was still, you know, safely, safely guarded by those
777760	779560	who care about it.
779560	783120	Netflix actually pitched a show before Amazon got involved.
783120	789080	And Netflix said their plan was to basically turn it into Marvel where they're going to
789080	794800	have like, they're going to have like multiple different properties happening at once.
794800	799360	They were going to do like a Gandalf side series, they were going to do an Aragorn series,
799360	803460	they were just going to do, they're just going to give everyone their own show and just do
803460	808440	like an extended universe that like interweaves very Marvel, very Marvel like because the
808440	810500	Tolkien estate was still in charge of things.
810500	813040	They were immediately like, Oh my God, we can never let any of these people ever do
813040	814040	any of this.
814040	817640	We can't, we have to like, and they cut off everyone, they're like, Nope, nope, not doing
817640	818640	anything.
818640	819640	Nope.
819640	820640	Fuck you.
820640	821640	I don't care how much money you give us.
821640	822640	No.
822640	823640	And that basically persisted until Tolkien's son died.
823640	827760	I have a feeling that Amazon might have the same like long term vision for this.
827760	830880	Oh, without a doubt, this is just the beginning.
830880	831880	Yeah.
831880	836640	The thing is, we already know the Rings of Power is a flop from Amazon's point of view,
836640	837640	but very interesting.
837640	840960	And I'll make a video about this probably for Friday.
840960	844360	Because recently, you know, they've been shooting all this in New Zealand, etc.
844360	845840	It's been really expensive.
845840	851580	And they've said that all this is going to cost like $5 billion for the five seasons.
851580	856840	Very quietly, they've sold all of their studio equipment in New Zealand, and they've moved
856840	863280	to London now where they will be starting to shoot just inside of a regular studio.
863280	866720	Oh, quiet.
866720	871880	So in all due likelihood, Amazon has given up and but they can't cancel it.
871880	873760	They know they can't cancel it.
873760	879560	So they've shifted them off to some dark back corner office in London and just make
879560	880560	movie.
880560	885560	Well, actually, this is something that I saw another media recently, what they often do
885560	890240	now rather than go to locations, they did this, I think he did it in London, and they
890240	894120	did it for the Mandalorian is they'll actually computer generate an entire landscape.
894120	897600	However, it's not like they just insert them on a green screen and put them in front of
897600	898600	it.
898600	899600	They don't they don't do that anymore.
899600	900600	Because that looks kind of fake.
900600	903660	And you know, it is fake, what they'll do almost like a VR headset, they'll 360 view
903660	909320	an entire computer generated landscape, and then project that onto a dome and the actor
909320	912240	goes into the dome and then acts the scene.
912240	915740	So it looks like that they're outside, but they're not.
915740	920380	And the acting dome, the acting apparently, it's really hard to do this.
920380	922460	It's hard on the people working on the set.
922460	927620	Because if you don't, it's it's tuned to exactly where the actor is in the dome.
927620	932160	And if you're not where he is, or where the camera is, or the camera is, if you're not
932160	936200	in the exact spot, all the images like just look distorted because you're looking at them
936200	937960	from the wrong angle.
937960	942820	Everyone who works in the acting dome is getting like motion sickness and shit.
942820	944440	But that's how it rather than going to places.
944440	946000	That's how they're shooting these now.
946000	947560	Fuck actors.
947560	950560	It's better than getting shot on set, I guess.
950560	957640	I hope they get put into the wage cages to Jesus arch arch, you're relentless tonight
957640	958640	people.
958640	966800	So I've got my my mug, piping full of piping hot soup broth, as I do in the evenings.
966800	970560	That's just just chicken noodle.
970560	972960	Just put it in there and boil it up.
972960	974700	And no longer to drink coffee at nights anymore.
974700	976880	So but kids, I think it's time.
976880	979680	It's time for us to watch the eyes.
979680	981720	Oh my god, an hour and 12 minutes.
981720	983560	I'm never going to bed.
983560	984560	Let's go.
984560	988120	Because we're gonna see the eye of Sauron in it.
988120	990040	Honestly, probably that obvious.
990040	992080	Oh, for God's sake.
992080	994680	Oh, look, the legend of Vox Maxima.
994680	995680	I tried to use that.
995680	996680	It was not very good.
996680	998800	No, I don't know why you did.
998800	1003960	But then again, your tastes are, but I was desperate.
1003960	1004960	Recap skip.
1004960	1007640	Oh boy, we're gonna see the Harfoot's again.
1007640	1009360	I miss those guys.
1009360	1011760	I don't.
1011760	1014880	Oh, Jesus.
1014880	1016920	That sounds like it was your fetish tap Tash.
1016960	1018960	Oh, the Harfoot's.
1018960	1020960	I'm so happy.
1020960	1022960	Oh, dirty eye.
1022960	1023960	Gross.
1023960	1025960	Yeah, now, Galadriel is dead, by the way.
1025960	1026960	I don't accept this.
1026960	1027960	Yeah.
1027960	1028960	Yeah.
1028960	1029960	She's dead.
1029960	1030960	She would not be alive.
1030960	1031960	She's an L.
1031960	1032960	She's an L.
1032960	1033960	Oh, yeah.
1033960	1034960	So that actually reminds me.
1034960	1039840	There was a video on, like, I think on LiveLeak at one point.
1039840	1045160	And it was just a Russian guy who gets like an explosion goes off in his face.
1045520	1049960	And you can tell by the way he's speaking that he singed the inside of his lungs.
1049960	1052080	And he's like, I'm totally fine, guys.
1052080	1053160	Don't worry about it.
1053160	1057160	But with the way that those injuries go is as soon as your lungs start to swell, you're
1057160	1058160	just gonna die.
1058160	1060160	You have like 20 minutes to live, and that's it.
1060160	1063180	And it's kind of grotesque being on a ticking time bomb like that.
1063180	1067040	But that's what happens to everyone who gets like a fireball of ash in the face.
1067040	1069720	And everyone should be dead.
1069720	1070720	Everyone is dead.
1070720	1073920	The rest of the show is just a fever dream.
1074680	1076680	Very before death, yep.
1077680	1079680	Oh, the flaming horse!
1081680	1082680	Runner or no.
1082680	1083680	God dammit.
1083680	1087680	It had one chance to make its life worth something.
1087680	1089680	I mean, they did the right thing.
1089680	1091680	You know, died.
1092680	1095680	Well, we'll see about that.
1095680	1100680	These are the corpses of all the people banned from Twitch for saying Cracker.
1100680	1102680	No, these are all the banned reviews.
1103440	1108440	Lake has been warm enough for wood to spontaneously combust, but humans are still fine in this
1108440	1109440	area.
1109440	1111440	Yeah, it's a bit much.
1111440	1113440	All the water would have been boiled out of you instantly.
1113440	1114440	Oh, cool.
1114440	1115440	Even the babies are alive.
1115440	1116440	Impressive.
1116440	1119440	You know, we've always been told that babies are fragile and you shouldn't drop them on
1119440	1121440	the ground, but clearly they're quite sturdy.
1121440	1126440	I think this would be a big problem, but it turns out it's actually not.
1126440	1132440	Have I ever told any of you that I was actually unironically dropped as a baby?
1133200	1135200	No, but your behavior is sort of made again.
1135200	1140200	My dad put me on the kitchen counter to answer a phone call, and I immediately rolled off.
1143200	1145200	You are going to use that against you, Dev.
1145200	1148200	Oh my god, they're just walking past burning people?
1148200	1149200	Wow.
1149200	1151200	You're not going to throw something on that guy?
1151200	1153200	Heroes, ladies and gentlemen.
1153200	1155200	It's like, help, I'm burning to death slowly.
1155200	1158200	I like how every named character is okay.
1158200	1160200	Well, of course.
1160960	1161960	My queen, you're black.
1161960	1162960	Surely you must be fire resistant.
1162960	1163960	Lift.
1165960	1166960	Jesus.
1166960	1167960	Ah, the queen had to do it.
1167960	1168960	Wait, Arch.
1168960	1169960	The woman had to do it.
1169960	1171960	Arch, first water, now fire.
1171960	1174960	What the fuck is with you and black people and the elements?
1174960	1177960	Well, no, I said diversity doesn't survive water.
1177960	1181960	Black people survive fire, as you can clearly see by this show.
1181960	1182960	Other friend died.
1182960	1183960	Oh no.
1183960	1185960	Oh no, I'm just saying.
1185960	1188960	Prophecy didn't really make us care about that character in your show.
1189720	1191720	I don't kill anything.
1191720	1193720	Oh, was that supposed to be a character we know?
1193720	1196720	That's the other friend in the trio friend group.
1196720	1199720	Yeah, it's the third guy that never got named.
1201720	1203720	The AK red shirt of the friend group.
1206720	1208720	Oh no, the death of other friend.
1208720	1212720	His actor's like, this'll totally launch my career, guys.
1215720	1218720	I think that was symbolic of what happened to his career for being in the show.
1219480	1221480	Yep, this entire situation.
1222480	1226480	This is actually just the Amazon HQ right now that we're looking at.
1227480	1230480	I mean, yeah, when the reviews came in.
1231480	1233480	And Bezos is just inside.
1233480	1234480	Everything's fine.
1234480	1235480	It's okay.
1236480	1238480	Wait, why is there a fireball?
1238480	1240480	Because that's how fire functions die.
1240480	1242480	He wasn't important.
1242480	1244480	No, no, he's fine.
1244480	1246480	Because AZ is over.
1247240	1249240	Nice, yeah.
1251240	1253240	Oh yay, what a transition.
1254240	1256240	Wish he had some of this water, eh?
1259240	1261240	There's slaves back there.
1261240	1263240	They just leave him alone.
1263240	1265240	I will laugh if everyone knows.
1265240	1267240	Yes, I was about to say it's all going to be burnt to shit.
1267240	1269240	There you go.
1269240	1271240	How did you guys fuck this up?
1271240	1273240	Well, they were back in Bragg and then suddenly...
1273240	1275240	Ah, the rocks.
1276000	1278000	Oh.
1278000	1281000	That's a long flight, but...
1284000	1288000	Wait, do you think that we're going to see Ents in this show?
1292000	1294000	I feel like we already have.
1294000	1296000	Oh, maybe.
1300000	1302000	I don't know about that, dude.
1306000	1308000	Well, he almost fixed it.
1308000	1310000	Wait, hold on.
1310000	1312000	Here, Kibbs, if you don't mind, go back a bit.
1312000	1314000	There.
1314000	1317000	Yeah, I'm pretty sure he pushed her under the tree.
1317000	1319000	Look at the wood.
1319000	1322000	I feel like whoever made the show hasn't ever seen burning wood before.
1322000	1325000	Because that's just wood painted black.
1325000	1327000	You mean it's been diversified?
1327000	1329000	It is diversified.
1329000	1331000	It only burns from the edge.
1331000	1333000	Yeah, it's not actually burnt wood.
1333000	1335000	It's not burnt wood!
1335760	1337760	It's painted dried wood.
1337760	1340760	It wouldn't even be asked to burn the wood.
1343760	1345760	Oh my god.
1345760	1348760	I know that I come from a small town, right?
1348760	1353760	But even city kids have to do a campfire once in a while, right?
1353760	1356760	Or they've seen something burn, right?
1356760	1358760	I don't know enough.
1358760	1361760	I went to camping once or twice.
1361760	1363760	Okay.
1364520	1368520	If it's burnt like that bad, then normally what happens is the inside's also black or ash.
1368520	1371520	Yeah, everything's just ash, and it crumbles.
1371520	1373520	And it's very dry.
1373520	1375520	This is just clearly painted wood.
1375520	1378520	Why should we trust any elf?
1378520	1380520	Why shouldn't you?
1380520	1383520	All this fucking retarded elf hate.
1383520	1386520	Aren't you guys already working together?
1386520	1389520	But Elrond half elf.
1389520	1391520	Ah, he's half elf.
1391520	1393520	He's a bastard.
1394280	1397280	Wait, was Elrond always a half elf?
1397280	1399280	No.
1399280	1401280	How to talk to short people.
1401280	1404280	How to talk to short people.
1407280	1409280	I hate this entire plotline.
1409280	1411280	Like, Mithril wasn't... this isn't Mithril.
1411280	1413280	Like, they knew about Mithril before this.
1413280	1417280	They were making shit out of Mithril before this.
1417280	1420280	Don't be bothered by it. It's not Lord of the Rings.
1421040	1424040	So Kibbs, I've noticed whenever you move the mouse,
1424040	1427040	over top of the feed,
1427040	1431040	you get a nice little handy list of all the people
1431040	1436040	in the side who will never get an acting job again after the show bombs.
1437040	1440040	I mean, I like the x-ray function when I'm watching good shows.
1440040	1442040	This is useless here.
1442040	1444040	I don't care about any of these.
1444040	1448040	The fate of the elves was decided many ages ago.
1448800	1451800	My mind's much wiser,
1451800	1454800	much farther-seeing than our own.
1454800	1456800	You know, the Amazon Rising stuff.
1458800	1462800	You know, the elves are still pretty long-lived.
1462800	1466800	And you're gonna be king one day. You can just do it.
1471800	1474800	He just put his hand on the molten piece of metal.
1474800	1476800	He did, yes.
1478800	1480800	No, at least it was covered good.
1480800	1482800	I was about to say she was holding that piece of molten metal,
1482800	1484800	but no, there was a little thing wrapped around it.
1484800	1487800	When she put it in, there was no bubbling.
1487800	1492800	It was just fake steam and the ripple of putting a cold thing into water.
1492800	1496800	Otherwise, she'd have to hold onto something molten, which would hurt.
1496800	1499800	I'm sorry, elf. We Jews cannot give you your shiny ox.
1499800	1502800	I just come back in like 15 years when our king is dead.
1502800	1504800	Yeah.
1504800	1506800	Because dwarves don't live that long, do they?
1507560	1509560	They live the same amount of time as regular people.
1509560	1511560	I think they live a bit longer.
1511560	1517560	Also, the problem with this mysterious unknown fucking random-ass magic disease
1517560	1520560	is that they have given us no frame of reference for this.
1520560	1522560	Like, they're saying, like,
1522560	1524560	we'll all be dead tomorrow. Like, why?
1524560	1527560	Like, I thought this was a slow creeping corruption or something.
1527560	1530560	You're giving me your crack cocaine.
1530560	1532560	Please hit your head on the door.
1532560	1535560	The scene is so undermined by the plot, it's not even funny.
1536320	1540320	You know, I liked the elves and the dwarves shit, but I hate this
1540320	1542320	because it's just magic macguffin.
1542320	1545320	Like, ah, shiny rock under mountain, make elves live longer.
1545320	1547320	Why? What? How? When?
1547320	1550320	Also, surely the elves can go mine it themselves.
1550320	1552320	They know what it is now.
1552320	1554320	My god, symbolism.
1554320	1556320	Yep, look at that. Suddenly the leaf is like, I'm getting better now.
1560320	1562320	Yep.
1563080	1567080	The magic rock literally un-rots the leaf.
1567080	1570080	Oh god, this is very dumb.
1570080	1573080	The leaf gets up and starts walking, dancing.
1573080	1576080	They're very dramatic about it, too.
1576080	1581080	To be fair, if I saw a leaf de-age before my eyes, I'd be like, ugh.
1583080	1586080	You have to put those in the anti-aging creams.
1586080	1589080	Yeah, but magic space rock works.
1593080	1595080	It's magic tree rock, actually.
1595080	1597080	Ah, good. Back to death and destruction.
1599080	1603080	The show livens up a lot when the bad people are dying.
1603080	1605080	Wait, when did...
1605080	1608080	When did Theo get with Galadriel?
1609080	1611080	When they started walking together, I guess.
1611080	1613080	Last burning place. She picked him out of the wreckage and was like,
1613080	1616080	random person, come with me.
1616080	1618080	I don't know why our characters need to talk to each other,
1618080	1621080	because you're really nobody, but I need you to accompany me now.
1621840	1623840	It's like, okay.
1623840	1625840	It says here in the script, oh, okay, gotcha.
1627840	1629840	This is so forced.
1629840	1631840	Also, apparently the orcs survived this shit just fine.
1631840	1634840	I guess they are naturally resistant to fire.
1634840	1636840	They're orky borkies, Arch.
1636840	1639840	Orky borkies are impervious to many things.
1639840	1641840	That's a lot of survivors.
1641840	1644840	Yo, what the fuck? Everyone should be dead.
1645840	1647840	Yet nobody is.
1648600	1651600	We saw a few bad people, so it's fine.
1651600	1655600	I think everyone just likes the visual of
1655600	1658600	a snowstorm of ash.
1658600	1661600	Because they did kind of the same thing with Game of Thrones, right?
1661600	1663600	Four horses, right?
1663600	1665600	I left your son to die, because I'm
1665600	1667600	kind of shit at this whole queening thing.
1671600	1673600	It's fine, he's fine.
1674600	1676600	He still has to say no.
1677360	1679360	Yeah.
1679360	1681360	He's still plot relevant.
1681360	1683360	Also, I'm pretty sure her plate armor should be very, very
1683360	1685360	warm at this point.
1685360	1687360	Yeah.
1687360	1689360	A little bit uncomfortable.
1689360	1691360	They cast heat metal on it.
1691360	1693360	The ash that's collecting on it, making it even warmer.
1693360	1695360	Hold on, Numenor set their camp?
1695360	1697360	I thought they just galloped in the whole fucking way.
1697360	1699360	No, no, no. You must understand.
1699360	1701360	Dev, plot says camp.
1701360	1703360	Okay.
1703360	1705360	Numenorians established a base on the perimeter of the ash.
1706120	1708120	The orcs will move in daylight now.
1708120	1710120	No, they won't.
1710120	1712120	This is how the orcs should move.
1712120	1714120	This is how they do it.
1714120	1716120	No, they do it by a fucking magic.
1716120	1718120	The clouds that cover the orcs
1718120	1720120	when they are invading the world of Men
1720120	1723120	isn't ash, it's fucking magic.
1723120	1725120	Yeah, didn't Sauron summon
1725120	1727120	thunderclouds, basically?
1728120	1730120	It's fine, there's enough ash for them
1730120	1732120	to move through the daylight.
1732120	1734120	They explained it.
1734880	1736880	Yes, give the child your primary means
1736880	1738880	of defense after talking about how the orcs
1738880	1740880	can move in daylight now.
1740880	1742880	Thank you for handing me this, Swede.
1742880	1744880	I have no training whatsoever.
1744880	1746880	I'm far more likely to cut myself
1746880	1748880	rather than the enemy, but thanks anyways.
1748880	1750880	Yeah, swords are actually fairly
1750880	1752880	tricky weapons.
1752880	1754880	Wait, did she have two of them?
1754880	1756880	No, she just gave him
1756880	1758880	her only weapon.
1758880	1760880	Oh no, she has that knife.
1760880	1762880	The ice climbing knife.
1763640	1765640	I've downgraded my equipment to crap here.
1765640	1767640	You're level 2,
1767640	1769640	have this level 16 sword.
1769640	1771640	She has to level her knife skills.
1771640	1773640	It looks even worse when it's dirty.
1773640	1775640	How much further should we reach the encampment?
1777640	1779640	Are we there yet?
1779640	1781640	I know this is slow, isn't it?
1781640	1783640	Were you not there
1783640	1785640	when you set it up, Queen?
1787640	1789640	I have the Breaking Bad looks.
1789640	1791640	I was expecting her to hit her face again.
1791640	1793640	I thought they were going to have to like, thwap.
1797640	1799640	My queen, stop asking questions.
1799640	1801640	She really is just complaining, Jesus.
1802640	1804640	Freaking whiny ass little queen, Christ's sake.
1816640	1818640	She's blind!
1821640	1823640	She doesn't.
1825640	1827640	I do kind of feel bad for her.
1836640	1838640	Okay, that shot looked like
1838640	1840640	they were just walking through a regular forest
1840640	1842640	and they just kind of tinted it grey.
1842640	1844640	Like,
1844640	1846640	like a version of Day for Night.
1846640	1848640	But instead of blue, it was like
1848640	1850640	red and grey.
1851640	1853640	I was going to see that a part of the tree
1853640	1855640	is healed or something.
1855640	1857640	We're not going to see it.
1857640	1859640	There we go.
1859640	1861640	It's a flower now.
1861640	1863640	The flower's coming out.
1863640	1865640	The thing is, he's done as much bad
1865640	1867640	as he's done good.
1867640	1869640	Precisely because they don't want it to be obvious.
1869640	1871640	The problem is, if you do that,
1871640	1873640	it also means that there's no actual
1873640	1875640	building of the character.
1875640	1877640	It's just building of the plot.
1877640	1879640	Like, if this guy is a wizard now,
1881640	1883640	he's done so much fucking damage
1883640	1885640	to the half-woods.
1885640	1887640	Like, by bumbling around.
1887640	1889640	He's almost killed the few of them a couple of times.
1889640	1891640	He's almost frozen that chick's hands off.
1893640	1895640	Not to mention killing all of the Fireflies
1895640	1897640	with his bullshit magic.
1897640	1899640	And I can gather more.
1899640	1901640	But he's a confused hobble myth.
1901640	1903640	Yeah, it's not his fault.
1903640	1905640	He didn't know any better.
1905640	1907640	Listen, Lilith, you're in...
1907640	1909640	I will use it to keep the
1909640	1911640	doctors away.
1911640	1913640	Lilith, you're in California, right?
1913640	1915640	You probably see like a dozen guys like that a day
1915640	1917640	all bumbling around.
1917640	1919640	I've seen the videos.
1919640	1921640	They're walking around on fentanyl or whatever.
1921640	1923640	They be in downtown.
1925640	1927640	Is she
1927640	1929640	sharpening the wooden wheel with a rock?
1929640	1931640	Yep.
1931640	1933640	What?
1933640	1935640	It's like a spirit.
1937640	1939640	Everything's just an allegory
1939640	1941640	to the other movies and the books.
1941640	1943640	It's terrible.
1943640	1945640	This show has nothing original about it.
1945640	1947640	Does that remind you of the movie?
1947640	1949640	She's sharpening the wheel
1949640	1951640	with the rock.
1951640	1953640	Why?
1953640	1955640	Because she needs to do something on the set
1955640	1957640	that makes it look like she's doing something.
1957640	1959640	Simple.
1959640	1961640	So they hand her a rock, they hand her a wheel.
1961640	1963640	Here, rub this rock against the wheel.
1963640	1965640	It'll make you look, uh, working.
1965640	1967640	Trust me, you'll get a job after this.
1967640	1969640	Are you sure?
1969640	1971640	Jesus, I thought...
1971640	1973640	I tuned out there
1973640	1975640	for a minute and I thought you were doing like a casting
1975640	1977640	couch thing.
1977640	1979640	I was thinking about it.
1983640	1985640	It's like, kid, I just met you five
1985640	1987640	minutes ago.
1991640	1993640	How do you
1993640	1995640	know what happened?
1995640	1997640	Yeah.
1997640	1999640	Yeah, don't really know.
1999640	2001640	Oh, I should have known that the old guy would turn
2001640	2003640	the damn thing.
2003640	2005640	And that he had the sword
2005640	2007640	to begin with?
2007640	2009640	What?
2009640	2011640	All he knows is that he didn't have it.
2011640	2013640	Yes, this is one mighty
2013640	2015640	ass fucking leap of logic here.
2015640	2017640	Like, I don't have a sword, a volcano explodes.
2017640	2019640	Uh huh.
2021640	2023640	Oh hey, the orcs arrived. Lucky.
2023640	2025640	I guess that's
2025640	2027640	why they had to take them prisoners so that
2027640	2029640	they could live to threaten the party later.
2029640	2031640	The orcs
2031640	2033640	just smell them.
2033640	2035640	Yeah, they should be able to, eh?
2035640	2037640	The orc sense
2037640	2039640	of smell varies considerably based upon
2039640	2041640	what the block of mass is.
2041640	2043640	Also, shouldn't their scent
2043640	2045640	be slightly masked due to all the ash?
2045640	2047640	Yeah, I guess so, huh?
2047640	2049640	Also, shouldn't the orcs be covered in ash, too?
2049640	2051640	Now, they're the ones
2051640	2053640	hiding underground.
2053640	2055640	That guy
2055640	2057640	looks surprisingly
2057640	2059640	un-ashed.
2059640	2061640	Also, I love how the orcs who see in the dark
2061640	2063640	keep using fucking torches.
2063640	2065640	When you
2065640	2067640	see what they are...
2067640	2069640	I mean, it's better than
2069640	2071640	Game of Thrones, I guess, where everything is dark.
2071640	2073640	Yeah.
2073640	2075640	Is he gonna mine it himself?
2075640	2077640	These two
2077640	2079640	are probably the best part of the show.
2079640	2081640	Consistently.
2081640	2083640	Yep.
2083640	2085640	It's the only part I actually pay attention, really.
2085640	2087640	He found a chasm full of myth.
2103640	2105640	Wait a second.
2107640	2109640	Arch, I know you know something about
2109640	2111640	about this sort of thing.
2111640	2113640	About this sort of thing, specifically.
2113640	2115640	Is that how
2115640	2117640	veins of ore work?
2117640	2119640	Oh, yeah, totally.
2119640	2121640	No, it's not embedded in the rock or anything.
2121640	2123640	It's dramatically placed
2123640	2125640	on the surface of rocks.
2125640	2127640	That way, you can look at it and go,
2127640	2129640	gold!
2133640	2135640	Five minute walk back home.
2135640	2137640	I like the tiny drizzle of
2137640	2139640	water in the background there.
2139640	2141640	If this were like a
2141640	2143640	Disney movie, this is where he'd break
2143640	2145640	out in song.
2145640	2147640	This is the exact moment.
2147640	2149640	Yep.
2149640	2151640	A whole new friendship.
2151640	2153640	Something inside you
2153640	2155640	is ill-formed.
2155640	2157640	Jesus.
2157640	2159640	That's harsh.
2159640	2161640	Harsh?
2161640	2163640	Are dwarven babies
2163640	2165640	born with beards, too?
2165640	2167640	That was a euphemism.
2167640	2169640	Duh.
2181640	2183640	How dare you have a friend?
2191640	2193640	Great, you just did it.
2193640	2195640	Assassinate him.
2195640	2197640	No one will witness it.
2201640	2203640	Oh, no, his, uh, thing.
2203640	2205640	I don't know what that is, but yeah.
2205640	2207640	It was definitely a thing.
2207640	2209640	Yeah, it's probably like his
2209640	2211640	princely thing.
2211640	2213640	It's like in case somebody was looking at him
2213640	2215640	and was like, who the fuck are you?
2215640	2217640	And he lifts his beard.
2217640	2219640	Here's my cattle collar.
2219640	2221640	Here's my cattle collar.
2225640	2227640	It's like, I'll just take it with me.
2227640	2229640	Looks back,
2229640	2231640	oh, I probably should.
2231640	2233640	Oh, you have to say it plot-wise.
2233640	2235640	It's not yours anymore.
2239640	2241640	The writing was great.
2241640	2243640	Wait, so what's his plan
2243640	2245640	for the throne then?
2245640	2247640	There's like another
2247640	2249640	civil war and succession crisis.
2249640	2251640	They sleep
2251640	2253640	with that shit in their hair.
2253640	2255640	Listen, all of the trees
2255640	2257640	have regrown. Why? Because
2257640	2259640	magic, that's why.
2259640	2261640	Because he was good and you were wrong, barge.
2261640	2263640	I'll never understand.
2263640	2265640	There's sodom apples.
2265640	2267640	Oh, wow.
2267640	2269640	We'll go to market with all the
2269640	2271640	crop we've got. What market?
2271640	2273640	Yeah,
2273640	2275640	didn't know they had markets.
2275640	2277640	I think it's pre-capitalism, guys.
2277640	2279640	Do they have a vibrant
2279640	2281640	harfoot economy?
2281640	2283640	Are there more harfoots?
2283640	2285640	Yeah, no doctors will fuck with you now.
2285640	2287640	Hurry, let's pick all of the apples
2287640	2289640	as quickly as possible.
2289640	2291640	That way they'll rot.
2291640	2293640	Yeah, like, maybe they're moving on, I guess.
2293640	2295640	They've got to get a bunch of them.
2295640	2297640	A better feast, I guess.
2297640	2299640	Yeah, but normally if they're making applesauce
2299640	2301640	they try to preserve it
2301640	2303640	instead of just picking all of it.
2303640	2305640	Ooh, wait.
2307640	2309640	They're supposed to be small people, right?
2309640	2311640	Like three foot tall, whatever?
2313640	2315640	Why is it that the apples are
2315640	2317640	regular human-sized in their hands?
2317640	2319640	Because Amazon doesn't care that much, Dev.
2321640	2323640	Oh, look, all of the fish are dead.
2323640	2325640	No?
2325640	2327640	That's a big person foot.
2327640	2329640	It's a big person, oh my no.
2329640	2331640	Hey, bring the bucket, why did you leave
2331640	2333640	the bucket? There's no reason to leave the bucket.
2333640	2335640	Well, now the bucket's its own character
2335640	2337640	going on an adventure.
2337640	2339640	Oh good, the bucket will demonstrate to us
2339640	2341640	the bad people.
2341640	2343640	Oh no.
2343640	2345640	It's like, aha, harfoots must be nearby.
2345640	2347640	And for some reason
2347640	2349640	they use human-sized buckets.
2349640	2351640	That's weird.
2351640	2353640	That would be really heavy for a harfoot.
2353640	2355640	I know that would probably sound like a stickler, but
2355640	2357640	the original movie did it so well,
2357640	2359640	the size difference thing.
2359640	2361640	And here, they really just don't fucking bother.
2363640	2365640	Look, hmm, this tree seems very
2365640	2367640	fruity. Let's destroy it.
2371640	2373640	I hate the armor design in this
2373640	2375640	fucking show so much.
2375640	2377640	Oh, flour.
2379640	2381640	How disgusting.
2381640	2383640	I pluck at it.
2383640	2385640	I look at it.
2385640	2387640	You know, maybe I'm just a weirdo.
2389640	2391640	But I do kind of find her hot in a weird way.
2391640	2393640	Yeah, that does make you a weirdo.
2393640	2395640	Oh, okay.
2397640	2399640	That's not right, Death.
2399640	2401640	I think so.
2401640	2403640	Oh, I mean, either way. I can go both ways on this one.
2403640	2405640	My turn.
2405640	2407640	Death. Dumpster.
2407640	2409640	In. Now.
2409640	2411640	Blow it out.
2411640	2413640	You know you want to.
2413640	2415640	Gonna use her hand to do it, not blow it.
2415640	2417640	Hmm.
2417640	2419640	Well, that's unusual.
2419640	2421640	Also,
2421640	2423640	they're doing the height difference thing with the hill
2423640	2425640	as a way to not
2425640	2427640	do the size difference thing.
2431640	2433640	Oh, shit.
2433640	2435640	All the apples.
2435640	2437640	They're all gonna die. Thank God.
2441640	2443640	Damn, none of them were asleep inside of their carts
2443640	2445640	when this happened. Quick, kill the wizards.
2445640	2447640	Kill the wizards.
2447640	2449640	At least all the apples will be cooked.
2449640	2451640	Yeah.
2451640	2453640	They weren't gonna preserve her.
2453640	2455640	Also, every single cock-sucking
2455640	2457640	one of the Harfoots were outside of their homes
2457640	2459640	when this happened.
2465640	2467640	At least kill some of them.
2467640	2469640	Like, the black one. Kill him.
2469640	2471640	He's not necessary anymore. He's done his part.
2471640	2473640	Of course, Arch wants the black one dead.
2473640	2475640	Someone, just kill some of them.
2475640	2477640	Arch's racism is showing. Nope, too late.
2477640	2479640	The only one who goes under the blackies.
2479640	2481640	Fucking Harfoots.
2483640	2485640	God, more people need to die
2485640	2487640	in this show.
2487640	2489640	Only specific
2489640	2491640	colors, right, Arch?
2491640	2493640	Sick bastard.
2493640	2495640	All those rumors were true
2495640	2497640	in the end, Arch.
2497640	2499640	I've just forced you to walk for days
2499640	2501640	with a giant gash in your side.
2501640	2503640	Well, okay.
2503640	2505640	I am horse, I speak English.
2505640	2507640	My master's still arrived.
2507640	2509640	He's dead, Beric.
2509640	2511640	You must give him up, Beric.
2515640	2517640	Well, I mean, he walked all this way here,
2517640	2519640	so clearly he will listen to some of you.
2519640	2521640	You gonna turn him loose so he can run home to daddy?
2521640	2523640	Yep.
2523640	2525640	Oh yeah, he's gonna go rescue fucking Isildur.
2525640	2527640	Right, why the fuck not?
2527640	2529640	I mean, why are you surprised,
2529640	2531640	Arch? Come on, get with the program here.
2531640	2533640	Thank you.
2533640	2535640	I'm going to find Measter now.
2537640	2539640	Measter.
2539640	2541640	Oh my god, it's like this thing where the horse rescues
2541640	2543640	Aragorn.
2545640	2547640	They're just copying the other movies now.
2549640	2551640	I hate this fucking show.
2553640	2555640	Yes, it would have saved all of us
2555640	2557640	a lot of television.
2557640	2559640	Yes, let's just walk into the queen's tent.
2559640	2561640	I'm sure there's no guards here or anything.
2561640	2563640	Yep, just...
2563640	2565640	It's fine.
2565640	2567640	Just straight in.
2567640	2569640	With your sword and all.
2569640	2571640	I don't think that's the queen's tent.
2571640	2573640	Yeah.
2573640	2575640	That's a fancy looking hospital tent.
2575640	2577640	Mummy?
2577640	2579640	Not mummy.
2579640	2581640	Mummy.
2581640	2583640	Oh, was I right?
2583640	2585640	Is she gone?
2585640	2587640	That's got to be a fake out.
2589640	2591640	It's got to be a stranger.
2591640	2593640	Yep.
2593640	2595640	But they already did that though.
2595640	2597640	She's going to show up in three, two...
2597640	2599640	I kind of hope she's dead.
2599640	2601640	Yep, there you go.
2601640	2603640	I'm so good at calling this shit, Arch.
2603640	2605640	You knew it.
2605640	2607640	I'm the best one now.
2607640	2609640	I hate you, Cib.
2609640	2611640	I repeat my previous statement.
2611640	2613640	More people need to die in this show.
2613640	2615640	Yeah, was anyone thinking,
2615640	2617640	like, oh god, I hope they don't kill her.
2617640	2619640	She was so integral.
2619640	2621640	Oh no, you're alive too.
2625640	2627640	You guys have like no ash on you either.
2627640	2629640	Like, you're just completely fine.
2629640	2631640	I mean, I assume they just put some on him.
2631640	2633640	They've had days to wipe off their face.
2633640	2635640	You know what I like the most?
2635640	2637640	It's the fact that his hair is still short and cropped.
2637640	2639640	Like, it's been...
2639640	2641640	fucking weeks now.
2641640	2645640	It feels like this show is just written by an algorithm.
2645640	2647640	It kind of does.
2651640	2653640	Ah, yes. Keep writing.
2653640	2655640	None will... None need... No!
2655640	2657640	Puts on a fucking blindfold.
2657640	2659640	Just in case people didn't know.
2661640	2663640	Ah, like it's...
2663640	2665640	It's the lack of attention to detail that pisses me off so much.
2665640	2667640	Because, yeah, okay.
2667640	2669640	It makes sense that the queen would be strong,
2669640	2671640	with her weakness, you know, keeping morale up.
2671640	2675640	Then the moment she's back to camp, now tie a blindfold on me so everyone will know.
2675640	2679640	Maybe she can touch her and make her feel better.
2679640	2681640	Oh, a gentle push ought to do that.
2681640	2683640	Ha ha!
2683640	2685640	Do not spend your pity on me, El.
2687640	2689640	Save it.
2689640	2691640	For our enemies.
2691640	2693640	Why should she pity her enemies?
2693640	2695640	For they do not know what they have begun.
2695640	2699640	Oh my Jesus, are we actually doing the Jesus... We are doing the Jesus thing.
2701640	2703640	She's like, I want revenge.
2703640	2707640	Like, they're talking as if they've fought some kind of great battle here and been defeated.
2707640	2709640	Like, none of this has happened.
2709640	2711640	A mountain blew up.
2711640	2713640	Like, are you going to fight the mountain?
2713640	2715640	This scene is so random. Oh my God.
2717640	2721640	Captain, I'm doubting and having second doubts. Oh!
2721640	2723640	Like, you know how you...
2723640	2727640	You know how you get the AI music that sounds pretty good, but just slightly off?
2727640	2729640	You get, like, AI pictures and artwork now?
2729640	2735640	Even the big boob AI woman that Sargon has been posting, there's just something slightly off, but it's like 99...
2735640	2737640	Yeah, it's like 99% good.
2737640	2739640	That's what this show feels like.
2739640	2745640	It's like all the moments, all the story beats, all, like, the five-second waits for something to happen.
2745640	2747640	It's all so predictable.
2747640	2749640	It feels like a computer wrote it.
2749640	2751640	It's soulless.
2751640	2753640	Is that all you think we have left in us?
2753640	2755640	We're horror foots.
2755640	2757640	Yeah.
2757640	2759640	Yeah, that means we're really, like, self-adventurous.
2759640	2761640	No, it doesn't.
2761640	2763640	The horror foots go to war.
2763640	2765640	Okay, listen here.
2765640	2769640	The horror foots will leave people behind if they've got a fucked up ankle.
2769640	2773640	They will leave them to die if they can't walk along with their...
2773640	2775640	They won't be able to put them on the cart.
2775640	2777640	And now it's like, we're horror foots.
2777640	2781640	That means we're really tough and could survive having our entire civilization burned to the ground.
2781640	2783640	No, you're dead.
2783640	2785640	All of you, dead.
2785640	2787640	Starved to death.
2787640	2789640	Now.
2789640	2791640	This is such bullshit.
2791640	2793640	They were literally ready to leave this fucking behind because he twisted his ankle.
2793640	2795640	Mhm.
2795640	2797640	I hate this fucking thing.
2797640	2799640	Well, like I said.
2799640	2801640	Or like Dev said, it's an algorithm.
2801640	2803640	Like, this whole thing is just...
2803640	2805640	Literally, it's like, now the horror foots are down on their luck.
2805640	2807640	So now somebody has to be like, we can do this.
2807640	2809640	And then everyone goes like, yeah.
2809640	2811640	Yeah.
2811640	2813640	Yeah, you actually can do it.
2813640	2815640	The horror friendship.
2815640	2817640	Arch, I feel like today, more than any other day,
2817640	2819640	you're really anti this show.
2819640	2821640	Like, the hatred of this show.
2821640	2823640	Yeah.
2823640	2825640	Like, the hatred's flowing today.
2825640	2827640	Caught him on a bad day.
2827640	2829640	The thing is, like,
2829640	2831640	so much of this has just been boring
2831640	2833640	and stupid, but
2833640	2835640	now the story beats
2835640	2837640	are coming together and I'm finally realizing
2837640	2839640	I really hate the story.
2839640	2841640	Well, yeah, because initially it was like,
2841640	2843640	well, maybe they'll pull it off.
2843640	2845640	Maybe they'll go in an interesting direction.
2845640	2847640	And now it's like, well,
2847640	2849640	no, they're not.
2849640	2851640	Not without us.
2851640	2853640	Not without us.
2853640	2855640	Ah, fuck, god, kill me now.
2855640	2857640	Shoot me.
2857640	2859640	It's time for us to go to heaven.
2865640	2869640	I'm a trained finder, what you go with them looks a brown person.
2869640	2871640	Me?
2871640	2873640	Listen, you're an expensive actor.
2873640	2875640	We're using you.
2875640	2877640	Oh.
2881640	2883640	I work right all the time.
2885640	2887640	I'll fetch provisions and get me stick.
2887640	2889640	I'm coming with you.
2891640	2893640	It's a good stick.
2893640	2895640	I hate all of you.
2895640	2897640	I hope so.
2897640	2899640	So, I recently read an article
2899640	2901640	where someone was complaining that
2901640	2903640	all of the Harfoot stuff was racist
2903640	2905640	because they all do really bad
2905640	2907640	Irish accents.
2907640	2909640	Does that look like a painting in the background?
2909640	2911640	The backdrop looks flat.
2911640	2913640	I agree.
2913640	2915640	I, too, am decidedly racist
2915640	2917640	against the Irish, and I fucking hate the Harfoots.
2917640	2919640	Oh my god,
2919640	2921640	Queen, if you wanted to keep morale up,
2921640	2923640	like... No, that was earlier.
2923640	2925640	It's different.
2925640	2927640	It's different now.
2927640	2929640	Also, they've only got one ship.
2929640	2931640	I guess they left the other two behind.
2935640	2937640	Is yester-eve a word?
2939640	2941640	No.
2941640	2943640	No.
2943640	2945640	Convenient.
2945640	2947640	He can't ride.
2947640	2949640	He's gonna.
2949640	2951640	A vast gash on the side.
2951640	2953640	Like, his insides are
2953640	2955640	about to be his outsides, and you're gonna
2955640	2957640	put him on a horse.
2957640	2959640	You gotta shake it out of him, Arch.
2961640	2963640	I also love how...
2963640	2965640	One episode ago,
2965640	2967640	he was like, I don't want to go home.
2967640	2969640	Now he's like, I will not abandon them
2969640	2971640	to a mere volcanic explosion.
2971640	2973640	Like, I'm a king now.
2973640	2975640	And my people need me.
2975640	2977640	You know, that is strange
2977640	2979640	that he was, like, laying in bed looking like he was
2979640	2981640	about to die at Death's Door.
2981640	2983640	And now he's... he's walking.
2983640	2985640	I'm actually okay.
2985640	2987640	Thanks for the pep talk, guys.
2987640	2989640	Yeah. You see, wait.
2989640	2991640	I thought they were gonna, like, get him ready for
2991640	2993640	travel. He's like, I guess I'll just fucking go.
2993640	2995640	Alright. Can you ride? No?
2995640	2997640	Yeah.
2997640	2999640	Like, he's... this wound needs
2999640	3001640	11 medicine or he'll die.
3001640	3003640	Okay. Well, I guess he can ride, then.
3007640	3009640	Thank you.
3009640	3011640	Thank you. This is an enormously
3011640	3013640	precious 11 heirloom.
3013640	3015640	Thank you very much.
3015640	3017640	Goes to the next merchant.
3017640	3019640	He's like, oh, you just sold it for me.
3019640	3021640	He's like, yeah.
3021640	3023640	He'll probably get a good price for it, though.
3023640	3025640	Southland power.
3032640	3035640	Oh, they start out at a gallop right away.
3035640	3037640	Don't trot or anything to take it easy
3037640	3039640	on his wound. Just go on.
3039640	3041640	These scenes aren't realism.
3041640	3043640	They're shot for symbolism.
3043640	3045640	I fucking hate this show so much.
3045640	3047640	Like, now that the story's
3047640	3049640	actually come into its own, I fucking
3049640	3051640	realize how much I dislike it all.
3051640	3053640	Oh, dude.
3053640	3055640	Lilith, you mentioned the Sargon faces earlier.
3055640	3057640	They're like... they're like Pogchamp Sargons.
3059640	3061640	Should be an emote.
3061640	3063640	On the server.
3063640	3065640	It's your father's.
3065640	3067640	Yeah, it's your dad. Go fucking kill him.
3067640	3069640	Now.
3069640	3071640	Too suspicious.
3071640	3073640	His mind too feeble.
3073640	3075640	Kill him.
3075640	3077640	You should kill him.
3077640	3079640	Too many crests he hurls to the floor.
3081640	3083640	One day this will be your king.
3083640	3085640	You're the real one.
3085640	3087640	Oh my gosh, she's Lady McFeth-ing him.
3087640	3089640	Wait. Arch.
3089640	3091640	Make the racist comment we all know you want to make.
3091640	3093640	Go.
3093640	3095640	Goddammit, you're putting me on the spot.
3095640	3097640	What am I supposed to say?
3097640	3099640	Is it a black joke?
3099640	3101640	Is it a Jew joke?
3101640	3103640	Arch, it's the only thing you ever do
3103640	3105640	which is black jokes. Come on.
3105640	3109640	Yeah, but I don't see how this relates to her being black.
3109640	3111640	You'll find a way.
3111640	3113640	No, I'm leaning more towards Jewish right now.
3115640	3117640	You're so temperamental with your racism.
3121640	3123640	I'm going to dig.
3123640	3125640	Black people don't dig.
3125640	3129640	Arch, she's just a black Israelite, okay?
3129640	3131640	Look, he figured it out.
3131640	3133640	Good job Arch, come on.
3133640	3135640	Fucking hell.
3137640	3139640	I don't care how many dwarves have lost me.
3139640	3141640	If the whole room's looking at Arch, it's going to be like,
3141640	3143640	say the line, Arch.
3143640	3145640	Yeah, basically.
3145640	3147640	See, my racism is very organic, okay?
3147640	3149640	I can't just turn it on and off like that.
3151640	3153640	Are we going to see the balrog?
3153640	3155640	Is the balrog going to burn the leaf?
3155640	3157640	Come on, balrog.
3157640	3159640	Come on, balrog.
3159640	3161640	I know you're in there.
3161640	3163640	Come on, balrog.
3163640	3165640	Where the fuck is it going?
3165640	3167640	It's going where the balrog is.
3167640	3169640	Dude, it's glowing.
3169640	3171640	Yes, step on it.
3171640	3173640	No!
3177640	3179640	It's a leaf!
3179640	3181640	It's the balrog!
3183640	3185640	At the end of the day,
3185640	3187640	it wasn't Durin who digged deep
3187640	3189640	and greatly, it was that cunt who threw
3189640	3191640	a leaf in there and woke him.
3191640	3193640	Yep.
3193640	3195640	Hills that you should not litter.
3195640	3197640	Hey, what do you think happened
3197640	3199640	to the old man who opened the dam?
3199640	3201640	Is he just dead?
3201640	3203640	He's right there, dead.
3203640	3205640	Is that him?
3205640	3207640	Oh my fuck, I can't tell, it's all ashy.
3211640	3213640	Oh, he named Mordor.
3213640	3215640	Mordor.
3217640	3219640	Ah, Birmingham.
3225640	3227640	They call it Adar?
3233640	3235640	The Southland under race, is it?
3237640	3239640	Yep.
3239640	3241640	Oh my god!
3243640	3245640	Okay, they should have
3245640	3247640	had someone say that.
3247640	3249640	That should have been a line.
3249640	3251640	Yeah, but it would have come out of nowhere.
3251640	3253640	Like, what would that even be the lead up?
3253640	3255640	Like, what are we going to name it? Hold on.
3255640	3257640	Mordor. What does that mean?
3257640	3259640	No, well, but...
3259640	3261640	They could have also just left
3261640	3263640	it without, and then like,
3263640	3265640	weighed it a little bit.
3265640	3267640	Also, wait, why was it called the eye?
3267640	3269640	I was half expecting
3269640	3271640	the Southlands to get
3271640	3273640	Wait, wait, Kibbs, shut it up.
3273640	3275640	Kibbs, figure it out.
3275640	3277640	Shut up, Kibbs.
3277640	3279640	We're on the opening of the episode right here.
3279640	3281640	Wow, when fucking Galadriel
3281640	3283640	is like opening her eyes and being like
3283640	3285640	Darth Vader.
3285640	3287640	We could also extend the list to the fact that Mordor
3287640	3289640	is a thing, but that's not really
3289640	3291640	related directly to Sauron, because it would require
3291640	3293640	the tower, and the tower takes thousands of years to build.
3293640	3295640	Yep, yep, yep.
3295640	3297640	They're obviously appealing to that, right?
3297640	3299640	And also, what's her name lost her eyes?
3299640	3301640	There's that.
3301640	3303640	Oh, too many eyes.
3303640	3305640	But,
3305640	3307640	what would have been
3307640	3309640	far, far better.
3309640	3311640	Just name the episode Mordor.
3311640	3313640	Okay, that sucks, but name it Mordor.
3313640	3315640	And then just end on that
3315640	3317640	exact scene. What do we name it?
3317640	3319640	But then don't show that lame
3319640	3321640	thing where the word Mordor
3321640	3323640	fades in. Don't show that.
3323640	3325640	Almost anything else.
3325640	3327640	If you just name the episode Mordor
3327640	3329640	and then end it on
3329640	3331640	what do we name the new land?
3331640	3333640	And then have it like a long fade out.
3333640	3335640	It would work, it would actually work.
3335640	3337640	It's like so desperate to be like, guys, you know
3337640	3339640	Mordor, you know the thing.
3339640	3341640	The thing, by the way, guys.
3341640	3343640	Yeah, exactly. Nailed it on the head with that.
3343640	3345640	Ugh.
3345640	3347640	It's painful.
3347640	3349640	But it's because it doesn't
3349640	3351640	speak for itself, right?
3351640	3353640	Everything about this show has been,
3353640	3355640	remember when the movies did this?
3355640	3357640	Yes. It's very
3357640	3359640	referential, and that's the issue.
3359640	3361640	The thing that you guys like, right?
3361640	3363640	Yeah. It's the I member berries.
3363640	3365640	It's like, remember guys? Remember when
3365640	3367640	Photobag, I just went on a vid,
3367640	3369640	I member. It's like, okay.
3371640	3373640	Fuck.
3373640	3375640	Fuck.
3375640	3377640	Okay.
3377640	3379640	This is exactly it though.
3379640	3381640	Up until this point, we've been watching this show
3381640	3383640	and mostly it's just
3383640	3385640	the scene boring.
3385640	3387640	And occasionally there's been a scene which Dev,
3387640	3389640	the simp, has gone like, this isn't too bad,
3389640	3391640	and everyone else has yelled at him.
3391640	3393640	But this, finally now,
3393640	3395640	after seven hours,
3395640	3397640	the story has
3397640	3399640	culminated,
3399640	3401640	and I realize I hate the story.
3401640	3403640	Like, that's literally what we've
3403640	3405640	arrived at here. The story has finally
3405640	3407640	arrived, and I wish it would never have.
3409640	3411640	You wish you'd just be dicking around with
3411640	3413640	what's bumbling in the forest for
3413640	3415640	a full, you know,
3415640	3417640	eight or nine or ten episodes.
3417640	3419640	At least they're not gonna let you in.
3419640	3421640	It's like mystery box storytelling, right?
3421640	3423640	Where they're like, what could this be?
3423640	3425640	It could be really interesting.
3425640	3427640	And, like, as long as you don't know what it is,
3427640	3429640	it's like, sure, it could be interesting.
3429640	3431640	And then you know what it is, and it's like, oh.
3431640	3433640	Well, the problem is though,
3433640	3435640	the problem is though, we know what it is
3435640	3437640	because this is a prequel.
3437640	3439640	There's no mystery boxes in a prequel.
3439640	3441640	I mean, like, the sword.
3441640	3443640	Like, we didn't know what it was, and then it's like, oh, it's a key.
3443640	3445640	And it's like, oh.
3445640	3447640	Yeah, but like, all the important mystery boxes,
3447640	3449640	like, oh, we get it. It's obviously Mithril, right?
3449640	3451640	Or it's obviously Mount Doom.
3451640	3453640	Or it's obviously Creation of Mortals. Like, oh, okay.
3453640	3455640	Then they make shit up.
3455640	3457640	Where now Mithril is magical
3457640	3459640	crack rock that saves the elves.
3459640	3461640	It's so dumb. I hate it so much.
3463640	3465640	Arch.
3465640	3467640	Hold on, Dev. Same issue with, like,
3467640	3469640	prequels, right? Because they're trying to,
3469640	3471640	like, why did you want to watch the prequels?
3471640	3473640	It was to figure out who Darth Vader was before he became
3473640	3475640	Darth Vader, you know? How did he become that way?
3475640	3477640	There was a mystery still
3477640	3479640	that needed solving. We knew
3479640	3481640	the result, but we didn't know how we got there.
3481640	3483640	This doesn't really have
3483640	3485640	that, does it?
3485640	3487640	No, because it doesn't explain how you
3487640	3489640	got there. It makes shit up.
3489640	3491640	Yeah, exactly.
3491640	3493640	None of it's canon, anyway.
3493640	3495640	Like, okay, well, how did the dwarves delve too deep
3495640	3497640	and too greedily? Well, you see,
3497640	3499640	an old man threw a leaf down a hole
3499640	3501640	and the bad rug was like, LEAF.
3503640	3505640	Oh, I'm gonna kill dwarves
3505640	3507640	now.
3507640	3509640	How was Mount Doom created? Well, an old dude
3509640	3511640	put a sword in a rock and it
3511640	3513640	made water and shit. Like,
3513640	3515640	the thing is, if you're gonna do a prequel- So why did he go
3515640	3517640	all the way to the hole
3517640	3519640	just to throw the leaf
3519640	3521640	down?
3521640	3523640	Yeah, I don't know. I've talked about this when it comes to
3523640	3525640	40k. Was there no garbage can?
3525640	3527640	40k did his own
3527640	3529640	whole prequel thing with the Horus Heresy.
3529640	3531640	The way you do a prequel
3531640	3533640	well is when you add
3533640	3535640	to the story, when you build
3535640	3537640	to it, when you add value
3537640	3539640	to the story. Like,
3539640	3541640	when a character- like with
3541640	3543640	Darth Vader is actually a pretty good example.
3543640	3545640	They added value to him by
3545640	3547640	showing his fall. They added
3547640	3549640	depth to him. But here, all they're
3549640	3551640	doing is subtracting.
3551640	3553640	Thus, knowing that Mount Doom was created by an
3553640	3555640	old fart who stuck a stick in a rock
3555640	3557640	doesn't add to Mount Doom.
3557640	3559640	It subtracts from it. It's no longer
3559640	3561640	a mountain volcano
3561640	3563640	created by Satan.
3563640	3565640	It's a rando thing built by some rando
3565640	3567640	to create ash so he could live with his orcs
3567640	3569640	friends there.
3569640	3571640	His orc friends. Aww, that's kind of endearing
3571640	3573640	me, by the way. They're also
3573640	3575640	subtracting from Amazon's bank account
3575640	3577640	by trying to make this show.
3577640	3579640	And it's not working out.
3579640	3581640	The fall of duty.
3581640	3583640	Think of what an amazing
3583640	3585640	story it could be.
3585640	3587640	It's not a question of helping the elves.
3587640	3589640	It's simply the dwarves digging deep
3589640	3591640	and greedily for their own greed's
3591640	3593640	sake. No, that's not it at all.
3593640	3595640	It's a fucking leaf.
3595640	3597640	It's an old person.
3597640	3599640	That's an interesting insight into greed
3599640	3601640	and the nature of
3601640	3603640	pushing yourself too hard for
3603640	3605640	just want.
3605640	3607640	The issue is
3607640	3609640	that entire story is supposed
3609640	3611640	to be a story of greed, right?
3611640	3613640	How they continuously justify
3613640	3615640	it. Like, they know this is dangerous
3615640	3617640	but we just want a little bit more gold.
3617640	3619640	Instead, they've subtracted
3619640	3621640	that and now if they don't dig,
3621640	3623640	all of the elves just fucking die.
3623640	3625640	Like, it's no longer greed. It's altruism.
3625640	3627640	I do like how, as usual,
3627640	3629640	it's a fucking leaf that
3629640	3631640	ruins everything.
3631640	3633640	Yep. We have the rags soon, Dev.
3633640	3635640	In real life.
3635640	3637640	Oh god.
3637640	3639640	I mean, there's the usual stuff of
3639640	3641640	every important character survives
3641640	3643640	a cataclysm, but
3643640	3645640	I mean, that's just normal movie logic.
3645640	3647640	I mean,
3647640	3649640	again, it's like not having the will
3649640	3651640	to actually have
3651640	3653640	your story beats make
3653640	3655640	sense or like, play out. Like, you're not
3655640	3657640	really committing to them. No one really dies.
3657640	3659640	No one important happens.
3659640	3661640	Like, okay.
3661640	3663640	Do the fucking stupid
3663640	3665640	running away from lava thing
3665640	3667640	where it's like, oh, the mountain's acting
3667640	3669640	weird. We must evacuate and then
3669640	3671640	have the mountain explode. The mountain explodes,
3671640	3673640	covers everything in the ash, burns everything
3673640	3675640	with a temperature high enough to
3675640	3677640	have wood spontaneously combust
3677640	3679640	yet there are still survivors.
3679640	3681640	You know what they could have done?
3681640	3683640	They could have actually done the exact
3683640	3685640	same story. They just
3685640	3687640	they could have, man,
3687640	3689640	I was just thinking of this.
3689640	3691640	They didn't need to make it so that you take the
3691640	3693640	sword and then put it in the keyhole and then
3693640	3695640	open the dam, which then floods all the
3695640	3697640	water down into the volcano and causes the volcano.
3697640	3699640	They could have just made it so that it was a
3699640	3701640	magic sword and a magic
3701640	3703640	keyhole that creates a magic volcano.
3703640	3705640	Yeah.
3705640	3707640	Magic. And it would have
3707640	3709640	worked a lot better. Like, yes, you
3709640	3711640	put the sword in, the ground starts rumbling,
3711640	3713640	you know, the sigil of Sauron appears
3713640	3715640	in the mountain and like the top blows off of it or something
3715640	3717640	like, you could, you could just make this
3717640	3719640	shit up. They're already making it up anyway.
3719640	3721640	They might as well make it up good.
3721640	3723640	No.
3725640	3727640	That's what they decided.
3727640	3729640	We are against the concept of quality
3729640	3731640	here at Amazon Studios.
3731640	3733640	We'll use an algorithm.
3733640	3735640	In any other show, I'd
3735640	3737640	call it a cop-out, but in a show like
3737640	3739640	this, where you are
3739640	3741640	in the time of legends and myth,
3741640	3743640	literally just make an artifact
3743640	3745640	of Morgoth and it's like when
3745640	3747640	this artifact is like placed upon the
3747640	3749640	thingamabob, like darkness will descend
3749640	3751640	upon the land and what does it mean?
3751640	3753640	And then you blow up Mount Doom.
3753640	3755640	Yeah, exactly.
3755640	3757640	Just pour water.
3757640	3759640	You could have like a legend
3759640	3761640	attached to it and the legend, yeah,
3761640	3763640	it says like, darkness will come to the land and no one knows what
3763640	3765640	it means and they're like, we have to make sure that
3765640	3767640	the enemy doesn't get it to the altar
3767640	3769640	and they have like a back and forth
3769640	3771640	over it and like it gets lost and then found
3771640	3773640	again and there's like a mad scramble for it.
3773640	3775640	And then the heroes fail right in
3775640	3777640	the last moment and then, you know, the
3777640	3779640	old man plunges it into the
3779640	3781640	into the altar and then the volcano
3781640	3783640	explodes. Like it could be a whole thing!
3783640	3785640	And I'll dev...
3785640	3787640	...water.
3787640	3789640	Don't do it.
3791640	3793640	It's just...
3793640	3795640	It is anti-Tolkean almost
3795640	3797640	every step of the way.
3797640	3799640	I hate the horse. I hate the horse
3799640	3801640	too. The horse walks
3801640	3803640	all the way back to camp.
3803640	3805640	But suddenly it's convenient.
3805640	3807640	It's like, the horse won't
3807640	3809640	listen to any of us. He walked all the way back
3809640	3811640	here though. Like, no, it won't listen.
3811640	3813640	Okay. And he takes off the bridle and the horse
3813640	3815640	goes, yes to!
3815640	3817640	And runs away.
3817640	3819640	It's gonna be the air form scene. Like, that's how it's gonna do it.
3819640	3821640	Like, he's gonna lick him awake, you know, and he's like, ugh.
3821640	3823640	Yeah, no, no, he's
3823640	3825640	gonna be lying there covered in ash
3825640	3827640	and you're gonna see the horse now just
3827640	3829640	hoof, hoof, hoof.
3829640	3831640	And then you're like, oh, horse, you came for me! Horse!
3831640	3833640	Two days later.
3833640	3835640	Me and his horse
3835640	3837640	and me and his best friend?
3837640	3839640	That's what the show's saying.
3839640	3841640	I hate it. And the
3841640	3843640	thing is too,
3843640	3845640	the reason why I hate it so much
3845640	3847640	is because this is just
3847640	3849640	a movie plotline.
3849640	3851640	That is all it is. The only reason,
3851640	3853640	like, we haven't seen him build any
3853640	3855640	relationship with this fucking horse.
3855640	3857640	Like, it's not like we saw him
3857640	3859640	carrying out his stable master duties
3859640	3861640	or pet the horse or like,
3861640	3863640	oh, you're a good horse, you're feeding cats
3863640	3865640	or anything, no. We saw one scene of that.
3865640	3867640	We saw one scene of that. Only one.
3867640	3869640	Yeah. No, not even that.
3869640	3871640	Like, that was his daddy coming over like,
3871640	3873640	you know, a horse would make a bond with you if you're nice
3873640	3875640	with a horse. Like, but he never did
3875640	3877640	that. Like, he was whining over
3877640	3879640	how a horse was like, horse, why are you bitching
3879640	3881640	about the scratch? Again, it is
3881640	3883640	just a movie plot.
3883640	3885640	Alright, sure. Would you say that you're racist
3885640	3887640	against horses too? Yes.
3887640	3889640	Species too.
3889640	3891640	Barch's
3891640	3893640	biases are only growing from the show.
3893640	3895640	His hatred is...
3895640	3897640	Wait, Kibbs,
3897640	3899640	you're a horse right now, dude.
3899640	3901640	Yes, that's true.
3901640	3903640	But also,
3903640	3905640	I'm watching the Harfoot scene now
3905640	3907640	where their entire little retarded village is
3907640	3909640	burnt to the ground and there's
3909640	3911640	shitloads of stuff that isn't burnt.
3911640	3913640	Like, there's like pieces of wooden
3913640	3915640	like, bowls just fine.
3915640	3917640	There's pieces of their fucking retarded camo netting
3917640	3919640	just lying over the flames.
3919640	3921640	That's just fine.
3921640	3923640	It's like they just created
3923640	3925640	a set of burnt out carts.
3927640	3929640	Yeah, this show seems to consistently
3929640	3931640	just be weird about fire.
3931640	3933640	Cause there was that, the broken tree branch
3933640	3935640	that was just painted to be burned, but not actually
3935640	3937640	burned. Like,
3937640	3939640	I think they just don't know what like,
3939640	3941640	what fire is. They just don't get it.
3941640	3943640	It's not that.
3943640	3945640	It's an active resistance to attention to detail.
3945640	3947640	That's the thing. Like, cause
3947640	3949640	they don't actually give a fuck.
3949640	3951640	Again, the queen,
3951640	3953640	it's writing by
3953640	3955640	scene, by numbers, right?
3955640	3957640	Queen is sitting on her horse, and you're like
3957640	3959640	oh my god, she's blind. And she's like
3959640	3961640	I don't want to show my weakness to the soldiers.
3961640	3963640	Okay. Makes a lot of
3963640	3965640	sense. And then next scene, she's
3965640	3967640	sitting there with a fucking blindfold.
3967640	3969640	Yeah, no explanation whatsoever.
3969640	3971640	I mean, now it's okay to break
3971640	3973640	the moral, I guess.
3973640	3975640	Either it was always
3975640	3977640	okay, or like
3977640	3979640	what happened in between.
3979640	3981640	Yeah.
3981640	3983640	Yeah, um
3983640	3985640	I don't, I don't think I agree with you there.
3985640	3987640	I actually think that it's ignorance. I think that it's
3987640	3989640	ignorance, because like, I'm sure
3989640	3991640	we've all heard that story of the university
3991640	3993640	professor who is very
3993640	3995640	intelligent, like a math professor or physics
3995640	3997640	professor or something. He's very intelligent, but he doesn't
3997640	3999640	know what a supply chain is. So he asks
3999640	4001640	the question, why do people hunt for
4001640	4003640	food? Why not just get your food from the grocery store?
4003640	4005640	We don't need to kill animals anymore, just go to the grocery store.
4005640	4007640	It's like, well, he doesn't know
4007640	4009640	what, like how the food gets to the grocery
4009640	4011640	store, right? Like, there's that story that I think
4011640	4013640	we've all heard at least once.
4013640	4015640	I genuinely think the people who
4015640	4017640	wrote this show don't know
4017640	4019640	how fire or heat works.
4019640	4021640	They're like, oh yeah, things kind of get pretty
4021640	4023640	hot, you know, I turn on the heating in my house and like
4023640	4025640	heats up a bit, maybe it's a little bit too hot, but
4025640	4027640	it's not a big deal.
4027640	4029640	I genuinely think they don't
4029640	4031640	get it. They've never been around like a campfire
4031640	4033640	before or a real fire.
4033640	4035640	The thing is like, I'm sure they're idiots
4035640	4037640	as well, Dev. I'm not
4037640	4039640	I'm not saying they're not retards
4039640	4041640	also, but no, it
4041640	4043640	is the consistent lack
4043640	4045640	of attention to detail. It's like with their
4045640	4047640	armor. Galadriel doesn't have her
4047640	4049640	armor until Galadriel
4049640	4051640	suddenly has her fucking armor.
4051640	4053640	And the Halibrand too.
4053640	4055640	In one scene, there's like a
4055640	4057640	man in him, basically dead on the side of the road
4057640	4059640	like only elephant medicine can cure him.
4059640	4061640	Can you ride? Yep.
4061640	4063640	And he's just
4063640	4065640	walking perfectly healthy.
4065640	4067640	It's like, where are we riding to?
4067640	4069640	To get the elephant medicine that'll cure you.
4069640	4071640	But I'm riding.
4071640	4073640	Like his medicine is falling out.
4075640	4077640	Why don't you pick up the
4077640	4079640	medicine yourself and come back
4079640	4081640	for him and he can rest
4081640	4083640	and hopefully not die.
4083640	4085640	Put him in a fucking cart
4085640	4087640	or something.
4089640	4091640	I mean, I don't
4091640	4093640	know if anybody here has
4093640	4095640	ridden a horse, but
4095640	4097640	they're not the most stable.
4097640	4099640	Yeah, they're quite bumpy.
4099640	4101640	Again, it is
4101640	4103640	the consistent lack of attention
4103640	4105640	to detail because they
4105640	4107640	think of a scene
4107640	4109640	of, wouldn't it be cool if Halibrand
4109640	4111640	was like wounded and they had to get like
4111640	4113640	elephant medicine. Yeah, that's like from those
4113640	4115640	movies things. Yeah, let's do that.
4115640	4117640	But then they also rode a scene
4117640	4119640	later on that needs to have Halibrand
4119640	4121640	with Galadriel and so they're like, fuck.
4121640	4123640	Why don't you have him ride? It's fine.
4125640	4127640	Lilith, Lilith, you have to understand
4127640	4129640	everyone in this call rides Kibs at least
4129640	4131640	once a day.
4131640	4133640	So, also, also, also.
4133640	4135640	Galadriel arrives at camp,
4135640	4137640	right? And then five minutes
4137640	4139640	later, her plate armor is perfectly
4139640	4141640	spotlessly clean, including her
4141640	4143640	chainmail.
4143640	4145640	I guarantee you, Arch, there's a bunch of simps in
4145640	4147640	that camp we'll just lick it off for.
4147640	4149640	Probably.
4149640	4151640	Okay, so
4151640	4153640	I think we all have heard
4153640	4155640	Arch's rant at this point.
4155640	4157640	Does anybody else want to throw in their two cents?
4159640	4161640	I forgot what we were talking about. I sort of zoned out.
4161640	4163640	We're talking about whores.
4163640	4165640	You mean there's not
4165640	4167640	I feel like there's not much to say.
4167640	4169640	The show just
4169640	4171640	kind of speaks to her itself.
4171640	4173640	Let's hope the
4173640	4175640	next episode will be better because
4175640	4177640	there's just lots of
4177640	4179640	I think we pretty much complain about everything
4179640	4181640	you're used to complain. There is no fucking way
4181640	4183640	the show gets any better.
4183640	4185640	Like, maybe, maybe by season two
4185640	4187640	but this season's going to be a
4187640	4189640	trash fire all the way down.
4189640	4191640	The thing is, this
4191640	4193640	this was the payoff.
4193640	4195640	This was supposed to be the big moment
4195640	4197640	and the storylines actually got started
4197640	4199640	after seven hours.
4199640	4201640	Well
4201640	4203640	I know that it was meant to be
4203640	4205640	the money shot and I do feel like
4205640	4207640	I got fucked.
4207640	4209640	I do like that the camp is like
4209640	4211640	conveniently
4211640	4213640	outside of the range of
4213640	4215640	Mount Doom.
4215640	4217640	Yeah.
4217640	4219640	Well, good thing they have the foresight.
4219640	4221640	Actually, you know what?
4221640	4223640	So they mentioned in the last episode
4223640	4225640	how they got that far inland.
4225640	4227640	Apparently the ships they have
4227640	4229640	can also sail up rivers.
4229640	4231640	So they just sailed all the way
4231640	4233640	up to the Southlands.
4233640	4235640	That's not out of the ordinary
4235640	4237640	in fact, that's pretty common for ships like that.
4237640	4239640	Is it?
4239640	4241640	But ships that can hold 500 guys?
4241640	4243640	Yeah, no, no, no, no, no.
4243640	4245640	As the resident fucking Norwegian here
4245640	4247640	for people who invented river faring ships
4247640	4249640	Yeah, you guys did that.
4249640	4251640	This is for shallow draft
4251640	4253640	ships. Like, these are not shallow
4253640	4255640	draft ships. These are fucking galleons.
4255640	4257640	Yeah, and the rivers are deep.
4257640	4259640	You put your foot in, Cib.
4261640	4263640	Oh, God.
4263640	4265640	Amazon, hire me. I can explain
4265640	4267640	away everything.
4267640	4269640	Wait, Cibs, it turns
4269640	4271640	out that you're just the Amazon plant in the group
4271640	4273640	the whole time. I've been sabotaging it.
4273640	4275640	It's actually pretty good, guys.
4275640	4277640	There's no rivers
4277640	4279640	leading up to Mount Doom.
4279640	4281640	Like, none.
4281640	4283640	Like, they still have to cross the fucking
4283640	4285640	mountain range.
4285640	4287640	Listen, I don't want to hear any more of your
4287640	4289640	details, Arch, okay?
4289640	4291640	The closest they could get
4291640	4293640	is, like, one of the rivers that leads
4293640	4295640	to the southern edge of the
4295640	4297640	wall of mountains. And then they'd
4297640	4299640	have to cross literally the
4299640	4301640	entirety of Mordor
4301640	4303640	to reach Mount Doom.
4303640	4305640	Yep. It was kind of why Frodo, it was such a big deal for
4305640	4307640	Frodo and Sam to get in there because
4307640	4309640	there's really no other way to get past the mountains.
4309640	4311640	Yeah, I'd also like to point out
4311640	4313640	these mountains,
4313640	4315640	they're not like hills.
4315640	4317640	It's an enormous fucking barrier.
4317640	4319640	Particularly for
4319640	4321640	people on horses.
4321640	4323640	And for a plus two.
4323640	4325640	This is 300 men.
4325640	4327640	Like, the amount of food,
4327640	4329640	supplies, parts,
4329640	4331640	they've set up a fucking tent town.
4331640	4333640	Well, you see, Arch,
4333640	4335640	Hannibal Barca did it, and he did it with
4335640	4337640	elephants and the Alps, okay?
4341640	4343640	I broke Arch.
4343640	4345640	No, they operated on a Russian line of thinking
4345640	4347640	supply lines?
4347640	4349640	What supply lines?
4349640	4351640	What supplies?
4351640	4353640	Scavenger we go.
4353640	4355640	This is a nitpick that's
4355640	4357640	almost pointless, but since we're going
4357640	4359640	at it, there's no way those fucking
4359640	4361640	We're going at it.
4361640	4363640	carried 300 fucking horses.
4363640	4365640	Well, there's no way to
4365640	4367640	carry 300 men either.
4367640	4369640	There's a lot of meme art showing the ship,
4369640	4371640	and then it shows the side interior,
4371640	4373640	and underneath it goes like
4373640	4375640	40 feet deep, and there's like 30 decks.
4375640	4377640	It's like a giant
4377640	4379640	barge underwater.
4379640	4381640	Oh, okay, that's where the other 300 men is.
4381640	4383640	They show
4383640	4385640	a shot of the ship's deck,
4385640	4387640	and there's like 10-12 people, and it looks
4387640	4389640	crowded.
4389640	4391640	Those ships
4391640	4393640	can't carry 300 men, I'm sorry,
4393640	4395640	but that's just not possible.
4395640	4397640	Not including horses, no.
4397640	4399640	Again, it is the consistent
4399640	4401640	fucking lack of attention to deal.
4401640	4403640	This is Numenor.
4403640	4405640	There's just CGI ships. There's no reason
4405640	4407640	why they couldn't have shown like
4407640	4409640	100 fucking ships setting sail from
4409640	4411640	Numenor. That would look cool.
4411640	4413640	The Numenoreans are going to war,
4413640	4415640	and there's this massive armada just
4415640	4417640	cresting the sea. Yeah, instead,
4417640	4419640	it's five boats, and then two of them
4419640	4421640	have three boats left.
4421640	4423640	You would think that
4423640	4425640	a show like this would have more
4425640	4427640	budget behind it.
4427640	4429640	Okay.
4429640	4431640	Let's just give
4431640	4433640	a few more CGI ships.
4433640	4435640	I think I know.
4435640	4437640	I think I know why not.
4437640	4439640	I think I know why not. So earlier,
4439640	4441640	I mentioned that it's like a lack of real-world
4441640	4443640	experience as to why they don't know how fire works.
4443640	4445640	Okay. Assume
4445640	4447640	that these writers are very sheltered
4447640	4449640	living in LA their whole lives
4449640	4451640	or something. They don't know how anything works.
4451640	4453640	And then, also, assume
4453640	4455640	that they're, let's say, extremely
4455640	4457640	extremely left-leaning.
4457640	4459640	Okay, let's just make these two assumptions.
4459640	4461640	Okay.
4461640	4463640	The only ships they would have heard about
4463640	4465640	would have been African slave ships
4465640	4467640	and how they crowded
4467640	4469640	them full with hundreds of people.
4469640	4471640	I like where we're
4471640	4473640	going. Of course you would,
4473640	4475640	aren't you? Fuck. But like,
4475640	4477640	that's why they're like, we can
4477640	4479640	clearly put 500
4479640	4481640	guys in a ship. That's how it worked, right?
4481640	4483640	Obviously. I remember hearing about that.
4483640	4485640	That was their line of logic.
4485640	4487640	This is so annoying, though, because
4487640	4489640	when you're a writer and you're writing
4489640	4491640	fantasy or writing science fiction,
4491640	4493640	most of your work is actually just reading
4493640	4495640	or Google searching, literally.
4495640	4497640	Okay, how does this work?
4497640	4499640	Or you call up somebody, a friend who
4499640	4501640	is actually an architect. How do these buildings work?
4501640	4503640	It's a lot of research.
4503640	4505640	More time spent researching than you'll ever
4505640	4507640	spend writing. They didn't do any of the right research.
4507640	4509640	They ought to be like the pawn stars. Hold on, let me
4509640	4511640	call up my expert.
4511640	4513640	Yeah, it says you're going to need
4513640	4515640	a lot more boats.
4515640	4517640	No, no, no. This
4517640	4519640	explains a lot. The reason why Numenor
4519640	4521640	is so diverse is because the white
4521640	4523640	people use the black people as
4523640	4525640	slave warriors, and they pack them into their
4525640	4527640	boats really tight. Look at this. See, Arch
4527640	4529640	can't hold back. He just has to.
4529640	4531640	I know this was Dev's idea. I'm just
4531640	4533640	expanding upon it. It's like a pop-up army.
4533640	4535640	It's kind of like the droids
4535640	4537640	from Star Wars, like the side of the ships
4537640	4539640	Arch and stuff.
4539640	4541640	Black people extend out
4541640	4543640	like the fucking droid army starts
4543640	4545640	playing like, bear, bear, bear.
4545640	4547640	Fucking no way.
4547640	4549640	Where do they keep the horses, Dev?
4549640	4551640	Yeah, we've answered
4551640	4553640	that question.
4553640	4555640	We know how they've stacked up the humans, but
4555640	4557640	where are the fucking horses?
4557640	4559640	Where's the horses' food?
4559640	4561640	Did they stack them up too?
4561640	4563640	Did they stack them like, black person, horse,
4563640	4565640	black person, horse?
4565640	4567640	Damn, Arch.
4567640	4569640	Just smashed in there?
4569640	4571640	What would the horse think?
4571640	4573640	What would the horse think?
4573640	4575640	I'm going to have to start distancing
4575640	4577640	myself, but I think it's too late.
4577640	4579640	Dev, remember me?
4579640	4581640	Next
4581640	4583640	episode, Arch is completely
4583640	4585640	replaced.
4585640	4587640	We just pretend we never knew it.
4587640	4589640	Guys, Arch is sick with
4589640	4591640	Covid again.
4591640	4593640	And Arch comes
4593640	4595640	in on horses
4595640	4597640	wearing clan hoods, like
4597640	4599640	in Birth of the Nation.
4599640	4601640	What if the horses
4601640	4603640	were black too? Could they store them
4603640	4605640	as easily? Arch, you
4605640	4607640	have Fehrman syndrome.
4607640	4609640	Oh, does Fehrman? I guess Fehrman's
4609640	4611640	German, right? He always is racist.
4611640	4613640	Let me Google, do
4613640	4615640	black horses fold?
4615640	4617640	Wait, hold on.
4617640	4619640	We'll get
4619640	4621640	Fehrman in for the next one.
4621640	4623640	We can see if he can out-racist
4623640	4625640	Arch with his German-ness.
4625640	4627640	The thing is, he doesn't
4627640	4629640	really do the racism thing, he just
4629640	4631640	does the anti-semitism thing.
4631640	4633640	Yeah.
4633640	4635640	He's like...
4635640	4637640	A while ago, he was talking
4637640	4639640	about how his mouse was busted, and he's
4639640	4641640	like, back in Auschwitz, our gear
4641640	4643640	was on top shape.
4643640	4645640	Jesus.
4645640	4647640	There's more than a problem in Poland.
4647640	4649640	I don't remember Fehrman's alt-right Arch,
4649640	4651640	but we're going with it now.
