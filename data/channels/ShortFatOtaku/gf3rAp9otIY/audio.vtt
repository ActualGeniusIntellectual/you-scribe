WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:07.720
We're back for another round of Lord of the Rings, the Rings of Power.

00:07.720 --> 00:09.760
This time, Arch is with us.

00:09.760 --> 00:11.760
How are you doing, Arch?

00:11.760 --> 00:12.760
Thick.

00:12.760 --> 00:13.760
Still recovering.

00:13.760 --> 00:20.360
Are you still recovering, Arch, are you okay?

00:20.360 --> 00:23.880
Death is no longer near, but it is in the vicinity.

00:23.880 --> 00:28.920
So before we get into anything else, I would just like to quickly touch base with you,

00:28.920 --> 00:29.920
Arch.

00:29.920 --> 00:33.280
TLDR, what did you think of the last episode?

00:33.280 --> 00:37.240
The creation of Mount Doom.

00:37.240 --> 00:40.300
Everything's got to have an origin story, Arch, we have to explain everything.

00:40.300 --> 00:43.840
I mean, we actually know how Mount Doom was created, but details.

00:43.840 --> 00:45.080
Wait, did we actually?

00:45.080 --> 00:46.760
What's the lore on that?

00:46.760 --> 00:48.240
It was created by Morgoth.

00:48.240 --> 00:52.720
Uh-uh, not according to the show, Arch.

00:52.720 --> 00:55.240
Morgoth didn't create it, it was the water.

00:55.240 --> 00:56.440
The water made it.

00:56.440 --> 00:58.160
That was a big splash.

00:58.200 --> 01:04.400
That's one of those problems, because in the actual story, Mount Doom was created by literal

01:04.400 --> 01:09.240
Satan, which gives it power, which is why it's the only place the ring could be created.

01:09.240 --> 01:14.120
Now it's just a volcano, which means the ring could have been destroyed wherever.

01:14.120 --> 01:18.520
Like, Gandalf could have made a fire and that would have fixed the whole problem.

01:18.520 --> 01:19.520
Maybe...

01:19.520 --> 01:20.520
Definitely made it a lot less special.

01:20.520 --> 01:21.520
Yeah.

01:21.520 --> 01:25.680
Maybe somebody, maybe a wizard will be walking by one day and like drop his magic potions

01:25.680 --> 01:27.640
and do it accidentally and make it special.

01:27.640 --> 01:29.640
It's like, oops!

01:29.640 --> 01:32.440
You know what they'll do?

01:32.440 --> 01:34.000
They'll throw the Harfoots in there.

01:34.000 --> 01:35.600
That's how they did it.

01:35.600 --> 01:36.600
Yeah.

01:36.600 --> 01:41.520
As soon as Sauron, that's Sauron, Jesus, as soon as Sauron regains his senses, and is

01:41.520 --> 01:46.300
like, oh, I'm actually a person, he'll lead the Harfoots over and just dump them in.

01:46.300 --> 01:47.300
That's how it'll work.

01:47.300 --> 01:49.320
Now hold on, was this a Freudian slip?

01:49.320 --> 01:53.400
Like Sauron's like the great evil, like what are you doing, dude?

01:53.400 --> 01:54.400
No one tell them.

01:54.880 --> 01:57.680
Mordor just turned Mordor into a giant Applebee's.

01:57.680 --> 02:02.600
Look, I finished outloading the episode.

02:02.600 --> 02:05.840
You already torrented it while we were doing our little preamble intro?

02:05.840 --> 02:06.840
Oh shit.

02:06.840 --> 02:07.840
Wait, hold on.

02:07.840 --> 02:08.840
Wait, Arch!

02:08.840 --> 02:10.280
Is your internet fast now?

02:10.280 --> 02:11.280
Yes.

02:11.280 --> 02:16.380
A nice man came to my house and he put a cable inside of my house and I'm using that cable

02:16.380 --> 02:20.600
to transmit lights at a high speed and this light turns into information.

02:20.600 --> 02:25.160
You finally got fiber optic out in the wilderness of Norway.

02:25.160 --> 02:30.160
Another bit of news on the ratings front, because we've talked about ratings a few times

02:30.160 --> 02:31.940
over the course of this series.

02:31.940 --> 02:33.680
This was published.

02:33.680 --> 02:39.480
Amazon's Rings of Power isn't making as big of a splash as HBO's House of the Dragon,

02:39.480 --> 02:43.800
and it shows the potential risks of dueling big budget fantasy shows.

02:43.800 --> 02:49.240
This does seem to be a thing that everyone's saying now that both shows have been, they've

02:49.240 --> 02:52.600
been getting through their stories and the seasons are kind of coming to a close.

02:52.600 --> 02:57.480
I've been watching both of them and I have to say, as a whole package, House of the Dragon

02:57.480 --> 03:02.640
is so much better than Rings of Power, it's not even funny.

03:02.640 --> 03:03.640
Still shit though.

03:03.640 --> 03:07.720
I'd rather, I'd rather watch The Next Generation or something old.

03:07.720 --> 03:11.840
What, you mean Degrassi The Next Generation, Kibs?

03:11.840 --> 03:13.280
Hold on.

03:13.280 --> 03:15.280
Sit down, Dev.

03:15.280 --> 03:21.800
Well, first of all, I don't, I don't know that lore nearly is as much, so what's happening

03:21.800 --> 03:24.720
in that show is still kind of surprising me a bit.

03:24.720 --> 03:31.400
Secondly, they just seem to have that Game of Thrones edge that, you know, they're willing

03:31.400 --> 03:34.720
to do a few things that Lord of the Rings is probably never going to be willing to do.

03:34.720 --> 03:43.160
Like for example, having an underage niece and an uncle fuck, that's like, all right,

03:43.160 --> 03:44.160
fair enough.

03:45.040 --> 03:47.840
It was the medieval period, I get it.

03:47.840 --> 03:51.160
Everyone's comparing them in terms of like popularity, right?

03:51.160 --> 03:55.640
And it, it really seemed like when Amazon was talking about, you know, the 25 million

03:55.640 --> 04:01.560
viewers in the first episode, they were really trying to take a stab at HBO over this, because

04:01.560 --> 04:03.800
these are the two shows that are competing right now.

04:03.800 --> 04:10.080
There was a leak from, you guys know who Overlord is on YouTube?

04:10.080 --> 04:11.360
I'm sure you do, Arch.

04:11.360 --> 04:12.360
No?

04:12.360 --> 04:13.360
Okay.

04:13.360 --> 04:18.160
Well, he, he has reliably leaked things from the industry before.

04:18.160 --> 04:22.840
He can't, he doesn't reveal a source because they're in Hollywood, but he has reliably

04:22.840 --> 04:25.560
leaked things, things that turned out to be true.

04:25.560 --> 04:33.760
And he is saying that he has an inside word that Amazon's first episode numbers were 9.5

04:33.760 --> 04:37.720
million and then they dropped by half for episode three.

04:37.720 --> 04:41.200
So not the 25 that everyone's saying.

04:41.200 --> 04:42.720
See that is the problem.

04:42.760 --> 04:51.480
We have no actually genuinely reliable information because first we're told like a 1.8 million,

04:51.480 --> 04:52.960
but that wasn't all devices.

04:52.960 --> 04:53.960
Okay.

04:53.960 --> 04:58.320
And House of the Dragon had more than that, more than that at 4.8, then we're told 25

04:58.320 --> 04:59.320
million.

04:59.320 --> 05:00.320
All right.

05:00.320 --> 05:01.320
That's one fuck of a leap.

05:01.320 --> 05:04.000
And now it's like nine, but it's, was cut in half.

05:04.000 --> 05:09.120
Meanwhile, uh, House of Dragons, I've seen the numbers go drastically down to the point

05:09.120 --> 05:11.960
now they're talking about maybe only a million million.

05:12.000 --> 05:13.000
Okay.

05:13.000 --> 05:19.800
Like, what do we believe if I can House of Dragons right now is like a zero one point

05:19.800 --> 05:23.240
over cyberpunk edge runners, which I just watched the other day.

05:23.240 --> 05:26.000
Like there is no comparing those two shows.

05:26.000 --> 05:27.000
I haven't seen that.

05:27.000 --> 05:28.000
Is that good?

05:28.000 --> 05:30.840
It is very good.

05:30.840 --> 05:33.940
Barge is also in the desperate camp I see.

05:33.940 --> 05:39.200
It seems to be the case that like quasi indie animation has really taken off.

05:39.200 --> 05:43.000
Finally, we're getting out of the CalArts era and into some decent stuff.

05:43.000 --> 05:44.000
Hold on.

05:44.000 --> 05:45.000
That's not indie.

05:45.000 --> 05:46.000
Fuck.

05:46.000 --> 05:47.000
Yeah, no.

05:47.000 --> 05:48.000
That's triple A.

05:48.000 --> 05:49.800
Studio Trigger is not an indie studio.

05:49.800 --> 05:51.600
Oh, is that who's doing it?

05:51.600 --> 05:52.600
Okay.

05:52.600 --> 05:53.600
Nevermind.

05:53.600 --> 05:54.600
Jesus.

05:54.600 --> 05:55.600
All right.

05:55.600 --> 05:58.520
They got a lot of flack for recycling a lot of similar, well, let's just say things were

05:58.520 --> 06:00.240
similar in designs.

06:00.240 --> 06:03.160
Oh, I was thinking of the League of Legends show.

06:03.160 --> 06:04.160
Nevermind.

06:04.160 --> 06:05.160
Okay.

06:05.160 --> 06:06.160
Oh yeah.

06:07.160 --> 06:10.880
The story in Arcane is not amazing.

06:10.880 --> 06:14.600
It's quite standard, but the animation quality is beyond this world.

06:14.600 --> 06:17.040
Also the dragon is better.

06:17.040 --> 06:18.040
It's a soap opera though.

06:18.040 --> 06:19.040
Yeah, it is.

06:19.040 --> 06:20.040
It is.

06:20.040 --> 06:21.040
It needs like a Tyrion.

06:21.040 --> 06:23.760
It needs a Tyrion character to lighten the mood sometimes, but it's mostly a pretty good

06:23.760 --> 06:24.760
show so far.

06:24.760 --> 06:27.880
I also think it needs more like variety in the storytelling.

06:27.880 --> 06:28.880
Yes.

06:28.880 --> 06:29.880
Yeah.

06:29.880 --> 06:30.880
But you know what?

06:30.880 --> 06:32.880
Considering how shit everything else has been, I'll take it.

06:32.880 --> 06:33.880
Yeah, no.

06:33.880 --> 06:34.880
Wow.

06:34.880 --> 06:35.880
Settling for less.

06:36.600 --> 06:37.600
Yeah.

06:37.600 --> 06:38.600
Sometimes you have to man.

06:38.600 --> 06:39.960
This is literally the problem.

06:39.960 --> 06:44.520
The reason why House of Dragon has like an 8.7 score, which is ridiculous for that piece

06:44.520 --> 06:48.440
of shit show is because of people who are like Dev who's like, everything's shocked.

06:48.440 --> 06:52.040
Not just Dev, that boss too.

06:52.040 --> 06:58.320
Like, wow, this cereal only has 75% horse feces in it.

06:58.320 --> 06:59.320
Amazing.

06:59.320 --> 07:03.920
I compare, I only mostly notice it.

07:03.960 --> 07:10.720
He can feel the fucking half digested oats crunch, but doing these teething still chewing.

07:10.720 --> 07:12.720
Could be worse.

07:12.720 --> 07:22.000
Dev, it could be worse, at least you're not Anthony Burch.

07:22.000 --> 07:23.000
It could be worse.

07:23.000 --> 07:26.460
You might be watching Rings of Power.

07:26.460 --> 07:28.240
I actually enjoy House of the Dragon.

07:28.240 --> 07:29.560
I don't know why you think it's shit, Arch.

07:29.560 --> 07:30.760
I think it's actually like half decent.

07:30.760 --> 07:31.760
I'm enjoying it.

07:31.800 --> 07:34.280
I enjoyed the part where the children were killing one another.

07:34.280 --> 07:38.400
I quite liked that, but beyond that, I liked very little.

07:38.400 --> 07:39.400
Really?

07:39.400 --> 07:41.160
Pacing for me.

07:41.160 --> 07:42.840
Very stupid show.

07:42.840 --> 07:43.840
It's so fast.

07:43.840 --> 07:46.480
What is it, stupid?

07:46.480 --> 07:50.000
Every single episode has commenced with an enormous time skip.

07:50.000 --> 07:52.840
The smallest of which has been a measly six months.

07:52.840 --> 07:53.840
Yeah.

07:53.840 --> 07:58.720
I mean, it's because like in the book, it's just like almost bullet points and there's

07:58.720 --> 08:05.360
like a lot of history and they're really trying to like expand it as much as possible.

08:05.360 --> 08:09.840
I think they can just slow down the pacing and make it a longer series.

08:09.840 --> 08:13.200
I height almost every single casting choice.

08:13.200 --> 08:19.240
You have young Raheamon, who looks like fetal alcohol syndrome, the advertisement.

08:19.240 --> 08:24.480
You have Daemon, who's just, his face is weird and I don't like it.

08:24.480 --> 08:29.440
The king is rotting and yet he refuses to fucking die, even though they've been like,

08:29.440 --> 08:32.680
oh, he's dead like seven times now.

08:32.680 --> 08:36.800
And then there's the goddamn Valerians, who are all black now, which annoys me because

08:36.800 --> 08:40.400
her children aren't black and nobody seems to be raising this point.

08:40.400 --> 08:43.560
It's like, hold on, your children are the wrong color, Raheamon.

08:43.560 --> 08:44.560
This is suspicious.

08:44.560 --> 08:46.840
And the king is like, no, you can't say that.

08:46.840 --> 08:51.960
But seriously, though, yeah, that was the clip from Gordon Ramsay.

08:51.960 --> 08:53.400
It's black.

08:53.400 --> 08:56.560
The worst part is about, this is in the House of the Dragon show or something, but I'm just

08:56.560 --> 08:59.560
going to, you know, as a quick aside.

08:59.560 --> 09:06.420
The worst part is, is the reason they made the Valerians black is because the main character

09:06.420 --> 09:11.560
of the Valerians, the grandfather of the entire clan, Corallus Valerian, he was described

09:11.560 --> 09:14.440
as having like olive or tan skin.

09:14.440 --> 09:20.560
Not because he was black, but because he was the only person from that family to like sail

09:20.560 --> 09:21.560
around the world.

09:21.560 --> 09:22.560
And he spent a lot of time on ships.

09:22.560 --> 09:23.560
He was very tanned.

09:23.560 --> 09:26.840
He spent a lot of time outdoors.

09:26.840 --> 09:30.360
And there's like pictures of like, there's like lore pictures of him from the other books.

09:30.360 --> 09:33.920
And he's standing with like other people from Westeros, and he's clearly darker than the

09:33.920 --> 09:34.960
rest of them.

09:34.960 --> 09:36.880
But he's not black.

09:36.880 --> 09:44.840
And I think that that that really just seemed to be shoehorning representation and of course,

09:44.840 --> 09:50.560
his entire clan is black now, like the Valerians are black, it just means they get to pass.

09:50.560 --> 09:54.840
It also means we get to hear that fucking ancient annoying defense again, like what

09:54.840 --> 09:57.040
dragons are okay, but not black people.

09:57.040 --> 09:58.040
Yes.

09:58.040 --> 09:59.040
Yes.

09:59.040 --> 10:01.760
In a universe where dragons are literally more commonplace than like people.

10:01.760 --> 10:02.760
Yes.

10:02.760 --> 10:07.000
It's not even just the Valerians, there's random extras who are black and it just annoys

10:07.000 --> 10:09.480
me these days because I look at that.

10:09.480 --> 10:13.280
And I think to myself, that was a boardroom decision, not a writing one.

10:13.280 --> 10:17.360
And yeah, for me, it ruins my interest in the show because I'm like, okay, well, this

10:17.360 --> 10:18.360
is political.

10:18.360 --> 10:20.360
I don't want that.

10:20.360 --> 10:23.200
These black person, they ruined.

10:23.200 --> 10:24.200
Yes.

10:24.200 --> 10:25.200
Oh, God.

10:25.200 --> 10:30.000
At least in medieval England, it's like, hello, hi, how did you come here?

10:30.000 --> 10:31.200
Very long thought, right?

10:31.200 --> 10:33.400
Are we are we a show full of racists?

10:33.400 --> 10:34.400
Yes.

10:34.400 --> 10:39.600
All I'm saying is that when I was at what it is, I love Jews too.

10:39.600 --> 10:44.400
I am going to make a Shaka Zulu TV show and there's going to be one white person in Shaka's

10:44.400 --> 10:45.400
army.

10:45.400 --> 10:46.440
No one will ever mention him.

10:46.440 --> 10:50.440
He'll just be there in every single fucking scene.

10:50.440 --> 10:52.080
Just in the background, hanging out.

10:52.080 --> 10:53.080
Yep.

10:53.080 --> 10:54.080
He's going to look like everybody else.

10:54.080 --> 10:57.840
He's going to have his cowhide shield and he's going to be pale as fuck and a ginger

10:57.840 --> 11:03.840
and nobody's ever going to mention it.

11:03.840 --> 11:06.600
Taftaz is just like quietly like, I don't want to get canceled.

11:06.600 --> 11:07.600
I can't say anything.

11:07.600 --> 11:08.600
I can't afford.

11:08.600 --> 11:10.000
I'm just starting my channel.

11:10.000 --> 11:11.000
I can't.

11:11.000 --> 11:14.320
I think I've already been canceled for lots of things.

11:14.320 --> 11:15.920
Oh, yeah, that's true.

11:15.920 --> 11:18.360
I've, I've seen some of your debates regarding trans issues.

11:18.360 --> 11:21.320
I know what's going on.

11:21.320 --> 11:30.420
So someone who watches us actually bought that cringy elf ears shirt.

11:30.420 --> 11:35.800
It's I mean, it's not, it's not a bad shirt, but it's very clearly just like a regular

11:35.800 --> 11:40.840
blue shirt that you might get for five cents from China with this shit just printed right

11:40.840 --> 11:41.840
on top of it.

11:41.840 --> 11:45.600
And it'll wash out after about a year or two going through the washing machine.

11:45.600 --> 11:49.720
Well, like most diversity, it doesn't stand up to water well.

11:49.720 --> 11:54.280
Oh, my God, Arch, you are going to get my channel fucking banned.

11:54.280 --> 11:58.360
Arch is racist.

11:58.360 --> 11:59.360
You know this.

11:59.360 --> 12:00.660
We all know this.

12:00.660 --> 12:05.220
I guess the final thing I'll point out before we get on the road here is I did a video maybe

12:05.220 --> 12:10.680
a year ago looking at like the initial Vanity Fair expose, it was an expose.

12:10.720 --> 12:13.000
It was what was it like a preview of the show.

12:13.000 --> 12:15.720
As I was making that video, I dug into why this was happening.

12:15.720 --> 12:20.440
And basically what happened was Tolkien's son died because Tolkien's son wasn't letting

12:20.440 --> 12:21.960
any of this shit happen.

12:21.960 --> 12:24.060
But as soon as he died, the floodgates kind of opened.

12:24.060 --> 12:30.320
And then back in like 2015 or 2016, Amazon quietly bought a bunch just dropped a bunch

12:30.320 --> 12:35.040
of money to get to pick up the series and like quietly started beginning making this.

12:35.040 --> 12:40.280
This came out just a few days ago on The Hollywood Reporter.

12:40.280 --> 12:44.680
This is an interview with some people who are showrunners of the show, and they're talking

12:44.680 --> 12:49.240
about season two and, you know, the poor fan reception and all this.

12:49.240 --> 12:51.740
But one nugget right in the middle of it.

12:51.740 --> 12:57.760
Basically back while the series was still, you know, safely, safely guarded by those

12:57.760 --> 12:59.560
who care about it.

12:59.560 --> 13:03.120
Netflix actually pitched a show before Amazon got involved.

13:03.120 --> 13:09.080
And Netflix said their plan was to basically turn it into Marvel where they're going to

13:09.080 --> 13:14.800
have like, they're going to have like multiple different properties happening at once.

13:14.800 --> 13:19.360
They were going to do like a Gandalf side series, they were going to do an Aragorn series,

13:19.360 --> 13:23.460
they were just going to do, they're just going to give everyone their own show and just do

13:23.460 --> 13:28.440
like an extended universe that like interweaves very Marvel, very Marvel like because the

13:28.440 --> 13:30.500
Tolkien estate was still in charge of things.

13:30.500 --> 13:33.040
They were immediately like, Oh my God, we can never let any of these people ever do

13:33.040 --> 13:34.040
any of this.

13:34.040 --> 13:37.640
We can't, we have to like, and they cut off everyone, they're like, Nope, nope, not doing

13:37.640 --> 13:38.640
anything.

13:38.640 --> 13:39.640
Nope.

13:39.640 --> 13:40.640
Fuck you.

13:40.640 --> 13:41.640
I don't care how much money you give us.

13:41.640 --> 13:42.640
No.

13:42.640 --> 13:43.640
And that basically persisted until Tolkien's son died.

13:43.640 --> 13:47.760
I have a feeling that Amazon might have the same like long term vision for this.

13:47.760 --> 13:50.880
Oh, without a doubt, this is just the beginning.

13:50.880 --> 13:51.880
Yeah.

13:51.880 --> 13:56.640
The thing is, we already know the Rings of Power is a flop from Amazon's point of view,

13:56.640 --> 13:57.640
but very interesting.

13:57.640 --> 14:00.960
And I'll make a video about this probably for Friday.

14:00.960 --> 14:04.360
Because recently, you know, they've been shooting all this in New Zealand, etc.

14:04.360 --> 14:05.840
It's been really expensive.

14:05.840 --> 14:11.580
And they've said that all this is going to cost like $5 billion for the five seasons.

14:11.580 --> 14:16.840
Very quietly, they've sold all of their studio equipment in New Zealand, and they've moved

14:16.840 --> 14:23.280
to London now where they will be starting to shoot just inside of a regular studio.

14:23.280 --> 14:26.720
Oh, quiet.

14:26.720 --> 14:31.880
So in all due likelihood, Amazon has given up and but they can't cancel it.

14:31.880 --> 14:33.760
They know they can't cancel it.

14:33.760 --> 14:39.560
So they've shifted them off to some dark back corner office in London and just make

14:39.560 --> 14:40.560
movie.

14:40.560 --> 14:45.560
Well, actually, this is something that I saw another media recently, what they often do

14:45.560 --> 14:50.240
now rather than go to locations, they did this, I think he did it in London, and they

14:50.240 --> 14:54.120
did it for the Mandalorian is they'll actually computer generate an entire landscape.

14:54.120 --> 14:57.600
However, it's not like they just insert them on a green screen and put them in front of

14:57.600 --> 14:58.600
it.

14:58.600 --> 14:59.600
They don't they don't do that anymore.

14:59.600 --> 15:00.600
Because that looks kind of fake.

15:00.600 --> 15:03.660
And you know, it is fake, what they'll do almost like a VR headset, they'll 360 view

15:03.660 --> 15:09.320
an entire computer generated landscape, and then project that onto a dome and the actor

15:09.320 --> 15:12.240
goes into the dome and then acts the scene.

15:12.240 --> 15:15.740
So it looks like that they're outside, but they're not.

15:15.740 --> 15:20.380
And the acting dome, the acting apparently, it's really hard to do this.

15:20.380 --> 15:22.460
It's hard on the people working on the set.

15:22.460 --> 15:27.620
Because if you don't, it's it's tuned to exactly where the actor is in the dome.

15:27.620 --> 15:32.160
And if you're not where he is, or where the camera is, or the camera is, if you're not

15:32.160 --> 15:36.200
in the exact spot, all the images like just look distorted because you're looking at them

15:36.200 --> 15:37.960
from the wrong angle.

15:37.960 --> 15:42.820
Everyone who works in the acting dome is getting like motion sickness and shit.

15:42.820 --> 15:44.440
But that's how it rather than going to places.

15:44.440 --> 15:46.000
That's how they're shooting these now.

15:46.000 --> 15:47.560
Fuck actors.

15:47.560 --> 15:50.560
It's better than getting shot on set, I guess.

15:50.560 --> 15:57.640
I hope they get put into the wage cages to Jesus arch arch, you're relentless tonight

15:57.640 --> 15:58.640
people.

15:58.640 --> 16:06.800
So I've got my my mug, piping full of piping hot soup broth, as I do in the evenings.

16:06.800 --> 16:10.560
That's just just chicken noodle.

16:10.560 --> 16:12.960
Just put it in there and boil it up.

16:12.960 --> 16:14.700
And no longer to drink coffee at nights anymore.

16:14.700 --> 16:16.880
So but kids, I think it's time.

16:16.880 --> 16:19.680
It's time for us to watch the eyes.

16:19.680 --> 16:21.720
Oh my god, an hour and 12 minutes.

16:21.720 --> 16:23.560
I'm never going to bed.

16:23.560 --> 16:24.560
Let's go.

16:24.560 --> 16:28.120
Because we're gonna see the eye of Sauron in it.

16:28.120 --> 16:30.040
Honestly, probably that obvious.

16:30.040 --> 16:32.080
Oh, for God's sake.

16:32.080 --> 16:34.680
Oh, look, the legend of Vox Maxima.

16:34.680 --> 16:35.680
I tried to use that.

16:35.680 --> 16:36.680
It was not very good.

16:36.680 --> 16:38.800
No, I don't know why you did.

16:38.800 --> 16:43.960
But then again, your tastes are, but I was desperate.

16:43.960 --> 16:44.960
Recap skip.

16:44.960 --> 16:47.640
Oh boy, we're gonna see the Harfoot's again.

16:47.640 --> 16:49.360
I miss those guys.

16:49.360 --> 16:51.760
I don't.

16:51.760 --> 16:54.880
Oh, Jesus.

16:54.880 --> 16:56.920
That sounds like it was your fetish tap Tash.

16:56.960 --> 16:58.960
Oh, the Harfoot's.

16:58.960 --> 17:00.960
I'm so happy.

17:00.960 --> 17:02.960
Oh, dirty eye.

17:02.960 --> 17:03.960
Gross.

17:03.960 --> 17:05.960
Yeah, now, Galadriel is dead, by the way.

17:05.960 --> 17:06.960
I don't accept this.

17:06.960 --> 17:07.960
Yeah.

17:07.960 --> 17:08.960
Yeah.

17:08.960 --> 17:09.960
She's dead.

17:09.960 --> 17:10.960
She would not be alive.

17:10.960 --> 17:11.960
She's an L.

17:11.960 --> 17:12.960
She's an L.

17:12.960 --> 17:13.960
Oh, yeah.

17:13.960 --> 17:14.960
So that actually reminds me.

17:14.960 --> 17:19.840
There was a video on, like, I think on LiveLeak at one point.

17:19.840 --> 17:25.160
And it was just a Russian guy who gets like an explosion goes off in his face.

17:25.520 --> 17:29.960
And you can tell by the way he's speaking that he singed the inside of his lungs.

17:29.960 --> 17:32.080
And he's like, I'm totally fine, guys.

17:32.080 --> 17:33.160
Don't worry about it.

17:33.160 --> 17:37.160
But with the way that those injuries go is as soon as your lungs start to swell, you're

17:37.160 --> 17:38.160
just gonna die.

17:38.160 --> 17:40.160
You have like 20 minutes to live, and that's it.

17:40.160 --> 17:43.180
And it's kind of grotesque being on a ticking time bomb like that.

17:43.180 --> 17:47.040
But that's what happens to everyone who gets like a fireball of ash in the face.

17:47.040 --> 17:49.720
And everyone should be dead.

17:49.720 --> 17:50.720
Everyone is dead.

17:50.720 --> 17:53.920
The rest of the show is just a fever dream.

17:54.680 --> 17:56.680
Very before death, yep.

17:57.680 --> 17:59.680
Oh, the flaming horse!

18:01.680 --> 18:02.680
Runner or no.

18:02.680 --> 18:03.680
God dammit.

18:03.680 --> 18:07.680
It had one chance to make its life worth something.

18:07.680 --> 18:09.680
I mean, they did the right thing.

18:09.680 --> 18:11.680
You know, died.

18:12.680 --> 18:15.680
Well, we'll see about that.

18:15.680 --> 18:20.680
These are the corpses of all the people banned from Twitch for saying Cracker.

18:20.680 --> 18:22.680
No, these are all the banned reviews.

18:23.440 --> 18:28.440
Lake has been warm enough for wood to spontaneously combust, but humans are still fine in this

18:28.440 --> 18:29.440
area.

18:29.440 --> 18:31.440
Yeah, it's a bit much.

18:31.440 --> 18:33.440
All the water would have been boiled out of you instantly.

18:33.440 --> 18:34.440
Oh, cool.

18:34.440 --> 18:35.440
Even the babies are alive.

18:35.440 --> 18:36.440
Impressive.

18:36.440 --> 18:39.440
You know, we've always been told that babies are fragile and you shouldn't drop them on

18:39.440 --> 18:41.440
the ground, but clearly they're quite sturdy.

18:41.440 --> 18:46.440
I think this would be a big problem, but it turns out it's actually not.

18:46.440 --> 18:52.440
Have I ever told any of you that I was actually unironically dropped as a baby?

18:53.200 --> 18:55.200
No, but your behavior is sort of made again.

18:55.200 --> 19:00.200
My dad put me on the kitchen counter to answer a phone call, and I immediately rolled off.

19:03.200 --> 19:05.200
You are going to use that against you, Dev.

19:05.200 --> 19:08.200
Oh my god, they're just walking past burning people?

19:08.200 --> 19:09.200
Wow.

19:09.200 --> 19:11.200
You're not going to throw something on that guy?

19:11.200 --> 19:13.200
Heroes, ladies and gentlemen.

19:13.200 --> 19:15.200
It's like, help, I'm burning to death slowly.

19:15.200 --> 19:18.200
I like how every named character is okay.

19:18.200 --> 19:20.200
Well, of course.

19:20.960 --> 19:21.960
My queen, you're black.

19:21.960 --> 19:22.960
Surely you must be fire resistant.

19:22.960 --> 19:23.960
Lift.

19:25.960 --> 19:26.960
Jesus.

19:26.960 --> 19:27.960
Ah, the queen had to do it.

19:27.960 --> 19:28.960
Wait, Arch.

19:28.960 --> 19:29.960
The woman had to do it.

19:29.960 --> 19:31.960
Arch, first water, now fire.

19:31.960 --> 19:34.960
What the fuck is with you and black people and the elements?

19:34.960 --> 19:37.960
Well, no, I said diversity doesn't survive water.

19:37.960 --> 19:41.960
Black people survive fire, as you can clearly see by this show.

19:41.960 --> 19:42.960
Other friend died.

19:42.960 --> 19:43.960
Oh no.

19:43.960 --> 19:45.960
Oh no, I'm just saying.

19:45.960 --> 19:48.960
Prophecy didn't really make us care about that character in your show.

19:49.720 --> 19:51.720
I don't kill anything.

19:51.720 --> 19:53.720
Oh, was that supposed to be a character we know?

19:53.720 --> 19:56.720
That's the other friend in the trio friend group.

19:56.720 --> 19:59.720
Yeah, it's the third guy that never got named.

20:01.720 --> 20:03.720
The AK red shirt of the friend group.

20:06.720 --> 20:08.720
Oh no, the death of other friend.

20:08.720 --> 20:12.720
His actor's like, this'll totally launch my career, guys.

20:15.720 --> 20:18.720
I think that was symbolic of what happened to his career for being in the show.

20:19.480 --> 20:21.480
Yep, this entire situation.

20:22.480 --> 20:26.480
This is actually just the Amazon HQ right now that we're looking at.

20:27.480 --> 20:30.480
I mean, yeah, when the reviews came in.

20:31.480 --> 20:33.480
And Bezos is just inside.

20:33.480 --> 20:34.480
Everything's fine.

20:34.480 --> 20:35.480
It's okay.

20:36.480 --> 20:38.480
Wait, why is there a fireball?

20:38.480 --> 20:40.480
Because that's how fire functions die.

20:40.480 --> 20:42.480
He wasn't important.

20:42.480 --> 20:44.480
No, no, he's fine.

20:44.480 --> 20:46.480
Because AZ is over.

20:47.240 --> 20:49.240
Nice, yeah.

20:51.240 --> 20:53.240
Oh yay, what a transition.

20:54.240 --> 20:56.240
Wish he had some of this water, eh?

20:59.240 --> 21:01.240
There's slaves back there.

21:01.240 --> 21:03.240
They just leave him alone.

21:03.240 --> 21:05.240
I will laugh if everyone knows.

21:05.240 --> 21:07.240
Yes, I was about to say it's all going to be burnt to shit.

21:07.240 --> 21:09.240
There you go.

21:09.240 --> 21:11.240
How did you guys fuck this up?

21:11.240 --> 21:13.240
Well, they were back in Bragg and then suddenly...

21:13.240 --> 21:15.240
Ah, the rocks.

21:16.000 --> 21:18.000
Oh.

21:18.000 --> 21:21.000
That's a long flight, but...

21:24.000 --> 21:28.000
Wait, do you think that we're going to see Ents in this show?

21:32.000 --> 21:34.000
I feel like we already have.

21:34.000 --> 21:36.000
Oh, maybe.

21:40.000 --> 21:42.000
I don't know about that, dude.

21:46.000 --> 21:48.000
Well, he almost fixed it.

21:48.000 --> 21:50.000
Wait, hold on.

21:50.000 --> 21:52.000
Here, Kibbs, if you don't mind, go back a bit.

21:52.000 --> 21:54.000
There.

21:54.000 --> 21:57.000
Yeah, I'm pretty sure he pushed her under the tree.

21:57.000 --> 21:59.000
Look at the wood.

21:59.000 --> 22:02.000
I feel like whoever made the show hasn't ever seen burning wood before.

22:02.000 --> 22:05.000
Because that's just wood painted black.

22:05.000 --> 22:07.000
You mean it's been diversified?

22:07.000 --> 22:09.000
It is diversified.

22:09.000 --> 22:11.000
It only burns from the edge.

22:11.000 --> 22:13.000
Yeah, it's not actually burnt wood.

22:13.000 --> 22:15.000
It's not burnt wood!

22:15.760 --> 22:17.760
It's painted dried wood.

22:17.760 --> 22:20.760
It wouldn't even be asked to burn the wood.

22:23.760 --> 22:25.760
Oh my god.

22:25.760 --> 22:28.760
I know that I come from a small town, right?

22:28.760 --> 22:33.760
But even city kids have to do a campfire once in a while, right?

22:33.760 --> 22:36.760
Or they've seen something burn, right?

22:36.760 --> 22:38.760
I don't know enough.

22:38.760 --> 22:41.760
I went to camping once or twice.

22:41.760 --> 22:43.760
Okay.

22:44.520 --> 22:48.520
If it's burnt like that bad, then normally what happens is the inside's also black or ash.

22:48.520 --> 22:51.520
Yeah, everything's just ash, and it crumbles.

22:51.520 --> 22:53.520
And it's very dry.

22:53.520 --> 22:55.520
This is just clearly painted wood.

22:55.520 --> 22:58.520
Why should we trust any elf?

22:58.520 --> 23:00.520
Why shouldn't you?

23:00.520 --> 23:03.520
All this fucking retarded elf hate.

23:03.520 --> 23:06.520
Aren't you guys already working together?

23:06.520 --> 23:09.520
But Elrond half elf.

23:09.520 --> 23:11.520
Ah, he's half elf.

23:11.520 --> 23:13.520
He's a bastard.

23:14.280 --> 23:17.280
Wait, was Elrond always a half elf?

23:17.280 --> 23:19.280
No.

23:19.280 --> 23:21.280
How to talk to short people.

23:21.280 --> 23:24.280
How to talk to short people.

23:27.280 --> 23:29.280
I hate this entire plotline.

23:29.280 --> 23:31.280
Like, Mithril wasn't... this isn't Mithril.

23:31.280 --> 23:33.280
Like, they knew about Mithril before this.

23:33.280 --> 23:37.280
They were making shit out of Mithril before this.

23:37.280 --> 23:40.280
Don't be bothered by it. It's not Lord of the Rings.

23:41.040 --> 23:44.040
So Kibbs, I've noticed whenever you move the mouse,

23:44.040 --> 23:47.040
over top of the feed,

23:47.040 --> 23:51.040
you get a nice little handy list of all the people

23:51.040 --> 23:56.040
in the side who will never get an acting job again after the show bombs.

23:57.040 --> 24:00.040
I mean, I like the x-ray function when I'm watching good shows.

24:00.040 --> 24:02.040
This is useless here.

24:02.040 --> 24:04.040
I don't care about any of these.

24:04.040 --> 24:08.040
The fate of the elves was decided many ages ago.

24:08.800 --> 24:11.800
My mind's much wiser,

24:11.800 --> 24:14.800
much farther-seeing than our own.

24:14.800 --> 24:16.800
You know, the Amazon Rising stuff.

24:18.800 --> 24:22.800
You know, the elves are still pretty long-lived.

24:22.800 --> 24:26.800
And you're gonna be king one day. You can just do it.

24:31.800 --> 24:34.800
He just put his hand on the molten piece of metal.

24:34.800 --> 24:36.800
He did, yes.

24:38.800 --> 24:40.800
No, at least it was covered good.

24:40.800 --> 24:42.800
I was about to say she was holding that piece of molten metal,

24:42.800 --> 24:44.800
but no, there was a little thing wrapped around it.

24:44.800 --> 24:47.800
When she put it in, there was no bubbling.

24:47.800 --> 24:52.800
It was just fake steam and the ripple of putting a cold thing into water.

24:52.800 --> 24:56.800
Otherwise, she'd have to hold onto something molten, which would hurt.

24:56.800 --> 24:59.800
I'm sorry, elf. We Jews cannot give you your shiny ox.

24:59.800 --> 25:02.800
I just come back in like 15 years when our king is dead.

25:02.800 --> 25:04.800
Yeah.

25:04.800 --> 25:06.800
Because dwarves don't live that long, do they?

25:07.560 --> 25:09.560
They live the same amount of time as regular people.

25:09.560 --> 25:11.560
I think they live a bit longer.

25:11.560 --> 25:17.560
Also, the problem with this mysterious unknown fucking random-ass magic disease

25:17.560 --> 25:20.560
is that they have given us no frame of reference for this.

25:20.560 --> 25:22.560
Like, they're saying, like,

25:22.560 --> 25:24.560
we'll all be dead tomorrow. Like, why?

25:24.560 --> 25:27.560
Like, I thought this was a slow creeping corruption or something.

25:27.560 --> 25:30.560
You're giving me your crack cocaine.

25:30.560 --> 25:32.560
Please hit your head on the door.

25:32.560 --> 25:35.560
The scene is so undermined by the plot, it's not even funny.

25:36.320 --> 25:40.320
You know, I liked the elves and the dwarves shit, but I hate this

25:40.320 --> 25:42.320
because it's just magic macguffin.

25:42.320 --> 25:45.320
Like, ah, shiny rock under mountain, make elves live longer.

25:45.320 --> 25:47.320
Why? What? How? When?

25:47.320 --> 25:50.320
Also, surely the elves can go mine it themselves.

25:50.320 --> 25:52.320
They know what it is now.

25:52.320 --> 25:54.320
My god, symbolism.

25:54.320 --> 25:56.320
Yep, look at that. Suddenly the leaf is like, I'm getting better now.

26:00.320 --> 26:02.320
Yep.

26:03.080 --> 26:07.080
The magic rock literally un-rots the leaf.

26:07.080 --> 26:10.080
Oh god, this is very dumb.

26:10.080 --> 26:13.080
The leaf gets up and starts walking, dancing.

26:13.080 --> 26:16.080
They're very dramatic about it, too.

26:16.080 --> 26:21.080
To be fair, if I saw a leaf de-age before my eyes, I'd be like, ugh.

26:23.080 --> 26:26.080
You have to put those in the anti-aging creams.

26:26.080 --> 26:29.080
Yeah, but magic space rock works.

26:33.080 --> 26:35.080
It's magic tree rock, actually.

26:35.080 --> 26:37.080
Ah, good. Back to death and destruction.

26:39.080 --> 26:43.080
The show livens up a lot when the bad people are dying.

26:43.080 --> 26:45.080
Wait, when did...

26:45.080 --> 26:48.080
When did Theo get with Galadriel?

26:49.080 --> 26:51.080
When they started walking together, I guess.

26:51.080 --> 26:53.080
Last burning place. She picked him out of the wreckage and was like,

26:53.080 --> 26:56.080
random person, come with me.

26:56.080 --> 26:58.080
I don't know why our characters need to talk to each other,

26:58.080 --> 27:01.080
because you're really nobody, but I need you to accompany me now.

27:01.840 --> 27:03.840
It's like, okay.

27:03.840 --> 27:05.840
It says here in the script, oh, okay, gotcha.

27:07.840 --> 27:09.840
This is so forced.

27:09.840 --> 27:11.840
Also, apparently the orcs survived this shit just fine.

27:11.840 --> 27:14.840
I guess they are naturally resistant to fire.

27:14.840 --> 27:16.840
They're orky borkies, Arch.

27:16.840 --> 27:19.840
Orky borkies are impervious to many things.

27:19.840 --> 27:21.840
That's a lot of survivors.

27:21.840 --> 27:24.840
Yo, what the fuck? Everyone should be dead.

27:25.840 --> 27:27.840
Yet nobody is.

27:28.600 --> 27:31.600
We saw a few bad people, so it's fine.

27:31.600 --> 27:35.600
I think everyone just likes the visual of

27:35.600 --> 27:38.600
a snowstorm of ash.

27:38.600 --> 27:41.600
Because they did kind of the same thing with Game of Thrones, right?

27:41.600 --> 27:43.600
Four horses, right?

27:43.600 --> 27:45.600
I left your son to die, because I'm

27:45.600 --> 27:47.600
kind of shit at this whole queening thing.

27:51.600 --> 27:53.600
It's fine, he's fine.

27:54.600 --> 27:56.600
He still has to say no.

27:57.360 --> 27:59.360
Yeah.

27:59.360 --> 28:01.360
He's still plot relevant.

28:01.360 --> 28:03.360
Also, I'm pretty sure her plate armor should be very, very

28:03.360 --> 28:05.360
warm at this point.

28:05.360 --> 28:07.360
Yeah.

28:07.360 --> 28:09.360
A little bit uncomfortable.

28:09.360 --> 28:11.360
They cast heat metal on it.

28:11.360 --> 28:13.360
The ash that's collecting on it, making it even warmer.

28:13.360 --> 28:15.360
Hold on, Numenor set their camp?

28:15.360 --> 28:17.360
I thought they just galloped in the whole fucking way.

28:17.360 --> 28:19.360
No, no, no. You must understand.

28:19.360 --> 28:21.360
Dev, plot says camp.

28:21.360 --> 28:23.360
Okay.

28:23.360 --> 28:25.360
Numenorians established a base on the perimeter of the ash.

28:26.120 --> 28:28.120
The orcs will move in daylight now.

28:28.120 --> 28:30.120
No, they won't.

28:30.120 --> 28:32.120
This is how the orcs should move.

28:32.120 --> 28:34.120
This is how they do it.

28:34.120 --> 28:36.120
No, they do it by a fucking magic.

28:36.120 --> 28:38.120
The clouds that cover the orcs

28:38.120 --> 28:40.120
when they are invading the world of Men

28:40.120 --> 28:43.120
isn't ash, it's fucking magic.

28:43.120 --> 28:45.120
Yeah, didn't Sauron summon

28:45.120 --> 28:47.120
thunderclouds, basically?

28:48.120 --> 28:50.120
It's fine, there's enough ash for them

28:50.120 --> 28:52.120
to move through the daylight.

28:52.120 --> 28:54.120
They explained it.

28:54.880 --> 28:56.880
Yes, give the child your primary means

28:56.880 --> 28:58.880
of defense after talking about how the orcs

28:58.880 --> 29:00.880
can move in daylight now.

29:00.880 --> 29:02.880
Thank you for handing me this, Swede.

29:02.880 --> 29:04.880
I have no training whatsoever.

29:04.880 --> 29:06.880
I'm far more likely to cut myself

29:06.880 --> 29:08.880
rather than the enemy, but thanks anyways.

29:08.880 --> 29:10.880
Yeah, swords are actually fairly

29:10.880 --> 29:12.880
tricky weapons.

29:12.880 --> 29:14.880
Wait, did she have two of them?

29:14.880 --> 29:16.880
No, she just gave him

29:16.880 --> 29:18.880
her only weapon.

29:18.880 --> 29:20.880
Oh no, she has that knife.

29:20.880 --> 29:22.880
The ice climbing knife.

29:23.640 --> 29:25.640
I've downgraded my equipment to crap here.

29:25.640 --> 29:27.640
You're level 2,

29:27.640 --> 29:29.640
have this level 16 sword.

29:29.640 --> 29:31.640
She has to level her knife skills.

29:31.640 --> 29:33.640
It looks even worse when it's dirty.

29:33.640 --> 29:35.640
How much further should we reach the encampment?

29:37.640 --> 29:39.640
Are we there yet?

29:39.640 --> 29:41.640
I know this is slow, isn't it?

29:41.640 --> 29:43.640
Were you not there

29:43.640 --> 29:45.640
when you set it up, Queen?

29:47.640 --> 29:49.640
I have the Breaking Bad looks.

29:49.640 --> 29:51.640
I was expecting her to hit her face again.

29:51.640 --> 29:53.640
I thought they were going to have to like, thwap.

29:57.640 --> 29:59.640
My queen, stop asking questions.

29:59.640 --> 30:01.640
She really is just complaining, Jesus.

30:02.640 --> 30:04.640
Freaking whiny ass little queen, Christ's sake.

30:16.640 --> 30:18.640
She's blind!

30:21.640 --> 30:23.640
She doesn't.

30:25.640 --> 30:27.640
I do kind of feel bad for her.

30:36.640 --> 30:38.640
Okay, that shot looked like

30:38.640 --> 30:40.640
they were just walking through a regular forest

30:40.640 --> 30:42.640
and they just kind of tinted it grey.

30:42.640 --> 30:44.640
Like,

30:44.640 --> 30:46.640
like a version of Day for Night.

30:46.640 --> 30:48.640
But instead of blue, it was like

30:48.640 --> 30:50.640
red and grey.

30:51.640 --> 30:53.640
I was going to see that a part of the tree

30:53.640 --> 30:55.640
is healed or something.

30:55.640 --> 30:57.640
We're not going to see it.

30:57.640 --> 30:59.640
There we go.

30:59.640 --> 31:01.640
It's a flower now.

31:01.640 --> 31:03.640
The flower's coming out.

31:03.640 --> 31:05.640
The thing is, he's done as much bad

31:05.640 --> 31:07.640
as he's done good.

31:07.640 --> 31:09.640
Precisely because they don't want it to be obvious.

31:09.640 --> 31:11.640
The problem is, if you do that,

31:11.640 --> 31:13.640
it also means that there's no actual

31:13.640 --> 31:15.640
building of the character.

31:15.640 --> 31:17.640
It's just building of the plot.

31:17.640 --> 31:19.640
Like, if this guy is a wizard now,

31:21.640 --> 31:23.640
he's done so much fucking damage

31:23.640 --> 31:25.640
to the half-woods.

31:25.640 --> 31:27.640
Like, by bumbling around.

31:27.640 --> 31:29.640
He's almost killed the few of them a couple of times.

31:29.640 --> 31:31.640
He's almost frozen that chick's hands off.

31:33.640 --> 31:35.640
Not to mention killing all of the Fireflies

31:35.640 --> 31:37.640
with his bullshit magic.

31:37.640 --> 31:39.640
And I can gather more.

31:39.640 --> 31:41.640
But he's a confused hobble myth.

31:41.640 --> 31:43.640
Yeah, it's not his fault.

31:43.640 --> 31:45.640
He didn't know any better.

31:45.640 --> 31:47.640
Listen, Lilith, you're in...

31:47.640 --> 31:49.640
I will use it to keep the

31:49.640 --> 31:51.640
doctors away.

31:51.640 --> 31:53.640
Lilith, you're in California, right?

31:53.640 --> 31:55.640
You probably see like a dozen guys like that a day

31:55.640 --> 31:57.640
all bumbling around.

31:57.640 --> 31:59.640
I've seen the videos.

31:59.640 --> 32:01.640
They're walking around on fentanyl or whatever.

32:01.640 --> 32:03.640
They be in downtown.

32:05.640 --> 32:07.640
Is she

32:07.640 --> 32:09.640
sharpening the wooden wheel with a rock?

32:09.640 --> 32:11.640
Yep.

32:11.640 --> 32:13.640
What?

32:13.640 --> 32:15.640
It's like a spirit.

32:17.640 --> 32:19.640
Everything's just an allegory

32:19.640 --> 32:21.640
to the other movies and the books.

32:21.640 --> 32:23.640
It's terrible.

32:23.640 --> 32:25.640
This show has nothing original about it.

32:25.640 --> 32:27.640
Does that remind you of the movie?

32:27.640 --> 32:29.640
She's sharpening the wheel

32:29.640 --> 32:31.640
with the rock.

32:31.640 --> 32:33.640
Why?

32:33.640 --> 32:35.640
Because she needs to do something on the set

32:35.640 --> 32:37.640
that makes it look like she's doing something.

32:37.640 --> 32:39.640
Simple.

32:39.640 --> 32:41.640
So they hand her a rock, they hand her a wheel.

32:41.640 --> 32:43.640
Here, rub this rock against the wheel.

32:43.640 --> 32:45.640
It'll make you look, uh, working.

32:45.640 --> 32:47.640
Trust me, you'll get a job after this.

32:47.640 --> 32:49.640
Are you sure?

32:49.640 --> 32:51.640
Jesus, I thought...

32:51.640 --> 32:53.640
I tuned out there

32:53.640 --> 32:55.640
for a minute and I thought you were doing like a casting

32:55.640 --> 32:57.640
couch thing.

32:57.640 --> 32:59.640
I was thinking about it.

33:03.640 --> 33:05.640
It's like, kid, I just met you five

33:05.640 --> 33:07.640
minutes ago.

33:11.640 --> 33:13.640
How do you

33:13.640 --> 33:15.640
know what happened?

33:15.640 --> 33:17.640
Yeah.

33:17.640 --> 33:19.640
Yeah, don't really know.

33:19.640 --> 33:21.640
Oh, I should have known that the old guy would turn

33:21.640 --> 33:23.640
the damn thing.

33:23.640 --> 33:25.640
And that he had the sword

33:25.640 --> 33:27.640
to begin with?

33:27.640 --> 33:29.640
What?

33:29.640 --> 33:31.640
All he knows is that he didn't have it.

33:31.640 --> 33:33.640
Yes, this is one mighty

33:33.640 --> 33:35.640
ass fucking leap of logic here.

33:35.640 --> 33:37.640
Like, I don't have a sword, a volcano explodes.

33:37.640 --> 33:39.640
Uh huh.

33:41.640 --> 33:43.640
Oh hey, the orcs arrived. Lucky.

33:43.640 --> 33:45.640
I guess that's

33:45.640 --> 33:47.640
why they had to take them prisoners so that

33:47.640 --> 33:49.640
they could live to threaten the party later.

33:49.640 --> 33:51.640
The orcs

33:51.640 --> 33:53.640
just smell them.

33:53.640 --> 33:55.640
Yeah, they should be able to, eh?

33:55.640 --> 33:57.640
The orc sense

33:57.640 --> 33:59.640
of smell varies considerably based upon

33:59.640 --> 34:01.640
what the block of mass is.

34:01.640 --> 34:03.640
Also, shouldn't their scent

34:03.640 --> 34:05.640
be slightly masked due to all the ash?

34:05.640 --> 34:07.640
Yeah, I guess so, huh?

34:07.640 --> 34:09.640
Also, shouldn't the orcs be covered in ash, too?

34:09.640 --> 34:11.640
Now, they're the ones

34:11.640 --> 34:13.640
hiding underground.

34:13.640 --> 34:15.640
That guy

34:15.640 --> 34:17.640
looks surprisingly

34:17.640 --> 34:19.640
un-ashed.

34:19.640 --> 34:21.640
Also, I love how the orcs who see in the dark

34:21.640 --> 34:23.640
keep using fucking torches.

34:23.640 --> 34:25.640
When you

34:25.640 --> 34:27.640
see what they are...

34:27.640 --> 34:29.640
I mean, it's better than

34:29.640 --> 34:31.640
Game of Thrones, I guess, where everything is dark.

34:31.640 --> 34:33.640
Yeah.

34:33.640 --> 34:35.640
Is he gonna mine it himself?

34:35.640 --> 34:37.640
These two

34:37.640 --> 34:39.640
are probably the best part of the show.

34:39.640 --> 34:41.640
Consistently.

34:41.640 --> 34:43.640
Yep.

34:43.640 --> 34:45.640
It's the only part I actually pay attention, really.

34:45.640 --> 34:47.640
He found a chasm full of myth.

35:03.640 --> 35:05.640
Wait a second.

35:07.640 --> 35:09.640
Arch, I know you know something about

35:09.640 --> 35:11.640
about this sort of thing.

35:11.640 --> 35:13.640
About this sort of thing, specifically.

35:13.640 --> 35:15.640
Is that how

35:15.640 --> 35:17.640
veins of ore work?

35:17.640 --> 35:19.640
Oh, yeah, totally.

35:19.640 --> 35:21.640
No, it's not embedded in the rock or anything.

35:21.640 --> 35:23.640
It's dramatically placed

35:23.640 --> 35:25.640
on the surface of rocks.

35:25.640 --> 35:27.640
That way, you can look at it and go,

35:27.640 --> 35:29.640
gold!

35:33.640 --> 35:35.640
Five minute walk back home.

35:35.640 --> 35:37.640
I like the tiny drizzle of

35:37.640 --> 35:39.640
water in the background there.

35:39.640 --> 35:41.640
If this were like a

35:41.640 --> 35:43.640
Disney movie, this is where he'd break

35:43.640 --> 35:45.640
out in song.

35:45.640 --> 35:47.640
This is the exact moment.

35:47.640 --> 35:49.640
Yep.

35:49.640 --> 35:51.640
A whole new friendship.

35:51.640 --> 35:53.640
Something inside you

35:53.640 --> 35:55.640
is ill-formed.

35:55.640 --> 35:57.640
Jesus.

35:57.640 --> 35:59.640
That's harsh.

35:59.640 --> 36:01.640
Harsh?

36:01.640 --> 36:03.640
Are dwarven babies

36:03.640 --> 36:05.640
born with beards, too?

36:05.640 --> 36:07.640
That was a euphemism.

36:07.640 --> 36:09.640
Duh.

36:21.640 --> 36:23.640
How dare you have a friend?

36:31.640 --> 36:33.640
Great, you just did it.

36:33.640 --> 36:35.640
Assassinate him.

36:35.640 --> 36:37.640
No one will witness it.

36:41.640 --> 36:43.640
Oh, no, his, uh, thing.

36:43.640 --> 36:45.640
I don't know what that is, but yeah.

36:45.640 --> 36:47.640
It was definitely a thing.

36:47.640 --> 36:49.640
Yeah, it's probably like his

36:49.640 --> 36:51.640
princely thing.

36:51.640 --> 36:53.640
It's like in case somebody was looking at him

36:53.640 --> 36:55.640
and was like, who the fuck are you?

36:55.640 --> 36:57.640
And he lifts his beard.

36:57.640 --> 36:59.640
Here's my cattle collar.

36:59.640 --> 37:01.640
Here's my cattle collar.

37:05.640 --> 37:07.640
It's like, I'll just take it with me.

37:07.640 --> 37:09.640
Looks back,

37:09.640 --> 37:11.640
oh, I probably should.

37:11.640 --> 37:13.640
Oh, you have to say it plot-wise.

37:13.640 --> 37:15.640
It's not yours anymore.

37:19.640 --> 37:21.640
The writing was great.

37:21.640 --> 37:23.640
Wait, so what's his plan

37:23.640 --> 37:25.640
for the throne then?

37:25.640 --> 37:27.640
There's like another

37:27.640 --> 37:29.640
civil war and succession crisis.

37:29.640 --> 37:31.640
They sleep

37:31.640 --> 37:33.640
with that shit in their hair.

37:33.640 --> 37:35.640
Listen, all of the trees

37:35.640 --> 37:37.640
have regrown. Why? Because

37:37.640 --> 37:39.640
magic, that's why.

37:39.640 --> 37:41.640
Because he was good and you were wrong, barge.

37:41.640 --> 37:43.640
I'll never understand.

37:43.640 --> 37:45.640
There's sodom apples.

37:45.640 --> 37:47.640
Oh, wow.

37:47.640 --> 37:49.640
We'll go to market with all the

37:49.640 --> 37:51.640
crop we've got. What market?

37:51.640 --> 37:53.640
Yeah,

37:53.640 --> 37:55.640
didn't know they had markets.

37:55.640 --> 37:57.640
I think it's pre-capitalism, guys.

37:57.640 --> 37:59.640
Do they have a vibrant

37:59.640 --> 38:01.640
harfoot economy?

38:01.640 --> 38:03.640
Are there more harfoots?

38:03.640 --> 38:05.640
Yeah, no doctors will fuck with you now.

38:05.640 --> 38:07.640
Hurry, let's pick all of the apples

38:07.640 --> 38:09.640
as quickly as possible.

38:09.640 --> 38:11.640
That way they'll rot.

38:11.640 --> 38:13.640
Yeah, like, maybe they're moving on, I guess.

38:13.640 --> 38:15.640
They've got to get a bunch of them.

38:15.640 --> 38:17.640
A better feast, I guess.

38:17.640 --> 38:19.640
Yeah, but normally if they're making applesauce

38:19.640 --> 38:21.640
they try to preserve it

38:21.640 --> 38:23.640
instead of just picking all of it.

38:23.640 --> 38:25.640
Ooh, wait.

38:27.640 --> 38:29.640
They're supposed to be small people, right?

38:29.640 --> 38:31.640
Like three foot tall, whatever?

38:33.640 --> 38:35.640
Why is it that the apples are

38:35.640 --> 38:37.640
regular human-sized in their hands?

38:37.640 --> 38:39.640
Because Amazon doesn't care that much, Dev.

38:41.640 --> 38:43.640
Oh, look, all of the fish are dead.

38:43.640 --> 38:45.640
No?

38:45.640 --> 38:47.640
That's a big person foot.

38:47.640 --> 38:49.640
It's a big person, oh my no.

38:49.640 --> 38:51.640
Hey, bring the bucket, why did you leave

38:51.640 --> 38:53.640
the bucket? There's no reason to leave the bucket.

38:53.640 --> 38:55.640
Well, now the bucket's its own character

38:55.640 --> 38:57.640
going on an adventure.

38:57.640 --> 38:59.640
Oh good, the bucket will demonstrate to us

38:59.640 --> 39:01.640
the bad people.

39:01.640 --> 39:03.640
Oh no.

39:03.640 --> 39:05.640
It's like, aha, harfoots must be nearby.

39:05.640 --> 39:07.640
And for some reason

39:07.640 --> 39:09.640
they use human-sized buckets.

39:09.640 --> 39:11.640
That's weird.

39:11.640 --> 39:13.640
That would be really heavy for a harfoot.

39:13.640 --> 39:15.640
I know that would probably sound like a stickler, but

39:15.640 --> 39:17.640
the original movie did it so well,

39:17.640 --> 39:19.640
the size difference thing.

39:19.640 --> 39:21.640
And here, they really just don't fucking bother.

39:23.640 --> 39:25.640
Look, hmm, this tree seems very

39:25.640 --> 39:27.640
fruity. Let's destroy it.

39:31.640 --> 39:33.640
I hate the armor design in this

39:33.640 --> 39:35.640
fucking show so much.

39:35.640 --> 39:37.640
Oh, flour.

39:39.640 --> 39:41.640
How disgusting.

39:41.640 --> 39:43.640
I pluck at it.

39:43.640 --> 39:45.640
I look at it.

39:45.640 --> 39:47.640
You know, maybe I'm just a weirdo.

39:49.640 --> 39:51.640
But I do kind of find her hot in a weird way.

39:51.640 --> 39:53.640
Yeah, that does make you a weirdo.

39:53.640 --> 39:55.640
Oh, okay.

39:57.640 --> 39:59.640
That's not right, Death.

39:59.640 --> 40:01.640
I think so.

40:01.640 --> 40:03.640
Oh, I mean, either way. I can go both ways on this one.

40:03.640 --> 40:05.640
My turn.

40:05.640 --> 40:07.640
Death. Dumpster.

40:07.640 --> 40:09.640
In. Now.

40:09.640 --> 40:11.640
Blow it out.

40:11.640 --> 40:13.640
You know you want to.

40:13.640 --> 40:15.640
Gonna use her hand to do it, not blow it.

40:15.640 --> 40:17.640
Hmm.

40:17.640 --> 40:19.640
Well, that's unusual.

40:19.640 --> 40:21.640
Also,

40:21.640 --> 40:23.640
they're doing the height difference thing with the hill

40:23.640 --> 40:25.640
as a way to not

40:25.640 --> 40:27.640
do the size difference thing.

40:31.640 --> 40:33.640
Oh, shit.

40:33.640 --> 40:35.640
All the apples.

40:35.640 --> 40:37.640
They're all gonna die. Thank God.

40:41.640 --> 40:43.640
Damn, none of them were asleep inside of their carts

40:43.640 --> 40:45.640
when this happened. Quick, kill the wizards.

40:45.640 --> 40:47.640
Kill the wizards.

40:47.640 --> 40:49.640
At least all the apples will be cooked.

40:49.640 --> 40:51.640
Yeah.

40:51.640 --> 40:53.640
They weren't gonna preserve her.

40:53.640 --> 40:55.640
Also, every single cock-sucking

40:55.640 --> 40:57.640
one of the Harfoots were outside of their homes

40:57.640 --> 40:59.640
when this happened.

41:05.640 --> 41:07.640
At least kill some of them.

41:07.640 --> 41:09.640
Like, the black one. Kill him.

41:09.640 --> 41:11.640
He's not necessary anymore. He's done his part.

41:11.640 --> 41:13.640
Of course, Arch wants the black one dead.

41:13.640 --> 41:15.640
Someone, just kill some of them.

41:15.640 --> 41:17.640
Arch's racism is showing. Nope, too late.

41:17.640 --> 41:19.640
The only one who goes under the blackies.

41:19.640 --> 41:21.640
Fucking Harfoots.

41:23.640 --> 41:25.640
God, more people need to die

41:25.640 --> 41:27.640
in this show.

41:27.640 --> 41:29.640
Only specific

41:29.640 --> 41:31.640
colors, right, Arch?

41:31.640 --> 41:33.640
Sick bastard.

41:33.640 --> 41:35.640
All those rumors were true

41:35.640 --> 41:37.640
in the end, Arch.

41:37.640 --> 41:39.640
I've just forced you to walk for days

41:39.640 --> 41:41.640
with a giant gash in your side.

41:41.640 --> 41:43.640
Well, okay.

41:43.640 --> 41:45.640
I am horse, I speak English.

41:45.640 --> 41:47.640
My master's still arrived.

41:47.640 --> 41:49.640
He's dead, Beric.

41:49.640 --> 41:51.640
You must give him up, Beric.

41:55.640 --> 41:57.640
Well, I mean, he walked all this way here,

41:57.640 --> 41:59.640
so clearly he will listen to some of you.

41:59.640 --> 42:01.640
You gonna turn him loose so he can run home to daddy?

42:01.640 --> 42:03.640
Yep.

42:03.640 --> 42:05.640
Oh yeah, he's gonna go rescue fucking Isildur.

42:05.640 --> 42:07.640
Right, why the fuck not?

42:07.640 --> 42:09.640
I mean, why are you surprised,

42:09.640 --> 42:11.640
Arch? Come on, get with the program here.

42:11.640 --> 42:13.640
Thank you.

42:13.640 --> 42:15.640
I'm going to find Measter now.

42:17.640 --> 42:19.640
Measter.

42:19.640 --> 42:21.640
Oh my god, it's like this thing where the horse rescues

42:21.640 --> 42:23.640
Aragorn.

42:25.640 --> 42:27.640
They're just copying the other movies now.

42:29.640 --> 42:31.640
I hate this fucking show.

42:33.640 --> 42:35.640
Yes, it would have saved all of us

42:35.640 --> 42:37.640
a lot of television.

42:37.640 --> 42:39.640
Yes, let's just walk into the queen's tent.

42:39.640 --> 42:41.640
I'm sure there's no guards here or anything.

42:41.640 --> 42:43.640
Yep, just...

42:43.640 --> 42:45.640
It's fine.

42:45.640 --> 42:47.640
Just straight in.

42:47.640 --> 42:49.640
With your sword and all.

42:49.640 --> 42:51.640
I don't think that's the queen's tent.

42:51.640 --> 42:53.640
Yeah.

42:53.640 --> 42:55.640
That's a fancy looking hospital tent.

42:55.640 --> 42:57.640
Mummy?

42:57.640 --> 42:59.640
Not mummy.

42:59.640 --> 43:01.640
Mummy.

43:01.640 --> 43:03.640
Oh, was I right?

43:03.640 --> 43:05.640
Is she gone?

43:05.640 --> 43:07.640
That's got to be a fake out.

43:09.640 --> 43:11.640
It's got to be a stranger.

43:11.640 --> 43:13.640
Yep.

43:13.640 --> 43:15.640
But they already did that though.

43:15.640 --> 43:17.640
She's going to show up in three, two...

43:17.640 --> 43:19.640
I kind of hope she's dead.

43:19.640 --> 43:21.640
Yep, there you go.

43:21.640 --> 43:23.640
I'm so good at calling this shit, Arch.

43:23.640 --> 43:25.640
You knew it.

43:25.640 --> 43:27.640
I'm the best one now.

43:27.640 --> 43:29.640
I hate you, Cib.

43:29.640 --> 43:31.640
I repeat my previous statement.

43:31.640 --> 43:33.640
More people need to die in this show.

43:33.640 --> 43:35.640
Yeah, was anyone thinking,

43:35.640 --> 43:37.640
like, oh god, I hope they don't kill her.

43:37.640 --> 43:39.640
She was so integral.

43:39.640 --> 43:41.640
Oh no, you're alive too.

43:45.640 --> 43:47.640
You guys have like no ash on you either.

43:47.640 --> 43:49.640
Like, you're just completely fine.

43:49.640 --> 43:51.640
I mean, I assume they just put some on him.

43:51.640 --> 43:53.640
They've had days to wipe off their face.

43:53.640 --> 43:55.640
You know what I like the most?

43:55.640 --> 43:57.640
It's the fact that his hair is still short and cropped.

43:57.640 --> 43:59.640
Like, it's been...

43:59.640 --> 44:01.640
fucking weeks now.

44:01.640 --> 44:05.640
It feels like this show is just written by an algorithm.

44:05.640 --> 44:07.640
It kind of does.

44:11.640 --> 44:13.640
Ah, yes. Keep writing.

44:13.640 --> 44:15.640
None will... None need... No!

44:15.640 --> 44:17.640
Puts on a fucking blindfold.

44:17.640 --> 44:19.640
Just in case people didn't know.

44:21.640 --> 44:23.640
Ah, like it's...

44:23.640 --> 44:25.640
It's the lack of attention to detail that pisses me off so much.

44:25.640 --> 44:27.640
Because, yeah, okay.

44:27.640 --> 44:29.640
It makes sense that the queen would be strong,

44:29.640 --> 44:31.640
with her weakness, you know, keeping morale up.

44:31.640 --> 44:35.640
Then the moment she's back to camp, now tie a blindfold on me so everyone will know.

44:35.640 --> 44:39.640
Maybe she can touch her and make her feel better.

44:39.640 --> 44:41.640
Oh, a gentle push ought to do that.

44:41.640 --> 44:43.640
Ha ha!

44:43.640 --> 44:45.640
Do not spend your pity on me, El.

44:47.640 --> 44:49.640
Save it.

44:49.640 --> 44:51.640
For our enemies.

44:51.640 --> 44:53.640
Why should she pity her enemies?

44:53.640 --> 44:55.640
For they do not know what they have begun.

44:55.640 --> 44:59.640
Oh my Jesus, are we actually doing the Jesus... We are doing the Jesus thing.

45:01.640 --> 45:03.640
She's like, I want revenge.

45:03.640 --> 45:07.640
Like, they're talking as if they've fought some kind of great battle here and been defeated.

45:07.640 --> 45:09.640
Like, none of this has happened.

45:09.640 --> 45:11.640
A mountain blew up.

45:11.640 --> 45:13.640
Like, are you going to fight the mountain?

45:13.640 --> 45:15.640
This scene is so random. Oh my God.

45:17.640 --> 45:21.640
Captain, I'm doubting and having second doubts. Oh!

45:21.640 --> 45:23.640
Like, you know how you...

45:23.640 --> 45:27.640
You know how you get the AI music that sounds pretty good, but just slightly off?

45:27.640 --> 45:29.640
You get, like, AI pictures and artwork now?

45:29.640 --> 45:35.640
Even the big boob AI woman that Sargon has been posting, there's just something slightly off, but it's like 99...

45:35.640 --> 45:37.640
Yeah, it's like 99% good.

45:37.640 --> 45:39.640
That's what this show feels like.

45:39.640 --> 45:45.640
It's like all the moments, all the story beats, all, like, the five-second waits for something to happen.

45:45.640 --> 45:47.640
It's all so predictable.

45:47.640 --> 45:49.640
It feels like a computer wrote it.

45:49.640 --> 45:51.640
It's soulless.

45:51.640 --> 45:53.640
Is that all you think we have left in us?

45:53.640 --> 45:55.640
We're horror foots.

45:55.640 --> 45:57.640
Yeah.

45:57.640 --> 45:59.640
Yeah, that means we're really, like, self-adventurous.

45:59.640 --> 46:01.640
No, it doesn't.

46:01.640 --> 46:03.640
The horror foots go to war.

46:03.640 --> 46:05.640
Okay, listen here.

46:05.640 --> 46:09.640
The horror foots will leave people behind if they've got a fucked up ankle.

46:09.640 --> 46:13.640
They will leave them to die if they can't walk along with their...

46:13.640 --> 46:15.640
They won't be able to put them on the cart.

46:15.640 --> 46:17.640
And now it's like, we're horror foots.

46:17.640 --> 46:21.640
That means we're really tough and could survive having our entire civilization burned to the ground.

46:21.640 --> 46:23.640
No, you're dead.

46:23.640 --> 46:25.640
All of you, dead.

46:25.640 --> 46:27.640
Starved to death.

46:27.640 --> 46:29.640
Now.

46:29.640 --> 46:31.640
This is such bullshit.

46:31.640 --> 46:33.640
They were literally ready to leave this fucking behind because he twisted his ankle.

46:33.640 --> 46:35.640
Mhm.

46:35.640 --> 46:37.640
I hate this fucking thing.

46:37.640 --> 46:39.640
Well, like I said.

46:39.640 --> 46:41.640
Or like Dev said, it's an algorithm.

46:41.640 --> 46:43.640
Like, this whole thing is just...

46:43.640 --> 46:45.640
Literally, it's like, now the horror foots are down on their luck.

46:45.640 --> 46:47.640
So now somebody has to be like, we can do this.

46:47.640 --> 46:49.640
And then everyone goes like, yeah.

46:49.640 --> 46:51.640
Yeah.

46:51.640 --> 46:53.640
Yeah, you actually can do it.

46:53.640 --> 46:55.640
The horror friendship.

46:55.640 --> 46:57.640
Arch, I feel like today, more than any other day,

46:57.640 --> 46:59.640
you're really anti this show.

46:59.640 --> 47:01.640
Like, the hatred of this show.

47:01.640 --> 47:03.640
Yeah.

47:03.640 --> 47:05.640
Like, the hatred's flowing today.

47:05.640 --> 47:07.640
Caught him on a bad day.

47:07.640 --> 47:09.640
The thing is, like,

47:09.640 --> 47:11.640
so much of this has just been boring

47:11.640 --> 47:13.640
and stupid, but

47:13.640 --> 47:15.640
now the story beats

47:15.640 --> 47:17.640
are coming together and I'm finally realizing

47:17.640 --> 47:19.640
I really hate the story.

47:19.640 --> 47:21.640
Well, yeah, because initially it was like,

47:21.640 --> 47:23.640
well, maybe they'll pull it off.

47:23.640 --> 47:25.640
Maybe they'll go in an interesting direction.

47:25.640 --> 47:27.640
And now it's like, well,

47:27.640 --> 47:29.640
no, they're not.

47:29.640 --> 47:31.640
Not without us.

47:31.640 --> 47:33.640
Not without us.

47:33.640 --> 47:35.640
Ah, fuck, god, kill me now.

47:35.640 --> 47:37.640
Shoot me.

47:37.640 --> 47:39.640
It's time for us to go to heaven.

47:45.640 --> 47:49.640
I'm a trained finder, what you go with them looks a brown person.

47:49.640 --> 47:51.640
Me?

47:51.640 --> 47:53.640
Listen, you're an expensive actor.

47:53.640 --> 47:55.640
We're using you.

47:55.640 --> 47:57.640
Oh.

48:01.640 --> 48:03.640
I work right all the time.

48:05.640 --> 48:07.640
I'll fetch provisions and get me stick.

48:07.640 --> 48:09.640
I'm coming with you.

48:11.640 --> 48:13.640
It's a good stick.

48:13.640 --> 48:15.640
I hate all of you.

48:15.640 --> 48:17.640
I hope so.

48:17.640 --> 48:19.640
So, I recently read an article

48:19.640 --> 48:21.640
where someone was complaining that

48:21.640 --> 48:23.640
all of the Harfoot stuff was racist

48:23.640 --> 48:25.640
because they all do really bad

48:25.640 --> 48:27.640
Irish accents.

48:27.640 --> 48:29.640
Does that look like a painting in the background?

48:29.640 --> 48:31.640
The backdrop looks flat.

48:31.640 --> 48:33.640
I agree.

48:33.640 --> 48:35.640
I, too, am decidedly racist

48:35.640 --> 48:37.640
against the Irish, and I fucking hate the Harfoots.

48:37.640 --> 48:39.640
Oh my god,

48:39.640 --> 48:41.640
Queen, if you wanted to keep morale up,

48:41.640 --> 48:43.640
like... No, that was earlier.

48:43.640 --> 48:45.640
It's different.

48:45.640 --> 48:47.640
It's different now.

48:47.640 --> 48:49.640
Also, they've only got one ship.

48:49.640 --> 48:51.640
I guess they left the other two behind.

48:55.640 --> 48:57.640
Is yester-eve a word?

48:59.640 --> 49:01.640
No.

49:01.640 --> 49:03.640
No.

49:03.640 --> 49:05.640
Convenient.

49:05.640 --> 49:07.640
He can't ride.

49:07.640 --> 49:09.640
He's gonna.

49:09.640 --> 49:11.640
A vast gash on the side.

49:11.640 --> 49:13.640
Like, his insides are

49:13.640 --> 49:15.640
about to be his outsides, and you're gonna

49:15.640 --> 49:17.640
put him on a horse.

49:17.640 --> 49:19.640
You gotta shake it out of him, Arch.

49:21.640 --> 49:23.640
I also love how...

49:23.640 --> 49:25.640
One episode ago,

49:25.640 --> 49:27.640
he was like, I don't want to go home.

49:27.640 --> 49:29.640
Now he's like, I will not abandon them

49:29.640 --> 49:31.640
to a mere volcanic explosion.

49:31.640 --> 49:33.640
Like, I'm a king now.

49:33.640 --> 49:35.640
And my people need me.

49:35.640 --> 49:37.640
You know, that is strange

49:37.640 --> 49:39.640
that he was, like, laying in bed looking like he was

49:39.640 --> 49:41.640
about to die at Death's Door.

49:41.640 --> 49:43.640
And now he's... he's walking.

49:43.640 --> 49:45.640
I'm actually okay.

49:45.640 --> 49:47.640
Thanks for the pep talk, guys.

49:47.640 --> 49:49.640
Yeah. You see, wait.

49:49.640 --> 49:51.640
I thought they were gonna, like, get him ready for

49:51.640 --> 49:53.640
travel. He's like, I guess I'll just fucking go.

49:53.640 --> 49:55.640
Alright. Can you ride? No?

49:55.640 --> 49:57.640
Yeah.

49:57.640 --> 49:59.640
Like, he's... this wound needs

49:59.640 --> 50:01.640
11 medicine or he'll die.

50:01.640 --> 50:03.640
Okay. Well, I guess he can ride, then.

50:07.640 --> 50:09.640
Thank you.

50:09.640 --> 50:11.640
Thank you. This is an enormously

50:11.640 --> 50:13.640
precious 11 heirloom.

50:13.640 --> 50:15.640
Thank you very much.

50:15.640 --> 50:17.640
Goes to the next merchant.

50:17.640 --> 50:19.640
He's like, oh, you just sold it for me.

50:19.640 --> 50:21.640
He's like, yeah.

50:21.640 --> 50:23.640
He'll probably get a good price for it, though.

50:23.640 --> 50:25.640
Southland power.

50:32.640 --> 50:35.640
Oh, they start out at a gallop right away.

50:35.640 --> 50:37.640
Don't trot or anything to take it easy

50:37.640 --> 50:39.640
on his wound. Just go on.

50:39.640 --> 50:41.640
These scenes aren't realism.

50:41.640 --> 50:43.640
They're shot for symbolism.

50:43.640 --> 50:45.640
I fucking hate this show so much.

50:45.640 --> 50:47.640
Like, now that the story's

50:47.640 --> 50:49.640
actually come into its own, I fucking

50:49.640 --> 50:51.640
realize how much I dislike it all.

50:51.640 --> 50:53.640
Oh, dude.

50:53.640 --> 50:55.640
Lilith, you mentioned the Sargon faces earlier.

50:55.640 --> 50:57.640
They're like... they're like Pogchamp Sargons.

50:59.640 --> 51:01.640
Should be an emote.

51:01.640 --> 51:03.640
On the server.

51:03.640 --> 51:05.640
It's your father's.

51:05.640 --> 51:07.640
Yeah, it's your dad. Go fucking kill him.

51:07.640 --> 51:09.640
Now.

51:09.640 --> 51:11.640
Too suspicious.

51:11.640 --> 51:13.640
His mind too feeble.

51:13.640 --> 51:15.640
Kill him.

51:15.640 --> 51:17.640
You should kill him.

51:17.640 --> 51:19.640
Too many crests he hurls to the floor.

51:21.640 --> 51:23.640
One day this will be your king.

51:23.640 --> 51:25.640
You're the real one.

51:25.640 --> 51:27.640
Oh my gosh, she's Lady McFeth-ing him.

51:27.640 --> 51:29.640
Wait. Arch.

51:29.640 --> 51:31.640
Make the racist comment we all know you want to make.

51:31.640 --> 51:33.640
Go.

51:33.640 --> 51:35.640
Goddammit, you're putting me on the spot.

51:35.640 --> 51:37.640
What am I supposed to say?

51:37.640 --> 51:39.640
Is it a black joke?

51:39.640 --> 51:41.640
Is it a Jew joke?

51:41.640 --> 51:43.640
Arch, it's the only thing you ever do

51:43.640 --> 51:45.640
which is black jokes. Come on.

51:45.640 --> 51:49.640
Yeah, but I don't see how this relates to her being black.

51:49.640 --> 51:51.640
You'll find a way.

51:51.640 --> 51:53.640
No, I'm leaning more towards Jewish right now.

51:55.640 --> 51:57.640
You're so temperamental with your racism.

52:01.640 --> 52:03.640
I'm going to dig.

52:03.640 --> 52:05.640
Black people don't dig.

52:05.640 --> 52:09.640
Arch, she's just a black Israelite, okay?

52:09.640 --> 52:11.640
Look, he figured it out.

52:11.640 --> 52:13.640
Good job Arch, come on.

52:13.640 --> 52:15.640
Fucking hell.

52:17.640 --> 52:19.640
I don't care how many dwarves have lost me.

52:19.640 --> 52:21.640
If the whole room's looking at Arch, it's going to be like,

52:21.640 --> 52:23.640
say the line, Arch.

52:23.640 --> 52:25.640
Yeah, basically.

52:25.640 --> 52:27.640
See, my racism is very organic, okay?

52:27.640 --> 52:29.640
I can't just turn it on and off like that.

52:31.640 --> 52:33.640
Are we going to see the balrog?

52:33.640 --> 52:35.640
Is the balrog going to burn the leaf?

52:35.640 --> 52:37.640
Come on, balrog.

52:37.640 --> 52:39.640
Come on, balrog.

52:39.640 --> 52:41.640
I know you're in there.

52:41.640 --> 52:43.640
Come on, balrog.

52:43.640 --> 52:45.640
Where the fuck is it going?

52:45.640 --> 52:47.640
It's going where the balrog is.

52:47.640 --> 52:49.640
Dude, it's glowing.

52:49.640 --> 52:51.640
Yes, step on it.

52:51.640 --> 52:53.640
No!

52:57.640 --> 52:59.640
It's a leaf!

52:59.640 --> 53:01.640
It's the balrog!

53:03.640 --> 53:05.640
At the end of the day,

53:05.640 --> 53:07.640
it wasn't Durin who digged deep

53:07.640 --> 53:09.640
and greatly, it was that cunt who threw

53:09.640 --> 53:11.640
a leaf in there and woke him.

53:11.640 --> 53:13.640
Yep.

53:13.640 --> 53:15.640
Hills that you should not litter.

53:15.640 --> 53:17.640
Hey, what do you think happened

53:17.640 --> 53:19.640
to the old man who opened the dam?

53:19.640 --> 53:21.640
Is he just dead?

53:21.640 --> 53:23.640
He's right there, dead.

53:23.640 --> 53:25.640
Is that him?

53:25.640 --> 53:27.640
Oh my fuck, I can't tell, it's all ashy.

53:31.640 --> 53:33.640
Oh, he named Mordor.

53:33.640 --> 53:35.640
Mordor.

53:37.640 --> 53:39.640
Ah, Birmingham.

53:45.640 --> 53:47.640
They call it Adar?

53:53.640 --> 53:55.640
The Southland under race, is it?

53:57.640 --> 53:59.640
Yep.

53:59.640 --> 54:01.640
Oh my god!

54:03.640 --> 54:05.640
Okay, they should have

54:05.640 --> 54:07.640
had someone say that.

54:07.640 --> 54:09.640
That should have been a line.

54:09.640 --> 54:11.640
Yeah, but it would have come out of nowhere.

54:11.640 --> 54:13.640
Like, what would that even be the lead up?

54:13.640 --> 54:15.640
Like, what are we going to name it? Hold on.

54:15.640 --> 54:17.640
Mordor. What does that mean?

54:17.640 --> 54:19.640
No, well, but...

54:19.640 --> 54:21.640
They could have also just left

54:21.640 --> 54:23.640
it without, and then like,

54:23.640 --> 54:25.640
weighed it a little bit.

54:25.640 --> 54:27.640
Also, wait, why was it called the eye?

54:27.640 --> 54:29.640
I was half expecting

54:29.640 --> 54:31.640
the Southlands to get

54:31.640 --> 54:33.640
Wait, wait, Kibbs, shut it up.

54:33.640 --> 54:35.640
Kibbs, figure it out.

54:35.640 --> 54:37.640
Shut up, Kibbs.

54:37.640 --> 54:39.640
We're on the opening of the episode right here.

54:39.640 --> 54:41.640
Wow, when fucking Galadriel

54:41.640 --> 54:43.640
is like opening her eyes and being like

54:43.640 --> 54:45.640
Darth Vader.

54:45.640 --> 54:47.640
We could also extend the list to the fact that Mordor

54:47.640 --> 54:49.640
is a thing, but that's not really

54:49.640 --> 54:51.640
related directly to Sauron, because it would require

54:51.640 --> 54:53.640
the tower, and the tower takes thousands of years to build.

54:53.640 --> 54:55.640
Yep, yep, yep.

54:55.640 --> 54:57.640
They're obviously appealing to that, right?

54:57.640 --> 54:59.640
And also, what's her name lost her eyes?

54:59.640 --> 55:01.640
There's that.

55:01.640 --> 55:03.640
Oh, too many eyes.

55:03.640 --> 55:05.640
But,

55:05.640 --> 55:07.640
what would have been

55:07.640 --> 55:09.640
far, far better.

55:09.640 --> 55:11.640
Just name the episode Mordor.

55:11.640 --> 55:13.640
Okay, that sucks, but name it Mordor.

55:13.640 --> 55:15.640
And then just end on that

55:15.640 --> 55:17.640
exact scene. What do we name it?

55:17.640 --> 55:19.640
But then don't show that lame

55:19.640 --> 55:21.640
thing where the word Mordor

55:21.640 --> 55:23.640
fades in. Don't show that.

55:23.640 --> 55:25.640
Almost anything else.

55:25.640 --> 55:27.640
If you just name the episode Mordor

55:27.640 --> 55:29.640
and then end it on

55:29.640 --> 55:31.640
what do we name the new land?

55:31.640 --> 55:33.640
And then have it like a long fade out.

55:33.640 --> 55:35.640
It would work, it would actually work.

55:35.640 --> 55:37.640
It's like so desperate to be like, guys, you know

55:37.640 --> 55:39.640
Mordor, you know the thing.

55:39.640 --> 55:41.640
The thing, by the way, guys.

55:41.640 --> 55:43.640
Yeah, exactly. Nailed it on the head with that.

55:43.640 --> 55:45.640
Ugh.

55:45.640 --> 55:47.640
It's painful.

55:47.640 --> 55:49.640
But it's because it doesn't

55:49.640 --> 55:51.640
speak for itself, right?

55:51.640 --> 55:53.640
Everything about this show has been,

55:53.640 --> 55:55.640
remember when the movies did this?

55:55.640 --> 55:57.640
Yes. It's very

55:57.640 --> 55:59.640
referential, and that's the issue.

55:59.640 --> 56:01.640
The thing that you guys like, right?

56:01.640 --> 56:03.640
Yeah. It's the I member berries.

56:03.640 --> 56:05.640
It's like, remember guys? Remember when

56:05.640 --> 56:07.640
Photobag, I just went on a vid,

56:07.640 --> 56:09.640
I member. It's like, okay.

56:11.640 --> 56:13.640
Fuck.

56:13.640 --> 56:15.640
Fuck.

56:15.640 --> 56:17.640
Okay.

56:17.640 --> 56:19.640
This is exactly it though.

56:19.640 --> 56:21.640
Up until this point, we've been watching this show

56:21.640 --> 56:23.640
and mostly it's just

56:23.640 --> 56:25.640
the scene boring.

56:25.640 --> 56:27.640
And occasionally there's been a scene which Dev,

56:27.640 --> 56:29.640
the simp, has gone like, this isn't too bad,

56:29.640 --> 56:31.640
and everyone else has yelled at him.

56:31.640 --> 56:33.640
But this, finally now,

56:33.640 --> 56:35.640
after seven hours,

56:35.640 --> 56:37.640
the story has

56:37.640 --> 56:39.640
culminated,

56:39.640 --> 56:41.640
and I realize I hate the story.

56:41.640 --> 56:43.640
Like, that's literally what we've

56:43.640 --> 56:45.640
arrived at here. The story has finally

56:45.640 --> 56:47.640
arrived, and I wish it would never have.

56:49.640 --> 56:51.640
You wish you'd just be dicking around with

56:51.640 --> 56:53.640
what's bumbling in the forest for

56:53.640 --> 56:55.640
a full, you know,

56:55.640 --> 56:57.640
eight or nine or ten episodes.

56:57.640 --> 56:59.640
At least they're not gonna let you in.

56:59.640 --> 57:01.640
It's like mystery box storytelling, right?

57:01.640 --> 57:03.640
Where they're like, what could this be?

57:03.640 --> 57:05.640
It could be really interesting.

57:05.640 --> 57:07.640
And, like, as long as you don't know what it is,

57:07.640 --> 57:09.640
it's like, sure, it could be interesting.

57:09.640 --> 57:11.640
And then you know what it is, and it's like, oh.

57:11.640 --> 57:13.640
Well, the problem is though,

57:13.640 --> 57:15.640
the problem is though, we know what it is

57:15.640 --> 57:17.640
because this is a prequel.

57:17.640 --> 57:19.640
There's no mystery boxes in a prequel.

57:19.640 --> 57:21.640
I mean, like, the sword.

57:21.640 --> 57:23.640
Like, we didn't know what it was, and then it's like, oh, it's a key.

57:23.640 --> 57:25.640
And it's like, oh.

57:25.640 --> 57:27.640
Yeah, but like, all the important mystery boxes,

57:27.640 --> 57:29.640
like, oh, we get it. It's obviously Mithril, right?

57:29.640 --> 57:31.640
Or it's obviously Mount Doom.

57:31.640 --> 57:33.640
Or it's obviously Creation of Mortals. Like, oh, okay.

57:33.640 --> 57:35.640
Then they make shit up.

57:35.640 --> 57:37.640
Where now Mithril is magical

57:37.640 --> 57:39.640
crack rock that saves the elves.

57:39.640 --> 57:41.640
It's so dumb. I hate it so much.

57:43.640 --> 57:45.640
Arch.

57:45.640 --> 57:47.640
Hold on, Dev. Same issue with, like,

57:47.640 --> 57:49.640
prequels, right? Because they're trying to,

57:49.640 --> 57:51.640
like, why did you want to watch the prequels?

57:51.640 --> 57:53.640
It was to figure out who Darth Vader was before he became

57:53.640 --> 57:55.640
Darth Vader, you know? How did he become that way?

57:55.640 --> 57:57.640
There was a mystery still

57:57.640 --> 57:59.640
that needed solving. We knew

57:59.640 --> 58:01.640
the result, but we didn't know how we got there.

58:01.640 --> 58:03.640
This doesn't really have

58:03.640 --> 58:05.640
that, does it?

58:05.640 --> 58:07.640
No, because it doesn't explain how you

58:07.640 --> 58:09.640
got there. It makes shit up.

58:09.640 --> 58:11.640
Yeah, exactly.

58:11.640 --> 58:13.640
None of it's canon, anyway.

58:13.640 --> 58:15.640
Like, okay, well, how did the dwarves delve too deep

58:15.640 --> 58:17.640
and too greedily? Well, you see,

58:17.640 --> 58:19.640
an old man threw a leaf down a hole

58:19.640 --> 58:21.640
and the bad rug was like, LEAF.

58:23.640 --> 58:25.640
Oh, I'm gonna kill dwarves

58:25.640 --> 58:27.640
now.

58:27.640 --> 58:29.640
How was Mount Doom created? Well, an old dude

58:29.640 --> 58:31.640
put a sword in a rock and it

58:31.640 --> 58:33.640
made water and shit. Like,

58:33.640 --> 58:35.640
the thing is, if you're gonna do a prequel- So why did he go

58:35.640 --> 58:37.640
all the way to the hole

58:37.640 --> 58:39.640
just to throw the leaf

58:39.640 --> 58:41.640
down?

58:41.640 --> 58:43.640
Yeah, I don't know. I've talked about this when it comes to

58:43.640 --> 58:45.640
40k. Was there no garbage can?

58:45.640 --> 58:47.640
40k did his own

58:47.640 --> 58:49.640
whole prequel thing with the Horus Heresy.

58:49.640 --> 58:51.640
The way you do a prequel

58:51.640 --> 58:53.640
well is when you add

58:53.640 --> 58:55.640
to the story, when you build

58:55.640 --> 58:57.640
to it, when you add value

58:57.640 --> 58:59.640
to the story. Like,

58:59.640 --> 59:01.640
when a character- like with

59:01.640 --> 59:03.640
Darth Vader is actually a pretty good example.

59:03.640 --> 59:05.640
They added value to him by

59:05.640 --> 59:07.640
showing his fall. They added

59:07.640 --> 59:09.640
depth to him. But here, all they're

59:09.640 --> 59:11.640
doing is subtracting.

59:11.640 --> 59:13.640
Thus, knowing that Mount Doom was created by an

59:13.640 --> 59:15.640
old fart who stuck a stick in a rock

59:15.640 --> 59:17.640
doesn't add to Mount Doom.

59:17.640 --> 59:19.640
It subtracts from it. It's no longer

59:19.640 --> 59:21.640
a mountain volcano

59:21.640 --> 59:23.640
created by Satan.

59:23.640 --> 59:25.640
It's a rando thing built by some rando

59:25.640 --> 59:27.640
to create ash so he could live with his orcs

59:27.640 --> 59:29.640
friends there.

59:29.640 --> 59:31.640
His orc friends. Aww, that's kind of endearing

59:31.640 --> 59:33.640
me, by the way. They're also

59:33.640 --> 59:35.640
subtracting from Amazon's bank account

59:35.640 --> 59:37.640
by trying to make this show.

59:37.640 --> 59:39.640
And it's not working out.

59:39.640 --> 59:41.640
The fall of duty.

59:41.640 --> 59:43.640
Think of what an amazing

59:43.640 --> 59:45.640
story it could be.

59:45.640 --> 59:47.640
It's not a question of helping the elves.

59:47.640 --> 59:49.640
It's simply the dwarves digging deep

59:49.640 --> 59:51.640
and greedily for their own greed's

59:51.640 --> 59:53.640
sake. No, that's not it at all.

59:53.640 --> 59:55.640
It's a fucking leaf.

59:55.640 --> 59:57.640
It's an old person.

59:57.640 --> 59:59.640
That's an interesting insight into greed

59:59.640 --> 01:00:01.640
and the nature of

01:00:01.640 --> 01:00:03.640
pushing yourself too hard for

01:00:03.640 --> 01:00:05.640
just want.

01:00:05.640 --> 01:00:07.640
The issue is

01:00:07.640 --> 01:00:09.640
that entire story is supposed

01:00:09.640 --> 01:00:11.640
to be a story of greed, right?

01:00:11.640 --> 01:00:13.640
How they continuously justify

01:00:13.640 --> 01:00:15.640
it. Like, they know this is dangerous

01:00:15.640 --> 01:00:17.640
but we just want a little bit more gold.

01:00:17.640 --> 01:00:19.640
Instead, they've subtracted

01:00:19.640 --> 01:00:21.640
that and now if they don't dig,

01:00:21.640 --> 01:00:23.640
all of the elves just fucking die.

01:00:23.640 --> 01:00:25.640
Like, it's no longer greed. It's altruism.

01:00:25.640 --> 01:00:27.640
I do like how, as usual,

01:00:27.640 --> 01:00:29.640
it's a fucking leaf that

01:00:29.640 --> 01:00:31.640
ruins everything.

01:00:31.640 --> 01:00:33.640
Yep. We have the rags soon, Dev.

01:00:33.640 --> 01:00:35.640
In real life.

01:00:35.640 --> 01:00:37.640
Oh god.

01:00:37.640 --> 01:00:39.640
I mean, there's the usual stuff of

01:00:39.640 --> 01:00:41.640
every important character survives

01:00:41.640 --> 01:00:43.640
a cataclysm, but

01:00:43.640 --> 01:00:45.640
I mean, that's just normal movie logic.

01:00:45.640 --> 01:00:47.640
I mean,

01:00:47.640 --> 01:00:49.640
again, it's like not having the will

01:00:49.640 --> 01:00:51.640
to actually have

01:00:51.640 --> 01:00:53.640
your story beats make

01:00:53.640 --> 01:00:55.640
sense or like, play out. Like, you're not

01:00:55.640 --> 01:00:57.640
really committing to them. No one really dies.

01:00:57.640 --> 01:00:59.640
No one important happens.

01:00:59.640 --> 01:01:01.640
Like, okay.

01:01:01.640 --> 01:01:03.640
Do the fucking stupid

01:01:03.640 --> 01:01:05.640
running away from lava thing

01:01:05.640 --> 01:01:07.640
where it's like, oh, the mountain's acting

01:01:07.640 --> 01:01:09.640
weird. We must evacuate and then

01:01:09.640 --> 01:01:11.640
have the mountain explode. The mountain explodes,

01:01:11.640 --> 01:01:13.640
covers everything in the ash, burns everything

01:01:13.640 --> 01:01:15.640
with a temperature high enough to

01:01:15.640 --> 01:01:17.640
have wood spontaneously combust

01:01:17.640 --> 01:01:19.640
yet there are still survivors.

01:01:19.640 --> 01:01:21.640
You know what they could have done?

01:01:21.640 --> 01:01:23.640
They could have actually done the exact

01:01:23.640 --> 01:01:25.640
same story. They just

01:01:25.640 --> 01:01:27.640
they could have, man,

01:01:27.640 --> 01:01:29.640
I was just thinking of this.

01:01:29.640 --> 01:01:31.640
They didn't need to make it so that you take the

01:01:31.640 --> 01:01:33.640
sword and then put it in the keyhole and then

01:01:33.640 --> 01:01:35.640
open the dam, which then floods all the

01:01:35.640 --> 01:01:37.640
water down into the volcano and causes the volcano.

01:01:37.640 --> 01:01:39.640
They could have just made it so that it was a

01:01:39.640 --> 01:01:41.640
magic sword and a magic

01:01:41.640 --> 01:01:43.640
keyhole that creates a magic volcano.

01:01:43.640 --> 01:01:45.640
Yeah.

01:01:45.640 --> 01:01:47.640
Magic. And it would have

01:01:47.640 --> 01:01:49.640
worked a lot better. Like, yes, you

01:01:49.640 --> 01:01:51.640
put the sword in, the ground starts rumbling,

01:01:51.640 --> 01:01:53.640
you know, the sigil of Sauron appears

01:01:53.640 --> 01:01:55.640
in the mountain and like the top blows off of it or something

01:01:55.640 --> 01:01:57.640
like, you could, you could just make this

01:01:57.640 --> 01:01:59.640
shit up. They're already making it up anyway.

01:01:59.640 --> 01:02:01.640
They might as well make it up good.

01:02:01.640 --> 01:02:03.640
No.

01:02:05.640 --> 01:02:07.640
That's what they decided.

01:02:07.640 --> 01:02:09.640
We are against the concept of quality

01:02:09.640 --> 01:02:11.640
here at Amazon Studios.

01:02:11.640 --> 01:02:13.640
We'll use an algorithm.

01:02:13.640 --> 01:02:15.640
In any other show, I'd

01:02:15.640 --> 01:02:17.640
call it a cop-out, but in a show like

01:02:17.640 --> 01:02:19.640
this, where you are

01:02:19.640 --> 01:02:21.640
in the time of legends and myth,

01:02:21.640 --> 01:02:23.640
literally just make an artifact

01:02:23.640 --> 01:02:25.640
of Morgoth and it's like when

01:02:25.640 --> 01:02:27.640
this artifact is like placed upon the

01:02:27.640 --> 01:02:29.640
thingamabob, like darkness will descend

01:02:29.640 --> 01:02:31.640
upon the land and what does it mean?

01:02:31.640 --> 01:02:33.640
And then you blow up Mount Doom.

01:02:33.640 --> 01:02:35.640
Yeah, exactly.

01:02:35.640 --> 01:02:37.640
Just pour water.

01:02:37.640 --> 01:02:39.640
You could have like a legend

01:02:39.640 --> 01:02:41.640
attached to it and the legend, yeah,

01:02:41.640 --> 01:02:43.640
it says like, darkness will come to the land and no one knows what

01:02:43.640 --> 01:02:45.640
it means and they're like, we have to make sure that

01:02:45.640 --> 01:02:47.640
the enemy doesn't get it to the altar

01:02:47.640 --> 01:02:49.640
and they have like a back and forth

01:02:49.640 --> 01:02:51.640
over it and like it gets lost and then found

01:02:51.640 --> 01:02:53.640
again and there's like a mad scramble for it.

01:02:53.640 --> 01:02:55.640
And then the heroes fail right in

01:02:55.640 --> 01:02:57.640
the last moment and then, you know, the

01:02:57.640 --> 01:02:59.640
old man plunges it into the

01:02:59.640 --> 01:03:01.640
into the altar and then the volcano

01:03:01.640 --> 01:03:03.640
explodes. Like it could be a whole thing!

01:03:03.640 --> 01:03:05.640
And I'll dev...

01:03:05.640 --> 01:03:07.640
...water.

01:03:07.640 --> 01:03:09.640
Don't do it.

01:03:11.640 --> 01:03:13.640
It's just...

01:03:13.640 --> 01:03:15.640
It is anti-Tolkean almost

01:03:15.640 --> 01:03:17.640
every step of the way.

01:03:17.640 --> 01:03:19.640
I hate the horse. I hate the horse

01:03:19.640 --> 01:03:21.640
too. The horse walks

01:03:21.640 --> 01:03:23.640
all the way back to camp.

01:03:23.640 --> 01:03:25.640
But suddenly it's convenient.

01:03:25.640 --> 01:03:27.640
It's like, the horse won't

01:03:27.640 --> 01:03:29.640
listen to any of us. He walked all the way back

01:03:29.640 --> 01:03:31.640
here though. Like, no, it won't listen.

01:03:31.640 --> 01:03:33.640
Okay. And he takes off the bridle and the horse

01:03:33.640 --> 01:03:35.640
goes, yes to!

01:03:35.640 --> 01:03:37.640
And runs away.

01:03:37.640 --> 01:03:39.640
It's gonna be the air form scene. Like, that's how it's gonna do it.

01:03:39.640 --> 01:03:41.640
Like, he's gonna lick him awake, you know, and he's like, ugh.

01:03:41.640 --> 01:03:43.640
Yeah, no, no, he's

01:03:43.640 --> 01:03:45.640
gonna be lying there covered in ash

01:03:45.640 --> 01:03:47.640
and you're gonna see the horse now just

01:03:47.640 --> 01:03:49.640
hoof, hoof, hoof.

01:03:49.640 --> 01:03:51.640
And then you're like, oh, horse, you came for me! Horse!

01:03:51.640 --> 01:03:53.640
Two days later.

01:03:53.640 --> 01:03:55.640
Me and his horse

01:03:55.640 --> 01:03:57.640
and me and his best friend?

01:03:57.640 --> 01:03:59.640
That's what the show's saying.

01:03:59.640 --> 01:04:01.640
I hate it. And the

01:04:01.640 --> 01:04:03.640
thing is too,

01:04:03.640 --> 01:04:05.640
the reason why I hate it so much

01:04:05.640 --> 01:04:07.640
is because this is just

01:04:07.640 --> 01:04:09.640
a movie plotline.

01:04:09.640 --> 01:04:11.640
That is all it is. The only reason,

01:04:11.640 --> 01:04:13.640
like, we haven't seen him build any

01:04:13.640 --> 01:04:15.640
relationship with this fucking horse.

01:04:15.640 --> 01:04:17.640
Like, it's not like we saw him

01:04:17.640 --> 01:04:19.640
carrying out his stable master duties

01:04:19.640 --> 01:04:21.640
or pet the horse or like,

01:04:21.640 --> 01:04:23.640
oh, you're a good horse, you're feeding cats

01:04:23.640 --> 01:04:25.640
or anything, no. We saw one scene of that.

01:04:25.640 --> 01:04:27.640
We saw one scene of that. Only one.

01:04:27.640 --> 01:04:29.640
Yeah. No, not even that.

01:04:29.640 --> 01:04:31.640
Like, that was his daddy coming over like,

01:04:31.640 --> 01:04:33.640
you know, a horse would make a bond with you if you're nice

01:04:33.640 --> 01:04:35.640
with a horse. Like, but he never did

01:04:35.640 --> 01:04:37.640
that. Like, he was whining over

01:04:37.640 --> 01:04:39.640
how a horse was like, horse, why are you bitching

01:04:39.640 --> 01:04:41.640
about the scratch? Again, it is

01:04:41.640 --> 01:04:43.640
just a movie plot.

01:04:43.640 --> 01:04:45.640
Alright, sure. Would you say that you're racist

01:04:45.640 --> 01:04:47.640
against horses too? Yes.

01:04:47.640 --> 01:04:49.640
Species too.

01:04:49.640 --> 01:04:51.640
Barch's

01:04:51.640 --> 01:04:53.640
biases are only growing from the show.

01:04:53.640 --> 01:04:55.640
His hatred is...

01:04:55.640 --> 01:04:57.640
Wait, Kibbs,

01:04:57.640 --> 01:04:59.640
you're a horse right now, dude.

01:04:59.640 --> 01:05:01.640
Yes, that's true.

01:05:01.640 --> 01:05:03.640
But also,

01:05:03.640 --> 01:05:05.640
I'm watching the Harfoot scene now

01:05:05.640 --> 01:05:07.640
where their entire little retarded village is

01:05:07.640 --> 01:05:09.640
burnt to the ground and there's

01:05:09.640 --> 01:05:11.640
shitloads of stuff that isn't burnt.

01:05:11.640 --> 01:05:13.640
Like, there's like pieces of wooden

01:05:13.640 --> 01:05:15.640
like, bowls just fine.

01:05:15.640 --> 01:05:17.640
There's pieces of their fucking retarded camo netting

01:05:17.640 --> 01:05:19.640
just lying over the flames.

01:05:19.640 --> 01:05:21.640
That's just fine.

01:05:21.640 --> 01:05:23.640
It's like they just created

01:05:23.640 --> 01:05:25.640
a set of burnt out carts.

01:05:27.640 --> 01:05:29.640
Yeah, this show seems to consistently

01:05:29.640 --> 01:05:31.640
just be weird about fire.

01:05:31.640 --> 01:05:33.640
Cause there was that, the broken tree branch

01:05:33.640 --> 01:05:35.640
that was just painted to be burned, but not actually

01:05:35.640 --> 01:05:37.640
burned. Like,

01:05:37.640 --> 01:05:39.640
I think they just don't know what like,

01:05:39.640 --> 01:05:41.640
what fire is. They just don't get it.

01:05:41.640 --> 01:05:43.640
It's not that.

01:05:43.640 --> 01:05:45.640
It's an active resistance to attention to detail.

01:05:45.640 --> 01:05:47.640
That's the thing. Like, cause

01:05:47.640 --> 01:05:49.640
they don't actually give a fuck.

01:05:49.640 --> 01:05:51.640
Again, the queen,

01:05:51.640 --> 01:05:53.640
it's writing by

01:05:53.640 --> 01:05:55.640
scene, by numbers, right?

01:05:55.640 --> 01:05:57.640
Queen is sitting on her horse, and you're like

01:05:57.640 --> 01:05:59.640
oh my god, she's blind. And she's like

01:05:59.640 --> 01:06:01.640
I don't want to show my weakness to the soldiers.

01:06:01.640 --> 01:06:03.640
Okay. Makes a lot of

01:06:03.640 --> 01:06:05.640
sense. And then next scene, she's

01:06:05.640 --> 01:06:07.640
sitting there with a fucking blindfold.

01:06:07.640 --> 01:06:09.640
Yeah, no explanation whatsoever.

01:06:09.640 --> 01:06:11.640
I mean, now it's okay to break

01:06:11.640 --> 01:06:13.640
the moral, I guess.

01:06:13.640 --> 01:06:15.640
Either it was always

01:06:15.640 --> 01:06:17.640
okay, or like

01:06:17.640 --> 01:06:19.640
what happened in between.

01:06:19.640 --> 01:06:21.640
Yeah.

01:06:21.640 --> 01:06:23.640
Yeah, um

01:06:23.640 --> 01:06:25.640
I don't, I don't think I agree with you there.

01:06:25.640 --> 01:06:27.640
I actually think that it's ignorance. I think that it's

01:06:27.640 --> 01:06:29.640
ignorance, because like, I'm sure

01:06:29.640 --> 01:06:31.640
we've all heard that story of the university

01:06:31.640 --> 01:06:33.640
professor who is very

01:06:33.640 --> 01:06:35.640
intelligent, like a math professor or physics

01:06:35.640 --> 01:06:37.640
professor or something. He's very intelligent, but he doesn't

01:06:37.640 --> 01:06:39.640
know what a supply chain is. So he asks

01:06:39.640 --> 01:06:41.640
the question, why do people hunt for

01:06:41.640 --> 01:06:43.640
food? Why not just get your food from the grocery store?

01:06:43.640 --> 01:06:45.640
We don't need to kill animals anymore, just go to the grocery store.

01:06:45.640 --> 01:06:47.640
It's like, well, he doesn't know

01:06:47.640 --> 01:06:49.640
what, like how the food gets to the grocery

01:06:49.640 --> 01:06:51.640
store, right? Like, there's that story that I think

01:06:51.640 --> 01:06:53.640
we've all heard at least once.

01:06:53.640 --> 01:06:55.640
I genuinely think the people who

01:06:55.640 --> 01:06:57.640
wrote this show don't know

01:06:57.640 --> 01:06:59.640
how fire or heat works.

01:06:59.640 --> 01:07:01.640
They're like, oh yeah, things kind of get pretty

01:07:01.640 --> 01:07:03.640
hot, you know, I turn on the heating in my house and like

01:07:03.640 --> 01:07:05.640
heats up a bit, maybe it's a little bit too hot, but

01:07:05.640 --> 01:07:07.640
it's not a big deal.

01:07:07.640 --> 01:07:09.640
I genuinely think they don't

01:07:09.640 --> 01:07:11.640
get it. They've never been around like a campfire

01:07:11.640 --> 01:07:13.640
before or a real fire.

01:07:13.640 --> 01:07:15.640
The thing is like, I'm sure they're idiots

01:07:15.640 --> 01:07:17.640
as well, Dev. I'm not

01:07:17.640 --> 01:07:19.640
I'm not saying they're not retards

01:07:19.640 --> 01:07:21.640
also, but no, it

01:07:21.640 --> 01:07:23.640
is the consistent lack

01:07:23.640 --> 01:07:25.640
of attention to detail. It's like with their

01:07:25.640 --> 01:07:27.640
armor. Galadriel doesn't have her

01:07:27.640 --> 01:07:29.640
armor until Galadriel

01:07:29.640 --> 01:07:31.640
suddenly has her fucking armor.

01:07:31.640 --> 01:07:33.640
And the Halibrand too.

01:07:33.640 --> 01:07:35.640
In one scene, there's like a

01:07:35.640 --> 01:07:37.640
man in him, basically dead on the side of the road

01:07:37.640 --> 01:07:39.640
like only elephant medicine can cure him.

01:07:39.640 --> 01:07:41.640
Can you ride? Yep.

01:07:41.640 --> 01:07:43.640
And he's just

01:07:43.640 --> 01:07:45.640
walking perfectly healthy.

01:07:45.640 --> 01:07:47.640
It's like, where are we riding to?

01:07:47.640 --> 01:07:49.640
To get the elephant medicine that'll cure you.

01:07:49.640 --> 01:07:51.640
But I'm riding.

01:07:51.640 --> 01:07:53.640
Like his medicine is falling out.

01:07:55.640 --> 01:07:57.640
Why don't you pick up the

01:07:57.640 --> 01:07:59.640
medicine yourself and come back

01:07:59.640 --> 01:08:01.640
for him and he can rest

01:08:01.640 --> 01:08:03.640
and hopefully not die.

01:08:03.640 --> 01:08:05.640
Put him in a fucking cart

01:08:05.640 --> 01:08:07.640
or something.

01:08:09.640 --> 01:08:11.640
I mean, I don't

01:08:11.640 --> 01:08:13.640
know if anybody here has

01:08:13.640 --> 01:08:15.640
ridden a horse, but

01:08:15.640 --> 01:08:17.640
they're not the most stable.

01:08:17.640 --> 01:08:19.640
Yeah, they're quite bumpy.

01:08:19.640 --> 01:08:21.640
Again, it is

01:08:21.640 --> 01:08:23.640
the consistent lack of attention

01:08:23.640 --> 01:08:25.640
to detail because they

01:08:25.640 --> 01:08:27.640
think of a scene

01:08:27.640 --> 01:08:29.640
of, wouldn't it be cool if Halibrand

01:08:29.640 --> 01:08:31.640
was like wounded and they had to get like

01:08:31.640 --> 01:08:33.640
elephant medicine. Yeah, that's like from those

01:08:33.640 --> 01:08:35.640
movies things. Yeah, let's do that.

01:08:35.640 --> 01:08:37.640
But then they also rode a scene

01:08:37.640 --> 01:08:39.640
later on that needs to have Halibrand

01:08:39.640 --> 01:08:41.640
with Galadriel and so they're like, fuck.

01:08:41.640 --> 01:08:43.640
Why don't you have him ride? It's fine.

01:08:45.640 --> 01:08:47.640
Lilith, Lilith, you have to understand

01:08:47.640 --> 01:08:49.640
everyone in this call rides Kibs at least

01:08:49.640 --> 01:08:51.640
once a day.

01:08:51.640 --> 01:08:53.640
So, also, also, also.

01:08:53.640 --> 01:08:55.640
Galadriel arrives at camp,

01:08:55.640 --> 01:08:57.640
right? And then five minutes

01:08:57.640 --> 01:08:59.640
later, her plate armor is perfectly

01:08:59.640 --> 01:09:01.640
spotlessly clean, including her

01:09:01.640 --> 01:09:03.640
chainmail.

01:09:03.640 --> 01:09:05.640
I guarantee you, Arch, there's a bunch of simps in

01:09:05.640 --> 01:09:07.640
that camp we'll just lick it off for.

01:09:07.640 --> 01:09:09.640
Probably.

01:09:09.640 --> 01:09:11.640
Okay, so

01:09:11.640 --> 01:09:13.640
I think we all have heard

01:09:13.640 --> 01:09:15.640
Arch's rant at this point.

01:09:15.640 --> 01:09:17.640
Does anybody else want to throw in their two cents?

01:09:19.640 --> 01:09:21.640
I forgot what we were talking about. I sort of zoned out.

01:09:21.640 --> 01:09:23.640
We're talking about whores.

01:09:23.640 --> 01:09:25.640
You mean there's not

01:09:25.640 --> 01:09:27.640
I feel like there's not much to say.

01:09:27.640 --> 01:09:29.640
The show just

01:09:29.640 --> 01:09:31.640
kind of speaks to her itself.

01:09:31.640 --> 01:09:33.640
Let's hope the

01:09:33.640 --> 01:09:35.640
next episode will be better because

01:09:35.640 --> 01:09:37.640
there's just lots of

01:09:37.640 --> 01:09:39.640
I think we pretty much complain about everything

01:09:39.640 --> 01:09:41.640
you're used to complain. There is no fucking way

01:09:41.640 --> 01:09:43.640
the show gets any better.

01:09:43.640 --> 01:09:45.640
Like, maybe, maybe by season two

01:09:45.640 --> 01:09:47.640
but this season's going to be a

01:09:47.640 --> 01:09:49.640
trash fire all the way down.

01:09:49.640 --> 01:09:51.640
The thing is, this

01:09:51.640 --> 01:09:53.640
this was the payoff.

01:09:53.640 --> 01:09:55.640
This was supposed to be the big moment

01:09:55.640 --> 01:09:57.640
and the storylines actually got started

01:09:57.640 --> 01:09:59.640
after seven hours.

01:09:59.640 --> 01:10:01.640
Well

01:10:01.640 --> 01:10:03.640
I know that it was meant to be

01:10:03.640 --> 01:10:05.640
the money shot and I do feel like

01:10:05.640 --> 01:10:07.640
I got fucked.

01:10:07.640 --> 01:10:09.640
I do like that the camp is like

01:10:09.640 --> 01:10:11.640
conveniently

01:10:11.640 --> 01:10:13.640
outside of the range of

01:10:13.640 --> 01:10:15.640
Mount Doom.

01:10:15.640 --> 01:10:17.640
Yeah.

01:10:17.640 --> 01:10:19.640
Well, good thing they have the foresight.

01:10:19.640 --> 01:10:21.640
Actually, you know what?

01:10:21.640 --> 01:10:23.640
So they mentioned in the last episode

01:10:23.640 --> 01:10:25.640
how they got that far inland.

01:10:25.640 --> 01:10:27.640
Apparently the ships they have

01:10:27.640 --> 01:10:29.640
can also sail up rivers.

01:10:29.640 --> 01:10:31.640
So they just sailed all the way

01:10:31.640 --> 01:10:33.640
up to the Southlands.

01:10:33.640 --> 01:10:35.640
That's not out of the ordinary

01:10:35.640 --> 01:10:37.640
in fact, that's pretty common for ships like that.

01:10:37.640 --> 01:10:39.640
Is it?

01:10:39.640 --> 01:10:41.640
But ships that can hold 500 guys?

01:10:41.640 --> 01:10:43.640
Yeah, no, no, no, no, no.

01:10:43.640 --> 01:10:45.640
As the resident fucking Norwegian here

01:10:45.640 --> 01:10:47.640
for people who invented river faring ships

01:10:47.640 --> 01:10:49.640
Yeah, you guys did that.

01:10:49.640 --> 01:10:51.640
This is for shallow draft

01:10:51.640 --> 01:10:53.640
ships. Like, these are not shallow

01:10:53.640 --> 01:10:55.640
draft ships. These are fucking galleons.

01:10:55.640 --> 01:10:57.640
Yeah, and the rivers are deep.

01:10:57.640 --> 01:10:59.640
You put your foot in, Cib.

01:11:01.640 --> 01:11:03.640
Oh, God.

01:11:03.640 --> 01:11:05.640
Amazon, hire me. I can explain

01:11:05.640 --> 01:11:07.640
away everything.

01:11:07.640 --> 01:11:09.640
Wait, Cibs, it turns

01:11:09.640 --> 01:11:11.640
out that you're just the Amazon plant in the group

01:11:11.640 --> 01:11:13.640
the whole time. I've been sabotaging it.

01:11:13.640 --> 01:11:15.640
It's actually pretty good, guys.

01:11:15.640 --> 01:11:17.640
There's no rivers

01:11:17.640 --> 01:11:19.640
leading up to Mount Doom.

01:11:19.640 --> 01:11:21.640
Like, none.

01:11:21.640 --> 01:11:23.640
Like, they still have to cross the fucking

01:11:23.640 --> 01:11:25.640
mountain range.

01:11:25.640 --> 01:11:27.640
Listen, I don't want to hear any more of your

01:11:27.640 --> 01:11:29.640
details, Arch, okay?

01:11:29.640 --> 01:11:31.640
The closest they could get

01:11:31.640 --> 01:11:33.640
is, like, one of the rivers that leads

01:11:33.640 --> 01:11:35.640
to the southern edge of the

01:11:35.640 --> 01:11:37.640
wall of mountains. And then they'd

01:11:37.640 --> 01:11:39.640
have to cross literally the

01:11:39.640 --> 01:11:41.640
entirety of Mordor

01:11:41.640 --> 01:11:43.640
to reach Mount Doom.

01:11:43.640 --> 01:11:45.640
Yep. It was kind of why Frodo, it was such a big deal for

01:11:45.640 --> 01:11:47.640
Frodo and Sam to get in there because

01:11:47.640 --> 01:11:49.640
there's really no other way to get past the mountains.

01:11:49.640 --> 01:11:51.640
Yeah, I'd also like to point out

01:11:51.640 --> 01:11:53.640
these mountains,

01:11:53.640 --> 01:11:55.640
they're not like hills.

01:11:55.640 --> 01:11:57.640
It's an enormous fucking barrier.

01:11:57.640 --> 01:11:59.640
Particularly for

01:11:59.640 --> 01:12:01.640
people on horses.

01:12:01.640 --> 01:12:03.640
And for a plus two.

01:12:03.640 --> 01:12:05.640
This is 300 men.

01:12:05.640 --> 01:12:07.640
Like, the amount of food,

01:12:07.640 --> 01:12:09.640
supplies, parts,

01:12:09.640 --> 01:12:11.640
they've set up a fucking tent town.

01:12:11.640 --> 01:12:13.640
Well, you see, Arch,

01:12:13.640 --> 01:12:15.640
Hannibal Barca did it, and he did it with

01:12:15.640 --> 01:12:17.640
elephants and the Alps, okay?

01:12:21.640 --> 01:12:23.640
I broke Arch.

01:12:23.640 --> 01:12:25.640
No, they operated on a Russian line of thinking

01:12:25.640 --> 01:12:27.640
supply lines?

01:12:27.640 --> 01:12:29.640
What supply lines?

01:12:29.640 --> 01:12:31.640
What supplies?

01:12:31.640 --> 01:12:33.640
Scavenger we go.

01:12:33.640 --> 01:12:35.640
This is a nitpick that's

01:12:35.640 --> 01:12:37.640
almost pointless, but since we're going

01:12:37.640 --> 01:12:39.640
at it, there's no way those fucking

01:12:39.640 --> 01:12:41.640
We're going at it.

01:12:41.640 --> 01:12:43.640
carried 300 fucking horses.

01:12:43.640 --> 01:12:45.640
Well, there's no way to

01:12:45.640 --> 01:12:47.640
carry 300 men either.

01:12:47.640 --> 01:12:49.640
There's a lot of meme art showing the ship,

01:12:49.640 --> 01:12:51.640
and then it shows the side interior,

01:12:51.640 --> 01:12:53.640
and underneath it goes like

01:12:53.640 --> 01:12:55.640
40 feet deep, and there's like 30 decks.

01:12:55.640 --> 01:12:57.640
It's like a giant

01:12:57.640 --> 01:12:59.640
barge underwater.

01:12:59.640 --> 01:13:01.640
Oh, okay, that's where the other 300 men is.

01:13:01.640 --> 01:13:03.640
They show

01:13:03.640 --> 01:13:05.640
a shot of the ship's deck,

01:13:05.640 --> 01:13:07.640
and there's like 10-12 people, and it looks

01:13:07.640 --> 01:13:09.640
crowded.

01:13:09.640 --> 01:13:11.640
Those ships

01:13:11.640 --> 01:13:13.640
can't carry 300 men, I'm sorry,

01:13:13.640 --> 01:13:15.640
but that's just not possible.

01:13:15.640 --> 01:13:17.640
Not including horses, no.

01:13:17.640 --> 01:13:19.640
Again, it is the consistent

01:13:19.640 --> 01:13:21.640
fucking lack of attention to deal.

01:13:21.640 --> 01:13:23.640
This is Numenor.

01:13:23.640 --> 01:13:25.640
There's just CGI ships. There's no reason

01:13:25.640 --> 01:13:27.640
why they couldn't have shown like

01:13:27.640 --> 01:13:29.640
100 fucking ships setting sail from

01:13:29.640 --> 01:13:31.640
Numenor. That would look cool.

01:13:31.640 --> 01:13:33.640
The Numenoreans are going to war,

01:13:33.640 --> 01:13:35.640
and there's this massive armada just

01:13:35.640 --> 01:13:37.640
cresting the sea. Yeah, instead,

01:13:37.640 --> 01:13:39.640
it's five boats, and then two of them

01:13:39.640 --> 01:13:41.640
have three boats left.

01:13:41.640 --> 01:13:43.640
You would think that

01:13:43.640 --> 01:13:45.640
a show like this would have more

01:13:45.640 --> 01:13:47.640
budget behind it.

01:13:47.640 --> 01:13:49.640
Okay.

01:13:49.640 --> 01:13:51.640
Let's just give

01:13:51.640 --> 01:13:53.640
a few more CGI ships.

01:13:53.640 --> 01:13:55.640
I think I know.

01:13:55.640 --> 01:13:57.640
I think I know why not.

01:13:57.640 --> 01:13:59.640
I think I know why not. So earlier,

01:13:59.640 --> 01:14:01.640
I mentioned that it's like a lack of real-world

01:14:01.640 --> 01:14:03.640
experience as to why they don't know how fire works.

01:14:03.640 --> 01:14:05.640
Okay. Assume

01:14:05.640 --> 01:14:07.640
that these writers are very sheltered

01:14:07.640 --> 01:14:09.640
living in LA their whole lives

01:14:09.640 --> 01:14:11.640
or something. They don't know how anything works.

01:14:11.640 --> 01:14:13.640
And then, also, assume

01:14:13.640 --> 01:14:15.640
that they're, let's say, extremely

01:14:15.640 --> 01:14:17.640
extremely left-leaning.

01:14:17.640 --> 01:14:19.640
Okay, let's just make these two assumptions.

01:14:19.640 --> 01:14:21.640
Okay.

01:14:21.640 --> 01:14:23.640
The only ships they would have heard about

01:14:23.640 --> 01:14:25.640
would have been African slave ships

01:14:25.640 --> 01:14:27.640
and how they crowded

01:14:27.640 --> 01:14:29.640
them full with hundreds of people.

01:14:29.640 --> 01:14:31.640
I like where we're

01:14:31.640 --> 01:14:33.640
going. Of course you would,

01:14:33.640 --> 01:14:35.640
aren't you? Fuck. But like,

01:14:35.640 --> 01:14:37.640
that's why they're like, we can

01:14:37.640 --> 01:14:39.640
clearly put 500

01:14:39.640 --> 01:14:41.640
guys in a ship. That's how it worked, right?

01:14:41.640 --> 01:14:43.640
Obviously. I remember hearing about that.

01:14:43.640 --> 01:14:45.640
That was their line of logic.

01:14:45.640 --> 01:14:47.640
This is so annoying, though, because

01:14:47.640 --> 01:14:49.640
when you're a writer and you're writing

01:14:49.640 --> 01:14:51.640
fantasy or writing science fiction,

01:14:51.640 --> 01:14:53.640
most of your work is actually just reading

01:14:53.640 --> 01:14:55.640
or Google searching, literally.

01:14:55.640 --> 01:14:57.640
Okay, how does this work?

01:14:57.640 --> 01:14:59.640
Or you call up somebody, a friend who

01:14:59.640 --> 01:15:01.640
is actually an architect. How do these buildings work?

01:15:01.640 --> 01:15:03.640
It's a lot of research.

01:15:03.640 --> 01:15:05.640
More time spent researching than you'll ever

01:15:05.640 --> 01:15:07.640
spend writing. They didn't do any of the right research.

01:15:07.640 --> 01:15:09.640
They ought to be like the pawn stars. Hold on, let me

01:15:09.640 --> 01:15:11.640
call up my expert.

01:15:11.640 --> 01:15:13.640
Yeah, it says you're going to need

01:15:13.640 --> 01:15:15.640
a lot more boats.

01:15:15.640 --> 01:15:17.640
No, no, no. This

01:15:17.640 --> 01:15:19.640
explains a lot. The reason why Numenor

01:15:19.640 --> 01:15:21.640
is so diverse is because the white

01:15:21.640 --> 01:15:23.640
people use the black people as

01:15:23.640 --> 01:15:25.640
slave warriors, and they pack them into their

01:15:25.640 --> 01:15:27.640
boats really tight. Look at this. See, Arch

01:15:27.640 --> 01:15:29.640
can't hold back. He just has to.

01:15:29.640 --> 01:15:31.640
I know this was Dev's idea. I'm just

01:15:31.640 --> 01:15:33.640
expanding upon it. It's like a pop-up army.

01:15:33.640 --> 01:15:35.640
It's kind of like the droids

01:15:35.640 --> 01:15:37.640
from Star Wars, like the side of the ships

01:15:37.640 --> 01:15:39.640
Arch and stuff.

01:15:39.640 --> 01:15:41.640
Black people extend out

01:15:41.640 --> 01:15:43.640
like the fucking droid army starts

01:15:43.640 --> 01:15:45.640
playing like, bear, bear, bear.

01:15:45.640 --> 01:15:47.640
Fucking no way.

01:15:47.640 --> 01:15:49.640
Where do they keep the horses, Dev?

01:15:49.640 --> 01:15:51.640
Yeah, we've answered

01:15:51.640 --> 01:15:53.640
that question.

01:15:53.640 --> 01:15:55.640
We know how they've stacked up the humans, but

01:15:55.640 --> 01:15:57.640
where are the fucking horses?

01:15:57.640 --> 01:15:59.640
Where's the horses' food?

01:15:59.640 --> 01:16:01.640
Did they stack them up too?

01:16:01.640 --> 01:16:03.640
Did they stack them like, black person, horse,

01:16:03.640 --> 01:16:05.640
black person, horse?

01:16:05.640 --> 01:16:07.640
Damn, Arch.

01:16:07.640 --> 01:16:09.640
Just smashed in there?

01:16:09.640 --> 01:16:11.640
What would the horse think?

01:16:11.640 --> 01:16:13.640
What would the horse think?

01:16:13.640 --> 01:16:15.640
I'm going to have to start distancing

01:16:15.640 --> 01:16:17.640
myself, but I think it's too late.

01:16:17.640 --> 01:16:19.640
Dev, remember me?

01:16:19.640 --> 01:16:21.640
Next

01:16:21.640 --> 01:16:23.640
episode, Arch is completely

01:16:23.640 --> 01:16:25.640
replaced.

01:16:25.640 --> 01:16:27.640
We just pretend we never knew it.

01:16:27.640 --> 01:16:29.640
Guys, Arch is sick with

01:16:29.640 --> 01:16:31.640
Covid again.

01:16:31.640 --> 01:16:33.640
And Arch comes

01:16:33.640 --> 01:16:35.640
in on horses

01:16:35.640 --> 01:16:37.640
wearing clan hoods, like

01:16:37.640 --> 01:16:39.640
in Birth of the Nation.

01:16:39.640 --> 01:16:41.640
What if the horses

01:16:41.640 --> 01:16:43.640
were black too? Could they store them

01:16:43.640 --> 01:16:45.640
as easily? Arch, you

01:16:45.640 --> 01:16:47.640
have Fehrman syndrome.

01:16:47.640 --> 01:16:49.640
Oh, does Fehrman? I guess Fehrman's

01:16:49.640 --> 01:16:51.640
German, right? He always is racist.

01:16:51.640 --> 01:16:53.640
Let me Google, do

01:16:53.640 --> 01:16:55.640
black horses fold?

01:16:55.640 --> 01:16:57.640
Wait, hold on.

01:16:57.640 --> 01:16:59.640
We'll get

01:16:59.640 --> 01:17:01.640
Fehrman in for the next one.

01:17:01.640 --> 01:17:03.640
We can see if he can out-racist

01:17:03.640 --> 01:17:05.640
Arch with his German-ness.

01:17:05.640 --> 01:17:07.640
The thing is, he doesn't

01:17:07.640 --> 01:17:09.640
really do the racism thing, he just

01:17:09.640 --> 01:17:11.640
does the anti-semitism thing.

01:17:11.640 --> 01:17:13.640
Yeah.

01:17:13.640 --> 01:17:15.640
He's like...

01:17:15.640 --> 01:17:17.640
A while ago, he was talking

01:17:17.640 --> 01:17:19.640
about how his mouse was busted, and he's

01:17:19.640 --> 01:17:21.640
like, back in Auschwitz, our gear

01:17:21.640 --> 01:17:23.640
was on top shape.

01:17:23.640 --> 01:17:25.640
Jesus.

01:17:25.640 --> 01:17:27.640
There's more than a problem in Poland.

01:17:27.640 --> 01:17:29.640
I don't remember Fehrman's alt-right Arch,

01:17:29.640 --> 01:17:31.640
but we're going with it now.
