1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,720
We're back for another round of Lord of the Rings, the Rings of Power.

2
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:09,760
This time, Arch is with us.

3
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:11,760
How are you doing, Arch?

4
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:12,760
Thick.

5
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:13,760
Still recovering.

6
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:20,360
Are you still recovering, Arch, are you okay?

7
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:23,880
Death is no longer near, but it is in the vicinity.

8
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:28,920
So before we get into anything else, I would just like to quickly touch base with you,

9
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:29,920
Arch.

10
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:33,280
TLDR, what did you think of the last episode?

11
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:37,240
The creation of Mount Doom.

12
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:40,300
Everything's got to have an origin story, Arch, we have to explain everything.

13
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:43,840
I mean, we actually know how Mount Doom was created, but details.

14
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:45,080
Wait, did we actually?

15
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:46,760
What's the lore on that?

16
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:48,240
It was created by Morgoth.

17
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:52,720
Uh-uh, not according to the show, Arch.

18
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:55,240
Morgoth didn't create it, it was the water.

19
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:56,440
The water made it.

20
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:58,160
That was a big splash.

21
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:04,400
That's one of those problems, because in the actual story, Mount Doom was created by literal

22
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:09,240
Satan, which gives it power, which is why it's the only place the ring could be created.

23
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:14,120
Now it's just a volcano, which means the ring could have been destroyed wherever.

24
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:18,520
Like, Gandalf could have made a fire and that would have fixed the whole problem.

25
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:19,520
Maybe...

26
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:20,520
Definitely made it a lot less special.

27
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:21,520
Yeah.

28
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:25,680
Maybe somebody, maybe a wizard will be walking by one day and like drop his magic potions

29
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,640
and do it accidentally and make it special.

30
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:29,640
It's like, oops!

31
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:32,440
You know what they'll do?

32
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:34,000
They'll throw the Harfoots in there.

33
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,600
That's how they did it.

34
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:36,600
Yeah.

35
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:41,520
As soon as Sauron, that's Sauron, Jesus, as soon as Sauron regains his senses, and is

36
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:46,300
like, oh, I'm actually a person, he'll lead the Harfoots over and just dump them in.

37
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:47,300
That's how it'll work.

38
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:49,320
Now hold on, was this a Freudian slip?

39
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:53,400
Like Sauron's like the great evil, like what are you doing, dude?

40
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,400
No one tell them.

41
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:57,680
Mordor just turned Mordor into a giant Applebee's.

42
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:02,600
Look, I finished outloading the episode.

43
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:05,840
You already torrented it while we were doing our little preamble intro?

44
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:06,840
Oh shit.

45
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:07,840
Wait, hold on.

46
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:08,840
Wait, Arch!

47
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:10,280
Is your internet fast now?

48
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:11,280
Yes.

49
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:16,380
A nice man came to my house and he put a cable inside of my house and I'm using that cable

50
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:20,600
to transmit lights at a high speed and this light turns into information.

51
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:25,160
You finally got fiber optic out in the wilderness of Norway.

52
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:30,160
Another bit of news on the ratings front, because we've talked about ratings a few times

53
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,940
over the course of this series.

54
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:33,680
This was published.

55
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:39,480
Amazon's Rings of Power isn't making as big of a splash as HBO's House of the Dragon,

56
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:43,800
and it shows the potential risks of dueling big budget fantasy shows.

57
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:49,240
This does seem to be a thing that everyone's saying now that both shows have been, they've

58
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:52,600
been getting through their stories and the seasons are kind of coming to a close.

59
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:57,480
I've been watching both of them and I have to say, as a whole package, House of the Dragon

60
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:02,640
is so much better than Rings of Power, it's not even funny.

61
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:03,640
Still shit though.

62
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:07,720
I'd rather, I'd rather watch The Next Generation or something old.

63
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:11,840
What, you mean Degrassi The Next Generation, Kibs?

64
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,280
Hold on.

65
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,280
Sit down, Dev.

66
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:21,800
Well, first of all, I don't, I don't know that lore nearly is as much, so what's happening

67
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:24,720
in that show is still kind of surprising me a bit.

68
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:31,400
Secondly, they just seem to have that Game of Thrones edge that, you know, they're willing

69
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:34,720
to do a few things that Lord of the Rings is probably never going to be willing to do.

70
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:43,160
Like for example, having an underage niece and an uncle fuck, that's like, all right,

71
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,160
fair enough.

72
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,840
It was the medieval period, I get it.

73
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:51,160
Everyone's comparing them in terms of like popularity, right?

74
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:55,640
And it, it really seemed like when Amazon was talking about, you know, the 25 million

75
00:03:55,640 --> 00:04:01,560
viewers in the first episode, they were really trying to take a stab at HBO over this, because

76
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:03,800
these are the two shows that are competing right now.

77
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:10,080
There was a leak from, you guys know who Overlord is on YouTube?

78
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,360
I'm sure you do, Arch.

79
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,360
No?

80
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,360
Okay.

81
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:18,160
Well, he, he has reliably leaked things from the industry before.

82
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:22,840
He can't, he doesn't reveal a source because they're in Hollywood, but he has reliably

83
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:25,560
leaked things, things that turned out to be true.

84
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:33,760
And he is saying that he has an inside word that Amazon's first episode numbers were 9.5

85
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:37,720
million and then they dropped by half for episode three.

86
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:41,200
So not the 25 that everyone's saying.

87
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,720
See that is the problem.

88
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:51,480
We have no actually genuinely reliable information because first we're told like a 1.8 million,

89
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:52,960
but that wasn't all devices.

90
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:53,960
Okay.

91
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:58,320
And House of the Dragon had more than that, more than that at 4.8, then we're told 25

92
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,320
million.

93
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:00,320
All right.

94
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,320
That's one fuck of a leap.

95
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:04,000
And now it's like nine, but it's, was cut in half.

96
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:09,120
Meanwhile, uh, House of Dragons, I've seen the numbers go drastically down to the point

97
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,960
now they're talking about maybe only a million million.

98
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Okay.

99
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:19,800
Like, what do we believe if I can House of Dragons right now is like a zero one point

100
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:23,240
over cyberpunk edge runners, which I just watched the other day.

101
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:26,000
Like there is no comparing those two shows.

102
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
I haven't seen that.

103
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Is that good?

104
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,840
It is very good.

105
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:33,940
Barge is also in the desperate camp I see.

106
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:39,200
It seems to be the case that like quasi indie animation has really taken off.

107
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:43,000
Finally, we're getting out of the CalArts era and into some decent stuff.

108
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Hold on.

109
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
That's not indie.

110
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Fuck.

111
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Yeah, no.

112
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
That's triple A.

113
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,800
Studio Trigger is not an indie studio.

114
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,600
Oh, is that who's doing it?

115
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,600
Okay.

116
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,600
Nevermind.

117
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,600
Jesus.

118
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,600
All right.

119
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,520
They got a lot of flack for recycling a lot of similar, well, let's just say things were

120
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:00,240
similar in designs.

121
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:03,160
Oh, I was thinking of the League of Legends show.

122
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,160
Nevermind.

123
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,160
Okay.

124
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,160
Oh yeah.

125
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:10,880
The story in Arcane is not amazing.

126
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:14,600
It's quite standard, but the animation quality is beyond this world.

127
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:17,040
Also the dragon is better.

128
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,040
It's a soap opera though.

129
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,040
Yeah, it is.

130
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,040
It is.

131
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,040
It needs like a Tyrion.

132
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:23,760
It needs a Tyrion character to lighten the mood sometimes, but it's mostly a pretty good

133
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:24,760
show so far.

134
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:27,880
I also think it needs more like variety in the storytelling.

135
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:28,880
Yes.

136
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:29,880
Yeah.

137
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:30,880
But you know what?

138
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,880
Considering how shit everything else has been, I'll take it.

139
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:33,880
Yeah, no.

140
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:34,880
Wow.

141
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:35,880
Settling for less.

142
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:37,600
Yeah.

143
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,600
Sometimes you have to man.

144
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,960
This is literally the problem.

145
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:44,520
The reason why House of Dragon has like an 8.7 score, which is ridiculous for that piece

146
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:48,440
of shit show is because of people who are like Dev who's like, everything's shocked.

147
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:52,040
Not just Dev, that boss too.

148
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:58,320
Like, wow, this cereal only has 75% horse feces in it.

149
00:06:58,320 --> 00:06:59,320
Amazing.

150
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:03,920
I compare, I only mostly notice it.

151
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:10,720
He can feel the fucking half digested oats crunch, but doing these teething still chewing.

152
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,720
Could be worse.

153
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:22,000
Dev, it could be worse, at least you're not Anthony Burch.

154
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
It could be worse.

155
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,460
You might be watching Rings of Power.

156
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:28,240
I actually enjoy House of the Dragon.

157
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,560
I don't know why you think it's shit, Arch.

158
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:30,760
I think it's actually like half decent.

159
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:31,760
I'm enjoying it.

160
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:34,280
I enjoyed the part where the children were killing one another.

161
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:38,400
I quite liked that, but beyond that, I liked very little.

162
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,400
Really?

163
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:41,160
Pacing for me.

164
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,840
Very stupid show.

165
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:43,840
It's so fast.

166
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:46,480
What is it, stupid?

167
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:50,000
Every single episode has commenced with an enormous time skip.

168
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,840
The smallest of which has been a measly six months.

169
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:53,840
Yeah.

170
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:58,720
I mean, it's because like in the book, it's just like almost bullet points and there's

171
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:05,360
like a lot of history and they're really trying to like expand it as much as possible.

172
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:09,840
I think they can just slow down the pacing and make it a longer series.

173
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:13,200
I height almost every single casting choice.

174
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:19,240
You have young Raheamon, who looks like fetal alcohol syndrome, the advertisement.

175
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:24,480
You have Daemon, who's just, his face is weird and I don't like it.

176
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:29,440
The king is rotting and yet he refuses to fucking die, even though they've been like,

177
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:32,680
oh, he's dead like seven times now.

178
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:36,800
And then there's the goddamn Valerians, who are all black now, which annoys me because

179
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:40,400
her children aren't black and nobody seems to be raising this point.

180
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:43,560
It's like, hold on, your children are the wrong color, Raheamon.

181
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:44,560
This is suspicious.

182
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,840
And the king is like, no, you can't say that.

183
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:51,960
But seriously, though, yeah, that was the clip from Gordon Ramsay.

184
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:53,400
It's black.

185
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:56,560
The worst part is about, this is in the House of the Dragon show or something, but I'm just

186
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:59,560
going to, you know, as a quick aside.

187
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:06,420
The worst part is, is the reason they made the Valerians black is because the main character

188
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:11,560
of the Valerians, the grandfather of the entire clan, Corallus Valerian, he was described

189
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:14,440
as having like olive or tan skin.

190
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:20,560
Not because he was black, but because he was the only person from that family to like sail

191
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,560
around the world.

192
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:22,560
And he spent a lot of time on ships.

193
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:23,560
He was very tanned.

194
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:26,840
He spent a lot of time outdoors.

195
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:30,360
And there's like pictures of like, there's like lore pictures of him from the other books.

196
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:33,920
And he's standing with like other people from Westeros, and he's clearly darker than the

197
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:34,960
rest of them.

198
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,880
But he's not black.

199
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:44,840
And I think that that that really just seemed to be shoehorning representation and of course,

200
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:50,560
his entire clan is black now, like the Valerians are black, it just means they get to pass.

201
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:54,840
It also means we get to hear that fucking ancient annoying defense again, like what

202
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:57,040
dragons are okay, but not black people.

203
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,040
Yes.

204
00:09:58,040 --> 00:09:59,040
Yes.

205
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,760
In a universe where dragons are literally more commonplace than like people.

206
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:02,760
Yes.

207
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:07,000
It's not even just the Valerians, there's random extras who are black and it just annoys

208
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,480
me these days because I look at that.

209
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:13,280
And I think to myself, that was a boardroom decision, not a writing one.

210
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:17,360
And yeah, for me, it ruins my interest in the show because I'm like, okay, well, this

211
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,360
is political.

212
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:20,360
I don't want that.

213
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:23,200
These black person, they ruined.

214
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,200
Yes.

215
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,200
Oh, God.

216
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:30,000
At least in medieval England, it's like, hello, hi, how did you come here?

217
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,200
Very long thought, right?

218
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,400
Are we are we a show full of racists?

219
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:34,400
Yes.

220
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:39,600
All I'm saying is that when I was at what it is, I love Jews too.

221
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:44,400
I am going to make a Shaka Zulu TV show and there's going to be one white person in Shaka's

222
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:45,400
army.

223
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:46,440
No one will ever mention him.

224
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:50,440
He'll just be there in every single fucking scene.

225
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:52,080
Just in the background, hanging out.

226
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:53,080
Yep.

227
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:54,080
He's going to look like everybody else.

228
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:57,840
He's going to have his cowhide shield and he's going to be pale as fuck and a ginger

229
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:03,840
and nobody's ever going to mention it.

230
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:06,600
Taftaz is just like quietly like, I don't want to get canceled.

231
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:07,600
I can't say anything.

232
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,600
I can't afford.

233
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,000
I'm just starting my channel.

234
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
I can't.

235
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,320
I think I've already been canceled for lots of things.

236
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,920
Oh, yeah, that's true.

237
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:18,360
I've, I've seen some of your debates regarding trans issues.

238
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:21,320
I know what's going on.

239
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:30,420
So someone who watches us actually bought that cringy elf ears shirt.

240
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:35,800
It's I mean, it's not, it's not a bad shirt, but it's very clearly just like a regular

241
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:40,840
blue shirt that you might get for five cents from China with this shit just printed right

242
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:41,840
on top of it.

243
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:45,600
And it'll wash out after about a year or two going through the washing machine.

244
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:49,720
Well, like most diversity, it doesn't stand up to water well.

245
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:54,280
Oh, my God, Arch, you are going to get my channel fucking banned.

246
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:58,360
Arch is racist.

247
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:59,360
You know this.

248
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:00,660
We all know this.

249
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:05,220
I guess the final thing I'll point out before we get on the road here is I did a video maybe

250
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:10,680
a year ago looking at like the initial Vanity Fair expose, it was an expose.

251
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:13,000
It was what was it like a preview of the show.

252
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,720
As I was making that video, I dug into why this was happening.

253
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:20,440
And basically what happened was Tolkien's son died because Tolkien's son wasn't letting

254
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:21,960
any of this shit happen.

255
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:24,060
But as soon as he died, the floodgates kind of opened.

256
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:30,320
And then back in like 2015 or 2016, Amazon quietly bought a bunch just dropped a bunch

257
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:35,040
of money to get to pick up the series and like quietly started beginning making this.

258
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:40,280
This came out just a few days ago on The Hollywood Reporter.

259
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:44,680
This is an interview with some people who are showrunners of the show, and they're talking

260
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:49,240
about season two and, you know, the poor fan reception and all this.

261
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:51,740
But one nugget right in the middle of it.

262
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:57,760
Basically back while the series was still, you know, safely, safely guarded by those

263
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:59,560
who care about it.

264
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:03,120
Netflix actually pitched a show before Amazon got involved.

265
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:09,080
And Netflix said their plan was to basically turn it into Marvel where they're going to

266
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:14,800
have like, they're going to have like multiple different properties happening at once.

267
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:19,360
They were going to do like a Gandalf side series, they were going to do an Aragorn series,

268
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:23,460
they were just going to do, they're just going to give everyone their own show and just do

269
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:28,440
like an extended universe that like interweaves very Marvel, very Marvel like because the

270
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:30,500
Tolkien estate was still in charge of things.

271
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:33,040
They were immediately like, Oh my God, we can never let any of these people ever do

272
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:34,040
any of this.

273
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:37,640
We can't, we have to like, and they cut off everyone, they're like, Nope, nope, not doing

274
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:38,640
anything.

275
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:39,640
Nope.

276
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:40,640
Fuck you.

277
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:41,640
I don't care how much money you give us.

278
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:42,640
No.

279
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:43,640
And that basically persisted until Tolkien's son died.

280
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:47,760
I have a feeling that Amazon might have the same like long term vision for this.

281
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:50,880
Oh, without a doubt, this is just the beginning.

282
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:51,880
Yeah.

283
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:56,640
The thing is, we already know the Rings of Power is a flop from Amazon's point of view,

284
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:57,640
but very interesting.

285
00:13:57,640 --> 00:14:00,960
And I'll make a video about this probably for Friday.

286
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:04,360
Because recently, you know, they've been shooting all this in New Zealand, etc.

287
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:05,840
It's been really expensive.

288
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:11,580
And they've said that all this is going to cost like $5 billion for the five seasons.

289
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:16,840
Very quietly, they've sold all of their studio equipment in New Zealand, and they've moved

290
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:23,280
to London now where they will be starting to shoot just inside of a regular studio.

291
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:26,720
Oh, quiet.

292
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:31,880
So in all due likelihood, Amazon has given up and but they can't cancel it.

293
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:33,760
They know they can't cancel it.

294
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:39,560
So they've shifted them off to some dark back corner office in London and just make

295
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:40,560
movie.

296
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:45,560
Well, actually, this is something that I saw another media recently, what they often do

297
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:50,240
now rather than go to locations, they did this, I think he did it in London, and they

298
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:54,120
did it for the Mandalorian is they'll actually computer generate an entire landscape.

299
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:57,600
However, it's not like they just insert them on a green screen and put them in front of

300
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:58,600
it.

301
00:14:58,600 --> 00:14:59,600
They don't they don't do that anymore.

302
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:00,600
Because that looks kind of fake.

303
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:03,660
And you know, it is fake, what they'll do almost like a VR headset, they'll 360 view

304
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:09,320
an entire computer generated landscape, and then project that onto a dome and the actor

305
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:12,240
goes into the dome and then acts the scene.

306
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:15,740
So it looks like that they're outside, but they're not.

307
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:20,380
And the acting dome, the acting apparently, it's really hard to do this.

308
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:22,460
It's hard on the people working on the set.

309
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:27,620
Because if you don't, it's it's tuned to exactly where the actor is in the dome.

310
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:32,160
And if you're not where he is, or where the camera is, or the camera is, if you're not

311
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:36,200
in the exact spot, all the images like just look distorted because you're looking at them

312
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,960
from the wrong angle.

313
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:42,820
Everyone who works in the acting dome is getting like motion sickness and shit.

314
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:44,440
But that's how it rather than going to places.

315
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:46,000
That's how they're shooting these now.

316
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,560
Fuck actors.

317
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:50,560
It's better than getting shot on set, I guess.

318
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:57,640
I hope they get put into the wage cages to Jesus arch arch, you're relentless tonight

319
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:58,640
people.

320
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:06,800
So I've got my my mug, piping full of piping hot soup broth, as I do in the evenings.

321
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:10,560
That's just just chicken noodle.

322
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,960
Just put it in there and boil it up.

323
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:14,700
And no longer to drink coffee at nights anymore.

324
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:16,880
So but kids, I think it's time.

325
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:19,680
It's time for us to watch the eyes.

326
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,720
Oh my god, an hour and 12 minutes.

327
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:23,560
I'm never going to bed.

328
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:24,560
Let's go.

329
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:28,120
Because we're gonna see the eye of Sauron in it.

330
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:30,040
Honestly, probably that obvious.

331
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:32,080
Oh, for God's sake.

332
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:34,680
Oh, look, the legend of Vox Maxima.

333
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:35,680
I tried to use that.

334
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:36,680
It was not very good.

335
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:38,800
No, I don't know why you did.

336
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:43,960
But then again, your tastes are, but I was desperate.

337
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:44,960
Recap skip.

338
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:47,640
Oh boy, we're gonna see the Harfoot's again.

339
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:49,360
I miss those guys.

340
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:51,760
I don't.

341
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:54,880
Oh, Jesus.

342
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:56,920
That sounds like it was your fetish tap Tash.

343
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:58,960
Oh, the Harfoot's.

344
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:00,960
I'm so happy.

345
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:02,960
Oh, dirty eye.

346
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:03,960
Gross.

347
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:05,960
Yeah, now, Galadriel is dead, by the way.

348
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:06,960
I don't accept this.

349
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:07,960
Yeah.

350
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:08,960
Yeah.

351
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:09,960
She's dead.

352
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:10,960
She would not be alive.

353
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:11,960
She's an L.

354
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:12,960
She's an L.

355
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:13,960
Oh, yeah.

356
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:14,960
So that actually reminds me.

357
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:19,840
There was a video on, like, I think on LiveLeak at one point.

358
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:25,160
And it was just a Russian guy who gets like an explosion goes off in his face.

359
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:29,960
And you can tell by the way he's speaking that he singed the inside of his lungs.

360
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:32,080
And he's like, I'm totally fine, guys.

361
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:33,160
Don't worry about it.

362
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:37,160
But with the way that those injuries go is as soon as your lungs start to swell, you're

363
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:38,160
just gonna die.

364
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,160
You have like 20 minutes to live, and that's it.

365
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:43,180
And it's kind of grotesque being on a ticking time bomb like that.

366
00:17:43,180 --> 00:17:47,040
But that's what happens to everyone who gets like a fireball of ash in the face.

367
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:49,720
And everyone should be dead.

368
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:50,720
Everyone is dead.

369
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:53,920
The rest of the show is just a fever dream.

370
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:56,680
Very before death, yep.

371
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:59,680
Oh, the flaming horse!

372
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:02,680
Runner or no.

373
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:03,680
God dammit.

374
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:07,680
It had one chance to make its life worth something.

375
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:09,680
I mean, they did the right thing.

376
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:11,680
You know, died.

377
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:15,680
Well, we'll see about that.

378
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:20,680
These are the corpses of all the people banned from Twitch for saying Cracker.

379
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:22,680
No, these are all the banned reviews.

380
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:28,440
Lake has been warm enough for wood to spontaneously combust, but humans are still fine in this

381
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,440
area.

382
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:31,440
Yeah, it's a bit much.

383
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:33,440
All the water would have been boiled out of you instantly.

384
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:34,440
Oh, cool.

385
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:35,440
Even the babies are alive.

386
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:36,440
Impressive.

387
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:39,440
You know, we've always been told that babies are fragile and you shouldn't drop them on

388
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:41,440
the ground, but clearly they're quite sturdy.

389
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:46,440
I think this would be a big problem, but it turns out it's actually not.

390
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:52,440
Have I ever told any of you that I was actually unironically dropped as a baby?

391
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,200
No, but your behavior is sort of made again.

392
00:18:55,200 --> 00:19:00,200
My dad put me on the kitchen counter to answer a phone call, and I immediately rolled off.

393
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,200
You are going to use that against you, Dev.

394
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:08,200
Oh my god, they're just walking past burning people?

395
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:09,200
Wow.

396
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:11,200
You're not going to throw something on that guy?

397
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:13,200
Heroes, ladies and gentlemen.

398
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,200
It's like, help, I'm burning to death slowly.

399
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:18,200
I like how every named character is okay.

400
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:20,200
Well, of course.

401
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:21,960
My queen, you're black.

402
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:22,960
Surely you must be fire resistant.

403
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:23,960
Lift.

404
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:26,960
Jesus.

405
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:27,960
Ah, the queen had to do it.

406
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:28,960
Wait, Arch.

407
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:29,960
The woman had to do it.

408
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:31,960
Arch, first water, now fire.

409
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:34,960
What the fuck is with you and black people and the elements?

410
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:37,960
Well, no, I said diversity doesn't survive water.

411
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:41,960
Black people survive fire, as you can clearly see by this show.

412
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:42,960
Other friend died.

413
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:43,960
Oh no.

414
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:45,960
Oh no, I'm just saying.

415
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:48,960
Prophecy didn't really make us care about that character in your show.

416
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:51,720
I don't kill anything.

417
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:53,720
Oh, was that supposed to be a character we know?

418
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:56,720
That's the other friend in the trio friend group.

419
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:59,720
Yeah, it's the third guy that never got named.

420
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:03,720
The AK red shirt of the friend group.

421
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,720
Oh no, the death of other friend.

422
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:12,720
His actor's like, this'll totally launch my career, guys.

423
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:18,720
I think that was symbolic of what happened to his career for being in the show.

424
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:21,480
Yep, this entire situation.

425
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:26,480
This is actually just the Amazon HQ right now that we're looking at.

426
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:30,480
I mean, yeah, when the reviews came in.

427
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,480
And Bezos is just inside.

428
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:34,480
Everything's fine.

429
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:35,480
It's okay.

430
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,480
Wait, why is there a fireball?

431
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,480
Because that's how fire functions die.

432
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:42,480
He wasn't important.

433
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,480
No, no, he's fine.

434
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:46,480
Because AZ is over.

435
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:49,240
Nice, yeah.

436
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:53,240
Oh yay, what a transition.

437
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:56,240
Wish he had some of this water, eh?

438
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:01,240
There's slaves back there.

439
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:03,240
They just leave him alone.

440
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:05,240
I will laugh if everyone knows.

441
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:07,240
Yes, I was about to say it's all going to be burnt to shit.

442
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:09,240
There you go.

443
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:11,240
How did you guys fuck this up?

444
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:13,240
Well, they were back in Bragg and then suddenly...

445
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:15,240
Ah, the rocks.

446
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Oh.

447
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,000
That's a long flight, but...

448
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Wait, do you think that we're going to see Ents in this show?

449
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
I feel like we already have.

450
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Oh, maybe.

451
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
I don't know about that, dude.

452
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Well, he almost fixed it.

453
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Wait, hold on.

454
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Here, Kibbs, if you don't mind, go back a bit.

455
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
There.

456
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Yeah, I'm pretty sure he pushed her under the tree.

457
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Look at the wood.

458
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,000
I feel like whoever made the show hasn't ever seen burning wood before.

459
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Because that's just wood painted black.

460
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
You mean it's been diversified?

461
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
It is diversified.

462
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
It only burns from the edge.

463
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Yeah, it's not actually burnt wood.

464
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
It's not burnt wood!

465
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:17,760
It's painted dried wood.

466
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:20,760
It wouldn't even be asked to burn the wood.

467
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,760
Oh my god.

468
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:28,760
I know that I come from a small town, right?

469
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:33,760
But even city kids have to do a campfire once in a while, right?

470
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:36,760
Or they've seen something burn, right?

471
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:38,760
I don't know enough.

472
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:41,760
I went to camping once or twice.

473
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,760
Okay.

474
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:48,520
If it's burnt like that bad, then normally what happens is the inside's also black or ash.

475
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:51,520
Yeah, everything's just ash, and it crumbles.

476
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:53,520
And it's very dry.

477
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:55,520
This is just clearly painted wood.

478
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:58,520
Why should we trust any elf?

479
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:00,520
Why shouldn't you?

480
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:03,520
All this fucking retarded elf hate.

481
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:06,520
Aren't you guys already working together?

482
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:09,520
But Elrond half elf.

483
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:11,520
Ah, he's half elf.

484
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,520
He's a bastard.

485
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:17,280
Wait, was Elrond always a half elf?

486
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:19,280
No.

487
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:21,280
How to talk to short people.

488
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:24,280
How to talk to short people.

489
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:29,280
I hate this entire plotline.

490
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:31,280
Like, Mithril wasn't... this isn't Mithril.

491
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:33,280
Like, they knew about Mithril before this.

492
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:37,280
They were making shit out of Mithril before this.

493
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:40,280
Don't be bothered by it. It's not Lord of the Rings.

494
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:44,040
So Kibbs, I've noticed whenever you move the mouse,

495
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:47,040
over top of the feed,

496
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:51,040
you get a nice little handy list of all the people

497
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:56,040
in the side who will never get an acting job again after the show bombs.

498
00:23:57,040 --> 00:24:00,040
I mean, I like the x-ray function when I'm watching good shows.

499
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:02,040
This is useless here.

500
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:04,040
I don't care about any of these.

501
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:08,040
The fate of the elves was decided many ages ago.

502
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:11,800
My mind's much wiser,

503
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:14,800
much farther-seeing than our own.

504
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:16,800
You know, the Amazon Rising stuff.

505
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:22,800
You know, the elves are still pretty long-lived.

506
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:26,800
And you're gonna be king one day. You can just do it.

507
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:34,800
He just put his hand on the molten piece of metal.

508
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:36,800
He did, yes.

509
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:40,800
No, at least it was covered good.

510
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:42,800
I was about to say she was holding that piece of molten metal,

511
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:44,800
but no, there was a little thing wrapped around it.

512
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:47,800
When she put it in, there was no bubbling.

513
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:52,800
It was just fake steam and the ripple of putting a cold thing into water.

514
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:56,800
Otherwise, she'd have to hold onto something molten, which would hurt.

515
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:59,800
I'm sorry, elf. We Jews cannot give you your shiny ox.

516
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:02,800
I just come back in like 15 years when our king is dead.

517
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:04,800
Yeah.

518
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:06,800
Because dwarves don't live that long, do they?

519
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:09,560
They live the same amount of time as regular people.

520
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:11,560
I think they live a bit longer.

521
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:17,560
Also, the problem with this mysterious unknown fucking random-ass magic disease

522
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:20,560
is that they have given us no frame of reference for this.

523
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:22,560
Like, they're saying, like,

524
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:24,560
we'll all be dead tomorrow. Like, why?

525
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:27,560
Like, I thought this was a slow creeping corruption or something.

526
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:30,560
You're giving me your crack cocaine.

527
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:32,560
Please hit your head on the door.

528
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:35,560
The scene is so undermined by the plot, it's not even funny.

529
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:40,320
You know, I liked the elves and the dwarves shit, but I hate this

530
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:42,320
because it's just magic macguffin.

531
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:45,320
Like, ah, shiny rock under mountain, make elves live longer.

532
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:47,320
Why? What? How? When?

533
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:50,320
Also, surely the elves can go mine it themselves.

534
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:52,320
They know what it is now.

535
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:54,320
My god, symbolism.

536
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:56,320
Yep, look at that. Suddenly the leaf is like, I'm getting better now.

537
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:02,320
Yep.

538
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:07,080
The magic rock literally un-rots the leaf.

539
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:10,080
Oh god, this is very dumb.

540
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:13,080
The leaf gets up and starts walking, dancing.

541
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:16,080
They're very dramatic about it, too.

542
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:21,080
To be fair, if I saw a leaf de-age before my eyes, I'd be like, ugh.

543
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:26,080
You have to put those in the anti-aging creams.

544
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:29,080
Yeah, but magic space rock works.

545
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:35,080
It's magic tree rock, actually.

546
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:37,080
Ah, good. Back to death and destruction.

547
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:43,080
The show livens up a lot when the bad people are dying.

548
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:45,080
Wait, when did...

549
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:48,080
When did Theo get with Galadriel?

550
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:51,080
When they started walking together, I guess.

551
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:53,080
Last burning place. She picked him out of the wreckage and was like,

552
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:56,080
random person, come with me.

553
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:58,080
I don't know why our characters need to talk to each other,

554
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:01,080
because you're really nobody, but I need you to accompany me now.

555
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:03,840
It's like, okay.

556
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:05,840
It says here in the script, oh, okay, gotcha.

557
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:09,840
This is so forced.

558
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:11,840
Also, apparently the orcs survived this shit just fine.

559
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:14,840
I guess they are naturally resistant to fire.

560
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:16,840
They're orky borkies, Arch.

561
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:19,840
Orky borkies are impervious to many things.

562
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:21,840
That's a lot of survivors.

563
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:24,840
Yo, what the fuck? Everyone should be dead.

564
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:27,840
Yet nobody is.

565
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:31,600
We saw a few bad people, so it's fine.

566
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:35,600
I think everyone just likes the visual of

567
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:38,600
a snowstorm of ash.

568
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:41,600
Because they did kind of the same thing with Game of Thrones, right?

569
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:43,600
Four horses, right?

570
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:45,600
I left your son to die, because I'm

571
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:47,600
kind of shit at this whole queening thing.

572
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,600
It's fine, he's fine.

573
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:56,600
He still has to say no.

574
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:59,360
Yeah.

575
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:01,360
He's still plot relevant.

576
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:03,360
Also, I'm pretty sure her plate armor should be very, very

577
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:05,360
warm at this point.

578
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:07,360
Yeah.

579
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:09,360
A little bit uncomfortable.

580
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:11,360
They cast heat metal on it.

581
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:13,360
The ash that's collecting on it, making it even warmer.

582
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:15,360
Hold on, Numenor set their camp?

583
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,360
I thought they just galloped in the whole fucking way.

584
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:19,360
No, no, no. You must understand.

585
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:21,360
Dev, plot says camp.

586
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:23,360
Okay.

587
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:25,360
Numenorians established a base on the perimeter of the ash.

588
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:28,120
The orcs will move in daylight now.

589
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:30,120
No, they won't.

590
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:32,120
This is how the orcs should move.

591
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:34,120
This is how they do it.

592
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:36,120
No, they do it by a fucking magic.

593
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:38,120
The clouds that cover the orcs

594
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:40,120
when they are invading the world of Men

595
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:43,120
isn't ash, it's fucking magic.

596
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:45,120
Yeah, didn't Sauron summon

597
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:47,120
thunderclouds, basically?

598
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:50,120
It's fine, there's enough ash for them

599
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:52,120
to move through the daylight.

600
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:54,120
They explained it.

601
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:56,880
Yes, give the child your primary means

602
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:58,880
of defense after talking about how the orcs

603
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:00,880
can move in daylight now.

604
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:02,880
Thank you for handing me this, Swede.

605
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:04,880
I have no training whatsoever.

606
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:06,880
I'm far more likely to cut myself

607
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:08,880
rather than the enemy, but thanks anyways.

608
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,880
Yeah, swords are actually fairly

609
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:12,880
tricky weapons.

610
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:14,880
Wait, did she have two of them?

611
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,880
No, she just gave him

612
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,880
her only weapon.

613
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:20,880
Oh no, she has that knife.

614
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:22,880
The ice climbing knife.

615
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:25,640
I've downgraded my equipment to crap here.

616
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:27,640
You're level 2,

617
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:29,640
have this level 16 sword.

618
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:31,640
She has to level her knife skills.

619
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:33,640
It looks even worse when it's dirty.

620
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:35,640
How much further should we reach the encampment?

621
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:39,640
Are we there yet?

622
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:41,640
I know this is slow, isn't it?

623
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:43,640
Were you not there

624
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:45,640
when you set it up, Queen?

625
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:49,640
I have the Breaking Bad looks.

626
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:51,640
I was expecting her to hit her face again.

627
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:53,640
I thought they were going to have to like, thwap.

628
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:59,640
My queen, stop asking questions.

629
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:01,640
She really is just complaining, Jesus.

630
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:04,640
Freaking whiny ass little queen, Christ's sake.

631
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:18,640
She's blind!

632
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:23,640
She doesn't.

633
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:27,640
I do kind of feel bad for her.

634
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:38,640
Okay, that shot looked like

635
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:40,640
they were just walking through a regular forest

636
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,640
and they just kind of tinted it grey.

637
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:44,640
Like,

638
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:46,640
like a version of Day for Night.

639
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:48,640
But instead of blue, it was like

640
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:50,640
red and grey.

641
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:53,640
I was going to see that a part of the tree

642
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:55,640
is healed or something.

643
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:57,640
We're not going to see it.

644
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:59,640
There we go.

645
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:01,640
It's a flower now.

646
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:03,640
The flower's coming out.

647
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:05,640
The thing is, he's done as much bad

648
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:07,640
as he's done good.

649
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:09,640
Precisely because they don't want it to be obvious.

650
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:11,640
The problem is, if you do that,

651
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:13,640
it also means that there's no actual

652
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:15,640
building of the character.

653
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:17,640
It's just building of the plot.

654
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:19,640
Like, if this guy is a wizard now,

655
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:23,640
he's done so much fucking damage

656
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:25,640
to the half-woods.

657
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:27,640
Like, by bumbling around.

658
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:29,640
He's almost killed the few of them a couple of times.

659
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:31,640
He's almost frozen that chick's hands off.

660
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:35,640
Not to mention killing all of the Fireflies

661
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:37,640
with his bullshit magic.

662
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:39,640
And I can gather more.

663
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:41,640
But he's a confused hobble myth.

664
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:43,640
Yeah, it's not his fault.

665
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:45,640
He didn't know any better.

666
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:47,640
Listen, Lilith, you're in...

667
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:49,640
I will use it to keep the

668
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:51,640
doctors away.

669
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:53,640
Lilith, you're in California, right?

670
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:55,640
You probably see like a dozen guys like that a day

671
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:57,640
all bumbling around.

672
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:59,640
I've seen the videos.

673
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:01,640
They're walking around on fentanyl or whatever.

674
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:03,640
They be in downtown.

675
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:07,640
Is she

676
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:09,640
sharpening the wooden wheel with a rock?

677
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:11,640
Yep.

678
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:13,640
What?

679
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:15,640
It's like a spirit.

680
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:19,640
Everything's just an allegory

681
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:21,640
to the other movies and the books.

682
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:23,640
It's terrible.

683
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:25,640
This show has nothing original about it.

684
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:27,640
Does that remind you of the movie?

685
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:29,640
She's sharpening the wheel

686
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:31,640
with the rock.

687
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:33,640
Why?

688
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:35,640
Because she needs to do something on the set

689
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:37,640
that makes it look like she's doing something.

690
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:39,640
Simple.

691
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:41,640
So they hand her a rock, they hand her a wheel.

692
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:43,640
Here, rub this rock against the wheel.

693
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:45,640
It'll make you look, uh, working.

694
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:47,640
Trust me, you'll get a job after this.

695
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:49,640
Are you sure?

696
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:51,640
Jesus, I thought...

697
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:53,640
I tuned out there

698
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:55,640
for a minute and I thought you were doing like a casting

699
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:57,640
couch thing.

700
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:59,640
I was thinking about it.

701
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:05,640
It's like, kid, I just met you five

702
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:07,640
minutes ago.

703
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:13,640
How do you

704
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:15,640
know what happened?

705
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:17,640
Yeah.

706
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:19,640
Yeah, don't really know.

707
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:21,640
Oh, I should have known that the old guy would turn

708
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:23,640
the damn thing.

709
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:25,640
And that he had the sword

710
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:27,640
to begin with?

711
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:29,640
What?

712
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:31,640
All he knows is that he didn't have it.

713
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:33,640
Yes, this is one mighty

714
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:35,640
ass fucking leap of logic here.

715
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:37,640
Like, I don't have a sword, a volcano explodes.

716
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:39,640
Uh huh.

717
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:43,640
Oh hey, the orcs arrived. Lucky.

718
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:45,640
I guess that's

719
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:47,640
why they had to take them prisoners so that

720
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:49,640
they could live to threaten the party later.

721
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:51,640
The orcs

722
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:53,640
just smell them.

723
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:55,640
Yeah, they should be able to, eh?

724
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:57,640
The orc sense

725
00:33:57,640 --> 00:33:59,640
of smell varies considerably based upon

726
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:01,640
what the block of mass is.

727
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:03,640
Also, shouldn't their scent

728
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:05,640
be slightly masked due to all the ash?

729
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:07,640
Yeah, I guess so, huh?

730
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:09,640
Also, shouldn't the orcs be covered in ash, too?

731
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:11,640
Now, they're the ones

732
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:13,640
hiding underground.

733
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:15,640
That guy

734
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:17,640
looks surprisingly

735
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:19,640
un-ashed.

736
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:21,640
Also, I love how the orcs who see in the dark

737
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:23,640
keep using fucking torches.

738
00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:25,640
When you

739
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:27,640
see what they are...

740
00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:29,640
I mean, it's better than

741
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:31,640
Game of Thrones, I guess, where everything is dark.

742
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:33,640
Yeah.

743
00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:35,640
Is he gonna mine it himself?

744
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:37,640
These two

745
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:39,640
are probably the best part of the show.

746
00:34:39,640 --> 00:34:41,640
Consistently.

747
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:43,640
Yep.

748
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:45,640
It's the only part I actually pay attention, really.

749
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:47,640
He found a chasm full of myth.

750
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:05,640
Wait a second.

751
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:09,640
Arch, I know you know something about

752
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:11,640
about this sort of thing.

753
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:13,640
About this sort of thing, specifically.

754
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:15,640
Is that how

755
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:17,640
veins of ore work?

756
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:19,640
Oh, yeah, totally.

757
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:21,640
No, it's not embedded in the rock or anything.

758
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:23,640
It's dramatically placed

759
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:25,640
on the surface of rocks.

760
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:27,640
That way, you can look at it and go,

761
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:29,640
gold!

762
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:35,640
Five minute walk back home.

763
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:37,640
I like the tiny drizzle of

764
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:39,640
water in the background there.

765
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:41,640
If this were like a

766
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:43,640
Disney movie, this is where he'd break

767
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:45,640
out in song.

768
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:47,640
This is the exact moment.

769
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:49,640
Yep.

770
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:51,640
A whole new friendship.

771
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:53,640
Something inside you

772
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:55,640
is ill-formed.

773
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:57,640
Jesus.

774
00:35:57,640 --> 00:35:59,640
That's harsh.

775
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:01,640
Harsh?

776
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:03,640
Are dwarven babies

777
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:05,640
born with beards, too?

778
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:07,640
That was a euphemism.

779
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:09,640
Duh.

780
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:23,640
How dare you have a friend?

781
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:33,640
Great, you just did it.

782
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:35,640
Assassinate him.

783
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:37,640
No one will witness it.

784
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:43,640
Oh, no, his, uh, thing.

785
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:45,640
I don't know what that is, but yeah.

786
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:47,640
It was definitely a thing.

787
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:49,640
Yeah, it's probably like his

788
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:51,640
princely thing.

789
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:53,640
It's like in case somebody was looking at him

790
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:55,640
and was like, who the fuck are you?

791
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:57,640
And he lifts his beard.

792
00:36:57,640 --> 00:36:59,640
Here's my cattle collar.

793
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:01,640
Here's my cattle collar.

794
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:07,640
It's like, I'll just take it with me.

795
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:09,640
Looks back,

796
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:11,640
oh, I probably should.

797
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:13,640
Oh, you have to say it plot-wise.

798
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:15,640
It's not yours anymore.

799
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:21,640
The writing was great.

800
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:23,640
Wait, so what's his plan

801
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:25,640
for the throne then?

802
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:27,640
There's like another

803
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:29,640
civil war and succession crisis.

804
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:31,640
They sleep

805
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:33,640
with that shit in their hair.

806
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:35,640
Listen, all of the trees

807
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:37,640
have regrown. Why? Because

808
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:39,640
magic, that's why.

809
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:41,640
Because he was good and you were wrong, barge.

810
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:43,640
I'll never understand.

811
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:45,640
There's sodom apples.

812
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:47,640
Oh, wow.

813
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:49,640
We'll go to market with all the

814
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:51,640
crop we've got. What market?

815
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:53,640
Yeah,

816
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:55,640
didn't know they had markets.

817
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:57,640
I think it's pre-capitalism, guys.

818
00:37:57,640 --> 00:37:59,640
Do they have a vibrant

819
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:01,640
harfoot economy?

820
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:03,640
Are there more harfoots?

821
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:05,640
Yeah, no doctors will fuck with you now.

822
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:07,640
Hurry, let's pick all of the apples

823
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:09,640
as quickly as possible.

824
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:11,640
That way they'll rot.

825
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:13,640
Yeah, like, maybe they're moving on, I guess.

826
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:15,640
They've got to get a bunch of them.

827
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:17,640
A better feast, I guess.

828
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:19,640
Yeah, but normally if they're making applesauce

829
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:21,640
they try to preserve it

830
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:23,640
instead of just picking all of it.

831
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:25,640
Ooh, wait.

832
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:29,640
They're supposed to be small people, right?

833
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:31,640
Like three foot tall, whatever?

834
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:35,640
Why is it that the apples are

835
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:37,640
regular human-sized in their hands?

836
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:39,640
Because Amazon doesn't care that much, Dev.

837
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:43,640
Oh, look, all of the fish are dead.

838
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:45,640
No?

839
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:47,640
That's a big person foot.

840
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:49,640
It's a big person, oh my no.

841
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:51,640
Hey, bring the bucket, why did you leave

842
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:53,640
the bucket? There's no reason to leave the bucket.

843
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:55,640
Well, now the bucket's its own character

844
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:57,640
going on an adventure.

845
00:38:57,640 --> 00:38:59,640
Oh good, the bucket will demonstrate to us

846
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:01,640
the bad people.

847
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:03,640
Oh no.

848
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:05,640
It's like, aha, harfoots must be nearby.

849
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:07,640
And for some reason

850
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:09,640
they use human-sized buckets.

851
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:11,640
That's weird.

852
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:13,640
That would be really heavy for a harfoot.

853
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:15,640
I know that would probably sound like a stickler, but

854
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:17,640
the original movie did it so well,

855
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:19,640
the size difference thing.

856
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:21,640
And here, they really just don't fucking bother.

857
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:25,640
Look, hmm, this tree seems very

858
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:27,640
fruity. Let's destroy it.

859
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:33,640
I hate the armor design in this

860
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:35,640
fucking show so much.

861
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:37,640
Oh, flour.

862
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:41,640
How disgusting.

863
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:43,640
I pluck at it.

864
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:45,640
I look at it.

865
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:47,640
You know, maybe I'm just a weirdo.

866
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:51,640
But I do kind of find her hot in a weird way.

867
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:53,640
Yeah, that does make you a weirdo.

868
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:55,640
Oh, okay.

869
00:39:57,640 --> 00:39:59,640
That's not right, Death.

870
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:01,640
I think so.

871
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:03,640
Oh, I mean, either way. I can go both ways on this one.

872
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:05,640
My turn.

873
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:07,640
Death. Dumpster.

874
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:09,640
In. Now.

875
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:11,640
Blow it out.

876
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:13,640
You know you want to.

877
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:15,640
Gonna use her hand to do it, not blow it.

878
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:17,640
Hmm.

879
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:19,640
Well, that's unusual.

880
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:21,640
Also,

881
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:23,640
they're doing the height difference thing with the hill

882
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:25,640
as a way to not

883
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:27,640
do the size difference thing.

884
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:33,640
Oh, shit.

885
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:35,640
All the apples.

886
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:37,640
They're all gonna die. Thank God.

887
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:43,640
Damn, none of them were asleep inside of their carts

888
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:45,640
when this happened. Quick, kill the wizards.

889
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:47,640
Kill the wizards.

890
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:49,640
At least all the apples will be cooked.

891
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:51,640
Yeah.

892
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:53,640
They weren't gonna preserve her.

893
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:55,640
Also, every single cock-sucking

894
00:40:55,640 --> 00:40:57,640
one of the Harfoots were outside of their homes

895
00:40:57,640 --> 00:40:59,640
when this happened.

896
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:07,640
At least kill some of them.

897
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:09,640
Like, the black one. Kill him.

898
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:11,640
He's not necessary anymore. He's done his part.

899
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:13,640
Of course, Arch wants the black one dead.

900
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:15,640
Someone, just kill some of them.

901
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:17,640
Arch's racism is showing. Nope, too late.

902
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:19,640
The only one who goes under the blackies.

903
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:21,640
Fucking Harfoots.

904
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:25,640
God, more people need to die

905
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:27,640
in this show.

906
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:29,640
Only specific

907
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:31,640
colors, right, Arch?

908
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:33,640
Sick bastard.

909
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:35,640
All those rumors were true

910
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:37,640
in the end, Arch.

911
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:39,640
I've just forced you to walk for days

912
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:41,640
with a giant gash in your side.

913
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:43,640
Well, okay.

914
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:45,640
I am horse, I speak English.

915
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:47,640
My master's still arrived.

916
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:49,640
He's dead, Beric.

917
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:51,640
You must give him up, Beric.

918
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:57,640
Well, I mean, he walked all this way here,

919
00:41:57,640 --> 00:41:59,640
so clearly he will listen to some of you.

920
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:01,640
You gonna turn him loose so he can run home to daddy?

921
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:03,640
Yep.

922
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:05,640
Oh yeah, he's gonna go rescue fucking Isildur.

923
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:07,640
Right, why the fuck not?

924
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:09,640
I mean, why are you surprised,

925
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:11,640
Arch? Come on, get with the program here.

926
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:13,640
Thank you.

927
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:15,640
I'm going to find Measter now.

928
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:19,640
Measter.

929
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:21,640
Oh my god, it's like this thing where the horse rescues

930
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:23,640
Aragorn.

931
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:27,640
They're just copying the other movies now.

932
00:42:29,640 --> 00:42:31,640
I hate this fucking show.

933
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:35,640
Yes, it would have saved all of us

934
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:37,640
a lot of television.

935
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:39,640
Yes, let's just walk into the queen's tent.

936
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:41,640
I'm sure there's no guards here or anything.

937
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:43,640
Yep, just...

938
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:45,640
It's fine.

939
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:47,640
Just straight in.

940
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:49,640
With your sword and all.

941
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:51,640
I don't think that's the queen's tent.

942
00:42:51,640 --> 00:42:53,640
Yeah.

943
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:55,640
That's a fancy looking hospital tent.

944
00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:57,640
Mummy?

945
00:42:57,640 --> 00:42:59,640
Not mummy.

946
00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:01,640
Mummy.

947
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:03,640
Oh, was I right?

948
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:05,640
Is she gone?

949
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:07,640
That's got to be a fake out.

950
00:43:09,640 --> 00:43:11,640
It's got to be a stranger.

951
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:13,640
Yep.

952
00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:15,640
But they already did that though.

953
00:43:15,640 --> 00:43:17,640
She's going to show up in three, two...

954
00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:19,640
I kind of hope she's dead.

955
00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:21,640
Yep, there you go.

956
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:23,640
I'm so good at calling this shit, Arch.

957
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:25,640
You knew it.

958
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:27,640
I'm the best one now.

959
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:29,640
I hate you, Cib.

960
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:31,640
I repeat my previous statement.

961
00:43:31,640 --> 00:43:33,640
More people need to die in this show.

962
00:43:33,640 --> 00:43:35,640
Yeah, was anyone thinking,

963
00:43:35,640 --> 00:43:37,640
like, oh god, I hope they don't kill her.

964
00:43:37,640 --> 00:43:39,640
She was so integral.

965
00:43:39,640 --> 00:43:41,640
Oh no, you're alive too.

966
00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:47,640
You guys have like no ash on you either.

967
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:49,640
Like, you're just completely fine.

968
00:43:49,640 --> 00:43:51,640
I mean, I assume they just put some on him.

969
00:43:51,640 --> 00:43:53,640
They've had days to wipe off their face.

970
00:43:53,640 --> 00:43:55,640
You know what I like the most?

971
00:43:55,640 --> 00:43:57,640
It's the fact that his hair is still short and cropped.

972
00:43:57,640 --> 00:43:59,640
Like, it's been...

973
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:01,640
fucking weeks now.

974
00:44:01,640 --> 00:44:05,640
It feels like this show is just written by an algorithm.

975
00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:07,640
It kind of does.

976
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:13,640
Ah, yes. Keep writing.

977
00:44:13,640 --> 00:44:15,640
None will... None need... No!

978
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:17,640
Puts on a fucking blindfold.

979
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:19,640
Just in case people didn't know.

980
00:44:21,640 --> 00:44:23,640
Ah, like it's...

981
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:25,640
It's the lack of attention to detail that pisses me off so much.

982
00:44:25,640 --> 00:44:27,640
Because, yeah, okay.

983
00:44:27,640 --> 00:44:29,640
It makes sense that the queen would be strong,

984
00:44:29,640 --> 00:44:31,640
with her weakness, you know, keeping morale up.

985
00:44:31,640 --> 00:44:35,640
Then the moment she's back to camp, now tie a blindfold on me so everyone will know.

986
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:39,640
Maybe she can touch her and make her feel better.

987
00:44:39,640 --> 00:44:41,640
Oh, a gentle push ought to do that.

988
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:43,640
Ha ha!

989
00:44:43,640 --> 00:44:45,640
Do not spend your pity on me, El.

990
00:44:47,640 --> 00:44:49,640
Save it.

991
00:44:49,640 --> 00:44:51,640
For our enemies.

992
00:44:51,640 --> 00:44:53,640
Why should she pity her enemies?

993
00:44:53,640 --> 00:44:55,640
For they do not know what they have begun.

994
00:44:55,640 --> 00:44:59,640
Oh my Jesus, are we actually doing the Jesus... We are doing the Jesus thing.

995
00:45:01,640 --> 00:45:03,640
She's like, I want revenge.

996
00:45:03,640 --> 00:45:07,640
Like, they're talking as if they've fought some kind of great battle here and been defeated.

997
00:45:07,640 --> 00:45:09,640
Like, none of this has happened.

998
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:11,640
A mountain blew up.

999
00:45:11,640 --> 00:45:13,640
Like, are you going to fight the mountain?

1000
00:45:13,640 --> 00:45:15,640
This scene is so random. Oh my God.

1001
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:21,640
Captain, I'm doubting and having second doubts. Oh!

1002
00:45:21,640 --> 00:45:23,640
Like, you know how you...

1003
00:45:23,640 --> 00:45:27,640
You know how you get the AI music that sounds pretty good, but just slightly off?

1004
00:45:27,640 --> 00:45:29,640
You get, like, AI pictures and artwork now?

1005
00:45:29,640 --> 00:45:35,640
Even the big boob AI woman that Sargon has been posting, there's just something slightly off, but it's like 99...

1006
00:45:35,640 --> 00:45:37,640
Yeah, it's like 99% good.

1007
00:45:37,640 --> 00:45:39,640
That's what this show feels like.

1008
00:45:39,640 --> 00:45:45,640
It's like all the moments, all the story beats, all, like, the five-second waits for something to happen.

1009
00:45:45,640 --> 00:45:47,640
It's all so predictable.

1010
00:45:47,640 --> 00:45:49,640
It feels like a computer wrote it.

1011
00:45:49,640 --> 00:45:51,640
It's soulless.

1012
00:45:51,640 --> 00:45:53,640
Is that all you think we have left in us?

1013
00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:55,640
We're horror foots.

1014
00:45:55,640 --> 00:45:57,640
Yeah.

1015
00:45:57,640 --> 00:45:59,640
Yeah, that means we're really, like, self-adventurous.

1016
00:45:59,640 --> 00:46:01,640
No, it doesn't.

1017
00:46:01,640 --> 00:46:03,640
The horror foots go to war.

1018
00:46:03,640 --> 00:46:05,640
Okay, listen here.

1019
00:46:05,640 --> 00:46:09,640
The horror foots will leave people behind if they've got a fucked up ankle.

1020
00:46:09,640 --> 00:46:13,640
They will leave them to die if they can't walk along with their...

1021
00:46:13,640 --> 00:46:15,640
They won't be able to put them on the cart.

1022
00:46:15,640 --> 00:46:17,640
And now it's like, we're horror foots.

1023
00:46:17,640 --> 00:46:21,640
That means we're really tough and could survive having our entire civilization burned to the ground.

1024
00:46:21,640 --> 00:46:23,640
No, you're dead.

1025
00:46:23,640 --> 00:46:25,640
All of you, dead.

1026
00:46:25,640 --> 00:46:27,640
Starved to death.

1027
00:46:27,640 --> 00:46:29,640
Now.

1028
00:46:29,640 --> 00:46:31,640
This is such bullshit.

1029
00:46:31,640 --> 00:46:33,640
They were literally ready to leave this fucking behind because he twisted his ankle.

1030
00:46:33,640 --> 00:46:35,640
Mhm.

1031
00:46:35,640 --> 00:46:37,640
I hate this fucking thing.

1032
00:46:37,640 --> 00:46:39,640
Well, like I said.

1033
00:46:39,640 --> 00:46:41,640
Or like Dev said, it's an algorithm.

1034
00:46:41,640 --> 00:46:43,640
Like, this whole thing is just...

1035
00:46:43,640 --> 00:46:45,640
Literally, it's like, now the horror foots are down on their luck.

1036
00:46:45,640 --> 00:46:47,640
So now somebody has to be like, we can do this.

1037
00:46:47,640 --> 00:46:49,640
And then everyone goes like, yeah.

1038
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:51,640
Yeah.

1039
00:46:51,640 --> 00:46:53,640
Yeah, you actually can do it.

1040
00:46:53,640 --> 00:46:55,640
The horror friendship.

1041
00:46:55,640 --> 00:46:57,640
Arch, I feel like today, more than any other day,

1042
00:46:57,640 --> 00:46:59,640
you're really anti this show.

1043
00:46:59,640 --> 00:47:01,640
Like, the hatred of this show.

1044
00:47:01,640 --> 00:47:03,640
Yeah.

1045
00:47:03,640 --> 00:47:05,640
Like, the hatred's flowing today.

1046
00:47:05,640 --> 00:47:07,640
Caught him on a bad day.

1047
00:47:07,640 --> 00:47:09,640
The thing is, like,

1048
00:47:09,640 --> 00:47:11,640
so much of this has just been boring

1049
00:47:11,640 --> 00:47:13,640
and stupid, but

1050
00:47:13,640 --> 00:47:15,640
now the story beats

1051
00:47:15,640 --> 00:47:17,640
are coming together and I'm finally realizing

1052
00:47:17,640 --> 00:47:19,640
I really hate the story.

1053
00:47:19,640 --> 00:47:21,640
Well, yeah, because initially it was like,

1054
00:47:21,640 --> 00:47:23,640
well, maybe they'll pull it off.

1055
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:25,640
Maybe they'll go in an interesting direction.

1056
00:47:25,640 --> 00:47:27,640
And now it's like, well,

1057
00:47:27,640 --> 00:47:29,640
no, they're not.

1058
00:47:29,640 --> 00:47:31,640
Not without us.

1059
00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:33,640
Not without us.

1060
00:47:33,640 --> 00:47:35,640
Ah, fuck, god, kill me now.

1061
00:47:35,640 --> 00:47:37,640
Shoot me.

1062
00:47:37,640 --> 00:47:39,640
It's time for us to go to heaven.

1063
00:47:45,640 --> 00:47:49,640
I'm a trained finder, what you go with them looks a brown person.

1064
00:47:49,640 --> 00:47:51,640
Me?

1065
00:47:51,640 --> 00:47:53,640
Listen, you're an expensive actor.

1066
00:47:53,640 --> 00:47:55,640
We're using you.

1067
00:47:55,640 --> 00:47:57,640
Oh.

1068
00:48:01,640 --> 00:48:03,640
I work right all the time.

1069
00:48:05,640 --> 00:48:07,640
I'll fetch provisions and get me stick.

1070
00:48:07,640 --> 00:48:09,640
I'm coming with you.

1071
00:48:11,640 --> 00:48:13,640
It's a good stick.

1072
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:15,640
I hate all of you.

1073
00:48:15,640 --> 00:48:17,640
I hope so.

1074
00:48:17,640 --> 00:48:19,640
So, I recently read an article

1075
00:48:19,640 --> 00:48:21,640
where someone was complaining that

1076
00:48:21,640 --> 00:48:23,640
all of the Harfoot stuff was racist

1077
00:48:23,640 --> 00:48:25,640
because they all do really bad

1078
00:48:25,640 --> 00:48:27,640
Irish accents.

1079
00:48:27,640 --> 00:48:29,640
Does that look like a painting in the background?

1080
00:48:29,640 --> 00:48:31,640
The backdrop looks flat.

1081
00:48:31,640 --> 00:48:33,640
I agree.

1082
00:48:33,640 --> 00:48:35,640
I, too, am decidedly racist

1083
00:48:35,640 --> 00:48:37,640
against the Irish, and I fucking hate the Harfoots.

1084
00:48:37,640 --> 00:48:39,640
Oh my god,

1085
00:48:39,640 --> 00:48:41,640
Queen, if you wanted to keep morale up,

1086
00:48:41,640 --> 00:48:43,640
like... No, that was earlier.

1087
00:48:43,640 --> 00:48:45,640
It's different.

1088
00:48:45,640 --> 00:48:47,640
It's different now.

1089
00:48:47,640 --> 00:48:49,640
Also, they've only got one ship.

1090
00:48:49,640 --> 00:48:51,640
I guess they left the other two behind.

1091
00:48:55,640 --> 00:48:57,640
Is yester-eve a word?

1092
00:48:59,640 --> 00:49:01,640
No.

1093
00:49:01,640 --> 00:49:03,640
No.

1094
00:49:03,640 --> 00:49:05,640
Convenient.

1095
00:49:05,640 --> 00:49:07,640
He can't ride.

1096
00:49:07,640 --> 00:49:09,640
He's gonna.

1097
00:49:09,640 --> 00:49:11,640
A vast gash on the side.

1098
00:49:11,640 --> 00:49:13,640
Like, his insides are

1099
00:49:13,640 --> 00:49:15,640
about to be his outsides, and you're gonna

1100
00:49:15,640 --> 00:49:17,640
put him on a horse.

1101
00:49:17,640 --> 00:49:19,640
You gotta shake it out of him, Arch.

1102
00:49:21,640 --> 00:49:23,640
I also love how...

1103
00:49:23,640 --> 00:49:25,640
One episode ago,

1104
00:49:25,640 --> 00:49:27,640
he was like, I don't want to go home.

1105
00:49:27,640 --> 00:49:29,640
Now he's like, I will not abandon them

1106
00:49:29,640 --> 00:49:31,640
to a mere volcanic explosion.

1107
00:49:31,640 --> 00:49:33,640
Like, I'm a king now.

1108
00:49:33,640 --> 00:49:35,640
And my people need me.

1109
00:49:35,640 --> 00:49:37,640
You know, that is strange

1110
00:49:37,640 --> 00:49:39,640
that he was, like, laying in bed looking like he was

1111
00:49:39,640 --> 00:49:41,640
about to die at Death's Door.

1112
00:49:41,640 --> 00:49:43,640
And now he's... he's walking.

1113
00:49:43,640 --> 00:49:45,640
I'm actually okay.

1114
00:49:45,640 --> 00:49:47,640
Thanks for the pep talk, guys.

1115
00:49:47,640 --> 00:49:49,640
Yeah. You see, wait.

1116
00:49:49,640 --> 00:49:51,640
I thought they were gonna, like, get him ready for

1117
00:49:51,640 --> 00:49:53,640
travel. He's like, I guess I'll just fucking go.

1118
00:49:53,640 --> 00:49:55,640
Alright. Can you ride? No?

1119
00:49:55,640 --> 00:49:57,640
Yeah.

1120
00:49:57,640 --> 00:49:59,640
Like, he's... this wound needs

1121
00:49:59,640 --> 00:50:01,640
11 medicine or he'll die.

1122
00:50:01,640 --> 00:50:03,640
Okay. Well, I guess he can ride, then.

1123
00:50:07,640 --> 00:50:09,640
Thank you.

1124
00:50:09,640 --> 00:50:11,640
Thank you. This is an enormously

1125
00:50:11,640 --> 00:50:13,640
precious 11 heirloom.

1126
00:50:13,640 --> 00:50:15,640
Thank you very much.

1127
00:50:15,640 --> 00:50:17,640
Goes to the next merchant.

1128
00:50:17,640 --> 00:50:19,640
He's like, oh, you just sold it for me.

1129
00:50:19,640 --> 00:50:21,640
He's like, yeah.

1130
00:50:21,640 --> 00:50:23,640
He'll probably get a good price for it, though.

1131
00:50:23,640 --> 00:50:25,640
Southland power.

1132
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:35,640
Oh, they start out at a gallop right away.

1133
00:50:35,640 --> 00:50:37,640
Don't trot or anything to take it easy

1134
00:50:37,640 --> 00:50:39,640
on his wound. Just go on.

1135
00:50:39,640 --> 00:50:41,640
These scenes aren't realism.

1136
00:50:41,640 --> 00:50:43,640
They're shot for symbolism.

1137
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:45,640
I fucking hate this show so much.

1138
00:50:45,640 --> 00:50:47,640
Like, now that the story's

1139
00:50:47,640 --> 00:50:49,640
actually come into its own, I fucking

1140
00:50:49,640 --> 00:50:51,640
realize how much I dislike it all.

1141
00:50:51,640 --> 00:50:53,640
Oh, dude.

1142
00:50:53,640 --> 00:50:55,640
Lilith, you mentioned the Sargon faces earlier.

1143
00:50:55,640 --> 00:50:57,640
They're like... they're like Pogchamp Sargons.

1144
00:50:59,640 --> 00:51:01,640
Should be an emote.

1145
00:51:01,640 --> 00:51:03,640
On the server.

1146
00:51:03,640 --> 00:51:05,640
It's your father's.

1147
00:51:05,640 --> 00:51:07,640
Yeah, it's your dad. Go fucking kill him.

1148
00:51:07,640 --> 00:51:09,640
Now.

1149
00:51:09,640 --> 00:51:11,640
Too suspicious.

1150
00:51:11,640 --> 00:51:13,640
His mind too feeble.

1151
00:51:13,640 --> 00:51:15,640
Kill him.

1152
00:51:15,640 --> 00:51:17,640
You should kill him.

1153
00:51:17,640 --> 00:51:19,640
Too many crests he hurls to the floor.

1154
00:51:21,640 --> 00:51:23,640
One day this will be your king.

1155
00:51:23,640 --> 00:51:25,640
You're the real one.

1156
00:51:25,640 --> 00:51:27,640
Oh my gosh, she's Lady McFeth-ing him.

1157
00:51:27,640 --> 00:51:29,640
Wait. Arch.

1158
00:51:29,640 --> 00:51:31,640
Make the racist comment we all know you want to make.

1159
00:51:31,640 --> 00:51:33,640
Go.

1160
00:51:33,640 --> 00:51:35,640
Goddammit, you're putting me on the spot.

1161
00:51:35,640 --> 00:51:37,640
What am I supposed to say?

1162
00:51:37,640 --> 00:51:39,640
Is it a black joke?

1163
00:51:39,640 --> 00:51:41,640
Is it a Jew joke?

1164
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:43,640
Arch, it's the only thing you ever do

1165
00:51:43,640 --> 00:51:45,640
which is black jokes. Come on.

1166
00:51:45,640 --> 00:51:49,640
Yeah, but I don't see how this relates to her being black.

1167
00:51:49,640 --> 00:51:51,640
You'll find a way.

1168
00:51:51,640 --> 00:51:53,640
No, I'm leaning more towards Jewish right now.

1169
00:51:55,640 --> 00:51:57,640
You're so temperamental with your racism.

1170
00:52:01,640 --> 00:52:03,640
I'm going to dig.

1171
00:52:03,640 --> 00:52:05,640
Black people don't dig.

1172
00:52:05,640 --> 00:52:09,640
Arch, she's just a black Israelite, okay?

1173
00:52:09,640 --> 00:52:11,640
Look, he figured it out.

1174
00:52:11,640 --> 00:52:13,640
Good job Arch, come on.

1175
00:52:13,640 --> 00:52:15,640
Fucking hell.

1176
00:52:17,640 --> 00:52:19,640
I don't care how many dwarves have lost me.

1177
00:52:19,640 --> 00:52:21,640
If the whole room's looking at Arch, it's going to be like,

1178
00:52:21,640 --> 00:52:23,640
say the line, Arch.

1179
00:52:23,640 --> 00:52:25,640
Yeah, basically.

1180
00:52:25,640 --> 00:52:27,640
See, my racism is very organic, okay?

1181
00:52:27,640 --> 00:52:29,640
I can't just turn it on and off like that.

1182
00:52:31,640 --> 00:52:33,640
Are we going to see the balrog?

1183
00:52:33,640 --> 00:52:35,640
Is the balrog going to burn the leaf?

1184
00:52:35,640 --> 00:52:37,640
Come on, balrog.

1185
00:52:37,640 --> 00:52:39,640
Come on, balrog.

1186
00:52:39,640 --> 00:52:41,640
I know you're in there.

1187
00:52:41,640 --> 00:52:43,640
Come on, balrog.

1188
00:52:43,640 --> 00:52:45,640
Where the fuck is it going?

1189
00:52:45,640 --> 00:52:47,640
It's going where the balrog is.

1190
00:52:47,640 --> 00:52:49,640
Dude, it's glowing.

1191
00:52:49,640 --> 00:52:51,640
Yes, step on it.

1192
00:52:51,640 --> 00:52:53,640
No!

1193
00:52:57,640 --> 00:52:59,640
It's a leaf!

1194
00:52:59,640 --> 00:53:01,640
It's the balrog!

1195
00:53:03,640 --> 00:53:05,640
At the end of the day,

1196
00:53:05,640 --> 00:53:07,640
it wasn't Durin who digged deep

1197
00:53:07,640 --> 00:53:09,640
and greatly, it was that cunt who threw

1198
00:53:09,640 --> 00:53:11,640
a leaf in there and woke him.

1199
00:53:11,640 --> 00:53:13,640
Yep.

1200
00:53:13,640 --> 00:53:15,640
Hills that you should not litter.

1201
00:53:15,640 --> 00:53:17,640
Hey, what do you think happened

1202
00:53:17,640 --> 00:53:19,640
to the old man who opened the dam?

1203
00:53:19,640 --> 00:53:21,640
Is he just dead?

1204
00:53:21,640 --> 00:53:23,640
He's right there, dead.

1205
00:53:23,640 --> 00:53:25,640
Is that him?

1206
00:53:25,640 --> 00:53:27,640
Oh my fuck, I can't tell, it's all ashy.

1207
00:53:31,640 --> 00:53:33,640
Oh, he named Mordor.

1208
00:53:33,640 --> 00:53:35,640
Mordor.

1209
00:53:37,640 --> 00:53:39,640
Ah, Birmingham.

1210
00:53:45,640 --> 00:53:47,640
They call it Adar?

1211
00:53:53,640 --> 00:53:55,640
The Southland under race, is it?

1212
00:53:57,640 --> 00:53:59,640
Yep.

1213
00:53:59,640 --> 00:54:01,640
Oh my god!

1214
00:54:03,640 --> 00:54:05,640
Okay, they should have

1215
00:54:05,640 --> 00:54:07,640
had someone say that.

1216
00:54:07,640 --> 00:54:09,640
That should have been a line.

1217
00:54:09,640 --> 00:54:11,640
Yeah, but it would have come out of nowhere.

1218
00:54:11,640 --> 00:54:13,640
Like, what would that even be the lead up?

1219
00:54:13,640 --> 00:54:15,640
Like, what are we going to name it? Hold on.

1220
00:54:15,640 --> 00:54:17,640
Mordor. What does that mean?

1221
00:54:17,640 --> 00:54:19,640
No, well, but...

1222
00:54:19,640 --> 00:54:21,640
They could have also just left

1223
00:54:21,640 --> 00:54:23,640
it without, and then like,

1224
00:54:23,640 --> 00:54:25,640
weighed it a little bit.

1225
00:54:25,640 --> 00:54:27,640
Also, wait, why was it called the eye?

1226
00:54:27,640 --> 00:54:29,640
I was half expecting

1227
00:54:29,640 --> 00:54:31,640
the Southlands to get

1228
00:54:31,640 --> 00:54:33,640
Wait, wait, Kibbs, shut it up.

1229
00:54:33,640 --> 00:54:35,640
Kibbs, figure it out.

1230
00:54:35,640 --> 00:54:37,640
Shut up, Kibbs.

1231
00:54:37,640 --> 00:54:39,640
We're on the opening of the episode right here.

1232
00:54:39,640 --> 00:54:41,640
Wow, when fucking Galadriel

1233
00:54:41,640 --> 00:54:43,640
is like opening her eyes and being like

1234
00:54:43,640 --> 00:54:45,640
Darth Vader.

1235
00:54:45,640 --> 00:54:47,640
We could also extend the list to the fact that Mordor

1236
00:54:47,640 --> 00:54:49,640
is a thing, but that's not really

1237
00:54:49,640 --> 00:54:51,640
related directly to Sauron, because it would require

1238
00:54:51,640 --> 00:54:53,640
the tower, and the tower takes thousands of years to build.

1239
00:54:53,640 --> 00:54:55,640
Yep, yep, yep.

1240
00:54:55,640 --> 00:54:57,640
They're obviously appealing to that, right?

1241
00:54:57,640 --> 00:54:59,640
And also, what's her name lost her eyes?

1242
00:54:59,640 --> 00:55:01,640
There's that.

1243
00:55:01,640 --> 00:55:03,640
Oh, too many eyes.

1244
00:55:03,640 --> 00:55:05,640
But,

1245
00:55:05,640 --> 00:55:07,640
what would have been

1246
00:55:07,640 --> 00:55:09,640
far, far better.

1247
00:55:09,640 --> 00:55:11,640
Just name the episode Mordor.

1248
00:55:11,640 --> 00:55:13,640
Okay, that sucks, but name it Mordor.

1249
00:55:13,640 --> 00:55:15,640
And then just end on that

1250
00:55:15,640 --> 00:55:17,640
exact scene. What do we name it?

1251
00:55:17,640 --> 00:55:19,640
But then don't show that lame

1252
00:55:19,640 --> 00:55:21,640
thing where the word Mordor

1253
00:55:21,640 --> 00:55:23,640
fades in. Don't show that.

1254
00:55:23,640 --> 00:55:25,640
Almost anything else.

1255
00:55:25,640 --> 00:55:27,640
If you just name the episode Mordor

1256
00:55:27,640 --> 00:55:29,640
and then end it on

1257
00:55:29,640 --> 00:55:31,640
what do we name the new land?

1258
00:55:31,640 --> 00:55:33,640
And then have it like a long fade out.

1259
00:55:33,640 --> 00:55:35,640
It would work, it would actually work.

1260
00:55:35,640 --> 00:55:37,640
It's like so desperate to be like, guys, you know

1261
00:55:37,640 --> 00:55:39,640
Mordor, you know the thing.

1262
00:55:39,640 --> 00:55:41,640
The thing, by the way, guys.

1263
00:55:41,640 --> 00:55:43,640
Yeah, exactly. Nailed it on the head with that.

1264
00:55:43,640 --> 00:55:45,640
Ugh.

1265
00:55:45,640 --> 00:55:47,640
It's painful.

1266
00:55:47,640 --> 00:55:49,640
But it's because it doesn't

1267
00:55:49,640 --> 00:55:51,640
speak for itself, right?

1268
00:55:51,640 --> 00:55:53,640
Everything about this show has been,

1269
00:55:53,640 --> 00:55:55,640
remember when the movies did this?

1270
00:55:55,640 --> 00:55:57,640
Yes. It's very

1271
00:55:57,640 --> 00:55:59,640
referential, and that's the issue.

1272
00:55:59,640 --> 00:56:01,640
The thing that you guys like, right?

1273
00:56:01,640 --> 00:56:03,640
Yeah. It's the I member berries.

1274
00:56:03,640 --> 00:56:05,640
It's like, remember guys? Remember when

1275
00:56:05,640 --> 00:56:07,640
Photobag, I just went on a vid,

1276
00:56:07,640 --> 00:56:09,640
I member. It's like, okay.

1277
00:56:11,640 --> 00:56:13,640
Fuck.

1278
00:56:13,640 --> 00:56:15,640
Fuck.

1279
00:56:15,640 --> 00:56:17,640
Okay.

1280
00:56:17,640 --> 00:56:19,640
This is exactly it though.

1281
00:56:19,640 --> 00:56:21,640
Up until this point, we've been watching this show

1282
00:56:21,640 --> 00:56:23,640
and mostly it's just

1283
00:56:23,640 --> 00:56:25,640
the scene boring.

1284
00:56:25,640 --> 00:56:27,640
And occasionally there's been a scene which Dev,

1285
00:56:27,640 --> 00:56:29,640
the simp, has gone like, this isn't too bad,

1286
00:56:29,640 --> 00:56:31,640
and everyone else has yelled at him.

1287
00:56:31,640 --> 00:56:33,640
But this, finally now,

1288
00:56:33,640 --> 00:56:35,640
after seven hours,

1289
00:56:35,640 --> 00:56:37,640
the story has

1290
00:56:37,640 --> 00:56:39,640
culminated,

1291
00:56:39,640 --> 00:56:41,640
and I realize I hate the story.

1292
00:56:41,640 --> 00:56:43,640
Like, that's literally what we've

1293
00:56:43,640 --> 00:56:45,640
arrived at here. The story has finally

1294
00:56:45,640 --> 00:56:47,640
arrived, and I wish it would never have.

1295
00:56:49,640 --> 00:56:51,640
You wish you'd just be dicking around with

1296
00:56:51,640 --> 00:56:53,640
what's bumbling in the forest for

1297
00:56:53,640 --> 00:56:55,640
a full, you know,

1298
00:56:55,640 --> 00:56:57,640
eight or nine or ten episodes.

1299
00:56:57,640 --> 00:56:59,640
At least they're not gonna let you in.

1300
00:56:59,640 --> 00:57:01,640
It's like mystery box storytelling, right?

1301
00:57:01,640 --> 00:57:03,640
Where they're like, what could this be?

1302
00:57:03,640 --> 00:57:05,640
It could be really interesting.

1303
00:57:05,640 --> 00:57:07,640
And, like, as long as you don't know what it is,

1304
00:57:07,640 --> 00:57:09,640
it's like, sure, it could be interesting.

1305
00:57:09,640 --> 00:57:11,640
And then you know what it is, and it's like, oh.

1306
00:57:11,640 --> 00:57:13,640
Well, the problem is though,

1307
00:57:13,640 --> 00:57:15,640
the problem is though, we know what it is

1308
00:57:15,640 --> 00:57:17,640
because this is a prequel.

1309
00:57:17,640 --> 00:57:19,640
There's no mystery boxes in a prequel.

1310
00:57:19,640 --> 00:57:21,640
I mean, like, the sword.

1311
00:57:21,640 --> 00:57:23,640
Like, we didn't know what it was, and then it's like, oh, it's a key.

1312
00:57:23,640 --> 00:57:25,640
And it's like, oh.

1313
00:57:25,640 --> 00:57:27,640
Yeah, but like, all the important mystery boxes,

1314
00:57:27,640 --> 00:57:29,640
like, oh, we get it. It's obviously Mithril, right?

1315
00:57:29,640 --> 00:57:31,640
Or it's obviously Mount Doom.

1316
00:57:31,640 --> 00:57:33,640
Or it's obviously Creation of Mortals. Like, oh, okay.

1317
00:57:33,640 --> 00:57:35,640
Then they make shit up.

1318
00:57:35,640 --> 00:57:37,640
Where now Mithril is magical

1319
00:57:37,640 --> 00:57:39,640
crack rock that saves the elves.

1320
00:57:39,640 --> 00:57:41,640
It's so dumb. I hate it so much.

1321
00:57:43,640 --> 00:57:45,640
Arch.

1322
00:57:45,640 --> 00:57:47,640
Hold on, Dev. Same issue with, like,

1323
00:57:47,640 --> 00:57:49,640
prequels, right? Because they're trying to,

1324
00:57:49,640 --> 00:57:51,640
like, why did you want to watch the prequels?

1325
00:57:51,640 --> 00:57:53,640
It was to figure out who Darth Vader was before he became

1326
00:57:53,640 --> 00:57:55,640
Darth Vader, you know? How did he become that way?

1327
00:57:55,640 --> 00:57:57,640
There was a mystery still

1328
00:57:57,640 --> 00:57:59,640
that needed solving. We knew

1329
00:57:59,640 --> 00:58:01,640
the result, but we didn't know how we got there.

1330
00:58:01,640 --> 00:58:03,640
This doesn't really have

1331
00:58:03,640 --> 00:58:05,640
that, does it?

1332
00:58:05,640 --> 00:58:07,640
No, because it doesn't explain how you

1333
00:58:07,640 --> 00:58:09,640
got there. It makes shit up.

1334
00:58:09,640 --> 00:58:11,640
Yeah, exactly.

1335
00:58:11,640 --> 00:58:13,640
None of it's canon, anyway.

1336
00:58:13,640 --> 00:58:15,640
Like, okay, well, how did the dwarves delve too deep

1337
00:58:15,640 --> 00:58:17,640
and too greedily? Well, you see,

1338
00:58:17,640 --> 00:58:19,640
an old man threw a leaf down a hole

1339
00:58:19,640 --> 00:58:21,640
and the bad rug was like, LEAF.

1340
00:58:23,640 --> 00:58:25,640
Oh, I'm gonna kill dwarves

1341
00:58:25,640 --> 00:58:27,640
now.

1342
00:58:27,640 --> 00:58:29,640
How was Mount Doom created? Well, an old dude

1343
00:58:29,640 --> 00:58:31,640
put a sword in a rock and it

1344
00:58:31,640 --> 00:58:33,640
made water and shit. Like,

1345
00:58:33,640 --> 00:58:35,640
the thing is, if you're gonna do a prequel- So why did he go

1346
00:58:35,640 --> 00:58:37,640
all the way to the hole

1347
00:58:37,640 --> 00:58:39,640
just to throw the leaf

1348
00:58:39,640 --> 00:58:41,640
down?

1349
00:58:41,640 --> 00:58:43,640
Yeah, I don't know. I've talked about this when it comes to

1350
00:58:43,640 --> 00:58:45,640
40k. Was there no garbage can?

1351
00:58:45,640 --> 00:58:47,640
40k did his own

1352
00:58:47,640 --> 00:58:49,640
whole prequel thing with the Horus Heresy.

1353
00:58:49,640 --> 00:58:51,640
The way you do a prequel

1354
00:58:51,640 --> 00:58:53,640
well is when you add

1355
00:58:53,640 --> 00:58:55,640
to the story, when you build

1356
00:58:55,640 --> 00:58:57,640
to it, when you add value

1357
00:58:57,640 --> 00:58:59,640
to the story. Like,

1358
00:58:59,640 --> 00:59:01,640
when a character- like with

1359
00:59:01,640 --> 00:59:03,640
Darth Vader is actually a pretty good example.

1360
00:59:03,640 --> 00:59:05,640
They added value to him by

1361
00:59:05,640 --> 00:59:07,640
showing his fall. They added

1362
00:59:07,640 --> 00:59:09,640
depth to him. But here, all they're

1363
00:59:09,640 --> 00:59:11,640
doing is subtracting.

1364
00:59:11,640 --> 00:59:13,640
Thus, knowing that Mount Doom was created by an

1365
00:59:13,640 --> 00:59:15,640
old fart who stuck a stick in a rock

1366
00:59:15,640 --> 00:59:17,640
doesn't add to Mount Doom.

1367
00:59:17,640 --> 00:59:19,640
It subtracts from it. It's no longer

1368
00:59:19,640 --> 00:59:21,640
a mountain volcano

1369
00:59:21,640 --> 00:59:23,640
created by Satan.

1370
00:59:23,640 --> 00:59:25,640
It's a rando thing built by some rando

1371
00:59:25,640 --> 00:59:27,640
to create ash so he could live with his orcs

1372
00:59:27,640 --> 00:59:29,640
friends there.

1373
00:59:29,640 --> 00:59:31,640
His orc friends. Aww, that's kind of endearing

1374
00:59:31,640 --> 00:59:33,640
me, by the way. They're also

1375
00:59:33,640 --> 00:59:35,640
subtracting from Amazon's bank account

1376
00:59:35,640 --> 00:59:37,640
by trying to make this show.

1377
00:59:37,640 --> 00:59:39,640
And it's not working out.

1378
00:59:39,640 --> 00:59:41,640
The fall of duty.

1379
00:59:41,640 --> 00:59:43,640
Think of what an amazing

1380
00:59:43,640 --> 00:59:45,640
story it could be.

1381
00:59:45,640 --> 00:59:47,640
It's not a question of helping the elves.

1382
00:59:47,640 --> 00:59:49,640
It's simply the dwarves digging deep

1383
00:59:49,640 --> 00:59:51,640
and greedily for their own greed's

1384
00:59:51,640 --> 00:59:53,640
sake. No, that's not it at all.

1385
00:59:53,640 --> 00:59:55,640
It's a fucking leaf.

1386
00:59:55,640 --> 00:59:57,640
It's an old person.

1387
00:59:57,640 --> 00:59:59,640
That's an interesting insight into greed

1388
00:59:59,640 --> 01:00:01,640
and the nature of

1389
01:00:01,640 --> 01:00:03,640
pushing yourself too hard for

1390
01:00:03,640 --> 01:00:05,640
just want.

1391
01:00:05,640 --> 01:00:07,640
The issue is

1392
01:00:07,640 --> 01:00:09,640
that entire story is supposed

1393
01:00:09,640 --> 01:00:11,640
to be a story of greed, right?

1394
01:00:11,640 --> 01:00:13,640
How they continuously justify

1395
01:00:13,640 --> 01:00:15,640
it. Like, they know this is dangerous

1396
01:00:15,640 --> 01:00:17,640
but we just want a little bit more gold.

1397
01:00:17,640 --> 01:00:19,640
Instead, they've subtracted

1398
01:00:19,640 --> 01:00:21,640
that and now if they don't dig,

1399
01:00:21,640 --> 01:00:23,640
all of the elves just fucking die.

1400
01:00:23,640 --> 01:00:25,640
Like, it's no longer greed. It's altruism.

1401
01:00:25,640 --> 01:00:27,640
I do like how, as usual,

1402
01:00:27,640 --> 01:00:29,640
it's a fucking leaf that

1403
01:00:29,640 --> 01:00:31,640
ruins everything.

1404
01:00:31,640 --> 01:00:33,640
Yep. We have the rags soon, Dev.

1405
01:00:33,640 --> 01:00:35,640
In real life.

1406
01:00:35,640 --> 01:00:37,640
Oh god.

1407
01:00:37,640 --> 01:00:39,640
I mean, there's the usual stuff of

1408
01:00:39,640 --> 01:00:41,640
every important character survives

1409
01:00:41,640 --> 01:00:43,640
a cataclysm, but

1410
01:00:43,640 --> 01:00:45,640
I mean, that's just normal movie logic.

1411
01:00:45,640 --> 01:00:47,640
I mean,

1412
01:00:47,640 --> 01:00:49,640
again, it's like not having the will

1413
01:00:49,640 --> 01:00:51,640
to actually have

1414
01:00:51,640 --> 01:00:53,640
your story beats make

1415
01:00:53,640 --> 01:00:55,640
sense or like, play out. Like, you're not

1416
01:00:55,640 --> 01:00:57,640
really committing to them. No one really dies.

1417
01:00:57,640 --> 01:00:59,640
No one important happens.

1418
01:00:59,640 --> 01:01:01,640
Like, okay.

1419
01:01:01,640 --> 01:01:03,640
Do the fucking stupid

1420
01:01:03,640 --> 01:01:05,640
running away from lava thing

1421
01:01:05,640 --> 01:01:07,640
where it's like, oh, the mountain's acting

1422
01:01:07,640 --> 01:01:09,640
weird. We must evacuate and then

1423
01:01:09,640 --> 01:01:11,640
have the mountain explode. The mountain explodes,

1424
01:01:11,640 --> 01:01:13,640
covers everything in the ash, burns everything

1425
01:01:13,640 --> 01:01:15,640
with a temperature high enough to

1426
01:01:15,640 --> 01:01:17,640
have wood spontaneously combust

1427
01:01:17,640 --> 01:01:19,640
yet there are still survivors.

1428
01:01:19,640 --> 01:01:21,640
You know what they could have done?

1429
01:01:21,640 --> 01:01:23,640
They could have actually done the exact

1430
01:01:23,640 --> 01:01:25,640
same story. They just

1431
01:01:25,640 --> 01:01:27,640
they could have, man,

1432
01:01:27,640 --> 01:01:29,640
I was just thinking of this.

1433
01:01:29,640 --> 01:01:31,640
They didn't need to make it so that you take the

1434
01:01:31,640 --> 01:01:33,640
sword and then put it in the keyhole and then

1435
01:01:33,640 --> 01:01:35,640
open the dam, which then floods all the

1436
01:01:35,640 --> 01:01:37,640
water down into the volcano and causes the volcano.

1437
01:01:37,640 --> 01:01:39,640
They could have just made it so that it was a

1438
01:01:39,640 --> 01:01:41,640
magic sword and a magic

1439
01:01:41,640 --> 01:01:43,640
keyhole that creates a magic volcano.

1440
01:01:43,640 --> 01:01:45,640
Yeah.

1441
01:01:45,640 --> 01:01:47,640
Magic. And it would have

1442
01:01:47,640 --> 01:01:49,640
worked a lot better. Like, yes, you

1443
01:01:49,640 --> 01:01:51,640
put the sword in, the ground starts rumbling,

1444
01:01:51,640 --> 01:01:53,640
you know, the sigil of Sauron appears

1445
01:01:53,640 --> 01:01:55,640
in the mountain and like the top blows off of it or something

1446
01:01:55,640 --> 01:01:57,640
like, you could, you could just make this

1447
01:01:57,640 --> 01:01:59,640
shit up. They're already making it up anyway.

1448
01:01:59,640 --> 01:02:01,640
They might as well make it up good.

1449
01:02:01,640 --> 01:02:03,640
No.

1450
01:02:05,640 --> 01:02:07,640
That's what they decided.

1451
01:02:07,640 --> 01:02:09,640
We are against the concept of quality

1452
01:02:09,640 --> 01:02:11,640
here at Amazon Studios.

1453
01:02:11,640 --> 01:02:13,640
We'll use an algorithm.

1454
01:02:13,640 --> 01:02:15,640
In any other show, I'd

1455
01:02:15,640 --> 01:02:17,640
call it a cop-out, but in a show like

1456
01:02:17,640 --> 01:02:19,640
this, where you are

1457
01:02:19,640 --> 01:02:21,640
in the time of legends and myth,

1458
01:02:21,640 --> 01:02:23,640
literally just make an artifact

1459
01:02:23,640 --> 01:02:25,640
of Morgoth and it's like when

1460
01:02:25,640 --> 01:02:27,640
this artifact is like placed upon the

1461
01:02:27,640 --> 01:02:29,640
thingamabob, like darkness will descend

1462
01:02:29,640 --> 01:02:31,640
upon the land and what does it mean?

1463
01:02:31,640 --> 01:02:33,640
And then you blow up Mount Doom.

1464
01:02:33,640 --> 01:02:35,640
Yeah, exactly.

1465
01:02:35,640 --> 01:02:37,640
Just pour water.

1466
01:02:37,640 --> 01:02:39,640
You could have like a legend

1467
01:02:39,640 --> 01:02:41,640
attached to it and the legend, yeah,

1468
01:02:41,640 --> 01:02:43,640
it says like, darkness will come to the land and no one knows what

1469
01:02:43,640 --> 01:02:45,640
it means and they're like, we have to make sure that

1470
01:02:45,640 --> 01:02:47,640
the enemy doesn't get it to the altar

1471
01:02:47,640 --> 01:02:49,640
and they have like a back and forth

1472
01:02:49,640 --> 01:02:51,640
over it and like it gets lost and then found

1473
01:02:51,640 --> 01:02:53,640
again and there's like a mad scramble for it.

1474
01:02:53,640 --> 01:02:55,640
And then the heroes fail right in

1475
01:02:55,640 --> 01:02:57,640
the last moment and then, you know, the

1476
01:02:57,640 --> 01:02:59,640
old man plunges it into the

1477
01:02:59,640 --> 01:03:01,640
into the altar and then the volcano

1478
01:03:01,640 --> 01:03:03,640
explodes. Like it could be a whole thing!

1479
01:03:03,640 --> 01:03:05,640
And I'll dev...

1480
01:03:05,640 --> 01:03:07,640
...water.

1481
01:03:07,640 --> 01:03:09,640
Don't do it.

1482
01:03:11,640 --> 01:03:13,640
It's just...

1483
01:03:13,640 --> 01:03:15,640
It is anti-Tolkean almost

1484
01:03:15,640 --> 01:03:17,640
every step of the way.

1485
01:03:17,640 --> 01:03:19,640
I hate the horse. I hate the horse

1486
01:03:19,640 --> 01:03:21,640
too. The horse walks

1487
01:03:21,640 --> 01:03:23,640
all the way back to camp.

1488
01:03:23,640 --> 01:03:25,640
But suddenly it's convenient.

1489
01:03:25,640 --> 01:03:27,640
It's like, the horse won't

1490
01:03:27,640 --> 01:03:29,640
listen to any of us. He walked all the way back

1491
01:03:29,640 --> 01:03:31,640
here though. Like, no, it won't listen.

1492
01:03:31,640 --> 01:03:33,640
Okay. And he takes off the bridle and the horse

1493
01:03:33,640 --> 01:03:35,640
goes, yes to!

1494
01:03:35,640 --> 01:03:37,640
And runs away.

1495
01:03:37,640 --> 01:03:39,640
It's gonna be the air form scene. Like, that's how it's gonna do it.

1496
01:03:39,640 --> 01:03:41,640
Like, he's gonna lick him awake, you know, and he's like, ugh.

1497
01:03:41,640 --> 01:03:43,640
Yeah, no, no, he's

1498
01:03:43,640 --> 01:03:45,640
gonna be lying there covered in ash

1499
01:03:45,640 --> 01:03:47,640
and you're gonna see the horse now just

1500
01:03:47,640 --> 01:03:49,640
hoof, hoof, hoof.

1501
01:03:49,640 --> 01:03:51,640
And then you're like, oh, horse, you came for me! Horse!

1502
01:03:51,640 --> 01:03:53,640
Two days later.

1503
01:03:53,640 --> 01:03:55,640
Me and his horse

1504
01:03:55,640 --> 01:03:57,640
and me and his best friend?

1505
01:03:57,640 --> 01:03:59,640
That's what the show's saying.

1506
01:03:59,640 --> 01:04:01,640
I hate it. And the

1507
01:04:01,640 --> 01:04:03,640
thing is too,

1508
01:04:03,640 --> 01:04:05,640
the reason why I hate it so much

1509
01:04:05,640 --> 01:04:07,640
is because this is just

1510
01:04:07,640 --> 01:04:09,640
a movie plotline.

1511
01:04:09,640 --> 01:04:11,640
That is all it is. The only reason,

1512
01:04:11,640 --> 01:04:13,640
like, we haven't seen him build any

1513
01:04:13,640 --> 01:04:15,640
relationship with this fucking horse.

1514
01:04:15,640 --> 01:04:17,640
Like, it's not like we saw him

1515
01:04:17,640 --> 01:04:19,640
carrying out his stable master duties

1516
01:04:19,640 --> 01:04:21,640
or pet the horse or like,

1517
01:04:21,640 --> 01:04:23,640
oh, you're a good horse, you're feeding cats

1518
01:04:23,640 --> 01:04:25,640
or anything, no. We saw one scene of that.

1519
01:04:25,640 --> 01:04:27,640
We saw one scene of that. Only one.

1520
01:04:27,640 --> 01:04:29,640
Yeah. No, not even that.

1521
01:04:29,640 --> 01:04:31,640
Like, that was his daddy coming over like,

1522
01:04:31,640 --> 01:04:33,640
you know, a horse would make a bond with you if you're nice

1523
01:04:33,640 --> 01:04:35,640
with a horse. Like, but he never did

1524
01:04:35,640 --> 01:04:37,640
that. Like, he was whining over

1525
01:04:37,640 --> 01:04:39,640
how a horse was like, horse, why are you bitching

1526
01:04:39,640 --> 01:04:41,640
about the scratch? Again, it is

1527
01:04:41,640 --> 01:04:43,640
just a movie plot.

1528
01:04:43,640 --> 01:04:45,640
Alright, sure. Would you say that you're racist

1529
01:04:45,640 --> 01:04:47,640
against horses too? Yes.

1530
01:04:47,640 --> 01:04:49,640
Species too.

1531
01:04:49,640 --> 01:04:51,640
Barch's

1532
01:04:51,640 --> 01:04:53,640
biases are only growing from the show.

1533
01:04:53,640 --> 01:04:55,640
His hatred is...

1534
01:04:55,640 --> 01:04:57,640
Wait, Kibbs,

1535
01:04:57,640 --> 01:04:59,640
you're a horse right now, dude.

1536
01:04:59,640 --> 01:05:01,640
Yes, that's true.

1537
01:05:01,640 --> 01:05:03,640
But also,

1538
01:05:03,640 --> 01:05:05,640
I'm watching the Harfoot scene now

1539
01:05:05,640 --> 01:05:07,640
where their entire little retarded village is

1540
01:05:07,640 --> 01:05:09,640
burnt to the ground and there's

1541
01:05:09,640 --> 01:05:11,640
shitloads of stuff that isn't burnt.

1542
01:05:11,640 --> 01:05:13,640
Like, there's like pieces of wooden

1543
01:05:13,640 --> 01:05:15,640
like, bowls just fine.

1544
01:05:15,640 --> 01:05:17,640
There's pieces of their fucking retarded camo netting

1545
01:05:17,640 --> 01:05:19,640
just lying over the flames.

1546
01:05:19,640 --> 01:05:21,640
That's just fine.

1547
01:05:21,640 --> 01:05:23,640
It's like they just created

1548
01:05:23,640 --> 01:05:25,640
a set of burnt out carts.

1549
01:05:27,640 --> 01:05:29,640
Yeah, this show seems to consistently

1550
01:05:29,640 --> 01:05:31,640
just be weird about fire.

1551
01:05:31,640 --> 01:05:33,640
Cause there was that, the broken tree branch

1552
01:05:33,640 --> 01:05:35,640
that was just painted to be burned, but not actually

1553
01:05:35,640 --> 01:05:37,640
burned. Like,

1554
01:05:37,640 --> 01:05:39,640
I think they just don't know what like,

1555
01:05:39,640 --> 01:05:41,640
what fire is. They just don't get it.

1556
01:05:41,640 --> 01:05:43,640
It's not that.

1557
01:05:43,640 --> 01:05:45,640
It's an active resistance to attention to detail.

1558
01:05:45,640 --> 01:05:47,640
That's the thing. Like, cause

1559
01:05:47,640 --> 01:05:49,640
they don't actually give a fuck.

1560
01:05:49,640 --> 01:05:51,640
Again, the queen,

1561
01:05:51,640 --> 01:05:53,640
it's writing by

1562
01:05:53,640 --> 01:05:55,640
scene, by numbers, right?

1563
01:05:55,640 --> 01:05:57,640
Queen is sitting on her horse, and you're like

1564
01:05:57,640 --> 01:05:59,640
oh my god, she's blind. And she's like

1565
01:05:59,640 --> 01:06:01,640
I don't want to show my weakness to the soldiers.

1566
01:06:01,640 --> 01:06:03,640
Okay. Makes a lot of

1567
01:06:03,640 --> 01:06:05,640
sense. And then next scene, she's

1568
01:06:05,640 --> 01:06:07,640
sitting there with a fucking blindfold.

1569
01:06:07,640 --> 01:06:09,640
Yeah, no explanation whatsoever.

1570
01:06:09,640 --> 01:06:11,640
I mean, now it's okay to break

1571
01:06:11,640 --> 01:06:13,640
the moral, I guess.

1572
01:06:13,640 --> 01:06:15,640
Either it was always

1573
01:06:15,640 --> 01:06:17,640
okay, or like

1574
01:06:17,640 --> 01:06:19,640
what happened in between.

1575
01:06:19,640 --> 01:06:21,640
Yeah.

1576
01:06:21,640 --> 01:06:23,640
Yeah, um

1577
01:06:23,640 --> 01:06:25,640
I don't, I don't think I agree with you there.

1578
01:06:25,640 --> 01:06:27,640
I actually think that it's ignorance. I think that it's

1579
01:06:27,640 --> 01:06:29,640
ignorance, because like, I'm sure

1580
01:06:29,640 --> 01:06:31,640
we've all heard that story of the university

1581
01:06:31,640 --> 01:06:33,640
professor who is very

1582
01:06:33,640 --> 01:06:35,640
intelligent, like a math professor or physics

1583
01:06:35,640 --> 01:06:37,640
professor or something. He's very intelligent, but he doesn't

1584
01:06:37,640 --> 01:06:39,640
know what a supply chain is. So he asks

1585
01:06:39,640 --> 01:06:41,640
the question, why do people hunt for

1586
01:06:41,640 --> 01:06:43,640
food? Why not just get your food from the grocery store?

1587
01:06:43,640 --> 01:06:45,640
We don't need to kill animals anymore, just go to the grocery store.

1588
01:06:45,640 --> 01:06:47,640
It's like, well, he doesn't know

1589
01:06:47,640 --> 01:06:49,640
what, like how the food gets to the grocery

1590
01:06:49,640 --> 01:06:51,640
store, right? Like, there's that story that I think

1591
01:06:51,640 --> 01:06:53,640
we've all heard at least once.

1592
01:06:53,640 --> 01:06:55,640
I genuinely think the people who

1593
01:06:55,640 --> 01:06:57,640
wrote this show don't know

1594
01:06:57,640 --> 01:06:59,640
how fire or heat works.

1595
01:06:59,640 --> 01:07:01,640
They're like, oh yeah, things kind of get pretty

1596
01:07:01,640 --> 01:07:03,640
hot, you know, I turn on the heating in my house and like

1597
01:07:03,640 --> 01:07:05,640
heats up a bit, maybe it's a little bit too hot, but

1598
01:07:05,640 --> 01:07:07,640
it's not a big deal.

1599
01:07:07,640 --> 01:07:09,640
I genuinely think they don't

1600
01:07:09,640 --> 01:07:11,640
get it. They've never been around like a campfire

1601
01:07:11,640 --> 01:07:13,640
before or a real fire.

1602
01:07:13,640 --> 01:07:15,640
The thing is like, I'm sure they're idiots

1603
01:07:15,640 --> 01:07:17,640
as well, Dev. I'm not

1604
01:07:17,640 --> 01:07:19,640
I'm not saying they're not retards

1605
01:07:19,640 --> 01:07:21,640
also, but no, it

1606
01:07:21,640 --> 01:07:23,640
is the consistent lack

1607
01:07:23,640 --> 01:07:25,640
of attention to detail. It's like with their

1608
01:07:25,640 --> 01:07:27,640
armor. Galadriel doesn't have her

1609
01:07:27,640 --> 01:07:29,640
armor until Galadriel

1610
01:07:29,640 --> 01:07:31,640
suddenly has her fucking armor.

1611
01:07:31,640 --> 01:07:33,640
And the Halibrand too.

1612
01:07:33,640 --> 01:07:35,640
In one scene, there's like a

1613
01:07:35,640 --> 01:07:37,640
man in him, basically dead on the side of the road

1614
01:07:37,640 --> 01:07:39,640
like only elephant medicine can cure him.

1615
01:07:39,640 --> 01:07:41,640
Can you ride? Yep.

1616
01:07:41,640 --> 01:07:43,640
And he's just

1617
01:07:43,640 --> 01:07:45,640
walking perfectly healthy.

1618
01:07:45,640 --> 01:07:47,640
It's like, where are we riding to?

1619
01:07:47,640 --> 01:07:49,640
To get the elephant medicine that'll cure you.

1620
01:07:49,640 --> 01:07:51,640
But I'm riding.

1621
01:07:51,640 --> 01:07:53,640
Like his medicine is falling out.

1622
01:07:55,640 --> 01:07:57,640
Why don't you pick up the

1623
01:07:57,640 --> 01:07:59,640
medicine yourself and come back

1624
01:07:59,640 --> 01:08:01,640
for him and he can rest

1625
01:08:01,640 --> 01:08:03,640
and hopefully not die.

1626
01:08:03,640 --> 01:08:05,640
Put him in a fucking cart

1627
01:08:05,640 --> 01:08:07,640
or something.

1628
01:08:09,640 --> 01:08:11,640
I mean, I don't

1629
01:08:11,640 --> 01:08:13,640
know if anybody here has

1630
01:08:13,640 --> 01:08:15,640
ridden a horse, but

1631
01:08:15,640 --> 01:08:17,640
they're not the most stable.

1632
01:08:17,640 --> 01:08:19,640
Yeah, they're quite bumpy.

1633
01:08:19,640 --> 01:08:21,640
Again, it is

1634
01:08:21,640 --> 01:08:23,640
the consistent lack of attention

1635
01:08:23,640 --> 01:08:25,640
to detail because they

1636
01:08:25,640 --> 01:08:27,640
think of a scene

1637
01:08:27,640 --> 01:08:29,640
of, wouldn't it be cool if Halibrand

1638
01:08:29,640 --> 01:08:31,640
was like wounded and they had to get like

1639
01:08:31,640 --> 01:08:33,640
elephant medicine. Yeah, that's like from those

1640
01:08:33,640 --> 01:08:35,640
movies things. Yeah, let's do that.

1641
01:08:35,640 --> 01:08:37,640
But then they also rode a scene

1642
01:08:37,640 --> 01:08:39,640
later on that needs to have Halibrand

1643
01:08:39,640 --> 01:08:41,640
with Galadriel and so they're like, fuck.

1644
01:08:41,640 --> 01:08:43,640
Why don't you have him ride? It's fine.

1645
01:08:45,640 --> 01:08:47,640
Lilith, Lilith, you have to understand

1646
01:08:47,640 --> 01:08:49,640
everyone in this call rides Kibs at least

1647
01:08:49,640 --> 01:08:51,640
once a day.

1648
01:08:51,640 --> 01:08:53,640
So, also, also, also.

1649
01:08:53,640 --> 01:08:55,640
Galadriel arrives at camp,

1650
01:08:55,640 --> 01:08:57,640
right? And then five minutes

1651
01:08:57,640 --> 01:08:59,640
later, her plate armor is perfectly

1652
01:08:59,640 --> 01:09:01,640
spotlessly clean, including her

1653
01:09:01,640 --> 01:09:03,640
chainmail.

1654
01:09:03,640 --> 01:09:05,640
I guarantee you, Arch, there's a bunch of simps in

1655
01:09:05,640 --> 01:09:07,640
that camp we'll just lick it off for.

1656
01:09:07,640 --> 01:09:09,640
Probably.

1657
01:09:09,640 --> 01:09:11,640
Okay, so

1658
01:09:11,640 --> 01:09:13,640
I think we all have heard

1659
01:09:13,640 --> 01:09:15,640
Arch's rant at this point.

1660
01:09:15,640 --> 01:09:17,640
Does anybody else want to throw in their two cents?

1661
01:09:19,640 --> 01:09:21,640
I forgot what we were talking about. I sort of zoned out.

1662
01:09:21,640 --> 01:09:23,640
We're talking about whores.

1663
01:09:23,640 --> 01:09:25,640
You mean there's not

1664
01:09:25,640 --> 01:09:27,640
I feel like there's not much to say.

1665
01:09:27,640 --> 01:09:29,640
The show just

1666
01:09:29,640 --> 01:09:31,640
kind of speaks to her itself.

1667
01:09:31,640 --> 01:09:33,640
Let's hope the

1668
01:09:33,640 --> 01:09:35,640
next episode will be better because

1669
01:09:35,640 --> 01:09:37,640
there's just lots of

1670
01:09:37,640 --> 01:09:39,640
I think we pretty much complain about everything

1671
01:09:39,640 --> 01:09:41,640
you're used to complain. There is no fucking way

1672
01:09:41,640 --> 01:09:43,640
the show gets any better.

1673
01:09:43,640 --> 01:09:45,640
Like, maybe, maybe by season two

1674
01:09:45,640 --> 01:09:47,640
but this season's going to be a

1675
01:09:47,640 --> 01:09:49,640
trash fire all the way down.

1676
01:09:49,640 --> 01:09:51,640
The thing is, this

1677
01:09:51,640 --> 01:09:53,640
this was the payoff.

1678
01:09:53,640 --> 01:09:55,640
This was supposed to be the big moment

1679
01:09:55,640 --> 01:09:57,640
and the storylines actually got started

1680
01:09:57,640 --> 01:09:59,640
after seven hours.

1681
01:09:59,640 --> 01:10:01,640
Well

1682
01:10:01,640 --> 01:10:03,640
I know that it was meant to be

1683
01:10:03,640 --> 01:10:05,640
the money shot and I do feel like

1684
01:10:05,640 --> 01:10:07,640
I got fucked.

1685
01:10:07,640 --> 01:10:09,640
I do like that the camp is like

1686
01:10:09,640 --> 01:10:11,640
conveniently

1687
01:10:11,640 --> 01:10:13,640
outside of the range of

1688
01:10:13,640 --> 01:10:15,640
Mount Doom.

1689
01:10:15,640 --> 01:10:17,640
Yeah.

1690
01:10:17,640 --> 01:10:19,640
Well, good thing they have the foresight.

1691
01:10:19,640 --> 01:10:21,640
Actually, you know what?

1692
01:10:21,640 --> 01:10:23,640
So they mentioned in the last episode

1693
01:10:23,640 --> 01:10:25,640
how they got that far inland.

1694
01:10:25,640 --> 01:10:27,640
Apparently the ships they have

1695
01:10:27,640 --> 01:10:29,640
can also sail up rivers.

1696
01:10:29,640 --> 01:10:31,640
So they just sailed all the way

1697
01:10:31,640 --> 01:10:33,640
up to the Southlands.

1698
01:10:33,640 --> 01:10:35,640
That's not out of the ordinary

1699
01:10:35,640 --> 01:10:37,640
in fact, that's pretty common for ships like that.

1700
01:10:37,640 --> 01:10:39,640
Is it?

1701
01:10:39,640 --> 01:10:41,640
But ships that can hold 500 guys?

1702
01:10:41,640 --> 01:10:43,640
Yeah, no, no, no, no, no.

1703
01:10:43,640 --> 01:10:45,640
As the resident fucking Norwegian here

1704
01:10:45,640 --> 01:10:47,640
for people who invented river faring ships

1705
01:10:47,640 --> 01:10:49,640
Yeah, you guys did that.

1706
01:10:49,640 --> 01:10:51,640
This is for shallow draft

1707
01:10:51,640 --> 01:10:53,640
ships. Like, these are not shallow

1708
01:10:53,640 --> 01:10:55,640
draft ships. These are fucking galleons.

1709
01:10:55,640 --> 01:10:57,640
Yeah, and the rivers are deep.

1710
01:10:57,640 --> 01:10:59,640
You put your foot in, Cib.

1711
01:11:01,640 --> 01:11:03,640
Oh, God.

1712
01:11:03,640 --> 01:11:05,640
Amazon, hire me. I can explain

1713
01:11:05,640 --> 01:11:07,640
away everything.

1714
01:11:07,640 --> 01:11:09,640
Wait, Cibs, it turns

1715
01:11:09,640 --> 01:11:11,640
out that you're just the Amazon plant in the group

1716
01:11:11,640 --> 01:11:13,640
the whole time. I've been sabotaging it.

1717
01:11:13,640 --> 01:11:15,640
It's actually pretty good, guys.

1718
01:11:15,640 --> 01:11:17,640
There's no rivers

1719
01:11:17,640 --> 01:11:19,640
leading up to Mount Doom.

1720
01:11:19,640 --> 01:11:21,640
Like, none.

1721
01:11:21,640 --> 01:11:23,640
Like, they still have to cross the fucking

1722
01:11:23,640 --> 01:11:25,640
mountain range.

1723
01:11:25,640 --> 01:11:27,640
Listen, I don't want to hear any more of your

1724
01:11:27,640 --> 01:11:29,640
details, Arch, okay?

1725
01:11:29,640 --> 01:11:31,640
The closest they could get

1726
01:11:31,640 --> 01:11:33,640
is, like, one of the rivers that leads

1727
01:11:33,640 --> 01:11:35,640
to the southern edge of the

1728
01:11:35,640 --> 01:11:37,640
wall of mountains. And then they'd

1729
01:11:37,640 --> 01:11:39,640
have to cross literally the

1730
01:11:39,640 --> 01:11:41,640
entirety of Mordor

1731
01:11:41,640 --> 01:11:43,640
to reach Mount Doom.

1732
01:11:43,640 --> 01:11:45,640
Yep. It was kind of why Frodo, it was such a big deal for

1733
01:11:45,640 --> 01:11:47,640
Frodo and Sam to get in there because

1734
01:11:47,640 --> 01:11:49,640
there's really no other way to get past the mountains.

1735
01:11:49,640 --> 01:11:51,640
Yeah, I'd also like to point out

1736
01:11:51,640 --> 01:11:53,640
these mountains,

1737
01:11:53,640 --> 01:11:55,640
they're not like hills.

1738
01:11:55,640 --> 01:11:57,640
It's an enormous fucking barrier.

1739
01:11:57,640 --> 01:11:59,640
Particularly for

1740
01:11:59,640 --> 01:12:01,640
people on horses.

1741
01:12:01,640 --> 01:12:03,640
And for a plus two.

1742
01:12:03,640 --> 01:12:05,640
This is 300 men.

1743
01:12:05,640 --> 01:12:07,640
Like, the amount of food,

1744
01:12:07,640 --> 01:12:09,640
supplies, parts,

1745
01:12:09,640 --> 01:12:11,640
they've set up a fucking tent town.

1746
01:12:11,640 --> 01:12:13,640
Well, you see, Arch,

1747
01:12:13,640 --> 01:12:15,640
Hannibal Barca did it, and he did it with

1748
01:12:15,640 --> 01:12:17,640
elephants and the Alps, okay?

1749
01:12:21,640 --> 01:12:23,640
I broke Arch.

1750
01:12:23,640 --> 01:12:25,640
No, they operated on a Russian line of thinking

1751
01:12:25,640 --> 01:12:27,640
supply lines?

1752
01:12:27,640 --> 01:12:29,640
What supply lines?

1753
01:12:29,640 --> 01:12:31,640
What supplies?

1754
01:12:31,640 --> 01:12:33,640
Scavenger we go.

1755
01:12:33,640 --> 01:12:35,640
This is a nitpick that's

1756
01:12:35,640 --> 01:12:37,640
almost pointless, but since we're going

1757
01:12:37,640 --> 01:12:39,640
at it, there's no way those fucking

1758
01:12:39,640 --> 01:12:41,640
We're going at it.

1759
01:12:41,640 --> 01:12:43,640
carried 300 fucking horses.

1760
01:12:43,640 --> 01:12:45,640
Well, there's no way to

1761
01:12:45,640 --> 01:12:47,640
carry 300 men either.

1762
01:12:47,640 --> 01:12:49,640
There's a lot of meme art showing the ship,

1763
01:12:49,640 --> 01:12:51,640
and then it shows the side interior,

1764
01:12:51,640 --> 01:12:53,640
and underneath it goes like

1765
01:12:53,640 --> 01:12:55,640
40 feet deep, and there's like 30 decks.

1766
01:12:55,640 --> 01:12:57,640
It's like a giant

1767
01:12:57,640 --> 01:12:59,640
barge underwater.

1768
01:12:59,640 --> 01:13:01,640
Oh, okay, that's where the other 300 men is.

1769
01:13:01,640 --> 01:13:03,640
They show

1770
01:13:03,640 --> 01:13:05,640
a shot of the ship's deck,

1771
01:13:05,640 --> 01:13:07,640
and there's like 10-12 people, and it looks

1772
01:13:07,640 --> 01:13:09,640
crowded.

1773
01:13:09,640 --> 01:13:11,640
Those ships

1774
01:13:11,640 --> 01:13:13,640
can't carry 300 men, I'm sorry,

1775
01:13:13,640 --> 01:13:15,640
but that's just not possible.

1776
01:13:15,640 --> 01:13:17,640
Not including horses, no.

1777
01:13:17,640 --> 01:13:19,640
Again, it is the consistent

1778
01:13:19,640 --> 01:13:21,640
fucking lack of attention to deal.

1779
01:13:21,640 --> 01:13:23,640
This is Numenor.

1780
01:13:23,640 --> 01:13:25,640
There's just CGI ships. There's no reason

1781
01:13:25,640 --> 01:13:27,640
why they couldn't have shown like

1782
01:13:27,640 --> 01:13:29,640
100 fucking ships setting sail from

1783
01:13:29,640 --> 01:13:31,640
Numenor. That would look cool.

1784
01:13:31,640 --> 01:13:33,640
The Numenoreans are going to war,

1785
01:13:33,640 --> 01:13:35,640
and there's this massive armada just

1786
01:13:35,640 --> 01:13:37,640
cresting the sea. Yeah, instead,

1787
01:13:37,640 --> 01:13:39,640
it's five boats, and then two of them

1788
01:13:39,640 --> 01:13:41,640
have three boats left.

1789
01:13:41,640 --> 01:13:43,640
You would think that

1790
01:13:43,640 --> 01:13:45,640
a show like this would have more

1791
01:13:45,640 --> 01:13:47,640
budget behind it.

1792
01:13:47,640 --> 01:13:49,640
Okay.

1793
01:13:49,640 --> 01:13:51,640
Let's just give

1794
01:13:51,640 --> 01:13:53,640
a few more CGI ships.

1795
01:13:53,640 --> 01:13:55,640
I think I know.

1796
01:13:55,640 --> 01:13:57,640
I think I know why not.

1797
01:13:57,640 --> 01:13:59,640
I think I know why not. So earlier,

1798
01:13:59,640 --> 01:14:01,640
I mentioned that it's like a lack of real-world

1799
01:14:01,640 --> 01:14:03,640
experience as to why they don't know how fire works.

1800
01:14:03,640 --> 01:14:05,640
Okay. Assume

1801
01:14:05,640 --> 01:14:07,640
that these writers are very sheltered

1802
01:14:07,640 --> 01:14:09,640
living in LA their whole lives

1803
01:14:09,640 --> 01:14:11,640
or something. They don't know how anything works.

1804
01:14:11,640 --> 01:14:13,640
And then, also, assume

1805
01:14:13,640 --> 01:14:15,640
that they're, let's say, extremely

1806
01:14:15,640 --> 01:14:17,640
extremely left-leaning.

1807
01:14:17,640 --> 01:14:19,640
Okay, let's just make these two assumptions.

1808
01:14:19,640 --> 01:14:21,640
Okay.

1809
01:14:21,640 --> 01:14:23,640
The only ships they would have heard about

1810
01:14:23,640 --> 01:14:25,640
would have been African slave ships

1811
01:14:25,640 --> 01:14:27,640
and how they crowded

1812
01:14:27,640 --> 01:14:29,640
them full with hundreds of people.

1813
01:14:29,640 --> 01:14:31,640
I like where we're

1814
01:14:31,640 --> 01:14:33,640
going. Of course you would,

1815
01:14:33,640 --> 01:14:35,640
aren't you? Fuck. But like,

1816
01:14:35,640 --> 01:14:37,640
that's why they're like, we can

1817
01:14:37,640 --> 01:14:39,640
clearly put 500

1818
01:14:39,640 --> 01:14:41,640
guys in a ship. That's how it worked, right?

1819
01:14:41,640 --> 01:14:43,640
Obviously. I remember hearing about that.

1820
01:14:43,640 --> 01:14:45,640
That was their line of logic.

1821
01:14:45,640 --> 01:14:47,640
This is so annoying, though, because

1822
01:14:47,640 --> 01:14:49,640
when you're a writer and you're writing

1823
01:14:49,640 --> 01:14:51,640
fantasy or writing science fiction,

1824
01:14:51,640 --> 01:14:53,640
most of your work is actually just reading

1825
01:14:53,640 --> 01:14:55,640
or Google searching, literally.

1826
01:14:55,640 --> 01:14:57,640
Okay, how does this work?

1827
01:14:57,640 --> 01:14:59,640
Or you call up somebody, a friend who

1828
01:14:59,640 --> 01:15:01,640
is actually an architect. How do these buildings work?

1829
01:15:01,640 --> 01:15:03,640
It's a lot of research.

1830
01:15:03,640 --> 01:15:05,640
More time spent researching than you'll ever

1831
01:15:05,640 --> 01:15:07,640
spend writing. They didn't do any of the right research.

1832
01:15:07,640 --> 01:15:09,640
They ought to be like the pawn stars. Hold on, let me

1833
01:15:09,640 --> 01:15:11,640
call up my expert.

1834
01:15:11,640 --> 01:15:13,640
Yeah, it says you're going to need

1835
01:15:13,640 --> 01:15:15,640
a lot more boats.

1836
01:15:15,640 --> 01:15:17,640
No, no, no. This

1837
01:15:17,640 --> 01:15:19,640
explains a lot. The reason why Numenor

1838
01:15:19,640 --> 01:15:21,640
is so diverse is because the white

1839
01:15:21,640 --> 01:15:23,640
people use the black people as

1840
01:15:23,640 --> 01:15:25,640
slave warriors, and they pack them into their

1841
01:15:25,640 --> 01:15:27,640
boats really tight. Look at this. See, Arch

1842
01:15:27,640 --> 01:15:29,640
can't hold back. He just has to.

1843
01:15:29,640 --> 01:15:31,640
I know this was Dev's idea. I'm just

1844
01:15:31,640 --> 01:15:33,640
expanding upon it. It's like a pop-up army.

1845
01:15:33,640 --> 01:15:35,640
It's kind of like the droids

1846
01:15:35,640 --> 01:15:37,640
from Star Wars, like the side of the ships

1847
01:15:37,640 --> 01:15:39,640
Arch and stuff.

1848
01:15:39,640 --> 01:15:41,640
Black people extend out

1849
01:15:41,640 --> 01:15:43,640
like the fucking droid army starts

1850
01:15:43,640 --> 01:15:45,640
playing like, bear, bear, bear.

1851
01:15:45,640 --> 01:15:47,640
Fucking no way.

1852
01:15:47,640 --> 01:15:49,640
Where do they keep the horses, Dev?

1853
01:15:49,640 --> 01:15:51,640
Yeah, we've answered

1854
01:15:51,640 --> 01:15:53,640
that question.

1855
01:15:53,640 --> 01:15:55,640
We know how they've stacked up the humans, but

1856
01:15:55,640 --> 01:15:57,640
where are the fucking horses?

1857
01:15:57,640 --> 01:15:59,640
Where's the horses' food?

1858
01:15:59,640 --> 01:16:01,640
Did they stack them up too?

1859
01:16:01,640 --> 01:16:03,640
Did they stack them like, black person, horse,

1860
01:16:03,640 --> 01:16:05,640
black person, horse?

1861
01:16:05,640 --> 01:16:07,640
Damn, Arch.

1862
01:16:07,640 --> 01:16:09,640
Just smashed in there?

1863
01:16:09,640 --> 01:16:11,640
What would the horse think?

1864
01:16:11,640 --> 01:16:13,640
What would the horse think?

1865
01:16:13,640 --> 01:16:15,640
I'm going to have to start distancing

1866
01:16:15,640 --> 01:16:17,640
myself, but I think it's too late.

1867
01:16:17,640 --> 01:16:19,640
Dev, remember me?

1868
01:16:19,640 --> 01:16:21,640
Next

1869
01:16:21,640 --> 01:16:23,640
episode, Arch is completely

1870
01:16:23,640 --> 01:16:25,640
replaced.

1871
01:16:25,640 --> 01:16:27,640
We just pretend we never knew it.

1872
01:16:27,640 --> 01:16:29,640
Guys, Arch is sick with

1873
01:16:29,640 --> 01:16:31,640
Covid again.

1874
01:16:31,640 --> 01:16:33,640
And Arch comes

1875
01:16:33,640 --> 01:16:35,640
in on horses

1876
01:16:35,640 --> 01:16:37,640
wearing clan hoods, like

1877
01:16:37,640 --> 01:16:39,640
in Birth of the Nation.

1878
01:16:39,640 --> 01:16:41,640
What if the horses

1879
01:16:41,640 --> 01:16:43,640
were black too? Could they store them

1880
01:16:43,640 --> 01:16:45,640
as easily? Arch, you

1881
01:16:45,640 --> 01:16:47,640
have Fehrman syndrome.

1882
01:16:47,640 --> 01:16:49,640
Oh, does Fehrman? I guess Fehrman's

1883
01:16:49,640 --> 01:16:51,640
German, right? He always is racist.

1884
01:16:51,640 --> 01:16:53,640
Let me Google, do

1885
01:16:53,640 --> 01:16:55,640
black horses fold?

1886
01:16:55,640 --> 01:16:57,640
Wait, hold on.

1887
01:16:57,640 --> 01:16:59,640
We'll get

1888
01:16:59,640 --> 01:17:01,640
Fehrman in for the next one.

1889
01:17:01,640 --> 01:17:03,640
We can see if he can out-racist

1890
01:17:03,640 --> 01:17:05,640
Arch with his German-ness.

1891
01:17:05,640 --> 01:17:07,640
The thing is, he doesn't

1892
01:17:07,640 --> 01:17:09,640
really do the racism thing, he just

1893
01:17:09,640 --> 01:17:11,640
does the anti-semitism thing.

1894
01:17:11,640 --> 01:17:13,640
Yeah.

1895
01:17:13,640 --> 01:17:15,640
He's like...

1896
01:17:15,640 --> 01:17:17,640
A while ago, he was talking

1897
01:17:17,640 --> 01:17:19,640
about how his mouse was busted, and he's

1898
01:17:19,640 --> 01:17:21,640
like, back in Auschwitz, our gear

1899
01:17:21,640 --> 01:17:23,640
was on top shape.

1900
01:17:23,640 --> 01:17:25,640
Jesus.

1901
01:17:25,640 --> 01:17:27,640
There's more than a problem in Poland.

1902
01:17:27,640 --> 01:17:29,640
I don't remember Fehrman's alt-right Arch,

1903
01:17:29,640 --> 01:17:31,640
but we're going with it now.
