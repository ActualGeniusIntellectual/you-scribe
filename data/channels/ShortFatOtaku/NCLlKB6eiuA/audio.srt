1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,760
Let's talk about Shinagami Eyes.

2
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:11,620
Shinagami Eyes is a plugin, mainly known for its use on Twitter, but it does work anywhere

3
00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:16,500
on the internet, that highlights transphobic individuals' names in red, and trans-positive

4
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:17,500
names in green.

5
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:19,580
That's pretty much it, it's quite simple.

6
00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:23,540
But the context surrounding the name of the plugin, Shinagami Eyes, holds a lot of hidden

7
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:24,540
meaning.

8
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:26,760
I'll very quickly go over it because those who know don't need to be told.

9
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:30,360
Death Note is a pretty good anime from 2006, it's one of those shows that everybody should

10
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:32,580
watch, though as always, skip the Netflix adaptation.

11
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:36,720
The TLDR is, Light Yagami is a Japanese high school student who finds a magical notebook,

12
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:38,000
the titular Death Note.

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,380
What makes it magical is that if you write somebody's name in the book while picturing

14
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:43,360
their face in your mind, they die.

15
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:47,260
Light is an athletic, attractive, charismatic super genius, who is bored with the world

16
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:48,880
and views other people as beneath him.

17
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:52,200
Couple that with his own very retributive sense of morality, and he decides to use the

18
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:56,160
powers of the Death Note to begin to systematically kill every criminal on the planet, in order

19
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:57,440
to bring about the utopia.

20
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:58,620
This is where the Shinagami come in.

21
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:01,840
Shinagami means Death God in Japanese, and there's a wide variety of interpretations

22
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:05,940
of them in their culture, but Death Note uses them the way that we'd use Angel of Death,

23
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:09,760
a being responsible for the orderliness of death, who comes for those when their time

24
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:11,940
is up and brings their soul to the afterlife.

25
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:14,600
The Shinagami are the owners of the Death Notes, the tools of their trade.

26
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:18,040
They invisibly move about the world with the ability to see the names of people floating

27
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:21,740
above their heads, along with a timer counting down the remainder of their natural life.

28
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:24,520
In this way the Shinagami know whose turn it is to die.

29
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:28,320
But if a human happens to acquire a Death Note, its corresponding Shinagami becomes

30
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,720
their invisible companion.

31
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:33,360
One of the perks a Shinagami might offer to their new human is the Shinagami eyes.

32
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:37,760
In exchange for half of the human's remaining natural life, the human gains the power to

33
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:41,900
see the world as the Shinagami do, with the names and times above everybody's heads.

34
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:45,240
It sort of looks like the way Google Glass was supposed to operate, or like the scanning

35
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:46,680
from the Watchdog games.

36
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:50,880
And they all appeal to that same idea, that you can walk through society appearing normal

37
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:55,040
while you exist half in another plane, learning people's secrets simply by looking at them.

38
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:58,740
Death Note is the kind of show that came out at just the right time and was just edgy and

39
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:03,160
smart enough that a lot of the terminally online trans twitter crowd nowadays absolutely

40
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:05,400
worship it as part of their formative years.

41
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:09,960
And so I am not surprised that they would name their transphobe detector software Shinagami

42
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:10,960
Eyes.

43
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:13,800
The implication that there is this secret underpinning of reality that only the special

44
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:17,960
few have access to, that they can peer beyond the veil and see the truth beneath people's

45
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:19,840
hearts with their unique trans powers.

46
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,780
That shit is right up their Mary Sue special snowflake alley.

47
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:26,240
Of course, how the plugin works is, there's a database of names, and people are rated

48
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:29,380
by users of the app on how more or less transphobic they are.

49
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:33,360
So if you see a green name, that means that people rated that person as trans positive.

50
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:36,880
You see a red name, that means that people rated that person as transphobic.

51
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:39,320
It's kind of like that Lulu app, if you remember that controversy.

52
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:41,720
Back in 2013, the Lulu app was launched.

53
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:43,520
It was a way for women to rate men.

54
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:46,500
It was considered a side app to Tinder, launched in 2012.

55
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:50,220
And piggybacking off that app's success, if you were a girl and you approved of meeting

56
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:53,880
a guy on Tinder, you could hop over to Lulu and see what other girls thought of him.

57
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:58,460
For a time, Lulu was also considered this secret exclusive network running beneath Tinder

58
00:02:58,460 --> 00:03:00,340
while still being an unofficial part of it.

59
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:04,080
And when it finally became public knowledge, the men who were on it found it rather demeaning

60
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,300
that they were being catalogued by their intimate partners.

61
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:10,320
The resulting controversy saw Lulu fall into disuse, and the company was eventually sold

62
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:11,320
off in 2016.

63
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:14,100
Also, because we're not coming back to Death Note again in this video, and when the hell

64
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:15,100
am I going to talk about this again?

65
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:20,280
The 2019 Death Note one-shot Donald Trump as President of the United States pays one

66
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:25,260
quadrillion yen to obtain a new Death Note, but declines to use it, simply opting to keep

67
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:26,980
it out of China's hands.

68
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:27,980
Based.

69
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:31,580
So even though I'm not trans, I decided to install Shinigami eyes.

70
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:32,580
Because why not?

71
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:35,820
Why not see the world the way that those terminally online Twitter trans people see it?

72
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:37,920
I'm sure there's going to be a few of them who screech at the idea.

73
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,220
How dare I pop their bubble?

74
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:41,320
How dare somebody like me use their tools?

75
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:42,320
But uh, fuck it.

76
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:46,040
Alright, here we are on Twitter.com, let's take a look at who I'm following, and who's

77
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:47,040
marked what.

78
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:50,800
Nothing so far, nothing so far, oh, Simpneelix.

79
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:53,760
Simpneelix is the first.

80
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,000
Why this account?

81
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,640
Simpneelix is the first casualty as apparently being transphobic.

82
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:05,520
Zachrabbit is red, Yizz, Yizz is red, again not surprised, Gamby is red, Gamby is a trans

83
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,520
woman.

84
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:09,320
Anti-fascist, rad lib content creator, trans woman.

85
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:14,160
Anivelens is predictably marked as green, though keep that name in mind for later.

86
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:16,200
People whining about stone toss.

87
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:18,600
Even gimmick accounts aren't safe from Shinigami eyes.

88
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:21,320
9V green, I wonder if all the feet pics helped him out.

89
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:23,200
Riley is green, no surprise there.

90
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:26,320
If you're marked as green it doesn't mean that you're just a woke scold and that's it.

91
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:30,280
For green it's about 50% chance you're a woke scold, 50% chance you're actually pretty cool.

92
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:34,200
The left can't meme, of course, is marked red.

93
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:38,440
But then again, so is Erika, the super lesbian, I guess because she doesn't want to suck the

94
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:39,440
dick bigot.

95
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,200
She's a transphobe, alright.

96
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:43,200
The Real Daily Wire, marked red.

97
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,800
Alan Bocari, marked red.

98
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,000
Breitbart, marked red, no surprises here.

99
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,400
Colin Borisenko is red.

100
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,560
I never, like is she anti-trans?

101
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,320
I didn't think she was.

102
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,740
Sinatra Says is red.

103
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:55,840
What did Sinatra do?

104
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:58,200
Zuby's red, there's no surprises there.

105
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,200
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

106
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:03,160
Babylon Bee is red?

107
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,160
Are they a comedy say?

108
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,680
Aren't they news parody?

109
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:11,520
Pink Spot, that's Jordan Peterson's attempt to make a social media platform, right?

110
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,720
It's a transphobic platform?

111
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:15,160
Is that the implication here?

112
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:18,800
Oh shit, Dr. Diddler, one of the mods over at Adam and Stitch.

113
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,800
I guess he's a transphobe, shit.

114
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,480
The Corridoring and his editor are both red.

115
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:24,840
Nobody's surprised with this, right?

116
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:26,520
Razorfist is marked red.

117
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:30,800
At this point I'm just kind of wondering if they're marking red anybody who like makes

118
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,240
a joke at the expense of trans people.

119
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:37,360
Of course, a lot of the more cucked online personalities are green, Markiplier's green,

120
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,720
Egoraptor's green, Moviebob is green.

121
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:42,560
Oh shit, V and Stix are red.

122
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,320
Oh my God, guys, I didn't know.

123
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:48,120
Why didn't you tell me that you wanted to exterminate the trans population?

124
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:54,360
Lauren Southern, Jordan Peterson, Joe Rogan, Notch, Brett Weinstein, Christina Hoff Sommers,

125
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:59,280
William Shatner, Red Red, Red Red Red Red Red, Arielle Scarcella, or whatever, however

126
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,040
you pronounce her last name, I don't know.

127
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:04,640
Queen of Controversial Conversations and Lesbian, yeah, I really do think that for

128
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:08,320
a lot of these people, especially if they're cis women, it's going to be a suck the dick

129
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:09,680
bigot situation.

130
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:14,600
Titania McGrath, they are in fact calling satirical humor transphobic.

131
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:22,280
Oh damn, dude, the elf porn account and Aiden Paladin and CafeBeef, she's trans herself.

132
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:24,480
The world's just full of transphobes, dude, shit.

133
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:28,040
The more I look at this list, the more I'm realizing that if someone's marked red, they

134
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:33,600
may or may not be transphobic, but it's much more likely that they're just an interesting

135
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,800
person, or at least somebody who understands the nature of humor.

136
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:39,920
Just out of curiosity, I decided to hit up the alt-right page on Wikipedia.

137
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:45,760
Of course, we got Richard Spencer labeled, The Daily Stormer, Steve Bannon, Donald Trump,

138
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:46,760
Ayn Rand.

139
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:48,760
Was Ayn Rand anti-trans?

140
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:50,880
I mean, I don't know.

141
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,120
I don't know enough about her.

142
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:54,240
Vladimir Putin, David Duke.

143
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,920
Oh, this article has Margaret Atwood as green.

144
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,800
I guess the app hasn't caught up yet.

145
00:06:58,800 --> 00:06:59,800
She's a transphobe now.

146
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,280
I don't know if you've heard the recent news.

147
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,880
There is a little bit I wanted to show you on the Gab Wikipedia as well.

148
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:06,340
Yeah, the entire site of Gab is marked as red.

149
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:07,340
Check this out.

150
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:13,400
Tim Pool, Dave Rubin, British National Party, Allen West, Richard Spencer, Mark Meechan,

151
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:19,760
that's Dankula, and Carl Benjamin, Sargon, Sargon, you're spared.

152
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:23,040
You're not transphobic, but Jess Phillips is.

153
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:27,960
Okay, there's one last thing I got to look up, all right?

154
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:29,960
Just bear with me.

155
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:34,200
Oh shit, dude.

156
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:38,000
They labeled Hitler as being transphobic.

157
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,840
I totally needed the app to figure this out.

158
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:42,840
Actually, I don't know.

159
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:48,400
Was there a modern conception of transness, you know, back in the 1930s and 1940s?

160
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:55,840
In fact, in the article on Nazism, the only red links are Adolf Hitler, Nazi Party, and

161
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:59,820
if you keep scrolling down, none of these names, none of these organizations have anything

162
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:05,620
on here, and you have one more red link, Joseph Stalin.

163
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:09,400
This is literally just an interactive list of people they don't like.

164
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:10,640
That's all it is.

165
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:11,960
There's nothing more to it than that.

166
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:16,000
Now, as fun as this all is, I've known about Shinigami Eyes for maybe a year now, maybe

167
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
a little bit less.

168
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,720
Something came out, but I remember hearing about it on Twitter for a while now.

169
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:23,080
Whenever it was talked about, it was always in the vein of, hey, hey, hey, the silly cis

170
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:27,520
people don't know that we can see them, and now that the normies have finally caught up,

171
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,960
they're all screeching and spouting nonsense.

172
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:34,320
Jordan Tildesly wrote an article about the app called Redlisted, stating that the browser

173
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:38,080
extension Shinigami Eyes color codes names on the wrong side of history.

174
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:41,840
This week, I had the audacity to suggest on Twitter that antisemitism remains a problem

175
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:46,640
within someone on the left, well, it does, and that led me down an extraordinary and

176
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,040
terrifying rabbit hole.

177
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:50,400
Welcome to the online world of Shinigami Eyes.

178
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:54,080
I received a notification from one Twitter user alerting another to the fact that Shinigami

179
00:08:54,080 --> 00:09:00,600
Eyes shows me as a transphobe, with a link to the page shinigami-slash-eyes-dot-github-dot-io.

180
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:03,320
Confused, I clicked on the link and made a startling discovery.

181
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:06,760
It's a database of people who are being recorded for their views without their knowledge or

182
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:07,760
consent.

183
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:11,160
Shinigami Eyes uses a combination of user contributions and algorithms to decide your

184
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:12,160
fate.

185
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:14,560
Anyone who installs it can type your name into a search engine and form an opinion of

186
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,280
you based on the color you've been assigned.

187
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:19,800
You have involuntarily joined a database which includes information about you for others

188
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:20,800
to inspect.

189
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:25,320
Yeah, see, I wonder if progressives like Jordan here complained when it was them on

190
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:27,200
Lulu talking about men.

191
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,920
Probably not, frankly, but now that the shoe isn't on the other foot, I guess it's a

192
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:30,920
problem.

193
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:31,920
Forget about Lulu, though.

194
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:35,440
There's a far more popular add-on that once upon a time added an extra layer to your browsing

195
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:39,480
experience, an add-on that progressives decried as being a hotbed of fascism and bigotry and

196
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:40,480
whatever else.

197
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:41,480
It was called...

198
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:42,480
Dissenter.

199
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:43,480
Remember that?

200
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:44,480
I made a video on it back in the day.

201
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:47,280
Dissenter was a Chrome extension made by Gab that added a comment section to every single

202
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:48,320
page of the internet.

203
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:51,620
The comments were stored on Gab's servers and were sorted by URL, so whenever you were

204
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:54,840
on any page, you could open up Dissenter and see what people were saying about it.

205
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:59,200
It blew up rapidly back in 2019, until Google moved to kill it from working on Chromium

206
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,200
based browsers.

207
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:04,560
In practice, it was a far superior Shinigami Eyes in that it also acted as an underlayer

208
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:08,480
of the internet that only those in the know could access, which transmitted extra information

209
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:11,920
to the user, but this time it allowed for whole conversations to happen on there.

210
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:12,920
Same principle.

211
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:13,920
Better implementation.

212
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:16,920
And... everybody lost their fucking minds at Dissenter.

213
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:20,080
How dare you comment on articles when we specifically shut the comments off?

214
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,080
Who do you think you are?

215
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:24,680
How dare you leave notes in Dissenter on my tweets that I can't see unless I install your

216
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:26,360
racist transphobic app?

217
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:30,120
How dare you talk to each other or trade information in a way that we don't approve of?

218
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:33,160
Probably the silliest take of all came from Anna Valens over the Daily Dot, who called

219
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:37,520
it a far-right comment section for hating on journalists and the home of all things

220
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:39,000
gamergate and MAGA.

221
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,640
Geez, even back then gamergate was five years old.

222
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:42,640
Give it up.

223
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:46,600
When they create a secret shadow layer of the internet, it's an empowering tool to help

224
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:49,600
others, to label people as problematic and safely exile them.

225
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,600
But when others do it, it's an alt-right recruiting tool.

226
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,920
It's a hotbed for fascism.

227
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:56,280
In actuality, though, Dissenter and Shinigami Eyes are cut from the same cloth, in that

228
00:10:56,280 --> 00:11:00,160
they contribute hidden knowledge layered atop a regular internet experience that only those

229
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,600
who know can access.

230
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:04,980
Shinigami Eyes provides a single data point, whether or not you're a transphobe, that is

231
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:05,980
commonly inaccurate.

232
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:10,460
At a quick glance, Dissenter provided whole conversations worth of information from multiple

233
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:13,140
sources if you had the inclination to read it all.

234
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:16,620
There's nothing actually wrong with either of them, but it's telling who objects to which

235
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:17,620
and why.

236
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:20,820
See, in the end, I actually don't care that people seriously use Shinigami Eyes.

237
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:23,860
I find it cringe, but you've got the right to be as cringe as you want, and I've got

238
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:25,260
the right to troll cringey people.

239
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:26,340
So it all works out.

240
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:27,620
And uh, speaking of that...

241
00:11:56,340 --> 00:12:05,620
I'll see you next time.
