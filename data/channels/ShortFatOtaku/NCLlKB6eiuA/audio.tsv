0	7760	Let's talk about Shinagami Eyes.
7760	11620	Shinagami Eyes is a plugin, mainly known for its use on Twitter, but it does work anywhere
11620	16500	on the internet, that highlights transphobic individuals' names in red, and trans-positive
16500	17500	names in green.
17500	19580	That's pretty much it, it's quite simple.
19580	23540	But the context surrounding the name of the plugin, Shinagami Eyes, holds a lot of hidden
23540	24540	meaning.
24540	26760	I'll very quickly go over it because those who know don't need to be told.
26760	30360	Death Note is a pretty good anime from 2006, it's one of those shows that everybody should
30360	32580	watch, though as always, skip the Netflix adaptation.
32580	36720	The TLDR is, Light Yagami is a Japanese high school student who finds a magical notebook,
36720	38000	the titular Death Note.
38000	41380	What makes it magical is that if you write somebody's name in the book while picturing
41380	43360	their face in your mind, they die.
43360	47260	Light is an athletic, attractive, charismatic super genius, who is bored with the world
47260	48880	and views other people as beneath him.
48880	52200	Couple that with his own very retributive sense of morality, and he decides to use the
52200	56160	powers of the Death Note to begin to systematically kill every criminal on the planet, in order
56160	57440	to bring about the utopia.
57440	58620	This is where the Shinagami come in.
58620	61840	Shinagami means Death God in Japanese, and there's a wide variety of interpretations
61840	65940	of them in their culture, but Death Note uses them the way that we'd use Angel of Death,
65940	69760	a being responsible for the orderliness of death, who comes for those when their time
69760	71940	is up and brings their soul to the afterlife.
71940	74600	The Shinagami are the owners of the Death Notes, the tools of their trade.
74600	78040	They invisibly move about the world with the ability to see the names of people floating
78040	81740	above their heads, along with a timer counting down the remainder of their natural life.
81740	84520	In this way the Shinagami know whose turn it is to die.
84520	88320	But if a human happens to acquire a Death Note, its corresponding Shinagami becomes
88320	89720	their invisible companion.
89720	93360	One of the perks a Shinagami might offer to their new human is the Shinagami eyes.
93360	97760	In exchange for half of the human's remaining natural life, the human gains the power to
97760	101900	see the world as the Shinagami do, with the names and times above everybody's heads.
101900	105240	It sort of looks like the way Google Glass was supposed to operate, or like the scanning
105240	106680	from the Watchdog games.
106680	110880	And they all appeal to that same idea, that you can walk through society appearing normal
110880	115040	while you exist half in another plane, learning people's secrets simply by looking at them.
115040	118740	Death Note is the kind of show that came out at just the right time and was just edgy and
118740	123160	smart enough that a lot of the terminally online trans twitter crowd nowadays absolutely
123160	125400	worship it as part of their formative years.
125400	129960	And so I am not surprised that they would name their transphobe detector software Shinagami
129960	130960	Eyes.
130960	133800	The implication that there is this secret underpinning of reality that only the special
133800	137960	few have access to, that they can peer beyond the veil and see the truth beneath people's
137960	139840	hearts with their unique trans powers.
139840	142780	That shit is right up their Mary Sue special snowflake alley.
142780	146240	Of course, how the plugin works is, there's a database of names, and people are rated
146240	149380	by users of the app on how more or less transphobic they are.
149380	153360	So if you see a green name, that means that people rated that person as trans positive.
153360	156880	You see a red name, that means that people rated that person as transphobic.
156880	159320	It's kind of like that Lulu app, if you remember that controversy.
159320	161720	Back in 2013, the Lulu app was launched.
161720	163520	It was a way for women to rate men.
163520	166500	It was considered a side app to Tinder, launched in 2012.
166500	170220	And piggybacking off that app's success, if you were a girl and you approved of meeting
170220	173880	a guy on Tinder, you could hop over to Lulu and see what other girls thought of him.
173880	178460	For a time, Lulu was also considered this secret exclusive network running beneath Tinder
178460	180340	while still being an unofficial part of it.
180340	184080	And when it finally became public knowledge, the men who were on it found it rather demeaning
184080	186300	that they were being catalogued by their intimate partners.
186300	190320	The resulting controversy saw Lulu fall into disuse, and the company was eventually sold
190320	191320	off in 2016.
191320	194100	Also, because we're not coming back to Death Note again in this video, and when the hell
194100	195100	am I going to talk about this again?
195100	200280	The 2019 Death Note one-shot Donald Trump as President of the United States pays one
200280	205260	quadrillion yen to obtain a new Death Note, but declines to use it, simply opting to keep
205260	206980	it out of China's hands.
206980	207980	Based.
207980	211580	So even though I'm not trans, I decided to install Shinigami eyes.
211580	212580	Because why not?
212580	215820	Why not see the world the way that those terminally online Twitter trans people see it?
215820	217920	I'm sure there's going to be a few of them who screech at the idea.
217920	219220	How dare I pop their bubble?
219220	221320	How dare somebody like me use their tools?
221320	222320	But uh, fuck it.
222320	226040	Alright, here we are on Twitter.com, let's take a look at who I'm following, and who's
226040	227040	marked what.
227040	230800	Nothing so far, nothing so far, oh, Simpneelix.
230800	233760	Simpneelix is the first.
233760	235000	Why this account?
235000	238640	Simpneelix is the first casualty as apparently being transphobic.
238640	245520	Zachrabbit is red, Yizz, Yizz is red, again not surprised, Gamby is red, Gamby is a trans
245520	246520	woman.
246520	249320	Anti-fascist, rad lib content creator, trans woman.
249320	254160	Anivelens is predictably marked as green, though keep that name in mind for later.
254160	256200	People whining about stone toss.
256200	258600	Even gimmick accounts aren't safe from Shinigami eyes.
258600	261320	9V green, I wonder if all the feet pics helped him out.
261320	263200	Riley is green, no surprise there.
263200	266320	If you're marked as green it doesn't mean that you're just a woke scold and that's it.
266320	270280	For green it's about 50% chance you're a woke scold, 50% chance you're actually pretty cool.
270280	274200	The left can't meme, of course, is marked red.
274200	278440	But then again, so is Erika, the super lesbian, I guess because she doesn't want to suck the
278440	279440	dick bigot.
279440	281200	She's a transphobe, alright.
281200	283200	The Real Daily Wire, marked red.
283200	284800	Alan Bocari, marked red.
284800	287000	Breitbart, marked red, no surprises here.
287000	288400	Colin Borisenko is red.
288400	290560	I never, like is she anti-trans?
290560	292320	I didn't think she was.
292320	294740	Sinatra Says is red.
294740	295840	What did Sinatra do?
295840	298200	Zuby's red, there's no surprises there.
298200	299200	Hold on, hold on, hold on.
299200	303160	Babylon Bee is red?
303160	304160	Are they a comedy say?
304160	305680	Aren't they news parody?
305680	311520	Pink Spot, that's Jordan Peterson's attempt to make a social media platform, right?
311520	313720	It's a transphobic platform?
313720	315160	Is that the implication here?
315160	318800	Oh shit, Dr. Diddler, one of the mods over at Adam and Stitch.
318800	320800	I guess he's a transphobe, shit.
320800	323480	The Corridoring and his editor are both red.
323480	324840	Nobody's surprised with this, right?
324840	326520	Razorfist is marked red.
326520	330800	At this point I'm just kind of wondering if they're marking red anybody who like makes
330800	333240	a joke at the expense of trans people.
333240	337360	Of course, a lot of the more cucked online personalities are green, Markiplier's green,
337360	339720	Egoraptor's green, Moviebob is green.
339720	342560	Oh shit, V and Stix are red.
342560	344320	Oh my God, guys, I didn't know.
344320	348120	Why didn't you tell me that you wanted to exterminate the trans population?
348120	354360	Lauren Southern, Jordan Peterson, Joe Rogan, Notch, Brett Weinstein, Christina Hoff Sommers,
354360	359280	William Shatner, Red Red, Red Red Red Red Red, Arielle Scarcella, or whatever, however
359280	361040	you pronounce her last name, I don't know.
361040	364640	Queen of Controversial Conversations and Lesbian, yeah, I really do think that for
364640	368320	a lot of these people, especially if they're cis women, it's going to be a suck the dick
368320	369680	bigot situation.
369680	374600	Titania McGrath, they are in fact calling satirical humor transphobic.
374600	382280	Oh damn, dude, the elf porn account and Aiden Paladin and CafeBeef, she's trans herself.
382280	384480	The world's just full of transphobes, dude, shit.
384480	388040	The more I look at this list, the more I'm realizing that if someone's marked red, they
388040	393600	may or may not be transphobic, but it's much more likely that they're just an interesting
393600	395800	person, or at least somebody who understands the nature of humor.
395800	399920	Just out of curiosity, I decided to hit up the alt-right page on Wikipedia.
399920	405760	Of course, we got Richard Spencer labeled, The Daily Stormer, Steve Bannon, Donald Trump,
405760	406760	Ayn Rand.
406760	408760	Was Ayn Rand anti-trans?
408760	410880	I mean, I don't know.
410880	412120	I don't know enough about her.
412120	414240	Vladimir Putin, David Duke.
414240	416920	Oh, this article has Margaret Atwood as green.
416920	418800	I guess the app hasn't caught up yet.
418800	419800	She's a transphobe now.
419800	421280	I don't know if you've heard the recent news.
421280	423880	There is a little bit I wanted to show you on the Gab Wikipedia as well.
423880	426340	Yeah, the entire site of Gab is marked as red.
426340	427340	Check this out.
427340	433400	Tim Pool, Dave Rubin, British National Party, Allen West, Richard Spencer, Mark Meechan,
433400	439760	that's Dankula, and Carl Benjamin, Sargon, Sargon, you're spared.
439760	443040	You're not transphobic, but Jess Phillips is.
443040	447960	Okay, there's one last thing I got to look up, all right?
447960	449960	Just bear with me.
449960	454200	Oh shit, dude.
454200	458000	They labeled Hitler as being transphobic.
458000	460840	I totally needed the app to figure this out.
460840	462840	Actually, I don't know.
462840	468400	Was there a modern conception of transness, you know, back in the 1930s and 1940s?
468400	475840	In fact, in the article on Nazism, the only red links are Adolf Hitler, Nazi Party, and
475840	479820	if you keep scrolling down, none of these names, none of these organizations have anything
479820	485620	on here, and you have one more red link, Joseph Stalin.
485620	489400	This is literally just an interactive list of people they don't like.
489400	490640	That's all it is.
490640	491960	There's nothing more to it than that.
491960	496000	Now, as fun as this all is, I've known about Shinigami Eyes for maybe a year now, maybe
496000	497000	a little bit less.
497000	499720	Something came out, but I remember hearing about it on Twitter for a while now.
499720	503080	Whenever it was talked about, it was always in the vein of, hey, hey, hey, the silly cis
503080	507520	people don't know that we can see them, and now that the normies have finally caught up,
507520	509960	they're all screeching and spouting nonsense.
509960	514320	Jordan Tildesly wrote an article about the app called Redlisted, stating that the browser
514320	518080	extension Shinigami Eyes color codes names on the wrong side of history.
518080	521840	This week, I had the audacity to suggest on Twitter that antisemitism remains a problem
521840	526640	within someone on the left, well, it does, and that led me down an extraordinary and
526640	528040	terrifying rabbit hole.
528040	530400	Welcome to the online world of Shinigami Eyes.
530400	534080	I received a notification from one Twitter user alerting another to the fact that Shinigami
534080	540600	Eyes shows me as a transphobe, with a link to the page shinigami-slash-eyes-dot-github-dot-io.
540600	543320	Confused, I clicked on the link and made a startling discovery.
543320	546760	It's a database of people who are being recorded for their views without their knowledge or
546760	547760	consent.
547760	551160	Shinigami Eyes uses a combination of user contributions and algorithms to decide your
551160	552160	fate.
552160	554560	Anyone who installs it can type your name into a search engine and form an opinion of
554560	556280	you based on the color you've been assigned.
556280	559800	You have involuntarily joined a database which includes information about you for others
559800	560800	to inspect.
560800	565320	Yeah, see, I wonder if progressives like Jordan here complained when it was them on
565320	567200	Lulu talking about men.
567200	569920	Probably not, frankly, but now that the shoe isn't on the other foot, I guess it's a
569920	570920	problem.
570920	571920	Forget about Lulu, though.
571920	575440	There's a far more popular add-on that once upon a time added an extra layer to your browsing
575440	579480	experience, an add-on that progressives decried as being a hotbed of fascism and bigotry and
579480	580480	whatever else.
580480	581480	It was called...
581480	582480	Dissenter.
582480	583480	Remember that?
583480	584480	I made a video on it back in the day.
584480	587280	Dissenter was a Chrome extension made by Gab that added a comment section to every single
587280	588320	page of the internet.
588320	591620	The comments were stored on Gab's servers and were sorted by URL, so whenever you were
591620	594840	on any page, you could open up Dissenter and see what people were saying about it.
594840	599200	It blew up rapidly back in 2019, until Google moved to kill it from working on Chromium
599200	600200	based browsers.
600200	604560	In practice, it was a far superior Shinigami Eyes in that it also acted as an underlayer
604560	608480	of the internet that only those in the know could access, which transmitted extra information
608480	611920	to the user, but this time it allowed for whole conversations to happen on there.
611920	612920	Same principle.
612920	613920	Better implementation.
613920	616920	And... everybody lost their fucking minds at Dissenter.
616920	620080	How dare you comment on articles when we specifically shut the comments off?
620080	621080	Who do you think you are?
621080	624680	How dare you leave notes in Dissenter on my tweets that I can't see unless I install your
624680	626360	racist transphobic app?
626360	630120	How dare you talk to each other or trade information in a way that we don't approve of?
630120	633160	Probably the silliest take of all came from Anna Valens over the Daily Dot, who called
633160	637520	it a far-right comment section for hating on journalists and the home of all things
637520	639000	gamergate and MAGA.
639000	641640	Geez, even back then gamergate was five years old.
641640	642640	Give it up.
642640	646600	When they create a secret shadow layer of the internet, it's an empowering tool to help
646600	649600	others, to label people as problematic and safely exile them.
649600	651600	But when others do it, it's an alt-right recruiting tool.
651600	652920	It's a hotbed for fascism.
652920	656280	In actuality, though, Dissenter and Shinigami Eyes are cut from the same cloth, in that
656280	660160	they contribute hidden knowledge layered atop a regular internet experience that only those
660160	661600	who know can access.
661600	664980	Shinigami Eyes provides a single data point, whether or not you're a transphobe, that is
664980	665980	commonly inaccurate.
665980	670460	At a quick glance, Dissenter provided whole conversations worth of information from multiple
670460	673140	sources if you had the inclination to read it all.
673140	676620	There's nothing actually wrong with either of them, but it's telling who objects to which
676620	677620	and why.
677620	680820	See, in the end, I actually don't care that people seriously use Shinigami Eyes.
680820	683860	I find it cringe, but you've got the right to be as cringe as you want, and I've got
683860	685260	the right to troll cringey people.
685260	686340	So it all works out.
686340	687620	And uh, speaking of that...
716340	725620	I'll see you next time.
