00:00.000 --> 00:07.760
Let's talk about Shinagami Eyes.

00:07.760 --> 00:11.620
Shinagami Eyes is a plugin, mainly known for its use on Twitter, but it does work anywhere

00:11.620 --> 00:16.500
on the internet, that highlights transphobic individuals' names in red, and trans-positive

00:16.500 --> 00:17.500
names in green.

00:17.500 --> 00:19.580
That's pretty much it, it's quite simple.

00:19.580 --> 00:23.540
But the context surrounding the name of the plugin, Shinagami Eyes, holds a lot of hidden

00:23.540 --> 00:24.540
meaning.

00:24.540 --> 00:26.760
I'll very quickly go over it because those who know don't need to be told.

00:26.760 --> 00:30.360
Death Note is a pretty good anime from 2006, it's one of those shows that everybody should

00:30.360 --> 00:32.580
watch, though as always, skip the Netflix adaptation.

00:32.580 --> 00:36.720
The TLDR is, Light Yagami is a Japanese high school student who finds a magical notebook,

00:36.720 --> 00:38.000
the titular Death Note.

00:38.000 --> 00:41.380
What makes it magical is that if you write somebody's name in the book while picturing

00:41.380 --> 00:43.360
their face in your mind, they die.

00:43.360 --> 00:47.260
Light is an athletic, attractive, charismatic super genius, who is bored with the world

00:47.260 --> 00:48.880
and views other people as beneath him.

00:48.880 --> 00:52.200
Couple that with his own very retributive sense of morality, and he decides to use the

00:52.200 --> 00:56.160
powers of the Death Note to begin to systematically kill every criminal on the planet, in order

00:56.160 --> 00:57.440
to bring about the utopia.

00:57.440 --> 00:58.620
This is where the Shinagami come in.

00:58.620 --> 01:01.840
Shinagami means Death God in Japanese, and there's a wide variety of interpretations

01:01.840 --> 01:05.940
of them in their culture, but Death Note uses them the way that we'd use Angel of Death,

01:05.940 --> 01:09.760
a being responsible for the orderliness of death, who comes for those when their time

01:09.760 --> 01:11.940
is up and brings their soul to the afterlife.

01:11.940 --> 01:14.600
The Shinagami are the owners of the Death Notes, the tools of their trade.

01:14.600 --> 01:18.040
They invisibly move about the world with the ability to see the names of people floating

01:18.040 --> 01:21.740
above their heads, along with a timer counting down the remainder of their natural life.

01:21.740 --> 01:24.520
In this way the Shinagami know whose turn it is to die.

01:24.520 --> 01:28.320
But if a human happens to acquire a Death Note, its corresponding Shinagami becomes

01:28.320 --> 01:29.720
their invisible companion.

01:29.720 --> 01:33.360
One of the perks a Shinagami might offer to their new human is the Shinagami eyes.

01:33.360 --> 01:37.760
In exchange for half of the human's remaining natural life, the human gains the power to

01:37.760 --> 01:41.900
see the world as the Shinagami do, with the names and times above everybody's heads.

01:41.900 --> 01:45.240
It sort of looks like the way Google Glass was supposed to operate, or like the scanning

01:45.240 --> 01:46.680
from the Watchdog games.

01:46.680 --> 01:50.880
And they all appeal to that same idea, that you can walk through society appearing normal

01:50.880 --> 01:55.040
while you exist half in another plane, learning people's secrets simply by looking at them.

01:55.040 --> 01:58.740
Death Note is the kind of show that came out at just the right time and was just edgy and

01:58.740 --> 02:03.160
smart enough that a lot of the terminally online trans twitter crowd nowadays absolutely

02:03.160 --> 02:05.400
worship it as part of their formative years.

02:05.400 --> 02:09.960
And so I am not surprised that they would name their transphobe detector software Shinagami

02:09.960 --> 02:10.960
Eyes.

02:10.960 --> 02:13.800
The implication that there is this secret underpinning of reality that only the special

02:13.800 --> 02:17.960
few have access to, that they can peer beyond the veil and see the truth beneath people's

02:17.960 --> 02:19.840
hearts with their unique trans powers.

02:19.840 --> 02:22.780
That shit is right up their Mary Sue special snowflake alley.

02:22.780 --> 02:26.240
Of course, how the plugin works is, there's a database of names, and people are rated

02:26.240 --> 02:29.380
by users of the app on how more or less transphobic they are.

02:29.380 --> 02:33.360
So if you see a green name, that means that people rated that person as trans positive.

02:33.360 --> 02:36.880
You see a red name, that means that people rated that person as transphobic.

02:36.880 --> 02:39.320
It's kind of like that Lulu app, if you remember that controversy.

02:39.320 --> 02:41.720
Back in 2013, the Lulu app was launched.

02:41.720 --> 02:43.520
It was a way for women to rate men.

02:43.520 --> 02:46.500
It was considered a side app to Tinder, launched in 2012.

02:46.500 --> 02:50.220
And piggybacking off that app's success, if you were a girl and you approved of meeting

02:50.220 --> 02:53.880
a guy on Tinder, you could hop over to Lulu and see what other girls thought of him.

02:53.880 --> 02:58.460
For a time, Lulu was also considered this secret exclusive network running beneath Tinder

02:58.460 --> 03:00.340
while still being an unofficial part of it.

03:00.340 --> 03:04.080
And when it finally became public knowledge, the men who were on it found it rather demeaning

03:04.080 --> 03:06.300
that they were being catalogued by their intimate partners.

03:06.300 --> 03:10.320
The resulting controversy saw Lulu fall into disuse, and the company was eventually sold

03:10.320 --> 03:11.320
off in 2016.

03:11.320 --> 03:14.100
Also, because we're not coming back to Death Note again in this video, and when the hell

03:14.100 --> 03:15.100
am I going to talk about this again?

03:15.100 --> 03:20.280
The 2019 Death Note one-shot Donald Trump as President of the United States pays one

03:20.280 --> 03:25.260
quadrillion yen to obtain a new Death Note, but declines to use it, simply opting to keep

03:25.260 --> 03:26.980
it out of China's hands.

03:26.980 --> 03:27.980
Based.

03:27.980 --> 03:31.580
So even though I'm not trans, I decided to install Shinigami eyes.

03:31.580 --> 03:32.580
Because why not?

03:32.580 --> 03:35.820
Why not see the world the way that those terminally online Twitter trans people see it?

03:35.820 --> 03:37.920
I'm sure there's going to be a few of them who screech at the idea.

03:37.920 --> 03:39.220
How dare I pop their bubble?

03:39.220 --> 03:41.320
How dare somebody like me use their tools?

03:41.320 --> 03:42.320
But uh, fuck it.

03:42.320 --> 03:46.040
Alright, here we are on Twitter.com, let's take a look at who I'm following, and who's

03:46.040 --> 03:47.040
marked what.

03:47.040 --> 03:50.800
Nothing so far, nothing so far, oh, Simpneelix.

03:50.800 --> 03:53.760
Simpneelix is the first.

03:53.760 --> 03:55.000
Why this account?

03:55.000 --> 03:58.640
Simpneelix is the first casualty as apparently being transphobic.

03:58.640 --> 04:05.520
Zachrabbit is red, Yizz, Yizz is red, again not surprised, Gamby is red, Gamby is a trans

04:05.520 --> 04:06.520
woman.

04:06.520 --> 04:09.320
Anti-fascist, rad lib content creator, trans woman.

04:09.320 --> 04:14.160
Anivelens is predictably marked as green, though keep that name in mind for later.

04:14.160 --> 04:16.200
People whining about stone toss.

04:16.200 --> 04:18.600
Even gimmick accounts aren't safe from Shinigami eyes.

04:18.600 --> 04:21.320
9V green, I wonder if all the feet pics helped him out.

04:21.320 --> 04:23.200
Riley is green, no surprise there.

04:23.200 --> 04:26.320
If you're marked as green it doesn't mean that you're just a woke scold and that's it.

04:26.320 --> 04:30.280
For green it's about 50% chance you're a woke scold, 50% chance you're actually pretty cool.

04:30.280 --> 04:34.200
The left can't meme, of course, is marked red.

04:34.200 --> 04:38.440
But then again, so is Erika, the super lesbian, I guess because she doesn't want to suck the

04:38.440 --> 04:39.440
dick bigot.

04:39.440 --> 04:41.200
She's a transphobe, alright.

04:41.200 --> 04:43.200
The Real Daily Wire, marked red.

04:43.200 --> 04:44.800
Alan Bocari, marked red.

04:44.800 --> 04:47.000
Breitbart, marked red, no surprises here.

04:47.000 --> 04:48.400
Colin Borisenko is red.

04:48.400 --> 04:50.560
I never, like is she anti-trans?

04:50.560 --> 04:52.320
I didn't think she was.

04:52.320 --> 04:54.740
Sinatra Says is red.

04:54.740 --> 04:55.840
What did Sinatra do?

04:55.840 --> 04:58.200
Zuby's red, there's no surprises there.

04:58.200 --> 04:59.200
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

04:59.200 --> 05:03.160
Babylon Bee is red?

05:03.160 --> 05:04.160
Are they a comedy say?

05:04.160 --> 05:05.680
Aren't they news parody?

05:05.680 --> 05:11.520
Pink Spot, that's Jordan Peterson's attempt to make a social media platform, right?

05:11.520 --> 05:13.720
It's a transphobic platform?

05:13.720 --> 05:15.160
Is that the implication here?

05:15.160 --> 05:18.800
Oh shit, Dr. Diddler, one of the mods over at Adam and Stitch.

05:18.800 --> 05:20.800
I guess he's a transphobe, shit.

05:20.800 --> 05:23.480
The Corridoring and his editor are both red.

05:23.480 --> 05:24.840
Nobody's surprised with this, right?

05:24.840 --> 05:26.520
Razorfist is marked red.

05:26.520 --> 05:30.800
At this point I'm just kind of wondering if they're marking red anybody who like makes

05:30.800 --> 05:33.240
a joke at the expense of trans people.

05:33.240 --> 05:37.360
Of course, a lot of the more cucked online personalities are green, Markiplier's green,

05:37.360 --> 05:39.720
Egoraptor's green, Moviebob is green.

05:39.720 --> 05:42.560
Oh shit, V and Stix are red.

05:42.560 --> 05:44.320
Oh my God, guys, I didn't know.

05:44.320 --> 05:48.120
Why didn't you tell me that you wanted to exterminate the trans population?

05:48.120 --> 05:54.360
Lauren Southern, Jordan Peterson, Joe Rogan, Notch, Brett Weinstein, Christina Hoff Sommers,

05:54.360 --> 05:59.280
William Shatner, Red Red, Red Red Red Red Red, Arielle Scarcella, or whatever, however

05:59.280 --> 06:01.040
you pronounce her last name, I don't know.

06:01.040 --> 06:04.640
Queen of Controversial Conversations and Lesbian, yeah, I really do think that for

06:04.640 --> 06:08.320
a lot of these people, especially if they're cis women, it's going to be a suck the dick

06:08.320 --> 06:09.680
bigot situation.

06:09.680 --> 06:14.600
Titania McGrath, they are in fact calling satirical humor transphobic.

06:14.600 --> 06:22.280
Oh damn, dude, the elf porn account and Aiden Paladin and CafeBeef, she's trans herself.

06:22.280 --> 06:24.480
The world's just full of transphobes, dude, shit.

06:24.480 --> 06:28.040
The more I look at this list, the more I'm realizing that if someone's marked red, they

06:28.040 --> 06:33.600
may or may not be transphobic, but it's much more likely that they're just an interesting

06:33.600 --> 06:35.800
person, or at least somebody who understands the nature of humor.

06:35.800 --> 06:39.920
Just out of curiosity, I decided to hit up the alt-right page on Wikipedia.

06:39.920 --> 06:45.760
Of course, we got Richard Spencer labeled, The Daily Stormer, Steve Bannon, Donald Trump,

06:45.760 --> 06:46.760
Ayn Rand.

06:46.760 --> 06:48.760
Was Ayn Rand anti-trans?

06:48.760 --> 06:50.880
I mean, I don't know.

06:50.880 --> 06:52.120
I don't know enough about her.

06:52.120 --> 06:54.240
Vladimir Putin, David Duke.

06:54.240 --> 06:56.920
Oh, this article has Margaret Atwood as green.

06:56.920 --> 06:58.800
I guess the app hasn't caught up yet.

06:58.800 --> 06:59.800
She's a transphobe now.

06:59.800 --> 07:01.280
I don't know if you've heard the recent news.

07:01.280 --> 07:03.880
There is a little bit I wanted to show you on the Gab Wikipedia as well.

07:03.880 --> 07:06.340
Yeah, the entire site of Gab is marked as red.

07:06.340 --> 07:07.340
Check this out.

07:07.340 --> 07:13.400
Tim Pool, Dave Rubin, British National Party, Allen West, Richard Spencer, Mark Meechan,

07:13.400 --> 07:19.760
that's Dankula, and Carl Benjamin, Sargon, Sargon, you're spared.

07:19.760 --> 07:23.040
You're not transphobic, but Jess Phillips is.

07:23.040 --> 07:27.960
Okay, there's one last thing I got to look up, all right?

07:27.960 --> 07:29.960
Just bear with me.

07:29.960 --> 07:34.200
Oh shit, dude.

07:34.200 --> 07:38.000
They labeled Hitler as being transphobic.

07:38.000 --> 07:40.840
I totally needed the app to figure this out.

07:40.840 --> 07:42.840
Actually, I don't know.

07:42.840 --> 07:48.400
Was there a modern conception of transness, you know, back in the 1930s and 1940s?

07:48.400 --> 07:55.840
In fact, in the article on Nazism, the only red links are Adolf Hitler, Nazi Party, and

07:55.840 --> 07:59.820
if you keep scrolling down, none of these names, none of these organizations have anything

07:59.820 --> 08:05.620
on here, and you have one more red link, Joseph Stalin.

08:05.620 --> 08:09.400
This is literally just an interactive list of people they don't like.

08:09.400 --> 08:10.640
That's all it is.

08:10.640 --> 08:11.960
There's nothing more to it than that.

08:11.960 --> 08:16.000
Now, as fun as this all is, I've known about Shinigami Eyes for maybe a year now, maybe

08:16.000 --> 08:17.000
a little bit less.

08:17.000 --> 08:19.720
Something came out, but I remember hearing about it on Twitter for a while now.

08:19.720 --> 08:23.080
Whenever it was talked about, it was always in the vein of, hey, hey, hey, the silly cis

08:23.080 --> 08:27.520
people don't know that we can see them, and now that the normies have finally caught up,

08:27.520 --> 08:29.960
they're all screeching and spouting nonsense.

08:29.960 --> 08:34.320
Jordan Tildesly wrote an article about the app called Redlisted, stating that the browser

08:34.320 --> 08:38.080
extension Shinigami Eyes color codes names on the wrong side of history.

08:38.080 --> 08:41.840
This week, I had the audacity to suggest on Twitter that antisemitism remains a problem

08:41.840 --> 08:46.640
within someone on the left, well, it does, and that led me down an extraordinary and

08:46.640 --> 08:48.040
terrifying rabbit hole.

08:48.040 --> 08:50.400
Welcome to the online world of Shinigami Eyes.

08:50.400 --> 08:54.080
I received a notification from one Twitter user alerting another to the fact that Shinigami

08:54.080 --> 09:00.600
Eyes shows me as a transphobe, with a link to the page shinigami-slash-eyes-dot-github-dot-io.

09:00.600 --> 09:03.320
Confused, I clicked on the link and made a startling discovery.

09:03.320 --> 09:06.760
It's a database of people who are being recorded for their views without their knowledge or

09:06.760 --> 09:07.760
consent.

09:07.760 --> 09:11.160
Shinigami Eyes uses a combination of user contributions and algorithms to decide your

09:11.160 --> 09:12.160
fate.

09:12.160 --> 09:14.560
Anyone who installs it can type your name into a search engine and form an opinion of

09:14.560 --> 09:16.280
you based on the color you've been assigned.

09:16.280 --> 09:19.800
You have involuntarily joined a database which includes information about you for others

09:19.800 --> 09:20.800
to inspect.

09:20.800 --> 09:25.320
Yeah, see, I wonder if progressives like Jordan here complained when it was them on

09:25.320 --> 09:27.200
Lulu talking about men.

09:27.200 --> 09:29.920
Probably not, frankly, but now that the shoe isn't on the other foot, I guess it's a

09:29.920 --> 09:30.920
problem.

09:30.920 --> 09:31.920
Forget about Lulu, though.

09:31.920 --> 09:35.440
There's a far more popular add-on that once upon a time added an extra layer to your browsing

09:35.440 --> 09:39.480
experience, an add-on that progressives decried as being a hotbed of fascism and bigotry and

09:39.480 --> 09:40.480
whatever else.

09:40.480 --> 09:41.480
It was called...

09:41.480 --> 09:42.480
Dissenter.

09:42.480 --> 09:43.480
Remember that?

09:43.480 --> 09:44.480
I made a video on it back in the day.

09:44.480 --> 09:47.280
Dissenter was a Chrome extension made by Gab that added a comment section to every single

09:47.280 --> 09:48.320
page of the internet.

09:48.320 --> 09:51.620
The comments were stored on Gab's servers and were sorted by URL, so whenever you were

09:51.620 --> 09:54.840
on any page, you could open up Dissenter and see what people were saying about it.

09:54.840 --> 09:59.200
It blew up rapidly back in 2019, until Google moved to kill it from working on Chromium

09:59.200 --> 10:00.200
based browsers.

10:00.200 --> 10:04.560
In practice, it was a far superior Shinigami Eyes in that it also acted as an underlayer

10:04.560 --> 10:08.480
of the internet that only those in the know could access, which transmitted extra information

10:08.480 --> 10:11.920
to the user, but this time it allowed for whole conversations to happen on there.

10:11.920 --> 10:12.920
Same principle.

10:12.920 --> 10:13.920
Better implementation.

10:13.920 --> 10:16.920
And... everybody lost their fucking minds at Dissenter.

10:16.920 --> 10:20.080
How dare you comment on articles when we specifically shut the comments off?

10:20.080 --> 10:21.080
Who do you think you are?

10:21.080 --> 10:24.680
How dare you leave notes in Dissenter on my tweets that I can't see unless I install your

10:24.680 --> 10:26.360
racist transphobic app?

10:26.360 --> 10:30.120
How dare you talk to each other or trade information in a way that we don't approve of?

10:30.120 --> 10:33.160
Probably the silliest take of all came from Anna Valens over the Daily Dot, who called

10:33.160 --> 10:37.520
it a far-right comment section for hating on journalists and the home of all things

10:37.520 --> 10:39.000
gamergate and MAGA.

10:39.000 --> 10:41.640
Geez, even back then gamergate was five years old.

10:41.640 --> 10:42.640
Give it up.

10:42.640 --> 10:46.600
When they create a secret shadow layer of the internet, it's an empowering tool to help

10:46.600 --> 10:49.600
others, to label people as problematic and safely exile them.

10:49.600 --> 10:51.600
But when others do it, it's an alt-right recruiting tool.

10:51.600 --> 10:52.920
It's a hotbed for fascism.

10:52.920 --> 10:56.280
In actuality, though, Dissenter and Shinigami Eyes are cut from the same cloth, in that

10:56.280 --> 11:00.160
they contribute hidden knowledge layered atop a regular internet experience that only those

11:00.160 --> 11:01.600
who know can access.

11:01.600 --> 11:04.980
Shinigami Eyes provides a single data point, whether or not you're a transphobe, that is

11:04.980 --> 11:05.980
commonly inaccurate.

11:05.980 --> 11:10.460
At a quick glance, Dissenter provided whole conversations worth of information from multiple

11:10.460 --> 11:13.140
sources if you had the inclination to read it all.

11:13.140 --> 11:16.620
There's nothing actually wrong with either of them, but it's telling who objects to which

11:16.620 --> 11:17.620
and why.

11:17.620 --> 11:20.820
See, in the end, I actually don't care that people seriously use Shinigami Eyes.

11:20.820 --> 11:23.860
I find it cringe, but you've got the right to be as cringe as you want, and I've got

11:23.860 --> 11:25.260
the right to troll cringey people.

11:25.260 --> 11:26.340
So it all works out.

11:26.340 --> 11:27.620
And uh, speaking of that...

11:56.340 --> 12:05.620
I'll see you next time.
