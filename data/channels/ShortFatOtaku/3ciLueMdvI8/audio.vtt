00:00.000 --> 00:06.280
Hey guys, I sincerely have to apologize.

00:06.280 --> 00:10.980
I don't know if you can tell, I'm quite sick, again.

00:10.980 --> 00:17.520
And you know, I really feel like Naomi is a disease vector into the house, because I

00:17.520 --> 00:19.520
didn't get this sick before I met her.

00:19.520 --> 00:24.160
And whenever she comes into the house with like a sickness, we all fucking get it.

00:24.160 --> 00:26.360
So mean to me dad.

00:26.360 --> 00:27.360
God damn it Naomi.

00:27.360 --> 00:32.040
My original plan, if you had heard me talk about it, was that I had like five Canadian

00:32.040 --> 00:34.080
election videos planned.

00:34.080 --> 00:35.080
And I really did.

00:35.080 --> 00:39.800
And they're like all in various stages of work, but like this, I'm not going to be better

00:39.800 --> 00:41.720
before the election happens on Monday.

00:41.720 --> 00:44.640
I don't know what the fuck to do.

00:44.640 --> 00:47.840
Here's what I'm going to at least attempt to put out, okay?

00:47.840 --> 00:54.920
Tomorrow will be the Trouble with Trudeau 2, you know, Trouble with Trudeau 2019 edition.

00:54.920 --> 01:05.200
Sunday will be a, Sunday will be like a Canadian election guide video.

01:05.200 --> 01:11.680
So if you're undecided, I guess, you can listen to me blabber on about who I think the better

01:11.680 --> 01:12.680
candidates are.

01:12.680 --> 01:15.760
I think it's obvious who I think the better candidates are at this point, but you know

01:15.760 --> 01:17.320
what I mean.

01:17.320 --> 01:21.040
And then Monday, I might do like an election stream.

01:21.040 --> 01:27.160
I might maybe gather together a couple people from the crowd, and then we will chat about

01:27.160 --> 01:31.600
the Canadian elections as the various results roll in.

01:31.600 --> 01:35.040
I think that's going to be the plan.

01:35.040 --> 01:39.760
I had other things planned, like I have like a Canadian Islam video, I have a Canadian

01:39.760 --> 01:41.840
free speech video.

01:41.840 --> 01:46.680
Basically there's not enough time to do them, not with me in my current condition.

01:46.680 --> 01:50.440
I'm really sorry guys, I seriously tried to, I tried to pull it all together, but as it

01:50.440 --> 01:55.920
became obvious that Naomi was literally infecting fucking everything around her, it was obviously

01:55.920 --> 01:56.920
not going to happen.

01:56.920 --> 02:01.200
Well maybe you shouldn't be such a slacker when you're not infected.

02:01.200 --> 02:04.840
No Naomi, it's all your fault, don't sell me out!

02:04.840 --> 02:10.080
One thing I can do while sick is Game Boomers, because I'm literally just playing video games

02:10.080 --> 02:15.200
and I don't mind being sick for a couple hours and feeling like shit and playing video games

02:15.200 --> 02:16.200
with the Twitch chat.

02:16.200 --> 02:22.440
So if you want to swing by Twitch.tv slash Game Boomers, basically right now, I'm going

02:22.440 --> 02:24.440
to play some Halloween games with Naomi.

02:24.440 --> 02:28.440
We're going to finish up Costume Quest 2, Tim Schafer's final good game.

02:28.440 --> 02:31.800
If you're interested in that, I'll see you tomorrow with Trouble with Trudeau 2.

02:31.800 --> 02:36.000
I'm going to do my absolute best to get it out.

02:36.000 --> 02:39.640
I think I might be hitting the hump of the sickness, so maybe I'll be feeling better

02:39.640 --> 02:40.640
by tomorrow.

02:40.640 --> 02:41.640
Let's hope.

02:41.880 --> 02:46.480
Okay guys, I'll catch you next time.

02:46.480 --> 02:47.480
I love you.
