1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,280
Hey guys, I sincerely have to apologize.

2
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:10,980
I don't know if you can tell, I'm quite sick, again.

3
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:17,520
And you know, I really feel like Naomi is a disease vector into the house, because I

4
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:19,520
didn't get this sick before I met her.

5
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:24,160
And whenever she comes into the house with like a sickness, we all fucking get it.

6
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:26,360
So mean to me dad.

7
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:27,360
God damn it Naomi.

8
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:32,040
My original plan, if you had heard me talk about it, was that I had like five Canadian

9
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:34,080
election videos planned.

10
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:35,080
And I really did.

11
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:39,800
And they're like all in various stages of work, but like this, I'm not going to be better

12
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:41,720
before the election happens on Monday.

13
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:44,640
I don't know what the fuck to do.

14
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:47,840
Here's what I'm going to at least attempt to put out, okay?

15
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:54,920
Tomorrow will be the Trouble with Trudeau 2, you know, Trouble with Trudeau 2019 edition.

16
00:00:54,920 --> 00:01:05,200
Sunday will be a, Sunday will be like a Canadian election guide video.

17
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:11,680
So if you're undecided, I guess, you can listen to me blabber on about who I think the better

18
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:12,680
candidates are.

19
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:15,760
I think it's obvious who I think the better candidates are at this point, but you know

20
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:17,320
what I mean.

21
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:21,040
And then Monday, I might do like an election stream.

22
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:27,160
I might maybe gather together a couple people from the crowd, and then we will chat about

23
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:31,600
the Canadian elections as the various results roll in.

24
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:35,040
I think that's going to be the plan.

25
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:39,760
I had other things planned, like I have like a Canadian Islam video, I have a Canadian

26
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:41,840
free speech video.

27
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:46,680
Basically there's not enough time to do them, not with me in my current condition.

28
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:50,440
I'm really sorry guys, I seriously tried to, I tried to pull it all together, but as it

29
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:55,920
became obvious that Naomi was literally infecting fucking everything around her, it was obviously

30
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:56,920
not going to happen.

31
00:01:56,920 --> 00:02:01,200
Well maybe you shouldn't be such a slacker when you're not infected.

32
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,840
No Naomi, it's all your fault, don't sell me out!

33
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:10,080
One thing I can do while sick is Game Boomers, because I'm literally just playing video games

34
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:15,200
and I don't mind being sick for a couple hours and feeling like shit and playing video games

35
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,200
with the Twitch chat.

36
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:22,440
So if you want to swing by Twitch.tv slash Game Boomers, basically right now, I'm going

37
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:24,440
to play some Halloween games with Naomi.

38
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:28,440
We're going to finish up Costume Quest 2, Tim Schafer's final good game.

39
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:31,800
If you're interested in that, I'll see you tomorrow with Trouble with Trudeau 2.

40
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:36,000
I'm going to do my absolute best to get it out.

41
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,640
I think I might be hitting the hump of the sickness, so maybe I'll be feeling better

42
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:40,640
by tomorrow.

43
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:41,640
Let's hope.

44
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:46,480
Okay guys, I'll catch you next time.

45
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:47,480
I love you.
