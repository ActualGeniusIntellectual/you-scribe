0	6280	Hey guys, I sincerely have to apologize.
6280	10980	I don't know if you can tell, I'm quite sick, again.
10980	17520	And you know, I really feel like Naomi is a disease vector into the house, because I
17520	19520	didn't get this sick before I met her.
19520	24160	And whenever she comes into the house with like a sickness, we all fucking get it.
24160	26360	So mean to me dad.
26360	27360	God damn it Naomi.
27360	32040	My original plan, if you had heard me talk about it, was that I had like five Canadian
32040	34080	election videos planned.
34080	35080	And I really did.
35080	39800	And they're like all in various stages of work, but like this, I'm not going to be better
39800	41720	before the election happens on Monday.
41720	44640	I don't know what the fuck to do.
44640	47840	Here's what I'm going to at least attempt to put out, okay?
47840	54920	Tomorrow will be the Trouble with Trudeau 2, you know, Trouble with Trudeau 2019 edition.
54920	65200	Sunday will be a, Sunday will be like a Canadian election guide video.
65200	71680	So if you're undecided, I guess, you can listen to me blabber on about who I think the better
71680	72680	candidates are.
72680	75760	I think it's obvious who I think the better candidates are at this point, but you know
75760	77320	what I mean.
77320	81040	And then Monday, I might do like an election stream.
81040	87160	I might maybe gather together a couple people from the crowd, and then we will chat about
87160	91600	the Canadian elections as the various results roll in.
91600	95040	I think that's going to be the plan.
95040	99760	I had other things planned, like I have like a Canadian Islam video, I have a Canadian
99760	101840	free speech video.
101840	106680	Basically there's not enough time to do them, not with me in my current condition.
106680	110440	I'm really sorry guys, I seriously tried to, I tried to pull it all together, but as it
110440	115920	became obvious that Naomi was literally infecting fucking everything around her, it was obviously
115920	116920	not going to happen.
116920	121200	Well maybe you shouldn't be such a slacker when you're not infected.
121200	124840	No Naomi, it's all your fault, don't sell me out!
124840	130080	One thing I can do while sick is Game Boomers, because I'm literally just playing video games
130080	135200	and I don't mind being sick for a couple hours and feeling like shit and playing video games
135200	136200	with the Twitch chat.
136200	142440	So if you want to swing by Twitch.tv slash Game Boomers, basically right now, I'm going
142440	144440	to play some Halloween games with Naomi.
144440	148440	We're going to finish up Costume Quest 2, Tim Schafer's final good game.
148440	151800	If you're interested in that, I'll see you tomorrow with Trouble with Trudeau 2.
151800	156000	I'm going to do my absolute best to get it out.
156000	159640	I think I might be hitting the hump of the sickness, so maybe I'll be feeling better
159640	160640	by tomorrow.
160640	161640	Let's hope.
161880	166480	Okay guys, I'll catch you next time.
166480	167480	I love you.
