00:00.000 --> 00:09.900
This is going to be a stupid video, I can already tell.

00:09.900 --> 00:15.180
In case you haven't noticed, the past few days, people have been panic buying gasoline.

00:15.180 --> 00:20.700
They're not just filling up their vehicles, but they're also filling up gas canisters,

00:20.700 --> 00:24.300
making sure they have enough to ride out a potential shortage.

00:24.300 --> 00:30.620
And I don't know about you, but already, right off the bat, this looks like something

00:30.620 --> 00:34.080
that a game developer would put into place in a first person shooter.

00:34.080 --> 00:39.460
You know, a car full of gas tanks set in just a specific spot in the level, so that if you

00:39.460 --> 00:42.660
shoot it at the right time, you can get max combo kills.

00:42.660 --> 00:46.500
If this woman gets hit going home, she's going to take out an entire city block.

00:46.500 --> 00:48.540
But hey, people don't care about that.

00:48.540 --> 00:52.780
There's a gas shortage, so people are stocking up, making the shortage even worse.

00:52.780 --> 00:57.240
And if you can't afford gas containers like these people, well, don't worry about it.

00:57.240 --> 01:03.100
Just load up plastic totes, that'll work, right?

01:03.100 --> 01:07.460
You know, I can't believe I have to say this, gasoline evaporates very quickly.

01:07.460 --> 01:11.340
You don't even have lids for these things, I hope there's like lids in the trunk or something.

01:11.340 --> 01:16.320
Also, not only will it evaporate, it'll corrode that cheap ass plastic.

01:16.320 --> 01:22.880
And like, how do you expect to pour it into your car, lady?

01:22.880 --> 01:26.360
There's there's multiple levels of failure in this picture.

01:26.360 --> 01:34.160
And what the fuck are you doing filling like a clear, thin plastic trash bags with gasoline

01:34.160 --> 01:36.880
and throwing that in the back of your trunk?

01:36.880 --> 01:46.000
Like everything, everything that I said about the plastic tote will apply tenfold here.

01:46.000 --> 01:52.360
So yes, as it turns out, 72% of North Carolina gas stations are without fuel.

01:52.360 --> 01:56.000
Experts are warning residents to prepare for another tough day, and it's been like this

01:56.000 --> 01:59.040
for I think three or four days now, maybe even a little bit longer.

01:59.040 --> 02:00.880
And it's not just North Carolina.

02:00.880 --> 02:04.320
Hundreds of gas stations have run out of fuel, and others see massive lines as the shortage

02:04.320 --> 02:05.320
worsens.

02:05.320 --> 02:10.440
The 5,500 mile colonial pipeline has been shut down indefinitely since Friday, which

02:10.440 --> 02:14.680
would have been May 7th, after a cyber attack led its operators to cease operations of the

02:14.680 --> 02:19.320
major arteries supplying gasoline to states all throughout the southeast and mid-Atlantic

02:19.320 --> 02:20.320
regions.

02:20.320 --> 02:22.760
The company hopes to reopen most of the line by the end of the week.

02:22.760 --> 02:27.840
So the pipeline gets hacked, this somehow shuts off all of the gas flow from I think

02:27.840 --> 02:32.800
it's Texas to the to the eastern seaboard, and people start losing their minds over it.

02:32.800 --> 02:37.080
But it's not just those locations, there's a cascading effect of this.

02:37.080 --> 02:41.000
Far from the colonial pipeline, panic buying leaves Florida cities short of gas.

02:41.000 --> 02:45.300
These are people who are not necessarily even affected by this, but they hear it happening

02:45.300 --> 02:47.640
somewhere else in the nation, and so they stock up.

02:47.640 --> 02:51.320
But wait wait wait, the pipeline was hacked.

02:51.320 --> 02:57.760
That's right, a hacking group known as DarkSide, a day before the pipeline was shut down, stole

02:57.760 --> 03:00.660
around 100 gigabytes of data from the company.

03:00.660 --> 03:07.880
They then locked them out of their computers and demanded 5 million dollars in cryptocurrency,

03:07.880 --> 03:10.440
which is, as you know, untraceable.

03:10.440 --> 03:11.940
And Colonial paid them.

03:11.940 --> 03:15.720
After getting paid, the hackers provided the company with a decrypting tool to restore

03:15.720 --> 03:17.600
its disabled computer network.

03:17.600 --> 03:22.680
An audit of the pipeline three years ago found glaring problems, with the auditor saying

03:22.680 --> 03:25.440
that an 8th grader could have hacked into their system.

03:25.440 --> 03:33.120
Now Colonial has not officially said how the hackers penetrated their network, but an anonymous

03:33.120 --> 03:37.800
source at Colonial Pipeline said the hackers were able to gain access to their computer

03:37.800 --> 03:40.360
systems through a phishing scheme.

03:40.360 --> 03:46.000
According to the source, an employee clicked on a link in an email titled More Like Kansas

03:46.000 --> 03:47.000
City.

03:47.000 --> 03:52.520
The email contained an image of a large-breasted female in a Kansas City Chiefs bikini with

03:52.520 --> 03:55.360
a link promising additional pictures.

03:55.360 --> 04:01.440
So 5 million in Bitcoin, one of the biggest pipelines in the world shut down for a week,

04:01.440 --> 04:05.160
and mass panic buying over Booba.

04:05.160 --> 04:07.260
Well, probably worth it.

04:07.260 --> 04:10.180
And of course, the memes coming out of this are great.

04:10.180 --> 04:15.300
I mean, there's no reason we can't have a Coke and Mentos fueled economy instead of

04:15.300 --> 04:16.380
an oil one.

04:16.380 --> 04:21.180
Forget about totes and garbage bags, this guy's got half a basement full of gas.

04:21.180 --> 04:25.980
This idiot filled up his Hummer with five cans of gas and decided to have a smoke.

04:25.980 --> 04:28.020
You did know it's flammable, right?

04:28.020 --> 04:32.720
Considering all this craziness, the US Consumer Product Safety Commission had to come out

04:32.720 --> 04:37.220
and say, do not fill plastic bags with gasoline.

04:37.220 --> 04:40.220
Use only containers approved for fuel.

04:40.220 --> 04:45.300
Follow the gas canister manufacturer instructions for storing and transporting gasoline.

04:45.300 --> 04:49.380
When using a gas canister, never pour gasoline over or near an open flame.

04:49.380 --> 04:52.100
Man, I remember being taught this when I was like five.

04:52.100 --> 04:54.460
What the hell is wrong with people?

04:54.460 --> 04:56.660
Did you like the gas shortage?

04:56.660 --> 05:01.060
We could make it permanent by passing AOC's Green New Deal.

05:01.060 --> 05:03.440
Nobody liked the gas shortage.

05:03.440 --> 05:04.440
Nobody wanted this.

05:04.440 --> 05:06.100
What the fuck are you talking about?

05:06.100 --> 05:12.700
You're literally describing a state of emergency and you want it to be permanent.

05:12.700 --> 05:15.460
What is this acceleration ass bullshit?

05:15.460 --> 05:21.060
Because the Dark Side hacking group is based in Eastern Europe, most probably Russia, there

05:21.060 --> 05:25.580
is a lot of people on the left calling this a Russian attack against the United States.

05:25.580 --> 05:29.620
And damn, it is kind of terrifying to think that hackers, you know, half a world away

05:29.620 --> 05:33.860
can get a bit creative and cause a gas shortage in the United States.

05:33.860 --> 05:37.380
Good thing the CIA is currently promoting diversity and inclusion.

05:37.380 --> 06:03.460
I'm sure that'll help.

06:03.460 --> 06:05.660
Thanks for keeping the state safe, guys.

06:05.660 --> 06:08.340
But for real, here's the actual government response to it.

06:08.340 --> 06:12.700
Because of the fact that there's not a whole lot of other supply.

06:12.700 --> 06:18.060
Now, this particular pipeline also supplies other states, but there are other pipelines

06:18.060 --> 06:19.780
that supply their states as well.

06:19.780 --> 06:22.640
So there's more diversity in this particular region.

06:22.640 --> 06:24.700
That's where we're going to see the crunch.

06:24.700 --> 06:28.340
And this is why we are we know that we have gasoline.

06:28.340 --> 06:30.940
We just have to get it to the right places.

06:30.940 --> 06:34.380
And that's why these next couple of days I think will be challenging and we want to

06:34.380 --> 06:36.300
encourage people.

06:36.300 --> 06:39.100
It's not that we have a gasoline shortage.

06:39.100 --> 06:44.700
It's that we have this supply crunch and that things will be back to normal soon.

06:44.700 --> 06:46.500
And then we're asking people not to hoard.

06:46.500 --> 06:50.340
I got to say there's nothing that comes out of the current Biden administration that sounds

06:50.340 --> 06:51.340
truthful.

06:51.340 --> 06:54.660
A supply crunch, not a gasoline shortage.

06:54.660 --> 06:57.580
What do you think a supply crunch is?

06:57.580 --> 07:00.940
A shortage is when there is a lack of supply.

07:00.940 --> 07:06.460
Meanwhile, Biden's solution to the problem is more education spending.

07:06.460 --> 07:07.860
All right.

07:07.860 --> 07:12.540
I think that this shows that I think we have to make a greater investment in education

07:12.540 --> 07:17.100
as it relates to being able to train and graduate more people proficient in cybersecurity.

07:17.100 --> 07:23.800
Okay, I can I can kind of see the connection here, but I think the extent of the education

07:23.800 --> 07:28.360
is don't click on links promising big titties.

07:28.360 --> 07:33.200
Of course, Newt Gingrich, a bag of gasoline himself, is using the opportunity to shill

07:33.200 --> 07:35.360
for another pointless, terrible war.

07:35.360 --> 07:37.520
Nobody should be surprised by this.

07:37.520 --> 07:41.160
The former Speaker of the House called for military strikes to kill those involved in

07:41.160 --> 07:43.660
an act of war against America.

07:43.660 --> 07:48.440
Now Newt Gingrich is not part of the Democratic Party, but we all know that the Democrats

07:48.440 --> 07:50.360
have been itching for a new war.

07:50.360 --> 07:51.560
And who knows?

07:51.560 --> 07:54.920
Maybe they'll blow enough smoke up everyone's ass to finally get one going here.

07:54.920 --> 07:58.880
I'm sure the neocons would be happy to get on board by the time this became a full fledged

07:58.880 --> 07:59.880
story.

07:59.880 --> 08:00.880
However, it was over.

08:00.880 --> 08:02.560
They paid their five million in crypto.

08:02.560 --> 08:06.480
They got their computer systems back and the pipeline has now restarted.

08:06.480 --> 08:08.300
Normal service will take several days.

08:08.300 --> 08:13.760
But even now, as things return to normal, it has still sparked a round of panic buying.

08:13.760 --> 08:15.480
And that really is the real conversation here.

08:15.480 --> 08:22.320
I did a video last year on panic buying regarding back then it was getting food and toilet paper

08:22.320 --> 08:25.280
before the first wave of coronavirus hit your area.

08:25.280 --> 08:28.860
I'm sure you guys must still remember what it was like a year ago, right?

08:28.860 --> 08:32.720
Toilet paper, along with a lot of grocery staples, started getting completely wiped

08:32.720 --> 08:34.400
out in major population centers.

08:34.400 --> 08:38.580
And I was one of many people back then who were saying, ignore those who claim that prepping

08:38.580 --> 08:44.160
for coronavirus is racism and go out and buy yourself some extra food now while you still

08:44.160 --> 08:48.040
can if you live in an area where there has not yet been runs on this stuff.

08:48.040 --> 08:50.360
And I heard from a lot of you, you guys did so.

08:50.360 --> 08:54.400
You guys went out and bought like a bunch of cheap staples like beans and rice and pasta.

08:54.400 --> 08:57.420
You guys got extra toilet paper and extra cleaning supplies.

08:57.420 --> 08:59.920
And a lot of you were able to ride out that initial wave.

08:59.920 --> 09:00.920
No problem.

09:00.920 --> 09:01.920
I was too.

09:01.920 --> 09:06.080
I actually remember telling Naomi, hey, listen, uh, we've got to get like, you know, a month

09:06.080 --> 09:08.620
or two's worth of extra food here at least.

09:08.620 --> 09:09.620
And she listened to me.

09:09.620 --> 09:11.160
She was a bit skeptical, but she, but she listened to me.

09:11.160 --> 09:14.660
And then as things got worse, she was like, yeah, okay, that was the right call.

09:14.660 --> 09:16.360
We actually had so much toilet paper.

09:16.360 --> 09:21.900
We had, we had bought like triple the amount that we would use throughout an entire year.

09:21.900 --> 09:24.480
And we're still kind of going through it now.

09:24.480 --> 09:27.760
And we actually ended up giving some away to some people because, uh, like some friends

09:27.760 --> 09:30.520
didn't have any, but still I'm sure you remember what it was like.

09:30.520 --> 09:32.760
Other cleaning supplies were vanishing too.

09:32.760 --> 09:38.160
And yeah, idiots were dying after drinking hand sanitizer for, for some fucking reason.

09:38.160 --> 09:40.840
But panic buying seems to be something that we do.

09:40.840 --> 09:42.000
And of course, right.

09:42.000 --> 09:43.000
It would make sense.

09:43.000 --> 09:44.400
That's part of our psychology.

09:44.400 --> 09:47.480
We evolved in an environment of fundamental scarcity.

09:47.480 --> 09:50.880
We see many other animals saving food for lean times.

09:50.880 --> 09:55.740
And in that video, it was, it was called, I think, um, why is preparation problematic

09:55.740 --> 09:56.880
or something like that?

09:56.880 --> 10:02.360
I basically laid out the argument that a lot of socialists don't like the idea of panic

10:02.360 --> 10:08.080
buying or in general prepping for the future is because one, their ideal socialist utopia

10:08.080 --> 10:10.520
is a world where scarcity has been eliminated.

10:10.520 --> 10:14.820
And two, because a lot of them are ignorant of the nuts and bolts of, of how things work.

10:14.820 --> 10:17.600
They think we are a lot closer to that than we actually are.

10:17.600 --> 10:21.940
The number of socialists who have told me that under real socialism, there would never

10:21.940 --> 10:29.340
again be a rainy day and therefore no reason to save up for one has been rather high.

10:29.340 --> 10:33.320
The main reason I can't show you a lot of these conversations specifically is because

10:33.320 --> 10:36.880
they were with an old account that has since been banned, but I'm sure we all remember

10:36.880 --> 10:41.240
this person who said in response to people buying a little bit extra saving for a rainy

10:41.240 --> 10:44.160
day, all houses should be inspected.

10:44.160 --> 10:47.760
Anyone that has more than two weeks food should be fined heavily.

10:47.760 --> 10:49.280
After all, that's not your food.

10:49.280 --> 10:51.120
It's the people's food comrade.

10:51.120 --> 10:53.120
And you're hoarding it like a cool lock.

10:53.120 --> 10:58.000
You're being solipsistic again, socialism will always require a massive surveillance

10:58.000 --> 11:01.960
state to ensure that people are following the rules.

11:01.960 --> 11:03.680
Meanwhile, liberalism doesn't care.

11:03.680 --> 11:04.680
Yeah.

11:04.680 --> 11:06.040
There are sometimes shortages.

11:06.040 --> 11:07.920
There are sometimes bread lines.

11:07.920 --> 11:10.520
And under socialism, you sometimes get bread.

11:10.520 --> 11:15.460
Market fluctuations are inevitable and the temporary disruption of supply is not a good

11:15.460 --> 11:17.800
enough argument against liberal society.

11:17.800 --> 11:21.080
I will end off with just an idle musing here.

11:21.080 --> 11:25.120
It is really funny to me that we're currently facing this situation when this time a year

11:25.120 --> 11:29.040
ago, the value of oil actually dropped below zero.

11:29.040 --> 11:30.040
You remember that shit?

11:30.040 --> 11:31.560
That was a big story back then.

11:31.560 --> 11:35.420
I didn't cover it because it was kind of a flash in the pan thing, but I'm sure you saw

11:35.420 --> 11:36.420
it somewhere.

11:36.420 --> 11:41.660
April 2020, oil became so cheap it was less than a bottle of Coke and people who were

11:41.660 --> 11:46.000
trading barrels of oil buying with the intention to flip it, they actually started losing quite

11:46.000 --> 11:49.460
a bit of money because the price on oil was just so low.

11:49.460 --> 11:50.460
And now look at us.

11:50.460 --> 11:55.360
We have a run on oil without making any other claim about any other political situation

11:55.360 --> 11:56.700
beyond this topic.

11:56.700 --> 12:00.960
I do miss the days when oil was so cheap, we could just pull up to a gas station, fill

12:00.960 --> 12:01.960
up our tank.

12:01.960 --> 12:04.580
And if our car needed a little bit of wash, oh, it's fine.

12:04.580 --> 12:06.780
Just a splash, a little bit of gasoline on it.

12:06.780 --> 12:07.780
It'll be okay.

12:07.780 --> 12:08.780
Oh my gosh.

12:08.780 --> 12:09.780
Okay.

12:09.780 --> 12:15.700
So you go, go in and tell, yeah, somebody's are going and tell somebody she's doing the

12:15.700 --> 12:18.540
whole car and see what she's doing.

12:18.540 --> 12:22.740
Well, also think about how much money she's spending because she's running right now.

12:22.740 --> 12:24.320
This is a lot of money.

12:24.320 --> 12:27.180
This is the most expensive car wash ever.

12:27.180 --> 12:31.740
Wait, wait, actually, what do we, what do you want us to say?

12:31.740 --> 12:36.820
Say stop washing your car with gasoline, maybe.
