1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,900
This is going to be a stupid video, I can already tell.

2
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:15,180
In case you haven't noticed, the past few days, people have been panic buying gasoline.

3
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:20,700
They're not just filling up their vehicles, but they're also filling up gas canisters,

4
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:24,300
making sure they have enough to ride out a potential shortage.

5
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:30,620
And I don't know about you, but already, right off the bat, this looks like something

6
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:34,080
that a game developer would put into place in a first person shooter.

7
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:39,460
You know, a car full of gas tanks set in just a specific spot in the level, so that if you

8
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:42,660
shoot it at the right time, you can get max combo kills.

9
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:46,500
If this woman gets hit going home, she's going to take out an entire city block.

10
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:48,540
But hey, people don't care about that.

11
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:52,780
There's a gas shortage, so people are stocking up, making the shortage even worse.

12
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:57,240
And if you can't afford gas containers like these people, well, don't worry about it.

13
00:00:57,240 --> 00:01:03,100
Just load up plastic totes, that'll work, right?

14
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:07,460
You know, I can't believe I have to say this, gasoline evaporates very quickly.

15
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:11,340
You don't even have lids for these things, I hope there's like lids in the trunk or something.

16
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:16,320
Also, not only will it evaporate, it'll corrode that cheap ass plastic.

17
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:22,880
And like, how do you expect to pour it into your car, lady?

18
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:26,360
There's there's multiple levels of failure in this picture.

19
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:34,160
And what the fuck are you doing filling like a clear, thin plastic trash bags with gasoline

20
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:36,880
and throwing that in the back of your trunk?

21
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:46,000
Like everything, everything that I said about the plastic tote will apply tenfold here.

22
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:52,360
So yes, as it turns out, 72% of North Carolina gas stations are without fuel.

23
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:56,000
Experts are warning residents to prepare for another tough day, and it's been like this

24
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,040
for I think three or four days now, maybe even a little bit longer.

25
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,880
And it's not just North Carolina.

26
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:04,320
Hundreds of gas stations have run out of fuel, and others see massive lines as the shortage

27
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,320
worsens.

28
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:10,440
The 5,500 mile colonial pipeline has been shut down indefinitely since Friday, which

29
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:14,680
would have been May 7th, after a cyber attack led its operators to cease operations of the

30
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:19,320
major arteries supplying gasoline to states all throughout the southeast and mid-Atlantic

31
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:20,320
regions.

32
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:22,760
The company hopes to reopen most of the line by the end of the week.

33
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:27,840
So the pipeline gets hacked, this somehow shuts off all of the gas flow from I think

34
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:32,800
it's Texas to the to the eastern seaboard, and people start losing their minds over it.

35
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:37,080
But it's not just those locations, there's a cascading effect of this.

36
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:41,000
Far from the colonial pipeline, panic buying leaves Florida cities short of gas.

37
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,300
These are people who are not necessarily even affected by this, but they hear it happening

38
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:47,640
somewhere else in the nation, and so they stock up.

39
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:51,320
But wait wait wait, the pipeline was hacked.

40
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:57,760
That's right, a hacking group known as DarkSide, a day before the pipeline was shut down, stole

41
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:00,660
around 100 gigabytes of data from the company.

42
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:07,880
They then locked them out of their computers and demanded 5 million dollars in cryptocurrency,

43
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:10,440
which is, as you know, untraceable.

44
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:11,940
And Colonial paid them.

45
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:15,720
After getting paid, the hackers provided the company with a decrypting tool to restore

46
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:17,600
its disabled computer network.

47
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:22,680
An audit of the pipeline three years ago found glaring problems, with the auditor saying

48
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:25,440
that an 8th grader could have hacked into their system.

49
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:33,120
Now Colonial has not officially said how the hackers penetrated their network, but an anonymous

50
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:37,800
source at Colonial Pipeline said the hackers were able to gain access to their computer

51
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:40,360
systems through a phishing scheme.

52
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:46,000
According to the source, an employee clicked on a link in an email titled More Like Kansas

53
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
City.

54
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:52,520
The email contained an image of a large-breasted female in a Kansas City Chiefs bikini with

55
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:55,360
a link promising additional pictures.

56
00:03:55,360 --> 00:04:01,440
So 5 million in Bitcoin, one of the biggest pipelines in the world shut down for a week,

57
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:05,160
and mass panic buying over Booba.

58
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:07,260
Well, probably worth it.

59
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:10,180
And of course, the memes coming out of this are great.

60
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:15,300
I mean, there's no reason we can't have a Coke and Mentos fueled economy instead of

61
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:16,380
an oil one.

62
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:21,180
Forget about totes and garbage bags, this guy's got half a basement full of gas.

63
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:25,980
This idiot filled up his Hummer with five cans of gas and decided to have a smoke.

64
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:28,020
You did know it's flammable, right?

65
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:32,720
Considering all this craziness, the US Consumer Product Safety Commission had to come out

66
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:37,220
and say, do not fill plastic bags with gasoline.

67
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:40,220
Use only containers approved for fuel.

68
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:45,300
Follow the gas canister manufacturer instructions for storing and transporting gasoline.

69
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:49,380
When using a gas canister, never pour gasoline over or near an open flame.

70
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:52,100
Man, I remember being taught this when I was like five.

71
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:54,460
What the hell is wrong with people?

72
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:56,660
Did you like the gas shortage?

73
00:04:56,660 --> 00:05:01,060
We could make it permanent by passing AOC's Green New Deal.

74
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:03,440
Nobody liked the gas shortage.

75
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:04,440
Nobody wanted this.

76
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:06,100
What the fuck are you talking about?

77
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:12,700
You're literally describing a state of emergency and you want it to be permanent.

78
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:15,460
What is this acceleration ass bullshit?

79
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:21,060
Because the Dark Side hacking group is based in Eastern Europe, most probably Russia, there

80
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:25,580
is a lot of people on the left calling this a Russian attack against the United States.

81
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:29,620
And damn, it is kind of terrifying to think that hackers, you know, half a world away

82
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:33,860
can get a bit creative and cause a gas shortage in the United States.

83
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:37,380
Good thing the CIA is currently promoting diversity and inclusion.

84
00:05:37,380 --> 00:06:03,460
I'm sure that'll help.

85
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:05,660
Thanks for keeping the state safe, guys.

86
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:08,340
But for real, here's the actual government response to it.

87
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:12,700
Because of the fact that there's not a whole lot of other supply.

88
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:18,060
Now, this particular pipeline also supplies other states, but there are other pipelines

89
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:19,780
that supply their states as well.

90
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:22,640
So there's more diversity in this particular region.

91
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:24,700
That's where we're going to see the crunch.

92
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:28,340
And this is why we are we know that we have gasoline.

93
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:30,940
We just have to get it to the right places.

94
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:34,380
And that's why these next couple of days I think will be challenging and we want to

95
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:36,300
encourage people.

96
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:39,100
It's not that we have a gasoline shortage.

97
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:44,700
It's that we have this supply crunch and that things will be back to normal soon.

98
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:46,500
And then we're asking people not to hoard.

99
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:50,340
I got to say there's nothing that comes out of the current Biden administration that sounds

100
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:51,340
truthful.

101
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:54,660
A supply crunch, not a gasoline shortage.

102
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:57,580
What do you think a supply crunch is?

103
00:06:57,580 --> 00:07:00,940
A shortage is when there is a lack of supply.

104
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:06,460
Meanwhile, Biden's solution to the problem is more education spending.

105
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:07,860
All right.

106
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:12,540
I think that this shows that I think we have to make a greater investment in education

107
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:17,100
as it relates to being able to train and graduate more people proficient in cybersecurity.

108
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:23,800
Okay, I can I can kind of see the connection here, but I think the extent of the education

109
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:28,360
is don't click on links promising big titties.

110
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:33,200
Of course, Newt Gingrich, a bag of gasoline himself, is using the opportunity to shill

111
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:35,360
for another pointless, terrible war.

112
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,520
Nobody should be surprised by this.

113
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:41,160
The former Speaker of the House called for military strikes to kill those involved in

114
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:43,660
an act of war against America.

115
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:48,440
Now Newt Gingrich is not part of the Democratic Party, but we all know that the Democrats

116
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:50,360
have been itching for a new war.

117
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:51,560
And who knows?

118
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:54,920
Maybe they'll blow enough smoke up everyone's ass to finally get one going here.

119
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:58,880
I'm sure the neocons would be happy to get on board by the time this became a full fledged

120
00:07:58,880 --> 00:07:59,880
story.

121
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:00,880
However, it was over.

122
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,560
They paid their five million in crypto.

123
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:06,480
They got their computer systems back and the pipeline has now restarted.

124
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:08,300
Normal service will take several days.

125
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:13,760
But even now, as things return to normal, it has still sparked a round of panic buying.

126
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:15,480
And that really is the real conversation here.

127
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:22,320
I did a video last year on panic buying regarding back then it was getting food and toilet paper

128
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:25,280
before the first wave of coronavirus hit your area.

129
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:28,860
I'm sure you guys must still remember what it was like a year ago, right?

130
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:32,720
Toilet paper, along with a lot of grocery staples, started getting completely wiped

131
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,400
out in major population centers.

132
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:38,580
And I was one of many people back then who were saying, ignore those who claim that prepping

133
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:44,160
for coronavirus is racism and go out and buy yourself some extra food now while you still

134
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:48,040
can if you live in an area where there has not yet been runs on this stuff.

135
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:50,360
And I heard from a lot of you, you guys did so.

136
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:54,400
You guys went out and bought like a bunch of cheap staples like beans and rice and pasta.

137
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:57,420
You guys got extra toilet paper and extra cleaning supplies.

138
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:59,920
And a lot of you were able to ride out that initial wave.

139
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:00,920
No problem.

140
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:01,920
I was too.

141
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:06,080
I actually remember telling Naomi, hey, listen, uh, we've got to get like, you know, a month

142
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,620
or two's worth of extra food here at least.

143
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:09,620
And she listened to me.

144
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:11,160
She was a bit skeptical, but she, but she listened to me.

145
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:14,660
And then as things got worse, she was like, yeah, okay, that was the right call.

146
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:16,360
We actually had so much toilet paper.

147
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:21,900
We had, we had bought like triple the amount that we would use throughout an entire year.

148
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:24,480
And we're still kind of going through it now.

149
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:27,760
And we actually ended up giving some away to some people because, uh, like some friends

150
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:30,520
didn't have any, but still I'm sure you remember what it was like.

151
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:32,760
Other cleaning supplies were vanishing too.

152
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:38,160
And yeah, idiots were dying after drinking hand sanitizer for, for some fucking reason.

153
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,840
But panic buying seems to be something that we do.

154
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,000
And of course, right.

155
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
It would make sense.

156
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,400
That's part of our psychology.

157
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:47,480
We evolved in an environment of fundamental scarcity.

158
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:50,880
We see many other animals saving food for lean times.

159
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:55,740
And in that video, it was, it was called, I think, um, why is preparation problematic

160
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:56,880
or something like that?

161
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:02,360
I basically laid out the argument that a lot of socialists don't like the idea of panic

162
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:08,080
buying or in general prepping for the future is because one, their ideal socialist utopia

163
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:10,520
is a world where scarcity has been eliminated.

164
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:14,820
And two, because a lot of them are ignorant of the nuts and bolts of, of how things work.

165
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:17,600
They think we are a lot closer to that than we actually are.

166
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:21,940
The number of socialists who have told me that under real socialism, there would never

167
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:29,340
again be a rainy day and therefore no reason to save up for one has been rather high.

168
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:33,320
The main reason I can't show you a lot of these conversations specifically is because

169
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:36,880
they were with an old account that has since been banned, but I'm sure we all remember

170
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:41,240
this person who said in response to people buying a little bit extra saving for a rainy

171
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:44,160
day, all houses should be inspected.

172
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:47,760
Anyone that has more than two weeks food should be fined heavily.

173
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,280
After all, that's not your food.

174
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:51,120
It's the people's food comrade.

175
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:53,120
And you're hoarding it like a cool lock.

176
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:58,000
You're being solipsistic again, socialism will always require a massive surveillance

177
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,960
state to ensure that people are following the rules.

178
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:03,680
Meanwhile, liberalism doesn't care.

179
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:04,680
Yeah.

180
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:06,040
There are sometimes shortages.

181
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,920
There are sometimes bread lines.

182
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:10,520
And under socialism, you sometimes get bread.

183
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:15,460
Market fluctuations are inevitable and the temporary disruption of supply is not a good

184
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:17,800
enough argument against liberal society.

185
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:21,080
I will end off with just an idle musing here.

186
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:25,120
It is really funny to me that we're currently facing this situation when this time a year

187
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:29,040
ago, the value of oil actually dropped below zero.

188
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,040
You remember that shit?

189
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:31,560
That was a big story back then.

190
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:35,420
I didn't cover it because it was kind of a flash in the pan thing, but I'm sure you saw

191
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:36,420
it somewhere.

192
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:41,660
April 2020, oil became so cheap it was less than a bottle of Coke and people who were

193
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:46,000
trading barrels of oil buying with the intention to flip it, they actually started losing quite

194
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,460
a bit of money because the price on oil was just so low.

195
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:50,460
And now look at us.

196
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:55,360
We have a run on oil without making any other claim about any other political situation

197
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,700
beyond this topic.

198
00:11:56,700 --> 00:12:00,960
I do miss the days when oil was so cheap, we could just pull up to a gas station, fill

199
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:01,960
up our tank.

200
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:04,580
And if our car needed a little bit of wash, oh, it's fine.

201
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:06,780
Just a splash, a little bit of gasoline on it.

202
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:07,780
It'll be okay.

203
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:08,780
Oh my gosh.

204
00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:09,780
Okay.

205
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:15,700
So you go, go in and tell, yeah, somebody's are going and tell somebody she's doing the

206
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:18,540
whole car and see what she's doing.

207
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:22,740
Well, also think about how much money she's spending because she's running right now.

208
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:24,320
This is a lot of money.

209
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:27,180
This is the most expensive car wash ever.

210
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:31,740
Wait, wait, actually, what do we, what do you want us to say?

211
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:36,820
Say stop washing your car with gasoline, maybe.
