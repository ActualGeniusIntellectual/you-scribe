0	9900	This is going to be a stupid video, I can already tell.
9900	15180	In case you haven't noticed, the past few days, people have been panic buying gasoline.
15180	20700	They're not just filling up their vehicles, but they're also filling up gas canisters,
20700	24300	making sure they have enough to ride out a potential shortage.
24300	30620	And I don't know about you, but already, right off the bat, this looks like something
30620	34080	that a game developer would put into place in a first person shooter.
34080	39460	You know, a car full of gas tanks set in just a specific spot in the level, so that if you
39460	42660	shoot it at the right time, you can get max combo kills.
42660	46500	If this woman gets hit going home, she's going to take out an entire city block.
46500	48540	But hey, people don't care about that.
48540	52780	There's a gas shortage, so people are stocking up, making the shortage even worse.
52780	57240	And if you can't afford gas containers like these people, well, don't worry about it.
57240	63100	Just load up plastic totes, that'll work, right?
63100	67460	You know, I can't believe I have to say this, gasoline evaporates very quickly.
67460	71340	You don't even have lids for these things, I hope there's like lids in the trunk or something.
71340	76320	Also, not only will it evaporate, it'll corrode that cheap ass plastic.
76320	82880	And like, how do you expect to pour it into your car, lady?
82880	86360	There's there's multiple levels of failure in this picture.
86360	94160	And what the fuck are you doing filling like a clear, thin plastic trash bags with gasoline
94160	96880	and throwing that in the back of your trunk?
96880	106000	Like everything, everything that I said about the plastic tote will apply tenfold here.
106000	112360	So yes, as it turns out, 72% of North Carolina gas stations are without fuel.
112360	116000	Experts are warning residents to prepare for another tough day, and it's been like this
116000	119040	for I think three or four days now, maybe even a little bit longer.
119040	120880	And it's not just North Carolina.
120880	124320	Hundreds of gas stations have run out of fuel, and others see massive lines as the shortage
124320	125320	worsens.
125320	130440	The 5,500 mile colonial pipeline has been shut down indefinitely since Friday, which
130440	134680	would have been May 7th, after a cyber attack led its operators to cease operations of the
134680	139320	major arteries supplying gasoline to states all throughout the southeast and mid-Atlantic
139320	140320	regions.
140320	142760	The company hopes to reopen most of the line by the end of the week.
142760	147840	So the pipeline gets hacked, this somehow shuts off all of the gas flow from I think
147840	152800	it's Texas to the to the eastern seaboard, and people start losing their minds over it.
152800	157080	But it's not just those locations, there's a cascading effect of this.
157080	161000	Far from the colonial pipeline, panic buying leaves Florida cities short of gas.
161000	165300	These are people who are not necessarily even affected by this, but they hear it happening
165300	167640	somewhere else in the nation, and so they stock up.
167640	171320	But wait wait wait, the pipeline was hacked.
171320	177760	That's right, a hacking group known as DarkSide, a day before the pipeline was shut down, stole
177760	180660	around 100 gigabytes of data from the company.
180660	187880	They then locked them out of their computers and demanded 5 million dollars in cryptocurrency,
187880	190440	which is, as you know, untraceable.
190440	191940	And Colonial paid them.
191940	195720	After getting paid, the hackers provided the company with a decrypting tool to restore
195720	197600	its disabled computer network.
197600	202680	An audit of the pipeline three years ago found glaring problems, with the auditor saying
202680	205440	that an 8th grader could have hacked into their system.
205440	213120	Now Colonial has not officially said how the hackers penetrated their network, but an anonymous
213120	217800	source at Colonial Pipeline said the hackers were able to gain access to their computer
217800	220360	systems through a phishing scheme.
220360	226000	According to the source, an employee clicked on a link in an email titled More Like Kansas
226000	227000	City.
227000	232520	The email contained an image of a large-breasted female in a Kansas City Chiefs bikini with
232520	235360	a link promising additional pictures.
235360	241440	So 5 million in Bitcoin, one of the biggest pipelines in the world shut down for a week,
241440	245160	and mass panic buying over Booba.
245160	247260	Well, probably worth it.
247260	250180	And of course, the memes coming out of this are great.
250180	255300	I mean, there's no reason we can't have a Coke and Mentos fueled economy instead of
255300	256380	an oil one.
256380	261180	Forget about totes and garbage bags, this guy's got half a basement full of gas.
261180	265980	This idiot filled up his Hummer with five cans of gas and decided to have a smoke.
265980	268020	You did know it's flammable, right?
268020	272720	Considering all this craziness, the US Consumer Product Safety Commission had to come out
272720	277220	and say, do not fill plastic bags with gasoline.
277220	280220	Use only containers approved for fuel.
280220	285300	Follow the gas canister manufacturer instructions for storing and transporting gasoline.
285300	289380	When using a gas canister, never pour gasoline over or near an open flame.
289380	292100	Man, I remember being taught this when I was like five.
292100	294460	What the hell is wrong with people?
294460	296660	Did you like the gas shortage?
296660	301060	We could make it permanent by passing AOC's Green New Deal.
301060	303440	Nobody liked the gas shortage.
303440	304440	Nobody wanted this.
304440	306100	What the fuck are you talking about?
306100	312700	You're literally describing a state of emergency and you want it to be permanent.
312700	315460	What is this acceleration ass bullshit?
315460	321060	Because the Dark Side hacking group is based in Eastern Europe, most probably Russia, there
321060	325580	is a lot of people on the left calling this a Russian attack against the United States.
325580	329620	And damn, it is kind of terrifying to think that hackers, you know, half a world away
329620	333860	can get a bit creative and cause a gas shortage in the United States.
333860	337380	Good thing the CIA is currently promoting diversity and inclusion.
337380	363460	I'm sure that'll help.
363460	365660	Thanks for keeping the state safe, guys.
365660	368340	But for real, here's the actual government response to it.
368340	372700	Because of the fact that there's not a whole lot of other supply.
372700	378060	Now, this particular pipeline also supplies other states, but there are other pipelines
378060	379780	that supply their states as well.
379780	382640	So there's more diversity in this particular region.
382640	384700	That's where we're going to see the crunch.
384700	388340	And this is why we are we know that we have gasoline.
388340	390940	We just have to get it to the right places.
390940	394380	And that's why these next couple of days I think will be challenging and we want to
394380	396300	encourage people.
396300	399100	It's not that we have a gasoline shortage.
399100	404700	It's that we have this supply crunch and that things will be back to normal soon.
404700	406500	And then we're asking people not to hoard.
406500	410340	I got to say there's nothing that comes out of the current Biden administration that sounds
410340	411340	truthful.
411340	414660	A supply crunch, not a gasoline shortage.
414660	417580	What do you think a supply crunch is?
417580	420940	A shortage is when there is a lack of supply.
420940	426460	Meanwhile, Biden's solution to the problem is more education spending.
426460	427860	All right.
427860	432540	I think that this shows that I think we have to make a greater investment in education
432540	437100	as it relates to being able to train and graduate more people proficient in cybersecurity.
437100	443800	Okay, I can I can kind of see the connection here, but I think the extent of the education
443800	448360	is don't click on links promising big titties.
448360	453200	Of course, Newt Gingrich, a bag of gasoline himself, is using the opportunity to shill
453200	455360	for another pointless, terrible war.
455360	457520	Nobody should be surprised by this.
457520	461160	The former Speaker of the House called for military strikes to kill those involved in
461160	463660	an act of war against America.
463660	468440	Now Newt Gingrich is not part of the Democratic Party, but we all know that the Democrats
468440	470360	have been itching for a new war.
470360	471560	And who knows?
471560	474920	Maybe they'll blow enough smoke up everyone's ass to finally get one going here.
474920	478880	I'm sure the neocons would be happy to get on board by the time this became a full fledged
478880	479880	story.
479880	480880	However, it was over.
480880	482560	They paid their five million in crypto.
482560	486480	They got their computer systems back and the pipeline has now restarted.
486480	488300	Normal service will take several days.
488300	493760	But even now, as things return to normal, it has still sparked a round of panic buying.
493760	495480	And that really is the real conversation here.
495480	502320	I did a video last year on panic buying regarding back then it was getting food and toilet paper
502320	505280	before the first wave of coronavirus hit your area.
505280	508860	I'm sure you guys must still remember what it was like a year ago, right?
508860	512720	Toilet paper, along with a lot of grocery staples, started getting completely wiped
512720	514400	out in major population centers.
514400	518580	And I was one of many people back then who were saying, ignore those who claim that prepping
518580	524160	for coronavirus is racism and go out and buy yourself some extra food now while you still
524160	528040	can if you live in an area where there has not yet been runs on this stuff.
528040	530360	And I heard from a lot of you, you guys did so.
530360	534400	You guys went out and bought like a bunch of cheap staples like beans and rice and pasta.
534400	537420	You guys got extra toilet paper and extra cleaning supplies.
537420	539920	And a lot of you were able to ride out that initial wave.
539920	540920	No problem.
540920	541920	I was too.
541920	546080	I actually remember telling Naomi, hey, listen, uh, we've got to get like, you know, a month
546080	548620	or two's worth of extra food here at least.
548620	549620	And she listened to me.
549620	551160	She was a bit skeptical, but she, but she listened to me.
551160	554660	And then as things got worse, she was like, yeah, okay, that was the right call.
554660	556360	We actually had so much toilet paper.
556360	561900	We had, we had bought like triple the amount that we would use throughout an entire year.
561900	564480	And we're still kind of going through it now.
564480	567760	And we actually ended up giving some away to some people because, uh, like some friends
567760	570520	didn't have any, but still I'm sure you remember what it was like.
570520	572760	Other cleaning supplies were vanishing too.
572760	578160	And yeah, idiots were dying after drinking hand sanitizer for, for some fucking reason.
578160	580840	But panic buying seems to be something that we do.
580840	582000	And of course, right.
582000	583000	It would make sense.
583000	584400	That's part of our psychology.
584400	587480	We evolved in an environment of fundamental scarcity.
587480	590880	We see many other animals saving food for lean times.
590880	595740	And in that video, it was, it was called, I think, um, why is preparation problematic
595740	596880	or something like that?
596880	602360	I basically laid out the argument that a lot of socialists don't like the idea of panic
602360	608080	buying or in general prepping for the future is because one, their ideal socialist utopia
608080	610520	is a world where scarcity has been eliminated.
610520	614820	And two, because a lot of them are ignorant of the nuts and bolts of, of how things work.
614820	617600	They think we are a lot closer to that than we actually are.
617600	621940	The number of socialists who have told me that under real socialism, there would never
621940	629340	again be a rainy day and therefore no reason to save up for one has been rather high.
629340	633320	The main reason I can't show you a lot of these conversations specifically is because
633320	636880	they were with an old account that has since been banned, but I'm sure we all remember
636880	641240	this person who said in response to people buying a little bit extra saving for a rainy
641240	644160	day, all houses should be inspected.
644160	647760	Anyone that has more than two weeks food should be fined heavily.
647760	649280	After all, that's not your food.
649280	651120	It's the people's food comrade.
651120	653120	And you're hoarding it like a cool lock.
653120	658000	You're being solipsistic again, socialism will always require a massive surveillance
658000	661960	state to ensure that people are following the rules.
661960	663680	Meanwhile, liberalism doesn't care.
663680	664680	Yeah.
664680	666040	There are sometimes shortages.
666040	667920	There are sometimes bread lines.
667920	670520	And under socialism, you sometimes get bread.
670520	675460	Market fluctuations are inevitable and the temporary disruption of supply is not a good
675460	677800	enough argument against liberal society.
677800	681080	I will end off with just an idle musing here.
681080	685120	It is really funny to me that we're currently facing this situation when this time a year
685120	689040	ago, the value of oil actually dropped below zero.
689040	690040	You remember that shit?
690040	691560	That was a big story back then.
691560	695420	I didn't cover it because it was kind of a flash in the pan thing, but I'm sure you saw
695420	696420	it somewhere.
696420	701660	April 2020, oil became so cheap it was less than a bottle of Coke and people who were
701660	706000	trading barrels of oil buying with the intention to flip it, they actually started losing quite
706000	709460	a bit of money because the price on oil was just so low.
709460	710460	And now look at us.
710460	715360	We have a run on oil without making any other claim about any other political situation
715360	716700	beyond this topic.
716700	720960	I do miss the days when oil was so cheap, we could just pull up to a gas station, fill
720960	721960	up our tank.
721960	724580	And if our car needed a little bit of wash, oh, it's fine.
724580	726780	Just a splash, a little bit of gasoline on it.
726780	727780	It'll be okay.
727780	728780	Oh my gosh.
728780	729780	Okay.
729780	735700	So you go, go in and tell, yeah, somebody's are going and tell somebody she's doing the
735700	738540	whole car and see what she's doing.
738540	742740	Well, also think about how much money she's spending because she's running right now.
742740	744320	This is a lot of money.
744320	747180	This is the most expensive car wash ever.
747180	751740	Wait, wait, actually, what do we, what do you want us to say?
751740	756820	Say stop washing your car with gasoline, maybe.
