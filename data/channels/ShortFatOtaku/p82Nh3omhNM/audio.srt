00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,600
Hello everyone! I'm finally back from vacation. I took a trip with Naomi to Toronto, went to some theme parks, did some shopping.

2
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:12,920
It was a fun little trip, but I'm back. Things are finally in motion. The streams are happening again.

3
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:18,920
I'm doing TikTok Tuesday on Thursday. At least it's still a tea. And yes, making videos again.

4
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:25,500
Honestly, getting out of here was kind of nice, even though Toronto's a shithole. The construction situation hasn't changed at all, though.

5
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:34,000
So, I'm gonna have to be doing all of my recording, all of my gaming streams during the day, which, you know, which sucks.

6
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:41,500
However, let's check out the TikToks we've saved up. Starting off first with a Halloween one.

7
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:47,500
Oh my god, they're just stealing the whole thing.

8
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:50,500
God, this is terrible, isn't it?

9
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:58,500
Like, you just take one, not the whole bowl. These people are not capable of self-governance.

10
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:06,500
Jesus. You know that, you know that image of, like, ducks eating a bowl of peas? That's what this is like. They're just chowing down.

11
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:11,500
Fucking vultures, dude. What genuinely awful people. Like, here, hold on, hold on.

12
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:18,500
Like, here's the very first stream of the video, and look at this woman's face. She's like, oh, look at all the stuff I could steal.

13
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:22,500
Now, I mean, I think they're speaking Spanish in the video. Some people are trying to make this into a race thing.

14
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:28,500
It's definitely not a race thing. Like, there's been videos of a lot of white women doing this too, like white moms and their kids.

15
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:40,500
It does seem to be a woman thing, though. I don't think I've seen a man do it yet. I mean, I'm sure someone has, but all the videos that I've seen over the years of people just stealing the entire bowl of candy for Halloween outside, it's been women.

16
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:43,500
Anyway, disgusting behavior. Fuck them.

17
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:50,500
This next one I feel like I might have seen before. Maybe I've just seen this person. She does have a very unique look about her, doesn't she? Let's see.

18
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:56,500
Oh my god. Don't get so close, lady.

19
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:02,500
What?

20
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:07,500
Oh.

21
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:19,500
Black, brown, and indigenous women, femmes, and non-men.

22
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:25,500
Oh my god, guys, can you hear the seriousness in her voice? She's channeling all of her comic book villain energies.

23
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:30,500
Like, there's no way this chick is actually threatening. She probably can't even get out of that fucking car. She's very wedged in.

24
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:35,500
Now, I know I'm not a white woman, but nonetheless, you know, I wouldn't take any orders from this fucking clown. Fuck you, lady.

25
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:38,500
What the fuck is this?

26
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:44,500
Okay, I gotta mute the music and watch that again, because Jesus Christ.

27
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:49,500
All littles are valid. Their headspace, their body, their choice.

28
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:50,500
What?

29
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:56,500
So this is a person who roleplays as a child and has sex as a child.

30
00:02:56,500 --> 00:03:03,500
Oh, man, just, like, keep this weird shit in the fucking bedroom. You don't gotta be proud of this. There's no pride in this.

31
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:06,500
You don't gotta put this shit on fucking TikTok, dude.

32
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:11,500
Alright, this next one just screams trans to me. Let's go. Let's see the cancer.

33
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:16,500
Oh, no.

34
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:27,500
Oh, god.

35
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:31,500
I've tried to avoid this discourse.

36
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:46,500
I know you don't like to hear that, because you hinge your entire identity and existence on biological function, but there it is. It is possible.

37
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:52,500
Now, am I likely to be in that position at the age of nearly 38? No.

38
00:03:52,500 --> 00:04:01,500
And we have no intention of having any children earlier, so I'm not going to be in any type of position to be breastfeeding.

39
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:10,500
I could give two shits what terms you or anybody else uses. Nobody is stealing your womanhood. Nobody is oppressing you.

40
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:15,500
Hold on, if you give two shits what other terms that other people use, then how come I can't just call you a man?

41
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:18,500
Because you would clearly care about that, right?

42
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:25,500
Okay, oh, my stomach is, like, upset now. I've only had coffee this morning, guys. It's, like, early in the morning. I'm just like, ooh.

43
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:29,500
I'm going on an empty stomach, coffee only, and now it's, like, roiling.

44
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:35,500
There's, maybe a month or two ago, there was a big online discourse about translactation.

45
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:40,500
And I tried my best to avoid that shit, because that is cancerous as fuck, you know?

46
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:46,500
Like, should you give trans women drugs to induce lactation, you know?

47
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:52,500
Is, I don't know what the, I don't know the science behind it. Like, the milk that comes out, is it actually edible? Like, is it the same?

48
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:58,500
I don't fucking know. I don't understand. I gotta look into it. But it is just gross, though, isn't it?

49
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:04,500
Also, I'm pretty sure that was a Family Guy joke, where, like, where Peter was, like, breastfeeding Stewie.

50
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:10,500
Like, wasn't this played for laughs back in the day? Now it's, like, a real fucking thing that weirdos actually want to do.

51
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:16,500
Here's what's happening here. You get an Oregon Trail card. You go in and you buy a bottle of water.

52
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:21,500
You go out to the parking lot and you dump it on the ground. Then you take your empty bottles.

53
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:27,500
You take them into the store immediately to redeem for 10 cents apiece. Then you buy drugs.

54
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:34,500
Oh, fuck. Oh, my God. Dude, I hate this bullshit. All right. And you see this a lot.

55
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:41,500
Like, there's a concept called the fungibility of money, right? Let's say that you want to buy $100 worth of drugs.

56
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:48,500
But you don't have the money. Let's say I give you $100 and let's say you take $100 and listen, buy food with this, OK?

57
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:53,500
You know, of course I will, of course. Then you take the money and then you go buy drugs. Like, what was I thinking? Obviously, right?

58
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:59,500
But let's say that I give you $100 worth of food stamps so you can only buy food. Well, you know what that means?

59
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:07,500
It means you can get food. Yeah. But it also means that rather than spending money on food, the next $100 you get can be spent on drugs.

60
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:12,500
So the issue ultimately with programs like food stamps is not like they work. They do kind of work.

61
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:17,500
But it's that basically if a poor person wants to buy drugs and they already have some money,

62
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:22,500
giving them food stamps will simply mean that they don't have to use that money that they do have on food.

63
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:28,500
They can actually put it towards drugs anyway, because at the end of the day, all resources do go into one pot.

64
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:33,500
No matter how much you divvy up, how much you can be spent, that just frees up other resources elsewhere in the system.

65
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:39,500
So there's only so much you can do with food stamp like programs. And this is obvious here, right?

66
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:46,500
Like these people buy bottled water with food stamps, go out, dump the water, return for cash and use the cash to buy drugs.

67
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:51,500
There's tons of schemes like this out here. People are going to get their drugs if they really want them.

68
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:58,500
It's fucking disgusting. But at some point you if people don't want to help themselves, you can't force them to get better.

69
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:01,500
I know I'm probably just being so dramatic and annoying. Yeah, probably.

70
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:09,500
But this is my first job, like my first nine to five job after college and I'm in person and I'm commuting in the city and it takes me fucking forever.

71
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:13,500
Oh, there's no way I'm going to be able to afford living in the city right now.

72
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:17,500
I suddenly don't like feminism and equal rights and having my own job.

73
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:25,500
But I'm not. So it literally takes me like I leave here like I get on the train at seven thirty and I don't get home till like six fifteen earliest.

74
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:31,500
And then like I don't have time to do anything. I don't I want to shower, eat my dinner and go to sleep.

75
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:37,500
I don't have time or energy to cook by dinner either. Like I don't have energy to work out like that out the window.

76
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:41,500
Like I'm so upset. Oh, nothing.

77
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:46,500
My job at all, but just like the nine to five schedule in general is crazy.

78
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:51,500
Being in the office, I know it's crazy. She has to be in your home and everything's fine.

79
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:59,500
But like, I'm not home. It takes me long to get home and like, yeah, like people that drive to the office, like it doesn't you don't get off at five.

80
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:03,500
And I know it could be worse. I know I could be working longer, but like I literally get off.

81
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:06,500
It's pitch black. Like, I don't have energy. How do you have friends?

82
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:11,500
Like, how do you have time to like meet like a guy? I don't know.

83
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:14,500
Like, how do you have time for like dating? Like, I don't have time for anything.

84
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:19,500
And I'm like so stressed out and I'm also getting my period. So that's why I have a weekend.

85
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:23,500
You know, a weekend so dramatic. It's fine. I don't know.

86
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:28,500
This just seems like the real world hitting this lady real hard, doesn't it? Now, who knows?

87
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,500
Maybe she wasn't actually one of those hypocritical feminist types.

88
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:40,500
Maybe she's just actually experiencing reality for the first time, having to actually work for her way through the world and rather than having things handed to her on account of, you know, her being pretty.

89
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:46,500
But this went very viral recently and people are just shitting on this chick for how naive she is.

90
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:50,500
And they're roping and stuff like feminism and stuff. And that's that can be like, I can be funny.

91
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:53,500
That's good. Memes might not be accurate, but it is at least funny.

92
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:59,500
But yeah, guys don't live in in cities unless you're working from home or something else is going on, right?

93
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:04,500
Like nobody needs a two hour commute, dude. Fuck like cities can be really fun to live in.

94
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:11,500
But it really is one of those things you have to be able to afford, like everyone trying to cram into a city and destroying themselves doing it.

95
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:17,500
I'm going to confirm that the bingos were good, and then I'm going to call another number.

96
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:19,500
And that is just for two hours.

97
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:44,500
Teachers don't have favorite students.

98
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:47,500
What's what's going on?

99
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:59,500
You did have a favorite student. Oh, my God.

100
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:03,500
That's dark. That's funny. That's dark. Oh, shit.

101
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:07,500
All right, guys, that's the end of TikTok Thursday for me today.

102
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:12,500
Don't worry, vacation's over. I'm working as best as I can in between construction.

103
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:16,500
So videos and stuff coming again, weekly sips coming again.

104
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:19,500
I know I keep saying that every time I come back, but fuck, it's it's hot.

105
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:22,500
Things are happening finally. OK, right after this goes up, I'm going to be streaming.

106
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:26,500
I'm going to be streaming some lies of peace. So come and say hello.

107
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:30,500
Also, I recorded a vlog recently because I saw that five nights at Freddy's movie.

108
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:34,500
So click those links on screen. Come by and check it out.

109
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:38,500
Come say hi. I will see you guys there. I love you.
