0	6600	Hello everyone! I'm finally back from vacation. I took a trip with Naomi to Toronto, went to some theme parks, did some shopping.
6600	12920	It was a fun little trip, but I'm back. Things are finally in motion. The streams are happening again.
12920	18920	I'm doing TikTok Tuesday on Thursday. At least it's still a tea. And yes, making videos again.
19560	25500	Honestly, getting out of here was kind of nice, even though Toronto's a shithole. The construction situation hasn't changed at all, though.
25500	34000	So, I'm gonna have to be doing all of my recording, all of my gaming streams during the day, which, you know, which sucks.
34000	41500	However, let's check out the TikToks we've saved up. Starting off first with a Halloween one.
44500	47500	Oh my god, they're just stealing the whole thing.
48500	50500	God, this is terrible, isn't it?
51500	58500	Like, you just take one, not the whole bowl. These people are not capable of self-governance.
59500	66500	Jesus. You know that, you know that image of, like, ducks eating a bowl of peas? That's what this is like. They're just chowing down.
67500	71500	Fucking vultures, dude. What genuinely awful people. Like, here, hold on, hold on.
71500	78500	Like, here's the very first stream of the video, and look at this woman's face. She's like, oh, look at all the stuff I could steal.
78500	82500	Now, I mean, I think they're speaking Spanish in the video. Some people are trying to make this into a race thing.
82500	88500	It's definitely not a race thing. Like, there's been videos of a lot of white women doing this too, like white moms and their kids.
88500	100500	It does seem to be a woman thing, though. I don't think I've seen a man do it yet. I mean, I'm sure someone has, but all the videos that I've seen over the years of people just stealing the entire bowl of candy for Halloween outside, it's been women.
101500	103500	Anyway, disgusting behavior. Fuck them.
103500	110500	This next one I feel like I might have seen before. Maybe I've just seen this person. She does have a very unique look about her, doesn't she? Let's see.
114500	116500	Oh my god. Don't get so close, lady.
121500	122500	What?
126500	127500	Oh.
130500	139500	Black, brown, and indigenous women, femmes, and non-men.
139500	145500	Oh my god, guys, can you hear the seriousness in her voice? She's channeling all of her comic book villain energies.
145500	150500	Like, there's no way this chick is actually threatening. She probably can't even get out of that fucking car. She's very wedged in.
150500	155500	Now, I know I'm not a white woman, but nonetheless, you know, I wouldn't take any orders from this fucking clown. Fuck you, lady.
156500	158500	What the fuck is this?
161500	164500	Okay, I gotta mute the music and watch that again, because Jesus Christ.
164500	169500	All littles are valid. Their headspace, their body, their choice.
169500	170500	What?
171500	176500	So this is a person who roleplays as a child and has sex as a child.
176500	183500	Oh, man, just, like, keep this weird shit in the fucking bedroom. You don't gotta be proud of this. There's no pride in this.
183500	186500	You don't gotta put this shit on fucking TikTok, dude.
186500	191500	Alright, this next one just screams trans to me. Let's go. Let's see the cancer.
195500	196500	Oh, no.
206500	207500	Oh, god.
209500	211500	I've tried to avoid this discourse.
217500	226500	I know you don't like to hear that, because you hinge your entire identity and existence on biological function, but there it is. It is possible.
226500	232500	Now, am I likely to be in that position at the age of nearly 38? No.
232500	241500	And we have no intention of having any children earlier, so I'm not going to be in any type of position to be breastfeeding.
241500	250500	I could give two shits what terms you or anybody else uses. Nobody is stealing your womanhood. Nobody is oppressing you.
250500	255500	Hold on, if you give two shits what other terms that other people use, then how come I can't just call you a man?
255500	258500	Because you would clearly care about that, right?
258500	265500	Okay, oh, my stomach is, like, upset now. I've only had coffee this morning, guys. It's, like, early in the morning. I'm just like, ooh.
265500	269500	I'm going on an empty stomach, coffee only, and now it's, like, roiling.
269500	275500	There's, maybe a month or two ago, there was a big online discourse about translactation.
275500	280500	And I tried my best to avoid that shit, because that is cancerous as fuck, you know?
280500	286500	Like, should you give trans women drugs to induce lactation, you know?
286500	292500	Is, I don't know what the, I don't know the science behind it. Like, the milk that comes out, is it actually edible? Like, is it the same?
292500	298500	I don't fucking know. I don't understand. I gotta look into it. But it is just gross, though, isn't it?
298500	304500	Also, I'm pretty sure that was a Family Guy joke, where, like, where Peter was, like, breastfeeding Stewie.
304500	310500	Like, wasn't this played for laughs back in the day? Now it's, like, a real fucking thing that weirdos actually want to do.
310500	316500	Here's what's happening here. You get an Oregon Trail card. You go in and you buy a bottle of water.
316500	321500	You go out to the parking lot and you dump it on the ground. Then you take your empty bottles.
321500	327500	You take them into the store immediately to redeem for 10 cents apiece. Then you buy drugs.
327500	334500	Oh, fuck. Oh, my God. Dude, I hate this bullshit. All right. And you see this a lot.
334500	341500	Like, there's a concept called the fungibility of money, right? Let's say that you want to buy $100 worth of drugs.
341500	348500	But you don't have the money. Let's say I give you $100 and let's say you take $100 and listen, buy food with this, OK?
348500	353500	You know, of course I will, of course. Then you take the money and then you go buy drugs. Like, what was I thinking? Obviously, right?
353500	359500	But let's say that I give you $100 worth of food stamps so you can only buy food. Well, you know what that means?
359500	367500	It means you can get food. Yeah. But it also means that rather than spending money on food, the next $100 you get can be spent on drugs.
367500	372500	So the issue ultimately with programs like food stamps is not like they work. They do kind of work.
372500	377500	But it's that basically if a poor person wants to buy drugs and they already have some money,
377500	382500	giving them food stamps will simply mean that they don't have to use that money that they do have on food.
382500	388500	They can actually put it towards drugs anyway, because at the end of the day, all resources do go into one pot.
388500	393500	No matter how much you divvy up, how much you can be spent, that just frees up other resources elsewhere in the system.
393500	399500	So there's only so much you can do with food stamp like programs. And this is obvious here, right?
399500	406500	Like these people buy bottled water with food stamps, go out, dump the water, return for cash and use the cash to buy drugs.
406500	411500	There's tons of schemes like this out here. People are going to get their drugs if they really want them.
411500	418500	It's fucking disgusting. But at some point you if people don't want to help themselves, you can't force them to get better.
418500	421500	I know I'm probably just being so dramatic and annoying. Yeah, probably.
421500	429500	But this is my first job, like my first nine to five job after college and I'm in person and I'm commuting in the city and it takes me fucking forever.
429500	433500	Oh, there's no way I'm going to be able to afford living in the city right now.
433500	437500	I suddenly don't like feminism and equal rights and having my own job.
438500	445500	But I'm not. So it literally takes me like I leave here like I get on the train at seven thirty and I don't get home till like six fifteen earliest.
445500	451500	And then like I don't have time to do anything. I don't I want to shower, eat my dinner and go to sleep.
451500	457500	I don't have time or energy to cook by dinner either. Like I don't have energy to work out like that out the window.
457500	461500	Like I'm so upset. Oh, nothing.
461500	466500	My job at all, but just like the nine to five schedule in general is crazy.
466500	471500	Being in the office, I know it's crazy. She has to be in your home and everything's fine.
471500	479500	But like, I'm not home. It takes me long to get home and like, yeah, like people that drive to the office, like it doesn't you don't get off at five.
479500	483500	And I know it could be worse. I know I could be working longer, but like I literally get off.
483500	486500	It's pitch black. Like, I don't have energy. How do you have friends?
486500	491500	Like, how do you have time to like meet like a guy? I don't know.
491500	494500	Like, how do you have time for like dating? Like, I don't have time for anything.
494500	499500	And I'm like so stressed out and I'm also getting my period. So that's why I have a weekend.
499500	503500	You know, a weekend so dramatic. It's fine. I don't know.
503500	508500	This just seems like the real world hitting this lady real hard, doesn't it? Now, who knows?
508500	510500	Maybe she wasn't actually one of those hypocritical feminist types.
510500	520500	Maybe she's just actually experiencing reality for the first time, having to actually work for her way through the world and rather than having things handed to her on account of, you know, her being pretty.
520500	526500	But this went very viral recently and people are just shitting on this chick for how naive she is.
526500	530500	And they're roping and stuff like feminism and stuff. And that's that can be like, I can be funny.
530500	533500	That's good. Memes might not be accurate, but it is at least funny.
533500	539500	But yeah, guys don't live in in cities unless you're working from home or something else is going on, right?
539500	544500	Like nobody needs a two hour commute, dude. Fuck like cities can be really fun to live in.
544500	551500	But it really is one of those things you have to be able to afford, like everyone trying to cram into a city and destroying themselves doing it.
552500	557500	I'm going to confirm that the bingos were good, and then I'm going to call another number.
557500	559500	And that is just for two hours.
581500	584500	Teachers don't have favorite students.
585500	587500	What's what's going on?
595500	599500	You did have a favorite student. Oh, my God.
600500	603500	That's dark. That's funny. That's dark. Oh, shit.
603500	607500	All right, guys, that's the end of TikTok Thursday for me today.
607500	612500	Don't worry, vacation's over. I'm working as best as I can in between construction.
612500	616500	So videos and stuff coming again, weekly sips coming again.
616500	619500	I know I keep saying that every time I come back, but fuck, it's it's hot.
619500	622500	Things are happening finally. OK, right after this goes up, I'm going to be streaming.
622500	626500	I'm going to be streaming some lies of peace. So come and say hello.
626500	630500	Also, I recorded a vlog recently because I saw that five nights at Freddy's movie.
630500	634500	So click those links on screen. Come by and check it out.
634500	638500	Come say hi. I will see you guys there. I love you.
