0	1920	So yesterday was Remembrance Day.
1920	4720	I think it's Veterans Day in the States, but it's Remembrance Day here.
4720	9000	In Canada, and I think in the rest of the Commonwealth as well, people wear red poppies
9000	10180	during Remembrance Day.
10180	14040	The holiday started off initially as a World War I commemoration day, because November
14040	17920	11th was the day that World War I ended, and the poppy became the holiday symbol throughout
17920	22620	the British Empire due to a poem written by a Canadian doctor in Belgium during the war.
22620	26380	As expected, Twitter was filled for the day with various Remembrance Day messages and
26380	29220	hashtags from public figures and brand accounts.
29220	32800	You know, the stuff that IRL is usually pretty meaningful, but when pushed around on social
32800	34600	media just seems a bit vapid.
34600	35600	Especially you, Trudeau.
35600	36600	Get out of here.
36600	39340	We already know exactly what you have to say about veterans.
39340	45180	You made the promise, and I'll quote it here, no veteran will be forced to fight their own
45180	48360	government for the support and compensation they have earned.
48360	56220	Yet you are still currently in a legal battle with veterans regarding equal support and
56220	58020	compensation to their peers.
58020	63560	Why are we still fighting against certain veterans groups in court?
63560	68540	Because they are asking for more than we are able to give right now.
68540	78620	They are asking for more than we, well, no, hang on, you're asking for honest answers.
78620	81680	The old veterans charter.
81680	86240	There was a non-traversity about a LGBT themed rainbow coloured poppy this year.
86240	89960	The initial story was that a student in Manitoba was suspended for opposing the introduction
89960	91740	of the rainbow poppy at her school.
91740	95200	The school refused to publicly comment on why she was suspended, but did make the claim
95200	97820	that they had no plans to introduce a rainbow poppy.
97820	102140	The student's side of the story was that her choir teacher wanted their choir to wear them,
102140	103140	and she refused.
103140	107420	She later began posting flyers around the school, the flyers pictured here, which the
107420	110540	school administration considered to contain hate speech.
110540	113880	And that is what actually earned her the suspension, not refusing the poppy.
113880	118280	The story was amplified by the student's aunt, who was a conservative candidate in the
118280	119820	recent Canadian election.
119820	123500	After this whole story went viral, the initial tweets were taken down, and an apology by
123500	124980	the aunt was posted.
124980	128220	Canada's media took this as a sign that the whole thing was just fake news, drummed up
128220	132060	by the student for attention, and by Rebel Media, the only news outlet that was actually
132060	133980	willing to interview the student herself.
133980	138740	But you know, I actually read that apology statement, and nothing in here says that the
138740	139740	student made it up.
139740	144620	Or even that she recants the message of her original flyer, just that her words were misconstrued
144620	149320	as anti-LGBT, when they were only meant to be pro-traditional poppy.
149320	153920	So maybe the kid lied, or maybe she had a different reason to put up those flyers.
153920	158360	Maybe it actually happened as she said, but the story got buried under the weight of cancel
158360	159360	culture.
159360	161320	Either way, it's not the first time that people have tried to make rainbow poppies
161320	162320	a thing.
162320	165320	You know, not everything needs to be about LGBT people.
165320	169200	There are other groups out there worthy of recognition, there are other causes to fight
169660	173940	But because this is Twitter we're talking about here, there's always that vocal minority
173940	178620	of brainlets who have to do that predictably subversive thing and talk about how bad the
178620	180920	soldiers are and how evil the west is.
180920	185260	Probably the best galaxy brain takes of the bunch are the ones where nations like Canada
185260	189760	and Australia are blamed as global imperialist colonialist powers.
189760	194580	Well alright my down under comrades, let the forcible exporting of maple syrup and kangaroos
194580	195580	commence.
195600	199680	The American variant of the holiday is Veterans Day, because America's gotta be special
199680	200680	like that.
200680	203840	And they've got even more of those loud idiots who think it's super cool to talk
203840	206240	about how much veterans suck on their own holiday.
206240	209760	This is the equivalent of me saying get back in the kitchen on International Women's
209760	210760	Day or something.
210760	213480	Probably the best take I've found so far is this one.
213480	215680	A coup in Bolivia for Veterans Day?
215680	218120	I guess that's on brand for the US.
218120	219480	Happy Imperialism Day!
219480	224580	Okay so very quickly, Bolivia recently had a referendum because its authoritarian leftist
224580	229920	president, Evo Morales of the Movement for Socialism party, wanted to extend presidential
229920	230920	term limits.
230920	233700	He'd already been president for two terms and his time was up.
233700	237920	When he lost the referendum on the subject, Bolivia's Supreme Court decided to extend
237920	239120	term limits anyway.
239120	242200	Morales subsequently ran again for president and won.
242200	246300	Independent Review revealed that the vote was essentially rigged, and the entire country
246300	247300	began to riot.
247300	251380	The military and police both withdrew their support from Morales, and he was forced to
251380	252380	step down.
252380	257280	As of just a few hours ago, Morales has received asylum in Mexico, while the remnants of Bolivia's
257280	259000	Senate is calling another election.
259000	262520	And every single Twitter socialist is calling this event a coup.
262520	266540	No, it only seems like a coup to you guys because you still don't believe that your
266540	269280	failed ideology is what destroyed Venezuela.
269280	270840	But we're way off topic.
270840	274080	Let's discuss the crown jewel of this year's Poppy Day.
274080	277980	Don Cherry Don Cherry is, frankly, a Canadian legend.
277980	282640	A former pro hockey player and coach, Don Cherry has hosted the Canadian show Coaches
282640	284120	Corner for 40 years.
284120	288440	He's a Canadian staple, though he's not a politician, he's cut from the same cloth
288440	292600	as a Trump or a Boris Johnson, though with a very Canadian twist.
292600	298040	He's brash, unapologetic, loud-mouthed, unashamedly pro-Canadian, and he has absolutely
298040	301440	no problem letting people know it and looking like a goofball in the process.
301440	305980	Also, I'm pretty sure he's the only Canadian to ever appear in a JonTron, because Don Cherry
305980	308480	played the hockey coach in that one Goosebumps episode.
308480	309920	We got hockey coach man over here.
309920	311600	No, Jon, it's Don fucking Cherry.
311600	312600	Jon, it's us, I'm nobody.
312600	313600	Fuck.
313600	314600	Come on, what's going on?
314600	315600	Let's get some heads-up hockey.
315600	316600	That guy out there, I'll tell you something.
316600	317600	Ten million dollars in elements.
317600	318600	That's the game.
318600	323760	I see you guys out there, you'll be sent down to the minors.
323760	326960	I don't even like hockey, but I love the meme potential of this man.
326960	329400	He's a walking circus, and it's amazing.
329400	333780	He openly called European players pussies live on air during his coverage of the World
333780	334780	Cup.
334780	338800	One of the Russian skiers tested positive for drugs in the Salt Lake City Olympics.
338800	342840	He said, I've been trying to tell you people for so long about the Russians, what kind
342840	346920	of people they are, and you just love them in Canada with your multiculturalism.
346920	349660	They're quitters, and evidently they take a lot of drugs too.
349660	354360	He also said that European and French hockey players regularly wear visors, and therefore
354360	358540	don't care about the safety of their fellow players, because visor wearers tend to cause
358540	359840	more injuries.
359840	362200	Something backed up at least partially by hockey stats.
362200	367900	He referred to Alpo Suonan, a Winnipeg Jets coach from Finland, as some kind of a dog
367900	370980	food, because Alpo is also a dog food brand here.
370980	375540	He attended the 2010 inaugural meeting of the Toronto City Council, where he stated,
375540	379340	I'm wearing pink for all the pinkos out there that ride bicycles and everything.
379340	380660	I thought I'd get it in.
380660	384600	He then went on to state that he had been ripped to shreds by the left-wing pinko newspapers
384600	389880	out there, and ended by saying, and that's why I say Rob Ford is going to be the greatest
389880	394080	mayor this city has ever, ever seen, as far as I'm concerned.
394080	396520	And put that in your pipe, you left-wing kooks.
396520	403400	He referred to the wars in the Balkans of the 1990s as Lower Slobovia attacking Slymea.
403400	408180	What I'm trying to say is, Don Cherry has been a provocateur for his entire very long
408180	409180	career.
409180	414620	Coach's Corner has always been like this, for all 40 of its hilarious years, and Canadians
414620	417420	love him for it, because it's great to watch him go off the rails.
417760	422980	It's like watching a guy wearing an outlandish suit, riding a flaming dumpster fire on wheels,
422980	423980	careening down a hill.
423980	424980	It's just awesome.
424980	429740	So, on Remembrance Day 2019, Don Cherry had this to say.
429740	433780	You know, I was talking to a veteran, I said, I'm not going to run the poppy thing anymore,
433780	434780	because what's the sense?
434780	440420	I live in Mississauga, nobody wears, very few people wear a poppy.
440420	444380	Downtown Toronto, forget it, downtown Toronto, nobody wears a poppy, and I'm not going to.
444380	448380	But wait a minute, how about running it for the people that buy them?
448380	453580	Now you go to the small cities, and you know, you know, those, the rows and rows, you people
453580	458500	love you, they come here, whatever it is, you love our way of life, you love our milk
458500	463700	and honey, at least you could pay a couple of bucks for poppies or something like that.
463700	467880	These guys pay for your way of life that you enjoy in Canada.
467880	470540	These guys paid the biggest price.
470540	474980	Anyhow, I'm going to run it again for you great people, and good Canadians that bought
474980	475980	a poppy.
475980	476980	I'm still going to run it.
476980	477980	Anyhow.
477980	478980	Love you for it.
478980	480820	Well, that's pretty spicy.
480820	484700	Not the most outlandish thing he's ever said, but you know, pretty good, seven out of 10.
484700	487420	But because it's 2019, he's been fired.
487420	491380	People are calling him a bigot and a racist and all the usual nonsense we're used to hearing.
491380	495460	And to be honest, he probably actually is those things to some small degree.
495460	497140	But more than that, he's a clown.
497140	498900	He's a clown that everyone loves.
498900	503740	He's the guy people have always let's say racist dumb shit because it's racist and dumb.
503740	507560	And he appears as racist and dumb and people laugh at him for it.
507560	509740	But oh no, we can't laugh anymore.
509740	511060	Comedy is no longer allowed.
511060	517260	So after 40 years of slinging mad flaming shit on mainstream TV, Don Cherry was finally
517260	518260	canceled.
518260	523100	I mean, he never even mentioned a race in that specific rant or religion or an ethnicity.
523100	528380	He just complained basically that new immigrants to Canada generally refuse to wear poppies.
528380	530240	He didn't mention their skin color or anything else.
530240	532380	But no, he's just a bigot, I guess.
532380	535860	By the way, I hope you all didn't expect him to crumple under the weight of cancer culture
535860	536860	or something.
536860	539820	I hope you didn't expect an apology because you're not fucking getting one.
539820	543620	How appropriate, though, that I get fired on Relevance for Remembrance Day.
543620	548340	Let me put it this way, if you can get fired by the boss of Relevance, you can get fired
548340	549340	by anybody.
549340	553340	Oh, and by the way, while I was writing the script, the hashtag I stand with Don Cherry
553340	556620	started the trend in Canada on Twitter and on Facebook.
556620	560300	All of those old, normie high school people I still have on my friends list, but I never
560300	564620	talk to because Facebook is cancer, are all out in support of Don Cherry.
564620	566820	These are people with wildly different political views.
566820	568480	A lot of them are quite left.
568480	574320	But no, almost everyone understands that the Don represents a raw, hyper, big dicked Canadian
574320	576580	energy and everyone wants him back on TV.
576580	580560	In fact, people want him back on TV so badly that it's starting to cause some problems
580560	582380	with the network that canceled him in the first place.
582380	586060	Well, let's be honest with each other here, Lefty Canada, let's have a heart to heart.
586060	590680	You don't get to call Don Cherry racist for using the phrase, you people, when you
590680	593900	elected blackface Trudeau as our Prime Minister again.
593900	597260	You are no longer the arbiter of what is or is not racist.
597260	599700	You clearly can't judge it, so shut up.
599700	601180	Stop acting so offended over it.
601180	602980	We already know that it is an act.
602980	606220	We already know that what really offends you is patriotism itself.
606220	609940	Because you're most likely open borders agitators who hate the nation state, and
609940	613600	the commemoration of a country's soldiers is the celebration of who you erroneously
613600	619560	view as murderers who fought against your unrealistic and disastrous delusions of utopia.
619560	620560	Fuck you.
620560	627660	We're in Trillinken, British cemetery in France, on November 11th I want everybody
627660	633800	to remember when you're buying a poppy and you see row after row of our Canadian dead
633800	640920	here and I'm going to put here, we visited Thomas William Mackenzie military medal and
640920	648720	bar Canadian field artillery, he died seven days before the end of the war, 27 years old.
648720	655020	So when you're walking by and you see our great legions, guys standing there and they
655020	661800	offer you a poppy, think of all this, these guys gave their lives, at least you can buy
661800	662480	a poppy.
