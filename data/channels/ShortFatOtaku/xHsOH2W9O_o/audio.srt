1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,920
So yesterday was Remembrance Day.

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:04,720
I think it's Veterans Day in the States, but it's Remembrance Day here.

3
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:09,000
In Canada, and I think in the rest of the Commonwealth as well, people wear red poppies

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,180
during Remembrance Day.

5
00:00:10,180 --> 00:00:14,040
The holiday started off initially as a World War I commemoration day, because November

6
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:17,920
11th was the day that World War I ended, and the poppy became the holiday symbol throughout

7
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:22,620
the British Empire due to a poem written by a Canadian doctor in Belgium during the war.

8
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:26,380
As expected, Twitter was filled for the day with various Remembrance Day messages and

9
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:29,220
hashtags from public figures and brand accounts.

10
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:32,800
You know, the stuff that IRL is usually pretty meaningful, but when pushed around on social

11
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:34,600
media just seems a bit vapid.

12
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:35,600
Especially you, Trudeau.

13
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:36,600
Get out of here.

14
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:39,340
We already know exactly what you have to say about veterans.

15
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:45,180
You made the promise, and I'll quote it here, no veteran will be forced to fight their own

16
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:48,360
government for the support and compensation they have earned.

17
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:56,220
Yet you are still currently in a legal battle with veterans regarding equal support and

18
00:00:56,220 --> 00:00:58,020
compensation to their peers.

19
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:03,560
Why are we still fighting against certain veterans groups in court?

20
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:08,540
Because they are asking for more than we are able to give right now.

21
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:18,620
They are asking for more than we, well, no, hang on, you're asking for honest answers.

22
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:21,680
The old veterans charter.

23
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:26,240
There was a non-traversity about a LGBT themed rainbow coloured poppy this year.

24
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:29,960
The initial story was that a student in Manitoba was suspended for opposing the introduction

25
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:31,740
of the rainbow poppy at her school.

26
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:35,200
The school refused to publicly comment on why she was suspended, but did make the claim

27
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,820
that they had no plans to introduce a rainbow poppy.

28
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:42,140
The student's side of the story was that her choir teacher wanted their choir to wear them,

29
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:43,140
and she refused.

30
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:47,420
She later began posting flyers around the school, the flyers pictured here, which the

31
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:50,540
school administration considered to contain hate speech.

32
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:53,880
And that is what actually earned her the suspension, not refusing the poppy.

33
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:58,280
The story was amplified by the student's aunt, who was a conservative candidate in the

34
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,820
recent Canadian election.

35
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:03,500
After this whole story went viral, the initial tweets were taken down, and an apology by

36
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:04,980
the aunt was posted.

37
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:08,220
Canada's media took this as a sign that the whole thing was just fake news, drummed up

38
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:12,060
by the student for attention, and by Rebel Media, the only news outlet that was actually

39
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:13,980
willing to interview the student herself.

40
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:18,740
But you know, I actually read that apology statement, and nothing in here says that the

41
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:19,740
student made it up.

42
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:24,620
Or even that she recants the message of her original flyer, just that her words were misconstrued

43
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:29,320
as anti-LGBT, when they were only meant to be pro-traditional poppy.

44
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:33,920
So maybe the kid lied, or maybe she had a different reason to put up those flyers.

45
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:38,360
Maybe it actually happened as she said, but the story got buried under the weight of cancel

46
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,360
culture.

47
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,320
Either way, it's not the first time that people have tried to make rainbow poppies

48
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:42,320
a thing.

49
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:45,320
You know, not everything needs to be about LGBT people.

50
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:49,200
There are other groups out there worthy of recognition, there are other causes to fight

51
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:53,940
But because this is Twitter we're talking about here, there's always that vocal minority

52
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:58,620
of brainlets who have to do that predictably subversive thing and talk about how bad the

53
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:00,920
soldiers are and how evil the west is.

54
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:05,260
Probably the best galaxy brain takes of the bunch are the ones where nations like Canada

55
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:09,760
and Australia are blamed as global imperialist colonialist powers.

56
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:14,580
Well alright my down under comrades, let the forcible exporting of maple syrup and kangaroos

57
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:15,580
commence.

58
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:19,680
The American variant of the holiday is Veterans Day, because America's gotta be special

59
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,680
like that.

60
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:23,840
And they've got even more of those loud idiots who think it's super cool to talk

61
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:26,240
about how much veterans suck on their own holiday.

62
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:29,760
This is the equivalent of me saying get back in the kitchen on International Women's

63
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:30,760
Day or something.

64
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:33,480
Probably the best take I've found so far is this one.

65
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:35,680
A coup in Bolivia for Veterans Day?

66
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:38,120
I guess that's on brand for the US.

67
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,480
Happy Imperialism Day!

68
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:44,580
Okay so very quickly, Bolivia recently had a referendum because its authoritarian leftist

69
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:49,920
president, Evo Morales of the Movement for Socialism party, wanted to extend presidential

70
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:50,920
term limits.

71
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:53,700
He'd already been president for two terms and his time was up.

72
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:57,920
When he lost the referendum on the subject, Bolivia's Supreme Court decided to extend

73
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,120
term limits anyway.

74
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:02,200
Morales subsequently ran again for president and won.

75
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:06,300
Independent Review revealed that the vote was essentially rigged, and the entire country

76
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:07,300
began to riot.

77
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:11,380
The military and police both withdrew their support from Morales, and he was forced to

78
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:12,380
step down.

79
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:17,280
As of just a few hours ago, Morales has received asylum in Mexico, while the remnants of Bolivia's

80
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:19,000
Senate is calling another election.

81
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,520
And every single Twitter socialist is calling this event a coup.

82
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:26,540
No, it only seems like a coup to you guys because you still don't believe that your

83
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:29,280
failed ideology is what destroyed Venezuela.

84
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,840
But we're way off topic.

85
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:34,080
Let's discuss the crown jewel of this year's Poppy Day.

86
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:37,980
Don Cherry Don Cherry is, frankly, a Canadian legend.

87
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:42,640
A former pro hockey player and coach, Don Cherry has hosted the Canadian show Coaches

88
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:44,120
Corner for 40 years.

89
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:48,440
He's a Canadian staple, though he's not a politician, he's cut from the same cloth

90
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:52,600
as a Trump or a Boris Johnson, though with a very Canadian twist.

91
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:58,040
He's brash, unapologetic, loud-mouthed, unashamedly pro-Canadian, and he has absolutely

92
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:01,440
no problem letting people know it and looking like a goofball in the process.

93
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:05,980
Also, I'm pretty sure he's the only Canadian to ever appear in a JonTron, because Don Cherry

94
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:08,480
played the hockey coach in that one Goosebumps episode.

95
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:09,920
We got hockey coach man over here.

96
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,600
No, Jon, it's Don fucking Cherry.

97
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,600
Jon, it's us, I'm nobody.

98
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:13,600
Fuck.

99
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,600
Come on, what's going on?

100
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:15,600
Let's get some heads-up hockey.

101
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,600
That guy out there, I'll tell you something.

102
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,600
Ten million dollars in elements.

103
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:18,600
That's the game.

104
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:23,760
I see you guys out there, you'll be sent down to the minors.

105
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:26,960
I don't even like hockey, but I love the meme potential of this man.

106
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:29,400
He's a walking circus, and it's amazing.

107
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:33,780
He openly called European players pussies live on air during his coverage of the World

108
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:34,780
Cup.

109
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:38,800
One of the Russian skiers tested positive for drugs in the Salt Lake City Olympics.

110
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:42,840
He said, I've been trying to tell you people for so long about the Russians, what kind

111
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:46,920
of people they are, and you just love them in Canada with your multiculturalism.

112
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:49,660
They're quitters, and evidently they take a lot of drugs too.

113
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:54,360
He also said that European and French hockey players regularly wear visors, and therefore

114
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:58,540
don't care about the safety of their fellow players, because visor wearers tend to cause

115
00:05:58,540 --> 00:05:59,840
more injuries.

116
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:02,200
Something backed up at least partially by hockey stats.

117
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:07,900
He referred to Alpo Suonan, a Winnipeg Jets coach from Finland, as some kind of a dog

118
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:10,980
food, because Alpo is also a dog food brand here.

119
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:15,540
He attended the 2010 inaugural meeting of the Toronto City Council, where he stated,

120
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:19,340
I'm wearing pink for all the pinkos out there that ride bicycles and everything.

121
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:20,660
I thought I'd get it in.

122
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:24,600
He then went on to state that he had been ripped to shreds by the left-wing pinko newspapers

123
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:29,880
out there, and ended by saying, and that's why I say Rob Ford is going to be the greatest

124
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:34,080
mayor this city has ever, ever seen, as far as I'm concerned.

125
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,520
And put that in your pipe, you left-wing kooks.

126
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:43,400
He referred to the wars in the Balkans of the 1990s as Lower Slobovia attacking Slymea.

127
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:48,180
What I'm trying to say is, Don Cherry has been a provocateur for his entire very long

128
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:49,180
career.

129
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:54,620
Coach's Corner has always been like this, for all 40 of its hilarious years, and Canadians

130
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:57,420
love him for it, because it's great to watch him go off the rails.

131
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:02,980
It's like watching a guy wearing an outlandish suit, riding a flaming dumpster fire on wheels,

132
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:03,980
careening down a hill.

133
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:04,980
It's just awesome.

134
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:09,740
So, on Remembrance Day 2019, Don Cherry had this to say.

135
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:13,780
You know, I was talking to a veteran, I said, I'm not going to run the poppy thing anymore,

136
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:14,780
because what's the sense?

137
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:20,420
I live in Mississauga, nobody wears, very few people wear a poppy.

138
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:24,380
Downtown Toronto, forget it, downtown Toronto, nobody wears a poppy, and I'm not going to.

139
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:28,380
But wait a minute, how about running it for the people that buy them?

140
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:33,580
Now you go to the small cities, and you know, you know, those, the rows and rows, you people

141
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:38,500
love you, they come here, whatever it is, you love our way of life, you love our milk

142
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:43,700
and honey, at least you could pay a couple of bucks for poppies or something like that.

143
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:47,880
These guys pay for your way of life that you enjoy in Canada.

144
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:50,540
These guys paid the biggest price.

145
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:54,980
Anyhow, I'm going to run it again for you great people, and good Canadians that bought

146
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:55,980
a poppy.

147
00:07:55,980 --> 00:07:56,980
I'm still going to run it.

148
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:57,980
Anyhow.

149
00:07:57,980 --> 00:07:58,980
Love you for it.

150
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:00,820
Well, that's pretty spicy.

151
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:04,700
Not the most outlandish thing he's ever said, but you know, pretty good, seven out of 10.

152
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:07,420
But because it's 2019, he's been fired.

153
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:11,380
People are calling him a bigot and a racist and all the usual nonsense we're used to hearing.

154
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:15,460
And to be honest, he probably actually is those things to some small degree.

155
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:17,140
But more than that, he's a clown.

156
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:18,900
He's a clown that everyone loves.

157
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:23,740
He's the guy people have always let's say racist dumb shit because it's racist and dumb.

158
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:27,560
And he appears as racist and dumb and people laugh at him for it.

159
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:29,740
But oh no, we can't laugh anymore.

160
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:31,060
Comedy is no longer allowed.

161
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:37,260
So after 40 years of slinging mad flaming shit on mainstream TV, Don Cherry was finally

162
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:38,260
canceled.

163
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:43,100
I mean, he never even mentioned a race in that specific rant or religion or an ethnicity.

164
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:48,380
He just complained basically that new immigrants to Canada generally refuse to wear poppies.

165
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:50,240
He didn't mention their skin color or anything else.

166
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,380
But no, he's just a bigot, I guess.

167
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:55,860
By the way, I hope you all didn't expect him to crumple under the weight of cancer culture

168
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:56,860
or something.

169
00:08:56,860 --> 00:08:59,820
I hope you didn't expect an apology because you're not fucking getting one.

170
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:03,620
How appropriate, though, that I get fired on Relevance for Remembrance Day.

171
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:08,340
Let me put it this way, if you can get fired by the boss of Relevance, you can get fired

172
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:09,340
by anybody.

173
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:13,340
Oh, and by the way, while I was writing the script, the hashtag I stand with Don Cherry

174
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:16,620
started the trend in Canada on Twitter and on Facebook.

175
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:20,300
All of those old, normie high school people I still have on my friends list, but I never

176
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:24,620
talk to because Facebook is cancer, are all out in support of Don Cherry.

177
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:26,820
These are people with wildly different political views.

178
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:28,480
A lot of them are quite left.

179
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:34,320
But no, almost everyone understands that the Don represents a raw, hyper, big dicked Canadian

180
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,580
energy and everyone wants him back on TV.

181
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:40,560
In fact, people want him back on TV so badly that it's starting to cause some problems

182
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,380
with the network that canceled him in the first place.

183
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:46,060
Well, let's be honest with each other here, Lefty Canada, let's have a heart to heart.

184
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:50,680
You don't get to call Don Cherry racist for using the phrase, you people, when you

185
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:53,900
elected blackface Trudeau as our Prime Minister again.

186
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:57,260
You are no longer the arbiter of what is or is not racist.

187
00:09:57,260 --> 00:09:59,700
You clearly can't judge it, so shut up.

188
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:01,180
Stop acting so offended over it.

189
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:02,980
We already know that it is an act.

190
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:06,220
We already know that what really offends you is patriotism itself.

191
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:09,940
Because you're most likely open borders agitators who hate the nation state, and

192
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:13,600
the commemoration of a country's soldiers is the celebration of who you erroneously

193
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:19,560
view as murderers who fought against your unrealistic and disastrous delusions of utopia.

194
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:20,560
Fuck you.

195
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:27,660
We're in Trillinken, British cemetery in France, on November 11th I want everybody

196
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:33,800
to remember when you're buying a poppy and you see row after row of our Canadian dead

197
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:40,920
here and I'm going to put here, we visited Thomas William Mackenzie military medal and

198
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:48,720
bar Canadian field artillery, he died seven days before the end of the war, 27 years old.

199
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:55,020
So when you're walking by and you see our great legions, guys standing there and they

200
00:10:55,020 --> 00:11:01,800
offer you a poppy, think of all this, these guys gave their lives, at least you can buy

201
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:02,480
a poppy.
