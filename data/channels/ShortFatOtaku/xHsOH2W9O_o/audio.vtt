00:00.000 --> 00:01.920
So yesterday was Remembrance Day.

00:01.920 --> 00:04.720
I think it's Veterans Day in the States, but it's Remembrance Day here.

00:04.720 --> 00:09.000
In Canada, and I think in the rest of the Commonwealth as well, people wear red poppies

00:09.000 --> 00:10.180
during Remembrance Day.

00:10.180 --> 00:14.040
The holiday started off initially as a World War I commemoration day, because November

00:14.040 --> 00:17.920
11th was the day that World War I ended, and the poppy became the holiday symbol throughout

00:17.920 --> 00:22.620
the British Empire due to a poem written by a Canadian doctor in Belgium during the war.

00:22.620 --> 00:26.380
As expected, Twitter was filled for the day with various Remembrance Day messages and

00:26.380 --> 00:29.220
hashtags from public figures and brand accounts.

00:29.220 --> 00:32.800
You know, the stuff that IRL is usually pretty meaningful, but when pushed around on social

00:32.800 --> 00:34.600
media just seems a bit vapid.

00:34.600 --> 00:35.600
Especially you, Trudeau.

00:35.600 --> 00:36.600
Get out of here.

00:36.600 --> 00:39.340
We already know exactly what you have to say about veterans.

00:39.340 --> 00:45.180
You made the promise, and I'll quote it here, no veteran will be forced to fight their own

00:45.180 --> 00:48.360
government for the support and compensation they have earned.

00:48.360 --> 00:56.220
Yet you are still currently in a legal battle with veterans regarding equal support and

00:56.220 --> 00:58.020
compensation to their peers.

00:58.020 --> 01:03.560
Why are we still fighting against certain veterans groups in court?

01:03.560 --> 01:08.540
Because they are asking for more than we are able to give right now.

01:08.540 --> 01:18.620
They are asking for more than we, well, no, hang on, you're asking for honest answers.

01:18.620 --> 01:21.680
The old veterans charter.

01:21.680 --> 01:26.240
There was a non-traversity about a LGBT themed rainbow coloured poppy this year.

01:26.240 --> 01:29.960
The initial story was that a student in Manitoba was suspended for opposing the introduction

01:29.960 --> 01:31.740
of the rainbow poppy at her school.

01:31.740 --> 01:35.200
The school refused to publicly comment on why she was suspended, but did make the claim

01:35.200 --> 01:37.820
that they had no plans to introduce a rainbow poppy.

01:37.820 --> 01:42.140
The student's side of the story was that her choir teacher wanted their choir to wear them,

01:42.140 --> 01:43.140
and she refused.

01:43.140 --> 01:47.420
She later began posting flyers around the school, the flyers pictured here, which the

01:47.420 --> 01:50.540
school administration considered to contain hate speech.

01:50.540 --> 01:53.880
And that is what actually earned her the suspension, not refusing the poppy.

01:53.880 --> 01:58.280
The story was amplified by the student's aunt, who was a conservative candidate in the

01:58.280 --> 01:59.820
recent Canadian election.

01:59.820 --> 02:03.500
After this whole story went viral, the initial tweets were taken down, and an apology by

02:03.500 --> 02:04.980
the aunt was posted.

02:04.980 --> 02:08.220
Canada's media took this as a sign that the whole thing was just fake news, drummed up

02:08.220 --> 02:12.060
by the student for attention, and by Rebel Media, the only news outlet that was actually

02:12.060 --> 02:13.980
willing to interview the student herself.

02:13.980 --> 02:18.740
But you know, I actually read that apology statement, and nothing in here says that the

02:18.740 --> 02:19.740
student made it up.

02:19.740 --> 02:24.620
Or even that she recants the message of her original flyer, just that her words were misconstrued

02:24.620 --> 02:29.320
as anti-LGBT, when they were only meant to be pro-traditional poppy.

02:29.320 --> 02:33.920
So maybe the kid lied, or maybe she had a different reason to put up those flyers.

02:33.920 --> 02:38.360
Maybe it actually happened as she said, but the story got buried under the weight of cancel

02:38.360 --> 02:39.360
culture.

02:39.360 --> 02:41.320
Either way, it's not the first time that people have tried to make rainbow poppies

02:41.320 --> 02:42.320
a thing.

02:42.320 --> 02:45.320
You know, not everything needs to be about LGBT people.

02:45.320 --> 02:49.200
There are other groups out there worthy of recognition, there are other causes to fight

02:49.660 --> 02:53.940
But because this is Twitter we're talking about here, there's always that vocal minority

02:53.940 --> 02:58.620
of brainlets who have to do that predictably subversive thing and talk about how bad the

02:58.620 --> 03:00.920
soldiers are and how evil the west is.

03:00.920 --> 03:05.260
Probably the best galaxy brain takes of the bunch are the ones where nations like Canada

03:05.260 --> 03:09.760
and Australia are blamed as global imperialist colonialist powers.

03:09.760 --> 03:14.580
Well alright my down under comrades, let the forcible exporting of maple syrup and kangaroos

03:14.580 --> 03:15.580
commence.

03:15.600 --> 03:19.680
The American variant of the holiday is Veterans Day, because America's gotta be special

03:19.680 --> 03:20.680
like that.

03:20.680 --> 03:23.840
And they've got even more of those loud idiots who think it's super cool to talk

03:23.840 --> 03:26.240
about how much veterans suck on their own holiday.

03:26.240 --> 03:29.760
This is the equivalent of me saying get back in the kitchen on International Women's

03:29.760 --> 03:30.760
Day or something.

03:30.760 --> 03:33.480
Probably the best take I've found so far is this one.

03:33.480 --> 03:35.680
A coup in Bolivia for Veterans Day?

03:35.680 --> 03:38.120
I guess that's on brand for the US.

03:38.120 --> 03:39.480
Happy Imperialism Day!

03:39.480 --> 03:44.580
Okay so very quickly, Bolivia recently had a referendum because its authoritarian leftist

03:44.580 --> 03:49.920
president, Evo Morales of the Movement for Socialism party, wanted to extend presidential

03:49.920 --> 03:50.920
term limits.

03:50.920 --> 03:53.700
He'd already been president for two terms and his time was up.

03:53.700 --> 03:57.920
When he lost the referendum on the subject, Bolivia's Supreme Court decided to extend

03:57.920 --> 03:59.120
term limits anyway.

03:59.120 --> 04:02.200
Morales subsequently ran again for president and won.

04:02.200 --> 04:06.300
Independent Review revealed that the vote was essentially rigged, and the entire country

04:06.300 --> 04:07.300
began to riot.

04:07.300 --> 04:11.380
The military and police both withdrew their support from Morales, and he was forced to

04:11.380 --> 04:12.380
step down.

04:12.380 --> 04:17.280
As of just a few hours ago, Morales has received asylum in Mexico, while the remnants of Bolivia's

04:17.280 --> 04:19.000
Senate is calling another election.

04:19.000 --> 04:22.520
And every single Twitter socialist is calling this event a coup.

04:22.520 --> 04:26.540
No, it only seems like a coup to you guys because you still don't believe that your

04:26.540 --> 04:29.280
failed ideology is what destroyed Venezuela.

04:29.280 --> 04:30.840
But we're way off topic.

04:30.840 --> 04:34.080
Let's discuss the crown jewel of this year's Poppy Day.

04:34.080 --> 04:37.980
Don Cherry Don Cherry is, frankly, a Canadian legend.

04:37.980 --> 04:42.640
A former pro hockey player and coach, Don Cherry has hosted the Canadian show Coaches

04:42.640 --> 04:44.120
Corner for 40 years.

04:44.120 --> 04:48.440
He's a Canadian staple, though he's not a politician, he's cut from the same cloth

04:48.440 --> 04:52.600
as a Trump or a Boris Johnson, though with a very Canadian twist.

04:52.600 --> 04:58.040
He's brash, unapologetic, loud-mouthed, unashamedly pro-Canadian, and he has absolutely

04:58.040 --> 05:01.440
no problem letting people know it and looking like a goofball in the process.

05:01.440 --> 05:05.980
Also, I'm pretty sure he's the only Canadian to ever appear in a JonTron, because Don Cherry

05:05.980 --> 05:08.480
played the hockey coach in that one Goosebumps episode.

05:08.480 --> 05:09.920
We got hockey coach man over here.

05:09.920 --> 05:11.600
No, Jon, it's Don fucking Cherry.

05:11.600 --> 05:12.600
Jon, it's us, I'm nobody.

05:12.600 --> 05:13.600
Fuck.

05:13.600 --> 05:14.600
Come on, what's going on?

05:14.600 --> 05:15.600
Let's get some heads-up hockey.

05:15.600 --> 05:16.600
That guy out there, I'll tell you something.

05:16.600 --> 05:17.600
Ten million dollars in elements.

05:17.600 --> 05:18.600
That's the game.

05:18.600 --> 05:23.760
I see you guys out there, you'll be sent down to the minors.

05:23.760 --> 05:26.960
I don't even like hockey, but I love the meme potential of this man.

05:26.960 --> 05:29.400
He's a walking circus, and it's amazing.

05:29.400 --> 05:33.780
He openly called European players pussies live on air during his coverage of the World

05:33.780 --> 05:34.780
Cup.

05:34.780 --> 05:38.800
One of the Russian skiers tested positive for drugs in the Salt Lake City Olympics.

05:38.800 --> 05:42.840
He said, I've been trying to tell you people for so long about the Russians, what kind

05:42.840 --> 05:46.920
of people they are, and you just love them in Canada with your multiculturalism.

05:46.920 --> 05:49.660
They're quitters, and evidently they take a lot of drugs too.

05:49.660 --> 05:54.360
He also said that European and French hockey players regularly wear visors, and therefore

05:54.360 --> 05:58.540
don't care about the safety of their fellow players, because visor wearers tend to cause

05:58.540 --> 05:59.840
more injuries.

05:59.840 --> 06:02.200
Something backed up at least partially by hockey stats.

06:02.200 --> 06:07.900
He referred to Alpo Suonan, a Winnipeg Jets coach from Finland, as some kind of a dog

06:07.900 --> 06:10.980
food, because Alpo is also a dog food brand here.

06:10.980 --> 06:15.540
He attended the 2010 inaugural meeting of the Toronto City Council, where he stated,

06:15.540 --> 06:19.340
I'm wearing pink for all the pinkos out there that ride bicycles and everything.

06:19.340 --> 06:20.660
I thought I'd get it in.

06:20.660 --> 06:24.600
He then went on to state that he had been ripped to shreds by the left-wing pinko newspapers

06:24.600 --> 06:29.880
out there, and ended by saying, and that's why I say Rob Ford is going to be the greatest

06:29.880 --> 06:34.080
mayor this city has ever, ever seen, as far as I'm concerned.

06:34.080 --> 06:36.520
And put that in your pipe, you left-wing kooks.

06:36.520 --> 06:43.400
He referred to the wars in the Balkans of the 1990s as Lower Slobovia attacking Slymea.

06:43.400 --> 06:48.180
What I'm trying to say is, Don Cherry has been a provocateur for his entire very long

06:48.180 --> 06:49.180
career.

06:49.180 --> 06:54.620
Coach's Corner has always been like this, for all 40 of its hilarious years, and Canadians

06:54.620 --> 06:57.420
love him for it, because it's great to watch him go off the rails.

06:57.760 --> 07:02.980
It's like watching a guy wearing an outlandish suit, riding a flaming dumpster fire on wheels,

07:02.980 --> 07:03.980
careening down a hill.

07:03.980 --> 07:04.980
It's just awesome.

07:04.980 --> 07:09.740
So, on Remembrance Day 2019, Don Cherry had this to say.

07:09.740 --> 07:13.780
You know, I was talking to a veteran, I said, I'm not going to run the poppy thing anymore,

07:13.780 --> 07:14.780
because what's the sense?

07:14.780 --> 07:20.420
I live in Mississauga, nobody wears, very few people wear a poppy.

07:20.420 --> 07:24.380
Downtown Toronto, forget it, downtown Toronto, nobody wears a poppy, and I'm not going to.

07:24.380 --> 07:28.380
But wait a minute, how about running it for the people that buy them?

07:28.380 --> 07:33.580
Now you go to the small cities, and you know, you know, those, the rows and rows, you people

07:33.580 --> 07:38.500
love you, they come here, whatever it is, you love our way of life, you love our milk

07:38.500 --> 07:43.700
and honey, at least you could pay a couple of bucks for poppies or something like that.

07:43.700 --> 07:47.880
These guys pay for your way of life that you enjoy in Canada.

07:47.880 --> 07:50.540
These guys paid the biggest price.

07:50.540 --> 07:54.980
Anyhow, I'm going to run it again for you great people, and good Canadians that bought

07:54.980 --> 07:55.980
a poppy.

07:55.980 --> 07:56.980
I'm still going to run it.

07:56.980 --> 07:57.980
Anyhow.

07:57.980 --> 07:58.980
Love you for it.

07:58.980 --> 08:00.820
Well, that's pretty spicy.

08:00.820 --> 08:04.700
Not the most outlandish thing he's ever said, but you know, pretty good, seven out of 10.

08:04.700 --> 08:07.420
But because it's 2019, he's been fired.

08:07.420 --> 08:11.380
People are calling him a bigot and a racist and all the usual nonsense we're used to hearing.

08:11.380 --> 08:15.460
And to be honest, he probably actually is those things to some small degree.

08:15.460 --> 08:17.140
But more than that, he's a clown.

08:17.140 --> 08:18.900
He's a clown that everyone loves.

08:18.900 --> 08:23.740
He's the guy people have always let's say racist dumb shit because it's racist and dumb.

08:23.740 --> 08:27.560
And he appears as racist and dumb and people laugh at him for it.

08:27.560 --> 08:29.740
But oh no, we can't laugh anymore.

08:29.740 --> 08:31.060
Comedy is no longer allowed.

08:31.060 --> 08:37.260
So after 40 years of slinging mad flaming shit on mainstream TV, Don Cherry was finally

08:37.260 --> 08:38.260
canceled.

08:38.260 --> 08:43.100
I mean, he never even mentioned a race in that specific rant or religion or an ethnicity.

08:43.100 --> 08:48.380
He just complained basically that new immigrants to Canada generally refuse to wear poppies.

08:48.380 --> 08:50.240
He didn't mention their skin color or anything else.

08:50.240 --> 08:52.380
But no, he's just a bigot, I guess.

08:52.380 --> 08:55.860
By the way, I hope you all didn't expect him to crumple under the weight of cancer culture

08:55.860 --> 08:56.860
or something.

08:56.860 --> 08:59.820
I hope you didn't expect an apology because you're not fucking getting one.

08:59.820 --> 09:03.620
How appropriate, though, that I get fired on Relevance for Remembrance Day.

09:03.620 --> 09:08.340
Let me put it this way, if you can get fired by the boss of Relevance, you can get fired

09:08.340 --> 09:09.340
by anybody.

09:09.340 --> 09:13.340
Oh, and by the way, while I was writing the script, the hashtag I stand with Don Cherry

09:13.340 --> 09:16.620
started the trend in Canada on Twitter and on Facebook.

09:16.620 --> 09:20.300
All of those old, normie high school people I still have on my friends list, but I never

09:20.300 --> 09:24.620
talk to because Facebook is cancer, are all out in support of Don Cherry.

09:24.620 --> 09:26.820
These are people with wildly different political views.

09:26.820 --> 09:28.480
A lot of them are quite left.

09:28.480 --> 09:34.320
But no, almost everyone understands that the Don represents a raw, hyper, big dicked Canadian

09:34.320 --> 09:36.580
energy and everyone wants him back on TV.

09:36.580 --> 09:40.560
In fact, people want him back on TV so badly that it's starting to cause some problems

09:40.560 --> 09:42.380
with the network that canceled him in the first place.

09:42.380 --> 09:46.060
Well, let's be honest with each other here, Lefty Canada, let's have a heart to heart.

09:46.060 --> 09:50.680
You don't get to call Don Cherry racist for using the phrase, you people, when you

09:50.680 --> 09:53.900
elected blackface Trudeau as our Prime Minister again.

09:53.900 --> 09:57.260
You are no longer the arbiter of what is or is not racist.

09:57.260 --> 09:59.700
You clearly can't judge it, so shut up.

09:59.700 --> 10:01.180
Stop acting so offended over it.

10:01.180 --> 10:02.980
We already know that it is an act.

10:02.980 --> 10:06.220
We already know that what really offends you is patriotism itself.

10:06.220 --> 10:09.940
Because you're most likely open borders agitators who hate the nation state, and

10:09.940 --> 10:13.600
the commemoration of a country's soldiers is the celebration of who you erroneously

10:13.600 --> 10:19.560
view as murderers who fought against your unrealistic and disastrous delusions of utopia.

10:19.560 --> 10:20.560
Fuck you.

10:20.560 --> 10:27.660
We're in Trillinken, British cemetery in France, on November 11th I want everybody

10:27.660 --> 10:33.800
to remember when you're buying a poppy and you see row after row of our Canadian dead

10:33.800 --> 10:40.920
here and I'm going to put here, we visited Thomas William Mackenzie military medal and

10:40.920 --> 10:48.720
bar Canadian field artillery, he died seven days before the end of the war, 27 years old.

10:48.720 --> 10:55.020
So when you're walking by and you see our great legions, guys standing there and they

10:55.020 --> 11:01.800
offer you a poppy, think of all this, these guys gave their lives, at least you can buy

11:01.800 --> 11:02.480
a poppy.
