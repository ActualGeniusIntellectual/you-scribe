00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,840
So, for today's episode, halfway through watching the first season, Taftaj has hitched her her

2
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:12,040
cart to our ride. Welcome aboard.

3
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:13,680
It's true. Thanks, Deb.

4
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:14,680
So welcome aboard.

5
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:15,680
Taftaj.

6
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:19,880
Taftaj is a friend of mine from a different sector of the internet, and I figured we could

7
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:25,300
make the worlds collide. We'll see if we can bring you into like the arched Sargon sphere.

8
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:27,300
You can say hello to some people.

9
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:31,740
But the plan to infiltrate it begins.

10
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:37,700
So we are indeed halfway through the season, and you caught up to do this with us, right?

11
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:38,780
I did.

12
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:42,580
And how do you how do you feel about the first four episodes?

13
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:46,700
I'll be controversial and say that I didn't think they were that bad. I thought they were

14
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:51,720
they were very pretty. I'm not enough of a Lord of the Rings nerd to like notice every

15
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:56,860
detail and be like, um, actually, this is not correct. I've been enjoying it. I think

16
00:00:56,860 --> 00:01:01,460
the pacing is a little bit slow, but it helps when you watch it on two times speed.

17
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:06,140
So wait, you've been watching it on two times speed?

18
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:07,620
I had to catch up somehow.

19
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:14,540
I mean, each episode is an hour long. I'll grant her that.

20
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:19,820
And after having watched it at 1x speed, I think, if anything, she's far smarter than

21
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:20,820
us.

22
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:24,460
Yeah, maybe it is more enjoyable on two times speed. Who knows?

23
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:30,100
I glance over I'm like, Oh, thank God, we're getting past the cringy parts and we're getting

24
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:33,500
straight to the pretty scene. And that's all good.

25
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:37,780
And you know, to be fair to the show, it does have some pretty good CG.

26
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:39,720
It does. It looks very expensive.

27
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:43,300
If you knew absolutely nothing about Lord of the Rings, and you just thought this was

28
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:47,300
some kind of Game of Thrones ish show, it might seem okay, but

29
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:50,340
What is your biggest critique of it so far?

30
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:54,660
Is that it's not Lord of the Rings, because Lord of the Rings has a specific style of

31
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:59,300
storytelling has a very specific world. And it's just none of those things, at least in

32
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:00,580
my opinion, what do you guys think?

33
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:05,620
I kind of feel like it's missing that Tolkien vibe. Because if it was a Tolkien story, everybody

34
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:10,420
be smoking the pipe. They always smoke pipes.

35
00:02:10,420 --> 00:02:13,620
The man more pipe smoking. That's what it means.

36
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:18,340
Just hook it up. Everybody. This sorrow old guy should just like spend the show smoking

37
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:21,340
with the harpets.

38
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:23,500
Smoking the fireflies.

39
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:29,980
My biggest complaint is that it is aggressively not a Tolkien show, like they go out of their

40
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:33,180
way to de-talkinify it.

41
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:38,980
Disa is a perfect example of this because Disa is actually a quite good character, which

42
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:44,020
is acted out in a fairly good way. And if it was just that she was black, I'd be like

43
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:50,260
2022. But no, they also had to shave her, which genuinely annoys me because like, okay,

44
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:55,980
you had a good character, a good actress here. And then you just have to have a middle finger.

45
00:02:55,980 --> 00:03:00,420
Even in the Peter Jackson films, because I watched Return of the King today, actually,

46
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:05,740
and one of the scenes where the the Gondorian and Rohirric army are marching towards the

47
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:09,540
Black Gate. There's actually a Black Gondorian in the background, but it doesn't bother me

48
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:13,540
in the slightest because, well, it's not done in such a way to be like, oh, we're being

49
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:18,580
different. We're doing it to modernize the story. It's like, no, they just needed an

50
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:23,060
extra actor and, you know, he fit the shoes. So good for him.

51
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:28,020
At the risk of sounding like, I don't know, a little bit racist. I think that the good

52
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:33,780
thing about the characters that are black in this show is that it doesn't feel like

53
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:38,100
they're drawing great attention to the fact that they're black. Like, I feel like these

54
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:43,060
characters are like just characters that happen to be black. And, you know, any sort

55
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:49,540
of like cultural associations to real world races seem like they're not really there.

56
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:55,060
So I think that like when I watch these characters, like I can just see them as dwarves and elves

57
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:59,340
with the only thing and like at the risk of retreading ground that we've already gone

58
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:04,580
over being like some aesthetic stuff. Like, I agree. It's a little bit weird to see like

59
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:10,020
very dwarfy characters and she like has barely any beard. I think that like does throw me off

60
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:16,260
a little bit. But besides that, I think that the skin colors of the characters have been

61
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:21,060
less jarring than I expected them to be. I will say this. The show is not actually

62
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:24,580
particularly woke in the traditional sense of the word.

63
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:29,220
I agree. It is. It is just in the casting choice and the fact that they seem to be making

64
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:34,420
an effort to undermine Tolkien's work in minigames.

65
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:39,220
Like, imagine if they played into like strong independent black woman stereotypes or something.

66
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:41,460
That would be like unbearable.

67
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:47,220
Imagine if they had contemporary allusions to like modern politics.

68
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:48,100
Exactly.

69
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:52,660
Especially like modern racial politics. Imagine if they had this like this is like

70
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:53,860
Which they haven't done yet.

71
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:57,940
Or hey, this is dissentus or whatever.

72
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:00,660
God, that would be awful.

73
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:04,020
Well, hold on a second, Leith, because we actually missed it in the last episode.

74
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:07,060
We were joking about something else and we actually let a line slip by

75
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:14,820
where there's that one rioter who says that elven workers are coming to steal the trades of Numenor.

76
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:16,020
That's true.

77
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:18,420
They had that one scene.

78
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:21,540
And then I DMed you. I was like based to deport the elves.

79
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:26,660
Notice how the the black elf character, one thing that's weird about him,

80
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:29,380
that's also kind of jarring, isn't necessarily the fact that he's black,

81
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:32,420
but it's the fact that he's missing one of the core things that elves have.

82
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:35,620
Sort of long, you know, beautiful flowing hair.

83
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:37,380
Also personality.

84
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:39,460
You're not sure of a few elves.

85
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:43,620
Because they shouldn't have short hair and stuff like that.

86
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:49,700
Because they're always described in the books as to have, you know, long, very beautiful flowing hair.

87
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:56,420
Again, it's one of those middle fingers that they know this isn't how elves look,

88
00:05:56,420 --> 00:05:59,700
but they decide, OK, we got to fuck the communities out of my mind.

89
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:03,220
I also don't like Adam Deere's actor at all.

90
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:06,740
I think he's a plank of fucking wood who has precisely one facial expression.

91
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:07,780
He hasn't either.

92
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:12,500
They're not throwing him a bone or he's just not really taking the scenes by storm.

93
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:15,140
Like the what's that one bad guy shows up?

94
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:18,980
Remember, he stole that scene absolutely from under him.

95
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:20,580
Is it Adar or Adal?

96
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:20,980
Adar.

97
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:24,180
He shows up too.

98
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:26,180
That's great in terms of his acting.

99
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:29,380
Diversity higher elf is an actual nectar.

100
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:30,580
He's a fucking model.

101
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:32,340
Oh, God.

102
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:33,700
Is that why you suck so much?

103
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:35,300
That's why you suck so much in the camera.

104
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:39,780
Why would you give him like just have him play an extra, not be the front and center?

105
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:41,460
He does give up.

106
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:45,060
He does come across as a plank of wood for most of the movie.

107
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:50,020
I totally see like the model thing because it does seem like he's kind of making faces.

108
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:51,700
Blue steel.

109
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:56,180
I need to make a face for the for the cover art of this poster.

110
00:06:56,420 --> 00:06:56,740
Okay.

111
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:00,260
Oh, God.

112
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:03,700
I think he's probably the worst character in the show.

113
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:04,900
There's no character to him.

114
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:11,060
Like Galadriel, even though she's not Galadriel from from the movies or the books, she at

115
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:12,340
least has a character.

116
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:13,620
She's she's angry.

117
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:15,860
It sort of happens to him.

118
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:24,420
He wanders around, he gets captured and then he becomes like the only survivor because

119
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:25,780
he's special or lucky.

120
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:27,780
Maybe he'll become a character.

121
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:31,300
And he gets to meet, I don't know, he gets to meet a dar.

122
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:35,540
He also gets to have some human pussy, some humusy.

123
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:37,300
Humusy, yes.

124
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:38,660
A hussy, if you will.

125
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:43,540
I mentioned last week that I got a package from Amazon with the Lord of the Rings tape.

126
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:49,940
Since uploading that video, I've been inundated with people posting me their images of Lord

127
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:51,380
of the Rings packages.

128
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:54,420
Apparently, everyone's getting this shit right now.

129
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:56,980
There's Lord of the Rings tape on Amazon boxes.

130
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:58,580
There's Lord of the Rings boxes.

131
00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:01,220
Like if you order something from Amazon, it's big enough.

132
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:03,620
You just get it in a giant Lord of the Rings chest.

133
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:06,660
They're really going all out with the advertisement here for this show.

134
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:08,100
They really want people to watch this.

135
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:09,620
I'm kind of curious to see if it has an impact.

136
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:11,860
I got a Lord of the Rings wrapping with one of my packages.

137
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:14,900
Not all of them were Lord of the Rings packages, mind you.

138
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:15,300
Yeah.

139
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:17,380
They want us to watch the show.

140
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:18,980
I'm already watching it on Amazon.

141
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:19,860
I mean, of sorts.

142
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:21,220
Not paying for it.

143
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:23,860
Thank you for your sacrifice, Gibbs.

144
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:25,140
We appreciate it.

145
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:29,780
I was informed that apparently in the States, you guys get this all the time.

146
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:33,060
Like apparently, what was that one show called?

147
00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:34,500
The Wheel of Time did it.

148
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:37,220
They had Wheel of Time advertisements in the packaging.

149
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:38,820
But this is the first time it's happened in Canada.

150
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:39,620
This is new to me.

151
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:45,700
You've also been covering the review scandal and the views and reviews.

152
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:48,260
I don't know, Taftage, if you heard about what's been going on.

153
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:53,540
But there's been some evidence that Amazon is drastically inflating their view numbers.

154
00:08:53,860 --> 00:09:00,100
There's some evidence that Amazon is basically putting their finger on the scale of user

155
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:03,140
reviews to make the show look a lot better than it actually is.

156
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:06,100
I guess they just can't take the L on this one, you know.

157
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:08,980
I've got one bit of news to have on that front.

158
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:16,180
The reviews since the last time we did this dropped by 0.3 from their five star rating.

159
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:19,060
So they are dipping down slowly.

160
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:23,700
And the actual reviews that are coming out on mainstream reviews, news sites, you know,

161
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:27,940
they're finally starting to say by episode four that it's just not a very good show.

162
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:34,020
And you can see it on Forbes and you can see it on even Screen Rant, which is, you know,

163
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:35,460
very ideologically inclined.

164
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:38,340
Even they said that Gladriel at this point is just unlikable.

165
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:41,620
Oh, how could they say that about such a strong and empowered woman?

166
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:44,340
Are you just sexist?

167
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:50,180
Speaking of that on The Guardian, The Rings of Power episode four, the queen stops being angry.

168
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:54,900
People are just ripping even even the corpos are ripping into the show at this point.

169
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:57,380
That's a very bad sign.

170
00:09:57,380 --> 00:09:57,940
Yeah.

171
00:09:57,940 --> 00:09:58,660
Yeah.

172
00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:03,460
So here's the most positive corporate review that I've found for the for episode four.

173
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:03,860
OK.

174
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:05,620
And this is on CBR dot com.

175
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:09,140
The Rings of Power episode four expertly blends triumph and tragedy.

176
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:13,860
The connections between the seemingly disparate plot threads are beginning to come together.

177
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:18,980
And halfway through season one, The Rings of Power is putting its pieces into motion.

178
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:20,900
Officially at the halfway to season one.

179
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:21,540
Yes.

180
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:22,100
Yes.

181
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:27,700
The show is briskly moving into its grander story, no longer fixated on introducing new

182
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:30,420
characters and plot lines officially at the halfway mark.

183
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:34,500
The Rings of Power season one is ready to cut loose, and the back half of the season

184
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:38,820
is poised to deliver the high fantasy goods as its story ramps into high gear.

185
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:41,380
That's that's the praise.

186
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:42,500
It'll get good guys.

187
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:43,540
Trust us.

188
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:44,180
Hold on.

189
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:46,500
It sounds it's going to get better.

190
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:47,300
It'll be fair.

191
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:51,140
The recent episodes happened better than the first one.

192
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:51,620
Yes.

193
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:52,980
Yes, I completely agree.

194
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:53,380
Yeah.

195
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:56,420
The first two were just nothing like nothing existed.

196
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:57,300
Nothing happened.

197
00:10:57,300 --> 00:11:00,260
It was just characters being characters.

198
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:01,060
It was very slow.

199
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:03,140
Yeah, I agree.

200
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:06,740
So everyone has been saying about the show that it's a slow burn, guys, the slow burn.

201
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:07,380
And fair enough.

202
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:09,300
I've watched some slow burn shows.

203
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:11,460
You know, I really like Star Trek, Deep Space Nine.

204
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:12,980
That show is a slow fucking burn.

205
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:13,300
That's good.

206
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:15,780
That's like a two season slow burn on that show.

207
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:16,020
OK.

208
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:16,660
So I get it.

209
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:19,780
I understand it builds into something at the end.

210
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:20,900
That's the nice part.

211
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:24,020
All of that was building towards a greater idea.

212
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:24,340
Yes.

213
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:26,020
That's why the payoff was so good.

214
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:30,420
So if there's no payoff on this, it's going to be it's going to be really bad by the end of it.

215
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:31,540
You know what I will say?

216
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:33,860
So Star Wars and or just came out, right?

217
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:35,780
And I decided to watch that show.

218
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:39,140
They launched three episodes on their release day that came out last night.

219
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:40,100
So I watched that.

220
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:40,820
And you know what?

221
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:44,820
It's not super amazing, but it's OK.

222
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:46,740
And it actually is a real slow burn.

223
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:50,420
I was pleasantly surprised that now it's got fuck all to do with Star Wars because I don't know,

224
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:52,900
for some reason, Disney doesn't know what the fuck to do with this property.

225
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:56,980
But it's like it's an OK show and they're actually doing a slow burn.

226
00:11:56,980 --> 00:11:58,660
Things do happen every scene.

227
00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:02,660
A story is progressing and they're just let there's chew in the fat a bit, you know,

228
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:06,340
as compared to this show, which just did nothing for the first two hours.

229
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:11,620
The guys who are making Andal, he he literally said that he couldn't care less about Star Wars.

230
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:13,140
He wanted to make a spy thriller.

231
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:15,060
And here's the thing.

232
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:18,260
It's actually a good spy thriller.

233
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:18,980
Like, it's not bad.

234
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:22,180
I'm actually enjoying it, but it shouldn't even have Star Wars attached to it.

235
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:26,660
You can just make this as like a random sci fi, whatever, and it would be fine.

236
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:28,020
But they got to use Star Wars.

237
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:28,740
I don't know.

238
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:29,060
Huh?

239
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:30,740
Just make new things.

240
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:32,180
Just make new things, guys.

241
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:32,500
Come on.

242
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:33,380
It's OK.

243
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:39,700
If you're going to make something that isn't the property, don't make something else.

244
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:43,860
Simple as like, if I'm going to watch the Star Wars show, odds are I'm going to try

245
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:45,220
and watch a Star Wars show.

246
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:46,420
Yeah, I kind of agree.

247
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:49,220
Like, I want to watch Star Wars as a Star Wars fan.

248
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:51,780
I I kind of like to watch Star Wars.

249
00:12:53,780 --> 00:13:00,500
I know that's a novel concept, but you don't want to see a rom com set in a Star Wars universe.

250
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:01,220
Not particularly.

251
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:04,580
No, you don't want to see a cooking show.

252
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:06,980
Oh, God, maybe.

253
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:10,500
I mean, that might be banger.

254
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:15,540
Well, they did that back in the holiday special.

255
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:16,020
Remember that?

256
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:17,060
Yeah, and that went well.

257
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:18,500
That went really well, didn't it?

258
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:20,900
God.

259
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:23,220
And it used to be the worst piece of Star Wars media.

260
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:24,500
So Taftash.

261
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:24,820
Yes.

262
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:29,940
This is the kind of nerds complaining about shit that you've signed up for.

263
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:31,060
How do you feel about it?

264
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:33,540
I feel good about it.

265
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:35,860
Feels great.

266
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:41,460
Even though I can't give insight on all of these properties, I'm I'm just happy to participate.

267
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:43,860
There have been like very much in a similar boat.

268
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:51,220
I'm not like a super like Laura rings nerd, but I like enjoying a shit show with the people.

269
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:54,260
Yeah, exactly.

270
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:59,460
And I am like half of a nerd so I can get some of it, you know, half normie.

271
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:00,820
I think it's time, Kibbs.

272
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:05,620
I think it's time for us to watch this on one time speed.

273
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:06,420
Unfortunately.

274
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:09,540
Sorry, it's gonna be slow.

275
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:11,540
Ah, not a fucking commercial.

276
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:14,420
I need to pay for Prime.

277
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:17,060
Then they fucking have the audacity to show me commercials too.

278
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:19,540
I need your oath.

279
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:20,340
Oh my simp.

280
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:22,580
Maybe you can simp harder, simp.

281
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:25,860
That's not simping if I'm criticizing it.

282
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:27,940
Please skip the recap.

283
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:30,660
Are you sure you want to skip it?

284
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:34,340
Yes, they're recapping barely anything.

285
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:37,620
What about the intro?

286
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:38,500
Skip, skip it.

287
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:39,540
Skip all of it.

288
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:40,580
Skip the episode, Kibbs.

289
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:41,780
We'll just pretend we watched it.

290
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:43,940
Look at the rocks, Deb.

291
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:46,820
Look, more rocks.

292
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:51,140
Oh, you broke it down.

293
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:54,340
It's all those viewers.

294
00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:56,500
That's what that's what it's so laggy.

295
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:59,700
Oh God, no, no, no.

296
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,500
Yes, yes.

297
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:04,020
We've gone too long without seeing them.

298
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:06,420
Ah, fucking off, it's...

299
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:09,620
I wish they would clean their hairs.

300
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:11,700
No.

301
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:13,460
He's totally getting a makeover later.

302
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:16,420
So Mauler and I have a friendly bet

303
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:19,860
of an unspecified sum of money on who this guy actually is.

304
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:23,220
I say Sauron, he says Gandalf.

305
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:28,260
I mean, if it's Gandalf, that defies the lore, but okay.

306
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:32,340
I do think it's like a minor wizard like Gandalf, that's mine.

307
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:33,620
One of the blue guys?

308
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:34,900
Yeah, something like that.

309
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:38,340
What the fuck is on your head?

310
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:41,460
It's camouflage.

311
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:42,340
This is fashion.

312
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:46,260
Singing is very Tolkien.

313
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:48,820
You guys could have gone around that.

314
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:52,660
Like, they showed away just over there.

315
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:54,180
Sure, it's like right next to it.

316
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:01,140
This has gone on long enough.

317
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:03,540
This is exactly what the books are like, though.

318
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:07,140
But it's like she has another long song.

319
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:11,940
I sang for three days straight.

320
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:14,340
Wait, don't put that in.

321
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:16,180
Don't put it in the movie.

322
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:18,420
That is some high fucking quality iron work in right there.

323
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:20,820
The entire rest is just a musical.

324
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:25,780
Oh yeah, I can definitely see the good guy energy.

325
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:27,080
Yeah.

326
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:29,960
In that giant eye he left on the ground.

327
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:32,760
Listen, the sun is a symbol of good.

328
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:35,000
Mauler, I'm coming to collect, buddy.

329
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:35,560
Uh oh.

330
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:36,840
Meesa Malkor.

331
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:37,960
Are we going to see Eminem?

332
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:40,280
Yep.

333
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:42,520
Oh good, they're dressed all in white too.

334
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:45,480
White's the common color of evil.

335
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:46,760
Is that a girl or a boy?

336
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:49,560
I'm genuinely not sure.

337
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:50,280
I think it's a girl.

338
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:51,960
Well, it appears to have tits.

339
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:54,680
Although that means anything these days, but still.

340
00:16:54,680 --> 00:17:00,200
The message of the show is that androgynous people are evil, by the way.

341
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:04,680
That was like an old demonic trope, wasn't it?

342
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:06,600
Like demons have both genitals and stuff?

343
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:08,360
Slimash.

344
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,560
Oh look, the orcs are out in the sun again and don't really care.

345
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:14,040
Well, he seems to be under a hood.

346
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:15,720
He looks very uncomfortable.

347
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:17,000
He's wearing his hijab.

348
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:23,960
Global warming will block out the sun.

349
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:29,320
Global warming is actually good because it hurts orcs.

350
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:31,960
You need SPF 50, at least.

351
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:34,760
Ah, we're gonna have a speech.

352
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:35,160
Good.

353
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:36,680
Wait, how did he get his armor back?

354
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:37,720
He lost it in the hole.

355
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:40,680
Details, details dev.

356
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,600
Excuse me, who put you in charge?

357
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:52,920
The scriptwriter, actually.

358
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:56,120
She's the only notable woman in this plotline, so she's in charge.

359
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:00,280
Oh, he's the guy that was corrupted by the sword, right?

360
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:05,480
Yes, follow the crack addict.

361
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:08,360
With a random guy over his mother.

362
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:13,240
I'm enjoying this, actually.

363
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:16,680
Maybe they can do a real hero's journey with this guy.

364
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:18,280
Now we just gotta find his Obi-Wan.

365
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:22,600
Come with me, forgive me for not sending words to you sooner.

366
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:27,000
Whenever I keep seeing that guy's name, I always think Phazon from Metroid.

367
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,560
When I speak, his ears close up.

368
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:32,520
It's conditioned.

369
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:38,920
We skipped ahead a few months.

370
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:41,400
Yeah, how did he get into prison?

371
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:42,760
What happened here?

372
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:47,720
Listen, he's been accepted into the trades guild now, okay?

373
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:49,240
When did this happen?

374
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,560
Yeah, he's asking questions again.

375
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:54,120
Make him stop.

376
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
I'm just except for the plot that's moving forward.

377
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:01,160
I'm certain your fellowship will prove just as invaluable once you make landfall.

378
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:04,840
Don't you dare say the word fellowship.

379
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:08,680
And 500 men to aid your people and place a crown on your head.

380
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:09,480
Five hundred?

381
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:10,760
That's it?

382
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:11,260
Wow.

383
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:15,720
Find another head to crown.

384
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:22,200
Wait, was that his guild crest?

385
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:24,760
No, I think that was his fancy little.

386
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:25,400
Okay, yeah.

387
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:29,400
It was like kind of mixing up in the symbolism there, but okay, yeah.

388
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:36,360
Guys, get some horses or something.

389
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:37,320
Jesus.

390
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:39,320
I mean, I guess they're kind of too small for him.

391
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:40,360
Get some llamas then.

392
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:40,760
I don't know.

393
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:52,600
I guess the nomadic people didn't actually bring any food for the journey.

394
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:57,800
Don't worry, Harfoot.

395
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:00,280
You put branches in your hair, they'll never find you.

396
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:03,880
Yes, perfect camouflage.

397
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:09,640
Wait, there's gonna be more bad CG dog?

398
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:19,480
Oh, yeah, they'll never get you in there.

399
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:29,400
No, that's more of a...

400
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:31,400
Oh, Lord.

401
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:38,120
Oh, and he always survived this far.

402
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:49,080
Whoa, I think it's a different mission.

403
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:50,120
I very think it's different.

404
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:56,840
Nothing like casting a thunderclap.

405
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:04,840
And so Galadriel mocks his force to humiliate some poor motherfucker.

406
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:09,800
Never mind, I was wrong.

407
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:11,560
She's gonna humiliate them all.

408
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:12,520
Like, this is easy.

409
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:13,400
It's just a woman.

410
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:15,240
He is an elf.

411
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:18,040
Humiliation in three...

412
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:20,040
No?

413
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:21,080
You gonna slow it down a bit?

414
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:26,440
When it's so predictable, it's boring.

415
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:33,400
My dude, you could swing even wider if you tried, but it'd be hard.

416
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:35,240
You're not even trying to hit her.

417
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:46,200
Okay, so if all 20 of you jump in, if you're gonna do it like this...

418
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,200
He'd still beat their asses.

419
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:52,120
He's gonna score a hit on her.

420
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:55,240
On the bright side, they didn't hate the choreography there.

421
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:56,120
Yeah, no.

422
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:59,080
It was slow enough we could actually see what's happening.

423
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:00,440
Yeah, and you know what?

424
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:06,600
To be fair, if someone was going to score a hit, it would have to be

425
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:08,680
like a named character.

426
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:12,040
Like this guy or Halbrandt, yeah.

427
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:22,280
Aww, I thought it was gonna be a Sildor.

428
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:24,600
That would have been a great way to get him back in.

429
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:28,680
Yeah, he was like a first-guess initiative.

430
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:32,520
Well, our expectations have been subverted.

431
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:35,720
And I'm disappointed even.

432
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:38,680
I was kind of like, oh, that's kind of a clever way to get a Sildor in.

433
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:41,880
No, no, don't worry.

434
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:43,560
The no-name character will get in.

435
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:48,680
Where did your racism go, father?

436
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:53,480
I've gotten some help with Sili lately.

437
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:54,040
He's like, what?

438
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:55,960
No, no.

439
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:59,160
Daddy's gotten some long-term racism in his sights.

440
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:01,480
Elves will take orders from us.

441
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:04,760
No, Marx, no.

442
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:07,640
You can't be secretly racist against the chosen people.

443
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:23,560
Man, I'm invested.

444
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:24,840
Things are happening.

445
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:26,200
I'm pleasantly surprised.

446
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:28,680
The story is moving, finally.

447
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:34,040
This feels like hour three of the season, not hour five.

448
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:42,280
But still the same.

449
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:45,720
My fingers aren't really icy in the morning, too.

450
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:47,320
I feel when it's three a.m.

451
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:49,880
and your G.F. wants to snuggle and she's freezing cold.

452
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:59,320
No, I'm not lucky enough that this will kill her.

453
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:07,400
Typically takes you people weeks just to decide to take her if I may.

454
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:15,480
But the hand of we shall have to send it home with you so it can be treated with the proper respect.

455
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:19,160
Only five minute walk.

456
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:20,040
She'll be fine.

457
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:23,240
Did he just chew him out of his table to people?

458
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:23,740
Yep.

459
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:26,520
It does certainly look that way.

460
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:27,960
Very impressive.

461
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:31,160
And he didn't even get the answer that he wanted in return.

462
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:34,840
Yeah, no, that was a very shrewd act of jury.

463
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:44,680
I still have a feeling they're going to do the Balrog like 1000 years there.

464
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:45,400
They're going to do it.

465
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:48,760
It's probably more in light.

466
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:51,000
It had wings in that shot.

467
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:53,640
Very controversial.

468
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:59,000
Keeping your promise to his people and ensuring the doom of your own.

469
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:03,400
Well, I guess we're just going to have to have a race war, aren't we?

470
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:05,900
Jesus.

471
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:07,800
Peace was never an option.

472
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:15,080
The light of the Eldar, our light is fading.

473
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:18,760
Did the dwarves find the orb or not?

474
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:26,680
I swore an oath to Durin.

475
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:30,140
To some.

476
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:33,560
That may now hold little weight.

477
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:35,400
I mean, that answer basically is yes.

478
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:37,180
Yeah.

479
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:48,680
That guy's definitely going to die.

480
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:51,800
He's got a nice death leg right there.

481
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:52,520
Oh, yeah, that's right.

482
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:54,360
Those are all of his friends that he fucked over.

483
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:58,840
You're only apologizing because you think now that I've been promoted.

484
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:00,680
I can get you on the expedition.

485
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:04,840
I would.

486
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:05,400
I would.

487
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:05,960
I would never.

488
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:18,680
But yes, he's committing sabotage.

489
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:19,400
How could he?

490
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:22,920
Don't you have more pressing things to worry about right now?

491
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:27,720
Start drinking it, guys.

492
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:30,040
Oh, wait, no, that's that's not alcohol.

493
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:32,840
Hand me the lantern.

494
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:34,460
Don't.

495
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:38,920
Yeah, yeah, make things worse.

496
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:42,520
Yeah, see, good job.

497
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:45,800
Good job, Isolde, you plot fuck.

498
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:47,000
Good job.

499
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:54,920
That's not quite how it works, but never mind.

500
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:58,440
It's an ammo detonation or to black powder.

501
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:02,440
Where did that one come from?

502
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:05,480
secondary explosions.

503
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:09,960
You know, that's how explosions work on another ship.

504
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:11,880
No, no, I'm the same.

505
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:13,960
That was the second ship.

506
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:22,760
Why are you lying for him?

507
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:25,560
This is how he gets on the expedition.

508
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:27,080
He's going to be a hero for saving him.

509
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:30,040
And all it took was sinking their fleet.

510
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:33,960
I mean, wouldn't it be a hero for cashing the saboteur?

511
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:35,800
Yeah, two ships.

512
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:36,300
Yeah.

513
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:39,480
So I guess the first ship exploded so hard.

514
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:41,480
The second one just went like, I want to do that, too.

515
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:42,540
Yep.

516
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:47,160
They remember Blackwater from Game of Thrones.

517
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:47,960
We can do that, too.

518
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:57,960
Enough to saturate every last elf in the light of the valor once more.

519
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:01,400
And yes.

520
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:04,220
Yes.

521
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:07,560
I don't think this is how Mithril works.

522
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:13,000
Yeah, see, what I remember is that the elves made the rings

523
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:16,680
to keep themselves from dying and their civilization from decaying.

524
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:19,640
But Mithril wasn't part of that story, as far as I can remember.

525
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:21,320
That the High King deceived me.

526
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:23,400
I'm pretty sure this is all bullshit.

527
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:25,720
Why do you keep fighting?

528
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:27,000
Because I cannot stop.

529
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:33,160
I believe they could no longer distinguish me from the evil I was fighting.

530
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:39,560
You know, that's not a bad twist.

531
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:40,200
I'm sorry.

532
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:41,800
She is a war crazy maniac.

533
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:43,580
Yeah.

534
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:49,480
The thing is, she's a very interesting character.

535
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:54,360
She's just not Galadriel, because this is actually a pretty great scene.

536
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:58,600
I know what a hammer and tongs is yours.

537
00:28:58,600 --> 00:28:59,640
If she wasn't, yeah.

538
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:00,700
Yeah.

539
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:05,400
Even then, though, like, her entire reasoning is based on I can't stop fighting.

540
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:06,860
Okay.

541
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:12,680
I don't mind that works, though.

542
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:13,640
I'm a psychologist.

543
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:17,240
Yeah, I don't mind the whole PTSD haunted.

544
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:21,400
Can't give up because, you know, she doesn't have PTSD.

545
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:23,320
She'd never fought in the fucking war.

546
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:23,820
Fair enough.

547
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:29,640
You know, the story of someone who's just consumed by violence.

548
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,080
The problem is she hasn't committed any violence.

549
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:36,200
That's also true.

550
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:38,280
They only have half the story here.

551
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:43,160
And plus, the linchpin is that this kind of character can't be Galadriel.

552
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:45,480
This is the kind of character who, like,

553
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:48,120
would have killed someone and then regretted it or something.

554
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:51,720
It would have worked.

555
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:56,440
They forgot about the other half of the story.

556
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:57,660
Yeah.

557
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:02,120
Didn't like that.

558
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:05,500
No.

559
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:10,040
He's a fucking elf, you moron.

560
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:11,800
He chose poorly.

561
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:26,840
All of his wounds have closed up, too.

562
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:28,360
It's that magic human loving.

563
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:30,040
There's something you don't know.

564
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:32,280
I've seen this before.

565
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:40,600
It is a key conjured by some forgotten craft of the enemy to enslave your ancestors.

566
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:41,240
Black device.

567
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:43,560
You appear to be mildly outnumbered.

568
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:47,080
You know, I didn't see the sword hilt being a key.

569
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:49,080
I didn't call that one.

570
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:50,520
This is like Helm's Deep Light.

571
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:55,000
They didn't have the budget, okay?

572
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:56,460
Okay.

573
00:30:58,200 --> 00:30:59,640
Store brand Helms Deep.

574
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:03,560
Walmart, you know, it's not very.

575
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:04,360
Oh, my God.

576
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:06,680
They brought the fucking tablet.

577
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:08,360
Wait, they're just carrying it back?

578
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,760
I think elves have horses, though.

579
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:20,280
All right, that's pretty good.

580
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,800
Give it to me raw.

581
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:36,920
That was a sudden fucking timeline, but okay.

582
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:37,980
Yeah.

583
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:42,600
Do you mean spring and a thousand years or a few months?

584
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:49,160
This is not how Mithra fucking works.

585
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:52,360
See, I'm assuming this is a way to make the whole dug too deep,

586
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:57,800
greedily into less of just a, you know, drew move and more of a move out of necessity.

587
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:01,480
But this isn't how Mithra works.

588
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:04,360
Where elven race as in my hands.

589
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:05,800
Whose hands?

590
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:09,580
Yours.

591
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:23,480
I do like that he actually went clean with them, though.

592
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:25,320
Didn't do anything shenanigans.

593
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:27,400
Yeah, I like the solution a lot better.

594
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:30,200
Better than the George R. R. Martin show.

595
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,600
He bought that awfully quick.

596
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:35,960
Then again, has been honest with him.

597
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:36,760
Hold on a second.

598
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:38,360
It's not a long journey back.

599
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:39,320
It's five minutes.

600
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:42,840
This is, you know, a screen transition.

601
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:47,000
Have we seen a horse in this show?

602
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:51,240
Incidentally, just I want to say yes.

603
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:54,840
A few times.

604
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:59,000
I think only a numinar, though, because I don't think the garrison had any horses.

605
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:04,360
Because of their cow, that fucking enormous slab of stone back.

606
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:08,200
Yeah, we saw a cow and it had all the black milk.

607
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:10,600
Oh, don't remind me.

608
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:11,560
That's gross.

609
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:13,160
That's like bad chocolate milk.

610
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:24,360
Maybe the show run is just really don't like horses.

611
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:28,360
Horses are expensive.

612
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:29,400
Somebody just stole it.

613
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:31,320
That's a trend.

614
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:32,520
He turned back to get it.

615
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:36,520
Attagon has decided that he wants to be king after all.

616
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:40,200
It's a thin line of like fucking soldiers.

617
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:40,840
Oh, my God.

618
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:47,640
I'm like Hawkeye right now on the lookout for that T-shirt with the printed armor pattern.

619
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:52,200
I want to see if we can catch it in the wild.

620
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:55,320
Face looks done.

621
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:57,560
I thought I'd point that out.

622
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:02,760
Listen, Kibs, I think she's a cutie.

623
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:03,320
I'd simp.

624
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:06,440
You disgust me, Death.

625
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:07,960
How could you?

626
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:11,640
I'd sub to her OnlyFans.

627
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:16,040
Wow, you've got that kind of free spending money.

628
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:19,000
I think they're wearing the shirt now.

629
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,840
Maybe take a close look at those dudes.

630
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:24,280
They are in the armpit in the armpit.

631
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:24,920
Oh, my God.

632
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:25,640
They actually have it.

633
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:28,440
Where did she get that from?

634
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:34,120
Where did she get that from?

635
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:37,000
She got it from the promotional department.

636
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:41,880
She swam here, and I'm pretty sure she didn't bring that.

637
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:42,440
She didn't.

638
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:43,800
Where was it?

639
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:45,800
I guess they just made it for her.

640
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:46,680
Where was it?

641
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:48,680
I guess they just made it for her.

642
00:34:48,680 --> 00:34:55,880
Maybe they just made it like the same armor and everything.

643
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:57,960
Yeah, no, that is the exact same armor.

644
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:01,000
That's right.

645
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,960
Because she wore that suit before at the start of the show,

646
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,080
but she left it behind when she got on the boat.

647
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:10,280
So they just made her identical armor,

648
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:11,640
and she just described it to them.

649
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:15,640
I guess it's very stupid that I want you to know that.

650
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:21,560
Did the show just forget that she swam here?

651
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:22,920
I mean, Arch, I wish I could.

652
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:27,800
So I need mastercrafted elven armor with intricate patterning,

653
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:29,560
and I need it like next week.

654
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:32,200
All right, come right up, boss.

655
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:33,320
We made a styrofoam.

656
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:35,320
I'm paying you an explosion.

657
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:42,040
I really hate those sales, by the way.

658
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:47,640
Listen, Arch, they catch wind, except the wind that goes in between them.

659
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:50,840
Except for the wind that goes in between there.

660
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:55,240
That's caught by the front sail, which catches the future wind.

661
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:56,520
Singing.

662
00:35:57,720 --> 00:35:58,520
No, it's fine.

663
00:35:58,520 --> 00:35:59,400
We don't need singing.

664
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:01,320
No, we don't need it.

665
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:02,200
We don't need it, Kyle.

666
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:03,960
Don't you want it?

667
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:09,720
That was an episode of a TV show, if nothing else.

668
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:12,840
I'm still not particularly involved, honestly.

669
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:14,120
Wait a second, Kibbs.

670
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:16,440
Kibbs, turn it off.

671
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:17,320
What was that?

672
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:18,280
Enormous fuck up.

673
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:21,880
Jesus.

674
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:22,440
All right.

675
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:28,280
OK, so I think I've finally discovered my major issue with this show

676
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:29,480
after watching this episode.

677
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:32,760
OK, I formulated my dev thesis.

678
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:33,960
Oh, here we go.

679
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:36,840
Everything happening in this show is a mystery box.

680
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:40,600
It's all mystery box writing and mystery boxes that have become

681
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:45,400
they've like steadily gained in popularity since since lost back in the 2000s.

682
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:46,040
Right.

683
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:48,200
People love their mystery box writing.

684
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:50,680
The problem with a mystery box in a prequel, though,

685
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:52,760
is that we know where it's going to go.

686
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:56,920
You know, like, what's the ore going to be?

687
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:58,120
Oh, it's going to be mithril.

688
00:36:58,120 --> 00:36:59,160
What are the rings going to do?

689
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:02,600
Oh, we know all this stuff already because we know where it goes.

690
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:05,880
So they have to either change the lore, which is no good,

691
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:09,400
or they have to introduce mystery boxes

692
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:13,080
that don't really have any consequence to the wider story.

693
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:19,400
The idea that mithril is solid light that can reinvigorate the elves

694
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:24,920
does have enormous significance for the wider story.

695
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:29,160
In fact, it has ridiculous significance for the wider story.

696
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:31,240
Yeah, and that's the changing the lore part.

697
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:31,740
Yeah.

698
00:37:32,140 --> 00:37:33,020
And see, that's the problem.

699
00:37:33,020 --> 00:37:37,260
I fucking hate mystery boxes because I view them as lazy ass goddamn writing.

700
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:38,220
It's simply just.

701
00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:43,580
And then this magical thing appeared because it has no sense or reason.

702
00:37:43,580 --> 00:37:46,540
OK, so the the people were enslaved by a sword.

703
00:37:46,540 --> 00:37:49,500
No, that's that's not how this fucking functions.

704
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:52,700
The sword of Sauron does not have the power to enslave a people.

705
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:54,940
So they just have to make that shit up and go like,

706
00:37:54,940 --> 00:37:56,940
there's a mural over there with a sword on it.

707
00:37:56,940 --> 00:37:58,460
That's why it's a key.

708
00:37:58,460 --> 00:38:00,540
You're pulling this out of your ass.

709
00:38:00,540 --> 00:38:02,540
Yeah, it's kind of like there's a key.

710
00:38:02,540 --> 00:38:05,100
It's like, OK, do we know it's a key?

711
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:08,140
Like, have you what evidence do you have suggestions like,

712
00:38:08,140 --> 00:38:11,340
well, you see, I knew about this mural here from 200 years ago.

713
00:38:11,340 --> 00:38:16,460
It's like, OK, I think that the show is like very safe in a lot of ways.

714
00:38:17,340 --> 00:38:19,820
Like with other shows, there are these moments where like,

715
00:38:19,820 --> 00:38:22,140
oh, my God, that's like crazy.

716
00:38:22,140 --> 00:38:26,300
And it really like I don't know, there's great moments of awe.

717
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:29,900
I feel like this show is like scared to really give those to you.

718
00:38:30,620 --> 00:38:31,740
Yeah, aside from the CG.

719
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:35,420
Yeah, just like the everyday CG.

720
00:38:35,420 --> 00:38:40,460
I think they might be trapped in the confines of it being a sequel.

721
00:38:40,460 --> 00:38:43,820
So there's so much they can do a prequel.

722
00:38:43,820 --> 00:38:44,940
Yeah, yeah.

723
00:38:44,940 --> 00:38:47,180
There's only so much they can do with that.

724
00:38:47,180 --> 00:38:50,540
But they have so much lore they could have done something with.

725
00:38:50,540 --> 00:38:53,100
And instead, they're just there's not doing it.

726
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:57,420
They could have written the story that Tolkien wrote.

727
00:38:57,420 --> 00:38:58,540
They're not interested in that.

728
00:38:58,540 --> 00:39:01,580
They are interested in actively fucking it because they're

729
00:39:01,580 --> 00:39:03,340
interested in actively claiming it.

730
00:39:03,340 --> 00:39:05,580
This is to be Amazon's Lord of the Rings.

731
00:39:06,220 --> 00:39:08,060
That's why they are looking at me.

732
00:39:08,060 --> 00:39:11,580
So now I'm going like, oh, yeah, this is a magic metal that the elves need.

733
00:39:11,580 --> 00:39:13,340
Oh, it isn't the writers.

734
00:39:13,340 --> 00:39:16,380
The new writing team is trying to make this their own project.

735
00:39:16,380 --> 00:39:20,700
And I understand why, because they're trying to adapt it, but into their workflow.

736
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:26,540
But the issue is you got to have a better understanding of what Tolkien's vision was.

737
00:39:27,180 --> 00:39:29,340
And instead of making your vision,

738
00:39:29,340 --> 00:39:31,980
you should instead being trying to follow in his footsteps

739
00:39:32,540 --> 00:39:35,500
to try to complete what he was going for to begin with.

740
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:38,140
Well, they did directly say that this is this is

741
00:39:39,100 --> 00:39:42,060
they're like breaking free out from Tolkien's shadow.

742
00:39:42,060 --> 00:39:44,940
And this is this is the Lord of the Rings that Tolkien never wrote.

743
00:39:44,940 --> 00:39:48,060
And they said a lot of that stuff and the lead up to the show.

744
00:39:48,060 --> 00:39:54,060
So they were really they were really setting the stage for them saying, yeah, fuck lore.

745
00:39:54,060 --> 00:39:57,100
Which is very disrespectful to the the fans.

746
00:39:57,100 --> 00:39:59,020
It's disrespectful to the source material.

747
00:39:59,020 --> 00:40:01,420
It's disrespectful to the the author.

748
00:40:01,420 --> 00:40:05,660
You shouldn't you shouldn't try to dismiss the author that came before you.

749
00:40:05,660 --> 00:40:07,260
The guy who built all of this.

750
00:40:07,260 --> 00:40:10,060
Instead, you should honor that work and should do your best

751
00:40:10,060 --> 00:40:13,260
to try to pay homage to his vision.

752
00:40:13,260 --> 00:40:17,500
And well, it's also the fucking hubris of it.

753
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:19,900
Like these are people that go like, no, no, we can do way better.

754
00:40:19,900 --> 00:40:22,940
Like, I'm sorry, but this is no goddamn Lord of the Rings.

755
00:40:22,940 --> 00:40:24,060
This is not even close.

756
00:40:24,060 --> 00:40:29,820
Like, if I'm being generous now, I might lift the show to like a five or a six.

757
00:40:29,820 --> 00:40:31,500
And they're like, oh, we know better.

758
00:40:32,060 --> 00:40:34,620
Yeah, out of ten out of 100.

759
00:40:34,620 --> 00:40:37,900
Lore complaints aside, how would the show in a vacuum?

760
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:39,660
What are you all thinking?

761
00:40:40,540 --> 00:40:41,740
Oh, that's the best.

762
00:40:42,860 --> 00:40:43,900
Pretty average.

763
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:44,860
Impressive scene.

764
00:40:44,860 --> 00:40:45,900
All right.

765
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:47,340
For a random show.

766
00:40:48,140 --> 00:40:49,420
Yeah, it is there.

767
00:40:49,420 --> 00:40:49,900
They're right.

768
00:40:49,900 --> 00:40:51,580
I feel like it's got them first.

769
00:40:52,460 --> 00:40:55,420
Well, it just feels like it's always on like the precipice

770
00:40:55,420 --> 00:40:57,900
of like something really interesting happening.

771
00:40:57,900 --> 00:41:00,460
Where like you get these scenes with Galadriel and you're like,

772
00:41:00,460 --> 00:41:03,260
oh, like maybe her character is going to go in this direction.

773
00:41:03,260 --> 00:41:05,100
And that would be really interesting.

774
00:41:05,100 --> 00:41:07,740
Or it just happens with like every character.

775
00:41:07,740 --> 00:41:13,340
And it is kind of like the mystery box thing where it's hard to judge it

776
00:41:13,340 --> 00:41:16,940
because it's kind of promising a lot.

777
00:41:16,940 --> 00:41:19,660
It's like, listen, guys, it's going to get really good.

778
00:41:19,660 --> 00:41:21,500
It's kind of what the show is constantly saying.

779
00:41:22,300 --> 00:41:25,420
And if it delivers on that, that's cool.

780
00:41:25,420 --> 00:41:27,580
And then you can just say, well, it was a bit slow.

781
00:41:27,580 --> 00:41:32,620
But if it doesn't deliver on it, then that'll make all the previous moments

782
00:41:32,620 --> 00:41:34,380
feel a lot more cheap.

783
00:41:34,380 --> 00:41:36,220
It hasn't delivered yet, I don't think.

784
00:41:36,780 --> 00:41:41,260
No, it's writing with a presumed presumption.

785
00:41:41,260 --> 00:41:44,860
Like they've made up a story and now they're working their way towards it.

786
00:41:44,860 --> 00:41:49,020
Now suddenly Galadriel is like, oh, no, I just have to fight

787
00:41:49,020 --> 00:41:50,140
because okay, why do you have to fight?

788
00:41:50,140 --> 00:41:51,020
Well, I don't know about that.

789
00:41:51,020 --> 00:41:54,860
But this is my reason, you see, I'm becoming evil and I see it now.

790
00:41:54,860 --> 00:41:57,020
You haven't presented this previously.

791
00:41:57,020 --> 00:41:59,420
This at no point earlier, was there any indication

792
00:41:59,420 --> 00:42:02,700
that Galadriel was doing this for any sort of outside force?

793
00:42:02,700 --> 00:42:07,180
Like the only reasonable rationale appeared to be vengeance for her brother

794
00:42:07,180 --> 00:42:08,780
because that's all where it started.

795
00:42:08,780 --> 00:42:11,260
She didn't fight in the war against Morgoth.

796
00:42:11,260 --> 00:42:12,780
She hasn't seen action.

797
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:15,340
And this is like, I'm an expert in fighting orcs.

798
00:42:15,340 --> 00:42:17,180
You probably haven't even seen one.

799
00:42:18,140 --> 00:42:20,300
She hasn't deserved any of this.

800
00:42:20,300 --> 00:42:23,020
And now she has a scene, which is a decent scene,

801
00:42:23,020 --> 00:42:24,780
but it's not for her character.

802
00:42:24,780 --> 00:42:26,220
It's for another character.

803
00:42:26,220 --> 00:42:31,900
But I mean, I think it is like, okay, if she's just like delusional a little bit, right?

804
00:42:31,900 --> 00:42:38,540
Like, no, just like someone who's like young and like, I mean in elf years,

805
00:42:38,540 --> 00:42:43,100
but like relatively young and wants to prove themselves and believes

806
00:42:43,100 --> 00:42:45,340
that they can do all of these things,

807
00:42:45,340 --> 00:42:48,540
but ultimately is going to kind of be disillusioned

808
00:42:48,540 --> 00:42:53,180
and then has to move through that disillusionment to like fulfill their character arc.

809
00:42:53,180 --> 00:42:55,420
I think that that's like an interesting character arc.

810
00:42:55,420 --> 00:42:57,660
That's definitely an archetype that can be good.

811
00:42:59,180 --> 00:43:01,900
Issue is one, she's one of the oldest elves alive

812
00:43:02,460 --> 00:43:05,420
and two, she's not going to be moving through anything.

813
00:43:05,420 --> 00:43:07,820
She is like right now though.

814
00:43:09,020 --> 00:43:10,460
She is one of the oldest elves alive.

815
00:43:11,580 --> 00:43:12,080
Damn.

816
00:43:12,940 --> 00:43:14,140
Yeah, that's what I mean.

817
00:43:14,140 --> 00:43:16,060
This is the wrong character to do that story with.

818
00:43:16,780 --> 00:43:18,300
And she is not going to move through it.

819
00:43:18,300 --> 00:43:19,900
She cannot be allowed to fail.

820
00:43:19,900 --> 00:43:25,340
Like she takes on like what, six, seven people and humiliates them utterly.

821
00:43:25,340 --> 00:43:28,380
And the best one manages to do is scratch her clothing,

822
00:43:28,380 --> 00:43:30,300
which doesn't even fulfill the actual.

823
00:43:30,300 --> 00:43:32,540
She is an elf in fairness.

824
00:43:32,540 --> 00:43:33,900
And they're all humans.

825
00:43:33,900 --> 00:43:34,380
That's true.

826
00:43:34,380 --> 00:43:35,100
Yeah, but that's the thing.

827
00:43:35,100 --> 00:43:36,460
Elves aren't that fucking good.

828
00:43:36,460 --> 00:43:37,580
That's that's the thing too.

829
00:43:38,220 --> 00:43:40,220
Hold on, Arch, hold on.

830
00:43:40,220 --> 00:43:41,420
I'm going to disagree with you here,

831
00:43:41,420 --> 00:43:44,940
because Legolas did surf on a shield down a staircase.

832
00:43:44,940 --> 00:43:47,900
Okay, no, elves are like supernaturally talented.

833
00:43:47,900 --> 00:43:51,900
And also she has like hundreds of years of experience on these people.

834
00:43:51,900 --> 00:43:52,860
No, she doesn't.

835
00:43:52,860 --> 00:43:53,740
She does not.

836
00:43:53,740 --> 00:43:58,220
She's been fighting a war for a couple of years, tops.

837
00:43:58,220 --> 00:44:01,580
Yeah, but she's had lots of time to train and practice.

838
00:44:01,580 --> 00:44:02,300
She hasn't.

839
00:44:02,300 --> 00:44:03,260
She's collateral.

840
00:44:03,260 --> 00:44:04,540
She hasn't trained.

841
00:44:04,540 --> 00:44:07,500
She's never picked up a sword before her brother died.

842
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:10,140
That's like explicitly like she's never trained.

843
00:44:10,860 --> 00:44:12,860
Yes, because there wasn't a war.

844
00:44:12,860 --> 00:44:16,860
Like the concept of war didn't exist until Morgoth appeared.

845
00:44:16,860 --> 00:44:18,140
Yep, that's true.

846
00:44:18,140 --> 00:44:20,620
Yeah, the whole thing about Galadriel is she's not a warrior.

847
00:44:20,620 --> 00:44:23,340
And the story, she's actually a sorcerer.

848
00:44:23,340 --> 00:44:24,300
Yeah, she was a sorceress.

849
00:44:24,300 --> 00:44:27,020
Yeah, she was supposed to be like a backline kind of person.

850
00:44:27,020 --> 00:44:29,420
So it's very weird that she's taking this front line.

851
00:44:29,420 --> 00:44:30,780
Because Galadriel is clever.

852
00:44:30,780 --> 00:44:32,220
She's very powerful.

853
00:44:32,220 --> 00:44:34,380
In fact, very powerful.

854
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:37,900
She's one of the most powerful characters on the side of good.

855
00:44:37,980 --> 00:44:42,220
I guess you could say in terms of her actual magical capabilities.

856
00:44:42,220 --> 00:44:45,660
But she's always reserved because she's more of a tactician.

857
00:44:45,660 --> 00:44:49,260
She's always thinking ahead about the general positioning of things.

858
00:44:49,260 --> 00:44:50,700
She's never directly involved.

859
00:44:51,260 --> 00:44:55,180
And that's kind of the problem with the show is they've kind of butchered her character.

860
00:44:55,180 --> 00:44:59,100
Her brilliance is diminished and her intellect is diminished.

861
00:44:59,100 --> 00:45:02,940
Because instead of her intellect being her strength, it's not even her strength.

862
00:45:02,940 --> 00:45:04,460
She's kind of an idiot.

863
00:45:04,460 --> 00:45:06,220
She feels I could see that.

864
00:45:06,220 --> 00:45:07,260
She's kind of a warrior.

865
00:45:07,500 --> 00:45:09,820
They've taken away her brilliance.

866
00:45:09,820 --> 00:45:11,580
And that's the part that bothers me.

867
00:45:12,300 --> 00:45:15,900
Because she's supposed to be very, very smart.

868
00:45:15,900 --> 00:45:17,660
She's supposed to see the broader picture.

869
00:45:18,460 --> 00:45:20,540
And she kind of did in the beginning.

870
00:45:20,540 --> 00:45:22,380
She understood Sauron was still around.

871
00:45:22,380 --> 00:45:24,540
But they didn't really, they should have focused on that.

872
00:45:24,540 --> 00:45:26,860
Like, okay, like, all right, how do you understand that?

873
00:45:26,860 --> 00:45:31,420
Like, show us how you put those pieces of the puzzle together so that you came up with it.

874
00:45:31,420 --> 00:45:33,260
Like, no, no, Sauron's still a threat.

875
00:45:33,260 --> 00:45:34,300
And here's why.

876
00:45:34,300 --> 00:45:36,620
Here's all these really, like, well thought out reasons.

877
00:45:36,620 --> 00:45:37,820
All these clues and evidence.

878
00:45:37,820 --> 00:45:40,220
But she saw it at emblem, Kibbs.

879
00:45:40,220 --> 00:45:42,460
Yeah, and they, I know, but they do it.

880
00:45:42,460 --> 00:45:46,780
They just do it like, oh, she found it in an archive and she finally now got the proof.

881
00:45:46,780 --> 00:45:48,700
It's like, that's not very Galadriel.

882
00:45:48,700 --> 00:45:52,060
Galadriel's like, she's supposed to be smarter than this.

883
00:45:52,060 --> 00:45:52,460
I don't know.

884
00:45:52,460 --> 00:45:54,140
It feels like a disservice to the character.

885
00:45:54,140 --> 00:45:56,700
Her, too, get back to the point about the fighting skills.

886
00:45:56,700 --> 00:46:01,420
Even Legolas, who was an exceptional fighter by even elven standards.

887
00:46:02,220 --> 00:46:06,860
He only takes on a couple of enemies at once and kills them quickly.

888
00:46:06,860 --> 00:46:09,980
Like, at no point is Legolas under attack by, like, six,

889
00:46:09,980 --> 00:46:13,900
seven orcs and carrying out a lengthy duel against them whilst not killing them.

890
00:46:14,620 --> 00:46:15,100
I don't know.

891
00:46:15,100 --> 00:46:17,500
I feel like this is not the most unbelievable thing.

892
00:46:17,500 --> 00:46:21,260
Like, these are, like, not super trained recruits that are just like kids.

893
00:46:21,260 --> 00:46:24,220
Yeah, well, two of those people were sea guard trainees.

894
00:46:24,220 --> 00:46:27,740
They were the ones who were kicked out of the sea guard after Isildur did these things.

895
00:46:27,740 --> 00:46:29,660
They are trained fighters.

896
00:46:29,660 --> 00:46:30,300
That's true.

897
00:46:30,380 --> 00:46:31,580
There's at least two of them that are.

898
00:46:31,580 --> 00:46:35,180
I know that they recruited a lot of raw guys, though.

899
00:46:35,180 --> 00:46:42,700
And plus, the boss man said that they had more recruits than they had spaces.

900
00:46:42,700 --> 00:46:44,300
These aren't randos from the street.

901
00:46:44,300 --> 00:46:45,900
He has the pick of the crop.

902
00:46:45,900 --> 00:46:46,460
I don't know.

903
00:46:46,460 --> 00:46:50,460
I mean, like, I feel like these guys have not really seen war either, though.

904
00:46:50,460 --> 00:46:55,580
Like, most of their training is gonna be just, you know, practice.

905
00:46:56,140 --> 00:47:01,260
I think the implication is that they're inexperienced and they haven't seen proper.

906
00:47:01,260 --> 00:47:02,060
Right.

907
00:47:02,060 --> 00:47:04,780
That's like my reading of their characters.

908
00:47:04,780 --> 00:47:07,100
I think that's what that's what they're trying to do,

909
00:47:07,660 --> 00:47:12,380
but I'm not sure if they necessarily got that across, but I kind of see it.

910
00:47:12,380 --> 00:47:13,100
Yeah.

911
00:47:13,100 --> 00:47:16,540
Okay, that'll do it for this week.

912
00:47:16,540 --> 00:47:18,220
Thanks for being here, everyone.

913
00:47:18,220 --> 00:47:19,660
Welcome aboard, Taftash.

914
00:47:19,660 --> 00:47:20,540
Thanks, Dev.

915
00:47:20,540 --> 00:47:22,300
Hey, just a curiosity.

916
00:47:22,300 --> 00:47:26,620
If we do continue to do this stuff, what show do we do next after this one's over?

917
00:47:27,340 --> 00:47:28,940
You guys want to do She-Hulk?

918
00:47:28,940 --> 00:47:29,340
No.

919
00:47:29,340 --> 00:47:31,020
I don't mind doing She-Hulk.

920
00:47:31,020 --> 00:47:32,780
It seems cringy enough.

921
00:47:34,060 --> 00:47:35,580
God, you guys are masochists.

922
00:47:36,380 --> 00:47:36,940
I don't know.

923
00:47:38,940 --> 00:47:41,100
We'll watch the vine boom twerk.

924
00:47:42,220 --> 00:47:44,220
How much cancer do you want to contract?

925
00:47:44,220 --> 00:47:45,900
I'll catch them all, I guess.
