0	9840	So, for today's episode, halfway through watching the first season, Taftaj has hitched her her
9840	12040	cart to our ride. Welcome aboard.
12040	13680	It's true. Thanks, Deb.
13680	14680	So welcome aboard.
14680	15680	Taftaj.
15680	19880	Taftaj is a friend of mine from a different sector of the internet, and I figured we could
19880	25300	make the worlds collide. We'll see if we can bring you into like the arched Sargon sphere.
25300	27300	You can say hello to some people.
27300	31740	But the plan to infiltrate it begins.
31740	37700	So we are indeed halfway through the season, and you caught up to do this with us, right?
37700	38780	I did.
38780	42580	And how do you how do you feel about the first four episodes?
42580	46700	I'll be controversial and say that I didn't think they were that bad. I thought they were
46700	51720	they were very pretty. I'm not enough of a Lord of the Rings nerd to like notice every
51720	56860	detail and be like, um, actually, this is not correct. I've been enjoying it. I think
56860	61460	the pacing is a little bit slow, but it helps when you watch it on two times speed.
61460	66140	So wait, you've been watching it on two times speed?
66140	67620	I had to catch up somehow.
67620	74540	I mean, each episode is an hour long. I'll grant her that.
74540	79820	And after having watched it at 1x speed, I think, if anything, she's far smarter than
79820	80820	us.
80820	84460	Yeah, maybe it is more enjoyable on two times speed. Who knows?
84460	90100	I glance over I'm like, Oh, thank God, we're getting past the cringy parts and we're getting
90100	93500	straight to the pretty scene. And that's all good.
93500	97780	And you know, to be fair to the show, it does have some pretty good CG.
97780	99720	It does. It looks very expensive.
99720	103300	If you knew absolutely nothing about Lord of the Rings, and you just thought this was
103300	107300	some kind of Game of Thrones ish show, it might seem okay, but
107300	110340	What is your biggest critique of it so far?
110340	114660	Is that it's not Lord of the Rings, because Lord of the Rings has a specific style of
114660	119300	storytelling has a very specific world. And it's just none of those things, at least in
119300	120580	my opinion, what do you guys think?
120580	125620	I kind of feel like it's missing that Tolkien vibe. Because if it was a Tolkien story, everybody
125620	130420	be smoking the pipe. They always smoke pipes.
130420	133620	The man more pipe smoking. That's what it means.
133620	138340	Just hook it up. Everybody. This sorrow old guy should just like spend the show smoking
138340	141340	with the harpets.
141340	143500	Smoking the fireflies.
143500	149980	My biggest complaint is that it is aggressively not a Tolkien show, like they go out of their
149980	153180	way to de-talkinify it.
153180	158980	Disa is a perfect example of this because Disa is actually a quite good character, which
158980	164020	is acted out in a fairly good way. And if it was just that she was black, I'd be like
164020	170260	2022. But no, they also had to shave her, which genuinely annoys me because like, okay,
170260	175980	you had a good character, a good actress here. And then you just have to have a middle finger.
175980	180420	Even in the Peter Jackson films, because I watched Return of the King today, actually,
180420	185740	and one of the scenes where the the Gondorian and Rohirric army are marching towards the
185740	189540	Black Gate. There's actually a Black Gondorian in the background, but it doesn't bother me
189540	193540	in the slightest because, well, it's not done in such a way to be like, oh, we're being
193540	198580	different. We're doing it to modernize the story. It's like, no, they just needed an
198580	203060	extra actor and, you know, he fit the shoes. So good for him.
203060	208020	At the risk of sounding like, I don't know, a little bit racist. I think that the good
208020	213780	thing about the characters that are black in this show is that it doesn't feel like
213780	218100	they're drawing great attention to the fact that they're black. Like, I feel like these
218100	223060	characters are like just characters that happen to be black. And, you know, any sort
223060	229540	of like cultural associations to real world races seem like they're not really there.
229540	235060	So I think that like when I watch these characters, like I can just see them as dwarves and elves
235060	239340	with the only thing and like at the risk of retreading ground that we've already gone
239340	244580	over being like some aesthetic stuff. Like, I agree. It's a little bit weird to see like
244660	250020	very dwarfy characters and she like has barely any beard. I think that like does throw me off
250020	256260	a little bit. But besides that, I think that the skin colors of the characters have been
256260	261060	less jarring than I expected them to be. I will say this. The show is not actually
261060	264580	particularly woke in the traditional sense of the word.
264580	269220	I agree. It is. It is just in the casting choice and the fact that they seem to be making
270180	274420	an effort to undermine Tolkien's work in minigames.
274420	279220	Like, imagine if they played into like strong independent black woman stereotypes or something.
279940	281460	That would be like unbearable.
281460	287220	Imagine if they had contemporary allusions to like modern politics.
287220	288100	Exactly.
288100	292660	Especially like modern racial politics. Imagine if they had this like this is like
292660	293860	Which they haven't done yet.
294500	297940	Or hey, this is dissentus or whatever.
298740	300660	God, that would be awful.
300660	304020	Well, hold on a second, Leith, because we actually missed it in the last episode.
304020	307060	We were joking about something else and we actually let a line slip by
307620	314820	where there's that one rioter who says that elven workers are coming to steal the trades of Numenor.
315380	316020	That's true.
316980	318420	They had that one scene.
318420	321540	And then I DMed you. I was like based to deport the elves.
322740	326660	Notice how the the black elf character, one thing that's weird about him,
326660	329380	that's also kind of jarring, isn't necessarily the fact that he's black,
329380	332420	but it's the fact that he's missing one of the core things that elves have.
332980	335620	Sort of long, you know, beautiful flowing hair.
336500	337380	Also personality.
337380	339460	You're not sure of a few elves.
339460	343620	Because they shouldn't have short hair and stuff like that.
343620	349700	Because they're always described in the books as to have, you know, long, very beautiful flowing hair.
350580	356420	Again, it's one of those middle fingers that they know this isn't how elves look,
356420	359700	but they decide, OK, we got to fuck the communities out of my mind.
359700	363220	I also don't like Adam Deere's actor at all.
363220	366740	I think he's a plank of fucking wood who has precisely one facial expression.
366740	367780	He hasn't either.
367780	372500	They're not throwing him a bone or he's just not really taking the scenes by storm.
372500	375140	Like the what's that one bad guy shows up?
375140	378980	Remember, he stole that scene absolutely from under him.
378980	380580	Is it Adar or Adal?
380580	380980	Adar.
382900	384180	He shows up too.
384180	386180	That's great in terms of his acting.
386820	389380	Diversity higher elf is an actual nectar.
389380	390580	He's a fucking model.
391300	392340	Oh, God.
392340	393700	Is that why you suck so much?
394260	395300	That's why you suck so much in the camera.
395300	399780	Why would you give him like just have him play an extra, not be the front and center?
400580	401460	He does give up.
402020	405060	He does come across as a plank of wood for most of the movie.
405700	410020	I totally see like the model thing because it does seem like he's kind of making faces.
410980	411700	Blue steel.
412260	416180	I need to make a face for the for the cover art of this poster.
416420	416740	Okay.
419220	420260	Oh, God.
420260	423700	I think he's probably the worst character in the show.
423700	424900	There's no character to him.
425460	431060	Like Galadriel, even though she's not Galadriel from from the movies or the books, she at
431060	432340	least has a character.
432340	433620	She's she's angry.
433620	435860	It sort of happens to him.
437460	444420	He wanders around, he gets captured and then he becomes like the only survivor because
444420	445780	he's special or lucky.
446420	447780	Maybe he'll become a character.
447780	451300	And he gets to meet, I don't know, he gets to meet a dar.
452740	455540	He also gets to have some human pussy, some humusy.
456260	457300	Humusy, yes.
457300	458660	A hussy, if you will.
458660	463540	I mentioned last week that I got a package from Amazon with the Lord of the Rings tape.
463540	469940	Since uploading that video, I've been inundated with people posting me their images of Lord
469940	471380	of the Rings packages.
471380	474420	Apparently, everyone's getting this shit right now.
474420	476980	There's Lord of the Rings tape on Amazon boxes.
476980	478580	There's Lord of the Rings boxes.
479140	481220	Like if you order something from Amazon, it's big enough.
481220	483620	You just get it in a giant Lord of the Rings chest.
483620	486660	They're really going all out with the advertisement here for this show.
486660	488100	They really want people to watch this.
488100	489620	I'm kind of curious to see if it has an impact.
489620	491860	I got a Lord of the Rings wrapping with one of my packages.
491860	494900	Not all of them were Lord of the Rings packages, mind you.
494900	495300	Yeah.
495300	497380	They want us to watch the show.
497380	498980	I'm already watching it on Amazon.
498980	499860	I mean, of sorts.
500500	501220	Not paying for it.
502500	503860	Thank you for your sacrifice, Gibbs.
504100	505140	We appreciate it.
505140	509780	I was informed that apparently in the States, you guys get this all the time.
509780	513060	Like apparently, what was that one show called?
513060	514500	The Wheel of Time did it.
514500	517220	They had Wheel of Time advertisements in the packaging.
517220	518820	But this is the first time it's happened in Canada.
518820	519620	This is new to me.
519620	525700	You've also been covering the review scandal and the views and reviews.
525700	528260	I don't know, Taftage, if you heard about what's been going on.
528260	533540	But there's been some evidence that Amazon is drastically inflating their view numbers.
533860	540100	There's some evidence that Amazon is basically putting their finger on the scale of user
540100	543140	reviews to make the show look a lot better than it actually is.
543140	546100	I guess they just can't take the L on this one, you know.
546100	548980	I've got one bit of news to have on that front.
548980	556180	The reviews since the last time we did this dropped by 0.3 from their five star rating.
556180	559060	So they are dipping down slowly.
559060	563700	And the actual reviews that are coming out on mainstream reviews, news sites, you know,
563700	567940	they're finally starting to say by episode four that it's just not a very good show.
568580	574020	And you can see it on Forbes and you can see it on even Screen Rant, which is, you know,
574020	575460	very ideologically inclined.
575460	578340	Even they said that Gladriel at this point is just unlikable.
578340	581620	Oh, how could they say that about such a strong and empowered woman?
582980	584340	Are you just sexist?
584980	590180	Speaking of that on The Guardian, The Rings of Power episode four, the queen stops being angry.
590180	594900	People are just ripping even even the corpos are ripping into the show at this point.
594900	597380	That's a very bad sign.
597380	597940	Yeah.
597940	598660	Yeah.
598660	603460	So here's the most positive corporate review that I've found for the for episode four.
603460	603860	OK.
603860	605620	And this is on CBR dot com.
605620	609140	The Rings of Power episode four expertly blends triumph and tragedy.
609140	613860	The connections between the seemingly disparate plot threads are beginning to come together.
613860	618980	And halfway through season one, The Rings of Power is putting its pieces into motion.
618980	620900	Officially at the halfway to season one.
620900	621540	Yes.
621540	622100	Yes.
622100	627700	The show is briskly moving into its grander story, no longer fixated on introducing new
627700	630420	characters and plot lines officially at the halfway mark.
630420	634500	The Rings of Power season one is ready to cut loose, and the back half of the season
634500	638820	is poised to deliver the high fantasy goods as its story ramps into high gear.
640020	641380	That's that's the praise.
641380	642500	It'll get good guys.
642500	643540	Trust us.
643540	644180	Hold on.
644180	646500	It sounds it's going to get better.
646500	647300	It'll be fair.
647300	651140	The recent episodes happened better than the first one.
651140	651620	Yes.
651620	652980	Yes, I completely agree.
652980	653380	Yeah.
653380	656420	The first two were just nothing like nothing existed.
656420	657300	Nothing happened.
657300	660260	It was just characters being characters.
660260	661060	It was very slow.
662100	663140	Yeah, I agree.
663140	666740	So everyone has been saying about the show that it's a slow burn, guys, the slow burn.
666740	667380	And fair enough.
667380	669300	I've watched some slow burn shows.
669300	671460	You know, I really like Star Trek, Deep Space Nine.
671460	672980	That show is a slow fucking burn.
672980	673300	That's good.
673300	675780	That's like a two season slow burn on that show.
675780	676020	OK.
676100	676660	So I get it.
676660	679780	I understand it builds into something at the end.
679780	680900	That's the nice part.
680900	684020	All of that was building towards a greater idea.
684020	684340	Yes.
684340	686020	That's why the payoff was so good.
686020	690420	So if there's no payoff on this, it's going to be it's going to be really bad by the end of it.
690420	691540	You know what I will say?
691540	693860	So Star Wars and or just came out, right?
693860	695780	And I decided to watch that show.
695780	699140	They launched three episodes on their release day that came out last night.
699140	700100	So I watched that.
700100	700820	And you know what?
701540	704820	It's not super amazing, but it's OK.
704820	706740	And it actually is a real slow burn.
706740	710420	I was pleasantly surprised that now it's got fuck all to do with Star Wars because I don't know,
710420	712900	for some reason, Disney doesn't know what the fuck to do with this property.
712900	716980	But it's like it's an OK show and they're actually doing a slow burn.
716980	718660	Things do happen every scene.
718660	722660	A story is progressing and they're just let there's chew in the fat a bit, you know,
722660	726340	as compared to this show, which just did nothing for the first two hours.
726340	731620	The guys who are making Andal, he he literally said that he couldn't care less about Star Wars.
731620	733140	He wanted to make a spy thriller.
734100	735060	And here's the thing.
736740	738260	It's actually a good spy thriller.
738260	738980	Like, it's not bad.
738980	742180	I'm actually enjoying it, but it shouldn't even have Star Wars attached to it.
742180	746660	You can just make this as like a random sci fi, whatever, and it would be fine.
746660	748020	But they got to use Star Wars.
748020	748740	I don't know.
748740	749060	Huh?
749060	750740	Just make new things.
750740	752180	Just make new things, guys.
752180	752500	Come on.
752500	753380	It's OK.
753380	759700	If you're going to make something that isn't the property, don't make something else.
759700	763860	Simple as like, if I'm going to watch the Star Wars show, odds are I'm going to try
763860	765220	and watch a Star Wars show.
765220	766420	Yeah, I kind of agree.
766420	769220	Like, I want to watch Star Wars as a Star Wars fan.
769220	771780	I I kind of like to watch Star Wars.
773780	780500	I know that's a novel concept, but you don't want to see a rom com set in a Star Wars universe.
780500	781220	Not particularly.
781220	784580	No, you don't want to see a cooking show.
785620	786980	Oh, God, maybe.
786980	790500	I mean, that might be banger.
793380	795540	Well, they did that back in the holiday special.
795540	796020	Remember that?
796020	797060	Yeah, and that went well.
797060	798500	That went really well, didn't it?
800500	800900	God.
800900	803220	And it used to be the worst piece of Star Wars media.
803220	804500	So Taftash.
804500	804820	Yes.
805380	809940	This is the kind of nerds complaining about shit that you've signed up for.
809940	811060	How do you feel about it?
812260	813540	I feel good about it.
814900	815860	Feels great.
815860	821460	Even though I can't give insight on all of these properties, I'm I'm just happy to participate.
821460	823860	There have been like very much in a similar boat.
823860	831220	I'm not like a super like Laura rings nerd, but I like enjoying a shit show with the people.
831780	834260	Yeah, exactly.
834260	839460	And I am like half of a nerd so I can get some of it, you know, half normie.
839460	840820	I think it's time, Kibbs.
841460	845620	I think it's time for us to watch this on one time speed.
845620	846420	Unfortunately.
847300	849540	Sorry, it's gonna be slow.
849540	851540	Ah, not a fucking commercial.
853220	854420	I need to pay for Prime.
854420	857060	Then they fucking have the audacity to show me commercials too.
858260	859540	I need your oath.
859540	860340	Oh my simp.
860980	862580	Maybe you can simp harder, simp.
863780	865860	That's not simping if I'm criticizing it.
866740	867940	Please skip the recap.
869060	870660	Are you sure you want to skip it?
871140	874340	Yes, they're recapping barely anything.
876500	877620	What about the intro?
877620	878500	Skip, skip it.
878500	879540	Skip all of it.
879540	880580	Skip the episode, Kibbs.
880580	881780	We'll just pretend we watched it.
882820	883940	Look at the rocks, Deb.
885940	886820	Look, more rocks.
889860	891140	Oh, you broke it down.
893220	894340	It's all those viewers.
894340	896500	That's what that's what it's so laggy.
896500	899700	Oh God, no, no, no.
900900	902500	Yes, yes.
902500	904020	We've gone too long without seeing them.
904740	906420	Ah, fucking off, it's...
908180	909620	I wish they would clean their hairs.
910980	911700	No.
911700	913460	He's totally getting a makeover later.
914180	916420	So Mauler and I have a friendly bet
916420	919860	of an unspecified sum of money on who this guy actually is.
920580	923220	I say Sauron, he says Gandalf.
924820	928260	I mean, if it's Gandalf, that defies the lore, but okay.
928660	932340	I do think it's like a minor wizard like Gandalf, that's mine.
932340	933620	One of the blue guys?
933620	934900	Yeah, something like that.
936980	938340	What the fuck is on your head?
940500	941460	It's camouflage.
941460	942340	This is fashion.
944740	946260	Singing is very Tolkien.
947140	948820	You guys could have gone around that.
948820	952660	Like, they showed away just over there.
952660	954180	Sure, it's like right next to it.
958980	961140	This has gone on long enough.
961140	963540	This is exactly what the books are like, though.
964820	967140	But it's like she has another long song.
970100	971940	I sang for three days straight.
973540	974340	Wait, don't put that in.
975300	976180	Don't put it in the movie.
976180	978420	That is some high fucking quality iron work in right there.
978980	980820	The entire rest is just a musical.
983620	985780	Oh yeah, I can definitely see the good guy energy.
986580	987080	Yeah.
987880	989960	In that giant eye he left on the ground.
990600	992760	Listen, the sun is a symbol of good.
992760	995000	Mauler, I'm coming to collect, buddy.
995000	995560	Uh oh.
995560	996840	Meesa Malkor.
996840	997960	Are we going to see Eminem?
999480	1000280	Yep.
1000280	1002520	Oh good, they're dressed all in white too.
1002520	1005480	White's the common color of evil.
1005480	1006760	Is that a girl or a boy?
1007720	1009560	I'm genuinely not sure.
1009560	1010280	I think it's a girl.
1010280	1011960	Well, it appears to have tits.
1012680	1014680	Although that means anything these days, but still.
1014680	1020200	The message of the show is that androgynous people are evil, by the way.
1021880	1024680	That was like an old demonic trope, wasn't it?
1024680	1026600	Like demons have both genitals and stuff?
1027720	1028360	Slimash.
1029000	1031560	Oh look, the orcs are out in the sun again and don't really care.
1032440	1034040	Well, he seems to be under a hood.
1034040	1035720	He looks very uncomfortable.
1035720	1037000	He's wearing his hijab.
1042200	1043960	Global warming will block out the sun.
1045240	1049320	Global warming is actually good because it hurts orcs.
1049880	1051960	You need SPF 50, at least.
1053160	1054760	Ah, we're gonna have a speech.
1054760	1055160	Good.
1055160	1056680	Wait, how did he get his armor back?
1056680	1057720	He lost it in the hole.
1059080	1060680	Details, details dev.
1067000	1068600	Excuse me, who put you in charge?
1070920	1072920	The scriptwriter, actually.
1072920	1076120	She's the only notable woman in this plotline, so she's in charge.
1077880	1080280	Oh, he's the guy that was corrupted by the sword, right?
1083720	1085480	Yes, follow the crack addict.
1086520	1088360	With a random guy over his mother.
1092120	1093240	I'm enjoying this, actually.
1094200	1096680	Maybe they can do a real hero's journey with this guy.
1096680	1098280	Now we just gotta find his Obi-Wan.
1098280	1102600	Come with me, forgive me for not sending words to you sooner.
1102600	1107000	Whenever I keep seeing that guy's name, I always think Phazon from Metroid.
1107000	1109560	When I speak, his ears close up.
1111800	1112520	It's conditioned.
1117560	1118920	We skipped ahead a few months.
1119880	1121400	Yeah, how did he get into prison?
1122040	1122760	What happened here?
1124200	1127720	Listen, he's been accepted into the trades guild now, okay?
1128360	1129240	When did this happen?
1132200	1133560	Yeah, he's asking questions again.
1133560	1134120	Make him stop.
1135000	1137000	I'm just except for the plot that's moving forward.
1137720	1141160	I'm certain your fellowship will prove just as invaluable once you make landfall.
1142760	1144840	Don't you dare say the word fellowship.
1144840	1148680	And 500 men to aid your people and place a crown on your head.
1148680	1149480	Five hundred?
1150280	1150760	That's it?
1150760	1151260	Wow.
1154440	1155720	Find another head to crown.
1157720	1162200	Wait, was that his guild crest?
1162200	1164760	No, I think that was his fancy little.
1164760	1165400	Okay, yeah.
1166120	1169400	It was like kind of mixing up in the symbolism there, but okay, yeah.
1174520	1176360	Guys, get some horses or something.
1176360	1177320	Jesus.
1177320	1179320	I mean, I guess they're kind of too small for him.
1179320	1180360	Get some llamas then.
1180360	1180760	I don't know.
1188360	1192600	I guess the nomadic people didn't actually bring any food for the journey.
1196680	1197800	Don't worry, Harfoot.
1197800	1200280	You put branches in your hair, they'll never find you.
1201800	1203880	Yes, perfect camouflage.
1207560	1209640	Wait, there's gonna be more bad CG dog?
1217880	1219480	Oh, yeah, they'll never get you in there.
1228040	1229400	No, that's more of a...
1230600	1231400	Oh, Lord.
1236440	1238120	Oh, and he always survived this far.
1238120	1249080	Whoa, I think it's a different mission.
1249080	1250120	I very think it's different.
1255240	1256840	Nothing like casting a thunderclap.
1260680	1264840	And so Galadriel mocks his force to humiliate some poor motherfucker.
1269000	1269800	Never mind, I was wrong.
1269800	1271560	She's gonna humiliate them all.
1271560	1272520	Like, this is easy.
1272520	1273400	It's just a woman.
1274440	1275240	He is an elf.
1276280	1278040	Humiliation in three...
1279800	1280040	No?
1280040	1281080	You gonna slow it down a bit?
1284680	1286440	When it's so predictable, it's boring.
1289560	1293400	My dude, you could swing even wider if you tried, but it'd be hard.
1293400	1295240	You're not even trying to hit her.
1298120	1306200	Okay, so if all 20 of you jump in, if you're gonna do it like this...
1307000	1308200	He'd still beat their asses.
1310200	1312120	He's gonna score a hit on her.
1312120	1315240	On the bright side, they didn't hate the choreography there.
1315240	1316120	Yeah, no.
1316120	1319080	It was slow enough we could actually see what's happening.
1319080	1320440	Yeah, and you know what?
1321000	1326600	To be fair, if someone was going to score a hit, it would have to be
1327320	1328680	like a named character.
1329960	1332040	Like this guy or Halbrandt, yeah.
1340440	1342280	Aww, I thought it was gonna be a Sildor.
1342920	1344600	That would have been a great way to get him back in.
1345400	1348680	Yeah, he was like a first-guess initiative.
1349480	1352520	Well, our expectations have been subverted.
1353800	1355720	And I'm disappointed even.
1355720	1358680	I was kind of like, oh, that's kind of a clever way to get a Sildor in.
1360280	1361880	No, no, don't worry.
1361880	1363560	The no-name character will get in.
1366920	1368680	Where did your racism go, father?
1371880	1373480	I've gotten some help with Sili lately.
1373480	1374040	He's like, what?
1375480	1375960	No, no.
1375960	1379160	Daddy's gotten some long-term racism in his sights.
1379880	1381480	Elves will take orders from us.
1383080	1384760	No, Marx, no.
1384760	1387640	You can't be secretly racist against the chosen people.
1400840	1403560	Man, I'm invested.
1403560	1404840	Things are happening.
1404840	1406200	I'm pleasantly surprised.
1407400	1408680	The story is moving, finally.
1410920	1414040	This feels like hour three of the season, not hour five.
1414040	1422280	But still the same.
1423160	1425720	My fingers aren't really icy in the morning, too.
1425720	1427320	I feel when it's three a.m.
1427320	1429880	and your G.F. wants to snuggle and she's freezing cold.
1430760	1439320	No, I'm not lucky enough that this will kill her.
1444360	1447400	Typically takes you people weeks just to decide to take her if I may.
1449640	1455480	But the hand of we shall have to send it home with you so it can be treated with the proper respect.
1457720	1459160	Only five minute walk.
1459160	1460040	She'll be fine.
1460040	1463240	Did he just chew him out of his table to people?
1463240	1463740	Yep.
1464520	1466520	It does certainly look that way.
1467160	1467960	Very impressive.
1468520	1471160	And he didn't even get the answer that he wanted in return.
1471160	1474840	Yeah, no, that was a very shrewd act of jury.
1481400	1484680	I still have a feeling they're going to do the Balrog like 1000 years there.
1484680	1485400	They're going to do it.
1487400	1488760	It's probably more in light.
1489640	1491000	It had wings in that shot.
1492680	1493640	Very controversial.
1494120	1499000	Keeping your promise to his people and ensuring the doom of your own.
1499000	1503400	Well, I guess we're just going to have to have a race war, aren't we?
1505400	1505900	Jesus.
1506520	1507800	Peace was never an option.
1509880	1515080	The light of the Eldar, our light is fading.
1515960	1518760	Did the dwarves find the orb or not?
1523720	1526680	I swore an oath to Durin.
1529640	1530140	To some.
1531560	1533560	That may now hold little weight.
1533560	1535400	I mean, that answer basically is yes.
1536680	1537180	Yeah.
1547240	1548680	That guy's definitely going to die.
1549960	1551800	He's got a nice death leg right there.
1551800	1552520	Oh, yeah, that's right.
1552520	1554360	Those are all of his friends that he fucked over.
1555160	1558840	You're only apologizing because you think now that I've been promoted.
1559160	1560680	I can get you on the expedition.
1564360	1564840	I would.
1564840	1565400	I would.
1565400	1565960	I would never.
1565960	1578680	But yes, he's committing sabotage.
1578680	1579400	How could he?
1580440	1582920	Don't you have more pressing things to worry about right now?
1586680	1587720	Start drinking it, guys.
1588680	1590040	Oh, wait, no, that's that's not alcohol.
1592040	1592840	Hand me the lantern.
1593960	1594460	Don't.
1597480	1598920	Yeah, yeah, make things worse.
1601560	1602520	Yeah, see, good job.
1603800	1605800	Good job, Isolde, you plot fuck.
1606440	1607000	Good job.
1611560	1614920	That's not quite how it works, but never mind.
1615800	1618440	It's an ammo detonation or to black powder.
1621400	1622440	Where did that one come from?
1623800	1625480	secondary explosions.
1625480	1629960	You know, that's how explosions work on another ship.
1631000	1631880	No, no, I'm the same.
1633160	1633960	That was the second ship.
1639720	1642760	Why are you lying for him?
1643080	1645560	This is how he gets on the expedition.
1645560	1647080	He's going to be a hero for saving him.
1648280	1650040	And all it took was sinking their fleet.
1650840	1653960	I mean, wouldn't it be a hero for cashing the saboteur?
1654600	1655800	Yeah, two ships.
1655800	1656300	Yeah.
1656920	1659480	So I guess the first ship exploded so hard.
1659480	1661480	The second one just went like, I want to do that, too.
1662040	1662540	Yep.
1664200	1667160	They remember Blackwater from Game of Thrones.
1667160	1667960	We can do that, too.
1673080	1677960	Enough to saturate every last elf in the light of the valor once more.
1680840	1681400	And yes.
1683720	1684220	Yes.
1685240	1687560	I don't think this is how Mithril works.
1688200	1693000	Yeah, see, what I remember is that the elves made the rings
1693000	1696680	to keep themselves from dying and their civilization from decaying.
1697320	1699640	But Mithril wasn't part of that story, as far as I can remember.
1699640	1701320	That the High King deceived me.
1701320	1703400	I'm pretty sure this is all bullshit.
1703960	1705720	Why do you keep fighting?
1705720	1707000	Because I cannot stop.
1707560	1713160	I believe they could no longer distinguish me from the evil I was fighting.
1718200	1719560	You know, that's not a bad twist.
1719560	1720200	I'm sorry.
1720200	1721800	She is a war crazy maniac.
1723080	1723580	Yeah.
1725400	1729480	The thing is, she's a very interesting character.
1730120	1734360	She's just not Galadriel, because this is actually a pretty great scene.
1736040	1738600	I know what a hammer and tongs is yours.
1738600	1739640	If she wasn't, yeah.
1740200	1740700	Yeah.
1741240	1745400	Even then, though, like, her entire reasoning is based on I can't stop fighting.
1746360	1746860	Okay.
1750920	1752680	I don't mind that works, though.
1752680	1753640	I'm a psychologist.
1754280	1757240	Yeah, I don't mind the whole PTSD haunted.
1757640	1761400	Can't give up because, you know, she doesn't have PTSD.
1761400	1763320	She'd never fought in the fucking war.
1763320	1763820	Fair enough.
1766520	1769640	You know, the story of someone who's just consumed by violence.
1771000	1773080	The problem is she hasn't committed any violence.
1775480	1776200	That's also true.
1776760	1778280	They only have half the story here.
1778280	1783160	And plus, the linchpin is that this kind of character can't be Galadriel.
1783160	1785480	This is the kind of character who, like,
1785480	1788120	would have killed someone and then regretted it or something.
1791080	1791720	It would have worked.
1794600	1796440	They forgot about the other half of the story.
1797160	1797660	Yeah.
1801400	1802120	Didn't like that.
1805000	1805500	No.
1808360	1810040	He's a fucking elf, you moron.
1810680	1811800	He chose poorly.
1813160	1826840	All of his wounds have closed up, too.
1826840	1828360	It's that magic human loving.
1828360	1830040	There's something you don't know.
1831240	1832280	I've seen this before.
1833400	1840600	It is a key conjured by some forgotten craft of the enemy to enslave your ancestors.
1840600	1841240	Black device.
1841800	1843560	You appear to be mildly outnumbered.
1844280	1847080	You know, I didn't see the sword hilt being a key.
1847800	1849080	I didn't call that one.
1849080	1850520	This is like Helm's Deep Light.
1853640	1855000	They didn't have the budget, okay?
1855960	1856460	Okay.
1858200	1859640	Store brand Helms Deep.
1861560	1863560	Walmart, you know, it's not very.
1863560	1864360	Oh, my God.
1864360	1866680	They brought the fucking tablet.
1866680	1868360	Wait, they're just carrying it back?
1869000	1870760	I think elves have horses, though.
1879320	1880280	All right, that's pretty good.
1885000	1887800	Give it to me raw.
1893400	1896920	That was a sudden fucking timeline, but okay.
1897480	1897980	Yeah.
1898680	1902600	Do you mean spring and a thousand years or a few months?
1906840	1909160	This is not how Mithra fucking works.
1909160	1912360	See, I'm assuming this is a way to make the whole dug too deep,
1912440	1917800	greedily into less of just a, you know, drew move and more of a move out of necessity.
1919880	1921480	But this isn't how Mithra works.
1921480	1924360	Where elven race as in my hands.
1925160	1925800	Whose hands?
1929080	1929580	Yours.
1940920	1943480	I do like that he actually went clean with them, though.
1943480	1945320	Didn't do anything shenanigans.
1945320	1947400	Yeah, I like the solution a lot better.
1948120	1950200	Better than the George R. R. Martin show.
1951000	1952600	He bought that awfully quick.
1952600	1955960	Then again, has been honest with him.
1955960	1956760	Hold on a second.
1956760	1958360	It's not a long journey back.
1958360	1959320	It's five minutes.
1960840	1962840	This is, you know, a screen transition.
1964840	1967000	Have we seen a horse in this show?
1967000	1971240	Incidentally, just I want to say yes.
1973240	1974840	A few times.
1974840	1979000	I think only a numinar, though, because I don't think the garrison had any horses.
1979960	1984360	Because of their cow, that fucking enormous slab of stone back.
1984920	1988200	Yeah, we saw a cow and it had all the black milk.
1989640	1990600	Oh, don't remind me.
1990600	1991560	That's gross.
1991560	1993160	That's like bad chocolate milk.
2001880	2004360	Maybe the show run is just really don't like horses.
2004360	2008360	Horses are expensive.
2008360	2009400	Somebody just stole it.
2010200	2011320	That's a trend.
2011320	2012520	He turned back to get it.
2013800	2016520	Attagon has decided that he wants to be king after all.
2017480	2020200	It's a thin line of like fucking soldiers.
2020200	2020840	Oh, my God.
2022120	2027640	I'm like Hawkeye right now on the lookout for that T-shirt with the printed armor pattern.
2030680	2032200	I want to see if we can catch it in the wild.
2034600	2035320	Face looks done.
2036520	2037560	I thought I'd point that out.
2040600	2042760	Listen, Kibs, I think she's a cutie.
2042760	2043320	I'd simp.
2045320	2046440	You disgust me, Death.
2047320	2047960	How could you?
2050120	2051640	I'd sub to her OnlyFans.
2053400	2056040	Wow, you've got that kind of free spending money.
2057560	2059000	I think they're wearing the shirt now.
2059000	2060840	Maybe take a close look at those dudes.
2060920	2064280	They are in the armpit in the armpit.
2064280	2064920	Oh, my God.
2064920	2065640	They actually have it.
2066520	2068440	Where did she get that from?
2070440	2074120	Where did she get that from?
2075480	2077000	She got it from the promotional department.
2078280	2081880	She swam here, and I'm pretty sure she didn't bring that.
2081880	2082440	She didn't.
2083160	2083800	Where was it?
2084360	2085800	I guess they just made it for her.
2086040	2086680	Where was it?
2087480	2088680	I guess they just made it for her.
2088680	2095880	Maybe they just made it like the same armor and everything.
2095880	2097960	Yeah, no, that is the exact same armor.
2100440	2101000	That's right.
2101000	2103960	Because she wore that suit before at the start of the show,
2105000	2107080	but she left it behind when she got on the boat.
2108040	2110280	So they just made her identical armor,
2110280	2111640	and she just described it to them.
2111640	2115640	I guess it's very stupid that I want you to know that.
2117800	2121560	Did the show just forget that she swam here?
2121560	2122920	I mean, Arch, I wish I could.
2123720	2127800	So I need mastercrafted elven armor with intricate patterning,
2127800	2129560	and I need it like next week.
2130520	2132200	All right, come right up, boss.
2132200	2133320	We made a styrofoam.
2133880	2135320	I'm paying you an explosion.
2140360	2142040	I really hate those sales, by the way.
2144280	2147640	Listen, Arch, they catch wind, except the wind that goes in between them.
2148600	2150840	Except for the wind that goes in between there.
2150840	2155240	That's caught by the front sail, which catches the future wind.
2156040	2156520	Singing.
2157720	2158520	No, it's fine.
2158520	2159400	We don't need singing.
2160120	2161320	No, we don't need it.
2161320	2162200	We don't need it, Kyle.
2163400	2163960	Don't you want it?
2164920	2169720	That was an episode of a TV show, if nothing else.
2169720	2172840	I'm still not particularly involved, honestly.
2172840	2174120	Wait a second, Kibbs.
2175320	2176440	Kibbs, turn it off.
2176440	2177320	What was that?
2177320	2178280	Enormous fuck up.
2181080	2181880	Jesus.
2181880	2182440	All right.
2183640	2188280	OK, so I think I've finally discovered my major issue with this show
2188280	2189480	after watching this episode.
2189480	2192760	OK, I formulated my dev thesis.
2192760	2193960	Oh, here we go.
2193960	2196840	Everything happening in this show is a mystery box.
2196840	2200600	It's all mystery box writing and mystery boxes that have become
2200600	2205400	they've like steadily gained in popularity since since lost back in the 2000s.
2205400	2206040	Right.
2206040	2208200	People love their mystery box writing.
2208200	2210680	The problem with a mystery box in a prequel, though,
2211240	2212760	is that we know where it's going to go.
2214280	2216920	You know, like, what's the ore going to be?
2216920	2218120	Oh, it's going to be mithril.
2218120	2219160	What are the rings going to do?
2219160	2222600	Oh, we know all this stuff already because we know where it goes.
2222680	2225880	So they have to either change the lore, which is no good,
2226440	2229400	or they have to introduce mystery boxes
2229960	2233080	that don't really have any consequence to the wider story.
2233080	2239400	The idea that mithril is solid light that can reinvigorate the elves
2240440	2244920	does have enormous significance for the wider story.
2245480	2249160	In fact, it has ridiculous significance for the wider story.
2249160	2251240	Yeah, and that's the changing the lore part.
2251240	2251740	Yeah.
2252140	2253020	And see, that's the problem.
2253020	2257260	I fucking hate mystery boxes because I view them as lazy ass goddamn writing.
2257260	2258220	It's simply just.
2258220	2263580	And then this magical thing appeared because it has no sense or reason.
2263580	2266540	OK, so the the people were enslaved by a sword.
2266540	2269500	No, that's that's not how this fucking functions.
2269500	2272700	The sword of Sauron does not have the power to enslave a people.
2272700	2274940	So they just have to make that shit up and go like,
2274940	2276940	there's a mural over there with a sword on it.
2276940	2278460	That's why it's a key.
2278460	2280540	You're pulling this out of your ass.
2280540	2282540	Yeah, it's kind of like there's a key.
2282540	2285100	It's like, OK, do we know it's a key?
2285100	2288140	Like, have you what evidence do you have suggestions like,
2288140	2291340	well, you see, I knew about this mural here from 200 years ago.
2291340	2296460	It's like, OK, I think that the show is like very safe in a lot of ways.
2297340	2299820	Like with other shows, there are these moments where like,
2299820	2302140	oh, my God, that's like crazy.
2302140	2306300	And it really like I don't know, there's great moments of awe.
2306300	2309900	I feel like this show is like scared to really give those to you.
2310620	2311740	Yeah, aside from the CG.
2313500	2315420	Yeah, just like the everyday CG.
2315420	2320460	I think they might be trapped in the confines of it being a sequel.
2320460	2323820	So there's so much they can do a prequel.
2323820	2324940	Yeah, yeah.
2324940	2327180	There's only so much they can do with that.
2327180	2330540	But they have so much lore they could have done something with.
2330540	2333100	And instead, they're just there's not doing it.
2333100	2337420	They could have written the story that Tolkien wrote.
2337420	2338540	They're not interested in that.
2338540	2341580	They are interested in actively fucking it because they're
2341580	2343340	interested in actively claiming it.
2343340	2345580	This is to be Amazon's Lord of the Rings.
2346220	2348060	That's why they are looking at me.
2348060	2351580	So now I'm going like, oh, yeah, this is a magic metal that the elves need.
2351580	2353340	Oh, it isn't the writers.
2353340	2356380	The new writing team is trying to make this their own project.
2356380	2360700	And I understand why, because they're trying to adapt it, but into their workflow.
2360700	2366540	But the issue is you got to have a better understanding of what Tolkien's vision was.
2367180	2369340	And instead of making your vision,
2369340	2371980	you should instead being trying to follow in his footsteps
2372540	2375500	to try to complete what he was going for to begin with.
2375500	2378140	Well, they did directly say that this is this is
2379100	2382060	they're like breaking free out from Tolkien's shadow.
2382060	2384940	And this is this is the Lord of the Rings that Tolkien never wrote.
2384940	2388060	And they said a lot of that stuff and the lead up to the show.
2388060	2394060	So they were really they were really setting the stage for them saying, yeah, fuck lore.
2394060	2397100	Which is very disrespectful to the the fans.
2397100	2399020	It's disrespectful to the source material.
2399020	2401420	It's disrespectful to the the author.
2401420	2405660	You shouldn't you shouldn't try to dismiss the author that came before you.
2405660	2407260	The guy who built all of this.
2407260	2410060	Instead, you should honor that work and should do your best
2410060	2413260	to try to pay homage to his vision.
2413260	2417500	And well, it's also the fucking hubris of it.
2417500	2419900	Like these are people that go like, no, no, we can do way better.
2419900	2422940	Like, I'm sorry, but this is no goddamn Lord of the Rings.
2422940	2424060	This is not even close.
2424060	2429820	Like, if I'm being generous now, I might lift the show to like a five or a six.
2429820	2431500	And they're like, oh, we know better.
2432060	2434620	Yeah, out of ten out of 100.
2434620	2437900	Lore complaints aside, how would the show in a vacuum?
2438700	2439660	What are you all thinking?
2440540	2441740	Oh, that's the best.
2442860	2443900	Pretty average.
2443900	2444860	Impressive scene.
2444860	2445900	All right.
2445900	2447340	For a random show.
2448140	2449420	Yeah, it is there.
2449420	2449900	They're right.
2449900	2451580	I feel like it's got them first.
2452460	2455420	Well, it just feels like it's always on like the precipice
2455420	2457900	of like something really interesting happening.
2457900	2460460	Where like you get these scenes with Galadriel and you're like,
2460460	2463260	oh, like maybe her character is going to go in this direction.
2463260	2465100	And that would be really interesting.
2465100	2467740	Or it just happens with like every character.
2467740	2473340	And it is kind of like the mystery box thing where it's hard to judge it
2473340	2476940	because it's kind of promising a lot.
2476940	2479660	It's like, listen, guys, it's going to get really good.
2479660	2481500	It's kind of what the show is constantly saying.
2482300	2485420	And if it delivers on that, that's cool.
2485420	2487580	And then you can just say, well, it was a bit slow.
2487580	2492620	But if it doesn't deliver on it, then that'll make all the previous moments
2492620	2494380	feel a lot more cheap.
2494380	2496220	It hasn't delivered yet, I don't think.
2496780	2501260	No, it's writing with a presumed presumption.
2501260	2504860	Like they've made up a story and now they're working their way towards it.
2504860	2509020	Now suddenly Galadriel is like, oh, no, I just have to fight
2509020	2510140	because okay, why do you have to fight?
2510140	2511020	Well, I don't know about that.
2511020	2514860	But this is my reason, you see, I'm becoming evil and I see it now.
2514860	2517020	You haven't presented this previously.
2517020	2519420	This at no point earlier, was there any indication
2519420	2522700	that Galadriel was doing this for any sort of outside force?
2522700	2527180	Like the only reasonable rationale appeared to be vengeance for her brother
2527180	2528780	because that's all where it started.
2528780	2531260	She didn't fight in the war against Morgoth.
2531260	2532780	She hasn't seen action.
2532780	2535340	And this is like, I'm an expert in fighting orcs.
2535340	2537180	You probably haven't even seen one.
2538140	2540300	She hasn't deserved any of this.
2540300	2543020	And now she has a scene, which is a decent scene,
2543020	2544780	but it's not for her character.
2544780	2546220	It's for another character.
2546220	2551900	But I mean, I think it is like, okay, if she's just like delusional a little bit, right?
2551900	2558540	Like, no, just like someone who's like young and like, I mean in elf years,
2558540	2563100	but like relatively young and wants to prove themselves and believes
2563100	2565340	that they can do all of these things,
2565340	2568540	but ultimately is going to kind of be disillusioned
2568540	2573180	and then has to move through that disillusionment to like fulfill their character arc.
2573180	2575420	I think that that's like an interesting character arc.
2575420	2577660	That's definitely an archetype that can be good.
2579180	2581900	Issue is one, she's one of the oldest elves alive
2582460	2585420	and two, she's not going to be moving through anything.
2585420	2587820	She is like right now though.
2589020	2590460	She is one of the oldest elves alive.
2591580	2592080	Damn.
2592940	2594140	Yeah, that's what I mean.
2594140	2596060	This is the wrong character to do that story with.
2596780	2598300	And she is not going to move through it.
2598300	2599900	She cannot be allowed to fail.
2599900	2605340	Like she takes on like what, six, seven people and humiliates them utterly.
2605340	2608380	And the best one manages to do is scratch her clothing,
2608380	2610300	which doesn't even fulfill the actual.
2610300	2612540	She is an elf in fairness.
2612540	2613900	And they're all humans.
2613900	2614380	That's true.
2614380	2615100	Yeah, but that's the thing.
2615100	2616460	Elves aren't that fucking good.
2616460	2617580	That's that's the thing too.
2618220	2620220	Hold on, Arch, hold on.
2620220	2621420	I'm going to disagree with you here,
2621420	2624940	because Legolas did surf on a shield down a staircase.
2624940	2627900	Okay, no, elves are like supernaturally talented.
2627900	2631900	And also she has like hundreds of years of experience on these people.
2631900	2632860	No, she doesn't.
2632860	2633740	She does not.
2633740	2638220	She's been fighting a war for a couple of years, tops.
2638220	2641580	Yeah, but she's had lots of time to train and practice.
2641580	2642300	She hasn't.
2642300	2643260	She's collateral.
2643260	2644540	She hasn't trained.
2644540	2647500	She's never picked up a sword before her brother died.
2647500	2650140	That's like explicitly like she's never trained.
2650860	2652860	Yes, because there wasn't a war.
2652860	2656860	Like the concept of war didn't exist until Morgoth appeared.
2656860	2658140	Yep, that's true.
2658140	2660620	Yeah, the whole thing about Galadriel is she's not a warrior.
2660620	2663340	And the story, she's actually a sorcerer.
2663340	2664300	Yeah, she was a sorceress.
2664300	2667020	Yeah, she was supposed to be like a backline kind of person.
2667020	2669420	So it's very weird that she's taking this front line.
2669420	2670780	Because Galadriel is clever.
2670780	2672220	She's very powerful.
2672220	2674380	In fact, very powerful.
2674380	2677900	She's one of the most powerful characters on the side of good.
2677980	2682220	I guess you could say in terms of her actual magical capabilities.
2682220	2685660	But she's always reserved because she's more of a tactician.
2685660	2689260	She's always thinking ahead about the general positioning of things.
2689260	2690700	She's never directly involved.
2691260	2695180	And that's kind of the problem with the show is they've kind of butchered her character.
2695180	2699100	Her brilliance is diminished and her intellect is diminished.
2699100	2702940	Because instead of her intellect being her strength, it's not even her strength.
2702940	2704460	She's kind of an idiot.
2704460	2706220	She feels I could see that.
2706220	2707260	She's kind of a warrior.
2707500	2709820	They've taken away her brilliance.
2709820	2711580	And that's the part that bothers me.
2712300	2715900	Because she's supposed to be very, very smart.
2715900	2717660	She's supposed to see the broader picture.
2718460	2720540	And she kind of did in the beginning.
2720540	2722380	She understood Sauron was still around.
2722380	2724540	But they didn't really, they should have focused on that.
2724540	2726860	Like, okay, like, all right, how do you understand that?
2726860	2731420	Like, show us how you put those pieces of the puzzle together so that you came up with it.
2731420	2733260	Like, no, no, Sauron's still a threat.
2733260	2734300	And here's why.
2734300	2736620	Here's all these really, like, well thought out reasons.
2736620	2737820	All these clues and evidence.
2737820	2740220	But she saw it at emblem, Kibbs.
2740220	2742460	Yeah, and they, I know, but they do it.
2742460	2746780	They just do it like, oh, she found it in an archive and she finally now got the proof.
2746780	2748700	It's like, that's not very Galadriel.
2748700	2752060	Galadriel's like, she's supposed to be smarter than this.
2752060	2752460	I don't know.
2752460	2754140	It feels like a disservice to the character.
2754140	2756700	Her, too, get back to the point about the fighting skills.
2756700	2761420	Even Legolas, who was an exceptional fighter by even elven standards.
2762220	2766860	He only takes on a couple of enemies at once and kills them quickly.
2766860	2769980	Like, at no point is Legolas under attack by, like, six,
2769980	2773900	seven orcs and carrying out a lengthy duel against them whilst not killing them.
2774620	2775100	I don't know.
2775100	2777500	I feel like this is not the most unbelievable thing.
2777500	2781260	Like, these are, like, not super trained recruits that are just like kids.
2781260	2784220	Yeah, well, two of those people were sea guard trainees.
2784220	2787740	They were the ones who were kicked out of the sea guard after Isildur did these things.
2787740	2789660	They are trained fighters.
2789660	2790300	That's true.
2790380	2791580	There's at least two of them that are.
2791580	2795180	I know that they recruited a lot of raw guys, though.
2795180	2802700	And plus, the boss man said that they had more recruits than they had spaces.
2802700	2804300	These aren't randos from the street.
2804300	2805900	He has the pick of the crop.
2805900	2806460	I don't know.
2806460	2810460	I mean, like, I feel like these guys have not really seen war either, though.
2810460	2815580	Like, most of their training is gonna be just, you know, practice.
2816140	2821260	I think the implication is that they're inexperienced and they haven't seen proper.
2821260	2822060	Right.
2822060	2824780	That's like my reading of their characters.
2824780	2827100	I think that's what that's what they're trying to do,
2827660	2832380	but I'm not sure if they necessarily got that across, but I kind of see it.
2832380	2833100	Yeah.
2833100	2836540	Okay, that'll do it for this week.
2836540	2838220	Thanks for being here, everyone.
2838220	2839660	Welcome aboard, Taftash.
2839660	2840540	Thanks, Dev.
2840540	2842300	Hey, just a curiosity.
2842300	2846620	If we do continue to do this stuff, what show do we do next after this one's over?
2847340	2848940	You guys want to do She-Hulk?
2848940	2849340	No.
2849340	2851020	I don't mind doing She-Hulk.
2851020	2852780	It seems cringy enough.
2854060	2855580	God, you guys are masochists.
2856380	2856940	I don't know.
2858940	2861100	We'll watch the vine boom twerk.
2862220	2864220	How much cancer do you want to contract?
2864220	2865900	I'll catch them all, I guess.
