00:00.000 --> 00:09.840
So, for today's episode, halfway through watching the first season, Taftaj has hitched her her

00:09.840 --> 00:12.040
cart to our ride. Welcome aboard.

00:12.040 --> 00:13.680
It's true. Thanks, Deb.

00:13.680 --> 00:14.680
So welcome aboard.

00:14.680 --> 00:15.680
Taftaj.

00:15.680 --> 00:19.880
Taftaj is a friend of mine from a different sector of the internet, and I figured we could

00:19.880 --> 00:25.300
make the worlds collide. We'll see if we can bring you into like the arched Sargon sphere.

00:25.300 --> 00:27.300
You can say hello to some people.

00:27.300 --> 00:31.740
But the plan to infiltrate it begins.

00:31.740 --> 00:37.700
So we are indeed halfway through the season, and you caught up to do this with us, right?

00:37.700 --> 00:38.780
I did.

00:38.780 --> 00:42.580
And how do you how do you feel about the first four episodes?

00:42.580 --> 00:46.700
I'll be controversial and say that I didn't think they were that bad. I thought they were

00:46.700 --> 00:51.720
they were very pretty. I'm not enough of a Lord of the Rings nerd to like notice every

00:51.720 --> 00:56.860
detail and be like, um, actually, this is not correct. I've been enjoying it. I think

00:56.860 --> 01:01.460
the pacing is a little bit slow, but it helps when you watch it on two times speed.

01:01.460 --> 01:06.140
So wait, you've been watching it on two times speed?

01:06.140 --> 01:07.620
I had to catch up somehow.

01:07.620 --> 01:14.540
I mean, each episode is an hour long. I'll grant her that.

01:14.540 --> 01:19.820
And after having watched it at 1x speed, I think, if anything, she's far smarter than

01:19.820 --> 01:20.820
us.

01:20.820 --> 01:24.460
Yeah, maybe it is more enjoyable on two times speed. Who knows?

01:24.460 --> 01:30.100
I glance over I'm like, Oh, thank God, we're getting past the cringy parts and we're getting

01:30.100 --> 01:33.500
straight to the pretty scene. And that's all good.

01:33.500 --> 01:37.780
And you know, to be fair to the show, it does have some pretty good CG.

01:37.780 --> 01:39.720
It does. It looks very expensive.

01:39.720 --> 01:43.300
If you knew absolutely nothing about Lord of the Rings, and you just thought this was

01:43.300 --> 01:47.300
some kind of Game of Thrones ish show, it might seem okay, but

01:47.300 --> 01:50.340
What is your biggest critique of it so far?

01:50.340 --> 01:54.660
Is that it's not Lord of the Rings, because Lord of the Rings has a specific style of

01:54.660 --> 01:59.300
storytelling has a very specific world. And it's just none of those things, at least in

01:59.300 --> 02:00.580
my opinion, what do you guys think?

02:00.580 --> 02:05.620
I kind of feel like it's missing that Tolkien vibe. Because if it was a Tolkien story, everybody

02:05.620 --> 02:10.420
be smoking the pipe. They always smoke pipes.

02:10.420 --> 02:13.620
The man more pipe smoking. That's what it means.

02:13.620 --> 02:18.340
Just hook it up. Everybody. This sorrow old guy should just like spend the show smoking

02:18.340 --> 02:21.340
with the harpets.

02:21.340 --> 02:23.500
Smoking the fireflies.

02:23.500 --> 02:29.980
My biggest complaint is that it is aggressively not a Tolkien show, like they go out of their

02:29.980 --> 02:33.180
way to de-talkinify it.

02:33.180 --> 02:38.980
Disa is a perfect example of this because Disa is actually a quite good character, which

02:38.980 --> 02:44.020
is acted out in a fairly good way. And if it was just that she was black, I'd be like

02:44.020 --> 02:50.260
2022. But no, they also had to shave her, which genuinely annoys me because like, okay,

02:50.260 --> 02:55.980
you had a good character, a good actress here. And then you just have to have a middle finger.

02:55.980 --> 03:00.420
Even in the Peter Jackson films, because I watched Return of the King today, actually,

03:00.420 --> 03:05.740
and one of the scenes where the the Gondorian and Rohirric army are marching towards the

03:05.740 --> 03:09.540
Black Gate. There's actually a Black Gondorian in the background, but it doesn't bother me

03:09.540 --> 03:13.540
in the slightest because, well, it's not done in such a way to be like, oh, we're being

03:13.540 --> 03:18.580
different. We're doing it to modernize the story. It's like, no, they just needed an

03:18.580 --> 03:23.060
extra actor and, you know, he fit the shoes. So good for him.

03:23.060 --> 03:28.020
At the risk of sounding like, I don't know, a little bit racist. I think that the good

03:28.020 --> 03:33.780
thing about the characters that are black in this show is that it doesn't feel like

03:33.780 --> 03:38.100
they're drawing great attention to the fact that they're black. Like, I feel like these

03:38.100 --> 03:43.060
characters are like just characters that happen to be black. And, you know, any sort

03:43.060 --> 03:49.540
of like cultural associations to real world races seem like they're not really there.

03:49.540 --> 03:55.060
So I think that like when I watch these characters, like I can just see them as dwarves and elves

03:55.060 --> 03:59.340
with the only thing and like at the risk of retreading ground that we've already gone

03:59.340 --> 04:04.580
over being like some aesthetic stuff. Like, I agree. It's a little bit weird to see like

04:04.660 --> 04:10.020
very dwarfy characters and she like has barely any beard. I think that like does throw me off

04:10.020 --> 04:16.260
a little bit. But besides that, I think that the skin colors of the characters have been

04:16.260 --> 04:21.060
less jarring than I expected them to be. I will say this. The show is not actually

04:21.060 --> 04:24.580
particularly woke in the traditional sense of the word.

04:24.580 --> 04:29.220
I agree. It is. It is just in the casting choice and the fact that they seem to be making

04:30.180 --> 04:34.420
an effort to undermine Tolkien's work in minigames.

04:34.420 --> 04:39.220
Like, imagine if they played into like strong independent black woman stereotypes or something.

04:39.940 --> 04:41.460
That would be like unbearable.

04:41.460 --> 04:47.220
Imagine if they had contemporary allusions to like modern politics.

04:47.220 --> 04:48.100
Exactly.

04:48.100 --> 04:52.660
Especially like modern racial politics. Imagine if they had this like this is like

04:52.660 --> 04:53.860
Which they haven't done yet.

04:54.500 --> 04:57.940
Or hey, this is dissentus or whatever.

04:58.740 --> 05:00.660
God, that would be awful.

05:00.660 --> 05:04.020
Well, hold on a second, Leith, because we actually missed it in the last episode.

05:04.020 --> 05:07.060
We were joking about something else and we actually let a line slip by

05:07.620 --> 05:14.820
where there's that one rioter who says that elven workers are coming to steal the trades of Numenor.

05:15.380 --> 05:16.020
That's true.

05:16.980 --> 05:18.420
They had that one scene.

05:18.420 --> 05:21.540
And then I DMed you. I was like based to deport the elves.

05:22.740 --> 05:26.660
Notice how the the black elf character, one thing that's weird about him,

05:26.660 --> 05:29.380
that's also kind of jarring, isn't necessarily the fact that he's black,

05:29.380 --> 05:32.420
but it's the fact that he's missing one of the core things that elves have.

05:32.980 --> 05:35.620
Sort of long, you know, beautiful flowing hair.

05:36.500 --> 05:37.380
Also personality.

05:37.380 --> 05:39.460
You're not sure of a few elves.

05:39.460 --> 05:43.620
Because they shouldn't have short hair and stuff like that.

05:43.620 --> 05:49.700
Because they're always described in the books as to have, you know, long, very beautiful flowing hair.

05:50.580 --> 05:56.420
Again, it's one of those middle fingers that they know this isn't how elves look,

05:56.420 --> 05:59.700
but they decide, OK, we got to fuck the communities out of my mind.

05:59.700 --> 06:03.220
I also don't like Adam Deere's actor at all.

06:03.220 --> 06:06.740
I think he's a plank of fucking wood who has precisely one facial expression.

06:06.740 --> 06:07.780
He hasn't either.

06:07.780 --> 06:12.500
They're not throwing him a bone or he's just not really taking the scenes by storm.

06:12.500 --> 06:15.140
Like the what's that one bad guy shows up?

06:15.140 --> 06:18.980
Remember, he stole that scene absolutely from under him.

06:18.980 --> 06:20.580
Is it Adar or Adal?

06:20.580 --> 06:20.980
Adar.

06:22.900 --> 06:24.180
He shows up too.

06:24.180 --> 06:26.180
That's great in terms of his acting.

06:26.820 --> 06:29.380
Diversity higher elf is an actual nectar.

06:29.380 --> 06:30.580
He's a fucking model.

06:31.300 --> 06:32.340
Oh, God.

06:32.340 --> 06:33.700
Is that why you suck so much?

06:34.260 --> 06:35.300
That's why you suck so much in the camera.

06:35.300 --> 06:39.780
Why would you give him like just have him play an extra, not be the front and center?

06:40.580 --> 06:41.460
He does give up.

06:42.020 --> 06:45.060
He does come across as a plank of wood for most of the movie.

06:45.700 --> 06:50.020
I totally see like the model thing because it does seem like he's kind of making faces.

06:50.980 --> 06:51.700
Blue steel.

06:52.260 --> 06:56.180
I need to make a face for the for the cover art of this poster.

06:56.420 --> 06:56.740
Okay.

06:59.220 --> 07:00.260
Oh, God.

07:00.260 --> 07:03.700
I think he's probably the worst character in the show.

07:03.700 --> 07:04.900
There's no character to him.

07:05.460 --> 07:11.060
Like Galadriel, even though she's not Galadriel from from the movies or the books, she at

07:11.060 --> 07:12.340
least has a character.

07:12.340 --> 07:13.620
She's she's angry.

07:13.620 --> 07:15.860
It sort of happens to him.

07:17.460 --> 07:24.420
He wanders around, he gets captured and then he becomes like the only survivor because

07:24.420 --> 07:25.780
he's special or lucky.

07:26.420 --> 07:27.780
Maybe he'll become a character.

07:27.780 --> 07:31.300
And he gets to meet, I don't know, he gets to meet a dar.

07:32.740 --> 07:35.540
He also gets to have some human pussy, some humusy.

07:36.260 --> 07:37.300
Humusy, yes.

07:37.300 --> 07:38.660
A hussy, if you will.

07:38.660 --> 07:43.540
I mentioned last week that I got a package from Amazon with the Lord of the Rings tape.

07:43.540 --> 07:49.940
Since uploading that video, I've been inundated with people posting me their images of Lord

07:49.940 --> 07:51.380
of the Rings packages.

07:51.380 --> 07:54.420
Apparently, everyone's getting this shit right now.

07:54.420 --> 07:56.980
There's Lord of the Rings tape on Amazon boxes.

07:56.980 --> 07:58.580
There's Lord of the Rings boxes.

07:59.140 --> 08:01.220
Like if you order something from Amazon, it's big enough.

08:01.220 --> 08:03.620
You just get it in a giant Lord of the Rings chest.

08:03.620 --> 08:06.660
They're really going all out with the advertisement here for this show.

08:06.660 --> 08:08.100
They really want people to watch this.

08:08.100 --> 08:09.620
I'm kind of curious to see if it has an impact.

08:09.620 --> 08:11.860
I got a Lord of the Rings wrapping with one of my packages.

08:11.860 --> 08:14.900
Not all of them were Lord of the Rings packages, mind you.

08:14.900 --> 08:15.300
Yeah.

08:15.300 --> 08:17.380
They want us to watch the show.

08:17.380 --> 08:18.980
I'm already watching it on Amazon.

08:18.980 --> 08:19.860
I mean, of sorts.

08:20.500 --> 08:21.220
Not paying for it.

08:22.500 --> 08:23.860
Thank you for your sacrifice, Gibbs.

08:24.100 --> 08:25.140
We appreciate it.

08:25.140 --> 08:29.780
I was informed that apparently in the States, you guys get this all the time.

08:29.780 --> 08:33.060
Like apparently, what was that one show called?

08:33.060 --> 08:34.500
The Wheel of Time did it.

08:34.500 --> 08:37.220
They had Wheel of Time advertisements in the packaging.

08:37.220 --> 08:38.820
But this is the first time it's happened in Canada.

08:38.820 --> 08:39.620
This is new to me.

08:39.620 --> 08:45.700
You've also been covering the review scandal and the views and reviews.

08:45.700 --> 08:48.260
I don't know, Taftage, if you heard about what's been going on.

08:48.260 --> 08:53.540
But there's been some evidence that Amazon is drastically inflating their view numbers.

08:53.860 --> 09:00.100
There's some evidence that Amazon is basically putting their finger on the scale of user

09:00.100 --> 09:03.140
reviews to make the show look a lot better than it actually is.

09:03.140 --> 09:06.100
I guess they just can't take the L on this one, you know.

09:06.100 --> 09:08.980
I've got one bit of news to have on that front.

09:08.980 --> 09:16.180
The reviews since the last time we did this dropped by 0.3 from their five star rating.

09:16.180 --> 09:19.060
So they are dipping down slowly.

09:19.060 --> 09:23.700
And the actual reviews that are coming out on mainstream reviews, news sites, you know,

09:23.700 --> 09:27.940
they're finally starting to say by episode four that it's just not a very good show.

09:28.580 --> 09:34.020
And you can see it on Forbes and you can see it on even Screen Rant, which is, you know,

09:34.020 --> 09:35.460
very ideologically inclined.

09:35.460 --> 09:38.340
Even they said that Gladriel at this point is just unlikable.

09:38.340 --> 09:41.620
Oh, how could they say that about such a strong and empowered woman?

09:42.980 --> 09:44.340
Are you just sexist?

09:44.980 --> 09:50.180
Speaking of that on The Guardian, The Rings of Power episode four, the queen stops being angry.

09:50.180 --> 09:54.900
People are just ripping even even the corpos are ripping into the show at this point.

09:54.900 --> 09:57.380
That's a very bad sign.

09:57.380 --> 09:57.940
Yeah.

09:57.940 --> 09:58.660
Yeah.

09:58.660 --> 10:03.460
So here's the most positive corporate review that I've found for the for episode four.

10:03.460 --> 10:03.860
OK.

10:03.860 --> 10:05.620
And this is on CBR dot com.

10:05.620 --> 10:09.140
The Rings of Power episode four expertly blends triumph and tragedy.

10:09.140 --> 10:13.860
The connections between the seemingly disparate plot threads are beginning to come together.

10:13.860 --> 10:18.980
And halfway through season one, The Rings of Power is putting its pieces into motion.

10:18.980 --> 10:20.900
Officially at the halfway to season one.

10:20.900 --> 10:21.540
Yes.

10:21.540 --> 10:22.100
Yes.

10:22.100 --> 10:27.700
The show is briskly moving into its grander story, no longer fixated on introducing new

10:27.700 --> 10:30.420
characters and plot lines officially at the halfway mark.

10:30.420 --> 10:34.500
The Rings of Power season one is ready to cut loose, and the back half of the season

10:34.500 --> 10:38.820
is poised to deliver the high fantasy goods as its story ramps into high gear.

10:40.020 --> 10:41.380
That's that's the praise.

10:41.380 --> 10:42.500
It'll get good guys.

10:42.500 --> 10:43.540
Trust us.

10:43.540 --> 10:44.180
Hold on.

10:44.180 --> 10:46.500
It sounds it's going to get better.

10:46.500 --> 10:47.300
It'll be fair.

10:47.300 --> 10:51.140
The recent episodes happened better than the first one.

10:51.140 --> 10:51.620
Yes.

10:51.620 --> 10:52.980
Yes, I completely agree.

10:52.980 --> 10:53.380
Yeah.

10:53.380 --> 10:56.420
The first two were just nothing like nothing existed.

10:56.420 --> 10:57.300
Nothing happened.

10:57.300 --> 11:00.260
It was just characters being characters.

11:00.260 --> 11:01.060
It was very slow.

11:02.100 --> 11:03.140
Yeah, I agree.

11:03.140 --> 11:06.740
So everyone has been saying about the show that it's a slow burn, guys, the slow burn.

11:06.740 --> 11:07.380
And fair enough.

11:07.380 --> 11:09.300
I've watched some slow burn shows.

11:09.300 --> 11:11.460
You know, I really like Star Trek, Deep Space Nine.

11:11.460 --> 11:12.980
That show is a slow fucking burn.

11:12.980 --> 11:13.300
That's good.

11:13.300 --> 11:15.780
That's like a two season slow burn on that show.

11:15.780 --> 11:16.020
OK.

11:16.100 --> 11:16.660
So I get it.

11:16.660 --> 11:19.780
I understand it builds into something at the end.

11:19.780 --> 11:20.900
That's the nice part.

11:20.900 --> 11:24.020
All of that was building towards a greater idea.

11:24.020 --> 11:24.340
Yes.

11:24.340 --> 11:26.020
That's why the payoff was so good.

11:26.020 --> 11:30.420
So if there's no payoff on this, it's going to be it's going to be really bad by the end of it.

11:30.420 --> 11:31.540
You know what I will say?

11:31.540 --> 11:33.860
So Star Wars and or just came out, right?

11:33.860 --> 11:35.780
And I decided to watch that show.

11:35.780 --> 11:39.140
They launched three episodes on their release day that came out last night.

11:39.140 --> 11:40.100
So I watched that.

11:40.100 --> 11:40.820
And you know what?

11:41.540 --> 11:44.820
It's not super amazing, but it's OK.

11:44.820 --> 11:46.740
And it actually is a real slow burn.

11:46.740 --> 11:50.420
I was pleasantly surprised that now it's got fuck all to do with Star Wars because I don't know,

11:50.420 --> 11:52.900
for some reason, Disney doesn't know what the fuck to do with this property.

11:52.900 --> 11:56.980
But it's like it's an OK show and they're actually doing a slow burn.

11:56.980 --> 11:58.660
Things do happen every scene.

11:58.660 --> 12:02.660
A story is progressing and they're just let there's chew in the fat a bit, you know,

12:02.660 --> 12:06.340
as compared to this show, which just did nothing for the first two hours.

12:06.340 --> 12:11.620
The guys who are making Andal, he he literally said that he couldn't care less about Star Wars.

12:11.620 --> 12:13.140
He wanted to make a spy thriller.

12:14.100 --> 12:15.060
And here's the thing.

12:16.740 --> 12:18.260
It's actually a good spy thriller.

12:18.260 --> 12:18.980
Like, it's not bad.

12:18.980 --> 12:22.180
I'm actually enjoying it, but it shouldn't even have Star Wars attached to it.

12:22.180 --> 12:26.660
You can just make this as like a random sci fi, whatever, and it would be fine.

12:26.660 --> 12:28.020
But they got to use Star Wars.

12:28.020 --> 12:28.740
I don't know.

12:28.740 --> 12:29.060
Huh?

12:29.060 --> 12:30.740
Just make new things.

12:30.740 --> 12:32.180
Just make new things, guys.

12:32.180 --> 12:32.500
Come on.

12:32.500 --> 12:33.380
It's OK.

12:33.380 --> 12:39.700
If you're going to make something that isn't the property, don't make something else.

12:39.700 --> 12:43.860
Simple as like, if I'm going to watch the Star Wars show, odds are I'm going to try

12:43.860 --> 12:45.220
and watch a Star Wars show.

12:45.220 --> 12:46.420
Yeah, I kind of agree.

12:46.420 --> 12:49.220
Like, I want to watch Star Wars as a Star Wars fan.

12:49.220 --> 12:51.780
I I kind of like to watch Star Wars.

12:53.780 --> 13:00.500
I know that's a novel concept, but you don't want to see a rom com set in a Star Wars universe.

13:00.500 --> 13:01.220
Not particularly.

13:01.220 --> 13:04.580
No, you don't want to see a cooking show.

13:05.620 --> 13:06.980
Oh, God, maybe.

13:06.980 --> 13:10.500
I mean, that might be banger.

13:13.380 --> 13:15.540
Well, they did that back in the holiday special.

13:15.540 --> 13:16.020
Remember that?

13:16.020 --> 13:17.060
Yeah, and that went well.

13:17.060 --> 13:18.500
That went really well, didn't it?

13:20.500 --> 13:20.900
God.

13:20.900 --> 13:23.220
And it used to be the worst piece of Star Wars media.

13:23.220 --> 13:24.500
So Taftash.

13:24.500 --> 13:24.820
Yes.

13:25.380 --> 13:29.940
This is the kind of nerds complaining about shit that you've signed up for.

13:29.940 --> 13:31.060
How do you feel about it?

13:32.260 --> 13:33.540
I feel good about it.

13:34.900 --> 13:35.860
Feels great.

13:35.860 --> 13:41.460
Even though I can't give insight on all of these properties, I'm I'm just happy to participate.

13:41.460 --> 13:43.860
There have been like very much in a similar boat.

13:43.860 --> 13:51.220
I'm not like a super like Laura rings nerd, but I like enjoying a shit show with the people.

13:51.780 --> 13:54.260
Yeah, exactly.

13:54.260 --> 13:59.460
And I am like half of a nerd so I can get some of it, you know, half normie.

13:59.460 --> 14:00.820
I think it's time, Kibbs.

14:01.460 --> 14:05.620
I think it's time for us to watch this on one time speed.

14:05.620 --> 14:06.420
Unfortunately.

14:07.300 --> 14:09.540
Sorry, it's gonna be slow.

14:09.540 --> 14:11.540
Ah, not a fucking commercial.

14:13.220 --> 14:14.420
I need to pay for Prime.

14:14.420 --> 14:17.060
Then they fucking have the audacity to show me commercials too.

14:18.260 --> 14:19.540
I need your oath.

14:19.540 --> 14:20.340
Oh my simp.

14:20.980 --> 14:22.580
Maybe you can simp harder, simp.

14:23.780 --> 14:25.860
That's not simping if I'm criticizing it.

14:26.740 --> 14:27.940
Please skip the recap.

14:29.060 --> 14:30.660
Are you sure you want to skip it?

14:31.140 --> 14:34.340
Yes, they're recapping barely anything.

14:36.500 --> 14:37.620
What about the intro?

14:37.620 --> 14:38.500
Skip, skip it.

14:38.500 --> 14:39.540
Skip all of it.

14:39.540 --> 14:40.580
Skip the episode, Kibbs.

14:40.580 --> 14:41.780
We'll just pretend we watched it.

14:42.820 --> 14:43.940
Look at the rocks, Deb.

14:45.940 --> 14:46.820
Look, more rocks.

14:49.860 --> 14:51.140
Oh, you broke it down.

14:53.220 --> 14:54.340
It's all those viewers.

14:54.340 --> 14:56.500
That's what that's what it's so laggy.

14:56.500 --> 14:59.700
Oh God, no, no, no.

15:00.900 --> 15:02.500
Yes, yes.

15:02.500 --> 15:04.020
We've gone too long without seeing them.

15:04.740 --> 15:06.420
Ah, fucking off, it's...

15:08.180 --> 15:09.620
I wish they would clean their hairs.

15:10.980 --> 15:11.700
No.

15:11.700 --> 15:13.460
He's totally getting a makeover later.

15:14.180 --> 15:16.420
So Mauler and I have a friendly bet

15:16.420 --> 15:19.860
of an unspecified sum of money on who this guy actually is.

15:20.580 --> 15:23.220
I say Sauron, he says Gandalf.

15:24.820 --> 15:28.260
I mean, if it's Gandalf, that defies the lore, but okay.

15:28.660 --> 15:32.340
I do think it's like a minor wizard like Gandalf, that's mine.

15:32.340 --> 15:33.620
One of the blue guys?

15:33.620 --> 15:34.900
Yeah, something like that.

15:36.980 --> 15:38.340
What the fuck is on your head?

15:40.500 --> 15:41.460
It's camouflage.

15:41.460 --> 15:42.340
This is fashion.

15:44.740 --> 15:46.260
Singing is very Tolkien.

15:47.140 --> 15:48.820
You guys could have gone around that.

15:48.820 --> 15:52.660
Like, they showed away just over there.

15:52.660 --> 15:54.180
Sure, it's like right next to it.

15:58.980 --> 16:01.140
This has gone on long enough.

16:01.140 --> 16:03.540
This is exactly what the books are like, though.

16:04.820 --> 16:07.140
But it's like she has another long song.

16:10.100 --> 16:11.940
I sang for three days straight.

16:13.540 --> 16:14.340
Wait, don't put that in.

16:15.300 --> 16:16.180
Don't put it in the movie.

16:16.180 --> 16:18.420
That is some high fucking quality iron work in right there.

16:18.980 --> 16:20.820
The entire rest is just a musical.

16:23.620 --> 16:25.780
Oh yeah, I can definitely see the good guy energy.

16:26.580 --> 16:27.080
Yeah.

16:27.880 --> 16:29.960
In that giant eye he left on the ground.

16:30.600 --> 16:32.760
Listen, the sun is a symbol of good.

16:32.760 --> 16:35.000
Mauler, I'm coming to collect, buddy.

16:35.000 --> 16:35.560
Uh oh.

16:35.560 --> 16:36.840
Meesa Malkor.

16:36.840 --> 16:37.960
Are we going to see Eminem?

16:39.480 --> 16:40.280
Yep.

16:40.280 --> 16:42.520
Oh good, they're dressed all in white too.

16:42.520 --> 16:45.480
White's the common color of evil.

16:45.480 --> 16:46.760
Is that a girl or a boy?

16:47.720 --> 16:49.560
I'm genuinely not sure.

16:49.560 --> 16:50.280
I think it's a girl.

16:50.280 --> 16:51.960
Well, it appears to have tits.

16:52.680 --> 16:54.680
Although that means anything these days, but still.

16:54.680 --> 17:00.200
The message of the show is that androgynous people are evil, by the way.

17:01.880 --> 17:04.680
That was like an old demonic trope, wasn't it?

17:04.680 --> 17:06.600
Like demons have both genitals and stuff?

17:07.720 --> 17:08.360
Slimash.

17:09.000 --> 17:11.560
Oh look, the orcs are out in the sun again and don't really care.

17:12.440 --> 17:14.040
Well, he seems to be under a hood.

17:14.040 --> 17:15.720
He looks very uncomfortable.

17:15.720 --> 17:17.000
He's wearing his hijab.

17:22.200 --> 17:23.960
Global warming will block out the sun.

17:25.240 --> 17:29.320
Global warming is actually good because it hurts orcs.

17:29.880 --> 17:31.960
You need SPF 50, at least.

17:33.160 --> 17:34.760
Ah, we're gonna have a speech.

17:34.760 --> 17:35.160
Good.

17:35.160 --> 17:36.680
Wait, how did he get his armor back?

17:36.680 --> 17:37.720
He lost it in the hole.

17:39.080 --> 17:40.680
Details, details dev.

17:47.000 --> 17:48.600
Excuse me, who put you in charge?

17:50.920 --> 17:52.920
The scriptwriter, actually.

17:52.920 --> 17:56.120
She's the only notable woman in this plotline, so she's in charge.

17:57.880 --> 18:00.280
Oh, he's the guy that was corrupted by the sword, right?

18:03.720 --> 18:05.480
Yes, follow the crack addict.

18:06.520 --> 18:08.360
With a random guy over his mother.

18:12.120 --> 18:13.240
I'm enjoying this, actually.

18:14.200 --> 18:16.680
Maybe they can do a real hero's journey with this guy.

18:16.680 --> 18:18.280
Now we just gotta find his Obi-Wan.

18:18.280 --> 18:22.600
Come with me, forgive me for not sending words to you sooner.

18:22.600 --> 18:27.000
Whenever I keep seeing that guy's name, I always think Phazon from Metroid.

18:27.000 --> 18:29.560
When I speak, his ears close up.

18:31.800 --> 18:32.520
It's conditioned.

18:37.560 --> 18:38.920
We skipped ahead a few months.

18:39.880 --> 18:41.400
Yeah, how did he get into prison?

18:42.040 --> 18:42.760
What happened here?

18:44.200 --> 18:47.720
Listen, he's been accepted into the trades guild now, okay?

18:48.360 --> 18:49.240
When did this happen?

18:52.200 --> 18:53.560
Yeah, he's asking questions again.

18:53.560 --> 18:54.120
Make him stop.

18:55.000 --> 18:57.000
I'm just except for the plot that's moving forward.

18:57.720 --> 19:01.160
I'm certain your fellowship will prove just as invaluable once you make landfall.

19:02.760 --> 19:04.840
Don't you dare say the word fellowship.

19:04.840 --> 19:08.680
And 500 men to aid your people and place a crown on your head.

19:08.680 --> 19:09.480
Five hundred?

19:10.280 --> 19:10.760
That's it?

19:10.760 --> 19:11.260
Wow.

19:14.440 --> 19:15.720
Find another head to crown.

19:17.720 --> 19:22.200
Wait, was that his guild crest?

19:22.200 --> 19:24.760
No, I think that was his fancy little.

19:24.760 --> 19:25.400
Okay, yeah.

19:26.120 --> 19:29.400
It was like kind of mixing up in the symbolism there, but okay, yeah.

19:34.520 --> 19:36.360
Guys, get some horses or something.

19:36.360 --> 19:37.320
Jesus.

19:37.320 --> 19:39.320
I mean, I guess they're kind of too small for him.

19:39.320 --> 19:40.360
Get some llamas then.

19:40.360 --> 19:40.760
I don't know.

19:48.360 --> 19:52.600
I guess the nomadic people didn't actually bring any food for the journey.

19:56.680 --> 19:57.800
Don't worry, Harfoot.

19:57.800 --> 20:00.280
You put branches in your hair, they'll never find you.

20:01.800 --> 20:03.880
Yes, perfect camouflage.

20:07.560 --> 20:09.640
Wait, there's gonna be more bad CG dog?

20:17.880 --> 20:19.480
Oh, yeah, they'll never get you in there.

20:28.040 --> 20:29.400
No, that's more of a...

20:30.600 --> 20:31.400
Oh, Lord.

20:36.440 --> 20:38.120
Oh, and he always survived this far.

20:38.120 --> 20:49.080
Whoa, I think it's a different mission.

20:49.080 --> 20:50.120
I very think it's different.

20:55.240 --> 20:56.840
Nothing like casting a thunderclap.

21:00.680 --> 21:04.840
And so Galadriel mocks his force to humiliate some poor motherfucker.

21:09.000 --> 21:09.800
Never mind, I was wrong.

21:09.800 --> 21:11.560
She's gonna humiliate them all.

21:11.560 --> 21:12.520
Like, this is easy.

21:12.520 --> 21:13.400
It's just a woman.

21:14.440 --> 21:15.240
He is an elf.

21:16.280 --> 21:18.040
Humiliation in three...

21:19.800 --> 21:20.040
No?

21:20.040 --> 21:21.080
You gonna slow it down a bit?

21:24.680 --> 21:26.440
When it's so predictable, it's boring.

21:29.560 --> 21:33.400
My dude, you could swing even wider if you tried, but it'd be hard.

21:33.400 --> 21:35.240
You're not even trying to hit her.

21:38.120 --> 21:46.200
Okay, so if all 20 of you jump in, if you're gonna do it like this...

21:47.000 --> 21:48.200
He'd still beat their asses.

21:50.200 --> 21:52.120
He's gonna score a hit on her.

21:52.120 --> 21:55.240
On the bright side, they didn't hate the choreography there.

21:55.240 --> 21:56.120
Yeah, no.

21:56.120 --> 21:59.080
It was slow enough we could actually see what's happening.

21:59.080 --> 22:00.440
Yeah, and you know what?

22:01.000 --> 22:06.600
To be fair, if someone was going to score a hit, it would have to be

22:07.320 --> 22:08.680
like a named character.

22:09.960 --> 22:12.040
Like this guy or Halbrandt, yeah.

22:20.440 --> 22:22.280
Aww, I thought it was gonna be a Sildor.

22:22.920 --> 22:24.600
That would have been a great way to get him back in.

22:25.400 --> 22:28.680
Yeah, he was like a first-guess initiative.

22:29.480 --> 22:32.520
Well, our expectations have been subverted.

22:33.800 --> 22:35.720
And I'm disappointed even.

22:35.720 --> 22:38.680
I was kind of like, oh, that's kind of a clever way to get a Sildor in.

22:40.280 --> 22:41.880
No, no, don't worry.

22:41.880 --> 22:43.560
The no-name character will get in.

22:46.920 --> 22:48.680
Where did your racism go, father?

22:51.880 --> 22:53.480
I've gotten some help with Sili lately.

22:53.480 --> 22:54.040
He's like, what?

22:55.480 --> 22:55.960
No, no.

22:55.960 --> 22:59.160
Daddy's gotten some long-term racism in his sights.

22:59.880 --> 23:01.480
Elves will take orders from us.

23:03.080 --> 23:04.760
No, Marx, no.

23:04.760 --> 23:07.640
You can't be secretly racist against the chosen people.

23:20.840 --> 23:23.560
Man, I'm invested.

23:23.560 --> 23:24.840
Things are happening.

23:24.840 --> 23:26.200
I'm pleasantly surprised.

23:27.400 --> 23:28.680
The story is moving, finally.

23:30.920 --> 23:34.040
This feels like hour three of the season, not hour five.

23:34.040 --> 23:42.280
But still the same.

23:43.160 --> 23:45.720
My fingers aren't really icy in the morning, too.

23:45.720 --> 23:47.320
I feel when it's three a.m.

23:47.320 --> 23:49.880
and your G.F. wants to snuggle and she's freezing cold.

23:50.760 --> 23:59.320
No, I'm not lucky enough that this will kill her.

24:04.360 --> 24:07.400
Typically takes you people weeks just to decide to take her if I may.

24:09.640 --> 24:15.480
But the hand of we shall have to send it home with you so it can be treated with the proper respect.

24:17.720 --> 24:19.160
Only five minute walk.

24:19.160 --> 24:20.040
She'll be fine.

24:20.040 --> 24:23.240
Did he just chew him out of his table to people?

24:23.240 --> 24:23.740
Yep.

24:24.520 --> 24:26.520
It does certainly look that way.

24:27.160 --> 24:27.960
Very impressive.

24:28.520 --> 24:31.160
And he didn't even get the answer that he wanted in return.

24:31.160 --> 24:34.840
Yeah, no, that was a very shrewd act of jury.

24:41.400 --> 24:44.680
I still have a feeling they're going to do the Balrog like 1000 years there.

24:44.680 --> 24:45.400
They're going to do it.

24:47.400 --> 24:48.760
It's probably more in light.

24:49.640 --> 24:51.000
It had wings in that shot.

24:52.680 --> 24:53.640
Very controversial.

24:54.120 --> 24:59.000
Keeping your promise to his people and ensuring the doom of your own.

24:59.000 --> 25:03.400
Well, I guess we're just going to have to have a race war, aren't we?

25:05.400 --> 25:05.900
Jesus.

25:06.520 --> 25:07.800
Peace was never an option.

25:09.880 --> 25:15.080
The light of the Eldar, our light is fading.

25:15.960 --> 25:18.760
Did the dwarves find the orb or not?

25:23.720 --> 25:26.680
I swore an oath to Durin.

25:29.640 --> 25:30.140
To some.

25:31.560 --> 25:33.560
That may now hold little weight.

25:33.560 --> 25:35.400
I mean, that answer basically is yes.

25:36.680 --> 25:37.180
Yeah.

25:47.240 --> 25:48.680
That guy's definitely going to die.

25:49.960 --> 25:51.800
He's got a nice death leg right there.

25:51.800 --> 25:52.520
Oh, yeah, that's right.

25:52.520 --> 25:54.360
Those are all of his friends that he fucked over.

25:55.160 --> 25:58.840
You're only apologizing because you think now that I've been promoted.

25:59.160 --> 26:00.680
I can get you on the expedition.

26:04.360 --> 26:04.840
I would.

26:04.840 --> 26:05.400
I would.

26:05.400 --> 26:05.960
I would never.

26:05.960 --> 26:18.680
But yes, he's committing sabotage.

26:18.680 --> 26:19.400
How could he?

26:20.440 --> 26:22.920
Don't you have more pressing things to worry about right now?

26:26.680 --> 26:27.720
Start drinking it, guys.

26:28.680 --> 26:30.040
Oh, wait, no, that's that's not alcohol.

26:32.040 --> 26:32.840
Hand me the lantern.

26:33.960 --> 26:34.460
Don't.

26:37.480 --> 26:38.920
Yeah, yeah, make things worse.

26:41.560 --> 26:42.520
Yeah, see, good job.

26:43.800 --> 26:45.800
Good job, Isolde, you plot fuck.

26:46.440 --> 26:47.000
Good job.

26:51.560 --> 26:54.920
That's not quite how it works, but never mind.

26:55.800 --> 26:58.440
It's an ammo detonation or to black powder.

27:01.400 --> 27:02.440
Where did that one come from?

27:03.800 --> 27:05.480
secondary explosions.

27:05.480 --> 27:09.960
You know, that's how explosions work on another ship.

27:11.000 --> 27:11.880
No, no, I'm the same.

27:13.160 --> 27:13.960
That was the second ship.

27:19.720 --> 27:22.760
Why are you lying for him?

27:23.080 --> 27:25.560
This is how he gets on the expedition.

27:25.560 --> 27:27.080
He's going to be a hero for saving him.

27:28.280 --> 27:30.040
And all it took was sinking their fleet.

27:30.840 --> 27:33.960
I mean, wouldn't it be a hero for cashing the saboteur?

27:34.600 --> 27:35.800
Yeah, two ships.

27:35.800 --> 27:36.300
Yeah.

27:36.920 --> 27:39.480
So I guess the first ship exploded so hard.

27:39.480 --> 27:41.480
The second one just went like, I want to do that, too.

27:42.040 --> 27:42.540
Yep.

27:44.200 --> 27:47.160
They remember Blackwater from Game of Thrones.

27:47.160 --> 27:47.960
We can do that, too.

27:53.080 --> 27:57.960
Enough to saturate every last elf in the light of the valor once more.

28:00.840 --> 28:01.400
And yes.

28:03.720 --> 28:04.220
Yes.

28:05.240 --> 28:07.560
I don't think this is how Mithril works.

28:08.200 --> 28:13.000
Yeah, see, what I remember is that the elves made the rings

28:13.000 --> 28:16.680
to keep themselves from dying and their civilization from decaying.

28:17.320 --> 28:19.640
But Mithril wasn't part of that story, as far as I can remember.

28:19.640 --> 28:21.320
That the High King deceived me.

28:21.320 --> 28:23.400
I'm pretty sure this is all bullshit.

28:23.960 --> 28:25.720
Why do you keep fighting?

28:25.720 --> 28:27.000
Because I cannot stop.

28:27.560 --> 28:33.160
I believe they could no longer distinguish me from the evil I was fighting.

28:38.200 --> 28:39.560
You know, that's not a bad twist.

28:39.560 --> 28:40.200
I'm sorry.

28:40.200 --> 28:41.800
She is a war crazy maniac.

28:43.080 --> 28:43.580
Yeah.

28:45.400 --> 28:49.480
The thing is, she's a very interesting character.

28:50.120 --> 28:54.360
She's just not Galadriel, because this is actually a pretty great scene.

28:56.040 --> 28:58.600
I know what a hammer and tongs is yours.

28:58.600 --> 28:59.640
If she wasn't, yeah.

29:00.200 --> 29:00.700
Yeah.

29:01.240 --> 29:05.400
Even then, though, like, her entire reasoning is based on I can't stop fighting.

29:06.360 --> 29:06.860
Okay.

29:10.920 --> 29:12.680
I don't mind that works, though.

29:12.680 --> 29:13.640
I'm a psychologist.

29:14.280 --> 29:17.240
Yeah, I don't mind the whole PTSD haunted.

29:17.640 --> 29:21.400
Can't give up because, you know, she doesn't have PTSD.

29:21.400 --> 29:23.320
She'd never fought in the fucking war.

29:23.320 --> 29:23.820
Fair enough.

29:26.520 --> 29:29.640
You know, the story of someone who's just consumed by violence.

29:31.000 --> 29:33.080
The problem is she hasn't committed any violence.

29:35.480 --> 29:36.200
That's also true.

29:36.760 --> 29:38.280
They only have half the story here.

29:38.280 --> 29:43.160
And plus, the linchpin is that this kind of character can't be Galadriel.

29:43.160 --> 29:45.480
This is the kind of character who, like,

29:45.480 --> 29:48.120
would have killed someone and then regretted it or something.

29:51.080 --> 29:51.720
It would have worked.

29:54.600 --> 29:56.440
They forgot about the other half of the story.

29:57.160 --> 29:57.660
Yeah.

30:01.400 --> 30:02.120
Didn't like that.

30:05.000 --> 30:05.500
No.

30:08.360 --> 30:10.040
He's a fucking elf, you moron.

30:10.680 --> 30:11.800
He chose poorly.

30:13.160 --> 30:26.840
All of his wounds have closed up, too.

30:26.840 --> 30:28.360
It's that magic human loving.

30:28.360 --> 30:30.040
There's something you don't know.

30:31.240 --> 30:32.280
I've seen this before.

30:33.400 --> 30:40.600
It is a key conjured by some forgotten craft of the enemy to enslave your ancestors.

30:40.600 --> 30:41.240
Black device.

30:41.800 --> 30:43.560
You appear to be mildly outnumbered.

30:44.280 --> 30:47.080
You know, I didn't see the sword hilt being a key.

30:47.800 --> 30:49.080
I didn't call that one.

30:49.080 --> 30:50.520
This is like Helm's Deep Light.

30:53.640 --> 30:55.000
They didn't have the budget, okay?

30:55.960 --> 30:56.460
Okay.

30:58.200 --> 30:59.640
Store brand Helms Deep.

31:01.560 --> 31:03.560
Walmart, you know, it's not very.

31:03.560 --> 31:04.360
Oh, my God.

31:04.360 --> 31:06.680
They brought the fucking tablet.

31:06.680 --> 31:08.360
Wait, they're just carrying it back?

31:09.000 --> 31:10.760
I think elves have horses, though.

31:19.320 --> 31:20.280
All right, that's pretty good.

31:25.000 --> 31:27.800
Give it to me raw.

31:33.400 --> 31:36.920
That was a sudden fucking timeline, but okay.

31:37.480 --> 31:37.980
Yeah.

31:38.680 --> 31:42.600
Do you mean spring and a thousand years or a few months?

31:46.840 --> 31:49.160
This is not how Mithra fucking works.

31:49.160 --> 31:52.360
See, I'm assuming this is a way to make the whole dug too deep,

31:52.440 --> 31:57.800
greedily into less of just a, you know, drew move and more of a move out of necessity.

31:59.880 --> 32:01.480
But this isn't how Mithra works.

32:01.480 --> 32:04.360
Where elven race as in my hands.

32:05.160 --> 32:05.800
Whose hands?

32:09.080 --> 32:09.580
Yours.

32:20.920 --> 32:23.480
I do like that he actually went clean with them, though.

32:23.480 --> 32:25.320
Didn't do anything shenanigans.

32:25.320 --> 32:27.400
Yeah, I like the solution a lot better.

32:28.120 --> 32:30.200
Better than the George R. R. Martin show.

32:31.000 --> 32:32.600
He bought that awfully quick.

32:32.600 --> 32:35.960
Then again, has been honest with him.

32:35.960 --> 32:36.760
Hold on a second.

32:36.760 --> 32:38.360
It's not a long journey back.

32:38.360 --> 32:39.320
It's five minutes.

32:40.840 --> 32:42.840
This is, you know, a screen transition.

32:44.840 --> 32:47.000
Have we seen a horse in this show?

32:47.000 --> 32:51.240
Incidentally, just I want to say yes.

32:53.240 --> 32:54.840
A few times.

32:54.840 --> 32:59.000
I think only a numinar, though, because I don't think the garrison had any horses.

32:59.960 --> 33:04.360
Because of their cow, that fucking enormous slab of stone back.

33:04.920 --> 33:08.200
Yeah, we saw a cow and it had all the black milk.

33:09.640 --> 33:10.600
Oh, don't remind me.

33:10.600 --> 33:11.560
That's gross.

33:11.560 --> 33:13.160
That's like bad chocolate milk.

33:21.880 --> 33:24.360
Maybe the show run is just really don't like horses.

33:24.360 --> 33:28.360
Horses are expensive.

33:28.360 --> 33:29.400
Somebody just stole it.

33:30.200 --> 33:31.320
That's a trend.

33:31.320 --> 33:32.520
He turned back to get it.

33:33.800 --> 33:36.520
Attagon has decided that he wants to be king after all.

33:37.480 --> 33:40.200
It's a thin line of like fucking soldiers.

33:40.200 --> 33:40.840
Oh, my God.

33:42.120 --> 33:47.640
I'm like Hawkeye right now on the lookout for that T-shirt with the printed armor pattern.

33:50.680 --> 33:52.200
I want to see if we can catch it in the wild.

33:54.600 --> 33:55.320
Face looks done.

33:56.520 --> 33:57.560
I thought I'd point that out.

34:00.600 --> 34:02.760
Listen, Kibs, I think she's a cutie.

34:02.760 --> 34:03.320
I'd simp.

34:05.320 --> 34:06.440
You disgust me, Death.

34:07.320 --> 34:07.960
How could you?

34:10.120 --> 34:11.640
I'd sub to her OnlyFans.

34:13.400 --> 34:16.040
Wow, you've got that kind of free spending money.

34:17.560 --> 34:19.000
I think they're wearing the shirt now.

34:19.000 --> 34:20.840
Maybe take a close look at those dudes.

34:20.920 --> 34:24.280
They are in the armpit in the armpit.

34:24.280 --> 34:24.920
Oh, my God.

34:24.920 --> 34:25.640
They actually have it.

34:26.520 --> 34:28.440
Where did she get that from?

34:30.440 --> 34:34.120
Where did she get that from?

34:35.480 --> 34:37.000
She got it from the promotional department.

34:38.280 --> 34:41.880
She swam here, and I'm pretty sure she didn't bring that.

34:41.880 --> 34:42.440
She didn't.

34:43.160 --> 34:43.800
Where was it?

34:44.360 --> 34:45.800
I guess they just made it for her.

34:46.040 --> 34:46.680
Where was it?

34:47.480 --> 34:48.680
I guess they just made it for her.

34:48.680 --> 34:55.880
Maybe they just made it like the same armor and everything.

34:55.880 --> 34:57.960
Yeah, no, that is the exact same armor.

35:00.440 --> 35:01.000
That's right.

35:01.000 --> 35:03.960
Because she wore that suit before at the start of the show,

35:05.000 --> 35:07.080
but she left it behind when she got on the boat.

35:08.040 --> 35:10.280
So they just made her identical armor,

35:10.280 --> 35:11.640
and she just described it to them.

35:11.640 --> 35:15.640
I guess it's very stupid that I want you to know that.

35:17.800 --> 35:21.560
Did the show just forget that she swam here?

35:21.560 --> 35:22.920
I mean, Arch, I wish I could.

35:23.720 --> 35:27.800
So I need mastercrafted elven armor with intricate patterning,

35:27.800 --> 35:29.560
and I need it like next week.

35:30.520 --> 35:32.200
All right, come right up, boss.

35:32.200 --> 35:33.320
We made a styrofoam.

35:33.880 --> 35:35.320
I'm paying you an explosion.

35:40.360 --> 35:42.040
I really hate those sales, by the way.

35:44.280 --> 35:47.640
Listen, Arch, they catch wind, except the wind that goes in between them.

35:48.600 --> 35:50.840
Except for the wind that goes in between there.

35:50.840 --> 35:55.240
That's caught by the front sail, which catches the future wind.

35:56.040 --> 35:56.520
Singing.

35:57.720 --> 35:58.520
No, it's fine.

35:58.520 --> 35:59.400
We don't need singing.

36:00.120 --> 36:01.320
No, we don't need it.

36:01.320 --> 36:02.200
We don't need it, Kyle.

36:03.400 --> 36:03.960
Don't you want it?

36:04.920 --> 36:09.720
That was an episode of a TV show, if nothing else.

36:09.720 --> 36:12.840
I'm still not particularly involved, honestly.

36:12.840 --> 36:14.120
Wait a second, Kibbs.

36:15.320 --> 36:16.440
Kibbs, turn it off.

36:16.440 --> 36:17.320
What was that?

36:17.320 --> 36:18.280
Enormous fuck up.

36:21.080 --> 36:21.880
Jesus.

36:21.880 --> 36:22.440
All right.

36:23.640 --> 36:28.280
OK, so I think I've finally discovered my major issue with this show

36:28.280 --> 36:29.480
after watching this episode.

36:29.480 --> 36:32.760
OK, I formulated my dev thesis.

36:32.760 --> 36:33.960
Oh, here we go.

36:33.960 --> 36:36.840
Everything happening in this show is a mystery box.

36:36.840 --> 36:40.600
It's all mystery box writing and mystery boxes that have become

36:40.600 --> 36:45.400
they've like steadily gained in popularity since since lost back in the 2000s.

36:45.400 --> 36:46.040
Right.

36:46.040 --> 36:48.200
People love their mystery box writing.

36:48.200 --> 36:50.680
The problem with a mystery box in a prequel, though,

36:51.240 --> 36:52.760
is that we know where it's going to go.

36:54.280 --> 36:56.920
You know, like, what's the ore going to be?

36:56.920 --> 36:58.120
Oh, it's going to be mithril.

36:58.120 --> 36:59.160
What are the rings going to do?

36:59.160 --> 37:02.600
Oh, we know all this stuff already because we know where it goes.

37:02.680 --> 37:05.880
So they have to either change the lore, which is no good,

37:06.440 --> 37:09.400
or they have to introduce mystery boxes

37:09.960 --> 37:13.080
that don't really have any consequence to the wider story.

37:13.080 --> 37:19.400
The idea that mithril is solid light that can reinvigorate the elves

37:20.440 --> 37:24.920
does have enormous significance for the wider story.

37:25.480 --> 37:29.160
In fact, it has ridiculous significance for the wider story.

37:29.160 --> 37:31.240
Yeah, and that's the changing the lore part.

37:31.240 --> 37:31.740
Yeah.

37:32.140 --> 37:33.020
And see, that's the problem.

37:33.020 --> 37:37.260
I fucking hate mystery boxes because I view them as lazy ass goddamn writing.

37:37.260 --> 37:38.220
It's simply just.

37:38.220 --> 37:43.580
And then this magical thing appeared because it has no sense or reason.

37:43.580 --> 37:46.540
OK, so the the people were enslaved by a sword.

37:46.540 --> 37:49.500
No, that's that's not how this fucking functions.

37:49.500 --> 37:52.700
The sword of Sauron does not have the power to enslave a people.

37:52.700 --> 37:54.940
So they just have to make that shit up and go like,

37:54.940 --> 37:56.940
there's a mural over there with a sword on it.

37:56.940 --> 37:58.460
That's why it's a key.

37:58.460 --> 38:00.540
You're pulling this out of your ass.

38:00.540 --> 38:02.540
Yeah, it's kind of like there's a key.

38:02.540 --> 38:05.100
It's like, OK, do we know it's a key?

38:05.100 --> 38:08.140
Like, have you what evidence do you have suggestions like,

38:08.140 --> 38:11.340
well, you see, I knew about this mural here from 200 years ago.

38:11.340 --> 38:16.460
It's like, OK, I think that the show is like very safe in a lot of ways.

38:17.340 --> 38:19.820
Like with other shows, there are these moments where like,

38:19.820 --> 38:22.140
oh, my God, that's like crazy.

38:22.140 --> 38:26.300
And it really like I don't know, there's great moments of awe.

38:26.300 --> 38:29.900
I feel like this show is like scared to really give those to you.

38:30.620 --> 38:31.740
Yeah, aside from the CG.

38:33.500 --> 38:35.420
Yeah, just like the everyday CG.

38:35.420 --> 38:40.460
I think they might be trapped in the confines of it being a sequel.

38:40.460 --> 38:43.820
So there's so much they can do a prequel.

38:43.820 --> 38:44.940
Yeah, yeah.

38:44.940 --> 38:47.180
There's only so much they can do with that.

38:47.180 --> 38:50.540
But they have so much lore they could have done something with.

38:50.540 --> 38:53.100
And instead, they're just there's not doing it.

38:53.100 --> 38:57.420
They could have written the story that Tolkien wrote.

38:57.420 --> 38:58.540
They're not interested in that.

38:58.540 --> 39:01.580
They are interested in actively fucking it because they're

39:01.580 --> 39:03.340
interested in actively claiming it.

39:03.340 --> 39:05.580
This is to be Amazon's Lord of the Rings.

39:06.220 --> 39:08.060
That's why they are looking at me.

39:08.060 --> 39:11.580
So now I'm going like, oh, yeah, this is a magic metal that the elves need.

39:11.580 --> 39:13.340
Oh, it isn't the writers.

39:13.340 --> 39:16.380
The new writing team is trying to make this their own project.

39:16.380 --> 39:20.700
And I understand why, because they're trying to adapt it, but into their workflow.

39:20.700 --> 39:26.540
But the issue is you got to have a better understanding of what Tolkien's vision was.

39:27.180 --> 39:29.340
And instead of making your vision,

39:29.340 --> 39:31.980
you should instead being trying to follow in his footsteps

39:32.540 --> 39:35.500
to try to complete what he was going for to begin with.

39:35.500 --> 39:38.140
Well, they did directly say that this is this is

39:39.100 --> 39:42.060
they're like breaking free out from Tolkien's shadow.

39:42.060 --> 39:44.940
And this is this is the Lord of the Rings that Tolkien never wrote.

39:44.940 --> 39:48.060
And they said a lot of that stuff and the lead up to the show.

39:48.060 --> 39:54.060
So they were really they were really setting the stage for them saying, yeah, fuck lore.

39:54.060 --> 39:57.100
Which is very disrespectful to the the fans.

39:57.100 --> 39:59.020
It's disrespectful to the source material.

39:59.020 --> 40:01.420
It's disrespectful to the the author.

40:01.420 --> 40:05.660
You shouldn't you shouldn't try to dismiss the author that came before you.

40:05.660 --> 40:07.260
The guy who built all of this.

40:07.260 --> 40:10.060
Instead, you should honor that work and should do your best

40:10.060 --> 40:13.260
to try to pay homage to his vision.

40:13.260 --> 40:17.500
And well, it's also the fucking hubris of it.

40:17.500 --> 40:19.900
Like these are people that go like, no, no, we can do way better.

40:19.900 --> 40:22.940
Like, I'm sorry, but this is no goddamn Lord of the Rings.

40:22.940 --> 40:24.060
This is not even close.

40:24.060 --> 40:29.820
Like, if I'm being generous now, I might lift the show to like a five or a six.

40:29.820 --> 40:31.500
And they're like, oh, we know better.

40:32.060 --> 40:34.620
Yeah, out of ten out of 100.

40:34.620 --> 40:37.900
Lore complaints aside, how would the show in a vacuum?

40:38.700 --> 40:39.660
What are you all thinking?

40:40.540 --> 40:41.740
Oh, that's the best.

40:42.860 --> 40:43.900
Pretty average.

40:43.900 --> 40:44.860
Impressive scene.

40:44.860 --> 40:45.900
All right.

40:45.900 --> 40:47.340
For a random show.

40:48.140 --> 40:49.420
Yeah, it is there.

40:49.420 --> 40:49.900
They're right.

40:49.900 --> 40:51.580
I feel like it's got them first.

40:52.460 --> 40:55.420
Well, it just feels like it's always on like the precipice

40:55.420 --> 40:57.900
of like something really interesting happening.

40:57.900 --> 41:00.460
Where like you get these scenes with Galadriel and you're like,

41:00.460 --> 41:03.260
oh, like maybe her character is going to go in this direction.

41:03.260 --> 41:05.100
And that would be really interesting.

41:05.100 --> 41:07.740
Or it just happens with like every character.

41:07.740 --> 41:13.340
And it is kind of like the mystery box thing where it's hard to judge it

41:13.340 --> 41:16.940
because it's kind of promising a lot.

41:16.940 --> 41:19.660
It's like, listen, guys, it's going to get really good.

41:19.660 --> 41:21.500
It's kind of what the show is constantly saying.

41:22.300 --> 41:25.420
And if it delivers on that, that's cool.

41:25.420 --> 41:27.580
And then you can just say, well, it was a bit slow.

41:27.580 --> 41:32.620
But if it doesn't deliver on it, then that'll make all the previous moments

41:32.620 --> 41:34.380
feel a lot more cheap.

41:34.380 --> 41:36.220
It hasn't delivered yet, I don't think.

41:36.780 --> 41:41.260
No, it's writing with a presumed presumption.

41:41.260 --> 41:44.860
Like they've made up a story and now they're working their way towards it.

41:44.860 --> 41:49.020
Now suddenly Galadriel is like, oh, no, I just have to fight

41:49.020 --> 41:50.140
because okay, why do you have to fight?

41:50.140 --> 41:51.020
Well, I don't know about that.

41:51.020 --> 41:54.860
But this is my reason, you see, I'm becoming evil and I see it now.

41:54.860 --> 41:57.020
You haven't presented this previously.

41:57.020 --> 41:59.420
This at no point earlier, was there any indication

41:59.420 --> 42:02.700
that Galadriel was doing this for any sort of outside force?

42:02.700 --> 42:07.180
Like the only reasonable rationale appeared to be vengeance for her brother

42:07.180 --> 42:08.780
because that's all where it started.

42:08.780 --> 42:11.260
She didn't fight in the war against Morgoth.

42:11.260 --> 42:12.780
She hasn't seen action.

42:12.780 --> 42:15.340
And this is like, I'm an expert in fighting orcs.

42:15.340 --> 42:17.180
You probably haven't even seen one.

42:18.140 --> 42:20.300
She hasn't deserved any of this.

42:20.300 --> 42:23.020
And now she has a scene, which is a decent scene,

42:23.020 --> 42:24.780
but it's not for her character.

42:24.780 --> 42:26.220
It's for another character.

42:26.220 --> 42:31.900
But I mean, I think it is like, okay, if she's just like delusional a little bit, right?

42:31.900 --> 42:38.540
Like, no, just like someone who's like young and like, I mean in elf years,

42:38.540 --> 42:43.100
but like relatively young and wants to prove themselves and believes

42:43.100 --> 42:45.340
that they can do all of these things,

42:45.340 --> 42:48.540
but ultimately is going to kind of be disillusioned

42:48.540 --> 42:53.180
and then has to move through that disillusionment to like fulfill their character arc.

42:53.180 --> 42:55.420
I think that that's like an interesting character arc.

42:55.420 --> 42:57.660
That's definitely an archetype that can be good.

42:59.180 --> 43:01.900
Issue is one, she's one of the oldest elves alive

43:02.460 --> 43:05.420
and two, she's not going to be moving through anything.

43:05.420 --> 43:07.820
She is like right now though.

43:09.020 --> 43:10.460
She is one of the oldest elves alive.

43:11.580 --> 43:12.080
Damn.

43:12.940 --> 43:14.140
Yeah, that's what I mean.

43:14.140 --> 43:16.060
This is the wrong character to do that story with.

43:16.780 --> 43:18.300
And she is not going to move through it.

43:18.300 --> 43:19.900
She cannot be allowed to fail.

43:19.900 --> 43:25.340
Like she takes on like what, six, seven people and humiliates them utterly.

43:25.340 --> 43:28.380
And the best one manages to do is scratch her clothing,

43:28.380 --> 43:30.300
which doesn't even fulfill the actual.

43:30.300 --> 43:32.540
She is an elf in fairness.

43:32.540 --> 43:33.900
And they're all humans.

43:33.900 --> 43:34.380
That's true.

43:34.380 --> 43:35.100
Yeah, but that's the thing.

43:35.100 --> 43:36.460
Elves aren't that fucking good.

43:36.460 --> 43:37.580
That's that's the thing too.

43:38.220 --> 43:40.220
Hold on, Arch, hold on.

43:40.220 --> 43:41.420
I'm going to disagree with you here,

43:41.420 --> 43:44.940
because Legolas did surf on a shield down a staircase.

43:44.940 --> 43:47.900
Okay, no, elves are like supernaturally talented.

43:47.900 --> 43:51.900
And also she has like hundreds of years of experience on these people.

43:51.900 --> 43:52.860
No, she doesn't.

43:52.860 --> 43:53.740
She does not.

43:53.740 --> 43:58.220
She's been fighting a war for a couple of years, tops.

43:58.220 --> 44:01.580
Yeah, but she's had lots of time to train and practice.

44:01.580 --> 44:02.300
She hasn't.

44:02.300 --> 44:03.260
She's collateral.

44:03.260 --> 44:04.540
She hasn't trained.

44:04.540 --> 44:07.500
She's never picked up a sword before her brother died.

44:07.500 --> 44:10.140
That's like explicitly like she's never trained.

44:10.860 --> 44:12.860
Yes, because there wasn't a war.

44:12.860 --> 44:16.860
Like the concept of war didn't exist until Morgoth appeared.

44:16.860 --> 44:18.140
Yep, that's true.

44:18.140 --> 44:20.620
Yeah, the whole thing about Galadriel is she's not a warrior.

44:20.620 --> 44:23.340
And the story, she's actually a sorcerer.

44:23.340 --> 44:24.300
Yeah, she was a sorceress.

44:24.300 --> 44:27.020
Yeah, she was supposed to be like a backline kind of person.

44:27.020 --> 44:29.420
So it's very weird that she's taking this front line.

44:29.420 --> 44:30.780
Because Galadriel is clever.

44:30.780 --> 44:32.220
She's very powerful.

44:32.220 --> 44:34.380
In fact, very powerful.

44:34.380 --> 44:37.900
She's one of the most powerful characters on the side of good.

44:37.980 --> 44:42.220
I guess you could say in terms of her actual magical capabilities.

44:42.220 --> 44:45.660
But she's always reserved because she's more of a tactician.

44:45.660 --> 44:49.260
She's always thinking ahead about the general positioning of things.

44:49.260 --> 44:50.700
She's never directly involved.

44:51.260 --> 44:55.180
And that's kind of the problem with the show is they've kind of butchered her character.

44:55.180 --> 44:59.100
Her brilliance is diminished and her intellect is diminished.

44:59.100 --> 45:02.940
Because instead of her intellect being her strength, it's not even her strength.

45:02.940 --> 45:04.460
She's kind of an idiot.

45:04.460 --> 45:06.220
She feels I could see that.

45:06.220 --> 45:07.260
She's kind of a warrior.

45:07.500 --> 45:09.820
They've taken away her brilliance.

45:09.820 --> 45:11.580
And that's the part that bothers me.

45:12.300 --> 45:15.900
Because she's supposed to be very, very smart.

45:15.900 --> 45:17.660
She's supposed to see the broader picture.

45:18.460 --> 45:20.540
And she kind of did in the beginning.

45:20.540 --> 45:22.380
She understood Sauron was still around.

45:22.380 --> 45:24.540
But they didn't really, they should have focused on that.

45:24.540 --> 45:26.860
Like, okay, like, all right, how do you understand that?

45:26.860 --> 45:31.420
Like, show us how you put those pieces of the puzzle together so that you came up with it.

45:31.420 --> 45:33.260
Like, no, no, Sauron's still a threat.

45:33.260 --> 45:34.300
And here's why.

45:34.300 --> 45:36.620
Here's all these really, like, well thought out reasons.

45:36.620 --> 45:37.820
All these clues and evidence.

45:37.820 --> 45:40.220
But she saw it at emblem, Kibbs.

45:40.220 --> 45:42.460
Yeah, and they, I know, but they do it.

45:42.460 --> 45:46.780
They just do it like, oh, she found it in an archive and she finally now got the proof.

45:46.780 --> 45:48.700
It's like, that's not very Galadriel.

45:48.700 --> 45:52.060
Galadriel's like, she's supposed to be smarter than this.

45:52.060 --> 45:52.460
I don't know.

45:52.460 --> 45:54.140
It feels like a disservice to the character.

45:54.140 --> 45:56.700
Her, too, get back to the point about the fighting skills.

45:56.700 --> 46:01.420
Even Legolas, who was an exceptional fighter by even elven standards.

46:02.220 --> 46:06.860
He only takes on a couple of enemies at once and kills them quickly.

46:06.860 --> 46:09.980
Like, at no point is Legolas under attack by, like, six,

46:09.980 --> 46:13.900
seven orcs and carrying out a lengthy duel against them whilst not killing them.

46:14.620 --> 46:15.100
I don't know.

46:15.100 --> 46:17.500
I feel like this is not the most unbelievable thing.

46:17.500 --> 46:21.260
Like, these are, like, not super trained recruits that are just like kids.

46:21.260 --> 46:24.220
Yeah, well, two of those people were sea guard trainees.

46:24.220 --> 46:27.740
They were the ones who were kicked out of the sea guard after Isildur did these things.

46:27.740 --> 46:29.660
They are trained fighters.

46:29.660 --> 46:30.300
That's true.

46:30.380 --> 46:31.580
There's at least two of them that are.

46:31.580 --> 46:35.180
I know that they recruited a lot of raw guys, though.

46:35.180 --> 46:42.700
And plus, the boss man said that they had more recruits than they had spaces.

46:42.700 --> 46:44.300
These aren't randos from the street.

46:44.300 --> 46:45.900
He has the pick of the crop.

46:45.900 --> 46:46.460
I don't know.

46:46.460 --> 46:50.460
I mean, like, I feel like these guys have not really seen war either, though.

46:50.460 --> 46:55.580
Like, most of their training is gonna be just, you know, practice.

46:56.140 --> 47:01.260
I think the implication is that they're inexperienced and they haven't seen proper.

47:01.260 --> 47:02.060
Right.

47:02.060 --> 47:04.780
That's like my reading of their characters.

47:04.780 --> 47:07.100
I think that's what that's what they're trying to do,

47:07.660 --> 47:12.380
but I'm not sure if they necessarily got that across, but I kind of see it.

47:12.380 --> 47:13.100
Yeah.

47:13.100 --> 47:16.540
Okay, that'll do it for this week.

47:16.540 --> 47:18.220
Thanks for being here, everyone.

47:18.220 --> 47:19.660
Welcome aboard, Taftash.

47:19.660 --> 47:20.540
Thanks, Dev.

47:20.540 --> 47:22.300
Hey, just a curiosity.

47:22.300 --> 47:26.620
If we do continue to do this stuff, what show do we do next after this one's over?

47:27.340 --> 47:28.940
You guys want to do She-Hulk?

47:28.940 --> 47:29.340
No.

47:29.340 --> 47:31.020
I don't mind doing She-Hulk.

47:31.020 --> 47:32.780
It seems cringy enough.

47:34.060 --> 47:35.580
God, you guys are masochists.

47:36.380 --> 47:36.940
I don't know.

47:38.940 --> 47:41.100
We'll watch the vine boom twerk.

47:42.220 --> 47:44.220
How much cancer do you want to contract?

47:44.220 --> 47:45.900
I'll catch them all, I guess.
