Hey guys, Dev here.

00:01.360 --> 00:06.320
My previous indefensible video, titled Imigos Insanity, the legacy of Don Thacker, has been

00:06.320 --> 00:07.880
taken down by YouTube.

00:07.880 --> 00:12.340
YouTube claims that it's violated its community policies and that my channel has been given

00:12.340 --> 00:13.960
a community guidelines strike.

00:13.960 --> 00:18.140
When I went to go appeal the strike, there was no option to do so and my channel panel

00:18.140 --> 00:23.460
shows no community guidelines strike, leaving me with no way to appeal a strike that doesn't

00:23.460 --> 00:26.320
exist but very clearly my video is still down.

00:26.320 --> 00:30.440
It's possible that Don Thacker himself filed the strike with YouTube in order to try to

00:30.440 --> 00:31.440
silence me.

00:31.440 --> 00:35.960
It's also possible that one of the anonymous sources used in the video filed the strike,

00:35.960 --> 00:39.040
because two of them actually emailed me, stating that they were very disappointed that the

00:39.040 --> 00:43.520
information they gave Musical Antihero was used in his and my videos.

00:43.520 --> 00:48.180
Now those people requested to remain anonymous and I did leave them anonymous, but if their

00:48.180 --> 00:53.420
objection is that the information that they gave us was anonymously used, then the only

00:53.420 --> 00:57.420
thing I have to ask is why they gave it to us in the first place.

00:57.420 --> 01:00.100
In any case, I don't intend to be silenced.

01:00.100 --> 01:05.180
The video will be going up on an SFO backups channel and if it gets taken down there, I'll

01:05.180 --> 01:10.260
put it up on Vimeo or I'll put it up on Dailymotion or I'll put it up on Bitchute, I'll put it

01:10.260 --> 01:15.880
up wherever and I give everybody who's currently watching this full permission to mirror and

01:15.880 --> 01:17.940
re-upload this video as you see fit.

01:17.940 --> 01:22.160
A link to the backup channel as well as the video itself should be in the description,

01:22.160 --> 01:25.440
it should be in the card section of this video and it should be on screen right now

01:25.440 --> 01:27.060
as part of the end slate.

01:27.060 --> 01:28.840
So click that link and enjoy guys.
