0	1360	Hey guys, Dev here.
1360	6320	My previous indefensible video, titled Imigos Insanity, the legacy of Don Thacker, has been
6320	7880	taken down by YouTube.
7880	12340	YouTube claims that it's violated its community policies and that my channel has been given
12340	13960	a community guidelines strike.
13960	18140	When I went to go appeal the strike, there was no option to do so and my channel panel
18140	23460	shows no community guidelines strike, leaving me with no way to appeal a strike that doesn't
23460	26320	exist but very clearly my video is still down.
26320	30440	It's possible that Don Thacker himself filed the strike with YouTube in order to try to
30440	31440	silence me.
31440	35960	It's also possible that one of the anonymous sources used in the video filed the strike,
35960	39040	because two of them actually emailed me, stating that they were very disappointed that the
39040	43520	information they gave Musical Antihero was used in his and my videos.
43520	48180	Now those people requested to remain anonymous and I did leave them anonymous, but if their
48180	53420	objection is that the information that they gave us was anonymously used, then the only
53420	57420	thing I have to ask is why they gave it to us in the first place.
57420	60100	In any case, I don't intend to be silenced.
60100	65180	The video will be going up on an SFO backups channel and if it gets taken down there, I'll
65180	70260	put it up on Vimeo or I'll put it up on Dailymotion or I'll put it up on Bitchute, I'll put it
70260	75880	up wherever and I give everybody who's currently watching this full permission to mirror and
75880	77940	re-upload this video as you see fit.
77940	82160	A link to the backup channel as well as the video itself should be in the description,
82160	85440	it should be in the card section of this video and it should be on screen right now
85440	87060	as part of the end slate.
87060	88840	So click that link and enjoy guys.
