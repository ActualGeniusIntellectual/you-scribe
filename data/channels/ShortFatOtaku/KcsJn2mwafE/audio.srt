Hey guys, Dev here.

2
00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:06,320
My previous indefensible video, titled Imigos Insanity, the legacy of Don Thacker, has been

3
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:07,880
taken down by YouTube.

4
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:12,340
YouTube claims that it's violated its community policies and that my channel has been given

5
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:13,960
a community guidelines strike.

6
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:18,140
When I went to go appeal the strike, there was no option to do so and my channel panel

7
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:23,460
shows no community guidelines strike, leaving me with no way to appeal a strike that doesn't

8
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:26,320
exist but very clearly my video is still down.

9
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:30,440
It's possible that Don Thacker himself filed the strike with YouTube in order to try to

10
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:31,440
silence me.

11
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:35,960
It's also possible that one of the anonymous sources used in the video filed the strike,

12
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:39,040
because two of them actually emailed me, stating that they were very disappointed that the

13
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:43,520
information they gave Musical Antihero was used in his and my videos.

14
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:48,180
Now those people requested to remain anonymous and I did leave them anonymous, but if their

15
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:53,420
objection is that the information that they gave us was anonymously used, then the only

16
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:57,420
thing I have to ask is why they gave it to us in the first place.

17
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:00,100
In any case, I don't intend to be silenced.

18
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:05,180
The video will be going up on an SFO backups channel and if it gets taken down there, I'll

19
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:10,260
put it up on Vimeo or I'll put it up on Dailymotion or I'll put it up on Bitchute, I'll put it

20
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:15,880
up wherever and I give everybody who's currently watching this full permission to mirror and

21
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:17,940
re-upload this video as you see fit.

22
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:22,160
A link to the backup channel as well as the video itself should be in the description,

23
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:25,440
it should be in the card section of this video and it should be on screen right now

24
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:27,060
as part of the end slate.

25
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:28,840
So click that link and enjoy guys.
