0	6000	So Naomi, what are we doing today?
6000	14000	We're going to the grocery store to buy plants because going to an actual greenhouse is too
14000	15000	expensive.
15000	16000	Also, they seem to suck.
16000	19000	Remember the ones that we bought a couple of years ago that just died from the greenhouse?
19000	20000	Jeez.
20000	24560	So on our way to get plants, we were stuck in a traffic jam.
24560	25880	I wonder what happened.
25880	30280	It's almost gridlock traffic and it's 10.04 AM.
30280	32280	There's no reason for it to be gridlocked.
32280	33280	I don't think the phone can even show that.
33280	34280	Oh, whatever.
34280	35280	It's 10.04 AM.
35280	40760	Maybe they heard that there's a lot of amazing deals on new plants for gardens and everyone's
40760	41760	going to get them.
41760	42760	There's literally no deals.
42760	43760	It's just that there's plants.
43760	45760	Well, they've been sold out of weather here.
45760	46760	We've done this.
46760	47760	Oh my God.
47760	49280	The student driver's stuck in this.
49280	50280	Yep.
50280	52240	And there's an actual student in there.
52240	53240	We looked.
53240	54240	Feels bad, man.
54240	55240	Yeah.
55600	58440	I would probably be panicking a lot if I was in my student driving days, stuck in like
58440	59440	this much traffic.
59440	61440	I'd be like, oh no, what do we do?
61440	64440	Naomi, do you want jalapenos?
64440	65440	No.
65440	70400	They're sweet green peppers.
70400	73880	Which we're not going to go through enough of, even if we get, you can only get like
73880	74880	three.
74880	76880	You can't get to take six.
76880	79400	Well, that's what you get.
79400	81400	Actually, those were kind of old.
81400	83400	We're shopping at Costco.
83560	88560	Oh, look at all the pretty plants.
88560	93560	Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do.
93560	95560	They're not cucumbers.
95560	97560	They are.
97560	98560	They're organic.
98560	103360	So, with GameStop in the distance there, you can see that we're coming to get the new
103360	104560	Zelda game.
104560	108400	However, we're also here to grab some plants.
108400	112660	Not at GameStop, obviously, because those preliminary plants that we grabbed, I guess
112920	114920	we got them way too early or something because...
114920	115920	They're dead.
115920	116920	They died.
116920	117920	Dead.
117920	118920	Dead.
118920	119920	Dead.
119920	120920	Dead.
120920	121920	Either the heat got them or the frost got them.
121920	123920	It was probably frost, actually, because it's been warm, but not that warm.
123920	125920	So, we've got to go get new plants.
125920	130920	By the way, if we're late for the Tears of the Kingdom stream, this is why.
130920	132920	I blame Dev.
132920	135920	So, Naomi, it's Slim Pickens once again.
135920	140920	You get many different kinds of tomatoes and many different kinds of peppers.
141180	143180	So, what do you feel like?
143180	145180	Oh, we can have beans, too.
145180	147180	How did the chard work out, by the way?
147180	149180	I recall it being okay last year.
149180	150180	Uh...
150180	151180	Wasn't it?
151180	152180	Yes.
152180	153180	We can get more of that.
153180	154180	Sure.
154180	155180	Rather than kale?
155180	156180	Sure.
156180	158180	Since you still have a bunch of frozen kale in the freezer?
158180	159180	Yep.
159180	160180	We've got to eat more of that, you know?
160180	164180	Okay, so let's try to go with maybe less plants this time, because we really jammed them in
164180	165180	there last year, right?
165180	167180	Do you want heirloom tomatoes?
167180	169180	Do you want sauce tomatoes?
169180	170180	I don't want sauce tomatoes.
170180	171180	No?
171180	172180	Do you want slicer tomatoes?
172180	173180	Sure.
173180	174180	Let's say we get four tomatoes.
174180	176180	How many did you get last year?
176180	178180	Either six or eight, and it was too many.
178180	180180	And now let's grab four peppers.
180180	181180	Let's try to find some spicy ones.
181180	183180	No spicy peppers.
183180	187180	Do you want a sweet bell pepper, then, or do you just want a bell pepper, though?
187180	188180	What's the difference?
188180	191180	I guess this one's sweeter, but these ones are colored.
191180	192180	Well, then let's get this.
192180	193180	Even though that's racist.
193180	194180	You're racist.
194180	196180	We could also just get sweet peppers.
196180	198180	These are the shepherd peppers.
198180	199180	Why don't we just get one of each?
200180	201180	One of each type of pepper?
201180	202180	Why not?
202180	204180	Make stuffed peppers for me, though, to see if I like it.
204180	206180	Is that because you just watched that episode of House where they had stuffed peppers?
206180	207180	I'll grab one of these and one of those.
207180	208180	Yeah.
208180	209180	What are these?
209180	210180	The same.
210180	211180	These are Brussels sprouts.
211180	212180	There's the...
212180	213180	Yeah, those, yeah.
213180	215180	Because we picked up the Swiss chard really late last year, and it worked out fine.
215180	216180	Yes.
216180	217180	You know what?
217180	218180	I never grow beans before.
218180	220180	I want to try growing beans this year.
220180	221180	Something new.
221180	222180	That's...
222180	223180	That means we're not getting peas.
223180	225180	Yeah, we won't get peas this time.
225180	226180	We'll just get beans.
226180	229180	Let's grab some of these bean plants here.
229180	231180	Let's try them out, actually.
231180	232180	Do they grow like vines?
232180	233180	I don't know.
233180	234180	Looks like it.
234180	236180	Looks like Jack the Beanstalk does.
236180	240180	A stringless snap bean that matures early and offers superior flavor.
240180	241180	You know what?
241180	242180	It's worth a shot.
242180	243180	If it doesn't work, it doesn't work.
243180	244180	We say we tried it.
244180	247180	So this is our collection of stuff.
247180	248180	These four chards.
248180	250180	That entire tray of things.
250180	251180	This tray.
251180	253180	Yeah, you have to thumbs up the camera.
254180	256180	You're really bad at that, you know?
256180	258180	I am, yeah.
258180	259180	We're back home.
259180	262180	As you can see, the garden is not open yet.
262180	267180	And because we have to go out and play the new Zelda game, I can't do that today.
267180	270180	So, I'm just going to use a water bottle.
270180	272180	It's a spray bottle full of water.
272180	274180	Don't worry, that's actually cleaner.
274180	276180	It is water in there.
276180	282180	And I'm just going to mist them for now.
283180	287180	And tomorrow we'll open the garden up.
287180	289180	That's the plan.
291180	293180	Oh, hi Naomi.
295180	297180	Wait, why are you leaving?
306180	309180	It's the next day, bright and early.
310180	313180	And we are going to set this up.
313180	315180	There's a few things we've got to do first.
315180	318180	First, this door.
318180	322180	I know we've been using doors this whole time, but it's got to be replaced.
322180	324180	I'll probably have to do something with the lattice as well.
324180	328180	That's lasted about four or five years, but that's not looking so good.
328180	331180	And I guess meanwhile Naomi, do you want to till?
331180	332180	Sure.
332180	334180	You want to mix all this leaf stuff in?
334180	341180	So I picked up this board, because I guess we are past the point of using doors for the garden walls.
341180	345180	And I've got to put this...
345180	347180	I think it's the right size.
347180	349180	This is going to be the new front wall of the garden.
349180	356180	Now that I'm looking at it though, it might be a bit too long for it to cut it.
356180	361180	Naomi's raking right beside me and I can already tell there's a very earthy smell coming out of the garden.
362180	371180	I'm pretty sure I can just reuse the same screws too, so I'll just take them out.
371180	374180	This should just come off now.
374180	376180	I think I've gotten all the...
376180	378180	Come on.
381180	384180	Did I miss a screw? Or is it just really in there?
384180	386180	It's just really in there.
387180	389180	Oh.
389180	392180	Oh no, all this soil.
392180	395180	I'm just ripping the door. I'm just ripping the door.
395180	399180	What I have to do now, I think, is just shovel this earth back, because it's all going to come out.
399180	401180	I'm realizing this now stupidly.
401180	403180	Here's the whole door.
403180	405180	It finally came out.
409180	413180	And so, shovel this back, put the new wood in.
413180	414180	That's the plan.
414180	417180	I know we eyeballed it at the store, Naomi, but it's probably fine, right?
417180	420180	See, that's kind of close to fine.
422180	424180	What do you think?
424180	426180	Looks good, just that.
426180	427180	Just slightly too long.
427180	431180	I can just screw that into the deck and into this wooden piece here.
431180	435180	And this end looks pretty good too, it's just the overlap, which I can easily get rid of.
435180	437180	I'll just saw it out later.
437180	440180	That's a big pile of leaves, Naomi. Are you jumping in?
440180	443180	No, there's probably bugs in there.
444180	449180	There we go.
449180	452180	And there it is! It's in!
452180	454180	I'll just cut off the end piece later.
454180	457180	I think the next thing to do is bring compost in from over there, eh?
457180	461180	After I pour the compost, I want to try and shore up this.
461180	463180	You can see it's just...
463180	468180	I kept it there using bungee cords, but they've long since...
468180	471180	Those are like four years ago, they're done.
471180	473180	I may just re-screw it.
475180	476180	There we go.
476180	480180	Now I don't think there was a second screw down here.
480180	482180	It doesn't look like it.
482180	485180	I thought it might have been this one for a minute,
485180	489180	but that's actually that screw there that's broken.
490180	491180	See?
491180	494180	Because the garden's slowly coming apart.
494180	497180	Now this thing's seven or eight years old, so I'm not surprised.
497180	501180	I don't want to put too much money into it, because we might actually be leaving.
501180	505180	And I've said that a lot over the years, but it might actually happen now, so...
505180	509180	I'm just going to try to hold this together as best I can for one more year.
509180	513180	So since screwing it is not going to work anymore, all the wood's too rotted and too old,
513180	518180	I dug a hole, and I'm going to put a patio stone in there, because we have a bunch of them lying around,
518180	520180	and I'll be able to prop it up for one more year.
520180	522180	I'm not surprised it rotted.
523180	524180	It's, uh...
524180	528180	This stuff's basically made of, like, housing materials that we scavenged
528180	531180	back when I couldn't afford to do a real garden.
531180	534180	But there. Just shove that in there.
534180	536180	It'll be okay, I'm sure.
536180	538180	Okay, Naomi.
538180	541180	It's gross compost time once again.
541180	542180	Are you excited?
542180	543180	No.
545180	548180	Let's see what we got this time. Let's open it up.
549180	551180	It's always hard to open every year.
553180	557180	And there it is. Look at all that good earth.
558180	560180	Let's shovel that in.
562180	563180	And here we go.
563180	565180	Naomi's well on her way with tilling.
565180	567180	So you can just till in the new earth.
567180	569180	And then it'll be time to plant.
569180	574180	Okay, so Naomi, this time for the manure, I'm just using some junky scissors we have lying around,
574180	577180	not the actual, uh, kitchen scissors.
579180	580180	Open up.
580180	581180	Open up.
581180	585180	I think that's why I don't use these. They don't cut or shit. Open up.
586180	590180	I can't believe, Naomi, you would delegate me to low-quality scissors.
591180	592180	Covered in poop.
593180	598180	So the plan is, since we got less plants this year, because we were crowding the garden too much,
599180	602180	we have the beans, not peas this time.
602180	603180	They'll go with the lattice.
603180	609180	The chard will probably go here, because that's the easiest place we can snip it for salads.
609180	612180	Tomatoes will go in the back, because they do like some shade.
612180	614180	And the peppers will go right here.
615180	617180	We have four of each, so way less.
617180	621180	And at some point we'll get cucumbers and they'll go in that corner again to grow on this lattice.
621180	623180	You're pretty much done with the, uh, tilling, aren't you?
624180	625180	I guess I'll start planting then.
626180	630180	Okay, if you've seen the previous garden videos, you've seen me do this.
630180	632180	I'm not going to go into super high detail.
633180	634180	Always dig with your hands up.
634180	636180	Ooh, it's kind of tough. Maybe I won't dig with my hands.
636180	637180	Okay, hold on.
637180	638180	Sometimes you need a spade.
639180	641180	But usually I just dig with my hands.
642180	643180	Chop the earth up so it's soft.
643180	648180	When you put it back in, it's harder for plants to go through, uh, tough dirt.
648180	649180	I'll grab the pepper plant.
649180	650180	Get the chairs.
651180	652180	Right there.
655180	656180	Come on!
656180	657180	It's tough doing this one-handed.
658180	659180	There's the pepper plant.
659180	661180	I've got a handful of the manure.
661180	662180	There it is.
663180	664180	Throw it in there.
664180	665180	Plant.
666180	667180	Dirt.
667180	670180	Now just repeat for, uh, everything.
671180	672180	And there we go.
673180	674180	That's everything.
676180	679180	I'll just water it all up.
680180	681180	But yeah.
683180	684180	The chard.
685180	686180	The tomatoes.
687180	688180	The peppers.
689180	691180	And the beans, not peas this time.
692180	693180	They're all in.
693180	698180	The last thing to do is to get some cucumbers and put them in that spot there.
699180	701180	I can't wait to see how it turns out this year.
701180	702180	You know what?
702180	705180	When I was cleaning up, I noticed something.
705180	713180	Growing on the side of the tray that I grabbed the chard from was an extra little chard plant in the excess dirt on the tray.
714180	715180	I wonder if this will grow.
715180	723180	It looks kind of ratty, but I'll make an extra spot in the middle of the four chards.
725180	726180	Real quickly here.
727180	728180	Manure in.
729180	733180	And then, let's see if I can just scrape it.
736180	738180	There, I'll just put it in.
740180	741180	Let's see if this actually...
741180	744180	I don't think this will work out, but I'm kind of curious.
745180	746180	Oh, no, I'm going to get four.
746180	747180	I don't have room for four.
747180	748180	Yes, you do.
750180	751180	You need to get less peppers.
752180	753180	No, no, there's...
753180	755180	I had six at every plant last year.
755180	756180	I'm getting four every plant this year.
757180	759180	Sometimes, Naomi, your ideas are wrong.
760180	761180	Sometimes I'm always right, and then you never...
761180	763180	Sometimes I'm always right.
763180	764180	Sometimes I'm always right.
764180	765180	That means that it's not sometimes.
765180	766180	Yeah, I know.
767180	768180	It means that it's not always.
768180	769180	I know.
769180	771180	You are so mean to me.
771180	772180	God dammit.
772180	774180	You never can listen to my ideas.
