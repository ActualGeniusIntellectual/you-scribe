1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
So Naomi, what are we doing today?

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:14,000
We're going to the grocery store to buy plants because going to an actual greenhouse is too

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
expensive.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Also, they seem to suck.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Remember the ones that we bought a couple of years ago that just died from the greenhouse?

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Jeez.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,560
So on our way to get plants, we were stuck in a traffic jam.

8
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:25,880
I wonder what happened.

9
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:30,280
It's almost gridlock traffic and it's 10.04 AM.

10
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:32,280
There's no reason for it to be gridlocked.

11
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:33,280
I don't think the phone can even show that.

12
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:34,280
Oh, whatever.

13
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:35,280
It's 10.04 AM.

14
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:40,760
Maybe they heard that there's a lot of amazing deals on new plants for gardens and everyone's

15
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:41,760
going to get them.

16
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:42,760
There's literally no deals.

17
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:43,760
It's just that there's plants.

18
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:45,760
Well, they've been sold out of weather here.

19
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:46,760
We've done this.

20
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:47,760
Oh my God.

21
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,280
The student driver's stuck in this.

22
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:50,280
Yep.

23
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:52,240
And there's an actual student in there.

24
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:53,240
We looked.

25
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:54,240
Feels bad, man.

26
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:55,240
Yeah.

27
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:58,440
I would probably be panicking a lot if I was in my student driving days, stuck in like

28
00:00:58,440 --> 00:00:59,440
this much traffic.

29
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:01,440
I'd be like, oh no, what do we do?

30
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:04,440
Naomi, do you want jalapenos?

31
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:05,440
No.

32
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:10,400
They're sweet green peppers.

33
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,880
Which we're not going to go through enough of, even if we get, you can only get like

34
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:14,880
three.

35
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:16,880
You can't get to take six.

36
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:19,400
Well, that's what you get.

37
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:21,400
Actually, those were kind of old.

38
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:23,400
We're shopping at Costco.

39
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:28,560
Oh, look at all the pretty plants.

40
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:33,560
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do.

41
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:35,560
They're not cucumbers.

42
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:37,560
They are.

43
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:38,560
They're organic.

44
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:43,360
So, with GameStop in the distance there, you can see that we're coming to get the new

45
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:44,560
Zelda game.

46
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:48,400
However, we're also here to grab some plants.

47
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:52,660
Not at GameStop, obviously, because those preliminary plants that we grabbed, I guess

48
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,920
we got them way too early or something because...

49
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:55,920
They're dead.

50
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:56,920
They died.

51
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:57,920
Dead.

52
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:58,920
Dead.

53
00:01:58,920 --> 00:01:59,920
Dead.

54
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:00,920
Dead.

55
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:01,920
Either the heat got them or the frost got them.

56
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,920
It was probably frost, actually, because it's been warm, but not that warm.

57
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,920
So, we've got to go get new plants.

58
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:10,920
By the way, if we're late for the Tears of the Kingdom stream, this is why.

59
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:12,920
I blame Dev.

60
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:15,920
So, Naomi, it's Slim Pickens once again.

61
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:20,920
You get many different kinds of tomatoes and many different kinds of peppers.

62
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:23,180
So, what do you feel like?

63
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:25,180
Oh, we can have beans, too.

64
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:27,180
How did the chard work out, by the way?

65
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:29,180
I recall it being okay last year.

66
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:30,180
Uh...

67
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:31,180
Wasn't it?

68
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:32,180
Yes.

69
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:33,180
We can get more of that.

70
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:34,180
Sure.

71
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:35,180
Rather than kale?

72
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:36,180
Sure.

73
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:38,180
Since you still have a bunch of frozen kale in the freezer?

74
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:39,180
Yep.

75
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:40,180
We've got to eat more of that, you know?

76
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:44,180
Okay, so let's try to go with maybe less plants this time, because we really jammed them in

77
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:45,180
there last year, right?

78
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:47,180
Do you want heirloom tomatoes?

79
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:49,180
Do you want sauce tomatoes?

80
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:50,180
I don't want sauce tomatoes.

81
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:51,180
No?

82
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:52,180
Do you want slicer tomatoes?

83
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:53,180
Sure.

84
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:54,180
Let's say we get four tomatoes.

85
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:56,180
How many did you get last year?

86
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:58,180
Either six or eight, and it was too many.

87
00:02:58,180 --> 00:03:00,180
And now let's grab four peppers.

88
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:01,180
Let's try to find some spicy ones.

89
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:03,180
No spicy peppers.

90
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:07,180
Do you want a sweet bell pepper, then, or do you just want a bell pepper, though?

91
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:08,180
What's the difference?

92
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:11,180
I guess this one's sweeter, but these ones are colored.

93
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:12,180
Well, then let's get this.

94
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:13,180
Even though that's racist.

95
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:14,180
You're racist.

96
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:16,180
We could also just get sweet peppers.

97
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:18,180
These are the shepherd peppers.

98
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:19,180
Why don't we just get one of each?

99
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:21,180
One of each type of pepper?

100
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:22,180
Why not?

101
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:24,180
Make stuffed peppers for me, though, to see if I like it.

102
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:26,180
Is that because you just watched that episode of House where they had stuffed peppers?

103
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:27,180
I'll grab one of these and one of those.

104
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:28,180
Yeah.

105
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:29,180
What are these?

106
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:30,180
The same.

107
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:31,180
These are Brussels sprouts.

108
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:32,180
There's the...

109
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:33,180
Yeah, those, yeah.

110
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:35,180
Because we picked up the Swiss chard really late last year, and it worked out fine.

111
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:36,180
Yes.

112
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:37,180
You know what?

113
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:38,180
I never grow beans before.

114
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:40,180
I want to try growing beans this year.

115
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:41,180
Something new.

116
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:42,180
That's...

117
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:43,180
That means we're not getting peas.

118
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:45,180
Yeah, we won't get peas this time.

119
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:46,180
We'll just get beans.

120
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:49,180
Let's grab some of these bean plants here.

121
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:51,180
Let's try them out, actually.

122
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:52,180
Do they grow like vines?

123
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:53,180
I don't know.

124
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:54,180
Looks like it.

125
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:56,180
Looks like Jack the Beanstalk does.

126
00:03:56,180 --> 00:04:00,180
A stringless snap bean that matures early and offers superior flavor.

127
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:01,180
You know what?

128
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:02,180
It's worth a shot.

129
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:03,180
If it doesn't work, it doesn't work.

130
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:04,180
We say we tried it.

131
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:07,180
So this is our collection of stuff.

132
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:08,180
These four chards.

133
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:10,180
That entire tray of things.

134
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:11,180
This tray.

135
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:13,180
Yeah, you have to thumbs up the camera.

136
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:16,180
You're really bad at that, you know?

137
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:18,180
I am, yeah.

138
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:19,180
We're back home.

139
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:22,180
As you can see, the garden is not open yet.

140
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:27,180
And because we have to go out and play the new Zelda game, I can't do that today.

141
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:30,180
So, I'm just going to use a water bottle.

142
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:32,180
It's a spray bottle full of water.

143
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:34,180
Don't worry, that's actually cleaner.

144
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:36,180
It is water in there.

145
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:42,180
And I'm just going to mist them for now.

146
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:47,180
And tomorrow we'll open the garden up.

147
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:49,180
That's the plan.

148
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:53,180
Oh, hi Naomi.

149
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:57,180
Wait, why are you leaving?

150
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:09,180
It's the next day, bright and early.

151
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:13,180
And we are going to set this up.

152
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:15,180
There's a few things we've got to do first.

153
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:18,180
First, this door.

154
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:22,180
I know we've been using doors this whole time, but it's got to be replaced.

155
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:24,180
I'll probably have to do something with the lattice as well.

156
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:28,180
That's lasted about four or five years, but that's not looking so good.

157
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:31,180
And I guess meanwhile Naomi, do you want to till?

158
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:32,180
Sure.

159
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:34,180
You want to mix all this leaf stuff in?

160
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:41,180
So I picked up this board, because I guess we are past the point of using doors for the garden walls.

161
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:45,180
And I've got to put this...

162
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:47,180
I think it's the right size.

163
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:49,180
This is going to be the new front wall of the garden.

164
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:56,180
Now that I'm looking at it though, it might be a bit too long for it to cut it.

165
00:05:56,180 --> 00:06:01,180
Naomi's raking right beside me and I can already tell there's a very earthy smell coming out of the garden.

166
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:11,180
I'm pretty sure I can just reuse the same screws too, so I'll just take them out.

167
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:14,180
This should just come off now.

168
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:16,180
I think I've gotten all the...

169
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:18,180
Come on.

170
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:24,180
Did I miss a screw? Or is it just really in there?

171
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:26,180
It's just really in there.

172
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:29,180
Oh.

173
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:32,180
Oh no, all this soil.

174
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:35,180
I'm just ripping the door. I'm just ripping the door.

175
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:39,180
What I have to do now, I think, is just shovel this earth back, because it's all going to come out.

176
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:41,180
I'm realizing this now stupidly.

177
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:43,180
Here's the whole door.

178
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:45,180
It finally came out.

179
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:53,180
And so, shovel this back, put the new wood in.

180
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:54,180
That's the plan.

181
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:57,180
I know we eyeballed it at the store, Naomi, but it's probably fine, right?

182
00:06:57,180 --> 00:07:00,180
See, that's kind of close to fine.

183
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:04,180
What do you think?

184
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:06,180
Looks good, just that.

185
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:07,180
Just slightly too long.

186
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:11,180
I can just screw that into the deck and into this wooden piece here.

187
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:15,180
And this end looks pretty good too, it's just the overlap, which I can easily get rid of.

188
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:17,180
I'll just saw it out later.

189
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:20,180
That's a big pile of leaves, Naomi. Are you jumping in?

190
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:23,180
No, there's probably bugs in there.

191
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:29,180
There we go.

192
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:32,180
And there it is! It's in!

193
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:34,180
I'll just cut off the end piece later.

194
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:37,180
I think the next thing to do is bring compost in from over there, eh?

195
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:41,180
After I pour the compost, I want to try and shore up this.

196
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:43,180
You can see it's just...

197
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:48,180
I kept it there using bungee cords, but they've long since...

198
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:51,180
Those are like four years ago, they're done.

199
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:53,180
I may just re-screw it.

200
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:56,180
There we go.

201
00:07:56,180 --> 00:08:00,180
Now I don't think there was a second screw down here.

202
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:02,180
It doesn't look like it.

203
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:05,180
I thought it might have been this one for a minute,

204
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:09,180
but that's actually that screw there that's broken.

205
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:11,180
See?

206
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:14,180
Because the garden's slowly coming apart.

207
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:17,180
Now this thing's seven or eight years old, so I'm not surprised.

208
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:21,180
I don't want to put too much money into it, because we might actually be leaving.

209
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:25,180
And I've said that a lot over the years, but it might actually happen now, so...

210
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:29,180
I'm just going to try to hold this together as best I can for one more year.

211
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:33,180
So since screwing it is not going to work anymore, all the wood's too rotted and too old,

212
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:38,180
I dug a hole, and I'm going to put a patio stone in there, because we have a bunch of them lying around,

213
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:40,180
and I'll be able to prop it up for one more year.

214
00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:42,180
I'm not surprised it rotted.

215
00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:44,180
It's, uh...

216
00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:48,180
This stuff's basically made of, like, housing materials that we scavenged

217
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:51,180
back when I couldn't afford to do a real garden.

218
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:54,180
But there. Just shove that in there.

219
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:56,180
It'll be okay, I'm sure.

220
00:08:56,180 --> 00:08:58,180
Okay, Naomi.

221
00:08:58,180 --> 00:09:01,180
It's gross compost time once again.

222
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:02,180
Are you excited?

223
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:03,180
No.

224
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:08,180
Let's see what we got this time. Let's open it up.

225
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:11,180
It's always hard to open every year.

226
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:17,180
And there it is. Look at all that good earth.

227
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:20,180
Let's shovel that in.

228
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:23,180
And here we go.

229
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:25,180
Naomi's well on her way with tilling.

230
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:27,180
So you can just till in the new earth.

231
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:29,180
And then it'll be time to plant.

232
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:34,180
Okay, so Naomi, this time for the manure, I'm just using some junky scissors we have lying around,

233
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:37,180
not the actual, uh, kitchen scissors.

234
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:40,180
Open up.

235
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:41,180
Open up.

236
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:45,180
I think that's why I don't use these. They don't cut or shit. Open up.

237
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:50,180
I can't believe, Naomi, you would delegate me to low-quality scissors.

238
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:52,180
Covered in poop.

239
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:58,180
So the plan is, since we got less plants this year, because we were crowding the garden too much,

240
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:02,180
we have the beans, not peas this time.

241
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:03,180
They'll go with the lattice.

242
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:09,180
The chard will probably go here, because that's the easiest place we can snip it for salads.

243
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:12,180
Tomatoes will go in the back, because they do like some shade.

244
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:14,180
And the peppers will go right here.

245
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:17,180
We have four of each, so way less.

246
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:21,180
And at some point we'll get cucumbers and they'll go in that corner again to grow on this lattice.

247
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:23,180
You're pretty much done with the, uh, tilling, aren't you?

248
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:25,180
I guess I'll start planting then.

249
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:30,180
Okay, if you've seen the previous garden videos, you've seen me do this.

250
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:32,180
I'm not going to go into super high detail.

251
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:34,180
Always dig with your hands up.

252
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:36,180
Ooh, it's kind of tough. Maybe I won't dig with my hands.

253
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:37,180
Okay, hold on.

254
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:38,180
Sometimes you need a spade.

255
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:41,180
But usually I just dig with my hands.

256
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:43,180
Chop the earth up so it's soft.

257
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:48,180
When you put it back in, it's harder for plants to go through, uh, tough dirt.

258
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:49,180
I'll grab the pepper plant.

259
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:50,180
Get the chairs.

260
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:52,180
Right there.

261
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:56,180
Come on!

262
00:10:56,180 --> 00:10:57,180
It's tough doing this one-handed.

263
00:10:58,180 --> 00:10:59,180
There's the pepper plant.

264
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:01,180
I've got a handful of the manure.

265
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:02,180
There it is.

266
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:04,180
Throw it in there.

267
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:05,180
Plant.

268
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:07,180
Dirt.

269
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:10,180
Now just repeat for, uh, everything.

270
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:12,180
And there we go.

271
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:14,180
That's everything.

272
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:19,180
I'll just water it all up.

273
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:21,180
But yeah.

274
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:24,180
The chard.

275
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:26,180
The tomatoes.

276
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:28,180
The peppers.

277
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:31,180
And the beans, not peas this time.

278
00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:33,180
They're all in.

279
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:38,180
The last thing to do is to get some cucumbers and put them in that spot there.

280
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:41,180
I can't wait to see how it turns out this year.

281
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:42,180
You know what?

282
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:45,180
When I was cleaning up, I noticed something.

283
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:53,180
Growing on the side of the tray that I grabbed the chard from was an extra little chard plant in the excess dirt on the tray.

284
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:55,180
I wonder if this will grow.

285
00:11:55,180 --> 00:12:03,180
It looks kind of ratty, but I'll make an extra spot in the middle of the four chards.

286
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:06,180
Real quickly here.

287
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:08,180
Manure in.

288
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:13,180
And then, let's see if I can just scrape it.

289
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:18,180
There, I'll just put it in.

290
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:21,180
Let's see if this actually...

291
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:24,180
I don't think this will work out, but I'm kind of curious.

292
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:26,180
Oh, no, I'm going to get four.

293
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:27,180
I don't have room for four.

294
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:28,180
Yes, you do.

295
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:31,180
You need to get less peppers.

296
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:33,180
No, no, there's...

297
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:35,180
I had six at every plant last year.

298
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:36,180
I'm getting four every plant this year.

299
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:39,180
Sometimes, Naomi, your ideas are wrong.

300
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:41,180
Sometimes I'm always right, and then you never...

301
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:43,180
Sometimes I'm always right.

302
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:44,180
Sometimes I'm always right.

303
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:45,180
That means that it's not sometimes.

304
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:46,180
Yeah, I know.

305
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:48,180
It means that it's not always.

306
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:49,180
I know.

307
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:51,180
You are so mean to me.

308
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:52,180
God dammit.

309
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:54,180
You never can listen to my ideas.

310
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:55,180
Okay, I'm going to do it right now, Naomi.

311
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:56,180
Yeah.

312
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:58,180
And then I'm going to yell at you later for it.

313
00:12:58,180 --> 00:12:59,180
Sure.

314
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:01,180
I'll be right, so it doesn't matter.

315
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:02,180
Yeah.

316
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:03,180
Because I am always right.

317
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:04,180
You're carrying them.
