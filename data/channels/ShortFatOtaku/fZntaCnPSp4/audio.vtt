WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:06.000
So Naomi, what are we doing today?

00:06.000 --> 00:14.000
We're going to the grocery store to buy plants because going to an actual greenhouse is too

00:14.000 --> 00:15.000
expensive.

00:15.000 --> 00:16.000
Also, they seem to suck.

00:16.000 --> 00:19.000
Remember the ones that we bought a couple of years ago that just died from the greenhouse?

00:19.000 --> 00:20.000
Jeez.

00:20.000 --> 00:24.560
So on our way to get plants, we were stuck in a traffic jam.

00:24.560 --> 00:25.880
I wonder what happened.

00:25.880 --> 00:30.280
It's almost gridlock traffic and it's 10.04 AM.

00:30.280 --> 00:32.280
There's no reason for it to be gridlocked.

00:32.280 --> 00:33.280
I don't think the phone can even show that.

00:33.280 --> 00:34.280
Oh, whatever.

00:34.280 --> 00:35.280
It's 10.04 AM.

00:35.280 --> 00:40.760
Maybe they heard that there's a lot of amazing deals on new plants for gardens and everyone's

00:40.760 --> 00:41.760
going to get them.

00:41.760 --> 00:42.760
There's literally no deals.

00:42.760 --> 00:43.760
It's just that there's plants.

00:43.760 --> 00:45.760
Well, they've been sold out of weather here.

00:45.760 --> 00:46.760
We've done this.

00:46.760 --> 00:47.760
Oh my God.

00:47.760 --> 00:49.280
The student driver's stuck in this.

00:49.280 --> 00:50.280
Yep.

00:50.280 --> 00:52.240
And there's an actual student in there.

00:52.240 --> 00:53.240
We looked.

00:53.240 --> 00:54.240
Feels bad, man.

00:54.240 --> 00:55.240
Yeah.

00:55.600 --> 00:58.440
I would probably be panicking a lot if I was in my student driving days, stuck in like

00:58.440 --> 00:59.440
this much traffic.

00:59.440 --> 01:01.440
I'd be like, oh no, what do we do?

01:01.440 --> 01:04.440
Naomi, do you want jalapenos?

01:04.440 --> 01:05.440
No.

01:05.440 --> 01:10.400
They're sweet green peppers.

01:10.400 --> 01:13.880
Which we're not going to go through enough of, even if we get, you can only get like

01:13.880 --> 01:14.880
three.

01:14.880 --> 01:16.880
You can't get to take six.

01:16.880 --> 01:19.400
Well, that's what you get.

01:19.400 --> 01:21.400
Actually, those were kind of old.

01:21.400 --> 01:23.400
We're shopping at Costco.

01:23.560 --> 01:28.560
Oh, look at all the pretty plants.

01:28.560 --> 01:33.560
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do.

01:33.560 --> 01:35.560
They're not cucumbers.

01:35.560 --> 01:37.560
They are.

01:37.560 --> 01:38.560
They're organic.

01:38.560 --> 01:43.360
So, with GameStop in the distance there, you can see that we're coming to get the new

01:43.360 --> 01:44.560
Zelda game.

01:44.560 --> 01:48.400
However, we're also here to grab some plants.

01:48.400 --> 01:52.660
Not at GameStop, obviously, because those preliminary plants that we grabbed, I guess

01:52.920 --> 01:54.920
we got them way too early or something because...

01:54.920 --> 01:55.920
They're dead.

01:55.920 --> 01:56.920
They died.

01:56.920 --> 01:57.920
Dead.

01:57.920 --> 01:58.920
Dead.

01:58.920 --> 01:59.920
Dead.

01:59.920 --> 02:00.920
Dead.

02:00.920 --> 02:01.920
Either the heat got them or the frost got them.

02:01.920 --> 02:03.920
It was probably frost, actually, because it's been warm, but not that warm.

02:03.920 --> 02:05.920
So, we've got to go get new plants.

02:05.920 --> 02:10.920
By the way, if we're late for the Tears of the Kingdom stream, this is why.

02:10.920 --> 02:12.920
I blame Dev.

02:12.920 --> 02:15.920
So, Naomi, it's Slim Pickens once again.

02:15.920 --> 02:20.920
You get many different kinds of tomatoes and many different kinds of peppers.

02:21.180 --> 02:23.180
So, what do you feel like?

02:23.180 --> 02:25.180
Oh, we can have beans, too.

02:25.180 --> 02:27.180
How did the chard work out, by the way?

02:27.180 --> 02:29.180
I recall it being okay last year.

02:29.180 --> 02:30.180
Uh...

02:30.180 --> 02:31.180
Wasn't it?

02:31.180 --> 02:32.180
Yes.

02:32.180 --> 02:33.180
We can get more of that.

02:33.180 --> 02:34.180
Sure.

02:34.180 --> 02:35.180
Rather than kale?

02:35.180 --> 02:36.180
Sure.

02:36.180 --> 02:38.180
Since you still have a bunch of frozen kale in the freezer?

02:38.180 --> 02:39.180
Yep.

02:39.180 --> 02:40.180
We've got to eat more of that, you know?

02:40.180 --> 02:44.180
Okay, so let's try to go with maybe less plants this time, because we really jammed them in

02:44.180 --> 02:45.180
there last year, right?

02:45.180 --> 02:47.180
Do you want heirloom tomatoes?

02:47.180 --> 02:49.180
Do you want sauce tomatoes?

02:49.180 --> 02:50.180
I don't want sauce tomatoes.

02:50.180 --> 02:51.180
No?

02:51.180 --> 02:52.180
Do you want slicer tomatoes?

02:52.180 --> 02:53.180
Sure.

02:53.180 --> 02:54.180
Let's say we get four tomatoes.

02:54.180 --> 02:56.180
How many did you get last year?

02:56.180 --> 02:58.180
Either six or eight, and it was too many.

02:58.180 --> 03:00.180
And now let's grab four peppers.

03:00.180 --> 03:01.180
Let's try to find some spicy ones.

03:01.180 --> 03:03.180
No spicy peppers.

03:03.180 --> 03:07.180
Do you want a sweet bell pepper, then, or do you just want a bell pepper, though?

03:07.180 --> 03:08.180
What's the difference?

03:08.180 --> 03:11.180
I guess this one's sweeter, but these ones are colored.

03:11.180 --> 03:12.180
Well, then let's get this.

03:12.180 --> 03:13.180
Even though that's racist.

03:13.180 --> 03:14.180
You're racist.

03:14.180 --> 03:16.180
We could also just get sweet peppers.

03:16.180 --> 03:18.180
These are the shepherd peppers.

03:18.180 --> 03:19.180
Why don't we just get one of each?

03:20.180 --> 03:21.180
One of each type of pepper?

03:21.180 --> 03:22.180
Why not?

03:22.180 --> 03:24.180
Make stuffed peppers for me, though, to see if I like it.

03:24.180 --> 03:26.180
Is that because you just watched that episode of House where they had stuffed peppers?

03:26.180 --> 03:27.180
I'll grab one of these and one of those.

03:27.180 --> 03:28.180
Yeah.

03:28.180 --> 03:29.180
What are these?

03:29.180 --> 03:30.180
The same.

03:30.180 --> 03:31.180
These are Brussels sprouts.

03:31.180 --> 03:32.180
There's the...

03:32.180 --> 03:33.180
Yeah, those, yeah.

03:33.180 --> 03:35.180
Because we picked up the Swiss chard really late last year, and it worked out fine.

03:35.180 --> 03:36.180
Yes.

03:36.180 --> 03:37.180
You know what?

03:37.180 --> 03:38.180
I never grow beans before.

03:38.180 --> 03:40.180
I want to try growing beans this year.

03:40.180 --> 03:41.180
Something new.

03:41.180 --> 03:42.180
That's...

03:42.180 --> 03:43.180
That means we're not getting peas.

03:43.180 --> 03:45.180
Yeah, we won't get peas this time.

03:45.180 --> 03:46.180
We'll just get beans.

03:46.180 --> 03:49.180
Let's grab some of these bean plants here.

03:49.180 --> 03:51.180
Let's try them out, actually.

03:51.180 --> 03:52.180
Do they grow like vines?

03:52.180 --> 03:53.180
I don't know.

03:53.180 --> 03:54.180
Looks like it.

03:54.180 --> 03:56.180
Looks like Jack the Beanstalk does.

03:56.180 --> 04:00.180
A stringless snap bean that matures early and offers superior flavor.

04:00.180 --> 04:01.180
You know what?

04:01.180 --> 04:02.180
It's worth a shot.

04:02.180 --> 04:03.180
If it doesn't work, it doesn't work.

04:03.180 --> 04:04.180
We say we tried it.

04:04.180 --> 04:07.180
So this is our collection of stuff.

04:07.180 --> 04:08.180
These four chards.

04:08.180 --> 04:10.180
That entire tray of things.

04:10.180 --> 04:11.180
This tray.

04:11.180 --> 04:13.180
Yeah, you have to thumbs up the camera.

04:14.180 --> 04:16.180
You're really bad at that, you know?

04:16.180 --> 04:18.180
I am, yeah.

04:18.180 --> 04:19.180
We're back home.

04:19.180 --> 04:22.180
As you can see, the garden is not open yet.

04:22.180 --> 04:27.180
And because we have to go out and play the new Zelda game, I can't do that today.

04:27.180 --> 04:30.180
So, I'm just going to use a water bottle.

04:30.180 --> 04:32.180
It's a spray bottle full of water.

04:32.180 --> 04:34.180
Don't worry, that's actually cleaner.

04:34.180 --> 04:36.180
It is water in there.

04:36.180 --> 04:42.180
And I'm just going to mist them for now.

04:43.180 --> 04:47.180
And tomorrow we'll open the garden up.

04:47.180 --> 04:49.180
That's the plan.

04:51.180 --> 04:53.180
Oh, hi Naomi.

04:55.180 --> 04:57.180
Wait, why are you leaving?

05:06.180 --> 05:09.180
It's the next day, bright and early.

05:10.180 --> 05:13.180
And we are going to set this up.

05:13.180 --> 05:15.180
There's a few things we've got to do first.

05:15.180 --> 05:18.180
First, this door.

05:18.180 --> 05:22.180
I know we've been using doors this whole time, but it's got to be replaced.

05:22.180 --> 05:24.180
I'll probably have to do something with the lattice as well.

05:24.180 --> 05:28.180
That's lasted about four or five years, but that's not looking so good.

05:28.180 --> 05:31.180
And I guess meanwhile Naomi, do you want to till?

05:31.180 --> 05:32.180
Sure.

05:32.180 --> 05:34.180
You want to mix all this leaf stuff in?

05:34.180 --> 05:41.180
So I picked up this board, because I guess we are past the point of using doors for the garden walls.

05:41.180 --> 05:45.180
And I've got to put this...

05:45.180 --> 05:47.180
I think it's the right size.

05:47.180 --> 05:49.180
This is going to be the new front wall of the garden.

05:49.180 --> 05:56.180
Now that I'm looking at it though, it might be a bit too long for it to cut it.

05:56.180 --> 06:01.180
Naomi's raking right beside me and I can already tell there's a very earthy smell coming out of the garden.

06:02.180 --> 06:11.180
I'm pretty sure I can just reuse the same screws too, so I'll just take them out.

06:11.180 --> 06:14.180
This should just come off now.

06:14.180 --> 06:16.180
I think I've gotten all the...

06:16.180 --> 06:18.180
Come on.

06:21.180 --> 06:24.180
Did I miss a screw? Or is it just really in there?

06:24.180 --> 06:26.180
It's just really in there.

06:27.180 --> 06:29.180
Oh.

06:29.180 --> 06:32.180
Oh no, all this soil.

06:32.180 --> 06:35.180
I'm just ripping the door. I'm just ripping the door.

06:35.180 --> 06:39.180
What I have to do now, I think, is just shovel this earth back, because it's all going to come out.

06:39.180 --> 06:41.180
I'm realizing this now stupidly.

06:41.180 --> 06:43.180
Here's the whole door.

06:43.180 --> 06:45.180
It finally came out.

06:49.180 --> 06:53.180
And so, shovel this back, put the new wood in.

06:53.180 --> 06:54.180
That's the plan.

06:54.180 --> 06:57.180
I know we eyeballed it at the store, Naomi, but it's probably fine, right?

06:57.180 --> 07:00.180
See, that's kind of close to fine.

07:02.180 --> 07:04.180
What do you think?

07:04.180 --> 07:06.180
Looks good, just that.

07:06.180 --> 07:07.180
Just slightly too long.

07:07.180 --> 07:11.180
I can just screw that into the deck and into this wooden piece here.

07:11.180 --> 07:15.180
And this end looks pretty good too, it's just the overlap, which I can easily get rid of.

07:15.180 --> 07:17.180
I'll just saw it out later.

07:17.180 --> 07:20.180
That's a big pile of leaves, Naomi. Are you jumping in?

07:20.180 --> 07:23.180
No, there's probably bugs in there.

07:24.180 --> 07:29.180
There we go.

07:29.180 --> 07:32.180
And there it is! It's in!

07:32.180 --> 07:34.180
I'll just cut off the end piece later.

07:34.180 --> 07:37.180
I think the next thing to do is bring compost in from over there, eh?

07:37.180 --> 07:41.180
After I pour the compost, I want to try and shore up this.

07:41.180 --> 07:43.180
You can see it's just...

07:43.180 --> 07:48.180
I kept it there using bungee cords, but they've long since...

07:48.180 --> 07:51.180
Those are like four years ago, they're done.

07:51.180 --> 07:53.180
I may just re-screw it.

07:55.180 --> 07:56.180
There we go.

07:56.180 --> 08:00.180
Now I don't think there was a second screw down here.

08:00.180 --> 08:02.180
It doesn't look like it.

08:02.180 --> 08:05.180
I thought it might have been this one for a minute,

08:05.180 --> 08:09.180
but that's actually that screw there that's broken.

08:10.180 --> 08:11.180
See?

08:11.180 --> 08:14.180
Because the garden's slowly coming apart.

08:14.180 --> 08:17.180
Now this thing's seven or eight years old, so I'm not surprised.

08:17.180 --> 08:21.180
I don't want to put too much money into it, because we might actually be leaving.

08:21.180 --> 08:25.180
And I've said that a lot over the years, but it might actually happen now, so...

08:25.180 --> 08:29.180
I'm just going to try to hold this together as best I can for one more year.

08:29.180 --> 08:33.180
So since screwing it is not going to work anymore, all the wood's too rotted and too old,

08:33.180 --> 08:38.180
I dug a hole, and I'm going to put a patio stone in there, because we have a bunch of them lying around,

08:38.180 --> 08:40.180
and I'll be able to prop it up for one more year.

08:40.180 --> 08:42.180
I'm not surprised it rotted.

08:43.180 --> 08:44.180
It's, uh...

08:44.180 --> 08:48.180
This stuff's basically made of, like, housing materials that we scavenged

08:48.180 --> 08:51.180
back when I couldn't afford to do a real garden.

08:51.180 --> 08:54.180
But there. Just shove that in there.

08:54.180 --> 08:56.180
It'll be okay, I'm sure.

08:56.180 --> 08:58.180
Okay, Naomi.

08:58.180 --> 09:01.180
It's gross compost time once again.

09:01.180 --> 09:02.180
Are you excited?

09:02.180 --> 09:03.180
No.

09:05.180 --> 09:08.180
Let's see what we got this time. Let's open it up.

09:09.180 --> 09:11.180
It's always hard to open every year.

09:13.180 --> 09:17.180
And there it is. Look at all that good earth.

09:18.180 --> 09:20.180
Let's shovel that in.

09:22.180 --> 09:23.180
And here we go.

09:23.180 --> 09:25.180
Naomi's well on her way with tilling.

09:25.180 --> 09:27.180
So you can just till in the new earth.

09:27.180 --> 09:29.180
And then it'll be time to plant.

09:29.180 --> 09:34.180
Okay, so Naomi, this time for the manure, I'm just using some junky scissors we have lying around,

09:34.180 --> 09:37.180
not the actual, uh, kitchen scissors.

09:39.180 --> 09:40.180
Open up.

09:40.180 --> 09:41.180
Open up.

09:41.180 --> 09:45.180
I think that's why I don't use these. They don't cut or shit. Open up.

09:46.180 --> 09:50.180
I can't believe, Naomi, you would delegate me to low-quality scissors.

09:51.180 --> 09:52.180
Covered in poop.

09:53.180 --> 09:58.180
So the plan is, since we got less plants this year, because we were crowding the garden too much,

09:59.180 --> 10:02.180
we have the beans, not peas this time.

10:02.180 --> 10:03.180
They'll go with the lattice.

10:03.180 --> 10:09.180
The chard will probably go here, because that's the easiest place we can snip it for salads.

10:09.180 --> 10:12.180
Tomatoes will go in the back, because they do like some shade.

10:12.180 --> 10:14.180
And the peppers will go right here.

10:15.180 --> 10:17.180
We have four of each, so way less.

10:17.180 --> 10:21.180
And at some point we'll get cucumbers and they'll go in that corner again to grow on this lattice.

10:21.180 --> 10:23.180
You're pretty much done with the, uh, tilling, aren't you?

10:24.180 --> 10:25.180
I guess I'll start planting then.

10:26.180 --> 10:30.180
Okay, if you've seen the previous garden videos, you've seen me do this.

10:30.180 --> 10:32.180
I'm not going to go into super high detail.

10:33.180 --> 10:34.180
Always dig with your hands up.

10:34.180 --> 10:36.180
Ooh, it's kind of tough. Maybe I won't dig with my hands.

10:36.180 --> 10:37.180
Okay, hold on.

10:37.180 --> 10:38.180
Sometimes you need a spade.

10:39.180 --> 10:41.180
But usually I just dig with my hands.

10:42.180 --> 10:43.180
Chop the earth up so it's soft.

10:43.180 --> 10:48.180
When you put it back in, it's harder for plants to go through, uh, tough dirt.

10:48.180 --> 10:49.180
I'll grab the pepper plant.

10:49.180 --> 10:50.180
Get the chairs.

10:51.180 --> 10:52.180
Right there.

10:55.180 --> 10:56.180
Come on!

10:56.180 --> 10:57.180
It's tough doing this one-handed.

10:58.180 --> 10:59.180
There's the pepper plant.

10:59.180 --> 11:01.180
I've got a handful of the manure.

11:01.180 --> 11:02.180
There it is.

11:03.180 --> 11:04.180
Throw it in there.

11:04.180 --> 11:05.180
Plant.

11:06.180 --> 11:07.180
Dirt.

11:07.180 --> 11:10.180
Now just repeat for, uh, everything.

11:11.180 --> 11:12.180
And there we go.

11:13.180 --> 11:14.180
That's everything.

11:16.180 --> 11:19.180
I'll just water it all up.

11:20.180 --> 11:21.180
But yeah.

11:23.180 --> 11:24.180
The chard.

11:25.180 --> 11:26.180
The tomatoes.

11:27.180 --> 11:28.180
The peppers.

11:29.180 --> 11:31.180
And the beans, not peas this time.

11:32.180 --> 11:33.180
They're all in.

11:33.180 --> 11:38.180
The last thing to do is to get some cucumbers and put them in that spot there.

11:39.180 --> 11:41.180
I can't wait to see how it turns out this year.

11:41.180 --> 11:42.180
You know what?

11:42.180 --> 11:45.180
When I was cleaning up, I noticed something.

11:45.180 --> 11:53.180
Growing on the side of the tray that I grabbed the chard from was an extra little chard plant in the excess dirt on the tray.

11:54.180 --> 11:55.180
I wonder if this will grow.

11:55.180 --> 12:03.180
It looks kind of ratty, but I'll make an extra spot in the middle of the four chards.

12:05.180 --> 12:06.180
Real quickly here.

12:07.180 --> 12:08.180
Manure in.

12:09.180 --> 12:13.180
And then, let's see if I can just scrape it.

12:16.180 --> 12:18.180
There, I'll just put it in.

12:20.180 --> 12:21.180
Let's see if this actually...

12:21.180 --> 12:24.180
I don't think this will work out, but I'm kind of curious.

12:25.180 --> 12:26.180
Oh, no, I'm going to get four.

12:26.180 --> 12:27.180
I don't have room for four.

12:27.180 --> 12:28.180
Yes, you do.

12:30.180 --> 12:31.180
You need to get less peppers.

12:32.180 --> 12:33.180
No, no, there's...

12:33.180 --> 12:35.180
I had six at every plant last year.

12:35.180 --> 12:36.180
I'm getting four every plant this year.

12:37.180 --> 12:39.180
Sometimes, Naomi, your ideas are wrong.

12:40.180 --> 12:41.180
Sometimes I'm always right, and then you never...

12:41.180 --> 12:43.180
Sometimes I'm always right.

12:43.180 --> 12:44.180
Sometimes I'm always right.

12:44.180 --> 12:45.180
That means that it's not sometimes.

12:45.180 --> 12:46.180
Yeah, I know.

12:47.180 --> 12:48.180
It means that it's not always.

12:48.180 --> 12:49.180
I know.

12:49.180 --> 12:51.180
You are so mean to me.

12:51.180 --> 12:52.180
God dammit.

12:52.180 --> 12:54.180
You never can listen to my ideas.

12:54.180 --> 12:55.180
Okay, I'm going to do it right now, Naomi.

12:55.180 --> 12:56.180
Yeah.

12:57.180 --> 12:58.180
And then I'm going to yell at you later for it.

12:58.180 --> 12:59.180
Sure.

13:00.180 --> 13:01.180
I'll be right, so it doesn't matter.

13:01.180 --> 13:02.180
Yeah.

13:02.180 --> 13:03.180
Because I am always right.

13:03.180 --> 13:04.180
You're carrying them.
