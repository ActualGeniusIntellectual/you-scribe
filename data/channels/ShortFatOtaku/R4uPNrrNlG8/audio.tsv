0	10880	I still don't quite understand why they put roundabouts in, they just seem like unnecessarily
10880	11880	complicated.
11880	12880	Maybe I'm a boomer though.
12880	13880	You are a boomer.
13880	17720	We're on the way out of the city, we're going to go back to my hometown to visit my parents
17720	18720	for a little bit.
18720	20720	How do you feel about it Naomi?
20720	26320	We're going on a drive.
26320	27560	As you hit every bump.
27960	31160	It's not my fault that our city roads suck so damn hard.
31160	33960	Well we're technically out of the city now so you can't blame that.
33960	37480	No I can, see now they're nice.
37480	41160	We'll be gone for a little bit but we left Dave in charge of the garden, I'm sure he
41160	43160	won't screw it up.
43160	45160	Oh god.
45160	60360	Here's the garden update for the beginning of June, I just got back from a trip so it's
60360	63280	been a bit since I've seen this.
63280	68080	The lettuce is growing back after that first trim.
68080	71040	It grows pretty quick in a few more days we'll be able to have some.
71040	75960	Same with the spinach, that's already regrowing and the kale is starting to grow too except
75960	79360	for that one in the middle.
79360	83200	Of all the kale that I put in I accidentally stepped on that one really early in the growing
83200	84200	process.
84200	87280	Don't step on the plants Dev, I don't believe you.
87280	90960	I don't know if it's going to survive but it is like slowly getting there but all the
90960	94000	other kales as you can see they're all taking off.
94000	98120	All the peas are doing well except for that one that I said was pretty much dead.
98120	100180	Yeah it has actually failed.
100220	104220	It needs to be weeded and watered but otherwise it's going pretty good so far.
104220	106220	Oh no it's clover.
106220	107220	Gone with clover.
107220	110220	Clover is like a monster.
110220	112220	Did you have a clover?
112220	113220	I what?
113220	114220	I think you just dug it up.
114220	115220	I think I did.
115220	116220	But there was nothing there.
116220	118220	No it was growing back.
118220	120220	Oh sorry hun.
120220	121220	And now you're stepping on it.
121220	122220	Oh I definitely dug it up.
122220	126220	It was a big root and I was like what's it doing here?
126220	128220	Was it a pepper or a kale?
128220	129220	No it was a kale.
129260	132260	I thought the one that you stepped on and were pushing was that one.
132260	136260	Yeah that was the second one that just lost all of its leaves is what was coming back.
136260	138260	Okay well now it's not.
138260	139260	Uh huh.
139260	146220	Hey guys it is about 6 30 in the morning right now and we are in the middle of the first
146220	148420	heat wave and you know what?
148420	149420	It shows.
149420	150420	Check out the garden now.
150420	152620	I moved the lettuce to make sure it gets a little bit more sun.
152620	154660	Now did this one start to die?
154660	156540	Nope it's just the way it's opening up.
156540	158220	Okay everything's still fine with the lettuce.
158220	160140	We can probably cut that again soon.
160140	164460	The spinach's are regrowing though we still have that seed problem.
164460	168220	It keeps sprouting more seeds rather than leaves.
168220	170580	I don't know how we made a mistake.
170580	171940	The kale's doing very well.
171940	175100	The peppers are always a slow start and they haven't really done anything but I guess we'll
175100	176100	see.
176100	177300	The cucumbers are slowly making it.
177300	180620	The tomatoes have their first little flowers and check out the peas.
180620	184340	Yes the floppy pea died but the rest of them are going.
184340	185780	There is one thing that I want to try.
185820	192660	I remember hearing that if you take a pea plant and you snip the top of it, it will
192660	198020	grow wide and spend more time on growing pea pods than on growing leaves.
198020	201860	I'm going to do it with this one, maybe the shorter one here.
201860	204740	Because there's all the space in the middle from the dead plant.
204740	207660	If it doesn't work I mean I only lose one right?
208660	215740	I'll just snip it maybe here and maybe here as well.
215740	223900	I want to see if we can promote these plants to grow a bit wider rather than reaching to
223900	225860	the sky like last time.
225860	227180	Good morning everyone.
227180	229700	I'm about to do the weekly sip.
229700	236900	In fact I'll be late today on it, sorry, because I have to do some garden stuff first.
237340	245060	And yes it does mean in fact watering but it also means the first real harvest.
245060	247260	So let's get to it.
247260	251540	The lettuce has stagnated slightly but maybe cutting it will help because all these leaves
251540	252540	are good to eat again.
252540	257100	The spinach, I don't know how to do spinach I guess because no matter how often I prune
257100	261260	out the seeds they keep coming back and they're not growing leaves anymore.
261260	265460	I don't know but the kale is what we're here for.
266020	268020	Look at these huge leaves.
268020	270820	This kale has got to be snipped.
270820	279340	You go really deep in because the stalk is the healthiest part and just snip off each
279340	280340	one.
280340	286980	What I'll end up doing with this is I'll freeze a lot of it and eat it over the year because
286980	287980	kale is actually pretty expensive.
287980	290660	It's one of those hipster superfoods.
290660	293820	So you want to cut it to about this amount.
293820	294820	Maybe I can take this one off.
294820	298140	But basically you cut off most of the stalk so there's still enough leaf for the plant
298140	299140	to keep growing.
299140	302000	And there's the three bags of kale.
302000	304200	All the kale plants are nicely trimmed down.
304200	306460	As I pulled all the leaves off I noticed this.
306460	308900	This is that one kale that I stepped on like a month ago.
308900	311500	Don't step on the plants Dev.
311500	318020	And it was coming back it was slowly growing leaves but if you look really close it looks
318020	320220	like something's been eating the little leaves.
320220	321220	Maybe it won't make it.
321220	322500	Maybe that's two kale plants we've lost.
322500	323500	There's that one.
323500	326100	Then there's the one over there that Naomi accidentally pulled up.
326100	328100	But there's the three bags of kale that go in the freezer.
328100	331340	I don't know what to do with the spinach man.
331340	335860	I did my best to trim it as often as I could but I had to go away a bit.
335860	339820	And as soon as it started sprouting seeds it stopped sprouting leaves.
339820	343140	Like this one I trimmed a lot.
343140	345740	And still now it only grows seeds instead of leaves.
345740	348260	I just need to learn how to do spinach before I try that one again.
348260	349860	The rest of the garden's going well though.
349860	353620	There's some flowers coming in the peppers so that'll be nice soon.
353620	355980	The peas are looking excellent.
355980	356980	Look at all those peas over there.
356980	358580	You can actually start eating them.
358580	362540	Tomatoes are starting and the cucumbers have also recovered too.
362540	365700	So despite the failure of the spinach there still might be a good year.
365700	371120	So I looked it up or rather I had people chatters in the weekly sip help me and then I looked
371120	372120	it up.
372120	376420	Spinach can be very vulnerable to sudden temperature change or changes in the ground acidity.
376420	377420	Oh.
377980	380660	When a plant switches to reproductive growth it's called bolting.
380660	382100	Spinach wants to make seed when it's hot.
382100	383100	Yeah.
383100	388780	I have now learned that spinach stops producing leaves and starts basically only producing
388780	395320	seeds when the weather gets too hot or there's not enough water or some kind of stress and
395320	400620	that spinach is really only like a spring fall plant and that it's also very sensitive
400620	401620	to changes.
401620	406280	No matter how many seeds I snip these plants never coming back.
406720	407720	I can still eat those leaves.
407720	409840	They'll be a little bit bitter but I can still eat them, I don't care.
409840	414700	But in the light of that, man, I don't know if I ever want to do spinach again.
414700	415700	And you know what?
415700	420660	There's still at least like three months left for growing in this garden.
420660	422040	So you know what?
422040	424600	I think we might just pull the spinach out.
424600	426000	That was kind of a waste of money.
426000	429800	We didn't really get what we should have gotten out of it but you know whatever.
429800	431680	And we're going to put maybe more lettuce in there or something.
431680	432680	I don't know.
432680	433680	We'll figure it out.
434240	438000	Those plants will become tonight's dinner and I'll put something else in this spot.
438000	442280	Planting season's over, that's why it's all 50% off because it's so late in the season.
442280	446760	There's not many vegetables left and they are all reduced.
446760	450200	Our choices seem to be eggplant, which I'm not a fan of and I don't know if you like
450200	451200	it or not.
451200	452200	I've had it.
452200	453200	It's okay.
453200	454200	It's okay.
454200	455200	And Swiss chard.
455200	456200	It's like in a giant cheese dish.
456200	459440	Swiss chard is just like a little lettuce.
459440	461760	You grow it the same way, you eat it the same way.
461760	462760	Wait.
462840	463840	You're used to hot peppers.
463840	464840	No.
464840	465840	Why not?
465840	468520	If we're getting it you can only get one.
468520	469520	You don't want to?
469520	470520	No.
470520	471520	Beets?
471520	472520	No.
472520	473520	I don't like beets.
473520	474520	Really?
474520	475520	Why don't you like beets?
475520	477320	Do you have a study to back that up?
477320	478320	Yeah.
478320	481720	Yeah, I didn't like kohlrabi when I tried growing it a few years ago, like before I
481720	485920	was doing the videos and I didn't like how it tasted, I didn't like how slow it took
485920	486920	to grow.
486920	487920	I didn't like anything about it.
487920	488920	It was cherry tomatoes.
488920	489920	We love tomatoes though.
489920	490920	No.
491080	493080	I think at this point Swiss chard is probably the best bet.
493080	494080	Okay.
494080	496080	I have a second chance to spray you with one of these.
496080	497080	Pop off.
497080	501480	You know, I don't think in any growing season I've ever had to go back to the store
501480	502480	three times.
502480	504600	This is a unique experience for me.
504600	505600	And never this late.
505600	507600	How about this one?
507600	508600	That's okay.
508600	509600	That's okay.
509600	514080	It needs to go in now though, doesn't it?
514080	516080	They're all going to be off right now, you know?
516080	517080	No, I know.
517080	519520	Because you need to go outside.
520120	523520	Let's just take the two that you have and pray for the best.
523520	526640	Like with the cucumbers?
526640	528440	This garden is fucked this year.
528440	529440	Yep.
529440	532040	Actually, you can plant a palm tree if you want.
532040	533040	Why?
533040	536840	Alright, we're back home with the chard.
536840	540680	Now those plants come out and the chard goes in.
540680	552720	Okay, so whatever good leaves remain on those spinach plants, as well as all the lettuce
552720	555720	I just cut up, that's going to be tonight's dinner.
555720	556720	Okay, Naomi.
556720	557720	Here's the spinach.
557720	558720	Why?
558720	561720	Because you've got to cut it up.
561720	570240	The soil went right in my mouth.
570240	571480	Good morning, guys.
571480	573960	It's time to harvest the peas.
573960	575520	Look at how many peas there are.
575520	579440	I cut some scissors out just in case, but I think I can just pull them off.
579440	582440	I don't want to damage the plant.
582440	586440	I can kind of just pull them off.
586440	587440	Mmm.
587440	588440	And they're pretty good too.
588440	593960	I'm supposed to take these for a salad for this afternoon, but I might just...
593960	596320	Oh, this one was not coming off that easily.
596320	597720	Maybe I should use the scissors.
597720	600680	I feel like I might just sit here and eat them though, because they're actually really
600680	601680	good.
601680	602680	Yeah, man.
602680	603680	Look at that.
603680	604680	That's really good.
604680	610920	I was a little worried about the lettuce for a while, but since I last snipped, you can
610920	613720	see they are all coming back.
613720	619200	There's just some dead leaves in the bottom, but the actual plants still seem to be doing
619200	620200	okay.
620200	622520	They're growing a bit more slowly, but as long as they keep coming back, we should be
622520	623520	able to keep eating it.
623520	624520	Here's the replacement chard.
624520	628320	Yeah, those few dead leaves in the bottom died, but the actual bunch of it was looking
628320	630120	pretty good for both of them.
630120	632440	I guess if we just keep watering it, it'll be okay.
632440	633440	And the kale.
633440	634440	Kale grows like crazy.
634440	635440	Look it.
635440	638160	I trimmed these a couple weeks ago, and there's already some pretty decent leaves here.
638160	641560	I'll still wait a couple weeks before I trim any more out of this.
641560	646040	If you look closely at some of the pepper blooms, they are in fact turning into the
646040	647500	beginnings of peppers.
647500	648500	That's nice.
648500	652260	No word yet on the tomatoes or cucumbers, though the cucumbers are beginning to climb
652260	653260	up the lattice.
653260	655220	I think I have to redirect that one over there.
655220	657620	This one here is trying to climb onto the tomato plant.
657620	659460	That's no good.
659460	661460	Let's pull it.
661460	663860	Come on.
663860	665940	Let's pull them this way.
665940	669020	I want it to climb up this lattice in the back.
669020	674060	People keep telling me to take off what they call suckers on tomato plants, and I think
674060	675120	it's these.
675120	679600	It's a little growth in between the branches of the plant, so rather than growing more
679600	682580	branches it doesn't need, it can instead grow the tomatoes.
682580	688580	So to be fair some suckers, like in the case of this one here, actually grew tomato flower,
688580	690500	so maybe I shouldn't pull off all of them.
690500	691500	And there we go.
691500	696740	I didn't get nearly all of them, of course, but that is more than enough for a lunch salad,
696740	699180	and when I need more tomorrow I'll come out and get more tomorrow.
699180	704200	At this point there will probably be less garden updates because all of the garden opening
704200	707220	shenanigans are basically over.
707220	710180	This is probably the roughest garden that we've had to ever open.
710180	715020	Usually we just buy the plants and put them in and it's not a big deal, but this time
715020	719580	we had multiple things happening that got in the way.
719580	724100	But at this point there's no shopping, there's no planting left, it's all just going to be
724100	730700	watering, harvesting, and the occasional weeding until it's time to close up the garden in
730700	731700	the fall.
731700	734500	So I guess the next time you'll see the garden will be in the fall.
734500	738420	It was really annoying to have to deal with all of the stuff we dealt with this year to
738420	743020	get the garden started, but it did provide for three videos worth of content.
743020	744820	I hope it turns out well this year.
744820	757900	I think it will.
757900	761700	Hey guys, quick addendum, I'm recording this just off the cuff.
761700	768300	I watered it only an hour or two ago, and look at the growth already.
769180	774020	I don't know if you can see because of the sun, the sun's up now, but everything grew
774020	778660	a bunch just with water and sun in like two hours.
778660	780020	That's crazy, man.
780020	784260	Anyway, everything that's in is now in I think, there's going to be no more plant swapping
784260	786140	around or buying anything new.
786140	790860	I think we are now set, and so you'll see me when it's time to harvest.
790860	793820	Okay, say goodbye to the garden, Naomi.
793820	794820	Bye, garden.
794820	796260	See you next time.
796260	802580	So it's the night of July 1st, Naomi and I are walking to the Canada Day celebration
802580	803580	right now.
803580	806260	And yes, that was the last we'll see of the garden for this year, at least for a little
806260	807260	while.
807260	809340	Not because the garden's going anywhere, obviously.
809340	813140	In terms of setting up, this is pretty much it, because usually it only takes us one video
813140	815300	worth, this year it took us three.
815300	818940	So happy Canada Day everyone, we'll see you next time.
818940	820060	Goodbye.
