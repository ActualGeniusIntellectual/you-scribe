1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,880
I still don't quite understand why they put roundabouts in, they just seem like unnecessarily

2
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:11,880
complicated.

3
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:12,880
Maybe I'm a boomer though.

4
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:13,880
You are a boomer.

5
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:17,720
We're on the way out of the city, we're going to go back to my hometown to visit my parents

6
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:18,720
for a little bit.

7
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:20,720
How do you feel about it Naomi?

8
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:26,320
We're going on a drive.

9
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:27,560
As you hit every bump.

10
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:31,160
It's not my fault that our city roads suck so damn hard.

11
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:33,960
Well we're technically out of the city now so you can't blame that.

12
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:37,480
No I can, see now they're nice.

13
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:41,160
We'll be gone for a little bit but we left Dave in charge of the garden, I'm sure he

14
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:43,160
won't screw it up.

15
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:45,160
Oh god.

16
00:00:45,160 --> 00:01:00,360
Here's the garden update for the beginning of June, I just got back from a trip so it's

17
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:03,280
been a bit since I've seen this.

18
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:08,080
The lettuce is growing back after that first trim.

19
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:11,040
It grows pretty quick in a few more days we'll be able to have some.

20
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:15,960
Same with the spinach, that's already regrowing and the kale is starting to grow too except

21
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:19,360
for that one in the middle.

22
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:23,200
Of all the kale that I put in I accidentally stepped on that one really early in the growing

23
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,200
process.

24
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:27,280
Don't step on the plants Dev, I don't believe you.

25
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:30,960
I don't know if it's going to survive but it is like slowly getting there but all the

26
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:34,000
other kales as you can see they're all taking off.

27
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,120
All the peas are doing well except for that one that I said was pretty much dead.

28
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:40,180
Yeah it has actually failed.

29
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:44,220
It needs to be weeded and watered but otherwise it's going pretty good so far.

30
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:46,220
Oh no it's clover.

31
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:47,220
Gone with clover.

32
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:50,220
Clover is like a monster.

33
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:52,220
Did you have a clover?

34
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:53,220
I what?

35
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:54,220
I think you just dug it up.

36
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:55,220
I think I did.

37
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:56,220
But there was nothing there.

38
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:58,220
No it was growing back.

39
00:01:58,220 --> 00:02:00,220
Oh sorry hun.

40
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:01,220
And now you're stepping on it.

41
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:02,220
Oh I definitely dug it up.

42
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:06,220
It was a big root and I was like what's it doing here?

43
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:08,220
Was it a pepper or a kale?

44
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:09,220
No it was a kale.

45
00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:12,260
I thought the one that you stepped on and were pushing was that one.

46
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:16,260
Yeah that was the second one that just lost all of its leaves is what was coming back.

47
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:18,260
Okay well now it's not.

48
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:19,260
Uh huh.

49
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:26,220
Hey guys it is about 6 30 in the morning right now and we are in the middle of the first

50
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:28,420
heat wave and you know what?

51
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:29,420
It shows.

52
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:30,420
Check out the garden now.

53
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:32,620
I moved the lettuce to make sure it gets a little bit more sun.

54
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:34,660
Now did this one start to die?

55
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:36,540
Nope it's just the way it's opening up.

56
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:38,220
Okay everything's still fine with the lettuce.

57
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:40,140
We can probably cut that again soon.

58
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:44,460
The spinach's are regrowing though we still have that seed problem.

59
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:48,220
It keeps sprouting more seeds rather than leaves.

60
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:50,580
I don't know how we made a mistake.

61
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:51,940
The kale's doing very well.

62
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:55,100
The peppers are always a slow start and they haven't really done anything but I guess we'll

63
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:56,100
see.

64
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:57,300
The cucumbers are slowly making it.

65
00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:00,620
The tomatoes have their first little flowers and check out the peas.

66
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:04,340
Yes the floppy pea died but the rest of them are going.

67
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:05,780
There is one thing that I want to try.

68
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:12,660
I remember hearing that if you take a pea plant and you snip the top of it, it will

69
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:18,020
grow wide and spend more time on growing pea pods than on growing leaves.

70
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:21,860
I'm going to do it with this one, maybe the shorter one here.

71
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:24,740
Because there's all the space in the middle from the dead plant.

72
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:27,660
If it doesn't work I mean I only lose one right?

73
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:35,740
I'll just snip it maybe here and maybe here as well.

74
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:43,900
I want to see if we can promote these plants to grow a bit wider rather than reaching to

75
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:45,860
the sky like last time.

76
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:47,180
Good morning everyone.

77
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:49,700
I'm about to do the weekly sip.

78
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:56,900
In fact I'll be late today on it, sorry, because I have to do some garden stuff first.

79
00:03:57,340 --> 00:04:05,060
And yes it does mean in fact watering but it also means the first real harvest.

80
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:07,260
So let's get to it.

81
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:11,540
The lettuce has stagnated slightly but maybe cutting it will help because all these leaves

82
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:12,540
are good to eat again.

83
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:17,100
The spinach, I don't know how to do spinach I guess because no matter how often I prune

84
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:21,260
out the seeds they keep coming back and they're not growing leaves anymore.

85
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:25,460
I don't know but the kale is what we're here for.

86
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:28,020
Look at these huge leaves.

87
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:30,820
This kale has got to be snipped.

88
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:39,340
You go really deep in because the stalk is the healthiest part and just snip off each

89
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:40,340
one.

90
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:46,980
What I'll end up doing with this is I'll freeze a lot of it and eat it over the year because

91
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:47,980
kale is actually pretty expensive.

92
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:50,660
It's one of those hipster superfoods.

93
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:53,820
So you want to cut it to about this amount.

94
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:54,820
Maybe I can take this one off.

95
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:58,140
But basically you cut off most of the stalk so there's still enough leaf for the plant

96
00:04:58,140 --> 00:04:59,140
to keep growing.

97
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:02,000
And there's the three bags of kale.

98
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,200
All the kale plants are nicely trimmed down.

99
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:06,460
As I pulled all the leaves off I noticed this.

100
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:08,900
This is that one kale that I stepped on like a month ago.

101
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:11,500
Don't step on the plants Dev.

102
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:18,020
And it was coming back it was slowly growing leaves but if you look really close it looks

103
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:20,220
like something's been eating the little leaves.

104
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:21,220
Maybe it won't make it.

105
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:22,500
Maybe that's two kale plants we've lost.

106
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:23,500
There's that one.

107
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:26,100
Then there's the one over there that Naomi accidentally pulled up.

108
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:28,100
But there's the three bags of kale that go in the freezer.

109
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:31,340
I don't know what to do with the spinach man.

110
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:35,860
I did my best to trim it as often as I could but I had to go away a bit.

111
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:39,820
And as soon as it started sprouting seeds it stopped sprouting leaves.

112
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:43,140
Like this one I trimmed a lot.

113
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:45,740
And still now it only grows seeds instead of leaves.

114
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:48,260
I just need to learn how to do spinach before I try that one again.

115
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:49,860
The rest of the garden's going well though.

116
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:53,620
There's some flowers coming in the peppers so that'll be nice soon.

117
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:55,980
The peas are looking excellent.

118
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:56,980
Look at all those peas over there.

119
00:05:56,980 --> 00:05:58,580
You can actually start eating them.

120
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:02,540
Tomatoes are starting and the cucumbers have also recovered too.

121
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:05,700
So despite the failure of the spinach there still might be a good year.

122
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:11,120
So I looked it up or rather I had people chatters in the weekly sip help me and then I looked

123
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,120
it up.

124
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:16,420
Spinach can be very vulnerable to sudden temperature change or changes in the ground acidity.

125
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:17,420
Oh.

126
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:20,660
When a plant switches to reproductive growth it's called bolting.

127
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:22,100
Spinach wants to make seed when it's hot.

128
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:23,100
Yeah.

129
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:28,780
I have now learned that spinach stops producing leaves and starts basically only producing

130
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:35,320
seeds when the weather gets too hot or there's not enough water or some kind of stress and

131
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:40,620
that spinach is really only like a spring fall plant and that it's also very sensitive

132
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:41,620
to changes.

133
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:46,280
No matter how many seeds I snip these plants never coming back.

134
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:47,720
I can still eat those leaves.

135
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,840
They'll be a little bit bitter but I can still eat them, I don't care.

136
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:54,700
But in the light of that, man, I don't know if I ever want to do spinach again.

137
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:55,700
And you know what?

138
00:06:55,700 --> 00:07:00,660
There's still at least like three months left for growing in this garden.

139
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:02,040
So you know what?

140
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:04,600
I think we might just pull the spinach out.

141
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,000
That was kind of a waste of money.

142
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,800
We didn't really get what we should have gotten out of it but you know whatever.

143
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,680
And we're going to put maybe more lettuce in there or something.

144
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:12,680
I don't know.

145
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:13,680
We'll figure it out.

146
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:18,000
Those plants will become tonight's dinner and I'll put something else in this spot.

147
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,280
Planting season's over, that's why it's all 50% off because it's so late in the season.

148
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:26,760
There's not many vegetables left and they are all reduced.

149
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:30,200
Our choices seem to be eggplant, which I'm not a fan of and I don't know if you like

150
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,200
it or not.

151
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,200
I've had it.

152
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,200
It's okay.

153
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:34,200
It's okay.

154
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,200
And Swiss chard.

155
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,200
It's like in a giant cheese dish.

156
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:39,440
Swiss chard is just like a little lettuce.

157
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,760
You grow it the same way, you eat it the same way.

158
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:42,760
Wait.

159
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:43,840
You're used to hot peppers.

160
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:44,840
No.

161
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:45,840
Why not?

162
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,520
If we're getting it you can only get one.

163
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:49,520
You don't want to?

164
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:50,520
No.

165
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:51,520
Beets?

166
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:52,520
No.

167
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:53,520
I don't like beets.

168
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:54,520
Really?

169
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:55,520
Why don't you like beets?

170
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:57,320
Do you have a study to back that up?

171
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:58,320
Yeah.

172
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:01,720
Yeah, I didn't like kohlrabi when I tried growing it a few years ago, like before I

173
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:05,920
was doing the videos and I didn't like how it tasted, I didn't like how slow it took

174
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:06,920
to grow.

175
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:07,920
I didn't like anything about it.

176
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:08,920
It was cherry tomatoes.

177
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:09,920
We love tomatoes though.

178
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:10,920
No.

179
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:13,080
I think at this point Swiss chard is probably the best bet.

180
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:14,080
Okay.

181
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:16,080
I have a second chance to spray you with one of these.

182
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,080
Pop off.

183
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:21,480
You know, I don't think in any growing season I've ever had to go back to the store

184
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:22,480
three times.

185
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:24,600
This is a unique experience for me.

186
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:25,600
And never this late.

187
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,600
How about this one?

188
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:28,600
That's okay.

189
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:29,600
That's okay.

190
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:34,080
It needs to go in now though, doesn't it?

191
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,080
They're all going to be off right now, you know?

192
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,080
No, I know.

193
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:39,520
Because you need to go outside.

194
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:43,520
Let's just take the two that you have and pray for the best.

195
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:46,640
Like with the cucumbers?

196
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,440
This garden is fucked this year.

197
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:49,440
Yep.

198
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:52,040
Actually, you can plant a palm tree if you want.

199
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:53,040
Why?

200
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:56,840
Alright, we're back home with the chard.

201
00:08:56,840 --> 00:09:00,680
Now those plants come out and the chard goes in.

202
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:12,720
Okay, so whatever good leaves remain on those spinach plants, as well as all the lettuce

203
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:15,720
I just cut up, that's going to be tonight's dinner.

204
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:16,720
Okay, Naomi.

205
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:17,720
Here's the spinach.

206
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:18,720
Why?

207
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:21,720
Because you've got to cut it up.

208
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:30,240
The soil went right in my mouth.

209
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,480
Good morning, guys.

210
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:33,960
It's time to harvest the peas.

211
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,520
Look at how many peas there are.

212
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:39,440
I cut some scissors out just in case, but I think I can just pull them off.

213
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:42,440
I don't want to damage the plant.

214
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:46,440
I can kind of just pull them off.

215
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:47,440
Mmm.

216
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,440
And they're pretty good too.

217
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:53,960
I'm supposed to take these for a salad for this afternoon, but I might just...

218
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:56,320
Oh, this one was not coming off that easily.

219
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,720
Maybe I should use the scissors.

220
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:00,680
I feel like I might just sit here and eat them though, because they're actually really

221
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:01,680
good.

222
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:02,680
Yeah, man.

223
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:03,680
Look at that.

224
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:04,680
That's really good.

225
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:10,920
I was a little worried about the lettuce for a while, but since I last snipped, you can

226
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:13,720
see they are all coming back.

227
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:19,200
There's just some dead leaves in the bottom, but the actual plants still seem to be doing

228
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,200
okay.

229
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:22,520
They're growing a bit more slowly, but as long as they keep coming back, we should be

230
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:23,520
able to keep eating it.

231
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:24,520
Here's the replacement chard.

232
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:28,320
Yeah, those few dead leaves in the bottom died, but the actual bunch of it was looking

233
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,120
pretty good for both of them.

234
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:32,440
I guess if we just keep watering it, it'll be okay.

235
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:33,440
And the kale.

236
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,440
Kale grows like crazy.

237
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:35,440
Look it.

238
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:38,160
I trimmed these a couple weeks ago, and there's already some pretty decent leaves here.

239
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:41,560
I'll still wait a couple weeks before I trim any more out of this.

240
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:46,040
If you look closely at some of the pepper blooms, they are in fact turning into the

241
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:47,500
beginnings of peppers.

242
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:48,500
That's nice.

243
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:52,260
No word yet on the tomatoes or cucumbers, though the cucumbers are beginning to climb

244
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:53,260
up the lattice.

245
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:55,220
I think I have to redirect that one over there.

246
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:57,620
This one here is trying to climb onto the tomato plant.

247
00:10:57,620 --> 00:10:59,460
That's no good.

248
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:01,460
Let's pull it.

249
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:03,860
Come on.

250
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:05,940
Let's pull them this way.

251
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:09,020
I want it to climb up this lattice in the back.

252
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:14,060
People keep telling me to take off what they call suckers on tomato plants, and I think

253
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:15,120
it's these.

254
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:19,600
It's a little growth in between the branches of the plant, so rather than growing more

255
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:22,580
branches it doesn't need, it can instead grow the tomatoes.

256
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:28,580
So to be fair some suckers, like in the case of this one here, actually grew tomato flower,

257
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:30,500
so maybe I shouldn't pull off all of them.

258
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:31,500
And there we go.

259
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:36,740
I didn't get nearly all of them, of course, but that is more than enough for a lunch salad,

260
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:39,180
and when I need more tomorrow I'll come out and get more tomorrow.

261
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:44,200
At this point there will probably be less garden updates because all of the garden opening

262
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:47,220
shenanigans are basically over.

263
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:50,180
This is probably the roughest garden that we've had to ever open.

264
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:55,020
Usually we just buy the plants and put them in and it's not a big deal, but this time

265
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:59,580
we had multiple things happening that got in the way.

266
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:04,100
But at this point there's no shopping, there's no planting left, it's all just going to be

267
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:10,700
watering, harvesting, and the occasional weeding until it's time to close up the garden in

268
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:11,700
the fall.

269
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:14,500
So I guess the next time you'll see the garden will be in the fall.

270
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:18,420
It was really annoying to have to deal with all of the stuff we dealt with this year to

271
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:23,020
get the garden started, but it did provide for three videos worth of content.

272
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:24,820
I hope it turns out well this year.

273
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:37,900
I think it will.

274
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:41,700
Hey guys, quick addendum, I'm recording this just off the cuff.

275
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:48,300
I watered it only an hour or two ago, and look at the growth already.

276
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:54,020
I don't know if you can see because of the sun, the sun's up now, but everything grew

277
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:58,660
a bunch just with water and sun in like two hours.

278
00:12:58,660 --> 00:13:00,020
That's crazy, man.

279
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:04,260
Anyway, everything that's in is now in I think, there's going to be no more plant swapping

280
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:06,140
around or buying anything new.

281
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:10,860
I think we are now set, and so you'll see me when it's time to harvest.

282
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:13,820
Okay, say goodbye to the garden, Naomi.

283
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:14,820
Bye, garden.

284
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:16,260
See you next time.

285
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:22,580
So it's the night of July 1st, Naomi and I are walking to the Canada Day celebration

286
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:23,580
right now.

287
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:26,260
And yes, that was the last we'll see of the garden for this year, at least for a little

288
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:27,260
while.

289
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:29,340
Not because the garden's going anywhere, obviously.

290
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:33,140
In terms of setting up, this is pretty much it, because usually it only takes us one video

291
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:35,300
worth, this year it took us three.

292
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:38,940
So happy Canada Day everyone, we'll see you next time.

293
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:40,060
Goodbye.

294
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:41,100
Bye.

295
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:52,380
See you next time.

296
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:53,380
Bye.

297
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:54,380
Bye.

298
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:54,400
Bye.
