1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,640
You're probably looking at the title of this video and thinking, what the hell, Dev,

2
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:09,640
what's this all about?

3
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:12,040
Obviously, we all know what a purity spiral is.

4
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:17,080
It's a social ratchet effect within a community, a process of moral outbidding unchecked which

5
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:21,440
corrodes the group from within, rewarding those who put themselves at the extremes and

6
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:23,400
punishing nuance relentlessly.

7
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:24,840
At least that's what's on an urban dictionary.

8
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:27,760
There's no Wikipedia page in the concept, and you'd think there would be.

9
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:31,640
Not to be confused with virtue signaling, woke culture, or online mobs.

10
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:35,500
A purity spiral can contain all of those things, but it's defined by the fact that it takes

11
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:40,880
place in a defined community or society where being purer than thou is always being rewarded

12
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:45,680
and holding a divergent, less pure opinion is normally punished, a dynamic which leads

13
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:48,960
to an inevitable escalation, as only the most extreme can win.

14
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:50,660
This is a pretty good definition, actually.

15
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:54,720
It could be anything from Mao's Red Guard to neo-Nazis to the Crucible, that's a play

16
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:56,840
about witch hunts, to Instagram knitting.

17
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:00,600
That's a reference to an article about how, back in 2020, an online knitting group got

18
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:05,080
radicalized towards leftist politics, because of that tired mantra, everything's political.

19
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:07,840
An event that began the prominence of Karlyn Borisenko.

20
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:12,000
If you've been plugged into internet politics since gamergate, like me, purity spiral is

21
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,620
probably a term you've picked up and mastered long ago.

22
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:16,920
We all know what it is, and we can all see one when it happens.

23
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:21,000
And if you're honest, you'll accept that any political camp, any group at all, is capable

24
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
of a purity spiral.

25
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,040
Though I do know that right now, they're commonly attributed to the left.

26
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:26,040
And with good reason.

27
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:28,680
The fate of Trotsky at the hands of Stalin after the death of Lenin.

28
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:31,640
The fate of the Gang of Four at the hands of Hua Guofeng.

29
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:35,060
And soon after, Guofeng at the hands of Deng Xiaoping after the death of Mao.

30
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:37,720
The terror under Rob Speer, which eventually took his own head.

31
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:42,140
There is an impulse embedded deep within the left to strive for ideological purity.

32
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:45,640
If you believe that you are truly creating the perfect society, if your goals are just

33
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:49,760
that righteous, it becomes easy to view people not as pure in their convictions as you, as

34
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:50,760
lesser than.

35
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:55,600
But it also becomes easy to commit horrible acts as you strive for that utopian vision.

36
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:58,840
But purity spirals are not the exclusive domain of the left.

37
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:02,700
Religious puritanism and ethno-nationalism contain similar impulses, and those examples

38
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:06,080
are so well known that I don't think I need to list them.

39
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:10,200
In terms of the online sphere, we're currently seeing the final destruction of two political

40
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:11,840
communities due to purity spirals.

41
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,240
Firstly, BreadTube is basically gone.

42
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:16,780
It's shattered, broken, destroyed by its own infighting.

43
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:20,680
For a long time, they were emboldened in their advocacy against Trump during the 2020 election,

44
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:21,680
so that's done now.

45
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:24,900
At the same time, they were all united in their hate of destiny, somebody who considers

46
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:28,700
himself as being on the left, even though he vehemently rejects socialism.

47
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:30,400
But destiny is now banned from Twitch.

48
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:34,040
So isolated within the decaying husk of a once vibrant movement, they began to turn

49
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:37,920
on each other, fighting over drama and clout, self-destructing in the process.

50
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:42,080
Secondly, Lauren Southern just put the final nail in the coffin of the dissident right,

51
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,080
as she puts it.

52
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:47,140
In a nearly three-hour video describing all of the worst excesses of every prominent online

53
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:50,620
right-leaning figure she'd ever had the displeasure of working with, Paul Joseph Watson,

54
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:54,640
Israel Levant, Faith Goldie, Milo, Tommy Robinson, and how after the money and clout

55
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:58,800
began to dry up, they rapidly turned on each other, and her, in order to get ahead.

56
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:02,580
The only person she had nothing bad to say about was Stefan Molyneux, which surprised

57
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:03,580
me, frankly.

58
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:05,740
I always thought there was something a little bit off about him, but hey, I'm happy to

59
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:06,740
be wrong.

60
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:09,100
Purity spirals are clearly a destructive element within a community.

61
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:12,480
If your group suffers from one, you're on a downhill trajectory, fast.

62
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:16,720
Your group will stop being about its purpose, and morph into being about its prominent members,

63
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:19,300
until everything of value has been sucked out of it.

64
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:21,960
So why do purity spirals keep happening?

65
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:24,140
Do they actually serve a purpose?

66
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:29,440
I mean, from an evolutionary standpoint, strictly, I know we evolve tribal tendencies for survival

67
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:33,160
purposes, but purity spirals seems to completely undermine that impulse.

68
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:37,400
I have no idea what the answer to this question is, but I've had a few thoughts over the

69
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:39,500
past couple months that I want to share with you.

70
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:44,440
Let's assume that, for the sake of extreme simplicity, there are only five moral questions.

71
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:46,200
We'll label them one to five.

72
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:51,260
And there are only two possible answers to each question, A and B. All in all, ten total

73
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:52,740
moral positions.

74
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:56,580
Now assume a person who believes that the moral answer to all five questions is A. So

75
00:03:56,580 --> 00:04:00,500
to him, all five As are moral, and all five Bs are immoral.

76
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:04,740
Within his domain, the five As are allowed, and the five Bs are banned.

77
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:07,720
Five of the total of ten possible moral positions are permitted.

78
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:11,540
Now let's assume a second person, who believes that the moral answer to the first four questions

79
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:15,780
is A, but the moral answer to question five is B. If they come into contact with each

80
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:17,300
other, they have three choices.

81
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:20,960
One is to just remain separate, two is to go to war over their different moral opinion

82
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:23,600
on question five, and three is to live and let live.

83
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:27,320
In other words, the first person, despite his moral compass telling him to ban five

84
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:31,620
B, permits the second person to indulge in five B. And the second person, despite his

85
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:36,320
moral compass telling him to ban five A, permits the first person to indulge in five A, for

86
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,760
the sake of peace.

87
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:41,960
In a society where only the first person existed, there were five permitted moral positions

88
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:43,500
and five banned ones.

89
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:47,460
But in a society where these two people have chosen to coexist, there's now six permitted

90
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:49,820
moral positions and four banned ones.

91
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:53,240
That's what tolerance ultimately is, when you allow other people to do things that you

92
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:56,460
personally view as immoral, but don't have a direct stake in.

93
00:04:56,460 --> 00:05:00,800
Now imagine a society that is filled with people, such that at least one person believes

94
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,060
in each of the ten possible positions.

95
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:07,160
In order to take into account everybody's morality, such a society would have no moral

96
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,320
prescriptions.

97
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:12,960
This is ultimately why people who preach open-ended tolerance end up defending the worst crimes,

98
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,800
and preventing pedophilia, even if they're not pedophiles themselves.

99
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:19,140
Because tolerance demands that they take into account the pedophile's moral position in

100
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:21,260
their calculations of a universal morality.

101
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:25,280
The morality is universalized in that it tolerates all individuals within it, and allows each

102
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:27,820
of them to follow their positive moral impulses.

103
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:32,220
But necessarily it also has no advice to give anybody on what they shouldn't do, because,

104
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:36,000
to steal a phrase, nothing is true, everything is permitted.

105
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,620
Postmodernism is therefore the end result of our attempts to craft a universal morality

106
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:42,640
that takes into account every single human's desires.

107
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:46,040
But frankly, I personally don't think I need to consider the point of view of the pedophile

108
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,860
when I'm figuring out my own moral code.

109
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:51,620
This process is the opposite of the purity spiral, and it's equally destructive.

110
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:54,880
While purity spiraling destroys communities from within, rotting them at the core until

111
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:59,960
there's nothing left, and expelling most people out, universalizing morality castrates a community,

112
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:04,680
rendering it unable to take any action lest one of the many individuals within it object.

113
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:08,520
Consider Antifa, they're a particularly radical section of the left that has destroyed property,

114
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:10,380
assaulted people, even killed people on occasion.

115
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:14,100
They are certainly the result of a purity spiral, and we have seen many people leave

116
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:15,300
the left in response.

117
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:17,020
But has that weakened the left?

118
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:21,060
I mean, it kinda has, but not nearly as much as we all thought it would, say five years

119
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:22,060
ago.

120
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:25,540
Antifa has been allowed to run roughshod over civil society for nearly a fucking decade

121
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:28,540
at this point, every time something happens that they don't like.

122
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:32,440
Purity spiraling has indeed stripped the left of a lot of its moral legitimacy in the eyes

123
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:33,560
of unaligned people.

124
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:37,920
It makes them out to be hypocrites and thugs, and it makes exiles the more lukewarm members.

125
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:41,840
But even as the left is saddled with these weaknesses, purity spiraling also generates

126
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:43,160
some strength for them.

127
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,960
The overtone window shifts leftward.

128
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:49,160
The national conversation is about something more extreme, closer to the radicals' desires.

129
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:51,880
Dissidents are weeded out to prevent them from causing trouble, and instead those dissidents

130
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:55,760
join the enemy's camp, broadening and therefore weakening their moral prescriptions in the

131
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:58,680
process, while the radicals' morals become more focused.

132
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:02,960
Suddenly, your enemy is more willing to compromise, as your former moderate positions have become

133
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:03,960
theirs.

134
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:08,520
The violent, uncompromising sect of the most radical individuals may isolate your movement

135
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:11,920
from the wider culture, but it's also a method by which concessions are extracted.

136
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:15,280
I heard in a recent video, I think it was from Jordan Peterson, that the estimated number

137
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:17,200
of Antifa members is actually quite small.

138
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:23,360
It does not take that many free riders or criminals or people who simply just don't

139
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:30,200
care and who would just as soon see everything burn to radically destabilize complex social

140
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,200
organizations.

141
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:38,680
I spoke recently with a journalist, Andy Ngo, about the anarchist group, Antifa, for example.

142
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:45,080
After being informed by some Democrats I was corresponding with that this group, Antifa,

143
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:51,200
didn't really exist, I didn't know what they meant until I asked Andy how many truly

144
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:57,840
active Antifa cells he thought existed in the US and how many active full-time equivalent

145
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:00,680
members each cell might have.

146
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:08,200
He thought 40 cells with 20 members each.

147
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:11,080
That's 800.

148
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:16,280
All that damage from 800 anarchists.

149
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:19,040
That's the Pareto principle.

150
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:24,620
A small number of agents in any organization or its equivalent pull all the weight.

151
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:28,300
And look at the change they have forced from the silent majority that just wants them to

152
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:29,300
go away.

153
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:32,940
In a sense, purity spirals are simultaneously how the left has destroyed itself and at the

154
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:34,820
same time how it's pushed its agenda.

155
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:39,140
And I think the right is getting wise to this and has begun doing the same thing on their

156
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:40,140
end.

157
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:42,540
Here's the issue though, just because this is an effective short-term strategy doesn't

158
00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:46,580
mean I actually think it's good for society, nor do I think it unearths any sort of actual

159
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:47,580
truth.

160
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:48,580
Quite the opposite actually.

161
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:51,520
This is where you get people who are happy to disregard the truth, shredding the social

162
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:54,140
fabric all the while for political expediency.

163
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:56,880
We're just barely hanging on with the left doing this.

164
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:59,640
There's no way we'll make it out if the right starts doing it too.

165
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:02,480
And yeah, I've been in my comment sections for the past few videos.

166
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,100
The right absolutely does it too.

167
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:08,400
There's at least a very vocal minority of people angry with me that I don't blindly

168
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:11,080
ideologically agree with every single view that they hold.

169
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:15,060
And how it's somehow a betrayal or a leftward drift or whatever other nonsense because they

170
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:16,840
found me attacking the left.

171
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:18,520
So why am I attacking the right too?

172
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:20,800
My brother in Christ, I am a centrist.

173
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:24,200
I'm a classical liberal and I have been for many years.

174
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:28,000
Maybe you need to consider that if my logic sounds based and amazing when I'm critiquing

175
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,220
the left, but cucked and idiotic when I'm critiquing the right, that the problem might

176
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:33,200
actually be your view of the world.

177
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:36,400
But if you're part of a purity spiral, you probably won't actually consider that.

178
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:38,000
By the way, I'm fine with rightoids watching me.

179
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,280
I'm also fine with leftoids watching me too.

180
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:41,440
This is still a free speech zone at the end of the day.

181
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:44,440
You can tell me how wrong you think I am in the comments and I will tell you how wrong

182
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:45,880
I think you are in the videos.

183
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:49,920
But I reject the radicalism, the purity spiraling from any and all sides.

184
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:52,920
And I have no time for the tears of people who thought that I was one of them.

185
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:53,920
I'm not a rightist.

186
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,400
I'm also not a leftist.

187
00:09:55,400 --> 00:10:01,040
Even if purity spiraling can be a solid short-term strategy, I think it destroys everything if

188
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,040
you engage in it.

189
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:03,180
There's a better way.

190
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:05,280
And that better way is what centrists do.

191
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:08,320
I don't need to expel people in order to bolster my ideology.

192
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:11,880
Nor do I need to extract concessions through extremism or negotiate with others who try

193
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:13,020
to extract them from me.

194
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:15,000
I don't need to compromise with subversives.

195
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,860
I don't need to engage in motte and baileys or respect that tactic when used by others.

196
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:21,080
I don't need to dog whistle, nor do I react to them.

197
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,080
I don't need to care about optics.

198
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,240
It's not like I have a reputation to uphold.

199
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,560
At the end of the day, the truth is the truth.

200
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:30,040
And it forms the best defense that we have against radicalism.

201
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:31,960
The truth is incontrovertible.

202
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:35,600
If you're a radical and you're wrong, no amount of further radicalism would convince me to

203
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,700
do anything other than oppose you.

204
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:38,200
Why would it?
