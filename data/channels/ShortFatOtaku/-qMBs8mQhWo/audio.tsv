0	8640	You're probably looking at the title of this video and thinking, what the hell, Dev,
8640	9640	what's this all about?
9640	12040	Obviously, we all know what a purity spiral is.
12040	17080	It's a social ratchet effect within a community, a process of moral outbidding unchecked which
17080	21440	corrodes the group from within, rewarding those who put themselves at the extremes and
21440	23400	punishing nuance relentlessly.
23400	24840	At least that's what's on an urban dictionary.
24840	27760	There's no Wikipedia page in the concept, and you'd think there would be.
27760	31640	Not to be confused with virtue signaling, woke culture, or online mobs.
31640	35500	A purity spiral can contain all of those things, but it's defined by the fact that it takes
35500	40880	place in a defined community or society where being purer than thou is always being rewarded
40880	45680	and holding a divergent, less pure opinion is normally punished, a dynamic which leads
45680	48960	to an inevitable escalation, as only the most extreme can win.
48960	50660	This is a pretty good definition, actually.
50660	54720	It could be anything from Mao's Red Guard to neo-Nazis to the Crucible, that's a play
54720	56840	about witch hunts, to Instagram knitting.
56840	60600	That's a reference to an article about how, back in 2020, an online knitting group got
60600	65080	radicalized towards leftist politics, because of that tired mantra, everything's political.
65080	67840	An event that began the prominence of Karlyn Borisenko.
67840	72000	If you've been plugged into internet politics since gamergate, like me, purity spiral is
72000	74620	probably a term you've picked up and mastered long ago.
74620	76920	We all know what it is, and we can all see one when it happens.
76920	81000	And if you're honest, you'll accept that any political camp, any group at all, is capable
81000	82000	of a purity spiral.
82000	85040	Though I do know that right now, they're commonly attributed to the left.
85040	86040	And with good reason.
86040	88680	The fate of Trotsky at the hands of Stalin after the death of Lenin.
88680	91640	The fate of the Gang of Four at the hands of Hua Guofeng.
91640	95060	And soon after, Guofeng at the hands of Deng Xiaoping after the death of Mao.
95060	97720	The terror under Rob Speer, which eventually took his own head.
97720	102140	There is an impulse embedded deep within the left to strive for ideological purity.
102140	105640	If you believe that you are truly creating the perfect society, if your goals are just
105640	109760	that righteous, it becomes easy to view people not as pure in their convictions as you, as
109760	110760	lesser than.
110760	115600	But it also becomes easy to commit horrible acts as you strive for that utopian vision.
115600	118840	But purity spirals are not the exclusive domain of the left.
118840	122700	Religious puritanism and ethno-nationalism contain similar impulses, and those examples
122700	126080	are so well known that I don't think I need to list them.
126080	130200	In terms of the online sphere, we're currently seeing the final destruction of two political
130200	131840	communities due to purity spirals.
131840	134240	Firstly, BreadTube is basically gone.
134240	136780	It's shattered, broken, destroyed by its own infighting.
136780	140680	For a long time, they were emboldened in their advocacy against Trump during the 2020 election,
140680	141680	so that's done now.
141680	144900	At the same time, they were all united in their hate of destiny, somebody who considers
144900	148700	himself as being on the left, even though he vehemently rejects socialism.
148700	150400	But destiny is now banned from Twitch.
150400	154040	So isolated within the decaying husk of a once vibrant movement, they began to turn
154040	157920	on each other, fighting over drama and clout, self-destructing in the process.
157920	162080	Secondly, Lauren Southern just put the final nail in the coffin of the dissident right,
162080	163080	as she puts it.
163080	167140	In a nearly three-hour video describing all of the worst excesses of every prominent online
167140	170620	right-leaning figure she'd ever had the displeasure of working with, Paul Joseph Watson,
170620	174640	Israel Levant, Faith Goldie, Milo, Tommy Robinson, and how after the money and clout
174640	178800	began to dry up, they rapidly turned on each other, and her, in order to get ahead.
178800	182580	The only person she had nothing bad to say about was Stefan Molyneux, which surprised
182580	183580	me, frankly.
183580	185740	I always thought there was something a little bit off about him, but hey, I'm happy to
185740	186740	be wrong.
186740	189100	Purity spirals are clearly a destructive element within a community.
189100	192480	If your group suffers from one, you're on a downhill trajectory, fast.
192480	196720	Your group will stop being about its purpose, and morph into being about its prominent members,
196720	199300	until everything of value has been sucked out of it.
199300	201960	So why do purity spirals keep happening?
201960	204140	Do they actually serve a purpose?
204140	209440	I mean, from an evolutionary standpoint, strictly, I know we evolve tribal tendencies for survival
209440	213160	purposes, but purity spirals seems to completely undermine that impulse.
213160	217400	I have no idea what the answer to this question is, but I've had a few thoughts over the
217400	219500	past couple months that I want to share with you.
219500	224440	Let's assume that, for the sake of extreme simplicity, there are only five moral questions.
224440	226200	We'll label them one to five.
226200	231260	And there are only two possible answers to each question, A and B. All in all, ten total
231260	232740	moral positions.
232740	236580	Now assume a person who believes that the moral answer to all five questions is A. So
236580	240500	to him, all five As are moral, and all five Bs are immoral.
240500	244740	Within his domain, the five As are allowed, and the five Bs are banned.
244740	247720	Five of the total of ten possible moral positions are permitted.
247720	251540	Now let's assume a second person, who believes that the moral answer to the first four questions
251540	255780	is A, but the moral answer to question five is B. If they come into contact with each
255780	257300	other, they have three choices.
257300	260960	One is to just remain separate, two is to go to war over their different moral opinion
260960	263600	on question five, and three is to live and let live.
263600	267320	In other words, the first person, despite his moral compass telling him to ban five
267320	271620	B, permits the second person to indulge in five B. And the second person, despite his
271620	276320	moral compass telling him to ban five A, permits the first person to indulge in five A, for
276320	277760	the sake of peace.
277760	281960	In a society where only the first person existed, there were five permitted moral positions
281960	283500	and five banned ones.
283500	287460	But in a society where these two people have chosen to coexist, there's now six permitted
287460	289820	moral positions and four banned ones.
289820	293240	That's what tolerance ultimately is, when you allow other people to do things that you
293240	296460	personally view as immoral, but don't have a direct stake in.
296460	300800	Now imagine a society that is filled with people, such that at least one person believes
300800	303060	in each of the ten possible positions.
303060	307160	In order to take into account everybody's morality, such a society would have no moral
307160	308320	prescriptions.
308320	312960	This is ultimately why people who preach open-ended tolerance end up defending the worst crimes,
313000	315800	and preventing pedophilia, even if they're not pedophiles themselves.
315800	319140	Because tolerance demands that they take into account the pedophile's moral position in
319140	321260	their calculations of a universal morality.
321260	325280	The morality is universalized in that it tolerates all individuals within it, and allows each
325280	327820	of them to follow their positive moral impulses.
327820	332220	But necessarily it also has no advice to give anybody on what they shouldn't do, because,
332220	336000	to steal a phrase, nothing is true, everything is permitted.
336000	339620	Postmodernism is therefore the end result of our attempts to craft a universal morality
339620	342640	that takes into account every single human's desires.
342640	346040	But frankly, I personally don't think I need to consider the point of view of the pedophile
346040	347860	when I'm figuring out my own moral code.
347860	351620	This process is the opposite of the purity spiral, and it's equally destructive.
351620	354880	While purity spiraling destroys communities from within, rotting them at the core until
354880	359960	there's nothing left, and expelling most people out, universalizing morality castrates a community,
359960	364680	rendering it unable to take any action lest one of the many individuals within it object.
364680	368520	Consider Antifa, they're a particularly radical section of the left that has destroyed property,
368520	370380	assaulted people, even killed people on occasion.
370380	374100	They are certainly the result of a purity spiral, and we have seen many people leave
374100	375300	the left in response.
375300	377020	But has that weakened the left?
377020	381060	I mean, it kinda has, but not nearly as much as we all thought it would, say five years
381060	382060	ago.
382060	385540	Antifa has been allowed to run roughshod over civil society for nearly a fucking decade
385540	388540	at this point, every time something happens that they don't like.
388540	392440	Purity spiraling has indeed stripped the left of a lot of its moral legitimacy in the eyes
392440	393560	of unaligned people.
393560	397920	It makes them out to be hypocrites and thugs, and it makes exiles the more lukewarm members.
397920	401840	But even as the left is saddled with these weaknesses, purity spiraling also generates
401840	403160	some strength for them.
403160	404960	The overtone window shifts leftward.
404960	409160	The national conversation is about something more extreme, closer to the radicals' desires.
409160	411880	Dissidents are weeded out to prevent them from causing trouble, and instead those dissidents
411880	415760	join the enemy's camp, broadening and therefore weakening their moral prescriptions in the
415760	418680	process, while the radicals' morals become more focused.
418680	422960	Suddenly, your enemy is more willing to compromise, as your former moderate positions have become
422960	423960	theirs.
423960	428520	The violent, uncompromising sect of the most radical individuals may isolate your movement
428520	431920	from the wider culture, but it's also a method by which concessions are extracted.
431920	435280	I heard in a recent video, I think it was from Jordan Peterson, that the estimated number
435280	437200	of Antifa members is actually quite small.
437200	443360	It does not take that many free riders or criminals or people who simply just don't
443360	450200	care and who would just as soon see everything burn to radically destabilize complex social
450200	451200	organizations.
451200	458680	I spoke recently with a journalist, Andy Ngo, about the anarchist group, Antifa, for example.
458680	465080	After being informed by some Democrats I was corresponding with that this group, Antifa,
465080	471200	didn't really exist, I didn't know what they meant until I asked Andy how many truly
471200	477840	active Antifa cells he thought existed in the US and how many active full-time equivalent
477840	480680	members each cell might have.
480680	488200	He thought 40 cells with 20 members each.
488200	491080	That's 800.
491080	496280	All that damage from 800 anarchists.
496280	499040	That's the Pareto principle.
499040	504620	A small number of agents in any organization or its equivalent pull all the weight.
504620	508300	And look at the change they have forced from the silent majority that just wants them to
508300	509300	go away.
509300	512940	In a sense, purity spirals are simultaneously how the left has destroyed itself and at the
512940	514820	same time how it's pushed its agenda.
514820	519140	And I think the right is getting wise to this and has begun doing the same thing on their
519140	520140	end.
520140	522540	Here's the issue though, just because this is an effective short-term strategy doesn't
522540	526580	mean I actually think it's good for society, nor do I think it unearths any sort of actual
526580	527580	truth.
527580	528580	Quite the opposite actually.
528580	531520	This is where you get people who are happy to disregard the truth, shredding the social
531520	534140	fabric all the while for political expediency.
534140	536880	We're just barely hanging on with the left doing this.
536880	539640	There's no way we'll make it out if the right starts doing it too.
539640	542480	And yeah, I've been in my comment sections for the past few videos.
542480	544100	The right absolutely does it too.
544100	548400	There's at least a very vocal minority of people angry with me that I don't blindly
548400	551080	ideologically agree with every single view that they hold.
551080	555060	And how it's somehow a betrayal or a leftward drift or whatever other nonsense because they
555060	556840	found me attacking the left.
556840	558520	So why am I attacking the right too?
558520	560800	My brother in Christ, I am a centrist.
560800	564200	I'm a classical liberal and I have been for many years.
564200	568000	Maybe you need to consider that if my logic sounds based and amazing when I'm critiquing
568000	571220	the left, but cucked and idiotic when I'm critiquing the right, that the problem might
571220	573200	actually be your view of the world.
573200	576400	But if you're part of a purity spiral, you probably won't actually consider that.
576400	578000	By the way, I'm fine with rightoids watching me.
578000	579280	I'm also fine with leftoids watching me too.
579280	581440	This is still a free speech zone at the end of the day.
581440	584440	You can tell me how wrong you think I am in the comments and I will tell you how wrong
584440	585880	I think you are in the videos.
585880	589920	But I reject the radicalism, the purity spiraling from any and all sides.
589920	592920	And I have no time for the tears of people who thought that I was one of them.
592920	593920	I'm not a rightist.
593920	595400	I'm also not a leftist.
595400	601040	Even if purity spiraling can be a solid short-term strategy, I think it destroys everything if
601040	602040	you engage in it.
602040	603180	There's a better way.
603180	605280	And that better way is what centrists do.
605280	608320	I don't need to expel people in order to bolster my ideology.
608320	611880	Nor do I need to extract concessions through extremism or negotiate with others who try
611880	613020	to extract them from me.
613020	615000	I don't need to compromise with subversives.
615000	618860	I don't need to engage in motte and baileys or respect that tactic when used by others.
618860	621080	I don't need to dog whistle, nor do I react to them.
621080	622080	I don't need to care about optics.
622240	624240	It's not like I have a reputation to uphold.
624240	626560	At the end of the day, the truth is the truth.
626560	630040	And it forms the best defense that we have against radicalism.
630040	631960	The truth is incontrovertible.
631960	635600	If you're a radical and you're wrong, no amount of further radicalism would convince me to
635600	637700	do anything other than oppose you.
637700	638200	Why would it?
