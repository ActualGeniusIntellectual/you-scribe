00:00.000 --> 00:08.640
You're probably looking at the title of this video and thinking, what the hell, Dev,

00:08.640 --> 00:09.640
what's this all about?

00:09.640 --> 00:12.040
Obviously, we all know what a purity spiral is.

00:12.040 --> 00:17.080
It's a social ratchet effect within a community, a process of moral outbidding unchecked which

00:17.080 --> 00:21.440
corrodes the group from within, rewarding those who put themselves at the extremes and

00:21.440 --> 00:23.400
punishing nuance relentlessly.

00:23.400 --> 00:24.840
At least that's what's on an urban dictionary.

00:24.840 --> 00:27.760
There's no Wikipedia page in the concept, and you'd think there would be.

00:27.760 --> 00:31.640
Not to be confused with virtue signaling, woke culture, or online mobs.

00:31.640 --> 00:35.500
A purity spiral can contain all of those things, but it's defined by the fact that it takes

00:35.500 --> 00:40.880
place in a defined community or society where being purer than thou is always being rewarded

00:40.880 --> 00:45.680
and holding a divergent, less pure opinion is normally punished, a dynamic which leads

00:45.680 --> 00:48.960
to an inevitable escalation, as only the most extreme can win.

00:48.960 --> 00:50.660
This is a pretty good definition, actually.

00:50.660 --> 00:54.720
It could be anything from Mao's Red Guard to neo-Nazis to the Crucible, that's a play

00:54.720 --> 00:56.840
about witch hunts, to Instagram knitting.

00:56.840 --> 01:00.600
That's a reference to an article about how, back in 2020, an online knitting group got

01:00.600 --> 01:05.080
radicalized towards leftist politics, because of that tired mantra, everything's political.

01:05.080 --> 01:07.840
An event that began the prominence of Karlyn Borisenko.

01:07.840 --> 01:12.000
If you've been plugged into internet politics since gamergate, like me, purity spiral is

01:12.000 --> 01:14.620
probably a term you've picked up and mastered long ago.

01:14.620 --> 01:16.920
We all know what it is, and we can all see one when it happens.

01:16.920 --> 01:21.000
And if you're honest, you'll accept that any political camp, any group at all, is capable

01:21.000 --> 01:22.000
of a purity spiral.

01:22.000 --> 01:25.040
Though I do know that right now, they're commonly attributed to the left.

01:25.040 --> 01:26.040
And with good reason.

01:26.040 --> 01:28.680
The fate of Trotsky at the hands of Stalin after the death of Lenin.

01:28.680 --> 01:31.640
The fate of the Gang of Four at the hands of Hua Guofeng.

01:31.640 --> 01:35.060
And soon after, Guofeng at the hands of Deng Xiaoping after the death of Mao.

01:35.060 --> 01:37.720
The terror under Rob Speer, which eventually took his own head.

01:37.720 --> 01:42.140
There is an impulse embedded deep within the left to strive for ideological purity.

01:42.140 --> 01:45.640
If you believe that you are truly creating the perfect society, if your goals are just

01:45.640 --> 01:49.760
that righteous, it becomes easy to view people not as pure in their convictions as you, as

01:49.760 --> 01:50.760
lesser than.

01:50.760 --> 01:55.600
But it also becomes easy to commit horrible acts as you strive for that utopian vision.

01:55.600 --> 01:58.840
But purity spirals are not the exclusive domain of the left.

01:58.840 --> 02:02.700
Religious puritanism and ethno-nationalism contain similar impulses, and those examples

02:02.700 --> 02:06.080
are so well known that I don't think I need to list them.

02:06.080 --> 02:10.200
In terms of the online sphere, we're currently seeing the final destruction of two political

02:10.200 --> 02:11.840
communities due to purity spirals.

02:11.840 --> 02:14.240
Firstly, BreadTube is basically gone.

02:14.240 --> 02:16.780
It's shattered, broken, destroyed by its own infighting.

02:16.780 --> 02:20.680
For a long time, they were emboldened in their advocacy against Trump during the 2020 election,

02:20.680 --> 02:21.680
so that's done now.

02:21.680 --> 02:24.900
At the same time, they were all united in their hate of destiny, somebody who considers

02:24.900 --> 02:28.700
himself as being on the left, even though he vehemently rejects socialism.

02:28.700 --> 02:30.400
But destiny is now banned from Twitch.

02:30.400 --> 02:34.040
So isolated within the decaying husk of a once vibrant movement, they began to turn

02:34.040 --> 02:37.920
on each other, fighting over drama and clout, self-destructing in the process.

02:37.920 --> 02:42.080
Secondly, Lauren Southern just put the final nail in the coffin of the dissident right,

02:42.080 --> 02:43.080
as she puts it.

02:43.080 --> 02:47.140
In a nearly three-hour video describing all of the worst excesses of every prominent online

02:47.140 --> 02:50.620
right-leaning figure she'd ever had the displeasure of working with, Paul Joseph Watson,

02:50.620 --> 02:54.640
Israel Levant, Faith Goldie, Milo, Tommy Robinson, and how after the money and clout

02:54.640 --> 02:58.800
began to dry up, they rapidly turned on each other, and her, in order to get ahead.

02:58.800 --> 03:02.580
The only person she had nothing bad to say about was Stefan Molyneux, which surprised

03:02.580 --> 03:03.580
me, frankly.

03:03.580 --> 03:05.740
I always thought there was something a little bit off about him, but hey, I'm happy to

03:05.740 --> 03:06.740
be wrong.

03:06.740 --> 03:09.100
Purity spirals are clearly a destructive element within a community.

03:09.100 --> 03:12.480
If your group suffers from one, you're on a downhill trajectory, fast.

03:12.480 --> 03:16.720
Your group will stop being about its purpose, and morph into being about its prominent members,

03:16.720 --> 03:19.300
until everything of value has been sucked out of it.

03:19.300 --> 03:21.960
So why do purity spirals keep happening?

03:21.960 --> 03:24.140
Do they actually serve a purpose?

03:24.140 --> 03:29.440
I mean, from an evolutionary standpoint, strictly, I know we evolve tribal tendencies for survival

03:29.440 --> 03:33.160
purposes, but purity spirals seems to completely undermine that impulse.

03:33.160 --> 03:37.400
I have no idea what the answer to this question is, but I've had a few thoughts over the

03:37.400 --> 03:39.500
past couple months that I want to share with you.

03:39.500 --> 03:44.440
Let's assume that, for the sake of extreme simplicity, there are only five moral questions.

03:44.440 --> 03:46.200
We'll label them one to five.

03:46.200 --> 03:51.260
And there are only two possible answers to each question, A and B. All in all, ten total

03:51.260 --> 03:52.740
moral positions.

03:52.740 --> 03:56.580
Now assume a person who believes that the moral answer to all five questions is A. So

03:56.580 --> 04:00.500
to him, all five As are moral, and all five Bs are immoral.

04:00.500 --> 04:04.740
Within his domain, the five As are allowed, and the five Bs are banned.

04:04.740 --> 04:07.720
Five of the total of ten possible moral positions are permitted.

04:07.720 --> 04:11.540
Now let's assume a second person, who believes that the moral answer to the first four questions

04:11.540 --> 04:15.780
is A, but the moral answer to question five is B. If they come into contact with each

04:15.780 --> 04:17.300
other, they have three choices.

04:17.300 --> 04:20.960
One is to just remain separate, two is to go to war over their different moral opinion

04:20.960 --> 04:23.600
on question five, and three is to live and let live.

04:23.600 --> 04:27.320
In other words, the first person, despite his moral compass telling him to ban five

04:27.320 --> 04:31.620
B, permits the second person to indulge in five B. And the second person, despite his

04:31.620 --> 04:36.320
moral compass telling him to ban five A, permits the first person to indulge in five A, for

04:36.320 --> 04:37.760
the sake of peace.

04:37.760 --> 04:41.960
In a society where only the first person existed, there were five permitted moral positions

04:41.960 --> 04:43.500
and five banned ones.

04:43.500 --> 04:47.460
But in a society where these two people have chosen to coexist, there's now six permitted

04:47.460 --> 04:49.820
moral positions and four banned ones.

04:49.820 --> 04:53.240
That's what tolerance ultimately is, when you allow other people to do things that you

04:53.240 --> 04:56.460
personally view as immoral, but don't have a direct stake in.

04:56.460 --> 05:00.800
Now imagine a society that is filled with people, such that at least one person believes

05:00.800 --> 05:03.060
in each of the ten possible positions.

05:03.060 --> 05:07.160
In order to take into account everybody's morality, such a society would have no moral

05:07.160 --> 05:08.320
prescriptions.

05:08.320 --> 05:12.960
This is ultimately why people who preach open-ended tolerance end up defending the worst crimes,

05:13.000 --> 05:15.800
and preventing pedophilia, even if they're not pedophiles themselves.

05:15.800 --> 05:19.140
Because tolerance demands that they take into account the pedophile's moral position in

05:19.140 --> 05:21.260
their calculations of a universal morality.

05:21.260 --> 05:25.280
The morality is universalized in that it tolerates all individuals within it, and allows each

05:25.280 --> 05:27.820
of them to follow their positive moral impulses.

05:27.820 --> 05:32.220
But necessarily it also has no advice to give anybody on what they shouldn't do, because,

05:32.220 --> 05:36.000
to steal a phrase, nothing is true, everything is permitted.

05:36.000 --> 05:39.620
Postmodernism is therefore the end result of our attempts to craft a universal morality

05:39.620 --> 05:42.640
that takes into account every single human's desires.

05:42.640 --> 05:46.040
But frankly, I personally don't think I need to consider the point of view of the pedophile

05:46.040 --> 05:47.860
when I'm figuring out my own moral code.

05:47.860 --> 05:51.620
This process is the opposite of the purity spiral, and it's equally destructive.

05:51.620 --> 05:54.880
While purity spiraling destroys communities from within, rotting them at the core until

05:54.880 --> 05:59.960
there's nothing left, and expelling most people out, universalizing morality castrates a community,

05:59.960 --> 06:04.680
rendering it unable to take any action lest one of the many individuals within it object.

06:04.680 --> 06:08.520
Consider Antifa, they're a particularly radical section of the left that has destroyed property,

06:08.520 --> 06:10.380
assaulted people, even killed people on occasion.

06:10.380 --> 06:14.100
They are certainly the result of a purity spiral, and we have seen many people leave

06:14.100 --> 06:15.300
the left in response.

06:15.300 --> 06:17.020
But has that weakened the left?

06:17.020 --> 06:21.060
I mean, it kinda has, but not nearly as much as we all thought it would, say five years

06:21.060 --> 06:22.060
ago.

06:22.060 --> 06:25.540
Antifa has been allowed to run roughshod over civil society for nearly a fucking decade

06:25.540 --> 06:28.540
at this point, every time something happens that they don't like.

06:28.540 --> 06:32.440
Purity spiraling has indeed stripped the left of a lot of its moral legitimacy in the eyes

06:32.440 --> 06:33.560
of unaligned people.

06:33.560 --> 06:37.920
It makes them out to be hypocrites and thugs, and it makes exiles the more lukewarm members.

06:37.920 --> 06:41.840
But even as the left is saddled with these weaknesses, purity spiraling also generates

06:41.840 --> 06:43.160
some strength for them.

06:43.160 --> 06:44.960
The overtone window shifts leftward.

06:44.960 --> 06:49.160
The national conversation is about something more extreme, closer to the radicals' desires.

06:49.160 --> 06:51.880
Dissidents are weeded out to prevent them from causing trouble, and instead those dissidents

06:51.880 --> 06:55.760
join the enemy's camp, broadening and therefore weakening their moral prescriptions in the

06:55.760 --> 06:58.680
process, while the radicals' morals become more focused.

06:58.680 --> 07:02.960
Suddenly, your enemy is more willing to compromise, as your former moderate positions have become

07:02.960 --> 07:03.960
theirs.

07:03.960 --> 07:08.520
The violent, uncompromising sect of the most radical individuals may isolate your movement

07:08.520 --> 07:11.920
from the wider culture, but it's also a method by which concessions are extracted.

07:11.920 --> 07:15.280
I heard in a recent video, I think it was from Jordan Peterson, that the estimated number

07:15.280 --> 07:17.200
of Antifa members is actually quite small.

07:17.200 --> 07:23.360
It does not take that many free riders or criminals or people who simply just don't

07:23.360 --> 07:30.200
care and who would just as soon see everything burn to radically destabilize complex social

07:30.200 --> 07:31.200
organizations.

07:31.200 --> 07:38.680
I spoke recently with a journalist, Andy Ngo, about the anarchist group, Antifa, for example.

07:38.680 --> 07:45.080
After being informed by some Democrats I was corresponding with that this group, Antifa,

07:45.080 --> 07:51.200
didn't really exist, I didn't know what they meant until I asked Andy how many truly

07:51.200 --> 07:57.840
active Antifa cells he thought existed in the US and how many active full-time equivalent

07:57.840 --> 08:00.680
members each cell might have.

08:00.680 --> 08:08.200
He thought 40 cells with 20 members each.

08:08.200 --> 08:11.080
That's 800.

08:11.080 --> 08:16.280
All that damage from 800 anarchists.

08:16.280 --> 08:19.040
That's the Pareto principle.

08:19.040 --> 08:24.620
A small number of agents in any organization or its equivalent pull all the weight.

08:24.620 --> 08:28.300
And look at the change they have forced from the silent majority that just wants them to

08:28.300 --> 08:29.300
go away.

08:29.300 --> 08:32.940
In a sense, purity spirals are simultaneously how the left has destroyed itself and at the

08:32.940 --> 08:34.820
same time how it's pushed its agenda.

08:34.820 --> 08:39.140
And I think the right is getting wise to this and has begun doing the same thing on their

08:39.140 --> 08:40.140
end.

08:40.140 --> 08:42.540
Here's the issue though, just because this is an effective short-term strategy doesn't

08:42.540 --> 08:46.580
mean I actually think it's good for society, nor do I think it unearths any sort of actual

08:46.580 --> 08:47.580
truth.

08:47.580 --> 08:48.580
Quite the opposite actually.

08:48.580 --> 08:51.520
This is where you get people who are happy to disregard the truth, shredding the social

08:51.520 --> 08:54.140
fabric all the while for political expediency.

08:54.140 --> 08:56.880
We're just barely hanging on with the left doing this.

08:56.880 --> 08:59.640
There's no way we'll make it out if the right starts doing it too.

08:59.640 --> 09:02.480
And yeah, I've been in my comment sections for the past few videos.

09:02.480 --> 09:04.100
The right absolutely does it too.

09:04.100 --> 09:08.400
There's at least a very vocal minority of people angry with me that I don't blindly

09:08.400 --> 09:11.080
ideologically agree with every single view that they hold.

09:11.080 --> 09:15.060
And how it's somehow a betrayal or a leftward drift or whatever other nonsense because they

09:15.060 --> 09:16.840
found me attacking the left.

09:16.840 --> 09:18.520
So why am I attacking the right too?

09:18.520 --> 09:20.800
My brother in Christ, I am a centrist.

09:20.800 --> 09:24.200
I'm a classical liberal and I have been for many years.

09:24.200 --> 09:28.000
Maybe you need to consider that if my logic sounds based and amazing when I'm critiquing

09:28.000 --> 09:31.220
the left, but cucked and idiotic when I'm critiquing the right, that the problem might

09:31.220 --> 09:33.200
actually be your view of the world.

09:33.200 --> 09:36.400
But if you're part of a purity spiral, you probably won't actually consider that.

09:36.400 --> 09:38.000
By the way, I'm fine with rightoids watching me.

09:38.000 --> 09:39.280
I'm also fine with leftoids watching me too.

09:39.280 --> 09:41.440
This is still a free speech zone at the end of the day.

09:41.440 --> 09:44.440
You can tell me how wrong you think I am in the comments and I will tell you how wrong

09:44.440 --> 09:45.880
I think you are in the videos.

09:45.880 --> 09:49.920
But I reject the radicalism, the purity spiraling from any and all sides.

09:49.920 --> 09:52.920
And I have no time for the tears of people who thought that I was one of them.

09:52.920 --> 09:53.920
I'm not a rightist.

09:53.920 --> 09:55.400
I'm also not a leftist.

09:55.400 --> 10:01.040
Even if purity spiraling can be a solid short-term strategy, I think it destroys everything if

10:01.040 --> 10:02.040
you engage in it.

10:02.040 --> 10:03.180
There's a better way.

10:03.180 --> 10:05.280
And that better way is what centrists do.

10:05.280 --> 10:08.320
I don't need to expel people in order to bolster my ideology.

10:08.320 --> 10:11.880
Nor do I need to extract concessions through extremism or negotiate with others who try

10:11.880 --> 10:13.020
to extract them from me.

10:13.020 --> 10:15.000
I don't need to compromise with subversives.

10:15.000 --> 10:18.860
I don't need to engage in motte and baileys or respect that tactic when used by others.

10:18.860 --> 10:21.080
I don't need to dog whistle, nor do I react to them.

10:21.080 --> 10:22.080
I don't need to care about optics.

10:22.240 --> 10:24.240
It's not like I have a reputation to uphold.

10:24.240 --> 10:26.560
At the end of the day, the truth is the truth.

10:26.560 --> 10:30.040
And it forms the best defense that we have against radicalism.

10:30.040 --> 10:31.960
The truth is incontrovertible.

10:31.960 --> 10:35.600
If you're a radical and you're wrong, no amount of further radicalism would convince me to

10:35.600 --> 10:37.700
do anything other than oppose you.

10:37.700 --> 10:38.200
Why would it?
