1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,640
Why is it that Socialists seem to hate charity?

2
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:09,880
That's the topic of the video today.

3
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:12,220
I presume you already know that though, you're the one who clicked on it.

4
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:14,060
It sounds paradoxical in the face of it.

5
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:17,680
Why would the people who claim to advocate for the poor and the downtrodden working class

6
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:22,040
be against the idea of giving charity to that very same working class who need it?

7
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:26,400
Doesn't their desire to help stem from harm reduction principles and caring for the vulnerable?

8
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:27,740
Why would they be against charity?

9
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:30,740
As usual, this exchange on Twitter got me interested in the topic.

10
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:35,060
Chris Freeman is poking a bit of fun at Karl Marx by comparing the Marxist position of

11
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:40,240
reject the bourgeois ethic of individual giving with Marx's own tendency to beg for money

12
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:41,620
from Friedrich Engels.

13
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:44,900
If you watch my channel regularly, this should sound pretty familiar to you.

14
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:49,180
In an earlier video, where I dug down into the idea that Socialists are mad against God

15
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:52,680
for the crime of being, a quote of Jordan Peterson's, we discovered that what motivates

16
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:55,100
Socialists isn't actually a love of the poor.

17
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:58,980
At the end of the video, I read to you letters from Heinrich Marx, Karl Marx's father,

18
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:03,320
who chastised him repeatedly for ignoring his family unless he needed money from them.

19
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:06,980
Many Marxists follow in his footsteps, from his lifelong depression, to his tendency to

20
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:10,500
manipulate others, to his constant mooching off of everybody around him.

21
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:12,820
Where it was once his dad, it later became Engels.

22
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:14,500
Which is what Freeman is poking fun at.

23
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:15,820
But check out this reply.

24
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:18,140
What you read is solidarity, not charity.

25
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:20,780
This is stressed by many leftists, but you weren't paying attention.

26
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:25,160
You'll find that slogan, solidarity, not charity, all over socialist spaces, when it

27
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:27,060
comes to talking about helping the poor.

28
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:28,780
London's Young Communist League.

29
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:31,460
Last weekend we did another food bank collection for Hackney Food Bank.

30
00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:34,380
Members of the public donated a huge amount of food again, and a great amount of support

31
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:35,380
for us was shown.

32
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:36,820
Solidarity, not charity.

33
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:37,940
The Christian Socialists.

34
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:41,340
At some point, churches are going to have to unlearn how they practice charity, so they

35
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:43,540
can learn how to practice solidarity.

36
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:44,640
Community Food Centres Canada.

37
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:47,960
A single meal or a hundred meals will not solve the hunger crisis.

38
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:50,340
What we need is not charity, but solidarity.

39
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:53,740
So let's ask the question, what is the difference between charity and solidarity?

40
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:56,380
Let's start with two simple definitions and then work our way down.

41
00:01:56,380 --> 00:02:00,620
The practice of charity is the voluntary giving of help to those in need, as a humanitarian

42
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:02,540
act, unmotivated by self-interest.

43
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:06,060
There are a number of philosophies about charity often associated with religion.

44
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:11,140
Meanwhile, solidarity is an awareness of shared interests, objectives, standards, and sympathies,

45
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:14,180
creating a psychological sense of unity of groups or classes.

46
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:16,140
It is based on class collaboration.

47
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:19,700
It refers to the ties in a society that bind people together as one.

48
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:23,940
This all ties back to, for the 50th time, Marx's essay on the Jewish question, where

49
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:27,580
he critiques the liberal idea that individuals have the right to be separate from others

50
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:31,360
and live in their own private affairs, as he believed we were all connected by virtue

51
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:35,080
of economic transactions, therefore any exchange of goods or money meant that the other party

52
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:38,900
now had a stake in your behavior, therefore other people had a right to have their nose

53
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:39,900
in your business.

54
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:43,500
We've gone over that essay and this idea so many times on this channel, you've got

55
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:44,500
to know it by now.

56
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:48,780
Maybe at some point I should devote a video to discussing only this idea and how influential

57
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:52,500
it is over all of socialism, because it's one of those great linchpins that nobody knows

58
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:53,500
about.

59
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:57,540
Upon it rests not only charity not solidarity, but also Gramsci's idea that all cultural

60
00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:01,820
products must be subverted to a socialist goal, or the justification of theft and collective

61
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:05,500
ownership, or the idea that compromise with the capitalist system will end with the absorption

62
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:10,260
of the compromiser into capitalism, or really, the rejection of all things liberalistic and

63
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:11,260
individualistic.

64
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:15,300
In the context of our topic today, this tweet is the best one I've found that describes

65
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:17,380
the difference between the two, in a casual sense.

66
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:21,160
I like the idea of moving from charity and into solidarity with each other.

67
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:25,400
If my people are suffering and vice versa, we are in direct relationship with each other,

68
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,940
we are each other's business.

69
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:30,360
On the surface this sounds caring, like we're all looking out for each other, but that phrase

70
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:34,460
we are each other's business suddenly takes on a very menacing tone the minute you think

71
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:36,360
of it in the context of privacy.

72
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:40,260
This idea that we're all connected and therefore the collective of humanity has a stake in

73
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:44,500
the individual's business is the philosophical basis for both classical fascism and the modern

74
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:45,940
surveillance state.

75
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:49,220
Solidarity is an individualistic act, it's when a person voluntarily chooses to give

76
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:52,200
up something of their own to help the less fortunate out of the goodness of their heart.

77
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:55,380
But solidarity isn't individualistic, not in this context.

78
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:58,900
Solidarity is a demand, justified by those eternal connections to each other that Marx

79
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:00,180
believed we all have.

80
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:03,700
If you have excess and your fellow man has need, it's not about charity, it's not

81
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:08,340
about individually choosing to help them and acting virtuously in doing so, it's about

82
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:12,140
solidarity, it's that your fellow man's need grants him a right to your excess out

83
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:14,460
of that Marxian connection, out of a sense of solidarity.

84
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:18,780
And this is how the more mainstream of socialism views charity, this isn't just some twitter

85
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:19,780
nonsense.

86
00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:22,780
People who perform charitable acts might be good, or maybe they're just trying to maintain

87
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:23,780
their own station.

88
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:24,780
It doesn't matter in the end.

89
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:28,540
Charity, even with the best of intentions, perpetuates capitalism, and so socialists

90
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:29,540
oppose it.

91
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:30,540
Here's how.

92
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:31,540
On this topic, Marx wrote,

93
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:35,060
The social principles of Christianity preach the necessity of a ruling and an oppressed

94
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:39,480
class, and all they have for the latter is the pious wish that the former will be charitable.

95
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:43,340
The social principles of Christianity transfer the counsellor's adjustment of all infamies

96
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:46,900
to heaven, and thus justify the further existence of those infamies on earth.

97
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:50,500
The social principles of Christianity declare all vile acts of the oppressors against the

98
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:53,260
oppressed to be the just punishment of original sin.

99
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:57,740
The social principles of Christianity preach cowardice, self-contempt, abasement, submission,

100
00:04:57,740 --> 00:04:58,740
dejection.

101
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:01,940
In a word, all the qualities of riffraff, and the proletariat, not wishing to be treated

102
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:06,460
as riffraff, needs its courage, its self-reliance, its pride, and its sense of independence more

103
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:07,460
than its bread.

104
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:11,180
The social principles of Christianity are sneakish, and the proletariat is revolutionary.

105
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:13,020
Similarly, Engels also wrote,

106
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:16,060
The English bourgeoisie is charitable out of self-interest.

107
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:19,860
It gives nothing outright, but regards its gifts as a business matter, makes a bargain

108
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:24,260
with the poor, saying, If I spend this much upon benevolent institutions, I thereby purchase

109
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:27,900
the right not to be troubled any further, and you are bound thereby to stay in your

110
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:31,660
dusky holes, and not to irritate my tender nerves by exposing your misery.

111
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:34,560
You shall despair as before, but you shall despair unseen.

112
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:37,900
This I require, this I purchase, with my subscription of twenty pounds for the infamy.

113
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:40,660
It is infamous, this charity of Christian bourgeois.

114
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:42,340
It's not just old socialists, either.

115
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:46,040
Benjamin Sheppard, professor at the University of New York, wrote the paper, Community Practice

116
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:49,980
as Social Activism, From Direct Action to Direct Services, where he defines the phrase

117
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:53,440
mutual aid as people giving what they can and getting what they need, which is quite

118
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:57,100
similar to Marx's, from each according to his ability, to each according to his needs.

119
00:05:57,100 --> 00:06:01,620
Dean Spade, a socialist trans-revolutionary, meaning he's both personally trans, and

120
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:06,000
his revolution is trans, and law professor at Seattle University, wrote a 12-page paper

121
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
on the topic, too.

122
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,460
Solidarity, not charity.

123
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:10,060
Mutual aid for mobilization and survival.

124
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:13,920
And honestly, I could quote any line in that paper to get my point across.

125
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:17,420
Mutual aid is a more specific term for what socialists want to replace charity, though

126
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:19,320
it's also older than it sounds.

127
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:23,240
Kropotkin defined mutual aid as the idea that cooperation within a species is more important

128
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:27,200
to its evolution than competition, and that those instinctive feelings of solidarity towards

129
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:31,020
each other, what we would call nowadays as in-group preference, is the basis for mutual

130
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:32,020
aid.

131
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:35,300
Kropotkin's view was that an alternative economic system would have to be anti-capitalist

132
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:39,520
and anti-hierarchy, and would have to distribute goods through a decentralized network of voluntary

133
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:42,480
associations and also must fulfill the needs of everybody involved.

134
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:44,660
It's not hard to see how all this is bullshit, right?

135
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:48,480
Like yeah, that one paper from Spade points out various mutual aid efforts like the Black

136
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:52,040
Panthers and how they actually manage to collectively come together and help each other materially

137
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,040
when necessary.

138
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,460
And there's dozens of other examples like that.

139
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:57,620
It's not like these structures can't work, they absolutely can.

140
00:06:57,620 --> 00:06:59,920
Do you help your family and friends when they're in a rough spot?

141
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:00,920
Sure, of course.

142
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:05,080
Same with church groups and clubs and on-campus organizations and unions and whatever else.

143
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:08,400
People are absolutely willing to help others they know, but that's just charity with

144
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,400
a different word.

145
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:12,920
It becomes solidarity instead of charity when it becomes mutual aid.

146
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:15,860
That's when you're helping people you don't know as if you know them.

147
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:18,040
Not that you help them a little bit, like you're giving to the poor, but that you

148
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,840
help them a lot because you know them personally.

149
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:22,560
You help them as if they are close to you when they are not.

150
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,540
And for most people, that's a hard sell.

151
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:28,720
This is why Marxist ideas and practice always involve force, because give what you can and

152
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:33,140
get what you need sounds nice on paper until you realize that it has no defense against

153
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:34,260
the free rider problem.

154
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:37,980
The idea that some people will simply take and not give back under the pretense of needing

155
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:40,220
much and not being able to give anything at all.

156
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:43,860
At that point, either the system collapses or the people in power begin to use oppressive

157
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:46,420
methods to ensure that the voluntary giving continues.

158
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:50,040
I want to make it perfectly clear here, I'm not against the idea of mutual aid.

159
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:53,500
If you've got some collective organization that you give your time to and help the poor

160
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:54,500
with, more power to you.

161
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:55,900
I've done it a few times myself.

162
00:07:55,900 --> 00:08:00,660
But when people are explicitly rejecting charity in favor of mutual aid, despite the obvious

163
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:04,720
practical overlap between the two, they're sending a message that giving what is yours

164
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:08,480
out of the kindness of your heart is not enough because what is yours, you stole and

165
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:09,940
the poor have a right to it.

166
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:13,380
In giving, you are not being a good person, you are rectifying a wrong you committed.

167
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:14,940
It's not good, it's the baseline.

168
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:18,320
I know at least a few people from DGG also watch my content, post in the comments if

169
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:19,320
you do.

170
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:20,320
You guys remember this debate, right?

171
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:23,960
Leftist jumps in to debate and gatekeep Destiny from IRL activism?

172
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:27,600
This was in the context of Destiny using his platform to assist in canvassing efforts for

173
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:30,980
the mayoral race in his hometown of Omaha, despite having moved away to LA.

174
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:34,780
And an anarcho-communist who was still back in Omaha was extremely angry about his involvement

175
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:36,000
for a bunch of different reasons.

176
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,940
But listen to some of the rhetoric that this guy uses.

177
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:40,680
You don't think that any of the churches, you don't think that any of the church communities

178
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:43,700
around Omaha are involved in helping in any of the local soup kitchens?

179
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:44,700
Or involved in helping-

180
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:46,700
It's fucking transactional.

181
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:47,700
It's transactional.

182
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:51,260
So, so, wow, so it really, do you think, do you think that when a person, I'm just, I'm

183
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:54,060
super curious in your opinion, do you think that when a person is getting a meal to eat

184
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:57,320
that they otherwise wouldn't in a city like Omaha, do you think they care if the organization

185
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:00,840
giving it to them is doing it for some transaction with God or something?

186
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:03,720
No, we're not talking about the person receiving aid.

187
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:06,400
We're talking about the people that are giving the aid.

188
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:09,520
Who cares about the people that are giving the aid as long as they're doing it?

189
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:12,960
When I was volunteering for high school, I don't remember anybody turning down a meal

190
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:17,040
that we served or turning down a sandwich that we handed out because it was compulsory.

191
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:21,120
I'm saying that your charity that you were doing was charity.

192
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:24,480
It was, it was given from the top down.

193
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:28,680
Did the community request that your church come out and give them food or did they just

194
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:30,180
request food?

195
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:33,760
So then why do you have to make it a transactional approach?

196
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:38,080
I guess like the way that I look at it at the end of the day, yeah, we might just have

197
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,080
different values.

198
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:41,720
At the end of the day, for me, the more people that are getting fed, the better.

199
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:47,160
How much money have you spent on your efforts to mobilize voters or whatever it is you call?

200
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:50,520
When the other three major candidates running in this race want to publish all their figures,

201
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:53,820
I mean, I'll publish mine, but I don't see why I need to answer that question.

202
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:55,180
What you have spent.

203
00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:56,180
I don't know why.

204
00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:57,540
I don't know why I need to answer that question.

205
00:09:57,540 --> 00:10:00,300
What's the implication?

206
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:02,500
How much food that could have provided?

207
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:03,500
I don't.

208
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:04,820
Do you really think it's like one to one like that?

209
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:08,100
Do you think that no money can be spent on political advocacy if there's like a hungry

210
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:11,140
person or you don't think that there might be more money that could be spent getting

211
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:14,060
somebody in office that might be able to address these problems rather than just buying a meal

212
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:15,480
for somebody?

213
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:20,040
I think we're better off not fucking waiting for you fucking libs to tie your fucking shoes

214
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:22,320
and get on the streets and do the fucking work.

215
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:25,460
If this is a video you remember, I recommend you go back and watch it again with some of

216
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:27,640
this knowledge about how socialists view charity.

217
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:28,800
It'll open your eyes.

218
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:33,140
The reason this guy sounded so nonsensical is because he genuinely believes that charity

219
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:37,340
perpetuates capitalism, that electoralism and liberal institutions have entirely failed.

220
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:40,920
And the only way to help people is through decentralized mutual aid structures that local

221
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:44,320
communities must build to replace the state with anarcho communism.

222
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:47,300
Broadly speaking, there are two leftist views of mutual aid.

223
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:51,220
The first view is what's held by that Omaha brainlet, where out of a sense of solidarity,

224
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:55,640
they reject both charity and the social safety nets of a liberal society believing that their

225
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:59,700
way is the only way to truly liberate people since charity presupposes the correctness

226
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:04,800
of capitalism while safety nets rely on electoralism, which will always be a failed system for socialists.

227
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:08,360
The second view of mutual aid is that the state itself should be its mechanism.

228
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:12,000
This view conflates the social safety net with mutual aid, making them one in the same.

229
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,840
It's from this point of view that we get the idea that you have a moral obligation to pay

230
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:20,040
your taxes because that's ultimately the same moral obligation that drives you to perform

231
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:21,120
charitable acts.

232
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:24,660
This view is at least a little more justifiable than the first one, because it is true that

233
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:28,420
poor people benefit from those programs, while the only thing that socialist bumble fucks

234
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:31,740
have ever built using the first system is stuff that is ultimately destructive like

235
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:32,740
Chaz.

236
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:36,700
This second view of mutual aid stems from Clement Attlee, the architect of the modern

237
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:41,460
British welfare state, who famously said, charity is a cold, grey, loveless thing.

238
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:45,620
If a rich man wants to help the poor, he should pay his taxes gladly, not dole out money at

239
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:46,620
a whim.

240
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:50,020
The problem with this point of view, though, is that it implies the government is responsible

241
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:52,760
for feeding, clothing, and housing you, and it's not.

242
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:53,760
You are.

243
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:57,040
Imagine thinking that charity, given from one person to another, from the kindness of

244
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:02,620
their heart, is cold, grey, and loveless, especially compared to a vast impersonal bureaucracy

245
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:06,400
run by government employees who only need to do the barest of the minimum to keep their

246
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:07,400
job.

247
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:09,800
This doesn't mean that I'm against the idea of the welfare state, but I do see it for

248
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:10,800
what it is.

249
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:15,240
It's not some grand moral project to which we should swear our undying allegiance to.

250
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:17,400
It's a practical solution to a real world problem.

251
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:20,900
We should not love our governments the way we love our families, even when governments

252
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:21,900
do good work.

253
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:26,740
And knowing that is what makes the UK's sacrifice for the good of the NHS rhetoric so eerie

254
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:28,140
looking at it from the outside.

255
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:30,580
The NHS isn't your mother, it's a bureaucracy.

256
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:33,660
It might be a good system, even a necessary one, but it's not a person.

257
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:36,180
Plus, imagine the moral implications of Attlee's statement.

258
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:39,740
Yes, Engels said that some people use charity as a way to make themselves feel better about

259
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:40,740
the state of the poor.

260
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:42,740
They paid a few bucks and now they expect the poor to shut up.

261
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:46,400
That's a fair criticism, but Attlee's statement creates an inverse situation.

262
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:50,180
If taxation is the only avenue through which the rich can fulfill his duty to help the

263
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:53,440
poor, then if a rich man has paid up all of his taxes and he sees a beggar on the street,

264
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:56,220
he is now under no moral obligation to give him anything.

265
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:59,220
He's already done his part, and charity is cold and impersonal besides.

266
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:00,960
What further good is there in helping?

267
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:02,120
It's a nonsense position.

268
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:06,620
In fact, it seems to be the case that charity is superior, at least morally, specifically

269
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:08,500
because it is done voluntarily.

270
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:11,900
It's not done because the person who is giving is guilty, like with solidarity.

271
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:15,540
It's not done as a part of building the post-capitalist utopia, like with mutual aid.

272
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:19,460
And it's not done out of the threat of state retaliation, like with taxation.

273
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:23,120
It could be done as a way to bolster the person's standing, sure, but there's still a moral

274
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:25,120
component deep underneath that.

275
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:30,160
Valuing being a person who does real charitable acts is not too far off from valuing doing

276
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:32,120
real charitable acts, at least on some level.

277
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:36,140
You could say no to donating, but the fact that you chose not to, that is where the extra

278
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:40,260
moral content of charity exists that isn't present in these other methods of helping

279
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:41,260
the poor.

280
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:44,580
The virtue is in letting go of what is valuable so that others might be helped, not holding

281
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:48,120
onto it for your own selfish reasons, nor having it demanded from you by somebody who

282
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:49,120
is self-righteous.

283
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:53,120
I've said many times in this channel that socialism is just institutionalized theft.

284
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:56,500
If you live in a society where it's normal to point at whoever has more than you and

285
00:13:56,500 --> 00:14:00,820
call them a capitalist oppressor, a counter-revolutionary, a bourgeois, a kulak, and then use those

286
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:04,960
labels as moral justification to steal from them, the people living in that society will

287
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:08,420
train each other to belittle and hate and use their own victimization.

288
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:11,980
Eventually, society becomes a constant struggle of selfishness, where everybody owns everything

289
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:14,180
collectively so why not just take everything you see?

290
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:15,780
You already own it.

291
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:16,780
But charity begets compassion.

292
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:20,540
To see a person suffering, to watch as their suffering is alleviated by a simple random

293
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:21,540
act of kindness.

294
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:25,300
It's hard to hate a person you have compassion for, it's hard to take from others when

295
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:26,300
you know how they feel.

296
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:29,580
But it's easy to hate them and take from them if you feel like you've been victimized

297
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:30,580
by them.

298
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:33,820
Charity's got its problems, Engle's critique was at least kind of correct, but like with

299
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:38,460
all other socialist critiques, as they discover and describe real problems, their solutions

300
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:40,580
make things a million times worse.

301
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:44,540
We should have a social safety net, and we should have mutual aid organizations, but

302
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:46,180
we also should have charity.

303
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:49,860
If anybody on the left ever tells you that charity is bad, it's a pretty good sign

304
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:52,800
that they don't actually give a shit about the people they claim to advocate for, beyond

305
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:53,700
using them as pawns.
