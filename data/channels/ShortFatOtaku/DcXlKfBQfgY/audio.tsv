0	8640	Why is it that Socialists seem to hate charity?
8640	9880	That's the topic of the video today.
9880	12220	I presume you already know that though, you're the one who clicked on it.
12220	14060	It sounds paradoxical in the face of it.
14060	17680	Why would the people who claim to advocate for the poor and the downtrodden working class
17680	22040	be against the idea of giving charity to that very same working class who need it?
22040	26400	Doesn't their desire to help stem from harm reduction principles and caring for the vulnerable?
26400	27740	Why would they be against charity?
27740	30740	As usual, this exchange on Twitter got me interested in the topic.
30740	35060	Chris Freeman is poking a bit of fun at Karl Marx by comparing the Marxist position of
35060	40240	reject the bourgeois ethic of individual giving with Marx's own tendency to beg for money
40240	41620	from Friedrich Engels.
41620	44900	If you watch my channel regularly, this should sound pretty familiar to you.
44900	49180	In an earlier video, where I dug down into the idea that Socialists are mad against God
49180	52680	for the crime of being, a quote of Jordan Peterson's, we discovered that what motivates
52680	55100	Socialists isn't actually a love of the poor.
55100	58980	At the end of the video, I read to you letters from Heinrich Marx, Karl Marx's father,
58980	63320	who chastised him repeatedly for ignoring his family unless he needed money from them.
63320	66980	Many Marxists follow in his footsteps, from his lifelong depression, to his tendency to
66980	70500	manipulate others, to his constant mooching off of everybody around him.
70500	72820	Where it was once his dad, it later became Engels.
72820	74500	Which is what Freeman is poking fun at.
74500	75820	But check out this reply.
75820	78140	What you read is solidarity, not charity.
78140	80780	This is stressed by many leftists, but you weren't paying attention.
80780	85160	You'll find that slogan, solidarity, not charity, all over socialist spaces, when it
85160	87060	comes to talking about helping the poor.
87060	88780	London's Young Communist League.
88780	91460	Last weekend we did another food bank collection for Hackney Food Bank.
91460	94380	Members of the public donated a huge amount of food again, and a great amount of support
94380	95380	for us was shown.
95380	96820	Solidarity, not charity.
96820	97940	The Christian Socialists.
97940	101340	At some point, churches are going to have to unlearn how they practice charity, so they
101340	103540	can learn how to practice solidarity.
103540	104640	Community Food Centres Canada.
104640	107960	A single meal or a hundred meals will not solve the hunger crisis.
107960	110340	What we need is not charity, but solidarity.
110340	113740	So let's ask the question, what is the difference between charity and solidarity?
113740	116380	Let's start with two simple definitions and then work our way down.
116380	120620	The practice of charity is the voluntary giving of help to those in need, as a humanitarian
120620	122540	act, unmotivated by self-interest.
122540	126060	There are a number of philosophies about charity often associated with religion.
126060	131140	Meanwhile, solidarity is an awareness of shared interests, objectives, standards, and sympathies,
131140	134180	creating a psychological sense of unity of groups or classes.
134180	136140	It is based on class collaboration.
136140	139700	It refers to the ties in a society that bind people together as one.
139700	143940	This all ties back to, for the 50th time, Marx's essay on the Jewish question, where
143940	147580	he critiques the liberal idea that individuals have the right to be separate from others
147580	151360	and live in their own private affairs, as he believed we were all connected by virtue
151360	155080	of economic transactions, therefore any exchange of goods or money meant that the other party
155080	158900	now had a stake in your behavior, therefore other people had a right to have their nose
158900	159900	in your business.
159900	163500	We've gone over that essay and this idea so many times on this channel, you've got
163500	164500	to know it by now.
164500	168780	Maybe at some point I should devote a video to discussing only this idea and how influential
168780	172500	it is over all of socialism, because it's one of those great linchpins that nobody knows
172500	173500	about.
173500	177540	Upon it rests not only charity not solidarity, but also Gramsci's idea that all cultural
177540	181820	products must be subverted to a socialist goal, or the justification of theft and collective
181820	185500	ownership, or the idea that compromise with the capitalist system will end with the absorption
185500	190260	of the compromiser into capitalism, or really, the rejection of all things liberalistic and
190260	191260	individualistic.
191260	195300	In the context of our topic today, this tweet is the best one I've found that describes
195300	197380	the difference between the two, in a casual sense.
197380	201160	I like the idea of moving from charity and into solidarity with each other.
201160	205400	If my people are suffering and vice versa, we are in direct relationship with each other,
205400	206940	we are each other's business.
206940	210360	On the surface this sounds caring, like we're all looking out for each other, but that phrase
210360	214460	we are each other's business suddenly takes on a very menacing tone the minute you think
214460	216360	of it in the context of privacy.
216360	220260	This idea that we're all connected and therefore the collective of humanity has a stake in
220260	224500	the individual's business is the philosophical basis for both classical fascism and the modern
224500	225940	surveillance state.
225940	229220	Solidarity is an individualistic act, it's when a person voluntarily chooses to give
229220	232200	up something of their own to help the less fortunate out of the goodness of their heart.
232200	235380	But solidarity isn't individualistic, not in this context.
235380	238900	Solidarity is a demand, justified by those eternal connections to each other that Marx
238900	240180	believed we all have.
240180	243700	If you have excess and your fellow man has need, it's not about charity, it's not
243700	248340	about individually choosing to help them and acting virtuously in doing so, it's about
248340	252140	solidarity, it's that your fellow man's need grants him a right to your excess out
252140	254460	of that Marxian connection, out of a sense of solidarity.
254980	258780	And this is how the more mainstream of socialism views charity, this isn't just some twitter
258780	259780	nonsense.
259780	262780	People who perform charitable acts might be good, or maybe they're just trying to maintain
262780	263780	their own station.
263780	264780	It doesn't matter in the end.
264780	268540	Charity, even with the best of intentions, perpetuates capitalism, and so socialists
268540	269540	oppose it.
269540	270540	Here's how.
270540	271540	On this topic, Marx wrote,
271540	275060	The social principles of Christianity preach the necessity of a ruling and an oppressed
275060	279480	class, and all they have for the latter is the pious wish that the former will be charitable.
279480	283340	The social principles of Christianity transfer the counsellor's adjustment of all infamies
283340	286900	to heaven, and thus justify the further existence of those infamies on earth.
286900	290500	The social principles of Christianity declare all vile acts of the oppressors against the
290500	293260	oppressed to be the just punishment of original sin.
293260	297740	The social principles of Christianity preach cowardice, self-contempt, abasement, submission,
297740	298740	dejection.
298740	301940	In a word, all the qualities of riffraff, and the proletariat, not wishing to be treated
301940	306460	as riffraff, needs its courage, its self-reliance, its pride, and its sense of independence more
306460	307460	than its bread.
307460	311180	The social principles of Christianity are sneakish, and the proletariat is revolutionary.
312020	313020	Similarly, Engels also wrote,
313020	316060	The English bourgeoisie is charitable out of self-interest.
316060	319860	It gives nothing outright, but regards its gifts as a business matter, makes a bargain
319860	324260	with the poor, saying, If I spend this much upon benevolent institutions, I thereby purchase
324260	327900	the right not to be troubled any further, and you are bound thereby to stay in your
327900	331660	dusky holes, and not to irritate my tender nerves by exposing your misery.
331660	334560	You shall despair as before, but you shall despair unseen.
334560	337900	This I require, this I purchase, with my subscription of twenty pounds for the infamy.
337900	340660	It is infamous, this charity of Christian bourgeois.
340660	342340	It's not just old socialists, either.
342340	346040	Benjamin Sheppard, professor at the University of New York, wrote the paper, Community Practice
346040	349980	as Social Activism, From Direct Action to Direct Services, where he defines the phrase
349980	353440	mutual aid as people giving what they can and getting what they need, which is quite
353440	357100	similar to Marx's, from each according to his ability, to each according to his needs.
357100	361620	Dean Spade, a socialist trans-revolutionary, meaning he's both personally trans, and
361620	366000	his revolution is trans, and law professor at Seattle University, wrote a 12-page paper
366000	367000	on the topic, too.
367000	368460	Solidarity, not charity.
368460	370060	Mutual aid for mobilization and survival.
370060	373920	And honestly, I could quote any line in that paper to get my point across.
373920	377420	Mutual aid is a more specific term for what socialists want to replace charity, though
377420	379320	it's also older than it sounds.
379320	383240	Kropotkin defined mutual aid as the idea that cooperation within a species is more important
383240	387200	to its evolution than competition, and that those instinctive feelings of solidarity towards
387200	391020	each other, what we would call nowadays as in-group preference, is the basis for mutual
391020	392020	aid.
392020	395300	Kropotkin's view was that an alternative economic system would have to be anti-capitalist
395300	399520	and anti-hierarchy, and would have to distribute goods through a decentralized network of voluntary
399520	402480	associations and also must fulfill the needs of everybody involved.
402480	404660	It's not hard to see how all this is bullshit, right?
404660	408480	Like yeah, that one paper from Spade points out various mutual aid efforts like the Black
408480	412040	Panthers and how they actually manage to collectively come together and help each other materially
412040	413040	when necessary.
413040	414460	And there's dozens of other examples like that.
414460	417620	It's not like these structures can't work, they absolutely can.
417620	419920	Do you help your family and friends when they're in a rough spot?
419920	420920	Sure, of course.
420920	425080	Same with church groups and clubs and on-campus organizations and unions and whatever else.
425080	428400	People are absolutely willing to help others they know, but that's just charity with
428400	429400	a different word.
429400	432920	It becomes solidarity instead of charity when it becomes mutual aid.
432920	435860	That's when you're helping people you don't know as if you know them.
435860	438040	Not that you help them a little bit, like you're giving to the poor, but that you
438040	439840	help them a lot because you know them personally.
439840	442560	You help them as if they are close to you when they are not.
442560	444540	And for most people, that's a hard sell.
444540	448720	This is why Marxist ideas and practice always involve force, because give what you can and
448720	453140	get what you need sounds nice on paper until you realize that it has no defense against
453140	454260	the free rider problem.
454260	457980	The idea that some people will simply take and not give back under the pretense of needing
457980	460220	much and not being able to give anything at all.
460220	463860	At that point, either the system collapses or the people in power begin to use oppressive
463860	466420	methods to ensure that the voluntary giving continues.
466420	470040	I want to make it perfectly clear here, I'm not against the idea of mutual aid.
470040	473500	If you've got some collective organization that you give your time to and help the poor
473500	474500	with, more power to you.
474500	475900	I've done it a few times myself.
475900	480660	But when people are explicitly rejecting charity in favor of mutual aid, despite the obvious
480660	484720	practical overlap between the two, they're sending a message that giving what is yours
484720	488480	out of the kindness of your heart is not enough because what is yours, you stole and
488480	489940	the poor have a right to it.
489940	493380	In giving, you are not being a good person, you are rectifying a wrong you committed.
493380	494940	It's not good, it's the baseline.
494940	498320	I know at least a few people from DGG also watch my content, post in the comments if
498320	499320	you do.
499320	500320	You guys remember this debate, right?
500320	503960	Leftist jumps in to debate and gatekeep Destiny from IRL activism?
503960	507600	This was in the context of Destiny using his platform to assist in canvassing efforts for
507600	510980	the mayoral race in his hometown of Omaha, despite having moved away to LA.
510980	514780	And an anarcho-communist who was still back in Omaha was extremely angry about his involvement
514780	516000	for a bunch of different reasons.
516000	517940	But listen to some of the rhetoric that this guy uses.
517940	520680	You don't think that any of the churches, you don't think that any of the church communities
520680	523700	around Omaha are involved in helping in any of the local soup kitchens?
523700	524700	Or involved in helping-
524700	526700	It's fucking transactional.
526700	527700	It's transactional.
527700	531260	So, so, wow, so it really, do you think, do you think that when a person, I'm just, I'm
531260	534060	super curious in your opinion, do you think that when a person is getting a meal to eat
534060	537320	that they otherwise wouldn't in a city like Omaha, do you think they care if the organization
537320	540840	giving it to them is doing it for some transaction with God or something?
540840	543720	No, we're not talking about the person receiving aid.
543720	546400	We're talking about the people that are giving the aid.
546400	549520	Who cares about the people that are giving the aid as long as they're doing it?
549520	552960	When I was volunteering for high school, I don't remember anybody turning down a meal
552960	557040	that we served or turning down a sandwich that we handed out because it was compulsory.
557040	561120	I'm saying that your charity that you were doing was charity.
561120	564480	It was, it was given from the top down.
564480	568680	Did the community request that your church come out and give them food or did they just
568680	570180	request food?
570180	573760	So then why do you have to make it a transactional approach?
573760	578080	I guess like the way that I look at it at the end of the day, yeah, we might just have
578080	579080	different values.
579080	581720	At the end of the day, for me, the more people that are getting fed, the better.
581720	587160	How much money have you spent on your efforts to mobilize voters or whatever it is you call?
587160	590520	When the other three major candidates running in this race want to publish all their figures,
590520	593820	I mean, I'll publish mine, but I don't see why I need to answer that question.
593820	595180	What you have spent.
595180	596180	I don't know why.
596180	597540	I don't know why I need to answer that question.
597540	600300	What's the implication?
600300	602500	How much food that could have provided?
602500	603500	I don't.
603500	604820	Do you really think it's like one to one like that?
604820	608100	Do you think that no money can be spent on political advocacy if there's like a hungry
608100	611140	person or you don't think that there might be more money that could be spent getting
611140	614060	somebody in office that might be able to address these problems rather than just buying a meal
614060	615480	for somebody?
615480	620040	I think we're better off not fucking waiting for you fucking libs to tie your fucking shoes
620040	622320	and get on the streets and do the fucking work.
622320	625460	If this is a video you remember, I recommend you go back and watch it again with some of
625460	627640	this knowledge about how socialists view charity.
627640	628800	It'll open your eyes.
628800	633140	The reason this guy sounded so nonsensical is because he genuinely believes that charity
633140	637340	perpetuates capitalism, that electoralism and liberal institutions have entirely failed.
637340	640920	And the only way to help people is through decentralized mutual aid structures that local
640920	644320	communities must build to replace the state with anarcho communism.
644320	647300	Broadly speaking, there are two leftist views of mutual aid.
647300	651220	The first view is what's held by that Omaha brainlet, where out of a sense of solidarity,
651220	655640	they reject both charity and the social safety nets of a liberal society believing that their
655640	659700	way is the only way to truly liberate people since charity presupposes the correctness
659700	664800	of capitalism while safety nets rely on electoralism, which will always be a failed system for socialists.
664800	668360	The second view of mutual aid is that the state itself should be its mechanism.
668360	672000	This view conflates the social safety net with mutual aid, making them one in the same.
672000	675840	It's from this point of view that we get the idea that you have a moral obligation to pay
675840	680040	your taxes because that's ultimately the same moral obligation that drives you to perform
680040	681120	charitable acts.
681120	684660	This view is at least a little more justifiable than the first one, because it is true that
684660	688420	poor people benefit from those programs, while the only thing that socialist bumble fucks
688420	691740	have ever built using the first system is stuff that is ultimately destructive like
691740	692740	Chaz.
692740	696700	This second view of mutual aid stems from Clement Attlee, the architect of the modern
696700	701460	British welfare state, who famously said, charity is a cold, grey, loveless thing.
701460	705620	If a rich man wants to help the poor, he should pay his taxes gladly, not dole out money at
705620	706620	a whim.
706620	710020	The problem with this point of view, though, is that it implies the government is responsible
710020	712760	for feeding, clothing, and housing you, and it's not.
712760	713760	You are.
713760	717040	Imagine thinking that charity, given from one person to another, from the kindness of
717040	722620	their heart, is cold, grey, and loveless, especially compared to a vast impersonal bureaucracy
722620	726400	run by government employees who only need to do the barest of the minimum to keep their
726400	727400	job.
727400	729800	This doesn't mean that I'm against the idea of the welfare state, but I do see it for
729800	730800	what it is.
730800	735240	It's not some grand moral project to which we should swear our undying allegiance to.
735240	737400	It's a practical solution to a real world problem.
737400	740900	We should not love our governments the way we love our families, even when governments
740900	741900	do good work.
741900	746740	And knowing that is what makes the UK's sacrifice for the good of the NHS rhetoric so eerie
746740	748140	looking at it from the outside.
748140	750580	The NHS isn't your mother, it's a bureaucracy.
750580	753660	It might be a good system, even a necessary one, but it's not a person.
753660	756180	Plus, imagine the moral implications of Attlee's statement.
756180	759740	Yes, Engels said that some people use charity as a way to make themselves feel better about
759740	760740	the state of the poor.
760740	762740	They paid a few bucks and now they expect the poor to shut up.
762740	766400	That's a fair criticism, but Attlee's statement creates an inverse situation.
766400	770180	If taxation is the only avenue through which the rich can fulfill his duty to help the
770180	773440	poor, then if a rich man has paid up all of his taxes and he sees a beggar on the street,
773440	776220	he is now under no moral obligation to give him anything.
776220	779220	He's already done his part, and charity is cold and impersonal besides.
779220	780960	What further good is there in helping?
780960	782120	It's a nonsense position.
782120	786620	In fact, it seems to be the case that charity is superior, at least morally, specifically
786620	788500	because it is done voluntarily.
788500	791900	It's not done because the person who is giving is guilty, like with solidarity.
791900	795540	It's not done as a part of building the post-capitalist utopia, like with mutual aid.
795540	799460	And it's not done out of the threat of state retaliation, like with taxation.
799460	803120	It could be done as a way to bolster the person's standing, sure, but there's still a moral
803120	805120	component deep underneath that.
805120	810160	Valuing being a person who does real charitable acts is not too far off from valuing doing
810160	812120	real charitable acts, at least on some level.
812120	816140	You could say no to donating, but the fact that you chose not to, that is where the extra
816140	820260	moral content of charity exists that isn't present in these other methods of helping
820260	821260	the poor.
821260	824580	The virtue is in letting go of what is valuable so that others might be helped, not holding
824620	828120	onto it for your own selfish reasons, nor having it demanded from you by somebody who
828120	829120	is self-righteous.
829120	833120	I've said many times in this channel that socialism is just institutionalized theft.
833120	836500	If you live in a society where it's normal to point at whoever has more than you and
836500	840820	call them a capitalist oppressor, a counter-revolutionary, a bourgeois, a kulak, and then use those
840820	844960	labels as moral justification to steal from them, the people living in that society will
844960	848420	train each other to belittle and hate and use their own victimization.
848420	851980	Eventually, society becomes a constant struggle of selfishness, where everybody owns everything
851980	854180	collectively so why not just take everything you see?
854780	855780	You already own it.
855780	856780	But charity begets compassion.
856780	860540	To see a person suffering, to watch as their suffering is alleviated by a simple random
860540	861540	act of kindness.
861540	865300	It's hard to hate a person you have compassion for, it's hard to take from others when
865300	866300	you know how they feel.
866300	869580	But it's easy to hate them and take from them if you feel like you've been victimized
869580	870580	by them.
870580	873820	Charity's got its problems, Engle's critique was at least kind of correct, but like with
873820	878460	all other socialist critiques, as they discover and describe real problems, their solutions
878460	880580	make things a million times worse.
880580	884540	We should have a social safety net, and we should have mutual aid organizations, but
884540	886180	we also should have charity.
886180	889860	If anybody on the left ever tells you that charity is bad, it's a pretty good sign
889860	892800	that they don't actually give a shit about the people they claim to advocate for, beyond
892800	893700	using them as pawns.
