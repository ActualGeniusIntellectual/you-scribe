00:00.000 --> 00:08.640
Why is it that Socialists seem to hate charity?

00:08.640 --> 00:09.880
That's the topic of the video today.

00:09.880 --> 00:12.220
I presume you already know that though, you're the one who clicked on it.

00:12.220 --> 00:14.060
It sounds paradoxical in the face of it.

00:14.060 --> 00:17.680
Why would the people who claim to advocate for the poor and the downtrodden working class

00:17.680 --> 00:22.040
be against the idea of giving charity to that very same working class who need it?

00:22.040 --> 00:26.400
Doesn't their desire to help stem from harm reduction principles and caring for the vulnerable?

00:26.400 --> 00:27.740
Why would they be against charity?

00:27.740 --> 00:30.740
As usual, this exchange on Twitter got me interested in the topic.

00:30.740 --> 00:35.060
Chris Freeman is poking a bit of fun at Karl Marx by comparing the Marxist position of

00:35.060 --> 00:40.240
reject the bourgeois ethic of individual giving with Marx's own tendency to beg for money

00:40.240 --> 00:41.620
from Friedrich Engels.

00:41.620 --> 00:44.900
If you watch my channel regularly, this should sound pretty familiar to you.

00:44.900 --> 00:49.180
In an earlier video, where I dug down into the idea that Socialists are mad against God

00:49.180 --> 00:52.680
for the crime of being, a quote of Jordan Peterson's, we discovered that what motivates

00:52.680 --> 00:55.100
Socialists isn't actually a love of the poor.

00:55.100 --> 00:58.980
At the end of the video, I read to you letters from Heinrich Marx, Karl Marx's father,

00:58.980 --> 01:03.320
who chastised him repeatedly for ignoring his family unless he needed money from them.

01:03.320 --> 01:06.980
Many Marxists follow in his footsteps, from his lifelong depression, to his tendency to

01:06.980 --> 01:10.500
manipulate others, to his constant mooching off of everybody around him.

01:10.500 --> 01:12.820
Where it was once his dad, it later became Engels.

01:12.820 --> 01:14.500
Which is what Freeman is poking fun at.

01:14.500 --> 01:15.820
But check out this reply.

01:15.820 --> 01:18.140
What you read is solidarity, not charity.

01:18.140 --> 01:20.780
This is stressed by many leftists, but you weren't paying attention.

01:20.780 --> 01:25.160
You'll find that slogan, solidarity, not charity, all over socialist spaces, when it

01:25.160 --> 01:27.060
comes to talking about helping the poor.

01:27.060 --> 01:28.780
London's Young Communist League.

01:28.780 --> 01:31.460
Last weekend we did another food bank collection for Hackney Food Bank.

01:31.460 --> 01:34.380
Members of the public donated a huge amount of food again, and a great amount of support

01:34.380 --> 01:35.380
for us was shown.

01:35.380 --> 01:36.820
Solidarity, not charity.

01:36.820 --> 01:37.940
The Christian Socialists.

01:37.940 --> 01:41.340
At some point, churches are going to have to unlearn how they practice charity, so they

01:41.340 --> 01:43.540
can learn how to practice solidarity.

01:43.540 --> 01:44.640
Community Food Centres Canada.

01:44.640 --> 01:47.960
A single meal or a hundred meals will not solve the hunger crisis.

01:47.960 --> 01:50.340
What we need is not charity, but solidarity.

01:50.340 --> 01:53.740
So let's ask the question, what is the difference between charity and solidarity?

01:53.740 --> 01:56.380
Let's start with two simple definitions and then work our way down.

01:56.380 --> 02:00.620
The practice of charity is the voluntary giving of help to those in need, as a humanitarian

02:00.620 --> 02:02.540
act, unmotivated by self-interest.

02:02.540 --> 02:06.060
There are a number of philosophies about charity often associated with religion.

02:06.060 --> 02:11.140
Meanwhile, solidarity is an awareness of shared interests, objectives, standards, and sympathies,

02:11.140 --> 02:14.180
creating a psychological sense of unity of groups or classes.

02:14.180 --> 02:16.140
It is based on class collaboration.

02:16.140 --> 02:19.700
It refers to the ties in a society that bind people together as one.

02:19.700 --> 02:23.940
This all ties back to, for the 50th time, Marx's essay on the Jewish question, where

02:23.940 --> 02:27.580
he critiques the liberal idea that individuals have the right to be separate from others

02:27.580 --> 02:31.360
and live in their own private affairs, as he believed we were all connected by virtue

02:31.360 --> 02:35.080
of economic transactions, therefore any exchange of goods or money meant that the other party

02:35.080 --> 02:38.900
now had a stake in your behavior, therefore other people had a right to have their nose

02:38.900 --> 02:39.900
in your business.

02:39.900 --> 02:43.500
We've gone over that essay and this idea so many times on this channel, you've got

02:43.500 --> 02:44.500
to know it by now.

02:44.500 --> 02:48.780
Maybe at some point I should devote a video to discussing only this idea and how influential

02:48.780 --> 02:52.500
it is over all of socialism, because it's one of those great linchpins that nobody knows

02:52.500 --> 02:53.500
about.

02:53.500 --> 02:57.540
Upon it rests not only charity not solidarity, but also Gramsci's idea that all cultural

02:57.540 --> 03:01.820
products must be subverted to a socialist goal, or the justification of theft and collective

03:01.820 --> 03:05.500
ownership, or the idea that compromise with the capitalist system will end with the absorption

03:05.500 --> 03:10.260
of the compromiser into capitalism, or really, the rejection of all things liberalistic and

03:10.260 --> 03:11.260
individualistic.

03:11.260 --> 03:15.300
In the context of our topic today, this tweet is the best one I've found that describes

03:15.300 --> 03:17.380
the difference between the two, in a casual sense.

03:17.380 --> 03:21.160
I like the idea of moving from charity and into solidarity with each other.

03:21.160 --> 03:25.400
If my people are suffering and vice versa, we are in direct relationship with each other,

03:25.400 --> 03:26.940
we are each other's business.

03:26.940 --> 03:30.360
On the surface this sounds caring, like we're all looking out for each other, but that phrase

03:30.360 --> 03:34.460
we are each other's business suddenly takes on a very menacing tone the minute you think

03:34.460 --> 03:36.360
of it in the context of privacy.

03:36.360 --> 03:40.260
This idea that we're all connected and therefore the collective of humanity has a stake in

03:40.260 --> 03:44.500
the individual's business is the philosophical basis for both classical fascism and the modern

03:44.500 --> 03:45.940
surveillance state.

03:45.940 --> 03:49.220
Solidarity is an individualistic act, it's when a person voluntarily chooses to give

03:49.220 --> 03:52.200
up something of their own to help the less fortunate out of the goodness of their heart.

03:52.200 --> 03:55.380
But solidarity isn't individualistic, not in this context.

03:55.380 --> 03:58.900
Solidarity is a demand, justified by those eternal connections to each other that Marx

03:58.900 --> 04:00.180
believed we all have.

04:00.180 --> 04:03.700
If you have excess and your fellow man has need, it's not about charity, it's not

04:03.700 --> 04:08.340
about individually choosing to help them and acting virtuously in doing so, it's about

04:08.340 --> 04:12.140
solidarity, it's that your fellow man's need grants him a right to your excess out

04:12.140 --> 04:14.460
of that Marxian connection, out of a sense of solidarity.

04:14.980 --> 04:18.780
And this is how the more mainstream of socialism views charity, this isn't just some twitter

04:18.780 --> 04:19.780
nonsense.

04:19.780 --> 04:22.780
People who perform charitable acts might be good, or maybe they're just trying to maintain

04:22.780 --> 04:23.780
their own station.

04:23.780 --> 04:24.780
It doesn't matter in the end.

04:24.780 --> 04:28.540
Charity, even with the best of intentions, perpetuates capitalism, and so socialists

04:28.540 --> 04:29.540
oppose it.

04:29.540 --> 04:30.540
Here's how.

04:30.540 --> 04:31.540
On this topic, Marx wrote,

04:31.540 --> 04:35.060
The social principles of Christianity preach the necessity of a ruling and an oppressed

04:35.060 --> 04:39.480
class, and all they have for the latter is the pious wish that the former will be charitable.

04:39.480 --> 04:43.340
The social principles of Christianity transfer the counsellor's adjustment of all infamies

04:43.340 --> 04:46.900
to heaven, and thus justify the further existence of those infamies on earth.

04:46.900 --> 04:50.500
The social principles of Christianity declare all vile acts of the oppressors against the

04:50.500 --> 04:53.260
oppressed to be the just punishment of original sin.

04:53.260 --> 04:57.740
The social principles of Christianity preach cowardice, self-contempt, abasement, submission,

04:57.740 --> 04:58.740
dejection.

04:58.740 --> 05:01.940
In a word, all the qualities of riffraff, and the proletariat, not wishing to be treated

05:01.940 --> 05:06.460
as riffraff, needs its courage, its self-reliance, its pride, and its sense of independence more

05:06.460 --> 05:07.460
than its bread.

05:07.460 --> 05:11.180
The social principles of Christianity are sneakish, and the proletariat is revolutionary.

05:12.020 --> 05:13.020
Similarly, Engels also wrote,

05:13.020 --> 05:16.060
The English bourgeoisie is charitable out of self-interest.

05:16.060 --> 05:19.860
It gives nothing outright, but regards its gifts as a business matter, makes a bargain

05:19.860 --> 05:24.260
with the poor, saying, If I spend this much upon benevolent institutions, I thereby purchase

05:24.260 --> 05:27.900
the right not to be troubled any further, and you are bound thereby to stay in your

05:27.900 --> 05:31.660
dusky holes, and not to irritate my tender nerves by exposing your misery.

05:31.660 --> 05:34.560
You shall despair as before, but you shall despair unseen.

05:34.560 --> 05:37.900
This I require, this I purchase, with my subscription of twenty pounds for the infamy.

05:37.900 --> 05:40.660
It is infamous, this charity of Christian bourgeois.

05:40.660 --> 05:42.340
It's not just old socialists, either.

05:42.340 --> 05:46.040
Benjamin Sheppard, professor at the University of New York, wrote the paper, Community Practice

05:46.040 --> 05:49.980
as Social Activism, From Direct Action to Direct Services, where he defines the phrase

05:49.980 --> 05:53.440
mutual aid as people giving what they can and getting what they need, which is quite

05:53.440 --> 05:57.100
similar to Marx's, from each according to his ability, to each according to his needs.

05:57.100 --> 06:01.620
Dean Spade, a socialist trans-revolutionary, meaning he's both personally trans, and

06:01.620 --> 06:06.000
his revolution is trans, and law professor at Seattle University, wrote a 12-page paper

06:06.000 --> 06:07.000
on the topic, too.

06:07.000 --> 06:08.460
Solidarity, not charity.

06:08.460 --> 06:10.060
Mutual aid for mobilization and survival.

06:10.060 --> 06:13.920
And honestly, I could quote any line in that paper to get my point across.

06:13.920 --> 06:17.420
Mutual aid is a more specific term for what socialists want to replace charity, though

06:17.420 --> 06:19.320
it's also older than it sounds.

06:19.320 --> 06:23.240
Kropotkin defined mutual aid as the idea that cooperation within a species is more important

06:23.240 --> 06:27.200
to its evolution than competition, and that those instinctive feelings of solidarity towards

06:27.200 --> 06:31.020
each other, what we would call nowadays as in-group preference, is the basis for mutual

06:31.020 --> 06:32.020
aid.

06:32.020 --> 06:35.300
Kropotkin's view was that an alternative economic system would have to be anti-capitalist

06:35.300 --> 06:39.520
and anti-hierarchy, and would have to distribute goods through a decentralized network of voluntary

06:39.520 --> 06:42.480
associations and also must fulfill the needs of everybody involved.

06:42.480 --> 06:44.660
It's not hard to see how all this is bullshit, right?

06:44.660 --> 06:48.480
Like yeah, that one paper from Spade points out various mutual aid efforts like the Black

06:48.480 --> 06:52.040
Panthers and how they actually manage to collectively come together and help each other materially

06:52.040 --> 06:53.040
when necessary.

06:53.040 --> 06:54.460
And there's dozens of other examples like that.

06:54.460 --> 06:57.620
It's not like these structures can't work, they absolutely can.

06:57.620 --> 06:59.920
Do you help your family and friends when they're in a rough spot?

06:59.920 --> 07:00.920
Sure, of course.

07:00.920 --> 07:05.080
Same with church groups and clubs and on-campus organizations and unions and whatever else.

07:05.080 --> 07:08.400
People are absolutely willing to help others they know, but that's just charity with

07:08.400 --> 07:09.400
a different word.

07:09.400 --> 07:12.920
It becomes solidarity instead of charity when it becomes mutual aid.

07:12.920 --> 07:15.860
That's when you're helping people you don't know as if you know them.

07:15.860 --> 07:18.040
Not that you help them a little bit, like you're giving to the poor, but that you

07:18.040 --> 07:19.840
help them a lot because you know them personally.

07:19.840 --> 07:22.560
You help them as if they are close to you when they are not.

07:22.560 --> 07:24.540
And for most people, that's a hard sell.

07:24.540 --> 07:28.720
This is why Marxist ideas and practice always involve force, because give what you can and

07:28.720 --> 07:33.140
get what you need sounds nice on paper until you realize that it has no defense against

07:33.140 --> 07:34.260
the free rider problem.

07:34.260 --> 07:37.980
The idea that some people will simply take and not give back under the pretense of needing

07:37.980 --> 07:40.220
much and not being able to give anything at all.

07:40.220 --> 07:43.860
At that point, either the system collapses or the people in power begin to use oppressive

07:43.860 --> 07:46.420
methods to ensure that the voluntary giving continues.

07:46.420 --> 07:50.040
I want to make it perfectly clear here, I'm not against the idea of mutual aid.

07:50.040 --> 07:53.500
If you've got some collective organization that you give your time to and help the poor

07:53.500 --> 07:54.500
with, more power to you.

07:54.500 --> 07:55.900
I've done it a few times myself.

07:55.900 --> 08:00.660
But when people are explicitly rejecting charity in favor of mutual aid, despite the obvious

08:00.660 --> 08:04.720
practical overlap between the two, they're sending a message that giving what is yours

08:04.720 --> 08:08.480
out of the kindness of your heart is not enough because what is yours, you stole and

08:08.480 --> 08:09.940
the poor have a right to it.

08:09.940 --> 08:13.380
In giving, you are not being a good person, you are rectifying a wrong you committed.

08:13.380 --> 08:14.940
It's not good, it's the baseline.

08:14.940 --> 08:18.320
I know at least a few people from DGG also watch my content, post in the comments if

08:18.320 --> 08:19.320
you do.

08:19.320 --> 08:20.320
You guys remember this debate, right?

08:20.320 --> 08:23.960
Leftist jumps in to debate and gatekeep Destiny from IRL activism?

08:23.960 --> 08:27.600
This was in the context of Destiny using his platform to assist in canvassing efforts for

08:27.600 --> 08:30.980
the mayoral race in his hometown of Omaha, despite having moved away to LA.

08:30.980 --> 08:34.780
And an anarcho-communist who was still back in Omaha was extremely angry about his involvement

08:34.780 --> 08:36.000
for a bunch of different reasons.

08:36.000 --> 08:37.940
But listen to some of the rhetoric that this guy uses.

08:37.940 --> 08:40.680
You don't think that any of the churches, you don't think that any of the church communities

08:40.680 --> 08:43.700
around Omaha are involved in helping in any of the local soup kitchens?

08:43.700 --> 08:44.700
Or involved in helping-

08:44.700 --> 08:46.700
It's fucking transactional.

08:46.700 --> 08:47.700
It's transactional.

08:47.700 --> 08:51.260
So, so, wow, so it really, do you think, do you think that when a person, I'm just, I'm

08:51.260 --> 08:54.060
super curious in your opinion, do you think that when a person is getting a meal to eat

08:54.060 --> 08:57.320
that they otherwise wouldn't in a city like Omaha, do you think they care if the organization

08:57.320 --> 09:00.840
giving it to them is doing it for some transaction with God or something?

09:00.840 --> 09:03.720
No, we're not talking about the person receiving aid.

09:03.720 --> 09:06.400
We're talking about the people that are giving the aid.

09:06.400 --> 09:09.520
Who cares about the people that are giving the aid as long as they're doing it?

09:09.520 --> 09:12.960
When I was volunteering for high school, I don't remember anybody turning down a meal

09:12.960 --> 09:17.040
that we served or turning down a sandwich that we handed out because it was compulsory.

09:17.040 --> 09:21.120
I'm saying that your charity that you were doing was charity.

09:21.120 --> 09:24.480
It was, it was given from the top down.

09:24.480 --> 09:28.680
Did the community request that your church come out and give them food or did they just

09:28.680 --> 09:30.180
request food?

09:30.180 --> 09:33.760
So then why do you have to make it a transactional approach?

09:33.760 --> 09:38.080
I guess like the way that I look at it at the end of the day, yeah, we might just have

09:38.080 --> 09:39.080
different values.

09:39.080 --> 09:41.720
At the end of the day, for me, the more people that are getting fed, the better.

09:41.720 --> 09:47.160
How much money have you spent on your efforts to mobilize voters or whatever it is you call?

09:47.160 --> 09:50.520
When the other three major candidates running in this race want to publish all their figures,

09:50.520 --> 09:53.820
I mean, I'll publish mine, but I don't see why I need to answer that question.

09:53.820 --> 09:55.180
What you have spent.

09:55.180 --> 09:56.180
I don't know why.

09:56.180 --> 09:57.540
I don't know why I need to answer that question.

09:57.540 --> 10:00.300
What's the implication?

10:00.300 --> 10:02.500
How much food that could have provided?

10:02.500 --> 10:03.500
I don't.

10:03.500 --> 10:04.820
Do you really think it's like one to one like that?

10:04.820 --> 10:08.100
Do you think that no money can be spent on political advocacy if there's like a hungry

10:08.100 --> 10:11.140
person or you don't think that there might be more money that could be spent getting

10:11.140 --> 10:14.060
somebody in office that might be able to address these problems rather than just buying a meal

10:14.060 --> 10:15.480
for somebody?

10:15.480 --> 10:20.040
I think we're better off not fucking waiting for you fucking libs to tie your fucking shoes

10:20.040 --> 10:22.320
and get on the streets and do the fucking work.

10:22.320 --> 10:25.460
If this is a video you remember, I recommend you go back and watch it again with some of

10:25.460 --> 10:27.640
this knowledge about how socialists view charity.

10:27.640 --> 10:28.800
It'll open your eyes.

10:28.800 --> 10:33.140
The reason this guy sounded so nonsensical is because he genuinely believes that charity

10:33.140 --> 10:37.340
perpetuates capitalism, that electoralism and liberal institutions have entirely failed.

10:37.340 --> 10:40.920
And the only way to help people is through decentralized mutual aid structures that local

10:40.920 --> 10:44.320
communities must build to replace the state with anarcho communism.

10:44.320 --> 10:47.300
Broadly speaking, there are two leftist views of mutual aid.

10:47.300 --> 10:51.220
The first view is what's held by that Omaha brainlet, where out of a sense of solidarity,

10:51.220 --> 10:55.640
they reject both charity and the social safety nets of a liberal society believing that their

10:55.640 --> 10:59.700
way is the only way to truly liberate people since charity presupposes the correctness

10:59.700 --> 11:04.800
of capitalism while safety nets rely on electoralism, which will always be a failed system for socialists.

11:04.800 --> 11:08.360
The second view of mutual aid is that the state itself should be its mechanism.

11:08.360 --> 11:12.000
This view conflates the social safety net with mutual aid, making them one in the same.

11:12.000 --> 11:15.840
It's from this point of view that we get the idea that you have a moral obligation to pay

11:15.840 --> 11:20.040
your taxes because that's ultimately the same moral obligation that drives you to perform

11:20.040 --> 11:21.120
charitable acts.

11:21.120 --> 11:24.660
This view is at least a little more justifiable than the first one, because it is true that

11:24.660 --> 11:28.420
poor people benefit from those programs, while the only thing that socialist bumble fucks

11:28.420 --> 11:31.740
have ever built using the first system is stuff that is ultimately destructive like

11:31.740 --> 11:32.740
Chaz.

11:32.740 --> 11:36.700
This second view of mutual aid stems from Clement Attlee, the architect of the modern

11:36.700 --> 11:41.460
British welfare state, who famously said, charity is a cold, grey, loveless thing.

11:41.460 --> 11:45.620
If a rich man wants to help the poor, he should pay his taxes gladly, not dole out money at

11:45.620 --> 11:46.620
a whim.

11:46.620 --> 11:50.020
The problem with this point of view, though, is that it implies the government is responsible

11:50.020 --> 11:52.760
for feeding, clothing, and housing you, and it's not.

11:52.760 --> 11:53.760
You are.

11:53.760 --> 11:57.040
Imagine thinking that charity, given from one person to another, from the kindness of

11:57.040 --> 12:02.620
their heart, is cold, grey, and loveless, especially compared to a vast impersonal bureaucracy

12:02.620 --> 12:06.400
run by government employees who only need to do the barest of the minimum to keep their

12:06.400 --> 12:07.400
job.

12:07.400 --> 12:09.800
This doesn't mean that I'm against the idea of the welfare state, but I do see it for

12:09.800 --> 12:10.800
what it is.

12:10.800 --> 12:15.240
It's not some grand moral project to which we should swear our undying allegiance to.

12:15.240 --> 12:17.400
It's a practical solution to a real world problem.

12:17.400 --> 12:20.900
We should not love our governments the way we love our families, even when governments

12:20.900 --> 12:21.900
do good work.

12:21.900 --> 12:26.740
And knowing that is what makes the UK's sacrifice for the good of the NHS rhetoric so eerie

12:26.740 --> 12:28.140
looking at it from the outside.

12:28.140 --> 12:30.580
The NHS isn't your mother, it's a bureaucracy.

12:30.580 --> 12:33.660
It might be a good system, even a necessary one, but it's not a person.

12:33.660 --> 12:36.180
Plus, imagine the moral implications of Attlee's statement.

12:36.180 --> 12:39.740
Yes, Engels said that some people use charity as a way to make themselves feel better about

12:39.740 --> 12:40.740
the state of the poor.

12:40.740 --> 12:42.740
They paid a few bucks and now they expect the poor to shut up.

12:42.740 --> 12:46.400
That's a fair criticism, but Attlee's statement creates an inverse situation.

12:46.400 --> 12:50.180
If taxation is the only avenue through which the rich can fulfill his duty to help the

12:50.180 --> 12:53.440
poor, then if a rich man has paid up all of his taxes and he sees a beggar on the street,

12:53.440 --> 12:56.220
he is now under no moral obligation to give him anything.

12:56.220 --> 12:59.220
He's already done his part, and charity is cold and impersonal besides.

12:59.220 --> 13:00.960
What further good is there in helping?

13:00.960 --> 13:02.120
It's a nonsense position.

13:02.120 --> 13:06.620
In fact, it seems to be the case that charity is superior, at least morally, specifically

13:06.620 --> 13:08.500
because it is done voluntarily.

13:08.500 --> 13:11.900
It's not done because the person who is giving is guilty, like with solidarity.

13:11.900 --> 13:15.540
It's not done as a part of building the post-capitalist utopia, like with mutual aid.

13:15.540 --> 13:19.460
And it's not done out of the threat of state retaliation, like with taxation.

13:19.460 --> 13:23.120
It could be done as a way to bolster the person's standing, sure, but there's still a moral

13:23.120 --> 13:25.120
component deep underneath that.

13:25.120 --> 13:30.160
Valuing being a person who does real charitable acts is not too far off from valuing doing

13:30.160 --> 13:32.120
real charitable acts, at least on some level.

13:32.120 --> 13:36.140
You could say no to donating, but the fact that you chose not to, that is where the extra

13:36.140 --> 13:40.260
moral content of charity exists that isn't present in these other methods of helping

13:40.260 --> 13:41.260
the poor.

13:41.260 --> 13:44.580
The virtue is in letting go of what is valuable so that others might be helped, not holding

13:44.620 --> 13:48.120
onto it for your own selfish reasons, nor having it demanded from you by somebody who

13:48.120 --> 13:49.120
is self-righteous.

13:49.120 --> 13:53.120
I've said many times in this channel that socialism is just institutionalized theft.

13:53.120 --> 13:56.500
If you live in a society where it's normal to point at whoever has more than you and

13:56.500 --> 14:00.820
call them a capitalist oppressor, a counter-revolutionary, a bourgeois, a kulak, and then use those

14:00.820 --> 14:04.960
labels as moral justification to steal from them, the people living in that society will

14:04.960 --> 14:08.420
train each other to belittle and hate and use their own victimization.

14:08.420 --> 14:11.980
Eventually, society becomes a constant struggle of selfishness, where everybody owns everything

14:11.980 --> 14:14.180
collectively so why not just take everything you see?

14:14.780 --> 14:15.780
You already own it.

14:15.780 --> 14:16.780
But charity begets compassion.

14:16.780 --> 14:20.540
To see a person suffering, to watch as their suffering is alleviated by a simple random

14:20.540 --> 14:21.540
act of kindness.

14:21.540 --> 14:25.300
It's hard to hate a person you have compassion for, it's hard to take from others when

14:25.300 --> 14:26.300
you know how they feel.

14:26.300 --> 14:29.580
But it's easy to hate them and take from them if you feel like you've been victimized

14:29.580 --> 14:30.580
by them.

14:30.580 --> 14:33.820
Charity's got its problems, Engle's critique was at least kind of correct, but like with

14:33.820 --> 14:38.460
all other socialist critiques, as they discover and describe real problems, their solutions

14:38.460 --> 14:40.580
make things a million times worse.

14:40.580 --> 14:44.540
We should have a social safety net, and we should have mutual aid organizations, but

14:44.540 --> 14:46.180
we also should have charity.

14:46.180 --> 14:49.860
If anybody on the left ever tells you that charity is bad, it's a pretty good sign

14:49.860 --> 14:52.800
that they don't actually give a shit about the people they claim to advocate for, beyond

14:52.800 --> 14:53.700
using them as pawns.
