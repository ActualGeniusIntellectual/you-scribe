00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,640
Hey, is it one of those dev videos where we start off with some viral nonsense, but by

2
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:12,480
the end of the video attempt to drill down deep at some underlying ethic?

3
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:13,480
Yeah, it's one of those!

4
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:14,480
Let's roll the clip!

5
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:25,600
So this raggedy ass bitch just came into Erotic and stole from my store, and we're gonna follow

6
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:30,800
her to her house because she says she's gonna pay for it there, right?

7
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:31,800
Yes.

8
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:37,680
Okay, so enjoy the ride and we'll let you know where she lives.

9
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:42,720
Let's play a game called Look in the Thief's Purse, so let's see what she has.

10
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:43,720
Stop.

11
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:44,720
Oh, she also took a skirt, Justin.

12
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:45,720
Did you see that?

13
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:46,720
What?

14
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:47,720
Yeah.

15
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:48,720
You raggedy bitch.

16
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:57,980
You look at me like I'm crazy and you stole from me, the irony, right?

17
00:00:57,980 --> 00:01:00,800
Don't steal from small businesses, Okie.

18
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:05,040
In case you don't get what's going on, this viral TikTok was shot by the owner of a local

19
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,040
shop.

20
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:07,040
That's the woman in red.

21
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,040
The other lady, she's a thief.

22
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:11,240
The store owner caught her shoplifting and decided to abandon her store to follow the

23
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:13,740
thief onto the bus where she made this video.

24
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:15,920
And by the end, yeah, the thief was arrested.

25
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:18,200
On the one hand, there's a big old justice boner here.

26
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:21,440
The thief thinks she can shoplift, she gets caught, justice is served.

27
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:25,320
On the other, some people are saying that going so far as to leave your own storefront

28
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:27,560
and follow her back to her house is pretty wild.

29
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:31,720
Did you even lock up shop lady or is the door wide open with nobody holding down the fort

30
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:32,720
back there?

31
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:35,880
Also, it's just really funny that she runs a sex shop and the item being stolen was some

32
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:38,360
type of sexy clothing, trashy people all around.

33
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:42,560
But the important part is what some of the replies are saying, like check this shit out.

34
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:45,160
Small business owners are not a necessary part of society.

35
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:46,880
They have far too much self-importance.

36
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:50,160
If you can't afford to have shoplifters at your business, you can't afford to have a

37
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:51,160
business.

38
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:52,520
Maybe spend less on fancy coffee.

39
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:55,000
My whole thing is, don't you have insurance?

40
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,160
Shrinks should be built into your budget because this is just kind of strange.

41
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:59,300
Shoplifting is moral and good.

42
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:01,240
Why are people applauding this?

43
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:03,940
Stealing from a shop isn't the same as stealing from a person.

44
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:07,860
The moral of the story is to carry mace to protect yourself from small business owners

45
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:10,680
who are almost universally insane people.

46
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:14,580
Can we finally admit that small business owners are all incredibly annoying?

47
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:18,560
Ransack every small business you get the opportunity to, even if you don't need anything.

48
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:22,220
There's a growing segment of the population that seems to think that stealing from a business,

49
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:26,740
even a small one where it's not a large exploitative corporation like Amazon or Walmart, but a

50
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:30,580
local member of the community just trying to get by, is completely fine because it is

51
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:35,440
the action of running a business itself that is immoral, not the size of the business.

52
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:38,680
This is obviously nonsense and is just ideological cover for theft.

53
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:43,440
But every time a video of people robbing from small shops goes viral, you see these kind

54
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:47,220
of justifications in the comments, especially if there's a racial component to the theft.

55
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:51,120
Like if it's a non-black owned business in a majority black neighborhood, people will

56
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,840
spout off about reparations.

57
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:56,160
If it's a black owned business in that same neighborhood, they'll spout off about perpetuating

58
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,900
whiteness because running your own business is acting white.

59
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:03,160
It's all bullshit to post hoc justify what is clearly just rampant theft.

60
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:05,560
If we dig a bit deeper, there's another level to this too.

61
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,200
Check out these replies.

62
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,200
Small business owners?

63
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:10,460
You mean pretend CEOs and cops?

64
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:15,160
Every small business is a little bit of capital away from doing company towns and public lashings.

65
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:17,060
Petite bourgeois behavior.

66
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:21,440
These small business owners are the foundational support for fascism, just so you know.

67
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:24,560
This kind of girl is the social basis for fascism, by the way.

68
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:27,080
Carl Cern, one of the Hitler particles escaped.

69
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:29,980
Small business owners all have many particles of Hitler within them.

70
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:31,960
Small business owners all love Adolf Hitler.

71
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:35,960
I have a coworker that always lectures me about shopping at local businesses and I have

72
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:39,320
to remind them that small business owners are just small capitalists.

73
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:42,960
The petite bourgeois have the potential to be a reactionary class and will, more often

74
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:45,000
than not, side with the bourgeois.

75
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,500
There is a completely retarded level of discourse right now, which is equating small businesses

76
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:50,500
with fascism.

77
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:53,880
And the source of it comes from that Hitler particle joke that several of the replies

78
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:54,880
alluded to.

79
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:58,280
In fact, one just right out says it, Trotsky Hitler particles quote.

80
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:04,060
What he's referring to is a 1933 essay by Leon Trotsky called What is National Socialism?

81
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:08,120
Trotsky was a Russian-Ukrainian Marxist revolutionary and was an early friend of Lenin.

82
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:11,960
Despite ongoing disagreements with Lenin over Marxist ideology, he would ultimately become

83
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:14,240
a central component within Lenin's regime.

84
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:18,540
The 1917 revolution had Lenin and Trotsky as its co-leaders.

85
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:22,840
After Lenin's death, Stalin recognized Trotsky as the only other individual who was capable

86
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:26,600
of directly challenging his legitimacy as a fellow heir to Lenin's movement.

87
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:30,560
And so Trotsky was eventually pushed out of all of his government positions and exiled.

88
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,860
Eventually the Soviets assassinated him in Mexico.

89
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:37,420
His own political theory, Trotskyism, a branch of Marxism separate from Leninism, only came

90
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:40,160
back into focus after the fall of the Soviet Union.

91
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:44,680
As after Stalin's death, Trotsky was the only major unpersoned Soviet theorist who

92
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:46,480
wasn't politically rehabilitated.

93
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:51,080
Trotsky was heavily critical of Stalinism, where, to describe the Soviet Union under

94
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:55,520
Stalin, he coined the term degenerated workers state, which described a socialist revolution

95
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:59,280
that got stuck in the dictatorship of the proletariat phase, where the working class's

96
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:04,200
control over the state didn't move towards withering away as Marx predicted, but instead

97
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:07,020
entrenched itself as a lumbering bureaucracy.

98
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:10,760
In this way, Trotsky was a pure Marxian socialist than Stalin.

99
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:14,080
Stalin's focus was on bringing to bear the full might of the capitalist mode of production

100
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:18,840
within Russia, which Marx said was one of the preconditions for a true socialist revolution.

101
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:22,300
While Trotsky believed that these efforts simply amounted to collaboration with capitalists

102
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:26,460
and there would be no true socialism unless the entire world's working class revolted

103
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:27,460
as one.

104
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:32,420
However, in practice, Trotskyism was no different than Stalinism, as Trotsky himself, in capacity

105
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:36,260
as leader of the Red Army, played his part in many repressive purges.

106
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:39,560
I figured I'd quickly go over all of that because I just realized I've never really

107
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:41,540
talked about Trotsky in this channel before.

108
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:46,060
I will say though, one big difference between Stalin and Trotsky is that Stalin, up until

109
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:50,540
Germany invaded the Soviet Union, was completely fine with Hitler's National Socialism.

110
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:54,420
But Trotsky was highly critical of it, for many of the same reasons he was critical of

111
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:55,420
Stalinism.

112
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:57,380
Which brings us back to that 1933 essay.

113
00:05:57,380 --> 00:06:00,300
The quote from the essay that everyone's referencing, by the way, is,

114
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:04,540
Not every exasperated petty bourgeois could become Hitler, but a particle of Hitler is

115
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:07,620
lodged in every exasperated petty bourgeois.

116
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:11,940
Just so we're clear, Marxists view everything in terms of two social classes, the proletariat,

117
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:15,740
who have no capital and must work the means of production owned by their people to survive,

118
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:19,900
and the bourgeois, who own the means of production and pay workers to work them but don't have

119
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:20,900
to work themselves.

120
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:25,940
Out of these two groups, Marx described two more subgroups, the lumpenprolz, members of

121
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:29,980
the proletariat with no revolutionary potential because they were too unthinking to revolt,

122
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:30,980
in his estimation.

123
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:34,180
And the petty bourgeois, who own the means of production like the bourgeois does, but

124
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:36,820
also work the means of production like the proletariat does.

125
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:40,580
The business owner who is so rich he doesn't need to work, he just hires people to do all

126
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:44,700
the work and scrapes surplus value off the top, that's a member of the bourgeois.

127
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:49,140
The shop owner who may or may not hire workers to work his shop, but also works in his shop

128
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:53,340
himself, contributing his own labor to it alongside owning it, that is a member of the

129
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:54,460
petty bourgeois.

130
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:58,420
This essay is Trotsky's attempt to link Hitler's National Socialism with the concept

131
00:06:58,420 --> 00:07:02,740
of the petty bourgeois, the business owner who owns his own business and works in it.

132
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:04,600
Trotsky blames them for the fall of democracy.

133
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:07,780
The decay of the middle strata did not mean that they were made into proletarians, in

134
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:12,220
as much as the proletariat itself was casting out a gigantic army of chronically unemployed.

135
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:16,900
The pauperization of the petty bourgeois, barely covered by ties and socks of artificial

136
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:21,700
milk, eroded all official creeds and first of all the doctrine of democratic parliamentarianism.

137
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:25,700
Trotsky asserts that, when the chips are down, the petty bourgeois, despite being nearly

138
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:30,940
as poor as the workers, will ultimately side with the bourgeois against a workers revolution.

139
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:34,820
The national renaissance leaned wholly upon the middle class, the most backward part of

140
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:37,460
the nation, the heavy blast of history.

141
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:41,020
Political art consisted in fusing the petty bourgeois into oneness through its common

142
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:42,580
hostility to the proletariat.

143
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:47,460
Competent before big capital, the petty bourgeois hopes in the future to regain its social dignity

144
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:49,380
through the ruin of workers.

145
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:52,640
Trotsky believed that the petty bourgeois possessed a heroic spirit, a term that he

146
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:56,100
uses derisively to describe anti-materialist thinking.

147
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:59,940
And Hitler used that spirit to stoke the fires of German mysticism.

148
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:06,020
To evolution, materialist thought and rationalism of the 20th, 19th and 18th centuries is counterposed

149
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:10,140
in his mind national idealism as the source of heroic inspiration.

150
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:13,980
Hitler's nation is the mythological shadow of the petty bourgeois itself, a pathetic

151
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:16,300
delirium of a thousand year reich.

152
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:19,940
Trotsky's point across all of these quotes is that the reason the petty bourgeois rejects

153
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:23,900
the workers revolution, despite standing to benefit from it, is because unlike the worker

154
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:27,700
who has nothing to lose but his chains, the petty bourgeois has their small shops and

155
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:29,140
small businesses to lose.

156
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:33,100
In their desire for an orderly, safe state that allows their business to continue, the

157
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:36,580
petty bourgeois is the backbone of a fascist takeover of government.

158
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:38,900
Now this isn't my opinion, it's Trotsky's.

159
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:45,260
Now how I feel about all of this.

160
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:49,260
And while a lot of modern online socialists reject Stalin, they're still cool with Trotsky.

161
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:53,820
This is why, for example, the left-wing rag Jacobin had no problem publishing in 2018

162
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:57,620
that small businesses were overrated because unlike large corpos, they didn't have deep

163
00:08:57,620 --> 00:09:01,780
enough pockets to offer huge benefit packages, and the jobs at those businesses were often

164
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:03,000
more insecure.

165
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,540
And fair enough, if your boss is the owner of the company and he treats you unfairly

166
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:10,100
and the HR department is just the boss's wife, you're pretty much shit out of luck.

167
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:14,340
The proximity between the boss and the worker does mean there's a chance for a bad boss

168
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:17,740
to be more directly exploitative, but it works the other way around too.

169
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:21,860
If you know your boss personally, if you're friends, if you care about each other, he's

170
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:25,140
much more likely to cut you some slack or help you out during the rough times.

171
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:27,940
But forget about political theory, here's some actual hard numbers.

172
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:31,620
In the United States, at least in 2014, the data showed that in terms of the total number

173
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:34,100
of businesses, corpos were actually quite low.

174
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:37,420
C corporations in this instance are the Walmarts and Amazons, big business.

175
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:40,020
Coming in second place are S corporations and partnerships.

176
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:43,680
S corporations are small businesses that have less than 100 employees, while partnerships

177
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:46,660
are businesses where all the people involved are partners in the business.

178
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:50,300
This can either be like a worker co-op model, like the market socialists prefer, or something

179
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:53,940
like a law firm's co-ownership between all the lawyers who make it to that level.

180
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:57,380
And coming in first place, by far, are sole proprietors.

181
00:09:57,380 --> 00:09:59,900
These are people who are simply in business for themselves.

182
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:04,180
They, and sometimes their direct family, run the business with no outside help.

183
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:07,500
They own and work the means of production entirely on their own.

184
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:11,500
What's notable about all of this is that socialists always say shit like, workers should

185
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:12,940
own the means of production.

186
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:16,980
And yet, for example, when the trucker protests in Canada happened, yes it's still coming,

187
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:21,300
the socialists rejected the truckers revolting against the state because they were owners

188
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:22,300
of capital.

189
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:24,120
There's a contradiction here, at least on the surface of it.

190
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:28,340
They want workers to own the means of production, but when a worker actually manages to do just

191
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:32,640
that, they've become a member of the petty bourgeois, an upholder of capitalism, a seed

192
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:36,860
of fascism, poor like the proletariat, but ultimately reactionary against the proletarian

193
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:37,860
revolution.

194
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:41,420
Despite the socialist claim that they are pro-worker, they don't actually want any

195
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:43,720
individual worker to own the means of production.

196
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:47,420
They don't want a society where every single individual is a sole proprietor, where everyone

197
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:51,260
runs their own independent business and trades amongst each other and there are no large

198
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:52,260
corporations.

199
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:56,540
They want the workers as a class to collectively own all of the means of production.

200
00:10:56,540 --> 00:11:00,260
This desire stems back to what we've covered a dozen times in the channel before, Marx's

201
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:03,560
On the Jewish Question, where he criticizes liberalism for granting individuals the right

202
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:07,480
to remain separate, and he asserts that humans have a lasting permanent connection through

203
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:08,480
simple contact.

204
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:09,800
Here's what I mean by that.

205
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:13,520
In the liberal view, if you buy food from the store after the transaction is complete,

206
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:16,140
the store has no right to tell you what to do with your food, and you have no right to

207
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:17,660
tell the store what to do with your money.

208
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:21,040
In essence, the two parties have become strangers again, it's an individualistic way of viewing

209
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:22,080
the economy.

210
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:26,320
But in the Marxian view, as Marx asserts in that essay, you now have a stake in the store's

211
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:30,560
operations as a customer, and the store now has a stake in your operations.

212
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:35,360
Economic transactions leave lingering connections, and as such we are all permanently connected.

213
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:39,600
There is no such thing as a private sphere, isolated from the outside world in this view.

214
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:43,600
This gives us the basis for Gramsci's Everything is Political, and Mussolini's Nothing Outside

215
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:46,840
the State, which we've also gone over many times before on this channel.

216
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:50,600
Therefore, if you're a small business owner, socialists will always hate you.

217
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:54,360
Not because you're a kernel of fascism that a reactionary movement can coalesce around

218
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:55,360
if left unchecked.

219
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:56,400
Not because you're just retarded.

220
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:59,960
It's because you're attempting to operate at least somewhat independently, at least

221
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:02,680
partially outside of a system of centralized control.

222
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:07,300
It is for this same reason that socialists also hate homesteaders, or people who voluntarily

223
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:09,400
leave society to go live in the woods.

224
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:13,700
Assume for a minute that socialists controlled the levers of government and also nationalized

225
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:16,360
large corporations like Walmart and Amazon.

226
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:20,060
In this world, do you think you'd even be allowed to run your own operation?

227
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:21,060
Of course not.

228
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:25,340
If the workers, as a class of people, collectively owned the means of production as a class of

229
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:30,220
object, if you as an individual owned one individual means of production privately in

230
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:33,280
an exclusive manner, you would be stealing from the people.

231
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:38,300
The socialists' stated hatred of power structures seems paradoxical when compared to their stated

232
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:42,840
hatred of people building a life beyond those structures, but only because they envision

233
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:46,580
themselves as being the inevitable inheritors of that power.

234
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:49,940
And if you're rejecting their overarching superstructure, if you're rejecting the

235
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:54,040
connection that we all have in the Marxian view, in order to build something for yourself

236
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:58,760
that is private, local, and particular, then you're a reactionary who is rejecting socialism

237
00:12:58,760 --> 00:12:59,760
itself.

238
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:04,720
This is why nobody on the left really cared when during the Summer of Love 2020, BLM rioters

239
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,680
burned down small businesses.

240
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:10,520
They would say things like, shut up, insurance will cover it, our political movement is more

241
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:14,040
important, even though in a lot of these cases insurance didn't actually cover it, because

242
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:18,040
as per their ideology, the liquidation of the petty bourgeois is actually one of their

243
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:19,040
goals.

244
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:21,840
Except of course if it's a black owned business, then they're proper revolutionaries who

245
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:23,680
are down for the cause or whatever.

246
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:27,500
At the end of the day though, there is no contradiction here.

247
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:31,260
The socialist wants the petty bourgeois plugged back into the system of capitalist social

248
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:36,040
control because they believe after the revolution, they will be the ones in control of that system.

249
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:39,920
Trotsky said that today's small business owner, in deriving his livelihood from outside

250
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:42,960
the control of that system, is tomorrow's counter revolutionary.

251
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:47,780
He is incentivized to fight socialism to maintain his own individuality, and in prioritizing

252
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:52,560
his freedom from wage slavery, he also prioritizes his freedom from the socialist project.

253
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:55,100
This was the one thing that Trotsky was right about, and you know what?

254
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:56,320
This is actually good.

255
00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:00,640
It is good for people to want to be independent and free and individualistic, no matter how

256
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:02,460
booty blasted the communists get.

257
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:06,680
So when you see the next viral video about how small businesses are fascist and how it's

258
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:10,220
good to steal from them, keep in mind everything that we've discussed today.

259
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:14,120
Where you and I might see a simple honest shopkeeper, they see a rebellion against their

260
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:15,520
future totalitarian system.
