0	9640	Hey, is it one of those dev videos where we start off with some viral nonsense, but by
9640	12480	the end of the video attempt to drill down deep at some underlying ethic?
12480	13480	Yeah, it's one of those!
13480	14480	Let's roll the clip!
14480	25600	So this raggedy ass bitch just came into Erotic and stole from my store, and we're gonna follow
25600	30800	her to her house because she says she's gonna pay for it there, right?
30800	31800	Yes.
31800	37680	Okay, so enjoy the ride and we'll let you know where she lives.
37680	42720	Let's play a game called Look in the Thief's Purse, so let's see what she has.
42720	43720	Stop.
43720	44720	Oh, she also took a skirt, Justin.
44720	45720	Did you see that?
45720	46720	What?
46720	47720	Yeah.
47720	48720	You raggedy bitch.
48720	57980	You look at me like I'm crazy and you stole from me, the irony, right?
57980	60800	Don't steal from small businesses, Okie.
60800	65040	In case you don't get what's going on, this viral TikTok was shot by the owner of a local
65040	66040	shop.
66040	67040	That's the woman in red.
67040	68040	The other lady, she's a thief.
68040	71240	The store owner caught her shoplifting and decided to abandon her store to follow the
71240	73740	thief onto the bus where she made this video.
73740	75920	And by the end, yeah, the thief was arrested.
75920	78200	On the one hand, there's a big old justice boner here.
78200	81440	The thief thinks she can shoplift, she gets caught, justice is served.
81440	85320	On the other, some people are saying that going so far as to leave your own storefront
85320	87560	and follow her back to her house is pretty wild.
87560	91720	Did you even lock up shop lady or is the door wide open with nobody holding down the fort
91720	92720	back there?
92720	95880	Also, it's just really funny that she runs a sex shop and the item being stolen was some
95880	98360	type of sexy clothing, trashy people all around.
98360	102560	But the important part is what some of the replies are saying, like check this shit out.
102560	105160	Small business owners are not a necessary part of society.
105160	106880	They have far too much self-importance.
106880	110160	If you can't afford to have shoplifters at your business, you can't afford to have a
110160	111160	business.
111160	112520	Maybe spend less on fancy coffee.
112520	115000	My whole thing is, don't you have insurance?
115000	118160	Shrinks should be built into your budget because this is just kind of strange.
118160	119300	Shoplifting is moral and good.
119300	121240	Why are people applauding this?
121240	123940	Stealing from a shop isn't the same as stealing from a person.
123940	127860	The moral of the story is to carry mace to protect yourself from small business owners
127860	130680	who are almost universally insane people.
130680	134580	Can we finally admit that small business owners are all incredibly annoying?
134580	138560	Ransack every small business you get the opportunity to, even if you don't need anything.
138560	142220	There's a growing segment of the population that seems to think that stealing from a business,
142220	146740	even a small one where it's not a large exploitative corporation like Amazon or Walmart, but a
146740	150580	local member of the community just trying to get by, is completely fine because it is
150580	155440	the action of running a business itself that is immoral, not the size of the business.
155440	158680	This is obviously nonsense and is just ideological cover for theft.
158680	163440	But every time a video of people robbing from small shops goes viral, you see these kind
163440	167220	of justifications in the comments, especially if there's a racial component to the theft.
167220	171120	Like if it's a non-black owned business in a majority black neighborhood, people will
171120	172840	spout off about reparations.
172840	176160	If it's a black owned business in that same neighborhood, they'll spout off about perpetuating
176160	178900	whiteness because running your own business is acting white.
178900	183160	It's all bullshit to post hoc justify what is clearly just rampant theft.
183160	185560	If we dig a bit deeper, there's another level to this too.
185560	187200	Check out these replies.
187200	188200	Small business owners?
188200	190460	You mean pretend CEOs and cops?
190460	195160	Every small business is a little bit of capital away from doing company towns and public lashings.
195160	197060	Petite bourgeois behavior.
197060	201440	These small business owners are the foundational support for fascism, just so you know.
201440	204560	This kind of girl is the social basis for fascism, by the way.
204560	207080	Carl Cern, one of the Hitler particles escaped.
207080	209980	Small business owners all have many particles of Hitler within them.
209980	211960	Small business owners all love Adolf Hitler.
211960	215960	I have a coworker that always lectures me about shopping at local businesses and I have
215960	219320	to remind them that small business owners are just small capitalists.
219320	222960	The petite bourgeois have the potential to be a reactionary class and will, more often
222960	225000	than not, side with the bourgeois.
225000	229500	There is a completely retarded level of discourse right now, which is equating small businesses
229500	230500	with fascism.
230500	233880	And the source of it comes from that Hitler particle joke that several of the replies
233880	234880	alluded to.
234880	238280	In fact, one just right out says it, Trotsky Hitler particles quote.
238280	244060	What he's referring to is a 1933 essay by Leon Trotsky called What is National Socialism?
244060	248120	Trotsky was a Russian-Ukrainian Marxist revolutionary and was an early friend of Lenin.
248120	251960	Despite ongoing disagreements with Lenin over Marxist ideology, he would ultimately become
251960	254240	a central component within Lenin's regime.
254240	258540	The 1917 revolution had Lenin and Trotsky as its co-leaders.
258540	262840	After Lenin's death, Stalin recognized Trotsky as the only other individual who was capable
262840	266600	of directly challenging his legitimacy as a fellow heir to Lenin's movement.
266600	270560	And so Trotsky was eventually pushed out of all of his government positions and exiled.
270560	272860	Eventually the Soviets assassinated him in Mexico.
272860	277420	His own political theory, Trotskyism, a branch of Marxism separate from Leninism, only came
277420	280160	back into focus after the fall of the Soviet Union.
280160	284680	As after Stalin's death, Trotsky was the only major unpersoned Soviet theorist who
284680	286480	wasn't politically rehabilitated.
286480	291080	Trotsky was heavily critical of Stalinism, where, to describe the Soviet Union under
291080	295520	Stalin, he coined the term degenerated workers state, which described a socialist revolution
295520	299280	that got stuck in the dictatorship of the proletariat phase, where the working class's
299280	304200	control over the state didn't move towards withering away as Marx predicted, but instead
304200	307020	entrenched itself as a lumbering bureaucracy.
307020	310760	In this way, Trotsky was a pure Marxian socialist than Stalin.
310760	314080	Stalin's focus was on bringing to bear the full might of the capitalist mode of production
314080	318840	within Russia, which Marx said was one of the preconditions for a true socialist revolution.
318840	322300	While Trotsky believed that these efforts simply amounted to collaboration with capitalists
322300	326460	and there would be no true socialism unless the entire world's working class revolted
326460	327460	as one.
327460	332420	However, in practice, Trotskyism was no different than Stalinism, as Trotsky himself, in capacity
332420	336260	as leader of the Red Army, played his part in many repressive purges.
336260	339560	I figured I'd quickly go over all of that because I just realized I've never really
339560	341540	talked about Trotsky in this channel before.
341540	346060	I will say though, one big difference between Stalin and Trotsky is that Stalin, up until
346060	350540	Germany invaded the Soviet Union, was completely fine with Hitler's National Socialism.
350540	354420	But Trotsky was highly critical of it, for many of the same reasons he was critical of
354420	355420	Stalinism.
355420	357380	Which brings us back to that 1933 essay.
357380	360300	The quote from the essay that everyone's referencing, by the way, is,
360300	364540	Not every exasperated petty bourgeois could become Hitler, but a particle of Hitler is
364540	367620	lodged in every exasperated petty bourgeois.
367620	371940	Just so we're clear, Marxists view everything in terms of two social classes, the proletariat,
371940	375740	who have no capital and must work the means of production owned by their people to survive,
375740	379900	and the bourgeois, who own the means of production and pay workers to work them but don't have
379900	380900	to work themselves.
380900	385940	Out of these two groups, Marx described two more subgroups, the lumpenprolz, members of
385940	389980	the proletariat with no revolutionary potential because they were too unthinking to revolt,
389980	390980	in his estimation.
390980	394180	And the petty bourgeois, who own the means of production like the bourgeois does, but
394180	396820	also work the means of production like the proletariat does.
396820	400580	The business owner who is so rich he doesn't need to work, he just hires people to do all
400580	404700	the work and scrapes surplus value off the top, that's a member of the bourgeois.
404700	409140	The shop owner who may or may not hire workers to work his shop, but also works in his shop
409140	413340	himself, contributing his own labor to it alongside owning it, that is a member of the
413340	414460	petty bourgeois.
414460	418420	This essay is Trotsky's attempt to link Hitler's National Socialism with the concept
418420	422740	of the petty bourgeois, the business owner who owns his own business and works in it.
422740	424600	Trotsky blames them for the fall of democracy.
424600	427780	The decay of the middle strata did not mean that they were made into proletarians, in
427780	432220	as much as the proletariat itself was casting out a gigantic army of chronically unemployed.
432220	436900	The pauperization of the petty bourgeois, barely covered by ties and socks of artificial
436900	441700	milk, eroded all official creeds and first of all the doctrine of democratic parliamentarianism.
441700	445700	Trotsky asserts that, when the chips are down, the petty bourgeois, despite being nearly
445700	450940	as poor as the workers, will ultimately side with the bourgeois against a workers revolution.
450940	454820	The national renaissance leaned wholly upon the middle class, the most backward part of
454820	457460	the nation, the heavy blast of history.
457460	461020	Political art consisted in fusing the petty bourgeois into oneness through its common
461020	462580	hostility to the proletariat.
462580	467460	Competent before big capital, the petty bourgeois hopes in the future to regain its social dignity
467460	469380	through the ruin of workers.
469380	472640	Trotsky believed that the petty bourgeois possessed a heroic spirit, a term that he
472640	476100	uses derisively to describe anti-materialist thinking.
476100	479940	And Hitler used that spirit to stoke the fires of German mysticism.
479940	486020	To evolution, materialist thought and rationalism of the 20th, 19th and 18th centuries is counterposed
486020	490140	in his mind national idealism as the source of heroic inspiration.
490140	493980	Hitler's nation is the mythological shadow of the petty bourgeois itself, a pathetic
493980	496300	delirium of a thousand year reich.
496300	499940	Trotsky's point across all of these quotes is that the reason the petty bourgeois rejects
499940	503900	the workers revolution, despite standing to benefit from it, is because unlike the worker
503900	507700	who has nothing to lose but his chains, the petty bourgeois has their small shops and
507700	509140	small businesses to lose.
509140	513100	In their desire for an orderly, safe state that allows their business to continue, the
513100	516580	petty bourgeois is the backbone of a fascist takeover of government.
516580	518900	Now this isn't my opinion, it's Trotsky's.
518900	525260	Now how I feel about all of this.
525260	529260	And while a lot of modern online socialists reject Stalin, they're still cool with Trotsky.
529260	533820	This is why, for example, the left-wing rag Jacobin had no problem publishing in 2018
533820	537620	that small businesses were overrated because unlike large corpos, they didn't have deep
537620	541780	enough pockets to offer huge benefit packages, and the jobs at those businesses were often
541780	543000	more insecure.
543000	546540	And fair enough, if your boss is the owner of the company and he treats you unfairly
546540	550100	and the HR department is just the boss's wife, you're pretty much shit out of luck.
550100	554340	The proximity between the boss and the worker does mean there's a chance for a bad boss
554340	557740	to be more directly exploitative, but it works the other way around too.
557740	561860	If you know your boss personally, if you're friends, if you care about each other, he's
561860	565140	much more likely to cut you some slack or help you out during the rough times.
565140	567940	But forget about political theory, here's some actual hard numbers.
567940	571620	In the United States, at least in 2014, the data showed that in terms of the total number
571620	574100	of businesses, corpos were actually quite low.
574100	577420	C corporations in this instance are the Walmarts and Amazons, big business.
577420	580020	Coming in second place are S corporations and partnerships.
580020	583680	S corporations are small businesses that have less than 100 employees, while partnerships
583680	586660	are businesses where all the people involved are partners in the business.
586660	590300	This can either be like a worker co-op model, like the market socialists prefer, or something
590300	593940	like a law firm's co-ownership between all the lawyers who make it to that level.
593940	597380	And coming in first place, by far, are sole proprietors.
597380	599900	These are people who are simply in business for themselves.
599900	604180	They, and sometimes their direct family, run the business with no outside help.
604180	607500	They own and work the means of production entirely on their own.
607500	611500	What's notable about all of this is that socialists always say shit like, workers should
611500	612940	own the means of production.
612940	616980	And yet, for example, when the trucker protests in Canada happened, yes it's still coming,
616980	621300	the socialists rejected the truckers revolting against the state because they were owners
621300	622300	of capital.
622300	624120	There's a contradiction here, at least on the surface of it.
624120	628340	They want workers to own the means of production, but when a worker actually manages to do just
628340	632640	that, they've become a member of the petty bourgeois, an upholder of capitalism, a seed
632640	636860	of fascism, poor like the proletariat, but ultimately reactionary against the proletarian
636860	637860	revolution.
637860	641420	Despite the socialist claim that they are pro-worker, they don't actually want any
641420	643720	individual worker to own the means of production.
643720	647420	They don't want a society where every single individual is a sole proprietor, where everyone
647420	651260	runs their own independent business and trades amongst each other and there are no large
651260	652260	corporations.
652260	656540	They want the workers as a class to collectively own all of the means of production.
656540	660260	This desire stems back to what we've covered a dozen times in the channel before, Marx's
660260	663560	On the Jewish Question, where he criticizes liberalism for granting individuals the right
663560	667480	to remain separate, and he asserts that humans have a lasting permanent connection through
667480	668480	simple contact.
668480	669800	Here's what I mean by that.
669800	673520	In the liberal view, if you buy food from the store after the transaction is complete,
673520	676140	the store has no right to tell you what to do with your food, and you have no right to
676140	677660	tell the store what to do with your money.
677660	681040	In essence, the two parties have become strangers again, it's an individualistic way of viewing
681040	682080	the economy.
682080	686320	But in the Marxian view, as Marx asserts in that essay, you now have a stake in the store's
686320	690560	operations as a customer, and the store now has a stake in your operations.
690560	695360	Economic transactions leave lingering connections, and as such we are all permanently connected.
695360	699600	There is no such thing as a private sphere, isolated from the outside world in this view.
699600	703600	This gives us the basis for Gramsci's Everything is Political, and Mussolini's Nothing Outside
703600	706840	the State, which we've also gone over many times before on this channel.
706840	710600	Therefore, if you're a small business owner, socialists will always hate you.
710600	714360	Not because you're a kernel of fascism that a reactionary movement can coalesce around
714360	715360	if left unchecked.
715400	716400	Not because you're just retarded.
716400	719960	It's because you're attempting to operate at least somewhat independently, at least
719960	722680	partially outside of a system of centralized control.
722680	727300	It is for this same reason that socialists also hate homesteaders, or people who voluntarily
727300	729400	leave society to go live in the woods.
729400	733700	Assume for a minute that socialists controlled the levers of government and also nationalized
733700	736360	large corporations like Walmart and Amazon.
736360	740060	In this world, do you think you'd even be allowed to run your own operation?
740060	741060	Of course not.
741060	745340	If the workers, as a class of people, collectively owned the means of production as a class of
745340	750220	object, if you as an individual owned one individual means of production privately in
750220	753280	an exclusive manner, you would be stealing from the people.
753280	758300	The socialists' stated hatred of power structures seems paradoxical when compared to their stated
758300	762840	hatred of people building a life beyond those structures, but only because they envision
762840	766580	themselves as being the inevitable inheritors of that power.
766580	769940	And if you're rejecting their overarching superstructure, if you're rejecting the
769940	774040	connection that we all have in the Marxian view, in order to build something for yourself
774040	778760	that is private, local, and particular, then you're a reactionary who is rejecting socialism
778760	779760	itself.
779760	784720	This is why nobody on the left really cared when during the Summer of Love 2020, BLM rioters
784720	786680	burned down small businesses.
786680	790520	They would say things like, shut up, insurance will cover it, our political movement is more
790520	794040	important, even though in a lot of these cases insurance didn't actually cover it, because
794040	798040	as per their ideology, the liquidation of the petty bourgeois is actually one of their
798040	799040	goals.
799040	801840	Except of course if it's a black owned business, then they're proper revolutionaries who
801840	803680	are down for the cause or whatever.
804320	807500	At the end of the day though, there is no contradiction here.
807500	811260	The socialist wants the petty bourgeois plugged back into the system of capitalist social
811260	816040	control because they believe after the revolution, they will be the ones in control of that system.
816040	819920	Trotsky said that today's small business owner, in deriving his livelihood from outside
819920	822960	the control of that system, is tomorrow's counter revolutionary.
822960	827780	He is incentivized to fight socialism to maintain his own individuality, and in prioritizing
827780	832560	his freedom from wage slavery, he also prioritizes his freedom from the socialist project.
832560	835100	This was the one thing that Trotsky was right about, and you know what?
835100	836320	This is actually good.
836320	840640	It is good for people to want to be independent and free and individualistic, no matter how
840640	842460	booty blasted the communists get.
842460	846680	So when you see the next viral video about how small businesses are fascist and how it's
846680	850220	good to steal from them, keep in mind everything that we've discussed today.
850220	854120	Where you and I might see a simple honest shopkeeper, they see a rebellion against their
854120	855520	future totalitarian system.
