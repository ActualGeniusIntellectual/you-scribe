WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:09.640
Hey, is it one of those dev videos where we start off with some viral nonsense, but by

00:09.640 --> 00:12.480
the end of the video attempt to drill down deep at some underlying ethic?

00:12.480 --> 00:13.480
Yeah, it's one of those!

00:13.480 --> 00:14.480
Let's roll the clip!

00:14.480 --> 00:25.600
So this raggedy ass bitch just came into Erotic and stole from my store, and we're gonna follow

00:25.600 --> 00:30.800
her to her house because she says she's gonna pay for it there, right?

00:30.800 --> 00:31.800
Yes.

00:31.800 --> 00:37.680
Okay, so enjoy the ride and we'll let you know where she lives.

00:37.680 --> 00:42.720
Let's play a game called Look in the Thief's Purse, so let's see what she has.

00:42.720 --> 00:43.720
Stop.

00:43.720 --> 00:44.720
Oh, she also took a skirt, Justin.

00:44.720 --> 00:45.720
Did you see that?

00:45.720 --> 00:46.720
What?

00:46.720 --> 00:47.720
Yeah.

00:47.720 --> 00:48.720
You raggedy bitch.

00:48.720 --> 00:57.980
You look at me like I'm crazy and you stole from me, the irony, right?

00:57.980 --> 01:00.800
Don't steal from small businesses, Okie.

01:00.800 --> 01:05.040
In case you don't get what's going on, this viral TikTok was shot by the owner of a local

01:05.040 --> 01:06.040
shop.

01:06.040 --> 01:07.040
That's the woman in red.

01:07.040 --> 01:08.040
The other lady, she's a thief.

01:08.040 --> 01:11.240
The store owner caught her shoplifting and decided to abandon her store to follow the

01:11.240 --> 01:13.740
thief onto the bus where she made this video.

01:13.740 --> 01:15.920
And by the end, yeah, the thief was arrested.

01:15.920 --> 01:18.200
On the one hand, there's a big old justice boner here.

01:18.200 --> 01:21.440
The thief thinks she can shoplift, she gets caught, justice is served.

01:21.440 --> 01:25.320
On the other, some people are saying that going so far as to leave your own storefront

01:25.320 --> 01:27.560
and follow her back to her house is pretty wild.

01:27.560 --> 01:31.720
Did you even lock up shop lady or is the door wide open with nobody holding down the fort

01:31.720 --> 01:32.720
back there?

01:32.720 --> 01:35.880
Also, it's just really funny that she runs a sex shop and the item being stolen was some

01:35.880 --> 01:38.360
type of sexy clothing, trashy people all around.

01:38.360 --> 01:42.560
But the important part is what some of the replies are saying, like check this shit out.

01:42.560 --> 01:45.160
Small business owners are not a necessary part of society.

01:45.160 --> 01:46.880
They have far too much self-importance.

01:46.880 --> 01:50.160
If you can't afford to have shoplifters at your business, you can't afford to have a

01:50.160 --> 01:51.160
business.

01:51.160 --> 01:52.520
Maybe spend less on fancy coffee.

01:52.520 --> 01:55.000
My whole thing is, don't you have insurance?

01:55.000 --> 01:58.160
Shrinks should be built into your budget because this is just kind of strange.

01:58.160 --> 01:59.300
Shoplifting is moral and good.

01:59.300 --> 02:01.240
Why are people applauding this?

02:01.240 --> 02:03.940
Stealing from a shop isn't the same as stealing from a person.

02:03.940 --> 02:07.860
The moral of the story is to carry mace to protect yourself from small business owners

02:07.860 --> 02:10.680
who are almost universally insane people.

02:10.680 --> 02:14.580
Can we finally admit that small business owners are all incredibly annoying?

02:14.580 --> 02:18.560
Ransack every small business you get the opportunity to, even if you don't need anything.

02:18.560 --> 02:22.220
There's a growing segment of the population that seems to think that stealing from a business,

02:22.220 --> 02:26.740
even a small one where it's not a large exploitative corporation like Amazon or Walmart, but a

02:26.740 --> 02:30.580
local member of the community just trying to get by, is completely fine because it is

02:30.580 --> 02:35.440
the action of running a business itself that is immoral, not the size of the business.

02:35.440 --> 02:38.680
This is obviously nonsense and is just ideological cover for theft.

02:38.680 --> 02:43.440
But every time a video of people robbing from small shops goes viral, you see these kind

02:43.440 --> 02:47.220
of justifications in the comments, especially if there's a racial component to the theft.

02:47.220 --> 02:51.120
Like if it's a non-black owned business in a majority black neighborhood, people will

02:51.120 --> 02:52.840
spout off about reparations.

02:52.840 --> 02:56.160
If it's a black owned business in that same neighborhood, they'll spout off about perpetuating

02:56.160 --> 02:58.900
whiteness because running your own business is acting white.

02:58.900 --> 03:03.160
It's all bullshit to post hoc justify what is clearly just rampant theft.

03:03.160 --> 03:05.560
If we dig a bit deeper, there's another level to this too.

03:05.560 --> 03:07.200
Check out these replies.

03:07.200 --> 03:08.200
Small business owners?

03:08.200 --> 03:10.460
You mean pretend CEOs and cops?

03:10.460 --> 03:15.160
Every small business is a little bit of capital away from doing company towns and public lashings.

03:15.160 --> 03:17.060
Petite bourgeois behavior.

03:17.060 --> 03:21.440
These small business owners are the foundational support for fascism, just so you know.

03:21.440 --> 03:24.560
This kind of girl is the social basis for fascism, by the way.

03:24.560 --> 03:27.080
Carl Cern, one of the Hitler particles escaped.

03:27.080 --> 03:29.980
Small business owners all have many particles of Hitler within them.

03:29.980 --> 03:31.960
Small business owners all love Adolf Hitler.

03:31.960 --> 03:35.960
I have a coworker that always lectures me about shopping at local businesses and I have

03:35.960 --> 03:39.320
to remind them that small business owners are just small capitalists.

03:39.320 --> 03:42.960
The petite bourgeois have the potential to be a reactionary class and will, more often

03:42.960 --> 03:45.000
than not, side with the bourgeois.

03:45.000 --> 03:49.500
There is a completely retarded level of discourse right now, which is equating small businesses

03:49.500 --> 03:50.500
with fascism.

03:50.500 --> 03:53.880
And the source of it comes from that Hitler particle joke that several of the replies

03:53.880 --> 03:54.880
alluded to.

03:54.880 --> 03:58.280
In fact, one just right out says it, Trotsky Hitler particles quote.

03:58.280 --> 04:04.060
What he's referring to is a 1933 essay by Leon Trotsky called What is National Socialism?

04:04.060 --> 04:08.120
Trotsky was a Russian-Ukrainian Marxist revolutionary and was an early friend of Lenin.

04:08.120 --> 04:11.960
Despite ongoing disagreements with Lenin over Marxist ideology, he would ultimately become

04:11.960 --> 04:14.240
a central component within Lenin's regime.

04:14.240 --> 04:18.540
The 1917 revolution had Lenin and Trotsky as its co-leaders.

04:18.540 --> 04:22.840
After Lenin's death, Stalin recognized Trotsky as the only other individual who was capable

04:22.840 --> 04:26.600
of directly challenging his legitimacy as a fellow heir to Lenin's movement.

04:26.600 --> 04:30.560
And so Trotsky was eventually pushed out of all of his government positions and exiled.

04:30.560 --> 04:32.860
Eventually the Soviets assassinated him in Mexico.

04:32.860 --> 04:37.420
His own political theory, Trotskyism, a branch of Marxism separate from Leninism, only came

04:37.420 --> 04:40.160
back into focus after the fall of the Soviet Union.

04:40.160 --> 04:44.680
As after Stalin's death, Trotsky was the only major unpersoned Soviet theorist who

04:44.680 --> 04:46.480
wasn't politically rehabilitated.

04:46.480 --> 04:51.080
Trotsky was heavily critical of Stalinism, where, to describe the Soviet Union under

04:51.080 --> 04:55.520
Stalin, he coined the term degenerated workers state, which described a socialist revolution

04:55.520 --> 04:59.280
that got stuck in the dictatorship of the proletariat phase, where the working class's

04:59.280 --> 05:04.200
control over the state didn't move towards withering away as Marx predicted, but instead

05:04.200 --> 05:07.020
entrenched itself as a lumbering bureaucracy.

05:07.020 --> 05:10.760
In this way, Trotsky was a pure Marxian socialist than Stalin.

05:10.760 --> 05:14.080
Stalin's focus was on bringing to bear the full might of the capitalist mode of production

05:14.080 --> 05:18.840
within Russia, which Marx said was one of the preconditions for a true socialist revolution.

05:18.840 --> 05:22.300
While Trotsky believed that these efforts simply amounted to collaboration with capitalists

05:22.300 --> 05:26.460
and there would be no true socialism unless the entire world's working class revolted

05:26.460 --> 05:27.460
as one.

05:27.460 --> 05:32.420
However, in practice, Trotskyism was no different than Stalinism, as Trotsky himself, in capacity

05:32.420 --> 05:36.260
as leader of the Red Army, played his part in many repressive purges.

05:36.260 --> 05:39.560
I figured I'd quickly go over all of that because I just realized I've never really

05:39.560 --> 05:41.540
talked about Trotsky in this channel before.

05:41.540 --> 05:46.060
I will say though, one big difference between Stalin and Trotsky is that Stalin, up until

05:46.060 --> 05:50.540
Germany invaded the Soviet Union, was completely fine with Hitler's National Socialism.

05:50.540 --> 05:54.420
But Trotsky was highly critical of it, for many of the same reasons he was critical of

05:54.420 --> 05:55.420
Stalinism.

05:55.420 --> 05:57.380
Which brings us back to that 1933 essay.

05:57.380 --> 06:00.300
The quote from the essay that everyone's referencing, by the way, is,

06:00.300 --> 06:04.540
Not every exasperated petty bourgeois could become Hitler, but a particle of Hitler is

06:04.540 --> 06:07.620
lodged in every exasperated petty bourgeois.

06:07.620 --> 06:11.940
Just so we're clear, Marxists view everything in terms of two social classes, the proletariat,

06:11.940 --> 06:15.740
who have no capital and must work the means of production owned by their people to survive,

06:15.740 --> 06:19.900
and the bourgeois, who own the means of production and pay workers to work them but don't have

06:19.900 --> 06:20.900
to work themselves.

06:20.900 --> 06:25.940
Out of these two groups, Marx described two more subgroups, the lumpenprolz, members of

06:25.940 --> 06:29.980
the proletariat with no revolutionary potential because they were too unthinking to revolt,

06:29.980 --> 06:30.980
in his estimation.

06:30.980 --> 06:34.180
And the petty bourgeois, who own the means of production like the bourgeois does, but

06:34.180 --> 06:36.820
also work the means of production like the proletariat does.

06:36.820 --> 06:40.580
The business owner who is so rich he doesn't need to work, he just hires people to do all

06:40.580 --> 06:44.700
the work and scrapes surplus value off the top, that's a member of the bourgeois.

06:44.700 --> 06:49.140
The shop owner who may or may not hire workers to work his shop, but also works in his shop

06:49.140 --> 06:53.340
himself, contributing his own labor to it alongside owning it, that is a member of the

06:53.340 --> 06:54.460
petty bourgeois.

06:54.460 --> 06:58.420
This essay is Trotsky's attempt to link Hitler's National Socialism with the concept

06:58.420 --> 07:02.740
of the petty bourgeois, the business owner who owns his own business and works in it.

07:02.740 --> 07:04.600
Trotsky blames them for the fall of democracy.

07:04.600 --> 07:07.780
The decay of the middle strata did not mean that they were made into proletarians, in

07:07.780 --> 07:12.220
as much as the proletariat itself was casting out a gigantic army of chronically unemployed.

07:12.220 --> 07:16.900
The pauperization of the petty bourgeois, barely covered by ties and socks of artificial

07:16.900 --> 07:21.700
milk, eroded all official creeds and first of all the doctrine of democratic parliamentarianism.

07:21.700 --> 07:25.700
Trotsky asserts that, when the chips are down, the petty bourgeois, despite being nearly

07:25.700 --> 07:30.940
as poor as the workers, will ultimately side with the bourgeois against a workers revolution.

07:30.940 --> 07:34.820
The national renaissance leaned wholly upon the middle class, the most backward part of

07:34.820 --> 07:37.460
the nation, the heavy blast of history.

07:37.460 --> 07:41.020
Political art consisted in fusing the petty bourgeois into oneness through its common

07:41.020 --> 07:42.580
hostility to the proletariat.

07:42.580 --> 07:47.460
Competent before big capital, the petty bourgeois hopes in the future to regain its social dignity

07:47.460 --> 07:49.380
through the ruin of workers.

07:49.380 --> 07:52.640
Trotsky believed that the petty bourgeois possessed a heroic spirit, a term that he

07:52.640 --> 07:56.100
uses derisively to describe anti-materialist thinking.

07:56.100 --> 07:59.940
And Hitler used that spirit to stoke the fires of German mysticism.

07:59.940 --> 08:06.020
To evolution, materialist thought and rationalism of the 20th, 19th and 18th centuries is counterposed

08:06.020 --> 08:10.140
in his mind national idealism as the source of heroic inspiration.

08:10.140 --> 08:13.980
Hitler's nation is the mythological shadow of the petty bourgeois itself, a pathetic

08:13.980 --> 08:16.300
delirium of a thousand year reich.

08:16.300 --> 08:19.940
Trotsky's point across all of these quotes is that the reason the petty bourgeois rejects

08:19.940 --> 08:23.900
the workers revolution, despite standing to benefit from it, is because unlike the worker

08:23.900 --> 08:27.700
who has nothing to lose but his chains, the petty bourgeois has their small shops and

08:27.700 --> 08:29.140
small businesses to lose.

08:29.140 --> 08:33.100
In their desire for an orderly, safe state that allows their business to continue, the

08:33.100 --> 08:36.580
petty bourgeois is the backbone of a fascist takeover of government.

08:36.580 --> 08:38.900
Now this isn't my opinion, it's Trotsky's.

08:38.900 --> 08:45.260
Now how I feel about all of this.

08:45.260 --> 08:49.260
And while a lot of modern online socialists reject Stalin, they're still cool with Trotsky.

08:49.260 --> 08:53.820
This is why, for example, the left-wing rag Jacobin had no problem publishing in 2018

08:53.820 --> 08:57.620
that small businesses were overrated because unlike large corpos, they didn't have deep

08:57.620 --> 09:01.780
enough pockets to offer huge benefit packages, and the jobs at those businesses were often

09:01.780 --> 09:03.000
more insecure.

09:03.000 --> 09:06.540
And fair enough, if your boss is the owner of the company and he treats you unfairly

09:06.540 --> 09:10.100
and the HR department is just the boss's wife, you're pretty much shit out of luck.

09:10.100 --> 09:14.340
The proximity between the boss and the worker does mean there's a chance for a bad boss

09:14.340 --> 09:17.740
to be more directly exploitative, but it works the other way around too.

09:17.740 --> 09:21.860
If you know your boss personally, if you're friends, if you care about each other, he's

09:21.860 --> 09:25.140
much more likely to cut you some slack or help you out during the rough times.

09:25.140 --> 09:27.940
But forget about political theory, here's some actual hard numbers.

09:27.940 --> 09:31.620
In the United States, at least in 2014, the data showed that in terms of the total number

09:31.620 --> 09:34.100
of businesses, corpos were actually quite low.

09:34.100 --> 09:37.420
C corporations in this instance are the Walmarts and Amazons, big business.

09:37.420 --> 09:40.020
Coming in second place are S corporations and partnerships.

09:40.020 --> 09:43.680
S corporations are small businesses that have less than 100 employees, while partnerships

09:43.680 --> 09:46.660
are businesses where all the people involved are partners in the business.

09:46.660 --> 09:50.300
This can either be like a worker co-op model, like the market socialists prefer, or something

09:50.300 --> 09:53.940
like a law firm's co-ownership between all the lawyers who make it to that level.

09:53.940 --> 09:57.380
And coming in first place, by far, are sole proprietors.

09:57.380 --> 09:59.900
These are people who are simply in business for themselves.

09:59.900 --> 10:04.180
They, and sometimes their direct family, run the business with no outside help.

10:04.180 --> 10:07.500
They own and work the means of production entirely on their own.

10:07.500 --> 10:11.500
What's notable about all of this is that socialists always say shit like, workers should

10:11.500 --> 10:12.940
own the means of production.

10:12.940 --> 10:16.980
And yet, for example, when the trucker protests in Canada happened, yes it's still coming,

10:16.980 --> 10:21.300
the socialists rejected the truckers revolting against the state because they were owners

10:21.300 --> 10:22.300
of capital.

10:22.300 --> 10:24.120
There's a contradiction here, at least on the surface of it.

10:24.120 --> 10:28.340
They want workers to own the means of production, but when a worker actually manages to do just

10:28.340 --> 10:32.640
that, they've become a member of the petty bourgeois, an upholder of capitalism, a seed

10:32.640 --> 10:36.860
of fascism, poor like the proletariat, but ultimately reactionary against the proletarian

10:36.860 --> 10:37.860
revolution.

10:37.860 --> 10:41.420
Despite the socialist claim that they are pro-worker, they don't actually want any

10:41.420 --> 10:43.720
individual worker to own the means of production.

10:43.720 --> 10:47.420
They don't want a society where every single individual is a sole proprietor, where everyone

10:47.420 --> 10:51.260
runs their own independent business and trades amongst each other and there are no large

10:51.260 --> 10:52.260
corporations.

10:52.260 --> 10:56.540
They want the workers as a class to collectively own all of the means of production.

10:56.540 --> 11:00.260
This desire stems back to what we've covered a dozen times in the channel before, Marx's

11:00.260 --> 11:03.560
On the Jewish Question, where he criticizes liberalism for granting individuals the right

11:03.560 --> 11:07.480
to remain separate, and he asserts that humans have a lasting permanent connection through

11:07.480 --> 11:08.480
simple contact.

11:08.480 --> 11:09.800
Here's what I mean by that.

11:09.800 --> 11:13.520
In the liberal view, if you buy food from the store after the transaction is complete,

11:13.520 --> 11:16.140
the store has no right to tell you what to do with your food, and you have no right to

11:16.140 --> 11:17.660
tell the store what to do with your money.

11:17.660 --> 11:21.040
In essence, the two parties have become strangers again, it's an individualistic way of viewing

11:21.040 --> 11:22.080
the economy.

11:22.080 --> 11:26.320
But in the Marxian view, as Marx asserts in that essay, you now have a stake in the store's

11:26.320 --> 11:30.560
operations as a customer, and the store now has a stake in your operations.

11:30.560 --> 11:35.360
Economic transactions leave lingering connections, and as such we are all permanently connected.

11:35.360 --> 11:39.600
There is no such thing as a private sphere, isolated from the outside world in this view.

11:39.600 --> 11:43.600
This gives us the basis for Gramsci's Everything is Political, and Mussolini's Nothing Outside

11:43.600 --> 11:46.840
the State, which we've also gone over many times before on this channel.

11:46.840 --> 11:50.600
Therefore, if you're a small business owner, socialists will always hate you.

11:50.600 --> 11:54.360
Not because you're a kernel of fascism that a reactionary movement can coalesce around

11:54.360 --> 11:55.360
if left unchecked.

11:55.400 --> 11:56.400
Not because you're just retarded.

11:56.400 --> 11:59.960
It's because you're attempting to operate at least somewhat independently, at least

11:59.960 --> 12:02.680
partially outside of a system of centralized control.

12:02.680 --> 12:07.300
It is for this same reason that socialists also hate homesteaders, or people who voluntarily

12:07.300 --> 12:09.400
leave society to go live in the woods.

12:09.400 --> 12:13.700
Assume for a minute that socialists controlled the levers of government and also nationalized

12:13.700 --> 12:16.360
large corporations like Walmart and Amazon.

12:16.360 --> 12:20.060
In this world, do you think you'd even be allowed to run your own operation?

12:20.060 --> 12:21.060
Of course not.

12:21.060 --> 12:25.340
If the workers, as a class of people, collectively owned the means of production as a class of

12:25.340 --> 12:30.220
object, if you as an individual owned one individual means of production privately in

12:30.220 --> 12:33.280
an exclusive manner, you would be stealing from the people.

12:33.280 --> 12:38.300
The socialists' stated hatred of power structures seems paradoxical when compared to their stated

12:38.300 --> 12:42.840
hatred of people building a life beyond those structures, but only because they envision

12:42.840 --> 12:46.580
themselves as being the inevitable inheritors of that power.

12:46.580 --> 12:49.940
And if you're rejecting their overarching superstructure, if you're rejecting the

12:49.940 --> 12:54.040
connection that we all have in the Marxian view, in order to build something for yourself

12:54.040 --> 12:58.760
that is private, local, and particular, then you're a reactionary who is rejecting socialism

12:58.760 --> 12:59.760
itself.

12:59.760 --> 13:04.720
This is why nobody on the left really cared when during the Summer of Love 2020, BLM rioters

13:04.720 --> 13:06.680
burned down small businesses.

13:06.680 --> 13:10.520
They would say things like, shut up, insurance will cover it, our political movement is more

13:10.520 --> 13:14.040
important, even though in a lot of these cases insurance didn't actually cover it, because

13:14.040 --> 13:18.040
as per their ideology, the liquidation of the petty bourgeois is actually one of their

13:18.040 --> 13:19.040
goals.

13:19.040 --> 13:21.840
Except of course if it's a black owned business, then they're proper revolutionaries who

13:21.840 --> 13:23.680
are down for the cause or whatever.

13:24.320 --> 13:27.500
At the end of the day though, there is no contradiction here.

13:27.500 --> 13:31.260
The socialist wants the petty bourgeois plugged back into the system of capitalist social

13:31.260 --> 13:36.040
control because they believe after the revolution, they will be the ones in control of that system.

13:36.040 --> 13:39.920
Trotsky said that today's small business owner, in deriving his livelihood from outside

13:39.920 --> 13:42.960
the control of that system, is tomorrow's counter revolutionary.

13:42.960 --> 13:47.780
He is incentivized to fight socialism to maintain his own individuality, and in prioritizing

13:47.780 --> 13:52.560
his freedom from wage slavery, he also prioritizes his freedom from the socialist project.

13:52.560 --> 13:55.100
This was the one thing that Trotsky was right about, and you know what?

13:55.100 --> 13:56.320
This is actually good.

13:56.320 --> 14:00.640
It is good for people to want to be independent and free and individualistic, no matter how

14:00.640 --> 14:02.460
booty blasted the communists get.

14:02.460 --> 14:06.680
So when you see the next viral video about how small businesses are fascist and how it's

14:06.680 --> 14:10.220
good to steal from them, keep in mind everything that we've discussed today.

14:10.220 --> 14:14.120
Where you and I might see a simple honest shopkeeper, they see a rebellion against their

14:14.120 --> 14:15.520
future totalitarian system.
