0	10800	Kibi Farms is, or was, I don't know if it's coming back, a forum dedicated to the discussion
10800	11800	of lolcows.
11800	16120	A lolcow is a person the forum designates as worthy of following solely to laugh at
16120	17120	their exploits.
17120	20880	The people they follow range from YouTubers and streamers to celebrities and journalists,
20880	23840	to people who just happen to have a large Twitter following sometimes.
23840	28800	They began as the Cwicky forums, CWCicky forums, I don't know, devoted to the following of
28800	33080	Chris Chan and laughing at all of the ridiculous drama that came out of him, but gradually
33080	35600	evolved to keep tabs on pretty much everyone.
35600	39920	I can understand the Kiwi Farms impulse, frankly, they're a bunch of autistic data hoarders,
39920	40920	and so am I.
40920	42640	They like to watch a good trainwreck, just like I do.
42640	46320	But Kiwi Farms is, overall, an extremely distasteful place.
46320	49720	They're rude and bigoted beyond belief towards the people they follow.
49720	53760	They engage in regular troll operations against people who fall under their eye.
53760	58840	They stalk, they dox, and they're not above IRL harassment, including 4chan prank shit
58840	61880	like ordering a bunch of pizzas and taxi cabs to someone's house.
61880	66480	Now, the users of Kiwi Farms are also smart enough not to post that shit on the site,
66480	69520	like saying, her, der, I just sent PewDiePie 100 pizzas.
69520	71760	So they outwardly appear to be innocent.
71760	73680	But come on, how dumb do you think I am?
73680	76440	I've got a thread on Kiwi Farms, for no real reason, frankly.
76440	81080	I have no drama, no skeletons in my closet, with the exception of, I guess, being horrendous
81080	85000	with deadlines for projects, and some people in my community are kind of mad about that.
85000	86000	Fair enough.
86000	90000	The vast majority of my thread is just made-up bullshit, and it's pretty funny to see what
90000	92080	internet schizos think about you sometimes.
92080	95560	In case you guys ever get your site back, the next time you want to do weird sex rumors
95560	100200	about me, you might want to remember that Naomi isn't Lilith and Naomi isn't trans.
100200	103880	But overall, I'm not too bothered regarding what they say about me because I know it's
103880	104880	not true.
104880	106720	Nonetheless, I still don't like Kiwi Farms.
106720	109960	They've bothered a few of my friends, and their thread's coming up under the Google
109960	114200	search for my friends' real names has caused quite a few IRL problems.
114200	117920	And even if the people I cared about weren't affected, I would still consider the site
117920	119360	an absolute cesspit.
119360	123160	It is wild the length that these people can go to to throw false rumors around and wreck
123160	124280	people's lives.
124280	128120	Multiple people have committed suicide, with the media blaming Kiwi Farms for it.
128120	129760	June 29th, 2016.
129760	134160	Julie Terryberry hung herself, with news articles speculating that it was Kiwi Farms' obsessive
134160	135880	documenting of her life that led to it.
135880	137680	June 19th, 2018.
137680	139360	Chloe Sagal set herself on fire.
139360	143600	Kiwi Farms began documenting her life in 2013, after there was evidence she took money
143600	147720	from her indie game fundraiser and used it instead on gender-affirming surgery.
147720	153240	On June 27th, 2021, another trans indie dev going by the online handle of Nier also killed
153240	155120	themselves after getting harassed by Kiwi Farms.
155120	158880	There's a chicken-and-egg conversation here regarding Kiwi Farms' involvement.
158880	161040	Clearly, what they're doing is morally reprehensible.
161040	163680	But many people get shit on by Kiwi Farms and don't kill themselves.
163680	166620	Me, Sargon, Destiny, Ethan Ralph, Vaush.
166620	170100	If you're even a D-tier E-celeb, you've got a Kiwi Farms threat.
170100	173600	And most people aren't offing themselves when a Kiwi Farms user shows up in the chat
173600	174760	to be a little weiner.
174760	179480	So it seems to be factually incorrect to say that Kiwi Farms killed these people, or even
179480	181660	that Kiwi Farms drove them to suicide.
181660	184140	These are people who already had lifelong problems.
184140	186100	Chloe Sagal was homeless at the end of her rope.
186100	188460	Nier was extremely depressed and dysphoric.
188460	192620	Before Kiwi Farms ever got involved with these people, they were already spiraling downward.
192620	196940	In fact, it was the opportunity to laugh at their downward spiral that attracted Kiwi
196940	197940	Farms to them in the first place.
197940	201460	This doesn't absolve Kiwi Farms, but it's entirely possible that these people would
201460	202860	have killed themselves anyway.
202860	207020	In case I'm not being clear enough, I don't approve of what Kiwi Farms does.
207020	210580	And yet, the title of this video is, In Defense of Kiwi Farms.
210580	214980	Because as distasteful and grotesque as they are, I do think that sticking to my principles
214980	216780	means that I need to draw a line somewhere.
216780	219860	And that line has to be forcing Kiwi Farms offline.
219860	222100	In order to talk about this, we've got to talk about keffles.
222100	226260	I will have to do a full video on her at some point, because she's also a truly grotesque
226260	227820	person who has hurt a lot of people.
227820	228820	But that's not for today.
228820	232100	Today, we're only going to focus on her campaign to get Kiwi Farms kicked off the
232100	233100	internet.
233100	236500	On August 5th, 2022, keffles was swatted at her home in Ontario, Canada.
236500	238860	Her description of this event changed multiple times.
238860	248860	First, keffles said she woke up to an assault rifle pointed at her face.
248860	252340	Then later, while being interviewed for global news, she said that she had the rifle pointed
252340	263460	at her in the hallway of her house.
263460	267220	The police later clarified in a public statement, saying that officers did not conduct what
267220	270460	is sometimes referred to as a dynamic entry into keffles' residence.
270460	274460	Rather, they knocked on the door, announced themselves as police, and occupants answered.
274460	278020	Kefles was arrested for uttering threats based on information officers had at the time.
278020	279700	She was polite and cooperative.
308020	326980	The proof
326980	330460	for this is an evidence bag using her former family name, which she was able to show to
330460	331460	global news.
331460	333400	The police's statement cleared this up, too.
333400	337100	While I can't confirm any conversations which might have transpired during keffles'
337100	341400	initial arrest, activity in our holding cells is monitored by audio and video equipment.
341400	345180	At no time while she was in our holding cells did members of our police service address
345180	347140	keffles by her dead name and gender.
347140	351180	I have personally reviewed the recordings and found our officers were polite, respectful,
351180	352180	and professional.
352180	356300	The reference to keffles' former name appears to stem from the existence of prior police
356300	357300	reports.
357300	361080	Police are not normally notified when somebody legally changes their name.
361080	365060	It appears the bag in which keffles' personal property was held in was labeled with her
365060	366900	dead name for tracking purposes.
366940	370220	In other words, keffles has a record from before she transitioned and her old files
370220	373700	hadn't been updated because, presumably, she hadn't been arrested since then.
373700	378660	What the actual swatting was, was two 911 calls directing the cops to keffles' house
378660	382740	with the claim she was going to shoot up city hall, along with an extremely cringe letter
382740	386660	that reads like a person who's never encountered a trans person before trying to write in the
386660	389100	voice of a trans person who hates cis people.
389100	392560	It's pretty clearly a troll op, but I understand the police have to take these things seriously.
392560	396880	The media attention keffles gained from basically lying about all the details of her arrest
396880	402140	eventually ballooned into a $100,000 GoFundMe for keffles' legal fund against the police
402140	404580	department for being the victim of a hate crime.
404580	407800	Kefles moved out of her residence into a hotel, but she posted pictures of the hotel room
407800	408800	online.
408800	410040	Those pictures were reposted on kiwi farms.
410040	414120	People discovered what hotel it was in those pics, and began ordering pizzas to her room.
414120	419000	She moved again, this time to an Airbnb, and her Uber account got hacked to send her food.
419000	423560	After this, she moved to Northern Ireland, where she stupidly posted her location again,
423560	426820	when somebody local to the area who follows these troll communities showed up at her
426820	427820	apartment building.
427820	431680	I really do have sympathy for people who get doxxed, but if you are repeatedly posting
431680	435680	identifiable information after it happens multiple times, then it's either one of
435680	436680	two possibilities.
436680	439960	One, you're incredibly, ridiculously fucking stupid.
439960	444440	Or two, you actually want this to happen, because maybe you love the media attention.
444440	446200	Maybe it's good for your channel.
446200	450020	Maybe you've got a fundraiser for legal fees that's funding a two-month vacation
450020	451160	to Northern Ireland.
451160	455160	What you don't do, though, is start setting up an IRL streaming backpack, unless you're
455160	458680	actually trying to monetize these people who are following you around, which requires that
458680	460200	they don't lose your trail.
460200	463400	Anyway, Kefles is claiming that this all comes from Kiwi Farms.
463400	464400	And fair enough.
464400	467880	When Kefles posts her hotel room to social media, and then it gets posted to Kiwi Farms,
467880	470240	and then suddenly pizzas show up, there's a missing link there.
470240	474160	There's nobody in the Kiwi Farms Kefles thread screaming, I am the one who ordered the pizzas,
474160	476560	but it's a reasonable assumption that somebody there did it.
476560	478920	The question has to be asked, though, whose fault is it?
478920	481960	I mean, it's clearly the fault of the guy who did the ordering, obviously.
481960	485560	But is it Kiwi Farms' fault for hosting the images that Kefles herself made public?
485560	486560	I don't think so.
486560	489840	I don't intend for anybody to do anything whenever I publish a video.
489840	493080	In fact, I explicitly say, don't bother the people I'm talking about.
493080	496360	But if one of you listening decides to be an idiot and go against my wishes, is it my
496360	497360	fault?
497360	498420	No, of course not.
498420	500360	Because I'm me, and you're you.
500360	504380	Taking Kiwi Farms down doesn't mean the individuals who are actually responsible have vanished
504380	505420	off the planet.
505420	507880	And yet, Kefles moved to take Kiwi Farms down.
507880	511800	Following the trending hashtag, Drop Kiwi Farms, they started by targeting Cloudflare,
511800	513760	the domain register for KiwiFarms.net.
513760	518160	Cloudflare initially resisted, saying it would set a bad precedent for a private corporation
518160	522440	to be the judge of what legal content is and isn't allowed on the internet, a stance that
522440	523440	I agree with.
523440	526720	That was the whole point of the net neutrality fight, which progressives agreed with back
526720	529480	then, but they were never interested in neutrality, only dominance.
529480	533720	Eventually, though, Cloudflare gave in, replacing KiwiFarms.net with a splash page, stating
533720	536200	that Kiwi Farms is an imminent threat to human life.
536200	540440	I understand how they came to that conclusion, considering the suicides linked to Kiwi Farms,
540440	544120	but I want to make it clear, those were only linked to Kiwi Farms by the media.
544120	547880	And Kefles' claims about Kiwi Farms are also only backed up by her friends in the media
547880	548880	as well.
548880	553220	Jesse Singal, a freelance journalist who formerly worked for New York Magazine, did a deep dive
553220	555360	into Kefles' claims about Kiwi Farms.
555360	559120	Singal read the entirety of her Kiwi Farms thread, over 50,000 posts.
559120	562680	Many of the posts were toxic, inflammatory, and certainly transphobic.
562680	566320	It's not illegal, though, nor should it be, and it's also not anything that is a direct
566320	569240	violent utterance or an imminent threat to human life.
569240	573080	Singal found only two posts that fit Cloudflare's definition.
573080	578340	In both cases, the entire forum turned on these people for being glowies in fed posters,
578340	582480	with new accounts that seem to have only been made to go into Kefles' thread and plant
582480	583700	these very posts.
583700	587520	No idea who did it, but considering that other flash-in-the-pan internet woke-scolds with
587520	592240	absolutely no morals, like Anita Sarkeesian and Brianna Wu, have both posed as themselves
592280	596520	and directed hate towards themselves to further their goals, I personally wouldn't be surprised
596520	599320	if it came out in the future that this was her or one of her pals.
599320	603080	This is not to say that Kiwi Farms isn't a driver of harassment, it certainly is.
603080	607120	There's a lot of toxicity over there, but there's a huge difference between this website
607120	610860	is really nasty and mean and I don't like what they say about me, and this website is
610860	612660	an imminent threat to human life.
612660	616840	Though it is likely, there's no proof that Kiwi Farms users are the ones harassing Kefles.
616840	620720	It could be fans of The Quartering or Destiny, two other internet personalities who also
620720	621720	have beef with her.
621720	624560	It could be any number of other random trolls on the internet.
624560	628520	And even if there is proof that it's Kiwi Farms users, that's not proof that Kiwi
628520	630920	Farms itself is responsible.
630920	635340	Considering that none of it actually happens on Kiwi Farms, Kiwi Farms only documents it.
635340	639480	That's like saying, if I get murdered, the form that my murderer posts on is guilty of
639480	642480	murdering me if other users there talk about my murder.
642480	643760	It's a ridiculous standard.
643760	647960	But nonetheless, Kefles' drop Kiwi Farms operation was a success.
647960	650840	Cloudflare is not allowing KiwiFarms.net to return.
650840	656020	Joshua Moon, the owner of Kiwi Farms, moved his domain hosting to Russia under KiwiFarms.ru,
656020	658440	though that is also experiencing some problems.
658440	662600	The physical servers hosting Kiwi Farms itself are in a server farm in Ukraine, something
662600	667320	that Kefles is aware of because she implied that the servers should be bombed as a part
667320	669520	of the current Russian-Ukrainian war.
669520	671800	Yes, that is a real thing she said.
671800	676040	If I have any Ukrainian followers, here is the phone number and address for where Kiwi
676040	677200	Farms is currently hosted.
677200	678200	Do your thing.
678200	682320	The site is down, but I know Joshua Moon has expressed warm sentiments to Vladimir Putin
682320	684520	and the site has many Russian supporters on it.
684520	686160	I would let them know this.
686160	691320	So the main reason you might think that Kiwi Farms is somehow responsible for what's happened
691320	694920	to Kefles and others, solely because they've documented and laughed at the events, is because
694920	697400	we all know what a wink and a nudge looks like.
697400	700860	But if that is your standard, then if you apply it to Kefles here, she's literally
700860	705680	supporting terrorism, calling on Ukrainian partisans to bomb a server in their own country
705680	708240	because of apparently pro-Russian posts on it.
708240	711160	This is why Kefles is one of the single most revolting people on the internet.
711160	713640	It's got nothing to do with her being trans, I don't give a shit about that.
713640	717320	It's because she does everything that Kiwi Farms does and more.
717320	721360	But unlike Kiwi Farms, she's got the protection of the progressive establishment on her side,
721360	724600	being both trans and a member of Canada's Communist Party.
724600	727960	Like Kiwi Farms, Kefles spreads false rumours about people in an attempt to destroy their
727960	728960	lives.
728960	743860	Like Kiwi Farms, Kefles is fine with harassing people and gloating about their nervous responses
743860	744860	to it.
744860	748680	Like Kiwi Farms, Kefles is fine with her enemies getting swatted in exactly the same way she
748680	749680	did.
749680	753180	Like Kiwi Farms, Kefles is fine with her enemies getting doxxed and the family members of her
753180	754400	targets losing their jobs.
754400	757440	And it's not just her, it's the entire community that she fosters.
757440	761480	Just as they all accused Joshua Moon of fostering a terrible community in Kiwi Farms.
761480	765080	One of Kefles' mods doxxed chud logic by posting a picture of his face.
765080	766320	This wasn't public info.
766320	770720	Another one, NE43, went hard on Destiny's Wikipedia article, trying desperately to get
770720	774240	allegations of him working in coordination with Kiwi Farms to attack Kefles, despite
774240	778200	Destiny having his own thread on the site, using two news articles as sources, both of
778200	782800	which were published by those journo friends of Kefles, and both of which only use Kefles'
782800	784520	word as their source.
784520	786500	Destiny seems to be Kefles' next target.
786540	790760	Now that she's got the power to destroy Kiwi Farms and has no moral scruples about stooping
790760	793060	to their level to do it, why would she stop?
793060	797820	Destiny has made 41% jokes about me, accused me of being a rapist, accused me of being
797820	801420	a pedophile, and is now actively mocking me for being a childhood grooming victim.
801420	805900	I do not regret at all my role in getting him deplatformed from Twitch because he deserves
805900	806900	worse.
806900	808340	What's worse than losing your job, Kefles?
808340	809340	Assaulted?
809340	810340	Tortured?
810340	811340	Murdered?
811340	812340	What are we talking here?
812340	816420	Even if everything you're saying about him is true, and it's not, it's all just speech,
816420	819660	it's all shit that you've also done to other people.
819660	823380	One thing I will say about Kiwi Farms is, they don't actively lie.
823380	824620	They may get things wrong.
824620	825940	They may offer their own speculation.
825940	829260	That's not the same thing as purposefully lying, as saying something that they know
829260	830260	to be false.
830260	833900	They're there to digitally document and make fun of the real happenings of real people,
833900	836020	and their community doesn't take kindly to liars.
836020	837020	They aim for accuracy.
837020	838760	But I can't even give that to Kefles.
838760	842600	She's completely fine with saying things she knows are false in order to try and get her
842600	843600	eyes out of Destiny.
843600	847160	And considering that she's now spitting up a false narrative that Destiny is intimately
847160	851200	involved with Kiwi Farms, I have to wonder, is this a case of Kefles just destroying all
851200	853860	the people who have ever spoken out against her grotesque behavior?
853860	855960	Or is this just Destiny Derangement Syndrome?
855960	859660	Kiwi Farms is a horrendous place, filled with some very morally ugly people.
859660	861720	It has caused my friends a lot of problems.
861720	866160	But on principle, I must say that I hope it overcomes these issues and makes a return.
866160	870840	It is a scary world we live in, if the loudest, most abusive, woke scold can just bully a
870840	874460	website off the internet because she doesn't like getting flack while at the same time
874460	878140	behaving exactly like them and terrorizing her own targets.
878140	881420	At the end of the day, Kefles did not deserve to get doxed or swatted.
881420	883600	On some level, I have no sympathy for her.
883600	885780	She's legitimately as bad as Kiwi Farms.
885780	889940	Both of them should still be around to continue spewing their toxicity because that's what
889940	891220	free speech is.
891220	896020	But it's unironically an abortion of justice that Kiwi Farms is gone and Kefles isn't gone
896020	896820	along with them.
