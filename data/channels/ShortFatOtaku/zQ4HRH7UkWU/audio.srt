00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,920
I know I'm late to the party on this one, but if you saw yesterday's video you know

2
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:09,920
what's going on already.

3
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:14,360
So let's talk about the city bike controversy that went down back on May 14th.

4
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:18,320
Tariq Nasheed, the buckbroken himself, posted this viral tweet.

5
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:22,640
A suspected white supremacist woman tried to steal a city bike from a black kid after

6
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:26,320
he paid for it, and when him and his friends wouldn't allow her to steal it, she went

7
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:30,960
through all the Karen tactics to try to get the black youths hemmed up, screaming for

8
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33,400
help, fake crying, mayo babbling.

9
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:37,000
At this point, if you've paid attention you've at least seen the original video, but let's

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
watch it anyway.

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
It's pretty short.

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
This is not your bike!

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
This is not your bike!

14
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
This is not your bike!

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
This is not your bike!

16
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
This is not your bike!

17
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
This is not your bike!

18
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
This is not your bike!

19
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
This is not your bike!

20
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
This is not your bike!

21
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
This is not your bike!

22
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
This is not your bike!

23
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
This is not your bike!

24
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
This is not your bike!

25
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
This is not your bike!

26
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
This is not your bike!

27

00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
This is not your bike!

32
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
This is not your bike!

33
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
This is not your bike!

34
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
This is not your bike!

35
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
This is not your bike!

36
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000

37
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000

This is not your bike!

42
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
This is not your bike!

43
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
This is not your bike!

00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
This is not your bike!

45
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000

This is not your bike!

164
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
This is not your bike!

This is not your bike!

166
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
This is not your bike!

167
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
This is not your bike!

168
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,800
Does the person who's posting this clip want me to come to a specific conclusion that is

169
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:31,860
good for them?

170
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:35,860
Could they have left out context, while not outright lying, that would weaken their position

171
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:37,060
if it was included?

172
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:40,720
The Citi Bike footage doesn't contain much in it on its own that points to either party

173
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:41,720
being guilty.

174
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:45,740
But the fact that a known race hustler like Tariq Nasheed came out so strong with this

175
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:48,240
bullshit makes me think that there's an angle here.

176
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:52,180
In any case, because when it comes to online hate mobs, things are leaning leftward right

177
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:53,180
now.

178
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:57,180
This person was branded on Twitter and TikTok as a racist Karen who was trying to steal

179
00:03:57,180 --> 00:03:59,540
from these poor innocent black youths.

180
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:03,420
She's a nurse at Bellevue Hospital and as a result of the viral clip, the hospital announced

181
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:04,940
that they were investigating her.

182
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:05,940
You know what?

183
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:09,080
I feel the same way about this as I did about Bodega Bro from before.

184
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:12,320
Why the fuck are people getting fired for what they do off the clock?

185
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:15,420
Random nurses and engineers aren't the same as being a front man for a company.

186
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:18,800
When you punch out, your boss has no business controlling what you do.

187
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:22,340
And despite the anti-capitalist bent of the left, they're the ones who normalize this

188
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:26,020
bullshit of corpos firing you arbitrarily for what you do off the clock.

189
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:29,580
It's like I've been saying this whole time now, the fungible economics that the left

190
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:33,280
hates are necessary to create the fungible culture that the left wants.

191
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:37,300
Now it did ultimately turn out that the woman had paid for the bike, not the black kid.

192
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:41,540
But before we get into that conversation, let me quickly explain how City Bike works.

193
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:45,220
In some larger cities, you'll find a bunch of identical bikes locked up in public terminals

194
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:46,380
like this.

195
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:49,980
Sometimes it's a publicly owned operation, generally tied to that city's transit service,

196
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:51,860
like LA's Metro Bike.

197
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:54,940
Sometimes it's a private company providing the service, like City Bike in New York, which

198
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:56,440
is where the viral video took place.

199
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:57,900
But the idea is the same either way.

200
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:00,780
There's a bunch of terminals across the city with bikes that are locked up.

201
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:03,820
You've got an account with the service, and sometimes you have a card, sometimes an

202
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:04,820
app on your phone.

203
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:07,800
You go to the terminal, you scan your account, you take a bike out, and then you can return

204
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,860
the bike to any other terminal in the city.

205
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:11,640
It doesn't have to be the one that you grabbed it from.

206
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:15,920
Some services charge for how long the bike is undocked, some for how far you travel.

207
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:19,740
Some just have a flat monthly fee, but they all allow you to pick up and dock bikes at

208
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:22,920
any terminal in the city, which is an important part of this conversation.

209
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:26,340
The nurse ended up producing receipts, through her lawyer because, of course, she almost

210
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:28,300
got fired for a fucking viral clip.

211
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:29,800
I don't blame her for retaining one.

212
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:33,480
The receipts showed that she was indeed the person who had rented out the City Bike in

213
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:34,480
question.

214
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:38,120
She claimed that after a 12-hour shift at the hospital, she went to a nearby City Bike

215
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:42,060
dock, with bikes that were docked and available for rent, and paid for a bike through the

216
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:43,700
City Bike app on her phone.

217
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:47,700
As she backed it up from the docking station, a group of five people approached her and

218
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:49,480
claimed the bike was theirs.

219
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:53,340
They physically pushed the bike, with her on it, back into the docking station, causing

220
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:54,440
it to re-lock.

221
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:58,300
One of the men then covered the bike's QR code, stopping her from paying again so that

222
00:05:58,300 --> 00:05:59,300
she could leave.

223
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:02,460
In doing so, the man's arm was pushing against her pregnant stomach.

224
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:05,440
It's kinda hard to make out in the video, but yeah, she was pregnant.

225
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:08,420
The woman's two receipts from City Bike corroborate this story.

226
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:13,180
One of them shows that a bike was checked out at 7.24pm on May 12th, and then returned

227
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:14,420
less than a minute later.

228
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:17,420
This was when the men forcibly pushed the bike back into the dock.

229
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:21,240
The second receipt, from several minutes later and after the viral video had concluded,

230
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:23,300
was the bike that she used to finally get home.

231
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:27,100
The narrative from progressives that the black guys had taken the bike out and she was trying

232
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:30,680
to steal it and weaponize her white woman tears seems to be false.

233
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:33,940
But also, the narrative that the black guys were trying to take the bike that she rented

234
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:37,620
out from her also seems to be false, as they re-docked it and prevented her from taking

235
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:38,620
it out.

236
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:41,480
If they wanted it on her time, they would have taken it, not re-docked it.

237
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:43,020
Here's what actually happened.

238
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:46,480
In a May 25th article, where the mother of one of the guys was interviewed, she made

239
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:49,540
the claim that no one had bothered to ask him for his side of the story.

240
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:53,520
That he's only 17 years old, he's just a baby, he's only in high school, he should

241
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:57,040
be planning to attend prom and graduate, but now people are being racist towards him.

242
00:06:57,040 --> 00:07:00,360
They're a poor family, they're immigrants, they can't afford to fight any of this.

243
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:03,440
Of course, they had their names protected in the article, and nobody actually knows

244
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,640
who this kid is.

245
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:07,920
So how can anybody ask him for a side of the story if they don't know how to contact

246
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:08,920
him?

247
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:12,660
The guy himself said, if they have my side of the story, she doesn't have a case.

248
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:15,380
So let's hear him tell his side of the story.

249
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:19,020
He and his friends walked around the Bronx for 20 minutes looking for a city bike before

250
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:20,180
they finally found some.

251
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:23,660
They rode the bikes to Harlem and stopped riding after 45 minutes.

252
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:27,120
He explained that the price goes up after 45 minutes of continuous use.

253
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:30,500
So he and his friends docked their bikes, waited for the rate to cool down again, and

254
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:34,380
then took out the bikes again to go from Harlem to the Lower East Side of Manhattan.

255
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:36,940
They docked the bikes again at 719pm.

256
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:41,220
He admits, in his own retelling of events, that he and his friends were camping on the

257
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:44,860
bikes without paying for them while they waited for their fare to go down again.

258
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:49,960
The nurse then shows up and decides to use a bike at 724pm, which the boys intended to

259
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:53,140
rent out once they could, but they hadn't actually claimed it yet.

260
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:54,620
And that's when the viral video starts.

261
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:58,260
Now, I don't know why he thought this retelling of events would help him, because it proves

262
00:07:58,260 --> 00:08:00,180
he was entirely in the wrong.

263
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:03,380
This is like holding a taxi that you want for 15 minutes without actually paying for

264
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:04,380
it.

265
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:07,300
It's not yours just because you used it and intend to use it again in the future.

266
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:10,140
If it's not rented out, it's not yours, simple as that.

267
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:13,760
And we can prove that this is exactly what happened by looking at the receipts.

268
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:17,220
The serial number of the bike is 5603915.

269
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:22,320
You can see that this specific bike was docked in Harlem at 606pm, and then again in Manhattan

270
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:23,580
at 719pm.

271
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:28,140
The bike is then attempted to be taken out of the dock at 724, again at 725, and then

272
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:31,640
is finally rented out at 759 and used as intended.

273
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:35,900
That's a 40 minute break where this guy just camped out on this bike and didn't

274
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:38,040
pay for it and kept others from using it.

275
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:42,080
And this is why you can hear in the background of that original viral video when bystanders

276
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:46,320
asked the two to just check the apps on their phone to see who actually has the bike, he

277
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:58,280
refused to do it.

278
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:02,120
The guy's sister also made a TikTok video where she blatantly admits that her brother

279
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:05,080
didn't actually have the bike rented out, but that the nurse still shouldn't have

280
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:31,720
been able to take it because the bike was in his possession.

281
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:38,800
Bike number 5603915 was in my brother's possession from St. Nicholas Avenue and Manhattan Ave

282
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:45,860
all the way to First Avenue and East 30th Street from the hours of 633pm to 719pm.

283
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:51,560
At 719pm they dock the bikes, Sarah Jane Comrie walks up to them, asks, hey guys, can I use

284
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:53,760
one of you guys' bikes?

285
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:59,720
She says this as there are other bikes sitting idle at the bike rack.

286
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:04,600
They politely decline, she asks them again, mentions that she's pregnant, and they still

287
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:05,600
decline.

288
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:10,720
Then, with my brother standing next to the bike with his hands on the handlebars, she

289
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:18,080
jumps onto the bike, sits on the bike, and scans the QR code, thus beginning her ride.

290
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:21,360
Mind you, the bike was in my brother's possession at this time.

291
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,980
Bitch, that ain't how this works.

292
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:26,320
This isn't like Harry Potter Goblins, where the new owner of an object isn't actually

293
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,000
the owner despite having bought it.

294
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,320
Of course, it turned out that the sister isn't exactly a person of good character either,

295
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:35,040
as a quick internet dig discovered that she's actually just a disgusting racist.

296
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:38,580
It turns out that black and Latino riders in the New York subway were disproportionately

297
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:42,780
not paying for their fare, and that the police were instructed to, quote, go after them for

298
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:43,780
it.

299
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:48,800
In response, the sister said, we hop in anyway, fuck MTA, fuck racism, fuck white people.

300
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:51,600
I guess racism is when you make people pay for their subway fare?

301
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:54,800
The quality of my life has improved greatly since I stopped moving out of the way for

302
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:55,800
white people.

303
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:59,880
It's so crazy, because you see how this shit get ugly, but it's so, so, so crazy

304
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:03,840
seeing my little brother and his friends be harassed by a white bitch for no reason over

305
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:05,160
a damn city bike.

306
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:07,280
She can kiss dat job goodbye.

307
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:10,720
Every day I wish they jeans ain't mutate to create white people.

308
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:13,660
Yeah, this person's actually just a piece of trash.

309
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:17,220
Like I said earlier, leftoid talking heads were quick to jump on the dog pile.

310
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:21,140
It should surprise nobody that people like Vash called for her to be fired over what

311
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:24,640
basically amounted to being correct, but having bad optics.

312
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:28,180
Is this an opportunity for me to demonstrate how not racist I am?

313
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:29,960
Of course she would be a nurse.

314
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:32,460
Dude, nurses are fucking psychotic.

315
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:35,160
I swear to God, nurses are like female cops.

316
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:39,400
That's like the female version of being a cop where you're, you're a horrible, abusive

317
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:42,520
piece of shit and you want to, you get out of school and you want to like have control

318
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:43,520
over people's lives.

319
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:47,240
The, the black guy, they rented the bike and then the white lady came over and just wanted

320
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:50,240
to take it and then just started shouting help.

321
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:51,600
This is so petty on her part.

322
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,960
It's not, it's not petty.

323
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:56,360
She's trying to steal the bike and or get these black guys arrested.

324
00:11:56,360 --> 00:12:04,400
These, these women, women, this woman is, um, either a sociopath, a racist or both.

325
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:10,480
And it's just trying to like nab simultaneously a free bike and also just get some black guys

326
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,720
arrested.

327
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:15,240
It's like, this is an attack that could literally endanger their lives.

328
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:16,240
It sure is.

329
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:20,200
It sure is fucking crazy that if you're a black guy, like at any point in time, a white

330
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:25,840
woman could just lock onto you and, and just decide to like ruin your life.

331
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:26,840
Yeah.

332
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:30,680
She like instantly stops crying to realize the moment she realized it's not working.

333
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:31,680
Yeah.

334
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:33,560
Wait, is this in, Oh, this is New York city.

335
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:34,840
She should be fired for this.

336
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:43,480
I genuinely like if, if you see one of your nurses, a person who holds the life of patients

337
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:50,160
in their hands and you see this insane psycho fucking sociopath shit, she should be fired

338
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:51,160
immediately.

339
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:52,160
Yeah.

340
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:53,760
He walked it back later and deleted the original video.

341
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:56,280
But imagine being somebody like this guy.

342
00:12:56,280 --> 00:13:00,040
Imagine that you have a career of giving the shittiest take imaginable based solely on

343
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:01,320
knee-jerk feels.

344
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:06,760
A take that ends up being entirely wrong, but jives very well with your audience's politics.

345
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:09,840
And then when it finally comes out that you actually were wrong, you get extra brownie

346
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:13,600
points with the retards that watch you for coming out and bravely admitting that you

347
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:14,600
were wrong.

348
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:18,600
When the obvious good thing to do is to not give the retarded take in the first place.

349
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:21,760
The young Turks also had a response that was especially brain dead.

350
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:26,840
A video has gone viral, appearing to show a white woman making an incredibly dramatic

351
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:33,540
scene in New York city after she apparently, according to all that we know, tried to claim

352
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:35,380
a rental bicycle.

353
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:40,040
They just ran with outright lies, stuff they just made up because it made the nurse look

354
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:41,040
worse.

355
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:45,640
They assumed that she was drunk because she was get this in her work clothes.

356
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:47,640
It's not that hard to figure out.

357
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:52,320
If you're doing it on the app, it'll say which bike in which it it'll have a label

358
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:57,200
at the docking station for which bike is she's in reference or they're both referencing.

359
00:13:57,200 --> 00:14:02,240
So honestly, it should have been pretty clear to her, but she's in work clothes.

360
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:04,880
So my first thought was, is she drunk?

361
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:09,520
Like she, I don't know, but she just seemed really out of it.

362
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:13,640
And I, she straight up racist, totally.

363
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:17,320
They ran with the white woman tears narrative, which is really funny because of anybody who's

364
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:20,160
not progressive ever calls a woman out for fake crying.

365
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:21,760
They're called misogynists.

366
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:25,160
It looked like, you know, what we've seen in instances like this, you have the racial

367
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:31,700
component of, um, you know, a white woman attempting to elicit some sort of response

368
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:36,000
by kind of over-exaggerating the situation that's actually happening.

369
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,200
I was just thinking of this woman.

370
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,200
Yes, exactly.

371
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:44,320
Like sort of implying like I'm in danger, everyone do what you do when a white woman

372
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:47,400
is in danger and a black man's around do that thing.

373
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:52,040
In fact, a decade ago, we saw the widespread mockery of male tears from white feminists.

374
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:56,000
And it's funny how now that the culture has shifted even more leftward, those who

375
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,640
were once protected by this rhetoric have now become its target.

376
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:02,760
Does anybody remember this viral video from 2015 where a white woman walked through New

377
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:05,440
York and was harassed by a bunch of black men?

378
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:09,280
This was presented as by leftists at the time that were much more feminist oriented and

379
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:14,360
less intersectional as being an example of male harassment and misogyny against women.

380
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:17,280
If you pointed out the racial component of the video, by the way, you were called a racist

381
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:18,520
and immediately shut down.

382
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:23,240
But now in 2023, we have black men harassing a white woman and progressives are siding

383
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:28,000
incorrectly with the black men this time because who is more or less oppressed has shifted

384
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,040
around in the intersectional ranking system in the past 10 years.

385
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:34,240
One of the clips that the Young Turks run in the background of their report is this

386
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:38,680
video of a white woman in Central Park with her dog appearing to act unhinged towards

387
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:40,720
the black man recording the event.

388
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:20,680
I'm sorry, I'm going to ramble and there is a man, African-American, who has a feist moment.

389
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:24,680
He is recording me and threatening me and my dog.

390
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:28,680
There is an African-American man, I am in Central Park.

391
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:32,680
He is recording me and threatening myself and my dog.

392
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:37,680
I'm sorry, I can't hear you either.

393
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:40,680
I'm being threatened by a man in the ramble.

394
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:43,680
Please send the cops immediately.

395
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:45,680
I'm in Central Park in the ramble.

396
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:47,680
I don't know.

397
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:49,680
Thank you.

398
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:53,680
This was a previous viral video from 2020 that had a similar trajectory as the nurse

399
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:54,680
one.

400
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:57,680
Progressives knee-jerk siding with the black man, calling the woman a racist white Karen,

401
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:00,680
and later on, context came out that she was actually in the right.

402
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:04,680
But this time it wasn't even later on because the guy who took this clip uploaded it with

403
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:06,680
this caption on his Facebook page.

404
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:08,680
Central Park this morning.

405
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:10,680
This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the ramble.

406
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:11,680
Me.

407
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:13,680
Ma'am, dogs in the ramble have to be on the leash at all times.

408
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:14,680
The sign is right there.

409
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:15,680
Her.

410
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:16,680
The dog runs are closed.

411
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:17,680
He needs his exercise.

412
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:18,680
Me.

413
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:20,680
All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the ramble, and

414
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:22,680
you can let him run off the leash all you want.

415
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:23,680
Her.

416
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:24,680
It's too dangerous.

417
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:25,680
Me.

418
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:26,680
Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not

419
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:27,680
going to like it.

420
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:28,680
Her.

421
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:29,680
What's that?

422
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:30,680
Me to the dog.

423
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:31,680
Come here, puppy.

424
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:32,680
Her.

425
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:33,680
He won't come to you.

426
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:34,680
Me.

427
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:35,680
We'll see about that.

428
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:39,200
I pull out the dog treats that I carry around for just such an intransigence, okay?

429
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:42,760
I didn't even get the chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab

430
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:43,760
the dog.

431
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:44,760
Don't you touch my dog!

432
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:48,220
That's when I started recording video with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully

433
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:49,920
emerged and took a dark turn.

434
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:50,920
Like holy fuck, dude.

435
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:55,840
This guy posted the clip with context, showing he planned to steal her dog, and progressives

436
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:58,640
just ignored it and called him the victim.

437
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:02,800
They saw a crying white woman and heard a black accent behind the camera, and their

438
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:04,560
minds were automatically made up.

439
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:06,100
No brainpower required.

440
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:10,640
This event happened back on May 25, 2020, the same day as George Floyd's death.

441
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:14,020
So while it did kinda go viral, it was largely overshadowed.

442
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:17,120
When the media did comment on it, though, they had the same story.

443
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:19,880
White women used their whiteness and femininity to destroy black men.

444
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:24,200
The woman in this video was actually fired from her job as a result of the incident and

445
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:28,340
was charged with filing a false police report, a charge that was dropped after she completed

446
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:31,020
a five-session educational course about racism.

447
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:35,940
Meanwhile, the man who recorded the video now has a Disney Plus TV show based around

448
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:40,260
birdwatching and how powerful he is for being a black man in an area dominated by white

449
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:41,260
people.

450
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:44,160
You know, I understand how racists are created after this bullshit.

451
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:48,780
This chick was entirely in the right to not want her dog be stolen, and called 911 because

452
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:50,380
she felt like she had no other choice.

453
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:55,640
But because he was black and she was white, she had to go through racial re-education.

454
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:59,040
Most people don't regularly encounter the justice system, and if her only encounter

455
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:03,740
with it is a traumatic experience where she's clearly correct and being punished for it.

456
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:06,720
From her point of view, she's probably thinking that the government is actually full of black

457
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:10,740
supremacists and woke white cucks trying to destroy the white race or something.

458
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:15,240
If this guy were white, I promise you, every single progressive who wanted to see her destroyed

459
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:17,080
would have immediately flipped that script.

460
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:19,080
Oh dude, it's the patriarchy.

461
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:20,080
She's just a woman.

462
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:21,080
He's approaching her.

463
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:22,160
She has no one with her.

464
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:23,300
All the men are rapists.

465
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:25,480
The cops won't help her because they're the patriarchy too.

466
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:29,200
She's obviously reasonable to be scared because a male is approaching her, but mention

467
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:32,920
that the male is black, and all that logic goes out the fucking window.

468
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:36,760
We are actually at a place now where progressives will let black people do anything, no matter

469
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:39,520
how awful, and excuse it because maracism.

470
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:43,200
The progs have been moving in that direction for a while now, but I think that George Floyd

471
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,520
hyper-accelerated it.

472
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:47,800
A black dude could actually rape a progressive woman at this point, and she would literally

473
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:49,400
say it's reparations.

474
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:53,920
There's no shortage of clips online right now of black people behaving genuinely awfully.

475
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:58,720
Looting, smashing, assaulting, and progressives are excusing it all because of their own racism.

476
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:02,180
They're racist against whites, so they're happy to see whites be victims.

477
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:04,900
And they're racist against blacks because they're unwilling to hold them to any sort

478
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:06,800
of civilized fucking standard.

479
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:10,520
Now there's definitely going to be some white supremacists out there who see these clips

480
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:14,400
and claim that black people are actually just predisposed to be more violent, or they're

481
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,480
somehow inferior, or they naturally hate whitey.

482
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:19,780
That's not the argument that I'm making, and that is about as stupid as progressives

483
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:21,200
who explain away the violence.

484
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:24,520
The behavior of the people in these clips is inexcusable, but I'm not so dumb as to

485
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:28,080
watch a dozen clips and assume that everybody of that demographic in those clips behaves

486
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:29,080
this way.

487
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:30,080
No.

488
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:32,720
The issue here is specifically how the progressives are treating these clips.

489
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:37,040
The person who watches nothing but a steady stream of videos showing black-on-white crime

490
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:40,760
and nothing else will likely come out of the other end of that mind-fucked into being a

491
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:42,000
white supremacist.

492
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,720
But their media diet isn't indicative of reality.

493
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:48,480
But at the same time, the progressives who display all of those clips and then say, nothing

494
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:53,480
is wrong here and you're a racist for noticing a problem, only serve to make things worse.

495
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:56,540
In other words, I'm not sitting here blowing smoke up your ass about how the events in

496
00:20:56,540 --> 00:20:59,040
these clips aren't happening, and it's good that they are.

497
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:02,840
Nor am I sitting here saying that these clips prove that entire demographics behave in a

498
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:03,840
certain way.

499
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:07,380
I'm saying that the way progressives talk about these clips, the way that progressives

500
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:12,420
talk about race, the way that progressives want black perpetrators of crime to be lionized

501
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:16,660
as heroes, all of that feeds into the white supremacist narrative about race.

502
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:18,720
Because progressives are fucking retarded.

503
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,660
I know that meme about crime stats.

504
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:23,880
I know which demographics disproportionately commit more crimes.

505
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:28,280
I also know many people in those demographics who don't commit crime and hate those who

506
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:30,100
do for making them look bad.

507
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:33,740
The liberal answer to this sort of thing is understanding that differences between individuals

508
00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:36,740
is always larger than differences between racial groups.

509
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:40,420
In other words, even if there's a documented disparity for crime rates between whites and

510
00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:44,420
blacks, the differences between two random black people or two random white people will

511
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:48,240
always be larger than the differences between blacks and whites as groups.

512
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:52,260
The point is, ultimately, none of this shit is okay, and most people talking about events

513
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:55,600
like these tend to be racists, whether that's the white supremacist spitting up narratives

514
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:59,540
about black crime and genetics, or the progressives claiming that the victims of black bad behavior

515
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:01,500
are at fault because they're white.

516
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:05,200
I would personally love to be done with this topic, but every single notable discourse

517
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:07,880
that happened during my absence was race-based.

518
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:08,880
So buckle up, chaps.

519
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,340
We're going to be doing this for a while longer.
