00:00.000 --> 00:08.920
I know I'm late to the party on this one, but if you saw yesterday's video you know

00:08.920 --> 00:09.920
what's going on already.

00:09.920 --> 00:14.360
So let's talk about the city bike controversy that went down back on May 14th.

00:14.360 --> 00:18.320
Tariq Nasheed, the buckbroken himself, posted this viral tweet.

00:18.320 --> 00:22.640
A suspected white supremacist woman tried to steal a city bike from a black kid after

00:22.640 --> 00:26.320
he paid for it, and when him and his friends wouldn't allow her to steal it, she went

00:26.320 --> 00:30.960
through all the Karen tactics to try to get the black youths hemmed up, screaming for

00:30.960 --> 00:33.400
help, fake crying, mayo babbling.

00:33.400 --> 00:37.000
At this point, if you've paid attention you've at least seen the original video, but let's

00:37.000 --> 00:38.000
watch it anyway.

00:38.000 --> 00:39.000
It's pretty short.

00:39.000 --> 00:40.000
This is not your bike!

00:40.000 --> 00:41.000
This is not your bike!

00:41.000 --> 00:42.000
This is not your bike!

00:42.000 --> 00:43.000
This is not your bike!

00:43.000 --> 00:44.000
This is not your bike!

00:44.000 --> 00:45.000
This is not your bike!

00:45.000 --> 00:46.000
This is not your bike!

00:46.000 --> 00:47.000
This is not your bike!

00:47.000 --> 00:48.000
This is not your bike!

00:48.000 --> 00:49.000
This is not your bike!

00:49.000 --> 00:50.000
This is not your bike!

00:50.000 --> 00:51.000
This is not your bike!

00:51.000 --> 00:52.000
This is not your bike!

00:52.000 --> 00:53.000
This is not your bike!

00:53.000 --> 00:54.000
This is not your bike!

00:54.000 --> 00:55.000
This is not your bike!

00:55.000 --> 00:56.000
This is not your bike!

00:56.000 --> 00:57.000
This is not your bike!

00:57.000 --> 00:58.000
This is not your bike!

00:58.000 --> 00:59.000
This is not your bike!

00:59.000 --> 01:00.000
This is not your bike!

01:00.000 --> 01:01.000
This is not your bike!

01:01.000 --> 01:02.000
This is not your bike!

01:02.000 --> 01:03.000
This is not your bike!

01:03.000 --> 01:04.000
This is not your bike!

01:04.000 --> 01:05.000
This is not your bike!

01:05.000 --> 01:06.000
This is not your bike!

01:06.000 --> 01:07.000
This is not your bike!

01:07.000 --> 01:08.000
This is not your bike!

01:08.000 --> 01:09.000
This is not your bike!

01:09.000 --> 01:10.000
This is not your bike!

01:10.000 --> 01:11.000
This is not your bike!

01:11.000 --> 01:12.000
This is not your bike!

01:12.000 --> 01:13.000
This is not your bike!

01:13.000 --> 01:14.000
This is not your bike!

01:14.000 --> 01:15.000
This is not your bike!

01:15.000 --> 01:16.000
This is not your bike!

01:16.000 --> 01:17.000
This is not your bike!

01:17.000 --> 01:18.000
This is not your bike!

01:18.000 --> 01:19.000
This is not your bike!

01:19.000 --> 01:20.000
This is not your bike!

01:20.000 --> 01:21.000
This is not your bike!

01:21.000 --> 01:22.000
This is not your bike!

01:22.000 --> 01:23.000

01:48.000 --> 01:49.000
This is not your bike!

01:49.000 --> 01:50.000
This is not your bike!

01:50.000 --> 01:51.000
This is not your bike!

01:51.000 --> 01:52.000

This is not your bike!

02:04.000 --> 02:05.000
This is not your bike!

02:05.000 --> 02:06.000

02:10.000 --> 02:11.000
This is not your bike!

02:11.000 --> 02:12.000
This is not your bike!

02:12.000 --> 02:13.000
This is not your bike!

02:13.000 --> 02:14.000
This is not your bike!

02:14.000 --> 02:15.000
This is not your bike!

02:15.000 --> 02:16.000
This is not your bike!

02:16.000 --> 02:17.000
This is not your bike!

02:17.000 --> 02:18.000
This is not your bike!

02:18.000 --> 02:19.000
This is not your bike!

02:19.000 --> 02:20.000
This is not your bike!

02:20.000 --> 02:21.000
This is not your bike!

02:21.000 --> 02:22.000
This is not your bike!

02:27.000 --> 02:28.000
This is not your bike!

02:28.000 --> 02:29.000
This is not your bike!

02:29.000 --> 02:30.000
This is not your bike!

02:30.000 --> 02:31.000
This is not your bike!

02:31.000 --> 02:32.000
This is not your bike!

02:32.000 --> 02:33.000
This is not your bike!

02:33.000 --> 02:34.000
This is not your bike!

02:34.000 --> 02:35.000
This is not your bike!

02:35.000 --> 02:36.000
This is not your bike!

02:36.000 --> 02:37.000
This is not your bike!

02:37.000 --> 02:38.000
This is not your bike!

02:38.000 --> 02:39.000
This is not your bike!

02:39.000 --> 02:40.000
This is not your bike!

02:40.000 --> 02:41.000
This is not your bike!

02:41.000 --> 02:42.000
This is not your bike!

02:42.000 --> 02:43.000
This is not your bike!

02:43.000 --> 02:44.000
This is not your bike!

02:44.000 --> 02:45.000
This is not your bike!

02:45.000 --> 02:46.000
This is not your bike!

02:46.000 --> 02:47.000
This is not your bike!

02:47.000 --> 02:48.000
This is not your bike!

02:48.000 --> 02:49.000
This is not your bike!

02:49.000 --> 02:50.000
This is not your bike!

02:50.000 --> 02:51.000
This is not your bike!

02:51.000 --> 02:52.000
This is not your bike!

02:52.000 --> 02:53.000
This is not your bike!

02:55.000 --> 02:56.000
This is not your bike!

02:56.000 --> 02:57.000
This is not your bike!

02:57.000 --> 02:58.000
This is not your bike!

02:58.000 --> 02:59.000
This is not your bike!

02:59.000 --> 03:00.000
This is not your bike!

03:00.000 --> 03:01.000
This is not your bike!

03:01.000 --> 03:02.000
This is not your bike!

03:02.000 --> 03:03.000
This is not your bike!

03:03.000 --> 03:04.000
This is not your bike!

03:04.000 --> 03:05.000
This is not your bike!

03:05.000 --> 03:06.000
This is not your bike!

03:06.000 --> 03:07.000
This is not your bike!

03:07.000 --> 03:08.000
This is not your bike!

03:08.000 --> 03:09.000
This is not your bike!

03:09.000 --> 03:10.000
This is not your bike!

03:10.000 --> 03:11.000
This is not your bike!

03:11.000 --> 03:12.000
This is not your bike!

03:12.000 --> 03:13.000
This is not your bike!

03:13.000 --> 03:14.000
This is not your bike!

03:14.000 --> 03:15.000
This is not your bike!

03:15.000 --> 03:16.000
This is not your bike!

03:16.000 --> 03:17.000
This is not your bike!

03:17.000 --> 03:18.000
This is not your bike!

03:18.000 --> 03:19.000
This is not your bike!

03:19.000 --> 03:20.000
This is not your bike!

03:20.000 --> 03:21.000
This is not your bike!

03:21.000 --> 03:22.000
This is not your bike!

03:22.000 --> 03:23.000
This is not your bike!

03:26.000 --> 03:30.800
Does the person who's posting this clip want me to come to a specific conclusion that is

03:30.800 --> 03:31.860
good for them?

03:31.860 --> 03:35.860
Could they have left out context, while not outright lying, that would weaken their position

03:35.860 --> 03:37.060
if it was included?

03:37.060 --> 03:40.720
The Citi Bike footage doesn't contain much in it on its own that points to either party

03:40.720 --> 03:41.720
being guilty.

03:41.720 --> 03:45.740
But the fact that a known race hustler like Tariq Nasheed came out so strong with this

03:45.740 --> 03:48.240
bullshit makes me think that there's an angle here.

03:48.240 --> 03:52.180
In any case, because when it comes to online hate mobs, things are leaning leftward right

03:52.180 --> 03:53.180
now.

03:53.360 --> 03:57.180
This person was branded on Twitter and TikTok as a racist Karen who was trying to steal

03:57.180 --> 03:59.540
from these poor innocent black youths.

03:59.540 --> 04:03.420
She's a nurse at Bellevue Hospital and as a result of the viral clip, the hospital announced

04:03.420 --> 04:04.940
that they were investigating her.

04:04.940 --> 04:05.940
You know what?

04:05.940 --> 04:09.080
I feel the same way about this as I did about Bodega Bro from before.

04:09.080 --> 04:12.320
Why the fuck are people getting fired for what they do off the clock?

04:12.320 --> 04:15.420
Random nurses and engineers aren't the same as being a front man for a company.

04:15.420 --> 04:18.800
When you punch out, your boss has no business controlling what you do.

04:18.800 --> 04:22.340
And despite the anti-capitalist bent of the left, they're the ones who normalize this

04:22.340 --> 04:26.020
bullshit of corpos firing you arbitrarily for what you do off the clock.

04:26.020 --> 04:29.580
It's like I've been saying this whole time now, the fungible economics that the left

04:29.580 --> 04:33.280
hates are necessary to create the fungible culture that the left wants.

04:33.280 --> 04:37.300
Now it did ultimately turn out that the woman had paid for the bike, not the black kid.

04:37.300 --> 04:41.540
But before we get into that conversation, let me quickly explain how City Bike works.

04:41.540 --> 04:45.220
In some larger cities, you'll find a bunch of identical bikes locked up in public terminals

04:45.220 --> 04:46.380
like this.

04:46.380 --> 04:49.980
Sometimes it's a publicly owned operation, generally tied to that city's transit service,

04:49.980 --> 04:51.860
like LA's Metro Bike.

04:51.860 --> 04:54.940
Sometimes it's a private company providing the service, like City Bike in New York, which

04:54.940 --> 04:56.440
is where the viral video took place.

04:56.440 --> 04:57.900
But the idea is the same either way.

04:57.900 --> 05:00.780
There's a bunch of terminals across the city with bikes that are locked up.

05:00.780 --> 05:03.820
You've got an account with the service, and sometimes you have a card, sometimes an

05:03.820 --> 05:04.820
app on your phone.

05:04.820 --> 05:07.800
You go to the terminal, you scan your account, you take a bike out, and then you can return

05:07.800 --> 05:09.860
the bike to any other terminal in the city.

05:09.860 --> 05:11.640
It doesn't have to be the one that you grabbed it from.

05:11.640 --> 05:15.920
Some services charge for how long the bike is undocked, some for how far you travel.

05:15.920 --> 05:19.740
Some just have a flat monthly fee, but they all allow you to pick up and dock bikes at

05:19.740 --> 05:22.920
any terminal in the city, which is an important part of this conversation.

05:22.920 --> 05:26.340
The nurse ended up producing receipts, through her lawyer because, of course, she almost

05:26.340 --> 05:28.300
got fired for a fucking viral clip.

05:28.300 --> 05:29.800
I don't blame her for retaining one.

05:29.800 --> 05:33.480
The receipts showed that she was indeed the person who had rented out the City Bike in

05:33.480 --> 05:34.480
question.

05:34.480 --> 05:38.120
She claimed that after a 12-hour shift at the hospital, she went to a nearby City Bike

05:38.120 --> 05:42.060
dock, with bikes that were docked and available for rent, and paid for a bike through the

05:42.060 --> 05:43.700
City Bike app on her phone.

05:43.700 --> 05:47.700
As she backed it up from the docking station, a group of five people approached her and

05:47.700 --> 05:49.480
claimed the bike was theirs.

05:49.480 --> 05:53.340
They physically pushed the bike, with her on it, back into the docking station, causing

05:53.340 --> 05:54.440
it to re-lock.

05:54.440 --> 05:58.300
One of the men then covered the bike's QR code, stopping her from paying again so that

05:58.300 --> 05:59.300
she could leave.

05:59.300 --> 06:02.460
In doing so, the man's arm was pushing against her pregnant stomach.

06:02.460 --> 06:05.440
It's kinda hard to make out in the video, but yeah, she was pregnant.

06:05.440 --> 06:08.420
The woman's two receipts from City Bike corroborate this story.

06:08.420 --> 06:13.180
One of them shows that a bike was checked out at 7.24pm on May 12th, and then returned

06:13.180 --> 06:14.420
less than a minute later.

06:14.420 --> 06:17.420
This was when the men forcibly pushed the bike back into the dock.

06:17.420 --> 06:21.240
The second receipt, from several minutes later and after the viral video had concluded,

06:21.240 --> 06:23.300
was the bike that she used to finally get home.

06:23.300 --> 06:27.100
The narrative from progressives that the black guys had taken the bike out and she was trying

06:27.100 --> 06:30.680
to steal it and weaponize her white woman tears seems to be false.

06:30.680 --> 06:33.940
But also, the narrative that the black guys were trying to take the bike that she rented

06:33.940 --> 06:37.620
out from her also seems to be false, as they re-docked it and prevented her from taking

06:37.620 --> 06:38.620
it out.

06:38.620 --> 06:41.480
If they wanted it on her time, they would have taken it, not re-docked it.

06:41.480 --> 06:43.020
Here's what actually happened.

06:43.020 --> 06:46.480
In a May 25th article, where the mother of one of the guys was interviewed, she made

06:46.480 --> 06:49.540
the claim that no one had bothered to ask him for his side of the story.

06:49.540 --> 06:53.520
That he's only 17 years old, he's just a baby, he's only in high school, he should

06:53.520 --> 06:57.040
be planning to attend prom and graduate, but now people are being racist towards him.

06:57.040 --> 07:00.360
They're a poor family, they're immigrants, they can't afford to fight any of this.

07:00.360 --> 07:03.440
Of course, they had their names protected in the article, and nobody actually knows

07:03.440 --> 07:04.640
who this kid is.

07:04.640 --> 07:07.920
So how can anybody ask him for a side of the story if they don't know how to contact

07:07.920 --> 07:08.920
him?

07:08.920 --> 07:12.660
The guy himself said, if they have my side of the story, she doesn't have a case.

07:12.660 --> 07:15.380
So let's hear him tell his side of the story.

07:15.380 --> 07:19.020
He and his friends walked around the Bronx for 20 minutes looking for a city bike before

07:19.020 --> 07:20.180
they finally found some.

07:20.180 --> 07:23.660
They rode the bikes to Harlem and stopped riding after 45 minutes.

07:23.660 --> 07:27.120
He explained that the price goes up after 45 minutes of continuous use.

07:27.120 --> 07:30.500
So he and his friends docked their bikes, waited for the rate to cool down again, and

07:30.500 --> 07:34.380
then took out the bikes again to go from Harlem to the Lower East Side of Manhattan.

07:34.380 --> 07:36.940
They docked the bikes again at 719pm.

07:36.940 --> 07:41.220
He admits, in his own retelling of events, that he and his friends were camping on the

07:41.220 --> 07:44.860
bikes without paying for them while they waited for their fare to go down again.

07:44.860 --> 07:49.960
The nurse then shows up and decides to use a bike at 724pm, which the boys intended to

07:49.960 --> 07:53.140
rent out once they could, but they hadn't actually claimed it yet.

07:53.140 --> 07:54.620
And that's when the viral video starts.

07:54.620 --> 07:58.260
Now, I don't know why he thought this retelling of events would help him, because it proves

07:58.260 --> 08:00.180
he was entirely in the wrong.

08:00.180 --> 08:03.380
This is like holding a taxi that you want for 15 minutes without actually paying for

08:03.380 --> 08:04.380
it.

08:04.380 --> 08:07.300
It's not yours just because you used it and intend to use it again in the future.

08:07.300 --> 08:10.140
If it's not rented out, it's not yours, simple as that.

08:10.140 --> 08:13.760
And we can prove that this is exactly what happened by looking at the receipts.

08:13.760 --> 08:17.220
The serial number of the bike is 5603915.

08:17.220 --> 08:22.320
You can see that this specific bike was docked in Harlem at 606pm, and then again in Manhattan

08:22.320 --> 08:23.580
at 719pm.

08:23.580 --> 08:28.140
The bike is then attempted to be taken out of the dock at 724, again at 725, and then

08:28.140 --> 08:31.640
is finally rented out at 759 and used as intended.

08:31.640 --> 08:35.900
That's a 40 minute break where this guy just camped out on this bike and didn't

08:35.900 --> 08:38.040
pay for it and kept others from using it.

08:38.040 --> 08:42.080
And this is why you can hear in the background of that original viral video when bystanders

08:42.080 --> 08:46.320
asked the two to just check the apps on their phone to see who actually has the bike, he

08:46.320 --> 08:58.280
refused to do it.

08:58.280 --> 09:02.120
The guy's sister also made a TikTok video where she blatantly admits that her brother

09:02.120 --> 09:05.080
didn't actually have the bike rented out, but that the nurse still shouldn't have

09:05.080 --> 09:31.720
been able to take it because the bike was in his possession.

09:31.720 --> 09:38.800
Bike number 5603915 was in my brother's possession from St. Nicholas Avenue and Manhattan Ave

09:38.800 --> 09:45.860
all the way to First Avenue and East 30th Street from the hours of 633pm to 719pm.

09:45.860 --> 09:51.560
At 719pm they dock the bikes, Sarah Jane Comrie walks up to them, asks, hey guys, can I use

09:51.560 --> 09:53.760
one of you guys' bikes?

09:53.760 --> 09:59.720
She says this as there are other bikes sitting idle at the bike rack.

09:59.720 --> 10:04.600
They politely decline, she asks them again, mentions that she's pregnant, and they still

10:04.600 --> 10:05.600
decline.

10:05.600 --> 10:10.720
Then, with my brother standing next to the bike with his hands on the handlebars, she

10:10.720 --> 10:18.080
jumps onto the bike, sits on the bike, and scans the QR code, thus beginning her ride.

10:18.080 --> 10:21.360
Mind you, the bike was in my brother's possession at this time.

10:21.360 --> 10:22.980
Bitch, that ain't how this works.

10:22.980 --> 10:26.320
This isn't like Harry Potter Goblins, where the new owner of an object isn't actually

10:26.320 --> 10:28.000
the owner despite having bought it.

10:28.000 --> 10:31.320
Of course, it turned out that the sister isn't exactly a person of good character either,

10:31.320 --> 10:35.040
as a quick internet dig discovered that she's actually just a disgusting racist.

10:35.040 --> 10:38.580
It turns out that black and Latino riders in the New York subway were disproportionately

10:38.580 --> 10:42.780
not paying for their fare, and that the police were instructed to, quote, go after them for

10:42.780 --> 10:43.780
it.

10:43.780 --> 10:48.800
In response, the sister said, we hop in anyway, fuck MTA, fuck racism, fuck white people.

10:48.800 --> 10:51.600
I guess racism is when you make people pay for their subway fare?

10:51.600 --> 10:54.800
The quality of my life has improved greatly since I stopped moving out of the way for

10:54.800 --> 10:55.800
white people.

10:55.800 --> 10:59.880
It's so crazy, because you see how this shit get ugly, but it's so, so, so crazy

10:59.880 --> 11:03.840
seeing my little brother and his friends be harassed by a white bitch for no reason over

11:03.840 --> 11:05.160
a damn city bike.

11:05.160 --> 11:07.280
She can kiss dat job goodbye.

11:07.280 --> 11:10.720
Every day I wish they jeans ain't mutate to create white people.

11:10.720 --> 11:13.660
Yeah, this person's actually just a piece of trash.

11:13.660 --> 11:17.220
Like I said earlier, leftoid talking heads were quick to jump on the dog pile.

11:17.220 --> 11:21.140
It should surprise nobody that people like Vash called for her to be fired over what

11:21.140 --> 11:24.640
basically amounted to being correct, but having bad optics.

11:24.640 --> 11:28.180
Is this an opportunity for me to demonstrate how not racist I am?

11:28.180 --> 11:29.960
Of course she would be a nurse.

11:29.960 --> 11:32.460
Dude, nurses are fucking psychotic.

11:32.460 --> 11:35.160
I swear to God, nurses are like female cops.

11:35.160 --> 11:39.400
That's like the female version of being a cop where you're, you're a horrible, abusive

11:39.400 --> 11:42.520
piece of shit and you want to, you get out of school and you want to like have control

11:42.520 --> 11:43.520
over people's lives.

11:43.520 --> 11:47.240
The, the black guy, they rented the bike and then the white lady came over and just wanted

11:47.240 --> 11:50.240
to take it and then just started shouting help.

11:50.240 --> 11:51.600
This is so petty on her part.

11:51.600 --> 11:52.960
It's not, it's not petty.

11:52.960 --> 11:56.360
She's trying to steal the bike and or get these black guys arrested.

11:56.360 --> 12:04.400
These, these women, women, this woman is, um, either a sociopath, a racist or both.

12:04.400 --> 12:10.480
And it's just trying to like nab simultaneously a free bike and also just get some black guys

12:10.480 --> 12:11.720
arrested.

12:11.720 --> 12:15.240
It's like, this is an attack that could literally endanger their lives.

12:15.240 --> 12:16.240
It sure is.

12:16.240 --> 12:20.200
It sure is fucking crazy that if you're a black guy, like at any point in time, a white

12:20.200 --> 12:25.840
woman could just lock onto you and, and just decide to like ruin your life.

12:25.840 --> 12:26.840
Yeah.

12:26.840 --> 12:30.680
She like instantly stops crying to realize the moment she realized it's not working.

12:30.680 --> 12:31.680
Yeah.

12:31.680 --> 12:33.560
Wait, is this in, Oh, this is New York city.

12:33.560 --> 12:34.840
She should be fired for this.

12:34.840 --> 12:43.480
I genuinely like if, if you see one of your nurses, a person who holds the life of patients

12:43.480 --> 12:50.160
in their hands and you see this insane psycho fucking sociopath shit, she should be fired

12:50.160 --> 12:51.160
immediately.

12:51.160 --> 12:52.160
Yeah.

12:52.160 --> 12:53.760
He walked it back later and deleted the original video.

12:53.760 --> 12:56.280
But imagine being somebody like this guy.

12:56.280 --> 13:00.040
Imagine that you have a career of giving the shittiest take imaginable based solely on

13:00.040 --> 13:01.320
knee-jerk feels.

13:01.320 --> 13:06.760
A take that ends up being entirely wrong, but jives very well with your audience's politics.

13:06.760 --> 13:09.840
And then when it finally comes out that you actually were wrong, you get extra brownie

13:09.840 --> 13:13.600
points with the retards that watch you for coming out and bravely admitting that you

13:13.600 --> 13:14.600
were wrong.

13:14.600 --> 13:18.600
When the obvious good thing to do is to not give the retarded take in the first place.

13:18.600 --> 13:21.760
The young Turks also had a response that was especially brain dead.

13:21.760 --> 13:26.840
A video has gone viral, appearing to show a white woman making an incredibly dramatic

13:26.840 --> 13:33.540
scene in New York city after she apparently, according to all that we know, tried to claim

13:33.540 --> 13:35.380
a rental bicycle.

13:35.380 --> 13:40.040
They just ran with outright lies, stuff they just made up because it made the nurse look

13:40.040 --> 13:41.040
worse.

13:41.040 --> 13:45.640
They assumed that she was drunk because she was get this in her work clothes.

13:45.640 --> 13:47.640
It's not that hard to figure out.

13:47.640 --> 13:52.320
If you're doing it on the app, it'll say which bike in which it it'll have a label

13:52.320 --> 13:57.200
at the docking station for which bike is she's in reference or they're both referencing.

13:57.200 --> 14:02.240
So honestly, it should have been pretty clear to her, but she's in work clothes.

14:02.240 --> 14:04.880
So my first thought was, is she drunk?

14:04.880 --> 14:09.520
Like she, I don't know, but she just seemed really out of it.

14:09.520 --> 14:13.640
And I, she straight up racist, totally.

14:13.640 --> 14:17.320
They ran with the white woman tears narrative, which is really funny because of anybody who's

14:17.320 --> 14:20.160
not progressive ever calls a woman out for fake crying.

14:20.160 --> 14:21.760
They're called misogynists.

14:21.760 --> 14:25.160
It looked like, you know, what we've seen in instances like this, you have the racial

14:25.160 --> 14:31.700
component of, um, you know, a white woman attempting to elicit some sort of response

14:31.700 --> 14:36.000
by kind of over-exaggerating the situation that's actually happening.

14:36.000 --> 14:38.200
I was just thinking of this woman.

14:38.200 --> 14:39.200
Yes, exactly.

14:39.200 --> 14:44.320
Like sort of implying like I'm in danger, everyone do what you do when a white woman

14:44.320 --> 14:47.400
is in danger and a black man's around do that thing.

14:47.400 --> 14:52.040
In fact, a decade ago, we saw the widespread mockery of male tears from white feminists.

14:52.040 --> 14:56.000
And it's funny how now that the culture has shifted even more leftward, those who

14:56.000 --> 14:58.640
were once protected by this rhetoric have now become its target.

14:58.640 --> 15:02.760
Does anybody remember this viral video from 2015 where a white woman walked through New

15:02.760 --> 15:05.440
York and was harassed by a bunch of black men?

15:05.440 --> 15:09.280
This was presented as by leftists at the time that were much more feminist oriented and

15:09.280 --> 15:14.360
less intersectional as being an example of male harassment and misogyny against women.

15:14.360 --> 15:17.280
If you pointed out the racial component of the video, by the way, you were called a racist

15:17.280 --> 15:18.520
and immediately shut down.

15:18.520 --> 15:23.240
But now in 2023, we have black men harassing a white woman and progressives are siding

15:23.240 --> 15:28.000
incorrectly with the black men this time because who is more or less oppressed has shifted

15:28.000 --> 15:31.040
around in the intersectional ranking system in the past 10 years.

15:31.040 --> 15:34.240
One of the clips that the Young Turks run in the background of their report is this

15:34.240 --> 15:38.680
video of a white woman in Central Park with her dog appearing to act unhinged towards

15:38.680 --> 15:40.720
the black man recording the event.

16:08.680 --> 16:20.680
I'm sorry, I'm going to ramble and there is a man, African-American, who has a feist moment.

16:20.680 --> 16:24.680
He is recording me and threatening me and my dog.

16:24.680 --> 16:28.680
There is an African-American man, I am in Central Park.

16:28.680 --> 16:32.680
He is recording me and threatening myself and my dog.

16:33.680 --> 16:37.680
I'm sorry, I can't hear you either.

16:37.680 --> 16:40.680
I'm being threatened by a man in the ramble.

16:40.680 --> 16:43.680
Please send the cops immediately.

16:43.680 --> 16:45.680
I'm in Central Park in the ramble.

16:45.680 --> 16:47.680
I don't know.

16:47.680 --> 16:49.680
Thank you.

16:49.680 --> 16:53.680
This was a previous viral video from 2020 that had a similar trajectory as the nurse

16:53.680 --> 16:54.680
one.

16:54.680 --> 16:57.680
Progressives knee-jerk siding with the black man, calling the woman a racist white Karen,

16:57.680 --> 17:00.680
and later on, context came out that she was actually in the right.

17:00.680 --> 17:04.680
But this time it wasn't even later on because the guy who took this clip uploaded it with

17:04.680 --> 17:06.680
this caption on his Facebook page.

17:06.680 --> 17:08.680
Central Park this morning.

17:08.680 --> 17:10.680
This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the ramble.

17:10.680 --> 17:11.680
Me.

17:11.680 --> 17:13.680
Ma'am, dogs in the ramble have to be on the leash at all times.

17:13.680 --> 17:14.680
The sign is right there.

17:14.680 --> 17:15.680
Her.

17:15.680 --> 17:16.680
The dog runs are closed.

17:16.680 --> 17:17.680
He needs his exercise.

17:17.680 --> 17:18.680
Me.

17:18.680 --> 17:20.680
All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the ramble, and

17:20.680 --> 17:22.680
you can let him run off the leash all you want.

17:22.680 --> 17:23.680
Her.

17:23.680 --> 17:24.680
It's too dangerous.

17:24.680 --> 17:25.680
Me.

17:25.680 --> 17:26.680
Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not

17:26.680 --> 17:27.680
going to like it.

17:27.680 --> 17:28.680
Her.

17:28.680 --> 17:29.680
What's that?

17:29.680 --> 17:30.680
Me to the dog.

17:30.680 --> 17:31.680
Come here, puppy.

17:31.680 --> 17:32.680
Her.

17:32.680 --> 17:33.680
He won't come to you.

17:33.680 --> 17:34.680
Me.

17:34.680 --> 17:35.680
We'll see about that.

17:35.680 --> 17:39.200
I pull out the dog treats that I carry around for just such an intransigence, okay?

17:39.200 --> 17:42.760
I didn't even get the chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab

17:42.760 --> 17:43.760
the dog.

17:43.760 --> 17:44.760
Don't you touch my dog!

17:44.760 --> 17:48.220
That's when I started recording video with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully

17:48.220 --> 17:49.920
emerged and took a dark turn.

17:49.920 --> 17:50.920
Like holy fuck, dude.

17:50.920 --> 17:55.840
This guy posted the clip with context, showing he planned to steal her dog, and progressives

17:55.840 --> 17:58.640
just ignored it and called him the victim.

17:58.680 --> 18:02.800
They saw a crying white woman and heard a black accent behind the camera, and their

18:02.800 --> 18:04.560
minds were automatically made up.

18:04.560 --> 18:06.100
No brainpower required.

18:06.100 --> 18:10.640
This event happened back on May 25, 2020, the same day as George Floyd's death.

18:10.640 --> 18:14.020
So while it did kinda go viral, it was largely overshadowed.

18:14.020 --> 18:17.120
When the media did comment on it, though, they had the same story.

18:17.120 --> 18:19.880
White women used their whiteness and femininity to destroy black men.

18:19.880 --> 18:24.200
The woman in this video was actually fired from her job as a result of the incident and

18:24.200 --> 18:28.340
was charged with filing a false police report, a charge that was dropped after she completed

18:28.340 --> 18:31.020
a five-session educational course about racism.

18:31.020 --> 18:35.940
Meanwhile, the man who recorded the video now has a Disney Plus TV show based around

18:35.940 --> 18:40.260
birdwatching and how powerful he is for being a black man in an area dominated by white

18:40.260 --> 18:41.260
people.

18:41.260 --> 18:44.160
You know, I understand how racists are created after this bullshit.

18:44.160 --> 18:48.780
This chick was entirely in the right to not want her dog be stolen, and called 911 because

18:48.780 --> 18:50.380
she felt like she had no other choice.

18:50.380 --> 18:55.640
But because he was black and she was white, she had to go through racial re-education.

18:55.640 --> 18:59.040
Most people don't regularly encounter the justice system, and if her only encounter

18:59.040 --> 19:03.740
with it is a traumatic experience where she's clearly correct and being punished for it.

19:03.740 --> 19:06.720
From her point of view, she's probably thinking that the government is actually full of black

19:06.720 --> 19:10.740
supremacists and woke white cucks trying to destroy the white race or something.

19:10.740 --> 19:15.240
If this guy were white, I promise you, every single progressive who wanted to see her destroyed

19:15.240 --> 19:17.080
would have immediately flipped that script.

19:17.080 --> 19:19.080
Oh dude, it's the patriarchy.

19:19.080 --> 19:20.080
She's just a woman.

19:20.080 --> 19:21.080
He's approaching her.

19:21.080 --> 19:22.160
She has no one with her.

19:22.160 --> 19:23.300
All the men are rapists.

19:23.300 --> 19:25.480
The cops won't help her because they're the patriarchy too.

19:25.480 --> 19:29.200
She's obviously reasonable to be scared because a male is approaching her, but mention

19:29.200 --> 19:32.920
that the male is black, and all that logic goes out the fucking window.

19:32.920 --> 19:36.760
We are actually at a place now where progressives will let black people do anything, no matter

19:36.760 --> 19:39.520
how awful, and excuse it because maracism.

19:39.520 --> 19:43.200
The progs have been moving in that direction for a while now, but I think that George Floyd

19:43.200 --> 19:44.520
hyper-accelerated it.

19:44.520 --> 19:47.800
A black dude could actually rape a progressive woman at this point, and she would literally

19:47.800 --> 19:49.400
say it's reparations.

19:49.400 --> 19:53.920
There's no shortage of clips online right now of black people behaving genuinely awfully.

19:53.920 --> 19:58.720
Looting, smashing, assaulting, and progressives are excusing it all because of their own racism.

19:58.720 --> 20:02.180
They're racist against whites, so they're happy to see whites be victims.

20:02.180 --> 20:04.900
And they're racist against blacks because they're unwilling to hold them to any sort

20:04.900 --> 20:06.800
of civilized fucking standard.

20:06.800 --> 20:10.520
Now there's definitely going to be some white supremacists out there who see these clips

20:10.520 --> 20:14.400
and claim that black people are actually just predisposed to be more violent, or they're

20:14.400 --> 20:16.480
somehow inferior, or they naturally hate whitey.

20:16.480 --> 20:19.780
That's not the argument that I'm making, and that is about as stupid as progressives

20:19.780 --> 20:21.200
who explain away the violence.

20:21.200 --> 20:24.520
The behavior of the people in these clips is inexcusable, but I'm not so dumb as to

20:24.520 --> 20:28.080
watch a dozen clips and assume that everybody of that demographic in those clips behaves

20:28.080 --> 20:29.080
this way.

20:29.080 --> 20:30.080
No.

20:30.080 --> 20:32.720
The issue here is specifically how the progressives are treating these clips.

20:32.720 --> 20:37.040
The person who watches nothing but a steady stream of videos showing black-on-white crime

20:37.040 --> 20:40.760
and nothing else will likely come out of the other end of that mind-fucked into being a

20:40.760 --> 20:42.000
white supremacist.

20:42.000 --> 20:44.720
But their media diet isn't indicative of reality.

20:44.720 --> 20:48.480
But at the same time, the progressives who display all of those clips and then say, nothing

20:48.480 --> 20:53.480
is wrong here and you're a racist for noticing a problem, only serve to make things worse.

20:53.480 --> 20:56.540
In other words, I'm not sitting here blowing smoke up your ass about how the events in

20:56.540 --> 20:59.040
these clips aren't happening, and it's good that they are.

20:59.040 --> 21:02.840
Nor am I sitting here saying that these clips prove that entire demographics behave in a

21:02.840 --> 21:03.840
certain way.

21:03.840 --> 21:07.380
I'm saying that the way progressives talk about these clips, the way that progressives

21:07.380 --> 21:12.420
talk about race, the way that progressives want black perpetrators of crime to be lionized

21:12.420 --> 21:16.660
as heroes, all of that feeds into the white supremacist narrative about race.

21:16.660 --> 21:18.720
Because progressives are fucking retarded.

21:18.720 --> 21:20.660
I know that meme about crime stats.

21:20.660 --> 21:23.880
I know which demographics disproportionately commit more crimes.

21:23.880 --> 21:28.280
I also know many people in those demographics who don't commit crime and hate those who

21:28.280 --> 21:30.100
do for making them look bad.

21:30.100 --> 21:33.740
The liberal answer to this sort of thing is understanding that differences between individuals

21:33.740 --> 21:36.740
is always larger than differences between racial groups.

21:36.740 --> 21:40.420
In other words, even if there's a documented disparity for crime rates between whites and

21:40.420 --> 21:44.420
blacks, the differences between two random black people or two random white people will

21:44.420 --> 21:48.240
always be larger than the differences between blacks and whites as groups.

21:48.240 --> 21:52.260
The point is, ultimately, none of this shit is okay, and most people talking about events

21:52.260 --> 21:55.600
like these tend to be racists, whether that's the white supremacist spitting up narratives

21:55.600 --> 21:59.540
about black crime and genetics, or the progressives claiming that the victims of black bad behavior

21:59.540 --> 22:01.500
are at fault because they're white.

22:01.500 --> 22:05.200
I would personally love to be done with this topic, but every single notable discourse

22:05.200 --> 22:07.880
that happened during my absence was race-based.

22:07.880 --> 22:08.880
So buckle up, chaps.

22:08.880 --> 22:10.340
We're going to be doing this for a while longer.
