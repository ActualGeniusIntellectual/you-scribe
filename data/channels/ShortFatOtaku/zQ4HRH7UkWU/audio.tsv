0	8920	I know I'm late to the party on this one, but if you saw yesterday's video you know
8920	9920	what's going on already.
9920	14360	So let's talk about the city bike controversy that went down back on May 14th.
14360	18320	Tariq Nasheed, the buckbroken himself, posted this viral tweet.
18320	22640	A suspected white supremacist woman tried to steal a city bike from a black kid after
22640	26320	he paid for it, and when him and his friends wouldn't allow her to steal it, she went
26320	30960	through all the Karen tactics to try to get the black youths hemmed up, screaming for
30960	33400	help, fake crying, mayo babbling.
33400	37000	At this point, if you've paid attention you've at least seen the original video, but let's
37000	38000	watch it anyway.
38000	39000	It's pretty short.

202000	203000	This is not your bike!
206000	210800	Does the person who's posting this clip want me to come to a specific conclusion that is
210800	211860	good for them?
211860	215860	Could they have left out context, while not outright lying, that would weaken their position
215860	217060	if it was included?
217060	220720	The Citi Bike footage doesn't contain much in it on its own that points to either party
220720	221720	being guilty.
221720	225740	But the fact that a known race hustler like Tariq Nasheed came out so strong with this
225740	228240	bullshit makes me think that there's an angle here.
228240	232180	In any case, because when it comes to online hate mobs, things are leaning leftward right
232180	233180	now.
233360	237180	This person was branded on Twitter and TikTok as a racist Karen who was trying to steal
237180	239540	from these poor innocent black youths.
239540	243420	She's a nurse at Bellevue Hospital and as a result of the viral clip, the hospital announced
243420	244940	that they were investigating her.
244940	245940	You know what?
245940	249080	I feel the same way about this as I did about Bodega Bro from before.
249080	252320	Why the fuck are people getting fired for what they do off the clock?
252320	255420	Random nurses and engineers aren't the same as being a front man for a company.
255420	258800	When you punch out, your boss has no business controlling what you do.
258800	262340	And despite the anti-capitalist bent of the left, they're the ones who normalize this
262340	266020	bullshit of corpos firing you arbitrarily for what you do off the clock.
266020	269580	It's like I've been saying this whole time now, the fungible economics that the left
269580	273280	hates are necessary to create the fungible culture that the left wants.
273280	277300	Now it did ultimately turn out that the woman had paid for the bike, not the black kid.
277300	281540	But before we get into that conversation, let me quickly explain how City Bike works.
281540	285220	In some larger cities, you'll find a bunch of identical bikes locked up in public terminals
285220	286380	like this.
286380	289980	Sometimes it's a publicly owned operation, generally tied to that city's transit service,
289980	291860	like LA's Metro Bike.
291860	294940	Sometimes it's a private company providing the service, like City Bike in New York, which
294940	296440	is where the viral video took place.
296440	297900	But the idea is the same either way.
297900	300780	There's a bunch of terminals across the city with bikes that are locked up.
300780	303820	You've got an account with the service, and sometimes you have a card, sometimes an
303820	304820	app on your phone.
304820	307800	You go to the terminal, you scan your account, you take a bike out, and then you can return
307800	309860	the bike to any other terminal in the city.
309860	311640	It doesn't have to be the one that you grabbed it from.
311640	315920	Some services charge for how long the bike is undocked, some for how far you travel.
315920	319740	Some just have a flat monthly fee, but they all allow you to pick up and dock bikes at
319740	322920	any terminal in the city, which is an important part of this conversation.
322920	326340	The nurse ended up producing receipts, through her lawyer because, of course, she almost
326340	328300	got fired for a fucking viral clip.
328300	329800	I don't blame her for retaining one.
329800	333480	The receipts showed that she was indeed the person who had rented out the City Bike in
333480	334480	question.
334480	338120	She claimed that after a 12-hour shift at the hospital, she went to a nearby City Bike
338120	342060	dock, with bikes that were docked and available for rent, and paid for a bike through the
342060	343700	City Bike app on her phone.
343700	347700	As she backed it up from the docking station, a group of five people approached her and
347700	349480	claimed the bike was theirs.
349480	353340	They physically pushed the bike, with her on it, back into the docking station, causing
353340	354440	it to re-lock.
354440	358300	One of the men then covered the bike's QR code, stopping her from paying again so that
358300	359300	she could leave.
359300	362460	In doing so, the man's arm was pushing against her pregnant stomach.
362460	365440	It's kinda hard to make out in the video, but yeah, she was pregnant.
365440	368420	The woman's two receipts from City Bike corroborate this story.
368420	373180	One of them shows that a bike was checked out at 7.24pm on May 12th, and then returned
373180	374420	less than a minute later.
374420	377420	This was when the men forcibly pushed the bike back into the dock.
377420	381240	The second receipt, from several minutes later and after the viral video had concluded,
381240	383300	was the bike that she used to finally get home.
383300	387100	The narrative from progressives that the black guys had taken the bike out and she was trying
387100	390680	to steal it and weaponize her white woman tears seems to be false.
390680	393940	But also, the narrative that the black guys were trying to take the bike that she rented
393940	397620	out from her also seems to be false, as they re-docked it and prevented her from taking
397620	398620	it out.
398620	401480	If they wanted it on her time, they would have taken it, not re-docked it.
401480	403020	Here's what actually happened.
403020	406480	In a May 25th article, where the mother of one of the guys was interviewed, she made
406480	409540	the claim that no one had bothered to ask him for his side of the story.
409540	413520	That he's only 17 years old, he's just a baby, he's only in high school, he should
413520	417040	be planning to attend prom and graduate, but now people are being racist towards him.
417040	420360	They're a poor family, they're immigrants, they can't afford to fight any of this.
420360	423440	Of course, they had their names protected in the article, and nobody actually knows
423440	424640	who this kid is.
424640	427920	So how can anybody ask him for a side of the story if they don't know how to contact
427920	428920	him?
428920	432660	The guy himself said, if they have my side of the story, she doesn't have a case.
432660	435380	So let's hear him tell his side of the story.
435380	439020	He and his friends walked around the Bronx for 20 minutes looking for a city bike before
439020	440180	they finally found some.
440180	443660	They rode the bikes to Harlem and stopped riding after 45 minutes.
443660	447120	He explained that the price goes up after 45 minutes of continuous use.
447120	450500	So he and his friends docked their bikes, waited for the rate to cool down again, and
450500	454380	then took out the bikes again to go from Harlem to the Lower East Side of Manhattan.
454380	456940	They docked the bikes again at 719pm.
456940	461220	He admits, in his own retelling of events, that he and his friends were camping on the
461220	464860	bikes without paying for them while they waited for their fare to go down again.
464860	469960	The nurse then shows up and decides to use a bike at 724pm, which the boys intended to
469960	473140	rent out once they could, but they hadn't actually claimed it yet.
473140	474620	And that's when the viral video starts.
474620	478260	Now, I don't know why he thought this retelling of events would help him, because it proves
478260	480180	he was entirely in the wrong.
480180	483380	This is like holding a taxi that you want for 15 minutes without actually paying for
483380	484380	it.
484380	487300	It's not yours just because you used it and intend to use it again in the future.
487300	490140	If it's not rented out, it's not yours, simple as that.
490140	493760	And we can prove that this is exactly what happened by looking at the receipts.
493760	497220	The serial number of the bike is 5603915.
497220	502320	You can see that this specific bike was docked in Harlem at 606pm, and then again in Manhattan
502320	503580	at 719pm.
503580	508140	The bike is then attempted to be taken out of the dock at 724, again at 725, and then
508140	511640	is finally rented out at 759 and used as intended.
511640	515900	That's a 40 minute break where this guy just camped out on this bike and didn't
515900	518040	pay for it and kept others from using it.
518040	522080	And this is why you can hear in the background of that original viral video when bystanders
522080	526320	asked the two to just check the apps on their phone to see who actually has the bike, he
526320	538280	refused to do it.
538280	542120	The guy's sister also made a TikTok video where she blatantly admits that her brother
542120	545080	didn't actually have the bike rented out, but that the nurse still shouldn't have
545080	571720	been able to take it because the bike was in his possession.
571720	578800	Bike number 5603915 was in my brother's possession from St. Nicholas Avenue and Manhattan Ave
578800	585860	all the way to First Avenue and East 30th Street from the hours of 633pm to 719pm.
585860	591560	At 719pm they dock the bikes, Sarah Jane Comrie walks up to them, asks, hey guys, can I use
591560	593760	one of you guys' bikes?
593760	599720	She says this as there are other bikes sitting idle at the bike rack.
599720	604600	They politely decline, she asks them again, mentions that she's pregnant, and they still
604600	605600	decline.
605600	610720	Then, with my brother standing next to the bike with his hands on the handlebars, she
610720	618080	jumps onto the bike, sits on the bike, and scans the QR code, thus beginning her ride.
618080	621360	Mind you, the bike was in my brother's possession at this time.
621360	622980	Bitch, that ain't how this works.
622980	626320	This isn't like Harry Potter Goblins, where the new owner of an object isn't actually
626320	628000	the owner despite having bought it.
628000	631320	Of course, it turned out that the sister isn't exactly a person of good character either,
631320	635040	as a quick internet dig discovered that she's actually just a disgusting racist.
635040	638580	It turns out that black and Latino riders in the New York subway were disproportionately
638580	642780	not paying for their fare, and that the police were instructed to, quote, go after them for
642780	643780	it.
643780	648800	In response, the sister said, we hop in anyway, fuck MTA, fuck racism, fuck white people.
648800	651600	I guess racism is when you make people pay for their subway fare?
651600	654800	The quality of my life has improved greatly since I stopped moving out of the way for
654800	655800	white people.
655800	659880	It's so crazy, because you see how this shit get ugly, but it's so, so, so crazy
659880	663840	seeing my little brother and his friends be harassed by a white bitch for no reason over
663840	665160	a damn city bike.
665160	667280	She can kiss dat job goodbye.
667280	670720	Every day I wish they jeans ain't mutate to create white people.
670720	673660	Yeah, this person's actually just a piece of trash.
673660	677220	Like I said earlier, leftoid talking heads were quick to jump on the dog pile.
677220	681140	It should surprise nobody that people like Vash called for her to be fired over what
681140	684640	basically amounted to being correct, but having bad optics.
684640	688180	Is this an opportunity for me to demonstrate how not racist I am?
688180	689960	Of course she would be a nurse.
689960	692460	Dude, nurses are fucking psychotic.
692460	695160	I swear to God, nurses are like female cops.
695160	699400	That's like the female version of being a cop where you're, you're a horrible, abusive
699400	702520	piece of shit and you want to, you get out of school and you want to like have control
702520	703520	over people's lives.
703520	707240	The, the black guy, they rented the bike and then the white lady came over and just wanted
707240	710240	to take it and then just started shouting help.
710240	711600	This is so petty on her part.
711600	712960	It's not, it's not petty.
712960	716360	She's trying to steal the bike and or get these black guys arrested.
716360	724400	These, these women, women, this woman is, um, either a sociopath, a racist or both.
724400	730480	And it's just trying to like nab simultaneously a free bike and also just get some black guys
730480	731720	arrested.
731720	735240	It's like, this is an attack that could literally endanger their lives.
735240	736240	It sure is.
736240	740200	It sure is fucking crazy that if you're a black guy, like at any point in time, a white
740200	745840	woman could just lock onto you and, and just decide to like ruin your life.
745840	746840	Yeah.
746840	750680	She like instantly stops crying to realize the moment she realized it's not working.
750680	751680	Yeah.
751680	753560	Wait, is this in, Oh, this is New York city.
753560	754840	She should be fired for this.
754840	763480	I genuinely like if, if you see one of your nurses, a person who holds the life of patients
763480	770160	in their hands and you see this insane psycho fucking sociopath shit, she should be fired
770160	771160	immediately.
771160	772160	Yeah.
772160	773760	He walked it back later and deleted the original video.
773760	776280	But imagine being somebody like this guy.
776280	780040	Imagine that you have a career of giving the shittiest take imaginable based solely on
780040	781320	knee-jerk feels.
781320	786760	A take that ends up being entirely wrong, but jives very well with your audience's politics.
786760	789840	And then when it finally comes out that you actually were wrong, you get extra brownie
789840	793600	points with the retards that watch you for coming out and bravely admitting that you
793600	794600	were wrong.
794600	798600	When the obvious good thing to do is to not give the retarded take in the first place.
798600	801760	The young Turks also had a response that was especially brain dead.
801760	806840	A video has gone viral, appearing to show a white woman making an incredibly dramatic
806840	813540	scene in New York city after she apparently, according to all that we know, tried to claim
813540	815380	a rental bicycle.
815380	820040	They just ran with outright lies, stuff they just made up because it made the nurse look
820040	821040	worse.
821040	825640	They assumed that she was drunk because she was get this in her work clothes.
825640	827640	It's not that hard to figure out.
827640	832320	If you're doing it on the app, it'll say which bike in which it it'll have a label
832320	837200	at the docking station for which bike is she's in reference or they're both referencing.
837200	842240	So honestly, it should have been pretty clear to her, but she's in work clothes.
842240	844880	So my first thought was, is she drunk?
844880	849520	Like she, I don't know, but she just seemed really out of it.
849520	853640	And I, she straight up racist, totally.
853640	857320	They ran with the white woman tears narrative, which is really funny because of anybody who's
857320	860160	not progressive ever calls a woman out for fake crying.
860160	861760	They're called misogynists.
861760	865160	It looked like, you know, what we've seen in instances like this, you have the racial
865160	871700	component of, um, you know, a white woman attempting to elicit some sort of response
871700	876000	by kind of over-exaggerating the situation that's actually happening.
876000	878200	I was just thinking of this woman.
878200	879200	Yes, exactly.
879200	884320	Like sort of implying like I'm in danger, everyone do what you do when a white woman
884320	887400	is in danger and a black man's around do that thing.
887400	892040	In fact, a decade ago, we saw the widespread mockery of male tears from white feminists.
892040	896000	And it's funny how now that the culture has shifted even more leftward, those who
896000	898640	were once protected by this rhetoric have now become its target.
898640	902760	Does anybody remember this viral video from 2015 where a white woman walked through New
902760	905440	York and was harassed by a bunch of black men?
905440	909280	This was presented as by leftists at the time that were much more feminist oriented and
909280	914360	less intersectional as being an example of male harassment and misogyny against women.
914360	917280	If you pointed out the racial component of the video, by the way, you were called a racist
917280	918520	and immediately shut down.
918520	923240	But now in 2023, we have black men harassing a white woman and progressives are siding
923240	928000	incorrectly with the black men this time because who is more or less oppressed has shifted
928000	931040	around in the intersectional ranking system in the past 10 years.
931040	934240	One of the clips that the Young Turks run in the background of their report is this
934240	938680	video of a white woman in Central Park with her dog appearing to act unhinged towards
938680	940720	the black man recording the event.
968680	980680	I'm sorry, I'm going to ramble and there is a man, African-American, who has a feist moment.
980680	984680	He is recording me and threatening me and my dog.
984680	988680	There is an African-American man, I am in Central Park.
988680	992680	He is recording me and threatening myself and my dog.
993680	997680	I'm sorry, I can't hear you either.
997680	1000680	I'm being threatened by a man in the ramble.
1000680	1003680	Please send the cops immediately.
1003680	1005680	I'm in Central Park in the ramble.
1005680	1007680	I don't know.
1007680	1009680	Thank you.
1009680	1013680	This was a previous viral video from 2020 that had a similar trajectory as the nurse
1013680	1014680	one.
1014680	1017680	Progressives knee-jerk siding with the black man, calling the woman a racist white Karen,
1017680	1020680	and later on, context came out that she was actually in the right.
1020680	1024680	But this time it wasn't even later on because the guy who took this clip uploaded it with
1024680	1026680	this caption on his Facebook page.
1026680	1028680	Central Park this morning.
1028680	1030680	This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the ramble.
1030680	1031680	Me.
1031680	1033680	Ma'am, dogs in the ramble have to be on the leash at all times.
1033680	1034680	The sign is right there.
1034680	1035680	Her.
1035680	1036680	The dog runs are closed.
1036680	1037680	He needs his exercise.
1037680	1038680	Me.
1038680	1040680	All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the ramble, and
1040680	1042680	you can let him run off the leash all you want.
1042680	1043680	Her.
1043680	1044680	It's too dangerous.
1044680	1045680	Me.
1045680	1046680	Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not
1046680	1047680	going to like it.
1047680	1048680	Her.
1048680	1049680	What's that?
1049680	1050680	Me to the dog.
1050680	1051680	Come here, puppy.
1051680	1052680	Her.
1052680	1053680	He won't come to you.
1053680	1054680	Me.
1054680	1055680	We'll see about that.
1055680	1059200	I pull out the dog treats that I carry around for just such an intransigence, okay?
1059200	1062760	I didn't even get the chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab
1062760	1063760	the dog.
1063760	1064760	Don't you touch my dog!
1064760	1068220	That's when I started recording video with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully
1068220	1069920	emerged and took a dark turn.
1069920	1070920	Like holy fuck, dude.
1070920	1075840	This guy posted the clip with context, showing he planned to steal her dog, and progressives
1075840	1078640	just ignored it and called him the victim.
1078680	1082800	They saw a crying white woman and heard a black accent behind the camera, and their
1082800	1084560	minds were automatically made up.
1084560	1086100	No brainpower required.
1086100	1090640	This event happened back on May 25, 2020, the same day as George Floyd's death.
1090640	1094020	So while it did kinda go viral, it was largely overshadowed.
1094020	1097120	When the media did comment on it, though, they had the same story.
1097120	1099880	White women used their whiteness and femininity to destroy black men.
1099880	1104200	The woman in this video was actually fired from her job as a result of the incident and
1104200	1108340	was charged with filing a false police report, a charge that was dropped after she completed
1108340	1111020	a five-session educational course about racism.
1111020	1115940	Meanwhile, the man who recorded the video now has a Disney Plus TV show based around
1115940	1120260	birdwatching and how powerful he is for being a black man in an area dominated by white
1120260	1121260	people.
1121260	1124160	You know, I understand how racists are created after this bullshit.
1124160	1128780	This chick was entirely in the right to not want her dog be stolen, and called 911 because
1128780	1130380	she felt like she had no other choice.
1130380	1135640	But because he was black and she was white, she had to go through racial re-education.
1135640	1139040	Most people don't regularly encounter the justice system, and if her only encounter
1139040	1143740	with it is a traumatic experience where she's clearly correct and being punished for it.
1143740	1146720	From her point of view, she's probably thinking that the government is actually full of black
1146720	1150740	supremacists and woke white cucks trying to destroy the white race or something.
1150740	1155240	If this guy were white, I promise you, every single progressive who wanted to see her destroyed
1155240	1157080	would have immediately flipped that script.
1157080	1159080	Oh dude, it's the patriarchy.
1159080	1160080	She's just a woman.
1160080	1161080	He's approaching her.
1161080	1162160	She has no one with her.
1162160	1163300	All the men are rapists.
1163300	1165480	The cops won't help her because they're the patriarchy too.
1165480	1169200	She's obviously reasonable to be scared because a male is approaching her, but mention
1169200	1172920	that the male is black, and all that logic goes out the fucking window.
1172920	1176760	We are actually at a place now where progressives will let black people do anything, no matter
1176760	1179520	how awful, and excuse it because maracism.
1179520	1183200	The progs have been moving in that direction for a while now, but I think that George Floyd
1183200	1184520	hyper-accelerated it.
1184520	1187800	A black dude could actually rape a progressive woman at this point, and she would literally
1187800	1189400	say it's reparations.
1189400	1193920	There's no shortage of clips online right now of black people behaving genuinely awfully.
1193920	1198720	Looting, smashing, assaulting, and progressives are excusing it all because of their own racism.
1198720	1202180	They're racist against whites, so they're happy to see whites be victims.
1202180	1204900	And they're racist against blacks because they're unwilling to hold them to any sort
1204900	1206800	of civilized fucking standard.
1206800	1210520	Now there's definitely going to be some white supremacists out there who see these clips
1210520	1214400	and claim that black people are actually just predisposed to be more violent, or they're
1214400	1216480	somehow inferior, or they naturally hate whitey.
1216480	1219780	That's not the argument that I'm making, and that is about as stupid as progressives
1219780	1221200	who explain away the violence.
1221200	1224520	The behavior of the people in these clips is inexcusable, but I'm not so dumb as to
1224520	1228080	watch a dozen clips and assume that everybody of that demographic in those clips behaves
1228080	1229080	this way.
1229080	1230080	No.
1230080	1232720	The issue here is specifically how the progressives are treating these clips.
1232720	1237040	The person who watches nothing but a steady stream of videos showing black-on-white crime
1237040	1240760	and nothing else will likely come out of the other end of that mind-fucked into being a
1240760	1242000	white supremacist.
1242000	1244720	But their media diet isn't indicative of reality.
1244720	1248480	But at the same time, the progressives who display all of those clips and then say, nothing
1248480	1253480	is wrong here and you're a racist for noticing a problem, only serve to make things worse.
1253480	1256540	In other words, I'm not sitting here blowing smoke up your ass about how the events in
1256540	1259040	these clips aren't happening, and it's good that they are.
1259040	1262840	Nor am I sitting here saying that these clips prove that entire demographics behave in a
1262840	1263840	certain way.
1263840	1267380	I'm saying that the way progressives talk about these clips, the way that progressives
1267380	1272420	talk about race, the way that progressives want black perpetrators of crime to be lionized
1272420	1276660	as heroes, all of that feeds into the white supremacist narrative about race.
1276660	1278720	Because progressives are fucking retarded.
1278720	1280660	I know that meme about crime stats.
1280660	1283880	I know which demographics disproportionately commit more crimes.
1283880	1288280	I also know many people in those demographics who don't commit crime and hate those who
1288280	1290100	do for making them look bad.
1290100	1293740	The liberal answer to this sort of thing is understanding that differences between individuals
1293740	1296740	is always larger than differences between racial groups.
1296740	1300420	In other words, even if there's a documented disparity for crime rates between whites and
1300420	1304420	blacks, the differences between two random black people or two random white people will
1304420	1308240	always be larger than the differences between blacks and whites as groups.
1308240	1312260	The point is, ultimately, none of this shit is okay, and most people talking about events
1312260	1315600	like these tend to be racists, whether that's the white supremacist spitting up narratives
1315600	1319540	about black crime and genetics, or the progressives claiming that the victims of black bad behavior
1319540	1321500	are at fault because they're white.
1321500	1325200	I would personally love to be done with this topic, but every single notable discourse
1325200	1327880	that happened during my absence was race-based.
1327880	1328880	So buckle up, chaps.
1328880	1330340	We're going to be doing this for a while longer.
