0	3240	Hello everyone, welcome to a very late TikTok Tuesday.
3240	8040	I'm recording this at 10pm, which means I have to record it and edit it and put it out
8040	10760	in two hours or else it's no longer TikTok Tuesday.
10760	11760	You think I'll get to it?
11760	12760	Let's hope so.
12760	14360	I've had a very busy day today.
14360	15360	My day isn't even done.
15360	16480	Listen to everything I've done today, guys.
16480	21240	I have researched and written and recorded and then canned it off today for editing a
21240	22960	script for tomorrow's video.
22960	26880	And after I'm done putting this out, I'm going to go make that video for tomorrow.
27040	30880	And then Naomi and I went to go see Oppenheimer, and I've recorded a vlog for my side channel
30880	33200	about that movie, so check that out tomorrow as well.
33200	36720	And then we came home, we did a stream of Final Fantasy XVI, me, Dave and Naomi, it
36720	37720	was a fun time.
37720	40620	And now here at the end of the day, I'm recording TikTok Tuesday.
40620	43240	No I didn't forget, I've just had a very, very busy day.
43240	46480	Let's see all the stuff you guys have saved up for me this week.
46480	51880	Oh, it's one of those environmental protests blocking the roads, eh?
51880	52880	It looks German.
52880	55880	Yeah, it is German, this is in Germany.
57880	58880	These guys are assholes.
58880	59880	I hate this.
59880	62880	It's like, get out of the, get out of the fucking road.
65880	69880	Like, you guys aren't even helping anything, just get out of the road.
71880	73880	Oh, this guy wants to throw down?
75880	77880	Was that like a kung fu stance?
77880	79880	Like, whoa.
79880	84880	I gotta like save up these clips and do an environmentalist video because there's so
84880	88880	many of them, just people being assholes, blocking the road, getting absolutely, like
88880	90880	accomplishing nothing, even for their own goals.
90880	93880	You know, it's just, ah fuck, just watching them makes my head hurt.
95880	102880	Oh, and this gotta be one of those like, one of those drug videos where you just like see
102880	109880	someone walking through a downtown core and just everyone hanging, oh, the music.
109880	111880	Yeah, I gotta mute that music, guys, I'm sorry.
111880	115880	All my TikTok Tuesdays keep getting copyright struck and it's kind of annoying, so I'm just
115880	116880	gonna mute that.
116880	121880	But yeah, you see all these videos like going through downtown just full of rubbish, garbage,
121880	126880	people who are high hanging around, prostitutes, needles, homeless people.
126880	130880	Look at this guy, he just slouched over high as fuck, like what the fuck, dude?
130880	132880	This shit is like just depressing.
132880	135880	I understand, you know, the right wingers right now saying don't live in a city, you
135880	136880	see this, I understand.
136880	140880	Not every city is like this, not every neighborhood in the city is like this, but definitely don't
140880	142880	live in the downtown core.
142880	144880	It's fucking brutal right now.
144880	146880	The drug problem is absolutely terrible.
146880	149880	Some of it's out of their control, you know, people fall on hard times, I understand, but
149880	154880	some of it is just a lack of virtue on their part, the inability to do the right thing.
154880	157880	People want to be all like harm reductionist, but no, on some level it is a moral failing
157880	159880	on the parts of the individual.
159880	161880	This is my meal, I call this girl dinner.
161880	163880	Girl dinner.
163880	164880	What?
164880	165880	Girl dinner.
165880	166880	What is girl dinner?
166880	167880	What is girl dinner?
167880	173080	In 1923, TikToker Livi Marr seemed to have coined the phrase girl dinner in a video responding
173080	178880	to another TikToker who had said, the ideal meal is the imagined meal of a medieval peasant.
178880	183660	Livi Marr shows her plate of breads and cheeses and says, I call this girl dinner.
183660	187440	As the video went viral, the concept started to spread as other women showed off their
187440	191400	various arrays of small portions that combined equal a meal.
191400	195560	The concept was big enough to gain recognition on Twitter where users began to parody.
195560	196560	As a fat guy I'm insulted.
196560	201640	Now, there's even a boy dinner variant seeing men on TikTok showing what their dinner looks
201640	202640	like.
202640	203640	This is my meal.
203640	204640	I call this boy dinner.
204640	205640	Boy dinner.
205640	213840	Boy dinner, also has garnered parodies on Twitter and TikTok, often with fans comparing boy
213840	216000	dinner and girl dinner side by side.
216000	217000	Is this the next thing?
217000	218280	Is this the new TikTok thing?
218280	221920	God, I know I make TikToks now, but I fucking hate TikTok.
221920	224440	The culture of the site's absolutely awful.
224440	228040	it just makes me like grown in disgust at the human race.
228040	230320	It's like, oh, girl dinners for me eat nothing.
230320	231160	All right.
231160	234420	Are we bringing back like the anorexic chic of the 1990s?
234420	235880	Of course you can go too far the other direction, right?
235880	237480	Like I'm living proof.
237480	240180	I am actually the fat guy you see on the screen right now.
240180	242780	Oh, we've seen this chick before.
242780	245160	This was the person who was like trans species
245160	247960	who believed that they were some kind of Hawk.
247960	249680	We saw it in a previous TikTok Tuesday.
249680	254280	Okay, let's get an update from the trans Hawk person.
254280	255120	Hi, my name is King
255120	256840	and I'm a non-human alternate at the ID system.
256840	258180	And I'm making a discord server
258180	259960	for people who experience wing dysphoria.
259960	262080	It's of course open systems with non-human headmates.
262080	265280	And it is also open to, I think they're called wing kin.
265280	267640	Literally anybody who experiences wing dysphoria.
267640	269080	Wing dysphoria.
269080	270480	They're folks who experienced wing dysphoria
270480	273020	and who get the Phantom wings.
273020	275540	I know we are all familiar with the feeling
275540	278920	of needing to stretch our wings and not being able to,
278920	281820	but is it as common of an experience
281820	284180	to feel like you have water on your wings?
285020	285840	And feel like your wings got wet.
285840	286680	You don't have wings.
286680	287520	Fluff them up and shake the water out.
287520	289100	You've never had wings.
289100	290980	And you can't, and it's frustrating.
290980	292120	Oh my God.
292120	294100	This is, I don't know if like TikTok
294100	295860	is breeding mental illness
295860	298140	or the mental illness always existed
298140	300420	and TikTok is just creating a place for it.
300420	302100	All right, so let me see if you can get that, right?
302100	304740	These people, they're systems, okay?
304740	307220	Systems are like the modern Zoomer term
307220	309540	for a person with multiple personalities, okay?
309540	311860	However, they treat it with like a more spiritual bent.
311860	314540	It's not the science of psychology.
314540	316920	Now it's like you have multiple spirits inhabiting you.
316920	321060	And some of these systems include non-human alters.
321060	322940	Other personalities are called alters, okay?
322940	325280	So you have, do I gotta do a video
325280	327320	on all this nonsense terminology?
327320	331040	So you have people with alters that are non-human,
331040	331980	like other species.
331980	334940	So for example, this person has a bird alter.
334940	336700	So a bird alternate personality
336700	338860	in their system of multiple personalities
338860	341660	because they're a bird actually,
342300	344500	and their brain is apparently wired to be like a bird
344500	345780	or so they claim.
345780	348180	They experience wing dysphoria.
348180	350380	So you know how like trans people experience
350380	351740	gender dysphoria where they feel like
351740	352940	they should be the other gender?
352940	354660	Wing dysphoria, presumably,
354660	356620	is when you feel like you should have wings
356620	358620	and parts of your neurons in your brain
358620	360920	are firing towards wings that don't exist
360920	362300	and it's causing dysphoria.
362300	365140	I'm pretty sure this is all just either made up cope
365140	368820	or like an extreme mental illness.
368820	370540	But I do not believe for a second
370540	374480	that anyone is actually inhabited by the spirit of an eagle.
374480	377500	You know, it almost sounds like weird occultist Nazi-ism
377500	378340	to say it like that.
378340	379180	You know, the spirit of the eagle.
379180	380540	That's something you could see the Nazis saying.
380540	382180	But here we are, guys.
382180	383860	You think Hitler had wing dysphoria?
383860	385460	Oh, there are only two genders.
385460	387140	It's just basic biology.
387140	387980	Based.
387980	388820	Hi, how you doing?
388820	391340	Welcome to advanced biology from a biologist.
391340	393060	You see that thing?
393060	393900	Oh, no.
393900	395100	So we're gonna go over some facts together.
395100	396540	But first off-
396540	399580	Is the fact that you've been ideologically captured,
399820	401340	is that what the fact is here?
401340	403340	Heavy trans day of visibility, right?
403340	405300	So sex and gender, not the same thing.
405300	406620	You've probably heard that before, right?
406620	407540	It's because it's true,
407540	410340	because biology actually has nothing to say about gender.
410340	411580	Oh my God.
414780	416220	That degree is worthless.
416220	418300	You might as well just start wiping your ass with it.
418300	419300	Yes, of course, there's gonna be
419300	421560	some socially constructed components of gender.
421560	422400	You wanna know why?
422400	424360	Because every single culture doesn't have
424360	427460	the same presentation of masculinity or femininity.
427460	429280	They have different types of clothing.
429840	430680	They have different practices.
430680	432800	They have different rituals, different habits.
432800	433940	All right, fair enough.
433940	435000	But you know what?
435000	438460	There's a reason that most male people
438460	441480	latch onto their culture's masculine gender role.
441480	444100	And most female people latch onto their culture's
444100	445480	feminine gender role.
445480	447880	Because there actually is something
447880	450720	in these gender roles that relates to biology.
450720	454720	You don't have that 99% overlap if that's not the case.
454720	456240	And that's why when you defer
456240	458200	to your basic biology 101 class
458200	459640	that you failed in high school,
459640	462000	you look like you don't know what you're talking about.
462000	463820	Gender is only loosely related to sex
463820	465120	in so far as we've identified
465120	466400	certain physical characteristics
466400	467840	and have arbitrarily decided
467840	469960	that this person belongs to this gender.
469960	471760	But there are a whole bunch of people from that gender
471760	474080	that don't have those physical characteristics.
474080	476200	It's almost like there's some variation to sex.
476200	477960	And that's because it's not a binary,
477960	480800	it's a bimodal distribution where you have two extreme ends
480800	483760	and most people following somewhere in the middle.
483760	485900	He's talking about intersex people.
485900	487800	And as far as I understand,
488280	491640	intersex people are very, very, very rare, okay?
491640	496600	And since he's a biologist, he should know this.
496600	498760	The sex page in Wikipedia.
498760	500460	Sex is the trait that determines
500460	503920	whether a sexually reproducing organism produces male
503920	508440	or female gametes, otherwise known as small mobile gametes,
508440	510520	spermatozoa, sperm, pollen,
510520	513800	while females produce larger non-motile gametes,
513800	515520	ova, often called egg cells.
515520	516360	That's it.
516400	518320	I know some people, even on the right wing,
518320	520040	some people on Twitter were grumbling
520040	523800	that I said that if you're neutered somehow,
523800	525840	you're neither male nor female.
525840	528520	That's true because sex is the trait
528520	531320	that determines whether a sexually reproducing organism
531320	532940	produces male or female gametes.
532940	533780	That's what it is.
533780	536280	The point is that we're talking here about biology.
536280	540120	And when this retard talks about the two extreme ends
540120	541800	and most people falling somewhere in the middle,
541800	544440	he's talking about secondary sex characteristics.
544440	546920	But that's not the primary sex characteristic.
546920	549880	The primary sex characteristic is what gametes you produce.
549880	551960	So it's possible, for example, to be intersex.
551960	554040	And so you're somebody who looks female
554040	557240	and has various female secondary sex characteristics.
557240	558440	So you have the hips and the butt
558440	560020	and the boobs and whatever,
560020	562680	but you don't produce large gametes
562680	564380	because you're some type of intersex.
564380	565820	But that's not most people.
565820	566900	As he says here,
566900	569280	most people falling somewhere in the middle.
569280	572160	No, most people aren't intersex.
572160	574800	Most people do not fall somewhere in the middle.
574800	577160	Most people either produce large gametes
577160	578880	or they produce small gametes.
578880	582260	And therefore they're either female or male and that's it.
582260	584160	But this idea that intersex people
584160	587200	completely invalidate the sex binary is ridiculous.
587200	590500	And also that you can use intersex people
590500	592940	to backdoor in trans issues
592940	594920	when trans people aren't intersex people.
594920	597200	A trans person who has not yet transitioned,
597200	599280	they're still male or female and that's that.
599280	600680	You could be intersex.
600680	602140	You could go your whole life
602980	604020	being intersex and never know it.
604020	607080	And the reason to that is because when you're born,
607080	608400	nobody tests you.
608400	610620	The doctor just decides what you look like
610620	611940	and assigns you with sex.
611940	614620	And the society then assigns you a gender
614620	616940	that is traditionally associated with that sex.
616940	618980	I really hate when people appeal to nature
618980	621000	when they're trying to erase trans or gay people,
621000	623020	because when you actually study the animal kingdom,
623020	625240	the concepts of male and female cease to function
625240	626080	as we understand it.
626080	627660	When you're talking about creatures
627660	630260	that have vastly different sexual dimorphism than us.
630260	631620	They still have sexual dimorphism.
631620	635300	Flop sexes or produce both gametes or reproduce a sexually.
635300	636940	Yep, those all exist.
636940	638520	But you know what?
638520	641960	I think the most complicated species
641960	645780	that can reproduce in a way that is not very strict,
645780	649160	large gametes, small gametes is like a crab.
649160	651860	There's a crab that can do some of this stuff.
651860	654040	Less complicated creatures than crabs.
654040	656140	Yeah, you have like bugs that do it.
656140	657920	You have plants that do it.
657920	660720	You have various single celled organisms that do it.
660720	662480	Once you start getting more complicated,
662480	665480	it's pretty much universally male, female,
665480	667160	large gamete, small gamete.
667160	668120	And that's just how it is.
668120	669160	Here's what's important
669160	670600	about what this guy's trying to do here.
670600	673880	He's taking the authority of his scientific background,
673880	675520	which let's give him the benefit of the doubt
675520	676400	and say that it's true.
676400	678120	And he didn't just buy a lab coat
678120	679960	for 15 bucks off of Amazon.
679960	682640	And he's saying that because I've studied this stuff,
682640	684080	therefore this is how it is.
684080	685800	But the questions he's posing,
685800	688400	they're actually not questions of science.
688400	689940	They're questions of philosophy.
689940	692980	So we can look at a group of traits and we can say,
692980	695080	okay, well, we have traits one, two, three, four, five.
695080	695920	All right.
695920	698080	And we're gonna group traits, you know,
698080	700400	one, two, three to be male traits
700400	703880	and traits four, five, six to be female traits.
703880	707880	The question, why should one, two and three be grouped?
707880	710480	And why should four, five and six be grouped?
710480	712240	That's a question of philosophy.
712240	715120	Science allows us to observe the traits.
715280	718680	Philosophy tells us how we should group what we observe.
718680	720960	There's observation of the real world
720960	723240	and then what we value out of that observation.
723240	724600	Two different questions.
724600	727360	He's saying that we should value
727360	728920	or the observations of the real world,
728920	731720	a specific way in line with his politics.
731720	734160	And he's saying, look, it's because I'm a scientist,
734160	737560	but he's not asking a scientific question.
737560	740680	He's not saying that, oh, you actually don't know
740680	743080	that this other scientific effect is happening
743080	744320	in the real world.
745040	746560	No, he's not saying anything like that.
746560	750800	What he's saying is we should group them in this method,
750800	753920	not in the method that has been traditionally used.
753920	756680	But that's ultimately a question of philosophy, not science.
756680	757800	Here's an example of what I mean.
757800	759620	Why is it that a guy who's six foot tall,
759620	761800	that guy is considered a tall man,
761800	765080	but a guy who is, to use my own height, five foot seven,
765080	766540	I'm considered short.
766540	767720	Why is that the case?
767720	770880	I mean, the five foot seven and the six foot O,
770880	772560	those are objective measurements.
772600	774440	We have in fact measured two people.
774440	775920	They are in fact this size,
775920	777920	but it's philosophy that determines
777920	781080	that we should classify six foot O as tall
781080	783120	and five foot seven as short.
783120	784180	We could do it differently.
784180	787200	We could in fact say that six foot two is where tall begins
787200	789700	and that people who are six foot O, they're actually short.
789700	791060	We could do it that way.
791060	793760	The issue ultimately is what our preferences are.
793760	795780	And that is at the heart of the philosophy.
795780	799020	This guy clearly has progressive preferences
799020	802820	and he's using his credentials to make those preferences,
802820	805620	to make that philosophy look like science,
805620	806500	but it actually isn't.
806500	808420	All right, let's do one more if we get out of here.
808420	810060	It's like every single day, you guys,
810060	811540	and this is why I play my whole time.
811540	813100	That voice, is this another trans one?
813100	814940	What's his name?
814940	815780	What's your name?
815780	816700	I'm Tony.
816700	818740	Yeah, your name's Alex and I'm gonna be calling your manager.
818740	820540	This guy called me sir.
820540	822540	I ain't gonna tell him his every shit yet.
822540	823940	Everywhere I go, I get called sir.
823940	824780	I'm so fucking hurt.
824780	826300	Why would you call a chick?
826300	828580	Take out your shit, you're a fucking.
829020	830220	It's cause you don't pass, dude.
830220	831060	That's why.
831060	832100	Stop trying to gaslight trans people
832100	834140	and tell us that we're crazy.
834140	837060	Well, you are kind of crazy to be honest.
837060	838620	Did you call me a sir again?
838620	839460	What was that?
839460	840860	You said goodnight, sir?
840860	842060	This is transphobic.
842060	843780	Now he's just fucking trolling.
843780	845900	You're a fucking bigot, Edward.
845900	847300	All right, Alex, you know what?
847300	848820	I can't wait to this day.
848820	851460	It's a slur, do you not understand?
851460	852980	Wait, is sir a slur now?
852980	855300	That's why she calls us a code n-word.
855300	856780	It's like calling him the n-word.
856820	858900	Oh my God, that's ridiculous.
858900	861340	I have the right to be pissed about it.
861340	862420	You fucking did.
862420	863580	I said all along that you weren't.
863580	865540	You fucking did you liar.
865540	867460	Cis people need to be held accountable
867460	868940	for having cute trans people.
868940	870740	And I'm not gonna put up with this shit anymore.
870740	871580	You're crazy, bro.
871580	872420	You're a fuck.
872420	873780	Don't call me a fuck, bro.
873780	874620	Don't call me bro.
874620	878300	Don't do slurs at me, you fucking piece of shit.
878300	879340	No, fuck you.
879340	880180	Oh my God.
880180	881020	Are you a cis?
881020	881860	Are you a fuck, bro?
881860	883620	You don't even fucking know me.
883620	884940	Oh my God, dude.
884940	886140	Don't fucking call me sir.
886980	888580	This is transphobia.
888580	890700	I really don't want you to come out of the store.
890700	892620	Yeah, you don't even know me.
892620	893700	Get the, okay.
893700	895340	Listen, listen here.
895340	897740	I'll properly gender you, okay?
897740	899780	You're being a fucking Karen.
899780	902620	There is this idea that like using the wrong pronouns
902620	905820	or using a dead name or saying like sir
905820	907100	or instead of ma'am or whatever,
907100	910580	that that is on par with the worst possible slurs.
910580	912100	Trans activists are claiming that now.
912100	915060	That it's like, it's on par with like saying the n-word,
915060	917380	not as a joke, but with like real hatred in your heart,
917380	919020	like saying it like that's what it is.
919020	921100	And it's like, no, you guys are fucking ridiculous.
921100	922380	It's that's so stupid.
922380	923320	That's so dumb.
923320	925060	Trans people are like, they're unironically
925060	925900	the most sensitive,
925900	927500	the most triggered fucking people right now.
927500	929820	It's a wild, some of them, some of them obviously
929820	932300	like not all, not all trans activists, let's say.
932300	934340	The craziest fucking people right now, dude.
934340	936540	All right, that's enough nonsense for me.
936540	938100	Hopefully I can get this up in time for midnight.
938100	939780	It's gonna be a race against the clock to edit it all.
939780	940980	I've got maybe an hour to do it.
940980	942140	Let's see if I can get it done guys.
942140	943060	If I can't here, you know what?
943060	944060	Here, post in the comments.
944060	946260	Did I actually get it out before midnight EST?
946260	947180	I don't know, let's see.
947180	950880	All right guys, I will see you next time.
950880	952140	Have a good one.
952140	952980	I love you.
