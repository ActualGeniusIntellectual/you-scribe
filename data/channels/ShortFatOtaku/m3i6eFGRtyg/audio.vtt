00:00.000 --> 00:03.240
Hello everyone, welcome to a very late TikTok Tuesday.

00:03.240 --> 00:08.040
I'm recording this at 10pm, which means I have to record it and edit it and put it out

00:08.040 --> 00:10.760
in two hours or else it's no longer TikTok Tuesday.

00:10.760 --> 00:11.760
You think I'll get to it?

00:11.760 --> 00:12.760
Let's hope so.

00:12.760 --> 00:14.360
I've had a very busy day today.

00:14.360 --> 00:15.360
My day isn't even done.

00:15.360 --> 00:16.480
Listen to everything I've done today, guys.

00:16.480 --> 00:21.240
I have researched and written and recorded and then canned it off today for editing a

00:21.240 --> 00:22.960
script for tomorrow's video.

00:22.960 --> 00:26.880
And after I'm done putting this out, I'm going to go make that video for tomorrow.

00:27.040 --> 00:30.880
And then Naomi and I went to go see Oppenheimer, and I've recorded a vlog for my side channel

00:30.880 --> 00:33.200
about that movie, so check that out tomorrow as well.

00:33.200 --> 00:36.720
And then we came home, we did a stream of Final Fantasy XVI, me, Dave and Naomi, it

00:36.720 --> 00:37.720
was a fun time.

00:37.720 --> 00:40.620
And now here at the end of the day, I'm recording TikTok Tuesday.

00:40.620 --> 00:43.240
No I didn't forget, I've just had a very, very busy day.

00:43.240 --> 00:46.480
Let's see all the stuff you guys have saved up for me this week.

00:46.480 --> 00:51.880
Oh, it's one of those environmental protests blocking the roads, eh?

00:51.880 --> 00:52.880
It looks German.

00:52.880 --> 00:55.880
Yeah, it is German, this is in Germany.

00:57.880 --> 00:58.880
These guys are assholes.

00:58.880 --> 00:59.880
I hate this.

00:59.880 --> 01:02.880
It's like, get out of the, get out of the fucking road.

01:05.880 --> 01:09.880
Like, you guys aren't even helping anything, just get out of the road.

01:11.880 --> 01:13.880
Oh, this guy wants to throw down?

01:15.880 --> 01:17.880
Was that like a kung fu stance?

01:17.880 --> 01:19.880
Like, whoa.

01:19.880 --> 01:24.880
I gotta like save up these clips and do an environmentalist video because there's so

01:24.880 --> 01:28.880
many of them, just people being assholes, blocking the road, getting absolutely, like

01:28.880 --> 01:30.880
accomplishing nothing, even for their own goals.

01:30.880 --> 01:33.880
You know, it's just, ah fuck, just watching them makes my head hurt.

01:35.880 --> 01:42.880
Oh, and this gotta be one of those like, one of those drug videos where you just like see

01:42.880 --> 01:49.880
someone walking through a downtown core and just everyone hanging, oh, the music.

01:49.880 --> 01:51.880
Yeah, I gotta mute that music, guys, I'm sorry.

01:51.880 --> 01:55.880
All my TikTok Tuesdays keep getting copyright struck and it's kind of annoying, so I'm just

01:55.880 --> 01:56.880
gonna mute that.

01:56.880 --> 02:01.880
But yeah, you see all these videos like going through downtown just full of rubbish, garbage,

02:01.880 --> 02:06.880
people who are high hanging around, prostitutes, needles, homeless people.

02:06.880 --> 02:10.880
Look at this guy, he just slouched over high as fuck, like what the fuck, dude?

02:10.880 --> 02:12.880
This shit is like just depressing.

02:12.880 --> 02:15.880
I understand, you know, the right wingers right now saying don't live in a city, you

02:15.880 --> 02:16.880
see this, I understand.

02:16.880 --> 02:20.880
Not every city is like this, not every neighborhood in the city is like this, but definitely don't

02:20.880 --> 02:22.880
live in the downtown core.

02:22.880 --> 02:24.880
It's fucking brutal right now.

02:24.880 --> 02:26.880
The drug problem is absolutely terrible.

02:26.880 --> 02:29.880
Some of it's out of their control, you know, people fall on hard times, I understand, but

02:29.880 --> 02:34.880
some of it is just a lack of virtue on their part, the inability to do the right thing.

02:34.880 --> 02:37.880
People want to be all like harm reductionist, but no, on some level it is a moral failing

02:37.880 --> 02:39.880
on the parts of the individual.

02:39.880 --> 02:41.880
This is my meal, I call this girl dinner.

02:41.880 --> 02:43.880
Girl dinner.

02:43.880 --> 02:44.880
What?

02:44.880 --> 02:45.880
Girl dinner.

02:45.880 --> 02:46.880
What is girl dinner?

02:46.880 --> 02:47.880
What is girl dinner?

02:47.880 --> 02:53.080
In 1923, TikToker Livi Marr seemed to have coined the phrase girl dinner in a video responding

02:53.080 --> 02:58.880
to another TikToker who had said, the ideal meal is the imagined meal of a medieval peasant.

02:58.880 --> 03:03.660
Livi Marr shows her plate of breads and cheeses and says, I call this girl dinner.

03:03.660 --> 03:07.440
As the video went viral, the concept started to spread as other women showed off their

03:07.440 --> 03:11.400
various arrays of small portions that combined equal a meal.

03:11.400 --> 03:15.560
The concept was big enough to gain recognition on Twitter where users began to parody.

03:15.560 --> 03:16.560
As a fat guy I'm insulted.

03:16.560 --> 03:21.640
Now, there's even a boy dinner variant seeing men on TikTok showing what their dinner looks

03:21.640 --> 03:22.640
like.

03:22.640 --> 03:23.640
This is my meal.

03:23.640 --> 03:24.640
I call this boy dinner.

03:24.640 --> 03:25.640
Boy dinner.

03:25.640 --> 03:33.840
Boy dinner, also has garnered parodies on Twitter and TikTok, often with fans comparing boy

03:33.840 --> 03:36.000
dinner and girl dinner side by side.

03:36.000 --> 03:37.000
Is this the next thing?

03:37.000 --> 03:38.280
Is this the new TikTok thing?

03:38.280 --> 03:41.920
God, I know I make TikToks now, but I fucking hate TikTok.

03:41.920 --> 03:44.440
The culture of the site's absolutely awful.

03:44.440 --> 03:48.040
it just makes me like grown in disgust at the human race.

03:48.040 --> 03:50.320
It's like, oh, girl dinners for me eat nothing.

03:50.320 --> 03:51.160
All right.

03:51.160 --> 03:54.420
Are we bringing back like the anorexic chic of the 1990s?

03:54.420 --> 03:55.880
Of course you can go too far the other direction, right?

03:55.880 --> 03:57.480
Like I'm living proof.

03:57.480 --> 04:00.180
I am actually the fat guy you see on the screen right now.

04:00.180 --> 04:02.780
Oh, we've seen this chick before.

04:02.780 --> 04:05.160
This was the person who was like trans species

04:05.160 --> 04:07.960
who believed that they were some kind of Hawk.

04:07.960 --> 04:09.680
We saw it in a previous TikTok Tuesday.

04:09.680 --> 04:14.280
Okay, let's get an update from the trans Hawk person.

04:14.280 --> 04:15.120
Hi, my name is King

04:15.120 --> 04:16.840
and I'm a non-human alternate at the ID system.

04:16.840 --> 04:18.180
And I'm making a discord server

04:18.180 --> 04:19.960
for people who experience wing dysphoria.

04:19.960 --> 04:22.080
It's of course open systems with non-human headmates.

04:22.080 --> 04:25.280
And it is also open to, I think they're called wing kin.

04:25.280 --> 04:27.640
Literally anybody who experiences wing dysphoria.

04:27.640 --> 04:29.080
Wing dysphoria.

04:29.080 --> 04:30.480
They're folks who experienced wing dysphoria

04:30.480 --> 04:33.020
and who get the Phantom wings.

04:33.020 --> 04:35.540
I know we are all familiar with the feeling

04:35.540 --> 04:38.920
of needing to stretch our wings and not being able to,

04:38.920 --> 04:41.820
but is it as common of an experience

04:41.820 --> 04:44.180
to feel like you have water on your wings?

04:45.020 --> 04:45.840
And feel like your wings got wet.

04:45.840 --> 04:46.680
You don't have wings.

04:46.680 --> 04:47.520
Fluff them up and shake the water out.

04:47.520 --> 04:49.100
You've never had wings.

04:49.100 --> 04:50.980
And you can't, and it's frustrating.

04:50.980 --> 04:52.120
Oh my God.

04:52.120 --> 04:54.100
This is, I don't know if like TikTok

04:54.100 --> 04:55.860
is breeding mental illness

04:55.860 --> 04:58.140
or the mental illness always existed

04:58.140 --> 05:00.420
and TikTok is just creating a place for it.

05:00.420 --> 05:02.100
All right, so let me see if you can get that, right?

05:02.100 --> 05:04.740
These people, they're systems, okay?

05:04.740 --> 05:07.220
Systems are like the modern Zoomer term

05:07.220 --> 05:09.540
for a person with multiple personalities, okay?

05:09.540 --> 05:11.860
However, they treat it with like a more spiritual bent.

05:11.860 --> 05:14.540
It's not the science of psychology.

05:14.540 --> 05:16.920
Now it's like you have multiple spirits inhabiting you.

05:16.920 --> 05:21.060
And some of these systems include non-human alters.

05:21.060 --> 05:22.940
Other personalities are called alters, okay?

05:22.940 --> 05:25.280
So you have, do I gotta do a video

05:25.280 --> 05:27.320
on all this nonsense terminology?

05:27.320 --> 05:31.040
So you have people with alters that are non-human,

05:31.040 --> 05:31.980
like other species.

05:31.980 --> 05:34.940
So for example, this person has a bird alter.

05:34.940 --> 05:36.700
So a bird alternate personality

05:36.700 --> 05:38.860
in their system of multiple personalities

05:38.860 --> 05:41.660
because they're a bird actually,

05:42.300 --> 05:44.500
and their brain is apparently wired to be like a bird

05:44.500 --> 05:45.780
or so they claim.

05:45.780 --> 05:48.180
They experience wing dysphoria.

05:48.180 --> 05:50.380
So you know how like trans people experience

05:50.380 --> 05:51.740
gender dysphoria where they feel like

05:51.740 --> 05:52.940
they should be the other gender?

05:52.940 --> 05:54.660
Wing dysphoria, presumably,

05:54.660 --> 05:56.620
is when you feel like you should have wings

05:56.620 --> 05:58.620
and parts of your neurons in your brain

05:58.620 --> 06:00.920
are firing towards wings that don't exist

06:00.920 --> 06:02.300
and it's causing dysphoria.

06:02.300 --> 06:05.140
I'm pretty sure this is all just either made up cope

06:05.140 --> 06:08.820
or like an extreme mental illness.

06:08.820 --> 06:10.540
But I do not believe for a second

06:10.540 --> 06:14.480
that anyone is actually inhabited by the spirit of an eagle.

06:14.480 --> 06:17.500
You know, it almost sounds like weird occultist Nazi-ism

06:17.500 --> 06:18.340
to say it like that.

06:18.340 --> 06:19.180
You know, the spirit of the eagle.

06:19.180 --> 06:20.540
That's something you could see the Nazis saying.

06:20.540 --> 06:22.180
But here we are, guys.

06:22.180 --> 06:23.860
You think Hitler had wing dysphoria?

06:23.860 --> 06:25.460
Oh, there are only two genders.

06:25.460 --> 06:27.140
It's just basic biology.

06:27.140 --> 06:27.980
Based.

06:27.980 --> 06:28.820
Hi, how you doing?

06:28.820 --> 06:31.340
Welcome to advanced biology from a biologist.

06:31.340 --> 06:33.060
You see that thing?

06:33.060 --> 06:33.900
Oh, no.

06:33.900 --> 06:35.100
So we're gonna go over some facts together.

06:35.100 --> 06:36.540
But first off-

06:36.540 --> 06:39.580
Is the fact that you've been ideologically captured,

06:39.820 --> 06:41.340
is that what the fact is here?

06:41.340 --> 06:43.340
Heavy trans day of visibility, right?

06:43.340 --> 06:45.300
So sex and gender, not the same thing.

06:45.300 --> 06:46.620
You've probably heard that before, right?

06:46.620 --> 06:47.540
It's because it's true,

06:47.540 --> 06:50.340
because biology actually has nothing to say about gender.

06:50.340 --> 06:51.580
Oh my God.

06:54.780 --> 06:56.220
That degree is worthless.

06:56.220 --> 06:58.300
You might as well just start wiping your ass with it.

06:58.300 --> 06:59.300
Yes, of course, there's gonna be

06:59.300 --> 07:01.560
some socially constructed components of gender.

07:01.560 --> 07:02.400
You wanna know why?

07:02.400 --> 07:04.360
Because every single culture doesn't have

07:04.360 --> 07:07.460
the same presentation of masculinity or femininity.

07:07.460 --> 07:09.280
They have different types of clothing.

07:09.840 --> 07:10.680
They have different practices.

07:10.680 --> 07:12.800
They have different rituals, different habits.

07:12.800 --> 07:13.940
All right, fair enough.

07:13.940 --> 07:15.000
But you know what?

07:15.000 --> 07:18.460
There's a reason that most male people

07:18.460 --> 07:21.480
latch onto their culture's masculine gender role.

07:21.480 --> 07:24.100
And most female people latch onto their culture's

07:24.100 --> 07:25.480
feminine gender role.

07:25.480 --> 07:27.880
Because there actually is something

07:27.880 --> 07:30.720
in these gender roles that relates to biology.

07:30.720 --> 07:34.720
You don't have that 99% overlap if that's not the case.

07:34.720 --> 07:36.240
And that's why when you defer

07:36.240 --> 07:38.200
to your basic biology 101 class

07:38.200 --> 07:39.640
that you failed in high school,

07:39.640 --> 07:42.000
you look like you don't know what you're talking about.

07:42.000 --> 07:43.820
Gender is only loosely related to sex

07:43.820 --> 07:45.120
in so far as we've identified

07:45.120 --> 07:46.400
certain physical characteristics

07:46.400 --> 07:47.840
and have arbitrarily decided

07:47.840 --> 07:49.960
that this person belongs to this gender.

07:49.960 --> 07:51.760
But there are a whole bunch of people from that gender

07:51.760 --> 07:54.080
that don't have those physical characteristics.

07:54.080 --> 07:56.200
It's almost like there's some variation to sex.

07:56.200 --> 07:57.960
And that's because it's not a binary,

07:57.960 --> 08:00.800
it's a bimodal distribution where you have two extreme ends

08:00.800 --> 08:03.760
and most people following somewhere in the middle.

08:03.760 --> 08:05.900
He's talking about intersex people.

08:05.900 --> 08:07.800
And as far as I understand,

08:08.280 --> 08:11.640
intersex people are very, very, very rare, okay?

08:11.640 --> 08:16.600
And since he's a biologist, he should know this.

08:16.600 --> 08:18.760
The sex page in Wikipedia.

08:18.760 --> 08:20.460
Sex is the trait that determines

08:20.460 --> 08:23.920
whether a sexually reproducing organism produces male

08:23.920 --> 08:28.440
or female gametes, otherwise known as small mobile gametes,

08:28.440 --> 08:30.520
spermatozoa, sperm, pollen,

08:30.520 --> 08:33.800
while females produce larger non-motile gametes,

08:33.800 --> 08:35.520
ova, often called egg cells.

08:35.520 --> 08:36.360
That's it.

08:36.400 --> 08:38.320
I know some people, even on the right wing,

08:38.320 --> 08:40.040
some people on Twitter were grumbling

08:40.040 --> 08:43.800
that I said that if you're neutered somehow,

08:43.800 --> 08:45.840
you're neither male nor female.

08:45.840 --> 08:48.520
That's true because sex is the trait

08:48.520 --> 08:51.320
that determines whether a sexually reproducing organism

08:51.320 --> 08:52.940
produces male or female gametes.

08:52.940 --> 08:53.780
That's what it is.

08:53.780 --> 08:56.280
The point is that we're talking here about biology.

08:56.280 --> 09:00.120
And when this retard talks about the two extreme ends

09:00.120 --> 09:01.800
and most people falling somewhere in the middle,

09:01.800 --> 09:04.440
he's talking about secondary sex characteristics.

09:04.440 --> 09:06.920
But that's not the primary sex characteristic.

09:06.920 --> 09:09.880
The primary sex characteristic is what gametes you produce.

09:09.880 --> 09:11.960
So it's possible, for example, to be intersex.

09:11.960 --> 09:14.040
And so you're somebody who looks female

09:14.040 --> 09:17.240
and has various female secondary sex characteristics.

09:17.240 --> 09:18.440
So you have the hips and the butt

09:18.440 --> 09:20.020
and the boobs and whatever,

09:20.020 --> 09:22.680
but you don't produce large gametes

09:22.680 --> 09:24.380
because you're some type of intersex.

09:24.380 --> 09:25.820
But that's not most people.

09:25.820 --> 09:26.900
As he says here,

09:26.900 --> 09:29.280
most people falling somewhere in the middle.

09:29.280 --> 09:32.160
No, most people aren't intersex.

09:32.160 --> 09:34.800
Most people do not fall somewhere in the middle.

09:34.800 --> 09:37.160
Most people either produce large gametes

09:37.160 --> 09:38.880
or they produce small gametes.

09:38.880 --> 09:42.260
And therefore they're either female or male and that's it.

09:42.260 --> 09:44.160
But this idea that intersex people

09:44.160 --> 09:47.200
completely invalidate the sex binary is ridiculous.

09:47.200 --> 09:50.500
And also that you can use intersex people

09:50.500 --> 09:52.940
to backdoor in trans issues

09:52.940 --> 09:54.920
when trans people aren't intersex people.

09:54.920 --> 09:57.200
A trans person who has not yet transitioned,

09:57.200 --> 09:59.280
they're still male or female and that's that.

09:59.280 --> 10:00.680
You could be intersex.

10:00.680 --> 10:02.140
You could go your whole life

10:02.980 --> 10:04.020
being intersex and never know it.

10:04.020 --> 10:07.080
And the reason to that is because when you're born,

10:07.080 --> 10:08.400
nobody tests you.

10:08.400 --> 10:10.620
The doctor just decides what you look like

10:10.620 --> 10:11.940
and assigns you with sex.

10:11.940 --> 10:14.620
And the society then assigns you a gender

10:14.620 --> 10:16.940
that is traditionally associated with that sex.

10:16.940 --> 10:18.980
I really hate when people appeal to nature

10:18.980 --> 10:21.000
when they're trying to erase trans or gay people,

10:21.000 --> 10:23.020
because when you actually study the animal kingdom,

10:23.020 --> 10:25.240
the concepts of male and female cease to function

10:25.240 --> 10:26.080
as we understand it.

10:26.080 --> 10:27.660
When you're talking about creatures

10:27.660 --> 10:30.260
that have vastly different sexual dimorphism than us.

10:30.260 --> 10:31.620
They still have sexual dimorphism.

10:31.620 --> 10:35.300
Flop sexes or produce both gametes or reproduce a sexually.

10:35.300 --> 10:36.940
Yep, those all exist.

10:36.940 --> 10:38.520
But you know what?

10:38.520 --> 10:41.960
I think the most complicated species

10:41.960 --> 10:45.780
that can reproduce in a way that is not very strict,

10:45.780 --> 10:49.160
large gametes, small gametes is like a crab.

10:49.160 --> 10:51.860
There's a crab that can do some of this stuff.

10:51.860 --> 10:54.040
Less complicated creatures than crabs.

10:54.040 --> 10:56.140
Yeah, you have like bugs that do it.

10:56.140 --> 10:57.920
You have plants that do it.

10:57.920 --> 11:00.720
You have various single celled organisms that do it.

11:00.720 --> 11:02.480
Once you start getting more complicated,

11:02.480 --> 11:05.480
it's pretty much universally male, female,

11:05.480 --> 11:07.160
large gamete, small gamete.

11:07.160 --> 11:08.120
And that's just how it is.

11:08.120 --> 11:09.160
Here's what's important

11:09.160 --> 11:10.600
about what this guy's trying to do here.

11:10.600 --> 11:13.880
He's taking the authority of his scientific background,

11:13.880 --> 11:15.520
which let's give him the benefit of the doubt

11:15.520 --> 11:16.400
and say that it's true.

11:16.400 --> 11:18.120
And he didn't just buy a lab coat

11:18.120 --> 11:19.960
for 15 bucks off of Amazon.

11:19.960 --> 11:22.640
And he's saying that because I've studied this stuff,

11:22.640 --> 11:24.080
therefore this is how it is.

11:24.080 --> 11:25.800
But the questions he's posing,

11:25.800 --> 11:28.400
they're actually not questions of science.

11:28.400 --> 11:29.940
They're questions of philosophy.

11:29.940 --> 11:32.980
So we can look at a group of traits and we can say,

11:32.980 --> 11:35.080
okay, well, we have traits one, two, three, four, five.

11:35.080 --> 11:35.920
All right.

11:35.920 --> 11:38.080
And we're gonna group traits, you know,

11:38.080 --> 11:40.400
one, two, three to be male traits

11:40.400 --> 11:43.880
and traits four, five, six to be female traits.

11:43.880 --> 11:47.880
The question, why should one, two and three be grouped?

11:47.880 --> 11:50.480
And why should four, five and six be grouped?

11:50.480 --> 11:52.240
That's a question of philosophy.

11:52.240 --> 11:55.120
Science allows us to observe the traits.

11:55.280 --> 11:58.680
Philosophy tells us how we should group what we observe.

11:58.680 --> 12:00.960
There's observation of the real world

12:00.960 --> 12:03.240
and then what we value out of that observation.

12:03.240 --> 12:04.600
Two different questions.

12:04.600 --> 12:07.360
He's saying that we should value

12:07.360 --> 12:08.920
or the observations of the real world,

12:08.920 --> 12:11.720
a specific way in line with his politics.

12:11.720 --> 12:14.160
And he's saying, look, it's because I'm a scientist,

12:14.160 --> 12:17.560
but he's not asking a scientific question.

12:17.560 --> 12:20.680
He's not saying that, oh, you actually don't know

12:20.680 --> 12:23.080
that this other scientific effect is happening

12:23.080 --> 12:24.320
in the real world.

12:25.040 --> 12:26.560
No, he's not saying anything like that.

12:26.560 --> 12:30.800
What he's saying is we should group them in this method,

12:30.800 --> 12:33.920
not in the method that has been traditionally used.

12:33.920 --> 12:36.680
But that's ultimately a question of philosophy, not science.

12:36.680 --> 12:37.800
Here's an example of what I mean.

12:37.800 --> 12:39.620
Why is it that a guy who's six foot tall,

12:39.620 --> 12:41.800
that guy is considered a tall man,

12:41.800 --> 12:45.080
but a guy who is, to use my own height, five foot seven,

12:45.080 --> 12:46.540
I'm considered short.

12:46.540 --> 12:47.720
Why is that the case?

12:47.720 --> 12:50.880
I mean, the five foot seven and the six foot O,

12:50.880 --> 12:52.560
those are objective measurements.

12:52.600 --> 12:54.440
We have in fact measured two people.

12:54.440 --> 12:55.920
They are in fact this size,

12:55.920 --> 12:57.920
but it's philosophy that determines

12:57.920 --> 13:01.080
that we should classify six foot O as tall

13:01.080 --> 13:03.120
and five foot seven as short.

13:03.120 --> 13:04.180
We could do it differently.

13:04.180 --> 13:07.200
We could in fact say that six foot two is where tall begins

13:07.200 --> 13:09.700
and that people who are six foot O, they're actually short.

13:09.700 --> 13:11.060
We could do it that way.

13:11.060 --> 13:13.760
The issue ultimately is what our preferences are.

13:13.760 --> 13:15.780
And that is at the heart of the philosophy.

13:15.780 --> 13:19.020
This guy clearly has progressive preferences

13:19.020 --> 13:22.820
and he's using his credentials to make those preferences,

13:22.820 --> 13:25.620
to make that philosophy look like science,

13:25.620 --> 13:26.500
but it actually isn't.

13:26.500 --> 13:28.420
All right, let's do one more if we get out of here.

13:28.420 --> 13:30.060
It's like every single day, you guys,

13:30.060 --> 13:31.540
and this is why I play my whole time.

13:31.540 --> 13:33.100
That voice, is this another trans one?

13:33.100 --> 13:34.940
What's his name?

13:34.940 --> 13:35.780
What's your name?

13:35.780 --> 13:36.700
I'm Tony.

13:36.700 --> 13:38.740
Yeah, your name's Alex and I'm gonna be calling your manager.

13:38.740 --> 13:40.540
This guy called me sir.

13:40.540 --> 13:42.540
I ain't gonna tell him his every shit yet.

13:42.540 --> 13:43.940
Everywhere I go, I get called sir.

13:43.940 --> 13:44.780
I'm so fucking hurt.

13:44.780 --> 13:46.300
Why would you call a chick?

13:46.300 --> 13:48.580
Take out your shit, you're a fucking.

13:49.020 --> 13:50.220
It's cause you don't pass, dude.

13:50.220 --> 13:51.060
That's why.

13:51.060 --> 13:52.100
Stop trying to gaslight trans people

13:52.100 --> 13:54.140
and tell us that we're crazy.

13:54.140 --> 13:57.060
Well, you are kind of crazy to be honest.

13:57.060 --> 13:58.620
Did you call me a sir again?

13:58.620 --> 13:59.460
What was that?

13:59.460 --> 14:00.860
You said goodnight, sir?

14:00.860 --> 14:02.060
This is transphobic.

14:02.060 --> 14:03.780
Now he's just fucking trolling.

14:03.780 --> 14:05.900
You're a fucking bigot, Edward.

14:05.900 --> 14:07.300
All right, Alex, you know what?

14:07.300 --> 14:08.820
I can't wait to this day.

14:08.820 --> 14:11.460
It's a slur, do you not understand?

14:11.460 --> 14:12.980
Wait, is sir a slur now?

14:12.980 --> 14:15.300
That's why she calls us a code n-word.

14:15.300 --> 14:16.780
It's like calling him the n-word.

14:16.820 --> 14:18.900
Oh my God, that's ridiculous.

14:18.900 --> 14:21.340
I have the right to be pissed about it.

14:21.340 --> 14:22.420
You fucking did.

14:22.420 --> 14:23.580
I said all along that you weren't.

14:23.580 --> 14:25.540
You fucking did you liar.

14:25.540 --> 14:27.460
Cis people need to be held accountable

14:27.460 --> 14:28.940
for having cute trans people.

14:28.940 --> 14:30.740
And I'm not gonna put up with this shit anymore.

14:30.740 --> 14:31.580
You're crazy, bro.

14:31.580 --> 14:32.420
You're a fuck.

14:32.420 --> 14:33.780
Don't call me a fuck, bro.

14:33.780 --> 14:34.620
Don't call me bro.

14:34.620 --> 14:38.300
Don't do slurs at me, you fucking piece of shit.

14:38.300 --> 14:39.340
No, fuck you.

14:39.340 --> 14:40.180
Oh my God.

14:40.180 --> 14:41.020
Are you a cis?

14:41.020 --> 14:41.860
Are you a fuck, bro?

14:41.860 --> 14:43.620
You don't even fucking know me.

14:43.620 --> 14:44.940
Oh my God, dude.

14:44.940 --> 14:46.140
Don't fucking call me sir.

14:46.980 --> 14:48.580
This is transphobia.

14:48.580 --> 14:50.700
I really don't want you to come out of the store.

14:50.700 --> 14:52.620
Yeah, you don't even know me.

14:52.620 --> 14:53.700
Get the, okay.

14:53.700 --> 14:55.340
Listen, listen here.

14:55.340 --> 14:57.740
I'll properly gender you, okay?

14:57.740 --> 14:59.780
You're being a fucking Karen.

14:59.780 --> 15:02.620
There is this idea that like using the wrong pronouns

15:02.620 --> 15:05.820
or using a dead name or saying like sir

15:05.820 --> 15:07.100
or instead of ma'am or whatever,

15:07.100 --> 15:10.580
that that is on par with the worst possible slurs.

15:10.580 --> 15:12.100
Trans activists are claiming that now.

15:12.100 --> 15:15.060
That it's like, it's on par with like saying the n-word,

15:15.060 --> 15:17.380
not as a joke, but with like real hatred in your heart,

15:17.380 --> 15:19.020
like saying it like that's what it is.

15:19.020 --> 15:21.100
And it's like, no, you guys are fucking ridiculous.

15:21.100 --> 15:22.380
It's that's so stupid.

15:22.380 --> 15:23.320
That's so dumb.

15:23.320 --> 15:25.060
Trans people are like, they're unironically

15:25.060 --> 15:25.900
the most sensitive,

15:25.900 --> 15:27.500
the most triggered fucking people right now.

15:27.500 --> 15:29.820
It's a wild, some of them, some of them obviously

15:29.820 --> 15:32.300
like not all, not all trans activists, let's say.

15:32.300 --> 15:34.340
The craziest fucking people right now, dude.

15:34.340 --> 15:36.540
All right, that's enough nonsense for me.

15:36.540 --> 15:38.100
Hopefully I can get this up in time for midnight.

15:38.100 --> 15:39.780
It's gonna be a race against the clock to edit it all.

15:39.780 --> 15:40.980
I've got maybe an hour to do it.

15:40.980 --> 15:42.140
Let's see if I can get it done guys.

15:42.140 --> 15:43.060
If I can't here, you know what?

15:43.060 --> 15:44.060
Here, post in the comments.

15:44.060 --> 15:46.260
Did I actually get it out before midnight EST?

15:46.260 --> 15:47.180
I don't know, let's see.

15:47.180 --> 15:50.880
All right guys, I will see you next time.

15:50.880 --> 15:52.140
Have a good one.

15:52.140 --> 15:52.980
I love you.
