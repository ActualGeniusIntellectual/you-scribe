00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,240
Hello everyone, welcome to a very late TikTok Tuesday.

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:08,040
I'm recording this at 10pm, which means I have to record it and edit it and put it out

3
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:10,760
in two hours or else it's no longer TikTok Tuesday.

4
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:11,760
You think I'll get to it?

5
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:12,760
Let's hope so.

6
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:14,360
I've had a very busy day today.

7
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:15,360
My day isn't even done.

8
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:16,480
Listen to everything I've done today, guys.

9
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:21,240
I have researched and written and recorded and then canned it off today for editing a

10
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:22,960
script for tomorrow's video.

11
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:26,880
And after I'm done putting this out, I'm going to go make that video for tomorrow.

12
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:30,880
And then Naomi and I went to go see Oppenheimer, and I've recorded a vlog for my side channel

13
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:33,200
about that movie, so check that out tomorrow as well.

14
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:36,720
And then we came home, we did a stream of Final Fantasy XVI, me, Dave and Naomi, it

15
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:37,720
was a fun time.

16
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:40,620
And now here at the end of the day, I'm recording TikTok Tuesday.

17
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:43,240
No I didn't forget, I've just had a very, very busy day.

18
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:46,480
Let's see all the stuff you guys have saved up for me this week.

19
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:51,880
Oh, it's one of those environmental protests blocking the roads, eh?

20
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:52,880
It looks German.

21
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:55,880
Yeah, it is German, this is in Germany.

22
00:00:57,880 --> 00:00:58,880
These guys are assholes.

23
00:00:58,880 --> 00:00:59,880
I hate this.

24
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:02,880
It's like, get out of the, get out of the fucking road.

25
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:09,880
Like, you guys aren't even helping anything, just get out of the road.

26
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:13,880
Oh, this guy wants to throw down?

27
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:17,880
Was that like a kung fu stance?

28
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:19,880
Like, whoa.

29
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:24,880
I gotta like save up these clips and do an environmentalist video because there's so

30
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:28,880
many of them, just people being assholes, blocking the road, getting absolutely, like

31
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,880
accomplishing nothing, even for their own goals.

32
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:33,880
You know, it's just, ah fuck, just watching them makes my head hurt.

33
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:42,880
Oh, and this gotta be one of those like, one of those drug videos where you just like see

34
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:49,880
someone walking through a downtown core and just everyone hanging, oh, the music.

35
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:51,880
Yeah, I gotta mute that music, guys, I'm sorry.

36
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:55,880
All my TikTok Tuesdays keep getting copyright struck and it's kind of annoying, so I'm just

37
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:56,880
gonna mute that.

38
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:01,880
But yeah, you see all these videos like going through downtown just full of rubbish, garbage,

39
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:06,880
people who are high hanging around, prostitutes, needles, homeless people.

40
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:10,880
Look at this guy, he just slouched over high as fuck, like what the fuck, dude?

41
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:12,880
This shit is like just depressing.

42
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:15,880
I understand, you know, the right wingers right now saying don't live in a city, you

43
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:16,880
see this, I understand.

44
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:20,880
Not every city is like this, not every neighborhood in the city is like this, but definitely don't

45
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,880
live in the downtown core.

46
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:24,880
It's fucking brutal right now.

47
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:26,880
The drug problem is absolutely terrible.

48
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:29,880
Some of it's out of their control, you know, people fall on hard times, I understand, but

49
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:34,880
some of it is just a lack of virtue on their part, the inability to do the right thing.

50
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:37,880
People want to be all like harm reductionist, but no, on some level it is a moral failing

51
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:39,880
on the parts of the individual.

52
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:41,880
This is my meal, I call this girl dinner.

53
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:43,880
Girl dinner.

54
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:44,880
What?

55
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:45,880
Girl dinner.

56
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:46,880
What is girl dinner?

57
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:47,880
What is girl dinner?

58
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:53,080
In 1923, TikToker Livi Marr seemed to have coined the phrase girl dinner in a video responding

59
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:58,880
to another TikToker who had said, the ideal meal is the imagined meal of a medieval peasant.

60
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:03,660
Livi Marr shows her plate of breads and cheeses and says, I call this girl dinner.

61
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:07,440
As the video went viral, the concept started to spread as other women showed off their

62
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:11,400
various arrays of small portions that combined equal a meal.

63
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:15,560
The concept was big enough to gain recognition on Twitter where users began to parody.

64
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:16,560
As a fat guy I'm insulted.

65
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:21,640
Now, there's even a boy dinner variant seeing men on TikTok showing what their dinner looks

66
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:22,640
like.

67
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:23,640
This is my meal.

68
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:24,640
I call this boy dinner.

69
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:25,640
Boy dinner.

70
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:33,840
Boy dinner, also has garnered parodies on Twitter and TikTok, often with fans comparing boy

71
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,000
dinner and girl dinner side by side.

72
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Is this the next thing?

73
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,280
Is this the new TikTok thing?

74
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:41,920
God, I know I make TikToks now, but I fucking hate TikTok.

75
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:44,440
The culture of the site's absolutely awful.

76
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:48,040
it just makes me like grown in disgust at the human race.

77
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:50,320
It's like, oh, girl dinners for me eat nothing.

78
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:51,160
All right.

79
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:54,420
Are we bringing back like the anorexic chic of the 1990s?

80
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:55,880
Of course you can go too far the other direction, right?

81
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:57,480
Like I'm living proof.

82
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:00,180
I am actually the fat guy you see on the screen right now.

83
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:02,780
Oh, we've seen this chick before.

84
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:05,160
This was the person who was like trans species

85
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:07,960
who believed that they were some kind of Hawk.

86
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,680
We saw it in a previous TikTok Tuesday.

87
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:14,280
Okay, let's get an update from the trans Hawk person.

88
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,120
Hi, my name is King

89
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,840
and I'm a non-human alternate at the ID system.

90
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:18,180
And I'm making a discord server

91
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:19,960
for people who experience wing dysphoria.

92
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:22,080
It's of course open systems with non-human headmates.

93
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:25,280
And it is also open to, I think they're called wing kin.

94
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,640
Literally anybody who experiences wing dysphoria.

95
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:29,080
Wing dysphoria.

96
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:30,480
They're folks who experienced wing dysphoria

97
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:33,020
and who get the Phantom wings.

98
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:35,540
I know we are all familiar with the feeling

99
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:38,920
of needing to stretch our wings and not being able to,

100
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:41,820
but is it as common of an experience

101
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:44,180
to feel like you have water on your wings?

102
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:45,840
And feel like your wings got wet.

103
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:46,680
You don't have wings.

104
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:47,520
Fluff them up and shake the water out.

105
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,100
You've never had wings.

106
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:50,980
And you can't, and it's frustrating.

107
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:52,120
Oh my God.

108
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:54,100
This is, I don't know if like TikTok

109
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:55,860
is breeding mental illness

110
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:58,140
or the mental illness always existed

111
00:04:58,140 --> 00:05:00,420
and TikTok is just creating a place for it.

112
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:02,100
All right, so let me see if you can get that, right?

113
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:04,740
These people, they're systems, okay?

114
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:07,220
Systems are like the modern Zoomer term

115
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:09,540
for a person with multiple personalities, okay?

116
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:11,860
However, they treat it with like a more spiritual bent.

117
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:14,540
It's not the science of psychology.

118
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:16,920
Now it's like you have multiple spirits inhabiting you.

119
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:21,060
And some of these systems include non-human alters.

120
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:22,940
Other personalities are called alters, okay?

121
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:25,280
So you have, do I gotta do a video

122
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:27,320
on all this nonsense terminology?

123
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:31,040
So you have people with alters that are non-human,

124
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:31,980
like other species.

125
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:34,940
So for example, this person has a bird alter.

126
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:36,700
So a bird alternate personality

127
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:38,860
in their system of multiple personalities

128
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:41,660
because they're a bird actually,

129
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:44,500
and their brain is apparently wired to be like a bird

130
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:45,780
or so they claim.

131
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:48,180
They experience wing dysphoria.

132
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:50,380
So you know how like trans people experience

133
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:51,740
gender dysphoria where they feel like

134
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:52,940
they should be the other gender?

135
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:54,660
Wing dysphoria, presumably,

136
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:56,620
is when you feel like you should have wings

137
00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:58,620
and parts of your neurons in your brain

138
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:00,920
are firing towards wings that don't exist

139
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,300
and it's causing dysphoria.

140
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:05,140
I'm pretty sure this is all just either made up cope

141
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:08,820
or like an extreme mental illness.

142
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:10,540
But I do not believe for a second

143
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:14,480
that anyone is actually inhabited by the spirit of an eagle.

144
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:17,500
You know, it almost sounds like weird occultist Nazi-ism

145
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:18,340
to say it like that.

146
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:19,180
You know, the spirit of the eagle.

147
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:20,540
That's something you could see the Nazis saying.

148
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:22,180
But here we are, guys.

149
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:23,860
You think Hitler had wing dysphoria?

150
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:25,460
Oh, there are only two genders.

151
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:27,140
It's just basic biology.

152
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:27,980
Based.

153
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:28,820
Hi, how you doing?

154
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:31,340
Welcome to advanced biology from a biologist.

155
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:33,060
You see that thing?

156
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:33,900
Oh, no.

157
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:35,100
So we're gonna go over some facts together.

158
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:36,540
But first off-

159
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:39,580
Is the fact that you've been ideologically captured,

160
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:41,340
is that what the fact is here?

161
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:43,340
Heavy trans day of visibility, right?

162
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:45,300
So sex and gender, not the same thing.

163
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:46,620
You've probably heard that before, right?

164
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:47,540
It's because it's true,

165
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:50,340
because biology actually has nothing to say about gender.

166
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:51,580
Oh my God.

167
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:56,220
That degree is worthless.

168
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:58,300
You might as well just start wiping your ass with it.

169
00:06:58,300 --> 00:06:59,300
Yes, of course, there's gonna be

170
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:01,560
some socially constructed components of gender.

171
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:02,400
You wanna know why?

172
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,360
Because every single culture doesn't have

173
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:07,460
the same presentation of masculinity or femininity.

174
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:09,280
They have different types of clothing.

175
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:10,680
They have different practices.

176
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,800
They have different rituals, different habits.

177
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:13,940
All right, fair enough.

178
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:15,000
But you know what?

179
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,460
There's a reason that most male people

180
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:21,480
latch onto their culture's masculine gender role.

181
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:24,100
And most female people latch onto their culture's

182
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:25,480
feminine gender role.

183
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:27,880
Because there actually is something

184
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:30,720
in these gender roles that relates to biology.

185
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:34,720
You don't have that 99% overlap if that's not the case.

186
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,240
And that's why when you defer

187
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,200
to your basic biology 101 class

188
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,640
that you failed in high school,

189
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:42,000
you look like you don't know what you're talking about.

190
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,820
Gender is only loosely related to sex

191
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:45,120
in so far as we've identified

192
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,400
certain physical characteristics

193
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,840
and have arbitrarily decided

194
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,960
that this person belongs to this gender.

195
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:51,760
But there are a whole bunch of people from that gender

196
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:54,080
that don't have those physical characteristics.

197
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:56,200
It's almost like there's some variation to sex.

198
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,960
And that's because it's not a binary,

199
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:00,800
it's a bimodal distribution where you have two extreme ends

200
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:03,760
and most people following somewhere in the middle.

201
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:05,900
He's talking about intersex people.

202
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:07,800
And as far as I understand,

203
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:11,640
intersex people are very, very, very rare, okay?

204
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:16,600
And since he's a biologist, he should know this.

205
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,760
The sex page in Wikipedia.

206
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:20,460
Sex is the trait that determines

207
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:23,920
whether a sexually reproducing organism produces male

208
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:28,440
or female gametes, otherwise known as small mobile gametes,

209
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:30,520
spermatozoa, sperm, pollen,

210
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:33,800
while females produce larger non-motile gametes,

211
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:35,520
ova, often called egg cells.

212
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:36,360
That's it.

213
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:38,320
I know some people, even on the right wing,

214
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:40,040
some people on Twitter were grumbling

215
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:43,800
that I said that if you're neutered somehow,

216
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:45,840
you're neither male nor female.

217
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:48,520
That's true because sex is the trait

218
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:51,320
that determines whether a sexually reproducing organism

219
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,940
produces male or female gametes.

220
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:53,780
That's what it is.

221
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:56,280
The point is that we're talking here about biology.

222
00:08:56,280 --> 00:09:00,120
And when this retard talks about the two extreme ends

223
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,800
and most people falling somewhere in the middle,

224
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:04,440
he's talking about secondary sex characteristics.

225
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:06,920
But that's not the primary sex characteristic.

226
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:09,880
The primary sex characteristic is what gametes you produce.

227
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:11,960
So it's possible, for example, to be intersex.

228
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:14,040
And so you're somebody who looks female

229
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:17,240
and has various female secondary sex characteristics.

230
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:18,440
So you have the hips and the butt

231
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:20,020
and the boobs and whatever,

232
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:22,680
but you don't produce large gametes

233
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:24,380
because you're some type of intersex.

234
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:25,820
But that's not most people.

235
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:26,900
As he says here,

236
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:29,280
most people falling somewhere in the middle.

237
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:32,160
No, most people aren't intersex.

238
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,800
Most people do not fall somewhere in the middle.

239
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:37,160
Most people either produce large gametes

240
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:38,880
or they produce small gametes.

241
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:42,260
And therefore they're either female or male and that's it.

242
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:44,160
But this idea that intersex people

243
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:47,200
completely invalidate the sex binary is ridiculous.

244
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:50,500
And also that you can use intersex people

245
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:52,940
to backdoor in trans issues

246
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:54,920
when trans people aren't intersex people.

247
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:57,200
A trans person who has not yet transitioned,

248
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,280
they're still male or female and that's that.

249
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:00,680
You could be intersex.

250
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:02,140
You could go your whole life

251
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:04,020
being intersex and never know it.

252
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:07,080
And the reason to that is because when you're born,

253
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:08,400
nobody tests you.

254
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:10,620
The doctor just decides what you look like

255
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:11,940
and assigns you with sex.

256
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:14,620
And the society then assigns you a gender

257
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:16,940
that is traditionally associated with that sex.

258
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:18,980
I really hate when people appeal to nature

259
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:21,000
when they're trying to erase trans or gay people,

260
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,020
because when you actually study the animal kingdom,

261
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:25,240
the concepts of male and female cease to function

262
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:26,080
as we understand it.

263
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,660
When you're talking about creatures

264
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:30,260
that have vastly different sexual dimorphism than us.

265
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:31,620
They still have sexual dimorphism.

266
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:35,300
Flop sexes or produce both gametes or reproduce a sexually.

267
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:36,940
Yep, those all exist.

268
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:38,520
But you know what?

269
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:41,960
I think the most complicated species

270
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:45,780
that can reproduce in a way that is not very strict,

271
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:49,160
large gametes, small gametes is like a crab.

272
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:51,860
There's a crab that can do some of this stuff.

273
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:54,040
Less complicated creatures than crabs.

274
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:56,140
Yeah, you have like bugs that do it.

275
00:10:56,140 --> 00:10:57,920
You have plants that do it.

276
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:00,720
You have various single celled organisms that do it.

277
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,480
Once you start getting more complicated,

278
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:05,480
it's pretty much universally male, female,

279
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:07,160
large gamete, small gamete.

280
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:08,120
And that's just how it is.

281
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:09,160
Here's what's important

282
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:10,600
about what this guy's trying to do here.

283
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:13,880
He's taking the authority of his scientific background,

284
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:15,520
which let's give him the benefit of the doubt

285
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:16,400
and say that it's true.

286
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:18,120
And he didn't just buy a lab coat

287
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:19,960
for 15 bucks off of Amazon.

288
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:22,640
And he's saying that because I've studied this stuff,

289
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,080
therefore this is how it is.

290
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,800
But the questions he's posing,

291
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:28,400
they're actually not questions of science.

292
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:29,940
They're questions of philosophy.

293
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:32,980
So we can look at a group of traits and we can say,

294
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:35,080
okay, well, we have traits one, two, three, four, five.

295
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:35,920
All right.

296
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:38,080
And we're gonna group traits, you know,

297
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:40,400
one, two, three to be male traits

298
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:43,880
and traits four, five, six to be female traits.

299
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:47,880
The question, why should one, two and three be grouped?

300
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:50,480
And why should four, five and six be grouped?

301
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:52,240
That's a question of philosophy.

302
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:55,120
Science allows us to observe the traits.

303
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:58,680
Philosophy tells us how we should group what we observe.

304
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:00,960
There's observation of the real world

305
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:03,240
and then what we value out of that observation.

306
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:04,600
Two different questions.

307
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:07,360
He's saying that we should value

308
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,920
or the observations of the real world,

309
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:11,720
a specific way in line with his politics.

310
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:14,160
And he's saying, look, it's because I'm a scientist,

311
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:17,560
but he's not asking a scientific question.

312
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:20,680
He's not saying that, oh, you actually don't know

313
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:23,080
that this other scientific effect is happening

314
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,320
in the real world.

315
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:26,560
No, he's not saying anything like that.

316
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:30,800
What he's saying is we should group them in this method,

317
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:33,920
not in the method that has been traditionally used.

318
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:36,680
But that's ultimately a question of philosophy, not science.

319
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:37,800
Here's an example of what I mean.

320
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:39,620
Why is it that a guy who's six foot tall,

321
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:41,800
that guy is considered a tall man,

322
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:45,080
but a guy who is, to use my own height, five foot seven,

323
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:46,540
I'm considered short.

324
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:47,720
Why is that the case?

325
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:50,880
I mean, the five foot seven and the six foot O,

326
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,560
those are objective measurements.

327
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,440
We have in fact measured two people.

328
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,920
They are in fact this size,

329
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,920
but it's philosophy that determines

330
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:01,080
that we should classify six foot O as tall

331
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:03,120
and five foot seven as short.

332
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,180
We could do it differently.

333
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:07,200
We could in fact say that six foot two is where tall begins

334
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,700
and that people who are six foot O, they're actually short.

335
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:11,060
We could do it that way.

336
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:13,760
The issue ultimately is what our preferences are.

337
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,780
And that is at the heart of the philosophy.

338
00:13:15,780 --> 00:13:19,020
This guy clearly has progressive preferences

339
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:22,820
and he's using his credentials to make those preferences,

340
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:25,620
to make that philosophy look like science,

341
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:26,500
but it actually isn't.

342
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:28,420
All right, let's do one more if we get out of here.

343
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:30,060
It's like every single day, you guys,

344
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:31,540
and this is why I play my whole time.

345
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:33,100
That voice, is this another trans one?

346
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:34,940
What's his name?

347
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:35,780
What's your name?

348
00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:36,700
I'm Tony.

349
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:38,740
Yeah, your name's Alex and I'm gonna be calling your manager.

350
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:40,540
This guy called me sir.

351
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:42,540
I ain't gonna tell him his every shit yet.

352
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:43,940
Everywhere I go, I get called sir.

353
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:44,780
I'm so fucking hurt.

354
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:46,300
Why would you call a chick?

355
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:48,580
Take out your shit, you're a fucking.

356
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:50,220
It's cause you don't pass, dude.

357
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:51,060
That's why.

358
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:52,100
Stop trying to gaslight trans people

359
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:54,140
and tell us that we're crazy.

360
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:57,060
Well, you are kind of crazy to be honest.

361
00:13:57,060 --> 00:13:58,620
Did you call me a sir again?

362
00:13:58,620 --> 00:13:59,460
What was that?

363
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:00,860
You said goodnight, sir?

364
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:02,060
This is transphobic.

365
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:03,780
Now he's just fucking trolling.

366
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:05,900
You're a fucking bigot, Edward.

367
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:07,300
All right, Alex, you know what?

368
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:08,820
I can't wait to this day.

369
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:11,460
It's a slur, do you not understand?

370
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:12,980
Wait, is sir a slur now?

371
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:15,300
That's why she calls us a code n-word.

372
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:16,780
It's like calling him the n-word.

373
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:18,900
Oh my God, that's ridiculous.

374
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:21,340
I have the right to be pissed about it.

375
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:22,420
You fucking did.

376
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:23,580
I said all along that you weren't.

377
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:25,540
You fucking did you liar.

378
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:27,460
Cis people need to be held accountable

379
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:28,940
for having cute trans people.

380
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:30,740
And I'm not gonna put up with this shit anymore.

381
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:31,580
You're crazy, bro.

382
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:32,420
You're a fuck.

383
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:33,780
Don't call me a fuck, bro.

384
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:34,620
Don't call me bro.

385
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:38,300
Don't do slurs at me, you fucking piece of shit.

386
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:39,340
No, fuck you.

387
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:40,180
Oh my God.

388
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:41,020
Are you a cis?

389
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:41,860
Are you a fuck, bro?

390
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:43,620
You don't even fucking know me.

391
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:44,940
Oh my God, dude.

392
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:46,140
Don't fucking call me sir.

393
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:48,580
This is transphobia.

394
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:50,700
I really don't want you to come out of the store.

395
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:52,620
Yeah, you don't even know me.

396
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:53,700
Get the, okay.

397
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:55,340
Listen, listen here.

398
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:57,740
I'll properly gender you, okay?

399
00:14:57,740 --> 00:14:59,780
You're being a fucking Karen.

400
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:02,620
There is this idea that like using the wrong pronouns

401
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:05,820
or using a dead name or saying like sir

402
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:07,100
or instead of ma'am or whatever,

403
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:10,580
that that is on par with the worst possible slurs.

404
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:12,100
Trans activists are claiming that now.

405
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:15,060
That it's like, it's on par with like saying the n-word,

406
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:17,380
not as a joke, but with like real hatred in your heart,

407
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:19,020
like saying it like that's what it is.

408
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:21,100
And it's like, no, you guys are fucking ridiculous.

409
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:22,380
It's that's so stupid.

410
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:23,320
That's so dumb.

411
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:25,060
Trans people are like, they're unironically

412
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:25,900
the most sensitive,

413
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:27,500
the most triggered fucking people right now.

414
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:29,820
It's a wild, some of them, some of them obviously

415
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:32,300
like not all, not all trans activists, let's say.

416
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:34,340
The craziest fucking people right now, dude.

417
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:36,540
All right, that's enough nonsense for me.

418
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:38,100
Hopefully I can get this up in time for midnight.

419
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:39,780
It's gonna be a race against the clock to edit it all.

420
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:40,980
I've got maybe an hour to do it.

421
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:42,140
Let's see if I can get it done guys.

422
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:43,060
If I can't here, you know what?

423
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:44,060
Here, post in the comments.

424
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:46,260
Did I actually get it out before midnight EST?

425
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:47,180
I don't know, let's see.

426
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:50,880
All right guys, I will see you next time.

427
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,140
Have a good one.

428
00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:52,980
I love you.
