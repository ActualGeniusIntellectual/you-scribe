00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,800
Hey guys, Dev here. I've come across this video from Jubilee called I'm an incel ask me anything.

2
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:09,400
Let me just let me just bring it in here. There it is.

3
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:14,600
So it's only eight minutes 43 seconds long, but there's some really interesting stuff in this video.

4
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:18,200
I came across it maybe a day or two ago and I've I've been mulling it over in my head.

5
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:24,000
I figured I might as well talk about it. This guy here in the yellow jacket.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,400
He is a self-professed incel now.

7
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:33,100
He seems to be not just a guy who can't get laid right?

8
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:36,700
Because there's the incels who are just the direct meaning of the term incel, right?

9
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:41,500
There's the involuntary celibates, you know, these are just people who aren't able to have sex.

10
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:46,500
They want to have sex, but they're not able to and for example, this this covers like most teenagers,

11
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:49,000
you know, I'm sure there's a lot of teenagers out there who want to get laid

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,700
and they can't and they're probably not going to get laid at all until they go off to college or whatever.

13
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:56,600
They're definitely incels, but they're not like the political incel.

14
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:03,800
And the political incel is somebody who kind of gets mired in the incel subculture of like the underbelly of the internet.

15
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:07,500
That's like the political incel is very different from the actual incel.

16
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:10,900
And this guy is much more a political incel himself.

17
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:17,300
However, like he's not a lost cause I would say, you know, like his fashion sense is a bit strange.

18
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:21,000
The long hair is not doing it for him, but maybe like he's not an ugly guy.

19
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,600
He's not deformed or anything, you know, if he, you know,

20
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:29,100
maybe changed up his dress and lost a few pounds, he'd probably be, you know, quite able to to get a girlfriend.

21
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:33,300
So very clearly the the political incel belief of oh,

22
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:36,100
just the chads get the girls, you know, that kind of thing.

23
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:39,200
It's it's not true. It's really not like I'm living proof.

24
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,300
It's not so is my roommate Dave.

25
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:44,600
So are a lot of people out there who have girlfriends and wives and other partners.

26
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:52,000
A huge part of the incel philosophy is not just all those those bitches won't won't sleep with me and it's all society's fault.

27
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,200
No, there's like an internal aspect to it that I think a lot of incels are not willing to really look at.

28
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:59,400
It's how they treat themselves. It's how they treat others. It's how they view people.

29
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:03,600
You know, it's the things that they do. It's not just society keeping them down, you know.

30
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:06,200
Let's actually watch this. Let's see what's going on here.

31
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:13,100
Let's go. If you could summarize your opinion towards women.

32
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:20,800
Like what I think of them. Yes, I do think they are very important, but you know,

33
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:26,200
that's I don't know why there was the echo on the butt and the because that's actually reasonable.

34
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:31,100
Like like women are important, but not more important than men more important than anybody else.

35
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:34,600
Their concerns are real concerns. They're humans, but they're not better than men.

36
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:37,900
You know, men's concerns are equally valid.

37
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:41,100
You know, there's a butt is reasonable

38
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:45,400
and already we're starting off with just a demonization of I guess,

39
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:49,200
you know, not being a feminist.

40
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:55,600
Wait short for involuntary celibate an incel is a member of an online subculture

41
00:02:55,600 --> 00:03:02,100
that centers around not being sexually active despite desiring to be it's not no no no an incel is a person

42
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:10,000
who is not sexually active despite desiring to be you don't have to be a member of an online subculture.

43
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:17,800
Some topics are hard to approach more and more male hatred against women is rising up.

44
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:22,000
You might call. I'm kind of expecting a an exploding van here.

45
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,600
You know, the internet hate machine all this a new phenomenon either the subjects are inaccessible

46
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:30,400
or people are uncomfortable discussing that you're an ugly guy.

47
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:34,300
You better get a good job and make some money because nobody's gonna want to talk to you girls.

48
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:39,000
It's actually true. That's actually true. If you're an ugly guy, you got to work to get ahead.

49
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:44,600
You know what same thing with ugly girls to like I've actually known some ugly girls who have like,

50
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:49,200
you know had little to no romantic success and I kind of feel bad for him like it.

51
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:52,400
This is this is not a gendered thing. It is definitely just an attractive.

52
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:56,800
It's like it's like attractiveness privilege actually exists really it does.

53
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:01,400
I will destroy you get laid at all.

54
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:04,800
So we found those subjects in person rented a space in Hollywood

55
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:12,300
and invited our audience and any strangers walking by to come inside and ask them anything.

56
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:16,900
Well, at least they're willing to listen to him right like most most places would just consider him a threat

57
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:20,100
like they would just view him as this this kind of like raging misogynist

58
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:22,900
and he has to be censored and don't give him a platform like this,

59
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:29,300
you know, I wonder if Jubilee has been like downvoted to hell just for let's just see.

60
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:33,400
Nope, I mean a little bit but not really that much.

61
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:39,500
Okay. Hey, I'm Brandy.

62
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:47,300
Oh, I also go by Derek. I I'm an incel and I'm here to answer people's questions about the topic.

63
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:53,300
All right. I can start hi.

64
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:55,400
How are you? Hi, I'm good.

65
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:59,800
So you're an incel. Yes. Why would you ever sign up to do this?

66
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:04,700
I I suppose I would want to give more of a positive lights on this community,

67
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:08,500
which is a very negative light upon it and see he says this community.

68
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:11,100
So he's definitely part of the political in cell thing.

69
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:14,900
But like I don't see this guy as going so deep into it that he's going to shoot up a school or anything.

70
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:20,400
You know, I think he's just sad and lonely, you know, but still, you know good on him for actually talking about it.

71
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,800
Okay. And do you think that's a good thing?

72
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:27,900
Yes, why is that because a lot of boys in this community aren't bad people

73
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:31,500
but you acknowledge that a good handful of them are right?

74
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:34,900
Not a good handful. I'd say a small handful. Yeah, it's about right.

75
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:39,500
Yeah, most of the incel community political in cells are just lonely,

76
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:45,900
you know, they feel like they've had no success at with with trying to get girlfriends or whatever and they're just they're sad about it.

77
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:48,200
You know, they're sad about the state of their lives.

78
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:53,000
Can't we can't blame him for that, you know, no one no one deserves a girl from but you know,

79
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:58,400
everyone wants to be loved. So how could you possibly blame them for you know,

80
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:03,100
they're for feeling bad about their lack of success romantically.

81
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:06,300
Who hurt you or what happened?

82
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:14,300
What event sort of catalyzed this way of thinking and you getting into this kind of research?

83
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:19,900
Society. We live in a society and look at her face.

84
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:22,600
All right, the feminists give this answer all the time,

85
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,800
you know, it's society's problem. It's the patriarchy,

86
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,500
you know, it's it's the white supremacy that's capitalism,

87
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:28,900
you know, all these overarching structures,

88
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:33,400
but as soon as one of those structures might be doing something bad to men.

89
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:39,100
Well now she's skeptical. Do you hate women?

90
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:43,000
No, no, no. Do you have a generally not,

91
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,700
you know, most in cells don't hate women because they want to at least have sex with them.

92
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:50,400
You know, it's like how most people who are like tranny chasers and are actually transphobes

93
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:53,000
because they want to fuck them. You can't really do both of those things.

94
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,900
Like people talk about hate fucking

95
00:06:54,900 --> 00:07:02,800
but the honest truth is that's not nearly as prevalent as you might be led to believe female role model in your life.

96
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:07,700
A female role model like a mom or an aunt or a friend.

97
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:11,600
I mean, I love my mom. I wouldn't necessarily consider her a role model,

98
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:17,400
but I do love her quite a bit. You see this guy's answer kind of reminds me of my roommate Peter,

99
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:19,900
who is a guy I've talked about on the channel several times.

100
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:24,700
He was a guy from Taiwan who went to New Zealand for high school in Canada for University

101
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:27,300
and all throughout his school career both in Taiwan and New Zealand.

102
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:30,800
He went to gender gender segregated schools before going to university.

103
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:35,000
He hadn't spoken more than like a dozen words to a female that wasn't part of his family.

104
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,100
Okay. So when you finally got to university and we were in Canada,

105
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:43,300
and of course the university is co-ed and the dorm was co-ed when there were like women in the room.

106
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:47,900
He couldn't handle it. You know when we were like hanging out with with female friends

107
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:51,000
and there was no sexual tension at all because we were all just friends for him.

108
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,700
It was like really weird. He couldn't even talk to them

109
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:58,400
and subsequently over time he got into like more and more extreme forms of pornography

110
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:06,100
because he had you couldn't even speak to women let alone even try to like try to get something going.

111
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:09,300
So he like kind of just went down the spiral of depravity.

112
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:14,000
Eventually he did talk to a girl because he met her when they were playing tennis

113
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,300
because they were both tennis players and now he's married to her and they have a kid.

114
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:23,000
So like and he even said like all of his his weird sexual dysfunction went away

115
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:28,600
as soon as he actually got that first date with them with this girl.

116
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:32,800
So I do think actually that this guy here in the video.

117
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:34,500
I think that he's probably telling the truth.

118
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:36,700
He probably didn't have any female role models growing up.

119
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:40,300
He probably didn't have any positive interaction with women outside of his family,

120
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:46,900
his family members which might make it hard to approach them which might you know,

121
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:50,900
which might contribute for to someone becoming an incel.

122
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:53,700
If a woman was elected as president of United States,

123
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:57,100
how would you react? I don't know.

124
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:58,900
It probably would depend on the on the woman.

125
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:01,400
I probably had that's completely reasonable,

126
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:05,800
isn't it? There's a very big difference between Hillary Clinton and and Tulsi Gabbard.

127
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:08,600
For example, it probably wouldn't be supportive of honestly,

128
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:11,900
but why do you say that if you don't mind me asking?

129
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:14,100
I do think that you know men should be the leaders

130
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:17,600
and women should be the caregivers and the you know,

131
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:23,700
the loving supporting and the teachers in some cases since that's a very traditionalist worldview.

132
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:26,100
It's not without merit because definitely a lot of men

133
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:30,400
and women trend towards those roles naturally without any kind of state enforcement.

134
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:31,700
But of course, there's always the exceptions

135
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:34,000
and the exception should be should be allowed to do whatever they like.

136
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,300
That's that's the point of a free society.

137
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:39,600
So I don't know if he understands the exceptions or if he doesn't care.

138
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,400
I might not necessarily be with him on that one.

139
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:46,100
Women of color or just women in general have been oppressed by certain systems

140
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:51,000
and other oppressed communities, especially the LGBTQ plus all those those aren't.

141
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:55,100
Look at his face. He just doesn't fucking care about the SJW bullshit.

142
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:58,700
Really fit with the spectrum that incels or you have been talking about.

143
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:03,700
So why do you think your method of thought would help fix what we have today?

144
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:09,600
Before he even has a chance to answer that. Her question was your experiences as an incel,

145
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:14,200
the things that have happened to you, the systemic oppression you face does not fit with feminist theory.

146
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,900
It does not fit with Marxist Theory.

147
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:20,600
It does not fit with any of this other postmodern SJW nonsense.

148
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:26,900
So therefore you're wrong. So why do you why aren't you converting to be a feminist?

149
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:30,600
You know, can't we have one fucking video?

150
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:36,000
Can't we have one thing where the problems that we discuss are men's problems and not women's problems?

151
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,700
Women's problems are very obviously important. They do not need to be the center of every single thing.

152
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:43,900
It's like with it's like with the with the the rainbow colored poppies,

153
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:47,200
you know, this year for the like in my Remembrance Day video,

154
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:51,300
the Don Cherry video, not everything needs to be about the LGBT community either,

155
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:57,600
you know, sometimes events can happen that are not part of your specific worldview

156
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:00,300
and you don't need to bend them to be part of your specific worldview.

157
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:04,100
Things can happen outside of your control and outside of your ideology.

158
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:11,000
Jesus fuck. I probably wouldn't view the things that you might view as oppression as oppression.

159
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:18,300
I have a feeling I would view it more as how we treat children that we love.

160
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:21,300
We control them but we control them lovingly not as a slave,

161
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:24,200
not as we're forcing them to do things against their will.

162
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:26,300
She's looking like this is some kind of wild assertion on his part,

163
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:29,100
but it's completely true, isn't it? Like we do control children.

164
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:31,300
That's the point is that they don't know what the fuck they're doing.

165
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:35,600
They're kids, you know, like what's your objection here lady?

166
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:39,900
Well, I would view it more as a loving domestic thing in the past

167
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:42,200
and I would say that if we were to do it in a civilized way,

168
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:44,400
maybe in a more even a Christian way,

169
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:50,300
even though I'm not really advocating for a certain religion or ideology.

170
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:53,700
I would assume that women would probably be happier and I wouldn't just assume that blindly.

171
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:56,300
I would assume that based on the data that I've seen.

172
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:59,200
That's true, isn't it? Like if you take,

173
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:03,200
you know coercion out of the equation and let people live whatever lives they want to live.

174
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,100
You don't think that women might want to take care of the house

175
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:09,300
and men might want to take care of the area outside of the house like just naturally.

176
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:11,800
Now if it doesn't if it doesn't happen to be like that,

177
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:12,700
I guess doesn't have to be like that.

178
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:15,500
But I think the whole point is that you're supposed to let people choose what they like to do,

179
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:21,500
right? I mean, she seems like all women would the assertion that women would actually choose to be caregivers.

180
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:26,100
Oh, how dare you? Well, I guess every single woman that I've chosen that they're all oppressive to you,

181
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:30,200
right lady? What data have you seen that has brought you to this conclusion?

182
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:34,900
Because I'm now curious where I can get this data from.

183
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:38,200
I couldn't reference it offhand, but I believe there was a study that yeah,

184
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:41,800
man, like that you're this is not the place to be pulling out like like studies here,

185
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:46,500
dude, that I can't remember the name of it off the top of my head.

186
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:53,200
Okay. What do you think it is about liberal areas that create behavior in women that you know,

187
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:59,600
what I hate that the fact that that that liberal or liberalism has has become known as leftism

188
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:05,200
when they're not the same thing pisses me off that you think is a problem.

189
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:13,900
Promiscuity leads to increased standards in more primitive aspects such as looks

190
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:17,600
and that typically makes it harder for some people to find a relationship

191
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,900
including sometimes good-looking people.

192
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:22,800
There's guys who are much better looking than I am

193
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:27,800
who are having a really hard time finding someone in a place like LA

194
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:30,500
or in London or in Auckland, New Zealand,

195
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:36,500
but they probably would have a perfectly fine time finding a woman somewhere else.

196
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:38,600
This is the thing. He's not wrong.

197
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:40,000
She was rolling her eyes, but he's not wrong.

198
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,300
Right? Like if if the game is one night stands,

199
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:47,700
what does it matter outside of looks? I mean think about it,

200
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:49,900
you know, you don't care how much money they make.

201
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:53,400
You don't care how maybe maybe that attracts you to them like for some superficial reason,

202
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:56,400
but you don't care about what they're doing with their lives.

203
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:58,800
You care about how good they looks that you can fuck them

204
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:02,900
and then leave the next day. Like that's what the that's what one night stand culture is.

205
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:05,400
Nothing else matters but looks.

206
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:11,300
And you know, and dare I say it a more traditional society where where marriage is the norm

207
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:14,600
rather than the exception considering the single mother considering the divorce rate

208
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:19,500
and the single mothers nowadays. In a society where marriage is the norm,

209
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:22,000
you don't think people might be happier? Like you might not.

210
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,800
Okay, maybe you have to sacrifice having sex with many people and you know,

211
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:32,900
that is a sacrifice but maybe you get to have a good a good deep relationship

212
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:36,400
with one person that you truly love. Isn't that better for everyone?

213
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:39,200
Not just men. I don't know.

214
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:42,800
I think so. So you think that promiscuity is the problem

215
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,600
and if people are more monogamous

216
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:51,300
and more withholding that would sort of fix society.

217
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:57,800
It would go a long way. Like she has this look of disbelief on her face

218
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:01,000
and it's like what do you think a single mother is?

219
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,600
Now? I'm not saying that there aren't reasons for this for single mothers to exist.

220
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,400
You know, like sometimes your partner dies.

221
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:07,300
Sometimes your partner is abusive and you have to leave.

222
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:10,100
Sometimes things are out of your control. Like I get it.

223
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:13,200
This is not me advocating for you staying with a guy who's bad for you.

224
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:16,700
All right, but this is me advocating for having some fucking forethought

225
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:20,500
and who you reproduce with and for like maybe thinking hmm.

226
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:23,500
Okay. Is this person actually marriage material before settling down

227
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:25,000
before having kids with them?

228
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,500
Rather than just rushing into things blindly

229
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:29,600
because you're basically used to social media culture

230
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:32,700
where instant gratification is the name of the game.

231
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:34,700
Yeah, I suppose people were more traditionalists.

232
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:36,800
There have been a few mass shootings in the past

233
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:40,600
where these shooters actually stated that they were incels

234
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:43,600
or were radicalized by online incels.

235
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,900
What do you think about their actions?

236
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:48,200
I condemn their actions. I don't believe in violence.

237
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:53,500
And that is more than your average Muslim does for a Muslim attack.

238
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:59,100
So we're at the point now where the incels are morally superior to the Islamists.

239
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:00,800
The solution.

240
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:03,400
I don't believe attacking random people is going to fix anything

241
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:05,700
whether they're, you know, women or men.

242
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:08,400
I do think that the reason why they committed those actions

243
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:13,200
was probably because of out of desperation or out of, you know, mental problems.

244
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:19,000
They probably could have been prevented had the right support

245
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,400
was in their community, in their household.

246
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:24,100
If people saw what they were posting

247
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:26,600
and saw what they were experiencing in life

248
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:28,000
and did something to help them.

249
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:28,800
Was there like...

250
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:29,800
Yeah, exactly, right?

251
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:32,400
I mean, wasn't that the point of the Joker movie?

252
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:35,200
You know, his meds were cut and the social support systems weren't there

253
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,700
and he couldn't see his therapist anymore

254
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:39,200
and everything kind of spiraled downward for him.

255
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:42,000
Yeah, man, like that's the absolute right answer.

256
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:44,200
A pivotal moment in your life,

257
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:47,600
like a straw that broke the metaphorical camel's back.

258
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:51,400
When did you know you were gay?

259
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:52,600
God.

260
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:54,600
You know, it's constant years of rejection

261
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:55,800
no matter who the person was,

262
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:58,400
constant years of rejection in other aspects of my life.

263
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:03,500
It did kind of push me towards more, I suppose, radical beliefs

264
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:07,200
but I suppose they're only like radical, but they're more just old beliefs.

265
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:08,200
Yeah, he doesn't think they're radical at all.

266
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:10,000
He just seems like a conservative, you know,

267
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,600
just a basic bitch conservative in a lot of ways.

268
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:16,200
And he even said, rejection in other areas of life.

269
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:17,800
So not even romantic, you know.

270
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:19,400
This guy probably had school problems.

271
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:21,800
You know, this guy probably dropped out of college or something.

272
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:24,000
This guy probably had problems getting a job.

273
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:29,600
You know, this mindset is not solely based around sexual activity.

274
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:34,000
It's based around these people being rejected by everybody.

275
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:39,400
And you'd have to be completely heartless to not at least have some sympathy for them.

276
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:40,400
Really?

277
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:45,400
No, it sounds like I had another metaphor, like death by a thousand cuts.

278
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:47,400
You know, it's not like one pivotal moment,

279
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,400
but it sounds like a bunch of things built up over time.

280
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:50,400
Yeah.

281
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:54,400
One of the common criticisms about the incel community

282
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:58,800
is that you feel entitled to sex or intimacy.

283
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:03,000
Do you believe that you deserve sex or intimacy?

284
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Sex or intimacy from a woman?

285
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:11,600
I think everybody at some level deserves someone that they,

286
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:14,600
someone that loves them and, you know, respects them

287
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:18,600
as long as you are also loving and respectful towards that person, you know.

288
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:20,200
I don't think deserve is the right word.

289
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:22,000
I think that everyone wants that.

290
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,200
Everyone should have the chance to try and get that.

291
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:26,200
But no one deserves a partner.

292
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:27,200
No.

293
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,600
They're an equal.

294
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:31,600
You know, you're not like seeking someone beyond yourself.

295
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:35,600
You know, you don't have like too high standards, I suppose, you know.

296
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:39,000
If you can tell the world about something, about being incel,

297
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,400
that, you know, that may not be the internet or that's overlooked heavily,

298
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:43,600
what would it be?

299
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:44,200
I don't know.

300
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:48,800
I think it's mostly that most of the men are not inherently bad people.

301
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:50,800
A lot of them are just lonely.

302
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:53,000
They just need some help, really.

303
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,400
Exactly.

304
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:57,800
Eggs fucking zachly, dude.

305
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:59,600
Like, I can't say anything else.

306
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,400
That was the best way to say that.

307
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:06,200
Would you say that there's anything that other people can do

308
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:10,800
to help guide or just support or...

309
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:13,200
You know, the lonely person in your class

310
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,600
or the lonely person in your workplace,

311
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:18,600
maybe he's an incel and he's not letting you know

312
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:20,200
and he's just kind of afraid.

313
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,400
He wants someone positive.

314
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:22,200
Just be nice.

315
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,000
Say hi.

316
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,400
Try and make friends with him.

317
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,200
You don't have to date him.

318
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,600
You don't have to whatever.

319
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:30,600
Just, you know, brighten up someone lonely's day, I suppose.

320
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:33,800
Okay, noted. Thank you.

321
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:34,800
Yeah, man.

322
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:39,200
So basically the stuff you were taught watching Sesame Street,

323
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:42,200
the stuff that you knew from watching any like children's movie

324
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:45,600
where like the bully is the villain of the movie or something or the show.

325
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:46,800
Yeah.

326
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:49,600
It's almost like these people have not realized

327
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:53,600
that they've become the bullies that they hated.

328
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:54,800
You don't want to be an incel?

329
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:56,200
No.

330
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:57,600
Why not?

331
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,800
Well, I mean, it's part of the whole involuntarily thing.

332
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:05,200
I mean, I what the fuck kind of a question was that?

333
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,400
You don't want to be an incel?

334
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:07,400
What?

335
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:10,100
Oh, you know, you want to try and escape it.

336
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:15,000
You want to be something better, you know, you want to get a wife,

337
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,800
get a girlfriend, get someone who loves you,

338
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:19,600
spend spending your life with them and be happy.

339
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:23,600
And what's one thing you wish people understood better about you?

340
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:23,900
Hold on.

341
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:25,800
I'm just gonna go back a minute.

342
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:28,300
Like as he's talking about like his aspirations.

343
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:29,600
Look at her face.

344
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:33,000
She's like there's like a moment here.

345
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,900
Where it almost seems like she's thinking I have this all pegged wrong.

346
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:40,000
Like a glimmer of self-reflection.

347
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,900
Be happy and see that.

348
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:46,100
What's one thing you wish people understood better about you?

349
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:46,700
I don't know.

350
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:51,500
I guess I people I wish people would recognize how much effort I'm trying.

351
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:53,600
I suppose like, you know, I'm working out typically daily.

352
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,100
I've lost over a hundred pounds.

353
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:55,800
Nice dude.

354
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:57,500
Congrats actively.

355
00:20:57,500 --> 00:21:02,900
I don't think people recognize how much effort the incels in general try to put into bettering themselves.

356
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:04,600
I would say, you know, people don't recognize their effort.

357
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:11,500
They just assume that they're all like lazy and sad and angry at women and just giving up and things of that nature.

358
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:17,300
I suppose you don't have to see the bad things in the world and then come out a bad person.

359
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:22,000
You can just see the bad things in the world and then improve upon yourself because of them.

360
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,100
I suppose so you do have hope.

361
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:25,500
Yeah, I have I have hope.

362
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:26,200
Yeah.

363
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:27,600
Yeah, that's awesome.

364
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,000
I suppose I won't lie.

365
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:33,500
This one a lot differently than I thought it would I thought I thought we'd be yelling at each other,

366
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:36,600
you know, I kind of had a feeling it was going to go like this,

367
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:38,500
you know, it was nice to meet you.

368
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:40,200
It was nice to meet you too.

369
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:43,000
Thank you so much.

370
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:43,600
Hello.

371
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,100
Thanks for watching the video.

372
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:45,300
Okay.

373
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:48,300
Well, whatever are you is this guy getting any dates from these women?

374
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:51,500
Do you think I mean probably not but nonetheless?

375
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:53,700
Yeah, this was this was a something wasn't it?

376
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:55,100
This was honestly a pretty good video

377
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:59,200
and I'm surprised that it actually went up on this channel considering how well it went.

378
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:05,200
You know, this definitely does not contribute to the whole demonization of incels thing like this this humanizes them

379
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:10,600
and considering that humanizing your political enemies is one of the Cardinal sins of social justice.

380
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:11,800
I'm surprised it went up at all,

381
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:19,100
you know, but I guess props on them for showing off this guy to be a good guy who's just been ridiculously unlucky.

382
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:26,000
You know, like in the end in cells are men with severe depression.

383
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:30,800
I would say and maybe the severe depression is partially caused by their environment,

384
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:39,700
but nonetheless severe depression one of the newer intersectionality is one of the newer intersectional identities is mental health,

385
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:45,300
you know, that's another another axis of oppression in the SJW landscape

386
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:51,300
and considering that you think that SJWs would be significantly more friendly towards the incels

387
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:54,900
because they have textbook depression about the state of their lives.

388
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:57,700
But no, I guess like mental health privilege

389
00:22:57,700 --> 00:23:04,600
and mental disorder oppression or whatever only counts if you're not a straight white man

390
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:08,800
because at the end of the day in cells are people that need help

391
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:14,200
and the progressives seem to be jumping through hoops to try and justify not giving it to them.
