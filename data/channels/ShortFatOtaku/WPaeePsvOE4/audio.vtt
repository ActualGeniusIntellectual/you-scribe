00:00.000 --> 00:06.800
Hey guys, Dev here. I've come across this video from Jubilee called I'm an incel ask me anything.

00:06.800 --> 00:09.400
Let me just let me just bring it in here. There it is.

00:09.400 --> 00:14.600
So it's only eight minutes 43 seconds long, but there's some really interesting stuff in this video.

00:14.600 --> 00:18.200
I came across it maybe a day or two ago and I've I've been mulling it over in my head.

00:18.200 --> 00:24.000
I figured I might as well talk about it. This guy here in the yellow jacket.

00:24.000 --> 00:28.400
He is a self-professed incel now.

00:28.400 --> 00:33.100
He seems to be not just a guy who can't get laid right?

00:33.100 --> 00:36.700
Because there's the incels who are just the direct meaning of the term incel, right?

00:36.700 --> 00:41.500
There's the involuntary celibates, you know, these are just people who aren't able to have sex.

00:41.500 --> 00:46.500
They want to have sex, but they're not able to and for example, this this covers like most teenagers,

00:46.500 --> 00:49.000
you know, I'm sure there's a lot of teenagers out there who want to get laid

00:49.000 --> 00:52.700
and they can't and they're probably not going to get laid at all until they go off to college or whatever.

00:52.700 --> 00:56.600
They're definitely incels, but they're not like the political incel.

00:56.600 --> 01:03.800
And the political incel is somebody who kind of gets mired in the incel subculture of like the underbelly of the internet.

01:03.800 --> 01:07.500
That's like the political incel is very different from the actual incel.

01:07.500 --> 01:10.900
And this guy is much more a political incel himself.

01:10.900 --> 01:17.300
However, like he's not a lost cause I would say, you know, like his fashion sense is a bit strange.

01:17.300 --> 01:21.000
The long hair is not doing it for him, but maybe like he's not an ugly guy.

01:21.000 --> 01:23.600
He's not deformed or anything, you know, if he, you know,

01:23.600 --> 01:29.100
maybe changed up his dress and lost a few pounds, he'd probably be, you know, quite able to to get a girlfriend.

01:29.100 --> 01:33.300
So very clearly the the political incel belief of oh,

01:33.300 --> 01:36.100
just the chads get the girls, you know, that kind of thing.

01:36.100 --> 01:39.200
It's it's not true. It's really not like I'm living proof.

01:39.200 --> 01:41.300
It's not so is my roommate Dave.

01:41.300 --> 01:44.600
So are a lot of people out there who have girlfriends and wives and other partners.

01:44.600 --> 01:52.000
A huge part of the incel philosophy is not just all those those bitches won't won't sleep with me and it's all society's fault.

01:52.000 --> 01:56.200
No, there's like an internal aspect to it that I think a lot of incels are not willing to really look at.

01:56.200 --> 01:59.400
It's how they treat themselves. It's how they treat others. It's how they view people.

01:59.400 --> 02:03.600
You know, it's the things that they do. It's not just society keeping them down, you know.

02:03.600 --> 02:06.200
Let's actually watch this. Let's see what's going on here.

02:06.200 --> 02:13.100
Let's go. If you could summarize your opinion towards women.

02:13.100 --> 02:20.800
Like what I think of them. Yes, I do think they are very important, but you know,

02:20.800 --> 02:26.200
that's I don't know why there was the echo on the butt and the because that's actually reasonable.

02:26.200 --> 02:31.100
Like like women are important, but not more important than men more important than anybody else.

02:31.100 --> 02:34.600
Their concerns are real concerns. They're humans, but they're not better than men.

02:34.600 --> 02:37.900
You know, men's concerns are equally valid.

02:37.900 --> 02:41.100
You know, there's a butt is reasonable

02:41.100 --> 02:45.400
and already we're starting off with just a demonization of I guess,

02:45.400 --> 02:49.200
you know, not being a feminist.

02:51.200 --> 02:55.600
Wait short for involuntary celibate an incel is a member of an online subculture

02:55.600 --> 03:02.100
that centers around not being sexually active despite desiring to be it's not no no no an incel is a person

03:02.100 --> 03:10.000
who is not sexually active despite desiring to be you don't have to be a member of an online subculture.

03:12.100 --> 03:17.800
Some topics are hard to approach more and more male hatred against women is rising up.

03:17.800 --> 03:22.000
You might call. I'm kind of expecting a an exploding van here.

03:22.000 --> 03:27.600
You know, the internet hate machine all this a new phenomenon either the subjects are inaccessible

03:27.600 --> 03:30.400
or people are uncomfortable discussing that you're an ugly guy.

03:30.400 --> 03:34.300
You better get a good job and make some money because nobody's gonna want to talk to you girls.

03:34.300 --> 03:39.000
It's actually true. That's actually true. If you're an ugly guy, you got to work to get ahead.

03:39.000 --> 03:44.600
You know what same thing with ugly girls to like I've actually known some ugly girls who have like,

03:44.600 --> 03:49.200
you know had little to no romantic success and I kind of feel bad for him like it.

03:49.200 --> 03:52.400
This is this is not a gendered thing. It is definitely just an attractive.

03:52.400 --> 03:56.800
It's like it's like attractiveness privilege actually exists really it does.

03:56.800 --> 04:01.400
I will destroy you get laid at all.

04:01.400 --> 04:04.800
So we found those subjects in person rented a space in Hollywood

04:04.800 --> 04:12.300
and invited our audience and any strangers walking by to come inside and ask them anything.

04:12.300 --> 04:16.900
Well, at least they're willing to listen to him right like most most places would just consider him a threat

04:16.900 --> 04:20.100
like they would just view him as this this kind of like raging misogynist

04:20.100 --> 04:22.900
and he has to be censored and don't give him a platform like this,

04:22.900 --> 04:29.300
you know, I wonder if Jubilee has been like downvoted to hell just for let's just see.

04:29.300 --> 04:33.400
Nope, I mean a little bit but not really that much.

04:37.200 --> 04:39.500
Okay. Hey, I'm Brandy.

04:39.500 --> 04:47.300
Oh, I also go by Derek. I I'm an incel and I'm here to answer people's questions about the topic.

04:47.300 --> 04:53.300
All right. I can start hi.

04:53.300 --> 04:55.400
How are you? Hi, I'm good.

04:55.400 --> 04:59.800
So you're an incel. Yes. Why would you ever sign up to do this?

04:59.800 --> 05:04.700
I I suppose I would want to give more of a positive lights on this community,

05:04.700 --> 05:08.500
which is a very negative light upon it and see he says this community.

05:08.500 --> 05:11.100
So he's definitely part of the political in cell thing.

05:11.100 --> 05:14.900
But like I don't see this guy as going so deep into it that he's going to shoot up a school or anything.

05:14.900 --> 05:20.400
You know, I think he's just sad and lonely, you know, but still, you know good on him for actually talking about it.

05:20.400 --> 05:22.800
Okay. And do you think that's a good thing?

05:22.800 --> 05:27.900
Yes, why is that because a lot of boys in this community aren't bad people

05:27.900 --> 05:31.500
but you acknowledge that a good handful of them are right?

05:31.500 --> 05:34.900
Not a good handful. I'd say a small handful. Yeah, it's about right.

05:34.900 --> 05:39.500
Yeah, most of the incel community political in cells are just lonely,

05:39.500 --> 05:45.900
you know, they feel like they've had no success at with with trying to get girlfriends or whatever and they're just they're sad about it.

05:45.900 --> 05:48.200
You know, they're sad about the state of their lives.

05:48.200 --> 05:53.000
Can't we can't blame him for that, you know, no one no one deserves a girl from but you know,

05:53.000 --> 05:58.400
everyone wants to be loved. So how could you possibly blame them for you know,

05:58.400 --> 06:03.100
they're for feeling bad about their lack of success romantically.

06:03.100 --> 06:06.300
Who hurt you or what happened?

06:06.300 --> 06:14.300
What event sort of catalyzed this way of thinking and you getting into this kind of research?

06:14.300 --> 06:19.900
Society. We live in a society and look at her face.

06:19.900 --> 06:22.600
All right, the feminists give this answer all the time,

06:22.600 --> 06:24.800
you know, it's society's problem. It's the patriarchy,

06:24.800 --> 06:27.500
you know, it's it's the white supremacy that's capitalism,

06:27.500 --> 06:28.900
you know, all these overarching structures,

06:28.900 --> 06:33.400
but as soon as one of those structures might be doing something bad to men.

06:33.400 --> 06:39.100
Well now she's skeptical. Do you hate women?

06:39.100 --> 06:43.000
No, no, no. Do you have a generally not,

06:43.000 --> 06:46.700
you know, most in cells don't hate women because they want to at least have sex with them.

06:46.700 --> 06:50.400
You know, it's like how most people who are like tranny chasers and are actually transphobes

06:50.400 --> 06:53.000
because they want to fuck them. You can't really do both of those things.

06:53.000 --> 06:54.900
Like people talk about hate fucking

06:54.900 --> 07:02.800
but the honest truth is that's not nearly as prevalent as you might be led to believe female role model in your life.

07:02.800 --> 07:07.700
A female role model like a mom or an aunt or a friend.

07:07.700 --> 07:11.600
I mean, I love my mom. I wouldn't necessarily consider her a role model,

07:11.600 --> 07:17.400
but I do love her quite a bit. You see this guy's answer kind of reminds me of my roommate Peter,

07:17.400 --> 07:19.900
who is a guy I've talked about on the channel several times.

07:19.900 --> 07:24.700
He was a guy from Taiwan who went to New Zealand for high school in Canada for University

07:24.700 --> 07:27.300
and all throughout his school career both in Taiwan and New Zealand.

07:27.300 --> 07:30.800
He went to gender gender segregated schools before going to university.

07:30.800 --> 07:35.000
He hadn't spoken more than like a dozen words to a female that wasn't part of his family.

07:35.000 --> 07:38.100
Okay. So when you finally got to university and we were in Canada,

07:38.100 --> 07:43.300
and of course the university is co-ed and the dorm was co-ed when there were like women in the room.

07:43.300 --> 07:47.900
He couldn't handle it. You know when we were like hanging out with with female friends

07:47.900 --> 07:51.000
and there was no sexual tension at all because we were all just friends for him.

07:51.000 --> 07:53.700
It was like really weird. He couldn't even talk to them

07:53.700 --> 07:58.400
and subsequently over time he got into like more and more extreme forms of pornography

07:58.400 --> 08:06.100
because he had you couldn't even speak to women let alone even try to like try to get something going.

08:06.100 --> 08:09.300
So he like kind of just went down the spiral of depravity.

08:09.300 --> 08:14.000
Eventually he did talk to a girl because he met her when they were playing tennis

08:14.000 --> 08:17.300
because they were both tennis players and now he's married to her and they have a kid.

08:17.300 --> 08:23.000
So like and he even said like all of his his weird sexual dysfunction went away

08:23.000 --> 08:28.600
as soon as he actually got that first date with them with this girl.

08:28.600 --> 08:32.800
So I do think actually that this guy here in the video.

08:32.900 --> 08:34.500
I think that he's probably telling the truth.

08:34.500 --> 08:36.700
He probably didn't have any female role models growing up.

08:36.700 --> 08:40.300
He probably didn't have any positive interaction with women outside of his family,

08:40.300 --> 08:46.900
his family members which might make it hard to approach them which might you know,

08:46.900 --> 08:50.900
which might contribute for to someone becoming an incel.

08:50.900 --> 08:53.700
If a woman was elected as president of United States,

08:53.700 --> 08:57.100
how would you react? I don't know.

08:57.100 --> 08:58.900
It probably would depend on the on the woman.

08:58.900 --> 09:01.400
I probably had that's completely reasonable,

09:01.400 --> 09:05.800
isn't it? There's a very big difference between Hillary Clinton and and Tulsi Gabbard.

09:05.800 --> 09:08.600
For example, it probably wouldn't be supportive of honestly,

09:08.600 --> 09:11.900
but why do you say that if you don't mind me asking?

09:11.900 --> 09:14.100
I do think that you know men should be the leaders

09:14.100 --> 09:17.600
and women should be the caregivers and the you know,

09:17.600 --> 09:23.700
the loving supporting and the teachers in some cases since that's a very traditionalist worldview.

09:23.700 --> 09:26.100
It's not without merit because definitely a lot of men

09:26.100 --> 09:30.400
and women trend towards those roles naturally without any kind of state enforcement.

09:30.400 --> 09:31.700
But of course, there's always the exceptions

09:31.700 --> 09:34.000
and the exception should be should be allowed to do whatever they like.

09:34.000 --> 09:36.300
That's that's the point of a free society.

09:36.300 --> 09:39.600
So I don't know if he understands the exceptions or if he doesn't care.

09:39.600 --> 09:42.400
I might not necessarily be with him on that one.

09:42.400 --> 09:46.100
Women of color or just women in general have been oppressed by certain systems

09:46.100 --> 09:51.000
and other oppressed communities, especially the LGBTQ plus all those those aren't.

09:51.000 --> 09:55.100
Look at his face. He just doesn't fucking care about the SJW bullshit.

09:55.100 --> 09:58.700
Really fit with the spectrum that incels or you have been talking about.

09:58.700 --> 10:03.700
So why do you think your method of thought would help fix what we have today?

10:03.700 --> 10:09.600
Before he even has a chance to answer that. Her question was your experiences as an incel,

10:09.600 --> 10:14.200
the things that have happened to you, the systemic oppression you face does not fit with feminist theory.

10:14.200 --> 10:15.900
It does not fit with Marxist Theory.

10:15.900 --> 10:20.600
It does not fit with any of this other postmodern SJW nonsense.

10:20.600 --> 10:26.900
So therefore you're wrong. So why do you why aren't you converting to be a feminist?

10:26.900 --> 10:30.600
You know, can't we have one fucking video?

10:30.600 --> 10:36.000
Can't we have one thing where the problems that we discuss are men's problems and not women's problems?

10:36.000 --> 10:40.700
Women's problems are very obviously important. They do not need to be the center of every single thing.

10:40.700 --> 10:43.900
It's like with it's like with the with the the rainbow colored poppies,

10:43.900 --> 10:47.200
you know, this year for the like in my Remembrance Day video,

10:47.200 --> 10:51.300
the Don Cherry video, not everything needs to be about the LGBT community either,

10:51.300 --> 10:57.600
you know, sometimes events can happen that are not part of your specific worldview

10:57.600 --> 11:00.300
and you don't need to bend them to be part of your specific worldview.

11:00.300 --> 11:04.100
Things can happen outside of your control and outside of your ideology.

11:04.100 --> 11:11.000
Jesus fuck. I probably wouldn't view the things that you might view as oppression as oppression.

11:11.000 --> 11:18.300
I have a feeling I would view it more as how we treat children that we love.

11:18.300 --> 11:21.300
We control them but we control them lovingly not as a slave,

11:21.300 --> 11:24.200
not as we're forcing them to do things against their will.

11:24.200 --> 11:26.300
She's looking like this is some kind of wild assertion on his part,

11:26.300 --> 11:29.100
but it's completely true, isn't it? Like we do control children.

11:29.100 --> 11:31.300
That's the point is that they don't know what the fuck they're doing.

11:31.300 --> 11:35.600
They're kids, you know, like what's your objection here lady?

11:35.600 --> 11:39.900
Well, I would view it more as a loving domestic thing in the past

11:39.900 --> 11:42.200
and I would say that if we were to do it in a civilized way,

11:42.200 --> 11:44.400
maybe in a more even a Christian way,

11:44.400 --> 11:50.300
even though I'm not really advocating for a certain religion or ideology.

11:50.300 --> 11:53.700
I would assume that women would probably be happier and I wouldn't just assume that blindly.

11:53.700 --> 11:56.300
I would assume that based on the data that I've seen.

11:56.300 --> 11:59.200
That's true, isn't it? Like if you take,

11:59.200 --> 12:03.200
you know coercion out of the equation and let people live whatever lives they want to live.

12:03.200 --> 12:05.100
You don't think that women might want to take care of the house

12:05.100 --> 12:09.300
and men might want to take care of the area outside of the house like just naturally.

12:09.300 --> 12:11.800
Now if it doesn't if it doesn't happen to be like that,

12:11.800 --> 12:12.700
I guess doesn't have to be like that.

12:12.700 --> 12:15.500
But I think the whole point is that you're supposed to let people choose what they like to do,

12:15.500 --> 12:21.500
right? I mean, she seems like all women would the assertion that women would actually choose to be caregivers.

12:21.500 --> 12:26.100
Oh, how dare you? Well, I guess every single woman that I've chosen that they're all oppressive to you,

12:26.100 --> 12:30.200
right lady? What data have you seen that has brought you to this conclusion?

12:30.200 --> 12:34.900
Because I'm now curious where I can get this data from.

12:34.900 --> 12:38.200
I couldn't reference it offhand, but I believe there was a study that yeah,

12:38.200 --> 12:41.800
man, like that you're this is not the place to be pulling out like like studies here,

12:41.800 --> 12:46.500
dude, that I can't remember the name of it off the top of my head.

12:46.500 --> 12:53.200
Okay. What do you think it is about liberal areas that create behavior in women that you know,

12:53.200 --> 12:59.600
what I hate that the fact that that that liberal or liberalism has has become known as leftism

12:59.600 --> 13:05.200
when they're not the same thing pisses me off that you think is a problem.

13:05.200 --> 13:13.900
Promiscuity leads to increased standards in more primitive aspects such as looks

13:13.900 --> 13:17.600
and that typically makes it harder for some people to find a relationship

13:17.600 --> 13:19.900
including sometimes good-looking people.

13:19.900 --> 13:22.800
There's guys who are much better looking than I am

13:22.800 --> 13:27.800
who are having a really hard time finding someone in a place like LA

13:27.800 --> 13:30.500
or in London or in Auckland, New Zealand,

13:30.500 --> 13:36.500
but they probably would have a perfectly fine time finding a woman somewhere else.

13:36.500 --> 13:38.600
This is the thing. He's not wrong.

13:38.600 --> 13:40.000
She was rolling her eyes, but he's not wrong.

13:40.000 --> 13:44.300
Right? Like if if the game is one night stands,

13:44.300 --> 13:47.700
what does it matter outside of looks? I mean think about it,

13:47.700 --> 13:49.900
you know, you don't care how much money they make.

13:49.900 --> 13:53.400
You don't care how maybe maybe that attracts you to them like for some superficial reason,

13:53.400 --> 13:56.400
but you don't care about what they're doing with their lives.

13:56.400 --> 13:58.800
You care about how good they looks that you can fuck them

13:58.800 --> 14:02.900
and then leave the next day. Like that's what the that's what one night stand culture is.

14:02.900 --> 14:05.400
Nothing else matters but looks.

14:05.400 --> 14:11.300
And you know, and dare I say it a more traditional society where where marriage is the norm

14:11.300 --> 14:14.600
rather than the exception considering the single mother considering the divorce rate

14:14.600 --> 14:19.500
and the single mothers nowadays. In a society where marriage is the norm,

14:19.500 --> 14:22.000
you don't think people might be happier? Like you might not.

14:22.000 --> 14:25.800
Okay, maybe you have to sacrifice having sex with many people and you know,

14:25.800 --> 14:32.900
that is a sacrifice but maybe you get to have a good a good deep relationship

14:32.900 --> 14:36.400
with one person that you truly love. Isn't that better for everyone?

14:36.400 --> 14:39.200
Not just men. I don't know.

14:39.200 --> 14:42.800
I think so. So you think that promiscuity is the problem

14:42.800 --> 14:44.600
and if people are more monogamous

14:44.600 --> 14:51.300
and more withholding that would sort of fix society.

14:51.300 --> 14:57.800
It would go a long way. Like she has this look of disbelief on her face

14:57.800 --> 15:01.000
and it's like what do you think a single mother is?

15:01.000 --> 15:03.600
Now? I'm not saying that there aren't reasons for this for single mothers to exist.

15:03.600 --> 15:05.400
You know, like sometimes your partner dies.

15:05.400 --> 15:07.300
Sometimes your partner is abusive and you have to leave.

15:07.300 --> 15:10.100
Sometimes things are out of your control. Like I get it.

15:10.100 --> 15:13.200
This is not me advocating for you staying with a guy who's bad for you.

15:13.200 --> 15:16.700
All right, but this is me advocating for having some fucking forethought

15:16.700 --> 15:20.500
and who you reproduce with and for like maybe thinking hmm.

15:20.600 --> 15:23.500
Okay. Is this person actually marriage material before settling down

15:23.500 --> 15:25.000
before having kids with them?

15:25.000 --> 15:26.500
Rather than just rushing into things blindly

15:26.500 --> 15:29.600
because you're basically used to social media culture

15:29.600 --> 15:32.700
where instant gratification is the name of the game.

15:32.700 --> 15:34.700
Yeah, I suppose people were more traditionalists.

15:34.700 --> 15:36.800
There have been a few mass shootings in the past

15:36.800 --> 15:40.600
where these shooters actually stated that they were incels

15:40.600 --> 15:43.600
or were radicalized by online incels.

15:43.600 --> 15:45.900
What do you think about their actions?

15:45.900 --> 15:48.200
I condemn their actions. I don't believe in violence.

15:49.200 --> 15:53.500
And that is more than your average Muslim does for a Muslim attack.

15:53.500 --> 15:59.100
So we're at the point now where the incels are morally superior to the Islamists.

15:59.100 --> 16:00.800
The solution.

16:00.800 --> 16:03.400
I don't believe attacking random people is going to fix anything

16:03.400 --> 16:05.700
whether they're, you know, women or men.

16:05.700 --> 16:08.400
I do think that the reason why they committed those actions

16:08.400 --> 16:13.200
was probably because of out of desperation or out of, you know, mental problems.

16:13.200 --> 16:19.000
They probably could have been prevented had the right support

16:19.000 --> 16:21.400
was in their community, in their household.

16:21.400 --> 16:24.100
If people saw what they were posting

16:24.100 --> 16:26.600
and saw what they were experiencing in life

16:26.600 --> 16:28.000
and did something to help them.

16:28.000 --> 16:28.800
Was there like...

16:28.800 --> 16:29.800
Yeah, exactly, right?

16:29.800 --> 16:32.400
I mean, wasn't that the point of the Joker movie?

16:32.400 --> 16:35.200
You know, his meds were cut and the social support systems weren't there

16:35.200 --> 16:36.700
and he couldn't see his therapist anymore

16:36.700 --> 16:39.200
and everything kind of spiraled downward for him.

16:39.200 --> 16:42.000
Yeah, man, like that's the absolute right answer.

16:42.400 --> 16:44.200
A pivotal moment in your life,

16:44.200 --> 16:47.600
like a straw that broke the metaphorical camel's back.

16:47.600 --> 16:51.400
When did you know you were gay?

16:51.400 --> 16:52.600
God.

16:52.600 --> 16:54.600
You know, it's constant years of rejection

16:54.600 --> 16:55.800
no matter who the person was,

16:55.800 --> 16:58.400
constant years of rejection in other aspects of my life.

16:58.400 --> 17:03.500
It did kind of push me towards more, I suppose, radical beliefs

17:03.500 --> 17:07.200
but I suppose they're only like radical, but they're more just old beliefs.

17:07.200 --> 17:08.200
Yeah, he doesn't think they're radical at all.

17:08.200 --> 17:10.000
He just seems like a conservative, you know,

17:10.000 --> 17:12.600
just a basic bitch conservative in a lot of ways.

17:12.600 --> 17:16.200
And he even said, rejection in other areas of life.

17:16.200 --> 17:17.800
So not even romantic, you know.

17:17.800 --> 17:19.400
This guy probably had school problems.

17:19.400 --> 17:21.800
You know, this guy probably dropped out of college or something.

17:21.800 --> 17:24.000
This guy probably had problems getting a job.

17:24.000 --> 17:29.600
You know, this mindset is not solely based around sexual activity.

17:29.600 --> 17:34.000
It's based around these people being rejected by everybody.

17:35.000 --> 17:39.400
And you'd have to be completely heartless to not at least have some sympathy for them.

17:39.400 --> 17:40.400
Really?

17:40.400 --> 17:45.400
No, it sounds like I had another metaphor, like death by a thousand cuts.

17:45.400 --> 17:47.400
You know, it's not like one pivotal moment,

17:47.400 --> 17:49.400
but it sounds like a bunch of things built up over time.

17:49.400 --> 17:50.400
Yeah.

17:50.400 --> 17:54.400
One of the common criticisms about the incel community

17:54.400 --> 17:58.800
is that you feel entitled to sex or intimacy.

17:58.800 --> 18:03.000
Do you believe that you deserve sex or intimacy?

18:03.000 --> 18:06.000
Sex or intimacy from a woman?

18:06.000 --> 18:11.600
I think everybody at some level deserves someone that they,

18:11.600 --> 18:14.600
someone that loves them and, you know, respects them

18:14.600 --> 18:18.600
as long as you are also loving and respectful towards that person, you know.

18:18.600 --> 18:20.200
I don't think deserve is the right word.

18:20.200 --> 18:22.000
I think that everyone wants that.

18:22.000 --> 18:24.200
Everyone should have the chance to try and get that.

18:24.200 --> 18:26.200
But no one deserves a partner.

18:26.200 --> 18:27.200
No.

18:27.200 --> 18:28.600
They're an equal.

18:28.600 --> 18:31.600
You know, you're not like seeking someone beyond yourself.

18:31.600 --> 18:35.600
You know, you don't have like too high standards, I suppose, you know.

18:35.600 --> 18:39.000
If you can tell the world about something, about being incel,

18:39.000 --> 18:42.400
that, you know, that may not be the internet or that's overlooked heavily,

18:42.400 --> 18:43.600
what would it be?

18:43.600 --> 18:44.200
I don't know.

18:44.200 --> 18:48.800
I think it's mostly that most of the men are not inherently bad people.

18:48.800 --> 18:50.800
A lot of them are just lonely.

18:50.800 --> 18:53.000
They just need some help, really.

18:53.000 --> 18:54.400
Exactly.

18:54.400 --> 18:57.800
Eggs fucking zachly, dude.

18:57.800 --> 18:59.600
Like, I can't say anything else.

18:59.600 --> 19:01.400
That was the best way to say that.

19:02.400 --> 19:06.200
Would you say that there's anything that other people can do

19:06.200 --> 19:10.800
to help guide or just support or...

19:10.800 --> 19:13.200
You know, the lonely person in your class

19:13.200 --> 19:15.600
or the lonely person in your workplace,

19:15.600 --> 19:18.600
maybe he's an incel and he's not letting you know

19:18.600 --> 19:20.200
and he's just kind of afraid.

19:20.200 --> 19:21.400
He wants someone positive.

19:21.400 --> 19:22.200
Just be nice.

19:22.200 --> 19:23.000
Say hi.

19:23.000 --> 19:24.400
Try and make friends with him.

19:24.400 --> 19:25.200
You don't have to date him.

19:25.200 --> 19:26.600
You don't have to whatever.

19:26.600 --> 19:30.600
Just, you know, brighten up someone lonely's day, I suppose.

19:31.400 --> 19:33.800
Okay, noted. Thank you.

19:33.800 --> 19:34.800
Yeah, man.

19:34.800 --> 19:39.200
So basically the stuff you were taught watching Sesame Street,

19:39.200 --> 19:42.200
the stuff that you knew from watching any like children's movie

19:42.200 --> 19:45.600
where like the bully is the villain of the movie or something or the show.

19:45.600 --> 19:46.800
Yeah.

19:46.800 --> 19:49.600
It's almost like these people have not realized

19:49.600 --> 19:53.600
that they've become the bullies that they hated.

19:53.600 --> 19:54.800
You don't want to be an incel?

19:54.800 --> 19:56.200
No.

19:56.200 --> 19:57.600
Why not?

19:57.600 --> 19:59.800
Well, I mean, it's part of the whole involuntarily thing.

19:59.800 --> 20:05.200
I mean, I what the fuck kind of a question was that?

20:05.200 --> 20:06.400
You don't want to be an incel?

20:06.400 --> 20:07.400
What?

20:07.400 --> 20:10.100
Oh, you know, you want to try and escape it.

20:10.100 --> 20:15.000
You want to be something better, you know, you want to get a wife,

20:15.000 --> 20:16.800
get a girlfriend, get someone who loves you,

20:16.800 --> 20:19.600
spend spending your life with them and be happy.

20:19.600 --> 20:23.600
And what's one thing you wish people understood better about you?

20:23.600 --> 20:23.900
Hold on.

20:23.900 --> 20:25.800
I'm just gonna go back a minute.

20:25.800 --> 20:28.300
Like as he's talking about like his aspirations.

20:28.300 --> 20:29.600
Look at her face.

20:29.600 --> 20:33.000
She's like there's like a moment here.

20:33.000 --> 20:36.900
Where it almost seems like she's thinking I have this all pegged wrong.

20:36.900 --> 20:40.000
Like a glimmer of self-reflection.

20:40.000 --> 20:41.900
Be happy and see that.

20:41.900 --> 20:46.100
What's one thing you wish people understood better about you?

20:46.100 --> 20:46.700
I don't know.

20:46.700 --> 20:51.500
I guess I people I wish people would recognize how much effort I'm trying.

20:51.500 --> 20:53.600
I suppose like, you know, I'm working out typically daily.

20:53.600 --> 20:55.100
I've lost over a hundred pounds.

20:55.100 --> 20:55.800
Nice dude.

20:55.800 --> 20:57.500
Congrats actively.

20:57.500 --> 21:02.900
I don't think people recognize how much effort the incels in general try to put into bettering themselves.

21:02.900 --> 21:04.600
I would say, you know, people don't recognize their effort.

21:04.600 --> 21:11.500
They just assume that they're all like lazy and sad and angry at women and just giving up and things of that nature.

21:11.500 --> 21:17.300
I suppose you don't have to see the bad things in the world and then come out a bad person.

21:17.300 --> 21:22.000
You can just see the bad things in the world and then improve upon yourself because of them.

21:22.000 --> 21:24.100
I suppose so you do have hope.

21:24.100 --> 21:25.500
Yeah, I have I have hope.

21:25.500 --> 21:26.200
Yeah.

21:26.200 --> 21:27.600
Yeah, that's awesome.

21:27.600 --> 21:29.000
I suppose I won't lie.

21:29.000 --> 21:33.500
This one a lot differently than I thought it would I thought I thought we'd be yelling at each other,

21:33.500 --> 21:36.600
you know, I kind of had a feeling it was going to go like this,

21:36.600 --> 21:38.500
you know, it was nice to meet you.

21:38.500 --> 21:40.200
It was nice to meet you too.

21:40.200 --> 21:43.000
Thank you so much.

21:43.000 --> 21:43.600
Hello.

21:43.600 --> 21:45.100
Thanks for watching the video.

21:45.100 --> 21:45.300
Okay.

21:45.300 --> 21:48.300
Well, whatever are you is this guy getting any dates from these women?

21:48.300 --> 21:51.500
Do you think I mean probably not but nonetheless?

21:51.500 --> 21:53.700
Yeah, this was this was a something wasn't it?

21:53.700 --> 21:55.100
This was honestly a pretty good video

21:55.100 --> 21:59.200
and I'm surprised that it actually went up on this channel considering how well it went.

21:59.200 --> 22:05.200
You know, this definitely does not contribute to the whole demonization of incels thing like this this humanizes them

22:05.200 --> 22:10.600
and considering that humanizing your political enemies is one of the Cardinal sins of social justice.

22:10.600 --> 22:11.800
I'm surprised it went up at all,

22:11.800 --> 22:19.100
you know, but I guess props on them for showing off this guy to be a good guy who's just been ridiculously unlucky.

22:19.100 --> 22:26.000
You know, like in the end in cells are men with severe depression.

22:26.000 --> 22:30.800
I would say and maybe the severe depression is partially caused by their environment,

22:30.800 --> 22:39.700
but nonetheless severe depression one of the newer intersectionality is one of the newer intersectional identities is mental health,

22:39.700 --> 22:45.300
you know, that's another another axis of oppression in the SJW landscape

22:45.300 --> 22:51.300
and considering that you think that SJWs would be significantly more friendly towards the incels

22:51.300 --> 22:54.900
because they have textbook depression about the state of their lives.

22:54.900 --> 22:57.700
But no, I guess like mental health privilege

22:57.700 --> 23:04.600
and mental disorder oppression or whatever only counts if you're not a straight white man

23:04.600 --> 23:08.800
because at the end of the day in cells are people that need help

23:08.800 --> 23:14.200
and the progressives seem to be jumping through hoops to try and justify not giving it to them.
