0	6800	Hey guys, Dev here. I've come across this video from Jubilee called I'm an incel ask me anything.
6800	9400	Let me just let me just bring it in here. There it is.
9400	14600	So it's only eight minutes 43 seconds long, but there's some really interesting stuff in this video.
14600	18200	I came across it maybe a day or two ago and I've I've been mulling it over in my head.
18200	24000	I figured I might as well talk about it. This guy here in the yellow jacket.
24000	28400	He is a self-professed incel now.
28400	33100	He seems to be not just a guy who can't get laid right?
33100	36700	Because there's the incels who are just the direct meaning of the term incel, right?
36700	41500	There's the involuntary celibates, you know, these are just people who aren't able to have sex.
41500	46500	They want to have sex, but they're not able to and for example, this this covers like most teenagers,
46500	49000	you know, I'm sure there's a lot of teenagers out there who want to get laid
49000	52700	and they can't and they're probably not going to get laid at all until they go off to college or whatever.
52700	56600	They're definitely incels, but they're not like the political incel.
56600	63800	And the political incel is somebody who kind of gets mired in the incel subculture of like the underbelly of the internet.
63800	67500	That's like the political incel is very different from the actual incel.
67500	70900	And this guy is much more a political incel himself.
70900	77300	However, like he's not a lost cause I would say, you know, like his fashion sense is a bit strange.
77300	81000	The long hair is not doing it for him, but maybe like he's not an ugly guy.
81000	83600	He's not deformed or anything, you know, if he, you know,
83600	89100	maybe changed up his dress and lost a few pounds, he'd probably be, you know, quite able to to get a girlfriend.
89100	93300	So very clearly the the political incel belief of oh,
93300	96100	just the chads get the girls, you know, that kind of thing.
96100	99200	It's it's not true. It's really not like I'm living proof.
99200	101300	It's not so is my roommate Dave.
101300	104600	So are a lot of people out there who have girlfriends and wives and other partners.
104600	112000	A huge part of the incel philosophy is not just all those those bitches won't won't sleep with me and it's all society's fault.
112000	116200	No, there's like an internal aspect to it that I think a lot of incels are not willing to really look at.
116200	119400	It's how they treat themselves. It's how they treat others. It's how they view people.
119400	123600	You know, it's the things that they do. It's not just society keeping them down, you know.
123600	126200	Let's actually watch this. Let's see what's going on here.
126200	133100	Let's go. If you could summarize your opinion towards women.
133100	140800	Like what I think of them. Yes, I do think they are very important, but you know,
140800	146200	that's I don't know why there was the echo on the butt and the because that's actually reasonable.
146200	151100	Like like women are important, but not more important than men more important than anybody else.
151100	154600	Their concerns are real concerns. They're humans, but they're not better than men.
154600	157900	You know, men's concerns are equally valid.
157900	161100	You know, there's a butt is reasonable
161100	165400	and already we're starting off with just a demonization of I guess,
165400	169200	you know, not being a feminist.
171200	175600	Wait short for involuntary celibate an incel is a member of an online subculture
175600	182100	that centers around not being sexually active despite desiring to be it's not no no no an incel is a person
182100	190000	who is not sexually active despite desiring to be you don't have to be a member of an online subculture.
192100	197800	Some topics are hard to approach more and more male hatred against women is rising up.
197800	202000	You might call. I'm kind of expecting a an exploding van here.
202000	207600	You know, the internet hate machine all this a new phenomenon either the subjects are inaccessible
207600	210400	or people are uncomfortable discussing that you're an ugly guy.
210400	214300	You better get a good job and make some money because nobody's gonna want to talk to you girls.
214300	219000	It's actually true. That's actually true. If you're an ugly guy, you got to work to get ahead.
219000	224600	You know what same thing with ugly girls to like I've actually known some ugly girls who have like,
224600	229200	you know had little to no romantic success and I kind of feel bad for him like it.
229200	232400	This is this is not a gendered thing. It is definitely just an attractive.
232400	236800	It's like it's like attractiveness privilege actually exists really it does.
236800	241400	I will destroy you get laid at all.
241400	244800	So we found those subjects in person rented a space in Hollywood
244800	252300	and invited our audience and any strangers walking by to come inside and ask them anything.
252300	256900	Well, at least they're willing to listen to him right like most most places would just consider him a threat
256900	260100	like they would just view him as this this kind of like raging misogynist
260100	262900	and he has to be censored and don't give him a platform like this,
262900	269300	you know, I wonder if Jubilee has been like downvoted to hell just for let's just see.
269300	273400	Nope, I mean a little bit but not really that much.
277200	279500	Okay. Hey, I'm Brandy.
279500	287300	Oh, I also go by Derek. I I'm an incel and I'm here to answer people's questions about the topic.
287300	293300	All right. I can start hi.
293300	295400	How are you? Hi, I'm good.
295400	299800	So you're an incel. Yes. Why would you ever sign up to do this?
299800	304700	I I suppose I would want to give more of a positive lights on this community,
304700	308500	which is a very negative light upon it and see he says this community.
308500	311100	So he's definitely part of the political in cell thing.
311100	314900	But like I don't see this guy as going so deep into it that he's going to shoot up a school or anything.
314900	320400	You know, I think he's just sad and lonely, you know, but still, you know good on him for actually talking about it.
320400	322800	Okay. And do you think that's a good thing?
322800	327900	Yes, why is that because a lot of boys in this community aren't bad people
327900	331500	but you acknowledge that a good handful of them are right?
331500	334900	Not a good handful. I'd say a small handful. Yeah, it's about right.
334900	339500	Yeah, most of the incel community political in cells are just lonely,
339500	345900	you know, they feel like they've had no success at with with trying to get girlfriends or whatever and they're just they're sad about it.
345900	348200	You know, they're sad about the state of their lives.
348200	353000	Can't we can't blame him for that, you know, no one no one deserves a girl from but you know,
353000	358400	everyone wants to be loved. So how could you possibly blame them for you know,
358400	363100	they're for feeling bad about their lack of success romantically.
363100	366300	Who hurt you or what happened?
366300	374300	What event sort of catalyzed this way of thinking and you getting into this kind of research?
374300	379900	Society. We live in a society and look at her face.
379900	382600	All right, the feminists give this answer all the time,
382600	384800	you know, it's society's problem. It's the patriarchy,
384800	387500	you know, it's it's the white supremacy that's capitalism,
387500	388900	you know, all these overarching structures,
388900	393400	but as soon as one of those structures might be doing something bad to men.
393400	399100	Well now she's skeptical. Do you hate women?
399100	403000	No, no, no. Do you have a generally not,
403000	406700	you know, most in cells don't hate women because they want to at least have sex with them.
406700	410400	You know, it's like how most people who are like tranny chasers and are actually transphobes
410400	413000	because they want to fuck them. You can't really do both of those things.
413000	414900	Like people talk about hate fucking
414900	422800	but the honest truth is that's not nearly as prevalent as you might be led to believe female role model in your life.
422800	427700	A female role model like a mom or an aunt or a friend.
427700	431600	I mean, I love my mom. I wouldn't necessarily consider her a role model,
431600	437400	but I do love her quite a bit. You see this guy's answer kind of reminds me of my roommate Peter,
437400	439900	who is a guy I've talked about on the channel several times.
439900	444700	He was a guy from Taiwan who went to New Zealand for high school in Canada for University
444700	447300	and all throughout his school career both in Taiwan and New Zealand.
447300	450800	He went to gender gender segregated schools before going to university.
450800	455000	He hadn't spoken more than like a dozen words to a female that wasn't part of his family.
455000	458100	Okay. So when you finally got to university and we were in Canada,
458100	463300	and of course the university is co-ed and the dorm was co-ed when there were like women in the room.
463300	467900	He couldn't handle it. You know when we were like hanging out with with female friends
467900	471000	and there was no sexual tension at all because we were all just friends for him.
471000	473700	It was like really weird. He couldn't even talk to them
473700	478400	and subsequently over time he got into like more and more extreme forms of pornography
478400	486100	because he had you couldn't even speak to women let alone even try to like try to get something going.
486100	489300	So he like kind of just went down the spiral of depravity.
489300	494000	Eventually he did talk to a girl because he met her when they were playing tennis
494000	497300	because they were both tennis players and now he's married to her and they have a kid.
497300	503000	So like and he even said like all of his his weird sexual dysfunction went away
503000	508600	as soon as he actually got that first date with them with this girl.
508600	512800	So I do think actually that this guy here in the video.
512900	514500	I think that he's probably telling the truth.
514500	516700	He probably didn't have any female role models growing up.
516700	520300	He probably didn't have any positive interaction with women outside of his family,
520300	526900	his family members which might make it hard to approach them which might you know,
526900	530900	which might contribute for to someone becoming an incel.
530900	533700	If a woman was elected as president of United States,
533700	537100	how would you react? I don't know.
537100	538900	It probably would depend on the on the woman.
538900	541400	I probably had that's completely reasonable,
541400	545800	isn't it? There's a very big difference between Hillary Clinton and and Tulsi Gabbard.
545800	548600	For example, it probably wouldn't be supportive of honestly,
548600	551900	but why do you say that if you don't mind me asking?
551900	554100	I do think that you know men should be the leaders
554100	557600	and women should be the caregivers and the you know,
557600	563700	the loving supporting and the teachers in some cases since that's a very traditionalist worldview.
563700	566100	It's not without merit because definitely a lot of men
566100	570400	and women trend towards those roles naturally without any kind of state enforcement.
570400	571700	But of course, there's always the exceptions
571700	574000	and the exception should be should be allowed to do whatever they like.
574000	576300	That's that's the point of a free society.
576300	579600	So I don't know if he understands the exceptions or if he doesn't care.
579600	582400	I might not necessarily be with him on that one.
582400	586100	Women of color or just women in general have been oppressed by certain systems
586100	591000	and other oppressed communities, especially the LGBTQ plus all those those aren't.
591000	595100	Look at his face. He just doesn't fucking care about the SJW bullshit.
595100	598700	Really fit with the spectrum that incels or you have been talking about.
598700	603700	So why do you think your method of thought would help fix what we have today?
603700	609600	Before he even has a chance to answer that. Her question was your experiences as an incel,
609600	614200	the things that have happened to you, the systemic oppression you face does not fit with feminist theory.
614200	615900	It does not fit with Marxist Theory.
615900	620600	It does not fit with any of this other postmodern SJW nonsense.
620600	626900	So therefore you're wrong. So why do you why aren't you converting to be a feminist?
626900	630600	You know, can't we have one fucking video?
630600	636000	Can't we have one thing where the problems that we discuss are men's problems and not women's problems?
636000	640700	Women's problems are very obviously important. They do not need to be the center of every single thing.
640700	643900	It's like with it's like with the with the the rainbow colored poppies,
643900	647200	you know, this year for the like in my Remembrance Day video,
647200	651300	the Don Cherry video, not everything needs to be about the LGBT community either,
651300	657600	you know, sometimes events can happen that are not part of your specific worldview
657600	660300	and you don't need to bend them to be part of your specific worldview.
660300	664100	Things can happen outside of your control and outside of your ideology.
664100	671000	Jesus fuck. I probably wouldn't view the things that you might view as oppression as oppression.
671000	678300	I have a feeling I would view it more as how we treat children that we love.
678300	681300	We control them but we control them lovingly not as a slave,
681300	684200	not as we're forcing them to do things against their will.
684200	686300	She's looking like this is some kind of wild assertion on his part,
686300	689100	but it's completely true, isn't it? Like we do control children.
689100	691300	That's the point is that they don't know what the fuck they're doing.
691300	695600	They're kids, you know, like what's your objection here lady?
695600	699900	Well, I would view it more as a loving domestic thing in the past
699900	702200	and I would say that if we were to do it in a civilized way,
702200	704400	maybe in a more even a Christian way,
704400	710300	even though I'm not really advocating for a certain religion or ideology.
710300	713700	I would assume that women would probably be happier and I wouldn't just assume that blindly.
713700	716300	I would assume that based on the data that I've seen.
716300	719200	That's true, isn't it? Like if you take,
719200	723200	you know coercion out of the equation and let people live whatever lives they want to live.
723200	725100	You don't think that women might want to take care of the house
725100	729300	and men might want to take care of the area outside of the house like just naturally.
729300	731800	Now if it doesn't if it doesn't happen to be like that,
731800	732700	I guess doesn't have to be like that.
732700	735500	But I think the whole point is that you're supposed to let people choose what they like to do,
735500	741500	right? I mean, she seems like all women would the assertion that women would actually choose to be caregivers.
741500	746100	Oh, how dare you? Well, I guess every single woman that I've chosen that they're all oppressive to you,
746100	750200	right lady? What data have you seen that has brought you to this conclusion?
750200	754900	Because I'm now curious where I can get this data from.
754900	758200	I couldn't reference it offhand, but I believe there was a study that yeah,
758200	761800	man, like that you're this is not the place to be pulling out like like studies here,
761800	766500	dude, that I can't remember the name of it off the top of my head.
766500	773200	Okay. What do you think it is about liberal areas that create behavior in women that you know,
773200	779600	what I hate that the fact that that that liberal or liberalism has has become known as leftism
779600	785200	when they're not the same thing pisses me off that you think is a problem.
785200	793900	Promiscuity leads to increased standards in more primitive aspects such as looks
793900	797600	and that typically makes it harder for some people to find a relationship
797600	799900	including sometimes good-looking people.
799900	802800	There's guys who are much better looking than I am
802800	807800	who are having a really hard time finding someone in a place like LA
807800	810500	or in London or in Auckland, New Zealand,
810500	816500	but they probably would have a perfectly fine time finding a woman somewhere else.
816500	818600	This is the thing. He's not wrong.
818600	820000	She was rolling her eyes, but he's not wrong.
820000	824300	Right? Like if if the game is one night stands,
824300	827700	what does it matter outside of looks? I mean think about it,
827700	829900	you know, you don't care how much money they make.
829900	833400	You don't care how maybe maybe that attracts you to them like for some superficial reason,
833400	836400	but you don't care about what they're doing with their lives.
836400	838800	You care about how good they looks that you can fuck them
838800	842900	and then leave the next day. Like that's what the that's what one night stand culture is.
842900	845400	Nothing else matters but looks.
845400	851300	And you know, and dare I say it a more traditional society where where marriage is the norm
851300	854600	rather than the exception considering the single mother considering the divorce rate
854600	859500	and the single mothers nowadays. In a society where marriage is the norm,
859500	862000	you don't think people might be happier? Like you might not.
862000	865800	Okay, maybe you have to sacrifice having sex with many people and you know,
865800	872900	that is a sacrifice but maybe you get to have a good a good deep relationship
872900	876400	with one person that you truly love. Isn't that better for everyone?
876400	879200	Not just men. I don't know.
879200	882800	I think so. So you think that promiscuity is the problem
882800	884600	and if people are more monogamous
884600	891300	and more withholding that would sort of fix society.
891300	897800	It would go a long way. Like she has this look of disbelief on her face
897800	901000	and it's like what do you think a single mother is?
901000	903600	Now? I'm not saying that there aren't reasons for this for single mothers to exist.
903600	905400	You know, like sometimes your partner dies.
905400	907300	Sometimes your partner is abusive and you have to leave.
907300	910100	Sometimes things are out of your control. Like I get it.
910100	913200	This is not me advocating for you staying with a guy who's bad for you.
913200	916700	All right, but this is me advocating for having some fucking forethought
916700	920500	and who you reproduce with and for like maybe thinking hmm.
920600	923500	Okay. Is this person actually marriage material before settling down
923500	925000	before having kids with them?
925000	926500	Rather than just rushing into things blindly
926500	929600	because you're basically used to social media culture
929600	932700	where instant gratification is the name of the game.
932700	934700	Yeah, I suppose people were more traditionalists.
934700	936800	There have been a few mass shootings in the past
936800	940600	where these shooters actually stated that they were incels
940600	943600	or were radicalized by online incels.
943600	945900	What do you think about their actions?
945900	948200	I condemn their actions. I don't believe in violence.
949200	953500	And that is more than your average Muslim does for a Muslim attack.
953500	959100	So we're at the point now where the incels are morally superior to the Islamists.
959100	960800	The solution.
960800	963400	I don't believe attacking random people is going to fix anything
963400	965700	whether they're, you know, women or men.
965700	968400	I do think that the reason why they committed those actions
968400	973200	was probably because of out of desperation or out of, you know, mental problems.
973200	979000	They probably could have been prevented had the right support
979000	981400	was in their community, in their household.
981400	984100	If people saw what they were posting
984100	986600	and saw what they were experiencing in life
986600	988000	and did something to help them.
988000	988800	Was there like...
988800	989800	Yeah, exactly, right?
989800	992400	I mean, wasn't that the point of the Joker movie?
992400	995200	You know, his meds were cut and the social support systems weren't there
995200	996700	and he couldn't see his therapist anymore
996700	999200	and everything kind of spiraled downward for him.
999200	1002000	Yeah, man, like that's the absolute right answer.
1002400	1004200	A pivotal moment in your life,
1004200	1007600	like a straw that broke the metaphorical camel's back.
1007600	1011400	When did you know you were gay?
1011400	1012600	God.
1012600	1014600	You know, it's constant years of rejection
1014600	1015800	no matter who the person was,
1015800	1018400	constant years of rejection in other aspects of my life.
1018400	1023500	It did kind of push me towards more, I suppose, radical beliefs
1023500	1027200	but I suppose they're only like radical, but they're more just old beliefs.
1027200	1028200	Yeah, he doesn't think they're radical at all.
1028200	1030000	He just seems like a conservative, you know,
1030000	1032600	just a basic bitch conservative in a lot of ways.
1032600	1036200	And he even said, rejection in other areas of life.
1036200	1037800	So not even romantic, you know.
1037800	1039400	This guy probably had school problems.
1039400	1041800	You know, this guy probably dropped out of college or something.
1041800	1044000	This guy probably had problems getting a job.
1044000	1049600	You know, this mindset is not solely based around sexual activity.
1049600	1054000	It's based around these people being rejected by everybody.
1055000	1059400	And you'd have to be completely heartless to not at least have some sympathy for them.
1059400	1060400	Really?
1060400	1065400	No, it sounds like I had another metaphor, like death by a thousand cuts.
1065400	1067400	You know, it's not like one pivotal moment,
1067400	1069400	but it sounds like a bunch of things built up over time.
1069400	1070400	Yeah.
1070400	1074400	One of the common criticisms about the incel community
1074400	1078800	is that you feel entitled to sex or intimacy.
1078800	1083000	Do you believe that you deserve sex or intimacy?
1083000	1086000	Sex or intimacy from a woman?
1086000	1091600	I think everybody at some level deserves someone that they,
1091600	1094600	someone that loves them and, you know, respects them
1094600	1098600	as long as you are also loving and respectful towards that person, you know.
1098600	1100200	I don't think deserve is the right word.
1100200	1102000	I think that everyone wants that.
1102000	1104200	Everyone should have the chance to try and get that.
1104200	1106200	But no one deserves a partner.
1106200	1107200	No.
1107200	1108600	They're an equal.
1108600	1111600	You know, you're not like seeking someone beyond yourself.
1111600	1115600	You know, you don't have like too high standards, I suppose, you know.
1115600	1119000	If you can tell the world about something, about being incel,
1119000	1122400	that, you know, that may not be the internet or that's overlooked heavily,
1122400	1123600	what would it be?
1123600	1124200	I don't know.
1124200	1128800	I think it's mostly that most of the men are not inherently bad people.
1128800	1130800	A lot of them are just lonely.
1130800	1133000	They just need some help, really.
1133000	1134400	Exactly.
1134400	1137800	Eggs fucking zachly, dude.
1137800	1139600	Like, I can't say anything else.
1139600	1141400	That was the best way to say that.
1142400	1146200	Would you say that there's anything that other people can do
1146200	1150800	to help guide or just support or...
1150800	1153200	You know, the lonely person in your class
1153200	1155600	or the lonely person in your workplace,
1155600	1158600	maybe he's an incel and he's not letting you know
1158600	1160200	and he's just kind of afraid.
1160200	1161400	He wants someone positive.
1161400	1162200	Just be nice.
1162200	1163000	Say hi.
1163000	1164400	Try and make friends with him.
1164400	1165200	You don't have to date him.
1165200	1166600	You don't have to whatever.
1166600	1170600	Just, you know, brighten up someone lonely's day, I suppose.
1171400	1173800	Okay, noted. Thank you.
1173800	1174800	Yeah, man.
1174800	1179200	So basically the stuff you were taught watching Sesame Street,
1179200	1182200	the stuff that you knew from watching any like children's movie
1182200	1185600	where like the bully is the villain of the movie or something or the show.
1185600	1186800	Yeah.
1186800	1189600	It's almost like these people have not realized
1189600	1193600	that they've become the bullies that they hated.
1193600	1194800	You don't want to be an incel?
1194800	1196200	No.
1196200	1197600	Why not?
1197600	1199800	Well, I mean, it's part of the whole involuntarily thing.
1199800	1205200	I mean, I what the fuck kind of a question was that?
1205200	1206400	You don't want to be an incel?
1206400	1207400	What?
1207400	1210100	Oh, you know, you want to try and escape it.
1210100	1215000	You want to be something better, you know, you want to get a wife,
1215000	1216800	get a girlfriend, get someone who loves you,
1216800	1219600	spend spending your life with them and be happy.
1219600	1223600	And what's one thing you wish people understood better about you?
1223600	1223900	Hold on.
1223900	1225800	I'm just gonna go back a minute.
1225800	1228300	Like as he's talking about like his aspirations.
1228300	1229600	Look at her face.
1229600	1233000	She's like there's like a moment here.
1233000	1236900	Where it almost seems like she's thinking I have this all pegged wrong.
1236900	1240000	Like a glimmer of self-reflection.
1240000	1241900	Be happy and see that.
1241900	1246100	What's one thing you wish people understood better about you?
1246100	1246700	I don't know.
1246700	1251500	I guess I people I wish people would recognize how much effort I'm trying.
1251500	1253600	I suppose like, you know, I'm working out typically daily.
1253600	1255100	I've lost over a hundred pounds.
1255100	1255800	Nice dude.
1255800	1257500	Congrats actively.
1257500	1262900	I don't think people recognize how much effort the incels in general try to put into bettering themselves.
1262900	1264600	I would say, you know, people don't recognize their effort.
1264600	1271500	They just assume that they're all like lazy and sad and angry at women and just giving up and things of that nature.
1271500	1277300	I suppose you don't have to see the bad things in the world and then come out a bad person.
1277300	1282000	You can just see the bad things in the world and then improve upon yourself because of them.
1282000	1284100	I suppose so you do have hope.
1284100	1285500	Yeah, I have I have hope.
1285500	1286200	Yeah.
1286200	1287600	Yeah, that's awesome.
1287600	1289000	I suppose I won't lie.
1289000	1293500	This one a lot differently than I thought it would I thought I thought we'd be yelling at each other,
1293500	1296600	you know, I kind of had a feeling it was going to go like this,
1296600	1298500	you know, it was nice to meet you.
1298500	1300200	It was nice to meet you too.
1300200	1303000	Thank you so much.
1303000	1303600	Hello.
1303600	1305100	Thanks for watching the video.
1305100	1305300	Okay.
1305300	1308300	Well, whatever are you is this guy getting any dates from these women?
1308300	1311500	Do you think I mean probably not but nonetheless?
1311500	1313700	Yeah, this was this was a something wasn't it?
1313700	1315100	This was honestly a pretty good video
1315100	1319200	and I'm surprised that it actually went up on this channel considering how well it went.
1319200	1325200	You know, this definitely does not contribute to the whole demonization of incels thing like this this humanizes them
1325200	1330600	and considering that humanizing your political enemies is one of the Cardinal sins of social justice.
1330600	1331800	I'm surprised it went up at all,
1331800	1339100	you know, but I guess props on them for showing off this guy to be a good guy who's just been ridiculously unlucky.
1339100	1346000	You know, like in the end in cells are men with severe depression.
1346000	1350800	I would say and maybe the severe depression is partially caused by their environment,
1350800	1359700	but nonetheless severe depression one of the newer intersectionality is one of the newer intersectional identities is mental health,
1359700	1365300	you know, that's another another axis of oppression in the SJW landscape
1365300	1371300	and considering that you think that SJWs would be significantly more friendly towards the incels
1371300	1374900	because they have textbook depression about the state of their lives.
1374900	1377700	But no, I guess like mental health privilege
1377700	1384600	and mental disorder oppression or whatever only counts if you're not a straight white man
1384600	1388800	because at the end of the day in cells are people that need help
1388800	1394200	and the progressives seem to be jumping through hoops to try and justify not giving it to them.
