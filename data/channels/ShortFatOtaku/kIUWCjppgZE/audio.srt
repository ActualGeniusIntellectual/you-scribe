1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,060
I once made a video titled, health care is not a human right.

2
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:12,480
And despite the title of today's video, I'm completely correct, health care isn't

3
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:13,480
a right.

4
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:16,960
Health care is the labour of other people, and you don't have a right to anybody else's

5
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:17,960
labour.

6
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:20,400
You might trade something for it, or maybe they'll give it to you willingly, but if

7
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:25,060
you had a right to it, that means you compel it out of them even if they don't get compensated

8
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:26,060
for it.

9
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:29,960
Nobody has the right to expropriate the labour of others, and so, nobody has the right to

10
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:30,960
health care.

11
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33,640
But that was more of a political philosophy video.

12
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:36,800
This video isn't about rights, instead it's a practical discussion.

13
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:41,620
Classical liberals, social liberals, conservatives and libertarians all consider free or highly

14
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:46,740
open competitive markets to be the best way to efficiently distribute resources in society.

15
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:47,740
And they're correct!

16
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:51,980
But unlike most other goods and services, health care has some unique facets that result

17
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:55,840
in a highly competitive market not actually creating the best health care system through

18
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:57,200
those competitive forces.

19
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:00,580
The nature of the health care market means that, unlike a lot of other markets, a purely

20
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:04,120
deregulated no-government version of it is not functional.

21
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:07,720
Let's begin by describing an economic concept called a perfect competition.

22
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:11,620
According to Investopedia, perfect competition is a theoretical market structure where the

23
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:13,320
following criteria are met.

24
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:17,280
All firms sell an identical product, meaning there's no difference in what's being sold

25
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,320
or in its quality.

26
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:22,560
All firms are price takers, meaning that any one individual seller is small enough that

27
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:26,180
they can't unilaterally influence the market price of their product.

28
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:30,260
Its share has no influence on prices, meaning that the market is so competitive that even

29
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:33,740
larger sellers can't adjust their prices without suffering a loss.

30
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:37,700
Buyers have complete information about the product being sold and the prices being charged,

31
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:40,660
meaning that everybody buying the product knows exactly what they're buying and what

32
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:44,140
it should cost, so it's impossible for sellers to pull a fast one.

33
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:47,420
Capital resources and labour are perfectly mobile, meaning that capital and labour can

34
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:49,300
move within the market without incurring a cost.

35
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:53,140
And firms can enter and exit the market without cost, pretty self-explanatory.

36
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:57,540
Some other definitions of perfect competition include points like no externalities, meaning

37
00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:01,740
that costs and benefits of an activity don't affect some uninvolved third party.

38
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:05,740
Or all buyers are rational, meaning that every single choice people make in this market increases

39
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:06,740
their standing.

40
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:10,740
And a whole bunch of others, but frankly, all of these points overlap in a lot of ways,

41
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:13,900
and can be boiled down to four easy-to-understand factors.

42
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:14,900
1.

43
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:15,900
All the products are homogenous.

44
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:16,900
2.

45
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:17,900
All actors are price takers.

46
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:18,900
3.

47
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:20,060
All actors have perfect knowledge.

48
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:21,060
And 4.

49
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:22,940
All actor has an entry or exit cost.

50
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:27,740
I should make it clear at this point that perfect competition does not and cannot actually

51
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:29,120
exist in the real world.

52
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:33,580
There is no market that, if left to its own devices, would naturally read a state of perfect

53
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:34,580
competition.

54
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:39,300
Rather, the idea is that various markets, if left to their own devices, will reach various

55
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:41,420
places on a spectrum of competition.

56
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:46,300
The closer any given market's natural spot on that spectrum is to perfect competition,

57
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:50,040
the less that outside regulation will be required to keep the market intact.

58
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:53,400
The further away from perfect competition on the spectrum, the more regulation will

59
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,400
be required.

60
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:58,520
Over-regulating a market relative to its level of natural competition generally leads to

61
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:00,940
excess economic drag that destroys the market.

62
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:04,920
In other words, taxes and regulations make everything cost too much, while under-regulating

63
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:07,120
a market generally leads to a market failure.

64
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,600
In other words, there's no instance where supply and demand match up so nothing gets

65
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:11,600
sold.

66
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,920
So, with all of this in mind, let's consider the healthcare market.

67
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:16,880
Using these four points, how close is it to perfect competition?

68
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:19,000
Well, one, are the products homogenous?

69
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,720
As in, are healthcare products indistinguishable from one another?

70
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:23,000
The answer is obviously no.

71
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,680
Every health problem has a different solution.

72
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:26,600
There's not one cure for everything.

73
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:30,360
Even within the realm of one disease, there may also be multiple treatments.

74
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:33,440
Additionally, healthcare is constantly changing, with new medicines, new surgeries, and new

75
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,280
forms of therapy appearing constantly.

76
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:39,480
Not only that, but individual actors often perceive healthcare in a specific, particular

77
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:40,480
manner.

78
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:43,520
People may prefer some brands or types of medicine over others, even if there's no

79
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:44,840
practical difference.

80
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:48,200
People will prefer their own familiar family doctor over somebody new.

81
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:51,720
People often visit the same pharmacy to get their drugs, even if another would do just

82
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:52,720
as well.

83
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:56,680
Even in instances where products might be homogenous, the intimate nature of healthcare

84
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,560
leads people to treat them as if they're not.

85
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:01,320
How about point two, are all actors price takers?

86
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:05,340
As in, no individual actor can affect prices, meaning buyers can't bargain any lower and

87
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:08,680
sellers can't bargain any higher because price equilibrium has already been reached.

88
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:10,500
Again, the answer is obviously no.

89
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:13,160
Healthcare providers have a lot of influence to set prices in the market.

90
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:15,040
There's a number of reasons for why this is the case.

91
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:18,400
One is the inelastic demand for healthcare, meaning that the buyers of healthcare don't

92
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:21,280
see their demand drop off as supply or price changes.

93
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:22,280
Here's an example.

94
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:23,480
Assume you have a cure for cancer.

95
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:27,640
If you have cancer and the price for the cure is $1,000, you'll want to stay alive so you'll

96
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:28,840
pay the $1,000.

97
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:33,160
If the price is now $10,000, your desire to stay alive hasn't gone down, you'll still

98
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:34,200
pay that price.

99
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:38,240
For most people, if it means staying alive, the healthcare market can charge them everything

100
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:41,160
they have to be cured, because what are they going to do, not get cured?

101
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:45,360
So the demand for the cure is inelastic, meaning that the normal supply demand curve doesn't

102
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:48,560
really apply because there's no upper limit on what you might pay.

103
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,560
Of course, for some people, this just isn't the case.

104
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:54,840
A 90-year-old might not want to destroy his savings and leave his family with nothing

105
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:58,120
in order to cure some disease if he's just going to die of something else a little bit

106
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:59,120
later anyway.

107
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:02,480
This is the don't destroy your economy for the sake of grandma because of COVID argument

108
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:03,480
and it's a good one.

109
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:07,620
But for most regular people, the demand for healthcare is pretty inelastic.

110
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:08,620
Now you might object here.

111
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:12,140
You might say, well, if somebody wanted to charge me too much for a cure, I'd shop

112
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:13,380
around for a lower price.

113
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:14,920
And that might work to a limited extent.

114
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:18,900
But that leads to the second reason as to why some actors are price takers and some

115
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:19,900
aren't.

116
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:22,900
There's an extremely limited supply of healthcare options in any given area.

117
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:26,780
Most people can't just fly to a different location to get more specialized or competitive

118
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:27,780
care.

119
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:30,740
Most people are stuck with the one hospital in their town, the handful of doctors that

120
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:34,740
are still hanging around, and if they're lucky, a trip to the nearest city to see a

121
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:35,740
specialist.

122
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:38,100
If you live in a city, you'll certainly have access to some more options, but it's

123
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:41,260
still not going to be on the same level as something like having five grocery stores

124
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:43,020
all within distance to buy your food at.

125
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:44,900
The third reason is because of patents.

126
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:45,900
Patents are good.

127
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:49,000
They allow inventors and discoverers of new products to profit off their hard work and

128
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,680
not just have it stolen from them, but they also severely restrict the supply of some

129
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:53,680
products.

130
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:54,980
Consider that cancer cure again.

131
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:58,900
If one doctor discovers the cure for cancer and patents it, he ends up holding a monopoly

132
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:00,740
and can charge whatever he wants for that cure.

133
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:02,060
And on some level, good for him.

134
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:05,860
He put in the work of discovering it and deserves to be rewarded disproportionately in comparison

135
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:06,960
to those who didn't.

136
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,160
But without competition, you still reach the same problem I described in my first point.

137
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:14,380
Patents can exacerbate the negative effects of inelastic demand.

138
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:17,840
And they're likely the reason why at least some price controls are necessary.

139
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:20,140
Let's move on to the third quality of perfect markets.

140
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:21,920
Do all actors have perfect knowledge?

141
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:24,320
Again, for the third time, absolutely not.

142
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:27,960
Healthcare providers have a huge information advantage compared to patients, giving them

143
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:31,920
ample opportunity to obscure the actual market price of any good or service.

144
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:35,640
I remember reading an article on a recent weekly sip a few weeks ago where a dentist

145
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:40,600
took advantage of his low information customer base to perform a number of unnecessary fillings

146
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:43,240
and root canals in order to line his pockets.

147
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:46,400
The average person doesn't have enough knowledge to evaluate whether or not they're getting

148
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:49,280
a good deal from their doctor or just being taken for a ride.

149
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:52,920
The reason you should be getting second opinions on medical advice isn't only because your

150
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:56,360
doctor might be shit, it's also because your doctor might be scamming you.

151
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:58,880
And four, do actors have entry or exit costs?

152
00:06:58,880 --> 00:06:59,880
Yes, they do.

153
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:03,280
Beyond simply the cost of starting up a business, the regulatory cost of starting a healthcare

154
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,680
business specifically is quite high.

155
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,440
And to be honest, I'm kind of okay with that.

156
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:10,840
Yes, the ancaps are correct that a healthcare market with no regulations would remove entry

157
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:12,920
costs and probably lead to lower prices.

158
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:13,920
That's true.

159
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:14,920
But you know what else we'd see?

160
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:17,900
Remember this quack from red litter media fame who tried to sell this dumb roller device

161
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:22,280
as a pain reliever so you could make an infomercial where he rolls it all over a naked lady?

162
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:27,680
Yeah, this guy got absolutely fucked by healthcare-related lawsuits for selling such an obviously fraudulent

163
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:28,680
device.

164
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:32,740
Pre-regulation, the amount of snake oil being peddled by less than reputable individuals

165
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:34,160
was way higher.

166
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:37,640
If you want to be sold pills that do nothing and devices that don't work for an illness

167
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:40,420
you don't actually have, deregulation is the way to go.

168
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:45,300
But having an actually functional healthcare service requires some consumer protections,

169
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:48,200
which means there needs to be some market entry costs.

170
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:51,720
There are certainly ways we can reform the current regulations to reduce drag while not

171
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:57,000
sacrificing quality, but the extremist position of no regulation just isn't tenable.

172
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,080
There are some other libertarian objections to universal healthcare that are probably

173
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,380
worth going over as well.

174
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:05,900
People often rightfully object that centralized systems tend to become more inefficient and

175
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:07,500
corrupt the larger they grow.

176
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:08,500
This is true.

177
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:11,000
This is often an argument against universal healthcare in America.

178
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,540
That the federal government can't possibly manage a system that is large and centralized

179
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:17,560
enough to account for all of America's citizens and locations.

180
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:22,300
But the truth is, most other countries don't actually have that kind of centralized system.

181
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:26,520
The Nordic countries, Canada, the UK, and I think Japan as well, have devolved a lot

182
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:29,540
of their healthcare operations to more local levels of government.

183
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:33,300
Using the system I know best as an example, federal involvement in Canadian healthcare

184
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:37,380
basically amounts to a legal requirement that the provincial government implement a universal

185
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:38,940
health insurance plan.

186
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:40,420
Everything else is left to the provinces.

187
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:44,320
It's funny, if you ask your average American socialist the question, do you want Canadian

188
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:47,060
style healthcare, they'll overwhelmingly say yes.

189
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:51,100
But if you ask them the question, do you want each individual state government to manage

190
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:55,360
their own healthcare service, they'll reject that option in favor of a universal standard.

191
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,620
It's almost like they don't know what they're talking about.

192
00:08:57,620 --> 00:09:01,720
Just to clarify here, single payer healthcare refers to systems where hospitals and clinics

193
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:05,840
are privately owned, where doctors can work for themselves or work for others, but the

194
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:10,960
bill is paid for by the state's health insurance program, that's the single entity that pays.

195
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:14,620
While multi payer refers to systems that have a number of different insurance programs,

196
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:17,420
both private and state run, that cover the cost.

197
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:21,260
These two schemes contrast with systems where there is little to no government involvement

198
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:25,140
in healthcare, like how the US is often portrayed, and systems where the government not only

199
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:29,360
pays for healthcare, but owns all of the infrastructure that provides it, and employs

200
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:33,460
all of the doctors directly as state employees as well, like in China.

201
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:37,620
It does turn out that the Canadian style decentralized single payer system is pretty efficient though.

202
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:41,300
I know the World Health Organization is quite shitty nowadays, but it wasn't always so,

203
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:45,740
and back in 2000 they put out a study on the efficiency of the healthcare systems in 190

204
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:49,940
odd nations, and those decentralized single payer countries ranked pretty well.

205
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:55,060
However the top spots were held by decentralized multi payer countries, like France and Italy.

206
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:58,820
There's a wealth of data from the OECD as well, comparing the healthcare for multiple

207
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:03,260
different nations, and on average, countries with some form of universal healthcare system

208
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:06,220
are able to match or exceed America on pretty much everything.

209
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:09,880
Another libertarian criticism is that the less regulated, more profit driven system

210
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:13,140
of the United States gives them an advantage when it comes to research and development

211
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:14,780
of new drugs and practices.

212
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:18,780
A more profit driven system can lead to more innovation, and healthcare is no exception,

213
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:22,140
but I'm not sure how much of that is actually a contributing factor here.

214
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:25,920
America does produce a lot of innovation, don't get me wrong, but a 2010 study in the

215
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:29,900
American Journal of Public Health found that while America does produce a huge amount of

216
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:33,940
innovation in healthcare, it's proportional to America's GDP and the amount of money

217
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:35,540
America spends on healthcare.

218
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:39,540
The same study also notes that countries with more regulations still produce as much innovation

219
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:43,620
proportionally, so the fear that America might lose its competitive edge if it adopts a single

220
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:47,900
payer system may be unfounded, even if that precludes the option for private investment.

221
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:50,020
There's a couple reasons for this.

222
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:53,840
One is that insofar as drugs are concerned, even countries with the best universal healthcare

223
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:55,920
schemes generally don't cover drugs.

224
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:59,740
This makes sense to me because a healthcare service is something that you use only occasionally,

225
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:03,560
so setting it up to be a communal pot to cover that occasional use, like how you'd fund

226
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:08,400
a firefighting service, seems reasonable, while drugs are goods that are owned privately

227
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:11,700
and used exclusively, so it makes a lot more sense that you should have to buy them.

228
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:15,220
So all that being said, the pharmaceutical industry is likely to remain private, and

229
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:18,180
the benefits of a private system will still apply, including innovation.

230
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:21,740
Meanwhile in the medical side of the system, there's not much reason to believe that

231
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:25,560
a single payer option will lead to some kind of innovative stagnation.

232
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:29,500
Consider the American military and American spaceflight, two domains where, despite there

233
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:33,960
being a single payer system, in that only the American government is selling contracts

234
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:37,780
for these services in the US, there are multiple private companies competing against each other

235
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:39,100
to fulfill the contracts.

236
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:44,100
The innovation stagnation argument is a lot stronger when it comes to the outright nationalization

237
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:45,140
of a business.

238
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:48,620
Not so much when private businesses continue to compete, and the government just so happens

239
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:49,780
to be the customer.

240
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:53,260
Another common criticism is efficiency of cost, which is different than the efficiency

241
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:55,060
of service discussion we had earlier.

242
00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:59,640
And on this point, there is no argument, we've all seen those ridiculous bills that go viral

243
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:03,040
on social media, where people end up paying tens of thousands of dollars just to have

244
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,860
a kid at a hospital in the States.

245
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:06,300
It's rather crazy to be honest.

246
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:10,260
Here's some more data from the OECD, and it shouldn't surprise anybody just how much more

247
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:13,640
Americans spend on healthcare, but take a closer look at the numbers breakdown.

248
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:19,960
The OECD average shows, per person, $3,038 of public spending, meaning coming from government

249
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:26,240
taxes, $207 of private spending, meaning coming from a private insurer, and $629 of out of

250
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:29,320
pocket spending, meaning the person themselves has to pay for it.

251
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:36,280
Compare that to American numbers, $4,993 and $1,122 out of pocket dollars, which are both

252
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:39,820
much higher, but at least proportional to the OECD average.

253
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:43,320
But Americans also spend $4,092 on private spending.

254
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:47,080
That's both directly and proportionally much higher, and we've already gone over the data

255
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:51,160
earlier showing healthcare quality to be about on par, so Americans aren't really getting

256
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:52,440
a good bang for their buck.

257
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:56,640
That extra $4,000 in private spending, that's money going to private health insurance companies.

258
00:12:56,640 --> 00:13:01,760
In another study, aptly named Healthcare Administrative Costs in the United States and Canada, 2017,

259
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:05,220
it's found that the American system is more inefficient than the Canadian one, despite

260
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:09,060
the gross inefficiencies of the Canadian one, and I know them well, specifically because

261
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:13,180
the deregulated nature of the American system has allowed private insurance companies to

262
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:16,940
create a gigantic bureaucratic apparatus that is incredibly inefficient and drives

263
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:18,060
costs way up.

264
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:21,720
In most markets, the hardcore libertarian types have a good point when they say that

265
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:26,300
deregulation promotes competition, and competition will force businesses to trim the fat in order

266
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:27,300
to stay competitive.

267
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:30,100
But in the healthcare market, the opposite has actually happened.

268
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:33,540
Due to the unique nature of healthcare, which we went over earlier, the inelastic demand,

269
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:38,360
the lack of knowledge, etc., excessive deregulation actually leads to more market inefficiency.

270
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:42,500
In healthcare, once regulation puts a hard cap on the profit motive, the business model

271
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:46,580
naturally shifts to reducing costs, which can be bad depending on how it's done, and

272
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:51,860
broadening market access, which is not only a positive, but the exact goal of the regulation.

273
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:55,380
Looking over everything I've presented here today, it seems like while the possibility

274
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:59,960
for disaster certainly exists, as right-leaning people like to point out, it is also entirely

275
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:04,180
possible for there to be a universal healthcare service that avoids the inefficiencies inherent

276
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:08,080
to central planning, avoids the tendency of government to destroy competition through

277
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:12,080
nationalization, still provide quality service, still allow for innovation, and broaden access

278
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:14,160
to the service while reducing costs.

279
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:18,520
I would however warn left-leaning people that this is not due to the failure of markets

280
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:22,760
themselves, nor is it a structural problem inherent to liberal capitalism, but rather

281
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:25,520
it is due to the unique nature of the healthcare market.

282
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:28,660
This could not be replicated with the food market or the property market, for example.

283
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:30,080
They are all different animals.

284
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:33,520
But if you're dumb enough to just call it all capitalism and think it's all bad, you

285
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:35,280
probably don't get that.

286
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:38,080
The thing is, the libertarians of old understood this too.

287
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:42,760
No, I don't mean that common commie talking point of OMG, libertarian used to mean socialist

288
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:43,760
but they stole it from us.

289
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:46,000
That's just a bunch of crying coke, frankly.

290
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,880
Frederick Hayek is considered a libertarian before his time.

291
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:52,640
He called himself a classical liberal, and in his 1943 book, The Road to Serfdom, he

292
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:56,400
wrote extensively about what is now known to be the libertarian argument for a universal

293
00:14:56,400 --> 00:15:00,640
healthcare service, where, as in the case of sickness and accident, neither the desire

294
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:05,040
to avoid such calamities nor the efforts to overcome their consequences are as a rule

295
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:10,720
weakened by the provision of assistance, where, in short, we deal with genuinely insurable

296
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:11,720
risks.

297
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:15,000
The case for the states helping to organize a comprehensive system of social insurance

298
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
is very strong.

299
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,200
There is no incompatibility in principle between the states providing greater security in this

300
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:22,240
way and the preservation of individual freedom.

301
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:26,400
To the same category belongs also the increase of security through the states rendering assistance

302
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:29,800
to the victims of such acts of God as earthquakes and floods.

303
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:33,480
Wherever communal action can mitigate disasters against which the individual can neither attempt

304
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:37,280
to guard himself nor make provision for the consequences, such communal action should

305
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:39,040
undoubtedly be taken.

306
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:43,720
Unlike the frankly crazier libertarians and anarcho-capitalists who came later, Hayek

307
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:45,960
was not interested in stateless societies.

308
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:48,960
He recognized the necessity of the state, but he also recognized the necessity that

309
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:50,880
its power be checked and restricted.

310
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:54,960
After Hayek had abandoned his native Austria for the UK and refused to return due to it

311
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:58,960
being brought under the control of Nazi Germany, he wrote The Road to Serfdom to specifically

312
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:04,260
be a rebuttal to both fascism and communism from not only a moral but economic perspective.

313
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:08,520
His position, a position I think is true, is that loss of individual liberties occurs

314
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:12,560
when the government controls economic decision-making through the type of central planning necessary

315
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:16,720
to implement a command economy, something that fascist Italy, Nazi Germany, and Soviet

316
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,000
Russia all did.

317
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,220
Hayek also argued that the abandonment of classical liberalism in favor of these planist

318
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:25,800
ideologies would create oppressive societies, and he was right.

319
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:30,440
And despite this, he still viewed a universal healthcare service not as a component of planism,

320
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:34,800
not as a backslide into these totalitarian, authoritarian ideologies, but rather as a

321
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:37,060
method to maximize personal liberty.

322
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:40,240
And from a layman's perspective, it's not hard to intuit how this is true.

323
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:44,020
It's not only that we have an ethical injunction to help the sick, it's that if a person can

324
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:48,540
return to contributing to society after being cared for, he more than makes up his burden.

325
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:51,160
It's both a moral and a material argument.

326
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:56,120
One of Hayek's most famous quotes is regulation for competition, the meaning being that government

327
00:16:56,120 --> 00:17:00,080
should regulate a market if that promotes competition, and should deregulate if that

328
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:01,080
promotes competition.

329
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:04,960
It's not a dogmatic stance of deregulate everything or nationalize everything, but

330
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:08,440
rather an understanding of the practical reality that not every market is the same, and that

331
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:10,880
state action is not universally evil.

332
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:13,560
By the way, despite all of this, healthcare still isn't a right.

333
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:16,080
You still don't get to compel labor out of others.

334
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:19,340
You still don't get to take from them and not provide compensation for the taking.

335
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:23,360
But understanding that fact and operating within that knowledge, a universal healthcare

336
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:25,180
service is still a good idea.

337
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:28,860
It's still a privilege that wealthy nations should afford to their citizens, if they have

338
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:30,020
the money to do so.

339
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:33,160
And thinking so is not exclusively a socialist position.

340
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:37,020
There is a strong capitalist argument for universal healthcare, and frankly it's a

341
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:39,820
bit strange to see that America hasn't figured it out yet.

342
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:42,640
Alright guys, that about does it for me, thank you very much for watching.

343
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:47,340
I have a feeling that this video will be controversial among my audience, but just remember, if I've

344
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:49,180
offended you, I'm right.

345
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:52,980
As always, streaming tonight on the gaming channel, twitch.tv slash game boomers, make

346
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:53,980
sure you drop by.

347
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:55,220
I'll see you there.

348
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:56,580
Have a good one, I love you.
