0	9060	I once made a video titled, health care is not a human right.
9060	12480	And despite the title of today's video, I'm completely correct, health care isn't
12480	13480	a right.
13480	16960	Health care is the labour of other people, and you don't have a right to anybody else's
16960	17960	labour.
17960	20400	You might trade something for it, or maybe they'll give it to you willingly, but if
20400	25060	you had a right to it, that means you compel it out of them even if they don't get compensated
25060	26060	for it.
26060	29960	Nobody has the right to expropriate the labour of others, and so, nobody has the right to
29960	30960	health care.
30960	33640	But that was more of a political philosophy video.
33640	36800	This video isn't about rights, instead it's a practical discussion.
36800	41620	Classical liberals, social liberals, conservatives and libertarians all consider free or highly
41620	46740	open competitive markets to be the best way to efficiently distribute resources in society.
46740	47740	And they're correct!
47740	51980	But unlike most other goods and services, health care has some unique facets that result
51980	55840	in a highly competitive market not actually creating the best health care system through
55840	57200	those competitive forces.
57200	60580	The nature of the health care market means that, unlike a lot of other markets, a purely
60580	64120	deregulated no-government version of it is not functional.
64120	67720	Let's begin by describing an economic concept called a perfect competition.
67720	71620	According to Investopedia, perfect competition is a theoretical market structure where the
71620	73320	following criteria are met.
73320	77280	All firms sell an identical product, meaning there's no difference in what's being sold
77280	78320	or in its quality.
78320	82560	All firms are price takers, meaning that any one individual seller is small enough that
82560	86180	they can't unilaterally influence the market price of their product.
86180	90260	Its share has no influence on prices, meaning that the market is so competitive that even
90260	93740	larger sellers can't adjust their prices without suffering a loss.
93740	97700	Buyers have complete information about the product being sold and the prices being charged,
97700	100660	meaning that everybody buying the product knows exactly what they're buying and what
100660	104140	it should cost, so it's impossible for sellers to pull a fast one.
104140	107420	Capital resources and labour are perfectly mobile, meaning that capital and labour can
107420	109300	move within the market without incurring a cost.
109300	113140	And firms can enter and exit the market without cost, pretty self-explanatory.
113140	117540	Some other definitions of perfect competition include points like no externalities, meaning
117540	121740	that costs and benefits of an activity don't affect some uninvolved third party.
121740	125740	Or all buyers are rational, meaning that every single choice people make in this market increases
125740	126740	their standing.
126740	130740	And a whole bunch of others, but frankly, all of these points overlap in a lot of ways,
130740	133900	and can be boiled down to four easy-to-understand factors.
133900	134900	1.
134900	135900	All the products are homogenous.
135900	136900	2.
136900	137900	All actors are price takers.
137900	138900	3.
138900	140060	All actors have perfect knowledge.
140060	141060	And 4.
141060	142940	All actor has an entry or exit cost.
142940	147740	I should make it clear at this point that perfect competition does not and cannot actually
147740	149120	exist in the real world.
149120	153580	There is no market that, if left to its own devices, would naturally read a state of perfect
153580	154580	competition.
154580	159300	Rather, the idea is that various markets, if left to their own devices, will reach various
159300	161420	places on a spectrum of competition.
161420	166300	The closer any given market's natural spot on that spectrum is to perfect competition,
166300	170040	the less that outside regulation will be required to keep the market intact.
170040	173400	The further away from perfect competition on the spectrum, the more regulation will
173400	174400	be required.
174400	178520	Over-regulating a market relative to its level of natural competition generally leads to
178520	180940	excess economic drag that destroys the market.
180940	184920	In other words, taxes and regulations make everything cost too much, while under-regulating
184920	187120	a market generally leads to a market failure.
187120	190600	In other words, there's no instance where supply and demand match up so nothing gets
190600	191600	sold.
191600	193920	So, with all of this in mind, let's consider the healthcare market.
193920	196880	Using these four points, how close is it to perfect competition?
196880	199000	Well, one, are the products homogenous?
199000	201720	As in, are healthcare products indistinguishable from one another?
201720	203000	The answer is obviously no.
203000	204680	Every health problem has a different solution.
204680	206600	There's not one cure for everything.
206600	210360	Even within the realm of one disease, there may also be multiple treatments.
210360	213440	Additionally, healthcare is constantly changing, with new medicines, new surgeries, and new
213440	215280	forms of therapy appearing constantly.
215280	219480	Not only that, but individual actors often perceive healthcare in a specific, particular
219480	220480	manner.
220480	223520	People may prefer some brands or types of medicine over others, even if there's no
223520	224840	practical difference.
224840	228200	People will prefer their own familiar family doctor over somebody new.
228200	231720	People often visit the same pharmacy to get their drugs, even if another would do just
231720	232720	as well.
232720	236680	Even in instances where products might be homogenous, the intimate nature of healthcare
236680	238560	leads people to treat them as if they're not.
238560	241320	How about point two, are all actors price takers?
241320	245340	As in, no individual actor can affect prices, meaning buyers can't bargain any lower and
245340	248680	sellers can't bargain any higher because price equilibrium has already been reached.
248680	250500	Again, the answer is obviously no.
250500	253160	Healthcare providers have a lot of influence to set prices in the market.
253160	255040	There's a number of reasons for why this is the case.
255040	258400	One is the inelastic demand for healthcare, meaning that the buyers of healthcare don't
258400	261280	see their demand drop off as supply or price changes.
261280	262280	Here's an example.
262280	263480	Assume you have a cure for cancer.
263480	267640	If you have cancer and the price for the cure is $1,000, you'll want to stay alive so you'll
267640	268840	pay the $1,000.
268840	273160	If the price is now $10,000, your desire to stay alive hasn't gone down, you'll still
273160	274200	pay that price.
274200	278240	For most people, if it means staying alive, the healthcare market can charge them everything
278240	281160	they have to be cured, because what are they going to do, not get cured?
281160	285360	So the demand for the cure is inelastic, meaning that the normal supply demand curve doesn't
285360	288560	really apply because there's no upper limit on what you might pay.
288560	290560	Of course, for some people, this just isn't the case.
290560	294840	A 90-year-old might not want to destroy his savings and leave his family with nothing
294840	298120	in order to cure some disease if he's just going to die of something else a little bit
298120	299120	later anyway.
299120	302480	This is the don't destroy your economy for the sake of grandma because of COVID argument
302480	303480	and it's a good one.
303480	307620	But for most regular people, the demand for healthcare is pretty inelastic.
307620	308620	Now you might object here.
308620	312140	You might say, well, if somebody wanted to charge me too much for a cure, I'd shop
312140	313380	around for a lower price.
313380	314920	And that might work to a limited extent.
314920	318900	But that leads to the second reason as to why some actors are price takers and some
318900	319900	aren't.
319900	322900	There's an extremely limited supply of healthcare options in any given area.
322900	326780	Most people can't just fly to a different location to get more specialized or competitive
326780	327780	care.
327780	330740	Most people are stuck with the one hospital in their town, the handful of doctors that
330740	334740	are still hanging around, and if they're lucky, a trip to the nearest city to see a
334740	335740	specialist.
335740	338100	If you live in a city, you'll certainly have access to some more options, but it's
338100	341260	still not going to be on the same level as something like having five grocery stores
341260	343020	all within distance to buy your food at.
343020	344900	The third reason is because of patents.
344900	345900	Patents are good.
345900	349000	They allow inventors and discoverers of new products to profit off their hard work and
349000	352680	not just have it stolen from them, but they also severely restrict the supply of some
352680	353680	products.
353680	354980	Consider that cancer cure again.
354980	358900	If one doctor discovers the cure for cancer and patents it, he ends up holding a monopoly
358900	360740	and can charge whatever he wants for that cure.
360740	362060	And on some level, good for him.
362060	365860	He put in the work of discovering it and deserves to be rewarded disproportionately in comparison
365860	366960	to those who didn't.
367000	371160	But without competition, you still reach the same problem I described in my first point.
371160	374380	Patents can exacerbate the negative effects of inelastic demand.
374380	377840	And they're likely the reason why at least some price controls are necessary.
377840	380140	Let's move on to the third quality of perfect markets.
380140	381920	Do all actors have perfect knowledge?
381920	384320	Again, for the third time, absolutely not.
384320	387960	Healthcare providers have a huge information advantage compared to patients, giving them
387960	391920	ample opportunity to obscure the actual market price of any good or service.
391920	395640	I remember reading an article on a recent weekly sip a few weeks ago where a dentist
395640	400600	took advantage of his low information customer base to perform a number of unnecessary fillings
400600	403240	and root canals in order to line his pockets.
403240	406400	The average person doesn't have enough knowledge to evaluate whether or not they're getting
406400	409280	a good deal from their doctor or just being taken for a ride.
409280	412920	The reason you should be getting second opinions on medical advice isn't only because your
412920	416360	doctor might be shit, it's also because your doctor might be scamming you.
416360	418880	And four, do actors have entry or exit costs?
418880	419880	Yes, they do.
419880	423280	Beyond simply the cost of starting up a business, the regulatory cost of starting a healthcare
423280	424680	business specifically is quite high.
424720	426440	And to be honest, I'm kind of okay with that.
426440	430840	Yes, the ancaps are correct that a healthcare market with no regulations would remove entry
430840	432920	costs and probably lead to lower prices.
432920	433920	That's true.
433920	434920	But you know what else we'd see?
434920	437900	Remember this quack from red litter media fame who tried to sell this dumb roller device
437900	442280	as a pain reliever so you could make an infomercial where he rolls it all over a naked lady?
442280	447680	Yeah, this guy got absolutely fucked by healthcare-related lawsuits for selling such an obviously fraudulent
447680	448680	device.
448680	452740	Pre-regulation, the amount of snake oil being peddled by less than reputable individuals
452740	454160	was way higher.
454160	457640	If you want to be sold pills that do nothing and devices that don't work for an illness
457640	460420	you don't actually have, deregulation is the way to go.
460420	465300	But having an actually functional healthcare service requires some consumer protections,
465300	468200	which means there needs to be some market entry costs.
468200	471720	There are certainly ways we can reform the current regulations to reduce drag while not
471720	477000	sacrificing quality, but the extremist position of no regulation just isn't tenable.
477000	480080	There are some other libertarian objections to universal healthcare that are probably
480080	481380	worth going over as well.
481380	485900	People often rightfully object that centralized systems tend to become more inefficient and
485900	487500	corrupt the larger they grow.
487500	488500	This is true.
488500	491000	This is often an argument against universal healthcare in America.
491000	494540	That the federal government can't possibly manage a system that is large and centralized
494540	497560	enough to account for all of America's citizens and locations.
497560	502300	But the truth is, most other countries don't actually have that kind of centralized system.
502300	506520	The Nordic countries, Canada, the UK, and I think Japan as well, have devolved a lot
506520	509540	of their healthcare operations to more local levels of government.
509540	513300	Using the system I know best as an example, federal involvement in Canadian healthcare
513300	517380	basically amounts to a legal requirement that the provincial government implement a universal
517380	518940	health insurance plan.
518940	520420	Everything else is left to the provinces.
520420	524320	It's funny, if you ask your average American socialist the question, do you want Canadian
524320	527060	style healthcare, they'll overwhelmingly say yes.
527060	531100	But if you ask them the question, do you want each individual state government to manage
531100	535360	their own healthcare service, they'll reject that option in favor of a universal standard.
535360	537620	It's almost like they don't know what they're talking about.
537620	541720	Just to clarify here, single payer healthcare refers to systems where hospitals and clinics
541720	545840	are privately owned, where doctors can work for themselves or work for others, but the
545840	550960	bill is paid for by the state's health insurance program, that's the single entity that pays.
550960	554620	While multi payer refers to systems that have a number of different insurance programs,
554620	557420	both private and state run, that cover the cost.
557420	561260	These two schemes contrast with systems where there is little to no government involvement
561260	565140	in healthcare, like how the US is often portrayed, and systems where the government not only
565140	569360	pays for healthcare, but owns all of the infrastructure that provides it, and employs
569360	573460	all of the doctors directly as state employees as well, like in China.
573460	577620	It does turn out that the Canadian style decentralized single payer system is pretty efficient though.
577620	581300	I know the World Health Organization is quite shitty nowadays, but it wasn't always so,
581300	585740	and back in 2000 they put out a study on the efficiency of the healthcare systems in 190
585740	589940	odd nations, and those decentralized single payer countries ranked pretty well.
589940	595060	However the top spots were held by decentralized multi payer countries, like France and Italy.
595060	598820	There's a wealth of data from the OECD as well, comparing the healthcare for multiple
598820	603260	different nations, and on average, countries with some form of universal healthcare system
603260	606220	are able to match or exceed America on pretty much everything.
606220	609880	Another libertarian criticism is that the less regulated, more profit driven system
609880	613140	of the United States gives them an advantage when it comes to research and development
613140	614780	of new drugs and practices.
614780	618780	A more profit driven system can lead to more innovation, and healthcare is no exception,
618780	622140	but I'm not sure how much of that is actually a contributing factor here.
622140	625920	America does produce a lot of innovation, don't get me wrong, but a 2010 study in the
625920	629900	American Journal of Public Health found that while America does produce a huge amount of
629900	633940	innovation in healthcare, it's proportional to America's GDP and the amount of money
633940	635540	America spends on healthcare.
635540	639540	The same study also notes that countries with more regulations still produce as much innovation
639540	643620	proportionally, so the fear that America might lose its competitive edge if it adopts a single
643620	647900	payer system may be unfounded, even if that precludes the option for private investment.
647900	650020	There's a couple reasons for this.
650020	653840	One is that insofar as drugs are concerned, even countries with the best universal healthcare
653840	655920	schemes generally don't cover drugs.
655920	659740	This makes sense to me because a healthcare service is something that you use only occasionally,
659740	663560	so setting it up to be a communal pot to cover that occasional use, like how you'd fund
663560	668400	a firefighting service, seems reasonable, while drugs are goods that are owned privately
668400	671700	and used exclusively, so it makes a lot more sense that you should have to buy them.
671700	675220	So all that being said, the pharmaceutical industry is likely to remain private, and
675220	678180	the benefits of a private system will still apply, including innovation.
678180	681740	Meanwhile in the medical side of the system, there's not much reason to believe that
681740	685560	a single payer option will lead to some kind of innovative stagnation.
685560	689500	Consider the American military and American spaceflight, two domains where, despite there
689500	693960	being a single payer system, in that only the American government is selling contracts
693960	697780	for these services in the US, there are multiple private companies competing against each other
697780	699100	to fulfill the contracts.
699100	704100	The innovation stagnation argument is a lot stronger when it comes to the outright nationalization
704100	705140	of a business.
705140	708620	Not so much when private businesses continue to compete, and the government just so happens
708620	709780	to be the customer.
709780	713260	Another common criticism is efficiency of cost, which is different than the efficiency
713260	715060	of service discussion we had earlier.
715060	719640	And on this point, there is no argument, we've all seen those ridiculous bills that go viral
719640	723040	on social media, where people end up paying tens of thousands of dollars just to have
723040	724860	a kid at a hospital in the States.
724860	726300	It's rather crazy to be honest.
726300	730260	Here's some more data from the OECD, and it shouldn't surprise anybody just how much more
730260	733640	Americans spend on healthcare, but take a closer look at the numbers breakdown.
733640	739960	The OECD average shows, per person, $3,038 of public spending, meaning coming from government
739960	746240	taxes, $207 of private spending, meaning coming from a private insurer, and $629 of out of
746240	749320	pocket spending, meaning the person themselves has to pay for it.
749320	756280	Compare that to American numbers, $4,993 and $1,122 out of pocket dollars, which are both
756280	759820	much higher, but at least proportional to the OECD average.
759820	763320	But Americans also spend $4,092 on private spending.
763320	767080	That's both directly and proportionally much higher, and we've already gone over the data
767080	771160	earlier showing healthcare quality to be about on par, so Americans aren't really getting
771160	772440	a good bang for their buck.
772440	776640	That extra $4,000 in private spending, that's money going to private health insurance companies.
776640	781760	In another study, aptly named Healthcare Administrative Costs in the United States and Canada, 2017,
781760	785220	it's found that the American system is more inefficient than the Canadian one, despite
785220	789060	the gross inefficiencies of the Canadian one, and I know them well, specifically because
789060	793180	the deregulated nature of the American system has allowed private insurance companies to
793180	796940	create a gigantic bureaucratic apparatus that is incredibly inefficient and drives
796940	798060	costs way up.
798060	801720	In most markets, the hardcore libertarian types have a good point when they say that
801720	806300	deregulation promotes competition, and competition will force businesses to trim the fat in order
806300	807300	to stay competitive.
807300	810100	But in the healthcare market, the opposite has actually happened.
810100	813540	Due to the unique nature of healthcare, which we went over earlier, the inelastic demand,
813540	818360	the lack of knowledge, etc., excessive deregulation actually leads to more market inefficiency.
818360	822500	In healthcare, once regulation puts a hard cap on the profit motive, the business model
822500	826580	naturally shifts to reducing costs, which can be bad depending on how it's done, and
826580	831860	broadening market access, which is not only a positive, but the exact goal of the regulation.
831860	835380	Looking over everything I've presented here today, it seems like while the possibility
835380	839960	for disaster certainly exists, as right-leaning people like to point out, it is also entirely
839960	844180	possible for there to be a universal healthcare service that avoids the inefficiencies inherent
844180	848080	to central planning, avoids the tendency of government to destroy competition through
848080	852080	nationalization, still provide quality service, still allow for innovation, and broaden access
852160	854160	to the service while reducing costs.
854160	858520	I would however warn left-leaning people that this is not due to the failure of markets
858520	862760	themselves, nor is it a structural problem inherent to liberal capitalism, but rather
862760	865520	it is due to the unique nature of the healthcare market.
865520	868660	This could not be replicated with the food market or the property market, for example.
868660	870080	They are all different animals.
870080	873520	But if you're dumb enough to just call it all capitalism and think it's all bad, you
873520	875280	probably don't get that.
875280	878080	The thing is, the libertarians of old understood this too.
878080	882760	No, I don't mean that common commie talking point of OMG, libertarian used to mean socialist
882760	883760	but they stole it from us.
883760	886000	That's just a bunch of crying coke, frankly.
886000	888880	Frederick Hayek is considered a libertarian before his time.
888880	892640	He called himself a classical liberal, and in his 1943 book, The Road to Serfdom, he
892640	896400	wrote extensively about what is now known to be the libertarian argument for a universal
896400	900640	healthcare service, where, as in the case of sickness and accident, neither the desire
900640	905040	to avoid such calamities nor the efforts to overcome their consequences are as a rule
905040	910720	weakened by the provision of assistance, where, in short, we deal with genuinely insurable
910720	911720	risks.
911720	915000	The case for the states helping to organize a comprehensive system of social insurance
915000	916000	is very strong.
916000	920200	There is no incompatibility in principle between the states providing greater security in this
920200	922240	way and the preservation of individual freedom.
922240	926400	To the same category belongs also the increase of security through the states rendering assistance
926400	929800	to the victims of such acts of God as earthquakes and floods.
929800	933480	Wherever communal action can mitigate disasters against which the individual can neither attempt
933480	937280	to guard himself nor make provision for the consequences, such communal action should
937280	939040	undoubtedly be taken.
939040	943720	Unlike the frankly crazier libertarians and anarcho-capitalists who came later, Hayek
943720	945960	was not interested in stateless societies.
945960	948960	He recognized the necessity of the state, but he also recognized the necessity that
948960	950880	its power be checked and restricted.
950880	954960	After Hayek had abandoned his native Austria for the UK and refused to return due to it
954960	958960	being brought under the control of Nazi Germany, he wrote The Road to Serfdom to specifically
958960	964260	be a rebuttal to both fascism and communism from not only a moral but economic perspective.
964260	968520	His position, a position I think is true, is that loss of individual liberties occurs
968520	972560	when the government controls economic decision-making through the type of central planning necessary
972560	976720	to implement a command economy, something that fascist Italy, Nazi Germany, and Soviet
976720	978000	Russia all did.
978000	982220	Hayek also argued that the abandonment of classical liberalism in favor of these planist
982220	985800	ideologies would create oppressive societies, and he was right.
985800	990440	And despite this, he still viewed a universal healthcare service not as a component of planism,
990440	994800	not as a backslide into these totalitarian, authoritarian ideologies, but rather as a
994800	997060	method to maximize personal liberty.
997060	1000240	And from a layman's perspective, it's not hard to intuit how this is true.
1000240	1004020	It's not only that we have an ethical injunction to help the sick, it's that if a person can
1004020	1008540	return to contributing to society after being cared for, he more than makes up his burden.
1008540	1011160	It's both a moral and a material argument.
1011160	1016120	One of Hayek's most famous quotes is regulation for competition, the meaning being that government
1016120	1020080	should regulate a market if that promotes competition, and should deregulate if that
1020080	1021080	promotes competition.
1021080	1024960	It's not a dogmatic stance of deregulate everything or nationalize everything, but
1024960	1028440	rather an understanding of the practical reality that not every market is the same, and that
1028440	1030880	state action is not universally evil.
1030880	1033560	By the way, despite all of this, healthcare still isn't a right.
1033560	1036080	You still don't get to compel labor out of others.
1036080	1039340	You still don't get to take from them and not provide compensation for the taking.
1039380	1043360	But understanding that fact and operating within that knowledge, a universal healthcare
1043360	1045180	service is still a good idea.
1045180	1048860	It's still a privilege that wealthy nations should afford to their citizens, if they have
1048860	1050020	the money to do so.
1050020	1053160	And thinking so is not exclusively a socialist position.
1053160	1057020	There is a strong capitalist argument for universal healthcare, and frankly it's a
1057020	1059820	bit strange to see that America hasn't figured it out yet.
1059820	1062640	Alright guys, that about does it for me, thank you very much for watching.
1062640	1067340	I have a feeling that this video will be controversial among my audience, but just remember, if I've
1067340	1069180	offended you, I'm right.
1069180	1072980	As always, streaming tonight on the gaming channel, twitch.tv slash game boomers, make
1072980	1073980	sure you drop by.
1073980	1075220	I'll see you there.
1075220	1076580	Have a good one, I love you.
