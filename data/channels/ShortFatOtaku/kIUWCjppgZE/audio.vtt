00:00.000 --> 00:09.060
I once made a video titled, health care is not a human right.

00:09.060 --> 00:12.480
And despite the title of today's video, I'm completely correct, health care isn't

00:12.480 --> 00:13.480
a right.

00:13.480 --> 00:16.960
Health care is the labour of other people, and you don't have a right to anybody else's

00:16.960 --> 00:17.960
labour.

00:17.960 --> 00:20.400
You might trade something for it, or maybe they'll give it to you willingly, but if

00:20.400 --> 00:25.060
you had a right to it, that means you compel it out of them even if they don't get compensated

00:25.060 --> 00:26.060
for it.

00:26.060 --> 00:29.960
Nobody has the right to expropriate the labour of others, and so, nobody has the right to

00:29.960 --> 00:30.960
health care.

00:30.960 --> 00:33.640
But that was more of a political philosophy video.

00:33.640 --> 00:36.800
This video isn't about rights, instead it's a practical discussion.

00:36.800 --> 00:41.620
Classical liberals, social liberals, conservatives and libertarians all consider free or highly

00:41.620 --> 00:46.740
open competitive markets to be the best way to efficiently distribute resources in society.

00:46.740 --> 00:47.740
And they're correct!

00:47.740 --> 00:51.980
But unlike most other goods and services, health care has some unique facets that result

00:51.980 --> 00:55.840
in a highly competitive market not actually creating the best health care system through

00:55.840 --> 00:57.200
those competitive forces.

00:57.200 --> 01:00.580
The nature of the health care market means that, unlike a lot of other markets, a purely

01:00.580 --> 01:04.120
deregulated no-government version of it is not functional.

01:04.120 --> 01:07.720
Let's begin by describing an economic concept called a perfect competition.

01:07.720 --> 01:11.620
According to Investopedia, perfect competition is a theoretical market structure where the

01:11.620 --> 01:13.320
following criteria are met.

01:13.320 --> 01:17.280
All firms sell an identical product, meaning there's no difference in what's being sold

01:17.280 --> 01:18.320
or in its quality.

01:18.320 --> 01:22.560
All firms are price takers, meaning that any one individual seller is small enough that

01:22.560 --> 01:26.180
they can't unilaterally influence the market price of their product.

01:26.180 --> 01:30.260
Its share has no influence on prices, meaning that the market is so competitive that even

01:30.260 --> 01:33.740
larger sellers can't adjust their prices without suffering a loss.

01:33.740 --> 01:37.700
Buyers have complete information about the product being sold and the prices being charged,

01:37.700 --> 01:40.660
meaning that everybody buying the product knows exactly what they're buying and what

01:40.660 --> 01:44.140
it should cost, so it's impossible for sellers to pull a fast one.

01:44.140 --> 01:47.420
Capital resources and labour are perfectly mobile, meaning that capital and labour can

01:47.420 --> 01:49.300
move within the market without incurring a cost.

01:49.300 --> 01:53.140
And firms can enter and exit the market without cost, pretty self-explanatory.

01:53.140 --> 01:57.540
Some other definitions of perfect competition include points like no externalities, meaning

01:57.540 --> 02:01.740
that costs and benefits of an activity don't affect some uninvolved third party.

02:01.740 --> 02:05.740
Or all buyers are rational, meaning that every single choice people make in this market increases

02:05.740 --> 02:06.740
their standing.

02:06.740 --> 02:10.740
And a whole bunch of others, but frankly, all of these points overlap in a lot of ways,

02:10.740 --> 02:13.900
and can be boiled down to four easy-to-understand factors.

02:13.900 --> 02:14.900
1.

02:14.900 --> 02:15.900
All the products are homogenous.

02:15.900 --> 02:16.900
2.

02:16.900 --> 02:17.900
All actors are price takers.

02:17.900 --> 02:18.900
3.

02:18.900 --> 02:20.060
All actors have perfect knowledge.

02:20.060 --> 02:21.060
And 4.

02:21.060 --> 02:22.940
All actor has an entry or exit cost.

02:22.940 --> 02:27.740
I should make it clear at this point that perfect competition does not and cannot actually

02:27.740 --> 02:29.120
exist in the real world.

02:29.120 --> 02:33.580
There is no market that, if left to its own devices, would naturally read a state of perfect

02:33.580 --> 02:34.580
competition.

02:34.580 --> 02:39.300
Rather, the idea is that various markets, if left to their own devices, will reach various

02:39.300 --> 02:41.420
places on a spectrum of competition.

02:41.420 --> 02:46.300
The closer any given market's natural spot on that spectrum is to perfect competition,

02:46.300 --> 02:50.040
the less that outside regulation will be required to keep the market intact.

02:50.040 --> 02:53.400
The further away from perfect competition on the spectrum, the more regulation will

02:53.400 --> 02:54.400
be required.

02:54.400 --> 02:58.520
Over-regulating a market relative to its level of natural competition generally leads to

02:58.520 --> 03:00.940
excess economic drag that destroys the market.

03:00.940 --> 03:04.920
In other words, taxes and regulations make everything cost too much, while under-regulating

03:04.920 --> 03:07.120
a market generally leads to a market failure.

03:07.120 --> 03:10.600
In other words, there's no instance where supply and demand match up so nothing gets

03:10.600 --> 03:11.600
sold.

03:11.600 --> 03:13.920
So, with all of this in mind, let's consider the healthcare market.

03:13.920 --> 03:16.880
Using these four points, how close is it to perfect competition?

03:16.880 --> 03:19.000
Well, one, are the products homogenous?

03:19.000 --> 03:21.720
As in, are healthcare products indistinguishable from one another?

03:21.720 --> 03:23.000
The answer is obviously no.

03:23.000 --> 03:24.680
Every health problem has a different solution.

03:24.680 --> 03:26.600
There's not one cure for everything.

03:26.600 --> 03:30.360
Even within the realm of one disease, there may also be multiple treatments.

03:30.360 --> 03:33.440
Additionally, healthcare is constantly changing, with new medicines, new surgeries, and new

03:33.440 --> 03:35.280
forms of therapy appearing constantly.

03:35.280 --> 03:39.480
Not only that, but individual actors often perceive healthcare in a specific, particular

03:39.480 --> 03:40.480
manner.

03:40.480 --> 03:43.520
People may prefer some brands or types of medicine over others, even if there's no

03:43.520 --> 03:44.840
practical difference.

03:44.840 --> 03:48.200
People will prefer their own familiar family doctor over somebody new.

03:48.200 --> 03:51.720
People often visit the same pharmacy to get their drugs, even if another would do just

03:51.720 --> 03:52.720
as well.

03:52.720 --> 03:56.680
Even in instances where products might be homogenous, the intimate nature of healthcare

03:56.680 --> 03:58.560
leads people to treat them as if they're not.

03:58.560 --> 04:01.320
How about point two, are all actors price takers?

04:01.320 --> 04:05.340
As in, no individual actor can affect prices, meaning buyers can't bargain any lower and

04:05.340 --> 04:08.680
sellers can't bargain any higher because price equilibrium has already been reached.

04:08.680 --> 04:10.500
Again, the answer is obviously no.

04:10.500 --> 04:13.160
Healthcare providers have a lot of influence to set prices in the market.

04:13.160 --> 04:15.040
There's a number of reasons for why this is the case.

04:15.040 --> 04:18.400
One is the inelastic demand for healthcare, meaning that the buyers of healthcare don't

04:18.400 --> 04:21.280
see their demand drop off as supply or price changes.

04:21.280 --> 04:22.280
Here's an example.

04:22.280 --> 04:23.480
Assume you have a cure for cancer.

04:23.480 --> 04:27.640
If you have cancer and the price for the cure is $1,000, you'll want to stay alive so you'll

04:27.640 --> 04:28.840
pay the $1,000.

04:28.840 --> 04:33.160
If the price is now $10,000, your desire to stay alive hasn't gone down, you'll still

04:33.160 --> 04:34.200
pay that price.

04:34.200 --> 04:38.240
For most people, if it means staying alive, the healthcare market can charge them everything

04:38.240 --> 04:41.160
they have to be cured, because what are they going to do, not get cured?

04:41.160 --> 04:45.360
So the demand for the cure is inelastic, meaning that the normal supply demand curve doesn't

04:45.360 --> 04:48.560
really apply because there's no upper limit on what you might pay.

04:48.560 --> 04:50.560
Of course, for some people, this just isn't the case.

04:50.560 --> 04:54.840
A 90-year-old might not want to destroy his savings and leave his family with nothing

04:54.840 --> 04:58.120
in order to cure some disease if he's just going to die of something else a little bit

04:58.120 --> 04:59.120
later anyway.

04:59.120 --> 05:02.480
This is the don't destroy your economy for the sake of grandma because of COVID argument

05:02.480 --> 05:03.480
and it's a good one.

05:03.480 --> 05:07.620
But for most regular people, the demand for healthcare is pretty inelastic.

05:07.620 --> 05:08.620
Now you might object here.

05:08.620 --> 05:12.140
You might say, well, if somebody wanted to charge me too much for a cure, I'd shop

05:12.140 --> 05:13.380
around for a lower price.

05:13.380 --> 05:14.920
And that might work to a limited extent.

05:14.920 --> 05:18.900
But that leads to the second reason as to why some actors are price takers and some

05:18.900 --> 05:19.900
aren't.

05:19.900 --> 05:22.900
There's an extremely limited supply of healthcare options in any given area.

05:22.900 --> 05:26.780
Most people can't just fly to a different location to get more specialized or competitive

05:26.780 --> 05:27.780
care.

05:27.780 --> 05:30.740
Most people are stuck with the one hospital in their town, the handful of doctors that

05:30.740 --> 05:34.740
are still hanging around, and if they're lucky, a trip to the nearest city to see a

05:34.740 --> 05:35.740
specialist.

05:35.740 --> 05:38.100
If you live in a city, you'll certainly have access to some more options, but it's

05:38.100 --> 05:41.260
still not going to be on the same level as something like having five grocery stores

05:41.260 --> 05:43.020
all within distance to buy your food at.

05:43.020 --> 05:44.900
The third reason is because of patents.

05:44.900 --> 05:45.900
Patents are good.

05:45.900 --> 05:49.000
They allow inventors and discoverers of new products to profit off their hard work and

05:49.000 --> 05:52.680
not just have it stolen from them, but they also severely restrict the supply of some

05:52.680 --> 05:53.680
products.

05:53.680 --> 05:54.980
Consider that cancer cure again.

05:54.980 --> 05:58.900
If one doctor discovers the cure for cancer and patents it, he ends up holding a monopoly

05:58.900 --> 06:00.740
and can charge whatever he wants for that cure.

06:00.740 --> 06:02.060
And on some level, good for him.

06:02.060 --> 06:05.860
He put in the work of discovering it and deserves to be rewarded disproportionately in comparison

06:05.860 --> 06:06.960
to those who didn't.

06:07.000 --> 06:11.160
But without competition, you still reach the same problem I described in my first point.

06:11.160 --> 06:14.380
Patents can exacerbate the negative effects of inelastic demand.

06:14.380 --> 06:17.840
And they're likely the reason why at least some price controls are necessary.

06:17.840 --> 06:20.140
Let's move on to the third quality of perfect markets.

06:20.140 --> 06:21.920
Do all actors have perfect knowledge?

06:21.920 --> 06:24.320
Again, for the third time, absolutely not.

06:24.320 --> 06:27.960
Healthcare providers have a huge information advantage compared to patients, giving them

06:27.960 --> 06:31.920
ample opportunity to obscure the actual market price of any good or service.

06:31.920 --> 06:35.640
I remember reading an article on a recent weekly sip a few weeks ago where a dentist

06:35.640 --> 06:40.600
took advantage of his low information customer base to perform a number of unnecessary fillings

06:40.600 --> 06:43.240
and root canals in order to line his pockets.

06:43.240 --> 06:46.400
The average person doesn't have enough knowledge to evaluate whether or not they're getting

06:46.400 --> 06:49.280
a good deal from their doctor or just being taken for a ride.

06:49.280 --> 06:52.920
The reason you should be getting second opinions on medical advice isn't only because your

06:52.920 --> 06:56.360
doctor might be shit, it's also because your doctor might be scamming you.

06:56.360 --> 06:58.880
And four, do actors have entry or exit costs?

06:58.880 --> 06:59.880
Yes, they do.

06:59.880 --> 07:03.280
Beyond simply the cost of starting up a business, the regulatory cost of starting a healthcare

07:03.280 --> 07:04.680
business specifically is quite high.

07:04.720 --> 07:06.440
And to be honest, I'm kind of okay with that.

07:06.440 --> 07:10.840
Yes, the ancaps are correct that a healthcare market with no regulations would remove entry

07:10.840 --> 07:12.920
costs and probably lead to lower prices.

07:12.920 --> 07:13.920
That's true.

07:13.920 --> 07:14.920
But you know what else we'd see?

07:14.920 --> 07:17.900
Remember this quack from red litter media fame who tried to sell this dumb roller device

07:17.900 --> 07:22.280
as a pain reliever so you could make an infomercial where he rolls it all over a naked lady?

07:22.280 --> 07:27.680
Yeah, this guy got absolutely fucked by healthcare-related lawsuits for selling such an obviously fraudulent

07:27.680 --> 07:28.680
device.

07:28.680 --> 07:32.740
Pre-regulation, the amount of snake oil being peddled by less than reputable individuals

07:32.740 --> 07:34.160
was way higher.

07:34.160 --> 07:37.640
If you want to be sold pills that do nothing and devices that don't work for an illness

07:37.640 --> 07:40.420
you don't actually have, deregulation is the way to go.

07:40.420 --> 07:45.300
But having an actually functional healthcare service requires some consumer protections,

07:45.300 --> 07:48.200
which means there needs to be some market entry costs.

07:48.200 --> 07:51.720
There are certainly ways we can reform the current regulations to reduce drag while not

07:51.720 --> 07:57.000
sacrificing quality, but the extremist position of no regulation just isn't tenable.

07:57.000 --> 08:00.080
There are some other libertarian objections to universal healthcare that are probably

08:00.080 --> 08:01.380
worth going over as well.

08:01.380 --> 08:05.900
People often rightfully object that centralized systems tend to become more inefficient and

08:05.900 --> 08:07.500
corrupt the larger they grow.

08:07.500 --> 08:08.500
This is true.

08:08.500 --> 08:11.000
This is often an argument against universal healthcare in America.

08:11.000 --> 08:14.540
That the federal government can't possibly manage a system that is large and centralized

08:14.540 --> 08:17.560
enough to account for all of America's citizens and locations.

08:17.560 --> 08:22.300
But the truth is, most other countries don't actually have that kind of centralized system.

08:22.300 --> 08:26.520
The Nordic countries, Canada, the UK, and I think Japan as well, have devolved a lot

08:26.520 --> 08:29.540
of their healthcare operations to more local levels of government.

08:29.540 --> 08:33.300
Using the system I know best as an example, federal involvement in Canadian healthcare

08:33.300 --> 08:37.380
basically amounts to a legal requirement that the provincial government implement a universal

08:37.380 --> 08:38.940
health insurance plan.

08:38.940 --> 08:40.420
Everything else is left to the provinces.

08:40.420 --> 08:44.320
It's funny, if you ask your average American socialist the question, do you want Canadian

08:44.320 --> 08:47.060
style healthcare, they'll overwhelmingly say yes.

08:47.060 --> 08:51.100
But if you ask them the question, do you want each individual state government to manage

08:51.100 --> 08:55.360
their own healthcare service, they'll reject that option in favor of a universal standard.

08:55.360 --> 08:57.620
It's almost like they don't know what they're talking about.

08:57.620 --> 09:01.720
Just to clarify here, single payer healthcare refers to systems where hospitals and clinics

09:01.720 --> 09:05.840
are privately owned, where doctors can work for themselves or work for others, but the

09:05.840 --> 09:10.960
bill is paid for by the state's health insurance program, that's the single entity that pays.

09:10.960 --> 09:14.620
While multi payer refers to systems that have a number of different insurance programs,

09:14.620 --> 09:17.420
both private and state run, that cover the cost.

09:17.420 --> 09:21.260
These two schemes contrast with systems where there is little to no government involvement

09:21.260 --> 09:25.140
in healthcare, like how the US is often portrayed, and systems where the government not only

09:25.140 --> 09:29.360
pays for healthcare, but owns all of the infrastructure that provides it, and employs

09:29.360 --> 09:33.460
all of the doctors directly as state employees as well, like in China.

09:33.460 --> 09:37.620
It does turn out that the Canadian style decentralized single payer system is pretty efficient though.

09:37.620 --> 09:41.300
I know the World Health Organization is quite shitty nowadays, but it wasn't always so,

09:41.300 --> 09:45.740
and back in 2000 they put out a study on the efficiency of the healthcare systems in 190

09:45.740 --> 09:49.940
odd nations, and those decentralized single payer countries ranked pretty well.

09:49.940 --> 09:55.060
However the top spots were held by decentralized multi payer countries, like France and Italy.

09:55.060 --> 09:58.820
There's a wealth of data from the OECD as well, comparing the healthcare for multiple

09:58.820 --> 10:03.260
different nations, and on average, countries with some form of universal healthcare system

10:03.260 --> 10:06.220
are able to match or exceed America on pretty much everything.

10:06.220 --> 10:09.880
Another libertarian criticism is that the less regulated, more profit driven system

10:09.880 --> 10:13.140
of the United States gives them an advantage when it comes to research and development

10:13.140 --> 10:14.780
of new drugs and practices.

10:14.780 --> 10:18.780
A more profit driven system can lead to more innovation, and healthcare is no exception,

10:18.780 --> 10:22.140
but I'm not sure how much of that is actually a contributing factor here.

10:22.140 --> 10:25.920
America does produce a lot of innovation, don't get me wrong, but a 2010 study in the

10:25.920 --> 10:29.900
American Journal of Public Health found that while America does produce a huge amount of

10:29.900 --> 10:33.940
innovation in healthcare, it's proportional to America's GDP and the amount of money

10:33.940 --> 10:35.540
America spends on healthcare.

10:35.540 --> 10:39.540
The same study also notes that countries with more regulations still produce as much innovation

10:39.540 --> 10:43.620
proportionally, so the fear that America might lose its competitive edge if it adopts a single

10:43.620 --> 10:47.900
payer system may be unfounded, even if that precludes the option for private investment.

10:47.900 --> 10:50.020
There's a couple reasons for this.

10:50.020 --> 10:53.840
One is that insofar as drugs are concerned, even countries with the best universal healthcare

10:53.840 --> 10:55.920
schemes generally don't cover drugs.

10:55.920 --> 10:59.740
This makes sense to me because a healthcare service is something that you use only occasionally,

10:59.740 --> 11:03.560
so setting it up to be a communal pot to cover that occasional use, like how you'd fund

11:03.560 --> 11:08.400
a firefighting service, seems reasonable, while drugs are goods that are owned privately

11:08.400 --> 11:11.700
and used exclusively, so it makes a lot more sense that you should have to buy them.

11:11.700 --> 11:15.220
So all that being said, the pharmaceutical industry is likely to remain private, and

11:15.220 --> 11:18.180
the benefits of a private system will still apply, including innovation.

11:18.180 --> 11:21.740
Meanwhile in the medical side of the system, there's not much reason to believe that

11:21.740 --> 11:25.560
a single payer option will lead to some kind of innovative stagnation.

11:25.560 --> 11:29.500
Consider the American military and American spaceflight, two domains where, despite there

11:29.500 --> 11:33.960
being a single payer system, in that only the American government is selling contracts

11:33.960 --> 11:37.780
for these services in the US, there are multiple private companies competing against each other

11:37.780 --> 11:39.100
to fulfill the contracts.

11:39.100 --> 11:44.100
The innovation stagnation argument is a lot stronger when it comes to the outright nationalization

11:44.100 --> 11:45.140
of a business.

11:45.140 --> 11:48.620
Not so much when private businesses continue to compete, and the government just so happens

11:48.620 --> 11:49.780
to be the customer.

11:49.780 --> 11:53.260
Another common criticism is efficiency of cost, which is different than the efficiency

11:53.260 --> 11:55.060
of service discussion we had earlier.

11:55.060 --> 11:59.640
And on this point, there is no argument, we've all seen those ridiculous bills that go viral

11:59.640 --> 12:03.040
on social media, where people end up paying tens of thousands of dollars just to have

12:03.040 --> 12:04.860
a kid at a hospital in the States.

12:04.860 --> 12:06.300
It's rather crazy to be honest.

12:06.300 --> 12:10.260
Here's some more data from the OECD, and it shouldn't surprise anybody just how much more

12:10.260 --> 12:13.640
Americans spend on healthcare, but take a closer look at the numbers breakdown.

12:13.640 --> 12:19.960
The OECD average shows, per person, $3,038 of public spending, meaning coming from government

12:19.960 --> 12:26.240
taxes, $207 of private spending, meaning coming from a private insurer, and $629 of out of

12:26.240 --> 12:29.320
pocket spending, meaning the person themselves has to pay for it.

12:29.320 --> 12:36.280
Compare that to American numbers, $4,993 and $1,122 out of pocket dollars, which are both

12:36.280 --> 12:39.820
much higher, but at least proportional to the OECD average.

12:39.820 --> 12:43.320
But Americans also spend $4,092 on private spending.

12:43.320 --> 12:47.080
That's both directly and proportionally much higher, and we've already gone over the data

12:47.080 --> 12:51.160
earlier showing healthcare quality to be about on par, so Americans aren't really getting

12:51.160 --> 12:52.440
a good bang for their buck.

12:52.440 --> 12:56.640
That extra $4,000 in private spending, that's money going to private health insurance companies.

12:56.640 --> 13:01.760
In another study, aptly named Healthcare Administrative Costs in the United States and Canada, 2017,

13:01.760 --> 13:05.220
it's found that the American system is more inefficient than the Canadian one, despite

13:05.220 --> 13:09.060
the gross inefficiencies of the Canadian one, and I know them well, specifically because

13:09.060 --> 13:13.180
the deregulated nature of the American system has allowed private insurance companies to

13:13.180 --> 13:16.940
create a gigantic bureaucratic apparatus that is incredibly inefficient and drives

13:16.940 --> 13:18.060
costs way up.

13:18.060 --> 13:21.720
In most markets, the hardcore libertarian types have a good point when they say that

13:21.720 --> 13:26.300
deregulation promotes competition, and competition will force businesses to trim the fat in order

13:26.300 --> 13:27.300
to stay competitive.

13:27.300 --> 13:30.100
But in the healthcare market, the opposite has actually happened.

13:30.100 --> 13:33.540
Due to the unique nature of healthcare, which we went over earlier, the inelastic demand,

13:33.540 --> 13:38.360
the lack of knowledge, etc., excessive deregulation actually leads to more market inefficiency.

13:38.360 --> 13:42.500
In healthcare, once regulation puts a hard cap on the profit motive, the business model

13:42.500 --> 13:46.580
naturally shifts to reducing costs, which can be bad depending on how it's done, and

13:46.580 --> 13:51.860
broadening market access, which is not only a positive, but the exact goal of the regulation.

13:51.860 --> 13:55.380
Looking over everything I've presented here today, it seems like while the possibility

13:55.380 --> 13:59.960
for disaster certainly exists, as right-leaning people like to point out, it is also entirely

13:59.960 --> 14:04.180
possible for there to be a universal healthcare service that avoids the inefficiencies inherent

14:04.180 --> 14:08.080
to central planning, avoids the tendency of government to destroy competition through

14:08.080 --> 14:12.080
nationalization, still provide quality service, still allow for innovation, and broaden access

14:12.160 --> 14:14.160
to the service while reducing costs.

14:14.160 --> 14:18.520
I would however warn left-leaning people that this is not due to the failure of markets

14:18.520 --> 14:22.760
themselves, nor is it a structural problem inherent to liberal capitalism, but rather

14:22.760 --> 14:25.520
it is due to the unique nature of the healthcare market.

14:25.520 --> 14:28.660
This could not be replicated with the food market or the property market, for example.

14:28.660 --> 14:30.080
They are all different animals.

14:30.080 --> 14:33.520
But if you're dumb enough to just call it all capitalism and think it's all bad, you

14:33.520 --> 14:35.280
probably don't get that.

14:35.280 --> 14:38.080
The thing is, the libertarians of old understood this too.

14:38.080 --> 14:42.760
No, I don't mean that common commie talking point of OMG, libertarian used to mean socialist

14:42.760 --> 14:43.760
but they stole it from us.

14:43.760 --> 14:46.000
That's just a bunch of crying coke, frankly.

14:46.000 --> 14:48.880
Frederick Hayek is considered a libertarian before his time.

14:48.880 --> 14:52.640
He called himself a classical liberal, and in his 1943 book, The Road to Serfdom, he

14:52.640 --> 14:56.400
wrote extensively about what is now known to be the libertarian argument for a universal

14:56.400 --> 15:00.640
healthcare service, where, as in the case of sickness and accident, neither the desire

15:00.640 --> 15:05.040
to avoid such calamities nor the efforts to overcome their consequences are as a rule

15:05.040 --> 15:10.720
weakened by the provision of assistance, where, in short, we deal with genuinely insurable

15:10.720 --> 15:11.720
risks.

15:11.720 --> 15:15.000
The case for the states helping to organize a comprehensive system of social insurance

15:15.000 --> 15:16.000
is very strong.

15:16.000 --> 15:20.200
There is no incompatibility in principle between the states providing greater security in this

15:20.200 --> 15:22.240
way and the preservation of individual freedom.

15:22.240 --> 15:26.400
To the same category belongs also the increase of security through the states rendering assistance

15:26.400 --> 15:29.800
to the victims of such acts of God as earthquakes and floods.

15:29.800 --> 15:33.480
Wherever communal action can mitigate disasters against which the individual can neither attempt

15:33.480 --> 15:37.280
to guard himself nor make provision for the consequences, such communal action should

15:37.280 --> 15:39.040
undoubtedly be taken.

15:39.040 --> 15:43.720
Unlike the frankly crazier libertarians and anarcho-capitalists who came later, Hayek

15:43.720 --> 15:45.960
was not interested in stateless societies.

15:45.960 --> 15:48.960
He recognized the necessity of the state, but he also recognized the necessity that

15:48.960 --> 15:50.880
its power be checked and restricted.

15:50.880 --> 15:54.960
After Hayek had abandoned his native Austria for the UK and refused to return due to it

15:54.960 --> 15:58.960
being brought under the control of Nazi Germany, he wrote The Road to Serfdom to specifically

15:58.960 --> 16:04.260
be a rebuttal to both fascism and communism from not only a moral but economic perspective.

16:04.260 --> 16:08.520
His position, a position I think is true, is that loss of individual liberties occurs

16:08.520 --> 16:12.560
when the government controls economic decision-making through the type of central planning necessary

16:12.560 --> 16:16.720
to implement a command economy, something that fascist Italy, Nazi Germany, and Soviet

16:16.720 --> 16:18.000
Russia all did.

16:18.000 --> 16:22.220
Hayek also argued that the abandonment of classical liberalism in favor of these planist

16:22.220 --> 16:25.800
ideologies would create oppressive societies, and he was right.

16:25.800 --> 16:30.440
And despite this, he still viewed a universal healthcare service not as a component of planism,

16:30.440 --> 16:34.800
not as a backslide into these totalitarian, authoritarian ideologies, but rather as a

16:34.800 --> 16:37.060
method to maximize personal liberty.

16:37.060 --> 16:40.240
And from a layman's perspective, it's not hard to intuit how this is true.

16:40.240 --> 16:44.020
It's not only that we have an ethical injunction to help the sick, it's that if a person can

16:44.020 --> 16:48.540
return to contributing to society after being cared for, he more than makes up his burden.

16:48.540 --> 16:51.160
It's both a moral and a material argument.

16:51.160 --> 16:56.120
One of Hayek's most famous quotes is regulation for competition, the meaning being that government

16:56.120 --> 17:00.080
should regulate a market if that promotes competition, and should deregulate if that

17:00.080 --> 17:01.080
promotes competition.

17:01.080 --> 17:04.960
It's not a dogmatic stance of deregulate everything or nationalize everything, but

17:04.960 --> 17:08.440
rather an understanding of the practical reality that not every market is the same, and that

17:08.440 --> 17:10.880
state action is not universally evil.

17:10.880 --> 17:13.560
By the way, despite all of this, healthcare still isn't a right.

17:13.560 --> 17:16.080
You still don't get to compel labor out of others.

17:16.080 --> 17:19.340
You still don't get to take from them and not provide compensation for the taking.

17:19.380 --> 17:23.360
But understanding that fact and operating within that knowledge, a universal healthcare

17:23.360 --> 17:25.180
service is still a good idea.

17:25.180 --> 17:28.860
It's still a privilege that wealthy nations should afford to their citizens, if they have

17:28.860 --> 17:30.020
the money to do so.

17:30.020 --> 17:33.160
And thinking so is not exclusively a socialist position.

17:33.160 --> 17:37.020
There is a strong capitalist argument for universal healthcare, and frankly it's a

17:37.020 --> 17:39.820
bit strange to see that America hasn't figured it out yet.

17:39.820 --> 17:42.640
Alright guys, that about does it for me, thank you very much for watching.

17:42.640 --> 17:47.340
I have a feeling that this video will be controversial among my audience, but just remember, if I've

17:47.340 --> 17:49.180
offended you, I'm right.

17:49.180 --> 17:52.980
As always, streaming tonight on the gaming channel, twitch.tv slash game boomers, make

17:52.980 --> 17:53.980
sure you drop by.

17:53.980 --> 17:55.220
I'll see you there.

17:55.220 --> 17:56.580
Have a good one, I love you.
