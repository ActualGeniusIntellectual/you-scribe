No video today, sorry, I know, I just came back, but I haven't been doing nothing.

00:06.080 --> 00:12.740
This is a quick announcement that the Minecraft server has been updated to 1.16.5, and I guess

00:12.740 --> 00:18.120
a reminder that yes, I do run a community SFO Minecraft server.

00:18.120 --> 00:22.380
When you give money to this channel, whether that's through Patreon, Subscribestar, through

00:22.380 --> 00:27.640
YouTube memberships, Twitch subs, or just watching with the ad block off, that is one

00:27.640 --> 00:29.880
of the projects that your money goes towards.

00:29.880 --> 00:34.580
Of course, you don't have to donate to play on the server, but there are some perks if

00:34.580 --> 00:35.580
you do.

00:35.580 --> 00:39.480
And rather than do a video or a stream today, that's what I'm spending most of my day doing,

00:39.480 --> 00:42.660
is updating the Minecraft server and making sure it runs smoothly.

00:42.660 --> 00:45.340
Also I made a really big pot of stew, but yeah, the Minecraft server.

00:45.340 --> 00:49.740
The IP is in the description, and as soon as I can afford to get my gaming rig back

00:49.740 --> 00:53.460
up and running, I'm going to start hosting community events on it now that I'm back.

00:53.460 --> 00:57.120
So if any of that interests you, please drop by and check it out.

00:57.120 --> 00:59.080
Alright guys, I'll see you tomorrow, I love you.

00:59.880 --> 01:01.880
Thanks for watching, and I'll see you in the next one.
