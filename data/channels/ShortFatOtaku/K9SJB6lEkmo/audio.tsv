0	6080	No video today, sorry, I know, I just came back, but I haven't been doing nothing.
6080	12740	This is a quick announcement that the Minecraft server has been updated to 1.16.5, and I guess
12740	18120	a reminder that yes, I do run a community SFO Minecraft server.
18120	22380	When you give money to this channel, whether that's through Patreon, Subscribestar, through
22380	27640	YouTube memberships, Twitch subs, or just watching with the ad block off, that is one
27640	29880	of the projects that your money goes towards.
29880	34580	Of course, you don't have to donate to play on the server, but there are some perks if
34580	35580	you do.
35580	39480	And rather than do a video or a stream today, that's what I'm spending most of my day doing,
39480	42660	is updating the Minecraft server and making sure it runs smoothly.
42660	45340	Also I made a really big pot of stew, but yeah, the Minecraft server.
45340	49740	The IP is in the description, and as soon as I can afford to get my gaming rig back
49740	53460	up and running, I'm going to start hosting community events on it now that I'm back.
53460	57120	So if any of that interests you, please drop by and check it out.
57120	59080	Alright guys, I'll see you tomorrow, I love you.
59880	61880	Thanks for watching, and I'll see you in the next one.
