00:00.000 --> 00:03.500
I've got to tell you, I've never had my own Netflix account, never saw the point of it, frankly.

00:03.500 --> 00:08.700
Girlfriends, roommates, family members, they always had their own account that I inevitably got the password for eventually.

00:08.700 --> 00:11.200
So if I ever wanted to use the service, I always had access to it.

00:11.200 --> 00:15.400
But I can count the number of times that I've opened up Netflix for my own purposes on one hand.

00:15.400 --> 00:18.600
Sometimes Naomi might want to watch something on it and sometimes I might join her.

00:18.600 --> 00:25.700
But if it's just me by myself, I rank Netflix down somewhere near cable TV as something that I want to actually spend my spare time on.

00:25.700 --> 00:32.600
That's not to say that Netflix doesn't have good content on it or at least had good content on it at one point, considering how much stuff has left the platform over the years.

00:32.600 --> 00:36.700
But even now, do you want to watch Seinfeld, Friends, Star Trek, The Next Generation?

00:36.700 --> 00:41.300
Disregarding Netflix originals for now, the Netflix backlog is still formidable even nowadays.

00:41.300 --> 00:49.200
And I guess the idea of that backlog is always what Netflix seemed to be about for me as a millennial and also why I never cared about the service.

00:49.200 --> 00:57.800
I grew up in an era of the internet that is pre-video streaming, where if you wanted episodes of an anime or a TV show, you would download it on a file-sharing program

00:57.800 --> 01:05.800
and hope that you didn't accidentally click on Dragonball Z Episode 10.mp4.exe with a file size of 212 kilobytes.

01:05.800 --> 01:12.000
The episodes that you did get would have a resolution of about 100 pixels across and the audio sounded like it was recorded in a cymbal factory.

01:12.000 --> 01:13.000
But hey, it was free.

01:13.000 --> 01:15.700
And before Pornhub, this is how people shared porn too.

01:15.700 --> 01:20.000
Though those files were a lot more likely to contain viruses or have some really weird shit on them.

01:20.000 --> 01:24.900
Anybody else remember downloading an X-rated video when you discovered that it was a relabeled Faces of Death video?

01:24.900 --> 01:27.900
Yeah, thanks anonymous internet troll from 20 years ago.

01:27.900 --> 01:34.200
However, it's not like video content was relegated to file-sharing and later BitTorrent because people didn't know what streaming was.

01:34.200 --> 01:36.100
It was actually because of a lack of tech.

01:36.100 --> 01:40.700
The concept of streaming media was actually invented in 1881, no joke.

01:40.700 --> 01:47.900
The French company Theaterphone saw the possibilities of merging primitive recording and playback technologies with the then new telephone

01:47.900 --> 01:53.400
to provide a service where operas and stage productions could be transmitted over the phone to people who couldn't be there physically.

01:53.400 --> 01:59.200
By 1890, the tech was adapted to create the telephone newspaper where you could listen to the news of the day over the phone.

01:59.200 --> 02:04.400
By 1920, the tech was adapted again to create Muzak by the company literally called Muzak

02:04.400 --> 02:09.400
to provide generic background music for grocery stores and elevators, again transmitted over telephone.

02:09.400 --> 02:15.800
The creator of Muzak, George Squire, dubbed his technology and its ancestors, Theaterphone and telephone newspaper,

02:15.800 --> 02:22.000
continuous streaming to contrast it with the then significantly more expensive and temperamental radio technology.

02:22.000 --> 02:26.400
Radio was wireless and omnidirectional, allowing anybody with the proper equipment to tune in,

02:26.400 --> 02:30.000
but back then that equipment was very expensive and not likely to work.

02:30.000 --> 02:34.900
Meanwhile, streaming was more reliable and higher quality, but it required a physical hookup to the network.

02:34.900 --> 02:42.500
Eventually, as radio tech became more commercially viable, the concept of directly streaming media to the end user mostly died off in the 1930s,

02:42.500 --> 02:48.900
with the exception of a live jukebox service in Philadelphia that was controlled remotely by an operator in the 60s and 70s,

02:48.900 --> 02:52.400
and also except for Muzak. That's still going strong today, and where will we be without it?

02:52.400 --> 02:58.300
The point I'm making is, the idea of having content stored in one location and then streamed to users in another location,

02:58.300 --> 03:03.500
rather than having to have the content at the user's location, is an idea that has been around for a very long time,

03:03.500 --> 03:08.100
but we just haven't had the technology to do it cheaply until YouTube, and even then YouTube still loses money,

03:08.100 --> 03:12.000
but that's nothing like the theoretical money pit that would have been a 1990s YouTube.

03:12.000 --> 03:16.900
YouTube showed the world that streaming could work with the modern internet tech, at least modern for 2006.

03:16.900 --> 03:22.100
The key word being could, because many a YouTube competitor have bit the dust or languished in obscurity,

03:22.100 --> 03:25.100
trying to do what YouTube does without the financial backing of Google.

03:25.100 --> 03:29.600
Some of you Zoomers might not know this, but Netflix didn't start as a video streaming service.

03:29.600 --> 03:36.800
It began as a mail-order DVD rental service instead in August of 1997, back before video streaming was technologically viable.

03:36.800 --> 03:43.500
The OGs of Netflix, Mark Randolph, Reed Hastings, and Patty McCord, were all in a carpool group together in Silicon Valley,

03:43.500 --> 03:47.900
working for a different company, where they spitballed the idea of a VHS mailing service.

03:47.900 --> 03:53.800
It turned out that videotapes were too fragile to be shipped through the mail, with all of their intricate parts and delicate magnetic tape,

03:53.800 --> 03:59.800
but DVDs, which had come out only a few months before, proved to be sturdy enough to survive a trip with the US Postal Service,

03:59.800 --> 04:03.800
after they actually mailed a test desk between Randolph and Hastings' houses.

04:03.800 --> 04:08.100
And so the gang decided to leave their jobs and start Netflix as a DVD rental service.

04:08.100 --> 04:13.600
And hey, if for some reason you still like physical media like that, you can still have Netflix ship DVDs to you.

04:13.600 --> 04:16.100
Here's what Netflix.com looked like back in the day.

04:16.100 --> 04:17.100
Wild, isn't it?

04:17.100 --> 04:21.400
They did the $4.99 per movie rental thing, same as the brick-and-mortar stores like Blockbuster Video,

04:21.400 --> 04:23.600
but eventually they transitioned to a subscription service.

04:23.600 --> 04:26.400
One monthly fee, pick your DVDs, they'll be shipped right to your door.

04:26.400 --> 04:29.900
Netflix famously asked Blockbuster to buy them out in the early days,

04:29.900 --> 04:33.600
but Blockbuster refused, with its CEO thinking that the internet was just a passing phase.

04:33.600 --> 04:36.600
That would basically be the final nail in the coffin for Blockbuster,

04:36.600 --> 04:40.600
as the brick-and-mortar video rental store model had significantly more overhead than Netflix.

04:40.600 --> 04:45.600
Blockbuster's final gasp was to spin up a service called Blockbuster Total Access,

04:45.600 --> 04:48.600
which was basically identical to Netflix's mail rental service.

04:48.600 --> 04:49.600
But it was too little too late.

04:49.600 --> 04:55.100
Blockbuster implemented this in 2007, the same year that Netflix transitioned away from that very same model

04:55.100 --> 04:56.600
and into the video streaming business.

04:56.600 --> 05:00.100
I don't think I need a segue into a boomer nostalgia rant about Blockbuster, do I?

05:00.100 --> 05:02.600
I'm sure YouTube is filled with people talking about Blockbuster memes,

05:02.600 --> 05:07.600
or how they spent their best Friday evenings of their lives looking for the ideal N64 game to rent, or something like that.

05:07.600 --> 05:08.600
You all know what's going on.

05:08.600 --> 05:12.100
Also, I guess I'd be remiss if I didn't point out Redbox.

05:12.100 --> 05:15.600
Redbox appeared to fill the void that Netflix and Blockbuster left behind.

05:15.600 --> 05:18.600
Rather than deal with mailing DVDs or brick-and-mortar stores,

05:18.600 --> 05:24.600
Redbox placed video rental vending machines in high-traffic locations, like malls and grocery stores.

05:24.600 --> 05:30.600
That, coupled with the ability to return a rental to any kiosk, not specifically the one that you rented it from, led to Redbox's success.

05:30.600 --> 05:36.600
Even now, in 2022, they're still limping along because the service is convenient for older people who don't know how to use new technology.

05:36.600 --> 05:40.100
That's basically what Netflix sold, and still sells too. Convenience.

05:40.100 --> 05:43.100
To somebody like me, turning on a BitTorrent program might be no problem,

05:43.100 --> 05:46.100
but for most people, convenience is something that they're willing to pay for.

05:46.100 --> 05:49.600
Netflix's rise would only continue after Blockbuster fell by the wayside.

05:49.600 --> 05:53.600
At this point in Netflix's story, the seventh console generation was swinging into gear.

05:53.600 --> 05:57.100
That's the PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Nintendo Wii era, by the way.

05:57.100 --> 05:59.100
And again, for those of you who don't remember,

05:59.100 --> 06:03.100
oh god, I'm old, this shit was happening when I was in university, how could time be so fleeting?

06:03.100 --> 06:10.100
This generation of video game console war saw companies duke it out not only over video games, but also over dominance of the living room.

06:10.100 --> 06:16.100
PlayStation 2, including a built-in DVD player, was what helped DVD become the dominant format of the 2000s.

06:16.100 --> 06:21.600
And Sony was hoping to replicate that success in the 2010s by including a Blu-ray disc player in the PS3.

06:21.600 --> 06:26.100
Meanwhile, the Xbox 360 supported the competing HD DVD format by Toshiba.

06:26.100 --> 06:31.600
But unlike the PS3, the 360 didn't actually have one built into it. You had to buy one of these things and plug it into your 360.

06:31.600 --> 06:36.100
Man, does anyone remember these things? You can get them nowadays as a paperweight for like three dollars.

06:36.100 --> 06:43.100
At the same time, Microsoft was also developing Silverlight, a framework for streaming media, implementing it on both Windows and the 360.

06:43.100 --> 06:48.100
Silverlight would be the same tech that Netflix would eventually use for its own in-browser streaming, too.

06:48.100 --> 06:51.100
In terms of console dominance, Microsoft had it made.

06:51.100 --> 06:54.100
The 360 beat the PS3 to the punch by releasing a full year earlier.

06:54.100 --> 06:59.100
It could boast about also supporting a next-gen video format, even if it ended up being the losing one down the line.

06:59.100 --> 07:03.100
It had a lower price, more good games, a more robust online service.

07:03.100 --> 07:06.100
And most importantly, it had secured an exclusivity deal with Netflix.

07:06.100 --> 07:12.100
It's hard to believe nowadays because Netflix is on every console, every PC, it's on phones, on smart TVs, it's on your fucking fridge.

07:12.100 --> 07:18.100
But back in the day, the only non-PC platform to support Netflix streaming was Microsoft's Xbox 360.

07:18.100 --> 07:22.100
Oh, you couldn't watch Sony movies on it like Spider-Man or whatever.

07:22.100 --> 07:26.100
Yeah, that generation's console war was an especially bitter one as far as console wars go.

07:26.100 --> 07:29.100
I wouldn't say it's my personal Vietnam, though, Movie Bob.

07:29.100 --> 07:33.100
So Microsoft was enjoying this exclusivity deal with Netflix, but Netflix had a different vision of the future.

07:33.100 --> 07:42.100
At one point, Netflix wanted to start selling Netflix boxes, which would be like VCRs or DVD players that you hook up to your TV, which would allow you to easily stream Netflix video.

07:42.100 --> 07:49.100
In fact, way earlier, Netflix envisioned these boxes as downloading movies overnight to a hard drive so that you could watch them the next day.

07:49.100 --> 07:52.100
They had this idea planned before streaming media was an option.

07:52.100 --> 07:57.100
But due to their company not being quite so profitable just yet, they decided to switch course.

07:57.100 --> 08:04.100
Abandoning the Netflix box and instead convincing the owners of other platforms to implement Netflix apps for their hardware instead.

08:04.100 --> 08:08.100
And Microsoft was all, yeah, sure, I'll do it, but only if you give me console exclusivity.

08:08.100 --> 08:13.100
So for a while, the 360 was the only place that had a dedicated Netflix app.

08:13.100 --> 08:16.100
And then a year later, the Nintendo Wii came out and radically changed video games.

08:16.100 --> 08:19.100
Before this point, you were an uber nerd if you actually liked video games.

08:19.100 --> 08:24.100
And progressive games journalists today still think so if you don't like them in the politically correct way.

08:24.100 --> 08:26.100
But the Wii appealed to the casual market.

08:26.100 --> 08:29.100
It's not just that you had a Wii, it's that your parents had a Wii.

08:29.100 --> 08:35.100
Old grandmas in retirement homes are still swinging Wiimotes around to this day because it was never about gaming to them.

08:35.100 --> 08:37.100
Just a great way to get them out of the chair for a while.

08:37.100 --> 08:42.100
Everybody had a Wii. My great aunt, who doesn't know what a video game is, has a Wii and she has Netflix on it.

08:42.100 --> 08:43.100
And here's how.

08:43.100 --> 08:48.100
Netflix began mailing out these free discs to anybody with both a Wii and a Netflix account.

08:48.100 --> 08:52.100
They would later do the same for PS3 owners and even PS2 owners in some areas of the world.

08:52.100 --> 08:56.100
But the Wii started the flood because it was so much more successful than any of its competitors.

08:56.100 --> 09:02.100
The Netflix deal with Microsoft was written such that the Xbox 360 would still be the only console with a specialized Netflix app.

09:02.100 --> 09:04.100
And that deal was still honored by Netflix.

09:04.100 --> 09:15.100
The Netflix discs for the Wii and PS3 simply contained a bit of internet browser software that allowed the consoles to access the PC in-browser version of the Netflix streaming service without a specialized app.

09:15.100 --> 09:21.100
By March 2010, Netflix had expanded to every single console with the use of these workaround discs.

09:21.100 --> 09:25.100
And by October of 2010, Netflix's exclusivity deal with Microsoft ran out.

09:25.100 --> 09:31.100
Netflix released proper apps for the Wii and the PS3, and all of those free Netflix discs turned into plastic trash that everyone threw out.

09:31.100 --> 09:34.100
Ultimately, Netflix would flip the script on the console boys.

09:34.100 --> 09:41.100
Their dominate-your-living-room ambitions ended with the failure of services like the Xbox One digital TV tuner and the Wii U's TV remote function.

09:41.100 --> 09:46.100
Nintendo really thought this was going to take off, so much so that there's actually a TV button on the Wii U gamepad.

09:46.100 --> 09:48.100
I don't think I've ever pressed this thing once.

09:48.100 --> 09:58.100
Meanwhile, with services like PlayStation Plus and Xbox Game Pass, these companies are now looking to the Netflix model of one monthly fee to stream unlimited content as something that they want to become.

09:58.100 --> 10:01.100
So at this point, things are looking pretty great for Netflix, aren't they?

10:01.100 --> 10:05.100
I didn't even talk about the proliferation of quality original content in this era, like House of Cards.

10:05.100 --> 10:06.100
That kind of goes without saying.

10:06.100 --> 10:09.100
Yeah, occasionally a show would get taken off of Netflix.

10:09.100 --> 10:13.100
And that would be annoying, because who wants to sign up to 50 different streaming services to get all the old shows and movies you want to see?

10:13.100 --> 10:15.100
You might as well go back to pirating at that point.

10:15.100 --> 10:18.100
But despite these hiccups, Netflix kept going strong.

10:18.100 --> 10:30.100
Money is pouring in, subs are up, Netflix originals are getting greenlit, and even as competitors like Hulu or Prime Video continue to grow and steal away old archives, and even make their own original content too, Netflix always remained on top.

10:30.100 --> 10:42.100
The first real hint to me that Netflix wasn't just a waste of money, but in fact was also a giant bureaucracy that was just incrementally failing in the middle of this slow-motion collapse was when Netflix put out Cuties.

10:42.100 --> 10:44.100
Yeah, listen, I'm not going to go over that movie again.

10:44.100 --> 10:50.100
If you saw the review of it back when it came out, you all know what it's about. It's about the 11-year-old girls who twerk and are hypersexualized. We all get what's going on here.

10:50.100 --> 10:52.100
Go watch that video if you care enough.

10:52.100 --> 10:57.100
Also, I realize in retrospect that I really did Mr. Girl an injustice here, without really understanding what he was trying to say.

10:57.100 --> 11:02.100
He said it in the worst way possible, but damn, I kind of like his stuff now. Sorry, Max.

11:02.100 --> 11:11.100
But to me, Cuties was the first major signal that this company was going to begin prioritizing political aims over actually creating a good product or providing a quality service.

11:11.100 --> 11:13.100
And that has only continued to be the case.

11:13.100 --> 11:22.100
The Cowboy Bebop and Death Note Netflix adaptations are legendarily bad, to the point that the media has continually and inexplicably been running defense for Cowboy Bebop.

11:22.100 --> 11:26.100
Because we stan a girl who properly covers up her shameful body, I guess.

11:26.100 --> 11:31.100
This trend began the Netflix adaptation meme, where manga downgrades to anime, which then downgrades to Netflix.

11:31.100 --> 11:38.100
And then there was the whole Dave Chappelle controversy, which I also covered in a previous video, where Chappelle had done six stand-up comedy specials for Netflix.

11:38.100 --> 11:46.100
And both Netflix's low-level Prague staffers and the wider internet were outraged that Chappelle would dare make jokes at the expense of trans people.

11:46.100 --> 11:53.100
And then there's the Tinder swindler, which is basically just the glorification of high-profile gold diggers who just so happened to hit TV a few years ago.

11:53.100 --> 11:57.100
And now there's a Netflix show about it. I don't care enough to really dig deep into this one.

11:57.100 --> 12:01.100
Gundam did a pretty good explained and autistic detail about it, so go watch that.

12:01.100 --> 12:06.100
Now it's not that everything Netflix touches turns to shit. They did the Castlevania series and that was pretty good.

12:06.100 --> 12:13.100
But there's been enough high-profile misses that, like I mentioned with that Netflix adaptation meme, whenever people hear the name Netflix, they groan in disappointment.

12:13.100 --> 12:18.100
Five years ago, the meme was that Netflix and chilling would lead to an entirely different type of groan.

12:18.100 --> 12:25.100
But nowadays, the company, the branding, just seems to have absolutely zero goodwill with the audience, which leads us to current year.

12:25.100 --> 12:28.100
Netflix is officially adding commercials. It's the end of an era for Netflix.

12:28.100 --> 12:33.100
While the service has long been praised for its lack of ads and commercials, Netflix is reversing course in the matter.

12:33.100 --> 12:36.100
On Tuesday, Deadline reported it would be incorporating ads into the service.

12:36.100 --> 12:39.100
Ads on the internet have had their own tumultuous history.

12:39.100 --> 12:46.100
But without diving down yet another rabbit hole for this video, let's just say that ads have generally become accepted as a form of evergreen revenue.

12:46.100 --> 12:53.100
But most content creators at this point make the majority of their income through more direct contributions, like having a Patreon or a Subscribestar or a merch store.

12:53.100 --> 13:01.100
For a while now, the general attitude among viewers is, if you directly support a content creator, you should be able to skip the ads that receive videos early or something like that.

13:01.100 --> 13:05.100
But platforms like YouTube and Twitch, looking to make a few more bucks, are slowly moving away from that model.

13:05.100 --> 13:12.100
And it's no surprise that Netflix is also eyeing up those commercial break-fade outs in their older shows as possible opportunity for more profit.

13:12.100 --> 13:17.100
Netflix estimates 100 million households are sharing passwords and suggests that a global crackdown is coming.

13:17.100 --> 13:20.100
Today could be a dark day for your ex-boyfriend's brother.

13:20.100 --> 13:25.100
Netflix, the world's largest streaming video company, warned that a global crackdown on password sharing is coming.

13:25.100 --> 13:27.100
It seems like a serious warning this time.

13:27.100 --> 13:34.100
Netflix said that it estimates more than 30 million U.S. and Canadian households are using a shared password to access its content.

13:34.100 --> 13:39.100
The company said that more than 100 million additional households were likely using a shared password worldwide.

13:39.100 --> 13:47.100
In its quarterly shareholder letter, Netflix acknowledged that it purposely allowed generous out-of-home password sharing because it helped users get hooked on the service.

13:47.100 --> 13:58.100
But with competition from Disney, Warner Brothers, Discovery, Paramount Global, NBCUniversal, Apple TV, and other streamers eating into its growth, Netflix says it wants the millions of households sharing passwords to start paying.

13:58.100 --> 14:09.100
This is another source of a Netflix-related meme, this time revolving around the ex who texts you late at night asking you for your old Netflix password even though you broke up six months ago, hoping she can keep Netflix and chilling on your dime.

14:09.100 --> 14:13.100
Netflix leaned into this meme at one point too, with the official Netflix account tweeting out,

14:13.100 --> 14:15.100
Love is sharing a password back in 2017.

14:15.100 --> 14:17.100
We're never going to hear that one again, eh?

14:17.100 --> 14:20.100
What Netflix doesn't understand is that this is going to have a lot of blowback.

14:20.100 --> 14:25.100
They might think it's going to get them a lot more accounts now that these people are hooked on the service.

14:25.100 --> 14:29.100
But what's actually going to happen is, it will end up being the push for people to abandon Netflix.

14:29.100 --> 14:35.100
Whether it's pirating games, pirating movies, sharing or renting, going halfsies on a gift or a car or an apartment, whatever.

14:35.100 --> 14:41.100
People generally like being able to opt in with friends to spread costs and share benefits.

14:41.100 --> 14:49.100
Movie producers and game developers and even bands, if you want to go back to the Napster days, once viewed each pirated copy of their content as a single lost sale.

14:49.100 --> 14:51.100
That's just not how this thing works.

14:51.100 --> 14:57.100
Many people, when given the hard choice of paying full price or going without, or stealing it, they're not going to pay full price.

14:57.100 --> 14:58.100
And that's that.

14:58.100 --> 15:03.100
Netflix has lost 200,000 subscribers in quarter one and expects to lose another 2 million in quarter two.

15:03.100 --> 15:07.100
Netflix is canceling animation projects after a highly publicized drop in users.

15:07.100 --> 15:09.100
Massive restructuring at Netflix sees talent let go.

15:09.100 --> 15:12.100
Meanwhile, Netflix cancels shows that people actually want to watch.

15:12.100 --> 15:14.100
Like, for example, The Dark Crystal Season 2.

15:14.100 --> 15:17.100
Only to pump out season after season of fucking Big Mouth.

15:17.100 --> 15:20.100
And is there any surprise that the stock is collapsing?

15:20.100 --> 15:25.100
Yeah dude, it was almost at $400 at a few points recently, but it immediately fell off a cliff.

15:25.100 --> 15:29.100
And these images are the ones that went viral last week, but it hasn't exactly stopped falling.

15:29.100 --> 15:30.100
Here's how it looks today.

15:30.100 --> 15:31.100
Oof.

15:31.100 --> 15:33.100
I will say one thing though in Netflix's defense.

15:33.100 --> 15:37.100
A lot of people right now are currently knocking the Netflix original he's expecting for being woke garbage.

15:37.100 --> 15:39.100
And yeah, looking at the poster that's what I thought it was too.

15:39.100 --> 15:41.100
But it turns out this time it's actually not.

15:41.100 --> 15:46.100
This image isn't actually of a trans man who gets pregnant by a trans woman's child or something.

15:46.100 --> 15:52.100
He's expecting is actually adapted from a Japanese comedy drama manga from 2012 called Kentaro Hayama's First Pregnancy.

15:52.100 --> 16:00.100
Set in an alternate universe where human males biologically have a 10% chance compared to human females of getting pregnant after sex with a woman.

16:00.100 --> 16:05.100
In the lore of the story, historically, these men would simply die since they can't actually birth the child.

16:06.100 --> 16:09.100
But modern medicine has allowed these men to survive through a c-section.

16:09.100 --> 16:11.100
However, there's social stigma surrounding male pregnancy.

16:11.100 --> 16:14.100
And like a lot of Japanese media, it's actually pretty not woke.

16:14.100 --> 16:17.100
It simply presents various storylines as they would be.

16:17.100 --> 16:25.100
One teenager, fearful of the stigma and of his parents' reaction to the fact that he fucked his girlfriend, aborts his child and becomes traumatized by it, destroying his relationship.

16:25.100 --> 16:29.100
One woman is jealous that her husband is carrying their second child and mistreats him.

16:29.100 --> 16:33.100
It's all the usual J-drama interweaving plotline stuff and it's not woke at all.

16:33.100 --> 16:38.100
In fact, when it is played up for comedy, it's a lot more like the 90s Schwarzenegger comedy Junior.

16:38.100 --> 16:39.100
Nobody considered that woke.

16:39.100 --> 16:45.100
You know what? I bet if the procs got wise to this movie's existence, it would probably be retrospectively cancelled, wouldn't it?

16:45.100 --> 16:47.100
My body, my choice.

16:47.100 --> 16:52.100
At the same time, I don't blame people for falsely thinking that he's expecting is woke garbage.

16:52.100 --> 16:57.100
Because it looks exactly like something that a wokeoid would put out and call stunning and brave.

16:57.100 --> 17:00.100
We've seen LGBT agitprop involving pregnant men for a while now.

17:00.100 --> 17:09.100
Hell, I remember that one disgusting display of child abuse where a trans woman made her child suckle at her teat despite it giving no milk as a way to relieve her dysphoria.

17:09.100 --> 17:16.100
Something that was considered to be stunning and brave and taken deathly seriously and yet was also played up for laughs in the past, this time when Family Guy.

17:16.100 --> 17:23.100
So if I knew nothing other than current year politics and you showed me he's expecting, I would just think, yep, it's Netflix creating woke garbage.

17:23.100 --> 17:26.100
Because that is all that Netflix is known for now.

17:26.100 --> 17:28.100
And that's where the company's going down in flames.

17:28.100 --> 17:37.100
From 1934 to 1968, Hollywood was held in the grip of the Motion Picture Production Code, also known as the Hays Code, named after the president of the Motion Picture Producers and Distributors at the time.

17:37.100 --> 17:42.100
A similar organization, the Comics Code Authority, functioned from 1954 to 2011.

17:42.100 --> 17:44.100
And the ESRB has also been the video game equivalent.

17:44.100 --> 17:48.100
All three organizations have or had the same basic stated goal.

17:48.100 --> 17:53.100
To classify media into age groups and prevent the totally obscene from being published at all.

17:53.100 --> 18:00.100
Sometimes through government mandate, sometimes through getting private distributors to agree not to sell content that they deem inappropriate.

18:00.100 --> 18:03.100
Of these three, the ESRB is probably the least stringent.

18:03.100 --> 18:06.100
The only rating that stores won't sell games in is AO.

18:06.100 --> 18:11.100
And in order to get that rating, your game generally has to be explicitly pornographic.

18:11.100 --> 18:21.100
The only AO games that don't have sexual content are 2003's Peak Entertainment Casinos, where the developer explicitly asked for an AO rating to discourage underage gambling.

18:21.100 --> 18:24.100
And 2015's Hatred, which is actually a genocide simulator.

18:24.100 --> 18:31.100
The other two regulatory groups, the CAA and the Hays Code, both used their mandate to classify media as a way to censor media.

18:31.100 --> 18:38.100
And while the ESRB still survives because it doesn't exist to censor, its two brothers fell in exactly the same way.

18:38.100 --> 18:45.100
Non-compliant competitors began to explode in popularity because, eventually, people got sick of the moral grandstanding in entertainment.

18:45.100 --> 18:49.100
They wanted to relax and not be preached at and have this morality constantly pushed upon them.

18:49.100 --> 18:53.100
So they began seeking out alternatives because who wants to be scolded for who they are or what they believe?

18:53.100 --> 18:59.100
Who wants to sit down after a hard day's work and get a lecture about the way society should be and how you should behave?

18:59.100 --> 19:05.100
Foreign films and comics weren't bound by these codes, and overseas content became popular in the United States for this reason.

19:05.100 --> 19:14.100
Eventually, American directors and cartoonists began to openly flaunt the regulations, simply telling the stories they wanted to tell, without the pruning, without the censorship and the preachy bullshit.

19:14.100 --> 19:18.100
Some of them lost the support of their industries, but they were ultimately too popular to ignore.

19:18.100 --> 19:22.100
And eventually, these regulations collapsed due to mass non-compliance.

19:22.100 --> 19:27.100
And here's the funny thing about the story. Both of these regulations existed to be explicitly anti-leftist.

19:27.100 --> 19:36.100
The Hays Code was specifically written to target communists and hippies in an age of McCarthyism with the openly stated goal of the prevention of the alteration of the morality of American society.

19:36.100 --> 19:41.100
I don't know how much you know about the 1970s, but that shift in morality happened anyway.

19:41.100 --> 20:01.100
The CCA had similar restrictions, being extremely sexually puritan in its judgments, not allowing any sort of violence or alternative sexuality or drug use, and demanding that all anti-social activities, both criminality and revolutionary politics, be universally portrayed as dysfunctional and pitiable, while all upholders of social order, like cops and judges, must always be portrayed as good.

20:01.100 --> 20:05.100
But eventually, cartoonists began to openly flaunt the CCA's regulations.

20:05.100 --> 20:08.100
Nowadays, we're seeing the same thing, except the roles have been reversed.

20:08.100 --> 20:13.100
The leftists are in charge of the censoring authorities now, and the culture is shifting away from their politics.

20:13.100 --> 20:24.100
Leftists have moved into Netflix and other streaming services, they've moved into Hollywood studios, they've moved into game development, and they're now creating media preaching to people how they should be, what they should think, what kind of society they should want.

20:24.100 --> 20:30.100
And your average person, they're simply tuning out and finding alternatives, just like they did with the Hays Code and the CCA back then.

20:30.100 --> 20:37.100
Netflix is only the most obvious example of a slow-motion collapse in progress, as they buckle under the weight of their own ideology.

20:37.100 --> 20:42.100
But the other streaming services and companies that are putting politics ahead of quality will be next on the chopping block.

20:42.100 --> 20:50.100
Your average person just doesn't want to be preached at, and the culture will reroute around censorship, even if it has to dip into a grey market to do so, just like it has before.

20:50.100 --> 20:56.100
The only thing that the progs have left is to complain until they're blue-faced about how problematic it is that they're being rerouted around.

20:56.100 --> 21:05.100
That's why you might see lefty memes like this floating around right now, where the problem that non-leftists have with the current state of media is portrayed as a false dichotomy between the normative and the political.

21:05.100 --> 21:10.100
But I would say that any Twitter account that posts this shit has shown the mark of the cope upon them.

21:10.100 --> 21:16.100
There's a clear difference between a political drama like House of Cards or Deep Space Nine or something, and a show that preaches its politics to you.

21:16.100 --> 21:27.100
The former is political in that politics is a driving force within the narrative. The latter is political in that it's overtly telling the audience what they must believe, and how bad of a person they must be if they don't comply. That's the difference.

21:27.100 --> 21:37.100
In any case, Netflix seems to be on the way out. Companies survive as shells of their former selves for a very long time, just look at Blockbuster and Redbox after all, so I don't think that Netflix is about to close their doors anytime soon.

21:37.100 --> 21:44.100
But what's in store for them is a long, slow decline across the 2020s, before they finally disappear with a whimper. And you know what? That's okay.

21:44.100 --> 21:52.100
Better structures, more suited for the new environment, will be built to replace this decaying one, and eventually those new structures will rot out and be replaced in turn.

21:52.100 --> 22:04.100
That's the nature of creative destruction. It's a necessary process in a free society. The only people who complain are the ones who, in the face of another person's freedom, whether it be money or political power, have something to lose.
