0	3500	I've got to tell you, I've never had my own Netflix account, never saw the point of it, frankly.
3500	8700	Girlfriends, roommates, family members, they always had their own account that I inevitably got the password for eventually.
8700	11200	So if I ever wanted to use the service, I always had access to it.
11200	15400	But I can count the number of times that I've opened up Netflix for my own purposes on one hand.
15400	18600	Sometimes Naomi might want to watch something on it and sometimes I might join her.
18600	25700	But if it's just me by myself, I rank Netflix down somewhere near cable TV as something that I want to actually spend my spare time on.
25700	32600	That's not to say that Netflix doesn't have good content on it or at least had good content on it at one point, considering how much stuff has left the platform over the years.
32600	36700	But even now, do you want to watch Seinfeld, Friends, Star Trek, The Next Generation?
36700	41300	Disregarding Netflix originals for now, the Netflix backlog is still formidable even nowadays.
41300	49200	And I guess the idea of that backlog is always what Netflix seemed to be about for me as a millennial and also why I never cared about the service.
49200	57800	I grew up in an era of the internet that is pre-video streaming, where if you wanted episodes of an anime or a TV show, you would download it on a file-sharing program
57800	65800	and hope that you didn't accidentally click on Dragonball Z Episode 10.mp4.exe with a file size of 212 kilobytes.
65800	72000	The episodes that you did get would have a resolution of about 100 pixels across and the audio sounded like it was recorded in a cymbal factory.
72000	73000	But hey, it was free.
73000	75700	And before Pornhub, this is how people shared porn too.
75700	80000	Though those files were a lot more likely to contain viruses or have some really weird shit on them.
80000	84900	Anybody else remember downloading an X-rated video when you discovered that it was a relabeled Faces of Death video?
84900	87900	Yeah, thanks anonymous internet troll from 20 years ago.
87900	94200	However, it's not like video content was relegated to file-sharing and later BitTorrent because people didn't know what streaming was.
94200	96100	It was actually because of a lack of tech.
96100	100700	The concept of streaming media was actually invented in 1881, no joke.
100700	107900	The French company Theaterphone saw the possibilities of merging primitive recording and playback technologies with the then new telephone
107900	113400	to provide a service where operas and stage productions could be transmitted over the phone to people who couldn't be there physically.
113400	119200	By 1890, the tech was adapted to create the telephone newspaper where you could listen to the news of the day over the phone.
119200	124400	By 1920, the tech was adapted again to create Muzak by the company literally called Muzak
124400	129400	to provide generic background music for grocery stores and elevators, again transmitted over telephone.
129400	135800	The creator of Muzak, George Squire, dubbed his technology and its ancestors, Theaterphone and telephone newspaper,
135800	142000	continuous streaming to contrast it with the then significantly more expensive and temperamental radio technology.
142000	146400	Radio was wireless and omnidirectional, allowing anybody with the proper equipment to tune in,
146400	150000	but back then that equipment was very expensive and not likely to work.
150000	154900	Meanwhile, streaming was more reliable and higher quality, but it required a physical hookup to the network.
154900	162500	Eventually, as radio tech became more commercially viable, the concept of directly streaming media to the end user mostly died off in the 1930s,
162500	168900	with the exception of a live jukebox service in Philadelphia that was controlled remotely by an operator in the 60s and 70s,
168900	172400	and also except for Muzak. That's still going strong today, and where will we be without it?
172400	178300	The point I'm making is, the idea of having content stored in one location and then streamed to users in another location,
178300	183500	rather than having to have the content at the user's location, is an idea that has been around for a very long time,
183500	188100	but we just haven't had the technology to do it cheaply until YouTube, and even then YouTube still loses money,
188100	192000	but that's nothing like the theoretical money pit that would have been a 1990s YouTube.
192000	196900	YouTube showed the world that streaming could work with the modern internet tech, at least modern for 2006.
196900	202100	The key word being could, because many a YouTube competitor have bit the dust or languished in obscurity,
202100	205100	trying to do what YouTube does without the financial backing of Google.
205100	209600	Some of you Zoomers might not know this, but Netflix didn't start as a video streaming service.
209600	216800	It began as a mail-order DVD rental service instead in August of 1997, back before video streaming was technologically viable.
216800	223500	The OGs of Netflix, Mark Randolph, Reed Hastings, and Patty McCord, were all in a carpool group together in Silicon Valley,
223500	227900	working for a different company, where they spitballed the idea of a VHS mailing service.
227900	233800	It turned out that videotapes were too fragile to be shipped through the mail, with all of their intricate parts and delicate magnetic tape,
233800	239800	but DVDs, which had come out only a few months before, proved to be sturdy enough to survive a trip with the US Postal Service,
239800	243800	after they actually mailed a test desk between Randolph and Hastings' houses.
243800	248100	And so the gang decided to leave their jobs and start Netflix as a DVD rental service.
248100	253600	And hey, if for some reason you still like physical media like that, you can still have Netflix ship DVDs to you.
253600	256100	Here's what Netflix.com looked like back in the day.
256100	257100	Wild, isn't it?
257100	261400	They did the $4.99 per movie rental thing, same as the brick-and-mortar stores like Blockbuster Video,
261400	263600	but eventually they transitioned to a subscription service.
263600	266400	One monthly fee, pick your DVDs, they'll be shipped right to your door.
266400	269900	Netflix famously asked Blockbuster to buy them out in the early days,
269900	273600	but Blockbuster refused, with its CEO thinking that the internet was just a passing phase.
273600	276600	That would basically be the final nail in the coffin for Blockbuster,
276600	280600	as the brick-and-mortar video rental store model had significantly more overhead than Netflix.
280600	285600	Blockbuster's final gasp was to spin up a service called Blockbuster Total Access,
285600	288600	which was basically identical to Netflix's mail rental service.
288600	289600	But it was too little too late.
289600	295100	Blockbuster implemented this in 2007, the same year that Netflix transitioned away from that very same model
295100	296600	and into the video streaming business.
296600	300100	I don't think I need a segue into a boomer nostalgia rant about Blockbuster, do I?
300100	302600	I'm sure YouTube is filled with people talking about Blockbuster memes,
302600	307600	or how they spent their best Friday evenings of their lives looking for the ideal N64 game to rent, or something like that.
307600	308600	You all know what's going on.
308600	312100	Also, I guess I'd be remiss if I didn't point out Redbox.
312100	315600	Redbox appeared to fill the void that Netflix and Blockbuster left behind.
315600	318600	Rather than deal with mailing DVDs or brick-and-mortar stores,
318600	324600	Redbox placed video rental vending machines in high-traffic locations, like malls and grocery stores.
324600	330600	That, coupled with the ability to return a rental to any kiosk, not specifically the one that you rented it from, led to Redbox's success.
330600	336600	Even now, in 2022, they're still limping along because the service is convenient for older people who don't know how to use new technology.
336600	340100	That's basically what Netflix sold, and still sells too. Convenience.
340100	343100	To somebody like me, turning on a BitTorrent program might be no problem,
343100	346100	but for most people, convenience is something that they're willing to pay for.
346100	349600	Netflix's rise would only continue after Blockbuster fell by the wayside.
349600	353600	At this point in Netflix's story, the seventh console generation was swinging into gear.
353600	357100	That's the PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Nintendo Wii era, by the way.
357100	359100	And again, for those of you who don't remember,
359100	363100	oh god, I'm old, this shit was happening when I was in university, how could time be so fleeting?
363100	370100	This generation of video game console war saw companies duke it out not only over video games, but also over dominance of the living room.
370100	376100	PlayStation 2, including a built-in DVD player, was what helped DVD become the dominant format of the 2000s.
376100	381600	And Sony was hoping to replicate that success in the 2010s by including a Blu-ray disc player in the PS3.
381600	386100	Meanwhile, the Xbox 360 supported the competing HD DVD format by Toshiba.
386100	391600	But unlike the PS3, the 360 didn't actually have one built into it. You had to buy one of these things and plug it into your 360.
391600	396100	Man, does anyone remember these things? You can get them nowadays as a paperweight for like three dollars.
396100	403100	At the same time, Microsoft was also developing Silverlight, a framework for streaming media, implementing it on both Windows and the 360.
403100	408100	Silverlight would be the same tech that Netflix would eventually use for its own in-browser streaming, too.
408100	411100	In terms of console dominance, Microsoft had it made.
411100	414100	The 360 beat the PS3 to the punch by releasing a full year earlier.
414100	419100	It could boast about also supporting a next-gen video format, even if it ended up being the losing one down the line.
419100	423100	It had a lower price, more good games, a more robust online service.
423100	426100	And most importantly, it had secured an exclusivity deal with Netflix.
426100	432100	It's hard to believe nowadays because Netflix is on every console, every PC, it's on phones, on smart TVs, it's on your fucking fridge.
432100	438100	But back in the day, the only non-PC platform to support Netflix streaming was Microsoft's Xbox 360.
438100	442100	Oh, you couldn't watch Sony movies on it like Spider-Man or whatever.
442100	446100	Yeah, that generation's console war was an especially bitter one as far as console wars go.
446100	449100	I wouldn't say it's my personal Vietnam, though, Movie Bob.
449100	453100	So Microsoft was enjoying this exclusivity deal with Netflix, but Netflix had a different vision of the future.
453100	462100	At one point, Netflix wanted to start selling Netflix boxes, which would be like VCRs or DVD players that you hook up to your TV, which would allow you to easily stream Netflix video.
462100	469100	In fact, way earlier, Netflix envisioned these boxes as downloading movies overnight to a hard drive so that you could watch them the next day.
469100	472100	They had this idea planned before streaming media was an option.
472100	477100	But due to their company not being quite so profitable just yet, they decided to switch course.
477100	484100	Abandoning the Netflix box and instead convincing the owners of other platforms to implement Netflix apps for their hardware instead.
484100	488100	And Microsoft was all, yeah, sure, I'll do it, but only if you give me console exclusivity.
488100	493100	So for a while, the 360 was the only place that had a dedicated Netflix app.
493100	496100	And then a year later, the Nintendo Wii came out and radically changed video games.
496100	499100	Before this point, you were an uber nerd if you actually liked video games.
499100	504100	And progressive games journalists today still think so if you don't like them in the politically correct way.
504100	506100	But the Wii appealed to the casual market.
506100	509100	It's not just that you had a Wii, it's that your parents had a Wii.
509100	515100	Old grandmas in retirement homes are still swinging Wiimotes around to this day because it was never about gaming to them.
515100	517100	Just a great way to get them out of the chair for a while.
517100	522100	Everybody had a Wii. My great aunt, who doesn't know what a video game is, has a Wii and she has Netflix on it.
522100	523100	And here's how.
523100	528100	Netflix began mailing out these free discs to anybody with both a Wii and a Netflix account.
528100	532100	They would later do the same for PS3 owners and even PS2 owners in some areas of the world.
532100	536100	But the Wii started the flood because it was so much more successful than any of its competitors.
536100	542100	The Netflix deal with Microsoft was written such that the Xbox 360 would still be the only console with a specialized Netflix app.
542100	544100	And that deal was still honored by Netflix.
544100	555100	The Netflix discs for the Wii and PS3 simply contained a bit of internet browser software that allowed the consoles to access the PC in-browser version of the Netflix streaming service without a specialized app.
555100	561100	By March 2010, Netflix had expanded to every single console with the use of these workaround discs.
561100	565100	And by October of 2010, Netflix's exclusivity deal with Microsoft ran out.
565100	571100	Netflix released proper apps for the Wii and the PS3, and all of those free Netflix discs turned into plastic trash that everyone threw out.
571100	574100	Ultimately, Netflix would flip the script on the console boys.
574100	581100	Their dominate-your-living-room ambitions ended with the failure of services like the Xbox One digital TV tuner and the Wii U's TV remote function.
581100	586100	Nintendo really thought this was going to take off, so much so that there's actually a TV button on the Wii U gamepad.
586100	588100	I don't think I've ever pressed this thing once.
588100	598100	Meanwhile, with services like PlayStation Plus and Xbox Game Pass, these companies are now looking to the Netflix model of one monthly fee to stream unlimited content as something that they want to become.
598100	601100	So at this point, things are looking pretty great for Netflix, aren't they?
601100	605100	I didn't even talk about the proliferation of quality original content in this era, like House of Cards.
605100	606100	That kind of goes without saying.
606100	609100	Yeah, occasionally a show would get taken off of Netflix.
609100	613100	And that would be annoying, because who wants to sign up to 50 different streaming services to get all the old shows and movies you want to see?
613100	615100	You might as well go back to pirating at that point.
615100	618100	But despite these hiccups, Netflix kept going strong.
618100	630100	Money is pouring in, subs are up, Netflix originals are getting greenlit, and even as competitors like Hulu or Prime Video continue to grow and steal away old archives, and even make their own original content too, Netflix always remained on top.
630100	642100	The first real hint to me that Netflix wasn't just a waste of money, but in fact was also a giant bureaucracy that was just incrementally failing in the middle of this slow-motion collapse was when Netflix put out Cuties.
642100	644100	Yeah, listen, I'm not going to go over that movie again.
644100	650100	If you saw the review of it back when it came out, you all know what it's about. It's about the 11-year-old girls who twerk and are hypersexualized. We all get what's going on here.
650100	652100	Go watch that video if you care enough.
652100	657100	Also, I realize in retrospect that I really did Mr. Girl an injustice here, without really understanding what he was trying to say.
657100	662100	He said it in the worst way possible, but damn, I kind of like his stuff now. Sorry, Max.
662100	671100	But to me, Cuties was the first major signal that this company was going to begin prioritizing political aims over actually creating a good product or providing a quality service.
671100	673100	And that has only continued to be the case.
673100	682100	The Cowboy Bebop and Death Note Netflix adaptations are legendarily bad, to the point that the media has continually and inexplicably been running defense for Cowboy Bebop.
682100	686100	Because we stan a girl who properly covers up her shameful body, I guess.
686100	691100	This trend began the Netflix adaptation meme, where manga downgrades to anime, which then downgrades to Netflix.
691100	698100	And then there was the whole Dave Chappelle controversy, which I also covered in a previous video, where Chappelle had done six stand-up comedy specials for Netflix.
698100	706100	And both Netflix's low-level Prague staffers and the wider internet were outraged that Chappelle would dare make jokes at the expense of trans people.
706100	713100	And then there's the Tinder swindler, which is basically just the glorification of high-profile gold diggers who just so happened to hit TV a few years ago.
713100	717100	And now there's a Netflix show about it. I don't care enough to really dig deep into this one.
717100	721100	Gundam did a pretty good explained and autistic detail about it, so go watch that.
721100	726100	Now it's not that everything Netflix touches turns to shit. They did the Castlevania series and that was pretty good.
726100	733100	But there's been enough high-profile misses that, like I mentioned with that Netflix adaptation meme, whenever people hear the name Netflix, they groan in disappointment.
733100	738100	Five years ago, the meme was that Netflix and chilling would lead to an entirely different type of groan.
738100	745100	But nowadays, the company, the branding, just seems to have absolutely zero goodwill with the audience, which leads us to current year.
745100	748100	Netflix is officially adding commercials. It's the end of an era for Netflix.
748100	753100	While the service has long been praised for its lack of ads and commercials, Netflix is reversing course in the matter.
753100	756100	On Tuesday, Deadline reported it would be incorporating ads into the service.
756100	759100	Ads on the internet have had their own tumultuous history.
759100	766100	But without diving down yet another rabbit hole for this video, let's just say that ads have generally become accepted as a form of evergreen revenue.
766100	773100	But most content creators at this point make the majority of their income through more direct contributions, like having a Patreon or a Subscribestar or a merch store.
773100	781100	For a while now, the general attitude among viewers is, if you directly support a content creator, you should be able to skip the ads that receive videos early or something like that.
781100	785100	But platforms like YouTube and Twitch, looking to make a few more bucks, are slowly moving away from that model.
785100	792100	And it's no surprise that Netflix is also eyeing up those commercial break-fade outs in their older shows as possible opportunity for more profit.
792100	797100	Netflix estimates 100 million households are sharing passwords and suggests that a global crackdown is coming.
797100	800100	Today could be a dark day for your ex-boyfriend's brother.
800100	805100	Netflix, the world's largest streaming video company, warned that a global crackdown on password sharing is coming.
805100	807100	It seems like a serious warning this time.
807100	814100	Netflix said that it estimates more than 30 million U.S. and Canadian households are using a shared password to access its content.
814100	819100	The company said that more than 100 million additional households were likely using a shared password worldwide.
819100	827100	In its quarterly shareholder letter, Netflix acknowledged that it purposely allowed generous out-of-home password sharing because it helped users get hooked on the service.
827100	838100	But with competition from Disney, Warner Brothers, Discovery, Paramount Global, NBCUniversal, Apple TV, and other streamers eating into its growth, Netflix says it wants the millions of households sharing passwords to start paying.
838100	849100	This is another source of a Netflix-related meme, this time revolving around the ex who texts you late at night asking you for your old Netflix password even though you broke up six months ago, hoping she can keep Netflix and chilling on your dime.
849100	853100	Netflix leaned into this meme at one point too, with the official Netflix account tweeting out,
853100	855100	Love is sharing a password back in 2017.
855100	857100	We're never going to hear that one again, eh?
857100	860100	What Netflix doesn't understand is that this is going to have a lot of blowback.
860100	865100	They might think it's going to get them a lot more accounts now that these people are hooked on the service.
865100	869100	But what's actually going to happen is, it will end up being the push for people to abandon Netflix.
869100	875100	Whether it's pirating games, pirating movies, sharing or renting, going halfsies on a gift or a car or an apartment, whatever.
875100	881100	People generally like being able to opt in with friends to spread costs and share benefits.
881100	889100	Movie producers and game developers and even bands, if you want to go back to the Napster days, once viewed each pirated copy of their content as a single lost sale.
889100	891100	That's just not how this thing works.
891100	897100	Many people, when given the hard choice of paying full price or going without, or stealing it, they're not going to pay full price.
897100	898100	And that's that.
898100	903100	Netflix has lost 200,000 subscribers in quarter one and expects to lose another 2 million in quarter two.
903100	907100	Netflix is canceling animation projects after a highly publicized drop in users.
907100	909100	Massive restructuring at Netflix sees talent let go.
909100	912100	Meanwhile, Netflix cancels shows that people actually want to watch.
912100	914100	Like, for example, The Dark Crystal Season 2.
914100	917100	Only to pump out season after season of fucking Big Mouth.
917100	920100	And is there any surprise that the stock is collapsing?
920100	925100	Yeah dude, it was almost at $400 at a few points recently, but it immediately fell off a cliff.
925100	929100	And these images are the ones that went viral last week, but it hasn't exactly stopped falling.
929100	930100	Here's how it looks today.
930100	931100	Oof.
931100	933100	I will say one thing though in Netflix's defense.
933100	937100	A lot of people right now are currently knocking the Netflix original he's expecting for being woke garbage.
937100	939100	And yeah, looking at the poster that's what I thought it was too.
939100	941100	But it turns out this time it's actually not.
941100	946100	This image isn't actually of a trans man who gets pregnant by a trans woman's child or something.
946100	952100	He's expecting is actually adapted from a Japanese comedy drama manga from 2012 called Kentaro Hayama's First Pregnancy.
952100	960100	Set in an alternate universe where human males biologically have a 10% chance compared to human females of getting pregnant after sex with a woman.
960100	965100	In the lore of the story, historically, these men would simply die since they can't actually birth the child.
966100	969100	But modern medicine has allowed these men to survive through a c-section.
969100	971100	However, there's social stigma surrounding male pregnancy.
971100	974100	And like a lot of Japanese media, it's actually pretty not woke.
974100	977100	It simply presents various storylines as they would be.
977100	985100	One teenager, fearful of the stigma and of his parents' reaction to the fact that he fucked his girlfriend, aborts his child and becomes traumatized by it, destroying his relationship.
985100	989100	One woman is jealous that her husband is carrying their second child and mistreats him.
989100	993100	It's all the usual J-drama interweaving plotline stuff and it's not woke at all.
993100	998100	In fact, when it is played up for comedy, it's a lot more like the 90s Schwarzenegger comedy Junior.
998100	999100	Nobody considered that woke.
999100	1005100	You know what? I bet if the procs got wise to this movie's existence, it would probably be retrospectively cancelled, wouldn't it?
1005100	1007100	My body, my choice.
1007100	1012100	At the same time, I don't blame people for falsely thinking that he's expecting is woke garbage.
1012100	1017100	Because it looks exactly like something that a wokeoid would put out and call stunning and brave.
1017100	1020100	We've seen LGBT agitprop involving pregnant men for a while now.
1020100	1029100	Hell, I remember that one disgusting display of child abuse where a trans woman made her child suckle at her teat despite it giving no milk as a way to relieve her dysphoria.
1029100	1036100	Something that was considered to be stunning and brave and taken deathly seriously and yet was also played up for laughs in the past, this time when Family Guy.
1036100	1043100	So if I knew nothing other than current year politics and you showed me he's expecting, I would just think, yep, it's Netflix creating woke garbage.
1043100	1046100	Because that is all that Netflix is known for now.
1046100	1048100	And that's where the company's going down in flames.
1048100	1057100	From 1934 to 1968, Hollywood was held in the grip of the Motion Picture Production Code, also known as the Hays Code, named after the president of the Motion Picture Producers and Distributors at the time.
1057100	1062100	A similar organization, the Comics Code Authority, functioned from 1954 to 2011.
1062100	1064100	And the ESRB has also been the video game equivalent.
1064100	1068100	All three organizations have or had the same basic stated goal.
1068100	1073100	To classify media into age groups and prevent the totally obscene from being published at all.
1073100	1080100	Sometimes through government mandate, sometimes through getting private distributors to agree not to sell content that they deem inappropriate.
1080100	1083100	Of these three, the ESRB is probably the least stringent.
1083100	1086100	The only rating that stores won't sell games in is AO.
1086100	1091100	And in order to get that rating, your game generally has to be explicitly pornographic.
1091100	1101100	The only AO games that don't have sexual content are 2003's Peak Entertainment Casinos, where the developer explicitly asked for an AO rating to discourage underage gambling.
1101100	1104100	And 2015's Hatred, which is actually a genocide simulator.
1104100	1111100	The other two regulatory groups, the CAA and the Hays Code, both used their mandate to classify media as a way to censor media.
1111100	1118100	And while the ESRB still survives because it doesn't exist to censor, its two brothers fell in exactly the same way.
1118100	1125100	Non-compliant competitors began to explode in popularity because, eventually, people got sick of the moral grandstanding in entertainment.
1125100	1129100	They wanted to relax and not be preached at and have this morality constantly pushed upon them.
1129100	1133100	So they began seeking out alternatives because who wants to be scolded for who they are or what they believe?
1133100	1139100	Who wants to sit down after a hard day's work and get a lecture about the way society should be and how you should behave?
1139100	1145100	Foreign films and comics weren't bound by these codes, and overseas content became popular in the United States for this reason.
1145100	1154100	Eventually, American directors and cartoonists began to openly flaunt the regulations, simply telling the stories they wanted to tell, without the pruning, without the censorship and the preachy bullshit.
1154100	1158100	Some of them lost the support of their industries, but they were ultimately too popular to ignore.
1158100	1162100	And eventually, these regulations collapsed due to mass non-compliance.
1162100	1167100	And here's the funny thing about the story. Both of these regulations existed to be explicitly anti-leftist.
1167100	1176100	The Hays Code was specifically written to target communists and hippies in an age of McCarthyism with the openly stated goal of the prevention of the alteration of the morality of American society.
1176100	1181100	I don't know how much you know about the 1970s, but that shift in morality happened anyway.
1181100	1201100	The CCA had similar restrictions, being extremely sexually puritan in its judgments, not allowing any sort of violence or alternative sexuality or drug use, and demanding that all anti-social activities, both criminality and revolutionary politics, be universally portrayed as dysfunctional and pitiable, while all upholders of social order, like cops and judges, must always be portrayed as good.
1201100	1205100	But eventually, cartoonists began to openly flaunt the CCA's regulations.
1205100	1208100	Nowadays, we're seeing the same thing, except the roles have been reversed.
1208100	1213100	The leftists are in charge of the censoring authorities now, and the culture is shifting away from their politics.
1213100	1224100	Leftists have moved into Netflix and other streaming services, they've moved into Hollywood studios, they've moved into game development, and they're now creating media preaching to people how they should be, what they should think, what kind of society they should want.
1224100	1230100	And your average person, they're simply tuning out and finding alternatives, just like they did with the Hays Code and the CCA back then.
1230100	1237100	Netflix is only the most obvious example of a slow-motion collapse in progress, as they buckle under the weight of their own ideology.
1237100	1242100	But the other streaming services and companies that are putting politics ahead of quality will be next on the chopping block.
1242100	1250100	Your average person just doesn't want to be preached at, and the culture will reroute around censorship, even if it has to dip into a grey market to do so, just like it has before.
1250100	1256100	The only thing that the progs have left is to complain until they're blue-faced about how problematic it is that they're being rerouted around.
1256100	1265100	That's why you might see lefty memes like this floating around right now, where the problem that non-leftists have with the current state of media is portrayed as a false dichotomy between the normative and the political.
1265100	1270100	But I would say that any Twitter account that posts this shit has shown the mark of the cope upon them.
1270100	1276100	There's a clear difference between a political drama like House of Cards or Deep Space Nine or something, and a show that preaches its politics to you.
1276100	1287100	The former is political in that politics is a driving force within the narrative. The latter is political in that it's overtly telling the audience what they must believe, and how bad of a person they must be if they don't comply. That's the difference.
1287100	1297100	In any case, Netflix seems to be on the way out. Companies survive as shells of their former selves for a very long time, just look at Blockbuster and Redbox after all, so I don't think that Netflix is about to close their doors anytime soon.
1297100	1304100	But what's in store for them is a long, slow decline across the 2020s, before they finally disappear with a whimper. And you know what? That's okay.
1304100	1312100	Better structures, more suited for the new environment, will be built to replace this decaying one, and eventually those new structures will rot out and be replaced in turn.
1312100	1324100	That's the nature of creative destruction. It's a necessary process in a free society. The only people who complain are the ones who, in the face of another person's freedom, whether it be money or political power, have something to lose.
