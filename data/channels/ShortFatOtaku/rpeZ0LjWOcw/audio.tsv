0	6980	With a couple exceptions.
6980	10940	So far, I've avoided talking about the Biden presidency on this channel, at least to any
10940	12260	real serious extent.
12260	13660	There's a few reasons for that.
13660	18020	The big one is that I'll probably do a large video on his slow collapse sometime in the
18020	19020	future.
19020	23820	But on a more practical level, a lot of this stuff is just flash in the pan news cycle
23820	25540	story of the day that doesn't really matter.
25540	26540	I got with this year.
26540	27540	This is a couple months ago.
27540	31060	Biden going to Delaware for a long weekend amid Afghanistan crisis.
31060	33260	Back when this was happening, people were really pissed off.
33260	37060	And yeah, we all know that it's irresponsible for a president to go on vacation during a
37060	38060	crisis.
38060	39060	But you know what?
39060	40060	Trump did it.
40060	41060	That was a big thing.
41060	42060	He was golfing all the time as stuff was going down.
42060	43060	Obama did it.
43060	46860	Hell, you guys remember the Bush years when George Bush was off having fun during Katrina?
46860	51100	I feel like the media puts these stories out not only because they're newsworthy, because
51100	55000	again they are, these politicians shouldn't be doing this, but because they know that
55000	57040	the outrage gets clicks.
57040	58720	And though by now we should be used to it.
58720	60040	This is not a partisan thing.
60040	64060	This does not show Biden to be a hack any more than any other president is.
64060	65360	They all do this.
65360	67760	But today's story, the let's go Brandon thing.
67760	71160	It is too funny to pass up here to start off.
71160	74080	I'm going to play this clip from a NASCAR event in October.
74080	76840	Thank you to all of our partners.
76840	80840	Oh my God, it's just such an unbelievable moment.
80840	89240	Brandon, you also told me, as you can hear the chants from the crowd, let's go Brandon.
89240	93680	Brandon, you told me you were going to kind of hang back those first two stages and just
93680	95080	watch and learn.
95080	97640	What did you learn that helped you there in those closing laps?
97640	105560	Oh my God, it was learning how each line didn't stay to one and everything shifted top to
105560	106760	bottom so much.
106760	109880	The racer she's interviewing is Brandon and I mean apparently he's doing well.
109920	112840	I don't know a single thing about NASCAR, so the crowd's shouting, let's go Brandon.
112840	117480	All right, but next I want you to check out this series of clips and let me know if you
117480	118480	notice something.
118480	122280	Another game day full of fuck Joe Biden chants.
148480	170200	Basically, as the coronavirus pandemic started to wind down and sports events began to open
170200	175360	up to public viewing again, crowds would repeatedly and spontaneously begin to chant, fuck Joe
175360	176360	Biden.
176360	179600	This generally happened at college football games, which makes sense to me because those
179600	182560	are most likely going to be college students watching them and we all know that college
182560	186480	students like to troll and rabble rouse and shit stir, so why not?
186480	190460	But it also happened at baseball and basketball games and also at various concerts.
190460	194960	People began to upload videos to TikTok and YouTube and Twitter where they would go viral
194960	196360	and so people kept doing it.
196360	197760	It became the newest meme.
197760	202480	So with all of this context, let's go back to that first NASCAR clip.
202480	212740	Listen to it again.
212740	215360	It's pretty easy to tell that they're saying fuck Joe Biden now, right?
215360	218480	Like I don't know if it's just me or if this is like a Yanny Laurel thing, like the dress
218480	221120	with the two different colors that change depending on who's viewing it.
221120	226120	But when I first saw this clip divorced of any context, it actually reasonably sounded
226120	228320	like it could be let's go Brandon.
228320	232080	But now that I know the context, I can hear clear as day, fuck Joe Biden.
232080	233480	And I'm pretty sure that's what it was.
233480	239500	Imagine being that poor NBC reporter having to talk to this guy over the roar of the crowd.
239500	242920	You're not even here for politics, you're here for sports and you got to play damage
242920	244380	control like this.
244380	247140	That's a, that's a big oof as the kids like to say.
247140	253480	And for a short while on social media, the phrase let's go Brandon was used by leftoids
253480	257840	to laugh at those who thought that the crowd could ever possibly say fuck Joe Biden because
257840	260160	Joe Biden's obviously really popular, right?
260160	266040	Like how, how delusional do you have to be to think that a crowd would ever say fuck
266040	267520	Joe Biden?
267520	273280	Obviously it was let's go Brandon, but that meaning got quickly overrun by the sheer wave
273280	279020	of people who decided to take the phrase let's go Brandon and basically appropriate it as
279020	280020	the new meme.
280020	282520	And as soon as it became obvious that people were rallying around it rather than being
282520	288700	shamed by it, it suddenly became the next evil thing coming out of the, the alt right,
288700	293500	the far right, the crypto America fascists like pepper, the frog and the okay ham symbol
293500	296140	and other dumb shit like that that we've seen over the years.
296140	297180	Like check this out.
297180	302740	A Southwest pilot said, let's go Brandon from the cockpit to audible gasps from passengers.
302740	304500	This is mega speak for fuck Biden.
304500	309280	I would have demanded to deplane immediately when we'll never fly Southwest air until they
309280	312980	ensure that mentally impaired pilots like this aren't allowed to fly.
312980	317860	I would absolutely love to see this person hold up a flight and then get arrested by
317860	320060	an air Marshall or something.
320060	321060	That's a federal offense.
321060	323620	You know, it even made its way into Congress.
323620	329240	They want you to help put America back where you found it and leave it the hell alone.
329240	330240	Let's go Brandon.
330240	331660	I yield back.
331660	332660	Uh huh.
332660	335300	Listen, you might want to leave this one to the shoulder and Elmer Fudd.
335300	338020	And speaking of embarrassment, this came out of my own country.
338020	342380	This is a formal notification that all government correspondence must be professional in nature
342380	344100	and approved by department heads.
344100	348820	The uses of colloquialism or sayings with intended double meaning or offense are strictly
348820	353340	prohibited in all means of correspondence and or communication, specifically the use
353340	354340	of the wording.
354340	358840	Let's go Brandon and any variation thereof under any circumstance is banned with a Canadian
358840	359840	public service.
359840	362960	So this is a letter that went out to Canadian government employees.
362960	364320	You can't say let's go Brandon.
364320	367720	Now that the phrase let's go, Brandon has been appropriated and turned into the next
367720	368720	alt right meme.
368720	373160	You, you can't say it, but at least American politicians don't mind leaning into it.
373160	396640	When you look at the Biden, the Brandon administration in terms of what look at the smile on this
396640	397640	guy's face.
397640	398640	He's having a good time with us.
398640	399640	Yes.
399640	400640	He knows it's rude.
400640	401640	Yes.
401640	402640	He knows it's a little bit cheeky.
403120	404880	It doesn't really make much sense, but you know what?
404880	405880	He's laughing.
405880	407520	The people in the crowd are laughing.
407520	409700	It shows a bit of humanity.
409700	410700	You know what I mean?
410700	414600	If you ever have to wonder why Republicans, you know, still win elections in 2021, it's
414600	417720	this it's because they appear to be real people.
417720	421560	And this let's go Brandon thing is kind of cut from the same cloth of a couple other
421560	426120	recent events surrounding Joe Biden that are just kind of weird and embarrassing.
426120	431440	I don't know if you guys if you guys caught this a few days ago, but trending in politics
431440	443360	on Twitter was hashtag poopy pants, Biden, all right, over on the daily dot, we've got
443360	449200	right wing conspiracy theorists claim Biden soiled himself at the Vatican, hashtag poopy
449200	452880	pants, Biden began trending on Twitter over the weekend.
452880	456160	See, it can't just be it can't just be fun anymore.
456160	457160	It can't just be goofiness.
457160	461400	It can't just be having a laugh the way that it was, you know, say 15 or 20 years ago.
461400	468240	Now it's right wing conspiracy theorists, those, those dreaded alt writers, and their
468240	469960	soiled pants theories.
469960	472200	So here's where it came from.
472200	478120	It's from a Miss Amy Tarkanian, who apparently works for some Republican apparatus somewhere.
478120	482120	The word around Rome is that Biden's meeting with the Pope was unusually long because Biden
482120	486240	had a bit of a bathroom accident at the Vatican, and it had to be addressed prior to him leaving.
486240	489680	I know we joke around often about this, but this is the actual rumor going around Rome
489680	490680	now.
490960	494280	The reason that this resonated with people is because one Biden's obviously old and kind
494280	495540	of infirm.
495540	500480	And two, there's been rumors of him taking anti dementia medication.
500480	501640	And there's I forget the name of it.
501640	506620	There's at least one type of anti dementia medication that causes diarrhea as as its
506620	507800	side effect.
507800	514320	This is a did I just shit myself face like, you don't have to be a political partisan
514320	516120	to be able to laugh at this stuff, right?
516120	519840	Like here, here, here's a giant picture of the of the event with all the various world
519840	521520	leaders and important people involved.
521520	522660	And look where Biden is.
522660	526120	He's not in the middle, as you would expect an American president to be.
526120	533020	He's way off on the left side, standing completely by himself with the the closest dude to him,
533020	540000	that black eye looking at him side eyed, and he's standing in a pose of I just shit myself.
540000	543680	And nobody wants to stand around me.
543680	548040	You'd think that some of these terminally online leftists would be able to laugh at
548040	549160	this stuff, right?
549160	551680	I don't care if Joe Biden shit in his pants.
551680	555720	I don't care if Joe Biden shit in my pants.
555720	559780	Donald Trump shit in America's mouth for over four years.
559780	562860	And every day he's not locked up behind bars.
562860	565580	He continues his oral defecation.
565580	567680	Fuck him and fuck you if you support him.
567680	570120	Hashtag poop gate.
570120	573180	Dude, chill out a little bit man.
573180	574860	You don't have to be on all the time.
574860	576080	You can have some fun.
576080	577860	This article also went viral.
577860	579420	This is about a month and a half ago.
579420	580920	It's not just dangerous.
580920	583540	Screaming fuck Biden may also be illegal.
583540	585540	Well, no, it's not.
585540	586540	That's the point of the first amendment.
586540	589740	And in fact, this article turned out to be fake because it doesn't stop you from actually
589740	590740	doing it.
590740	591740	This is a real article.
591740	592740	Now.
592740	595500	Judge says, fuck Biden signs are obscenity and it was their removal.
595500	596820	No, fuck you.
596820	597820	Fuck Biden.
597820	598820	And you know what?
598820	601720	When I say that I'm not even making any kind of grand claim about his presidency.
601720	604360	I'm just saying it because you say that I can't.
604360	606080	So what does all this sound like?
606080	610920	All these people freaking out that people might dare make fun of President Biden saying
610920	615880	things like, regardless of how you feel about Biden, the man, this is still the office of
615880	617080	the presidency.
617080	620480	Shouldn't you show some respect and have some decorum?
620480	626280	And this attitude is coming out of people who for four years did the same thing when
626280	627280	it was Trump.
627280	630840	We all remember that the fuck Trump days, right here, if I was going to go over every
630840	634520	single person who actually had this hypocrisy, we'd be here all day.
634520	636560	So I'll just give you the most obvious one.
636560	640160	Those who were saying, fuck Joe Biden are showing their hate and ignorance.
640160	643040	Oh, he says, F Joe Biden, actually.
643040	646000	Imagine hating a president who wants to improve your life.
646000	647000	Fuck Trump.
647000	648000	Yeah.
648000	649000	Yeah.
649000	651120	Imagine that, eh?
651120	653080	Imagine complaining about, let's go, Brandon.
653080	657880	Imagine having this entire fucking online meltdown without going through your own tweets
657880	660260	to delete all of the fuck Trump ones.
660260	664820	This is not how mature well-rounded people react to this sort of thing.
664820	667820	Everyone's losing their mind over the, over the poopy pants Biden thing.
667820	670420	They're saying, how dare you use the hashtag poop gate.
670420	674620	You have these hack journalists quickly writing up articles in defense like, Oh my God, how
674620	675620	could you say this about Biden?
675620	677380	But do you remember when this picture came out?
677380	680640	This obvious Photoshop of Donald Trump shitting himself while playing golf.
680640	686220	Did you see any of these triggered reactions come out of the right back in 2018 when protesters
686220	691740	projected fuck Trump onto a football stadium as president Trump himself arrived to the
691740	692740	stadium?
692740	697180	Did you see that reaction when they flew the Donald Trump baby blimp in the UK when Trump
697180	698780	was taking a trip over there?
698780	700740	Did you see these meltdowns come out of the right?
700740	701900	No, you didn't.
701900	703060	In fact, you know what you saw?
703060	707180	You saw a mix of two different reactions, one, rightoids being a good sport about it
707180	712300	and laughing and being able to laugh and two, rightoids laughing at the people who would
712300	715020	be petty enough to actually do this sort of stuff.
715020	717900	The same people who dished it out for four years.
717900	719640	Do you see them taking it now?
719640	721780	Do you see them rolling with the punches?
721780	722780	No.
722780	727060	Instead they're shitting themselves even worse than Biden is rumored to have done.
727060	730540	This is probably the most absurd take I've seen on this topic.
730540	733700	Let's Go Brandon has become the mega version of Sig Heil.
733700	737100	I want you to, to, to digest this one a little bit.
737100	738100	Okay.
738100	743140	Let's Go Brandon, a phrase which began to cover up the fact that the masses do not like
743140	745260	Joe Biden and were willing to say it on live TV.
745260	748740	They're willing to chant, fuck Joe Biden on live TV.
748740	754700	And then to try and cover that up, the cope that the newscaster came up with on the spot
754700	755700	was Let's Go Brandon.
755700	760360	And then for a short while, the phrase Let's Go Brandon became embraced by the left to
760360	762140	make fun of people who don't like Joe Biden.
762140	768140	And now that their own attempt to cover up the truth has been embraced by their opponents
768140	771600	and turned into a meme, now it's become Sig Heil.
771600	776240	They birthed their own Sig Heil that their opponents are using against them.
776240	780620	And they still wonder why everybody looks at them as if they're fucking insane.
780620	787320	You absolute moral lepers spent four years screeching about the pistachio about how he's
787320	791380	a Russian puppet, but how he's a Nazi, he's a fascist.
791380	794040	He's worse than Hitler, how he's running concentration camps.
794040	798880	Now he wants to kill all the non-whites in America and all of this absolutely crazy,
798880	799880	wild nonsense.
799880	803000	And then as soon as the shoe's on the other foot, as soon as it's your turn to get laughed
803000	808040	at a little bit, because now your guy's in office, you're like, oh my God, Let's Go Brandon.
808040	810720	What has happened to the decorum of politics?
810720	813480	But the truth is it was always this way.
813480	816880	We've always laughed at our politicians as we should.
816880	820040	We should always feel free to knock them down a peg or two.
820040	823000	Biden poops his pants, Trump poops his pants.
823000	827200	Biden falls down walking up the steps of Air Force One, George Bush gets a shoe thrown
827200	828200	at him.
828200	829960	It's happening to Biden right now.
829960	835040	The Let's Go Brandon stuff, the poopy pants stuff, even making fun of him like appearing
835040	836620	to fall asleep sometimes.
836620	838880	It is par for the course and it should be.
838880	844120	American political history is full of mocking political leaders, but the left has suddenly
844120	845920	decided that's no longer acceptable.
845920	850440	And the main reason why they view it as no longer acceptable is because they don't understand
850440	851640	the purpose behind it.
851640	855240	You make fun of your political leaders so that they don't become deified.
855240	857320	They are just humans like you and me.
857320	858680	That's why you do it.
858680	861080	That's why a free society allows it.
861080	863940	Because tyrannical societies always ban humor first.
863940	867480	But the left no longer understands that this is the purpose of it.
867480	870920	Because again, every space must be filled with their ideology.
870920	873820	Every moment is a moment to push their vision of progress.
873820	877040	You can't simply have downtime where you have a laugh.
877040	882760	The truth is leftists aren't really that mad that you're out there chanting Let's Go Brandon.
882760	884940	It annoys them, but that's not the big thing.
884940	890560	Leftists are mad because rightists are having fun even though their guy lost when the leftists
890560	894020	spent four years being constantly angry and joyless.
894020	895900	Alright my friends, that about does it for me.
895900	896900	Hope you enjoyed.
896900	900740	I might keep up this alternating of topics, you know, serious topic, goofy topic.
900740	902180	It's kind of fun to do things like this.
902180	906560	As always, Game Boomers tonight, be there or else you're banned.
906560	907560	I'll see you there guys.
907560	907580	I love you.
914940	915440	Bye.
