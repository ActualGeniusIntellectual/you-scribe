1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,980
With a couple exceptions.

2
00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:10,940
So far, I've avoided talking about the Biden presidency on this channel, at least to any

3
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:12,260
real serious extent.

4
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:13,660
There's a few reasons for that.

5
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:18,020
The big one is that I'll probably do a large video on his slow collapse sometime in the

6
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:19,020
future.

7
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:23,820
But on a more practical level, a lot of this stuff is just flash in the pan news cycle

8
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:25,540
story of the day that doesn't really matter.

9
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:26,540
I got with this year.

10
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:27,540
This is a couple months ago.

11
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:31,060
Biden going to Delaware for a long weekend amid Afghanistan crisis.

12
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:33,260
Back when this was happening, people were really pissed off.

13
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:37,060
And yeah, we all know that it's irresponsible for a president to go on vacation during a

14
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:38,060
crisis.

15
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:39,060
But you know what?

16
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:40,060
Trump did it.

17
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:41,060
That was a big thing.

18
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:42,060
He was golfing all the time as stuff was going down.

19
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:43,060
Obama did it.

20
00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:46,860
Hell, you guys remember the Bush years when George Bush was off having fun during Katrina?

21
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:51,100
I feel like the media puts these stories out not only because they're newsworthy, because

22
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:55,000
again they are, these politicians shouldn't be doing this, but because they know that

23
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,040
the outrage gets clicks.

24
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:58,720
And though by now we should be used to it.

25
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:00,040
This is not a partisan thing.

26
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:04,060
This does not show Biden to be a hack any more than any other president is.

27
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:05,360
They all do this.

28
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:07,760
But today's story, the let's go Brandon thing.

29
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:11,160
It is too funny to pass up here to start off.

30
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:14,080
I'm going to play this clip from a NASCAR event in October.

31
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:16,840
Thank you to all of our partners.

32
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:20,840
Oh my God, it's just such an unbelievable moment.

33
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:29,240
Brandon, you also told me, as you can hear the chants from the crowd, let's go Brandon.

34
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:33,680
Brandon, you told me you were going to kind of hang back those first two stages and just

35
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,080
watch and learn.

36
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:37,640
What did you learn that helped you there in those closing laps?

37
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:45,560
Oh my God, it was learning how each line didn't stay to one and everything shifted top to

38
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:46,760
bottom so much.

39
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:49,880
The racer she's interviewing is Brandon and I mean apparently he's doing well.

40
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,840
I don't know a single thing about NASCAR, so the crowd's shouting, let's go Brandon.

41
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:57,480
All right, but next I want you to check out this series of clips and let me know if you

42
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:58,480
notice something.

43
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:02,280
Another game day full of fuck Joe Biden chants.

44
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:50,200
Basically, as the coronavirus pandemic started to wind down and sports events began to open

45
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:55,360
up to public viewing again, crowds would repeatedly and spontaneously begin to chant, fuck Joe

46
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,360
Biden.

47
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:59,600
This generally happened at college football games, which makes sense to me because those

48
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:02,560
are most likely going to be college students watching them and we all know that college

49
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:06,480
students like to troll and rabble rouse and shit stir, so why not?

50
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:10,460
But it also happened at baseball and basketball games and also at various concerts.

51
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:14,960
People began to upload videos to TikTok and YouTube and Twitter where they would go viral

52
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,360
and so people kept doing it.

53
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,760
It became the newest meme.

54
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:22,480
So with all of this context, let's go back to that first NASCAR clip.

55
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:32,740
Listen to it again.

56
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:35,360
It's pretty easy to tell that they're saying fuck Joe Biden now, right?

57
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:38,480
Like I don't know if it's just me or if this is like a Yanny Laurel thing, like the dress

58
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:41,120
with the two different colors that change depending on who's viewing it.

59
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:46,120
But when I first saw this clip divorced of any context, it actually reasonably sounded

60
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:48,320
like it could be let's go Brandon.

61
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:52,080
But now that I know the context, I can hear clear as day, fuck Joe Biden.

62
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,480
And I'm pretty sure that's what it was.

63
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:59,500
Imagine being that poor NBC reporter having to talk to this guy over the roar of the crowd.

64
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:02,920
You're not even here for politics, you're here for sports and you got to play damage

65
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:04,380
control like this.

66
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:07,140
That's a, that's a big oof as the kids like to say.

67
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:13,480
And for a short while on social media, the phrase let's go Brandon was used by leftoids

68
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:17,840
to laugh at those who thought that the crowd could ever possibly say fuck Joe Biden because

69
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:20,160
Joe Biden's obviously really popular, right?

70
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:26,040
Like how, how delusional do you have to be to think that a crowd would ever say fuck

71
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,520
Joe Biden?

72
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:33,280
Obviously it was let's go Brandon, but that meaning got quickly overrun by the sheer wave

73
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:39,020
of people who decided to take the phrase let's go Brandon and basically appropriate it as

74
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:40,020
the new meme.

75
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:42,520
And as soon as it became obvious that people were rallying around it rather than being

76
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:48,700
shamed by it, it suddenly became the next evil thing coming out of the, the alt right,

77
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:53,500
the far right, the crypto America fascists like pepper, the frog and the okay ham symbol

78
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:56,140
and other dumb shit like that that we've seen over the years.

79
00:04:56,140 --> 00:04:57,180
Like check this out.

80
00:04:57,180 --> 00:05:02,740
A Southwest pilot said, let's go Brandon from the cockpit to audible gasps from passengers.

81
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:04,500
This is mega speak for fuck Biden.

82
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:09,280
I would have demanded to deplane immediately when we'll never fly Southwest air until they

83
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:12,980
ensure that mentally impaired pilots like this aren't allowed to fly.

84
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:17,860
I would absolutely love to see this person hold up a flight and then get arrested by

85
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:20,060
an air Marshall or something.

86
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:21,060
That's a federal offense.

87
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:23,620
You know, it even made its way into Congress.

88
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:29,240
They want you to help put America back where you found it and leave it the hell alone.

89
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,240
Let's go Brandon.

90
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,660
I yield back.

91
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:32,660
Uh huh.

92
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:35,300
Listen, you might want to leave this one to the shoulder and Elmer Fudd.

93
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:38,020
And speaking of embarrassment, this came out of my own country.

94
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:42,380
This is a formal notification that all government correspondence must be professional in nature

95
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:44,100
and approved by department heads.

96
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:48,820
The uses of colloquialism or sayings with intended double meaning or offense are strictly

97
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:53,340
prohibited in all means of correspondence and or communication, specifically the use

98
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:54,340
of the wording.

99
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:58,840
Let's go Brandon and any variation thereof under any circumstance is banned with a Canadian

100
00:05:58,840 --> 00:05:59,840
public service.

101
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:02,960
So this is a letter that went out to Canadian government employees.

102
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,320
You can't say let's go Brandon.

103
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:07,720
Now that the phrase let's go, Brandon has been appropriated and turned into the next

104
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:08,720
alt right meme.

105
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:13,160
You, you can't say it, but at least American politicians don't mind leaning into it.

106
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:36,640
When you look at the Biden, the Brandon administration in terms of what look at the smile on this

107
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:37,640
guy's face.

108
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:38,640
He's having a good time with us.

109
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:39,640
Yes.

110
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:40,640
He knows it's rude.

111
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:41,640
Yes.

112
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:42,640
He knows it's a little bit cheeky.

113
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,880
It doesn't really make much sense, but you know what?

114
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:45,880
He's laughing.

115
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:47,520
The people in the crowd are laughing.

116
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,700
It shows a bit of humanity.

117
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:50,700
You know what I mean?

118
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:54,600
If you ever have to wonder why Republicans, you know, still win elections in 2021, it's

119
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:57,720
this it's because they appear to be real people.

120
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:01,560
And this let's go Brandon thing is kind of cut from the same cloth of a couple other

121
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:06,120
recent events surrounding Joe Biden that are just kind of weird and embarrassing.

122
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:11,440
I don't know if you guys if you guys caught this a few days ago, but trending in politics

123
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:23,360
on Twitter was hashtag poopy pants, Biden, all right, over on the daily dot, we've got

124
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:29,200
right wing conspiracy theorists claim Biden soiled himself at the Vatican, hashtag poopy

125
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:32,880
pants, Biden began trending on Twitter over the weekend.

126
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:36,160
See, it can't just be it can't just be fun anymore.

127
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,160
It can't just be goofiness.

128
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:41,400
It can't just be having a laugh the way that it was, you know, say 15 or 20 years ago.

129
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:48,240
Now it's right wing conspiracy theorists, those, those dreaded alt writers, and their

130
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,960
soiled pants theories.

131
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:52,200
So here's where it came from.

132
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:58,120
It's from a Miss Amy Tarkanian, who apparently works for some Republican apparatus somewhere.

133
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:02,120
The word around Rome is that Biden's meeting with the Pope was unusually long because Biden

134
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:06,240
had a bit of a bathroom accident at the Vatican, and it had to be addressed prior to him leaving.

135
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:09,680
I know we joke around often about this, but this is the actual rumor going around Rome

136
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:10,680
now.

137
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:14,280
The reason that this resonated with people is because one Biden's obviously old and kind

138
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:15,540
of infirm.

139
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:20,480
And two, there's been rumors of him taking anti dementia medication.

140
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:21,640
And there's I forget the name of it.

141
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:26,620
There's at least one type of anti dementia medication that causes diarrhea as as its

142
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:27,800
side effect.

143
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:34,320
This is a did I just shit myself face like, you don't have to be a political partisan

144
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,120
to be able to laugh at this stuff, right?

145
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:39,840
Like here, here, here's a giant picture of the of the event with all the various world

146
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:41,520
leaders and important people involved.

147
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:42,660
And look where Biden is.

148
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:46,120
He's not in the middle, as you would expect an American president to be.

149
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:53,020
He's way off on the left side, standing completely by himself with the the closest dude to him,

150
00:08:53,020 --> 00:09:00,000
that black eye looking at him side eyed, and he's standing in a pose of I just shit myself.

151
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,680
And nobody wants to stand around me.

152
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:08,040
You'd think that some of these terminally online leftists would be able to laugh at

153
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:09,160
this stuff, right?

154
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:11,680
I don't care if Joe Biden shit in his pants.

155
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:15,720
I don't care if Joe Biden shit in my pants.

156
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:19,780
Donald Trump shit in America's mouth for over four years.

157
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:22,860
And every day he's not locked up behind bars.

158
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:25,580
He continues his oral defecation.

159
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:27,680
Fuck him and fuck you if you support him.

160
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:30,120
Hashtag poop gate.

161
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:33,180
Dude, chill out a little bit man.

162
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:34,860
You don't have to be on all the time.

163
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:36,080
You can have some fun.

164
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,860
This article also went viral.

165
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:39,420
This is about a month and a half ago.

166
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:40,920
It's not just dangerous.

167
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:43,540
Screaming fuck Biden may also be illegal.

168
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:45,540
Well, no, it's not.

169
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:46,540
That's the point of the first amendment.

170
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:49,740
And in fact, this article turned out to be fake because it doesn't stop you from actually

171
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:50,740
doing it.

172
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:51,740
This is a real article.

173
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:52,740
Now.

174
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:55,500
Judge says, fuck Biden signs are obscenity and it was their removal.

175
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:56,820
No, fuck you.

176
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:57,820
Fuck Biden.

177
00:09:57,820 --> 00:09:58,820
And you know what?

178
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:01,720
When I say that I'm not even making any kind of grand claim about his presidency.

179
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:04,360
I'm just saying it because you say that I can't.

180
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:06,080
So what does all this sound like?

181
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:10,920
All these people freaking out that people might dare make fun of President Biden saying

182
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:15,880
things like, regardless of how you feel about Biden, the man, this is still the office of

183
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:17,080
the presidency.

184
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:20,480
Shouldn't you show some respect and have some decorum?

185
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:26,280
And this attitude is coming out of people who for four years did the same thing when

186
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:27,280
it was Trump.

187
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:30,840
We all remember that the fuck Trump days, right here, if I was going to go over every

188
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:34,520
single person who actually had this hypocrisy, we'd be here all day.

189
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:36,560
So I'll just give you the most obvious one.

190
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:40,160
Those who were saying, fuck Joe Biden are showing their hate and ignorance.

191
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:43,040
Oh, he says, F Joe Biden, actually.

192
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:46,000
Imagine hating a president who wants to improve your life.

193
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Fuck Trump.

194
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Yeah.

195
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Yeah.

196
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,120
Imagine that, eh?

197
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:53,080
Imagine complaining about, let's go, Brandon.

198
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:57,880
Imagine having this entire fucking online meltdown without going through your own tweets

199
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:00,260
to delete all of the fuck Trump ones.

200
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:04,820
This is not how mature well-rounded people react to this sort of thing.

201
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:07,820
Everyone's losing their mind over the, over the poopy pants Biden thing.

202
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:10,420
They're saying, how dare you use the hashtag poop gate.

203
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:14,620
You have these hack journalists quickly writing up articles in defense like, Oh my God, how

204
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:15,620
could you say this about Biden?

205
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:17,380
But do you remember when this picture came out?

206
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:20,640
This obvious Photoshop of Donald Trump shitting himself while playing golf.

207
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:26,220
Did you see any of these triggered reactions come out of the right back in 2018 when protesters

208
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:31,740
projected fuck Trump onto a football stadium as president Trump himself arrived to the

209
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:32,740
stadium?

210
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:37,180
Did you see that reaction when they flew the Donald Trump baby blimp in the UK when Trump

211
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:38,780
was taking a trip over there?

212
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:40,740
Did you see these meltdowns come out of the right?

213
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:41,900
No, you didn't.

214
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:43,060
In fact, you know what you saw?

215
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:47,180
You saw a mix of two different reactions, one, rightoids being a good sport about it

216
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:52,300
and laughing and being able to laugh and two, rightoids laughing at the people who would

217
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:55,020
be petty enough to actually do this sort of stuff.

218
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:57,900
The same people who dished it out for four years.

219
00:11:57,900 --> 00:11:59,640
Do you see them taking it now?

220
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:01,780
Do you see them rolling with the punches?

221
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:02,780
No.

222
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:07,060
Instead they're shitting themselves even worse than Biden is rumored to have done.

223
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:10,540
This is probably the most absurd take I've seen on this topic.

224
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:13,700
Let's Go Brandon has become the mega version of Sig Heil.

225
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:17,100
I want you to, to, to digest this one a little bit.

226
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:18,100
Okay.

227
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:23,140
Let's Go Brandon, a phrase which began to cover up the fact that the masses do not like

228
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:25,260
Joe Biden and were willing to say it on live TV.

229
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:28,740
They're willing to chant, fuck Joe Biden on live TV.

230
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:34,700
And then to try and cover that up, the cope that the newscaster came up with on the spot

231
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:35,700
was Let's Go Brandon.

232
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:40,360
And then for a short while, the phrase Let's Go Brandon became embraced by the left to

233
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:42,140
make fun of people who don't like Joe Biden.

234
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:48,140
And now that their own attempt to cover up the truth has been embraced by their opponents

235
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:51,600
and turned into a meme, now it's become Sig Heil.

236
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:56,240
They birthed their own Sig Heil that their opponents are using against them.

237
00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:00,620
And they still wonder why everybody looks at them as if they're fucking insane.

238
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:07,320
You absolute moral lepers spent four years screeching about the pistachio about how he's

239
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:11,380
a Russian puppet, but how he's a Nazi, he's a fascist.

240
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:14,040
He's worse than Hitler, how he's running concentration camps.

241
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:18,880
Now he wants to kill all the non-whites in America and all of this absolutely crazy,

242
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:19,880
wild nonsense.

243
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:23,000
And then as soon as the shoe's on the other foot, as soon as it's your turn to get laughed

244
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:28,040
at a little bit, because now your guy's in office, you're like, oh my God, Let's Go Brandon.

245
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:30,720
What has happened to the decorum of politics?

246
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:33,480
But the truth is it was always this way.

247
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:36,880
We've always laughed at our politicians as we should.

248
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:40,040
We should always feel free to knock them down a peg or two.

249
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:43,000
Biden poops his pants, Trump poops his pants.

250
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:47,200
Biden falls down walking up the steps of Air Force One, George Bush gets a shoe thrown

251
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,200
at him.

252
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,960
It's happening to Biden right now.

253
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:55,040
The Let's Go Brandon stuff, the poopy pants stuff, even making fun of him like appearing

254
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:56,620
to fall asleep sometimes.

255
00:13:56,620 --> 00:13:58,880
It is par for the course and it should be.

256
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:04,120
American political history is full of mocking political leaders, but the left has suddenly

257
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:05,920
decided that's no longer acceptable.

258
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:10,440
And the main reason why they view it as no longer acceptable is because they don't understand

259
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:11,640
the purpose behind it.

260
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:15,240
You make fun of your political leaders so that they don't become deified.

261
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:17,320
They are just humans like you and me.

262
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:18,680
That's why you do it.

263
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:21,080
That's why a free society allows it.

264
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:23,940
Because tyrannical societies always ban humor first.

265
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:27,480
But the left no longer understands that this is the purpose of it.

266
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:30,920
Because again, every space must be filled with their ideology.

267
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:33,820
Every moment is a moment to push their vision of progress.

268
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:37,040
You can't simply have downtime where you have a laugh.

269
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:42,760
The truth is leftists aren't really that mad that you're out there chanting Let's Go Brandon.

270
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:44,940
It annoys them, but that's not the big thing.

271
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:50,560
Leftists are mad because rightists are having fun even though their guy lost when the leftists

272
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:54,020
spent four years being constantly angry and joyless.

273
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:55,900
Alright my friends, that about does it for me.

274
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:56,900
Hope you enjoyed.

275
00:14:56,900 --> 00:15:00,740
I might keep up this alternating of topics, you know, serious topic, goofy topic.

276
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:02,180
It's kind of fun to do things like this.

277
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:06,560
As always, Game Boomers tonight, be there or else you're banned.

278
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:07,560
I'll see you there guys.

279
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:07,580
I love you.

280
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:15,440
Bye.
