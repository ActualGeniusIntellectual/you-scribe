WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:06.980
With a couple exceptions.

00:06.980 --> 00:10.940
So far, I've avoided talking about the Biden presidency on this channel, at least to any

00:10.940 --> 00:12.260
real serious extent.

00:12.260 --> 00:13.660
There's a few reasons for that.

00:13.660 --> 00:18.020
The big one is that I'll probably do a large video on his slow collapse sometime in the

00:18.020 --> 00:19.020
future.

00:19.020 --> 00:23.820
But on a more practical level, a lot of this stuff is just flash in the pan news cycle

00:23.820 --> 00:25.540
story of the day that doesn't really matter.

00:25.540 --> 00:26.540
I got with this year.

00:26.540 --> 00:27.540
This is a couple months ago.

00:27.540 --> 00:31.060
Biden going to Delaware for a long weekend amid Afghanistan crisis.

00:31.060 --> 00:33.260
Back when this was happening, people were really pissed off.

00:33.260 --> 00:37.060
And yeah, we all know that it's irresponsible for a president to go on vacation during a

00:37.060 --> 00:38.060
crisis.

00:38.060 --> 00:39.060
But you know what?

00:39.060 --> 00:40.060
Trump did it.

00:40.060 --> 00:41.060
That was a big thing.

00:41.060 --> 00:42.060
He was golfing all the time as stuff was going down.

00:42.060 --> 00:43.060
Obama did it.

00:43.060 --> 00:46.860
Hell, you guys remember the Bush years when George Bush was off having fun during Katrina?

00:46.860 --> 00:51.100
I feel like the media puts these stories out not only because they're newsworthy, because

00:51.100 --> 00:55.000
again they are, these politicians shouldn't be doing this, but because they know that

00:55.000 --> 00:57.040
the outrage gets clicks.

00:57.040 --> 00:58.720
And though by now we should be used to it.

00:58.720 --> 01:00.040
This is not a partisan thing.

01:00.040 --> 01:04.060
This does not show Biden to be a hack any more than any other president is.

01:04.060 --> 01:05.360
They all do this.

01:05.360 --> 01:07.760
But today's story, the let's go Brandon thing.

01:07.760 --> 01:11.160
It is too funny to pass up here to start off.

01:11.160 --> 01:14.080
I'm going to play this clip from a NASCAR event in October.

01:14.080 --> 01:16.840
Thank you to all of our partners.

01:16.840 --> 01:20.840
Oh my God, it's just such an unbelievable moment.

01:20.840 --> 01:29.240
Brandon, you also told me, as you can hear the chants from the crowd, let's go Brandon.

01:29.240 --> 01:33.680
Brandon, you told me you were going to kind of hang back those first two stages and just

01:33.680 --> 01:35.080
watch and learn.

01:35.080 --> 01:37.640
What did you learn that helped you there in those closing laps?

01:37.640 --> 01:45.560
Oh my God, it was learning how each line didn't stay to one and everything shifted top to

01:45.560 --> 01:46.760
bottom so much.

01:46.760 --> 01:49.880
The racer she's interviewing is Brandon and I mean apparently he's doing well.

01:49.920 --> 01:52.840
I don't know a single thing about NASCAR, so the crowd's shouting, let's go Brandon.

01:52.840 --> 01:57.480
All right, but next I want you to check out this series of clips and let me know if you

01:57.480 --> 01:58.480
notice something.

01:58.480 --> 02:02.280
Another game day full of fuck Joe Biden chants.

02:28.480 --> 02:50.200
Basically, as the coronavirus pandemic started to wind down and sports events began to open

02:50.200 --> 02:55.360
up to public viewing again, crowds would repeatedly and spontaneously begin to chant, fuck Joe

02:55.360 --> 02:56.360
Biden.

02:56.360 --> 02:59.600
This generally happened at college football games, which makes sense to me because those

02:59.600 --> 03:02.560
are most likely going to be college students watching them and we all know that college

03:02.560 --> 03:06.480
students like to troll and rabble rouse and shit stir, so why not?

03:06.480 --> 03:10.460
But it also happened at baseball and basketball games and also at various concerts.

03:10.460 --> 03:14.960
People began to upload videos to TikTok and YouTube and Twitter where they would go viral

03:14.960 --> 03:16.360
and so people kept doing it.

03:16.360 --> 03:17.760
It became the newest meme.

03:17.760 --> 03:22.480
So with all of this context, let's go back to that first NASCAR clip.

03:22.480 --> 03:32.740
Listen to it again.

03:32.740 --> 03:35.360
It's pretty easy to tell that they're saying fuck Joe Biden now, right?

03:35.360 --> 03:38.480
Like I don't know if it's just me or if this is like a Yanny Laurel thing, like the dress

03:38.480 --> 03:41.120
with the two different colors that change depending on who's viewing it.

03:41.120 --> 03:46.120
But when I first saw this clip divorced of any context, it actually reasonably sounded

03:46.120 --> 03:48.320
like it could be let's go Brandon.

03:48.320 --> 03:52.080
But now that I know the context, I can hear clear as day, fuck Joe Biden.

03:52.080 --> 03:53.480
And I'm pretty sure that's what it was.

03:53.480 --> 03:59.500
Imagine being that poor NBC reporter having to talk to this guy over the roar of the crowd.

03:59.500 --> 04:02.920
You're not even here for politics, you're here for sports and you got to play damage

04:02.920 --> 04:04.380
control like this.

04:04.380 --> 04:07.140
That's a, that's a big oof as the kids like to say.

04:07.140 --> 04:13.480
And for a short while on social media, the phrase let's go Brandon was used by leftoids

04:13.480 --> 04:17.840
to laugh at those who thought that the crowd could ever possibly say fuck Joe Biden because

04:17.840 --> 04:20.160
Joe Biden's obviously really popular, right?

04:20.160 --> 04:26.040
Like how, how delusional do you have to be to think that a crowd would ever say fuck

04:26.040 --> 04:27.520
Joe Biden?

04:27.520 --> 04:33.280
Obviously it was let's go Brandon, but that meaning got quickly overrun by the sheer wave

04:33.280 --> 04:39.020
of people who decided to take the phrase let's go Brandon and basically appropriate it as

04:39.020 --> 04:40.020
the new meme.

04:40.020 --> 04:42.520
And as soon as it became obvious that people were rallying around it rather than being

04:42.520 --> 04:48.700
shamed by it, it suddenly became the next evil thing coming out of the, the alt right,

04:48.700 --> 04:53.500
the far right, the crypto America fascists like pepper, the frog and the okay ham symbol

04:53.500 --> 04:56.140
and other dumb shit like that that we've seen over the years.

04:56.140 --> 04:57.180
Like check this out.

04:57.180 --> 05:02.740
A Southwest pilot said, let's go Brandon from the cockpit to audible gasps from passengers.

05:02.740 --> 05:04.500
This is mega speak for fuck Biden.

05:04.500 --> 05:09.280
I would have demanded to deplane immediately when we'll never fly Southwest air until they

05:09.280 --> 05:12.980
ensure that mentally impaired pilots like this aren't allowed to fly.

05:12.980 --> 05:17.860
I would absolutely love to see this person hold up a flight and then get arrested by

05:17.860 --> 05:20.060
an air Marshall or something.

05:20.060 --> 05:21.060
That's a federal offense.

05:21.060 --> 05:23.620
You know, it even made its way into Congress.

05:23.620 --> 05:29.240
They want you to help put America back where you found it and leave it the hell alone.

05:29.240 --> 05:30.240
Let's go Brandon.

05:30.240 --> 05:31.660
I yield back.

05:31.660 --> 05:32.660
Uh huh.

05:32.660 --> 05:35.300
Listen, you might want to leave this one to the shoulder and Elmer Fudd.

05:35.300 --> 05:38.020
And speaking of embarrassment, this came out of my own country.

05:38.020 --> 05:42.380
This is a formal notification that all government correspondence must be professional in nature

05:42.380 --> 05:44.100
and approved by department heads.

05:44.100 --> 05:48.820
The uses of colloquialism or sayings with intended double meaning or offense are strictly

05:48.820 --> 05:53.340
prohibited in all means of correspondence and or communication, specifically the use

05:53.340 --> 05:54.340
of the wording.

05:54.340 --> 05:58.840
Let's go Brandon and any variation thereof under any circumstance is banned with a Canadian

05:58.840 --> 05:59.840
public service.

05:59.840 --> 06:02.960
So this is a letter that went out to Canadian government employees.

06:02.960 --> 06:04.320
You can't say let's go Brandon.

06:04.320 --> 06:07.720
Now that the phrase let's go, Brandon has been appropriated and turned into the next

06:07.720 --> 06:08.720
alt right meme.

06:08.720 --> 06:13.160
You, you can't say it, but at least American politicians don't mind leaning into it.

06:13.160 --> 06:36.640
When you look at the Biden, the Brandon administration in terms of what look at the smile on this

06:36.640 --> 06:37.640
guy's face.

06:37.640 --> 06:38.640
He's having a good time with us.

06:38.640 --> 06:39.640
Yes.

06:39.640 --> 06:40.640
He knows it's rude.

06:40.640 --> 06:41.640
Yes.

06:41.640 --> 06:42.640
He knows it's a little bit cheeky.

06:43.120 --> 06:44.880
It doesn't really make much sense, but you know what?

06:44.880 --> 06:45.880
He's laughing.

06:45.880 --> 06:47.520
The people in the crowd are laughing.

06:47.520 --> 06:49.700
It shows a bit of humanity.

06:49.700 --> 06:50.700
You know what I mean?

06:50.700 --> 06:54.600
If you ever have to wonder why Republicans, you know, still win elections in 2021, it's

06:54.600 --> 06:57.720
this it's because they appear to be real people.

06:57.720 --> 07:01.560
And this let's go Brandon thing is kind of cut from the same cloth of a couple other

07:01.560 --> 07:06.120
recent events surrounding Joe Biden that are just kind of weird and embarrassing.

07:06.120 --> 07:11.440
I don't know if you guys if you guys caught this a few days ago, but trending in politics

07:11.440 --> 07:23.360
on Twitter was hashtag poopy pants, Biden, all right, over on the daily dot, we've got

07:23.360 --> 07:29.200
right wing conspiracy theorists claim Biden soiled himself at the Vatican, hashtag poopy

07:29.200 --> 07:32.880
pants, Biden began trending on Twitter over the weekend.

07:32.880 --> 07:36.160
See, it can't just be it can't just be fun anymore.

07:36.160 --> 07:37.160
It can't just be goofiness.

07:37.160 --> 07:41.400
It can't just be having a laugh the way that it was, you know, say 15 or 20 years ago.

07:41.400 --> 07:48.240
Now it's right wing conspiracy theorists, those, those dreaded alt writers, and their

07:48.240 --> 07:49.960
soiled pants theories.

07:49.960 --> 07:52.200
So here's where it came from.

07:52.200 --> 07:58.120
It's from a Miss Amy Tarkanian, who apparently works for some Republican apparatus somewhere.

07:58.120 --> 08:02.120
The word around Rome is that Biden's meeting with the Pope was unusually long because Biden

08:02.120 --> 08:06.240
had a bit of a bathroom accident at the Vatican, and it had to be addressed prior to him leaving.

08:06.240 --> 08:09.680
I know we joke around often about this, but this is the actual rumor going around Rome

08:09.680 --> 08:10.680
now.

08:10.960 --> 08:14.280
The reason that this resonated with people is because one Biden's obviously old and kind

08:14.280 --> 08:15.540
of infirm.

08:15.540 --> 08:20.480
And two, there's been rumors of him taking anti dementia medication.

08:20.480 --> 08:21.640
And there's I forget the name of it.

08:21.640 --> 08:26.620
There's at least one type of anti dementia medication that causes diarrhea as as its

08:26.620 --> 08:27.800
side effect.

08:27.800 --> 08:34.320
This is a did I just shit myself face like, you don't have to be a political partisan

08:34.320 --> 08:36.120
to be able to laugh at this stuff, right?

08:36.120 --> 08:39.840
Like here, here, here's a giant picture of the of the event with all the various world

08:39.840 --> 08:41.520
leaders and important people involved.

08:41.520 --> 08:42.660
And look where Biden is.

08:42.660 --> 08:46.120
He's not in the middle, as you would expect an American president to be.

08:46.120 --> 08:53.020
He's way off on the left side, standing completely by himself with the the closest dude to him,

08:53.020 --> 09:00.000
that black eye looking at him side eyed, and he's standing in a pose of I just shit myself.

09:00.000 --> 09:03.680
And nobody wants to stand around me.

09:03.680 --> 09:08.040
You'd think that some of these terminally online leftists would be able to laugh at

09:08.040 --> 09:09.160
this stuff, right?

09:09.160 --> 09:11.680
I don't care if Joe Biden shit in his pants.

09:11.680 --> 09:15.720
I don't care if Joe Biden shit in my pants.

09:15.720 --> 09:19.780
Donald Trump shit in America's mouth for over four years.

09:19.780 --> 09:22.860
And every day he's not locked up behind bars.

09:22.860 --> 09:25.580
He continues his oral defecation.

09:25.580 --> 09:27.680
Fuck him and fuck you if you support him.

09:27.680 --> 09:30.120
Hashtag poop gate.

09:30.120 --> 09:33.180
Dude, chill out a little bit man.

09:33.180 --> 09:34.860
You don't have to be on all the time.

09:34.860 --> 09:36.080
You can have some fun.

09:36.080 --> 09:37.860
This article also went viral.

09:37.860 --> 09:39.420
This is about a month and a half ago.

09:39.420 --> 09:40.920
It's not just dangerous.

09:40.920 --> 09:43.540
Screaming fuck Biden may also be illegal.

09:43.540 --> 09:45.540
Well, no, it's not.

09:45.540 --> 09:46.540
That's the point of the first amendment.

09:46.540 --> 09:49.740
And in fact, this article turned out to be fake because it doesn't stop you from actually

09:49.740 --> 09:50.740
doing it.

09:50.740 --> 09:51.740
This is a real article.

09:51.740 --> 09:52.740
Now.

09:52.740 --> 09:55.500
Judge says, fuck Biden signs are obscenity and it was their removal.

09:55.500 --> 09:56.820
No, fuck you.

09:56.820 --> 09:57.820
Fuck Biden.

09:57.820 --> 09:58.820
And you know what?

09:58.820 --> 10:01.720
When I say that I'm not even making any kind of grand claim about his presidency.

10:01.720 --> 10:04.360
I'm just saying it because you say that I can't.

10:04.360 --> 10:06.080
So what does all this sound like?

10:06.080 --> 10:10.920
All these people freaking out that people might dare make fun of President Biden saying

10:10.920 --> 10:15.880
things like, regardless of how you feel about Biden, the man, this is still the office of

10:15.880 --> 10:17.080
the presidency.

10:17.080 --> 10:20.480
Shouldn't you show some respect and have some decorum?

10:20.480 --> 10:26.280
And this attitude is coming out of people who for four years did the same thing when

10:26.280 --> 10:27.280
it was Trump.

10:27.280 --> 10:30.840
We all remember that the fuck Trump days, right here, if I was going to go over every

10:30.840 --> 10:34.520
single person who actually had this hypocrisy, we'd be here all day.

10:34.520 --> 10:36.560
So I'll just give you the most obvious one.

10:36.560 --> 10:40.160
Those who were saying, fuck Joe Biden are showing their hate and ignorance.

10:40.160 --> 10:43.040
Oh, he says, F Joe Biden, actually.

10:43.040 --> 10:46.000
Imagine hating a president who wants to improve your life.

10:46.000 --> 10:47.000
Fuck Trump.

10:47.000 --> 10:48.000
Yeah.

10:48.000 --> 10:49.000
Yeah.

10:49.000 --> 10:51.120
Imagine that, eh?

10:51.120 --> 10:53.080
Imagine complaining about, let's go, Brandon.

10:53.080 --> 10:57.880
Imagine having this entire fucking online meltdown without going through your own tweets

10:57.880 --> 11:00.260
to delete all of the fuck Trump ones.

11:00.260 --> 11:04.820
This is not how mature well-rounded people react to this sort of thing.

11:04.820 --> 11:07.820
Everyone's losing their mind over the, over the poopy pants Biden thing.

11:07.820 --> 11:10.420
They're saying, how dare you use the hashtag poop gate.

11:10.420 --> 11:14.620
You have these hack journalists quickly writing up articles in defense like, Oh my God, how

11:14.620 --> 11:15.620
could you say this about Biden?

11:15.620 --> 11:17.380
But do you remember when this picture came out?

11:17.380 --> 11:20.640
This obvious Photoshop of Donald Trump shitting himself while playing golf.

11:20.640 --> 11:26.220
Did you see any of these triggered reactions come out of the right back in 2018 when protesters

11:26.220 --> 11:31.740
projected fuck Trump onto a football stadium as president Trump himself arrived to the

11:31.740 --> 11:32.740
stadium?

11:32.740 --> 11:37.180
Did you see that reaction when they flew the Donald Trump baby blimp in the UK when Trump

11:37.180 --> 11:38.780
was taking a trip over there?

11:38.780 --> 11:40.740
Did you see these meltdowns come out of the right?

11:40.740 --> 11:41.900
No, you didn't.

11:41.900 --> 11:43.060
In fact, you know what you saw?

11:43.060 --> 11:47.180
You saw a mix of two different reactions, one, rightoids being a good sport about it

11:47.180 --> 11:52.300
and laughing and being able to laugh and two, rightoids laughing at the people who would

11:52.300 --> 11:55.020
be petty enough to actually do this sort of stuff.

11:55.020 --> 11:57.900
The same people who dished it out for four years.

11:57.900 --> 11:59.640
Do you see them taking it now?

11:59.640 --> 12:01.780
Do you see them rolling with the punches?

12:01.780 --> 12:02.780
No.

12:02.780 --> 12:07.060
Instead they're shitting themselves even worse than Biden is rumored to have done.

12:07.060 --> 12:10.540
This is probably the most absurd take I've seen on this topic.

12:10.540 --> 12:13.700
Let's Go Brandon has become the mega version of Sig Heil.

12:13.700 --> 12:17.100
I want you to, to, to digest this one a little bit.

12:17.100 --> 12:18.100
Okay.

12:18.100 --> 12:23.140
Let's Go Brandon, a phrase which began to cover up the fact that the masses do not like

12:23.140 --> 12:25.260
Joe Biden and were willing to say it on live TV.

12:25.260 --> 12:28.740
They're willing to chant, fuck Joe Biden on live TV.

12:28.740 --> 12:34.700
And then to try and cover that up, the cope that the newscaster came up with on the spot

12:34.700 --> 12:35.700
was Let's Go Brandon.

12:35.700 --> 12:40.360
And then for a short while, the phrase Let's Go Brandon became embraced by the left to

12:40.360 --> 12:42.140
make fun of people who don't like Joe Biden.

12:42.140 --> 12:48.140
And now that their own attempt to cover up the truth has been embraced by their opponents

12:48.140 --> 12:51.600
and turned into a meme, now it's become Sig Heil.

12:51.600 --> 12:56.240
They birthed their own Sig Heil that their opponents are using against them.

12:56.240 --> 13:00.620
And they still wonder why everybody looks at them as if they're fucking insane.

13:00.620 --> 13:07.320
You absolute moral lepers spent four years screeching about the pistachio about how he's

13:07.320 --> 13:11.380
a Russian puppet, but how he's a Nazi, he's a fascist.

13:11.380 --> 13:14.040
He's worse than Hitler, how he's running concentration camps.

13:14.040 --> 13:18.880
Now he wants to kill all the non-whites in America and all of this absolutely crazy,

13:18.880 --> 13:19.880
wild nonsense.

13:19.880 --> 13:23.000
And then as soon as the shoe's on the other foot, as soon as it's your turn to get laughed

13:23.000 --> 13:28.040
at a little bit, because now your guy's in office, you're like, oh my God, Let's Go Brandon.

13:28.040 --> 13:30.720
What has happened to the decorum of politics?

13:30.720 --> 13:33.480
But the truth is it was always this way.

13:33.480 --> 13:36.880
We've always laughed at our politicians as we should.

13:36.880 --> 13:40.040
We should always feel free to knock them down a peg or two.

13:40.040 --> 13:43.000
Biden poops his pants, Trump poops his pants.

13:43.000 --> 13:47.200
Biden falls down walking up the steps of Air Force One, George Bush gets a shoe thrown

13:47.200 --> 13:48.200
at him.

13:48.200 --> 13:49.960
It's happening to Biden right now.

13:49.960 --> 13:55.040
The Let's Go Brandon stuff, the poopy pants stuff, even making fun of him like appearing

13:55.040 --> 13:56.620
to fall asleep sometimes.

13:56.620 --> 13:58.880
It is par for the course and it should be.

13:58.880 --> 14:04.120
American political history is full of mocking political leaders, but the left has suddenly

14:04.120 --> 14:05.920
decided that's no longer acceptable.

14:05.920 --> 14:10.440
And the main reason why they view it as no longer acceptable is because they don't understand

14:10.440 --> 14:11.640
the purpose behind it.

14:11.640 --> 14:15.240
You make fun of your political leaders so that they don't become deified.

14:15.240 --> 14:17.320
They are just humans like you and me.

14:17.320 --> 14:18.680
That's why you do it.

14:18.680 --> 14:21.080
That's why a free society allows it.

14:21.080 --> 14:23.940
Because tyrannical societies always ban humor first.

14:23.940 --> 14:27.480
But the left no longer understands that this is the purpose of it.

14:27.480 --> 14:30.920
Because again, every space must be filled with their ideology.

14:30.920 --> 14:33.820
Every moment is a moment to push their vision of progress.

14:33.820 --> 14:37.040
You can't simply have downtime where you have a laugh.

14:37.040 --> 14:42.760
The truth is leftists aren't really that mad that you're out there chanting Let's Go Brandon.

14:42.760 --> 14:44.940
It annoys them, but that's not the big thing.

14:44.940 --> 14:50.560
Leftists are mad because rightists are having fun even though their guy lost when the leftists

14:50.560 --> 14:54.020
spent four years being constantly angry and joyless.

14:54.020 --> 14:55.900
Alright my friends, that about does it for me.

14:55.900 --> 14:56.900
Hope you enjoyed.

14:56.900 --> 15:00.740
I might keep up this alternating of topics, you know, serious topic, goofy topic.

15:00.740 --> 15:02.180
It's kind of fun to do things like this.

15:02.180 --> 15:06.560
As always, Game Boomers tonight, be there or else you're banned.

15:06.560 --> 15:07.560
I'll see you there guys.

15:07.560 --> 15:07.580
I love you.

15:14.940 --> 15:15.440
Bye.
