00:00.000 --> 00:09.640
I recently had a conversation with Lilith about the whole don't say gay thing that's

00:09.640 --> 00:10.640
happening right now.

00:10.640 --> 00:13.160
No, not in the tubcast, this was an offline talk.

00:13.160 --> 00:17.020
Being trans, she took up the unapologetically pro-trans position, which I don't completely

00:17.020 --> 00:18.020
agree with.

00:18.020 --> 00:20.120
I'm not faulting her for it, it's an issue close to her heart.

00:20.120 --> 00:23.520
I might be the same way if I were in her shoes, but I wanted to look at the topic as objectively

00:23.520 --> 00:24.520
as I can.

00:24.520 --> 00:28.600
And, spoiler alert, yeah, we're going to discover that neither side is exactly correct.

00:28.600 --> 00:29.780
So let's get into it.

00:29.780 --> 00:33.900
Florida's Parental Rights in Education Act, labeled as the Don't Say Gay Bill by

00:33.900 --> 00:38.720
its critics, is a recently passed law that outlines new statutes for primary education

00:38.720 --> 00:41.920
insofar as sexual orientation and gender identity is concerned.

00:41.920 --> 00:45.460
The bill prohibits the discussion of these topics in a classroom setting from kindergarten

00:45.460 --> 00:46.460
to grade three.

00:46.460 --> 00:47.460
That's nine years old.

00:47.460 --> 00:49.880
Naturally, this topic has got everybody's panties in a bunch.

00:49.880 --> 00:52.760
Leftoids are screaming that this is homophobic and transphobic and it's going to result

00:52.760 --> 00:54.340
in the deaths of trans kids.

00:54.340 --> 00:57.380
Rightoids are screeching that this is necessary because the school system is inundated with

00:57.380 --> 01:01.060
LGBT groomers who are pushing trans ideology onto impressionable children.

01:01.060 --> 01:05.140
The funny thing is, everyone could just calm down and go read the bill and figure it out

01:05.140 --> 01:06.140
for themselves.

01:06.140 --> 01:08.980
It's not some omnibus legislation that's over 9000 pages.

01:08.980 --> 01:09.980
It's seven pages long.

01:09.980 --> 01:12.280
I'll leave it in the description if you want to read it yourself, but let's go over

01:12.280 --> 01:13.280
the pertinent points.

01:13.280 --> 01:15.780
The first point of contention is paragraph three.

01:15.780 --> 01:19.820
Paragraphs one and two are basically blanket statements that schools have an obligation

01:19.820 --> 01:23.680
to inform parents about a change in a student's health and, for the most part, leave those

01:23.680 --> 01:26.160
health-related decisions in the hands of parents.

01:26.160 --> 01:30.140
Paragraph three reads, Classroom instruction by school personnel or third parties on sexual

01:30.140 --> 01:34.920
orientation or gender identity may not occur in kindergarten through grade three or in

01:34.920 --> 01:39.080
a manner that is not age-appropriate or developmentally appropriate for students in accordance with

01:39.080 --> 01:40.080
state standards.

01:40.080 --> 01:41.080
That's it.

01:41.080 --> 01:44.200
This is the bit of the legislation that went viral, that discussions on sexual orientation

01:44.200 --> 01:46.760
or gender identity can't happen at all before grade four.

01:46.760 --> 01:49.760
This is what opponents of the bill are calling Don't Say Gay.

01:49.760 --> 01:51.600
So let's examine their criticisms.

01:51.600 --> 01:54.240
Firstly, there's the moniker, Don't Say Gay.

01:54.240 --> 01:57.600
Everything in the wording of this bill mentions gay or homosexual.

01:57.600 --> 01:59.460
It just says sexual orientation.

01:59.460 --> 02:02.600
That also means that you could just as easily call it the Don't Say Straight Bill.

02:02.600 --> 02:06.640
The immediate counterargument to this is that heterosexuality is pretty normalized in society

02:06.640 --> 02:10.400
over homosexuality, even now, and yeah, that's true, but it's also a necessary part of

02:10.400 --> 02:12.280
being a reproducing species.

02:12.280 --> 02:16.080
Young kids might not know what sex is, but for example, they'll be in the grocery store

02:16.080 --> 02:20.160
with their parents and see other heterosexual couples with their kids together.

02:20.160 --> 02:24.060
Heterosexuality is common and necessary, so it does naturally lead to an early understanding

02:24.060 --> 02:26.340
of the idea, even if they don't know about sex.

02:26.340 --> 02:29.900
And it's also very common to see situations like a kid sees a teacher with his wedding

02:29.900 --> 02:32.740
photo on his desk and asks about it, and the teacher says that's his wife.

02:32.740 --> 02:36.680
Or a situation where a kid overhears their young female teacher saying to a colleague

02:36.680 --> 02:40.420
that she's going on a date that night, and all the kids go, ooh, like dumb kids do.

02:40.420 --> 02:41.780
This is all stuff I'm sure we can remember happening.

02:41.780 --> 02:42.780
None of it's bad.

02:42.780 --> 02:46.740
It's all normal, even positive behavior, and it's all predicated on at least a basic

02:46.740 --> 02:50.400
understanding of heterosexuality, even though at that age, kids wouldn't use that word

02:50.400 --> 02:51.400
to describe it.

02:51.400 --> 02:54.520
These normal behaviors might be made illegal under this bill, and I don't think it's

02:54.520 --> 02:55.520
a good thing.

02:55.520 --> 02:59.640
Secondly, a lot of progressives view the second half of paragraph three to be the weasel words

02:59.640 --> 03:02.700
that allow schools to blanket ban all talk of sexuality.

03:02.700 --> 03:06.720
Those words are, or in a manner that is not age-appropriate or developmentally appropriate

03:06.720 --> 03:08.840
for students in accordance with state standards.

03:08.840 --> 03:12.520
The obvious question here is, who is to say what is age-appropriate or developmentally

03:12.520 --> 03:13.520
appropriate?

03:13.520 --> 03:16.960
What if the powers that be are all a bunch of pearl-clutching Christian moms who don't

03:16.960 --> 03:19.520
want their 17-year-olds to be taught about the existence of sex?

03:19.520 --> 03:21.400
That seems kind of ridiculous to me, doesn't it?

03:21.400 --> 03:22.960
Well, this is a wider issue.

03:22.960 --> 03:25.040
It's with the very concept of law.

03:25.040 --> 03:28.640
Almost every law, if you dig deep enough, has a bit written into it where it says, as

03:28.640 --> 03:30.960
a reasonable person would consider, or whatever.

03:30.960 --> 03:33.680
And the argument can always be made, who defines what's reasonable?

03:33.680 --> 03:37.660
The person who views all hierarchies as corrupt and all interactions between people as games

03:37.660 --> 03:41.200
of dominance will say that it's clearly power that defines what's reasonable.

03:41.200 --> 03:45.440
Clearly, this opens the door for arbitrary prosecution based on politics, and maybe that's

03:45.440 --> 03:46.440
the case.

03:46.440 --> 03:50.040
The reason laws are necessarily written like this is because, legally, every term needs

03:50.040 --> 03:53.560
to be defined, and then every term within the definition also needs to be defined, and

03:53.560 --> 03:57.720
etc. etc. all the way down until you realize that language has no solid foundation and

03:57.720 --> 04:00.840
all of its borders are necessarily fuzzy and it's all arbitrary anyway.

04:00.840 --> 04:03.620
But nonetheless, we are grasping at real concepts here.

04:03.620 --> 04:07.480
We are creating labels that map onto these concepts as accurately as we can, and we still

04:07.480 --> 04:09.120
need language and laws.

04:09.120 --> 04:12.760
So the whole, come on man, you know what I mean, clause is pretty common, and its presence

04:12.760 --> 04:15.380
doesn't automatically constitute a valid criticism.

04:15.380 --> 04:19.700
So that being the case, let's look at what those state standards that age appropriate

04:19.700 --> 04:22.020
or developmentally appropriate is in accordance with.

04:22.020 --> 04:25.540
Here's the CDC's report on the status of sexual education in Florida.

04:25.540 --> 04:29.340
Local education agencies have the authority to choose or approve curriculum for sexual

04:29.340 --> 04:30.740
health education instruction.

04:30.740 --> 04:35.140
The option to either opt in or opt out of sexual health education, HIV prevention, and

04:35.140 --> 04:37.740
STD prevention is not addressed.

04:37.740 --> 04:39.580
Instruction regarding contraception is not addressed.

04:39.580 --> 04:43.820
Abstinence is a required topic of instruction for sexual health education, HIV prevention,

04:43.820 --> 04:44.820
and STD prevention.

04:45.260 --> 04:49.140
The core topics addressed in Florida law are sexual health education, HIV prevention, and

04:49.140 --> 04:52.620
STD prevention, though those are permitted by law, not required.

04:52.620 --> 04:56.300
At first glance, this reads like there's just no sex ed at all in Florida, but that's

04:56.300 --> 04:57.720
not necessarily the case.

04:57.720 --> 05:02.500
According to CSIS, which is a sex ed advocacy group, sex ed is not currently mandated in

05:02.500 --> 05:03.500
Florida.

05:03.500 --> 05:07.760
Schools that do teach sex ed must emphasize abstinence as the expected social standard.

05:07.760 --> 05:11.160
Since Florida schools are not required to provide sex ed to students, school districts

05:11.160 --> 05:14.680
are left to decide what type of sex ed, if any, they provide to youth.

05:15.540 --> 05:18.720
While some districts, such as Putnam County, mandate comprehensive sex ed, others, such

05:18.720 --> 05:21.720
as St. Johns County, mandate abstinence-only instruction.

05:21.720 --> 05:25.620
Regardless of how advanced a particular district's curriculum may be, state statute mandates

05:25.620 --> 05:30.160
that HIV and AIDS instruction emphasize the benefits of heterosexual marriage.

05:30.160 --> 05:34.920
So it seems to me that Florida isn't banning sex ed, it's just that the state government

05:34.920 --> 05:38.760
is being hands-off on the topic, with the only mandate being, if you're going to talk

05:38.760 --> 05:42.560
about preventing STDs, you need to bring up heterosexuality and abstinence.

05:42.560 --> 05:46.160
And I mean, fair enough, I mentioned in my addictions video that being able to adhere

05:46.160 --> 05:50.480
to abstinence is ultimately the problem, and that if you can, abstinence obviously works.

05:50.480 --> 05:52.900
And this analysis tracks with the CDC's report.

05:52.900 --> 05:57.460
The laws make no mention either positive or negative, either mandating or banning, trained

05:57.460 --> 06:02.800
in structures teaching sex ed, a unified curriculum following federal standards, or medical accuracy,

06:02.800 --> 06:04.940
all things that I'm sure leftoids don't like.

06:04.940 --> 06:09.040
But the laws also make no mention of, either positive or negative, either mandating or

06:09.040 --> 06:13.400
banning, parents being allowed to be involved in the review or approval of the curriculum,

06:13.400 --> 06:17.800
age appropriateness of the curriculum, or a stance on practical instruction, all things

06:17.800 --> 06:19.820
that I'm sure rightoids don't like.

06:19.820 --> 06:23.800
Florida's sex ed laws are something you'd expect of a more libertarian, hands-off type

06:23.800 --> 06:27.960
of approach, where their position on everything from accuracy of education, to standardization

06:27.960 --> 06:31.600
of education, to parental ability to opt-in or opt-out, to age appropriateness, is all

06:31.600 --> 06:33.920
just fuck it, let the school boards decide.

06:33.920 --> 06:37.920
CSIS being a progressive mechanism isn't happy with this laid-back approach, and they

06:37.920 --> 06:42.360
say it's going to harm LGBTQ and marginalized youth, but that's to be expected since that's

06:42.360 --> 06:43.360
their political slant.

06:43.360 --> 06:46.920
I don't know if this decentralized vision actually helps or hurts, but the point is,

06:46.920 --> 06:51.840
when the don't-say-gay bill relies on state standards, the state standard seems to mostly

06:51.840 --> 06:54.640
be the school boards decide this shit, not us.

06:54.640 --> 06:59.280
So using those two CSIS examples, when it comes to teaching about sexual orientation

06:59.280 --> 07:03.620
or gender identity, Putnam County might consider age-appropriate or developmentally-appropriate

07:03.620 --> 07:07.740
to begin at grade 4, since that's the minimum that the bill allows, while St. John's County

07:07.740 --> 07:11.120
might think it's appropriate to not discuss these topics at all regardless of age.

07:11.120 --> 07:15.740
In other words, if there's any don't-say-gaying actually happening, it's not directly by the

07:15.740 --> 07:17.900
state of Florida, it's by the local school boards.

07:17.900 --> 07:21.100
The third point of contention is paragraph 5 in the bill.

07:21.100 --> 07:24.760
At the beginning of the school year, each school district shall notify the parents of

07:24.760 --> 07:28.300
each health care service offered at their student's school, and the option to withhold

07:28.300 --> 07:30.720
consent or decline any specific service.

07:30.720 --> 07:33.660
This enshrines the right of a parent to be notified about sex ed and have the option

07:33.660 --> 07:38.220
to opt out, something that wasn't in Florida law before as we saw in that CDC analysis.

07:38.220 --> 07:41.620
Some progs hate this because they believe that kids should be forced to take sex ed

07:41.620 --> 07:44.700
regardless of how the parents feel about it, which I generally don't think is right.

07:44.700 --> 07:46.540
At the same time, I can see their point of view.

07:46.540 --> 07:49.720
There are some really shitty parents out there who shelter their kids or teach them factually

07:49.720 --> 07:53.740
incorrect stuff, or abuse them, and sometimes school is the privacy away from the parent

07:53.740 --> 07:54.980
that the kid needs.

07:54.980 --> 07:58.460
Both parents and the government can misuse the authority they have over children.

07:58.460 --> 08:02.700
The question seems to be, if misused, which has worse consequences?

08:02.700 --> 08:06.860
During the most developmental years, parents can absolutely royally fuck up a kid for the

08:06.860 --> 08:07.900
rest of their lives.

08:07.900 --> 08:10.740
But as they get older, especially into the double digits, I would say that it's the

08:10.740 --> 08:13.740
government, for the sole fact that at least with the parents, you can cut them off if

08:13.740 --> 08:14.740
you have to.

08:14.740 --> 08:15.740
You can't do that with a state.

08:15.740 --> 08:17.680
The fourth complaint is about paragraph 7.

08:17.680 --> 08:21.340
This is pretty long, so basically, 7 reads that parents have a mechanism to complain

08:21.340 --> 08:24.620
to the school, and that complaint must be replied to within 7 days.

08:24.620 --> 08:28.300
After 30 days, if the complaint isn't resolved, the parent has the right to arbitration by

08:28.300 --> 08:31.220
a magistrate or can bring a court action against the school district.

08:31.220 --> 08:34.660
A lot of progs are saying that this allows parents to sue the school for teaching their

08:34.660 --> 08:37.300
kid about the gays, but that's not fully accurate.

08:37.300 --> 08:41.900
Remember, paragraph 5 allows parents to have their child opt out of sex education.

08:41.900 --> 08:45.740
Paragraph 7, meanwhile, allows parents to complain and have that complaint considered.

08:45.740 --> 08:49.160
So let's say that a parent has decided that their kid isn't going to be taught sex ed,

08:49.160 --> 08:51.180
and they opt out as per paragraph 5.

08:51.180 --> 08:55.280
That parent can only file a complaint under paragraph 7 if the school went behind their

08:55.280 --> 09:00.020
backs and taught the kid sex ed anyway, and that parent can only pursue damages if the

09:00.020 --> 09:02.180
school ignored their complaint.

09:02.180 --> 09:06.340
Parents cannot go after schools for teaching sex ed to everyone, because paragraph 5 limits

09:06.340 --> 09:09.180
the scope of a parent's control to only their own children.

09:09.180 --> 09:13.420
So if some dumb Karen wanted not only her precious baby to not be in sex ed, but wanted

09:13.420 --> 09:16.780
the school to stop offering sex ed for everyone, she'd be shit out of luck.

09:16.780 --> 09:20.300
And if she filed a complaint under paragraph 7, properly resolving the complaint would

09:20.300 --> 09:22.840
constitute the school board telling her to go pound sand.

09:22.840 --> 09:26.740
The fifth problem is that I've heard some people on the left also say that the options

09:26.740 --> 09:31.420
for relief under paragraph 8 mark new territory, that parents could not sue schools for this

09:31.420 --> 09:32.420
sort of thing before.

09:32.420 --> 09:33.420
That's just not true.

09:33.420 --> 09:37.340
And in fact, up here in Canada, we make fun of how sue-happy Americans are, especially

09:37.340 --> 09:38.340
when it comes to schools.

09:38.340 --> 09:42.940
In 2012, parents in California sued a school district over only offering abstinence-only

09:42.940 --> 09:45.860
education, wanting more options for sex ed for their kids.

09:45.860 --> 09:50.700
In 2005, parents in Maryland sued to stop discussions about homosexuality and sex ed,

09:50.700 --> 09:53.660
as well as the screening of a video showing how to properly put a condom on.

09:53.660 --> 09:58.580
In 2010, a mother in Montana sued the school due to sex ed there involving kindergarteners

09:58.580 --> 10:02.740
through grade 3 learning about human anatomy and fifth grade students learning about different

10:02.740 --> 10:04.060
types of sexual activity.

10:04.060 --> 10:06.340
Hell, back in 1994 this shit was happening.

10:06.340 --> 10:07.700
This isn't anything new.

10:07.700 --> 10:12.300
Sixth, a lot of progs are also worried that involving parents in their children's education

10:12.300 --> 10:15.860
this much will mean that the kids who are legitimately gay or trans will be hurt by

10:15.860 --> 10:19.740
the system, as the teachers and school staff will have an obligation to inform the parents

10:19.740 --> 10:21.520
about the status of their children's health.

10:21.520 --> 10:25.200
So if you're a closeted gay kid and your homophobic parents would disown you or beat

10:25.200 --> 10:28.340
you or kill you if they knew, yeah, that's actually a real concern.

10:28.340 --> 10:31.800
And the progs believe that this bill will empower those parents in the abuse of their

10:31.800 --> 10:34.560
children and force schools to become an accomplice to it.

10:34.560 --> 10:38.020
But that's because, even though the bill is only seven pages, the progs still never

10:38.020 --> 10:39.200
bothered to read it.

10:39.200 --> 10:42.840
In paragraph 2, that paragraph I skipped over earlier, that outlines the parents' right

10:42.840 --> 10:46.460
to be informed about their kids' health, has a clause for just such an occasion.

10:46.460 --> 10:50.320
This sub-paragraph does not prohibit a school district from adopting procedures that permit

10:50.320 --> 10:55.000
school personnel to withhold such information from a parent if a reasonably prudent person

10:55.000 --> 10:58.480
would believe that disclosure would result in abuse, abandonment, or neglect.

10:58.480 --> 11:02.060
Again, we've got the reasonably prudent person problem here, but this seems like pretty

11:02.060 --> 11:03.160
concrete protection.

11:03.160 --> 11:05.800
And finally, there's the it's good when we do it argument.

11:05.800 --> 11:08.760
It's good to go against the consent of parents, to sneak around and keep things in the dark.

11:08.760 --> 11:11.440
It's good to teach kids about this stuff even if their parents don't want it, because

11:11.440 --> 11:13.920
it hurts trans kids to not know that they're trans.

11:13.920 --> 11:15.720
And maybe, fair enough.

11:15.720 --> 11:19.220
While I do think that the massive inflation of numbers of trans people can be genuinely

11:19.220 --> 11:22.900
chalked up to trans-trenders right now, there are absolutely a small minority of people

11:22.900 --> 11:27.020
who are really trans from birth, and it would likely make their lives a lot better if they

11:27.020 --> 11:28.700
knew what that was at a young age.

11:28.700 --> 11:33.300
The issue is, though, nobody trusts these teachers with political agendas to be neutral

11:33.300 --> 11:34.740
arbiters of the topic.

11:34.740 --> 11:36.220
In fact, we know that they're not.

11:36.220 --> 11:38.700
That's literally what it's good when we do it means.

11:38.700 --> 11:44.180
It is normal, expected, and reasonable for conservative parents to not trust the blue-haired,

11:44.180 --> 11:47.820
non-binary teachers dancing and singing about how they're converting children on the lives

11:47.820 --> 11:52.580
of TikTok, just like it would be normal, accepted, and reasonable for the progs to not trust

11:52.580 --> 11:56.700
conservative teachers in a world where separation of church and state was abolished and suddenly

11:56.700 --> 12:00.280
gay kids had to attend a totally neutral Bible study class.

12:00.280 --> 12:05.140
So no, I personally don't think that Florida's don't say gay bill is a huge problem.

12:05.140 --> 12:08.860
It does have a few areas where things are vague enough that somebody with a bad agenda

12:08.860 --> 12:13.720
could use it improperly, but the general request of don't teach kids this gender ideology

12:13.720 --> 12:16.620
shit until they hit the double digits seems to be reasonable to me.

12:16.620 --> 12:19.940
And on the one hand, the reaction to this has been histrionic.

12:19.940 --> 12:23.200
We just lost the ability to exist in an entire state before age 19.

12:23.200 --> 12:24.540
What the fuck are you talking about?

12:24.540 --> 12:26.860
These schools will still have gay and trans kids.

12:26.860 --> 12:29.900
They're just not going to be taught about it by teachers until grade four, slow your

12:29.900 --> 12:30.900
fucking roll.

12:30.900 --> 12:34.420
People are also trying to link that gay bar that burned down in Brooklyn to the don't

12:34.420 --> 12:38.740
say gay thing, spinning a narrative that anti-gay and anti-trans violence is on the rise and

12:38.740 --> 12:41.980
that society is going to start mass oppressing adults again for doing what they want with

12:41.980 --> 12:43.100
their lives and bodies.

12:43.100 --> 12:44.100
To me, I don't see the correlation.

12:44.100 --> 12:46.780
I don't think that there's actually a connection between teaching children about

12:46.780 --> 12:50.580
sexuality in inappropriate ages and consenting sexual behavior between adults.

12:50.580 --> 12:53.100
And personally, I would have to wonder about the person who does.

12:53.100 --> 12:56.740
LA County bans official travel to Florida over the don't say gay law.

12:56.740 --> 12:59.820
This is official travel, mind you, meaning state sponsored travel.

12:59.820 --> 13:02.940
Private citizens can continue to evacuate California as it sinks into the ocean.

13:02.940 --> 13:03.940
Don't worry.

13:03.940 --> 13:05.300
But yeah, this is ultra fucking stupid.

13:05.300 --> 13:09.140
Even using the phrase don't say gay is stupid because it's just another leftoid straw

13:09.140 --> 13:12.440
man of what's going on, just like every other slogan, every other Mott and Bailey.

13:12.440 --> 13:16.040
Nobody said don't say gay, just like nobody said that black lives don't matter or that

13:16.040 --> 13:17.560
trans people don't have rights.

13:17.560 --> 13:21.160
At the same time, we cannot pretend that everything that the left is currently screaming about

13:21.160 --> 13:22.560
is completely unfounded.

13:22.560 --> 13:26.040
As I mentioned in the concept creep video, parents are currently calling for the head

13:26.040 --> 13:29.580
of a gay teacher who casually mentioned he was taking time off to get married.

13:29.580 --> 13:33.100
And when asked about his soon to be wife by his students, he said he was going to have

13:33.100 --> 13:34.360
a husband, actually.

13:34.360 --> 13:38.200
Literally the reasonable example I mentioned early in this video of completely acceptable

13:38.200 --> 13:40.000
mentioning of homosexuality to children?

13:40.000 --> 13:43.360
Yeah, there are parents who are complaining about it now, and that's ridiculous.

13:43.360 --> 13:46.640
The article reporting on this story actually describes three different stories.

13:46.640 --> 13:50.080
The first is of Robert Tholander, a sixth grade teacher, who is the one that I talked

13:50.080 --> 13:51.080
about.

13:51.080 --> 13:54.520
The parents claim that marrying a man is not the issue, but sharing the details with the

13:54.520 --> 13:55.520
students is.

13:55.520 --> 13:59.280
The parents never describe what details he shared, but Tholander said he never went beyond

13:59.280 --> 14:00.400
casually mentioning it.

14:00.400 --> 14:03.680
To me, the parents are wrong, and according to the information that we have, this is pretty

14:03.680 --> 14:04.680
unacceptable.

14:05.640 --> 14:10.320
Solomon, a lesbian, who said the law would erase me as an LGBTQ teacher, nobody would

14:10.320 --> 14:13.840
be able to know, which then puts me in the closet, and I'm there seven hours a day,

14:13.840 --> 14:15.200
if not more, five days a week.

14:15.200 --> 14:17.000
I wouldn't be able to be who I am.

14:17.000 --> 14:20.800
The question is, what constitutes who you are that you can't do while you're teaching

14:20.800 --> 14:22.320
math or English or whatever?

14:22.320 --> 14:24.120
What vital experience would you be missing?

14:24.120 --> 14:25.760
What avenue would be closed off to you?

14:25.760 --> 14:28.880
Is it like Tholander's case, where you'd feel afraid of displaying a picture of your

14:28.880 --> 14:32.400
girlfriend on your desk, or appropriately answering questions about your life?

14:32.400 --> 14:35.560
If so, fair enough, but this story seems a bit vague to me.

14:35.560 --> 14:39.720
Case three, Brian Kirkes, a gay man who asks his students for their preferred pronouns

14:39.720 --> 14:43.360
at the beginning of every year, whose class has a safe space sign and a pride flag, and

14:43.360 --> 14:47.100
who says, our students need to see that the educators in their community are as diverse

14:47.100 --> 14:50.280
as the rest of the community, they need educators that look and resemble them.

14:50.280 --> 14:53.520
Yeah, you might be the kind of person that conservative parents are worried about, dude.

14:53.520 --> 14:56.480
It's interesting to me that the article lumps in these three people as if they're

14:56.480 --> 14:57.480
in the same boat.

14:57.480 --> 15:01.660
You've got one person who is openly advocating this ideology in defiance of the law and potentially

15:01.660 --> 15:02.700
the wishes of the parents.

15:02.700 --> 15:05.740
You've got one person who is very vague about what's going on, what they want, and

15:05.740 --> 15:06.740
what they're doing.

15:06.740 --> 15:10.340
And then you've got one person who is actually being unfairly treated due to the overzealousness

15:10.340 --> 15:11.340
of parents.

15:11.340 --> 15:13.220
These are not the same situations.

15:13.220 --> 15:16.780
And emboldened by the Don't Say Gay bill and the discourse surrounding it, other events

15:16.780 --> 15:18.420
are also being set into motion.

15:18.420 --> 15:22.020
Doctors in Florida have all received this letter from the Florida Health Department,

15:22.020 --> 15:25.860
informing them that under no circumstances should anybody under 18 receive any transitioning

15:25.860 --> 15:30.180
treatment, including puberty blockers, hormone therapy, any form of surgery, or even socially

15:30.180 --> 15:31.580
living as the other gender.

15:31.580 --> 15:34.980
For all of those trans-trenders I mentioned earlier, this could actually probably help

15:34.980 --> 15:35.980
them out quite a bit.

15:35.980 --> 15:40.340
But for those few legitimate trans people, we do know that passing is easier if you start

15:40.340 --> 15:41.340
earlier.

15:41.340 --> 15:45.080
The question that makes transitioning legitimate is, are you actually trans?

15:45.080 --> 15:48.140
And there's just not enough trust in the integrity and neutrality of the people who

15:48.140 --> 15:49.900
are meant to ask that question right now.

15:49.900 --> 15:53.480
In fact, it's considered transphobic to ask that question right now, which is just

15:53.480 --> 15:54.480
ridiculous.

15:54.480 --> 15:58.420
Meanwhile, Alabama has decided to make it a felony for healthcare workers to help transition

15:58.420 --> 16:00.420
anybody below 19, not 18.

16:00.420 --> 16:04.100
Idaho has made it a life sentence to help transition anybody under 18, and has also

16:04.100 --> 16:07.340
made it a felony for people to go to another state and then transition there.

16:07.340 --> 16:11.700
In Missouri, there's currently a push to ban transitioning till the age of 25.

16:11.700 --> 16:16.900
And to this, until their brains are fully developed at age 25, to comprehend the dramatic

16:16.900 --> 16:21.340
and drastic and irreparable changes to their bodies.

16:21.340 --> 16:25.460
Well, and that's something that I believe I've discussed in committee previously.

16:25.460 --> 16:29.660
And I know when we had criminal justice reform, such as raise the age.

16:29.700 --> 16:35.740
I think Republicans and Democrats both agreed when we passed that, that the brains of especially

16:35.740 --> 16:39.020
males are still developing into their 20s.

16:39.020 --> 16:43.820
And I don't understand why that's not part of the discussion herein.

16:43.820 --> 16:45.300
This to me is absolutely ridiculous.

16:45.300 --> 16:49.140
At 25, the state should shut its mouth about what you want to do with your body, period.

16:49.140 --> 16:53.280
It's also important to note that most of these pieces of legislation have exemptions built

16:53.280 --> 16:54.500
in for intersex people.

16:54.500 --> 16:57.700
So if you're born with one of the various deformities that constitutes intersex, you

16:57.700 --> 17:01.740
can still get surgery and hormones as required to live as normally as possible.

17:01.740 --> 17:06.860
A lot of trans activism likes to rely on intersex issues as a talking point, but trans people

17:06.860 --> 17:07.860
are not intersex.

17:07.860 --> 17:11.480
I've heard from multiple people that the Don't Say Gay bill is the tip of the iceberg.

17:11.480 --> 17:14.540
And there's actually 240 anti-trans bills right now being debated.

17:14.540 --> 17:16.900
I don't know where that number comes from, but I've heard it a lot.

17:16.900 --> 17:20.340
What I do know, though, is that there's a Twitter account called Trans Bill Tracker,

17:20.340 --> 17:23.840
which is posting all of the various anti-trans legislation working its way through the system

17:23.840 --> 17:24.840
right now.

17:24.840 --> 17:29.840
This is, to me, reasonable stuff, like legislation regarding gender segregation in school sports.

17:29.840 --> 17:33.780
Some of the legislation is stuff related to paperwork and IDs, like banning non-binary

17:33.780 --> 17:36.360
from being used on an official state ID card.

17:36.360 --> 17:40.240
And on this account, insofar as Don't Say Gay-related stuff is concerned, we can see

17:40.240 --> 17:45.040
copycat bills like Oklahoma following suit and banning classroom instruction on sexual

17:45.040 --> 17:47.640
identity and gender expression from kindergarten to grade five.

17:47.640 --> 17:49.960
To be honest, I could sit here and scroll through this account for a while, and I could

17:49.960 --> 17:52.880
probably find bills I disagree with, bills I agree with, and bills I just don't care

17:52.880 --> 17:53.880
about.

17:53.920 --> 17:54.920
That's where the 240 number comes from.

17:54.920 --> 17:58.520
In any case, though, there does seem to be a rise of legislation that goes against the

17:58.520 --> 17:59.520
LGBT agenda.

17:59.520 --> 18:04.140
But that's because that political agenda is not universally good or correct or even

18:04.140 --> 18:05.140
supported by people.

18:05.140 --> 18:09.220
The trans lobby is not always right on every single thing all the time.

18:09.220 --> 18:11.380
The big problem here is what I said earlier.

18:11.380 --> 18:15.080
If transness is an immutable characteristic, and for the legitimate trans people, I think

18:15.080 --> 18:18.040
it is, that is something that you know from a very young age.

18:18.040 --> 18:21.780
The legitimate trans experience, as I've had it described to me by several trans people

18:21.780 --> 18:25.980
now, is one where, for as long as they can remember, there's been something very wrong

18:25.980 --> 18:26.980
with them.

18:26.980 --> 18:31.100
And as puberty began, it was accompanied not just with confusion or questions or weird

18:31.100 --> 18:35.820
new feelings, but a deep disgust with one's own body, with what they're becoming and

18:35.820 --> 18:39.860
how it intuitively doesn't feel like what they should be on some fundamental level.

18:39.860 --> 18:43.340
That's a completely different experience than people who are fine with who they are

18:43.340 --> 18:46.320
but think it would be cool to be the other gender for aesthetic purposes.

18:46.320 --> 18:50.060
The former is doing it because it's the best way we currently know how to alleviate

18:50.060 --> 18:51.220
their dysphoric symptoms.

18:51.220 --> 18:54.340
The latter is doing it because it's fun and cool and the thing that nets you the most

18:54.340 --> 18:55.920
social points online right now.

18:55.920 --> 18:59.020
It's pretty clear which of the two I personally have no respect for.

18:59.020 --> 19:03.960
The issue is, restricting transitioning even to 18 makes the lives of that tiny population

19:03.960 --> 19:06.220
of real trans people significantly harder.

19:06.220 --> 19:10.280
At the same time, it also provides a bulwark against ideologically possessed teachers from

19:10.280 --> 19:13.180
pushing people who are trans-trenders, or people who are borderline, people who are

19:13.180 --> 19:17.260
just confused, into a medical procedure that actually isn't for them and in fact will

19:17.260 --> 19:18.860
be quite harmful to them.

19:18.860 --> 19:22.400
The issue is that people just don't trust these teachers anymore.

19:22.400 --> 19:25.920
If we lived in a world where politics were taken out of it on both sides, and transitioning

19:25.920 --> 19:29.460
was only talked about as a medical treatment for people with legitimate dysphoria and it

19:29.460 --> 19:33.260
was otherwise off the table, then maybe the larger public would trust the procedure.

19:33.260 --> 19:34.660
But we don't live in that world.

19:34.660 --> 19:38.760
The trust in the teachers or in the system is not present and as such we are seeing legislative

19:38.760 --> 19:40.700
remedies with potential bad side effects.

19:40.700 --> 19:44.340
All because the people in these positions of power have taken it upon themselves to

19:44.340 --> 19:46.540
push a political agenda onto children.

19:46.540 --> 19:49.260
And examining that agenda will be the topic of the next video.
