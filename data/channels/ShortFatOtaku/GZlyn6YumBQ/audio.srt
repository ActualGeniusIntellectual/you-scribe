1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,640
I recently had a conversation with Lilith about the whole don't say gay thing that's

2
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:10,640
happening right now.

3
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:13,160
No, not in the tubcast, this was an offline talk.

4
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:17,020
Being trans, she took up the unapologetically pro-trans position, which I don't completely

5
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:18,020
agree with.

6
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:20,120
I'm not faulting her for it, it's an issue close to her heart.

7
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:23,520
I might be the same way if I were in her shoes, but I wanted to look at the topic as objectively

8
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:24,520
as I can.

9
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:28,600
And, spoiler alert, yeah, we're going to discover that neither side is exactly correct.

10
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:29,780
So let's get into it.

11
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:33,900
Florida's Parental Rights in Education Act, labeled as the Don't Say Gay Bill by

12
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:38,720
its critics, is a recently passed law that outlines new statutes for primary education

13
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:41,920
insofar as sexual orientation and gender identity is concerned.

14
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:45,460
The bill prohibits the discussion of these topics in a classroom setting from kindergarten

15
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:46,460
to grade three.

16
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:47,460
That's nine years old.

17
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:49,880
Naturally, this topic has got everybody's panties in a bunch.

18
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:52,760
Leftoids are screaming that this is homophobic and transphobic and it's going to result

19
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:54,340
in the deaths of trans kids.

20
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:57,380
Rightoids are screeching that this is necessary because the school system is inundated with

21
00:00:57,380 --> 00:01:01,060
LGBT groomers who are pushing trans ideology onto impressionable children.

22
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:05,140
The funny thing is, everyone could just calm down and go read the bill and figure it out

23
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:06,140
for themselves.

24
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:08,980
It's not some omnibus legislation that's over 9000 pages.

25
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:09,980
It's seven pages long.

26
00:01:09,980 --> 00:01:12,280
I'll leave it in the description if you want to read it yourself, but let's go over

27
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:13,280
the pertinent points.

28
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:15,780
The first point of contention is paragraph three.

29
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:19,820
Paragraphs one and two are basically blanket statements that schools have an obligation

30
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:23,680
to inform parents about a change in a student's health and, for the most part, leave those

31
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:26,160
health-related decisions in the hands of parents.

32
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:30,140
Paragraph three reads, Classroom instruction by school personnel or third parties on sexual

33
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:34,920
orientation or gender identity may not occur in kindergarten through grade three or in

34
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:39,080
a manner that is not age-appropriate or developmentally appropriate for students in accordance with

35
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:40,080
state standards.

36
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:41,080
That's it.

37
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:44,200
This is the bit of the legislation that went viral, that discussions on sexual orientation

38
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:46,760
or gender identity can't happen at all before grade four.

39
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:49,760
This is what opponents of the bill are calling Don't Say Gay.

40
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:51,600
So let's examine their criticisms.

41
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:54,240
Firstly, there's the moniker, Don't Say Gay.

42
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:57,600
Everything in the wording of this bill mentions gay or homosexual.

43
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,460
It just says sexual orientation.

44
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:02,600
That also means that you could just as easily call it the Don't Say Straight Bill.

45
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:06,640
The immediate counterargument to this is that heterosexuality is pretty normalized in society

46
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:10,400
over homosexuality, even now, and yeah, that's true, but it's also a necessary part of

47
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,280
being a reproducing species.

48
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:16,080
Young kids might not know what sex is, but for example, they'll be in the grocery store

49
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:20,160
with their parents and see other heterosexual couples with their kids together.

50
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:24,060
Heterosexuality is common and necessary, so it does naturally lead to an early understanding

51
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:26,340
of the idea, even if they don't know about sex.

52
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:29,900
And it's also very common to see situations like a kid sees a teacher with his wedding

53
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:32,740
photo on his desk and asks about it, and the teacher says that's his wife.

54
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:36,680
Or a situation where a kid overhears their young female teacher saying to a colleague

55
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:40,420
that she's going on a date that night, and all the kids go, ooh, like dumb kids do.

56
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:41,780
This is all stuff I'm sure we can remember happening.

57
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:42,780
None of it's bad.

58
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:46,740
It's all normal, even positive behavior, and it's all predicated on at least a basic

59
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:50,400
understanding of heterosexuality, even though at that age, kids wouldn't use that word

60
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,400
to describe it.

61
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:54,520
These normal behaviors might be made illegal under this bill, and I don't think it's

62
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,520
a good thing.

63
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:59,640
Secondly, a lot of progressives view the second half of paragraph three to be the weasel words

64
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:02,700
that allow schools to blanket ban all talk of sexuality.

65
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:06,720
Those words are, or in a manner that is not age-appropriate or developmentally appropriate

66
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,840
for students in accordance with state standards.

67
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:12,520
The obvious question here is, who is to say what is age-appropriate or developmentally

68
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:13,520
appropriate?

69
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:16,960
What if the powers that be are all a bunch of pearl-clutching Christian moms who don't

70
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:19,520
want their 17-year-olds to be taught about the existence of sex?

71
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:21,400
That seems kind of ridiculous to me, doesn't it?

72
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,960
Well, this is a wider issue.

73
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:25,040
It's with the very concept of law.

74
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:28,640
Almost every law, if you dig deep enough, has a bit written into it where it says, as

75
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,960
a reasonable person would consider, or whatever.

76
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:33,680
And the argument can always be made, who defines what's reasonable?

77
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:37,660
The person who views all hierarchies as corrupt and all interactions between people as games

78
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:41,200
of dominance will say that it's clearly power that defines what's reasonable.

79
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:45,440
Clearly, this opens the door for arbitrary prosecution based on politics, and maybe that's

80
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,440
the case.

81
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:50,040
The reason laws are necessarily written like this is because, legally, every term needs

82
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:53,560
to be defined, and then every term within the definition also needs to be defined, and

83
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:57,720
etc. etc. all the way down until you realize that language has no solid foundation and

84
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:00,840
all of its borders are necessarily fuzzy and it's all arbitrary anyway.

85
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:03,620
But nonetheless, we are grasping at real concepts here.

86
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:07,480
We are creating labels that map onto these concepts as accurately as we can, and we still

87
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:09,120
need language and laws.

88
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,760
So the whole, come on man, you know what I mean, clause is pretty common, and its presence

89
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:15,380
doesn't automatically constitute a valid criticism.

90
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:19,700
So that being the case, let's look at what those state standards that age appropriate

91
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:22,020
or developmentally appropriate is in accordance with.

92
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:25,540
Here's the CDC's report on the status of sexual education in Florida.

93
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:29,340
Local education agencies have the authority to choose or approve curriculum for sexual

94
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:30,740
health education instruction.

95
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:35,140
The option to either opt in or opt out of sexual health education, HIV prevention, and

96
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:37,740
STD prevention is not addressed.

97
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:39,580
Instruction regarding contraception is not addressed.

98
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:43,820
Abstinence is a required topic of instruction for sexual health education, HIV prevention,

99
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:44,820
and STD prevention.

100
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:49,140
The core topics addressed in Florida law are sexual health education, HIV prevention, and

101
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:52,620
STD prevention, though those are permitted by law, not required.

102
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:56,300
At first glance, this reads like there's just no sex ed at all in Florida, but that's

103
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:57,720
not necessarily the case.

104
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:02,500
According to CSIS, which is a sex ed advocacy group, sex ed is not currently mandated in

105
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:03,500
Florida.

106
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:07,760
Schools that do teach sex ed must emphasize abstinence as the expected social standard.

107
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:11,160
Since Florida schools are not required to provide sex ed to students, school districts

108
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:14,680
are left to decide what type of sex ed, if any, they provide to youth.

109
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:18,720
While some districts, such as Putnam County, mandate comprehensive sex ed, others, such

110
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:21,720
as St. Johns County, mandate abstinence-only instruction.

111
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:25,620
Regardless of how advanced a particular district's curriculum may be, state statute mandates

112
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:30,160
that HIV and AIDS instruction emphasize the benefits of heterosexual marriage.

113
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:34,920
So it seems to me that Florida isn't banning sex ed, it's just that the state government

114
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:38,760
is being hands-off on the topic, with the only mandate being, if you're going to talk

115
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:42,560
about preventing STDs, you need to bring up heterosexuality and abstinence.

116
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:46,160
And I mean, fair enough, I mentioned in my addictions video that being able to adhere

117
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:50,480
to abstinence is ultimately the problem, and that if you can, abstinence obviously works.

118
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:52,900
And this analysis tracks with the CDC's report.

119
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:57,460
The laws make no mention either positive or negative, either mandating or banning, trained

120
00:05:57,460 --> 00:06:02,800
in structures teaching sex ed, a unified curriculum following federal standards, or medical accuracy,

121
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,940
all things that I'm sure leftoids don't like.

122
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:09,040
But the laws also make no mention of, either positive or negative, either mandating or

123
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:13,400
banning, parents being allowed to be involved in the review or approval of the curriculum,

124
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:17,800
age appropriateness of the curriculum, or a stance on practical instruction, all things

125
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,820
that I'm sure rightoids don't like.

126
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:23,800
Florida's sex ed laws are something you'd expect of a more libertarian, hands-off type

127
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:27,960
of approach, where their position on everything from accuracy of education, to standardization

128
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:31,600
of education, to parental ability to opt-in or opt-out, to age appropriateness, is all

129
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,920
just fuck it, let the school boards decide.

130
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:37,920
CSIS being a progressive mechanism isn't happy with this laid-back approach, and they

131
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:42,360
say it's going to harm LGBTQ and marginalized youth, but that's to be expected since that's

132
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,360
their political slant.

133
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:46,920
I don't know if this decentralized vision actually helps or hurts, but the point is,

134
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:51,840
when the don't-say-gay bill relies on state standards, the state standard seems to mostly

135
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:54,640
be the school boards decide this shit, not us.

136
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:59,280
So using those two CSIS examples, when it comes to teaching about sexual orientation

137
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:03,620
or gender identity, Putnam County might consider age-appropriate or developmentally-appropriate

138
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:07,740
to begin at grade 4, since that's the minimum that the bill allows, while St. John's County

139
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:11,120
might think it's appropriate to not discuss these topics at all regardless of age.

140
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:15,740
In other words, if there's any don't-say-gaying actually happening, it's not directly by the

141
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:17,900
state of Florida, it's by the local school boards.

142
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:21,100
The third point of contention is paragraph 5 in the bill.

143
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:24,760
At the beginning of the school year, each school district shall notify the parents of

144
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:28,300
each health care service offered at their student's school, and the option to withhold

145
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:30,720
consent or decline any specific service.

146
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:33,660
This enshrines the right of a parent to be notified about sex ed and have the option

147
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:38,220
to opt out, something that wasn't in Florida law before as we saw in that CDC analysis.

148
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:41,620
Some progs hate this because they believe that kids should be forced to take sex ed

149
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:44,700
regardless of how the parents feel about it, which I generally don't think is right.

150
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:46,540
At the same time, I can see their point of view.

151
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:49,720
There are some really shitty parents out there who shelter their kids or teach them factually

152
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:53,740
incorrect stuff, or abuse them, and sometimes school is the privacy away from the parent

153
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:54,980
that the kid needs.

154
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:58,460
Both parents and the government can misuse the authority they have over children.

155
00:07:58,460 --> 00:08:02,700
The question seems to be, if misused, which has worse consequences?

156
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:06,860
During the most developmental years, parents can absolutely royally fuck up a kid for the

157
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:07,900
rest of their lives.

158
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:10,740
But as they get older, especially into the double digits, I would say that it's the

159
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:13,740
government, for the sole fact that at least with the parents, you can cut them off if

160
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:14,740
you have to.

161
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:15,740
You can't do that with a state.

162
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:17,680
The fourth complaint is about paragraph 7.

163
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:21,340
This is pretty long, so basically, 7 reads that parents have a mechanism to complain

164
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:24,620
to the school, and that complaint must be replied to within 7 days.

165
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:28,300
After 30 days, if the complaint isn't resolved, the parent has the right to arbitration by

166
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:31,220
a magistrate or can bring a court action against the school district.

167
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:34,660
A lot of progs are saying that this allows parents to sue the school for teaching their

168
00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:37,300
kid about the gays, but that's not fully accurate.

169
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:41,900
Remember, paragraph 5 allows parents to have their child opt out of sex education.

170
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:45,740
Paragraph 7, meanwhile, allows parents to complain and have that complaint considered.

171
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:49,160
So let's say that a parent has decided that their kid isn't going to be taught sex ed,

172
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:51,180
and they opt out as per paragraph 5.

173
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:55,280
That parent can only file a complaint under paragraph 7 if the school went behind their

174
00:08:55,280 --> 00:09:00,020
backs and taught the kid sex ed anyway, and that parent can only pursue damages if the

175
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:02,180
school ignored their complaint.

176
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:06,340
Parents cannot go after schools for teaching sex ed to everyone, because paragraph 5 limits

177
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:09,180
the scope of a parent's control to only their own children.

178
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:13,420
So if some dumb Karen wanted not only her precious baby to not be in sex ed, but wanted

179
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:16,780
the school to stop offering sex ed for everyone, she'd be shit out of luck.

180
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:20,300
And if she filed a complaint under paragraph 7, properly resolving the complaint would

181
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:22,840
constitute the school board telling her to go pound sand.

182
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:26,740
The fifth problem is that I've heard some people on the left also say that the options

183
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:31,420
for relief under paragraph 8 mark new territory, that parents could not sue schools for this

184
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:32,420
sort of thing before.

185
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:33,420
That's just not true.

186
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:37,340
And in fact, up here in Canada, we make fun of how sue-happy Americans are, especially

187
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:38,340
when it comes to schools.

188
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:42,940
In 2012, parents in California sued a school district over only offering abstinence-only

189
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:45,860
education, wanting more options for sex ed for their kids.

190
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:50,700
In 2005, parents in Maryland sued to stop discussions about homosexuality and sex ed,

191
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:53,660
as well as the screening of a video showing how to properly put a condom on.

192
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:58,580
In 2010, a mother in Montana sued the school due to sex ed there involving kindergarteners

193
00:09:58,580 --> 00:10:02,740
through grade 3 learning about human anatomy and fifth grade students learning about different

194
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:04,060
types of sexual activity.

195
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:06,340
Hell, back in 1994 this shit was happening.

196
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:07,700
This isn't anything new.

197
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:12,300
Sixth, a lot of progs are also worried that involving parents in their children's education

198
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:15,860
this much will mean that the kids who are legitimately gay or trans will be hurt by

199
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:19,740
the system, as the teachers and school staff will have an obligation to inform the parents

200
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:21,520
about the status of their children's health.

201
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:25,200
So if you're a closeted gay kid and your homophobic parents would disown you or beat

202
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:28,340
you or kill you if they knew, yeah, that's actually a real concern.

203
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:31,800
And the progs believe that this bill will empower those parents in the abuse of their

204
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:34,560
children and force schools to become an accomplice to it.

205
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:38,020
But that's because, even though the bill is only seven pages, the progs still never

206
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:39,200
bothered to read it.

207
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:42,840
In paragraph 2, that paragraph I skipped over earlier, that outlines the parents' right

208
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:46,460
to be informed about their kids' health, has a clause for just such an occasion.

209
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:50,320
This sub-paragraph does not prohibit a school district from adopting procedures that permit

210
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:55,000
school personnel to withhold such information from a parent if a reasonably prudent person

211
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,480
would believe that disclosure would result in abuse, abandonment, or neglect.

212
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:02,060
Again, we've got the reasonably prudent person problem here, but this seems like pretty

213
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:03,160
concrete protection.

214
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:05,800
And finally, there's the it's good when we do it argument.

215
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:08,760
It's good to go against the consent of parents, to sneak around and keep things in the dark.

216
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:11,440
It's good to teach kids about this stuff even if their parents don't want it, because

217
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,920
it hurts trans kids to not know that they're trans.

218
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,720
And maybe, fair enough.

219
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:19,220
While I do think that the massive inflation of numbers of trans people can be genuinely

220
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:22,900
chalked up to trans-trenders right now, there are absolutely a small minority of people

221
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:27,020
who are really trans from birth, and it would likely make their lives a lot better if they

222
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:28,700
knew what that was at a young age.

223
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:33,300
The issue is, though, nobody trusts these teachers with political agendas to be neutral

224
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:34,740
arbiters of the topic.

225
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:36,220
In fact, we know that they're not.

226
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:38,700
That's literally what it's good when we do it means.

227
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:44,180
It is normal, expected, and reasonable for conservative parents to not trust the blue-haired,

228
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:47,820
non-binary teachers dancing and singing about how they're converting children on the lives

229
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:52,580
of TikTok, just like it would be normal, accepted, and reasonable for the progs to not trust

230
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:56,700
conservative teachers in a world where separation of church and state was abolished and suddenly

231
00:11:56,700 --> 00:12:00,280
gay kids had to attend a totally neutral Bible study class.

232
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:05,140
So no, I personally don't think that Florida's don't say gay bill is a huge problem.

233
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:08,860
It does have a few areas where things are vague enough that somebody with a bad agenda

234
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:13,720
could use it improperly, but the general request of don't teach kids this gender ideology

235
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:16,620
shit until they hit the double digits seems to be reasonable to me.

236
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:19,940
And on the one hand, the reaction to this has been histrionic.

237
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:23,200
We just lost the ability to exist in an entire state before age 19.

238
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,540
What the fuck are you talking about?

239
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:26,860
These schools will still have gay and trans kids.

240
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:29,900
They're just not going to be taught about it by teachers until grade four, slow your

241
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:30,900
fucking roll.

242
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:34,420
People are also trying to link that gay bar that burned down in Brooklyn to the don't

243
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:38,740
say gay thing, spinning a narrative that anti-gay and anti-trans violence is on the rise and

244
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:41,980
that society is going to start mass oppressing adults again for doing what they want with

245
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:43,100
their lives and bodies.

246
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:44,100
To me, I don't see the correlation.

247
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:46,780
I don't think that there's actually a connection between teaching children about

248
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:50,580
sexuality in inappropriate ages and consenting sexual behavior between adults.

249
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:53,100
And personally, I would have to wonder about the person who does.

250
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:56,740
LA County bans official travel to Florida over the don't say gay law.

251
00:12:56,740 --> 00:12:59,820
This is official travel, mind you, meaning state sponsored travel.

252
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:02,940
Private citizens can continue to evacuate California as it sinks into the ocean.

253
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:03,940
Don't worry.

254
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:05,300
But yeah, this is ultra fucking stupid.

255
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:09,140
Even using the phrase don't say gay is stupid because it's just another leftoid straw

256
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:12,440
man of what's going on, just like every other slogan, every other Mott and Bailey.

257
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:16,040
Nobody said don't say gay, just like nobody said that black lives don't matter or that

258
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:17,560
trans people don't have rights.

259
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:21,160
At the same time, we cannot pretend that everything that the left is currently screaming about

260
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:22,560
is completely unfounded.

261
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:26,040
As I mentioned in the concept creep video, parents are currently calling for the head

262
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:29,580
of a gay teacher who casually mentioned he was taking time off to get married.

263
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:33,100
And when asked about his soon to be wife by his students, he said he was going to have

264
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:34,360
a husband, actually.

265
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:38,200
Literally the reasonable example I mentioned early in this video of completely acceptable

266
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:40,000
mentioning of homosexuality to children?

267
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,360
Yeah, there are parents who are complaining about it now, and that's ridiculous.

268
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:46,640
The article reporting on this story actually describes three different stories.

269
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:50,080
The first is of Robert Tholander, a sixth grade teacher, who is the one that I talked

270
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,080
about.

271
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:54,520
The parents claim that marrying a man is not the issue, but sharing the details with the

272
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:55,520
students is.

273
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:59,280
The parents never describe what details he shared, but Tholander said he never went beyond

274
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:00,400
casually mentioning it.

275
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:03,680
To me, the parents are wrong, and according to the information that we have, this is pretty

276
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:04,680
unacceptable.

277
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:10,320
Solomon, a lesbian, who said the law would erase me as an LGBTQ teacher, nobody would

278
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:13,840
be able to know, which then puts me in the closet, and I'm there seven hours a day,

279
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:15,200
if not more, five days a week.

280
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:17,000
I wouldn't be able to be who I am.

281
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,800
The question is, what constitutes who you are that you can't do while you're teaching

282
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,320
math or English or whatever?

283
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,120
What vital experience would you be missing?

284
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:25,760
What avenue would be closed off to you?

285
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:28,880
Is it like Tholander's case, where you'd feel afraid of displaying a picture of your

286
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:32,400
girlfriend on your desk, or appropriately answering questions about your life?

287
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:35,560
If so, fair enough, but this story seems a bit vague to me.

288
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:39,720
Case three, Brian Kirkes, a gay man who asks his students for their preferred pronouns

289
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:43,360
at the beginning of every year, whose class has a safe space sign and a pride flag, and

290
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:47,100
who says, our students need to see that the educators in their community are as diverse

291
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:50,280
as the rest of the community, they need educators that look and resemble them.

292
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:53,520
Yeah, you might be the kind of person that conservative parents are worried about, dude.

293
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:56,480
It's interesting to me that the article lumps in these three people as if they're

294
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:57,480
in the same boat.

295
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:01,660
You've got one person who is openly advocating this ideology in defiance of the law and potentially

296
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:02,700
the wishes of the parents.

297
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:05,740
You've got one person who is very vague about what's going on, what they want, and

298
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:06,740
what they're doing.

299
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:10,340
And then you've got one person who is actually being unfairly treated due to the overzealousness

300
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:11,340
of parents.

301
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:13,220
These are not the same situations.

302
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:16,780
And emboldened by the Don't Say Gay bill and the discourse surrounding it, other events

303
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:18,420
are also being set into motion.

304
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:22,020
Doctors in Florida have all received this letter from the Florida Health Department,

305
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:25,860
informing them that under no circumstances should anybody under 18 receive any transitioning

306
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:30,180
treatment, including puberty blockers, hormone therapy, any form of surgery, or even socially

307
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:31,580
living as the other gender.

308
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:34,980
For all of those trans-trenders I mentioned earlier, this could actually probably help

309
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:35,980
them out quite a bit.

310
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:40,340
But for those few legitimate trans people, we do know that passing is easier if you start

311
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:41,340
earlier.

312
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:45,080
The question that makes transitioning legitimate is, are you actually trans?

313
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:48,140
And there's just not enough trust in the integrity and neutrality of the people who

314
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:49,900
are meant to ask that question right now.

315
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:53,480
In fact, it's considered transphobic to ask that question right now, which is just

316
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:54,480
ridiculous.

317
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:58,420
Meanwhile, Alabama has decided to make it a felony for healthcare workers to help transition

318
00:15:58,420 --> 00:16:00,420
anybody below 19, not 18.

319
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:04,100
Idaho has made it a life sentence to help transition anybody under 18, and has also

320
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:07,340
made it a felony for people to go to another state and then transition there.

321
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:11,700
In Missouri, there's currently a push to ban transitioning till the age of 25.

322
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:16,900
And to this, until their brains are fully developed at age 25, to comprehend the dramatic

323
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:21,340
and drastic and irreparable changes to their bodies.

324
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:25,460
Well, and that's something that I believe I've discussed in committee previously.

325
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:29,660
And I know when we had criminal justice reform, such as raise the age.

326
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:35,740
I think Republicans and Democrats both agreed when we passed that, that the brains of especially

327
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:39,020
males are still developing into their 20s.

328
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:43,820
And I don't understand why that's not part of the discussion herein.

329
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:45,300
This to me is absolutely ridiculous.

330
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:49,140
At 25, the state should shut its mouth about what you want to do with your body, period.

331
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:53,280
It's also important to note that most of these pieces of legislation have exemptions built

332
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:54,500
in for intersex people.

333
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:57,700
So if you're born with one of the various deformities that constitutes intersex, you

334
00:16:57,700 --> 00:17:01,740
can still get surgery and hormones as required to live as normally as possible.

335
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:06,860
A lot of trans activism likes to rely on intersex issues as a talking point, but trans people

336
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:07,860
are not intersex.

337
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:11,480
I've heard from multiple people that the Don't Say Gay bill is the tip of the iceberg.

338
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:14,540
And there's actually 240 anti-trans bills right now being debated.

339
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:16,900
I don't know where that number comes from, but I've heard it a lot.

340
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:20,340
What I do know, though, is that there's a Twitter account called Trans Bill Tracker,

341
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:23,840
which is posting all of the various anti-trans legislation working its way through the system

342
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:24,840
right now.

343
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:29,840
This is, to me, reasonable stuff, like legislation regarding gender segregation in school sports.

344
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:33,780
Some of the legislation is stuff related to paperwork and IDs, like banning non-binary

345
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:36,360
from being used on an official state ID card.

346
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:40,240
And on this account, insofar as Don't Say Gay-related stuff is concerned, we can see

347
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:45,040
copycat bills like Oklahoma following suit and banning classroom instruction on sexual

348
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:47,640
identity and gender expression from kindergarten to grade five.

349
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:49,960
To be honest, I could sit here and scroll through this account for a while, and I could

350
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:52,880
probably find bills I disagree with, bills I agree with, and bills I just don't care

351
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:53,880
about.

352
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:54,920
That's where the 240 number comes from.

353
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:58,520
In any case, though, there does seem to be a rise of legislation that goes against the

354
00:17:58,520 --> 00:17:59,520
LGBT agenda.

355
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:04,140
But that's because that political agenda is not universally good or correct or even

356
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:05,140
supported by people.

357
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:09,220
The trans lobby is not always right on every single thing all the time.

358
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:11,380
The big problem here is what I said earlier.

359
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:15,080
If transness is an immutable characteristic, and for the legitimate trans people, I think

360
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:18,040
it is, that is something that you know from a very young age.

361
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:21,780
The legitimate trans experience, as I've had it described to me by several trans people

362
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:25,980
now, is one where, for as long as they can remember, there's been something very wrong

363
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:26,980
with them.

364
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:31,100
And as puberty began, it was accompanied not just with confusion or questions or weird

365
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:35,820
new feelings, but a deep disgust with one's own body, with what they're becoming and

366
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:39,860
how it intuitively doesn't feel like what they should be on some fundamental level.

367
00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:43,340
That's a completely different experience than people who are fine with who they are

368
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:46,320
but think it would be cool to be the other gender for aesthetic purposes.

369
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:50,060
The former is doing it because it's the best way we currently know how to alleviate

370
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:51,220
their dysphoric symptoms.

371
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:54,340
The latter is doing it because it's fun and cool and the thing that nets you the most

372
00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:55,920
social points online right now.

373
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:59,020
It's pretty clear which of the two I personally have no respect for.

374
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:03,960
The issue is, restricting transitioning even to 18 makes the lives of that tiny population

375
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:06,220
of real trans people significantly harder.

376
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:10,280
At the same time, it also provides a bulwark against ideologically possessed teachers from

377
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:13,180
pushing people who are trans-trenders, or people who are borderline, people who are

378
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:17,260
just confused, into a medical procedure that actually isn't for them and in fact will

379
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:18,860
be quite harmful to them.

380
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:22,400
The issue is that people just don't trust these teachers anymore.

381
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:25,920
If we lived in a world where politics were taken out of it on both sides, and transitioning

382
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:29,460
was only talked about as a medical treatment for people with legitimate dysphoria and it

383
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:33,260
was otherwise off the table, then maybe the larger public would trust the procedure.

384
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:34,660
But we don't live in that world.

385
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:38,760
The trust in the teachers or in the system is not present and as such we are seeing legislative

386
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,700
remedies with potential bad side effects.

387
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:44,340
All because the people in these positions of power have taken it upon themselves to

388
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:46,540
push a political agenda onto children.

389
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:49,260
And examining that agenda will be the topic of the next video.
