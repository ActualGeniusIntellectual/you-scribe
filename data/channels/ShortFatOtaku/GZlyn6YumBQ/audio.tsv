0	9640	I recently had a conversation with Lilith about the whole don't say gay thing that's
9640	10640	happening right now.
10640	13160	No, not in the tubcast, this was an offline talk.
13160	17020	Being trans, she took up the unapologetically pro-trans position, which I don't completely
17020	18020	agree with.
18020	20120	I'm not faulting her for it, it's an issue close to her heart.
20120	23520	I might be the same way if I were in her shoes, but I wanted to look at the topic as objectively
23520	24520	as I can.
24520	28600	And, spoiler alert, yeah, we're going to discover that neither side is exactly correct.
28600	29780	So let's get into it.
29780	33900	Florida's Parental Rights in Education Act, labeled as the Don't Say Gay Bill by
33900	38720	its critics, is a recently passed law that outlines new statutes for primary education
38720	41920	insofar as sexual orientation and gender identity is concerned.
41920	45460	The bill prohibits the discussion of these topics in a classroom setting from kindergarten
45460	46460	to grade three.
46460	47460	That's nine years old.
47460	49880	Naturally, this topic has got everybody's panties in a bunch.
49880	52760	Leftoids are screaming that this is homophobic and transphobic and it's going to result
52760	54340	in the deaths of trans kids.
54340	57380	Rightoids are screeching that this is necessary because the school system is inundated with
57380	61060	LGBT groomers who are pushing trans ideology onto impressionable children.
61060	65140	The funny thing is, everyone could just calm down and go read the bill and figure it out
65140	66140	for themselves.
66140	68980	It's not some omnibus legislation that's over 9000 pages.
68980	69980	It's seven pages long.
69980	72280	I'll leave it in the description if you want to read it yourself, but let's go over
72280	73280	the pertinent points.
73280	75780	The first point of contention is paragraph three.
75780	79820	Paragraphs one and two are basically blanket statements that schools have an obligation
79820	83680	to inform parents about a change in a student's health and, for the most part, leave those
83680	86160	health-related decisions in the hands of parents.
86160	90140	Paragraph three reads, Classroom instruction by school personnel or third parties on sexual
90140	94920	orientation or gender identity may not occur in kindergarten through grade three or in
94920	99080	a manner that is not age-appropriate or developmentally appropriate for students in accordance with
99080	100080	state standards.
100080	101080	That's it.
101080	104200	This is the bit of the legislation that went viral, that discussions on sexual orientation
104200	106760	or gender identity can't happen at all before grade four.
106760	109760	This is what opponents of the bill are calling Don't Say Gay.
109760	111600	So let's examine their criticisms.
111600	114240	Firstly, there's the moniker, Don't Say Gay.
114240	117600	Everything in the wording of this bill mentions gay or homosexual.
117600	119460	It just says sexual orientation.
119460	122600	That also means that you could just as easily call it the Don't Say Straight Bill.
122600	126640	The immediate counterargument to this is that heterosexuality is pretty normalized in society
126640	130400	over homosexuality, even now, and yeah, that's true, but it's also a necessary part of
130400	132280	being a reproducing species.
132280	136080	Young kids might not know what sex is, but for example, they'll be in the grocery store
136080	140160	with their parents and see other heterosexual couples with their kids together.
140160	144060	Heterosexuality is common and necessary, so it does naturally lead to an early understanding
144060	146340	of the idea, even if they don't know about sex.
146340	149900	And it's also very common to see situations like a kid sees a teacher with his wedding
149900	152740	photo on his desk and asks about it, and the teacher says that's his wife.
152740	156680	Or a situation where a kid overhears their young female teacher saying to a colleague
156680	160420	that she's going on a date that night, and all the kids go, ooh, like dumb kids do.
160420	161780	This is all stuff I'm sure we can remember happening.
161780	162780	None of it's bad.
162780	166740	It's all normal, even positive behavior, and it's all predicated on at least a basic
166740	170400	understanding of heterosexuality, even though at that age, kids wouldn't use that word
170400	171400	to describe it.
171400	174520	These normal behaviors might be made illegal under this bill, and I don't think it's
174520	175520	a good thing.
175520	179640	Secondly, a lot of progressives view the second half of paragraph three to be the weasel words
179640	182700	that allow schools to blanket ban all talk of sexuality.
182700	186720	Those words are, or in a manner that is not age-appropriate or developmentally appropriate
186720	188840	for students in accordance with state standards.
188840	192520	The obvious question here is, who is to say what is age-appropriate or developmentally
192520	193520	appropriate?
193520	196960	What if the powers that be are all a bunch of pearl-clutching Christian moms who don't
196960	199520	want their 17-year-olds to be taught about the existence of sex?
199520	201400	That seems kind of ridiculous to me, doesn't it?
201400	202960	Well, this is a wider issue.
202960	205040	It's with the very concept of law.
205040	208640	Almost every law, if you dig deep enough, has a bit written into it where it says, as
208640	210960	a reasonable person would consider, or whatever.
210960	213680	And the argument can always be made, who defines what's reasonable?
213680	217660	The person who views all hierarchies as corrupt and all interactions between people as games
217660	221200	of dominance will say that it's clearly power that defines what's reasonable.
221200	225440	Clearly, this opens the door for arbitrary prosecution based on politics, and maybe that's
225440	226440	the case.
226440	230040	The reason laws are necessarily written like this is because, legally, every term needs
230040	233560	to be defined, and then every term within the definition also needs to be defined, and
233560	237720	etc. etc. all the way down until you realize that language has no solid foundation and
237720	240840	all of its borders are necessarily fuzzy and it's all arbitrary anyway.
240840	243620	But nonetheless, we are grasping at real concepts here.
243620	247480	We are creating labels that map onto these concepts as accurately as we can, and we still
247480	249120	need language and laws.
249120	252760	So the whole, come on man, you know what I mean, clause is pretty common, and its presence
252760	255380	doesn't automatically constitute a valid criticism.
255380	259700	So that being the case, let's look at what those state standards that age appropriate
259700	262020	or developmentally appropriate is in accordance with.
262020	265540	Here's the CDC's report on the status of sexual education in Florida.
265540	269340	Local education agencies have the authority to choose or approve curriculum for sexual
269340	270740	health education instruction.
270740	275140	The option to either opt in or opt out of sexual health education, HIV prevention, and
275140	277740	STD prevention is not addressed.
277740	279580	Instruction regarding contraception is not addressed.
279580	283820	Abstinence is a required topic of instruction for sexual health education, HIV prevention,
283820	284820	and STD prevention.
285260	289140	The core topics addressed in Florida law are sexual health education, HIV prevention, and
289140	292620	STD prevention, though those are permitted by law, not required.
292620	296300	At first glance, this reads like there's just no sex ed at all in Florida, but that's
296300	297720	not necessarily the case.
297720	302500	According to CSIS, which is a sex ed advocacy group, sex ed is not currently mandated in
302500	303500	Florida.
303500	307760	Schools that do teach sex ed must emphasize abstinence as the expected social standard.
307760	311160	Since Florida schools are not required to provide sex ed to students, school districts
311160	314680	are left to decide what type of sex ed, if any, they provide to youth.
315540	318720	While some districts, such as Putnam County, mandate comprehensive sex ed, others, such
318720	321720	as St. Johns County, mandate abstinence-only instruction.
321720	325620	Regardless of how advanced a particular district's curriculum may be, state statute mandates
325620	330160	that HIV and AIDS instruction emphasize the benefits of heterosexual marriage.
330160	334920	So it seems to me that Florida isn't banning sex ed, it's just that the state government
334920	338760	is being hands-off on the topic, with the only mandate being, if you're going to talk
338760	342560	about preventing STDs, you need to bring up heterosexuality and abstinence.
342560	346160	And I mean, fair enough, I mentioned in my addictions video that being able to adhere
346160	350480	to abstinence is ultimately the problem, and that if you can, abstinence obviously works.
350480	352900	And this analysis tracks with the CDC's report.
352900	357460	The laws make no mention either positive or negative, either mandating or banning, trained
357460	362800	in structures teaching sex ed, a unified curriculum following federal standards, or medical accuracy,
362800	364940	all things that I'm sure leftoids don't like.
364940	369040	But the laws also make no mention of, either positive or negative, either mandating or
369040	373400	banning, parents being allowed to be involved in the review or approval of the curriculum,
373400	377800	age appropriateness of the curriculum, or a stance on practical instruction, all things
377800	379820	that I'm sure rightoids don't like.
379820	383800	Florida's sex ed laws are something you'd expect of a more libertarian, hands-off type
383800	387960	of approach, where their position on everything from accuracy of education, to standardization
387960	391600	of education, to parental ability to opt-in or opt-out, to age appropriateness, is all
391600	393920	just fuck it, let the school boards decide.
393920	397920	CSIS being a progressive mechanism isn't happy with this laid-back approach, and they
397920	402360	say it's going to harm LGBTQ and marginalized youth, but that's to be expected since that's
402360	403360	their political slant.
403360	406920	I don't know if this decentralized vision actually helps or hurts, but the point is,
406920	411840	when the don't-say-gay bill relies on state standards, the state standard seems to mostly
411840	414640	be the school boards decide this shit, not us.
414640	419280	So using those two CSIS examples, when it comes to teaching about sexual orientation
419280	423620	or gender identity, Putnam County might consider age-appropriate or developmentally-appropriate
423620	427740	to begin at grade 4, since that's the minimum that the bill allows, while St. John's County
427740	431120	might think it's appropriate to not discuss these topics at all regardless of age.
431120	435740	In other words, if there's any don't-say-gaying actually happening, it's not directly by the
435740	437900	state of Florida, it's by the local school boards.
437900	441100	The third point of contention is paragraph 5 in the bill.
441100	444760	At the beginning of the school year, each school district shall notify the parents of
444760	448300	each health care service offered at their student's school, and the option to withhold
448300	450720	consent or decline any specific service.
450720	453660	This enshrines the right of a parent to be notified about sex ed and have the option
453660	458220	to opt out, something that wasn't in Florida law before as we saw in that CDC analysis.
458220	461620	Some progs hate this because they believe that kids should be forced to take sex ed
461620	464700	regardless of how the parents feel about it, which I generally don't think is right.
464700	466540	At the same time, I can see their point of view.
466540	469720	There are some really shitty parents out there who shelter their kids or teach them factually
469720	473740	incorrect stuff, or abuse them, and sometimes school is the privacy away from the parent
473740	474980	that the kid needs.
474980	478460	Both parents and the government can misuse the authority they have over children.
478460	482700	The question seems to be, if misused, which has worse consequences?
482700	486860	During the most developmental years, parents can absolutely royally fuck up a kid for the
486860	487900	rest of their lives.
487900	490740	But as they get older, especially into the double digits, I would say that it's the
490740	493740	government, for the sole fact that at least with the parents, you can cut them off if
493740	494740	you have to.
494740	495740	You can't do that with a state.
495740	497680	The fourth complaint is about paragraph 7.
497680	501340	This is pretty long, so basically, 7 reads that parents have a mechanism to complain
501340	504620	to the school, and that complaint must be replied to within 7 days.
504620	508300	After 30 days, if the complaint isn't resolved, the parent has the right to arbitration by
508300	511220	a magistrate or can bring a court action against the school district.
511220	514660	A lot of progs are saying that this allows parents to sue the school for teaching their
514660	517300	kid about the gays, but that's not fully accurate.
517300	521900	Remember, paragraph 5 allows parents to have their child opt out of sex education.
521900	525740	Paragraph 7, meanwhile, allows parents to complain and have that complaint considered.
525740	529160	So let's say that a parent has decided that their kid isn't going to be taught sex ed,
529160	531180	and they opt out as per paragraph 5.
531180	535280	That parent can only file a complaint under paragraph 7 if the school went behind their
535280	540020	backs and taught the kid sex ed anyway, and that parent can only pursue damages if the
540020	542180	school ignored their complaint.
542180	546340	Parents cannot go after schools for teaching sex ed to everyone, because paragraph 5 limits
546340	549180	the scope of a parent's control to only their own children.
549180	553420	So if some dumb Karen wanted not only her precious baby to not be in sex ed, but wanted
553420	556780	the school to stop offering sex ed for everyone, she'd be shit out of luck.
556780	560300	And if she filed a complaint under paragraph 7, properly resolving the complaint would
560300	562840	constitute the school board telling her to go pound sand.
562840	566740	The fifth problem is that I've heard some people on the left also say that the options
566740	571420	for relief under paragraph 8 mark new territory, that parents could not sue schools for this
571420	572420	sort of thing before.
572420	573420	That's just not true.
573420	577340	And in fact, up here in Canada, we make fun of how sue-happy Americans are, especially
577340	578340	when it comes to schools.
578340	582940	In 2012, parents in California sued a school district over only offering abstinence-only
582940	585860	education, wanting more options for sex ed for their kids.
585860	590700	In 2005, parents in Maryland sued to stop discussions about homosexuality and sex ed,
590700	593660	as well as the screening of a video showing how to properly put a condom on.
593660	598580	In 2010, a mother in Montana sued the school due to sex ed there involving kindergarteners
598580	602740	through grade 3 learning about human anatomy and fifth grade students learning about different
602740	604060	types of sexual activity.
604060	606340	Hell, back in 1994 this shit was happening.
606340	607700	This isn't anything new.
607700	612300	Sixth, a lot of progs are also worried that involving parents in their children's education
612300	615860	this much will mean that the kids who are legitimately gay or trans will be hurt by
615860	619740	the system, as the teachers and school staff will have an obligation to inform the parents
619740	621520	about the status of their children's health.
621520	625200	So if you're a closeted gay kid and your homophobic parents would disown you or beat
625200	628340	you or kill you if they knew, yeah, that's actually a real concern.
628340	631800	And the progs believe that this bill will empower those parents in the abuse of their
631800	634560	children and force schools to become an accomplice to it.
634560	638020	But that's because, even though the bill is only seven pages, the progs still never
638020	639200	bothered to read it.
639200	642840	In paragraph 2, that paragraph I skipped over earlier, that outlines the parents' right
642840	646460	to be informed about their kids' health, has a clause for just such an occasion.
646460	650320	This sub-paragraph does not prohibit a school district from adopting procedures that permit
650320	655000	school personnel to withhold such information from a parent if a reasonably prudent person
655000	658480	would believe that disclosure would result in abuse, abandonment, or neglect.
658480	662060	Again, we've got the reasonably prudent person problem here, but this seems like pretty
662060	663160	concrete protection.
663160	665800	And finally, there's the it's good when we do it argument.
665800	668760	It's good to go against the consent of parents, to sneak around and keep things in the dark.
668760	671440	It's good to teach kids about this stuff even if their parents don't want it, because
671440	673920	it hurts trans kids to not know that they're trans.
673920	675720	And maybe, fair enough.
675720	679220	While I do think that the massive inflation of numbers of trans people can be genuinely
679220	682900	chalked up to trans-trenders right now, there are absolutely a small minority of people
682900	687020	who are really trans from birth, and it would likely make their lives a lot better if they
687020	688700	knew what that was at a young age.
688700	693300	The issue is, though, nobody trusts these teachers with political agendas to be neutral
693300	694740	arbiters of the topic.
694740	696220	In fact, we know that they're not.
696220	698700	That's literally what it's good when we do it means.
698700	704180	It is normal, expected, and reasonable for conservative parents to not trust the blue-haired,
704180	707820	non-binary teachers dancing and singing about how they're converting children on the lives
707820	712580	of TikTok, just like it would be normal, accepted, and reasonable for the progs to not trust
712580	716700	conservative teachers in a world where separation of church and state was abolished and suddenly
716700	720280	gay kids had to attend a totally neutral Bible study class.
720280	725140	So no, I personally don't think that Florida's don't say gay bill is a huge problem.
725140	728860	It does have a few areas where things are vague enough that somebody with a bad agenda
728860	733720	could use it improperly, but the general request of don't teach kids this gender ideology
733720	736620	shit until they hit the double digits seems to be reasonable to me.
736620	739940	And on the one hand, the reaction to this has been histrionic.
739940	743200	We just lost the ability to exist in an entire state before age 19.
743200	744540	What the fuck are you talking about?
744540	746860	These schools will still have gay and trans kids.
746860	749900	They're just not going to be taught about it by teachers until grade four, slow your
749900	750900	fucking roll.
750900	754420	People are also trying to link that gay bar that burned down in Brooklyn to the don't
754420	758740	say gay thing, spinning a narrative that anti-gay and anti-trans violence is on the rise and
758740	761980	that society is going to start mass oppressing adults again for doing what they want with
761980	763100	their lives and bodies.
763100	764100	To me, I don't see the correlation.
764100	766780	I don't think that there's actually a connection between teaching children about
766780	770580	sexuality in inappropriate ages and consenting sexual behavior between adults.
770580	773100	And personally, I would have to wonder about the person who does.
773100	776740	LA County bans official travel to Florida over the don't say gay law.
776740	779820	This is official travel, mind you, meaning state sponsored travel.
779820	782940	Private citizens can continue to evacuate California as it sinks into the ocean.
782940	783940	Don't worry.
783940	785300	But yeah, this is ultra fucking stupid.
785300	789140	Even using the phrase don't say gay is stupid because it's just another leftoid straw
789140	792440	man of what's going on, just like every other slogan, every other Mott and Bailey.
792440	796040	Nobody said don't say gay, just like nobody said that black lives don't matter or that
796040	797560	trans people don't have rights.
797560	801160	At the same time, we cannot pretend that everything that the left is currently screaming about
801160	802560	is completely unfounded.
802560	806040	As I mentioned in the concept creep video, parents are currently calling for the head
806040	809580	of a gay teacher who casually mentioned he was taking time off to get married.
809580	813100	And when asked about his soon to be wife by his students, he said he was going to have
813100	814360	a husband, actually.
814360	818200	Literally the reasonable example I mentioned early in this video of completely acceptable
818200	820000	mentioning of homosexuality to children?
820000	823360	Yeah, there are parents who are complaining about it now, and that's ridiculous.
823360	826640	The article reporting on this story actually describes three different stories.
826640	830080	The first is of Robert Tholander, a sixth grade teacher, who is the one that I talked
830080	831080	about.
831080	834520	The parents claim that marrying a man is not the issue, but sharing the details with the
834520	835520	students is.
835520	839280	The parents never describe what details he shared, but Tholander said he never went beyond
839280	840400	casually mentioning it.
840400	843680	To me, the parents are wrong, and according to the information that we have, this is pretty
843680	844680	unacceptable.
845640	850320	Solomon, a lesbian, who said the law would erase me as an LGBTQ teacher, nobody would
850320	853840	be able to know, which then puts me in the closet, and I'm there seven hours a day,
853840	855200	if not more, five days a week.
855200	857000	I wouldn't be able to be who I am.
857000	860800	The question is, what constitutes who you are that you can't do while you're teaching
860800	862320	math or English or whatever?
862320	864120	What vital experience would you be missing?
864120	865760	What avenue would be closed off to you?
865760	868880	Is it like Tholander's case, where you'd feel afraid of displaying a picture of your
868880	872400	girlfriend on your desk, or appropriately answering questions about your life?
872400	875560	If so, fair enough, but this story seems a bit vague to me.
875560	879720	Case three, Brian Kirkes, a gay man who asks his students for their preferred pronouns
879720	883360	at the beginning of every year, whose class has a safe space sign and a pride flag, and
883360	887100	who says, our students need to see that the educators in their community are as diverse
887100	890280	as the rest of the community, they need educators that look and resemble them.
890280	893520	Yeah, you might be the kind of person that conservative parents are worried about, dude.
893520	896480	It's interesting to me that the article lumps in these three people as if they're
896480	897480	in the same boat.
897480	901660	You've got one person who is openly advocating this ideology in defiance of the law and potentially
901660	902700	the wishes of the parents.
902700	905740	You've got one person who is very vague about what's going on, what they want, and
905740	906740	what they're doing.
906740	910340	And then you've got one person who is actually being unfairly treated due to the overzealousness
910340	911340	of parents.
911340	913220	These are not the same situations.
913220	916780	And emboldened by the Don't Say Gay bill and the discourse surrounding it, other events
916780	918420	are also being set into motion.
918420	922020	Doctors in Florida have all received this letter from the Florida Health Department,
922020	925860	informing them that under no circumstances should anybody under 18 receive any transitioning
925860	930180	treatment, including puberty blockers, hormone therapy, any form of surgery, or even socially
930180	931580	living as the other gender.
931580	934980	For all of those trans-trenders I mentioned earlier, this could actually probably help
934980	935980	them out quite a bit.
935980	940340	But for those few legitimate trans people, we do know that passing is easier if you start
940340	941340	earlier.
941340	945080	The question that makes transitioning legitimate is, are you actually trans?
945080	948140	And there's just not enough trust in the integrity and neutrality of the people who
948140	949900	are meant to ask that question right now.
949900	953480	In fact, it's considered transphobic to ask that question right now, which is just
953480	954480	ridiculous.
954480	958420	Meanwhile, Alabama has decided to make it a felony for healthcare workers to help transition
958420	960420	anybody below 19, not 18.
960420	964100	Idaho has made it a life sentence to help transition anybody under 18, and has also
964100	967340	made it a felony for people to go to another state and then transition there.
967340	971700	In Missouri, there's currently a push to ban transitioning till the age of 25.
971700	976900	And to this, until their brains are fully developed at age 25, to comprehend the dramatic
976900	981340	and drastic and irreparable changes to their bodies.
981340	985460	Well, and that's something that I believe I've discussed in committee previously.
985460	989660	And I know when we had criminal justice reform, such as raise the age.
989700	995740	I think Republicans and Democrats both agreed when we passed that, that the brains of especially
995740	999020	males are still developing into their 20s.
999020	1003820	And I don't understand why that's not part of the discussion herein.
1003820	1005300	This to me is absolutely ridiculous.
1005300	1009140	At 25, the state should shut its mouth about what you want to do with your body, period.
1009140	1013280	It's also important to note that most of these pieces of legislation have exemptions built
1013280	1014500	in for intersex people.
1014500	1017700	So if you're born with one of the various deformities that constitutes intersex, you
1017700	1021740	can still get surgery and hormones as required to live as normally as possible.
1021740	1026860	A lot of trans activism likes to rely on intersex issues as a talking point, but trans people
1026860	1027860	are not intersex.
1027860	1031480	I've heard from multiple people that the Don't Say Gay bill is the tip of the iceberg.
1031480	1034540	And there's actually 240 anti-trans bills right now being debated.
1034540	1036900	I don't know where that number comes from, but I've heard it a lot.
1036900	1040340	What I do know, though, is that there's a Twitter account called Trans Bill Tracker,
1040340	1043840	which is posting all of the various anti-trans legislation working its way through the system
1043840	1044840	right now.
1044840	1049840	This is, to me, reasonable stuff, like legislation regarding gender segregation in school sports.
1049840	1053780	Some of the legislation is stuff related to paperwork and IDs, like banning non-binary
1053780	1056360	from being used on an official state ID card.
1056360	1060240	And on this account, insofar as Don't Say Gay-related stuff is concerned, we can see
1060240	1065040	copycat bills like Oklahoma following suit and banning classroom instruction on sexual
1065040	1067640	identity and gender expression from kindergarten to grade five.
1067640	1069960	To be honest, I could sit here and scroll through this account for a while, and I could
1069960	1072880	probably find bills I disagree with, bills I agree with, and bills I just don't care
1072880	1073880	about.
1073920	1074920	That's where the 240 number comes from.
1074920	1078520	In any case, though, there does seem to be a rise of legislation that goes against the
1078520	1079520	LGBT agenda.
1079520	1084140	But that's because that political agenda is not universally good or correct or even
1084140	1085140	supported by people.
1085140	1089220	The trans lobby is not always right on every single thing all the time.
1089220	1091380	The big problem here is what I said earlier.
1091380	1095080	If transness is an immutable characteristic, and for the legitimate trans people, I think
1095080	1098040	it is, that is something that you know from a very young age.
1098040	1101780	The legitimate trans experience, as I've had it described to me by several trans people
1101780	1105980	now, is one where, for as long as they can remember, there's been something very wrong
1105980	1106980	with them.
1106980	1111100	And as puberty began, it was accompanied not just with confusion or questions or weird
1111100	1115820	new feelings, but a deep disgust with one's own body, with what they're becoming and
1115820	1119860	how it intuitively doesn't feel like what they should be on some fundamental level.
1119860	1123340	That's a completely different experience than people who are fine with who they are
1123340	1126320	but think it would be cool to be the other gender for aesthetic purposes.
1126320	1130060	The former is doing it because it's the best way we currently know how to alleviate
1130060	1131220	their dysphoric symptoms.
1131220	1134340	The latter is doing it because it's fun and cool and the thing that nets you the most
1134340	1135920	social points online right now.
1135920	1139020	It's pretty clear which of the two I personally have no respect for.
1139020	1143960	The issue is, restricting transitioning even to 18 makes the lives of that tiny population
1143960	1146220	of real trans people significantly harder.
1146220	1150280	At the same time, it also provides a bulwark against ideologically possessed teachers from
1150280	1153180	pushing people who are trans-trenders, or people who are borderline, people who are
1153180	1157260	just confused, into a medical procedure that actually isn't for them and in fact will
1157260	1158860	be quite harmful to them.
1158860	1162400	The issue is that people just don't trust these teachers anymore.
1162400	1165920	If we lived in a world where politics were taken out of it on both sides, and transitioning
1165920	1169460	was only talked about as a medical treatment for people with legitimate dysphoria and it
1169460	1173260	was otherwise off the table, then maybe the larger public would trust the procedure.
1173260	1174660	But we don't live in that world.
1174660	1178760	The trust in the teachers or in the system is not present and as such we are seeing legislative
1178760	1180700	remedies with potential bad side effects.
1180700	1184340	All because the people in these positions of power have taken it upon themselves to
1184340	1186540	push a political agenda onto children.
1186540	1189260	And examining that agenda will be the topic of the next video.
