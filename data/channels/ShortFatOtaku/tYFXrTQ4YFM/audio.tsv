0	1880	Hey guys, Dev here.
1880	4640	Stick around to the end of the video because I have some announcements to make, if you
4640	5640	don't mind.
5640	10120	I'm sure at this point, everyone knows who George Floyd is.
10120	12000	Very quickly, in case you don't.
12000	19560	On May 25th, 2020, George Floyd was killed by Derek Chauvin, a Minneapolis police officer.
19560	25560	During Floyd's arrest, Chauvin put his knee on Floyd's neck for 8 minutes and 46 seconds.
25560	27840	A video of the killing went viral.
27840	32380	And in it, if you have the stomach to do so, you can actually watch George Floyd die.
32380	36840	The Minneapolis Police Department's first move was to cover it up, as most American
36840	38120	PDs do, generally.
38120	41060	Here's a statement regarding the official autopsy.
41060	46160	The autopsy revealed no physical findings that support a diagnosis of traumatic asphyxia
46160	47640	or strangulation.
47640	52600	Mr. Floyd had underlying health conditions, including coronary artery disease and hypertensive
52600	53600	heart disease.
53780	58960	The combined effects of Mr. Floyd being restrained by the police, his underlying health conditions,
58960	63820	and any potential intoxicants in his system likely contributed to his death.
63820	68520	This was the Police Department's attempt to basically wave away the blame, and it was
68520	69840	quickly dropped.
69840	72740	Especially when a second coroner's opinion came out.
72740	73860	Cause of death.
73860	79760	Cardiopulmonary arrest complicating law enforcement subdual, restraint and neck compression.
79760	80760	Manner of death.
80760	81760	Homicide.
81760	83280	How injury occurred.
83280	88160	Decedent experienced a cardiopulmonary arrest while being restrained by law enforcement
88160	89420	officers.
89420	91020	Other significant conditions.
91020	94280	Ardeosclerotic and hypertensive heart disease.
94280	96080	Fentanyl intoxication.
96080	98240	Recent methamphetamine use.
98240	102660	I recall a few weeks ago, the common consensus was that the American people were being gaslit
102660	106440	by the Minneapolis Police Department, as well as those media outlets that were publishing
106440	113280	their propaganda, which said stuff like, any potential toxicants in his system likely
113280	118940	contributed to his death, but it turns out, no, he had actually recently used meth.
118940	121260	And man, it always ends up being this way, doesn't it?
121260	125460	How many times have we seen now, where a police officer kills somebody, usually, but not always
125460	126460	a black person.
126460	130600	The community is outraged, there's peaceful protests, there's riots, but then as the
130600	135040	wheels of justice continue to move, they discover that the victim was not just an innocent boy
135040	139000	going to college, but he may have actually done something wrong.
139000	141120	So let's examine the possibility.
141120	143880	Does George Floyd fall into that category?
143880	147920	According to court records in Houston, which is where George Floyd used to live, he was
147920	149820	arrested seven times.
149820	151460	Drug possession in 1997.
151460	153660	Two counts of theft in 1998.
153660	158080	Failure to identify, which you have to do as a fugitive, obviously, in 2001.
158080	160000	Drug possession, 2002.
160000	161540	Trespassing, 2003.
161540	163540	Drug possession, 2004.
163540	165260	Weapon, 2005.
165260	168300	Aggravated robbery with a deadly weapon, 2007.
168300	170660	That last charge is the most interesting.
170660	171660	Here's the story.
171660	177840	George Floyd and five other people arrived at the house of Araceli Henriquez and Angel
177840	180540	Negrete, as well as their young toddler.
180540	184980	One of them, it's not clear if it was George Floyd or somebody else, was dressed in a blue
184980	187720	uniform and said they were with the water department.
187720	191400	When Henriquez opened the door, the man forced himself into the house.
191400	195960	At the same time, five other men arrived in a black Ford Explorer.
195960	201440	The largest of the six, presumably George Floyd because George Floyd is 6'7", placed
201440	206160	a pistol against Henriquez's abdomen and forced her into the living room area of the
206160	207160	residence.
207160	212240	This large suspect proceeded to search the residence while another armed suspect guarded
212240	216240	Henriquez, who was struck in the head after she tried to scream for help.
216240	220800	As the six suspects looked through the residence, they demanded to know where drugs and money
220800	224160	were, and Henriquez told them there were no such things in the residence.
224160	228040	The suspects then took some jewelry along with a cell phone before they fled the scene
228040	230020	in their black Ford Explorer.
230020	235140	Three months later, the black Ford Explorer was found, and George Floyd was the driver.
235140	237540	George Floyd pled guilty in 2009.
237540	242240	He was sentenced to five years in prison, and he got out on parole in 2013.
242240	245900	After getting out of jail, George Floyd turned his life around, at least for a little bit.
245900	248400	Multiple articles have been written about the subject.
248400	251520	After jail, he moved to Minneapolis, hoping to start a new life.
251520	256280	He left at least one child behind in order to do so, but fine, he moves on with his life.
256280	257280	He gets married.
257280	258440	He has more kids.
258440	260920	He becomes a mentor of other young people in his community.
260920	262160	He works with his church.
262160	265920	He helped his mother exercise and recuperate after she had a stroke.
265920	268880	He worked as a truck driver, a bouncer, and a security guard.
268880	273240	A few months before his death, he lost his job as the bouncer of a bar because of the
273240	278280	whole coronavirus thing, and he in fact contracted coronavirus himself and later recovered.
278280	286320	George Floyd's crime was trying to pass off a counterfeit $20 bill at a Cup Foods location.
286320	291040	According to an interview with the owner of that Cup Foods location on The Cut, the owner
291040	295460	knew Floyd, calling him a big teddy bear who would come to the location a few times a week
295460	298760	to pay his cell phone bill, and said that they always got along.
298760	301040	However, the owner wasn't there that night.
301040	302260	Other employees were.
302260	306400	And according to testimony from those two employees published on the Washington Post,
306400	310040	when they realized that George Floyd had used a counterfeit $20 to buy cigarettes, and that
310040	313520	he was still sitting in his vehicle across the street, they went to confront him.
313520	318760	Not only did Floyd refuse to return the cigarettes, he apparently seemed awfully drunk and not
318760	320360	in control of himself.
320360	324980	When the police finally arrived, George Floyd struggled with them as they pulled him out
324980	325980	of his car.
325980	329780	And although he was quite calm while sitting on the street talking to the officers, when
329780	333480	they decided to put him in their police car, he again resisted, which is what led to the
333480	335640	8 minutes and 46 seconds.
335640	342840	So we're talking about a man who has an extensive criminal history, who seems to have tried
342840	348640	multiple times to turn his life around, doing legitimate good in the process, but who continued
348640	354040	to commit petty theft and various other minor crimes up until his death at the hands of
354040	355440	the police officers.
355820	361220	George Floyd wasn't a saint, despite the deification he's currently receiving by a lot of progressives
361220	362220	right now.
362220	363980	But I want to make it absolutely clear.
363980	368040	It doesn't matter what George Floyd's crimes actually were.
368040	370620	He should not have been killed in the street.
370620	372900	This guy could have been a serial killer.
372900	375020	He could have been a child molester.
375020	376340	It doesn't matter.
376340	381080	It doesn't matter what his crimes were, whether large or small, because now he will never
381080	382980	be brought to justice for them.
383120	387680	Unless a suspect is actively resisting arrest, like if he has a gun and he was pointing at
387680	392680	a police officer and the cop had to shoot him or be shot, and then the suspect got killed,
392680	395080	it's regrettable, but fine.
395080	396480	That's not this case.
396480	398320	There were four officers there.
398320	399700	They had him arrested.
399700	401480	They had him restrained.
401480	405600	There were other things they could have done aside from fucking murder him.
405600	410720	Regardless of his crimes, what should have happened to George Floyd was that he be detained,
410780	416300	read his rights, arrested, brought in, provided legal counsel, and be allowed to live to see
416300	417940	his day in court.
417940	423060	And the fact that he is dead at the hands of the police is a miscarriage of justice.
423060	427900	George Floyd may not have been innocent, but he certainly didn't deserve to die.
430300	435340	Whew, that was a, that was a rough video to make, and actually based on the script that
435340	438260	I had written and the amount of evidence that I had up, I actually thought it'd be longer
438260	439260	than that.
439640	444360	Hope you don't mind me filling out the rest of the video with an announcement.
444360	447480	I know that I've been away from the SFO channel for a while.
447480	452260	The political videos have been kind of dry for the past two weeks, but I'm now back to
452260	453260	doing it.
453260	456920	The story as to why I was gone is probably just pretty boring to you guys.
456920	460400	If you've heard me talk on Discord or on my gaming stream or whatever, you've probably
460400	467880	heard it already, but basically it was a combination of being completely inundated with almost
467940	469500	too much information.
469500	474100	When you have hundreds of links or thousands of links and they have to be catalogued and
474100	478500	then turned into a workable script, you get a lot of projects that end up being started
478500	480060	but not finished.
480060	482380	And that has been a consistent problem with my workflow.
482380	489300	I have three or four videos related to the current riot situation, but every day there's
489300	494140	like, there's more sources, there's more news, and the videos become too big.
494140	499880	And I basically need to get a handle on actually nailing something down and getting it out
499880	502280	and basically putting my own perfectionism aside.
502280	505120	And I know that I've talked about this before and so have other creators, but the worst
505120	508840	part about it is that when you skip a few days trying to make the video good, there's
508840	512440	like pressure on you to make an even better video, which then leads to more time, which
512440	516280	then leads to more time before the video comes out, which then leads to it even being later,
516280	522180	and it becomes this snowballing nightmare of me being gone for two weeks and organizing
522180	525920	a dozen video topics and not actually doing any of them.
525920	530200	So basically my solution to this was to just be like, you know what, fuck it.
530200	534160	I'm doing a small video just to talk about something, just to get myself back in front
534160	539320	of the mic again, and then that wipes out one topic and basically gets me started again.
539320	543720	So this tiny video will hopefully lead to more videos in the coming days.
543720	546840	This probably just sounds dumb to you and I would completely understand it if you viewed
546840	551120	it that way, because frankly it sounds kind of dumb to me, but basically sometimes things
551120	555120	get away from me and I don't want to put out a lackluster product, so I just keep working
555120	557840	at stuff and then it just turns into a giant nightmare.
557840	562620	And ironically enough, the solution seems to be doing something that I hate to do, which
562620	568220	is put out a short video that is hyper-focused on one thing, in this case it was just George
568220	572500	Floyd's record, and allowing that to snowball me in a positive direction instead of a negative
572500	573500	one.
573500	575380	In any case, I've got an announcement to make.
575380	577860	I now have a P.O. box.
577860	584340	People have been asking for a while now, hey Dev, where or how can I mail you things?
584340	590860	And for a while I actually had my address up on a video, I've now since taken down the
590860	596580	video, ever since my local Antifa goons have been trying to find out where I live, I said
596580	601360	you know what, maybe I should take down that video that has my address in it, but basically
601360	602700	I now have a P.O. box.
602700	607140	If you want to mail me stuff, you can do so at the address on the screen.
607140	609940	I'll check it probably once a week or once every two weeks or something, I don't expect
609940	613240	to be flooded with mail or anything, but if you want to mail me something and you want
613240	616540	me to unbox it on the Weekly Sip, I can do that.
616540	619900	If you want me to just have something that you for some reason really just want me to
619900	620900	have, that's fine.
620900	624840	If you want to send me games to play on Game Boomers, sure, if it's like a physical game
624840	629540	I'll put it at the start of the pile for us to play new games with.
629540	633400	Maybe books that I can read or do reviews of, I'm down with that too.
633400	638540	Please don't mail me poison or glitter bombs or other bad things, okay?
638540	641220	I'd rather not die.
641220	647700	I mean, maybe that's an unreasonable request, but basically don't mail me stuff that'll
647700	652640	be a big mess or that'll actually be damaging to me or somebody, or that'll get me like,
652640	655460	I don't know, put on a watch list, I'm not sure.
655460	658500	But basically don't do that, okay, if you don't mind.
658500	662800	So thanks very much for continuing to support me and sticking with me, and I'll see you
662800	666320	guys in the next video, which will hopefully be tomorrow.
666320	668540	And hopefully it'll be a lot longer than this one.
668540	670640	Alright, I'm outta here.
670640	671140	I love you.
