1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,880
Hey guys, Dev here.

2
00:00:01,880 --> 00:00:04,640
Stick around to the end of the video because I have some announcements to make, if you

3
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:05,640
don't mind.

4
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:10,120
I'm sure at this point, everyone knows who George Floyd is.

5
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:12,000
Very quickly, in case you don't.

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:19,560
On May 25th, 2020, George Floyd was killed by Derek Chauvin, a Minneapolis police officer.

7
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:25,560
During Floyd's arrest, Chauvin put his knee on Floyd's neck for 8 minutes and 46 seconds.

8
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:27,840
A video of the killing went viral.

9
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:32,380
And in it, if you have the stomach to do so, you can actually watch George Floyd die.

10
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:36,840
The Minneapolis Police Department's first move was to cover it up, as most American

11
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:38,120
PDs do, generally.

12
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:41,060
Here's a statement regarding the official autopsy.

13
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:46,160
The autopsy revealed no physical findings that support a diagnosis of traumatic asphyxia

14
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:47,640
or strangulation.

15
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:52,600
Mr. Floyd had underlying health conditions, including coronary artery disease and hypertensive

16
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:53,600
heart disease.

17
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:58,960
The combined effects of Mr. Floyd being restrained by the police, his underlying health conditions,

18
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:03,820
and any potential intoxicants in his system likely contributed to his death.

19
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:08,520
This was the Police Department's attempt to basically wave away the blame, and it was

20
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:09,840
quickly dropped.

21
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,740
Especially when a second coroner's opinion came out.

22
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:13,860
Cause of death.

23
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:19,760
Cardiopulmonary arrest complicating law enforcement subdual, restraint and neck compression.

24
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:20,760
Manner of death.

25
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:21,760
Homicide.

26
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:23,280
How injury occurred.

27
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:28,160
Decedent experienced a cardiopulmonary arrest while being restrained by law enforcement

28
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:29,420
officers.

29
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:31,020
Other significant conditions.

30
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:34,280
Ardeosclerotic and hypertensive heart disease.

31
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:36,080
Fentanyl intoxication.

32
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:38,240
Recent methamphetamine use.

33
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:42,660
I recall a few weeks ago, the common consensus was that the American people were being gaslit

34
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:46,440
by the Minneapolis Police Department, as well as those media outlets that were publishing

35
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:53,280
their propaganda, which said stuff like, any potential toxicants in his system likely

36
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:58,940
contributed to his death, but it turns out, no, he had actually recently used meth.

37
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:01,260
And man, it always ends up being this way, doesn't it?

38
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:05,460
How many times have we seen now, where a police officer kills somebody, usually, but not always

39
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:06,460
a black person.

40
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:10,600
The community is outraged, there's peaceful protests, there's riots, but then as the

41
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:15,040
wheels of justice continue to move, they discover that the victim was not just an innocent boy

42
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:19,000
going to college, but he may have actually done something wrong.

43
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,120
So let's examine the possibility.

44
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,880
Does George Floyd fall into that category?

45
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:27,920
According to court records in Houston, which is where George Floyd used to live, he was

46
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,820
arrested seven times.

47
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:31,460
Drug possession in 1997.

48
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:33,660
Two counts of theft in 1998.

49
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:38,080
Failure to identify, which you have to do as a fugitive, obviously, in 2001.

50
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,000
Drug possession, 2002.

51
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,540
Trespassing, 2003.

52
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:43,540
Drug possession, 2004.

53
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:45,260
Weapon, 2005.

54
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:48,300
Aggravated robbery with a deadly weapon, 2007.

55
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:50,660
That last charge is the most interesting.

56
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:51,660
Here's the story.

57
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:57,840
George Floyd and five other people arrived at the house of Araceli Henriquez and Angel

58
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,540
Negrete, as well as their young toddler.

59
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:04,980
One of them, it's not clear if it was George Floyd or somebody else, was dressed in a blue

60
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:07,720
uniform and said they were with the water department.

61
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:11,400
When Henriquez opened the door, the man forced himself into the house.

62
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:15,960
At the same time, five other men arrived in a black Ford Explorer.

63
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:21,440
The largest of the six, presumably George Floyd because George Floyd is 6'7", placed

64
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:26,160
a pistol against Henriquez's abdomen and forced her into the living room area of the

65
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:27,160
residence.

66
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:32,240
This large suspect proceeded to search the residence while another armed suspect guarded

67
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:36,240
Henriquez, who was struck in the head after she tried to scream for help.

68
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:40,800
As the six suspects looked through the residence, they demanded to know where drugs and money

69
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:44,160
were, and Henriquez told them there were no such things in the residence.

70
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:48,040
The suspects then took some jewelry along with a cell phone before they fled the scene

71
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:50,020
in their black Ford Explorer.

72
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:55,140
Three months later, the black Ford Explorer was found, and George Floyd was the driver.

73
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:57,540
George Floyd pled guilty in 2009.

74
00:03:57,540 --> 00:04:02,240
He was sentenced to five years in prison, and he got out on parole in 2013.

75
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:05,900
After getting out of jail, George Floyd turned his life around, at least for a little bit.

76
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:08,400
Multiple articles have been written about the subject.

77
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,520
After jail, he moved to Minneapolis, hoping to start a new life.

78
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:16,280
He left at least one child behind in order to do so, but fine, he moves on with his life.

79
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:17,280
He gets married.

80
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,440
He has more kids.

81
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:20,920
He becomes a mentor of other young people in his community.

82
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:22,160
He works with his church.

83
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:25,920
He helped his mother exercise and recuperate after she had a stroke.

84
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:28,880
He worked as a truck driver, a bouncer, and a security guard.

85
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:33,240
A few months before his death, he lost his job as the bouncer of a bar because of the

86
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:38,280
whole coronavirus thing, and he in fact contracted coronavirus himself and later recovered.

87
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:46,320
George Floyd's crime was trying to pass off a counterfeit $20 bill at a Cup Foods location.

88
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:51,040
According to an interview with the owner of that Cup Foods location on The Cut, the owner

89
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:55,460
knew Floyd, calling him a big teddy bear who would come to the location a few times a week

90
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:58,760
to pay his cell phone bill, and said that they always got along.

91
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:01,040
However, the owner wasn't there that night.

92
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,260
Other employees were.

93
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:06,400
And according to testimony from those two employees published on the Washington Post,

94
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:10,040
when they realized that George Floyd had used a counterfeit $20 to buy cigarettes, and that

95
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:13,520
he was still sitting in his vehicle across the street, they went to confront him.

96
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:18,760
Not only did Floyd refuse to return the cigarettes, he apparently seemed awfully drunk and not

97
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:20,360
in control of himself.

98
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:24,980
When the police finally arrived, George Floyd struggled with them as they pulled him out

99
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:25,980
of his car.

100
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:29,780
And although he was quite calm while sitting on the street talking to the officers, when

101
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:33,480
they decided to put him in their police car, he again resisted, which is what led to the

102
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:35,640
8 minutes and 46 seconds.

103
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:42,840
So we're talking about a man who has an extensive criminal history, who seems to have tried

104
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:48,640
multiple times to turn his life around, doing legitimate good in the process, but who continued

105
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:54,040
to commit petty theft and various other minor crimes up until his death at the hands of

106
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,440
the police officers.

107
00:05:55,820 --> 00:06:01,220
George Floyd wasn't a saint, despite the deification he's currently receiving by a lot of progressives

108
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:02,220
right now.

109
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:03,980
But I want to make it absolutely clear.

110
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:08,040
It doesn't matter what George Floyd's crimes actually were.

111
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:10,620
He should not have been killed in the street.

112
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:12,900
This guy could have been a serial killer.

113
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:15,020
He could have been a child molester.

114
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:16,340
It doesn't matter.

115
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:21,080
It doesn't matter what his crimes were, whether large or small, because now he will never

116
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,980
be brought to justice for them.

117
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:27,680
Unless a suspect is actively resisting arrest, like if he has a gun and he was pointing at

118
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:32,680
a police officer and the cop had to shoot him or be shot, and then the suspect got killed,

119
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:35,080
it's regrettable, but fine.

120
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:36,480
That's not this case.

121
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:38,320
There were four officers there.

122
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:39,700
They had him arrested.

123
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:41,480
They had him restrained.

124
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:45,600
There were other things they could have done aside from fucking murder him.

125
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:50,720
Regardless of his crimes, what should have happened to George Floyd was that he be detained,

126
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:56,300
read his rights, arrested, brought in, provided legal counsel, and be allowed to live to see

127
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:57,940
his day in court.

128
00:06:57,940 --> 00:07:03,060
And the fact that he is dead at the hands of the police is a miscarriage of justice.

129
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:07,900
George Floyd may not have been innocent, but he certainly didn't deserve to die.

130
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:15,340
Whew, that was a, that was a rough video to make, and actually based on the script that

131
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:18,260
I had written and the amount of evidence that I had up, I actually thought it'd be longer

132
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:19,260
than that.

133
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:24,360
Hope you don't mind me filling out the rest of the video with an announcement.

134
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:27,480
I know that I've been away from the SFO channel for a while.

135
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:32,260
The political videos have been kind of dry for the past two weeks, but I'm now back to

136
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:33,260
doing it.

137
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:36,920
The story as to why I was gone is probably just pretty boring to you guys.

138
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:40,400
If you've heard me talk on Discord or on my gaming stream or whatever, you've probably

139
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:47,880
heard it already, but basically it was a combination of being completely inundated with almost

140
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:49,500
too much information.

141
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:54,100
When you have hundreds of links or thousands of links and they have to be catalogued and

142
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:58,500
then turned into a workable script, you get a lot of projects that end up being started

143
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:00,060
but not finished.

144
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:02,380
And that has been a consistent problem with my workflow.

145
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:09,300
I have three or four videos related to the current riot situation, but every day there's

146
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:14,140
like, there's more sources, there's more news, and the videos become too big.

147
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:19,880
And I basically need to get a handle on actually nailing something down and getting it out

148
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:22,280
and basically putting my own perfectionism aside.

149
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:25,120
And I know that I've talked about this before and so have other creators, but the worst

150
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:28,840
part about it is that when you skip a few days trying to make the video good, there's

151
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:32,440
like pressure on you to make an even better video, which then leads to more time, which

152
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:36,280
then leads to more time before the video comes out, which then leads to it even being later,

153
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:42,180
and it becomes this snowballing nightmare of me being gone for two weeks and organizing

154
00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:45,920
a dozen video topics and not actually doing any of them.

155
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:50,200
So basically my solution to this was to just be like, you know what, fuck it.

156
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:54,160
I'm doing a small video just to talk about something, just to get myself back in front

157
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:59,320
of the mic again, and then that wipes out one topic and basically gets me started again.

158
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:03,720
So this tiny video will hopefully lead to more videos in the coming days.

159
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:06,840
This probably just sounds dumb to you and I would completely understand it if you viewed

160
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:11,120
it that way, because frankly it sounds kind of dumb to me, but basically sometimes things

161
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:15,120
get away from me and I don't want to put out a lackluster product, so I just keep working

162
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,840
at stuff and then it just turns into a giant nightmare.

163
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:22,620
And ironically enough, the solution seems to be doing something that I hate to do, which

164
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:28,220
is put out a short video that is hyper-focused on one thing, in this case it was just George

165
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:32,500
Floyd's record, and allowing that to snowball me in a positive direction instead of a negative

166
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:33,500
one.

167
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:35,380
In any case, I've got an announcement to make.

168
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:37,860
I now have a P.O. box.

169
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:44,340
People have been asking for a while now, hey Dev, where or how can I mail you things?

170
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:50,860
And for a while I actually had my address up on a video, I've now since taken down the

171
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:56,580
video, ever since my local Antifa goons have been trying to find out where I live, I said

172
00:09:56,580 --> 00:10:01,360
you know what, maybe I should take down that video that has my address in it, but basically

173
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,700
I now have a P.O. box.

174
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:07,140
If you want to mail me stuff, you can do so at the address on the screen.

175
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:09,940
I'll check it probably once a week or once every two weeks or something, I don't expect

176
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:13,240
to be flooded with mail or anything, but if you want to mail me something and you want

177
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:16,540
me to unbox it on the Weekly Sip, I can do that.

178
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:19,900
If you want me to just have something that you for some reason really just want me to

179
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:20,900
have, that's fine.

180
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:24,840
If you want to send me games to play on Game Boomers, sure, if it's like a physical game

181
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:29,540
I'll put it at the start of the pile for us to play new games with.

182
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:33,400
Maybe books that I can read or do reviews of, I'm down with that too.

183
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:38,540
Please don't mail me poison or glitter bombs or other bad things, okay?

184
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:41,220
I'd rather not die.

185
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:47,700
I mean, maybe that's an unreasonable request, but basically don't mail me stuff that'll

186
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:52,640
be a big mess or that'll actually be damaging to me or somebody, or that'll get me like,

187
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:55,460
I don't know, put on a watch list, I'm not sure.

188
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:58,500
But basically don't do that, okay, if you don't mind.

189
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:02,800
So thanks very much for continuing to support me and sticking with me, and I'll see you

190
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:06,320
guys in the next video, which will hopefully be tomorrow.

191
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,540
And hopefully it'll be a lot longer than this one.

192
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:10,640
Alright, I'm outta here.

193
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:11,140
I love you.
