00:00.000 --> 00:01.880
Hey guys, Dev here.

00:01.880 --> 00:04.640
Stick around to the end of the video because I have some announcements to make, if you

00:04.640 --> 00:05.640
don't mind.

00:05.640 --> 00:10.120
I'm sure at this point, everyone knows who George Floyd is.

00:10.120 --> 00:12.000
Very quickly, in case you don't.

00:12.000 --> 00:19.560
On May 25th, 2020, George Floyd was killed by Derek Chauvin, a Minneapolis police officer.

00:19.560 --> 00:25.560
During Floyd's arrest, Chauvin put his knee on Floyd's neck for 8 minutes and 46 seconds.

00:25.560 --> 00:27.840
A video of the killing went viral.

00:27.840 --> 00:32.380
And in it, if you have the stomach to do so, you can actually watch George Floyd die.

00:32.380 --> 00:36.840
The Minneapolis Police Department's first move was to cover it up, as most American

00:36.840 --> 00:38.120
PDs do, generally.

00:38.120 --> 00:41.060
Here's a statement regarding the official autopsy.

00:41.060 --> 00:46.160
The autopsy revealed no physical findings that support a diagnosis of traumatic asphyxia

00:46.160 --> 00:47.640
or strangulation.

00:47.640 --> 00:52.600
Mr. Floyd had underlying health conditions, including coronary artery disease and hypertensive

00:52.600 --> 00:53.600
heart disease.

00:53.780 --> 00:58.960
The combined effects of Mr. Floyd being restrained by the police, his underlying health conditions,

00:58.960 --> 01:03.820
and any potential intoxicants in his system likely contributed to his death.

01:03.820 --> 01:08.520
This was the Police Department's attempt to basically wave away the blame, and it was

01:08.520 --> 01:09.840
quickly dropped.

01:09.840 --> 01:12.740
Especially when a second coroner's opinion came out.

01:12.740 --> 01:13.860
Cause of death.

01:13.860 --> 01:19.760
Cardiopulmonary arrest complicating law enforcement subdual, restraint and neck compression.

01:19.760 --> 01:20.760
Manner of death.

01:20.760 --> 01:21.760
Homicide.

01:21.760 --> 01:23.280
How injury occurred.

01:23.280 --> 01:28.160
Decedent experienced a cardiopulmonary arrest while being restrained by law enforcement

01:28.160 --> 01:29.420
officers.

01:29.420 --> 01:31.020
Other significant conditions.

01:31.020 --> 01:34.280
Ardeosclerotic and hypertensive heart disease.

01:34.280 --> 01:36.080
Fentanyl intoxication.

01:36.080 --> 01:38.240
Recent methamphetamine use.

01:38.240 --> 01:42.660
I recall a few weeks ago, the common consensus was that the American people were being gaslit

01:42.660 --> 01:46.440
by the Minneapolis Police Department, as well as those media outlets that were publishing

01:46.440 --> 01:53.280
their propaganda, which said stuff like, any potential toxicants in his system likely

01:53.280 --> 01:58.940
contributed to his death, but it turns out, no, he had actually recently used meth.

01:58.940 --> 02:01.260
And man, it always ends up being this way, doesn't it?

02:01.260 --> 02:05.460
How many times have we seen now, where a police officer kills somebody, usually, but not always

02:05.460 --> 02:06.460
a black person.

02:06.460 --> 02:10.600
The community is outraged, there's peaceful protests, there's riots, but then as the

02:10.600 --> 02:15.040
wheels of justice continue to move, they discover that the victim was not just an innocent boy

02:15.040 --> 02:19.000
going to college, but he may have actually done something wrong.

02:19.000 --> 02:21.120
So let's examine the possibility.

02:21.120 --> 02:23.880
Does George Floyd fall into that category?

02:23.880 --> 02:27.920
According to court records in Houston, which is where George Floyd used to live, he was

02:27.920 --> 02:29.820
arrested seven times.

02:29.820 --> 02:31.460
Drug possession in 1997.

02:31.460 --> 02:33.660
Two counts of theft in 1998.

02:33.660 --> 02:38.080
Failure to identify, which you have to do as a fugitive, obviously, in 2001.

02:38.080 --> 02:40.000
Drug possession, 2002.

02:40.000 --> 02:41.540
Trespassing, 2003.

02:41.540 --> 02:43.540
Drug possession, 2004.

02:43.540 --> 02:45.260
Weapon, 2005.

02:45.260 --> 02:48.300
Aggravated robbery with a deadly weapon, 2007.

02:48.300 --> 02:50.660
That last charge is the most interesting.

02:50.660 --> 02:51.660
Here's the story.

02:51.660 --> 02:57.840
George Floyd and five other people arrived at the house of Araceli Henriquez and Angel

02:57.840 --> 03:00.540
Negrete, as well as their young toddler.

03:00.540 --> 03:04.980
One of them, it's not clear if it was George Floyd or somebody else, was dressed in a blue

03:04.980 --> 03:07.720
uniform and said they were with the water department.

03:07.720 --> 03:11.400
When Henriquez opened the door, the man forced himself into the house.

03:11.400 --> 03:15.960
At the same time, five other men arrived in a black Ford Explorer.

03:15.960 --> 03:21.440
The largest of the six, presumably George Floyd because George Floyd is 6'7", placed

03:21.440 --> 03:26.160
a pistol against Henriquez's abdomen and forced her into the living room area of the

03:26.160 --> 03:27.160
residence.

03:27.160 --> 03:32.240
This large suspect proceeded to search the residence while another armed suspect guarded

03:32.240 --> 03:36.240
Henriquez, who was struck in the head after she tried to scream for help.

03:36.240 --> 03:40.800
As the six suspects looked through the residence, they demanded to know where drugs and money

03:40.800 --> 03:44.160
were, and Henriquez told them there were no such things in the residence.

03:44.160 --> 03:48.040
The suspects then took some jewelry along with a cell phone before they fled the scene

03:48.040 --> 03:50.020
in their black Ford Explorer.

03:50.020 --> 03:55.140
Three months later, the black Ford Explorer was found, and George Floyd was the driver.

03:55.140 --> 03:57.540
George Floyd pled guilty in 2009.

03:57.540 --> 04:02.240
He was sentenced to five years in prison, and he got out on parole in 2013.

04:02.240 --> 04:05.900
After getting out of jail, George Floyd turned his life around, at least for a little bit.

04:05.900 --> 04:08.400
Multiple articles have been written about the subject.

04:08.400 --> 04:11.520
After jail, he moved to Minneapolis, hoping to start a new life.

04:11.520 --> 04:16.280
He left at least one child behind in order to do so, but fine, he moves on with his life.

04:16.280 --> 04:17.280
He gets married.

04:17.280 --> 04:18.440
He has more kids.

04:18.440 --> 04:20.920
He becomes a mentor of other young people in his community.

04:20.920 --> 04:22.160
He works with his church.

04:22.160 --> 04:25.920
He helped his mother exercise and recuperate after she had a stroke.

04:25.920 --> 04:28.880
He worked as a truck driver, a bouncer, and a security guard.

04:28.880 --> 04:33.240
A few months before his death, he lost his job as the bouncer of a bar because of the

04:33.240 --> 04:38.280
whole coronavirus thing, and he in fact contracted coronavirus himself and later recovered.

04:38.280 --> 04:46.320
George Floyd's crime was trying to pass off a counterfeit $20 bill at a Cup Foods location.

04:46.320 --> 04:51.040
According to an interview with the owner of that Cup Foods location on The Cut, the owner

04:51.040 --> 04:55.460
knew Floyd, calling him a big teddy bear who would come to the location a few times a week

04:55.460 --> 04:58.760
to pay his cell phone bill, and said that they always got along.

04:58.760 --> 05:01.040
However, the owner wasn't there that night.

05:01.040 --> 05:02.260
Other employees were.

05:02.260 --> 05:06.400
And according to testimony from those two employees published on the Washington Post,

05:06.400 --> 05:10.040
when they realized that George Floyd had used a counterfeit $20 to buy cigarettes, and that

05:10.040 --> 05:13.520
he was still sitting in his vehicle across the street, they went to confront him.

05:13.520 --> 05:18.760
Not only did Floyd refuse to return the cigarettes, he apparently seemed awfully drunk and not

05:18.760 --> 05:20.360
in control of himself.

05:20.360 --> 05:24.980
When the police finally arrived, George Floyd struggled with them as they pulled him out

05:24.980 --> 05:25.980
of his car.

05:25.980 --> 05:29.780
And although he was quite calm while sitting on the street talking to the officers, when

05:29.780 --> 05:33.480
they decided to put him in their police car, he again resisted, which is what led to the

05:33.480 --> 05:35.640
8 minutes and 46 seconds.

05:35.640 --> 05:42.840
So we're talking about a man who has an extensive criminal history, who seems to have tried

05:42.840 --> 05:48.640
multiple times to turn his life around, doing legitimate good in the process, but who continued

05:48.640 --> 05:54.040
to commit petty theft and various other minor crimes up until his death at the hands of

05:54.040 --> 05:55.440
the police officers.

05:55.820 --> 06:01.220
George Floyd wasn't a saint, despite the deification he's currently receiving by a lot of progressives

06:01.220 --> 06:02.220
right now.

06:02.220 --> 06:03.980
But I want to make it absolutely clear.

06:03.980 --> 06:08.040
It doesn't matter what George Floyd's crimes actually were.

06:08.040 --> 06:10.620
He should not have been killed in the street.

06:10.620 --> 06:12.900
This guy could have been a serial killer.

06:12.900 --> 06:15.020
He could have been a child molester.

06:15.020 --> 06:16.340
It doesn't matter.

06:16.340 --> 06:21.080
It doesn't matter what his crimes were, whether large or small, because now he will never

06:21.080 --> 06:22.980
be brought to justice for them.

06:23.120 --> 06:27.680
Unless a suspect is actively resisting arrest, like if he has a gun and he was pointing at

06:27.680 --> 06:32.680
a police officer and the cop had to shoot him or be shot, and then the suspect got killed,

06:32.680 --> 06:35.080
it's regrettable, but fine.

06:35.080 --> 06:36.480
That's not this case.

06:36.480 --> 06:38.320
There were four officers there.

06:38.320 --> 06:39.700
They had him arrested.

06:39.700 --> 06:41.480
They had him restrained.

06:41.480 --> 06:45.600
There were other things they could have done aside from fucking murder him.

06:45.600 --> 06:50.720
Regardless of his crimes, what should have happened to George Floyd was that he be detained,

06:50.780 --> 06:56.300
read his rights, arrested, brought in, provided legal counsel, and be allowed to live to see

06:56.300 --> 06:57.940
his day in court.

06:57.940 --> 07:03.060
And the fact that he is dead at the hands of the police is a miscarriage of justice.

07:03.060 --> 07:07.900
George Floyd may not have been innocent, but he certainly didn't deserve to die.

07:10.300 --> 07:15.340
Whew, that was a, that was a rough video to make, and actually based on the script that

07:15.340 --> 07:18.260
I had written and the amount of evidence that I had up, I actually thought it'd be longer

07:18.260 --> 07:19.260
than that.

07:19.640 --> 07:24.360
Hope you don't mind me filling out the rest of the video with an announcement.

07:24.360 --> 07:27.480
I know that I've been away from the SFO channel for a while.

07:27.480 --> 07:32.260
The political videos have been kind of dry for the past two weeks, but I'm now back to

07:32.260 --> 07:33.260
doing it.

07:33.260 --> 07:36.920
The story as to why I was gone is probably just pretty boring to you guys.

07:36.920 --> 07:40.400
If you've heard me talk on Discord or on my gaming stream or whatever, you've probably

07:40.400 --> 07:47.880
heard it already, but basically it was a combination of being completely inundated with almost

07:47.940 --> 07:49.500
too much information.

07:49.500 --> 07:54.100
When you have hundreds of links or thousands of links and they have to be catalogued and

07:54.100 --> 07:58.500
then turned into a workable script, you get a lot of projects that end up being started

07:58.500 --> 08:00.060
but not finished.

08:00.060 --> 08:02.380
And that has been a consistent problem with my workflow.

08:02.380 --> 08:09.300
I have three or four videos related to the current riot situation, but every day there's

08:09.300 --> 08:14.140
like, there's more sources, there's more news, and the videos become too big.

08:14.140 --> 08:19.880
And I basically need to get a handle on actually nailing something down and getting it out

08:19.880 --> 08:22.280
and basically putting my own perfectionism aside.

08:22.280 --> 08:25.120
And I know that I've talked about this before and so have other creators, but the worst

08:25.120 --> 08:28.840
part about it is that when you skip a few days trying to make the video good, there's

08:28.840 --> 08:32.440
like pressure on you to make an even better video, which then leads to more time, which

08:32.440 --> 08:36.280
then leads to more time before the video comes out, which then leads to it even being later,

08:36.280 --> 08:42.180
and it becomes this snowballing nightmare of me being gone for two weeks and organizing

08:42.180 --> 08:45.920
a dozen video topics and not actually doing any of them.

08:45.920 --> 08:50.200
So basically my solution to this was to just be like, you know what, fuck it.

08:50.200 --> 08:54.160
I'm doing a small video just to talk about something, just to get myself back in front

08:54.160 --> 08:59.320
of the mic again, and then that wipes out one topic and basically gets me started again.

08:59.320 --> 09:03.720
So this tiny video will hopefully lead to more videos in the coming days.

09:03.720 --> 09:06.840
This probably just sounds dumb to you and I would completely understand it if you viewed

09:06.840 --> 09:11.120
it that way, because frankly it sounds kind of dumb to me, but basically sometimes things

09:11.120 --> 09:15.120
get away from me and I don't want to put out a lackluster product, so I just keep working

09:15.120 --> 09:17.840
at stuff and then it just turns into a giant nightmare.

09:17.840 --> 09:22.620
And ironically enough, the solution seems to be doing something that I hate to do, which

09:22.620 --> 09:28.220
is put out a short video that is hyper-focused on one thing, in this case it was just George

09:28.220 --> 09:32.500
Floyd's record, and allowing that to snowball me in a positive direction instead of a negative

09:32.500 --> 09:33.500
one.

09:33.500 --> 09:35.380
In any case, I've got an announcement to make.

09:35.380 --> 09:37.860
I now have a P.O. box.

09:37.860 --> 09:44.340
People have been asking for a while now, hey Dev, where or how can I mail you things?

09:44.340 --> 09:50.860
And for a while I actually had my address up on a video, I've now since taken down the

09:50.860 --> 09:56.580
video, ever since my local Antifa goons have been trying to find out where I live, I said

09:56.580 --> 10:01.360
you know what, maybe I should take down that video that has my address in it, but basically

10:01.360 --> 10:02.700
I now have a P.O. box.

10:02.700 --> 10:07.140
If you want to mail me stuff, you can do so at the address on the screen.

10:07.140 --> 10:09.940
I'll check it probably once a week or once every two weeks or something, I don't expect

10:09.940 --> 10:13.240
to be flooded with mail or anything, but if you want to mail me something and you want

10:13.240 --> 10:16.540
me to unbox it on the Weekly Sip, I can do that.

10:16.540 --> 10:19.900
If you want me to just have something that you for some reason really just want me to

10:19.900 --> 10:20.900
have, that's fine.

10:20.900 --> 10:24.840
If you want to send me games to play on Game Boomers, sure, if it's like a physical game

10:24.840 --> 10:29.540
I'll put it at the start of the pile for us to play new games with.

10:29.540 --> 10:33.400
Maybe books that I can read or do reviews of, I'm down with that too.

10:33.400 --> 10:38.540
Please don't mail me poison or glitter bombs or other bad things, okay?

10:38.540 --> 10:41.220
I'd rather not die.

10:41.220 --> 10:47.700
I mean, maybe that's an unreasonable request, but basically don't mail me stuff that'll

10:47.700 --> 10:52.640
be a big mess or that'll actually be damaging to me or somebody, or that'll get me like,

10:52.640 --> 10:55.460
I don't know, put on a watch list, I'm not sure.

10:55.460 --> 10:58.500
But basically don't do that, okay, if you don't mind.

10:58.500 --> 11:02.800
So thanks very much for continuing to support me and sticking with me, and I'll see you

11:02.800 --> 11:06.320
guys in the next video, which will hopefully be tomorrow.

11:06.320 --> 11:08.540
And hopefully it'll be a lot longer than this one.

11:08.540 --> 11:10.640
Alright, I'm outta here.

11:10.640 --> 11:11.140
I love you.
