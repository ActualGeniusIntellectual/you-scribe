Hey, y'all heard the ballad of bodega bro? Check it out.

00:08.640 --> 00:12.320
Okay, so I just moved to New York and I'm trying to go grocery shopping and so I type

00:12.320 --> 00:17.960
in like grocery stores on my Apple maps and like every fucking one I go to like I'm walking

00:17.960 --> 00:23.520
to like they're like this shit or like fucking like this like bro that's not a grocery store

00:23.520 --> 00:28.720
like I'm trying to get like eggs yogurt like cheese like shit like that right like look

00:28.720 --> 00:44.940
at this place let me get a bacon egg and cheese the Aki way like you know those Tik

00:44.940 --> 00:51.780
Toks like I'm fucking doing it like I've literally been to like five of those now like I don't

00:51.780 --> 00:56.040
know what the fuck I'm about to do for dinner like where are the Kroger's and like the whole

00:56.040 --> 01:01.600
foods at like I'm about to eat fucking like like cereal and ramen for dinner like what

01:01.600 --> 01:06.420
the fuck this guy's real name is Griffin Green he's a former college football player from

01:06.420 --> 01:11.840
Denison University in Ohio after graduating he got hired on to a tech startup called outreach

01:11.840 --> 01:15.840
that had just expanded into New York City the job required him to move so this was his

01:15.840 --> 01:19.560
first time in one of the biggest cities in the world and once he realized that New York

01:19.560 --> 01:24.760
is basically a food desert he made that viral Tik Tok by the way a food desert is a neighborhood

01:24.760 --> 01:29.320
in a city with no easy access to a nearby grocery store people living in that neighborhood

01:29.320 --> 01:33.800
have to either order out go to restaurants or buy whatever they can at convenience stores

01:33.800 --> 01:38.680
a bodega where the name bodega bro comes from is a specific type of convenience store unique

01:38.680 --> 01:43.680
to New York City generally having a loud atmosphere and run by immigrants the word bodega is Spanish

01:43.680 --> 01:48.100
for storage room bodegas are where a lot of people in New York get food because of that

01:48.100 --> 01:52.840
food desert problem what really helped us all blow up though was this bug man's reply

01:52.840 --> 01:57.200
to bodega bro there's so much to say he probably doesn't want to hear what I have to say and

01:57.200 --> 02:00.000
that's fine this video isn't for him this video is for all the people who always say

02:00.000 --> 02:03.760
Dutch why do you get mad about people moving to New York and it's because they often have

02:03.760 --> 02:07.640
attitudes like that they come to the city in this case the Bronx and instead of integrating

02:07.640 --> 02:11.360
themselves into their community they just make a mockery of it I mean what he's been

02:11.360 --> 02:14.720
here like two days and he's found a way to make fun of the stores that many people in

02:14.720 --> 02:18.560
the community relying on stores that people have to rely on because the supermarket he's

02:18.560 --> 02:22.760
so desperately looking for doesn't exist because he's moved to a city which is historically

02:22.760 --> 02:26.840
and still today systematically deprived certain neighborhoods neighborhoods that are predominantly

02:26.840 --> 02:31.120
black and brown into a working class of basic resources I know you're gonna say it's not

02:31.120 --> 02:35.880
that serious but it is how would you feel if somebody came in your house uninvited and

02:35.880 --> 02:39.560
started making fun of all your furniture well I am not at all mad about somebody moving

02:39.560 --> 02:43.660
to New York I'm mad about people moving to New York and having attitudes like that there's

02:43.660 --> 02:48.720
comedy and then there's mockery and there's a very clear difference between the two boy

02:48.720 --> 02:52.960
oh are you complaining that people are moving into your home and not adopting the local

02:52.960 --> 02:56.880
culture instead they're holding on to their own views and complaining that those views

02:56.880 --> 03:01.920
aren't being catered to if you were talking about a non-white person you would be immediately

03:01.920 --> 03:06.480
called racist and xenophobic moreover a lot of poorer communities can't actually have

03:06.480 --> 03:10.280
certain types of larger stores because of the crime in those communities remember during

03:10.280 --> 03:14.680
the 2020 riots where people fucked up some neighborhoods so badly some stores just closed

03:14.680 --> 03:19.360
and never returned it's not like these companies have infinite resources to keep dumping products

03:19.360 --> 03:23.080
into communities only to have them all get stolen and then bring in no return a community with

03:23.080 --> 03:27.880
rampant shoplifting is gonna see stores leave and not come back this is not some scheme by rich

03:27.880 --> 03:31.960
people keeping your community down this is due to the behaviors of your own people anyway in

03:31.960 --> 03:36.600
reply to both this and after seeing the general dilapidated state of New York City bodega bro

03:36.600 --> 03:41.400
posted another video home then you're not welcome here and I think it's hilarious so I'm gonna

03:41.400 --> 03:46.840
address a few things number one I got a job at a top 10 startup in the country in Manhattan so

03:46.840 --> 03:52.840
I'm not fucking going anywhere number two my first day of work was today June 27th but my

03:52.840 --> 03:57.880
lease on the Upper East Side this is until July 15th so I'm subletting in this shithole for three

03:57.880 --> 04:02.760
weeks and yes it's a shithole you can't even argue with me on that there's like trash everywhere on

04:02.760 --> 04:07.400
the sidewalks and streets there's like people sleeping on the sidewalk number three I just

04:07.400 --> 04:11.320
thought it was funny that I typed in grocery store and a bunch of like corner stores showed

04:11.320 --> 04:16.040
up I thought it was funny okay so fucking chill on me like it's a joke I think people are just

04:16.040 --> 04:19.720
triggered by the use of the word shithole here since that was a Trump meme back during his

04:19.720 --> 04:24.360
presidency the president tonight apparently uncorking another astonishing statement

04:24.360 --> 04:29.080
complaining to lawmakers in the oval office about protections for immigrants why do we want these

04:29.080 --> 04:33.960
people from quote all these shithole countries here according to a democratic aide familiar

04:33.960 --> 04:39.160
with the conversation mr trump was referring to African nations and Haiti but people were triggered

04:39.160 --> 04:44.120
so much they actually got him fired look at this absolute asshole I don't think it's very flattering

04:44.120 --> 04:50.360
to have this type of person representing your company I would revile revalue I would revalue

04:50.360 --> 04:55.800
his employment if I were you and yeah outreach fired him why for calling New York City a shithole

04:55.800 --> 05:00.280
when it fucking is one they brought up the die shit the diversity inclusion equity but where was

05:00.280 --> 05:05.800
he being racist he only said that the city was shit and that's because it is I did that video

05:05.800 --> 05:10.200
a few months ago about why you should leave LA and it's not New York City but the same principle

05:10.200 --> 05:14.440
applies here the progs have ruled over these cities for decades and have cultivated a culture

05:14.440 --> 05:18.840
with no standards because the idea of holding somebody accountable for anything that they do

05:18.840 --> 05:23.320
is considered oppressive by these softies when there's no standards why wouldn't your city be

05:23.320 --> 05:28.040
covered in trash and heroin needles and junkies in the street it's obvious that bodega bro isn't

05:28.040 --> 05:32.520
racist he's just a fish out of water his actual crime is that he questioned the leviathan he

05:32.520 --> 05:37.640
noticed that the emperor has no clothes he looked at the state of apparently one of the best most

05:37.640 --> 05:42.440
prosperous most progressive places to live on earth and asked the obvious question why is it

05:42.440 --> 05:48.600
so shitty like watch this video of his bro like this place is so crazy like so many gay people

05:48.600 --> 05:53.640
down here it's like I don't hate it like I'm not gay but like I'm all for it do what you want but

05:53.640 --> 06:03.720
like like look at it I tried to do that trend on those people where it's like he's a 10 but

06:03.720 --> 06:07.480
whatever and like they had no idea what I was talking about but they're in the talk so it's

06:07.480 --> 06:17.880
hilarious like is being gay just like the new thing like I didn't know this many gay people

06:17.880 --> 06:23.560
existed it's wild does this sound like a bigoted person to you I mean he sounds uneducated sure

06:23.640 --> 06:28.040
he doesn't know what's going on this is all new to him but is that a crime is never having met a

06:28.040 --> 06:33.160
gay person before now the same thing as an actual hatred of gay people most people who are freaking

06:33.160 --> 06:37.880
out on social media right now over this dude are themselves either small town imports to the

06:37.880 --> 06:42.680
nearest big city or they're still stuck in that small town and live vicariously online because

06:42.680 --> 06:47.240
they hate their lives literally the progressive goal the dream is to take people from these

06:47.240 --> 06:51.960
conservative towns entice them through economic factors to move into the city and then once

06:51.960 --> 06:55.480
they're there convert them politically and culturally and now you're gonna shun this

06:55.480 --> 07:00.040
dude or even have your hooks in him these people are exceptionally stupid bodega bro

07:00.040 --> 07:05.560
ended up going on this whole apology tour thing okay so if you came here from twitter you may

07:05.560 --> 07:11.080
know me as bodega bro I made a video that got taken way out of context so I went off private

07:11.080 --> 07:16.040
to show you guys what bodega bro is really all about also if you know anybody that's hiring tech

07:16.040 --> 07:20.840
sales or needs a workout partner in new york let me know doing a video giving food to the homeless

07:20.840 --> 07:25.560
then all right I get it he's trying to soften the impact of a legit online hate mob coming after him

07:25.560 --> 07:29.560
it's cringy but whatever and hey he's still doing good so fuck it I hope things work out for him

07:29.560 --> 07:33.480
new york's expensive he needs a new job and he didn't deserve to get fired but I'm reminded

07:33.480 --> 07:38.120
of that really god-awful woke game tell me why that we played on the gaming channel recently

07:38.120 --> 07:41.960
the playable characters are these two twin girls except one of them grows up to be a trans man

07:41.960 --> 07:47.320
there's this old backwater redneck type character who is friendly but very old school and extremely

07:47.320 --> 07:51.320
uneducated on progressive topics at the beginning of the game you can tell that he means well but

07:51.320 --> 07:59.000
he makes a few remarks about gender that the trans man is insulted by your brother oh shit

07:59.800 --> 08:03.720
huh I guess I heard about that but I never

08:06.680 --> 08:15.960
damn you look like a real man so do you sam you know what I mean I just didn't know they could

08:15.960 --> 08:22.600
make a woman looks almost like a man I've seen a couple of lady transvestites on the TV before but

08:24.760 --> 08:26.040
I've never seen a dude

08:28.760 --> 08:38.680
sam that's not how you say that say what transvestites yes it's transgender transgender men

08:39.560 --> 08:45.800
uh I'm sorry it's hard to keep track out here in Delos Crossing

08:47.160 --> 08:52.760
world's just moving on without us during act two he comes back and the first thing he does is

08:52.760 --> 08:56.520
apologize saying that he looked it up on the internet he doesn't quite understand all these

08:56.520 --> 09:01.880
new ideas but he never meant to be mean anyway I also came by to say I fired up the google and I

09:02.760 --> 09:09.240
I did some reading I didn't know the germs between all those words I mean I you know never

09:09.240 --> 09:17.080
been much of a reader but I think I get why what I said was wrong and I'm real sorry

09:20.600 --> 09:26.680
oh and before I forget or the lady of the house and from that point on he treats the trans man

09:26.680 --> 09:32.120
character like any other guy that is exactly how it should be from both the liberal and progressive

09:32.120 --> 09:36.840
point of view and yet the game is written like we should be viewing him as a bad person it's like

09:36.840 --> 09:41.560
no he's actually the most likable guy in the game everybody else is insufferably woke meanwhile his

09:41.560 --> 09:46.760
attitude is just like yeah I don't understand but hey you do you and that's how it should be have

09:46.760 --> 09:51.000
you seen this clip of Natasha Devon no uh no relation talking about her bisexuality let's

09:51.000 --> 09:57.720
listen in my sexuality is still part of my identity and I think probably the most hurtful

09:57.720 --> 10:03.240
response that I get when I speak about this publicly and I get this both online and in real

10:03.240 --> 10:12.200
life is when people say I don't care why are you telling me about this what you do in the bedroom

10:12.200 --> 10:18.200
is none of my business and what those people are failing to understand is that this isn't just

10:18.200 --> 10:23.080
about sex this is about life I think this attitude is at the heart of the matter the

10:23.080 --> 10:28.200
liberal principle here is live and let live it doesn't matter what you do you do you even if

10:28.200 --> 10:32.360
it's something new even if there's something about it that's new to me that's a little bit strange and

10:32.360 --> 10:36.520
I might need to acclimate to if you're not bothering anybody else then fine but these

10:36.520 --> 10:41.800
people don't want that liberal neutrality they want explicit validation neutrality to a progressive

10:41.800 --> 10:45.960
is just as bad as rejection because remember you can't stand still on a moving train everything

10:45.960 --> 10:50.440
needs to move leftward over time you've heard all this before bodega bro went through in a strange

10:50.440 --> 10:54.600
tongue-in-cheek kind of way a hero's journey he went to a new place he got exposed to new things

10:54.600 --> 10:59.480
he reveled in the novelty but ultimately accepted the non-damaging parts of it and grew a little bit

10:59.480 --> 11:03.880
as a result remember what he said about gay people but that neutrality is an affront to the

11:03.880 --> 11:08.680
progressive and the criticism even more so he was not a perfect leftist right out the womb and so

11:08.680 --> 11:13.400
for that he needs to be eternally repentant the fact that he is not the fact that he gave clap

11:13.400 --> 11:16.520
back meant that the prog canceling of him was inevitable
