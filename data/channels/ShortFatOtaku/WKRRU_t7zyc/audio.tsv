0	8640	Hey, y'all heard the ballad of bodega bro? Check it out.
8640	12320	Okay, so I just moved to New York and I'm trying to go grocery shopping and so I type
12320	17960	in like grocery stores on my Apple maps and like every fucking one I go to like I'm walking
17960	23520	to like they're like this shit or like fucking like this like bro that's not a grocery store
23520	28720	like I'm trying to get like eggs yogurt like cheese like shit like that right like look
28720	44940	at this place let me get a bacon egg and cheese the Aki way like you know those Tik
44940	51780	Toks like I'm fucking doing it like I've literally been to like five of those now like I don't
51780	56040	know what the fuck I'm about to do for dinner like where are the Kroger's and like the whole
56040	61600	foods at like I'm about to eat fucking like like cereal and ramen for dinner like what
61600	66420	the fuck this guy's real name is Griffin Green he's a former college football player from
66420	71840	Denison University in Ohio after graduating he got hired on to a tech startup called outreach
71840	75840	that had just expanded into New York City the job required him to move so this was his
75840	79560	first time in one of the biggest cities in the world and once he realized that New York
79560	84760	is basically a food desert he made that viral Tik Tok by the way a food desert is a neighborhood
84760	89320	in a city with no easy access to a nearby grocery store people living in that neighborhood
89320	93800	have to either order out go to restaurants or buy whatever they can at convenience stores
93800	98680	a bodega where the name bodega bro comes from is a specific type of convenience store unique
98680	103680	to New York City generally having a loud atmosphere and run by immigrants the word bodega is Spanish
103680	108100	for storage room bodegas are where a lot of people in New York get food because of that
108100	112840	food desert problem what really helped us all blow up though was this bug man's reply
112840	117200	to bodega bro there's so much to say he probably doesn't want to hear what I have to say and
117200	120000	that's fine this video isn't for him this video is for all the people who always say
120000	123760	Dutch why do you get mad about people moving to New York and it's because they often have
123760	127640	attitudes like that they come to the city in this case the Bronx and instead of integrating
127640	131360	themselves into their community they just make a mockery of it I mean what he's been
131360	134720	here like two days and he's found a way to make fun of the stores that many people in
134720	138560	the community relying on stores that people have to rely on because the supermarket he's
138560	142760	so desperately looking for doesn't exist because he's moved to a city which is historically
142760	146840	and still today systematically deprived certain neighborhoods neighborhoods that are predominantly
146840	151120	black and brown into a working class of basic resources I know you're gonna say it's not
151120	155880	that serious but it is how would you feel if somebody came in your house uninvited and
155880	159560	started making fun of all your furniture well I am not at all mad about somebody moving
159560	163660	to New York I'm mad about people moving to New York and having attitudes like that there's
163660	168720	comedy and then there's mockery and there's a very clear difference between the two boy
168720	172960	oh are you complaining that people are moving into your home and not adopting the local
172960	176880	culture instead they're holding on to their own views and complaining that those views
176880	181920	aren't being catered to if you were talking about a non-white person you would be immediately
181920	186480	called racist and xenophobic moreover a lot of poorer communities can't actually have
186480	190280	certain types of larger stores because of the crime in those communities remember during
190280	194680	the 2020 riots where people fucked up some neighborhoods so badly some stores just closed
194680	199360	and never returned it's not like these companies have infinite resources to keep dumping products
199360	203080	into communities only to have them all get stolen and then bring in no return a community with
203080	207880	rampant shoplifting is gonna see stores leave and not come back this is not some scheme by rich
207880	211960	people keeping your community down this is due to the behaviors of your own people anyway in
211960	216600	reply to both this and after seeing the general dilapidated state of New York City bodega bro
216600	221400	posted another video home then you're not welcome here and I think it's hilarious so I'm gonna
221400	226840	address a few things number one I got a job at a top 10 startup in the country in Manhattan so
226840	232840	I'm not fucking going anywhere number two my first day of work was today June 27th but my
232840	237880	lease on the Upper East Side this is until July 15th so I'm subletting in this shithole for three
237880	242760	weeks and yes it's a shithole you can't even argue with me on that there's like trash everywhere on
242760	247400	the sidewalks and streets there's like people sleeping on the sidewalk number three I just
247400	251320	thought it was funny that I typed in grocery store and a bunch of like corner stores showed
251320	256040	up I thought it was funny okay so fucking chill on me like it's a joke I think people are just
256040	259720	triggered by the use of the word shithole here since that was a Trump meme back during his
259720	264360	presidency the president tonight apparently uncorking another astonishing statement
264360	269080	complaining to lawmakers in the oval office about protections for immigrants why do we want these
269080	273960	people from quote all these shithole countries here according to a democratic aide familiar
273960	279160	with the conversation mr trump was referring to African nations and Haiti but people were triggered
279160	284120	so much they actually got him fired look at this absolute asshole I don't think it's very flattering
284120	290360	to have this type of person representing your company I would revile revalue I would revalue
290360	295800	his employment if I were you and yeah outreach fired him why for calling New York City a shithole
295800	300280	when it fucking is one they brought up the die shit the diversity inclusion equity but where was
300280	305800	he being racist he only said that the city was shit and that's because it is I did that video
305800	310200	a few months ago about why you should leave LA and it's not New York City but the same principle
310200	314440	applies here the progs have ruled over these cities for decades and have cultivated a culture
314440	318840	with no standards because the idea of holding somebody accountable for anything that they do
318840	323320	is considered oppressive by these softies when there's no standards why wouldn't your city be
323320	328040	covered in trash and heroin needles and junkies in the street it's obvious that bodega bro isn't
328040	332520	racist he's just a fish out of water his actual crime is that he questioned the leviathan he
332520	337640	noticed that the emperor has no clothes he looked at the state of apparently one of the best most
337640	342440	prosperous most progressive places to live on earth and asked the obvious question why is it
342440	348600	so shitty like watch this video of his bro like this place is so crazy like so many gay people
348600	353640	down here it's like I don't hate it like I'm not gay but like I'm all for it do what you want but
353640	363720	like like look at it I tried to do that trend on those people where it's like he's a 10 but
363720	367480	whatever and like they had no idea what I was talking about but they're in the talk so it's
367480	377880	hilarious like is being gay just like the new thing like I didn't know this many gay people
377880	383560	existed it's wild does this sound like a bigoted person to you I mean he sounds uneducated sure
383640	388040	he doesn't know what's going on this is all new to him but is that a crime is never having met a
388040	393160	gay person before now the same thing as an actual hatred of gay people most people who are freaking
393160	397880	out on social media right now over this dude are themselves either small town imports to the
397880	402680	nearest big city or they're still stuck in that small town and live vicariously online because
402680	407240	they hate their lives literally the progressive goal the dream is to take people from these
407240	411960	conservative towns entice them through economic factors to move into the city and then once
411960	415480	they're there convert them politically and culturally and now you're gonna shun this
415480	420040	dude or even have your hooks in him these people are exceptionally stupid bodega bro
420040	425560	ended up going on this whole apology tour thing okay so if you came here from twitter you may
425560	431080	know me as bodega bro I made a video that got taken way out of context so I went off private
431080	436040	to show you guys what bodega bro is really all about also if you know anybody that's hiring tech
436040	440840	sales or needs a workout partner in new york let me know doing a video giving food to the homeless
440840	445560	then all right I get it he's trying to soften the impact of a legit online hate mob coming after him
445560	449560	it's cringy but whatever and hey he's still doing good so fuck it I hope things work out for him
449560	453480	new york's expensive he needs a new job and he didn't deserve to get fired but I'm reminded
453480	458120	of that really god-awful woke game tell me why that we played on the gaming channel recently
458120	461960	the playable characters are these two twin girls except one of them grows up to be a trans man
461960	467320	there's this old backwater redneck type character who is friendly but very old school and extremely
467320	471320	uneducated on progressive topics at the beginning of the game you can tell that he means well but
471320	479000	he makes a few remarks about gender that the trans man is insulted by your brother oh shit
479800	483720	huh I guess I heard about that but I never
486680	495960	damn you look like a real man so do you sam you know what I mean I just didn't know they could
495960	502600	make a woman looks almost like a man I've seen a couple of lady transvestites on the TV before but
504760	506040	I've never seen a dude
508760	518680	sam that's not how you say that say what transvestites yes it's transgender transgender men
519560	525800	uh I'm sorry it's hard to keep track out here in Delos Crossing
527160	532760	world's just moving on without us during act two he comes back and the first thing he does is
532760	536520	apologize saying that he looked it up on the internet he doesn't quite understand all these
536520	541880	new ideas but he never meant to be mean anyway I also came by to say I fired up the google and I
542760	549240	I did some reading I didn't know the germs between all those words I mean I you know never
549240	557080	been much of a reader but I think I get why what I said was wrong and I'm real sorry
560600	566680	oh and before I forget or the lady of the house and from that point on he treats the trans man
566680	572120	character like any other guy that is exactly how it should be from both the liberal and progressive
572120	576840	point of view and yet the game is written like we should be viewing him as a bad person it's like
576840	581560	no he's actually the most likable guy in the game everybody else is insufferably woke meanwhile his
581560	586760	attitude is just like yeah I don't understand but hey you do you and that's how it should be have
586760	591000	you seen this clip of Natasha Devon no uh no relation talking about her bisexuality let's
591000	597720	listen in my sexuality is still part of my identity and I think probably the most hurtful
597720	603240	response that I get when I speak about this publicly and I get this both online and in real
603240	612200	life is when people say I don't care why are you telling me about this what you do in the bedroom
612200	618200	is none of my business and what those people are failing to understand is that this isn't just
618200	623080	about sex this is about life I think this attitude is at the heart of the matter the
623080	628200	liberal principle here is live and let live it doesn't matter what you do you do you even if
628200	632360	it's something new even if there's something about it that's new to me that's a little bit strange and
632360	636520	I might need to acclimate to if you're not bothering anybody else then fine but these
636520	641800	people don't want that liberal neutrality they want explicit validation neutrality to a progressive
641800	645960	is just as bad as rejection because remember you can't stand still on a moving train everything
645960	650440	needs to move leftward over time you've heard all this before bodega bro went through in a strange
650440	654600	tongue-in-cheek kind of way a hero's journey he went to a new place he got exposed to new things
654600	659480	he reveled in the novelty but ultimately accepted the non-damaging parts of it and grew a little bit
659480	663880	as a result remember what he said about gay people but that neutrality is an affront to the
663880	668680	progressive and the criticism even more so he was not a perfect leftist right out the womb and so
668680	673400	for that he needs to be eternally repentant the fact that he is not the fact that he gave clap
673400	676520	back meant that the prog canceling of him was inevitable
