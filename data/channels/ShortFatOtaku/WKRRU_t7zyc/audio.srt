00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,640
Hey, y'all heard the ballad of bodega bro? Check it out.

2
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:12,320
Okay, so I just moved to New York and I'm trying to go grocery shopping and so I type

3
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:17,960
in like grocery stores on my Apple maps and like every fucking one I go to like I'm walking

4
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:23,520
to like they're like this shit or like fucking like this like bro that's not a grocery store

5
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:28,720
like I'm trying to get like eggs yogurt like cheese like shit like that right like look

6
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:44,940
at this place let me get a bacon egg and cheese the Aki way like you know those Tik

7
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:51,780
Toks like I'm fucking doing it like I've literally been to like five of those now like I don't

8
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:56,040
know what the fuck I'm about to do for dinner like where are the Kroger's and like the whole

9
00:00:56,040 --> 00:01:01,600
foods at like I'm about to eat fucking like like cereal and ramen for dinner like what

10
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:06,420
the fuck this guy's real name is Griffin Green he's a former college football player from

11
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:11,840
Denison University in Ohio after graduating he got hired on to a tech startup called outreach

12
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:15,840
that had just expanded into New York City the job required him to move so this was his

13
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:19,560
first time in one of the biggest cities in the world and once he realized that New York

14
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:24,760
is basically a food desert he made that viral Tik Tok by the way a food desert is a neighborhood

15
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:29,320
in a city with no easy access to a nearby grocery store people living in that neighborhood

16
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:33,800
have to either order out go to restaurants or buy whatever they can at convenience stores

17
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:38,680
a bodega where the name bodega bro comes from is a specific type of convenience store unique

18
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:43,680
to New York City generally having a loud atmosphere and run by immigrants the word bodega is Spanish

19
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:48,100
for storage room bodegas are where a lot of people in New York get food because of that

20
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:52,840
food desert problem what really helped us all blow up though was this bug man's reply

21
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:57,200
to bodega bro there's so much to say he probably doesn't want to hear what I have to say and

22
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,000
that's fine this video isn't for him this video is for all the people who always say

23
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,760
Dutch why do you get mad about people moving to New York and it's because they often have

24
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:07,640
attitudes like that they come to the city in this case the Bronx and instead of integrating

25
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:11,360
themselves into their community they just make a mockery of it I mean what he's been

26
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:14,720
here like two days and he's found a way to make fun of the stores that many people in

27
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:18,560
the community relying on stores that people have to rely on because the supermarket he's

28
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:22,760
so desperately looking for doesn't exist because he's moved to a city which is historically

29
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:26,840
and still today systematically deprived certain neighborhoods neighborhoods that are predominantly

30
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:31,120
black and brown into a working class of basic resources I know you're gonna say it's not

31
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:35,880
that serious but it is how would you feel if somebody came in your house uninvited and

32
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:39,560
started making fun of all your furniture well I am not at all mad about somebody moving

33
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:43,660
to New York I'm mad about people moving to New York and having attitudes like that there's

34
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:48,720
comedy and then there's mockery and there's a very clear difference between the two boy

35
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:52,960
oh are you complaining that people are moving into your home and not adopting the local

36
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:56,880
culture instead they're holding on to their own views and complaining that those views

37
00:02:56,880 --> 00:03:01,920
aren't being catered to if you were talking about a non-white person you would be immediately

38
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:06,480
called racist and xenophobic moreover a lot of poorer communities can't actually have

39
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:10,280
certain types of larger stores because of the crime in those communities remember during

40
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:14,680
the 2020 riots where people fucked up some neighborhoods so badly some stores just closed

41
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:19,360
and never returned it's not like these companies have infinite resources to keep dumping products

42
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:23,080
into communities only to have them all get stolen and then bring in no return a community with

43
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:27,880
rampant shoplifting is gonna see stores leave and not come back this is not some scheme by rich

44
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:31,960
people keeping your community down this is due to the behaviors of your own people anyway in

45
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:36,600
reply to both this and after seeing the general dilapidated state of New York City bodega bro

46
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:41,400
posted another video home then you're not welcome here and I think it's hilarious so I'm gonna

47
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:46,840
address a few things number one I got a job at a top 10 startup in the country in Manhattan so

48
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:52,840
I'm not fucking going anywhere number two my first day of work was today June 27th but my

49
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:57,880
lease on the Upper East Side this is until July 15th so I'm subletting in this shithole for three

50
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:02,760
weeks and yes it's a shithole you can't even argue with me on that there's like trash everywhere on

51
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:07,400
the sidewalks and streets there's like people sleeping on the sidewalk number three I just

52
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:11,320
thought it was funny that I typed in grocery store and a bunch of like corner stores showed

53
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:16,040
up I thought it was funny okay so fucking chill on me like it's a joke I think people are just

54
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:19,720
triggered by the use of the word shithole here since that was a Trump meme back during his

55
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:24,360
presidency the president tonight apparently uncorking another astonishing statement

56
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:29,080
complaining to lawmakers in the oval office about protections for immigrants why do we want these

57
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:33,960
people from quote all these shithole countries here according to a democratic aide familiar

58
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:39,160
with the conversation mr trump was referring to African nations and Haiti but people were triggered

59
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:44,120
so much they actually got him fired look at this absolute asshole I don't think it's very flattering

60
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:50,360
to have this type of person representing your company I would revile revalue I would revalue

61
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:55,800
his employment if I were you and yeah outreach fired him why for calling New York City a shithole

62
00:04:55,800 --> 00:05:00,280
when it fucking is one they brought up the die shit the diversity inclusion equity but where was

63
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:05,800
he being racist he only said that the city was shit and that's because it is I did that video

64
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:10,200
a few months ago about why you should leave LA and it's not New York City but the same principle

65
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:14,440
applies here the progs have ruled over these cities for decades and have cultivated a culture

66
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:18,840
with no standards because the idea of holding somebody accountable for anything that they do

67
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:23,320
is considered oppressive by these softies when there's no standards why wouldn't your city be

68
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:28,040
covered in trash and heroin needles and junkies in the street it's obvious that bodega bro isn't

69
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:32,520
racist he's just a fish out of water his actual crime is that he questioned the leviathan he

70
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:37,640
noticed that the emperor has no clothes he looked at the state of apparently one of the best most

71
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:42,440
prosperous most progressive places to live on earth and asked the obvious question why is it

72
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:48,600
so shitty like watch this video of his bro like this place is so crazy like so many gay people

73
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:53,640
down here it's like I don't hate it like I'm not gay but like I'm all for it do what you want but

74
00:05:53,640 --> 00:06:03,720
like like look at it I tried to do that trend on those people where it's like he's a 10 but

75
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:07,480
whatever and like they had no idea what I was talking about but they're in the talk so it's

76
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:17,880
hilarious like is being gay just like the new thing like I didn't know this many gay people

77
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:23,560
existed it's wild does this sound like a bigoted person to you I mean he sounds uneducated sure

78
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:28,040
he doesn't know what's going on this is all new to him but is that a crime is never having met a

79
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:33,160
gay person before now the same thing as an actual hatred of gay people most people who are freaking

80
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:37,880
out on social media right now over this dude are themselves either small town imports to the

81
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:42,680
nearest big city or they're still stuck in that small town and live vicariously online because

82
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:47,240
they hate their lives literally the progressive goal the dream is to take people from these

83
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:51,960
conservative towns entice them through economic factors to move into the city and then once

84
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:55,480
they're there convert them politically and culturally and now you're gonna shun this

85
00:06:55,480 --> 00:07:00,040
dude or even have your hooks in him these people are exceptionally stupid bodega bro

86
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:05,560
ended up going on this whole apology tour thing okay so if you came here from twitter you may

87
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:11,080
know me as bodega bro I made a video that got taken way out of context so I went off private

88
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:16,040
to show you guys what bodega bro is really all about also if you know anybody that's hiring tech

89
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:20,840
sales or needs a workout partner in new york let me know doing a video giving food to the homeless

90
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:25,560
then all right I get it he's trying to soften the impact of a legit online hate mob coming after him

91
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:29,560
it's cringy but whatever and hey he's still doing good so fuck it I hope things work out for him

92
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:33,480
new york's expensive he needs a new job and he didn't deserve to get fired but I'm reminded

93
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:38,120
of that really god-awful woke game tell me why that we played on the gaming channel recently

94
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:41,960
the playable characters are these two twin girls except one of them grows up to be a trans man

95
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:47,320
there's this old backwater redneck type character who is friendly but very old school and extremely

96
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:51,320
uneducated on progressive topics at the beginning of the game you can tell that he means well but

97
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:59,000
he makes a few remarks about gender that the trans man is insulted by your brother oh shit

98
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:03,720
huh I guess I heard about that but I never

99
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:15,960
damn you look like a real man so do you sam you know what I mean I just didn't know they could

100
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:22,600
make a woman looks almost like a man I've seen a couple of lady transvestites on the TV before but

101
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:26,040
I've never seen a dude

102
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:38,680
sam that's not how you say that say what transvestites yes it's transgender transgender men

103
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:45,800
uh I'm sorry it's hard to keep track out here in Delos Crossing

104
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:52,760
world's just moving on without us during act two he comes back and the first thing he does is

105
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:56,520
apologize saying that he looked it up on the internet he doesn't quite understand all these

106
00:08:56,520 --> 00:09:01,880
new ideas but he never meant to be mean anyway I also came by to say I fired up the google and I

107
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:09,240
I did some reading I didn't know the germs between all those words I mean I you know never

108
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:17,080
been much of a reader but I think I get why what I said was wrong and I'm real sorry

109
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:26,680
oh and before I forget or the lady of the house and from that point on he treats the trans man

110
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:32,120
character like any other guy that is exactly how it should be from both the liberal and progressive

111
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:36,840
point of view and yet the game is written like we should be viewing him as a bad person it's like

112
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:41,560
no he's actually the most likable guy in the game everybody else is insufferably woke meanwhile his

113
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:46,760
attitude is just like yeah I don't understand but hey you do you and that's how it should be have

114
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:51,000
you seen this clip of Natasha Devon no uh no relation talking about her bisexuality let's

115
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:57,720
listen in my sexuality is still part of my identity and I think probably the most hurtful

116
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:03,240
response that I get when I speak about this publicly and I get this both online and in real

117
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:12,200
life is when people say I don't care why are you telling me about this what you do in the bedroom

118
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:18,200
is none of my business and what those people are failing to understand is that this isn't just

119
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:23,080
about sex this is about life I think this attitude is at the heart of the matter the

120
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:28,200
liberal principle here is live and let live it doesn't matter what you do you do you even if

121
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:32,360
it's something new even if there's something about it that's new to me that's a little bit strange and

122
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:36,520
I might need to acclimate to if you're not bothering anybody else then fine but these

123
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:41,800
people don't want that liberal neutrality they want explicit validation neutrality to a progressive

124
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:45,960
is just as bad as rejection because remember you can't stand still on a moving train everything

125
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:50,440
needs to move leftward over time you've heard all this before bodega bro went through in a strange

126
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:54,600
tongue-in-cheek kind of way a hero's journey he went to a new place he got exposed to new things

127
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:59,480
he reveled in the novelty but ultimately accepted the non-damaging parts of it and grew a little bit

128
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:03,880
as a result remember what he said about gay people but that neutrality is an affront to the

129
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:08,680
progressive and the criticism even more so he was not a perfect leftist right out the womb and so

130
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:13,400
for that he needs to be eternally repentant the fact that he is not the fact that he gave clap

131
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:16,520
back meant that the prog canceling of him was inevitable
