Hello my friends, welcome to the fifth episode of SJ Weekly.

00:04.960 --> 00:10.840
I don't know if this is coming out on Sunday or on Monday, because if you could not tell,

00:10.840 --> 00:12.440
I'm actually sick.

00:12.440 --> 00:17.640
If you watched my stream on Friday, you'll know that I was already starting to get sick

00:17.640 --> 00:23.200
that night, and today I called it to work because I had a shift today on Saturday.

00:23.200 --> 00:28.240
I'm gonna try to edit it and put it out on Sunday, but I might just need some sleep or

00:28.240 --> 00:29.240
something.

00:29.480 --> 00:33.240
Anyway, let's get on to the SJW nonsense.

00:33.240 --> 00:38.040
First is an article from April 5th, 2018.

00:38.040 --> 00:44.120
Trump's most influential white nationalist troll is a Middlebury grad who lives in Manhattan.

00:44.120 --> 00:46.280
Who is Ricky Vaughn?

00:46.280 --> 00:51.320
That was one of the big questions for anyone following far-right politics during the 2016

00:51.320 --> 00:52.560
presidential election.

00:52.560 --> 00:58.000
The Twitter troll, who took his name and avatar from Charlie Sheen's character in Major League,

00:58.000 --> 01:06.240
was everywhere on social media, an indefeagable circulator of edgy memes and rah rah Donald

01:06.240 --> 01:11.680
Trump boosterism, and anti-semitism and white nationalism.

01:11.680 --> 01:14.080
There was no mistaking Ricky Vaughn's influence.

01:14.080 --> 01:18.320
He had tens of thousands of followers, and his talent for blending far-right propaganda

01:18.320 --> 01:23.120
with conservative messages on Twitter made him a keen disseminator of extremist views

01:23.120 --> 01:28.000
to Republican voters and a central figure in the alt-right white supremacist movement

01:28.000 --> 01:30.400
that attached itself to Trump's coattails.

01:30.400 --> 01:37.480
The MIT Media Lab named him to its list of top 150 influencers on the election, based

01:37.480 --> 01:41.020
on news appearance and social media impact.

01:41.020 --> 01:45.400
He finished ahead of NBC News, Judge Report, and Stephen Colbert.

01:45.400 --> 01:49.720
Mainstream conservatives didn't know they were retweeting an avowed racist and anti-semite,

01:49.720 --> 01:51.760
but they liked what Ricky Vaughn had to say.

01:51.760 --> 01:57.760
So basically, the first half of this article is the Huffington Post whining that this guy,

01:57.760 --> 02:02.760
whom I honestly don't even know who he is, had a bigger social media reach than most

02:02.760 --> 02:08.280
of the mainstream news, which honestly is only going to continue to be the trend.

02:08.280 --> 02:11.500
Ricky Vaughn was able to remain anonymous until this week.

02:11.500 --> 02:17.060
On Monday, white nationalist Republican candidate Paul Nellen, who was ready against House Speaker

02:17.060 --> 02:21.720
Paul Ryan in Wisconsin, grew upset about criticism directed at him, and seemingly not being able

02:21.720 --> 02:27.200
to be disavowed by Ricky Vaughn, as the alt-right fragments under the weight of infighting lawsuits

02:27.200 --> 02:35.240
and anti-fascist opposition.

02:35.240 --> 02:39.520
Two main camps have emerged, the real-world extremists who want to continue holding rallies

02:39.520 --> 02:45.840
and mixing it up in the streets, and the optics cucks who think the best approach to the mainstream

02:45.840 --> 02:49.200
is to keep pushing alt-right ideas through better propaganda.

02:49.200 --> 02:54.600
Amid all this infighting, an angry Nellen dropped Ricky Vaughn's real name, and I'm

02:54.600 --> 03:00.280
not going to keep scrolling down the article at this point, because this article basically

03:00.280 --> 03:02.600
exists to dox this guy.

03:02.600 --> 03:10.120
The first half of it is whining that he is more influence than Huffington Post or any

03:10.120 --> 03:14.840
other news outlet, and then the second half of it is just petty doxing.

03:14.840 --> 03:20.360
If I were to keep scrolling down, you would see his real name, popular misspellings of

03:20.360 --> 03:25.440
it, pictures of him on his various social media accounts, his job history, and I think

03:25.440 --> 03:26.720
where he currently lives.

03:26.720 --> 03:31.080
In fact, I don't have the link for this, but wasn't there a situation a few months back

03:31.080 --> 03:34.680
where basically, was it CNN?

03:34.680 --> 03:40.080
Some big news outlet blackmailed somebody who was trolling or posting alt-right stuff

03:40.080 --> 03:43.680
online, and said, we're going to reveal your name and what we found out about you if you

03:43.680 --> 03:46.720
don't shut down your Twitter account, or something, I don't remember the complete story, but

03:46.720 --> 03:50.640
it was something along those lines, and that's basically what the mainstream media has turned

03:50.640 --> 03:53.380
into now, they've turned into a bunch of bullies.

03:53.380 --> 03:57.880
They're actually trying to act like mafiosos regarding the news, I guess, or regarding

03:57.880 --> 04:02.240
the flow of information, because they're realizing that the internet has completely taken away

04:02.240 --> 04:03.300
their power.

04:03.300 --> 04:10.040
But while we're on the subject of old media, here's a tweet from Glad Day Bookshop in Toronto,

04:10.040 --> 04:16.120
Canada, the oldest LGBTQ bookstore in the world, serving Toronto since 1970.

04:16.120 --> 04:19.400
Language evolves, evolve yours, let's see this propaganda.

04:19.400 --> 04:22.360
Instead of his or her, try theirs.

04:22.360 --> 04:26.440
Somebody left their phone on the table in the library, I hope they come back for it.

04:26.440 --> 04:33.880
See, I already say that, if I don't know a person's gender, I usually use the gender

04:33.880 --> 04:39.200
non-specific plural word, theirs, and it's nothing to do with trans-aware this week,

04:39.200 --> 04:42.040
it's just because it just seems grammatically correct, right?

04:42.040 --> 04:45.280
And I certainly don't need a fucking flyer to tell me to do it.

04:45.280 --> 04:47.880
Instead of guys, try folks.

04:47.880 --> 04:50.480
All of you folks are one of them in this space.

04:50.480 --> 04:54.880
What is it with SJWs using the word folk?

04:54.880 --> 05:01.680
Because I've always grown up thinking that folks is like a rednecky term, you know?

05:01.680 --> 05:08.100
Like it's a situation where you have folk who sit on the front porch and stub their

05:08.100 --> 05:13.980
banjo and that's the kind of feel I get from the word folk, but it's been used by SJWs

05:13.980 --> 05:19.420
so much that now whenever I see folk I just think that somebody's probably a fucking regressive.

05:19.420 --> 05:24.200
But no, I use guys as a gender neutral term now, and I think it's rapidly becoming the

05:24.200 --> 05:27.580
gender neutral term for a group of people.

05:27.580 --> 05:30.260
Maybe they don't like that, but fuck it.

05:30.260 --> 05:35.420
Instead of the lady slash man in the red shirt, try the person in the red shirt.

05:35.420 --> 05:39.340
I'd like to call upon the person in the red shirt to come join me on stage.

05:39.340 --> 05:41.780
Um, why?

05:41.780 --> 05:46.800
There's no reason to de-gender a signifier in most cases.

05:46.800 --> 05:50.580
Of course there are going to be fringe cases where somebody looks like the gender they're

05:50.580 --> 05:54.740
not and they get insulted by it and then you apologize and you say, listen, I'm sorry,

05:54.740 --> 05:56.240
I didn't know.

05:56.240 --> 06:02.780
But there's no reason to fucking police your own goddamn speech for the minority of cases.

06:02.780 --> 06:05.380
Instead of men or women, try everyone.

06:05.380 --> 06:08.420
These cozy winter outfits can be worn by everyone.

06:08.420 --> 06:12.260
Well, what if it's, it's meant for a man or a woman?

06:12.260 --> 06:17.140
I mean, if it's, if it's a cozy winter outfit, you do realize that men and women have different

06:17.140 --> 06:19.600
cuts of clothing.

06:19.600 --> 06:22.560
You know, it's not even just a fashion thing.

06:22.560 --> 06:27.120
It's just that the clothing is cut differently because men have broader shoulders and women

06:27.120 --> 06:28.580
have wider hips.

06:28.580 --> 06:32.780
So sometimes clothing is actually made differently.

06:32.780 --> 06:37.340
So no, maybe this cozy winter outfit can't be worn by everyone.

06:37.340 --> 06:40.340
Maybe it can only be worn by women or by men.

06:40.340 --> 06:44.780
There are many good reasons to want only one of the two genders to be involved in any kind

06:44.780 --> 06:46.920
of particular situation.

06:46.920 --> 06:49.820
Sometimes it's not appropriate for everyone to be there.

06:49.820 --> 06:53.420
But yeah, they say language evolves, evolve yours.

06:53.420 --> 06:57.940
Well that, that's the interesting thing is that in terms of guys and folks, language

06:57.940 --> 07:02.420
is evolving because guys at one point was not a gender neutral term and now it is.

07:02.420 --> 07:03.580
So language is evolving.

07:03.580 --> 07:07.300
You just don't like the way that it's, you just don't like the way that it's evolving.

07:07.300 --> 07:09.860
So this isn't about language evolving.

07:09.860 --> 07:11.180
This is about a power grab.

07:11.180 --> 07:13.980
This is about you being able to police people's speech.

07:13.980 --> 07:17.180
And in fact, you can see this case, let's scroll down a bit.

07:17.180 --> 07:22.300
You got his or her or men and women is still being inclusive.

07:22.300 --> 07:26.680
You're talking about sex instead of gender guys is non-gender specific.

07:26.680 --> 07:28.380
No need to evolve language.

07:28.380 --> 07:32.280
If you use it correctly, this is from geeks can be cool.

07:32.280 --> 07:38.180
And of course this shop replies with, wow, it turns out geeks cannot in fact be cool.

07:38.180 --> 07:40.120
Of course, of course.

07:40.120 --> 07:45.200
This is one step away from complaining about anime avatars or, or being a gamer.

07:45.200 --> 07:49.600
I'm bad about guys as a term for a group of folks, but I'm trying to get better.

07:49.600 --> 07:51.980
Y'all is also a great word for this.

07:51.980 --> 07:54.580
They're literally becoming red decks.

07:54.580 --> 07:56.160
They're just red decks now.

07:56.160 --> 08:00.720
Let's keep sticking to Twitter though, because now we've got a thread from Mark Kern, otherwise

08:00.720 --> 08:02.720
known as a grums.

08:02.720 --> 08:06.920
For those of you who don't know, he worked on vanilla world of Warcraft back in the day.

08:06.920 --> 08:12.840
And then he, after leaving blizzard, he went indie.

08:12.840 --> 08:19.400
He was a big part of gamer gate and he, he also talks about politics, not just gaming

08:19.400 --> 08:23.360
on his Twitter account, which is, you know, kind of the way things are going now, because

08:23.360 --> 08:26.680
I definitely started as a, as an anime and games channel.

08:26.680 --> 08:27.920
And now I talk about politics.

08:27.920 --> 08:32.920
I think, I think gamer gate helped bring a lot of people who were previously apolitical

08:32.920 --> 08:34.560
into the political sphere.

08:34.560 --> 08:35.560
Okay.

08:35.560 --> 08:40.920
Let's talk about how to beat Trump, specifically, how you can get me and millions of others

08:40.920 --> 08:43.040
back to voting for Democrats.

08:43.040 --> 08:47.320
Like I used to first, you have to want me back, stop being, but hurt that I voted for

08:47.320 --> 08:51.180
Trump and stop trying to get me punched, fired, or thrown out of restaurants.

08:51.180 --> 08:52.180
You need us back.

08:52.180 --> 08:58.500
You want to beat Trump, stop pushing us into ditches.

08:58.500 --> 09:00.060
You'll lose again.

09:00.060 --> 09:02.500
Second, embrace free speech.

09:02.500 --> 09:06.080
You used to, and it opened a lot of doors for progressive values because we were free

09:06.080 --> 09:11.900
to express controversial ideas at the time like LGBTQ rights.

09:11.900 --> 09:18.620
You would riot if speech was muzzled and rightly so stop shadow banning and deplatforming next

09:19.000 --> 09:23.800
Stop campaigning on resist and impeach and have a real message again.

09:23.800 --> 09:27.800
Hope was a powerful one for Obama and hooked me back then.

09:27.800 --> 09:32.080
You need to find a positive message to rally around a great vision for the future.

09:32.080 --> 09:36.300
Right now, your message is hate and fear and zero vision.

09:36.300 --> 09:39.460
Next embrace middle America and our country again.

09:39.460 --> 09:43.520
You have a vision for what America should be, but stop saying America and middle America

09:43.520 --> 09:44.520
have to go.

09:44.520 --> 09:47.000
Make America's everyone's home.

09:47.000 --> 09:48.000
Be welcoming.

09:48.000 --> 09:51.140
Right now you just want to burn it all down, not a good look.

09:51.140 --> 09:54.460
Fight for jobs for everyone, people want to work.

09:54.460 --> 09:56.840
And stop fetishizing tech.

09:56.840 --> 10:02.680
Not everyone can be a web programmer and we need food and power and dirty jobs.

10:02.680 --> 10:07.380
Value hard work and blue collar industries and help them too and hold their jobs in the

10:07.380 --> 10:09.040
respect they are due.

10:09.040 --> 10:10.040
Fight for them.

10:10.040 --> 10:13.560
Finally, fight for equal rights and opportunity.

10:13.560 --> 10:17.980
But please stop trying to force everyone to live your way.

10:17.980 --> 10:23.080
Stop trying to criminalize every minor thing and get rid of political correctness.

10:23.080 --> 10:26.960
Learn to laugh again and embrace comedy as figurative not literal.

10:26.960 --> 10:28.760
Leave fiction alone.

10:28.760 --> 10:33.120
It's about having a vision to build up America again instead of one focused on tearing it

10:33.120 --> 10:34.120
down.

10:34.120 --> 10:35.540
Evolve it, don't destroy it.

10:35.540 --> 10:40.800
Campaigning on he and his base are evil nazis is just wrong and doesn't work.

10:40.800 --> 10:44.580
A lot of us used to vote for you and share your values.

10:44.580 --> 10:48.240
You don't have to do all this overnight, but just showing me and millions of others that

10:48.240 --> 10:52.820
you're willing to move in his direction would do a lot to get me to take a second look.

10:52.820 --> 10:54.280
Want to beat Trump?

10:54.280 --> 11:00.680
Take a page from your own speaking points and start to listen, for real.

11:00.680 --> 11:05.460
Now if you didn't pay attention back on the first of July when this thread was initially

11:05.460 --> 11:14.360
posted, Grums got into a lot of trouble for this because he basically outlined a list

11:14.360 --> 11:18.020
of demands and they're all reasonable demands.

11:18.020 --> 11:23.540
I think most centrists who voted for Trump would agree with this list of demands.

11:23.540 --> 11:30.620
This list basically describes why the moral grandstanding of the left is not enough by

11:30.620 --> 11:37.900
itself to get votes and how somebody like Trump, and frankly, Trump is far from the

11:37.900 --> 11:43.940
perfect president, but how somebody like Trump was able to beat an establishment backed candidate

11:44.000 --> 11:51.400
like Hillary with tons of money pouring into her, and it's because the middle of the country,

11:51.400 --> 11:58.040
the rational centrists saw what happened between Hillary and Bernie and knew what Hillary was

11:58.040 --> 12:00.800
and said, never Hillary.

12:00.800 --> 12:06.640
We would rather have Trump just to fucking stick it to you guys who think that you can

12:06.640 --> 12:11.580
rig elections with impunity, and that's what they did, and that's why we are where we are now.

12:11.580 --> 12:17.280
You could obviously blame Trump for what Trump does if you don't like it, but the reason

12:17.280 --> 12:23.800
we have Trump is basically because the Democrats became, and the left in general, has become

12:23.800 --> 12:30.080
megalomaniacal with all of this shit and needed to be taken down a peg or two, or five, or ten.

12:30.080 --> 12:36.000
And since Trump's election, there's been this constant meltdown, this unending salt mine

12:36.000 --> 12:43.380
that's been uncovered on the left, and continuing to be salty is not the way to ensure that

12:43.380 --> 12:50.060
you guys get elected in 2020, or in 2022, or in 2024, it's not gonna happen.

12:50.060 --> 12:54.620
And in fact, a lot of the replies that Mark Curd got from the left show this.

12:54.620 --> 12:56.300
Let me try and find them here.

12:56.300 --> 12:58.780
Nobody owes you shit, asshole.

12:58.780 --> 13:03.740
If you're too dumb to make the right decision after what you've seen, you deserve what you get.

13:03.740 --> 13:06.840
You're definitely earning your verified check mark today, buddy.

13:06.840 --> 13:10.260
You could stop demanding the party court, you take a good long look at what's happening

13:10.260 --> 13:14.600
in this country, and vote for the candidate who is better for the entire nation.

13:14.600 --> 13:18.880
Not because your feelings and ego are being stroked, because it's the adult thing to do.

13:18.880 --> 13:24.560
Oh, oh, it's the adult thing to do to vote the way that you want people to vote, right?

13:24.560 --> 13:28.720
If people have differing political opinions from you, I guess you simply consider them

13:28.720 --> 13:30.720
to be children, right?

13:30.720 --> 13:35.320
Maybe that's why people are not going to vote the way that you want them to vote, because

13:35.320 --> 13:36.780
you're an asshole.

13:36.780 --> 13:41.640
You voted for Trump, seeing the danger, racism, and hostility to people of color.

13:41.640 --> 13:43.220
You saw the blatant corruption.

13:43.220 --> 13:44.220
The math is easy.

13:44.220 --> 13:46.700
You're okay with racism, corruption, and fascism.

13:46.700 --> 13:50.100
We won't be taking you out for an ice cream cone to get your vote.

13:50.100 --> 13:51.860
The adults will handle this.

13:51.860 --> 13:55.160
Do you honestly think that Hillary wasn't racist?

13:55.160 --> 13:57.580
Do you honestly think that Hillary wasn't a war boggler?

13:57.580 --> 14:00.740
Do you honestly think that Hillary wasn't blatantly corrupt?

14:00.740 --> 14:05.180
Do you honestly think that your side is acting like adults when you've been doing nothing

14:05.180 --> 14:07.900
but melting down since 2016?

14:07.900 --> 14:09.320
We don't want you back.

14:09.320 --> 14:13.620
The fact that you voted for Trump and are seeing what he's doing and would consider

14:13.620 --> 14:16.100
voting for him again is all we need to know about you.

14:16.100 --> 14:18.220
Well, this is how you lose the election.

14:18.220 --> 14:26.820
You can't simply assume that 50% of your population, possibly more, are idiots, are immoral, are

14:26.820 --> 14:31.860
entirely without consideration because that 50% is going to come along and fucking destroy

14:31.860 --> 14:32.860
you every time.

14:32.860 --> 14:37.100
I mean, this guy even fucking links an article that is the exact thing I'm talking about.

14:37.100 --> 14:38.580
The people are the problem.

14:38.580 --> 14:41.100
No, the people are not the problem.

14:41.100 --> 14:43.500
I can't believe you could even fucking think this.

14:43.500 --> 14:48.380
Until you meet my demands, I will happily continue voting for Trump just to show you.

14:48.380 --> 14:52.940
This thread could not be any more disconnected from reality if it had read, I'll vote for

14:52.940 --> 14:54.740
you if you get me a pet unicorn.

14:54.740 --> 14:59.460
And then here's Marge at Large, and where did you get the idea that we want to woo you

14:59.460 --> 15:00.460
back?

15:00.460 --> 15:01.460
Voting is a personal choice.

15:01.460 --> 15:02.460
You choose who you vote for.

15:02.460 --> 15:04.020
I will choose who I vote for.

15:04.020 --> 15:05.140
That's how it works.

15:05.140 --> 15:09.000
If you choose to vote for corruption, lies, and bully tactics, that's on you.

15:09.000 --> 15:13.100
Nothing you listed in this thread is a value of the Trump administration and you voted

15:13.100 --> 15:16.440
for him anyway, so none of this is important to you.

15:16.440 --> 15:20.020
You don't get special treatment because you can't wake up and be part of a solution to

15:20.020 --> 15:22.460
heal this country.

15:22.460 --> 15:26.820
All of these replies are exactly what he's talking about, and all of these people are

15:26.820 --> 15:29.340
too fucking stupid to see it.

15:29.340 --> 15:34.500
Also, they think that Mark Card's a white guy, he's Asian, but he's outlining a list

15:34.500 --> 15:40.380
of reasonable things that a politician on either side of the aisle has to provide if

15:40.380 --> 15:45.560
they're going to swing the centrist vote, and he's saying that the left is actively

15:45.560 --> 15:51.780
refusing to provide any of these things, and instead is resorting to shame tactics in order

15:51.780 --> 15:53.300
to try to get people to vote for them.

15:53.300 --> 15:57.600
And in reply, all of these fucking replies are shame tactics.

15:57.600 --> 16:03.340
And speaking of a mob of SJWs coming after somebody, I have this article here from July

16:03.340 --> 16:07.940
14th, 2018 called, I was the mob until the mob came for me.

16:07.940 --> 16:12.620
I drive food delivery for an online app to make rent and support myself and my young

16:12.620 --> 16:13.620
family.

16:13.620 --> 16:14.620
This is my new life.

16:14.620 --> 16:19.900
I once had a well-paid job in what would be described as the social justice industry.

16:19.900 --> 16:24.580
But I upset the wrong person, and within a short window of time, I was considered too

16:24.580 --> 16:28.580
toxic for my employer's taste.

16:28.580 --> 16:32.860
I was publicly shamed, mobbed, and reduced to a symbol of male privilege.

16:32.860 --> 16:36.200
I was cast out of my career in my professional community.

16:36.200 --> 16:40.460
Writing anything under my own byline now would invite a renewal of this mobbing, which is

16:40.460 --> 16:44.300
why, with my editor's permission, I am writing this under a pseudonym.

16:44.300 --> 16:45.620
He knows who I am.

16:45.620 --> 16:50.900
Oh, it's almost like you now know what it felt like to be almost every single fucking

16:50.900 --> 16:52.840
indie dev during gamergate.

16:52.840 --> 16:58.020
It's almost like you now know what it feels like to be anybody who supports any right

16:58.020 --> 17:02.620
wing or even any centrist position on Twitter nowadays.

17:02.620 --> 17:06.620
In my previous life, I was a self-righteous social justice crusader.

17:06.620 --> 17:11.060
I would use my mid-sized Twitter and Facebook platforms to signal my wokeness on topics

17:11.060 --> 17:15.100
such as LGBT rights, rape culture, and racial injustice.

17:15.100 --> 17:19.820
Most of the opinions I held then are still opinions that I hold today, but I now realize

17:19.820 --> 17:25.460
that my social media hyperactivity was, in reality, doing more harm than good.

17:25.460 --> 17:30.420
And based on the title, I presume it only took until The Mob Came After You for you

17:30.420 --> 17:31.620
to figure this out.

17:31.620 --> 17:36.620
Within the world created by the various apps I used, I got plenty of shares and retweets,

17:36.620 --> 17:40.500
but this masked how ineffective I had become outside in the real world.

17:40.500 --> 17:46.000
The only causes I was actually contributing to were the causes of mobbing and public shaming.

17:46.000 --> 17:48.340
Real change does not stem from these tactics.

17:48.340 --> 17:52.180
They only cause division, alienation, and bitterness.

17:52.180 --> 17:57.740
This is pretty much the exact thing that happened to Mark Curd in the previous story, and this

17:57.740 --> 18:00.300
is an SJW finally fucking realizing it.

18:00.300 --> 18:02.100
How did I become that person?

18:02.100 --> 18:05.200
It happened because it was exhilarating.

18:05.200 --> 18:09.500
Every time I would call someone racist or sexist, I would get a rush.

18:09.500 --> 18:14.900
That rush would then be reaffirmed and sustained by the stars, hearts, and thumbs up that constitute

18:14.900 --> 18:18.220
the nickels and dimes of social media validation.

18:18.220 --> 18:22.260
The people giving me these stars, hearts, and thumbs up were engaging in their own cynical

18:22.260 --> 18:23.260
game.

18:23.260 --> 18:27.340
A fear of being targeted by the mob induces us to signal publicly that we are part of

18:27.340 --> 18:28.340
it.

18:28.340 --> 18:32.380
I forget how that old quote goes, but it was something like people enjoy performing and

18:32.380 --> 18:37.960
then in turn having other people watch them perform rather than actually doing anything

18:37.960 --> 18:39.360
of substance.

18:39.360 --> 18:42.200
That is basically what social media has become.

18:42.200 --> 18:46.320
It's just become a giant circle jerk where people pat other people on the back and think

18:46.320 --> 18:48.920
that they're actually doing something about the world's ills.

18:48.920 --> 18:53.620
I know I've talked about this before several times in various videos, but I've lost many

18:53.620 --> 18:58.480
friends to this cycle.

18:58.480 --> 19:00.400
I talked about the d-pad in a few videos.

19:00.400 --> 19:06.720
I talked about that girl Casey in a few videos, but there's been others too.

19:06.720 --> 19:08.120
I'm going to go show you this right now.

19:08.120 --> 19:11.400
I'm going to start what we're doing and just go show you this.

19:11.400 --> 19:12.400
Here's Spoody's Twitter.

19:12.400 --> 19:13.440
We all know who this guy is.

19:13.440 --> 19:19.520
He's not really doing much of anything right now.

19:19.520 --> 19:24.560
He's replaying Final Fantasy X and tweeting about it, a game that he's already made a

19:24.560 --> 19:29.040
four-part review on instead of actually making new content.

19:29.040 --> 19:32.360
He hates this game, so I don't know why he's doing it.

19:32.360 --> 19:38.720
Maybe he thinks that his 12 social media likes are actually worth something.

19:38.720 --> 19:40.980
Maybe that's his paycheck now.

19:40.980 --> 19:42.320
But let's scroll down a bit, okay?

19:42.320 --> 19:43.320
Let's scroll down a bit.

19:43.320 --> 19:45.880
Takahata101 says, I have written jokes I regret.

19:45.880 --> 19:47.520
I wish I could go back and not have made.

19:47.520 --> 19:48.520
Part of growing up.

19:48.520 --> 19:51.740
I have plenty of regrets about things like this and everyone knows I've said some pretty

19:51.740 --> 19:52.740
shameful things.

19:52.740 --> 19:55.400
I think your intent at the time is the most important thing to consider.

19:55.400 --> 19:58.040
I doubt your goal was to hurt anyone or most people will understand that.

19:58.040 --> 19:59.040
Really, Spoody?

19:59.040 --> 20:00.040
Is that the case?

20:00.040 --> 20:05.360
During your Final Fantasy VIII review, you made an extended gay rant and you're now

20:05.360 --> 20:09.080
very ashamed of it because you've gone full fucking SJW.

20:09.080 --> 20:13.560
But alternatively, maybe you and your ilk shouldn't be digging through the fucking

20:13.560 --> 20:19.620
Twitter feeds of people to find 10-year-old tweets if this is going to be your logic.

20:19.620 --> 20:23.840
If back then you thought it was okay and you didn't actually mean to hurt anybody, if

20:23.840 --> 20:27.800
back then that's the person that you were, then you should be left alone.

20:27.800 --> 20:34.000
How many fucking people have SJWs ruined because of shit they said a decade ago?

20:34.000 --> 20:35.200
I have plenty of regrets.

20:35.200 --> 20:37.360
Cue Final Fantasy VIII review gay rant.

20:37.360 --> 20:38.480
Yep, got it in one.

20:38.480 --> 20:39.640
I have no excuse for that one.

20:39.640 --> 20:41.280
I really don't know what I was thinking.

20:41.280 --> 20:44.160
Well here's what you were thinking, Noah.

20:44.160 --> 20:46.320
You were not an SJW at the time.

20:46.320 --> 20:54.680
You were a mid-20s comedian on YouTube, a platform that hadn't really blown up yet and

20:54.680 --> 20:57.440
you were one of the bigger people on it at the time.

20:57.480 --> 21:00.600
I mean, you're a fucking nobody at this point now, dude.

21:00.600 --> 21:03.320
And man, I spent many years looking up to you.

21:03.320 --> 21:08.440
And now you want to go back and like astroturf your more successful stuff to replace it with

21:08.440 --> 21:09.440
what?

21:09.440 --> 21:11.480
Because you're not fucking doing anything.

21:11.480 --> 21:13.120
You're just sitting around.

21:13.120 --> 21:15.000
You're tweeting about Trump all day.

21:15.000 --> 21:16.000
And man, you want to talk about...

21:16.000 --> 21:19.520
I guess I might as well just blow every old fucking friendship I had out of the water

21:19.520 --> 21:20.520
this time.

21:20.520 --> 21:25.020
But let's go to Black Light Attack.

21:25.100 --> 21:32.540
Black Light Attack was important because he was the first YouTuber to do a Nuzlocke Let's

21:32.540 --> 21:33.540
Play.

21:33.540 --> 21:40.100
Like a Nuzlocke run in Pokemon as a Let's Play, not just like a text thing or a comic.

21:40.100 --> 21:44.120
And for a while, his playthrough was number one.

21:44.120 --> 21:46.780
The number one search on YouTube for just Pokemon.

21:46.780 --> 21:49.020
You search Pokemon, you found his playthrough.

21:49.020 --> 21:50.740
That's how big that he was.

21:50.740 --> 21:54.340
And he invented 60 second Let's Plays.

21:54.340 --> 21:57.820
And he's done a lot of interesting things over the years.

21:57.820 --> 21:58.820
But here's what happened.

21:58.820 --> 22:01.180
He was a regular guy.

22:01.180 --> 22:02.180
Look at him now.

22:02.180 --> 22:03.220
Look at him now.

22:03.220 --> 22:04.220
He was a regular guy.

22:04.220 --> 22:07.940
If I look it up, I mean, he wore a cringey fucking fedora.

22:07.940 --> 22:12.900
But this was way back before fedoras had fallen out of style.

22:12.900 --> 22:17.140
And he was a regular self depreciating guy.

22:17.140 --> 22:18.140
Right?

22:18.140 --> 22:20.660
And that's okay.

22:20.660 --> 22:23.620
But then he became this.

22:23.620 --> 22:26.940
He moved out to the West Coast, he got a job at Twitch TV.

22:26.940 --> 22:30.420
As far as I know, he got fired from the job at Twitch.

22:30.420 --> 22:32.900
And then he went full SJW.

22:32.900 --> 22:36.780
This is a guy that I used to love watching.

22:36.780 --> 22:40.180
And I have a lot of respect for him because he's made some really good stuff.

22:40.180 --> 22:45.620
But after losing it at Twitch, he said he wanted to make it as a full time Twitch streamer

22:45.620 --> 22:46.880
and he barely streams.

22:46.880 --> 22:48.340
He streams once a month.

22:48.340 --> 22:53.540
And then his Twitter feed is about social justice issues and talking about fucking

22:53.540 --> 22:54.540
Trump.

22:54.540 --> 22:58.340
And instead of streaming, he just spends his time talking about social justice and Trump.

22:58.340 --> 23:00.100
And that's what his entire Twitter feed is.

23:00.100 --> 23:02.060
He's basically gone the way of spoonie.

23:02.060 --> 23:08.220
And this really sucks because these are people that I used to like and I was friends with

23:08.220 --> 23:10.060
and I respect.

23:10.060 --> 23:12.860
And then you look at this article, right?

23:12.860 --> 23:14.060
We're back to the article.

23:14.060 --> 23:16.360
I was the mob until the mob came for me.

23:16.360 --> 23:18.380
This is the process of how that happens.

23:18.380 --> 23:19.380
All right?

23:19.380 --> 23:26.860
Most people who are usually good people, they get sucked into this shit, okay?

23:26.860 --> 23:30.460
Most people in the SJW community, they're not bad people.

23:30.460 --> 23:32.120
They've just been manipulated and sucked in.

23:32.120 --> 23:35.480
And then they're kind of stuck there for a while, right?

23:35.480 --> 23:39.520
It's really only like the cult leaders that are actually the legitimately bad people.

23:39.520 --> 23:41.140
They have agendas.

23:41.140 --> 23:45.480
What's happening is that you have good people who are apolitical and they don't really know

23:45.480 --> 23:46.800
how politics works.

23:46.800 --> 23:50.400
And they see the world and they say, how can we fix this?

23:50.400 --> 23:52.840
And then the SJWs have the loudest voice right now.

23:52.840 --> 23:55.320
So they show up and they say, here's how we fix it.

23:55.320 --> 23:59.600
And then they get drawn in because they think, oh, well, maybe I can do my part to help make

23:59.600 --> 24:01.360
other people's lives better.

24:01.360 --> 24:02.780
That is what most of these people think.

24:02.780 --> 24:04.440
They think they're doing something good.

24:04.440 --> 24:08.100
And then as soon as they realize that they're not doing something good, they're sucked in

24:08.100 --> 24:09.100
too far.

24:09.100 --> 24:13.320
And either they're threatened by their friend group or they're threatened by other people

24:13.320 --> 24:16.160
or they've built up an entire life around this shit.

24:16.760 --> 24:23.160
It becomes too painful or too hard to rip it all down because it means destroying a

24:23.160 --> 24:28.000
good chunk of their sense of self and the way they live their life.

24:28.000 --> 24:29.000
And they get stuck there.

24:29.000 --> 24:31.040
I'm sorry about that side rant, guys.

24:31.040 --> 24:33.180
That was just me going off the rails a little bit.

24:33.180 --> 24:34.820
I apologize.

24:34.820 --> 24:39.780
Just a few years ago, many of my friends and peers who self-identify as liberals or progressives

24:39.780 --> 24:45.560
were open fans of provocative standup comedians, such as Sarah Silverman and shows like South

24:45.560 --> 24:46.560
Park.

24:46.560 --> 24:52.600
Today, such material is seen as deeply problematic or even labeled as hate speech.

24:52.600 --> 24:58.460
I went from minding my own business when people told risque jokes to practically fainting

24:58.460 --> 25:03.240
when they use the wrong pronoun or express or expressed a right of center view.

25:03.240 --> 25:08.360
I went from making fun of the guy who took edgy jokes too seriously to becoming that

25:08.360 --> 25:09.360
guy.

25:09.360 --> 25:12.460
This is exactly what has happened to a lot of my old friends.

25:12.460 --> 25:16.800
And I've lost a lot of people to this stuff.

25:16.800 --> 25:18.320
And there are times when it just feels bad.

25:18.320 --> 25:24.560
I think, hey, maybe I should go back and call that person up or email them or message them

25:24.560 --> 25:28.040
or tweet them or something and see how they are.

25:28.040 --> 25:34.840
And nine times out of 10, because I'm a political centrist, they would hate me now.

25:34.840 --> 25:37.800
And often when I contact them, they say, oh, you hang out with Sargon.

25:37.800 --> 25:38.800
I hate you.

25:38.800 --> 25:43.400
When my call outs were met with approval and admiration, I was lavished with praise.

25:43.400 --> 25:45.020
Thank you so much for speaking out.

25:45.020 --> 25:46.020
You're so brave.

25:46.020 --> 25:48.320
We need more men like you.

25:48.320 --> 25:52.100
Then one day suddenly I was accused of some of the very transgressions I'd called out

25:52.100 --> 25:53.100
in others.

25:53.100 --> 25:54.820
I was guilty, of course.

25:54.820 --> 25:57.500
There's no such thing as due process in the world.

25:57.500 --> 26:01.100
And once judgment has been rendered against you, the mob starts combing through your past

26:01.100 --> 26:05.580
looking for similar transgressions that might have been missed at the time.

26:05.580 --> 26:10.000
I was now told that I had been creating a toxic environment for years at my workplace

26:10.000 --> 26:14.960
that had been making the space around me unsafe through microaggressions and macroaggressions

26:14.960 --> 26:15.960
alike.

26:15.960 --> 26:19.880
Well, you, you do reap what you sow in the end, don't you?

26:19.880 --> 26:23.720
Social justice is a surveillance culture, a snitch culture.

26:23.720 --> 26:28.200
The constant vigilance on the part of my colleagues and friends did be in.

26:28.200 --> 26:30.600
That's why I'm delivering sushi and pizza.

26:30.600 --> 26:34.960
Not that I'm complaining, it's honest work and it's led me to rediscover how to interact

26:34.960 --> 26:36.740
with people in the real world.

26:36.740 --> 26:42.660
I am a kinder and more respectful person now that I'm not regularly on social media attacking

26:42.660 --> 26:45.380
people for not being kind and respectful.

26:45.380 --> 26:47.100
Let that be the message.

26:47.100 --> 26:51.700
If there's any SJW who happens to be watching this and you're just thinking of a complete

26:51.700 --> 26:53.140
fucking retard.

26:53.140 --> 26:58.460
Let this paragraph be the only thing that actually penetrates your goddamn skull.

26:58.460 --> 27:02.280
This is what you are and maybe this is why you hate honest work.

27:02.280 --> 27:04.660
Maybe this is why you hate blue collar industries.

27:04.660 --> 27:09.000
This is why you hate the Midwest or, or your hometown.

27:09.000 --> 27:13.600
Maybe it's because you realize that actually being exposed to the real fucking world and

27:13.600 --> 27:20.040
actually talking to people is the one thing over anything else that will emotionally destroy

27:20.040 --> 27:24.400
the social justice particles that have grown over every single SJW.

27:24.400 --> 27:30.300
I mobbed and shamed people for incidents that became front page news, but when they were

27:30.300 --> 27:35.800
vindicated or exonerated by some real world investigation, it was treated as a footnote

27:35.800 --> 27:37.940
by my online community.

27:37.940 --> 27:42.000
If someone survives a social justice call out, it simply means that the mob has moved

27:42.000 --> 27:43.760
on to someone new.

27:43.760 --> 27:48.600
No one ever apologizes for a false accusation and everyone has a selective memory regarding

27:48.600 --> 27:49.660
what they've done.

27:49.660 --> 27:53.780
This honestly sounds a lot like what Zoe Quinn said gamergate was, but it turns out that

27:53.780 --> 27:57.000
Zoe Quinn actively takes part in shit like this.

27:57.000 --> 28:02.400
Upon reading Jon Ronson's 2015 book, So You've Been Publicly Shamed, I recently went back

28:02.400 --> 28:05.080
into my Twitter archives to study my own behavior.

28:05.080 --> 28:09.460
I was shocked to discover that I'd actually participate quite enthusiastically in the

28:09.460 --> 28:16.500
public shaming of Justine Sacco, whose 2013 saga following a bad AIDS joke on Twitter

28:16.500 --> 28:19.740
forms one of the book's central case studies.

28:19.740 --> 28:21.720
My memory had told me different.

28:21.720 --> 28:23.940
In my mind, I didn't really participate.

28:23.940 --> 28:26.520
It was others who took things too far.

28:26.520 --> 28:31.040
In reality, the evidence showed that I was among the most vicious of Sacco's mobbers.

28:31.040 --> 28:34.240
Ronson describes a central problem with Twitter shaming.

28:34.240 --> 28:38.000
There is a disconnect between the severity of the crime and the gleeful savagery of the

28:38.000 --> 28:39.000
punishment.

28:39.000 --> 28:43.020
For years, I was blind to my own gleeful savagery.

28:43.020 --> 28:48.300
I'm sure we all have things that we did when we were young that we're not proud of.

28:48.300 --> 28:53.960
Social media allows us to go back and actually see those things without any alteration because

28:53.960 --> 28:59.400
I can think of times when I was a kid that I did something pretty terrible and there

28:59.400 --> 29:00.480
was no internet.

29:00.480 --> 29:07.080
So for me, it's just remembering things and being ashamed of them inside my own head.

29:07.080 --> 29:10.400
But now with Twitter, you can actually go back and see it.

29:10.400 --> 29:14.720
I recently had a dream that played out in the cartoon universe of my food delivery app,

29:14.720 --> 29:17.540
the dashboard software that guides my daily work life.

29:17.540 --> 29:22.800
The dream turned my workday drive into a third person video game with my cartoon car standing

29:22.800 --> 29:24.800
naked for me as a protagonist.

29:24.800 --> 29:27.840
At some point, I started missing some of the streets and the little line that marks my

29:27.840 --> 29:30.880
trail with blue pixels indicated where I had gone off road.

29:30.880 --> 29:34.840
My path got erratic and the dream became otherworldly as dreams eventually do.

29:34.840 --> 29:39.200
I drove over cartoon sidewalks, through cartoon buildings and cartoon parks.

29:39.200 --> 29:42.320
It's a two dimensional world and the apps, everything was flat.

29:42.320 --> 29:45.840
Through the unique logic of dreams, I survived all this all while picking up and dropping

29:45.840 --> 29:47.400
off deliveries and making money.

29:47.400 --> 29:50.000
In my dream, I was making progress.

29:50.000 --> 29:53.400
As my REM cycle intensified, my dream concluded.

29:53.400 --> 29:57.520
I was jolted from my two dimensional app world and thrust back into the reality of the living

29:57.520 --> 29:58.520
world.

29:58.520 --> 30:02.520
Where I could understand the suffering, carnage and death I would have caused by my in app

30:02.520 --> 30:03.920
actions.

30:03.920 --> 30:08.160
There were bodies strewn across along the street, screaming bystanders, destroyed lives,

30:08.160 --> 30:09.160
chaos.

30:09.160 --> 30:11.960
My car by contrast was indestructible while I was living in the app.

30:11.960 --> 30:14.880
Okay, this is a dream, man.

30:14.880 --> 30:15.880
You're fine.

30:15.880 --> 30:19.720
The social justice vigilantism I was living on Twitter and Facebook was like the app in

30:19.720 --> 30:21.080
my dream.

30:21.080 --> 30:24.560
Aggressive online virtue signaling is a fundamentally two dimensional act.

30:24.560 --> 30:25.740
It has no human depth.

30:25.740 --> 30:29.700
It's only when we snap out of it, see the world as it really is and people as they really

30:29.700 --> 30:34.040
are, that we can appreciate that a structure of human suffering we caused when we were

30:34.040 --> 30:35.480
trapped inside.

30:35.480 --> 30:39.600
Of course, the analogy rings true, even though we can kind of tell that this guy did used

30:39.600 --> 30:42.360
to be an SJW writer.

30:42.360 --> 30:46.400
This sounds like something that Nathan Grayson would have written on Kotaku or something

30:46.400 --> 30:47.840
stupid, right?

30:47.840 --> 30:53.520
But at least this time, he's actually talking about something that makes a modicum of sense.

30:53.520 --> 31:00.800
People have jokingly made SJW comparisons to the Borg or to zombies over the years.

31:00.800 --> 31:03.200
And I think that they're quite frankly right.

31:03.200 --> 31:05.760
These people get sucked into these groups.

31:05.760 --> 31:09.960
And then they kind of get it's a little bit shaming.

31:09.960 --> 31:11.600
It's a little bit of a power rush.

31:11.600 --> 31:17.000
It's a little bit being chastised and then having the ability to chastise others.

31:17.000 --> 31:22.880
There's a definite power structure to it and a constant checking and rechecking of

31:22.880 --> 31:27.360
everyone around you and having yourself checked by everybody around you as well.

31:27.360 --> 31:29.840
And these people, they get stuck in it.

31:29.840 --> 31:32.720
Fifty percent of it is that they're scared to leave.

31:32.720 --> 31:39.720
And fifty percent of it is that they enjoy the power rush of temporarily being the Inquisitor

31:39.720 --> 31:42.920
when it's not their turn to be labeled the oppressor.

31:42.920 --> 31:45.840
And that's why you get a lot of decent people who get sucked into this stuff.

31:45.840 --> 31:51.960
That's why you can see creators who made amazing things eight or ten years ago, like

31:51.960 --> 31:58.320
Spooty, like Black Light Attack, like so many other people, they vanish into this fucking

31:58.320 --> 32:04.240
black hole, this interdimensional pit of fucking emotional nothingness.

32:04.240 --> 32:08.880
It's not just that these SJWs hurt other people, though they do.

32:08.880 --> 32:10.560
They also hurt themselves.

32:10.560 --> 32:14.280
When is the last time you've actually found a happy SJW?

32:14.280 --> 32:23.080
A SJW who is actually happy with their body or their life or their relationships or something.

32:23.080 --> 32:27.400
How many of them have good relationships with their families or with their parents?

32:27.400 --> 32:31.960
I mean, of course, there are definitely many instances where you should not have a relationship

32:31.960 --> 32:34.960
with your parents because you have legitimately abusive parents.

32:34.960 --> 32:36.680
I know people who are like that.

32:36.680 --> 32:41.740
However, there's so many times when I hear about people who don't like their parents

32:41.740 --> 32:45.660
and it's simply because it's their parents and they don't like authority and they still

32:45.660 --> 32:50.380
can't get over that when they were eight or nine, they got spanked because they did something

32:50.380 --> 32:52.500
horrendously awful as a kid.

32:52.500 --> 32:58.740
And now they're 30 or they're 35 and they're still like, you know, fuck the man.

32:58.740 --> 33:04.500
How many fat activists do you think actually like their body or are actually healthy or

33:04.500 --> 33:06.580
happy at any size?

33:06.580 --> 33:10.840
How much of that shit do you think is just them participating in a grand illusion and

33:10.840 --> 33:16.600
demanding the rest of society also prop up this grand illusion along with them just

33:16.600 --> 33:21.400
so that they don't have to confront the fact that they eat too much and they don't do enough

33:21.400 --> 33:22.400
exercise.

33:22.400 --> 33:28.840
This is mainly why I've gone from hating SJWs to feeling immensely sorry for them.

33:28.840 --> 33:30.760
They might cause sub-damage to other people.

33:30.760 --> 33:32.640
There might be online mobs.

33:32.640 --> 33:34.760
There might be other things like that.

33:34.760 --> 33:40.120
There might be, you know, they might take over shows like She-Racks, ThunderCats, and

33:40.120 --> 33:44.620
they might ruin comics or Magic the Gathering or video games.

33:44.620 --> 33:48.160
There's a lot of things that they do that are terrible that affect other people, but

33:48.160 --> 33:51.700
it's all because they hate themselves.

33:51.700 --> 33:55.360
They don't have any happiness in their lives.

33:55.360 --> 33:57.720
And that's the core of it.

33:57.720 --> 34:01.560
This is what this person who wrote this article has finally realized.

34:01.560 --> 34:06.560
I've been thinking of a video topic now for at least six months, maybe longer.

34:06.560 --> 34:14.320
It's supposed to be like a self-help for SJWs.

34:14.320 --> 34:20.640
Things have only gotten worse regarding this stuff, both in terms of SJWs in general and

34:20.640 --> 34:25.360
also on a personal level with me.

34:25.360 --> 34:29.640
I might make that the next video I do because I think it's actually important.
