0	4960	Hello my friends, welcome to the fifth episode of SJ Weekly.
4960	10840	I don't know if this is coming out on Sunday or on Monday, because if you could not tell,
10840	12440	I'm actually sick.
12440	17640	If you watched my stream on Friday, you'll know that I was already starting to get sick
17640	23200	that night, and today I called it to work because I had a shift today on Saturday.
23200	28240	I'm gonna try to edit it and put it out on Sunday, but I might just need some sleep or
28240	29240	something.
29480	33240	Anyway, let's get on to the SJW nonsense.
33240	38040	First is an article from April 5th, 2018.
38040	44120	Trump's most influential white nationalist troll is a Middlebury grad who lives in Manhattan.
44120	46280	Who is Ricky Vaughn?
46280	51320	That was one of the big questions for anyone following far-right politics during the 2016
51320	52560	presidential election.
52560	58000	The Twitter troll, who took his name and avatar from Charlie Sheen's character in Major League,
58000	66240	was everywhere on social media, an indefeagable circulator of edgy memes and rah rah Donald
66240	71680	Trump boosterism, and anti-semitism and white nationalism.
71680	74080	There was no mistaking Ricky Vaughn's influence.
74080	78320	He had tens of thousands of followers, and his talent for blending far-right propaganda
78320	83120	with conservative messages on Twitter made him a keen disseminator of extremist views
83120	88000	to Republican voters and a central figure in the alt-right white supremacist movement
88000	90400	that attached itself to Trump's coattails.
90400	97480	The MIT Media Lab named him to its list of top 150 influencers on the election, based
97480	101020	on news appearance and social media impact.
101020	105400	He finished ahead of NBC News, Judge Report, and Stephen Colbert.
105400	109720	Mainstream conservatives didn't know they were retweeting an avowed racist and anti-semite,
109720	111760	but they liked what Ricky Vaughn had to say.
111760	117760	So basically, the first half of this article is the Huffington Post whining that this guy,
117760	122760	whom I honestly don't even know who he is, had a bigger social media reach than most
122760	128280	of the mainstream news, which honestly is only going to continue to be the trend.
128280	131500	Ricky Vaughn was able to remain anonymous until this week.
131500	137060	On Monday, white nationalist Republican candidate Paul Nellen, who was ready against House Speaker
137060	141720	Paul Ryan in Wisconsin, grew upset about criticism directed at him, and seemingly not being able
141720	147200	to be disavowed by Ricky Vaughn, as the alt-right fragments under the weight of infighting lawsuits
147200	155240	and anti-fascist opposition.
155240	159520	Two main camps have emerged, the real-world extremists who want to continue holding rallies
159520	165840	and mixing it up in the streets, and the optics cucks who think the best approach to the mainstream
165840	169200	is to keep pushing alt-right ideas through better propaganda.
169200	174600	Amid all this infighting, an angry Nellen dropped Ricky Vaughn's real name, and I'm
174600	180280	not going to keep scrolling down the article at this point, because this article basically
180280	182600	exists to dox this guy.
182600	190120	The first half of it is whining that he is more influence than Huffington Post or any
190120	194840	other news outlet, and then the second half of it is just petty doxing.
194840	200360	If I were to keep scrolling down, you would see his real name, popular misspellings of
200360	205440	it, pictures of him on his various social media accounts, his job history, and I think
205440	206720	where he currently lives.
206720	211080	In fact, I don't have the link for this, but wasn't there a situation a few months back
211080	214680	where basically, was it CNN?
214680	220080	Some big news outlet blackmailed somebody who was trolling or posting alt-right stuff
220080	223680	online, and said, we're going to reveal your name and what we found out about you if you
223680	226720	don't shut down your Twitter account, or something, I don't remember the complete story, but
226720	230640	it was something along those lines, and that's basically what the mainstream media has turned
230640	233380	into now, they've turned into a bunch of bullies.
233380	237880	They're actually trying to act like mafiosos regarding the news, I guess, or regarding
237880	242240	the flow of information, because they're realizing that the internet has completely taken away
242240	243300	their power.
243300	250040	But while we're on the subject of old media, here's a tweet from Glad Day Bookshop in Toronto,
250040	256120	Canada, the oldest LGBTQ bookstore in the world, serving Toronto since 1970.
256120	259400	Language evolves, evolve yours, let's see this propaganda.
259400	262360	Instead of his or her, try theirs.
262360	266440	Somebody left their phone on the table in the library, I hope they come back for it.
266440	273880	See, I already say that, if I don't know a person's gender, I usually use the gender
273880	279200	non-specific plural word, theirs, and it's nothing to do with trans-aware this week,
279200	282040	it's just because it just seems grammatically correct, right?
282040	285280	And I certainly don't need a fucking flyer to tell me to do it.
285280	287880	Instead of guys, try folks.
287880	290480	All of you folks are one of them in this space.
290480	294880	What is it with SJWs using the word folk?
294880	301680	Because I've always grown up thinking that folks is like a rednecky term, you know?
301680	308100	Like it's a situation where you have folk who sit on the front porch and stub their
308100	313980	banjo and that's the kind of feel I get from the word folk, but it's been used by SJWs
313980	319420	so much that now whenever I see folk I just think that somebody's probably a fucking regressive.
319420	324200	But no, I use guys as a gender neutral term now, and I think it's rapidly becoming the
324200	327580	gender neutral term for a group of people.
327580	330260	Maybe they don't like that, but fuck it.
330260	335420	Instead of the lady slash man in the red shirt, try the person in the red shirt.
335420	339340	I'd like to call upon the person in the red shirt to come join me on stage.
339340	341780	Um, why?
341780	346800	There's no reason to de-gender a signifier in most cases.
346800	350580	Of course there are going to be fringe cases where somebody looks like the gender they're
350580	354740	not and they get insulted by it and then you apologize and you say, listen, I'm sorry,
354740	356240	I didn't know.
356240	362780	But there's no reason to fucking police your own goddamn speech for the minority of cases.
362780	365380	Instead of men or women, try everyone.
365380	368420	These cozy winter outfits can be worn by everyone.
368420	372260	Well, what if it's, it's meant for a man or a woman?
372260	377140	I mean, if it's, if it's a cozy winter outfit, you do realize that men and women have different
377140	379600	cuts of clothing.
379600	382560	You know, it's not even just a fashion thing.
382560	387120	It's just that the clothing is cut differently because men have broader shoulders and women
387120	388580	have wider hips.
388580	392780	So sometimes clothing is actually made differently.
392780	397340	So no, maybe this cozy winter outfit can't be worn by everyone.
397340	400340	Maybe it can only be worn by women or by men.
400340	404780	There are many good reasons to want only one of the two genders to be involved in any kind
404780	406920	of particular situation.
406920	409820	Sometimes it's not appropriate for everyone to be there.
409820	413420	But yeah, they say language evolves, evolve yours.
413420	417940	Well that, that's the interesting thing is that in terms of guys and folks, language
417940	422420	is evolving because guys at one point was not a gender neutral term and now it is.
422420	423580	So language is evolving.
423580	427300	You just don't like the way that it's, you just don't like the way that it's evolving.
427300	429860	So this isn't about language evolving.
429860	431180	This is about a power grab.
431180	433980	This is about you being able to police people's speech.
433980	437180	And in fact, you can see this case, let's scroll down a bit.
437180	442300	You got his or her or men and women is still being inclusive.
442300	446680	You're talking about sex instead of gender guys is non-gender specific.
446680	448380	No need to evolve language.
448380	452280	If you use it correctly, this is from geeks can be cool.
452280	458180	And of course this shop replies with, wow, it turns out geeks cannot in fact be cool.
458180	460120	Of course, of course.
460120	465200	This is one step away from complaining about anime avatars or, or being a gamer.
465200	469600	I'm bad about guys as a term for a group of folks, but I'm trying to get better.
469600	471980	Y'all is also a great word for this.
471980	474580	They're literally becoming red decks.
474580	476160	They're just red decks now.
476160	480720	Let's keep sticking to Twitter though, because now we've got a thread from Mark Kern, otherwise
480720	482720	known as a grums.
482720	486920	For those of you who don't know, he worked on vanilla world of Warcraft back in the day.
486920	492840	And then he, after leaving blizzard, he went indie.
492840	499400	He was a big part of gamer gate and he, he also talks about politics, not just gaming
499400	503360	on his Twitter account, which is, you know, kind of the way things are going now, because
503360	506680	I definitely started as a, as an anime and games channel.
506680	507920	And now I talk about politics.
507920	512920	I think, I think gamer gate helped bring a lot of people who were previously apolitical
512920	514560	into the political sphere.
514560	515560	Okay.
515560	520920	Let's talk about how to beat Trump, specifically, how you can get me and millions of others
520920	523040	back to voting for Democrats.
523040	527320	Like I used to first, you have to want me back, stop being, but hurt that I voted for
527320	531180	Trump and stop trying to get me punched, fired, or thrown out of restaurants.
531180	532180	You need us back.
532180	538500	You want to beat Trump, stop pushing us into ditches.
538500	540060	You'll lose again.
540060	542500	Second, embrace free speech.
542500	546080	You used to, and it opened a lot of doors for progressive values because we were free
546080	551900	to express controversial ideas at the time like LGBTQ rights.
551900	558620	You would riot if speech was muzzled and rightly so stop shadow banning and deplatforming next
559000	563800	Stop campaigning on resist and impeach and have a real message again.
563800	567800	Hope was a powerful one for Obama and hooked me back then.
567800	572080	You need to find a positive message to rally around a great vision for the future.
572080	576300	Right now, your message is hate and fear and zero vision.
576300	579460	Next embrace middle America and our country again.
579460	583520	You have a vision for what America should be, but stop saying America and middle America
583520	584520	have to go.
584520	587000	Make America's everyone's home.
587000	588000	Be welcoming.
588000	591140	Right now you just want to burn it all down, not a good look.
591140	594460	Fight for jobs for everyone, people want to work.
594460	596840	And stop fetishizing tech.
596840	602680	Not everyone can be a web programmer and we need food and power and dirty jobs.
602680	607380	Value hard work and blue collar industries and help them too and hold their jobs in the
607380	609040	respect they are due.
609040	610040	Fight for them.
610040	613560	Finally, fight for equal rights and opportunity.
613560	617980	But please stop trying to force everyone to live your way.
617980	623080	Stop trying to criminalize every minor thing and get rid of political correctness.
623080	626960	Learn to laugh again and embrace comedy as figurative not literal.
626960	628760	Leave fiction alone.
628760	633120	It's about having a vision to build up America again instead of one focused on tearing it
633120	634120	down.
634120	635540	Evolve it, don't destroy it.
635540	640800	Campaigning on he and his base are evil nazis is just wrong and doesn't work.
640800	644580	A lot of us used to vote for you and share your values.
644580	648240	You don't have to do all this overnight, but just showing me and millions of others that
648240	652820	you're willing to move in his direction would do a lot to get me to take a second look.
652820	654280	Want to beat Trump?
654280	660680	Take a page from your own speaking points and start to listen, for real.
660680	665460	Now if you didn't pay attention back on the first of July when this thread was initially
665460	674360	posted, Grums got into a lot of trouble for this because he basically outlined a list
674360	678020	of demands and they're all reasonable demands.
678020	683540	I think most centrists who voted for Trump would agree with this list of demands.
683540	690620	This list basically describes why the moral grandstanding of the left is not enough by
690620	697900	itself to get votes and how somebody like Trump, and frankly, Trump is far from the
697900	703940	perfect president, but how somebody like Trump was able to beat an establishment backed candidate
704000	711400	like Hillary with tons of money pouring into her, and it's because the middle of the country,
711400	718040	the rational centrists saw what happened between Hillary and Bernie and knew what Hillary was
718040	720800	and said, never Hillary.
720800	726640	We would rather have Trump just to fucking stick it to you guys who think that you can
726640	731580	rig elections with impunity, and that's what they did, and that's why we are where we are now.
731580	737280	You could obviously blame Trump for what Trump does if you don't like it, but the reason
737280	743800	we have Trump is basically because the Democrats became, and the left in general, has become
743800	750080	megalomaniacal with all of this shit and needed to be taken down a peg or two, or five, or ten.
750080	756000	And since Trump's election, there's been this constant meltdown, this unending salt mine
756000	763380	that's been uncovered on the left, and continuing to be salty is not the way to ensure that
763380	770060	you guys get elected in 2020, or in 2022, or in 2024, it's not gonna happen.
770060	774620	And in fact, a lot of the replies that Mark Curd got from the left show this.
774620	776300	Let me try and find them here.
776300	778780	Nobody owes you shit, asshole.
778780	783740	If you're too dumb to make the right decision after what you've seen, you deserve what you get.
783740	786840	You're definitely earning your verified check mark today, buddy.
786840	790260	You could stop demanding the party court, you take a good long look at what's happening
790260	794600	in this country, and vote for the candidate who is better for the entire nation.
794600	798880	Not because your feelings and ego are being stroked, because it's the adult thing to do.
798880	804560	Oh, oh, it's the adult thing to do to vote the way that you want people to vote, right?
804560	808720	If people have differing political opinions from you, I guess you simply consider them
808720	810720	to be children, right?
810720	815320	Maybe that's why people are not going to vote the way that you want them to vote, because
815320	816780	you're an asshole.
816780	821640	You voted for Trump, seeing the danger, racism, and hostility to people of color.
821640	823220	You saw the blatant corruption.
823220	824220	The math is easy.
824220	826700	You're okay with racism, corruption, and fascism.
826700	830100	We won't be taking you out for an ice cream cone to get your vote.
830100	831860	The adults will handle this.
831860	835160	Do you honestly think that Hillary wasn't racist?
835160	837580	Do you honestly think that Hillary wasn't a war boggler?
837580	840740	Do you honestly think that Hillary wasn't blatantly corrupt?
840740	845180	Do you honestly think that your side is acting like adults when you've been doing nothing
845180	847900	but melting down since 2016?
847900	849320	We don't want you back.
849320	853620	The fact that you voted for Trump and are seeing what he's doing and would consider
853620	856100	voting for him again is all we need to know about you.
856100	858220	Well, this is how you lose the election.
858220	866820	You can't simply assume that 50% of your population, possibly more, are idiots, are immoral, are
866820	871860	entirely without consideration because that 50% is going to come along and fucking destroy
871860	872860	you every time.
872860	877100	I mean, this guy even fucking links an article that is the exact thing I'm talking about.
877100	878580	The people are the problem.
878580	881100	No, the people are not the problem.
881100	883500	I can't believe you could even fucking think this.
883500	888380	Until you meet my demands, I will happily continue voting for Trump just to show you.
888380	892940	This thread could not be any more disconnected from reality if it had read, I'll vote for
892940	894740	you if you get me a pet unicorn.
894740	899460	And then here's Marge at Large, and where did you get the idea that we want to woo you
899460	900460	back?
900460	901460	Voting is a personal choice.
901460	902460	You choose who you vote for.
902460	904020	I will choose who I vote for.
904020	905140	That's how it works.
905140	909000	If you choose to vote for corruption, lies, and bully tactics, that's on you.
909000	913100	Nothing you listed in this thread is a value of the Trump administration and you voted
913100	916440	for him anyway, so none of this is important to you.
916440	920020	You don't get special treatment because you can't wake up and be part of a solution to
920020	922460	heal this country.
922460	926820	All of these replies are exactly what he's talking about, and all of these people are
926820	929340	too fucking stupid to see it.
929340	934500	Also, they think that Mark Card's a white guy, he's Asian, but he's outlining a list
934500	940380	of reasonable things that a politician on either side of the aisle has to provide if
940380	945560	they're going to swing the centrist vote, and he's saying that the left is actively
945560	951780	refusing to provide any of these things, and instead is resorting to shame tactics in order
951780	953300	to try to get people to vote for them.
953300	957600	And in reply, all of these fucking replies are shame tactics.
957600	963340	And speaking of a mob of SJWs coming after somebody, I have this article here from July
963340	967940	14th, 2018 called, I was the mob until the mob came for me.
967940	972620	I drive food delivery for an online app to make rent and support myself and my young
972620	973620	family.
973620	974620	This is my new life.
974620	979900	I once had a well-paid job in what would be described as the social justice industry.
979900	984580	But I upset the wrong person, and within a short window of time, I was considered too
984580	988580	toxic for my employer's taste.
988580	992860	I was publicly shamed, mobbed, and reduced to a symbol of male privilege.
992860	996200	I was cast out of my career in my professional community.
996200	1000460	Writing anything under my own byline now would invite a renewal of this mobbing, which is
1000460	1004300	why, with my editor's permission, I am writing this under a pseudonym.
1004300	1005620	He knows who I am.
1005620	1010900	Oh, it's almost like you now know what it felt like to be almost every single fucking
1010900	1012840	indie dev during gamergate.
1012840	1018020	It's almost like you now know what it feels like to be anybody who supports any right
1018020	1022620	wing or even any centrist position on Twitter nowadays.
1022620	1026620	In my previous life, I was a self-righteous social justice crusader.
1026620	1031060	I would use my mid-sized Twitter and Facebook platforms to signal my wokeness on topics
1031060	1035100	such as LGBT rights, rape culture, and racial injustice.
1035100	1039820	Most of the opinions I held then are still opinions that I hold today, but I now realize
1039820	1045460	that my social media hyperactivity was, in reality, doing more harm than good.
1045460	1050420	And based on the title, I presume it only took until The Mob Came After You for you
1050420	1051620	to figure this out.
1051620	1056620	Within the world created by the various apps I used, I got plenty of shares and retweets,
1056620	1060500	but this masked how ineffective I had become outside in the real world.
1060500	1066000	The only causes I was actually contributing to were the causes of mobbing and public shaming.
1066000	1068340	Real change does not stem from these tactics.
1068340	1072180	They only cause division, alienation, and bitterness.
1072180	1077740	This is pretty much the exact thing that happened to Mark Curd in the previous story, and this
1077740	1080300	is an SJW finally fucking realizing it.
1080300	1082100	How did I become that person?
1082100	1085200	It happened because it was exhilarating.
1085200	1089500	Every time I would call someone racist or sexist, I would get a rush.
1089500	1094900	That rush would then be reaffirmed and sustained by the stars, hearts, and thumbs up that constitute
1094900	1098220	the nickels and dimes of social media validation.
1098220	1102260	The people giving me these stars, hearts, and thumbs up were engaging in their own cynical
1102260	1103260	game.
1103260	1107340	A fear of being targeted by the mob induces us to signal publicly that we are part of
1107340	1108340	it.
1108340	1112380	I forget how that old quote goes, but it was something like people enjoy performing and
1112380	1117960	then in turn having other people watch them perform rather than actually doing anything
1117960	1119360	of substance.
1119360	1122200	That is basically what social media has become.
1122200	1126320	It's just become a giant circle jerk where people pat other people on the back and think
1126320	1128920	that they're actually doing something about the world's ills.
1128920	1133620	I know I've talked about this before several times in various videos, but I've lost many
1133620	1138480	friends to this cycle.
1138480	1140400	I talked about the d-pad in a few videos.
1140400	1146720	I talked about that girl Casey in a few videos, but there's been others too.
1146720	1148120	I'm going to go show you this right now.
1148120	1151400	I'm going to start what we're doing and just go show you this.
1151400	1152400	Here's Spoody's Twitter.
1152400	1153440	We all know who this guy is.
1153440	1159520	He's not really doing much of anything right now.
1159520	1164560	He's replaying Final Fantasy X and tweeting about it, a game that he's already made a
1164560	1169040	four-part review on instead of actually making new content.
1169040	1172360	He hates this game, so I don't know why he's doing it.
1172360	1178720	Maybe he thinks that his 12 social media likes are actually worth something.
1178720	1180980	Maybe that's his paycheck now.
1180980	1182320	But let's scroll down a bit, okay?
1182320	1183320	Let's scroll down a bit.
1183320	1185880	Takahata101 says, I have written jokes I regret.
1185880	1187520	I wish I could go back and not have made.
1187520	1188520	Part of growing up.
1188520	1191740	I have plenty of regrets about things like this and everyone knows I've said some pretty
1191740	1192740	shameful things.
1192740	1195400	I think your intent at the time is the most important thing to consider.
1195400	1198040	I doubt your goal was to hurt anyone or most people will understand that.
1198040	1199040	Really, Spoody?
1199040	1200040	Is that the case?
1200040	1205360	During your Final Fantasy VIII review, you made an extended gay rant and you're now
1205360	1209080	very ashamed of it because you've gone full fucking SJW.
1209080	1213560	But alternatively, maybe you and your ilk shouldn't be digging through the fucking
1213560	1219620	Twitter feeds of people to find 10-year-old tweets if this is going to be your logic.
1219620	1223840	If back then you thought it was okay and you didn't actually mean to hurt anybody, if
1223840	1227800	back then that's the person that you were, then you should be left alone.
1227800	1234000	How many fucking people have SJWs ruined because of shit they said a decade ago?
1234000	1235200	I have plenty of regrets.
1235200	1237360	Cue Final Fantasy VIII review gay rant.
1237360	1238480	Yep, got it in one.
1238480	1239640	I have no excuse for that one.
1239640	1241280	I really don't know what I was thinking.
1241280	1244160	Well here's what you were thinking, Noah.
1244160	1246320	You were not an SJW at the time.
1246320	1254680	You were a mid-20s comedian on YouTube, a platform that hadn't really blown up yet and
1254680	1257440	you were one of the bigger people on it at the time.
1257480	1260600	I mean, you're a fucking nobody at this point now, dude.
1260600	1263320	And man, I spent many years looking up to you.
1263320	1268440	And now you want to go back and like astroturf your more successful stuff to replace it with
1268440	1269440	what?
1269440	1271480	Because you're not fucking doing anything.
1271480	1273120	You're just sitting around.
1273120	1275000	You're tweeting about Trump all day.
1275000	1276000	And man, you want to talk about...
1276000	1279520	I guess I might as well just blow every old fucking friendship I had out of the water
1279520	1280520	this time.
1280520	1285020	But let's go to Black Light Attack.
1285100	1292540	Black Light Attack was important because he was the first YouTuber to do a Nuzlocke Let's
1292540	1293540	Play.
1293540	1300100	Like a Nuzlocke run in Pokemon as a Let's Play, not just like a text thing or a comic.
1300100	1304120	And for a while, his playthrough was number one.
1304120	1306780	The number one search on YouTube for just Pokemon.
1306780	1309020	You search Pokemon, you found his playthrough.
1309020	1310740	That's how big that he was.
1310740	1314340	And he invented 60 second Let's Plays.
1314340	1317820	And he's done a lot of interesting things over the years.
1317820	1318820	But here's what happened.
1318820	1321180	He was a regular guy.
1321180	1322180	Look at him now.
1322180	1323220	Look at him now.
1323220	1324220	He was a regular guy.
1324220	1327940	If I look it up, I mean, he wore a cringey fucking fedora.
1327940	1332900	But this was way back before fedoras had fallen out of style.
1332900	1337140	And he was a regular self depreciating guy.
1337140	1338140	Right?
1338140	1340660	And that's okay.
1340660	1343620	But then he became this.
1343620	1346940	He moved out to the West Coast, he got a job at Twitch TV.
1346940	1350420	As far as I know, he got fired from the job at Twitch.
1350420	1352900	And then he went full SJW.
1352900	1356780	This is a guy that I used to love watching.
1356780	1360180	And I have a lot of respect for him because he's made some really good stuff.
1360180	1365620	But after losing it at Twitch, he said he wanted to make it as a full time Twitch streamer
1365620	1366880	and he barely streams.
1366880	1368340	He streams once a month.
1368340	1373540	And then his Twitter feed is about social justice issues and talking about fucking
1373540	1374540	Trump.
1374540	1378340	And instead of streaming, he just spends his time talking about social justice and Trump.
1378340	1380100	And that's what his entire Twitter feed is.
1380100	1382060	He's basically gone the way of spoonie.
1382060	1388220	And this really sucks because these are people that I used to like and I was friends with
1388220	1390060	and I respect.
1390060	1392860	And then you look at this article, right?
1392860	1394060	We're back to the article.
1394060	1396360	I was the mob until the mob came for me.
1396360	1398380	This is the process of how that happens.
1398380	1399380	All right?
1399380	1406860	Most people who are usually good people, they get sucked into this shit, okay?
1406860	1410460	Most people in the SJW community, they're not bad people.
1410460	1412120	They've just been manipulated and sucked in.
1412120	1415480	And then they're kind of stuck there for a while, right?
1415480	1419520	It's really only like the cult leaders that are actually the legitimately bad people.
1419520	1421140	They have agendas.
1421140	1425480	What's happening is that you have good people who are apolitical and they don't really know
1425480	1426800	how politics works.
1426800	1430400	And they see the world and they say, how can we fix this?
1430400	1432840	And then the SJWs have the loudest voice right now.
1432840	1435320	So they show up and they say, here's how we fix it.
1435320	1439600	And then they get drawn in because they think, oh, well, maybe I can do my part to help make
1439600	1441360	other people's lives better.
1441360	1442780	That is what most of these people think.
1442780	1444440	They think they're doing something good.
1444440	1448100	And then as soon as they realize that they're not doing something good, they're sucked in
1448100	1449100	too far.
1449100	1453320	And either they're threatened by their friend group or they're threatened by other people
1453320	1456160	or they've built up an entire life around this shit.
1456760	1463160	It becomes too painful or too hard to rip it all down because it means destroying a
1463160	1468000	good chunk of their sense of self and the way they live their life.
1468000	1469000	And they get stuck there.
1469000	1471040	I'm sorry about that side rant, guys.
1471040	1473180	That was just me going off the rails a little bit.
1473180	1474820	I apologize.
1474820	1479780	Just a few years ago, many of my friends and peers who self-identify as liberals or progressives
1479780	1485560	were open fans of provocative standup comedians, such as Sarah Silverman and shows like South
1485560	1486560	Park.
1486560	1492600	Today, such material is seen as deeply problematic or even labeled as hate speech.
1492600	1498460	I went from minding my own business when people told risque jokes to practically fainting
1498460	1503240	when they use the wrong pronoun or express or expressed a right of center view.
1503240	1508360	I went from making fun of the guy who took edgy jokes too seriously to becoming that
1508360	1509360	guy.
1509360	1512460	This is exactly what has happened to a lot of my old friends.
1512460	1516800	And I've lost a lot of people to this stuff.
1516800	1518320	And there are times when it just feels bad.
1518320	1524560	I think, hey, maybe I should go back and call that person up or email them or message them
1524560	1528040	or tweet them or something and see how they are.
1528040	1534840	And nine times out of 10, because I'm a political centrist, they would hate me now.
1534840	1537800	And often when I contact them, they say, oh, you hang out with Sargon.
1537800	1538800	I hate you.
1538800	1543400	When my call outs were met with approval and admiration, I was lavished with praise.
1543400	1545020	Thank you so much for speaking out.
1545020	1546020	You're so brave.
1546020	1548320	We need more men like you.
1548320	1552100	Then one day suddenly I was accused of some of the very transgressions I'd called out
1552100	1553100	in others.
1553100	1554820	I was guilty, of course.
1554820	1557500	There's no such thing as due process in the world.
1557500	1561100	And once judgment has been rendered against you, the mob starts combing through your past
1561100	1565580	looking for similar transgressions that might have been missed at the time.
1565580	1570000	I was now told that I had been creating a toxic environment for years at my workplace
1570000	1574960	that had been making the space around me unsafe through microaggressions and macroaggressions
1574960	1575960	alike.
1575960	1579880	Well, you, you do reap what you sow in the end, don't you?
1579880	1583720	Social justice is a surveillance culture, a snitch culture.
1583720	1588200	The constant vigilance on the part of my colleagues and friends did be in.
1588200	1590600	That's why I'm delivering sushi and pizza.
1590600	1594960	Not that I'm complaining, it's honest work and it's led me to rediscover how to interact
1594960	1596740	with people in the real world.
1596740	1602660	I am a kinder and more respectful person now that I'm not regularly on social media attacking
1602660	1605380	people for not being kind and respectful.
1605380	1607100	Let that be the message.
1607100	1611700	If there's any SJW who happens to be watching this and you're just thinking of a complete
1611700	1613140	fucking retard.
1613140	1618460	Let this paragraph be the only thing that actually penetrates your goddamn skull.
1618460	1622280	This is what you are and maybe this is why you hate honest work.
1622280	1624660	Maybe this is why you hate blue collar industries.
1624660	1629000	This is why you hate the Midwest or, or your hometown.
1629000	1633600	Maybe it's because you realize that actually being exposed to the real fucking world and
1633600	1640040	actually talking to people is the one thing over anything else that will emotionally destroy
1640040	1644400	the social justice particles that have grown over every single SJW.
1644400	1650300	I mobbed and shamed people for incidents that became front page news, but when they were
1650300	1655800	vindicated or exonerated by some real world investigation, it was treated as a footnote
1655800	1657940	by my online community.
1657940	1662000	If someone survives a social justice call out, it simply means that the mob has moved
1662000	1663760	on to someone new.
1663760	1668600	No one ever apologizes for a false accusation and everyone has a selective memory regarding
1668600	1669660	what they've done.
1669660	1673780	This honestly sounds a lot like what Zoe Quinn said gamergate was, but it turns out that
1673780	1677000	Zoe Quinn actively takes part in shit like this.
1677000	1682400	Upon reading Jon Ronson's 2015 book, So You've Been Publicly Shamed, I recently went back
1682400	1685080	into my Twitter archives to study my own behavior.
1685080	1689460	I was shocked to discover that I'd actually participate quite enthusiastically in the
1689460	1696500	public shaming of Justine Sacco, whose 2013 saga following a bad AIDS joke on Twitter
1696500	1699740	forms one of the book's central case studies.
1699740	1701720	My memory had told me different.
1701720	1703940	In my mind, I didn't really participate.
1703940	1706520	It was others who took things too far.
1706520	1711040	In reality, the evidence showed that I was among the most vicious of Sacco's mobbers.
1711040	1714240	Ronson describes a central problem with Twitter shaming.
1714240	1718000	There is a disconnect between the severity of the crime and the gleeful savagery of the
1718000	1719000	punishment.
1719000	1723020	For years, I was blind to my own gleeful savagery.
1723020	1728300	I'm sure we all have things that we did when we were young that we're not proud of.
1728300	1733960	Social media allows us to go back and actually see those things without any alteration because
1733960	1739400	I can think of times when I was a kid that I did something pretty terrible and there
1739400	1740480	was no internet.
1740480	1747080	So for me, it's just remembering things and being ashamed of them inside my own head.
1747080	1750400	But now with Twitter, you can actually go back and see it.
1750400	1754720	I recently had a dream that played out in the cartoon universe of my food delivery app,
1754720	1757540	the dashboard software that guides my daily work life.
1757540	1762800	The dream turned my workday drive into a third person video game with my cartoon car standing
1762800	1764800	naked for me as a protagonist.
1764800	1767840	At some point, I started missing some of the streets and the little line that marks my
1767840	1770880	trail with blue pixels indicated where I had gone off road.
1770880	1774840	My path got erratic and the dream became otherworldly as dreams eventually do.
1774840	1779200	I drove over cartoon sidewalks, through cartoon buildings and cartoon parks.
1779200	1782320	It's a two dimensional world and the apps, everything was flat.
1782320	1785840	Through the unique logic of dreams, I survived all this all while picking up and dropping
1785840	1787400	off deliveries and making money.
1787400	1790000	In my dream, I was making progress.
1790000	1793400	As my REM cycle intensified, my dream concluded.
1793400	1797520	I was jolted from my two dimensional app world and thrust back into the reality of the living
1797520	1798520	world.
1798520	1802520	Where I could understand the suffering, carnage and death I would have caused by my in app
1802520	1803920	actions.
1803920	1808160	There were bodies strewn across along the street, screaming bystanders, destroyed lives,
1808160	1809160	chaos.
1809160	1811960	My car by contrast was indestructible while I was living in the app.
1811960	1814880	Okay, this is a dream, man.
1814880	1815880	You're fine.
1815880	1819720	The social justice vigilantism I was living on Twitter and Facebook was like the app in
1819720	1821080	my dream.
1821080	1824560	Aggressive online virtue signaling is a fundamentally two dimensional act.
1824560	1825740	It has no human depth.
1825740	1829700	It's only when we snap out of it, see the world as it really is and people as they really
1829700	1834040	are, that we can appreciate that a structure of human suffering we caused when we were
1834040	1835480	trapped inside.
1835480	1839600	Of course, the analogy rings true, even though we can kind of tell that this guy did used
1839600	1842360	to be an SJW writer.
1842360	1846400	This sounds like something that Nathan Grayson would have written on Kotaku or something
1846400	1847840	stupid, right?
1847840	1853520	But at least this time, he's actually talking about something that makes a modicum of sense.
1853520	1860800	People have jokingly made SJW comparisons to the Borg or to zombies over the years.
1860800	1863200	And I think that they're quite frankly right.
1863200	1865760	These people get sucked into these groups.
1865760	1869960	And then they kind of get it's a little bit shaming.
1869960	1871600	It's a little bit of a power rush.
1871600	1877000	It's a little bit being chastised and then having the ability to chastise others.
1877000	1882880	There's a definite power structure to it and a constant checking and rechecking of
1882880	1887360	everyone around you and having yourself checked by everybody around you as well.
1887360	1889840	And these people, they get stuck in it.
1889840	1892720	Fifty percent of it is that they're scared to leave.
1892720	1899720	And fifty percent of it is that they enjoy the power rush of temporarily being the Inquisitor
1899720	1902920	when it's not their turn to be labeled the oppressor.
1902920	1905840	And that's why you get a lot of decent people who get sucked into this stuff.
1905840	1911960	That's why you can see creators who made amazing things eight or ten years ago, like
1911960	1918320	Spooty, like Black Light Attack, like so many other people, they vanish into this fucking
1918320	1924240	black hole, this interdimensional pit of fucking emotional nothingness.
1924240	1928880	It's not just that these SJWs hurt other people, though they do.
1928880	1930560	They also hurt themselves.
1930560	1934280	When is the last time you've actually found a happy SJW?
1934280	1943080	A SJW who is actually happy with their body or their life or their relationships or something.
1943080	1947400	How many of them have good relationships with their families or with their parents?
1947400	1951960	I mean, of course, there are definitely many instances where you should not have a relationship
1951960	1954960	with your parents because you have legitimately abusive parents.
1954960	1956680	I know people who are like that.
1956680	1961740	However, there's so many times when I hear about people who don't like their parents
1961740	1965660	and it's simply because it's their parents and they don't like authority and they still
1965660	1970380	can't get over that when they were eight or nine, they got spanked because they did something
1970380	1972500	horrendously awful as a kid.
1972500	1978740	And now they're 30 or they're 35 and they're still like, you know, fuck the man.
1978740	1984500	How many fat activists do you think actually like their body or are actually healthy or
1984500	1986580	happy at any size?
1986580	1990840	How much of that shit do you think is just them participating in a grand illusion and
1990840	1996600	demanding the rest of society also prop up this grand illusion along with them just
1996600	2001400	so that they don't have to confront the fact that they eat too much and they don't do enough
2001400	2002400	exercise.
2002400	2008840	This is mainly why I've gone from hating SJWs to feeling immensely sorry for them.
2008840	2010760	They might cause sub-damage to other people.
2010760	2012640	There might be online mobs.
2012640	2014760	There might be other things like that.
2014760	2020120	There might be, you know, they might take over shows like She-Racks, ThunderCats, and
2020120	2024620	they might ruin comics or Magic the Gathering or video games.
2024620	2028160	There's a lot of things that they do that are terrible that affect other people, but
2028160	2031700	it's all because they hate themselves.
2031700	2035360	They don't have any happiness in their lives.
2035360	2037720	And that's the core of it.
2037720	2041560	This is what this person who wrote this article has finally realized.
2041560	2046560	I've been thinking of a video topic now for at least six months, maybe longer.
2046560	2054320	It's supposed to be like a self-help for SJWs.
2054320	2060640	Things have only gotten worse regarding this stuff, both in terms of SJWs in general and
2060640	2065360	also on a personal level with me.
2065360	2069640	I might make that the next video I do because I think it's actually important.
