00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,960
Hello my friends, welcome to the fifth episode of SJ Weekly.

2
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:10,840
I don't know if this is coming out on Sunday or on Monday, because if you could not tell,

3
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:12,440
I'm actually sick.

4
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:17,640
If you watched my stream on Friday, you'll know that I was already starting to get sick

5
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:23,200
that night, and today I called it to work because I had a shift today on Saturday.

6
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:28,240
I'm gonna try to edit it and put it out on Sunday, but I might just need some sleep or

7
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:29,240
something.

8
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:33,240
Anyway, let's get on to the SJW nonsense.

9
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:38,040
First is an article from April 5th, 2018.

10
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:44,120
Trump's most influential white nationalist troll is a Middlebury grad who lives in Manhattan.

11
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:46,280
Who is Ricky Vaughn?

12
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:51,320
That was one of the big questions for anyone following far-right politics during the 2016

13
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:52,560
presidential election.

14
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:58,000
The Twitter troll, who took his name and avatar from Charlie Sheen's character in Major League,

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:06,240
was everywhere on social media, an indefeagable circulator of edgy memes and rah rah Donald

16
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:11,680
Trump boosterism, and anti-semitism and white nationalism.

17
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:14,080
There was no mistaking Ricky Vaughn's influence.

18
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:18,320
He had tens of thousands of followers, and his talent for blending far-right propaganda

19
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:23,120
with conservative messages on Twitter made him a keen disseminator of extremist views

20
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:28,000
to Republican voters and a central figure in the alt-right white supremacist movement

21
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,400
that attached itself to Trump's coattails.

22
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:37,480
The MIT Media Lab named him to its list of top 150 influencers on the election, based

23
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:41,020
on news appearance and social media impact.

24
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:45,400
He finished ahead of NBC News, Judge Report, and Stephen Colbert.

25
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:49,720
Mainstream conservatives didn't know they were retweeting an avowed racist and anti-semite,

26
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:51,760
but they liked what Ricky Vaughn had to say.

27
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:57,760
So basically, the first half of this article is the Huffington Post whining that this guy,

28
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:02,760
whom I honestly don't even know who he is, had a bigger social media reach than most

29
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:08,280
of the mainstream news, which honestly is only going to continue to be the trend.

30
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:11,500
Ricky Vaughn was able to remain anonymous until this week.

31
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:17,060
On Monday, white nationalist Republican candidate Paul Nellen, who was ready against House Speaker

32
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:21,720
Paul Ryan in Wisconsin, grew upset about criticism directed at him, and seemingly not being able

33
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:27,200
to be disavowed by Ricky Vaughn, as the alt-right fragments under the weight of infighting lawsuits

34
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:35,240
and anti-fascist opposition.

35
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:39,520
Two main camps have emerged, the real-world extremists who want to continue holding rallies

36
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:45,840
and mixing it up in the streets, and the optics cucks who think the best approach to the mainstream

37
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:49,200
is to keep pushing alt-right ideas through better propaganda.

38
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:54,600
Amid all this infighting, an angry Nellen dropped Ricky Vaughn's real name, and I'm

39
00:02:54,600 --> 00:03:00,280
not going to keep scrolling down the article at this point, because this article basically

40
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:02,600
exists to dox this guy.

41
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:10,120
The first half of it is whining that he is more influence than Huffington Post or any

42
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:14,840
other news outlet, and then the second half of it is just petty doxing.

43
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:20,360
If I were to keep scrolling down, you would see his real name, popular misspellings of

44
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:25,440
it, pictures of him on his various social media accounts, his job history, and I think

45
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:26,720
where he currently lives.

46
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:31,080
In fact, I don't have the link for this, but wasn't there a situation a few months back

47
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:34,680
where basically, was it CNN?

48
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:40,080
Some big news outlet blackmailed somebody who was trolling or posting alt-right stuff

49
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:43,680
online, and said, we're going to reveal your name and what we found out about you if you

50
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:46,720
don't shut down your Twitter account, or something, I don't remember the complete story, but

51
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:50,640
it was something along those lines, and that's basically what the mainstream media has turned

52
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:53,380
into now, they've turned into a bunch of bullies.

53
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:57,880
They're actually trying to act like mafiosos regarding the news, I guess, or regarding

54
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:02,240
the flow of information, because they're realizing that the internet has completely taken away

55
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,300
their power.

56
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:10,040
But while we're on the subject of old media, here's a tweet from Glad Day Bookshop in Toronto,

57
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:16,120
Canada, the oldest LGBTQ bookstore in the world, serving Toronto since 1970.

58
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:19,400
Language evolves, evolve yours, let's see this propaganda.

59
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:22,360
Instead of his or her, try theirs.

60
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:26,440
Somebody left their phone on the table in the library, I hope they come back for it.

61
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:33,880
See, I already say that, if I don't know a person's gender, I usually use the gender

62
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:39,200
non-specific plural word, theirs, and it's nothing to do with trans-aware this week,

63
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:42,040
it's just because it just seems grammatically correct, right?

64
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:45,280
And I certainly don't need a fucking flyer to tell me to do it.

65
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,880
Instead of guys, try folks.

66
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:50,480
All of you folks are one of them in this space.

67
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:54,880
What is it with SJWs using the word folk?

68
00:04:54,880 --> 00:05:01,680
Because I've always grown up thinking that folks is like a rednecky term, you know?

69
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:08,100
Like it's a situation where you have folk who sit on the front porch and stub their

70
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:13,980
banjo and that's the kind of feel I get from the word folk, but it's been used by SJWs

71
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:19,420
so much that now whenever I see folk I just think that somebody's probably a fucking regressive.

72
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:24,200
But no, I use guys as a gender neutral term now, and I think it's rapidly becoming the

73
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:27,580
gender neutral term for a group of people.

74
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:30,260
Maybe they don't like that, but fuck it.

75
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:35,420
Instead of the lady slash man in the red shirt, try the person in the red shirt.

76
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:39,340
I'd like to call upon the person in the red shirt to come join me on stage.

77
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:41,780
Um, why?

78
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:46,800
There's no reason to de-gender a signifier in most cases.

79
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:50,580
Of course there are going to be fringe cases where somebody looks like the gender they're

80
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:54,740
not and they get insulted by it and then you apologize and you say, listen, I'm sorry,

81
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:56,240
I didn't know.

82
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:02,780
But there's no reason to fucking police your own goddamn speech for the minority of cases.

83
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:05,380
Instead of men or women, try everyone.

84
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:08,420
These cozy winter outfits can be worn by everyone.

85
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:12,260
Well, what if it's, it's meant for a man or a woman?

86
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:17,140
I mean, if it's, if it's a cozy winter outfit, you do realize that men and women have different

87
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:19,600
cuts of clothing.

88
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:22,560
You know, it's not even just a fashion thing.

89
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:27,120
It's just that the clothing is cut differently because men have broader shoulders and women

90
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,580
have wider hips.

91
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:32,780
So sometimes clothing is actually made differently.

92
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:37,340
So no, maybe this cozy winter outfit can't be worn by everyone.

93
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:40,340
Maybe it can only be worn by women or by men.

94
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:44,780
There are many good reasons to want only one of the two genders to be involved in any kind

95
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:46,920
of particular situation.

96
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:49,820
Sometimes it's not appropriate for everyone to be there.

97
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:53,420
But yeah, they say language evolves, evolve yours.

98
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:57,940
Well that, that's the interesting thing is that in terms of guys and folks, language

99
00:06:57,940 --> 00:07:02,420
is evolving because guys at one point was not a gender neutral term and now it is.

100
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:03,580
So language is evolving.

101
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:07,300
You just don't like the way that it's, you just don't like the way that it's evolving.

102
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:09,860
So this isn't about language evolving.

103
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:11,180
This is about a power grab.

104
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:13,980
This is about you being able to police people's speech.

105
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:17,180
And in fact, you can see this case, let's scroll down a bit.

106
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:22,300
You got his or her or men and women is still being inclusive.

107
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:26,680
You're talking about sex instead of gender guys is non-gender specific.

108
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,380
No need to evolve language.

109
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:32,280
If you use it correctly, this is from geeks can be cool.

110
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:38,180
And of course this shop replies with, wow, it turns out geeks cannot in fact be cool.

111
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:40,120
Of course, of course.

112
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:45,200
This is one step away from complaining about anime avatars or, or being a gamer.

113
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:49,600
I'm bad about guys as a term for a group of folks, but I'm trying to get better.

114
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,980
Y'all is also a great word for this.

115
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:54,580
They're literally becoming red decks.

116
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:56,160
They're just red decks now.

117
00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:00,720
Let's keep sticking to Twitter though, because now we've got a thread from Mark Kern, otherwise

118
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,720
known as a grums.

119
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:06,920
For those of you who don't know, he worked on vanilla world of Warcraft back in the day.

120
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:12,840
And then he, after leaving blizzard, he went indie.

121
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:19,400
He was a big part of gamer gate and he, he also talks about politics, not just gaming

122
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:23,360
on his Twitter account, which is, you know, kind of the way things are going now, because

123
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:26,680
I definitely started as a, as an anime and games channel.

124
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:27,920
And now I talk about politics.

125
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:32,920
I think, I think gamer gate helped bring a lot of people who were previously apolitical

126
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:34,560
into the political sphere.

127
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:35,560
Okay.

128
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:40,920
Let's talk about how to beat Trump, specifically, how you can get me and millions of others

129
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:43,040
back to voting for Democrats.

130
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:47,320
Like I used to first, you have to want me back, stop being, but hurt that I voted for

131
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:51,180
Trump and stop trying to get me punched, fired, or thrown out of restaurants.

132
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:52,180
You need us back.

133
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:58,500
You want to beat Trump, stop pushing us into ditches.

134
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:00,060
You'll lose again.

135
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:02,500
Second, embrace free speech.

136
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:06,080
You used to, and it opened a lot of doors for progressive values because we were free

137
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:11,900
to express controversial ideas at the time like LGBTQ rights.

138
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:18,620
You would riot if speech was muzzled and rightly so stop shadow banning and deplatforming next

139
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:23,800
Stop campaigning on resist and impeach and have a real message again.

140
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:27,800
Hope was a powerful one for Obama and hooked me back then.

141
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:32,080
You need to find a positive message to rally around a great vision for the future.

142
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:36,300
Right now, your message is hate and fear and zero vision.

143
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:39,460
Next embrace middle America and our country again.

144
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:43,520
You have a vision for what America should be, but stop saying America and middle America

145
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:44,520
have to go.

146
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:47,000
Make America's everyone's home.

147
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Be welcoming.

148
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,140
Right now you just want to burn it all down, not a good look.

149
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:54,460
Fight for jobs for everyone, people want to work.

150
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:56,840
And stop fetishizing tech.

151
00:09:56,840 --> 00:10:02,680
Not everyone can be a web programmer and we need food and power and dirty jobs.

152
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:07,380
Value hard work and blue collar industries and help them too and hold their jobs in the

153
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:09,040
respect they are due.

154
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:10,040
Fight for them.

155
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:13,560
Finally, fight for equal rights and opportunity.

156
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:17,980
But please stop trying to force everyone to live your way.

157
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:23,080
Stop trying to criminalize every minor thing and get rid of political correctness.

158
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:26,960
Learn to laugh again and embrace comedy as figurative not literal.

159
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,760
Leave fiction alone.

160
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:33,120
It's about having a vision to build up America again instead of one focused on tearing it

161
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,120
down.

162
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:35,540
Evolve it, don't destroy it.

163
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:40,800
Campaigning on he and his base are evil nazis is just wrong and doesn't work.

164
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:44,580
A lot of us used to vote for you and share your values.

165
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:48,240
You don't have to do all this overnight, but just showing me and millions of others that

166
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:52,820
you're willing to move in his direction would do a lot to get me to take a second look.

167
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:54,280
Want to beat Trump?

168
00:10:54,280 --> 00:11:00,680
Take a page from your own speaking points and start to listen, for real.

169
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:05,460
Now if you didn't pay attention back on the first of July when this thread was initially

170
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:14,360
posted, Grums got into a lot of trouble for this because he basically outlined a list

171
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:18,020
of demands and they're all reasonable demands.

172
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:23,540
I think most centrists who voted for Trump would agree with this list of demands.

173
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:30,620
This list basically describes why the moral grandstanding of the left is not enough by

174
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:37,900
itself to get votes and how somebody like Trump, and frankly, Trump is far from the

175
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:43,940
perfect president, but how somebody like Trump was able to beat an establishment backed candidate

176
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:51,400
like Hillary with tons of money pouring into her, and it's because the middle of the country,

177
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:58,040
the rational centrists saw what happened between Hillary and Bernie and knew what Hillary was

178
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:00,800
and said, never Hillary.

179
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:06,640
We would rather have Trump just to fucking stick it to you guys who think that you can

180
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:11,580
rig elections with impunity, and that's what they did, and that's why we are where we are now.

181
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:17,280
You could obviously blame Trump for what Trump does if you don't like it, but the reason

182
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:23,800
we have Trump is basically because the Democrats became, and the left in general, has become

183
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:30,080
megalomaniacal with all of this shit and needed to be taken down a peg or two, or five, or ten.

184
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:36,000
And since Trump's election, there's been this constant meltdown, this unending salt mine

185
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:43,380
that's been uncovered on the left, and continuing to be salty is not the way to ensure that

186
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:50,060
you guys get elected in 2020, or in 2022, or in 2024, it's not gonna happen.

187
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:54,620
And in fact, a lot of the replies that Mark Curd got from the left show this.

188
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:56,300
Let me try and find them here.

189
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:58,780
Nobody owes you shit, asshole.

190
00:12:58,780 --> 00:13:03,740
If you're too dumb to make the right decision after what you've seen, you deserve what you get.

191
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:06,840
You're definitely earning your verified check mark today, buddy.

192
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:10,260
You could stop demanding the party court, you take a good long look at what's happening

193
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:14,600
in this country, and vote for the candidate who is better for the entire nation.

194
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:18,880
Not because your feelings and ego are being stroked, because it's the adult thing to do.

195
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:24,560
Oh, oh, it's the adult thing to do to vote the way that you want people to vote, right?

196
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:28,720
If people have differing political opinions from you, I guess you simply consider them

197
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,720
to be children, right?

198
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:35,320
Maybe that's why people are not going to vote the way that you want them to vote, because

199
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:36,780
you're an asshole.

200
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:41,640
You voted for Trump, seeing the danger, racism, and hostility to people of color.

201
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:43,220
You saw the blatant corruption.

202
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:44,220
The math is easy.

203
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:46,700
You're okay with racism, corruption, and fascism.

204
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:50,100
We won't be taking you out for an ice cream cone to get your vote.

205
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:51,860
The adults will handle this.

206
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:55,160
Do you honestly think that Hillary wasn't racist?

207
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:57,580
Do you honestly think that Hillary wasn't a war boggler?

208
00:13:57,580 --> 00:14:00,740
Do you honestly think that Hillary wasn't blatantly corrupt?

209
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:05,180
Do you honestly think that your side is acting like adults when you've been doing nothing

210
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:07,900
but melting down since 2016?

211
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:09,320
We don't want you back.

212
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:13,620
The fact that you voted for Trump and are seeing what he's doing and would consider

213
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:16,100
voting for him again is all we need to know about you.

214
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:18,220
Well, this is how you lose the election.

215
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:26,820
You can't simply assume that 50% of your population, possibly more, are idiots, are immoral, are

216
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:31,860
entirely without consideration because that 50% is going to come along and fucking destroy

217
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:32,860
you every time.

218
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:37,100
I mean, this guy even fucking links an article that is the exact thing I'm talking about.

219
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:38,580
The people are the problem.

220
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:41,100
No, the people are not the problem.

221
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:43,500
I can't believe you could even fucking think this.

222
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:48,380
Until you meet my demands, I will happily continue voting for Trump just to show you.

223
00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:52,940
This thread could not be any more disconnected from reality if it had read, I'll vote for

224
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:54,740
you if you get me a pet unicorn.

225
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:59,460
And then here's Marge at Large, and where did you get the idea that we want to woo you

226
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:00,460
back?

227
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:01,460
Voting is a personal choice.

228
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:02,460
You choose who you vote for.

229
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:04,020
I will choose who I vote for.

230
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:05,140
That's how it works.

231
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:09,000
If you choose to vote for corruption, lies, and bully tactics, that's on you.

232
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:13,100
Nothing you listed in this thread is a value of the Trump administration and you voted

233
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:16,440
for him anyway, so none of this is important to you.

234
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:20,020
You don't get special treatment because you can't wake up and be part of a solution to

235
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:22,460
heal this country.

236
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:26,820
All of these replies are exactly what he's talking about, and all of these people are

237
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:29,340
too fucking stupid to see it.

238
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:34,500
Also, they think that Mark Card's a white guy, he's Asian, but he's outlining a list

239
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:40,380
of reasonable things that a politician on either side of the aisle has to provide if

240
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:45,560
they're going to swing the centrist vote, and he's saying that the left is actively

241
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:51,780
refusing to provide any of these things, and instead is resorting to shame tactics in order

242
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:53,300
to try to get people to vote for them.

243
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:57,600
And in reply, all of these fucking replies are shame tactics.

244
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:03,340
And speaking of a mob of SJWs coming after somebody, I have this article here from July

245
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:07,940
14th, 2018 called, I was the mob until the mob came for me.

246
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:12,620
I drive food delivery for an online app to make rent and support myself and my young

247
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:13,620
family.

248
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:14,620
This is my new life.

249
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:19,900
I once had a well-paid job in what would be described as the social justice industry.

250
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:24,580
But I upset the wrong person, and within a short window of time, I was considered too

251
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:28,580
toxic for my employer's taste.

252
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:32,860
I was publicly shamed, mobbed, and reduced to a symbol of male privilege.

253
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:36,200
I was cast out of my career in my professional community.

254
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:40,460
Writing anything under my own byline now would invite a renewal of this mobbing, which is

255
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:44,300
why, with my editor's permission, I am writing this under a pseudonym.

256
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:45,620
He knows who I am.

257
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:50,900
Oh, it's almost like you now know what it felt like to be almost every single fucking

258
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:52,840
indie dev during gamergate.

259
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:58,020
It's almost like you now know what it feels like to be anybody who supports any right

260
00:16:58,020 --> 00:17:02,620
wing or even any centrist position on Twitter nowadays.

261
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:06,620
In my previous life, I was a self-righteous social justice crusader.

262
00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:11,060
I would use my mid-sized Twitter and Facebook platforms to signal my wokeness on topics

263
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:15,100
such as LGBT rights, rape culture, and racial injustice.

264
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:19,820
Most of the opinions I held then are still opinions that I hold today, but I now realize

265
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:25,460
that my social media hyperactivity was, in reality, doing more harm than good.

266
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:30,420
And based on the title, I presume it only took until The Mob Came After You for you

267
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:31,620
to figure this out.

268
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:36,620
Within the world created by the various apps I used, I got plenty of shares and retweets,

269
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:40,500
but this masked how ineffective I had become outside in the real world.

270
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:46,000
The only causes I was actually contributing to were the causes of mobbing and public shaming.

271
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,340
Real change does not stem from these tactics.

272
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:52,180
They only cause division, alienation, and bitterness.

273
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:57,740
This is pretty much the exact thing that happened to Mark Curd in the previous story, and this

274
00:17:57,740 --> 00:18:00,300
is an SJW finally fucking realizing it.

275
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:02,100
How did I become that person?

276
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:05,200
It happened because it was exhilarating.

277
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:09,500
Every time I would call someone racist or sexist, I would get a rush.

278
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:14,900
That rush would then be reaffirmed and sustained by the stars, hearts, and thumbs up that constitute

279
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:18,220
the nickels and dimes of social media validation.

280
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:22,260
The people giving me these stars, hearts, and thumbs up were engaging in their own cynical

281
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:23,260
game.

282
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:27,340
A fear of being targeted by the mob induces us to signal publicly that we are part of

283
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:28,340
it.

284
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:32,380
I forget how that old quote goes, but it was something like people enjoy performing and

285
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:37,960
then in turn having other people watch them perform rather than actually doing anything

286
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:39,360
of substance.

287
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:42,200
That is basically what social media has become.

288
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:46,320
It's just become a giant circle jerk where people pat other people on the back and think

289
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,920
that they're actually doing something about the world's ills.

290
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:53,620
I know I've talked about this before several times in various videos, but I've lost many

291
00:18:53,620 --> 00:18:58,480
friends to this cycle.

292
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:00,400
I talked about the d-pad in a few videos.

293
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:06,720
I talked about that girl Casey in a few videos, but there's been others too.

294
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,120
I'm going to go show you this right now.

295
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:11,400
I'm going to start what we're doing and just go show you this.

296
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,400
Here's Spoody's Twitter.

297
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:13,440
We all know who this guy is.

298
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:19,520
He's not really doing much of anything right now.

299
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:24,560
He's replaying Final Fantasy X and tweeting about it, a game that he's already made a

300
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:29,040
four-part review on instead of actually making new content.

301
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:32,360
He hates this game, so I don't know why he's doing it.

302
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:38,720
Maybe he thinks that his 12 social media likes are actually worth something.

303
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,980
Maybe that's his paycheck now.

304
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:42,320
But let's scroll down a bit, okay?

305
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:43,320
Let's scroll down a bit.

306
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:45,880
Takahata101 says, I have written jokes I regret.

307
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:47,520
I wish I could go back and not have made.

308
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:48,520
Part of growing up.

309
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:51,740
I have plenty of regrets about things like this and everyone knows I've said some pretty

310
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:52,740
shameful things.

311
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:55,400
I think your intent at the time is the most important thing to consider.

312
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:58,040
I doubt your goal was to hurt anyone or most people will understand that.

313
00:19:58,040 --> 00:19:59,040
Really, Spoody?

314
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:00,040
Is that the case?

315
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:05,360
During your Final Fantasy VIII review, you made an extended gay rant and you're now

316
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:09,080
very ashamed of it because you've gone full fucking SJW.

317
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:13,560
But alternatively, maybe you and your ilk shouldn't be digging through the fucking

318
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:19,620
Twitter feeds of people to find 10-year-old tweets if this is going to be your logic.

319
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:23,840
If back then you thought it was okay and you didn't actually mean to hurt anybody, if

320
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:27,800
back then that's the person that you were, then you should be left alone.

321
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:34,000
How many fucking people have SJWs ruined because of shit they said a decade ago?

322
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,200
I have plenty of regrets.

323
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,360
Cue Final Fantasy VIII review gay rant.

324
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:38,480
Yep, got it in one.

325
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:39,640
I have no excuse for that one.

326
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:41,280
I really don't know what I was thinking.

327
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:44,160
Well here's what you were thinking, Noah.

328
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:46,320
You were not an SJW at the time.

329
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:54,680
You were a mid-20s comedian on YouTube, a platform that hadn't really blown up yet and

330
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:57,440
you were one of the bigger people on it at the time.

331
00:20:57,480 --> 00:21:00,600
I mean, you're a fucking nobody at this point now, dude.

332
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:03,320
And man, I spent many years looking up to you.

333
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:08,440
And now you want to go back and like astroturf your more successful stuff to replace it with

334
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:09,440
what?

335
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:11,480
Because you're not fucking doing anything.

336
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:13,120
You're just sitting around.

337
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:15,000
You're tweeting about Trump all day.

338
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
And man, you want to talk about...

339
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,520
I guess I might as well just blow every old fucking friendship I had out of the water

340
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:20,520
this time.

341
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:25,020
But let's go to Black Light Attack.

342
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:32,540
Black Light Attack was important because he was the first YouTuber to do a Nuzlocke Let's

343
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:33,540
Play.

344
00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:40,100
Like a Nuzlocke run in Pokemon as a Let's Play, not just like a text thing or a comic.

345
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:44,120
And for a while, his playthrough was number one.

346
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:46,780
The number one search on YouTube for just Pokemon.

347
00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:49,020
You search Pokemon, you found his playthrough.

348
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:50,740
That's how big that he was.

349
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:54,340
And he invented 60 second Let's Plays.

350
00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:57,820
And he's done a lot of interesting things over the years.

351
00:21:57,820 --> 00:21:58,820
But here's what happened.

352
00:21:58,820 --> 00:22:01,180
He was a regular guy.

353
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:02,180
Look at him now.

354
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:03,220
Look at him now.

355
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:04,220
He was a regular guy.

356
00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:07,940
If I look it up, I mean, he wore a cringey fucking fedora.

357
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:12,900
But this was way back before fedoras had fallen out of style.

358
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:17,140
And he was a regular self depreciating guy.

359
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:18,140
Right?

360
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:20,660
And that's okay.

361
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:23,620
But then he became this.

362
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:26,940
He moved out to the West Coast, he got a job at Twitch TV.

363
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:30,420
As far as I know, he got fired from the job at Twitch.

364
00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:32,900
And then he went full SJW.

365
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:36,780
This is a guy that I used to love watching.

366
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:40,180
And I have a lot of respect for him because he's made some really good stuff.

367
00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:45,620
But after losing it at Twitch, he said he wanted to make it as a full time Twitch streamer

368
00:22:45,620 --> 00:22:46,880
and he barely streams.

369
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:48,340
He streams once a month.

370
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:53,540
And then his Twitter feed is about social justice issues and talking about fucking

371
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:54,540
Trump.

372
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:58,340
And instead of streaming, he just spends his time talking about social justice and Trump.

373
00:22:58,340 --> 00:23:00,100
And that's what his entire Twitter feed is.

374
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:02,060
He's basically gone the way of spoonie.

375
00:23:02,060 --> 00:23:08,220
And this really sucks because these are people that I used to like and I was friends with

376
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:10,060
and I respect.

377
00:23:10,060 --> 00:23:12,860
And then you look at this article, right?

378
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:14,060
We're back to the article.

379
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:16,360
I was the mob until the mob came for me.

380
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:18,380
This is the process of how that happens.

381
00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:19,380
All right?

382
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:26,860
Most people who are usually good people, they get sucked into this shit, okay?

383
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:30,460
Most people in the SJW community, they're not bad people.

384
00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:32,120
They've just been manipulated and sucked in.

385
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:35,480
And then they're kind of stuck there for a while, right?

386
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:39,520
It's really only like the cult leaders that are actually the legitimately bad people.

387
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:41,140
They have agendas.

388
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:45,480
What's happening is that you have good people who are apolitical and they don't really know

389
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:46,800
how politics works.

390
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:50,400
And they see the world and they say, how can we fix this?

391
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,840
And then the SJWs have the loudest voice right now.

392
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:55,320
So they show up and they say, here's how we fix it.

393
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:59,600
And then they get drawn in because they think, oh, well, maybe I can do my part to help make

394
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:01,360
other people's lives better.

395
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:02,780
That is what most of these people think.

396
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:04,440
They think they're doing something good.

397
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:08,100
And then as soon as they realize that they're not doing something good, they're sucked in

398
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:09,100
too far.

399
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:13,320
And either they're threatened by their friend group or they're threatened by other people

400
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:16,160
or they've built up an entire life around this shit.

401
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:23,160
It becomes too painful or too hard to rip it all down because it means destroying a

402
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:28,000
good chunk of their sense of self and the way they live their life.

403
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
And they get stuck there.

404
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,040
I'm sorry about that side rant, guys.

405
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:33,180
That was just me going off the rails a little bit.

406
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:34,820
I apologize.

407
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:39,780
Just a few years ago, many of my friends and peers who self-identify as liberals or progressives

408
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:45,560
were open fans of provocative standup comedians, such as Sarah Silverman and shows like South

409
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:46,560
Park.

410
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:52,600
Today, such material is seen as deeply problematic or even labeled as hate speech.

411
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:58,460
I went from minding my own business when people told risque jokes to practically fainting

412
00:24:58,460 --> 00:25:03,240
when they use the wrong pronoun or express or expressed a right of center view.

413
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:08,360
I went from making fun of the guy who took edgy jokes too seriously to becoming that

414
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:09,360
guy.

415
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:12,460
This is exactly what has happened to a lot of my old friends.

416
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:16,800
And I've lost a lot of people to this stuff.

417
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:18,320
And there are times when it just feels bad.

418
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:24,560
I think, hey, maybe I should go back and call that person up or email them or message them

419
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:28,040
or tweet them or something and see how they are.

420
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:34,840
And nine times out of 10, because I'm a political centrist, they would hate me now.

421
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:37,800
And often when I contact them, they say, oh, you hang out with Sargon.

422
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:38,800
I hate you.

423
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:43,400
When my call outs were met with approval and admiration, I was lavished with praise.

424
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:45,020
Thank you so much for speaking out.

425
00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:46,020
You're so brave.

426
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:48,320
We need more men like you.

427
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:52,100
Then one day suddenly I was accused of some of the very transgressions I'd called out

428
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:53,100
in others.

429
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:54,820
I was guilty, of course.

430
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:57,500
There's no such thing as due process in the world.

431
00:25:57,500 --> 00:26:01,100
And once judgment has been rendered against you, the mob starts combing through your past

432
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:05,580
looking for similar transgressions that might have been missed at the time.

433
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:10,000
I was now told that I had been creating a toxic environment for years at my workplace

434
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:14,960
that had been making the space around me unsafe through microaggressions and macroaggressions

435
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:15,960
alike.

436
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:19,880
Well, you, you do reap what you sow in the end, don't you?

437
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:23,720
Social justice is a surveillance culture, a snitch culture.

438
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:28,200
The constant vigilance on the part of my colleagues and friends did be in.

439
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:30,600
That's why I'm delivering sushi and pizza.

440
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:34,960
Not that I'm complaining, it's honest work and it's led me to rediscover how to interact

441
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:36,740
with people in the real world.

442
00:26:36,740 --> 00:26:42,660
I am a kinder and more respectful person now that I'm not regularly on social media attacking

443
00:26:42,660 --> 00:26:45,380
people for not being kind and respectful.

444
00:26:45,380 --> 00:26:47,100
Let that be the message.

445
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:51,700
If there's any SJW who happens to be watching this and you're just thinking of a complete

446
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:53,140
fucking retard.

447
00:26:53,140 --> 00:26:58,460
Let this paragraph be the only thing that actually penetrates your goddamn skull.

448
00:26:58,460 --> 00:27:02,280
This is what you are and maybe this is why you hate honest work.

449
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:04,660
Maybe this is why you hate blue collar industries.

450
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:09,000
This is why you hate the Midwest or, or your hometown.

451
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:13,600
Maybe it's because you realize that actually being exposed to the real fucking world and

452
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:20,040
actually talking to people is the one thing over anything else that will emotionally destroy

453
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:24,400
the social justice particles that have grown over every single SJW.

454
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:30,300
I mobbed and shamed people for incidents that became front page news, but when they were

455
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:35,800
vindicated or exonerated by some real world investigation, it was treated as a footnote

456
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:37,940
by my online community.

457
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:42,000
If someone survives a social justice call out, it simply means that the mob has moved

458
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,760
on to someone new.

459
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:48,600
No one ever apologizes for a false accusation and everyone has a selective memory regarding

460
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:49,660
what they've done.

461
00:27:49,660 --> 00:27:53,780
This honestly sounds a lot like what Zoe Quinn said gamergate was, but it turns out that

462
00:27:53,780 --> 00:27:57,000
Zoe Quinn actively takes part in shit like this.

463
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:02,400
Upon reading Jon Ronson's 2015 book, So You've Been Publicly Shamed, I recently went back

464
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:05,080
into my Twitter archives to study my own behavior.

465
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:09,460
I was shocked to discover that I'd actually participate quite enthusiastically in the

466
00:28:09,460 --> 00:28:16,500
public shaming of Justine Sacco, whose 2013 saga following a bad AIDS joke on Twitter

467
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:19,740
forms one of the book's central case studies.

468
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:21,720
My memory had told me different.

469
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:23,940
In my mind, I didn't really participate.

470
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:26,520
It was others who took things too far.

471
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:31,040
In reality, the evidence showed that I was among the most vicious of Sacco's mobbers.

472
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:34,240
Ronson describes a central problem with Twitter shaming.

473
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:38,000
There is a disconnect between the severity of the crime and the gleeful savagery of the

474
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,000
punishment.

475
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:43,020
For years, I was blind to my own gleeful savagery.

476
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:48,300
I'm sure we all have things that we did when we were young that we're not proud of.

477
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:53,960
Social media allows us to go back and actually see those things without any alteration because

478
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:59,400
I can think of times when I was a kid that I did something pretty terrible and there

479
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:00,480
was no internet.

480
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:07,080
So for me, it's just remembering things and being ashamed of them inside my own head.

481
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:10,400
But now with Twitter, you can actually go back and see it.

482
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:14,720
I recently had a dream that played out in the cartoon universe of my food delivery app,

483
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:17,540
the dashboard software that guides my daily work life.

484
00:29:17,540 --> 00:29:22,800
The dream turned my workday drive into a third person video game with my cartoon car standing

485
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:24,800
naked for me as a protagonist.

486
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:27,840
At some point, I started missing some of the streets and the little line that marks my

487
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:30,880
trail with blue pixels indicated where I had gone off road.

488
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:34,840
My path got erratic and the dream became otherworldly as dreams eventually do.

489
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:39,200
I drove over cartoon sidewalks, through cartoon buildings and cartoon parks.

490
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:42,320
It's a two dimensional world and the apps, everything was flat.

491
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:45,840
Through the unique logic of dreams, I survived all this all while picking up and dropping

492
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:47,400
off deliveries and making money.

493
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:50,000
In my dream, I was making progress.

494
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:53,400
As my REM cycle intensified, my dream concluded.

495
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:57,520
I was jolted from my two dimensional app world and thrust back into the reality of the living

496
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:58,520
world.

497
00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:02,520
Where I could understand the suffering, carnage and death I would have caused by my in app

498
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:03,920
actions.

499
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:08,160
There were bodies strewn across along the street, screaming bystanders, destroyed lives,

500
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:09,160
chaos.

501
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:11,960
My car by contrast was indestructible while I was living in the app.

502
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:14,880
Okay, this is a dream, man.

503
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:15,880
You're fine.

504
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:19,720
The social justice vigilantism I was living on Twitter and Facebook was like the app in

505
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:21,080
my dream.

506
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:24,560
Aggressive online virtue signaling is a fundamentally two dimensional act.

507
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:25,740
It has no human depth.

508
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:29,700
It's only when we snap out of it, see the world as it really is and people as they really

509
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:34,040
are, that we can appreciate that a structure of human suffering we caused when we were

510
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:35,480
trapped inside.

511
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:39,600
Of course, the analogy rings true, even though we can kind of tell that this guy did used

512
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:42,360
to be an SJW writer.

513
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:46,400
This sounds like something that Nathan Grayson would have written on Kotaku or something

514
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:47,840
stupid, right?

515
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:53,520
But at least this time, he's actually talking about something that makes a modicum of sense.

516
00:30:53,520 --> 00:31:00,800
People have jokingly made SJW comparisons to the Borg or to zombies over the years.

517
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:03,200
And I think that they're quite frankly right.

518
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:05,760
These people get sucked into these groups.

519
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:09,960
And then they kind of get it's a little bit shaming.

520
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:11,600
It's a little bit of a power rush.

521
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:17,000
It's a little bit being chastised and then having the ability to chastise others.

522
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:22,880
There's a definite power structure to it and a constant checking and rechecking of

523
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:27,360
everyone around you and having yourself checked by everybody around you as well.

524
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:29,840
And these people, they get stuck in it.

525
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:32,720
Fifty percent of it is that they're scared to leave.

526
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:39,720
And fifty percent of it is that they enjoy the power rush of temporarily being the Inquisitor

527
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:42,920
when it's not their turn to be labeled the oppressor.

528
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:45,840
And that's why you get a lot of decent people who get sucked into this stuff.

529
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:51,960
That's why you can see creators who made amazing things eight or ten years ago, like

530
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:58,320
Spooty, like Black Light Attack, like so many other people, they vanish into this fucking

531
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:04,240
black hole, this interdimensional pit of fucking emotional nothingness.

532
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:08,880
It's not just that these SJWs hurt other people, though they do.

533
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:10,560
They also hurt themselves.

534
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:14,280
When is the last time you've actually found a happy SJW?

535
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:23,080
A SJW who is actually happy with their body or their life or their relationships or something.

536
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:27,400
How many of them have good relationships with their families or with their parents?

537
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:31,960
I mean, of course, there are definitely many instances where you should not have a relationship

538
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:34,960
with your parents because you have legitimately abusive parents.

539
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:36,680
I know people who are like that.

540
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:41,740
However, there's so many times when I hear about people who don't like their parents

541
00:32:41,740 --> 00:32:45,660
and it's simply because it's their parents and they don't like authority and they still

542
00:32:45,660 --> 00:32:50,380
can't get over that when they were eight or nine, they got spanked because they did something

543
00:32:50,380 --> 00:32:52,500
horrendously awful as a kid.

544
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:58,740
And now they're 30 or they're 35 and they're still like, you know, fuck the man.

545
00:32:58,740 --> 00:33:04,500
How many fat activists do you think actually like their body or are actually healthy or

546
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:06,580
happy at any size?

547
00:33:06,580 --> 00:33:10,840
How much of that shit do you think is just them participating in a grand illusion and

548
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:16,600
demanding the rest of society also prop up this grand illusion along with them just

549
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:21,400
so that they don't have to confront the fact that they eat too much and they don't do enough

550
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:22,400
exercise.

551
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:28,840
This is mainly why I've gone from hating SJWs to feeling immensely sorry for them.

552
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:30,760
They might cause sub-damage to other people.

553
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:32,640
There might be online mobs.

554
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:34,760
There might be other things like that.

555
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:40,120
There might be, you know, they might take over shows like She-Racks, ThunderCats, and

556
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:44,620
they might ruin comics or Magic the Gathering or video games.

557
00:33:44,620 --> 00:33:48,160
There's a lot of things that they do that are terrible that affect other people, but

558
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:51,700
it's all because they hate themselves.

559
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:55,360
They don't have any happiness in their lives.

560
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:57,720
And that's the core of it.

561
00:33:57,720 --> 00:34:01,560
This is what this person who wrote this article has finally realized.

562
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:06,560
I've been thinking of a video topic now for at least six months, maybe longer.

563
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:14,320
It's supposed to be like a self-help for SJWs.

564
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:20,640
Things have only gotten worse regarding this stuff, both in terms of SJWs in general and

565
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:25,360
also on a personal level with me.

566
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:29,640
I might make that the next video I do because I think it's actually important.
