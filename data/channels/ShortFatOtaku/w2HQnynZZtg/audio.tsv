0	8400	Hey, this will be a less complicated video than usual.
8400	12620	I just wanted to put pen to paper, well, keyboard to text file, on some ideas I've been thinking
12620	13620	about recently.
13620	16780	Yeah, I know I promised that the video was going to come out first, but what can I say?
16780	18920	I'm currently addicted to Project Zomboid.
18920	23420	November 20th was the Transgender Day of Remembrance, where we're supposed to remember the tragic
23420	25100	deaths of trans people.
25100	28960	The White House Press Secretary gave us a hard number of this year's trans victims
28960	53680	in the United States.
53680	54680	Yeah 26.
54680	60680	In a nation of 330 million people, where approximately 1% of them are trans, 26 of
60680	61680	them were murder victims.
61680	67680	That's a murder rate of 0.00007%.
67680	72640	Considering that in 2022 there were approximately 21,000 homicide cases in the States, with
72640	77120	that 330 million population, the napkin math comes out to the general murder rate of America
77120	80640	being, I think, 0.006%.
80640	84760	These are both incredibly tiny, so literally who cares, but trans people do seem to have
84760	87120	a much smaller chance of being murdered.
87120	91520	Rachel Richards, a conservative trans YouTuber, wrote a video titled, Who's Killing Black
91520	92840	Transgender Woman?
92840	98620	In it, she points out that black trans women comprise 66% of the 202 cases of fatal violence
98620	102460	against trans people in the United States from 2013 to 2020.
102460	108420	The article she quotes ties the surge of black trans victimization to the rise of white supremacy
108420	110180	and the far right in America.
110220	114700	When Rachel digs up the individual cases and discovers, the vast majority of the murderers
114700	117900	of these black trans women are actually black men.
117900	122520	All that being said, the Williams Institute did state that trans people are four times
122520	127560	more likely than cis people to experience violent victimization not including murder,
127560	130260	like rape, sexual assault, or aggravated assault.
130260	137780	The numbers are 86.2 trans victimizations per 1,000 people versus 21.7 cis victimizations.
137780	141060	So is there an epidemic of trans murders in the States?
141060	142060	No.
142060	145380	But you can certainly make the claim that trans people are more likely to be the victims
145380	148160	of other types of crime, especially sexual crime.
148160	151040	The statistics for why this is the case aren't exactly clear.
151040	154940	If I personally had to guess, it would likely be a combination of multiple factors.
154940	155940	1.
155940	159420	Sexual assault and power Oftentimes, sexual assaulters use positions
159420	164060	of power to prey on their victims, whether that be teacher over student, boss over employee,
164060	167760	police officer over criminal, or medical professional over patient.
167760	171520	Trans people may simply be seen as easy targets due to their marginalization, or they may
171520	174720	be fetishized as targets due to their unique sexual status.
174720	175720	2.
175720	178880	The majority of sexual violence happens within romantic relationships.
178880	183060	As a general rule, the chance of violence in a relationship goes up the more outside
183060	185080	the norm that relationship is.
185080	188800	Interracial relationships tend to see a heightened level of violence.
188800	190120	Lesbian relationships as well.
190120	192260	Both sexual and non-sexual violence.
192260	194680	It wouldn't surprise me if it were the same with trans people.
194680	195680	3.
195680	199520	The disproportionate number of trans women per capita work in sex work, either pornography
199520	203800	or prostitution, both of which are jobs that are rife with sexual violence.
203800	208700	The transgender day of remembrance is actually less about trans murder victims, despite its
208700	212120	official definition, and more about blanket trans deaths.
212120	217360	Yes, it was founded in 1999 as a memorial to the deaths of specific black trans women
217360	221920	who were murdered, but definitions shift over time, and looking at how the holiday is colloquially
221920	225000	spoken about on social media bears this out.
225000	229120	Trans suicide is also far more likely to be a source of trans death than trans violence
229120	230120	is.
230120	232340	41% is a meme number for a reason.
232340	236800	It comes from a 2012 report called the National Transgender Discrimination Survey, which claimed
236800	242440	that 41% of the 6,450 trans people who were interviewed attempted to kill themselves at
242440	244300	some point in their lives.
244300	247800	Suicide seems to be the greatest risk that the trans population faces, more than violence,
247800	252080	which is why most common discussions of the trans day of remembrance quietly slip suicide
252080	253400	in with violence.
253400	255900	I'm laying all of this out to make a specific point.
255900	260640	The moral underpinning of trans activism is primarily in suicide prevention.
260640	261640	Here's the logic.
261640	266120	Look at this post on the LGBT subreddit that is pretty popular, titled, For anyone thinking
266120	269880	transgender genocide isn't happening or that it won't be that bad should the Republicans
269880	271140	gain more power.
271140	274640	The trans genocide rhetoric from progressives has been pretty popular.
274640	279200	Every move against trans activism is labeled genocidal, and the people who make these claims
279200	282100	do believe that a genocide is currently in progress.
282100	286260	When pressed on this, they usually refer to the ten stages of genocide.
286260	290500	The ten stages of genocide is a theory developed by progressive Gregory Stanton, working in
290500	293640	genocide studies at George Mason University.
293640	298020	He developed the framework after the Rwandan genocide, and it reads as follows.
298020	299760	Stage one, classification.
299760	302000	People are divided into them and us.
302000	303600	Stage two, symbolization.
303600	308320	When combined with hatred, symbols may be forced upon unwilling members of prior groups.
308320	310140	Stage three, discrimination.
310140	313820	Laws or cultural power excludes groups from full civil rights.
313820	316740	Segregation or apartheid laws denial of voting rights.
316740	318620	Stage four, dehumanization.
318620	321140	One group denies the humanity of the other group.
321140	325000	Members of it are equated with animals, vermin, insects, or diseases.
325000	327060	Stage five, organization.
327060	328740	Genocide is always organized.
328740	332060	Special army units or militias are trained and armed.
332060	334140	Stage six, polarization.
334140	335600	Extremists drive the groups apart.
335600	337340	Leaders are arrested and murdered.
337340	340220	Laws erode fundamental civil rights and liberties.
340220	341900	Stage seven, preparation.
341900	343560	Mass killing is planned.
343560	347020	Victims are identified and separated because of their ethnic or religious identity.
347020	352540	Stage eight, persecution, expropriation, forced displacement, ghettos, concentration camps.
352540	354340	Stage nine, extermination.
354340	357660	It's extermination to the killers because they do not believe their victims to be fully
357660	358660	human.
358660	360040	Stage ten, denial.
360040	362440	The perpetrators deny they've committed any crimes.
362440	365440	I can see how this framework can have some use in an academic setting.
365440	369360	For example, in the study of actual genocides, which is what Professor Stanton did for his
369360	370360	whole career.
370360	374420	But nowadays, his framework is misused colloquially for political points.
374420	378020	I've seen multiple breadtubers, the biggest being Hassan and Vashj.
378020	381000	Why does it always have to be those two, who have pushed the idea that according to the
381000	386320	official academic definition of genocide supported by the United Nations, a stage four trans-genocide
386320	387480	is currently underway?
387480	389320	Remember, stage four is dehumanization.
389320	391900	The stage where one group denies the humanity of the other group.
391900	396480	While it's true that there are absolutely some insane anti-trans people out there denying
396480	399520	the humanity of trans people, does that mean it's a genocide?
399520	404160	This seems like a wild misuse of the framework in order to score cheap political points.
404160	406860	Apply this standard to anything else and you'll see what I mean.
406860	408840	Are Trump supporters being genocided?
408840	411760	I mean, it's not hard to find progressives dehumanizing them.
411760	413520	So I guess we're already on stage four, guys.
413520	417440	Hell, I'm sure from the Trump supporters' point of view, we're on a stage six genocide
417440	420020	where Trump supporting groups are being driven apart.
420020	422480	Reporters are being arrested, including Trump himself.
422480	426740	Laws are being passed and judges are handing down rulings restricting the freedoms of Trump
426740	427740	supporters.
427740	430560	It's obvious that Trump supporters aren't actually being genocided.
430560	434120	It's also obvious that trans people aren't actually being genocided either.
434120	437840	What's actually going on here is that the word genocide contains a lot of emotional
437840	442080	weight, and dishonest people want to harness that weight for political ends.
442080	446620	Are non-citizen residents of every liberal country currently experiencing a stage three
446620	449380	genocide because they can't vote like citizens can?
449380	454040	Is admitting that two different groups exist a stage one genocide because it's us and
454040	455040	them?
455040	456900	Do socialists want to genocide the bourgeois?
456900	461120	Why is this framework suddenly absent in every progressive discussion regarding what Hamas
461120	462600	wants to do to Jewish people?
462600	466400	Oh, also, when those BreadTubers before claimed that the 10 stages were from the UN, that's
466400	467440	actually false.
467440	471860	The UN Genocide Convention only covers the destruction of a national, ethnic, racial,
471860	473000	or religious group.
473000	476520	It doesn't cover political groups or what is colloquially known as cultural genocide.
476520	480340	This is why, for example, when Germany was denazified, it wasn't genocide.
480340	483780	By the way, I'm not saying I agree with the anti-trans laws coming into effect in
483780	484780	the United States.
484780	486220	A lot of them I don't actually agree with at all.
486220	487940	But I'm pointing out something specific here.
487940	489980	Let's return to that Reddit post.
489980	491780	Genocide doesn't just happen through direct killing.
491780	493700	This will cause deaths, and many of them.
493700	496940	Just because they aren't lining people up in front of firing squads or gassing groups
496940	500820	of people to death doesn't mean they would not be 100% responsible for lives lost.
500820	504680	Suicide, fatal hate crimes, discrimination in work and housing, or increased mental health
504680	508660	issues, causing loss of ability to function or support yourself, sudden and prolonged
508660	510500	deaths from stress, grief, and terror.
510500	512260	Remember what I said earlier?
512260	516860	The moral underpinning of trans activism is primarily in suicide prevention.
516860	520660	Even if you don't kill people yourself, if you make their lives so unbearable that
520660	524200	they kill themselves, I think it's reasonable to say that you've got blood in your hands.
524200	527680	While it's still their choice to kill themselves, and they shouldn't do it, you're not blameless
527680	528680	either.
528680	532180	Take this, combine it with the fact that trans people are at an elevated risk of suicide,
532180	536720	the 41% meme, and you've now laid out the moral foundation for trans activism.
536720	541280	The phrase literally killing trans people became a meme after trans activists used it
541280	544800	like crazy online, culminating with JK Rowling making fun of it.
544800	546380	But here's the logic behind it.
546380	550640	Suffering from gender dysphoria causes, among many other things, suicidal thoughts.
550640	553800	Therefore, alleviating gender dysphoria is preventing suicide.
553800	557640	If transitioning alleviates dysphoria, then transitioning prevents suicide.
557640	561600	If you prevent dysphoric people from transitioning, then you're creating the conditions for
562020	565900	dysphoric people to suffer from suicidal thoughts, literally killing them by forcing on them
565900	568500	the conditions that lead them to kill themselves.
568500	573500	This effect is so serious, so deadly, that any action that non-trans people commit that
573500	578340	might increase dysphoria for a trans person is literally killing them, because more dysphoria
578340	579980	means more suicides.
579980	584500	That's why we've seen such a huge push towards, for example, the abolition of sex-segregated
584500	585500	spaces.
585500	588900	Because a trans person who is refused into the sex-segregated space of their choice might
588900	592980	have their dysphoria increased due to the exclusion, it's why we've seen a massive
592980	597120	push for the adoption of progressive morality surrounding pronoun use, declaring their pronouns
597120	601200	ahead of time, using specific types of pronouns, punishing those people who don't comply,
601200	604560	in order to reduce dysphoria and therefore reduce suicide.
604560	609960	You even see extremely weird, niche shit, like people removing mirrors from public spaces
609960	613840	in order to reduce dysphoria, because trans people might see themselves at a bad angle
613840	615660	and notice they don't pass or something.
615660	620200	Or the removal of all gendered language, leading to things like people with uteruses,
620200	624100	or birthing people, or bonus hole-havers, or all that other nonsense.
624100	629320	Or demanding that misgendering or deadnaming be the equivalent of hurling racial slurs.
629320	633520	The urgency underpinning all of this is preventing suicide, preventing death.
633520	637600	And if you're a decent person, you know, you should want to prevent suicide, of course.
637600	641360	However, if you're a reasonable person, you also recognize that there's a limit to this
641360	642360	principle.
642360	645940	For example, let's say I were sexually violated as a child with a cucumber.
645940	646940	I wasn't, by the way.
646940	650420	But let's assume that it was so traumatic that every time I saw a cucumber, it caused
650420	655400	me extreme feelings of distress, to the point that I became suicidal every time.
655400	657200	Should I be mocked for my issue?
657200	658200	Of course not.
658200	662620	But should I be able to demand that the entirety of society bend to meet my needs, that all
662620	666700	cucumbers be removed from public sale, so that I don't ever have to experience one whenever
666700	667900	I go outside?
667900	668900	Of course not.
668900	672720	We can have sympathy for those with special needs, and we can accommodate them in some
672720	675400	ways, but there must be a limit to that accommodation.
675400	678520	And this is the core of what I want you to consider today.
678520	680960	Special needs is the correct way to discuss trans activism.
680960	683480	No, I don't mean that as an insult, though it's kind of funny.
683480	688520	The way trans activism positions itself, the way it behaves, is like disability activism.
688520	692100	Due to an unfortunate circumstance, there is an identifiable group of people who suffer
692100	696720	from a unique medical condition that makes their ability to engage with society harder.
696720	701740	We therefore have a moral obligation to secure their rights as individuals wherever possible.
701740	705420	For example, when we build a wheelchair ramp going into a store, we recognize that people
705420	707660	in wheelchairs can't access that space.
707660	711580	There's no reason they shouldn't be able to shop in the store, so we have a moral obligation
711580	713180	to equalize access.
713180	715460	But we also recognize the limits on this principle.
715460	718340	A wheelchair-bound man will never play in the NBA.
718340	722420	There can be other sports leagues for wheelchair-bound people to enjoy, but we don't demand the
722420	724240	NBA accommodate him.
724240	727580	The trans activist's demand for access functions in a similar way.
727580	731380	When a trans activist says, for example, that trans women should be able to play in women's
731380	735820	sports, we can recognize the need for an equality of access that doesn't increase dysphoria
735820	737860	and therefore doesn't drive up suicide rates.
737860	742140	But we also recognize that the practical advantage that male puberty grants to an athlete is
742140	746220	extreme, and unless a trans woman began their transition when puberty began, like at 12
746220	751340	years old or whatever, the integrity of professional-level sports is destroyed by allowing trans women
751340	752540	to compete in them.
752540	754080	Here's the issue, though.
754080	758760	Because all of the moral urgency that drives trans activism is based in suicide prevention,
758760	763840	all of its demands must be fundamentally medical in nature, making it like disability activism.
763840	768440	However, unlike disability activism, when you begin that negotiation process of what
768440	772960	is reasonable versus unreasonable accommodation, like how it's reasonable to build a ramp
772960	777640	to access a store versus it's unreasonable to put a wheelchair-bound man in the NBA,
777640	782220	when that negotiation process happens for trans activism, trans activists stop acting
782220	787120	like their activism is like disability activism, they stop talking about their medical needs.
787120	790760	Instead, their activism morphs into something very different.
790760	794760	Gay rights activism is a type of progressive activism fundamentally different from disability
794760	795760	activism.
795760	799740	It's not a medical activist movement, it's a lifestyle activist movement.
799740	802600	Where disability activists claim that they are different from the norm and need special
802600	806400	treatment to be equal, lifestyle activists claim that they're the same as the norm,
806400	809160	and treating them differently is therefore unjust.
809160	811280	This is the logic behind gay marriage.
811280	812540	These are just like straights.
812540	815380	Why can't they enjoy marriage rights just like the straights do?
815380	819220	And fair enough, even if gay people do tend to get married less now that they've got
819220	822920	those rights, should we prevent those gay people who actually do want to get married
822920	823920	from doing so?
823920	824920	Of course not.
824920	829420	The moral underpinning of gay rights activism isn't suicide prevention the same way it
829420	830420	is for trans activism.
830420	833620	That's not to say that gay people don't kill themselves at higher rates than straight
833620	834620	people, they certainly do.
834620	836420	But it's not the focus of gay rights activism.
836420	840980	The focus has always been alternative lifestyles are valid and should not be suppressed by
840980	841980	the law.
841980	845640	To refer back to Haidt's moral foundations, it's a question of liberty and oppression,
845640	847280	not care and harm.
847280	851240	Lifestyle activist movements don't need to do the same negotiation with larger society
851240	853280	that medical activist movements do.
853280	857220	There is actually a serious cost to implementing disability rights, somebody's gotta build
857220	861160	that ramp, and that cost doesn't exist with gay rights.
861160	866000	Securing gay rights is 99% leaving people alone and 1% allowing gay couples to file
866000	868460	paperwork that straight couples can already file.
868460	872240	When trans activists talk about how serious their work is, when they talk about suffering
872240	875620	from dysphoria and the suicide rates, they're making a medical claim.
875620	879760	Their activism is like disability activism, where we have a moral obligation to change
879760	881120	things to prevent their suffering.
881120	884720	But when it comes time to negotiate those changes, understanding that there are other
884720	888720	non-trans people whose points of view also need to be considered, the language of the
888720	890420	trans activist suddenly shifts.
890420	894480	Now it's not about dysphoria and suicides anymore, now it's like gay activism.
894480	895720	Now it's a lifestyle.
895720	898060	Who are you to decide what trans people can and can't do?
898060	899520	Who are you to judge my life?
899520	901700	Who are you to say who is and isn't trans?
901700	905800	Anyone can be trans, you don't need dysphoria to be trans, it's all just self-ID, you
905800	910900	just are trans like gay people are just gay, you're oppressing us by questioning us.
910900	913740	This is the motte and bailey of trans activism.
913740	917360	Trans activists bring in all of the moral weight of the plight of trans people, the
917360	922080	suffering, the suicides, and demand large accommodations equivalent to that plight.
922080	925740	But when the costs of that accommodation need to be discussed, they switch track to the
925740	929560	language of gay activism, which has a much smaller associated cost.
929560	933640	Here's two very clear examples of what I mean, when you talk about banning trans women
933640	937860	from women's sports, or from women's bathrooms, or locker rooms, trans activism is framed
937860	940580	as if it is medical, it's like disability activism.
940580	944700	Being trans is an unfortunate incurable medical condition that needs to be accommodated in
944700	946340	order to prevent their suicide.
946340	950380	When you talk about, oh I don't know, a hypothetical medical procedure that cures
950380	955320	gender dysphoria without transitioning, trans activism is suddenly like gay activism, it's
955320	958900	a lifestyle you bigot, you're trying to cure something that isn't medical at all
958900	962280	but is just an alternative way of living that causes nobody any harm.
962280	966200	Trans activists switch between these two positions depending on which interpretation serves them
966200	969280	in the moment, but they are mutually exclusive.
969280	973340	Either being trans is an alternative way of living that causes no harm and people should
973340	978700	be left alone to do it, or it's so incredibly serious that the entirety of society must
978700	981760	be changed to accommodate them to prevent further harm.
981760	983540	But it can't be both of these things.
983540	988980	This is partially why, I think, the LGB splitting from the T thing is slowly gaining ground.
988980	992520	People are recognizing that what is necessary to include people with alternative sexual
992520	996500	interests is very different than what is necessary to include people with gender dysphoria, as
996500	999820	well as people who don't have dysphoria at all, but claim to be trans anyway.
999820	1004340	As more and more people have slowly recognized this motte and bailey, LGBT acceptance has
1004340	1008660	trended downward for the first time in a long time, mainly due to the T acting as a boat
1008660	1010240	anchor for the rest of it.
1010240	1014360	Trans activists have responded by claiming that people who oppose or question their activism
1014360	1018980	are simply transphobic, bigoted, racist, Trump-voting pieces of shit, that the pushback they receive
1018980	1022480	justifies their radicalism, and they have continued to further dig the hole they find
1022480	1023480	themselves in.
1023480	1027900	When people stopped reacting to being called transphobic, they switched to transgenocider.
1027900	1030940	Even that's become a tired cry now, so I have no idea what they're going to slander people
1030940	1031940	with next.
1031940	1035560	I also have no idea what they're going to say if a real transgenocide actually comes
1035560	1036560	along.
1036560	1040320	I'm wondering they've abused these terms so much, all the moral weight has been stripped
1040320	1041320	from them.
1041320	1045800	What I do know is, many trans people who I've spoken to do not approve of this shit.
1045800	1047960	They don't want to play in women's sports at the professional level.
1047960	1051500	They don't want to walk into a change room and wiggle their cocks at little girls present.
1051500	1055440	They want to take their hormones and have normal careers and spend time with their friends,
1055440	1059960	and enter into consensual relationships with other adults, and be left alone to enjoy their
1059960	1065680	private lives as their natural inclinations demand, which is a completely reasonable request.
1065680	1069840	They understand they're not the norm, and they want to actually be a part of that social
1069840	1074040	negotiation that allows them to lead a good life in society.
1074040	1078360	It might be the reactionary right wing pushing anti-trans laws right now, and to the extent
1078360	1080800	that those laws are bad, we should oppose them.
1080800	1085440	But it's the trans activists who are actively dumping gasoline on that fire.
