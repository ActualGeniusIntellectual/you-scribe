WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:08.400
Hey, this will be a less complicated video than usual.

00:08.400 --> 00:12.620
I just wanted to put pen to paper, well, keyboard to text file, on some ideas I've been thinking

00:12.620 --> 00:13.620
about recently.

00:13.620 --> 00:16.780
Yeah, I know I promised that the video was going to come out first, but what can I say?

00:16.780 --> 00:18.920
I'm currently addicted to Project Zomboid.

00:18.920 --> 00:23.420
November 20th was the Transgender Day of Remembrance, where we're supposed to remember the tragic

00:23.420 --> 00:25.100
deaths of trans people.

00:25.100 --> 00:28.960
The White House Press Secretary gave us a hard number of this year's trans victims

00:28.960 --> 00:53.680
in the United States.

00:53.680 --> 00:54.680
Yeah 26.

00:54.680 --> 01:00.680
In a nation of 330 million people, where approximately 1% of them are trans, 26 of

01:00.680 --> 01:01.680
them were murder victims.

01:01.680 --> 01:07.680
That's a murder rate of 0.00007%.

01:07.680 --> 01:12.640
Considering that in 2022 there were approximately 21,000 homicide cases in the States, with

01:12.640 --> 01:17.120
that 330 million population, the napkin math comes out to the general murder rate of America

01:17.120 --> 01:20.640
being, I think, 0.006%.

01:20.640 --> 01:24.760
These are both incredibly tiny, so literally who cares, but trans people do seem to have

01:24.760 --> 01:27.120
a much smaller chance of being murdered.

01:27.120 --> 01:31.520
Rachel Richards, a conservative trans YouTuber, wrote a video titled, Who's Killing Black

01:31.520 --> 01:32.840
Transgender Woman?

01:32.840 --> 01:38.620
In it, she points out that black trans women comprise 66% of the 202 cases of fatal violence

01:38.620 --> 01:42.460
against trans people in the United States from 2013 to 2020.

01:42.460 --> 01:48.420
The article she quotes ties the surge of black trans victimization to the rise of white supremacy

01:48.420 --> 01:50.180
and the far right in America.

01:50.220 --> 01:54.700
When Rachel digs up the individual cases and discovers, the vast majority of the murderers

01:54.700 --> 01:57.900
of these black trans women are actually black men.

01:57.900 --> 02:02.520
All that being said, the Williams Institute did state that trans people are four times

02:02.520 --> 02:07.560
more likely than cis people to experience violent victimization not including murder,

02:07.560 --> 02:10.260
like rape, sexual assault, or aggravated assault.

02:10.260 --> 02:17.780
The numbers are 86.2 trans victimizations per 1,000 people versus 21.7 cis victimizations.

02:17.780 --> 02:21.060
So is there an epidemic of trans murders in the States?

02:21.060 --> 02:22.060
No.

02:22.060 --> 02:25.380
But you can certainly make the claim that trans people are more likely to be the victims

02:25.380 --> 02:28.160
of other types of crime, especially sexual crime.

02:28.160 --> 02:31.040
The statistics for why this is the case aren't exactly clear.

02:31.040 --> 02:34.940
If I personally had to guess, it would likely be a combination of multiple factors.

02:34.940 --> 02:35.940
1.

02:35.940 --> 02:39.420
Sexual assault and power Oftentimes, sexual assaulters use positions

02:39.420 --> 02:44.060
of power to prey on their victims, whether that be teacher over student, boss over employee,

02:44.060 --> 02:47.760
police officer over criminal, or medical professional over patient.

02:47.760 --> 02:51.520
Trans people may simply be seen as easy targets due to their marginalization, or they may

02:51.520 --> 02:54.720
be fetishized as targets due to their unique sexual status.

02:54.720 --> 02:55.720
2.

02:55.720 --> 02:58.880
The majority of sexual violence happens within romantic relationships.

02:58.880 --> 03:03.060
As a general rule, the chance of violence in a relationship goes up the more outside

03:03.060 --> 03:05.080
the norm that relationship is.

03:05.080 --> 03:08.800
Interracial relationships tend to see a heightened level of violence.

03:08.800 --> 03:10.120
Lesbian relationships as well.

03:10.120 --> 03:12.260
Both sexual and non-sexual violence.

03:12.260 --> 03:14.680
It wouldn't surprise me if it were the same with trans people.

03:14.680 --> 03:15.680
3.

03:15.680 --> 03:19.520
The disproportionate number of trans women per capita work in sex work, either pornography

03:19.520 --> 03:23.800
or prostitution, both of which are jobs that are rife with sexual violence.

03:23.800 --> 03:28.700
The transgender day of remembrance is actually less about trans murder victims, despite its

03:28.700 --> 03:32.120
official definition, and more about blanket trans deaths.

03:32.120 --> 03:37.360
Yes, it was founded in 1999 as a memorial to the deaths of specific black trans women

03:37.360 --> 03:41.920
who were murdered, but definitions shift over time, and looking at how the holiday is colloquially

03:41.920 --> 03:45.000
spoken about on social media bears this out.

03:45.000 --> 03:49.120
Trans suicide is also far more likely to be a source of trans death than trans violence

03:49.120 --> 03:50.120
is.

03:50.120 --> 03:52.340
41% is a meme number for a reason.

03:52.340 --> 03:56.800
It comes from a 2012 report called the National Transgender Discrimination Survey, which claimed

03:56.800 --> 04:02.440
that 41% of the 6,450 trans people who were interviewed attempted to kill themselves at

04:02.440 --> 04:04.300
some point in their lives.

04:04.300 --> 04:07.800
Suicide seems to be the greatest risk that the trans population faces, more than violence,

04:07.800 --> 04:12.080
which is why most common discussions of the trans day of remembrance quietly slip suicide

04:12.080 --> 04:13.400
in with violence.

04:13.400 --> 04:15.900
I'm laying all of this out to make a specific point.

04:15.900 --> 04:20.640
The moral underpinning of trans activism is primarily in suicide prevention.

04:20.640 --> 04:21.640
Here's the logic.

04:21.640 --> 04:26.120
Look at this post on the LGBT subreddit that is pretty popular, titled, For anyone thinking

04:26.120 --> 04:29.880
transgender genocide isn't happening or that it won't be that bad should the Republicans

04:29.880 --> 04:31.140
gain more power.

04:31.140 --> 04:34.640
The trans genocide rhetoric from progressives has been pretty popular.

04:34.640 --> 04:39.200
Every move against trans activism is labeled genocidal, and the people who make these claims

04:39.200 --> 04:42.100
do believe that a genocide is currently in progress.

04:42.100 --> 04:46.260
When pressed on this, they usually refer to the ten stages of genocide.

04:46.260 --> 04:50.500
The ten stages of genocide is a theory developed by progressive Gregory Stanton, working in

04:50.500 --> 04:53.640
genocide studies at George Mason University.

04:53.640 --> 04:58.020
He developed the framework after the Rwandan genocide, and it reads as follows.

04:58.020 --> 04:59.760
Stage one, classification.

04:59.760 --> 05:02.000
People are divided into them and us.

05:02.000 --> 05:03.600
Stage two, symbolization.

05:03.600 --> 05:08.320
When combined with hatred, symbols may be forced upon unwilling members of prior groups.

05:08.320 --> 05:10.140
Stage three, discrimination.

05:10.140 --> 05:13.820
Laws or cultural power excludes groups from full civil rights.

05:13.820 --> 05:16.740
Segregation or apartheid laws denial of voting rights.

05:16.740 --> 05:18.620
Stage four, dehumanization.

05:18.620 --> 05:21.140
One group denies the humanity of the other group.

05:21.140 --> 05:25.000
Members of it are equated with animals, vermin, insects, or diseases.

05:25.000 --> 05:27.060
Stage five, organization.

05:27.060 --> 05:28.740
Genocide is always organized.

05:28.740 --> 05:32.060
Special army units or militias are trained and armed.

05:32.060 --> 05:34.140
Stage six, polarization.

05:34.140 --> 05:35.600
Extremists drive the groups apart.

05:35.600 --> 05:37.340
Leaders are arrested and murdered.

05:37.340 --> 05:40.220
Laws erode fundamental civil rights and liberties.

05:40.220 --> 05:41.900
Stage seven, preparation.

05:41.900 --> 05:43.560
Mass killing is planned.

05:43.560 --> 05:47.020
Victims are identified and separated because of their ethnic or religious identity.

05:47.020 --> 05:52.540
Stage eight, persecution, expropriation, forced displacement, ghettos, concentration camps.

05:52.540 --> 05:54.340
Stage nine, extermination.

05:54.340 --> 05:57.660
It's extermination to the killers because they do not believe their victims to be fully

05:57.660 --> 05:58.660
human.

05:58.660 --> 06:00.040
Stage ten, denial.

06:00.040 --> 06:02.440
The perpetrators deny they've committed any crimes.

06:02.440 --> 06:05.440
I can see how this framework can have some use in an academic setting.

06:05.440 --> 06:09.360
For example, in the study of actual genocides, which is what Professor Stanton did for his

06:09.360 --> 06:10.360
whole career.

06:10.360 --> 06:14.420
But nowadays, his framework is misused colloquially for political points.

06:14.420 --> 06:18.020
I've seen multiple breadtubers, the biggest being Hassan and Vashj.

06:18.020 --> 06:21.000
Why does it always have to be those two, who have pushed the idea that according to the

06:21.000 --> 06:26.320
official academic definition of genocide supported by the United Nations, a stage four trans-genocide

06:26.320 --> 06:27.480
is currently underway?

06:27.480 --> 06:29.320
Remember, stage four is dehumanization.

06:29.320 --> 06:31.900
The stage where one group denies the humanity of the other group.

06:31.900 --> 06:36.480
While it's true that there are absolutely some insane anti-trans people out there denying

06:36.480 --> 06:39.520
the humanity of trans people, does that mean it's a genocide?

06:39.520 --> 06:44.160
This seems like a wild misuse of the framework in order to score cheap political points.

06:44.160 --> 06:46.860
Apply this standard to anything else and you'll see what I mean.

06:46.860 --> 06:48.840
Are Trump supporters being genocided?

06:48.840 --> 06:51.760
I mean, it's not hard to find progressives dehumanizing them.

06:51.760 --> 06:53.520
So I guess we're already on stage four, guys.

06:53.520 --> 06:57.440
Hell, I'm sure from the Trump supporters' point of view, we're on a stage six genocide

06:57.440 --> 07:00.020
where Trump supporting groups are being driven apart.

07:00.020 --> 07:02.480
Reporters are being arrested, including Trump himself.

07:02.480 --> 07:06.740
Laws are being passed and judges are handing down rulings restricting the freedoms of Trump

07:06.740 --> 07:07.740
supporters.

07:07.740 --> 07:10.560
It's obvious that Trump supporters aren't actually being genocided.

07:10.560 --> 07:14.120
It's also obvious that trans people aren't actually being genocided either.

07:14.120 --> 07:17.840
What's actually going on here is that the word genocide contains a lot of emotional

07:17.840 --> 07:22.080
weight, and dishonest people want to harness that weight for political ends.

07:22.080 --> 07:26.620
Are non-citizen residents of every liberal country currently experiencing a stage three

07:26.620 --> 07:29.380
genocide because they can't vote like citizens can?

07:29.380 --> 07:34.040
Is admitting that two different groups exist a stage one genocide because it's us and

07:34.040 --> 07:35.040
them?

07:35.040 --> 07:36.900
Do socialists want to genocide the bourgeois?

07:36.900 --> 07:41.120
Why is this framework suddenly absent in every progressive discussion regarding what Hamas

07:41.120 --> 07:42.600
wants to do to Jewish people?

07:42.600 --> 07:46.400
Oh, also, when those BreadTubers before claimed that the 10 stages were from the UN, that's

07:46.400 --> 07:47.440
actually false.

07:47.440 --> 07:51.860
The UN Genocide Convention only covers the destruction of a national, ethnic, racial,

07:51.860 --> 07:53.000
or religious group.

07:53.000 --> 07:56.520
It doesn't cover political groups or what is colloquially known as cultural genocide.

07:56.520 --> 08:00.340
This is why, for example, when Germany was denazified, it wasn't genocide.

08:00.340 --> 08:03.780
By the way, I'm not saying I agree with the anti-trans laws coming into effect in

08:03.780 --> 08:04.780
the United States.

08:04.780 --> 08:06.220
A lot of them I don't actually agree with at all.

08:06.220 --> 08:07.940
But I'm pointing out something specific here.

08:07.940 --> 08:09.980
Let's return to that Reddit post.

08:09.980 --> 08:11.780
Genocide doesn't just happen through direct killing.

08:11.780 --> 08:13.700
This will cause deaths, and many of them.

08:13.700 --> 08:16.940
Just because they aren't lining people up in front of firing squads or gassing groups

08:16.940 --> 08:20.820
of people to death doesn't mean they would not be 100% responsible for lives lost.

08:20.820 --> 08:24.680
Suicide, fatal hate crimes, discrimination in work and housing, or increased mental health

08:24.680 --> 08:28.660
issues, causing loss of ability to function or support yourself, sudden and prolonged

08:28.660 --> 08:30.500
deaths from stress, grief, and terror.

08:30.500 --> 08:32.260
Remember what I said earlier?

08:32.260 --> 08:36.860
The moral underpinning of trans activism is primarily in suicide prevention.

08:36.860 --> 08:40.660
Even if you don't kill people yourself, if you make their lives so unbearable that

08:40.660 --> 08:44.200
they kill themselves, I think it's reasonable to say that you've got blood in your hands.

08:44.200 --> 08:47.680
While it's still their choice to kill themselves, and they shouldn't do it, you're not blameless

08:47.680 --> 08:48.680
either.

08:48.680 --> 08:52.180
Take this, combine it with the fact that trans people are at an elevated risk of suicide,

08:52.180 --> 08:56.720
the 41% meme, and you've now laid out the moral foundation for trans activism.

08:56.720 --> 09:01.280
The phrase literally killing trans people became a meme after trans activists used it

09:01.280 --> 09:04.800
like crazy online, culminating with JK Rowling making fun of it.

09:04.800 --> 09:06.380
But here's the logic behind it.

09:06.380 --> 09:10.640
Suffering from gender dysphoria causes, among many other things, suicidal thoughts.

09:10.640 --> 09:13.800
Therefore, alleviating gender dysphoria is preventing suicide.

09:13.800 --> 09:17.640
If transitioning alleviates dysphoria, then transitioning prevents suicide.

09:17.640 --> 09:21.600
If you prevent dysphoric people from transitioning, then you're creating the conditions for

09:22.020 --> 09:25.900
dysphoric people to suffer from suicidal thoughts, literally killing them by forcing on them

09:25.900 --> 09:28.500
the conditions that lead them to kill themselves.

09:28.500 --> 09:33.500
This effect is so serious, so deadly, that any action that non-trans people commit that

09:33.500 --> 09:38.340
might increase dysphoria for a trans person is literally killing them, because more dysphoria

09:38.340 --> 09:39.980
means more suicides.

09:39.980 --> 09:44.500
That's why we've seen such a huge push towards, for example, the abolition of sex-segregated

09:44.500 --> 09:45.500
spaces.

09:45.500 --> 09:48.900
Because a trans person who is refused into the sex-segregated space of their choice might

09:48.900 --> 09:52.980
have their dysphoria increased due to the exclusion, it's why we've seen a massive

09:52.980 --> 09:57.120
push for the adoption of progressive morality surrounding pronoun use, declaring their pronouns

09:57.120 --> 10:01.200
ahead of time, using specific types of pronouns, punishing those people who don't comply,

10:01.200 --> 10:04.560
in order to reduce dysphoria and therefore reduce suicide.

10:04.560 --> 10:09.960
You even see extremely weird, niche shit, like people removing mirrors from public spaces

10:09.960 --> 10:13.840
in order to reduce dysphoria, because trans people might see themselves at a bad angle

10:13.840 --> 10:15.660
and notice they don't pass or something.

10:15.660 --> 10:20.200
Or the removal of all gendered language, leading to things like people with uteruses,

10:20.200 --> 10:24.100
or birthing people, or bonus hole-havers, or all that other nonsense.

10:24.100 --> 10:29.320
Or demanding that misgendering or deadnaming be the equivalent of hurling racial slurs.

10:29.320 --> 10:33.520
The urgency underpinning all of this is preventing suicide, preventing death.

10:33.520 --> 10:37.600
And if you're a decent person, you know, you should want to prevent suicide, of course.

10:37.600 --> 10:41.360
However, if you're a reasonable person, you also recognize that there's a limit to this

10:41.360 --> 10:42.360
principle.

10:42.360 --> 10:45.940
For example, let's say I were sexually violated as a child with a cucumber.

10:45.940 --> 10:46.940
I wasn't, by the way.

10:46.940 --> 10:50.420
But let's assume that it was so traumatic that every time I saw a cucumber, it caused

10:50.420 --> 10:55.400
me extreme feelings of distress, to the point that I became suicidal every time.

10:55.400 --> 10:57.200
Should I be mocked for my issue?

10:57.200 --> 10:58.200
Of course not.

10:58.200 --> 11:02.620
But should I be able to demand that the entirety of society bend to meet my needs, that all

11:02.620 --> 11:06.700
cucumbers be removed from public sale, so that I don't ever have to experience one whenever

11:06.700 --> 11:07.900
I go outside?

11:07.900 --> 11:08.900
Of course not.

11:08.900 --> 11:12.720
We can have sympathy for those with special needs, and we can accommodate them in some

11:12.720 --> 11:15.400
ways, but there must be a limit to that accommodation.

11:15.400 --> 11:18.520
And this is the core of what I want you to consider today.

11:18.520 --> 11:20.960
Special needs is the correct way to discuss trans activism.

11:20.960 --> 11:23.480
No, I don't mean that as an insult, though it's kind of funny.

11:23.480 --> 11:28.520
The way trans activism positions itself, the way it behaves, is like disability activism.

11:28.520 --> 11:32.100
Due to an unfortunate circumstance, there is an identifiable group of people who suffer

11:32.100 --> 11:36.720
from a unique medical condition that makes their ability to engage with society harder.

11:36.720 --> 11:41.740
We therefore have a moral obligation to secure their rights as individuals wherever possible.

11:41.740 --> 11:45.420
For example, when we build a wheelchair ramp going into a store, we recognize that people

11:45.420 --> 11:47.660
in wheelchairs can't access that space.

11:47.660 --> 11:51.580
There's no reason they shouldn't be able to shop in the store, so we have a moral obligation

11:51.580 --> 11:53.180
to equalize access.

11:53.180 --> 11:55.460
But we also recognize the limits on this principle.

11:55.460 --> 11:58.340
A wheelchair-bound man will never play in the NBA.

11:58.340 --> 12:02.420
There can be other sports leagues for wheelchair-bound people to enjoy, but we don't demand the

12:02.420 --> 12:04.240
NBA accommodate him.

12:04.240 --> 12:07.580
The trans activist's demand for access functions in a similar way.

12:07.580 --> 12:11.380
When a trans activist says, for example, that trans women should be able to play in women's

12:11.380 --> 12:15.820
sports, we can recognize the need for an equality of access that doesn't increase dysphoria

12:15.820 --> 12:17.860
and therefore doesn't drive up suicide rates.

12:17.860 --> 12:22.140
But we also recognize that the practical advantage that male puberty grants to an athlete is

12:22.140 --> 12:26.220
extreme, and unless a trans woman began their transition when puberty began, like at 12

12:26.220 --> 12:31.340
years old or whatever, the integrity of professional-level sports is destroyed by allowing trans women

12:31.340 --> 12:32.540
to compete in them.

12:32.540 --> 12:34.080
Here's the issue, though.

12:34.080 --> 12:38.760
Because all of the moral urgency that drives trans activism is based in suicide prevention,

12:38.760 --> 12:43.840
all of its demands must be fundamentally medical in nature, making it like disability activism.

12:43.840 --> 12:48.440
However, unlike disability activism, when you begin that negotiation process of what

12:48.440 --> 12:52.960
is reasonable versus unreasonable accommodation, like how it's reasonable to build a ramp

12:52.960 --> 12:57.640
to access a store versus it's unreasonable to put a wheelchair-bound man in the NBA,

12:57.640 --> 13:02.220
when that negotiation process happens for trans activism, trans activists stop acting

13:02.220 --> 13:07.120
like their activism is like disability activism, they stop talking about their medical needs.

13:07.120 --> 13:10.760
Instead, their activism morphs into something very different.

13:10.760 --> 13:14.760
Gay rights activism is a type of progressive activism fundamentally different from disability

13:14.760 --> 13:15.760
activism.

13:15.760 --> 13:19.740
It's not a medical activist movement, it's a lifestyle activist movement.

13:19.740 --> 13:22.600
Where disability activists claim that they are different from the norm and need special

13:22.600 --> 13:26.400
treatment to be equal, lifestyle activists claim that they're the same as the norm,

13:26.400 --> 13:29.160
and treating them differently is therefore unjust.

13:29.160 --> 13:31.280
This is the logic behind gay marriage.

13:31.280 --> 13:32.540
These are just like straights.

13:32.540 --> 13:35.380
Why can't they enjoy marriage rights just like the straights do?

13:35.380 --> 13:39.220
And fair enough, even if gay people do tend to get married less now that they've got

13:39.220 --> 13:42.920
those rights, should we prevent those gay people who actually do want to get married

13:42.920 --> 13:43.920
from doing so?

13:43.920 --> 13:44.920
Of course not.

13:44.920 --> 13:49.420
The moral underpinning of gay rights activism isn't suicide prevention the same way it

13:49.420 --> 13:50.420
is for trans activism.

13:50.420 --> 13:53.620
That's not to say that gay people don't kill themselves at higher rates than straight

13:53.620 --> 13:54.620
people, they certainly do.

13:54.620 --> 13:56.420
But it's not the focus of gay rights activism.

13:56.420 --> 14:00.980
The focus has always been alternative lifestyles are valid and should not be suppressed by

14:00.980 --> 14:01.980
the law.

14:01.980 --> 14:05.640
To refer back to Haidt's moral foundations, it's a question of liberty and oppression,

14:05.640 --> 14:07.280
not care and harm.

14:07.280 --> 14:11.240
Lifestyle activist movements don't need to do the same negotiation with larger society

14:11.240 --> 14:13.280
that medical activist movements do.

14:13.280 --> 14:17.220
There is actually a serious cost to implementing disability rights, somebody's gotta build

14:17.220 --> 14:21.160
that ramp, and that cost doesn't exist with gay rights.

14:21.160 --> 14:26.000
Securing gay rights is 99% leaving people alone and 1% allowing gay couples to file

14:26.000 --> 14:28.460
paperwork that straight couples can already file.

14:28.460 --> 14:32.240
When trans activists talk about how serious their work is, when they talk about suffering

14:32.240 --> 14:35.620
from dysphoria and the suicide rates, they're making a medical claim.

14:35.620 --> 14:39.760
Their activism is like disability activism, where we have a moral obligation to change

14:39.760 --> 14:41.120
things to prevent their suffering.

14:41.120 --> 14:44.720
But when it comes time to negotiate those changes, understanding that there are other

14:44.720 --> 14:48.720
non-trans people whose points of view also need to be considered, the language of the

14:48.720 --> 14:50.420
trans activist suddenly shifts.

14:50.420 --> 14:54.480
Now it's not about dysphoria and suicides anymore, now it's like gay activism.

14:54.480 --> 14:55.720
Now it's a lifestyle.

14:55.720 --> 14:58.060
Who are you to decide what trans people can and can't do?

14:58.060 --> 14:59.520
Who are you to judge my life?

14:59.520 --> 15:01.700
Who are you to say who is and isn't trans?

15:01.700 --> 15:05.800
Anyone can be trans, you don't need dysphoria to be trans, it's all just self-ID, you

15:05.800 --> 15:10.900
just are trans like gay people are just gay, you're oppressing us by questioning us.

15:10.900 --> 15:13.740
This is the motte and bailey of trans activism.

15:13.740 --> 15:17.360
Trans activists bring in all of the moral weight of the plight of trans people, the

15:17.360 --> 15:22.080
suffering, the suicides, and demand large accommodations equivalent to that plight.

15:22.080 --> 15:25.740
But when the costs of that accommodation need to be discussed, they switch track to the

15:25.740 --> 15:29.560
language of gay activism, which has a much smaller associated cost.

15:29.560 --> 15:33.640
Here's two very clear examples of what I mean, when you talk about banning trans women

15:33.640 --> 15:37.860
from women's sports, or from women's bathrooms, or locker rooms, trans activism is framed

15:37.860 --> 15:40.580
as if it is medical, it's like disability activism.

15:40.580 --> 15:44.700
Being trans is an unfortunate incurable medical condition that needs to be accommodated in

15:44.700 --> 15:46.340
order to prevent their suicide.

15:46.340 --> 15:50.380
When you talk about, oh I don't know, a hypothetical medical procedure that cures

15:50.380 --> 15:55.320
gender dysphoria without transitioning, trans activism is suddenly like gay activism, it's

15:55.320 --> 15:58.900
a lifestyle you bigot, you're trying to cure something that isn't medical at all

15:58.900 --> 16:02.280
but is just an alternative way of living that causes nobody any harm.

16:02.280 --> 16:06.200
Trans activists switch between these two positions depending on which interpretation serves them

16:06.200 --> 16:09.280
in the moment, but they are mutually exclusive.

16:09.280 --> 16:13.340
Either being trans is an alternative way of living that causes no harm and people should

16:13.340 --> 16:18.700
be left alone to do it, or it's so incredibly serious that the entirety of society must

16:18.700 --> 16:21.760
be changed to accommodate them to prevent further harm.

16:21.760 --> 16:23.540
But it can't be both of these things.

16:23.540 --> 16:28.980
This is partially why, I think, the LGB splitting from the T thing is slowly gaining ground.

16:28.980 --> 16:32.520
People are recognizing that what is necessary to include people with alternative sexual

16:32.520 --> 16:36.500
interests is very different than what is necessary to include people with gender dysphoria, as

16:36.500 --> 16:39.820
well as people who don't have dysphoria at all, but claim to be trans anyway.

16:39.820 --> 16:44.340
As more and more people have slowly recognized this motte and bailey, LGBT acceptance has

16:44.340 --> 16:48.660
trended downward for the first time in a long time, mainly due to the T acting as a boat

16:48.660 --> 16:50.240
anchor for the rest of it.

16:50.240 --> 16:54.360
Trans activists have responded by claiming that people who oppose or question their activism

16:54.360 --> 16:58.980
are simply transphobic, bigoted, racist, Trump-voting pieces of shit, that the pushback they receive

16:58.980 --> 17:02.480
justifies their radicalism, and they have continued to further dig the hole they find

17:02.480 --> 17:03.480
themselves in.

17:03.480 --> 17:07.900
When people stopped reacting to being called transphobic, they switched to transgenocider.

17:07.900 --> 17:10.940
Even that's become a tired cry now, so I have no idea what they're going to slander people

17:10.940 --> 17:11.940
with next.

17:11.940 --> 17:15.560
I also have no idea what they're going to say if a real transgenocide actually comes

17:15.560 --> 17:16.560
along.

17:16.560 --> 17:20.320
I'm wondering they've abused these terms so much, all the moral weight has been stripped

17:20.320 --> 17:21.320
from them.

17:21.320 --> 17:25.800
What I do know is, many trans people who I've spoken to do not approve of this shit.

17:25.800 --> 17:27.960
They don't want to play in women's sports at the professional level.

17:27.960 --> 17:31.500
They don't want to walk into a change room and wiggle their cocks at little girls present.

17:31.500 --> 17:35.440
They want to take their hormones and have normal careers and spend time with their friends,

17:35.440 --> 17:39.960
and enter into consensual relationships with other adults, and be left alone to enjoy their

17:39.960 --> 17:45.680
private lives as their natural inclinations demand, which is a completely reasonable request.

17:45.680 --> 17:49.840
They understand they're not the norm, and they want to actually be a part of that social

17:49.840 --> 17:54.040
negotiation that allows them to lead a good life in society.

17:54.040 --> 17:58.360
It might be the reactionary right wing pushing anti-trans laws right now, and to the extent

17:58.360 --> 18:00.800
that those laws are bad, we should oppose them.

18:00.800 --> 18:05.440
But it's the trans activists who are actively dumping gasoline on that fire.
