1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,400
Hey, this will be a less complicated video than usual.

2
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:12,620
I just wanted to put pen to paper, well, keyboard to text file, on some ideas I've been thinking

3
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:13,620
about recently.

4
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:16,780
Yeah, I know I promised that the video was going to come out first, but what can I say?

5
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:18,920
I'm currently addicted to Project Zomboid.

6
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:23,420
November 20th was the Transgender Day of Remembrance, where we're supposed to remember the tragic

7
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:25,100
deaths of trans people.

8
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:28,960
The White House Press Secretary gave us a hard number of this year's trans victims

9
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:53,680
in the United States.

10
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:54,680
Yeah 26.

11
00:00:54,680 --> 00:01:00,680
In a nation of 330 million people, where approximately 1% of them are trans, 26 of

12
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:01,680
them were murder victims.

13
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:07,680
That's a murder rate of 0.00007%.

14
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:12,640
Considering that in 2022 there were approximately 21,000 homicide cases in the States, with

15
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:17,120
that 330 million population, the napkin math comes out to the general murder rate of America

16
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:20,640
being, I think, 0.006%.

17
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,760
These are both incredibly tiny, so literally who cares, but trans people do seem to have

18
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:27,120
a much smaller chance of being murdered.

19
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:31,520
Rachel Richards, a conservative trans YouTuber, wrote a video titled, Who's Killing Black

20
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:32,840
Transgender Woman?

21
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:38,620
In it, she points out that black trans women comprise 66% of the 202 cases of fatal violence

22
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:42,460
against trans people in the United States from 2013 to 2020.

23
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:48,420
The article she quotes ties the surge of black trans victimization to the rise of white supremacy

24
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:50,180
and the far right in America.

25
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:54,700
When Rachel digs up the individual cases and discovers, the vast majority of the murderers

26
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:57,900
of these black trans women are actually black men.

27
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:02,520
All that being said, the Williams Institute did state that trans people are four times

28
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:07,560
more likely than cis people to experience violent victimization not including murder,

29
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:10,260
like rape, sexual assault, or aggravated assault.

30
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:17,780
The numbers are 86.2 trans victimizations per 1,000 people versus 21.7 cis victimizations.

31
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:21,060
So is there an epidemic of trans murders in the States?

32
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:22,060
No.

33
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:25,380
But you can certainly make the claim that trans people are more likely to be the victims

34
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:28,160
of other types of crime, especially sexual crime.

35
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:31,040
The statistics for why this is the case aren't exactly clear.

36
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:34,940
If I personally had to guess, it would likely be a combination of multiple factors.

37
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:35,940
1.

38
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:39,420
Sexual assault and power Oftentimes, sexual assaulters use positions

39
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:44,060
of power to prey on their victims, whether that be teacher over student, boss over employee,

40
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:47,760
police officer over criminal, or medical professional over patient.

41
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:51,520
Trans people may simply be seen as easy targets due to their marginalization, or they may

42
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:54,720
be fetishized as targets due to their unique sexual status.

43
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:55,720
2.

44
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:58,880
The majority of sexual violence happens within romantic relationships.

45
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:03,060
As a general rule, the chance of violence in a relationship goes up the more outside

46
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:05,080
the norm that relationship is.

47
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:08,800
Interracial relationships tend to see a heightened level of violence.

48
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,120
Lesbian relationships as well.

49
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:12,260
Both sexual and non-sexual violence.

50
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:14,680
It wouldn't surprise me if it were the same with trans people.

51
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:15,680
3.

52
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:19,520
The disproportionate number of trans women per capita work in sex work, either pornography

53
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:23,800
or prostitution, both of which are jobs that are rife with sexual violence.

54
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:28,700
The transgender day of remembrance is actually less about trans murder victims, despite its

55
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:32,120
official definition, and more about blanket trans deaths.

56
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:37,360
Yes, it was founded in 1999 as a memorial to the deaths of specific black trans women

57
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:41,920
who were murdered, but definitions shift over time, and looking at how the holiday is colloquially

58
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:45,000
spoken about on social media bears this out.

59
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,120
Trans suicide is also far more likely to be a source of trans death than trans violence

60
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,120
is.

61
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:52,340
41% is a meme number for a reason.

62
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:56,800
It comes from a 2012 report called the National Transgender Discrimination Survey, which claimed

63
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:02,440
that 41% of the 6,450 trans people who were interviewed attempted to kill themselves at

64
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:04,300
some point in their lives.

65
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:07,800
Suicide seems to be the greatest risk that the trans population faces, more than violence,

66
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:12,080
which is why most common discussions of the trans day of remembrance quietly slip suicide

67
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,400
in with violence.

68
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:15,900
I'm laying all of this out to make a specific point.

69
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:20,640
The moral underpinning of trans activism is primarily in suicide prevention.

70
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:21,640
Here's the logic.

71
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:26,120
Look at this post on the LGBT subreddit that is pretty popular, titled, For anyone thinking

72
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:29,880
transgender genocide isn't happening or that it won't be that bad should the Republicans

73
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:31,140
gain more power.

74
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:34,640
The trans genocide rhetoric from progressives has been pretty popular.

75
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:39,200
Every move against trans activism is labeled genocidal, and the people who make these claims

76
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:42,100
do believe that a genocide is currently in progress.

77
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:46,260
When pressed on this, they usually refer to the ten stages of genocide.

78
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:50,500
The ten stages of genocide is a theory developed by progressive Gregory Stanton, working in

79
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:53,640
genocide studies at George Mason University.

80
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:58,020
He developed the framework after the Rwandan genocide, and it reads as follows.

81
00:04:58,020 --> 00:04:59,760
Stage one, classification.

82
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:02,000
People are divided into them and us.

83
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,600
Stage two, symbolization.

84
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:08,320
When combined with hatred, symbols may be forced upon unwilling members of prior groups.

85
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,140
Stage three, discrimination.

86
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:13,820
Laws or cultural power excludes groups from full civil rights.

87
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:16,740
Segregation or apartheid laws denial of voting rights.

88
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:18,620
Stage four, dehumanization.

89
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:21,140
One group denies the humanity of the other group.

90
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:25,000
Members of it are equated with animals, vermin, insects, or diseases.

91
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,060
Stage five, organization.

92
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:28,740
Genocide is always organized.

93
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:32,060
Special army units or militias are trained and armed.

94
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:34,140
Stage six, polarization.

95
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:35,600
Extremists drive the groups apart.

96
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,340
Leaders are arrested and murdered.

97
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:40,220
Laws erode fundamental civil rights and liberties.

98
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:41,900
Stage seven, preparation.

99
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:43,560
Mass killing is planned.

100
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:47,020
Victims are identified and separated because of their ethnic or religious identity.

101
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:52,540
Stage eight, persecution, expropriation, forced displacement, ghettos, concentration camps.

102
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:54,340
Stage nine, extermination.

103
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:57,660
It's extermination to the killers because they do not believe their victims to be fully

104
00:05:57,660 --> 00:05:58,660
human.

105
00:05:58,660 --> 00:06:00,040
Stage ten, denial.

106
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:02,440
The perpetrators deny they've committed any crimes.

107
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:05,440
I can see how this framework can have some use in an academic setting.

108
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:09,360
For example, in the study of actual genocides, which is what Professor Stanton did for his

109
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,360
whole career.

110
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:14,420
But nowadays, his framework is misused colloquially for political points.

111
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:18,020
I've seen multiple breadtubers, the biggest being Hassan and Vashj.

112
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:21,000
Why does it always have to be those two, who have pushed the idea that according to the

113
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:26,320
official academic definition of genocide supported by the United Nations, a stage four trans-genocide

114
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:27,480
is currently underway?

115
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:29,320
Remember, stage four is dehumanization.

116
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:31,900
The stage where one group denies the humanity of the other group.

117
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:36,480
While it's true that there are absolutely some insane anti-trans people out there denying

118
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:39,520
the humanity of trans people, does that mean it's a genocide?

119
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:44,160
This seems like a wild misuse of the framework in order to score cheap political points.

120
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,860
Apply this standard to anything else and you'll see what I mean.

121
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:48,840
Are Trump supporters being genocided?

122
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:51,760
I mean, it's not hard to find progressives dehumanizing them.

123
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:53,520
So I guess we're already on stage four, guys.

124
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:57,440
Hell, I'm sure from the Trump supporters' point of view, we're on a stage six genocide

125
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:00,020
where Trump supporting groups are being driven apart.

126
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:02,480
Reporters are being arrested, including Trump himself.

127
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:06,740
Laws are being passed and judges are handing down rulings restricting the freedoms of Trump

128
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:07,740
supporters.

129
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:10,560
It's obvious that Trump supporters aren't actually being genocided.

130
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:14,120
It's also obvious that trans people aren't actually being genocided either.

131
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:17,840
What's actually going on here is that the word genocide contains a lot of emotional

132
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:22,080
weight, and dishonest people want to harness that weight for political ends.

133
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:26,620
Are non-citizen residents of every liberal country currently experiencing a stage three

134
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:29,380
genocide because they can't vote like citizens can?

135
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:34,040
Is admitting that two different groups exist a stage one genocide because it's us and

136
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,040
them?

137
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,900
Do socialists want to genocide the bourgeois?

138
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:41,120
Why is this framework suddenly absent in every progressive discussion regarding what Hamas

139
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,600
wants to do to Jewish people?

140
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:46,400
Oh, also, when those BreadTubers before claimed that the 10 stages were from the UN, that's

141
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,440
actually false.

142
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:51,860
The UN Genocide Convention only covers the destruction of a national, ethnic, racial,

143
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:53,000
or religious group.

144
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,520
It doesn't cover political groups or what is colloquially known as cultural genocide.

145
00:07:56,520 --> 00:08:00,340
This is why, for example, when Germany was denazified, it wasn't genocide.

146
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:03,780
By the way, I'm not saying I agree with the anti-trans laws coming into effect in

147
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:04,780
the United States.

148
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:06,220
A lot of them I don't actually agree with at all.

149
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:07,940
But I'm pointing out something specific here.

150
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:09,980
Let's return to that Reddit post.

151
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:11,780
Genocide doesn't just happen through direct killing.

152
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:13,700
This will cause deaths, and many of them.

153
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:16,940
Just because they aren't lining people up in front of firing squads or gassing groups

154
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:20,820
of people to death doesn't mean they would not be 100% responsible for lives lost.

155
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:24,680
Suicide, fatal hate crimes, discrimination in work and housing, or increased mental health

156
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:28,660
issues, causing loss of ability to function or support yourself, sudden and prolonged

157
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:30,500
deaths from stress, grief, and terror.

158
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:32,260
Remember what I said earlier?

159
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:36,860
The moral underpinning of trans activism is primarily in suicide prevention.

160
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:40,660
Even if you don't kill people yourself, if you make their lives so unbearable that

161
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:44,200
they kill themselves, I think it's reasonable to say that you've got blood in your hands.

162
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:47,680
While it's still their choice to kill themselves, and they shouldn't do it, you're not blameless

163
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:48,680
either.

164
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:52,180
Take this, combine it with the fact that trans people are at an elevated risk of suicide,

165
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:56,720
the 41% meme, and you've now laid out the moral foundation for trans activism.

166
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:01,280
The phrase literally killing trans people became a meme after trans activists used it

167
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:04,800
like crazy online, culminating with JK Rowling making fun of it.

168
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,380
But here's the logic behind it.

169
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:10,640
Suffering from gender dysphoria causes, among many other things, suicidal thoughts.

170
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:13,800
Therefore, alleviating gender dysphoria is preventing suicide.

171
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:17,640
If transitioning alleviates dysphoria, then transitioning prevents suicide.

172
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:21,600
If you prevent dysphoric people from transitioning, then you're creating the conditions for

173
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:25,900
dysphoric people to suffer from suicidal thoughts, literally killing them by forcing on them

174
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:28,500
the conditions that lead them to kill themselves.

175
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:33,500
This effect is so serious, so deadly, that any action that non-trans people commit that

176
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:38,340
might increase dysphoria for a trans person is literally killing them, because more dysphoria

177
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:39,980
means more suicides.

178
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:44,500
That's why we've seen such a huge push towards, for example, the abolition of sex-segregated

179
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:45,500
spaces.

180
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:48,900
Because a trans person who is refused into the sex-segregated space of their choice might

181
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:52,980
have their dysphoria increased due to the exclusion, it's why we've seen a massive

182
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:57,120
push for the adoption of progressive morality surrounding pronoun use, declaring their pronouns

183
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:01,200
ahead of time, using specific types of pronouns, punishing those people who don't comply,

184
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,560
in order to reduce dysphoria and therefore reduce suicide.

185
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:09,960
You even see extremely weird, niche shit, like people removing mirrors from public spaces

186
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:13,840
in order to reduce dysphoria, because trans people might see themselves at a bad angle

187
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:15,660
and notice they don't pass or something.

188
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:20,200
Or the removal of all gendered language, leading to things like people with uteruses,

189
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:24,100
or birthing people, or bonus hole-havers, or all that other nonsense.

190
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:29,320
Or demanding that misgendering or deadnaming be the equivalent of hurling racial slurs.

191
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:33,520
The urgency underpinning all of this is preventing suicide, preventing death.

192
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:37,600
And if you're a decent person, you know, you should want to prevent suicide, of course.

193
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:41,360
However, if you're a reasonable person, you also recognize that there's a limit to this

194
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:42,360
principle.

195
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:45,940
For example, let's say I were sexually violated as a child with a cucumber.

196
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:46,940
I wasn't, by the way.

197
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:50,420
But let's assume that it was so traumatic that every time I saw a cucumber, it caused

198
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:55,400
me extreme feelings of distress, to the point that I became suicidal every time.

199
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:57,200
Should I be mocked for my issue?

200
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,200
Of course not.

201
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:02,620
But should I be able to demand that the entirety of society bend to meet my needs, that all

202
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:06,700
cucumbers be removed from public sale, so that I don't ever have to experience one whenever

203
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:07,900
I go outside?

204
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:08,900
Of course not.

205
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:12,720
We can have sympathy for those with special needs, and we can accommodate them in some

206
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:15,400
ways, but there must be a limit to that accommodation.

207
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:18,520
And this is the core of what I want you to consider today.

208
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:20,960
Special needs is the correct way to discuss trans activism.

209
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:23,480
No, I don't mean that as an insult, though it's kind of funny.

210
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:28,520
The way trans activism positions itself, the way it behaves, is like disability activism.

211
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:32,100
Due to an unfortunate circumstance, there is an identifiable group of people who suffer

212
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:36,720
from a unique medical condition that makes their ability to engage with society harder.

213
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:41,740
We therefore have a moral obligation to secure their rights as individuals wherever possible.

214
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:45,420
For example, when we build a wheelchair ramp going into a store, we recognize that people

215
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:47,660
in wheelchairs can't access that space.

216
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:51,580
There's no reason they shouldn't be able to shop in the store, so we have a moral obligation

217
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:53,180
to equalize access.

218
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:55,460
But we also recognize the limits on this principle.

219
00:11:55,460 --> 00:11:58,340
A wheelchair-bound man will never play in the NBA.

220
00:11:58,340 --> 00:12:02,420
There can be other sports leagues for wheelchair-bound people to enjoy, but we don't demand the

221
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:04,240
NBA accommodate him.

222
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:07,580
The trans activist's demand for access functions in a similar way.

223
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:11,380
When a trans activist says, for example, that trans women should be able to play in women's

224
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:15,820
sports, we can recognize the need for an equality of access that doesn't increase dysphoria

225
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:17,860
and therefore doesn't drive up suicide rates.

226
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:22,140
But we also recognize that the practical advantage that male puberty grants to an athlete is

227
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:26,220
extreme, and unless a trans woman began their transition when puberty began, like at 12

228
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:31,340
years old or whatever, the integrity of professional-level sports is destroyed by allowing trans women

229
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:32,540
to compete in them.

230
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:34,080
Here's the issue, though.

231
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:38,760
Because all of the moral urgency that drives trans activism is based in suicide prevention,

232
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:43,840
all of its demands must be fundamentally medical in nature, making it like disability activism.

233
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:48,440
However, unlike disability activism, when you begin that negotiation process of what

234
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:52,960
is reasonable versus unreasonable accommodation, like how it's reasonable to build a ramp

235
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:57,640
to access a store versus it's unreasonable to put a wheelchair-bound man in the NBA,

236
00:12:57,640 --> 00:13:02,220
when that negotiation process happens for trans activism, trans activists stop acting

237
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:07,120
like their activism is like disability activism, they stop talking about their medical needs.

238
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:10,760
Instead, their activism morphs into something very different.

239
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:14,760
Gay rights activism is a type of progressive activism fundamentally different from disability

240
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:15,760
activism.

241
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:19,740
It's not a medical activist movement, it's a lifestyle activist movement.

242
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:22,600
Where disability activists claim that they are different from the norm and need special

243
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:26,400
treatment to be equal, lifestyle activists claim that they're the same as the norm,

244
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:29,160
and treating them differently is therefore unjust.

245
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:31,280
This is the logic behind gay marriage.

246
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:32,540
These are just like straights.

247
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:35,380
Why can't they enjoy marriage rights just like the straights do?

248
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:39,220
And fair enough, even if gay people do tend to get married less now that they've got

249
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:42,920
those rights, should we prevent those gay people who actually do want to get married

250
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:43,920
from doing so?

251
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:44,920
Of course not.

252
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:49,420
The moral underpinning of gay rights activism isn't suicide prevention the same way it

253
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:50,420
is for trans activism.

254
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:53,620
That's not to say that gay people don't kill themselves at higher rates than straight

255
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:54,620
people, they certainly do.

256
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:56,420
But it's not the focus of gay rights activism.

257
00:13:56,420 --> 00:14:00,980
The focus has always been alternative lifestyles are valid and should not be suppressed by

258
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:01,980
the law.

259
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:05,640
To refer back to Haidt's moral foundations, it's a question of liberty and oppression,

260
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:07,280
not care and harm.

261
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:11,240
Lifestyle activist movements don't need to do the same negotiation with larger society

262
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:13,280
that medical activist movements do.

263
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:17,220
There is actually a serious cost to implementing disability rights, somebody's gotta build

264
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:21,160
that ramp, and that cost doesn't exist with gay rights.

265
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:26,000
Securing gay rights is 99% leaving people alone and 1% allowing gay couples to file

266
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,460
paperwork that straight couples can already file.

267
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:32,240
When trans activists talk about how serious their work is, when they talk about suffering

268
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:35,620
from dysphoria and the suicide rates, they're making a medical claim.

269
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:39,760
Their activism is like disability activism, where we have a moral obligation to change

270
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,120
things to prevent their suffering.

271
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:44,720
But when it comes time to negotiate those changes, understanding that there are other

272
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:48,720
non-trans people whose points of view also need to be considered, the language of the

273
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,420
trans activist suddenly shifts.

274
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:54,480
Now it's not about dysphoria and suicides anymore, now it's like gay activism.

275
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:55,720
Now it's a lifestyle.

276
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:58,060
Who are you to decide what trans people can and can't do?

277
00:14:58,060 --> 00:14:59,520
Who are you to judge my life?

278
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:01,700
Who are you to say who is and isn't trans?

279
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:05,800
Anyone can be trans, you don't need dysphoria to be trans, it's all just self-ID, you

280
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:10,900
just are trans like gay people are just gay, you're oppressing us by questioning us.

281
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:13,740
This is the motte and bailey of trans activism.

282
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:17,360
Trans activists bring in all of the moral weight of the plight of trans people, the

283
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:22,080
suffering, the suicides, and demand large accommodations equivalent to that plight.

284
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:25,740
But when the costs of that accommodation need to be discussed, they switch track to the

285
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:29,560
language of gay activism, which has a much smaller associated cost.

286
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:33,640
Here's two very clear examples of what I mean, when you talk about banning trans women

287
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:37,860
from women's sports, or from women's bathrooms, or locker rooms, trans activism is framed

288
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:40,580
as if it is medical, it's like disability activism.

289
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:44,700
Being trans is an unfortunate incurable medical condition that needs to be accommodated in

290
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:46,340
order to prevent their suicide.

291
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:50,380
When you talk about, oh I don't know, a hypothetical medical procedure that cures

292
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:55,320
gender dysphoria without transitioning, trans activism is suddenly like gay activism, it's

293
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:58,900
a lifestyle you bigot, you're trying to cure something that isn't medical at all

294
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:02,280
but is just an alternative way of living that causes nobody any harm.

295
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:06,200
Trans activists switch between these two positions depending on which interpretation serves them

296
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:09,280
in the moment, but they are mutually exclusive.

297
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:13,340
Either being trans is an alternative way of living that causes no harm and people should

298
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:18,700
be left alone to do it, or it's so incredibly serious that the entirety of society must

299
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:21,760
be changed to accommodate them to prevent further harm.

300
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:23,540
But it can't be both of these things.

301
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:28,980
This is partially why, I think, the LGB splitting from the T thing is slowly gaining ground.

302
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:32,520
People are recognizing that what is necessary to include people with alternative sexual

303
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:36,500
interests is very different than what is necessary to include people with gender dysphoria, as

304
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:39,820
well as people who don't have dysphoria at all, but claim to be trans anyway.

305
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:44,340
As more and more people have slowly recognized this motte and bailey, LGBT acceptance has

306
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:48,660
trended downward for the first time in a long time, mainly due to the T acting as a boat

307
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:50,240
anchor for the rest of it.

308
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:54,360
Trans activists have responded by claiming that people who oppose or question their activism

309
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:58,980
are simply transphobic, bigoted, racist, Trump-voting pieces of shit, that the pushback they receive

310
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:02,480
justifies their radicalism, and they have continued to further dig the hole they find

311
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,480
themselves in.

312
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:07,900
When people stopped reacting to being called transphobic, they switched to transgenocider.

313
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:10,940
Even that's become a tired cry now, so I have no idea what they're going to slander people

314
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:11,940
with next.

315
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:15,560
I also have no idea what they're going to say if a real transgenocide actually comes

316
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:16,560
along.

317
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:20,320
I'm wondering they've abused these terms so much, all the moral weight has been stripped

318
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:21,320
from them.

319
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:25,800
What I do know is, many trans people who I've spoken to do not approve of this shit.

320
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:27,960
They don't want to play in women's sports at the professional level.

321
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:31,500
They don't want to walk into a change room and wiggle their cocks at little girls present.

322
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:35,440
They want to take their hormones and have normal careers and spend time with their friends,

323
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:39,960
and enter into consensual relationships with other adults, and be left alone to enjoy their

324
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:45,680
private lives as their natural inclinations demand, which is a completely reasonable request.

325
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:49,840
They understand they're not the norm, and they want to actually be a part of that social

326
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:54,040
negotiation that allows them to lead a good life in society.

327
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:58,360
It might be the reactionary right wing pushing anti-trans laws right now, and to the extent
