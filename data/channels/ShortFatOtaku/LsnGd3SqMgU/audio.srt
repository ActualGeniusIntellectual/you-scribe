1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Don't get no fight with them.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Don't get no fight with them.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Are you talking to them?

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Yeah, I'm eating them.

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
It's ridiculous.

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Yeah, this is ridiculous.

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
What did they get called for?

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Because there were two black guys sitting here meeting me?

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Well, what did they do?

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
What did they do? Someone told me what they did.

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
They didn't do anything. I saw the entire thing.

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
What did they do?

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
The moment says,

14
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
for any customer,

15
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
they can do anything.

16
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
As you've seen at the beginning of this video,

17
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
and as you've probably heard about all over the internet by now,

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
on April 12th, 2018,

19
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
two black men were arrested for trespassing within a Starbucks

20
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
while waiting for a business associate of theirs to arrive.

21
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
The business associate in question

22
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
is the white guy in the video

23
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
asking the police why the two black men are being arrested.

24
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
The manager who called the police

25
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
stated in the 911 call

26
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
that the two men sat down

27
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
and refused to buy anything or leave the premises.

28
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
That same manager later quit her job,

29
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
presumably due to the blowback received from this event.

30
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
On Twitter, Starbucks apologized

31
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
for exercising their legal rights

32
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
against non-customers trespassing

33
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
on their private property.

34
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
On April 12th, 2018,

35
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
two black men were arrested

36
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
for trespassing

37
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
while waiting for a business associate

38
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
to arrive.

39
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
On April 12th, 2018,

40
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
two black men were arrested

41
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
for trespassing

42
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
against non-customers trespassing

43
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
on their private property.

44
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
The CEO of Starbucks even made the rounds in the morning news,

45
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
offering sincere apologies

46
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
that one of his employees would dare assert their rights

47
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
against a person of color.

48
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Philadelphia's police commissioner released a video

49
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
in which he defended the legal actions of his officers.

50
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
On Thursday, at about 4.40,

51
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
police received a 911 call

52
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
for a disturbance

53
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
and trespassing.

54
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
When the police arrived,

55
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
they were met by Starbucks employees

56
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
who said that two males were trespassing

57
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
and had refused to leave the establishment.

58
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
According to employees,

59
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
they had seen these two males

60
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
come in, they sat down,

61
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
and after being seated,

62
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
they decided that they needed to use the restroom.

63
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Starbucks said that

64
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
according to their company policy,

65
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
they do not allow

66
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
nonpaying members

67
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
or nonpaying people

68
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
of the public to come in

69
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
and use the restroom.

70
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
And so,

71
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
they then asked these two males

72
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
to leave, these two males

73
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
refused to leave,

74
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
and the police were called.

75
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Now, when the police were

76
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
summoned to the scene,

77
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
they get there and they get this story

78
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
that I just began to outline.

79
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
They then approached the males,

80
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
they asked the males to leave

81
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
because they're being

82
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
asked to leave by Starbucks

83
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
employees. In fact,

84
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
in an effort to quell the situation,

85
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
officers actually called for a

86
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
supervisor so that it would not get out

87
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
of hand, something that was a good decision.

88
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
And three different

89
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
occasions, the officers asked the males

90
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
politely to leave

91
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
the location because they were being asked

92
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
to leave by employees because they were trespassing.

93
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Instead,

94
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
the males continued to refuse

95
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
as they had told the employees previously,

96
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
and they told the officers that they were

97
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
not leaving. When the

98
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
call was initially made, the Starbucks

99
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
employees had told the males that they were

100
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
going to call police and they said, go ahead and call

101
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
police, we don't care. So, police

102
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
get there and they're confronted by the same

103
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
type of attitude and repeatedly

104
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
are told that they're not leaving.

105
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
In fact, there's some alleged rhetoric

106
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
about you don't know what you're doing, you're only

107
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
a $45,000 a year employee

108
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
or something to that regard.

109
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
And so, because these individuals

110
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
refused to leave, because

111
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Starbucks actually called,

112
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
the police did not just happen upon this

113
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
event. They did not just walk into

114
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Starbucks to get coffee. They were

115
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
called there for a service

116
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
and that service had to do with quelling a

117
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
disturbance, a disturbance that had to do

118
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
with trespassing. So,

119
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I need to underscore

120
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
the fact that these males were arrested.

121
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
When they were arrested, they were taken out

122
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
essentially without incident. There was

123
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
no harm done to them. But

124
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
after being transported to the

125
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
police district in the area,

126
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
the officers after processing paperwork

127
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
discovered that Starbucks no longer

128
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
was interested in prosecuting.

129
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
And so, at that point, those

130
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
males were released from custody.

131
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
It is important to emphasize

132
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
and underscore that these officers

133
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
had legal standing to make this arrest.

134
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Again, they were

135
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
called to the scene because employees

136
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
said they were trespassing.

137
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
It is important for me to say

138
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
that, in short, these officers

139
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
did absolutely nothing wrong.

140
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
They followed policy. They did what

141
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
they were supposed to do. They were

142
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
professional in all their dealings with

143
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
these gentlemen. And instead,

144
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
they got the opposite back. I

145
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
will say that as an African-American

146
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
male, I am very aware of implicit

147
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
bias. We are committed

148
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
to fair and unbiased policing

149
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
and anything less than that will not be

150
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
tolerated in this department. Let me

151
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
be very clear. I own no stock

152
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
in Starbucks. I just happen not to even

153
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
ever frequent Starbucks. But I can

154
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
tell you that there was a case

155
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
involving one of our sergeants

156
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
probably a couple years ago who

157
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
went to Starbucks in full uniform

158
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
and he was also denied access

159
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
to the restroom. So they are at least

160
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
consistent in their policy. But he

161
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
ended up cucking, too, and eventually apologized

162
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
for infringing upon these poor

163
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
black men's right to infringe upon the

164
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
rights of others. These innocent victims

165
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
later made an appearance on Good Morning America

166
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
telling their side of this heinous event.

167
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Dante, you both walk in.

168
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
You get a table.

169
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Rashawn, how long was it

170
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
before you asked to use the restroom?

171
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Immediately, as soon as I walked in

172
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
and she

173
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
stated that they were for paying customers only

174
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
and I just left it at that moment.

175
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
And the response was, you have

176
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
to buy something. Yes.

177
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Then you go and find Dante.

178
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
You're at the table. What happened next?

179
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
We're at the table.

180
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
We sit down. We're just talking amongst each other.

181
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
She then

182
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
comes from around the register

183
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
asks, you know,

184
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
walks up to us, asks

185
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
if she can help us with anything.

186
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Can we start with some drinks or water

187
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
or something like that.

188
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
For when we have bottles of water with us,

189
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
so we're fine. We're just

190
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
waiting for a meeting. We'll be out really quick.

191
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
And that was it.

192
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
So approximately 4.35

193
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
you arrive for a 4.45

194
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
business meeting. According to

195
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
911 accounts

196
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
a call was placed at

197
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
4.37

198
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
approximately two minutes after you arrived to

199
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
911. What did you think

200
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
when you saw police arrive

201
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Dante? It can't be

202
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
for us. So when they do approach you

203
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
what do they say and how do you react?

204
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Well initially

205
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
as soon as they approached us

206
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
they just said we have to leave.

207
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
There was no question of, you know,

208
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
was there a problem here

209
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
between you guys and the manager.

210
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
You know, what happened. When you were arrested

211
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
did they tell you what you were being arrested

212
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
for? No, not at the time.

213
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
We wasn't read any rights.

214
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Nothing. Just double lock

215
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
handcuffs behind our back

216
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
escorted out and put into a squad car.

217
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Well the video has

218
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
been viewed almost 11 million

219
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
times and

220
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
part of it Dante, you can see that you're talking

221
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
to the police officer.

222
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
What were you all

223
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
saying to one another?

224
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I was just trying to, you know, process

225
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
the situation to myself at the time

226
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
because I'm thinking about

227
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
my family that I have, my

228
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
community. So in that moment

229
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I'm trying to process what's going on.

230
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
They walk over and they say you have to leave

231
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I say we're here for a meeting.

232
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
What is the business meeting about? It's a real estate

233
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
meeting. We've been working on

234
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
this for months. What do you

235
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
say to some people

236
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
who say rules are rules, that Starbucks

237
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
has a policy, you violated

238
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
that policy. The police asked you

239
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
repeatedly to leave

240
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
and you didn't. How do you respond

241
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
to people who say that? What I say is

242
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I understand that. Rules are rules

243
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
but what's right is right and what's

244
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
wrong is wrong. And that's in any situation.

245
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Whether it's race involved or anything.

246
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Everybody involved in this story

247
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
from Starbucks to the police to the media

248
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
to the verified armbands to those two

249
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
young men themselves are acting like

250
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
these two don't have any personal agency.

251
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
They're acting like when black people misbehave in public

252
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
they aren't responsible for their own actions

253
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
and therefore punishing them for those

254
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
actions is unjust. It's almost

255
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
like they equate black people to unruly

256
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
children that need disciplining by their parents.

257
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
And when the police chief or the Starbucks CEO

258
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
come out and say that it's their fault

259
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
this happened, not the two men in question

260
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
it's like a parent apologizing to a shopkeep

261
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
that their child broke a vase or something.

262
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
There's only one word for considering an

263
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
entire race of people to lack agency

264
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
in this manner. Racism.

265
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
And the worst part about it is there actually are

266
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
instances in the United States in which black

267
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
people are unjustly removed from establishments

268
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
solely because of their race. And these

269
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
legitimate instances of racism are routinely

270
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
overshadowed or underreported

271
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
in comparison to this Starbucks-styled

272
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
shenanigans. For example, let's look at

273
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
this LA Fitness in New Jersey. On April

274
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
16th, 2018, two black

275
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
men went to the gym together. One was a member

276
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
with a membership ID. The other had purchased

277
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
a four-day guest pass. After signing

278
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
in and beginning to work out, an LA Fitness

279
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
employee approached them and told them that

280
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
they needed to pay. After explaining that they had both

281
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
already paid and signed in properly,

282
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
the police were called. One of the black men

283
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
recorded four short videos of the event.

284
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
We got the police here.

285
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Excuse me, what's your name?

286
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
It don't matter, they don't know who you are.

287
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Out here, go ahead and scan that.

288
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
I told you I scanned that with your manager, right?

289
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Go ahead and scan that.

290
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I need to call the police for this.

291
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
He's right here.

292
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
What that say on the screen?

293
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Have a nice day.

294
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Have a nice day.

295
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
LA Fitness Secaucus, again.

296
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
LA Fitness Secaucus, again.

297
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Dude, you're not allowed to film me.

298
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Why not?

299
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Let's figure this out, alright?

300
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
I do want to figure out. We have all these police officers here for what reason?

301
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
We're just here, man.

302
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
We've been having this

303
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
stash for months now.

304
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Several people, not just me. You got several emails from

305
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
corporate about this stuff.

306
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
You guys don't like cell phones. I get it.

307
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
It's not criminal activity. Exactly.

308
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
You're kicking me off the gym for no reason?

309
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
That's how you call it.

310
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
You're kicking me off the gym for no reason?

311
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Ridiculous, man. Working out by myself.

312
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
And this lady, too.

313
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
For no reason.

314
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
For no reason.

315
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Are you with anybody?

316
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
We're the only two black people in the gym.

317
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Let's make this a black thing.

318
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
We're the only two black people in the gym.

319
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
We've been having problems with this stuff for months.

320
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Over nothing. Every time it's something new.

321
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
My contract is being terminated.

322
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
My contract is being terminated.

323
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Because, um...

324
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Because what?

325
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Because what?

326
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
I don't have the answers.

327
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Nobody knows. Nobody knows if my contract is being terminated.

328
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
The manager doesn't like me.

329
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
So, we're going to write the case on me now for you that we came here for a while.

330
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Absolutely. No problem.

331
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Is this even just plain ol' racism?

332
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
It's looking likely.

333
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
And for anybody who thinks that we live in a white supremacist society,

334
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
in this case of actual racism,

335
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
the manager of the LA Fitness and the two employees

336
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
involved have been fired,

337
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
and the victim's membership has been restored.

338
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
So we've got two very similar situations,

339
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
both involving black men getting kicked out

340
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
from privately owned businesses.

341
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
The Starbucks one was legitimate.

342
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
The men weren't customers, they were instead trespassers,

343
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
and the media jumped all over it.

344
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
The LA Fitness one happened at around the same time,

345
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
with a very similar structure of events,

346
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
and a similar demographic of people involved in all positions.

347
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
But it involved an actual instance of racism,

348
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
and the media ignored it.

349
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Why?

350
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Why'd one video go viral, but not the other?

351
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Maybe it's because Starbucks is a more well-known brand

352
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
than LA Fitness,

353
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
and therefore the verification squad could extract

354
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
more sympathy clicks from the story.

355
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Maybe it's because Starbucks is already hipster soy boy mecca,

356
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
where these ideas naturally have fertile ground.

357
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Maybe it's because gyms are generally avoided

358
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
by the radical left,

359
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
by low testosterone levels,

360
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
and fat oppression theory.

361
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Or maybe it's because ultimately the media is more interested

362
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
in fabricated and controlled stories of fake racism

363
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
than actual racism.

364
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Maybe it's because the wells of money, outrage,

365
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
and viewers are more easily exploited

366
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
when the narrative can be controlled,

367
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
when the villains are willing to play ball

368
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
by kowtowing themselves to social justice principles,

369
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
and the heroes are just good boys going to college

370
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
never done nothing wrong.

371
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
There's a strong strand of belligerence

372
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
within the black subculture in America,

373
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
I think people have not only a moral right

374
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
but a moral obligation to rebel against tyranny.

375
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
But was Starbucks acting in a tyrannical manner

376
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
when they asked two people

377
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
that refused to buy anything to leave?

378
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
If you think they were, it's likely because

379
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
you don't respect the property rights of Starbucks,

380
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
and that actually makes a fair amount of sense

381
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
given the people who protested this event.

382
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
But there's a gigantic gap between the moral obligation

383
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
to rebel against tyranny and the amount of belligerence

384
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
within America's black subculture.

385
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
I mean, look at it from this point of view.

386
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Let's say you're one of these two black men.

387
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
You ask Starbucks for a meeting to be held in 10 minutes time.

388
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
The meeting is, as they themselves described,

389
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
a real estate meeting that will change your life.

390
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
A manager comes over and says

391
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
you need to buy something or leave.

392
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Why wouldn't you just buy a coffee?

393
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Why would you just simply be belligerent

394
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
both to the manager and to the officers

395
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
that arrived in the scene?

396
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Why jeopardize everything?

397
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Some people have already made up their minds about this.

398
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
They did it because the whole thing is fake news.

399
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
It's a false flag operation.

400
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
It was set up by the SJWs to make Starbucks look racist.

401
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
They can show how progressive they are or whatever.

402
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
There's no evidence for any of this.

403
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
And these theories are honestly a little bit out there.

404
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
I have no evidence for my theory either.

405
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
It's just a hunch.

406
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
But I think it's because the subculture these guys were raised in

407
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
is one in which belligerence,

408
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
whether or not it's justified,

409
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
is used as a currency in place of wealth or attractiveness.

410
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
We're going down the rabbit hole here a little bit,

411
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
but that's okay.

412
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
The black population of the US is around 13%.

413
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Despite this, black people commit

414
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
significantly more than their share of crime.

415
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
They commit 51% of America's murders,

416
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
30% of America's rapes,

417
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
56% of its robberies,

418
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
33% of its aggravated assaults,

419
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
and the list goes on.

420
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Overall, 28% of people arrested in the United States are black.

421
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
All of these numbers are huge overrepresentations

422
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
from the 13% black population.

423
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Some people would say it's because of racism,

424
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
that they're more likely to arrest black people

425
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
for things that they let white people off with a warning,

426
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
that they're more likely to over-police black neighborhoods,

427
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
and even that they're more likely to simply

428
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
fabricate cases against innocent black people.

429
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
I'm not saying this doesn't happen.

430
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Clearly, there are instances of police brutality in the States.

431
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
But 100 years ago, Chinese communities

432
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
had huge problems with the police,

433
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
on par with the black community, and now they don't.

434
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Jewish communities had huge problems with the police,

435
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
and now they don't.

436
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Italian communities had massive problems with the police,

437
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
and now they don't.

438
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Nowadays, Latino communities have huge problems with the police,

439
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
but still not nearly as large as black communities,

440
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
despite the cultural stereotype

441
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
of the illegal immigrant Mexican cartel member.

442
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
If America is a white supremacy,

443
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
and every single one of these statistics

444
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
is explained by racism,

445
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
why is it that of all the immigrant communities,

446
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
it's only the black community

447
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
that isn't getting any better over time?

448
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
The alt-right will say it's genetics.

449
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
The alt-right is stupid.

450
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
I personally think it's the subculture of belligerence.

451
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
32% of all black families with children

452
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
live below the poverty line,

453
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
and 58% of black children don't live with their biological fathers.

454
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
The black community is extremely impoverished,

455
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
and in the absence of money,

456
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
belligerence becomes the de facto social currency.

457
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
This poverty is compounded by a lack of a stable home life,

458
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
a lack of a father figure,

459
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
and a lack of resources and money that a second parent would provide.

460
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
And in the absence of any other resource,

461
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
the only form of advancement left to these kids

462
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
is belligerence.

463
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Be the meanest, baddest dude around

464
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
so nobody would dare fuck with you.

465
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
And eventually, that belligerence escalates into violence,

466
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
it escalates into crime,

467
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
it escalates into gang membership,

468
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
it escalates into all the things that we see

469
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
black adults overrepresented in.

470
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
It's clear to me that what would help the poorest of black people

471
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
is a stable nuclear family situation.

472
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Even if these families lived in grinding poverty,

473
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
the addition of a second adult to the mix

474
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
means a second income,

475
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
a second pair of hands to deal with raising kids,

476
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
and a second perspective on problems that may arise.

477
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
So, now we have to ask,

478
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
why aren't black men making an effort

479
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
to keep the families that they start intact?

480
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
I don't know the answer to this one.

481
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Maybe it's because feminism's advocacy for the destruction of the nuclear family

482
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
has actually come to pass in the black community

483
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
with devastating intergenerational consequences.

484
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Maybe it's because the echoes of slavery

485
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
are still at play culturally,

486
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
where black slaves didn't care about their kids

487
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
since those kids would just be sold off by their masters.

488
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
And that attitude stuck around culturally in a diminished form.

489
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Maybe it's because the black men of today

490
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
were raised in the exact type of dysfunctional household

491
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
that they're creating

492
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
and simply don't know anything other than having kids with women

493
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
that they're not interested in building a family with.

494
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
What I do know is that this problem

495
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
can only be solved by black people.

496
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
It can only be solved by black people

497
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
making responsible choices about their lives

498
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
and not blaming the government or Whitey

499
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
or anybody else for the mistakes they make.

500
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
I don't know if there's any impoverished

501
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
poor black kids listening to this.

502
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
There probably isn't.

503
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
But just in case there is, it doesn't matter if your friends

504
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
think you're white on the inside

505
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
or not acting black enough

506
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
if you'd rather study or practice instead of fool around.

507
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
It doesn't matter if your family thinks it's a betrayal to them

508
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
or your people or whatever

509
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
if you'd rather leave the ghetto instead of live there your entire life.

510
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
They're saying that shit because they don't want you to get better.

511
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
They want you to stick around in the hood with them

512
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
because you're a part of their social capital.

513
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
If you go, they're losing a resource, not a person.

514
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
If the choice is to listen to the belligerence of black subculture

515
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
or improve your lives

516
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
well, I know which one I'd pick.

517
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
We're way off topic here

518
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
and I know a lot of this is just me shooting the shit

519
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
but I really think that the belligerence of black subculture

520
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
is what caused this entire Starbucks mess

521
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
on some level.

522
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
These two young men probably walked into the cafe

523
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
with an attitude of entitlement.

524
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
The rules didn't apply to them

525
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
and they'd tell anybody who challenged them on this to fuck off.

526
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Why not? It's worked for them before.

527
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Oh shit, it's not working for them now. It must be racism, right?

528
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
And the worst part is

529
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
people who accurately understand all of this

530
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
the black prevalence of crime, black poverty

531
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
and fatherlessness and so on

532
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
and then use this information to assume that all black people

533
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
are going to be a problem anytime they encounter one

534
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
are actually racists

535
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
which is likely what happened at the LA Fitness.

536
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
We can use this information to understand

537
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
probably, why Rashawn Nelson and Dante Robinson

538
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
acted as contrarian as they did

539
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
in the Starbucks after the fact

540
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
but we cannot use it to assume that any random

541
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
black person will be contrarian in the future.

542
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
That's the difference between the social justice definition

543
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
of racism and racism in the real world.
