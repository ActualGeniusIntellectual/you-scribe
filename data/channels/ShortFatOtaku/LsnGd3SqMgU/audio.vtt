00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
Don't get no fight with them.

00:02.000 --> 00:04.000
Don't get no fight with them.

00:04.000 --> 00:06.000
Are you talking to them?

00:06.000 --> 00:08.000
Yeah, I'm eating them.

00:08.000 --> 00:10.000
It's ridiculous.

00:10.000 --> 00:12.000
Yeah, this is ridiculous.

00:12.000 --> 00:14.000
What did they get called for?

00:14.000 --> 00:16.000
Because there were two black guys sitting here meeting me?

00:16.000 --> 00:18.000
Well, what did they do?

00:18.000 --> 00:20.000
What did they do? Someone told me what they did.

00:20.000 --> 00:22.000
They didn't do anything. I saw the entire thing.

00:22.000 --> 00:24.000
What did they do?

00:24.000 --> 00:26.000
The moment says,

00:26.000 --> 00:28.000
for any customer,

00:28.000 --> 00:30.000
they can do anything.

00:50.000 --> 00:52.000
As you've seen at the beginning of this video,

00:52.000 --> 00:54.000
and as you've probably heard about all over the internet by now,

00:54.000 --> 00:56.000
on April 12th, 2018,

00:56.000 --> 00:58.000
two black men were arrested for trespassing within a Starbucks

00:58.000 --> 01:00.000
while waiting for a business associate of theirs to arrive.

01:00.000 --> 01:02.000
The business associate in question

01:02.000 --> 01:04.000
is the white guy in the video

01:04.000 --> 01:06.000
asking the police why the two black men are being arrested.

01:06.000 --> 01:08.000
The manager who called the police

01:08.000 --> 01:10.000
stated in the 911 call

01:10.000 --> 01:12.000
that the two men sat down

01:12.000 --> 01:14.000
and refused to buy anything or leave the premises.

01:14.000 --> 01:16.000
That same manager later quit her job,

01:16.000 --> 01:18.000
presumably due to the blowback received from this event.

01:18.000 --> 01:20.000
On Twitter, Starbucks apologized

01:20.000 --> 01:22.000
for exercising their legal rights

01:22.000 --> 01:24.000
against non-customers trespassing

01:24.000 --> 01:26.000
on their private property.

01:26.000 --> 01:28.000
On April 12th, 2018,

01:28.000 --> 01:30.000
two black men were arrested

01:30.000 --> 01:32.000
for trespassing

01:32.000 --> 01:34.000
while waiting for a business associate

01:34.000 --> 01:36.000
to arrive.

01:36.000 --> 01:38.000
On April 12th, 2018,

01:38.000 --> 01:40.000
two black men were arrested

01:40.000 --> 01:42.000
for trespassing

01:42.000 --> 01:44.000
against non-customers trespassing

01:44.000 --> 01:46.000
on their private property.

01:46.000 --> 01:48.000
The CEO of Starbucks even made the rounds in the morning news,

01:48.000 --> 01:50.000
offering sincere apologies

01:50.000 --> 01:52.000
that one of his employees would dare assert their rights

01:52.000 --> 01:54.000
against a person of color.

01:54.000 --> 01:56.000
Philadelphia's police commissioner released a video

01:56.000 --> 01:58.000
in which he defended the legal actions of his officers.

01:58.000 --> 02:00.000
On Thursday, at about 4.40,

02:00.000 --> 02:02.000
police received a 911 call

02:02.000 --> 02:04.000
for a disturbance

02:04.000 --> 02:06.000
and trespassing.

02:06.000 --> 02:08.000
When the police arrived,

02:08.000 --> 02:10.000
they were met by Starbucks employees

02:10.000 --> 02:12.000
who said that two males were trespassing

02:12.000 --> 02:14.000
and had refused to leave the establishment.

02:14.000 --> 02:16.000
According to employees,

02:16.000 --> 02:18.000
they had seen these two males

02:18.000 --> 02:20.000
come in, they sat down,

02:20.000 --> 02:22.000
and after being seated,

02:22.000 --> 02:24.000
they decided that they needed to use the restroom.

02:24.000 --> 02:26.000
Starbucks said that

02:26.000 --> 02:28.000
according to their company policy,

02:28.000 --> 02:30.000
they do not allow

02:30.000 --> 02:32.000
nonpaying members

02:32.000 --> 02:34.000
or nonpaying people

02:34.000 --> 02:36.000
of the public to come in

02:36.000 --> 02:38.000
and use the restroom.

02:38.000 --> 02:40.000
And so,

02:40.000 --> 02:42.000
they then asked these two males

02:42.000 --> 02:44.000
to leave, these two males

02:44.000 --> 02:46.000
refused to leave,

02:46.000 --> 02:48.000
and the police were called.

02:48.000 --> 02:50.000
Now, when the police were

02:50.000 --> 02:52.000
summoned to the scene,

02:52.000 --> 02:54.000
they get there and they get this story

02:54.000 --> 02:56.000
that I just began to outline.

02:56.000 --> 02:58.000
They then approached the males,

02:58.000 --> 03:00.000
they asked the males to leave

03:00.000 --> 03:02.000
because they're being

03:02.000 --> 03:04.000
asked to leave by Starbucks

03:04.000 --> 03:06.000
employees. In fact,

03:06.000 --> 03:08.000
in an effort to quell the situation,

03:08.000 --> 03:10.000
officers actually called for a

03:10.000 --> 03:12.000
supervisor so that it would not get out

03:12.000 --> 03:14.000
of hand, something that was a good decision.

03:14.000 --> 03:16.000
And three different

03:16.000 --> 03:18.000
occasions, the officers asked the males

03:18.000 --> 03:20.000
politely to leave

03:20.000 --> 03:22.000
the location because they were being asked

03:22.000 --> 03:24.000
to leave by employees because they were trespassing.

03:24.000 --> 03:26.000
Instead,

03:26.000 --> 03:28.000
the males continued to refuse

03:28.000 --> 03:30.000
as they had told the employees previously,

03:30.000 --> 03:32.000
and they told the officers that they were

03:32.000 --> 03:34.000
not leaving. When the

03:34.000 --> 03:36.000
call was initially made, the Starbucks

03:36.000 --> 03:38.000
employees had told the males that they were

03:38.000 --> 03:40.000
going to call police and they said, go ahead and call

03:40.000 --> 03:42.000
police, we don't care. So, police

03:42.000 --> 03:44.000
get there and they're confronted by the same

03:44.000 --> 03:46.000
type of attitude and repeatedly

03:46.000 --> 03:48.000
are told that they're not leaving.

03:48.000 --> 03:50.000
In fact, there's some alleged rhetoric

03:50.000 --> 03:52.000
about you don't know what you're doing, you're only

03:52.000 --> 03:54.000
a $45,000 a year employee

03:54.000 --> 03:56.000
or something to that regard.

03:56.000 --> 03:58.000
And so, because these individuals

03:58.000 --> 04:00.000
refused to leave, because

04:00.000 --> 04:02.000
Starbucks actually called,

04:02.000 --> 04:04.000
the police did not just happen upon this

04:04.000 --> 04:06.000
event. They did not just walk into

04:06.000 --> 04:08.000
Starbucks to get coffee. They were

04:08.000 --> 04:10.000
called there for a service

04:10.000 --> 04:12.000
and that service had to do with quelling a

04:12.000 --> 04:14.000
disturbance, a disturbance that had to do

04:14.000 --> 04:16.000
with trespassing. So,

04:16.000 --> 04:18.000
I need to underscore

04:18.000 --> 04:20.000
the fact that these males were arrested.

04:20.000 --> 04:22.000
When they were arrested, they were taken out

04:22.000 --> 04:24.000
essentially without incident. There was

04:24.000 --> 04:26.000
no harm done to them. But

04:26.000 --> 04:28.000
after being transported to the

04:28.000 --> 04:30.000
police district in the area,

04:30.000 --> 04:32.000
the officers after processing paperwork

04:32.000 --> 04:34.000
discovered that Starbucks no longer

04:34.000 --> 04:36.000
was interested in prosecuting.

04:36.000 --> 04:38.000
And so, at that point, those

04:38.000 --> 04:40.000
males were released from custody.

04:40.000 --> 04:42.000
It is important to emphasize

04:42.000 --> 04:44.000
and underscore that these officers

04:44.000 --> 04:46.000
had legal standing to make this arrest.

04:46.000 --> 04:48.000
Again, they were

04:48.000 --> 04:50.000
called to the scene because employees

04:50.000 --> 04:52.000
said they were trespassing.

04:52.000 --> 04:54.000
It is important for me to say

04:54.000 --> 04:56.000
that, in short, these officers

04:56.000 --> 04:58.000
did absolutely nothing wrong.

04:58.000 --> 05:00.000
They followed policy. They did what

05:00.000 --> 05:02.000
they were supposed to do. They were

05:02.000 --> 05:04.000
professional in all their dealings with

05:04.000 --> 05:06.000
these gentlemen. And instead,

05:06.000 --> 05:08.000
they got the opposite back. I

05:08.000 --> 05:10.000
will say that as an African-American

05:10.000 --> 05:12.000
male, I am very aware of implicit

05:12.000 --> 05:14.000
bias. We are committed

05:14.000 --> 05:16.000
to fair and unbiased policing

05:16.000 --> 05:18.000
and anything less than that will not be

05:18.000 --> 05:20.000
tolerated in this department. Let me

05:20.000 --> 05:22.000
be very clear. I own no stock

05:22.000 --> 05:24.000
in Starbucks. I just happen not to even

05:24.000 --> 05:26.000
ever frequent Starbucks. But I can

05:26.000 --> 05:28.000
tell you that there was a case

05:28.000 --> 05:30.000
involving one of our sergeants

05:30.000 --> 05:32.000
probably a couple years ago who

05:32.000 --> 05:34.000
went to Starbucks in full uniform

05:34.000 --> 05:36.000
and he was also denied access

05:36.000 --> 05:38.000
to the restroom. So they are at least

05:38.000 --> 05:40.000
consistent in their policy. But he

05:40.000 --> 05:42.000
ended up cucking, too, and eventually apologized

05:42.000 --> 05:44.000
for infringing upon these poor

05:44.000 --> 05:46.000
black men's right to infringe upon the

05:46.000 --> 05:48.000
rights of others. These innocent victims

05:48.000 --> 05:50.000
later made an appearance on Good Morning America

05:50.000 --> 05:52.000
telling their side of this heinous event.

05:52.000 --> 05:54.000
Dante, you both walk in.

05:54.000 --> 05:56.000
You get a table.

05:56.000 --> 05:58.000
Rashawn, how long was it

05:58.000 --> 06:00.000
before you asked to use the restroom?

06:00.000 --> 06:02.000
Immediately, as soon as I walked in

06:02.000 --> 06:04.000
and she

06:04.000 --> 06:06.000
stated that they were for paying customers only

06:06.000 --> 06:08.000
and I just left it at that moment.

06:08.000 --> 06:10.000
And the response was, you have

06:10.000 --> 06:12.000
to buy something. Yes.

06:12.000 --> 06:14.000
Then you go and find Dante.

06:14.000 --> 06:16.000
You're at the table. What happened next?

06:18.000 --> 06:20.000
We're at the table.

06:20.000 --> 06:22.000
We sit down. We're just talking amongst each other.

06:22.000 --> 06:24.000
She then

06:24.000 --> 06:26.000
comes from around the register

06:26.000 --> 06:28.000
asks, you know,

06:28.000 --> 06:30.000
walks up to us, asks

06:30.000 --> 06:32.000
if she can help us with anything.

06:32.000 --> 06:34.000
Can we start with some drinks or water

06:34.000 --> 06:36.000
or something like that.

06:36.000 --> 06:38.000
For when we have bottles of water with us,

06:38.000 --> 06:40.000
so we're fine. We're just

06:40.000 --> 06:42.000
waiting for a meeting. We'll be out really quick.

06:42.000 --> 06:44.000
And that was it.

06:44.000 --> 06:46.000
So approximately 4.35

06:46.000 --> 06:48.000
you arrive for a 4.45

06:48.000 --> 06:50.000
business meeting. According to

06:50.000 --> 06:52.000
911 accounts

06:52.000 --> 06:54.000
a call was placed at

06:54.000 --> 06:56.000
4.37

06:56.000 --> 06:58.000
approximately two minutes after you arrived to

06:58.000 --> 07:00.000
911. What did you think

07:00.000 --> 07:02.000
when you saw police arrive

07:02.000 --> 07:04.000
Dante? It can't be

07:04.000 --> 07:06.000
for us. So when they do approach you

07:06.000 --> 07:08.000
what do they say and how do you react?

07:08.000 --> 07:10.000
Well initially

07:10.000 --> 07:12.000
as soon as they approached us

07:12.000 --> 07:14.000
they just said we have to leave.

07:14.000 --> 07:16.000
There was no question of, you know,

07:16.000 --> 07:18.000
was there a problem here

07:18.000 --> 07:20.000
between you guys and the manager.

07:20.000 --> 07:22.000
You know, what happened. When you were arrested

07:22.000 --> 07:24.000
did they tell you what you were being arrested

07:24.000 --> 07:26.000
for? No, not at the time.

07:26.000 --> 07:28.000
We wasn't read any rights.

07:28.000 --> 07:30.000
Nothing. Just double lock

07:30.000 --> 07:32.000
handcuffs behind our back

07:32.000 --> 07:34.000
escorted out and put into a squad car.

07:34.000 --> 07:36.000
Well the video has

07:36.000 --> 07:38.000
been viewed almost 11 million

07:38.000 --> 07:40.000
times and

07:40.000 --> 07:42.000
part of it Dante, you can see that you're talking

07:42.000 --> 07:44.000
to the police officer.

07:44.000 --> 07:46.000
What were you all

07:46.000 --> 07:48.000
saying to one another?

07:48.000 --> 07:50.000
I was just trying to, you know, process

07:50.000 --> 07:52.000
the situation to myself at the time

07:52.000 --> 07:54.000
because I'm thinking about

07:54.000 --> 07:56.000
my family that I have, my

07:56.000 --> 07:58.000
community. So in that moment

07:58.000 --> 08:00.000
I'm trying to process what's going on.

08:00.000 --> 08:02.000
They walk over and they say you have to leave

08:02.000 --> 08:04.000
I say we're here for a meeting.

08:04.000 --> 08:06.000
What is the business meeting about? It's a real estate

08:06.000 --> 08:08.000
meeting. We've been working on

08:08.000 --> 08:10.000
this for months. What do you

08:10.000 --> 08:12.000
say to some people

08:12.000 --> 08:14.000
who say rules are rules, that Starbucks

08:14.000 --> 08:16.000
has a policy, you violated

08:16.000 --> 08:18.000
that policy. The police asked you

08:18.000 --> 08:20.000
repeatedly to leave

08:20.000 --> 08:22.000
and you didn't. How do you respond

08:22.000 --> 08:24.000
to people who say that? What I say is

08:24.000 --> 08:26.000
I understand that. Rules are rules

08:26.000 --> 08:28.000
but what's right is right and what's

08:28.000 --> 08:30.000
wrong is wrong. And that's in any situation.

08:30.000 --> 08:32.000
Whether it's race involved or anything.

08:32.000 --> 08:34.000
Everybody involved in this story

08:34.000 --> 08:36.000
from Starbucks to the police to the media

08:36.000 --> 08:38.000
to the verified armbands to those two

08:38.000 --> 08:40.000
young men themselves are acting like

08:40.000 --> 08:42.000
these two don't have any personal agency.

08:42.000 --> 08:44.000
They're acting like when black people misbehave in public

08:44.000 --> 08:46.000
they aren't responsible for their own actions

08:46.000 --> 08:48.000
and therefore punishing them for those

08:48.000 --> 08:50.000
actions is unjust. It's almost

08:50.000 --> 08:52.000
like they equate black people to unruly

08:52.000 --> 08:54.000
children that need disciplining by their parents.

08:54.000 --> 08:56.000
And when the police chief or the Starbucks CEO

08:56.000 --> 08:58.000
come out and say that it's their fault

08:58.000 --> 09:00.000
this happened, not the two men in question

09:00.000 --> 09:02.000
it's like a parent apologizing to a shopkeep

09:02.000 --> 09:04.000
that their child broke a vase or something.

09:04.000 --> 09:06.000
There's only one word for considering an

09:06.000 --> 09:08.000
entire race of people to lack agency

09:08.000 --> 09:10.000
in this manner. Racism.

09:10.000 --> 09:12.000
And the worst part about it is there actually are

09:12.000 --> 09:14.000
instances in the United States in which black

09:14.000 --> 09:16.000
people are unjustly removed from establishments

09:16.000 --> 09:18.000
solely because of their race. And these

09:18.000 --> 09:20.000
legitimate instances of racism are routinely

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
overshadowed or underreported

09:22.000 --> 09:24.000
in comparison to this Starbucks-styled

09:24.000 --> 09:26.000
shenanigans. For example, let's look at

09:26.000 --> 09:28.000
this LA Fitness in New Jersey. On April

09:28.000 --> 09:30.000
16th, 2018, two black

09:30.000 --> 09:32.000
men went to the gym together. One was a member

09:32.000 --> 09:34.000
with a membership ID. The other had purchased

09:34.000 --> 09:36.000
a four-day guest pass. After signing

09:36.000 --> 09:38.000
in and beginning to work out, an LA Fitness

09:38.000 --> 09:40.000
employee approached them and told them that

09:40.000 --> 09:42.000
they needed to pay. After explaining that they had both

09:42.000 --> 09:44.000
already paid and signed in properly,

09:44.000 --> 09:46.000
the police were called. One of the black men

09:46.000 --> 09:48.000
recorded four short videos of the event.

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
We got the police here.

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
Excuse me, what's your name?

10:16.000 --> 10:18.000
It don't matter, they don't know who you are.

10:18.000 --> 10:20.000
Out here, go ahead and scan that.

10:20.000 --> 10:22.000
I told you I scanned that with your manager, right?

10:22.000 --> 10:24.000
Go ahead and scan that.

10:28.000 --> 10:30.000
I need to call the police for this.

10:30.000 --> 10:32.000
He's right here.

10:32.000 --> 10:34.000
What that say on the screen?

10:34.000 --> 10:36.000
Have a nice day.

10:36.000 --> 10:38.000
Have a nice day.

10:38.000 --> 10:40.000
LA Fitness Secaucus, again.

10:40.000 --> 10:42.000
LA Fitness Secaucus, again.

10:42.000 --> 10:44.000
Dude, you're not allowed to film me.

10:44.000 --> 10:46.000
Why not?

10:46.000 --> 10:48.000
Let's figure this out, alright?

10:48.000 --> 10:50.000
I do want to figure out. We have all these police officers here for what reason?

10:50.000 --> 10:52.000
We're just here, man.

10:52.000 --> 10:54.000
We've been having this

10:54.000 --> 10:56.000
stash for months now.

10:56.000 --> 10:58.000
Several people, not just me. You got several emails from

10:58.000 --> 11:00.000
corporate about this stuff.

11:00.000 --> 11:02.000
You guys don't like cell phones. I get it.

11:02.000 --> 11:04.000
It's not criminal activity. Exactly.

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
You're kicking me off the gym for no reason?

11:06.000 --> 11:08.000
That's how you call it.

11:08.000 --> 11:10.000
You're kicking me off the gym for no reason?

11:10.000 --> 11:12.000
Ridiculous, man. Working out by myself.

11:12.000 --> 11:14.000
And this lady, too.

11:20.000 --> 11:22.000
For no reason.

11:22.000 --> 11:24.000
For no reason.

11:24.000 --> 11:26.000
Are you with anybody?

11:28.000 --> 11:30.000
We're the only two black people in the gym.

11:30.000 --> 11:32.000
Let's make this a black thing.

11:32.000 --> 11:34.000
We're the only two black people in the gym.

11:34.000 --> 11:36.000
We've been having problems with this stuff for months.

11:36.000 --> 11:38.000
Over nothing. Every time it's something new.

11:44.000 --> 11:46.000
My contract is being terminated.

11:46.000 --> 11:48.000
My contract is being terminated.

11:48.000 --> 11:50.000
Because, um...

11:50.000 --> 11:52.000
Because what?

11:52.000 --> 11:54.000
Because what?

11:54.000 --> 11:56.000
I don't have the answers.

11:56.000 --> 11:58.000
Nobody knows. Nobody knows if my contract is being terminated.

11:58.000 --> 12:00.000
The manager doesn't like me.

12:00.000 --> 12:02.000
So, we're going to write the case on me now for you that we came here for a while.

12:02.000 --> 12:04.000
Absolutely. No problem.

12:30.000 --> 12:32.000
Is this even just plain ol' racism?

12:32.000 --> 12:34.000
It's looking likely.

12:34.000 --> 12:36.000
And for anybody who thinks that we live in a white supremacist society,

12:36.000 --> 12:38.000
in this case of actual racism,

12:38.000 --> 12:40.000
the manager of the LA Fitness and the two employees

12:40.000 --> 12:42.000
involved have been fired,

12:42.000 --> 12:44.000
and the victim's membership has been restored.

12:44.000 --> 12:46.000
So we've got two very similar situations,

12:46.000 --> 12:48.000
both involving black men getting kicked out

12:48.000 --> 12:50.000
from privately owned businesses.

12:50.000 --> 12:52.000
The Starbucks one was legitimate.

12:52.000 --> 12:54.000
The men weren't customers, they were instead trespassers,

12:54.000 --> 12:56.000
and the media jumped all over it.

12:56.000 --> 12:58.000
The LA Fitness one happened at around the same time,

12:58.000 --> 13:00.000
with a very similar structure of events,

13:00.000 --> 13:02.000
and a similar demographic of people involved in all positions.

13:02.000 --> 13:04.000
But it involved an actual instance of racism,

13:04.000 --> 13:06.000
and the media ignored it.

13:06.000 --> 13:08.000
Why?

13:08.000 --> 13:10.000
Why'd one video go viral, but not the other?

13:10.000 --> 13:12.000
Maybe it's because Starbucks is a more well-known brand

13:12.000 --> 13:14.000
than LA Fitness,

13:14.000 --> 13:16.000
and therefore the verification squad could extract

13:16.000 --> 13:18.000
more sympathy clicks from the story.

13:18.000 --> 13:20.000
Maybe it's because Starbucks is already hipster soy boy mecca,

13:20.000 --> 13:22.000
where these ideas naturally have fertile ground.

13:22.000 --> 13:24.000
Maybe it's because gyms are generally avoided

13:24.000 --> 13:26.000
by the radical left,

13:26.000 --> 13:28.000
by low testosterone levels,

13:28.000 --> 13:30.000
and fat oppression theory.

13:30.000 --> 13:32.000
Or maybe it's because ultimately the media is more interested

13:32.000 --> 13:34.000
in fabricated and controlled stories of fake racism

13:34.000 --> 13:36.000
than actual racism.

13:36.000 --> 13:38.000
Maybe it's because the wells of money, outrage,

13:38.000 --> 13:40.000
and viewers are more easily exploited

13:40.000 --> 13:42.000
when the narrative can be controlled,

13:42.000 --> 13:44.000
when the villains are willing to play ball

13:44.000 --> 13:46.000
by kowtowing themselves to social justice principles,

13:46.000 --> 13:48.000
and the heroes are just good boys going to college

13:48.000 --> 13:50.000
never done nothing wrong.

13:50.000 --> 13:52.000
There's a strong strand of belligerence

13:52.000 --> 13:54.000
within the black subculture in America,

13:54.000 --> 13:56.000
I think people have not only a moral right

13:56.000 --> 13:58.000
but a moral obligation to rebel against tyranny.

13:58.000 --> 14:00.000
But was Starbucks acting in a tyrannical manner

14:00.000 --> 14:02.000
when they asked two people

14:02.000 --> 14:04.000
that refused to buy anything to leave?

14:04.000 --> 14:06.000
If you think they were, it's likely because

14:06.000 --> 14:08.000
you don't respect the property rights of Starbucks,

14:08.000 --> 14:10.000
and that actually makes a fair amount of sense

14:10.000 --> 14:12.000
given the people who protested this event.

14:12.000 --> 14:14.000
But there's a gigantic gap between the moral obligation

14:14.000 --> 14:16.000
to rebel against tyranny and the amount of belligerence

14:16.000 --> 14:18.000
within America's black subculture.

14:18.000 --> 14:20.000
I mean, look at it from this point of view.

14:20.000 --> 14:22.000
Let's say you're one of these two black men.

14:22.000 --> 14:24.000
You ask Starbucks for a meeting to be held in 10 minutes time.

14:24.000 --> 14:26.000
The meeting is, as they themselves described,

14:26.000 --> 14:28.000
a real estate meeting that will change your life.

14:28.000 --> 14:30.000
A manager comes over and says

14:30.000 --> 14:32.000
you need to buy something or leave.

14:32.000 --> 14:34.000
Why wouldn't you just buy a coffee?

14:34.000 --> 14:36.000
Why would you just simply be belligerent

14:36.000 --> 14:38.000
both to the manager and to the officers

14:38.000 --> 14:40.000
that arrived in the scene?

14:40.000 --> 14:42.000
Why jeopardize everything?

14:42.000 --> 14:44.000
Some people have already made up their minds about this.

14:44.000 --> 14:46.000
They did it because the whole thing is fake news.

14:46.000 --> 14:48.000
It's a false flag operation.

14:48.000 --> 14:50.000
It was set up by the SJWs to make Starbucks look racist.

14:50.000 --> 14:52.000
They can show how progressive they are or whatever.

14:52.000 --> 14:54.000
There's no evidence for any of this.

14:54.000 --> 14:56.000
And these theories are honestly a little bit out there.

14:56.000 --> 14:58.000
I have no evidence for my theory either.

14:58.000 --> 15:00.000
It's just a hunch.

15:00.000 --> 15:02.000
But I think it's because the subculture these guys were raised in

15:02.000 --> 15:04.000
is one in which belligerence,

15:04.000 --> 15:06.000
whether or not it's justified,

15:06.000 --> 15:08.000
is used as a currency in place of wealth or attractiveness.

15:08.000 --> 15:10.000
We're going down the rabbit hole here a little bit,

15:10.000 --> 15:12.000
but that's okay.

15:12.000 --> 15:14.000
The black population of the US is around 13%.

15:14.000 --> 15:16.000
Despite this, black people commit

15:16.000 --> 15:18.000
significantly more than their share of crime.

15:18.000 --> 15:20.000
They commit 51% of America's murders,

15:20.000 --> 15:22.000
30% of America's rapes,

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
56% of its robberies,

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
33% of its aggravated assaults,

15:26.000 --> 15:28.000
and the list goes on.

15:28.000 --> 15:30.000
Overall, 28% of people arrested in the United States are black.

15:30.000 --> 15:32.000
All of these numbers are huge overrepresentations

15:32.000 --> 15:34.000
from the 13% black population.

15:34.000 --> 15:36.000
Some people would say it's because of racism,

15:36.000 --> 15:38.000
that they're more likely to arrest black people

15:38.000 --> 15:40.000
for things that they let white people off with a warning,

15:40.000 --> 15:42.000
that they're more likely to over-police black neighborhoods,

15:42.000 --> 15:44.000
and even that they're more likely to simply

15:44.000 --> 15:46.000
fabricate cases against innocent black people.

15:46.000 --> 15:48.000
I'm not saying this doesn't happen.

15:48.000 --> 15:50.000
Clearly, there are instances of police brutality in the States.

15:50.000 --> 15:52.000
But 100 years ago, Chinese communities

15:52.000 --> 15:54.000
had huge problems with the police,

15:54.000 --> 15:56.000
on par with the black community, and now they don't.

15:56.000 --> 15:58.000
Jewish communities had huge problems with the police,

15:58.000 --> 16:00.000
and now they don't.

16:00.000 --> 16:02.000
Italian communities had massive problems with the police,

16:02.000 --> 16:04.000
and now they don't.

16:04.000 --> 16:06.000
Nowadays, Latino communities have huge problems with the police,

16:06.000 --> 16:08.000
but still not nearly as large as black communities,

16:08.000 --> 16:10.000
despite the cultural stereotype

16:10.000 --> 16:12.000
of the illegal immigrant Mexican cartel member.

16:12.000 --> 16:14.000
If America is a white supremacy,

16:14.000 --> 16:16.000
and every single one of these statistics

16:16.000 --> 16:18.000
is explained by racism,

16:18.000 --> 16:20.000
why is it that of all the immigrant communities,

16:20.000 --> 16:22.000
it's only the black community

16:22.000 --> 16:24.000
that isn't getting any better over time?

16:24.000 --> 16:26.000
The alt-right will say it's genetics.

16:26.000 --> 16:28.000
The alt-right is stupid.

16:28.000 --> 16:30.000
I personally think it's the subculture of belligerence.

16:30.000 --> 16:32.000
32% of all black families with children

16:32.000 --> 16:34.000
live below the poverty line,

16:34.000 --> 16:36.000
and 58% of black children don't live with their biological fathers.

16:36.000 --> 16:38.000
The black community is extremely impoverished,

16:38.000 --> 16:40.000
and in the absence of money,

16:40.000 --> 16:42.000
belligerence becomes the de facto social currency.

16:42.000 --> 16:44.000
This poverty is compounded by a lack of a stable home life,

16:44.000 --> 16:46.000
a lack of a father figure,

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000
and a lack of resources and money that a second parent would provide.

16:48.000 --> 16:50.000
And in the absence of any other resource,

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
the only form of advancement left to these kids

16:52.000 --> 16:54.000
is belligerence.

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000
Be the meanest, baddest dude around

16:56.000 --> 16:58.000
so nobody would dare fuck with you.

16:58.000 --> 17:00.000
And eventually, that belligerence escalates into violence,

17:00.000 --> 17:02.000
it escalates into crime,

17:02.000 --> 17:04.000
it escalates into gang membership,

17:04.000 --> 17:06.000
it escalates into all the things that we see

17:06.000 --> 17:08.000
black adults overrepresented in.

17:08.000 --> 17:10.000
It's clear to me that what would help the poorest of black people

17:10.000 --> 17:12.000
is a stable nuclear family situation.

17:12.000 --> 17:14.000
Even if these families lived in grinding poverty,

17:14.000 --> 17:16.000
the addition of a second adult to the mix

17:16.000 --> 17:18.000
means a second income,

17:18.000 --> 17:20.000
a second pair of hands to deal with raising kids,

17:20.000 --> 17:22.000
and a second perspective on problems that may arise.

17:22.000 --> 17:24.000
So, now we have to ask,

17:24.000 --> 17:26.000
why aren't black men making an effort

17:26.000 --> 17:28.000
to keep the families that they start intact?

17:28.000 --> 17:30.000
I don't know the answer to this one.

17:30.000 --> 17:32.000
Maybe it's because feminism's advocacy for the destruction of the nuclear family

17:32.000 --> 17:34.000
has actually come to pass in the black community

17:34.000 --> 17:36.000
with devastating intergenerational consequences.

17:36.000 --> 17:38.000
Maybe it's because the echoes of slavery

17:38.000 --> 17:40.000
are still at play culturally,

17:40.000 --> 17:42.000
where black slaves didn't care about their kids

17:42.000 --> 17:44.000
since those kids would just be sold off by their masters.

17:44.000 --> 17:46.000
And that attitude stuck around culturally in a diminished form.

17:46.000 --> 17:48.000
Maybe it's because the black men of today

17:48.000 --> 17:50.000
were raised in the exact type of dysfunctional household

17:50.000 --> 17:52.000
that they're creating

17:52.000 --> 17:54.000
and simply don't know anything other than having kids with women

17:54.000 --> 17:56.000
that they're not interested in building a family with.

17:56.000 --> 17:58.000
What I do know is that this problem

17:58.000 --> 18:00.000
can only be solved by black people.

18:00.000 --> 18:02.000
It can only be solved by black people

18:02.000 --> 18:04.000
making responsible choices about their lives

18:04.000 --> 18:06.000
and not blaming the government or Whitey

18:06.000 --> 18:08.000
or anybody else for the mistakes they make.

18:08.000 --> 18:10.000
I don't know if there's any impoverished

18:10.000 --> 18:12.000
poor black kids listening to this.

18:12.000 --> 18:14.000
There probably isn't.

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
But just in case there is, it doesn't matter if your friends

18:16.000 --> 18:18.000
think you're white on the inside

18:18.000 --> 18:20.000
or not acting black enough

18:20.000 --> 18:22.000
if you'd rather study or practice instead of fool around.

18:22.000 --> 18:24.000
It doesn't matter if your family thinks it's a betrayal to them

18:24.000 --> 18:26.000
or your people or whatever

18:26.000 --> 18:28.000
if you'd rather leave the ghetto instead of live there your entire life.

18:28.000 --> 18:30.000
They're saying that shit because they don't want you to get better.

18:30.000 --> 18:32.000
They want you to stick around in the hood with them

18:32.000 --> 18:34.000
because you're a part of their social capital.

18:34.000 --> 18:36.000
If you go, they're losing a resource, not a person.

18:36.000 --> 18:38.000
If the choice is to listen to the belligerence of black subculture

18:38.000 --> 18:40.000
or improve your lives

18:40.000 --> 18:42.000
well, I know which one I'd pick.

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
We're way off topic here

18:44.000 --> 18:46.000
and I know a lot of this is just me shooting the shit

18:46.000 --> 18:48.000
but I really think that the belligerence of black subculture

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
is what caused this entire Starbucks mess

18:50.000 --> 18:52.000
on some level.

18:52.000 --> 18:54.000
These two young men probably walked into the cafe

18:54.000 --> 18:56.000
with an attitude of entitlement.

18:56.000 --> 18:58.000
The rules didn't apply to them

18:58.000 --> 19:00.000
and they'd tell anybody who challenged them on this to fuck off.

19:00.000 --> 19:02.000
Why not? It's worked for them before.

19:02.000 --> 19:04.000
Oh shit, it's not working for them now. It must be racism, right?

19:04.000 --> 19:06.000
And the worst part is

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
people who accurately understand all of this

19:08.000 --> 19:10.000
the black prevalence of crime, black poverty

19:10.000 --> 19:12.000
and fatherlessness and so on

19:12.000 --> 19:14.000
and then use this information to assume that all black people

19:14.000 --> 19:16.000
are going to be a problem anytime they encounter one

19:16.000 --> 19:18.000
are actually racists

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
which is likely what happened at the LA Fitness.

19:20.000 --> 19:22.000
We can use this information to understand

19:22.000 --> 19:24.000
probably, why Rashawn Nelson and Dante Robinson

19:24.000 --> 19:26.000
acted as contrarian as they did

19:26.000 --> 19:28.000
in the Starbucks after the fact

19:28.000 --> 19:30.000
but we cannot use it to assume that any random

19:30.000 --> 19:32.000
black person will be contrarian in the future.

19:32.000 --> 19:34.000
That's the difference between the social justice definition

19:34.000 --> 19:36.000
of racism and racism in the real world.
