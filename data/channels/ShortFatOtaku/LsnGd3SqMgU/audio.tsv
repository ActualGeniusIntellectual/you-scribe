0	2000	Don't get no fight with them.
2000	4000	Don't get no fight with them.
4000	6000	Are you talking to them?
6000	8000	Yeah, I'm eating them.
8000	10000	It's ridiculous.
10000	12000	Yeah, this is ridiculous.
12000	14000	What did they get called for?
14000	16000	Because there were two black guys sitting here meeting me?
16000	18000	Well, what did they do?
18000	20000	What did they do? Someone told me what they did.
20000	22000	They didn't do anything. I saw the entire thing.
22000	24000	What did they do?
24000	26000	The moment says,
26000	28000	for any customer,
28000	30000	they can do anything.
50000	52000	As you've seen at the beginning of this video,
52000	54000	and as you've probably heard about all over the internet by now,
54000	56000	on April 12th, 2018,
56000	58000	two black men were arrested for trespassing within a Starbucks
58000	60000	while waiting for a business associate of theirs to arrive.
60000	62000	The business associate in question
62000	64000	is the white guy in the video
64000	66000	asking the police why the two black men are being arrested.
66000	68000	The manager who called the police
68000	70000	stated in the 911 call
70000	72000	that the two men sat down
72000	74000	and refused to buy anything or leave the premises.
74000	76000	That same manager later quit her job,
76000	78000	presumably due to the blowback received from this event.
78000	80000	On Twitter, Starbucks apologized
80000	82000	for exercising their legal rights
82000	84000	against non-customers trespassing
84000	86000	on their private property.
86000	88000	On April 12th, 2018,
88000	90000	two black men were arrested
90000	92000	for trespassing
92000	94000	while waiting for a business associate
94000	96000	to arrive.
96000	98000	On April 12th, 2018,
98000	100000	two black men were arrested
100000	102000	for trespassing
102000	104000	against non-customers trespassing
104000	106000	on their private property.
106000	108000	The CEO of Starbucks even made the rounds in the morning news,
108000	110000	offering sincere apologies
110000	112000	that one of his employees would dare assert their rights
112000	114000	against a person of color.
114000	116000	Philadelphia's police commissioner released a video
116000	118000	in which he defended the legal actions of his officers.
118000	120000	On Thursday, at about 4.40,
120000	122000	police received a 911 call
122000	124000	for a disturbance
124000	126000	and trespassing.
126000	128000	When the police arrived,
128000	130000	they were met by Starbucks employees
130000	132000	who said that two males were trespassing
132000	134000	and had refused to leave the establishment.
134000	136000	According to employees,
136000	138000	they had seen these two males
138000	140000	come in, they sat down,
140000	142000	and after being seated,
142000	144000	they decided that they needed to use the restroom.
144000	146000	Starbucks said that
146000	148000	according to their company policy,
148000	150000	they do not allow
150000	152000	nonpaying members
152000	154000	or nonpaying people
154000	156000	of the public to come in
156000	158000	and use the restroom.
158000	160000	And so,
160000	162000	they then asked these two males
162000	164000	to leave, these two males
164000	166000	refused to leave,
166000	168000	and the police were called.
168000	170000	Now, when the police were
170000	172000	summoned to the scene,
172000	174000	they get there and they get this story
174000	176000	that I just began to outline.
176000	178000	They then approached the males,
178000	180000	they asked the males to leave
180000	182000	because they're being
182000	184000	asked to leave by Starbucks
184000	186000	employees. In fact,
186000	188000	in an effort to quell the situation,
188000	190000	officers actually called for a
190000	192000	supervisor so that it would not get out
192000	194000	of hand, something that was a good decision.
194000	196000	And three different
196000	198000	occasions, the officers asked the males
198000	200000	politely to leave
200000	202000	the location because they were being asked
202000	204000	to leave by employees because they were trespassing.
204000	206000	Instead,
206000	208000	the males continued to refuse
208000	210000	as they had told the employees previously,
210000	212000	and they told the officers that they were
212000	214000	not leaving. When the
214000	216000	call was initially made, the Starbucks
216000	218000	employees had told the males that they were
218000	220000	going to call police and they said, go ahead and call
220000	222000	police, we don't care. So, police
222000	224000	get there and they're confronted by the same
224000	226000	type of attitude and repeatedly
226000	228000	are told that they're not leaving.
228000	230000	In fact, there's some alleged rhetoric
230000	232000	about you don't know what you're doing, you're only
232000	234000	a $45,000 a year employee
234000	236000	or something to that regard.
236000	238000	And so, because these individuals
238000	240000	refused to leave, because
240000	242000	Starbucks actually called,
242000	244000	the police did not just happen upon this
244000	246000	event. They did not just walk into
246000	248000	Starbucks to get coffee. They were
248000	250000	called there for a service
250000	252000	and that service had to do with quelling a
252000	254000	disturbance, a disturbance that had to do
254000	256000	with trespassing. So,
256000	258000	I need to underscore
258000	260000	the fact that these males were arrested.
260000	262000	When they were arrested, they were taken out
262000	264000	essentially without incident. There was
264000	266000	no harm done to them. But
266000	268000	after being transported to the
268000	270000	police district in the area,
270000	272000	the officers after processing paperwork
272000	274000	discovered that Starbucks no longer
274000	276000	was interested in prosecuting.
276000	278000	And so, at that point, those
278000	280000	males were released from custody.
280000	282000	It is important to emphasize
282000	284000	and underscore that these officers
284000	286000	had legal standing to make this arrest.
286000	288000	Again, they were
288000	290000	called to the scene because employees
290000	292000	said they were trespassing.
292000	294000	It is important for me to say
294000	296000	that, in short, these officers
296000	298000	did absolutely nothing wrong.
298000	300000	They followed policy. They did what
300000	302000	they were supposed to do. They were
302000	304000	professional in all their dealings with
304000	306000	these gentlemen. And instead,
306000	308000	they got the opposite back. I
308000	310000	will say that as an African-American
310000	312000	male, I am very aware of implicit
312000	314000	bias. We are committed
314000	316000	to fair and unbiased policing
316000	318000	and anything less than that will not be
318000	320000	tolerated in this department. Let me
320000	322000	be very clear. I own no stock
322000	324000	in Starbucks. I just happen not to even
324000	326000	ever frequent Starbucks. But I can
326000	328000	tell you that there was a case
328000	330000	involving one of our sergeants
330000	332000	probably a couple years ago who
332000	334000	went to Starbucks in full uniform
334000	336000	and he was also denied access
336000	338000	to the restroom. So they are at least
338000	340000	consistent in their policy. But he
340000	342000	ended up cucking, too, and eventually apologized
342000	344000	for infringing upon these poor
344000	346000	black men's right to infringe upon the
346000	348000	rights of others. These innocent victims
348000	350000	later made an appearance on Good Morning America
350000	352000	telling their side of this heinous event.
352000	354000	Dante, you both walk in.
354000	356000	You get a table.
356000	358000	Rashawn, how long was it
358000	360000	before you asked to use the restroom?
360000	362000	Immediately, as soon as I walked in
362000	364000	and she
364000	366000	stated that they were for paying customers only
366000	368000	and I just left it at that moment.
368000	370000	And the response was, you have
370000	372000	to buy something. Yes.
372000	374000	Then you go and find Dante.
374000	376000	You're at the table. What happened next?
378000	380000	We're at the table.
380000	382000	We sit down. We're just talking amongst each other.
382000	384000	She then
384000	386000	comes from around the register
386000	388000	asks, you know,
388000	390000	walks up to us, asks
390000	392000	if she can help us with anything.
392000	394000	Can we start with some drinks or water
394000	396000	or something like that.
396000	398000	For when we have bottles of water with us,
398000	400000	so we're fine. We're just
400000	402000	waiting for a meeting. We'll be out really quick.
402000	404000	And that was it.
404000	406000	So approximately 4.35
406000	408000	you arrive for a 4.45
408000	410000	business meeting. According to
410000	412000	911 accounts
412000	414000	a call was placed at
414000	416000	4.37
416000	418000	approximately two minutes after you arrived to
418000	420000	911. What did you think
420000	422000	when you saw police arrive
422000	424000	Dante? It can't be
424000	426000	for us. So when they do approach you
426000	428000	what do they say and how do you react?
428000	430000	Well initially
430000	432000	as soon as they approached us
432000	434000	they just said we have to leave.
434000	436000	There was no question of, you know,
436000	438000	was there a problem here
438000	440000	between you guys and the manager.
440000	442000	You know, what happened. When you were arrested
442000	444000	did they tell you what you were being arrested
444000	446000	for? No, not at the time.
446000	448000	We wasn't read any rights.
448000	450000	Nothing. Just double lock
450000	452000	handcuffs behind our back
452000	454000	escorted out and put into a squad car.
454000	456000	Well the video has
456000	458000	been viewed almost 11 million
458000	460000	times and
460000	462000	part of it Dante, you can see that you're talking
462000	464000	to the police officer.
464000	466000	What were you all
466000	468000	saying to one another?
468000	470000	I was just trying to, you know, process
470000	472000	the situation to myself at the time
472000	474000	because I'm thinking about
474000	476000	my family that I have, my
476000	478000	community. So in that moment
478000	480000	I'm trying to process what's going on.
480000	482000	They walk over and they say you have to leave
482000	484000	I say we're here for a meeting.
484000	486000	What is the business meeting about? It's a real estate
486000	488000	meeting. We've been working on
488000	490000	this for months. What do you
490000	492000	say to some people
492000	494000	who say rules are rules, that Starbucks
494000	496000	has a policy, you violated
496000	498000	that policy. The police asked you
498000	500000	repeatedly to leave
500000	502000	and you didn't. How do you respond
502000	504000	to people who say that? What I say is
504000	506000	I understand that. Rules are rules
506000	508000	but what's right is right and what's
508000	510000	wrong is wrong. And that's in any situation.
510000	512000	Whether it's race involved or anything.
512000	514000	Everybody involved in this story
514000	516000	from Starbucks to the police to the media
516000	518000	to the verified armbands to those two
518000	520000	young men themselves are acting like
520000	522000	these two don't have any personal agency.
522000	524000	They're acting like when black people misbehave in public
524000	526000	they aren't responsible for their own actions
526000	528000	and therefore punishing them for those
528000	530000	actions is unjust. It's almost
530000	532000	like they equate black people to unruly
532000	534000	children that need disciplining by their parents.
534000	536000	And when the police chief or the Starbucks CEO
536000	538000	come out and say that it's their fault
538000	540000	this happened, not the two men in question
540000	542000	it's like a parent apologizing to a shopkeep
542000	544000	that their child broke a vase or something.
544000	546000	There's only one word for considering an
546000	548000	entire race of people to lack agency
548000	550000	in this manner. Racism.
550000	552000	And the worst part about it is there actually are
552000	554000	instances in the United States in which black
554000	556000	people are unjustly removed from establishments
556000	558000	solely because of their race. And these
558000	560000	legitimate instances of racism are routinely
560000	562000	overshadowed or underreported
562000	564000	in comparison to this Starbucks-styled
564000	566000	shenanigans. For example, let's look at
566000	568000	this LA Fitness in New Jersey. On April
568000	570000	16th, 2018, two black
570000	572000	men went to the gym together. One was a member
572000	574000	with a membership ID. The other had purchased
574000	576000	a four-day guest pass. After signing
576000	578000	in and beginning to work out, an LA Fitness
578000	580000	employee approached them and told them that
580000	582000	they needed to pay. After explaining that they had both
582000	584000	already paid and signed in properly,
584000	586000	the police were called. One of the black men
586000	588000	recorded four short videos of the event.
608000	610000	We got the police here.
610000	612000	Excuse me, what's your name?
616000	618000	It don't matter, they don't know who you are.
618000	620000	Out here, go ahead and scan that.
620000	622000	I told you I scanned that with your manager, right?
622000	624000	Go ahead and scan that.
628000	630000	I need to call the police for this.
630000	632000	He's right here.
632000	634000	What that say on the screen?
634000	636000	Have a nice day.
636000	638000	Have a nice day.
638000	640000	LA Fitness Secaucus, again.
640000	642000	LA Fitness Secaucus, again.
642000	644000	Dude, you're not allowed to film me.
644000	646000	Why not?
646000	648000	Let's figure this out, alright?
648000	650000	I do want to figure out. We have all these police officers here for what reason?
650000	652000	We're just here, man.
652000	654000	We've been having this
654000	656000	stash for months now.
656000	658000	Several people, not just me. You got several emails from
658000	660000	corporate about this stuff.
660000	662000	You guys don't like cell phones. I get it.
662000	664000	It's not criminal activity. Exactly.
664000	666000	You're kicking me off the gym for no reason?
666000	668000	That's how you call it.
668000	670000	You're kicking me off the gym for no reason?
670000	672000	Ridiculous, man. Working out by myself.
672000	674000	And this lady, too.
680000	682000	For no reason.
682000	684000	For no reason.
684000	686000	Are you with anybody?
688000	690000	We're the only two black people in the gym.
690000	692000	Let's make this a black thing.
692000	694000	We're the only two black people in the gym.
694000	696000	We've been having problems with this stuff for months.
696000	698000	Over nothing. Every time it's something new.
704000	706000	My contract is being terminated.
706000	708000	My contract is being terminated.
708000	710000	Because, um...
710000	712000	Because what?
712000	714000	Because what?
714000	716000	I don't have the answers.
716000	718000	Nobody knows. Nobody knows if my contract is being terminated.
718000	720000	The manager doesn't like me.
720000	722000	So, we're going to write the case on me now for you that we came here for a while.
722000	724000	Absolutely. No problem.
750000	752000	Is this even just plain ol' racism?
752000	754000	It's looking likely.
754000	756000	And for anybody who thinks that we live in a white supremacist society,
756000	758000	in this case of actual racism,
758000	760000	the manager of the LA Fitness and the two employees
760000	762000	involved have been fired,
762000	764000	and the victim's membership has been restored.
764000	766000	So we've got two very similar situations,
766000	768000	both involving black men getting kicked out
768000	770000	from privately owned businesses.
770000	772000	The Starbucks one was legitimate.
772000	774000	The men weren't customers, they were instead trespassers,
774000	776000	and the media jumped all over it.
776000	778000	The LA Fitness one happened at around the same time,
778000	780000	with a very similar structure of events,
780000	782000	and a similar demographic of people involved in all positions.
782000	784000	But it involved an actual instance of racism,
784000	786000	and the media ignored it.
786000	788000	Why?
788000	790000	Why'd one video go viral, but not the other?
790000	792000	Maybe it's because Starbucks is a more well-known brand
792000	794000	than LA Fitness,
794000	796000	and therefore the verification squad could extract
796000	798000	more sympathy clicks from the story.
798000	800000	Maybe it's because Starbucks is already hipster soy boy mecca,
800000	802000	where these ideas naturally have fertile ground.
802000	804000	Maybe it's because gyms are generally avoided
804000	806000	by the radical left,
806000	808000	by low testosterone levels,
808000	810000	and fat oppression theory.
810000	812000	Or maybe it's because ultimately the media is more interested
812000	814000	in fabricated and controlled stories of fake racism
814000	816000	than actual racism.
816000	818000	Maybe it's because the wells of money, outrage,
818000	820000	and viewers are more easily exploited
820000	822000	when the narrative can be controlled,
822000	824000	when the villains are willing to play ball
824000	826000	by kowtowing themselves to social justice principles,
826000	828000	and the heroes are just good boys going to college
828000	830000	never done nothing wrong.
830000	832000	There's a strong strand of belligerence
832000	834000	within the black subculture in America,
834000	836000	I think people have not only a moral right
836000	838000	but a moral obligation to rebel against tyranny.
838000	840000	But was Starbucks acting in a tyrannical manner
840000	842000	when they asked two people
842000	844000	that refused to buy anything to leave?
844000	846000	If you think they were, it's likely because
846000	848000	you don't respect the property rights of Starbucks,
848000	850000	and that actually makes a fair amount of sense
850000	852000	given the people who protested this event.
852000	854000	But there's a gigantic gap between the moral obligation
854000	856000	to rebel against tyranny and the amount of belligerence
856000	858000	within America's black subculture.
858000	860000	I mean, look at it from this point of view.
860000	862000	Let's say you're one of these two black men.
862000	864000	You ask Starbucks for a meeting to be held in 10 minutes time.
864000	866000	The meeting is, as they themselves described,
866000	868000	a real estate meeting that will change your life.
868000	870000	A manager comes over and says
870000	872000	you need to buy something or leave.
872000	874000	Why wouldn't you just buy a coffee?
874000	876000	Why would you just simply be belligerent
876000	878000	both to the manager and to the officers
878000	880000	that arrived in the scene?
880000	882000	Why jeopardize everything?
882000	884000	Some people have already made up their minds about this.
884000	886000	They did it because the whole thing is fake news.
886000	888000	It's a false flag operation.
888000	890000	It was set up by the SJWs to make Starbucks look racist.
890000	892000	They can show how progressive they are or whatever.
892000	894000	There's no evidence for any of this.
894000	896000	And these theories are honestly a little bit out there.
896000	898000	I have no evidence for my theory either.
898000	900000	It's just a hunch.
900000	902000	But I think it's because the subculture these guys were raised in
902000	904000	is one in which belligerence,
904000	906000	whether or not it's justified,
906000	908000	is used as a currency in place of wealth or attractiveness.
908000	910000	We're going down the rabbit hole here a little bit,
910000	912000	but that's okay.
912000	914000	The black population of the US is around 13%.
914000	916000	Despite this, black people commit
916000	918000	significantly more than their share of crime.
918000	920000	They commit 51% of America's murders,
920000	922000	30% of America's rapes,
922000	924000	56% of its robberies,
924000	926000	33% of its aggravated assaults,
926000	928000	and the list goes on.
928000	930000	Overall, 28% of people arrested in the United States are black.
930000	932000	All of these numbers are huge overrepresentations
932000	934000	from the 13% black population.
934000	936000	Some people would say it's because of racism,
936000	938000	that they're more likely to arrest black people
938000	940000	for things that they let white people off with a warning,
940000	942000	that they're more likely to over-police black neighborhoods,
942000	944000	and even that they're more likely to simply
944000	946000	fabricate cases against innocent black people.
946000	948000	I'm not saying this doesn't happen.
948000	950000	Clearly, there are instances of police brutality in the States.
950000	952000	But 100 years ago, Chinese communities
952000	954000	had huge problems with the police,
954000	956000	on par with the black community, and now they don't.
956000	958000	Jewish communities had huge problems with the police,
958000	960000	and now they don't.
960000	962000	Italian communities had massive problems with the police,
962000	964000	and now they don't.
964000	966000	Nowadays, Latino communities have huge problems with the police,
966000	968000	but still not nearly as large as black communities,
968000	970000	despite the cultural stereotype
970000	972000	of the illegal immigrant Mexican cartel member.
972000	974000	If America is a white supremacy,
974000	976000	and every single one of these statistics
976000	978000	is explained by racism,
978000	980000	why is it that of all the immigrant communities,
980000	982000	it's only the black community
982000	984000	that isn't getting any better over time?
984000	986000	The alt-right will say it's genetics.
986000	988000	The alt-right is stupid.
988000	990000	I personally think it's the subculture of belligerence.
990000	992000	32% of all black families with children
992000	994000	live below the poverty line,
994000	996000	and 58% of black children don't live with their biological fathers.
996000	998000	The black community is extremely impoverished,
998000	1000000	and in the absence of money,
1000000	1002000	belligerence becomes the de facto social currency.
1002000	1004000	This poverty is compounded by a lack of a stable home life,
1004000	1006000	a lack of a father figure,
1006000	1008000	and a lack of resources and money that a second parent would provide.
1008000	1010000	And in the absence of any other resource,
1010000	1012000	the only form of advancement left to these kids
1012000	1014000	is belligerence.
1014000	1016000	Be the meanest, baddest dude around
1016000	1018000	so nobody would dare fuck with you.
1018000	1020000	And eventually, that belligerence escalates into violence,
1020000	1022000	it escalates into crime,
1022000	1024000	it escalates into gang membership,
1024000	1026000	it escalates into all the things that we see
1026000	1028000	black adults overrepresented in.
1028000	1030000	It's clear to me that what would help the poorest of black people
1030000	1032000	is a stable nuclear family situation.
1032000	1034000	Even if these families lived in grinding poverty,
1034000	1036000	the addition of a second adult to the mix
1036000	1038000	means a second income,
1038000	1040000	a second pair of hands to deal with raising kids,
1040000	1042000	and a second perspective on problems that may arise.
1042000	1044000	So, now we have to ask,
1044000	1046000	why aren't black men making an effort
1046000	1048000	to keep the families that they start intact?
1048000	1050000	I don't know the answer to this one.
1050000	1052000	Maybe it's because feminism's advocacy for the destruction of the nuclear family
1052000	1054000	has actually come to pass in the black community
1054000	1056000	with devastating intergenerational consequences.
1056000	1058000	Maybe it's because the echoes of slavery
1058000	1060000	are still at play culturally,
1060000	1062000	where black slaves didn't care about their kids
1062000	1064000	since those kids would just be sold off by their masters.
1064000	1066000	And that attitude stuck around culturally in a diminished form.
1066000	1068000	Maybe it's because the black men of today
1068000	1070000	were raised in the exact type of dysfunctional household
1070000	1072000	that they're creating
1072000	1074000	and simply don't know anything other than having kids with women
1074000	1076000	that they're not interested in building a family with.
1076000	1078000	What I do know is that this problem
1078000	1080000	can only be solved by black people.
1080000	1082000	It can only be solved by black people
1082000	1084000	making responsible choices about their lives
1084000	1086000	and not blaming the government or Whitey
1086000	1088000	or anybody else for the mistakes they make.
1088000	1090000	I don't know if there's any impoverished
1090000	1092000	poor black kids listening to this.
1092000	1094000	There probably isn't.
1094000	1096000	But just in case there is, it doesn't matter if your friends
1096000	1098000	think you're white on the inside
1098000	1100000	or not acting black enough
1100000	1102000	if you'd rather study or practice instead of fool around.
1102000	1104000	It doesn't matter if your family thinks it's a betrayal to them
1104000	1106000	or your people or whatever
1106000	1108000	if you'd rather leave the ghetto instead of live there your entire life.
1108000	1110000	They're saying that shit because they don't want you to get better.
1110000	1112000	They want you to stick around in the hood with them
1112000	1114000	because you're a part of their social capital.
1114000	1116000	If you go, they're losing a resource, not a person.
1116000	1118000	If the choice is to listen to the belligerence of black subculture
1118000	1120000	or improve your lives
1120000	1122000	well, I know which one I'd pick.
1122000	1124000	We're way off topic here
1124000	1126000	and I know a lot of this is just me shooting the shit
1126000	1128000	but I really think that the belligerence of black subculture
1128000	1130000	is what caused this entire Starbucks mess
1130000	1132000	on some level.
1132000	1134000	These two young men probably walked into the cafe
1134000	1136000	with an attitude of entitlement.
1136000	1138000	The rules didn't apply to them
1138000	1140000	and they'd tell anybody who challenged them on this to fuck off.
1140000	1142000	Why not? It's worked for them before.
1142000	1144000	Oh shit, it's not working for them now. It must be racism, right?
1144000	1146000	And the worst part is
1146000	1148000	people who accurately understand all of this
1148000	1150000	the black prevalence of crime, black poverty
1150000	1152000	and fatherlessness and so on
1152000	1154000	and then use this information to assume that all black people
1154000	1156000	are going to be a problem anytime they encounter one
1156000	1158000	are actually racists
1158000	1160000	which is likely what happened at the LA Fitness.
1160000	1162000	We can use this information to understand
1162000	1164000	probably, why Rashawn Nelson and Dante Robinson
1164000	1166000	acted as contrarian as they did
1166000	1168000	in the Starbucks after the fact
1168000	1170000	but we cannot use it to assume that any random
1170000	1172000	black person will be contrarian in the future.
1172000	1174000	That's the difference between the social justice definition
1174000	1176000	of racism and racism in the real world.
