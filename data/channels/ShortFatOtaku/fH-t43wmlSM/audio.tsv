0	5380	I was in the middle of working on the next how cucked is Canada part when I found out that Count Dankila had actually been
5680	11140	Convicted in his court case for those of you who don't know he taught his girlfriend's pug
11420	17800	To do a Hitler salute as a way to annoy her. He made a video out of it. And now he's being charged under
19120	23980	What is it? Is it the Communications Act of 2003 for grossly offensive speech?
23980	27040	I'm sure you guys don't need to be told how ridiculous this actually is
27040	29980	But today he was found guilty and the judge said, okay come back in an hour
29980	33680	And I'm going to sentence you to whatever prison length or whatever punishment
33680	36560	I'm going to to meet her out and an hour later. They go back into the
37420	40320	The courtroom and the judge says oh, hold on. I've changed my mind
41080	44400	Come back in a month. So he has to wait another month at this point
44400	47520	It's pretty obvious that the the judge is just fucking with him
47520	51800	He's just trying to punish Dankila as much as he can presumably because he's an activist of some sort
51800	56060	But it was also mentioned that the judge needed to collect pre-sentence reports now
56060	59860	I'm not sure about the UK but in Canada pre-sentence reports
60100	66100	Basically referred to reports on the investigation of the history of somebody who's been convicted of a crime just to see if there are
66100	72780	Any extenuating circumstances which may raise or lower the sentence considering how much of an activist the judge?
73220	75940	Seems to be and how long they've been dragging this out
75940	79500	They may be looking for ways to give Dankila a harsher sentence
79500	85800	But there's also the hope that they may be looking to simply just give him time served and time served means that yes
85800	93680	You're guilty, but you're not going to be punished which frankly should be what the judge comes back with in this case because prosecuting and
93680	96920	Convicting somebody for a joke is fucking ridiculous
96920	100760	I'll include the reports from Tommy Robinson outside of the courtroom at the end of this video guys
100760	107360	Just keep watching to hear it from his own mouth. Thanks guys. Let's hope that Dankila gets out of this one. I love you
107920	109920	Count Dankila has just been convicted
110160	112160	He's been found guilty
112880	114880	of course in
115000	118760	Under the Community Communications Act of being grossly offensive
119840	121440	That's right
121440	123440	It's a crime to be grossly offensive
124560	126560	He'll be sentenced
127040	129040	At two o'clock
131640	133640	I'd rather just spill on what I think
135280	137240	In the fact that
137240	140840	What what he'd been convicted of is telling a joke is a joke
141400	147840	He's been convicted the judge did not accept the judge will not believe they would simply to annoy his girlfriend the judge believed he
148240	153440	Purposely intended to cause mass offenses. That's his purpose thinking where in reality
154280	156280	If he did want to cause mass offense, who cares?
157600	159600	We're not allowed to offend people
160480	163800	You can talk about the Irish you can talk about English
167680	169680	Found out under
169800	174240	He said let me get go back to what he said he said that it was grossly offensive
174760	180320	He's been convicted of it being grossly offensive three million people watch that video. Not one person
181000	185680	Made a complaint three million people watch the video. Not one person made a complaint. It couldn't be that grossly offensive
186680	190420	People couldn't have and in context it was a joke, but right now
192880	194880	He's faced in prison
199680	202840	Not one person made a complaint not one person made a complaint
202920	207480	He didn't make a complaint the one person that they got a statement off is that it is the police
207760	213120	Scottish police hate crime represent they went to him not one person made from
218640	224320	Yeah, the judge said you have to keep in mind the reasonable enlightenment of a multiracial society
224360	228480	So as we become more diverse for more multicultural, you can't speak
228960	232680	Okay, you cannot joke you certainly cannot think
240200	247860	Comedians joke about this stuff comedians joke every day comedians joke on TV shows comedians joke of theaters. It's a joke. It's a joke
249200	251200	It doesn't matter that it's a joke. No
251920	253920	It doesn't matter. There's a joke. I
255960	257960	Can't believe this is that judge
259040	262640	How anyone can't watch it and see this a joke when you go through the man's history
262640	267940	You can see he's got no not see not see past. He's not a racist. That is his self-admittance communist
268480	270480	told you that himself
280280	284120	And he should once once he realized the video is offensive he should have taken it down
284120	289580	It's part of our right not to offend be
296480	301520	Yeah, the video is threatening because apparently seeing a little dog lift its poor up
303080	305280	Under the command gas the Jews would scare people
306600	312440	So once again for people just joining what's what's the verdict people just join in the verdict is account angle has been convicted and found
312800	315640	Under the Communications Act of being grossly offensive
316480	322640	He will be sentenced to a clock. He will go back in the center to a clock where he could be sent to prison
323720	328040	And if you care about free speech if you care about your rights
328400	333880	If you care about people who are free free to joke if you told a joke about your Irish
333880	337140	You wouldn't go down. You certainly won't be convicted on the communication
337880	339880	anyway, I
340480	347040	Hope there's lots of Jewish people that watch this afterwards know as offended the fact that a man's been convicted for a joke video
349000	353240	David the deal it come out in court that David the deal who's one of the most famous Jews in Britain
353240	355240	He's the Jewish comedian
355480	361920	He has come out in support of Count Dankler as how ridiculous this court trial is what this court trial is
361920	366160	I don't even believe it's about the fact that Jews are offended what this is about is
366440	374000	Implementing laws that silence people and stop people talking joking criticizing and having a speech. That's what this is about in my opinion
375080	381960	Yes, and think about this. We've had a man who made a joke video. He made a joke video. He's come to court
381960	386640	He's been convicted. We haven't could smart every single year year for our capital city
386640	393200	We have Hezbollah flags, which are terrorist organizations flag. We have hate preacher after hate preacher after hate preacher across this country
393200	398560	I mean right now who are anti-semitic on a daily basis in their sermons in their mosques. They're not being convicted
398560	400560	They'll be dragged to court on hate speech
400720	403040	This is very selective in who they prosecute
403200	407920	It's selective and this is done to send a message to people to say shut up speaking shut up
408080	412360	Criticizing and shut up joking when it comes to our multivacial diverse community to be now
414920	416920	And the sentence is at 2 o'clock
416960	419560	So at 2 o'clock, we'll be going back in there. He's there
419720	424160	No, it was quite emotional to watch because even before he was getting even before the conviction was read out
424160	428160	He thought his his partners holding her hand and I know what that's like
428160	430520	I know it's like this is a nice like for his mom
430520	435360	His mom's now getting a phone call saying convicted they're all panicking and worrying that the man's gonna go jail because he made a joke
435360	436280	video
436280	438280	He made a video that was a joke
438320	440320	See what our laws are a joke
440440	442440	That's once again. What was the verdict?
442680	447240	Because he's been found guilty under the Communications Act for being grossly offensive
450400	454760	Yeah, they mentioned freedom of speech but said that there's no argument to it because he was offensive
456520	458520	Yeah to a specific minority
460120	463560	How many of you people are offended how many of you people are grossly offended
463960	466720	When you see sermons by hate preachers, will you see what they're saying?
467720	469720	That doesn't matter though
469960	471960	Stop get out of my face. I'm gonna go on a proper rant
471960	473960	So
474920	479480	From sentence him at two o'clock the judges now change his mind to sentence him and he's been
480080	483080	Given bail until the 23rd of April some gorgeous day
483400	488600	He's back in on on the 23rd of April where he'll be sentenced, which is some people say a good thing
488600	491000	Some people say a bad thing. He's now got a month of worry
491960	499560	The nightmare for Count Dank killer continues the stress the worry the fear the concern the everlasting clouds hanging over his head
500080	501840	For a joke
501840	506640	continues and the reason is that they won't preach the equivalent in the UK of pre-sentence reports
507760	512640	So me I'd say that the judge wants to send him a prison and these pre-sentence reports to do that
516480	518480	Providing there's legalities that we can
519040	522440	We will be sitting down with count that can you tonight this afternoon?
522680	526680	I'm bringing you an exclusive interview about his feelings about what just happened
527480	529480	This is an attack on free speech again
532920	534920	I'm gutted
536360	539000	See the worry on his missus face you see the fear in the face
540360	545440	So now it's got a month not another month the two years this hanging over said now. He's got another month
