00:00.000 --> 00:05.380
I was in the middle of working on the next how cucked is Canada part when I found out that Count Dankila had actually been

00:05.680 --> 00:11.140
Convicted in his court case for those of you who don't know he taught his girlfriend's pug

00:11.420 --> 00:17.800
To do a Hitler salute as a way to annoy her. He made a video out of it. And now he's being charged under

00:19.120 --> 00:23.980
What is it? Is it the Communications Act of 2003 for grossly offensive speech?

00:23.980 --> 00:27.040
I'm sure you guys don't need to be told how ridiculous this actually is

00:27.040 --> 00:29.980
But today he was found guilty and the judge said, okay come back in an hour

00:29.980 --> 00:33.680
And I'm going to sentence you to whatever prison length or whatever punishment

00:33.680 --> 00:36.560
I'm going to to meet her out and an hour later. They go back into the

00:37.420 --> 00:40.320
The courtroom and the judge says oh, hold on. I've changed my mind

00:41.080 --> 00:44.400
Come back in a month. So he has to wait another month at this point

00:44.400 --> 00:47.520
It's pretty obvious that the the judge is just fucking with him

00:47.520 --> 00:51.800
He's just trying to punish Dankila as much as he can presumably because he's an activist of some sort

00:51.800 --> 00:56.060
But it was also mentioned that the judge needed to collect pre-sentence reports now

00:56.060 --> 00:59.860
I'm not sure about the UK but in Canada pre-sentence reports

01:00.100 --> 01:06.100
Basically referred to reports on the investigation of the history of somebody who's been convicted of a crime just to see if there are

01:06.100 --> 01:12.780
Any extenuating circumstances which may raise or lower the sentence considering how much of an activist the judge?

01:13.220 --> 01:15.940
Seems to be and how long they've been dragging this out

01:15.940 --> 01:19.500
They may be looking for ways to give Dankila a harsher sentence

01:19.500 --> 01:25.800
But there's also the hope that they may be looking to simply just give him time served and time served means that yes

01:25.800 --> 01:33.680
You're guilty, but you're not going to be punished which frankly should be what the judge comes back with in this case because prosecuting and

01:33.680 --> 01:36.920
Convicting somebody for a joke is fucking ridiculous

01:36.920 --> 01:40.760
I'll include the reports from Tommy Robinson outside of the courtroom at the end of this video guys

01:40.760 --> 01:47.360
Just keep watching to hear it from his own mouth. Thanks guys. Let's hope that Dankila gets out of this one. I love you

01:47.920 --> 01:49.920
Count Dankila has just been convicted

01:50.160 --> 01:52.160
He's been found guilty

01:52.880 --> 01:54.880
of course in

01:55.000 --> 01:58.760
Under the Community Communications Act of being grossly offensive

01:59.840 --> 02:01.440
That's right

02:01.440 --> 02:03.440
It's a crime to be grossly offensive

02:04.560 --> 02:06.560
He'll be sentenced

02:07.040 --> 02:09.040
At two o'clock

02:11.640 --> 02:13.640
I'd rather just spill on what I think

02:15.280 --> 02:17.240
In the fact that

02:17.240 --> 02:20.840
What what he'd been convicted of is telling a joke is a joke

02:21.400 --> 02:27.840
He's been convicted the judge did not accept the judge will not believe they would simply to annoy his girlfriend the judge believed he

02:28.240 --> 02:33.440
Purposely intended to cause mass offenses. That's his purpose thinking where in reality

02:34.280 --> 02:36.280
If he did want to cause mass offense, who cares?

02:37.600 --> 02:39.600
We're not allowed to offend people

02:40.480 --> 02:43.800
You can talk about the Irish you can talk about English

02:47.680 --> 02:49.680
Found out under

02:49.800 --> 02:54.240
He said let me get go back to what he said he said that it was grossly offensive

02:54.760 --> 03:00.320
He's been convicted of it being grossly offensive three million people watch that video. Not one person

03:01.000 --> 03:05.680
Made a complaint three million people watch the video. Not one person made a complaint. It couldn't be that grossly offensive

03:06.680 --> 03:10.420
People couldn't have and in context it was a joke, but right now

03:12.880 --> 03:14.880
He's faced in prison

03:19.680 --> 03:22.840
Not one person made a complaint not one person made a complaint

03:22.920 --> 03:27.480
He didn't make a complaint the one person that they got a statement off is that it is the police

03:27.760 --> 03:33.120
Scottish police hate crime represent they went to him not one person made from

03:38.640 --> 03:44.320
Yeah, the judge said you have to keep in mind the reasonable enlightenment of a multiracial society

03:44.360 --> 03:48.480
So as we become more diverse for more multicultural, you can't speak

03:48.960 --> 03:52.680
Okay, you cannot joke you certainly cannot think

04:00.200 --> 04:07.860
Comedians joke about this stuff comedians joke every day comedians joke on TV shows comedians joke of theaters. It's a joke. It's a joke

04:09.200 --> 04:11.200
It doesn't matter that it's a joke. No

04:11.920 --> 04:13.920
It doesn't matter. There's a joke. I

04:15.960 --> 04:17.960
Can't believe this is that judge

04:19.040 --> 04:22.640
How anyone can't watch it and see this a joke when you go through the man's history

04:22.640 --> 04:27.940
You can see he's got no not see not see past. He's not a racist. That is his self-admittance communist

04:28.480 --> 04:30.480
told you that himself

04:40.280 --> 04:44.120
And he should once once he realized the video is offensive he should have taken it down

04:44.120 --> 04:49.580
It's part of our right not to offend be

04:56.480 --> 05:01.520
Yeah, the video is threatening because apparently seeing a little dog lift its poor up

05:03.080 --> 05:05.280
Under the command gas the Jews would scare people

05:06.600 --> 05:12.440
So once again for people just joining what's what's the verdict people just join in the verdict is account angle has been convicted and found

05:12.800 --> 05:15.640
Under the Communications Act of being grossly offensive

05:16.480 --> 05:22.640
He will be sentenced to a clock. He will go back in the center to a clock where he could be sent to prison

05:23.720 --> 05:28.040
And if you care about free speech if you care about your rights

05:28.400 --> 05:33.880
If you care about people who are free free to joke if you told a joke about your Irish

05:33.880 --> 05:37.140
You wouldn't go down. You certainly won't be convicted on the communication

05:37.880 --> 05:39.880
anyway, I

05:40.480 --> 05:47.040
Hope there's lots of Jewish people that watch this afterwards know as offended the fact that a man's been convicted for a joke video

05:49.000 --> 05:53.240
David the deal it come out in court that David the deal who's one of the most famous Jews in Britain

05:53.240 --> 05:55.240
He's the Jewish comedian

05:55.480 --> 06:01.920
He has come out in support of Count Dankler as how ridiculous this court trial is what this court trial is

06:01.920 --> 06:06.160
I don't even believe it's about the fact that Jews are offended what this is about is

06:06.440 --> 06:14.000
Implementing laws that silence people and stop people talking joking criticizing and having a speech. That's what this is about in my opinion

06:15.080 --> 06:21.960
Yes, and think about this. We've had a man who made a joke video. He made a joke video. He's come to court

06:21.960 --> 06:26.640
He's been convicted. We haven't could smart every single year year for our capital city

06:26.640 --> 06:33.200
We have Hezbollah flags, which are terrorist organizations flag. We have hate preacher after hate preacher after hate preacher across this country

06:33.200 --> 06:38.560
I mean right now who are anti-semitic on a daily basis in their sermons in their mosques. They're not being convicted

06:38.560 --> 06:40.560
They'll be dragged to court on hate speech

06:40.720 --> 06:43.040
This is very selective in who they prosecute

06:43.200 --> 06:47.920
It's selective and this is done to send a message to people to say shut up speaking shut up

06:48.080 --> 06:52.360
Criticizing and shut up joking when it comes to our multivacial diverse community to be now

06:54.920 --> 06:56.920
And the sentence is at 2 o'clock

06:56.960 --> 06:59.560
So at 2 o'clock, we'll be going back in there. He's there

06:59.720 --> 07:04.160
No, it was quite emotional to watch because even before he was getting even before the conviction was read out

07:04.160 --> 07:08.160
He thought his his partners holding her hand and I know what that's like

07:08.160 --> 07:10.520
I know it's like this is a nice like for his mom

07:10.520 --> 07:15.360
His mom's now getting a phone call saying convicted they're all panicking and worrying that the man's gonna go jail because he made a joke

07:15.360 --> 07:16.280
video

07:16.280 --> 07:18.280
He made a video that was a joke

07:18.320 --> 07:20.320
See what our laws are a joke

07:20.440 --> 07:22.440
That's once again. What was the verdict?

07:22.680 --> 07:27.240
Because he's been found guilty under the Communications Act for being grossly offensive

07:30.400 --> 07:34.760
Yeah, they mentioned freedom of speech but said that there's no argument to it because he was offensive

07:36.520 --> 07:38.520
Yeah to a specific minority

07:40.120 --> 07:43.560
How many of you people are offended how many of you people are grossly offended

07:43.960 --> 07:46.720
When you see sermons by hate preachers, will you see what they're saying?

07:47.720 --> 07:49.720
That doesn't matter though

07:49.960 --> 07:51.960
Stop get out of my face. I'm gonna go on a proper rant

07:51.960 --> 07:53.960
So

07:54.920 --> 07:59.480
From sentence him at two o'clock the judges now change his mind to sentence him and he's been

08:00.080 --> 08:03.080
Given bail until the 23rd of April some gorgeous day

08:03.400 --> 08:08.600
He's back in on on the 23rd of April where he'll be sentenced, which is some people say a good thing

08:08.600 --> 08:11.000
Some people say a bad thing. He's now got a month of worry

08:11.960 --> 08:19.560
The nightmare for Count Dank killer continues the stress the worry the fear the concern the everlasting clouds hanging over his head

08:20.080 --> 08:21.840
For a joke

08:21.840 --> 08:26.640
continues and the reason is that they won't preach the equivalent in the UK of pre-sentence reports

08:27.760 --> 08:32.640
So me I'd say that the judge wants to send him a prison and these pre-sentence reports to do that

08:36.480 --> 08:38.480
Providing there's legalities that we can

08:39.040 --> 08:42.440
We will be sitting down with count that can you tonight this afternoon?

08:42.680 --> 08:46.680
I'm bringing you an exclusive interview about his feelings about what just happened

08:47.480 --> 08:49.480
This is an attack on free speech again

08:52.920 --> 08:54.920
I'm gutted

08:56.360 --> 08:59.000
See the worry on his missus face you see the fear in the face

09:00.360 --> 09:05.440
So now it's got a month not another month the two years this hanging over said now. He's got another month
