1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,380
I was in the middle of working on the next how cucked is Canada part when I found out that Count Dankila had actually been

2
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:11,140
Convicted in his court case for those of you who don't know he taught his girlfriend's pug

3
00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:17,800
To do a Hitler salute as a way to annoy her. He made a video out of it. And now he's being charged under

4
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:23,980
What is it? Is it the Communications Act of 2003 for grossly offensive speech?

5
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:27,040
I'm sure you guys don't need to be told how ridiculous this actually is

6
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:29,980
But today he was found guilty and the judge said, okay come back in an hour

7
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:33,680
And I'm going to sentence you to whatever prison length or whatever punishment

8
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:36,560
I'm going to to meet her out and an hour later. They go back into the

9
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:40,320
The courtroom and the judge says oh, hold on. I've changed my mind

10
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:44,400
Come back in a month. So he has to wait another month at this point

11
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:47,520
It's pretty obvious that the the judge is just fucking with him

12
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:51,800
He's just trying to punish Dankila as much as he can presumably because he's an activist of some sort

13
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:56,060
But it was also mentioned that the judge needed to collect pre-sentence reports now

14
00:00:56,060 --> 00:00:59,860
I'm not sure about the UK but in Canada pre-sentence reports

15
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:06,100
Basically referred to reports on the investigation of the history of somebody who's been convicted of a crime just to see if there are

16
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:12,780
Any extenuating circumstances which may raise or lower the sentence considering how much of an activist the judge?

17
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:15,940
Seems to be and how long they've been dragging this out

18
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:19,500
They may be looking for ways to give Dankila a harsher sentence

19
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:25,800
But there's also the hope that they may be looking to simply just give him time served and time served means that yes

20
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:33,680
You're guilty, but you're not going to be punished which frankly should be what the judge comes back with in this case because prosecuting and

21
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:36,920
Convicting somebody for a joke is fucking ridiculous

22
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:40,760
I'll include the reports from Tommy Robinson outside of the courtroom at the end of this video guys

23
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:47,360
Just keep watching to hear it from his own mouth. Thanks guys. Let's hope that Dankila gets out of this one. I love you

24
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,920
Count Dankila has just been convicted

25
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:52,160
He's been found guilty

26
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,880
of course in

27
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,760
Under the Community Communications Act of being grossly offensive

28
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,440
That's right

29
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:03,440
It's a crime to be grossly offensive

30
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,560
He'll be sentenced

31
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,040
At two o'clock

32
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:13,640
I'd rather just spill on what I think

33
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:17,240
In the fact that

34
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:20,840
What what he'd been convicted of is telling a joke is a joke

35
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:27,840
He's been convicted the judge did not accept the judge will not believe they would simply to annoy his girlfriend the judge believed he

36
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:33,440
Purposely intended to cause mass offenses. That's his purpose thinking where in reality

37
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:36,280
If he did want to cause mass offense, who cares?

38
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:39,600
We're not allowed to offend people

39
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:43,800
You can talk about the Irish you can talk about English

40
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,680
Found out under

41
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:54,240
He said let me get go back to what he said he said that it was grossly offensive

42
00:02:54,760 --> 00:03:00,320
He's been convicted of it being grossly offensive three million people watch that video. Not one person

43
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,680
Made a complaint three million people watch the video. Not one person made a complaint. It couldn't be that grossly offensive

44
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:10,420
People couldn't have and in context it was a joke, but right now

45
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:14,880
He's faced in prison

46
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:22,840
Not one person made a complaint not one person made a complaint

47
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:27,480
He didn't make a complaint the one person that they got a statement off is that it is the police

48
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:33,120
Scottish police hate crime represent they went to him not one person made from

49
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:44,320
Yeah, the judge said you have to keep in mind the reasonable enlightenment of a multiracial society

50
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:48,480
So as we become more diverse for more multicultural, you can't speak

51
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:52,680
Okay, you cannot joke you certainly cannot think

52
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:07,860
Comedians joke about this stuff comedians joke every day comedians joke on TV shows comedians joke of theaters. It's a joke. It's a joke

53
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,200
It doesn't matter that it's a joke. No

54
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,920
It doesn't matter. There's a joke. I

55
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,960
Can't believe this is that judge

56
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:22,640
How anyone can't watch it and see this a joke when you go through the man's history

57
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:27,940
You can see he's got no not see not see past. He's not a racist. That is his self-admittance communist

58
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:30,480
told you that himself

59
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:44,120
And he should once once he realized the video is offensive he should have taken it down

60
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:49,580
It's part of our right not to offend be

61
00:04:56,480 --> 00:05:01,520
Yeah, the video is threatening because apparently seeing a little dog lift its poor up

62
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:05,280
Under the command gas the Jews would scare people

63
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:12,440
So once again for people just joining what's what's the verdict people just join in the verdict is account angle has been convicted and found

64
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,640
Under the Communications Act of being grossly offensive

65
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:22,640
He will be sentenced to a clock. He will go back in the center to a clock where he could be sent to prison

66
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:28,040
And if you care about free speech if you care about your rights

67
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:33,880
If you care about people who are free free to joke if you told a joke about your Irish

68
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:37,140
You wouldn't go down. You certainly won't be convicted on the communication

69
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:39,880
anyway, I

70
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:47,040
Hope there's lots of Jewish people that watch this afterwards know as offended the fact that a man's been convicted for a joke video

71
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,240
David the deal it come out in court that David the deal who's one of the most famous Jews in Britain

72
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:55,240
He's the Jewish comedian

73
00:05:55,480 --> 00:06:01,920
He has come out in support of Count Dankler as how ridiculous this court trial is what this court trial is

74
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:06,160
I don't even believe it's about the fact that Jews are offended what this is about is

75
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:14,000
Implementing laws that silence people and stop people talking joking criticizing and having a speech. That's what this is about in my opinion

76
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:21,960
Yes, and think about this. We've had a man who made a joke video. He made a joke video. He's come to court

77
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:26,640
He's been convicted. We haven't could smart every single year year for our capital city

78
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:33,200
We have Hezbollah flags, which are terrorist organizations flag. We have hate preacher after hate preacher after hate preacher across this country

79
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:38,560
I mean right now who are anti-semitic on a daily basis in their sermons in their mosques. They're not being convicted

80
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,560
They'll be dragged to court on hate speech

81
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:43,040
This is very selective in who they prosecute

82
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:47,920
It's selective and this is done to send a message to people to say shut up speaking shut up

83
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:52,360
Criticizing and shut up joking when it comes to our multivacial diverse community to be now

84
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,920
And the sentence is at 2 o'clock

85
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:59,560
So at 2 o'clock, we'll be going back in there. He's there

86
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:04,160
No, it was quite emotional to watch because even before he was getting even before the conviction was read out

87
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:08,160
He thought his his partners holding her hand and I know what that's like

88
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,520
I know it's like this is a nice like for his mom

89
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:15,360
His mom's now getting a phone call saying convicted they're all panicking and worrying that the man's gonna go jail because he made a joke

90
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,280
video

91
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:18,280
He made a video that was a joke

92
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:20,320
See what our laws are a joke

93
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,440
That's once again. What was the verdict?

94
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:27,240
Because he's been found guilty under the Communications Act for being grossly offensive

95
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:34,760
Yeah, they mentioned freedom of speech but said that there's no argument to it because he was offensive

96
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:38,520
Yeah to a specific minority

97
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:43,560
How many of you people are offended how many of you people are grossly offended

98
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:46,720
When you see sermons by hate preachers, will you see what they're saying?

99
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:49,720
That doesn't matter though

100
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:51,960
Stop get out of my face. I'm gonna go on a proper rant

101
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:53,960
So

102
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:59,480
From sentence him at two o'clock the judges now change his mind to sentence him and he's been

103
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:03,080
Given bail until the 23rd of April some gorgeous day

104
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:08,600
He's back in on on the 23rd of April where he'll be sentenced, which is some people say a good thing

105
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:11,000
Some people say a bad thing. He's now got a month of worry

106
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:19,560
The nightmare for Count Dank killer continues the stress the worry the fear the concern the everlasting clouds hanging over his head

107
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,840
For a joke

108
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:26,640
continues and the reason is that they won't preach the equivalent in the UK of pre-sentence reports

109
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:32,640
So me I'd say that the judge wants to send him a prison and these pre-sentence reports to do that

110
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:38,480
Providing there's legalities that we can

111
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:42,440
We will be sitting down with count that can you tonight this afternoon?

112
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:46,680
I'm bringing you an exclusive interview about his feelings about what just happened

113
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:49,480
This is an attack on free speech again

114
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:54,920
I'm gutted

115
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:59,000
See the worry on his missus face you see the fear in the face

116
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:05,440
So now it's got a month not another month the two years this hanging over said now. He's got another month
