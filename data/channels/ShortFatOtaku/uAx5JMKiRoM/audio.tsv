0	6640	Oh boy, my video yesterday was I'm gonna try dlive, and today's video is dlive might be bad guys.
6640	10960	If I were actually a popular youtuber, somebody would make a life comes at you fast meme out of
10960	15520	this. I had heard about dlive before the whole pewdiepie thing actually. I knew it as the site
15520	21040	that Ralph's kill stream took refuge on after he got his ass blacklisted from youtube. Dlive banned
21040	26320	him after like one stream, where he then moved over to stream me, which a few months later cashed
26320	31520	out and closed up shop. Geez, I guess you can abort the retort after all. But dlive went through
31520	36240	a radical restructuring, and took on pewdiepie as a promoted content creator. Pewdiepie announced he
36240	40880	would be using dlive as his exclusive home for streaming content going forward, and that he was
40880	46640	giving out $50,000 in dlive's proprietary cryptocurrency, lino, as a way to draw other
46640	51440	creators to the site. Dlive's technology is blockchain based, making it significantly harder
51440	56080	for outside authorities to censor or regulate, and when pewdiepie made his pitch to the audience,
56080	61360	he did so specifically referencing the fact that blockchain based services are better for creators.
61360	66960	That endorsement, by the way, was a not so subtle jab at youtube and twitch for their draconian,
66960	72000	hypocritical, murky, and arbitrarily enforced policies on things like copyrighted content,
72000	75920	community guidelines, and hate speech. There's a rumor floating around, though,
75920	79040	that dlive's a pyramid scheme. Well, let's take a look.
79040	82080	Dlive declined to comment on how the company expects to earn money.
82080	87600	We are growing fast. Monetizing is not in our short term plans. Our sole focus is on growth.
87600	90000	Really? Well, that sounds a bit strange, doesn't it?
90000	94400	The fellow who made that statement is Wilson Wei, the CEO of the lino network.
94400	98080	Considering that the lino network is run by a bunch of Chinese students who attended
98080	103920	UFC Berkeley, and dlive's CEO was the president of the Chinese Entrepreneurial Association at
103920	108080	UFC Berkeley while they were all at school there, it's probably no surprise these guys
108080	111440	all decided to work together. Wei, even though he's the CEO of the
111440	115920	lino network, was also responsible for the development of dlive's streaming features,
115920	120640	which he posted about on his public blog. And other lino network employees have also
120640	124960	worked on dlive. Basically, despite dlive and the lino network being two different
124960	128960	companies with two different CEOs, they have got largely the same staff.
128960	134160	But Wei, you're really not looking to monetize? I mean, you've taken in 20 million dollars of
134160	139680	surprise surprise Chinese money from Zenfund, a Beijing-based venture capitalist firm.
139680	141840	They've got to be expecting their investment back, right?
141840	146080	A year ago, at dlive's launch, it was using a different cryptocurrency,
146080	150080	steam. But dlive decided to move away from steam and adopt lino.
150080	151600	Here's their statement on the matter.
151600	154720	We've been monitoring the analytics, and we were not able to reward our
154720	157120	content creators with the true value of their content.
157120	161520	Our focus was to grow our user base and build an engaging live streaming and video
161520	165760	community while growing steam as well, and deliver upvotes as evenly as possible
165760	169360	during the last nine months. However, the current economic model of steam
169360	172960	incentivizes large steam holders to continuously upvote their own content,
172960	175520	and other creators who specifically support their content.
175520	180160	This creates an ecosystem where a content's true value can't be recognized or be fairly rewarded.
180160	185280	The dlive steam split happened around September 20th, 2018.
185280	189040	The lino network set up shop in January of 2018.
189040	192240	Remember, with the same people who run dlive under a different banner.
192240	195520	They got their zenfund money in February of 2018.
195520	200160	In March of 2018, dlive wrote about how awesome steam is on medium,
200160	203040	and how they're running experiments on the platform.
203040	208000	In May of 2018, the lino team, including recognizable faces from dlive,
208000	211360	talks about how they're going to use blockchain to take on YouTube.
211360	217680	In September of 2018, dlive swaps steam for lino as their only cryptocurrency,
217680	221920	citing systemic problems with steam. Problems that, to be fair, did exist,
221920	225280	and existed back in March when they claimed the platform was great.
225280	229680	It seems to me that, basically, these dlive kids got into steam in order to learn how
229680	232400	to build their own crypto that they could manage themselves,
232400	236400	and then unceremoniously dumped steam once they obtained the knowledge they needed.
236400	240400	Anyway, after the change, steam's value tanked and hasn't really recovered.
240400	244480	If all of dlive's transactions are in their own proprietary lino currency,
244480	246320	what's to keep that currency from crashing?
246320	250880	And really, where does the money come from when you cash your lino out for real money?
250880	254000	Well, it seems like you just don't get to cash it out.
254000	255760	Here's dlive's terms of service.
255760	259920	You understand that the lino points may not be sold and have no value.
259920	262160	You understand that it is not possible to use
262160	265360	the services to convert lino points into any other value.
265360	268800	Lino points are solely for use in connection with the services,
268800	271120	and there is no opportunity for profit.
271120	274480	Lino points may not be transferred to anyone outside of the site,
274480	277600	and may not be sold or otherwise converted into any value.
277600	281200	So the company is washing its hands of actually letting you get real money
281200	285040	to pay rent or buy groceries with, out of the lino you earn on dlive.
285040	286720	Oh, also, you don't like it?
286720	291920	Well, by using dlive, you waive your right to a trial by jury or a class action lawsuit.
291920	292960	Let's get this straight.
292960	297760	All of dlive's transactions have to happen via the company's proprietary cryptocurrency lino.
297760	300080	A crypto that's managed by the lino network.
300080	303840	A company legally separate from dlive, but has all the same people in it.
303840	307600	Making the claim that dlive doesn't take a cut of your profits technically true,
307600	308960	because dlive doesn't.
308960	310320	The lino network does.
310320	315040	Additionally, lino can't be reliably cashed out with the company back into real currency,
315040	319440	and you have no legal claim regarding accessing your investment in their currency.
319440	323600	Especially when they arbitrarily slap price controls or trade restrictions on it,
323600	325120	which is something we'll get to in a bit.
325120	329120	Of course, you can cash out your lino into real money on dlive using paypal,
329120	333200	but the exchange rate of cashing in versus cashing out is wildly imbalanced.
333200	337440	The worth of lino is arbitrarily set by the company, not by market value.
337440	340720	And as it turns out, according to etherscan, a crypto tracker,
340720	345440	one account holds 99.98% of all lino in existence.
345440	347680	I wonder, I wonder who that is?
347680	348960	Who could that be?
348960	351440	Who could be holding all of the lino in the world?
351440	354400	A cryptocurrency with an arbitrarily controlled value.
354400	357680	No real guarantee that you will ever actually receive that value.
357680	360960	And whose owner works with the streaming service that heavily pushes it.
360960	364880	Also, the source code of lino includes a section allowing the owner of lino
364880	368880	to arbitrarily stop the trading of lino for, you know,
368880	371120	whatever reason they might want to do such a thing.
371120	376080	There's no danger of the company arbitrarily deciding to no longer allow you to buy and sell
376080	379760	your lino once the lino network has turned a profit from all the suckers who have bought
379760	383920	into their worthless hash script, leaving you holding the bag of an untested,
383920	388240	unused currency with absolutely zero value outside of the hermetically sealed
388240	389840	marketplace they've created?
389840	391200	No, that'll never happen.
391200	393600	You're just, you're just paranoid.
393600	396160	Yeah, this is starting to sound pretty shitty to me, guys.
396160	397520	I don't think PewDiePie knows.
397520	401520	I think he genuinely just wants an alternative to the shitty platforms that exist out there.
401520	404560	I don't think he'd knowingly support something that sounds like a pyramid scheme.
404560	407520	But as it turns out, the platform might be just as shitty anyway.
407520	411920	Dlive's hate speech policy checks off all of the usual social justice-y boxes.
411920	415920	And apparently the canary in the coal mine, Alex Jones, has already been banned off of Dlive.
415920	418560	Blockchain technology is a step in the right direction,
418560	421680	but not when the same old oppressive terms of service is attached to it.
421680	425680	I mean, if you really want to use Dlive, just tell your audiences not to buy or trade in
425680	429360	lino while you use it and accept PayPal tips or Streamlabs or something.
429360	431120	But frankly, if it's got the same shitty,
431120	434880	censorious terms of service as Twitch, plus the extra baggage of shady,
434880	438160	nonsense garbage, why not just take your chances with Twitch?
438160	440080	Maybe PewDiePie just made a giant mistake.
440080	444240	Maybe he meant to join Dtube instead of Dlive and just mix it up.
444240	449680	Dtube is a YouTube alternative that, like Dlive, is blockchain-based and uses cryptocurrency.
449680	455200	Unlike Dlive, though, Dtube's crypto monetization does not seem to be centrally controlled with a
455200	460720	kill switch on it, and Dtube has taken a strong free speech stance in its content moderation policy.
460720	465920	And Dtube was heavily courting PewDiePie just before he announced he was coming over to Dlive.
465920	469920	I mean, probably not, but it's hilarious to think Pewds got the name wrong.
469920	473840	In any case, Dlive just seems like the whole bitconnect thing that fell apart last year.
480480	484880	I have a feeling that Dlive is going to be another very public slow-motion train wreck,
484880	489760	and that really sucks because I want viable alternatives to the Silicon Valley oligarchy.
489760	491280	Here's the TLDR.
491280	494880	Lino is owned by a company run by people who also run Dlive.
494880	497440	Dlive's transactions are all based on lino.
497440	500960	Lino's value is arbitrarily set and centrally controlled by the company,
500960	505280	and not only can they devalue it at the drop of a hat if it serves their financial interests to do
505280	509920	so, destroying your stake in the process, they can flip a switch and stop you from trading in lino
509920	514560	at any time, meaning that if you put real money into lino, you might as well just be tossing it
514560	518800	into a dumpster fire. If you still want to use Dlive, use Streamlabs or something,
518800	522080	do not trade in lino, and tell your viewers not to trade in lino.
