00:00.000 --> 00:06.640
Oh boy, my video yesterday was I'm gonna try dlive, and today's video is dlive might be bad guys.

00:06.640 --> 00:10.960
If I were actually a popular youtuber, somebody would make a life comes at you fast meme out of

00:10.960 --> 00:15.520
this. I had heard about dlive before the whole pewdiepie thing actually. I knew it as the site

00:15.520 --> 00:21.040
that Ralph's kill stream took refuge on after he got his ass blacklisted from youtube. Dlive banned

00:21.040 --> 00:26.320
him after like one stream, where he then moved over to stream me, which a few months later cashed

00:26.320 --> 00:31.520
out and closed up shop. Geez, I guess you can abort the retort after all. But dlive went through

00:31.520 --> 00:36.240
a radical restructuring, and took on pewdiepie as a promoted content creator. Pewdiepie announced he

00:36.240 --> 00:40.880
would be using dlive as his exclusive home for streaming content going forward, and that he was

00:40.880 --> 00:46.640
giving out $50,000 in dlive's proprietary cryptocurrency, lino, as a way to draw other

00:46.640 --> 00:51.440
creators to the site. Dlive's technology is blockchain based, making it significantly harder

00:51.440 --> 00:56.080
for outside authorities to censor or regulate, and when pewdiepie made his pitch to the audience,

00:56.080 --> 01:01.360
he did so specifically referencing the fact that blockchain based services are better for creators.

01:01.360 --> 01:06.960
That endorsement, by the way, was a not so subtle jab at youtube and twitch for their draconian,

01:06.960 --> 01:12.000
hypocritical, murky, and arbitrarily enforced policies on things like copyrighted content,

01:12.000 --> 01:15.920
community guidelines, and hate speech. There's a rumor floating around, though,

01:15.920 --> 01:19.040
that dlive's a pyramid scheme. Well, let's take a look.

01:19.040 --> 01:22.080
Dlive declined to comment on how the company expects to earn money.

01:22.080 --> 01:27.600
We are growing fast. Monetizing is not in our short term plans. Our sole focus is on growth.

01:27.600 --> 01:30.000
Really? Well, that sounds a bit strange, doesn't it?

01:30.000 --> 01:34.400
The fellow who made that statement is Wilson Wei, the CEO of the lino network.

01:34.400 --> 01:38.080
Considering that the lino network is run by a bunch of Chinese students who attended

01:38.080 --> 01:43.920
UFC Berkeley, and dlive's CEO was the president of the Chinese Entrepreneurial Association at

01:43.920 --> 01:48.080
UFC Berkeley while they were all at school there, it's probably no surprise these guys

01:48.080 --> 01:51.440
all decided to work together. Wei, even though he's the CEO of the

01:51.440 --> 01:55.920
lino network, was also responsible for the development of dlive's streaming features,

01:55.920 --> 02:00.640
which he posted about on his public blog. And other lino network employees have also

02:00.640 --> 02:04.960
worked on dlive. Basically, despite dlive and the lino network being two different

02:04.960 --> 02:08.960
companies with two different CEOs, they have got largely the same staff.

02:08.960 --> 02:14.160
But Wei, you're really not looking to monetize? I mean, you've taken in 20 million dollars of

02:14.160 --> 02:19.680
surprise surprise Chinese money from Zenfund, a Beijing-based venture capitalist firm.

02:19.680 --> 02:21.840
They've got to be expecting their investment back, right?

02:21.840 --> 02:26.080
A year ago, at dlive's launch, it was using a different cryptocurrency,

02:26.080 --> 02:30.080
steam. But dlive decided to move away from steam and adopt lino.

02:30.080 --> 02:31.600
Here's their statement on the matter.

02:31.600 --> 02:34.720
We've been monitoring the analytics, and we were not able to reward our

02:34.720 --> 02:37.120
content creators with the true value of their content.

02:37.120 --> 02:41.520
Our focus was to grow our user base and build an engaging live streaming and video

02:41.520 --> 02:45.760
community while growing steam as well, and deliver upvotes as evenly as possible

02:45.760 --> 02:49.360
during the last nine months. However, the current economic model of steam

02:49.360 --> 02:52.960
incentivizes large steam holders to continuously upvote their own content,

02:52.960 --> 02:55.520
and other creators who specifically support their content.

02:55.520 --> 03:00.160
This creates an ecosystem where a content's true value can't be recognized or be fairly rewarded.

03:00.160 --> 03:05.280
The dlive steam split happened around September 20th, 2018.

03:05.280 --> 03:09.040
The lino network set up shop in January of 2018.

03:09.040 --> 03:12.240
Remember, with the same people who run dlive under a different banner.

03:12.240 --> 03:15.520
They got their zenfund money in February of 2018.

03:15.520 --> 03:20.160
In March of 2018, dlive wrote about how awesome steam is on medium,

03:20.160 --> 03:23.040
and how they're running experiments on the platform.

03:23.040 --> 03:28.000
In May of 2018, the lino team, including recognizable faces from dlive,

03:28.000 --> 03:31.360
talks about how they're going to use blockchain to take on YouTube.

03:31.360 --> 03:37.680
In September of 2018, dlive swaps steam for lino as their only cryptocurrency,

03:37.680 --> 03:41.920
citing systemic problems with steam. Problems that, to be fair, did exist,

03:41.920 --> 03:45.280
and existed back in March when they claimed the platform was great.

03:45.280 --> 03:49.680
It seems to me that, basically, these dlive kids got into steam in order to learn how

03:49.680 --> 03:52.400
to build their own crypto that they could manage themselves,

03:52.400 --> 03:56.400
and then unceremoniously dumped steam once they obtained the knowledge they needed.

03:56.400 --> 04:00.400
Anyway, after the change, steam's value tanked and hasn't really recovered.

04:00.400 --> 04:04.480
If all of dlive's transactions are in their own proprietary lino currency,

04:04.480 --> 04:06.320
what's to keep that currency from crashing?

04:06.320 --> 04:10.880
And really, where does the money come from when you cash your lino out for real money?

04:10.880 --> 04:14.000
Well, it seems like you just don't get to cash it out.

04:14.000 --> 04:15.760
Here's dlive's terms of service.

04:15.760 --> 04:19.920
You understand that the lino points may not be sold and have no value.

04:19.920 --> 04:22.160
You understand that it is not possible to use

04:22.160 --> 04:25.360
the services to convert lino points into any other value.

04:25.360 --> 04:28.800
Lino points are solely for use in connection with the services,

04:28.800 --> 04:31.120
and there is no opportunity for profit.

04:31.120 --> 04:34.480
Lino points may not be transferred to anyone outside of the site,

04:34.480 --> 04:37.600
and may not be sold or otherwise converted into any value.

04:37.600 --> 04:41.200
So the company is washing its hands of actually letting you get real money

04:41.200 --> 04:45.040
to pay rent or buy groceries with, out of the lino you earn on dlive.

04:45.040 --> 04:46.720
Oh, also, you don't like it?

04:46.720 --> 04:51.920
Well, by using dlive, you waive your right to a trial by jury or a class action lawsuit.

04:51.920 --> 04:52.960
Let's get this straight.

04:52.960 --> 04:57.760
All of dlive's transactions have to happen via the company's proprietary cryptocurrency lino.

04:57.760 --> 05:00.080
A crypto that's managed by the lino network.

05:00.080 --> 05:03.840
A company legally separate from dlive, but has all the same people in it.

05:03.840 --> 05:07.600
Making the claim that dlive doesn't take a cut of your profits technically true,

05:07.600 --> 05:08.960
because dlive doesn't.

05:08.960 --> 05:10.320
The lino network does.

05:10.320 --> 05:15.040
Additionally, lino can't be reliably cashed out with the company back into real currency,

05:15.040 --> 05:19.440
and you have no legal claim regarding accessing your investment in their currency.

05:19.440 --> 05:23.600
Especially when they arbitrarily slap price controls or trade restrictions on it,

05:23.600 --> 05:25.120
which is something we'll get to in a bit.

05:25.120 --> 05:29.120
Of course, you can cash out your lino into real money on dlive using paypal,

05:29.120 --> 05:33.200
but the exchange rate of cashing in versus cashing out is wildly imbalanced.

05:33.200 --> 05:37.440
The worth of lino is arbitrarily set by the company, not by market value.

05:37.440 --> 05:40.720
And as it turns out, according to etherscan, a crypto tracker,

05:40.720 --> 05:45.440
one account holds 99.98% of all lino in existence.

05:45.440 --> 05:47.680
I wonder, I wonder who that is?

05:47.680 --> 05:48.960
Who could that be?

05:48.960 --> 05:51.440
Who could be holding all of the lino in the world?

05:51.440 --> 05:54.400
A cryptocurrency with an arbitrarily controlled value.

05:54.400 --> 05:57.680
No real guarantee that you will ever actually receive that value.

05:57.680 --> 06:00.960
And whose owner works with the streaming service that heavily pushes it.

06:00.960 --> 06:04.880
Also, the source code of lino includes a section allowing the owner of lino

06:04.880 --> 06:08.880
to arbitrarily stop the trading of lino for, you know,

06:08.880 --> 06:11.120
whatever reason they might want to do such a thing.

06:11.120 --> 06:16.080
There's no danger of the company arbitrarily deciding to no longer allow you to buy and sell

06:16.080 --> 06:19.760
your lino once the lino network has turned a profit from all the suckers who have bought

06:19.760 --> 06:23.920
into their worthless hash script, leaving you holding the bag of an untested,

06:23.920 --> 06:28.240
unused currency with absolutely zero value outside of the hermetically sealed

06:28.240 --> 06:29.840
marketplace they've created?

06:29.840 --> 06:31.200
No, that'll never happen.

06:31.200 --> 06:33.600
You're just, you're just paranoid.

06:33.600 --> 06:36.160
Yeah, this is starting to sound pretty shitty to me, guys.

06:36.160 --> 06:37.520
I don't think PewDiePie knows.

06:37.520 --> 06:41.520
I think he genuinely just wants an alternative to the shitty platforms that exist out there.

06:41.520 --> 06:44.560
I don't think he'd knowingly support something that sounds like a pyramid scheme.

06:44.560 --> 06:47.520
But as it turns out, the platform might be just as shitty anyway.

06:47.520 --> 06:51.920
Dlive's hate speech policy checks off all of the usual social justice-y boxes.

06:51.920 --> 06:55.920
And apparently the canary in the coal mine, Alex Jones, has already been banned off of Dlive.

06:55.920 --> 06:58.560
Blockchain technology is a step in the right direction,

06:58.560 --> 07:01.680
but not when the same old oppressive terms of service is attached to it.

07:01.680 --> 07:05.680
I mean, if you really want to use Dlive, just tell your audiences not to buy or trade in

07:05.680 --> 07:09.360
lino while you use it and accept PayPal tips or Streamlabs or something.

07:09.360 --> 07:11.120
But frankly, if it's got the same shitty,

07:11.120 --> 07:14.880
censorious terms of service as Twitch, plus the extra baggage of shady,

07:14.880 --> 07:18.160
nonsense garbage, why not just take your chances with Twitch?

07:18.160 --> 07:20.080
Maybe PewDiePie just made a giant mistake.

07:20.080 --> 07:24.240
Maybe he meant to join Dtube instead of Dlive and just mix it up.

07:24.240 --> 07:29.680
Dtube is a YouTube alternative that, like Dlive, is blockchain-based and uses cryptocurrency.

07:29.680 --> 07:35.200
Unlike Dlive, though, Dtube's crypto monetization does not seem to be centrally controlled with a

07:35.200 --> 07:40.720
kill switch on it, and Dtube has taken a strong free speech stance in its content moderation policy.

07:40.720 --> 07:45.920
And Dtube was heavily courting PewDiePie just before he announced he was coming over to Dlive.

07:45.920 --> 07:49.920
I mean, probably not, but it's hilarious to think Pewds got the name wrong.

07:49.920 --> 07:53.840
In any case, Dlive just seems like the whole bitconnect thing that fell apart last year.

08:00.480 --> 08:04.880
I have a feeling that Dlive is going to be another very public slow-motion train wreck,

08:04.880 --> 08:09.760
and that really sucks because I want viable alternatives to the Silicon Valley oligarchy.

08:09.760 --> 08:11.280
Here's the TLDR.

08:11.280 --> 08:14.880
Lino is owned by a company run by people who also run Dlive.

08:14.880 --> 08:17.440
Dlive's transactions are all based on lino.

08:17.440 --> 08:20.960
Lino's value is arbitrarily set and centrally controlled by the company,

08:20.960 --> 08:25.280
and not only can they devalue it at the drop of a hat if it serves their financial interests to do

08:25.280 --> 08:29.920
so, destroying your stake in the process, they can flip a switch and stop you from trading in lino

08:29.920 --> 08:34.560
at any time, meaning that if you put real money into lino, you might as well just be tossing it

08:34.560 --> 08:38.800
into a dumpster fire. If you still want to use Dlive, use Streamlabs or something,

08:38.800 --> 08:42.080
do not trade in lino, and tell your viewers not to trade in lino.
