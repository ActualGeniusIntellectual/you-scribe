1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,640
Oh boy, my video yesterday was I'm gonna try dlive, and today's video is dlive might be bad guys.

2
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:10,960
If I were actually a popular youtuber, somebody would make a life comes at you fast meme out of

3
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:15,520
this. I had heard about dlive before the whole pewdiepie thing actually. I knew it as the site

4
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:21,040
that Ralph's kill stream took refuge on after he got his ass blacklisted from youtube. Dlive banned

5
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:26,320
him after like one stream, where he then moved over to stream me, which a few months later cashed

6
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:31,520
out and closed up shop. Geez, I guess you can abort the retort after all. But dlive went through

7
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:36,240
a radical restructuring, and took on pewdiepie as a promoted content creator. Pewdiepie announced he

8
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:40,880
would be using dlive as his exclusive home for streaming content going forward, and that he was

9
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:46,640
giving out $50,000 in dlive's proprietary cryptocurrency, lino, as a way to draw other

10
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:51,440
creators to the site. Dlive's technology is blockchain based, making it significantly harder

11
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:56,080
for outside authorities to censor or regulate, and when pewdiepie made his pitch to the audience,

12
00:00:56,080 --> 00:01:01,360
he did so specifically referencing the fact that blockchain based services are better for creators.

13
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:06,960
That endorsement, by the way, was a not so subtle jab at youtube and twitch for their draconian,

14
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:12,000
hypocritical, murky, and arbitrarily enforced policies on things like copyrighted content,

15
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,920
community guidelines, and hate speech. There's a rumor floating around, though,

16
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:19,040
that dlive's a pyramid scheme. Well, let's take a look.

17
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:22,080
Dlive declined to comment on how the company expects to earn money.

18
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:27,600
We are growing fast. Monetizing is not in our short term plans. Our sole focus is on growth.

19
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,000
Really? Well, that sounds a bit strange, doesn't it?

20
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,400
The fellow who made that statement is Wilson Wei, the CEO of the lino network.

21
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:38,080
Considering that the lino network is run by a bunch of Chinese students who attended

22
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:43,920
UFC Berkeley, and dlive's CEO was the president of the Chinese Entrepreneurial Association at

23
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:48,080
UFC Berkeley while they were all at school there, it's probably no surprise these guys

24
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:51,440
all decided to work together. Wei, even though he's the CEO of the

25
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:55,920
lino network, was also responsible for the development of dlive's streaming features,

26
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:00,640
which he posted about on his public blog. And other lino network employees have also

27
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:04,960
worked on dlive. Basically, despite dlive and the lino network being two different

28
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:08,960
companies with two different CEOs, they have got largely the same staff.

29
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:14,160
But Wei, you're really not looking to monetize? I mean, you've taken in 20 million dollars of

30
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:19,680
surprise surprise Chinese money from Zenfund, a Beijing-based venture capitalist firm.

31
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,840
They've got to be expecting their investment back, right?

32
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:26,080
A year ago, at dlive's launch, it was using a different cryptocurrency,

33
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:30,080
steam. But dlive decided to move away from steam and adopt lino.

34
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,600
Here's their statement on the matter.

35
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:34,720
We've been monitoring the analytics, and we were not able to reward our

36
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:37,120
content creators with the true value of their content.

37
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:41,520
Our focus was to grow our user base and build an engaging live streaming and video

38
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:45,760
community while growing steam as well, and deliver upvotes as evenly as possible

39
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:49,360
during the last nine months. However, the current economic model of steam

40
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:52,960
incentivizes large steam holders to continuously upvote their own content,

41
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:55,520
and other creators who specifically support their content.

42
00:02:55,520 --> 00:03:00,160
This creates an ecosystem where a content's true value can't be recognized or be fairly rewarded.

43
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:05,280
The dlive steam split happened around September 20th, 2018.

44
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:09,040
The lino network set up shop in January of 2018.

45
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:12,240
Remember, with the same people who run dlive under a different banner.

46
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:15,520
They got their zenfund money in February of 2018.

47
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:20,160
In March of 2018, dlive wrote about how awesome steam is on medium,

48
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:23,040
and how they're running experiments on the platform.

49
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:28,000
In May of 2018, the lino team, including recognizable faces from dlive,

50
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,360
talks about how they're going to use blockchain to take on YouTube.

51
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:37,680
In September of 2018, dlive swaps steam for lino as their only cryptocurrency,

52
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:41,920
citing systemic problems with steam. Problems that, to be fair, did exist,

53
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:45,280
and existed back in March when they claimed the platform was great.

54
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:49,680
It seems to me that, basically, these dlive kids got into steam in order to learn how

55
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:52,400
to build their own crypto that they could manage themselves,

56
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:56,400
and then unceremoniously dumped steam once they obtained the knowledge they needed.

57
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:00,400
Anyway, after the change, steam's value tanked and hasn't really recovered.

58
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:04,480
If all of dlive's transactions are in their own proprietary lino currency,

59
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,320
what's to keep that currency from crashing?

60
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:10,880
And really, where does the money come from when you cash your lino out for real money?

61
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:14,000
Well, it seems like you just don't get to cash it out.

62
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,760
Here's dlive's terms of service.

63
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:19,920
You understand that the lino points may not be sold and have no value.

64
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:22,160
You understand that it is not possible to use

65
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:25,360
the services to convert lino points into any other value.

66
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:28,800
Lino points are solely for use in connection with the services,

67
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,120
and there is no opportunity for profit.

68
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:34,480
Lino points may not be transferred to anyone outside of the site,

69
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:37,600
and may not be sold or otherwise converted into any value.

70
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:41,200
So the company is washing its hands of actually letting you get real money

71
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:45,040
to pay rent or buy groceries with, out of the lino you earn on dlive.

72
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,720
Oh, also, you don't like it?

73
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:51,920
Well, by using dlive, you waive your right to a trial by jury or a class action lawsuit.

74
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:52,960
Let's get this straight.

75
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:57,760
All of dlive's transactions have to happen via the company's proprietary cryptocurrency lino.

76
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:00,080
A crypto that's managed by the lino network.

77
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:03,840
A company legally separate from dlive, but has all the same people in it.

78
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:07,600
Making the claim that dlive doesn't take a cut of your profits technically true,

79
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,960
because dlive doesn't.

80
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,320
The lino network does.

81
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:15,040
Additionally, lino can't be reliably cashed out with the company back into real currency,

82
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:19,440
and you have no legal claim regarding accessing your investment in their currency.

83
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:23,600
Especially when they arbitrarily slap price controls or trade restrictions on it,

84
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,120
which is something we'll get to in a bit.

85
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:29,120
Of course, you can cash out your lino into real money on dlive using paypal,

86
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:33,200
but the exchange rate of cashing in versus cashing out is wildly imbalanced.

87
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:37,440
The worth of lino is arbitrarily set by the company, not by market value.

88
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:40,720
And as it turns out, according to etherscan, a crypto tracker,

89
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:45,440
one account holds 99.98% of all lino in existence.

90
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,680
I wonder, I wonder who that is?

91
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:48,960
Who could that be?

92
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:51,440
Who could be holding all of the lino in the world?

93
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:54,400
A cryptocurrency with an arbitrarily controlled value.

94
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:57,680
No real guarantee that you will ever actually receive that value.

95
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:00,960
And whose owner works with the streaming service that heavily pushes it.

96
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:04,880
Also, the source code of lino includes a section allowing the owner of lino

97
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:08,880
to arbitrarily stop the trading of lino for, you know,

98
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:11,120
whatever reason they might want to do such a thing.

99
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:16,080
There's no danger of the company arbitrarily deciding to no longer allow you to buy and sell

100
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:19,760
your lino once the lino network has turned a profit from all the suckers who have bought

101
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:23,920
into their worthless hash script, leaving you holding the bag of an untested,

102
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:28,240
unused currency with absolutely zero value outside of the hermetically sealed

103
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,840
marketplace they've created?

104
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,200
No, that'll never happen.

105
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:33,600
You're just, you're just paranoid.

106
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,160
Yeah, this is starting to sound pretty shitty to me, guys.

107
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,520
I don't think PewDiePie knows.

108
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:41,520
I think he genuinely just wants an alternative to the shitty platforms that exist out there.

109
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:44,560
I don't think he'd knowingly support something that sounds like a pyramid scheme.

110
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:47,520
But as it turns out, the platform might be just as shitty anyway.

111
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:51,920
Dlive's hate speech policy checks off all of the usual social justice-y boxes.

112
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:55,920
And apparently the canary in the coal mine, Alex Jones, has already been banned off of Dlive.

113
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:58,560
Blockchain technology is a step in the right direction,

114
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:01,680
but not when the same old oppressive terms of service is attached to it.

115
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:05,680
I mean, if you really want to use Dlive, just tell your audiences not to buy or trade in

116
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:09,360
lino while you use it and accept PayPal tips or Streamlabs or something.

117
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,120
But frankly, if it's got the same shitty,

118
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:14,880
censorious terms of service as Twitch, plus the extra baggage of shady,

119
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:18,160
nonsense garbage, why not just take your chances with Twitch?

120
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,080
Maybe PewDiePie just made a giant mistake.

121
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:24,240
Maybe he meant to join Dtube instead of Dlive and just mix it up.

122
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:29,680
Dtube is a YouTube alternative that, like Dlive, is blockchain-based and uses cryptocurrency.

123
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:35,200
Unlike Dlive, though, Dtube's crypto monetization does not seem to be centrally controlled with a

124
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:40,720
kill switch on it, and Dtube has taken a strong free speech stance in its content moderation policy.

125
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:45,920
And Dtube was heavily courting PewDiePie just before he announced he was coming over to Dlive.

126
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:49,920
I mean, probably not, but it's hilarious to think Pewds got the name wrong.

127
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:53,840
In any case, Dlive just seems like the whole bitconnect thing that fell apart last year.

128
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:04,880
I have a feeling that Dlive is going to be another very public slow-motion train wreck,

129
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:09,760
and that really sucks because I want viable alternatives to the Silicon Valley oligarchy.

130
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:11,280
Here's the TLDR.

131
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:14,880
Lino is owned by a company run by people who also run Dlive.

132
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:17,440
Dlive's transactions are all based on lino.

133
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:20,960
Lino's value is arbitrarily set and centrally controlled by the company,

134
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:25,280
and not only can they devalue it at the drop of a hat if it serves their financial interests to do

135
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:29,920
so, destroying your stake in the process, they can flip a switch and stop you from trading in lino

136
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:34,560
at any time, meaning that if you put real money into lino, you might as well just be tossing it

137
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:38,800
into a dumpster fire. If you still want to use Dlive, use Streamlabs or something,

138
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:42,080
do not trade in lino, and tell your viewers not to trade in lino.
