0	12280	Let's leave behind the situation in America for a while and talk about Mizzie.
12280	16600	I mentioned in my video about the idiot celebrity who crashed a plane for YouTube views and
16600	20120	Ridge Wallet money that edgy old YouTube was actually really fun.
20120	25040	However, it incentivized people to do ever more extreme stunts in order to chase virality.
25040	27700	By the way, that video got age restricted for some reason.
27700	28700	No idea why.
28700	29700	Thanks YouTube.
29700	32840	Another area of that side of content creation was prank YouTube.
32840	36020	Prank YouTube came about when people wanted to create shocking content but didn't want
36020	37620	to break their backs doing it.
37620	41280	The most famous prank channel from back in the day, as far as I can recall, was Prank
41280	44880	vs Prank, where a couple routinely set up hidden cameras around their house and prank
44880	45880	each other.
45880	49700	Their videos were actually pretty entertaining, but ultimately corrosive to their relationship,
49700	54100	as they ended up breaking up in 2016 over what seems to be a consistent inability to
54100	55100	trust each other.
55100	59560	Unlike extreme stunt content, prank content has survived up until the present day, with
59560	61280	zoomers getting in on the mix.
61280	62280	Seems obvious to me.
62280	65940	Boys from my dad's generation might have put a whoopee cushion underneath a teacher's
65940	68120	chair, or put a fake spider on their desk.
68120	72100	While during the height of pranking online, people were using the exact same fake spiders
72100	74300	and stuff, but uploading the reactions to Vine.
74300	78000	There's something cross-generational about kids fucking around and having a laugh.
78000	80380	But that doesn't mean it hasn't been a bumpy ride.
80380	84380	Prank channels hit a rapid decline on YouTube after 2016, not because of the prank vs prank
84380	85380	split.
85380	86380	That was just coincidental.
86380	91500	At some point, people began faking the pranks in order to chase a greater and greater audience
91500	92500	payoff.
92500	95820	Sometimes, you can still come across prank channels on TikTok, and they are horribly
95820	96820	manufactured.
96820	97820	Like, look at this.
97820	101740	These people are clearly living in LA at a content house, and this entire thing is just
101740	102740	scripted.
102740	103740	It's all fake.
103740	106380	You can tell by looking at their body language they're putting on a show.
106380	110260	Ironically, the most interesting prank videos in the post-fake period are the ones where
110260	114460	something actually unexpected happens, outside of the bounds of the fake prank.
114460	118140	Like a bystander kicking the shit out of a prankster, thinking that it's not fake.
118140	119740	Which leads us to Mizzy.
119740	124160	Mizzy is 18 years old, born in 2004, though he's been making content for at least a
124160	129420	year so far, doing some rather ridiculous, and yes, very real pranks.
129420	133080	He's a UK citizen, born in London, and yes, he's black.
133080	136460	People have made a lot of noise about him being black, and while some of that is just
136460	139940	racism, there is something else going on here that must be discussed.
139940	143460	Mizzy was thrust into the spotlight a couple of weeks ago with this viral clip.
169940	188780	Yes, this was the prank.
188780	192820	Walking into random people's houses, and just sitting down and watching them react.
192820	196540	Man, if you did this in America, you'd be turned into Swiss cheese real quick.
196540	199660	The issue here is that this misses the ultimate point of a prank.
199660	202660	When you prank somebody, yes, you do catch them by surprise.
202660	206060	But by the end of the ordeal, there's an understanding that there was never any real
206060	207060	danger.
207060	208060	Everyone was cool.
208060	209060	Everyone gets a chuckle out of it.
209060	211740	That logic makes sense if we're talking about a fake spider dropping into somebody's
211740	214520	shoulder, or if you startle somebody when they turn the corner, but it suddenly feels
214520	218400	quite a bit different when you're walking into somebody's private house.
218400	221780	After this video went viral, people began to check out Mizzy's channels, and discovered
221780	225740	that a lot of the pranks he was pulling on random strangers just went too far, at least
225740	226820	for most people.
226820	230480	Another notable example is the one where he walked up to a woman, and just grabbed her
230480	255940	dog and ran away.
255940	259620	It reminds me quite a bit of the guy in the previous video who threatened to do just that
259620	262980	to the woman in Central Park, and she reacted appropriately, nobody wants their beloved
262980	263980	pet stolen.
263980	267220	And then there was that time he walked into a library, and just began ripping pages out
267220	268220	of books.
298220	314220	Tic-tock video ripping books, no?
314220	318020	Excuse me, what's going on, guys?
318020	319020	This is not, this is not...
319020	320020	Is that your book from home?
320020	321020	No, it's not.
321020	322020	Is it from the library?
322020	323020	Yeah.
323020	324020	Then that, you cannot do that, guys.
324020	325020	Why can't I do that?
325020	326020	Because it's a library.
326820	329460	The library, if I can get books from the library, why can't I rip the pages out of the books
329460	330460	as well?
330460	331460	Because then other people can't use them.
331460	333460	So who gives a fuck about other people?
333460	335460	Let me get this, sorry.
335460	338060	Can you get Adam, please?
338060	342100	This one could count as an acceptable prank if he paid for the books he destroyed, but
342100	345620	Mizzy's stuff generally moves beyond harmless pranking.
345620	350720	Yeah, he's certainly surprising people, but he's doing so by legitimately being a nuisance.
350720	354380	After the initial shock has worn off, it's not replaced with relief and understanding,
354380	356020	it's replaced with annoyance.
356020	358420	And here's where we have to have the race conversation.
358420	359420	Watch this clip.
384380	405100	Yeah, the yelling's annoying, but listen to what he says afterward.
405100	407100	And this isn't the only time he's done this.
407100	426700	Here's the explanation of this prank.
426700	430940	Mizzy knows that among the white middle class of the UK, there is a stereotype about young
430940	435300	black inner city boys who dress like him, talk in his accent, and carry themselves in
435300	437860	the way that he's deliberately doing in these videos.
437860	442180	The stereotype is that they are violent immigrants who don't care about British law or cultural
442180	443180	norms.
443180	447020	At first glance, Mizzy doesn't seem to be that kind of guy, but he knows of the stereotype,
447020	466940	and he's using it to make people scared to just be around him.
466940	495060	This
495060	498180	is not the flashpoint fear that you feel during a shock.
498180	501180	This is inducing genuine, lasting terror.
501180	502940	Like I said, if this were America, this wouldn't be tolerated.
502940	505100	Hell, forget about the states and their guns.
505100	508420	Most men who are watching this right now, you're probably thinking back to how you were
508420	510940	in your teenage years, where you would have just got up and punched the guy.
510940	512420	That's a pretty normal sentiment.
512420	514940	You don't have to be good at fighting or anything like that, most guys aren't.
514940	519020	But I can't think of anybody who would just let this sort of intimidation slide without
519020	520700	trying to intimidate back.
520700	522760	And yet, there's no retaliation in these videos.
522760	526840	Is it because the UK is full of cucked soyboys who don't want to appear racist?
526840	527840	Maybe.
527840	530840	Is it because the UK's laws are set up such that the indigenous Britain would be treated
530840	533720	harshly while the immigrant is let off with a slap on the wrist?
533720	534720	Maybe.
534720	536200	But for that second one, maybe not.
536200	560880	Mizzy was, for a short time, very happy with his newfound internet stardom.
560880	562620	But it very quickly crumbled away.
562620	566560	In May of 2022, when he first started doing this sort of content, he was slapped with
566560	570180	a community protection notice, prohibiting him from trespassing on private property.
570180	575340	As a result of these new clips going viral, on May 15th, 2023, he was fined for violating
575340	578620	that notice and given a two-year criminal behaviour order.
578620	583560	A CBO in the UK legal system is basically a fast track for legal action if violated
583560	586980	since you've already proven yourself to be capable of committing a similar type of crime
586980	588320	that the order prohibits.
588320	593020	On the same day as the fine, Mizzy went on to Piers Morgan to talk about the situation.
593020	615760	As expected, Mizzy tried to make the conversation about race.
615760	619740	Race is also what the mainstream media and leftoids online focused on, because the progs
619740	621960	are actually ridiculous when it comes to this shit.
621960	625480	They believe that if you object to a black person infringing on your rights, you're
625480	626480	a racist.
626480	628200	But Piers Morgan didn't say anything wrong in this interview.
628200	630640	Everybody is at least partially a part of their upbringing.
630640	634720	A white Mizzy acting exactly the same way probably also had shit parents.
634720	638240	Though to be honest, considering that the articles talking about Mizzy's legal troubles
638240	642560	all reference him having to move back in with his mother in Hackney, not his family, and
642560	646280	referencing no father at all, it's likely that either his parents are split up, or his
646280	647960	dad just isn't in the picture.
647960	650240	Which wouldn't be too surprising given his behavior.
650240	670560	However, in my opinion, the more telling bit of the interview was this clip.
700560	709800	Mizzy's actually completely correct here.
709800	711520	The UK's laws are weak.
711520	712520	Look at his body language.
712520	716960	He just got fined that very same day and he shrugs it off, because he knows the tolerance
716960	720280	of the society that he lives in will allow him to get away with nonsense.
720280	725340	But after a year of online tomfoolery, he finally did push things to the breaking point.
725340	729680	In the two-day space between the Piers Morgan interview and Mizzy's arrest, he uploaded
729680	733440	two more videos to TikTok, a blatant violation of the CBO.
733440	736940	Mizzy's YouTube and TikTok channels have been deleted at this point, so it's hard
736940	741360	to know which videos were uploaded, but most people online claim that at least one of them
741360	745760	was this clip, where the prank in question was Mizzy barging into the conductor's room
745760	774960	of a subway train.
774960	780020	It was this violation of the CBO that led to his arrest on May 26, 2023.
780020	785080	He appeared in court the next day to plead not guilty and was granted bail on the 30th
785080	787760	on the condition that he move back in with his mother in Hackney.
787760	790440	His trial date is set for July 19th.
790440	794720	Mizzy finally might be coming around to an understanding that he's stuck in a legal
794720	799400	quagmire, that he actually is going to face some repercussions for his actions, because
799400	803800	the official Mizzy Twitter account has been going around asking people to remove old Mizzy
803800	808280	clips and telling people that Mizzy is in fact still under arrest and that these clips
808280	811960	are old, not new videos of Mizzy terrorizing more people.
811960	816600	So until that July 19th trial, this seems like the end of Mizzy's story.
816600	820120	He went viral very quickly for doing some pretty objectionable stuff, and despite his
820120	823720	protest that British society was weak for allowing him to fuck around much as he did,
823720	825660	he is finally beginning to find out.
825660	827240	But there's a wider issue here.
827240	831260	The pranks that Mizzy pulled depended on a specific understanding of racial dynamics
831260	832380	in the UK.
832380	836680	The middle-class white Briton who reads news stories about black inner-city youth who look
836680	841500	and talk and carry themselves in a specific way, constantly stabbing each other and macheting
841500	842500	each other.
842500	845660	And then the white Briton finds one of those inner-city youth approaching them with their
845660	848500	hands in their pockets saying, do you want to die?
848500	849500	That's the prank.
849500	850500	That's the source of the fear.
850500	854980	And it has the added layer of, if you react in any way other than complete submission
854980	859060	to this ritual of humiliation, you're branded as a racist by the progressives.
859060	860060	Here's the thing though.
860060	861060	Isn't that like this?
861060	863460	Mizzy's kind of a side character in his own story.
863460	866780	He's exploiting a pre-existing racial dynamic, but he didn't create it.
866780	868540	He's not actually stabbing anybody.
868540	871440	He didn't create the culture of knife crime among London immigrants.
871440	874960	He didn't create the culture of political correctness that indigenous Britons find themselves
874960	875960	living under.
875960	878540	And in his defense, he knows what that culture is.
878540	880180	He's been living in it his whole life.
880180	882980	He knows there's far worse than him out there, and he's seen it himself.
882980	883980	We're just youth from the end, yeah?
883980	884980	Trying to make it fucking out.
884980	885980	You get me?
885980	886980	We're trying to make it out, bro.
886980	887980	Like, cool.
887980	889300	The intention of that video was for it to get some traction and some viewers, but it
889300	892020	was never to cause threat or intend any mental harm on anyone, bro.
892020	893020	Like, do you get me?
893020	894020	It just blew out of proportion.
894020	895020	Like, more than possible.
895020	896020	No one is trying to threaten anyone.
896020	897020	I know this guy personally, and he has no malicious intent.
897020	898020	Like, you're forgetting.
898020	899020	Yes, yes, yes.
899020	900020	He does have a son, bro.
900020	901020	We're all trying to make it out, bro.
901020	902020	That's what you say.
902020	903020	We're in the end.
903020	904020	Cool.
904020	905020	What are we trying to do about it?
905020	906020	We're not out here stabbing people up, bro.
906020	907020	We're making fucking videos.
907020	908020	Some videos may not be the right approach to some things, but look, I ain't at work.
908020	909020	I could have went to the house on a matine.
909020	910020	I've seen people record themselves going to houses.
910020	913220	They've degraded so much, at least in the neighborhoods of London that they're talking
913220	917380	about getting out of, that what Mizzie does is actually considered tame.
917380	922280	And that's a problem because the rest of the world views those tame pranks as gross violations.
922280	925700	Because by the standards of a place that isn't a fucking shithole, they actually are gross
925700	926700	violations.
926700	929700	Remember, pranks were once whoopee cushions and fake spiders.
929700	933260	Not putting your hands in your pockets and asking people if they want to get fucking
933260	934260	shanked.
934260	937460	In other words, while Mizzie himself is annoying and certainly deserving of all the punishment
937460	940260	coming his way, he's also the symptom of a larger problem.
940260	944580	And unlike his contemporaries who actually do turn to crime, he's using one of the few
944580	948700	non-violent methods at his disposal to try and get out of there, going viral and making
948700	949700	some money.
949700	952180	I can sympathize with him, even though I think he's a shithead.
952180	954540	Anyway, that's the story of Mizzie.
954540	958660	I almost did that first viral video on TikTok Tuesdays, but something in the back of my
958660	960300	mind said, hold off.
960300	961340	There's more to this.
961340	964700	It's worth more than just a throwaway video, and I'm glad I did.
964700	966940	Mizzie is responsible for the minor crimes he's committed.
966940	970740	Probably some harassment in there, probably some trespass, but he's ultimately a response
970740	974060	to the degenerating inner-city youth culture that he finds himself in.
974060	978220	He didn't create this culture, and the people who did care nothing for those who have to
978220	983180	endure it beyond simply checking off a diversity box on some government official's spreadsheet.
