00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,280
Let's leave behind the situation in America for a while and talk about Mizzie.

2
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:16,600
I mentioned in my video about the idiot celebrity who crashed a plane for YouTube views and

3
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:20,120
Ridge Wallet money that edgy old YouTube was actually really fun.

4
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:25,040
However, it incentivized people to do ever more extreme stunts in order to chase virality.

5
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:27,700
By the way, that video got age restricted for some reason.

6
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:28,700
No idea why.

7
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:29,700
Thanks YouTube.

8
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:32,840
Another area of that side of content creation was prank YouTube.

9
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:36,020
Prank YouTube came about when people wanted to create shocking content but didn't want

10
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:37,620
to break their backs doing it.

11
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:41,280
The most famous prank channel from back in the day, as far as I can recall, was Prank

12
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:44,880
vs Prank, where a couple routinely set up hidden cameras around their house and prank

13
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:45,880
each other.

14
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:49,700
Their videos were actually pretty entertaining, but ultimately corrosive to their relationship,

15
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:54,100
as they ended up breaking up in 2016 over what seems to be a consistent inability to

16
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:55,100
trust each other.

17
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:59,560
Unlike extreme stunt content, prank content has survived up until the present day, with

18
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:01,280
zoomers getting in on the mix.

19
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:02,280
Seems obvious to me.

20
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:05,940
Boys from my dad's generation might have put a whoopee cushion underneath a teacher's

21
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:08,120
chair, or put a fake spider on their desk.

22
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:12,100
While during the height of pranking online, people were using the exact same fake spiders

23
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:14,300
and stuff, but uploading the reactions to Vine.

24
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:18,000
There's something cross-generational about kids fucking around and having a laugh.

25
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,380
But that doesn't mean it hasn't been a bumpy ride.

26
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:24,380
Prank channels hit a rapid decline on YouTube after 2016, not because of the prank vs prank

27
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:25,380
split.

28
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:26,380
That was just coincidental.

29
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:31,500
At some point, people began faking the pranks in order to chase a greater and greater audience

30
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:32,500
payoff.

31
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:35,820
Sometimes, you can still come across prank channels on TikTok, and they are horribly

32
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:36,820
manufactured.

33
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:37,820
Like, look at this.

34
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:41,740
These people are clearly living in LA at a content house, and this entire thing is just

35
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:42,740
scripted.

36
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:43,740
It's all fake.

37
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:46,380
You can tell by looking at their body language they're putting on a show.

38
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:50,260
Ironically, the most interesting prank videos in the post-fake period are the ones where

39
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:54,460
something actually unexpected happens, outside of the bounds of the fake prank.

40
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:58,140
Like a bystander kicking the shit out of a prankster, thinking that it's not fake.

41
00:01:58,140 --> 00:01:59,740
Which leads us to Mizzy.

42
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:04,160
Mizzy is 18 years old, born in 2004, though he's been making content for at least a

43
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:09,420
year so far, doing some rather ridiculous, and yes, very real pranks.

44
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:13,080
He's a UK citizen, born in London, and yes, he's black.

45
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:16,460
People have made a lot of noise about him being black, and while some of that is just

46
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:19,940
racism, there is something else going on here that must be discussed.

47
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:23,460
Mizzy was thrust into the spotlight a couple of weeks ago with this viral clip.

48
00:02:49,940 --> 00:03:08,780
Yes, this was the prank.

49
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:12,820
Walking into random people's houses, and just sitting down and watching them react.

50
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:16,540
Man, if you did this in America, you'd be turned into Swiss cheese real quick.

51
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:19,660
The issue here is that this misses the ultimate point of a prank.

52
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:22,660
When you prank somebody, yes, you do catch them by surprise.

53
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:26,060
But by the end of the ordeal, there's an understanding that there was never any real

54
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:27,060
danger.

55
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:28,060
Everyone was cool.

56
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:29,060
Everyone gets a chuckle out of it.

57
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:31,740
That logic makes sense if we're talking about a fake spider dropping into somebody's

58
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:34,520
shoulder, or if you startle somebody when they turn the corner, but it suddenly feels

59
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:38,400
quite a bit different when you're walking into somebody's private house.

60
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,780
After this video went viral, people began to check out Mizzy's channels, and discovered

61
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:45,740
that a lot of the pranks he was pulling on random strangers just went too far, at least

62
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:46,820
for most people.

63
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:50,480
Another notable example is the one where he walked up to a woman, and just grabbed her

64
00:03:50,480 --> 00:04:15,940
dog and ran away.

65
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:19,620
It reminds me quite a bit of the guy in the previous video who threatened to do just that

66
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:22,980
to the woman in Central Park, and she reacted appropriately, nobody wants their beloved

67
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:23,980
pet stolen.

68
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:27,220
And then there was that time he walked into a library, and just began ripping pages out

69
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:28,220
of books.

70
00:04:58,220 --> 00:05:14,220
Tic-tock video ripping books, no?

71
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:18,020
Excuse me, what's going on, guys?

72
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:19,020
This is not, this is not...

73
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:20,020
Is that your book from home?

74
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:21,020
No, it's not.

75
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:22,020
Is it from the library?

76
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:23,020
Yeah.

77
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:24,020
Then that, you cannot do that, guys.

78
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:25,020
Why can't I do that?

79
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:26,020
Because it's a library.

80
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:29,460
The library, if I can get books from the library, why can't I rip the pages out of the books

81
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:30,460
as well?

82
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:31,460
Because then other people can't use them.

83
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:33,460
So who gives a fuck about other people?

84
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:35,460
Let me get this, sorry.

85
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:38,060
Can you get Adam, please?

86
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:42,100
This one could count as an acceptable prank if he paid for the books he destroyed, but

87
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:45,620
Mizzy's stuff generally moves beyond harmless pranking.

88
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:50,720
Yeah, he's certainly surprising people, but he's doing so by legitimately being a nuisance.

89
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:54,380
After the initial shock has worn off, it's not replaced with relief and understanding,

90
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:56,020
it's replaced with annoyance.

91
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:58,420
And here's where we have to have the race conversation.

92
00:05:58,420 --> 00:05:59,420
Watch this clip.

93
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:45,100
Yeah, the yelling's annoying, but listen to what he says afterward.

94
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:47,100
And this isn't the only time he's done this.

95
00:06:47,100 --> 00:07:06,700
Here's the explanation of this prank.

96
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:10,940
Mizzy knows that among the white middle class of the UK, there is a stereotype about young

97
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:15,300
black inner city boys who dress like him, talk in his accent, and carry themselves in

98
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:17,860
the way that he's deliberately doing in these videos.

99
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:22,180
The stereotype is that they are violent immigrants who don't care about British law or cultural

100
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:23,180
norms.

101
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:27,020
At first glance, Mizzy doesn't seem to be that kind of guy, but he knows of the stereotype,

102
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:46,940
and he's using it to make people scared to just be around him.

103
00:07:46,940 --> 00:08:15,060
This

104
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:18,180
is not the flashpoint fear that you feel during a shock.

105
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:21,180
This is inducing genuine, lasting terror.

106
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:22,940
Like I said, if this were America, this wouldn't be tolerated.

107
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:25,100
Hell, forget about the states and their guns.

108
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:28,420
Most men who are watching this right now, you're probably thinking back to how you were

109
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:30,940
in your teenage years, where you would have just got up and punched the guy.

110
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:32,420
That's a pretty normal sentiment.

111
00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:34,940
You don't have to be good at fighting or anything like that, most guys aren't.

112
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:39,020
But I can't think of anybody who would just let this sort of intimidation slide without

113
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:40,700
trying to intimidate back.

114
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:42,760
And yet, there's no retaliation in these videos.

115
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:46,840
Is it because the UK is full of cucked soyboys who don't want to appear racist?

116
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:47,840
Maybe.

117
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:50,840
Is it because the UK's laws are set up such that the indigenous Britain would be treated

118
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:53,720
harshly while the immigrant is let off with a slap on the wrist?

119
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:54,720
Maybe.

120
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,200
But for that second one, maybe not.

121
00:08:56,200 --> 00:09:20,880
Mizzy was, for a short time, very happy with his newfound internet stardom.

122
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,620
But it very quickly crumbled away.

123
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:26,560
In May of 2022, when he first started doing this sort of content, he was slapped with

124
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:30,180
a community protection notice, prohibiting him from trespassing on private property.

125
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:35,340
As a result of these new clips going viral, on May 15th, 2023, he was fined for violating

126
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:38,620
that notice and given a two-year criminal behaviour order.

127
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:43,560
A CBO in the UK legal system is basically a fast track for legal action if violated

128
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:46,980
since you've already proven yourself to be capable of committing a similar type of crime

129
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:48,320
that the order prohibits.

130
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:53,020
On the same day as the fine, Mizzy went on to Piers Morgan to talk about the situation.

131
00:09:53,020 --> 00:10:15,760
As expected, Mizzy tried to make the conversation about race.

132
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:19,740
Race is also what the mainstream media and leftoids online focused on, because the progs

133
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:21,960
are actually ridiculous when it comes to this shit.

134
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:25,480
They believe that if you object to a black person infringing on your rights, you're

135
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:26,480
a racist.

136
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,200
But Piers Morgan didn't say anything wrong in this interview.

137
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:30,640
Everybody is at least partially a part of their upbringing.

138
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:34,720
A white Mizzy acting exactly the same way probably also had shit parents.

139
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:38,240
Though to be honest, considering that the articles talking about Mizzy's legal troubles

140
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:42,560
all reference him having to move back in with his mother in Hackney, not his family, and

141
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:46,280
referencing no father at all, it's likely that either his parents are split up, or his

142
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:47,960
dad just isn't in the picture.

143
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:50,240
Which wouldn't be too surprising given his behavior.

144
00:10:50,240 --> 00:11:10,560
However, in my opinion, the more telling bit of the interview was this clip.

145
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:49,800
Mizzy's actually completely correct here.

146
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,520
The UK's laws are weak.

147
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:52,520
Look at his body language.

148
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:56,960
He just got fined that very same day and he shrugs it off, because he knows the tolerance

149
00:11:56,960 --> 00:12:00,280
of the society that he lives in will allow him to get away with nonsense.

150
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:05,340
But after a year of online tomfoolery, he finally did push things to the breaking point.

151
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:09,680
In the two-day space between the Piers Morgan interview and Mizzy's arrest, he uploaded

152
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:13,440
two more videos to TikTok, a blatant violation of the CBO.

153
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:16,940
Mizzy's YouTube and TikTok channels have been deleted at this point, so it's hard

154
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:21,360
to know which videos were uploaded, but most people online claim that at least one of them

155
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:25,760
was this clip, where the prank in question was Mizzy barging into the conductor's room

156
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:54,960
of a subway train.

157
00:12:54,960 --> 00:13:00,020
It was this violation of the CBO that led to his arrest on May 26, 2023.

158
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:05,080
He appeared in court the next day to plead not guilty and was granted bail on the 30th

159
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:07,760
on the condition that he move back in with his mother in Hackney.

160
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:10,440
His trial date is set for July 19th.

161
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:14,720
Mizzy finally might be coming around to an understanding that he's stuck in a legal

162
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:19,400
quagmire, that he actually is going to face some repercussions for his actions, because

163
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:23,800
the official Mizzy Twitter account has been going around asking people to remove old Mizzy

164
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:28,280
clips and telling people that Mizzy is in fact still under arrest and that these clips

165
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:31,960
are old, not new videos of Mizzy terrorizing more people.

166
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:36,600
So until that July 19th trial, this seems like the end of Mizzy's story.

167
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:40,120
He went viral very quickly for doing some pretty objectionable stuff, and despite his

168
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:43,720
protest that British society was weak for allowing him to fuck around much as he did,

169
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:45,660
he is finally beginning to find out.

170
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:47,240
But there's a wider issue here.

171
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:51,260
The pranks that Mizzy pulled depended on a specific understanding of racial dynamics

172
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:52,380
in the UK.

173
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:56,680
The middle-class white Briton who reads news stories about black inner-city youth who look

174
00:13:56,680 --> 00:14:01,500
and talk and carry themselves in a specific way, constantly stabbing each other and macheting

175
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:02,500
each other.

176
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:05,660
And then the white Briton finds one of those inner-city youth approaching them with their

177
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:08,500
hands in their pockets saying, do you want to die?

178
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:09,500
That's the prank.

179
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:10,500
That's the source of the fear.

180
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:14,980
And it has the added layer of, if you react in any way other than complete submission

181
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:19,060
to this ritual of humiliation, you're branded as a racist by the progressives.

182
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:20,060
Here's the thing though.

183
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:21,060
Isn't that like this?

184
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:23,460
Mizzy's kind of a side character in his own story.

185
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:26,780
He's exploiting a pre-existing racial dynamic, but he didn't create it.

186
00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:28,540
He's not actually stabbing anybody.

187
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:31,440
He didn't create the culture of knife crime among London immigrants.

188
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:34,960
He didn't create the culture of political correctness that indigenous Britons find themselves

189
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:35,960
living under.

190
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:38,540
And in his defense, he knows what that culture is.

191
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:40,180
He's been living in it his whole life.

192
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:42,980
He knows there's far worse than him out there, and he's seen it himself.

193
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:43,980
We're just youth from the end, yeah?

194
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:44,980
Trying to make it fucking out.

195
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:45,980
You get me?

196
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:46,980
We're trying to make it out, bro.

197
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:47,980
Like, cool.

198
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:49,300
The intention of that video was for it to get some traction and some viewers, but it

199
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:52,020
was never to cause threat or intend any mental harm on anyone, bro.

200
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:53,020
Like, do you get me?

201
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:54,020
It just blew out of proportion.

202
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:55,020
Like, more than possible.

203
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:56,020
No one is trying to threaten anyone.

204
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:57,020
I know this guy personally, and he has no malicious intent.

205
00:14:57,020 --> 00:14:58,020
Like, you're forgetting.

206
00:14:58,020 --> 00:14:59,020
Yes, yes, yes.

207
00:14:59,020 --> 00:15:00,020
He does have a son, bro.

208
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:01,020
We're all trying to make it out, bro.

209
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:02,020
That's what you say.

210
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:03,020
We're in the end.

211
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:04,020
Cool.

212
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:05,020
What are we trying to do about it?

213
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:06,020
We're not out here stabbing people up, bro.

214
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:07,020
We're making fucking videos.

215
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:08,020
Some videos may not be the right approach to some things, but look, I ain't at work.

216
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:09,020
I could have went to the house on a matine.

217
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:10,020
I've seen people record themselves going to houses.

218
00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:13,220
They've degraded so much, at least in the neighborhoods of London that they're talking

219
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:17,380
about getting out of, that what Mizzie does is actually considered tame.

220
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:22,280
And that's a problem because the rest of the world views those tame pranks as gross violations.

221
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:25,700
Because by the standards of a place that isn't a fucking shithole, they actually are gross

222
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:26,700
violations.

223
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:29,700
Remember, pranks were once whoopee cushions and fake spiders.

224
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:33,260
Not putting your hands in your pockets and asking people if they want to get fucking

225
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:34,260
shanked.

226
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:37,460
In other words, while Mizzie himself is annoying and certainly deserving of all the punishment

227
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:40,260
coming his way, he's also the symptom of a larger problem.

228
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:44,580
And unlike his contemporaries who actually do turn to crime, he's using one of the few

229
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:48,700
non-violent methods at his disposal to try and get out of there, going viral and making

230
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:49,700
some money.

231
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:52,180
I can sympathize with him, even though I think he's a shithead.

232
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:54,540
Anyway, that's the story of Mizzie.

233
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:58,660
I almost did that first viral video on TikTok Tuesdays, but something in the back of my

234
00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:00,300
mind said, hold off.

235
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:01,340
There's more to this.

236
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:04,700
It's worth more than just a throwaway video, and I'm glad I did.

237
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:06,940
Mizzie is responsible for the minor crimes he's committed.

238
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:10,740
Probably some harassment in there, probably some trespass, but he's ultimately a response

239
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:14,060
to the degenerating inner-city youth culture that he finds himself in.

240
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:18,220
He didn't create this culture, and the people who did care nothing for those who have to

241
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:23,180
endure it beyond simply checking off a diversity box on some government official's spreadsheet.
