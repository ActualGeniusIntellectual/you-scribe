00:00.000 --> 00:12.280
Let's leave behind the situation in America for a while and talk about Mizzie.

00:12.280 --> 00:16.600
I mentioned in my video about the idiot celebrity who crashed a plane for YouTube views and

00:16.600 --> 00:20.120
Ridge Wallet money that edgy old YouTube was actually really fun.

00:20.120 --> 00:25.040
However, it incentivized people to do ever more extreme stunts in order to chase virality.

00:25.040 --> 00:27.700
By the way, that video got age restricted for some reason.

00:27.700 --> 00:28.700
No idea why.

00:28.700 --> 00:29.700
Thanks YouTube.

00:29.700 --> 00:32.840
Another area of that side of content creation was prank YouTube.

00:32.840 --> 00:36.020
Prank YouTube came about when people wanted to create shocking content but didn't want

00:36.020 --> 00:37.620
to break their backs doing it.

00:37.620 --> 00:41.280
The most famous prank channel from back in the day, as far as I can recall, was Prank

00:41.280 --> 00:44.880
vs Prank, where a couple routinely set up hidden cameras around their house and prank

00:44.880 --> 00:45.880
each other.

00:45.880 --> 00:49.700
Their videos were actually pretty entertaining, but ultimately corrosive to their relationship,

00:49.700 --> 00:54.100
as they ended up breaking up in 2016 over what seems to be a consistent inability to

00:54.100 --> 00:55.100
trust each other.

00:55.100 --> 00:59.560
Unlike extreme stunt content, prank content has survived up until the present day, with

00:59.560 --> 01:01.280
zoomers getting in on the mix.

01:01.280 --> 01:02.280
Seems obvious to me.

01:02.280 --> 01:05.940
Boys from my dad's generation might have put a whoopee cushion underneath a teacher's

01:05.940 --> 01:08.120
chair, or put a fake spider on their desk.

01:08.120 --> 01:12.100
While during the height of pranking online, people were using the exact same fake spiders

01:12.100 --> 01:14.300
and stuff, but uploading the reactions to Vine.

01:14.300 --> 01:18.000
There's something cross-generational about kids fucking around and having a laugh.

01:18.000 --> 01:20.380
But that doesn't mean it hasn't been a bumpy ride.

01:20.380 --> 01:24.380
Prank channels hit a rapid decline on YouTube after 2016, not because of the prank vs prank

01:24.380 --> 01:25.380
split.

01:25.380 --> 01:26.380
That was just coincidental.

01:26.380 --> 01:31.500
At some point, people began faking the pranks in order to chase a greater and greater audience

01:31.500 --> 01:32.500
payoff.

01:32.500 --> 01:35.820
Sometimes, you can still come across prank channels on TikTok, and they are horribly

01:35.820 --> 01:36.820
manufactured.

01:36.820 --> 01:37.820
Like, look at this.

01:37.820 --> 01:41.740
These people are clearly living in LA at a content house, and this entire thing is just

01:41.740 --> 01:42.740
scripted.

01:42.740 --> 01:43.740
It's all fake.

01:43.740 --> 01:46.380
You can tell by looking at their body language they're putting on a show.

01:46.380 --> 01:50.260
Ironically, the most interesting prank videos in the post-fake period are the ones where

01:50.260 --> 01:54.460
something actually unexpected happens, outside of the bounds of the fake prank.

01:54.460 --> 01:58.140
Like a bystander kicking the shit out of a prankster, thinking that it's not fake.

01:58.140 --> 01:59.740
Which leads us to Mizzy.

01:59.740 --> 02:04.160
Mizzy is 18 years old, born in 2004, though he's been making content for at least a

02:04.160 --> 02:09.420
year so far, doing some rather ridiculous, and yes, very real pranks.

02:09.420 --> 02:13.080
He's a UK citizen, born in London, and yes, he's black.

02:13.080 --> 02:16.460
People have made a lot of noise about him being black, and while some of that is just

02:16.460 --> 02:19.940
racism, there is something else going on here that must be discussed.

02:19.940 --> 02:23.460
Mizzy was thrust into the spotlight a couple of weeks ago with this viral clip.

02:49.940 --> 03:08.780
Yes, this was the prank.

03:08.780 --> 03:12.820
Walking into random people's houses, and just sitting down and watching them react.

03:12.820 --> 03:16.540
Man, if you did this in America, you'd be turned into Swiss cheese real quick.

03:16.540 --> 03:19.660
The issue here is that this misses the ultimate point of a prank.

03:19.660 --> 03:22.660
When you prank somebody, yes, you do catch them by surprise.

03:22.660 --> 03:26.060
But by the end of the ordeal, there's an understanding that there was never any real

03:26.060 --> 03:27.060
danger.

03:27.060 --> 03:28.060
Everyone was cool.

03:28.060 --> 03:29.060
Everyone gets a chuckle out of it.

03:29.060 --> 03:31.740
That logic makes sense if we're talking about a fake spider dropping into somebody's

03:31.740 --> 03:34.520
shoulder, or if you startle somebody when they turn the corner, but it suddenly feels

03:34.520 --> 03:38.400
quite a bit different when you're walking into somebody's private house.

03:38.400 --> 03:41.780
After this video went viral, people began to check out Mizzy's channels, and discovered

03:41.780 --> 03:45.740
that a lot of the pranks he was pulling on random strangers just went too far, at least

03:45.740 --> 03:46.820
for most people.

03:46.820 --> 03:50.480
Another notable example is the one where he walked up to a woman, and just grabbed her

03:50.480 --> 04:15.940
dog and ran away.

04:15.940 --> 04:19.620
It reminds me quite a bit of the guy in the previous video who threatened to do just that

04:19.620 --> 04:22.980
to the woman in Central Park, and she reacted appropriately, nobody wants their beloved

04:22.980 --> 04:23.980
pet stolen.

04:23.980 --> 04:27.220
And then there was that time he walked into a library, and just began ripping pages out

04:27.220 --> 04:28.220
of books.

04:58.220 --> 05:14.220
Tic-tock video ripping books, no?

05:14.220 --> 05:18.020
Excuse me, what's going on, guys?

05:18.020 --> 05:19.020
This is not, this is not...

05:19.020 --> 05:20.020
Is that your book from home?

05:20.020 --> 05:21.020
No, it's not.

05:21.020 --> 05:22.020
Is it from the library?

05:22.020 --> 05:23.020
Yeah.

05:23.020 --> 05:24.020
Then that, you cannot do that, guys.

05:24.020 --> 05:25.020
Why can't I do that?

05:25.020 --> 05:26.020
Because it's a library.

05:26.820 --> 05:29.460
The library, if I can get books from the library, why can't I rip the pages out of the books

05:29.460 --> 05:30.460
as well?

05:30.460 --> 05:31.460
Because then other people can't use them.

05:31.460 --> 05:33.460
So who gives a fuck about other people?

05:33.460 --> 05:35.460
Let me get this, sorry.

05:35.460 --> 05:38.060
Can you get Adam, please?

05:38.060 --> 05:42.100
This one could count as an acceptable prank if he paid for the books he destroyed, but

05:42.100 --> 05:45.620
Mizzy's stuff generally moves beyond harmless pranking.

05:45.620 --> 05:50.720
Yeah, he's certainly surprising people, but he's doing so by legitimately being a nuisance.

05:50.720 --> 05:54.380
After the initial shock has worn off, it's not replaced with relief and understanding,

05:54.380 --> 05:56.020
it's replaced with annoyance.

05:56.020 --> 05:58.420
And here's where we have to have the race conversation.

05:58.420 --> 05:59.420
Watch this clip.

06:24.380 --> 06:45.100
Yeah, the yelling's annoying, but listen to what he says afterward.

06:45.100 --> 06:47.100
And this isn't the only time he's done this.

06:47.100 --> 07:06.700
Here's the explanation of this prank.

07:06.700 --> 07:10.940
Mizzy knows that among the white middle class of the UK, there is a stereotype about young

07:10.940 --> 07:15.300
black inner city boys who dress like him, talk in his accent, and carry themselves in

07:15.300 --> 07:17.860
the way that he's deliberately doing in these videos.

07:17.860 --> 07:22.180
The stereotype is that they are violent immigrants who don't care about British law or cultural

07:22.180 --> 07:23.180
norms.

07:23.180 --> 07:27.020
At first glance, Mizzy doesn't seem to be that kind of guy, but he knows of the stereotype,

07:27.020 --> 07:46.940
and he's using it to make people scared to just be around him.

07:46.940 --> 08:15.060
This

08:15.060 --> 08:18.180
is not the flashpoint fear that you feel during a shock.

08:18.180 --> 08:21.180
This is inducing genuine, lasting terror.

08:21.180 --> 08:22.940
Like I said, if this were America, this wouldn't be tolerated.

08:22.940 --> 08:25.100
Hell, forget about the states and their guns.

08:25.100 --> 08:28.420
Most men who are watching this right now, you're probably thinking back to how you were

08:28.420 --> 08:30.940
in your teenage years, where you would have just got up and punched the guy.

08:30.940 --> 08:32.420
That's a pretty normal sentiment.

08:32.420 --> 08:34.940
You don't have to be good at fighting or anything like that, most guys aren't.

08:34.940 --> 08:39.020
But I can't think of anybody who would just let this sort of intimidation slide without

08:39.020 --> 08:40.700
trying to intimidate back.

08:40.700 --> 08:42.760
And yet, there's no retaliation in these videos.

08:42.760 --> 08:46.840
Is it because the UK is full of cucked soyboys who don't want to appear racist?

08:46.840 --> 08:47.840
Maybe.

08:47.840 --> 08:50.840
Is it because the UK's laws are set up such that the indigenous Britain would be treated

08:50.840 --> 08:53.720
harshly while the immigrant is let off with a slap on the wrist?

08:53.720 --> 08:54.720
Maybe.

08:54.720 --> 08:56.200
But for that second one, maybe not.

08:56.200 --> 09:20.880
Mizzy was, for a short time, very happy with his newfound internet stardom.

09:20.880 --> 09:22.620
But it very quickly crumbled away.

09:22.620 --> 09:26.560
In May of 2022, when he first started doing this sort of content, he was slapped with

09:26.560 --> 09:30.180
a community protection notice, prohibiting him from trespassing on private property.

09:30.180 --> 09:35.340
As a result of these new clips going viral, on May 15th, 2023, he was fined for violating

09:35.340 --> 09:38.620
that notice and given a two-year criminal behaviour order.

09:38.620 --> 09:43.560
A CBO in the UK legal system is basically a fast track for legal action if violated

09:43.560 --> 09:46.980
since you've already proven yourself to be capable of committing a similar type of crime

09:46.980 --> 09:48.320
that the order prohibits.

09:48.320 --> 09:53.020
On the same day as the fine, Mizzy went on to Piers Morgan to talk about the situation.

09:53.020 --> 10:15.760
As expected, Mizzy tried to make the conversation about race.

10:15.760 --> 10:19.740
Race is also what the mainstream media and leftoids online focused on, because the progs

10:19.740 --> 10:21.960
are actually ridiculous when it comes to this shit.

10:21.960 --> 10:25.480
They believe that if you object to a black person infringing on your rights, you're

10:25.480 --> 10:26.480
a racist.

10:26.480 --> 10:28.200
But Piers Morgan didn't say anything wrong in this interview.

10:28.200 --> 10:30.640
Everybody is at least partially a part of their upbringing.

10:30.640 --> 10:34.720
A white Mizzy acting exactly the same way probably also had shit parents.

10:34.720 --> 10:38.240
Though to be honest, considering that the articles talking about Mizzy's legal troubles

10:38.240 --> 10:42.560
all reference him having to move back in with his mother in Hackney, not his family, and

10:42.560 --> 10:46.280
referencing no father at all, it's likely that either his parents are split up, or his

10:46.280 --> 10:47.960
dad just isn't in the picture.

10:47.960 --> 10:50.240
Which wouldn't be too surprising given his behavior.

10:50.240 --> 11:10.560
However, in my opinion, the more telling bit of the interview was this clip.

11:40.560 --> 11:49.800
Mizzy's actually completely correct here.

11:49.800 --> 11:51.520
The UK's laws are weak.

11:51.520 --> 11:52.520
Look at his body language.

11:52.520 --> 11:56.960
He just got fined that very same day and he shrugs it off, because he knows the tolerance

11:56.960 --> 12:00.280
of the society that he lives in will allow him to get away with nonsense.

12:00.280 --> 12:05.340
But after a year of online tomfoolery, he finally did push things to the breaking point.

12:05.340 --> 12:09.680
In the two-day space between the Piers Morgan interview and Mizzy's arrest, he uploaded

12:09.680 --> 12:13.440
two more videos to TikTok, a blatant violation of the CBO.

12:13.440 --> 12:16.940
Mizzy's YouTube and TikTok channels have been deleted at this point, so it's hard

12:16.940 --> 12:21.360
to know which videos were uploaded, but most people online claim that at least one of them

12:21.360 --> 12:25.760
was this clip, where the prank in question was Mizzy barging into the conductor's room

12:25.760 --> 12:54.960
of a subway train.

12:54.960 --> 13:00.020
It was this violation of the CBO that led to his arrest on May 26, 2023.

13:00.020 --> 13:05.080
He appeared in court the next day to plead not guilty and was granted bail on the 30th

13:05.080 --> 13:07.760
on the condition that he move back in with his mother in Hackney.

13:07.760 --> 13:10.440
His trial date is set for July 19th.

13:10.440 --> 13:14.720
Mizzy finally might be coming around to an understanding that he's stuck in a legal

13:14.720 --> 13:19.400
quagmire, that he actually is going to face some repercussions for his actions, because

13:19.400 --> 13:23.800
the official Mizzy Twitter account has been going around asking people to remove old Mizzy

13:23.800 --> 13:28.280
clips and telling people that Mizzy is in fact still under arrest and that these clips

13:28.280 --> 13:31.960
are old, not new videos of Mizzy terrorizing more people.

13:31.960 --> 13:36.600
So until that July 19th trial, this seems like the end of Mizzy's story.

13:36.600 --> 13:40.120
He went viral very quickly for doing some pretty objectionable stuff, and despite his

13:40.120 --> 13:43.720
protest that British society was weak for allowing him to fuck around much as he did,

13:43.720 --> 13:45.660
he is finally beginning to find out.

13:45.660 --> 13:47.240
But there's a wider issue here.

13:47.240 --> 13:51.260
The pranks that Mizzy pulled depended on a specific understanding of racial dynamics

13:51.260 --> 13:52.380
in the UK.

13:52.380 --> 13:56.680
The middle-class white Briton who reads news stories about black inner-city youth who look

13:56.680 --> 14:01.500
and talk and carry themselves in a specific way, constantly stabbing each other and macheting

14:01.500 --> 14:02.500
each other.

14:02.500 --> 14:05.660
And then the white Briton finds one of those inner-city youth approaching them with their

14:05.660 --> 14:08.500
hands in their pockets saying, do you want to die?

14:08.500 --> 14:09.500
That's the prank.

14:09.500 --> 14:10.500
That's the source of the fear.

14:10.500 --> 14:14.980
And it has the added layer of, if you react in any way other than complete submission

14:14.980 --> 14:19.060
to this ritual of humiliation, you're branded as a racist by the progressives.

14:19.060 --> 14:20.060
Here's the thing though.

14:20.060 --> 14:21.060
Isn't that like this?

14:21.060 --> 14:23.460
Mizzy's kind of a side character in his own story.

14:23.460 --> 14:26.780
He's exploiting a pre-existing racial dynamic, but he didn't create it.

14:26.780 --> 14:28.540
He's not actually stabbing anybody.

14:28.540 --> 14:31.440
He didn't create the culture of knife crime among London immigrants.

14:31.440 --> 14:34.960
He didn't create the culture of political correctness that indigenous Britons find themselves

14:34.960 --> 14:35.960
living under.

14:35.960 --> 14:38.540
And in his defense, he knows what that culture is.

14:38.540 --> 14:40.180
He's been living in it his whole life.

14:40.180 --> 14:42.980
He knows there's far worse than him out there, and he's seen it himself.

14:42.980 --> 14:43.980
We're just youth from the end, yeah?

14:43.980 --> 14:44.980
Trying to make it fucking out.

14:44.980 --> 14:45.980
You get me?

14:45.980 --> 14:46.980
We're trying to make it out, bro.

14:46.980 --> 14:47.980
Like, cool.

14:47.980 --> 14:49.300
The intention of that video was for it to get some traction and some viewers, but it

14:49.300 --> 14:52.020
was never to cause threat or intend any mental harm on anyone, bro.

14:52.020 --> 14:53.020
Like, do you get me?

14:53.020 --> 14:54.020
It just blew out of proportion.

14:54.020 --> 14:55.020
Like, more than possible.

14:55.020 --> 14:56.020
No one is trying to threaten anyone.

14:56.020 --> 14:57.020
I know this guy personally, and he has no malicious intent.

14:57.020 --> 14:58.020
Like, you're forgetting.

14:58.020 --> 14:59.020
Yes, yes, yes.

14:59.020 --> 15:00.020
He does have a son, bro.

15:00.020 --> 15:01.020
We're all trying to make it out, bro.

15:01.020 --> 15:02.020
That's what you say.

15:02.020 --> 15:03.020
We're in the end.

15:03.020 --> 15:04.020
Cool.

15:04.020 --> 15:05.020
What are we trying to do about it?

15:05.020 --> 15:06.020
We're not out here stabbing people up, bro.

15:06.020 --> 15:07.020
We're making fucking videos.

15:07.020 --> 15:08.020
Some videos may not be the right approach to some things, but look, I ain't at work.

15:08.020 --> 15:09.020
I could have went to the house on a matine.

15:09.020 --> 15:10.020
I've seen people record themselves going to houses.

15:10.020 --> 15:13.220
They've degraded so much, at least in the neighborhoods of London that they're talking

15:13.220 --> 15:17.380
about getting out of, that what Mizzie does is actually considered tame.

15:17.380 --> 15:22.280
And that's a problem because the rest of the world views those tame pranks as gross violations.

15:22.280 --> 15:25.700
Because by the standards of a place that isn't a fucking shithole, they actually are gross

15:25.700 --> 15:26.700
violations.

15:26.700 --> 15:29.700
Remember, pranks were once whoopee cushions and fake spiders.

15:29.700 --> 15:33.260
Not putting your hands in your pockets and asking people if they want to get fucking

15:33.260 --> 15:34.260
shanked.

15:34.260 --> 15:37.460
In other words, while Mizzie himself is annoying and certainly deserving of all the punishment

15:37.460 --> 15:40.260
coming his way, he's also the symptom of a larger problem.

15:40.260 --> 15:44.580
And unlike his contemporaries who actually do turn to crime, he's using one of the few

15:44.580 --> 15:48.700
non-violent methods at his disposal to try and get out of there, going viral and making

15:48.700 --> 15:49.700
some money.

15:49.700 --> 15:52.180
I can sympathize with him, even though I think he's a shithead.

15:52.180 --> 15:54.540
Anyway, that's the story of Mizzie.

15:54.540 --> 15:58.660
I almost did that first viral video on TikTok Tuesdays, but something in the back of my

15:58.660 --> 16:00.300
mind said, hold off.

16:00.300 --> 16:01.340
There's more to this.

16:01.340 --> 16:04.700
It's worth more than just a throwaway video, and I'm glad I did.

16:04.700 --> 16:06.940
Mizzie is responsible for the minor crimes he's committed.

16:06.940 --> 16:10.740
Probably some harassment in there, probably some trespass, but he's ultimately a response

16:10.740 --> 16:14.060
to the degenerating inner-city youth culture that he finds himself in.

16:14.060 --> 16:18.220
He didn't create this culture, and the people who did care nothing for those who have to

16:18.220 --> 16:23.180
endure it beyond simply checking off a diversity box on some government official's spreadsheet.
