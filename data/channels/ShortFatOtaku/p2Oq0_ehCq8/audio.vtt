00:00.000 --> 00:05.520
Buzzfeed

00:05.520 --> 00:10.080
Everybody knows Buzzfeed as a garbage website that publishes garbage articles,

00:10.080 --> 00:14.560
full of woke nonsense and progressive apologia. But did you know that Buzzfeed actually began

00:14.560 --> 00:17.840
as something completely different? This is the founder of Buzzfeed,

00:17.840 --> 00:23.120
Jonah Peretti. His first footprint, at least in terms of online stuff, was back in 2001,

00:23.120 --> 00:27.840
when his email exchange with Nike went viral. It was actually published on The Guardian way back

00:27.840 --> 00:32.640
then. Nike was offering a custom shoe printing service, where you can ask them to print whatever

00:32.640 --> 00:37.200
word you like on a pair of shoes. Peretti asked for a pair of Nike shoes with the word

00:37.200 --> 00:41.920
Sweatshop embroidered on them, which Nike refused to do. Nike emailed him, stating that the custom

00:41.920 --> 00:46.960
text was cancelled because it 1. Contained intellectual property, 2. Contained the name

00:46.960 --> 00:52.000
of an athlete or team that Nike didn't have a contract with, 3. It was left blank, or 4. It

00:52.000 --> 00:56.640
contained inappropriate slang of profanity. Nike didn't say which rule had been violated,

00:56.640 --> 01:00.640
so Peretti replied by saying that Sweatshop isn't trademark, it's not the name of an athlete,

01:00.640 --> 01:04.960
it's not blank, and it's not profanity, and that he wanted to remember the toil and labor of the

01:04.960 --> 01:10.080
children that made his shoes. Nike responded, stating that Sweatshop was indeed inappropriate

01:10.080 --> 01:14.560
slang. Peretti replied by citing Webster's Dictionary, where it's written that Sweatshop

01:14.560 --> 01:18.560
isn't slang but is actually a normal word. Nike finally pulled the obvious trump card,

01:18.560 --> 01:21.760
that they can actually just decline service for any reason they want.

01:21.760 --> 01:25.760
Peretti then requested that instead of the embroidery, Nike send him a picture of the

01:25.760 --> 01:30.640
10-year-old Vietnamese girl making his shoes. That was a wild ride, and I can appreciate a

01:30.640 --> 01:33.840
good troll, but Peretti's politics are pretty clear from this exchange.

01:33.840 --> 01:37.840
Back in 2001, when this happened, he would have been in his mid-twenties, and he likely

01:37.840 --> 01:42.400
viewed himself as some flavor of revolutionary. He graduated from the University of California

01:42.400 --> 01:46.960
in Santa Cruz in 1996, with a degree in environmental studies, with his most

01:46.960 --> 01:51.760
notable academic work being the article Capitalism and Schizophrenia, published in a journal of

01:51.760 --> 01:57.840
critical theory called Negations. Peretti's 1996 paper sets the stage for the rest of his career.

01:57.840 --> 02:02.960
Here's how it begins. Every major corporation in the world has a web site offering product

02:02.960 --> 02:08.320
information, interactive advertisements, and, increasingly, the ability to buy products online.

02:08.320 --> 02:14.880
Discount books from Amazon.com, pizza delivery from Pizzanet.net, stocks from Schwab.com,

02:14.880 --> 02:18.400
and just about anything else you can imagine, like the virtual mall,

02:18.480 --> 02:22.320
VirtuMall.com, are available for purchase in cyberspace.

02:22.320 --> 02:25.200
Wow, this paper really was written in 1996.

02:25.200 --> 02:30.000
My central contention is that late capitalism not only accelerates the flow of capital,

02:30.000 --> 02:34.960
but also accelerates the rate at which subjects assume identities. Identity formation is

02:34.960 --> 02:39.440
inextricably linked to the urge to consume, and therefore the acceleration of capitalism

02:39.440 --> 02:43.840
necessitates an increase in the rate at which individuals assume and shed identities.

02:43.840 --> 02:48.320
The internet is one of many late capitalist phenomenon that allow for more flexible,

02:48.320 --> 02:51.280
rapid, and profitable mechanisms of identity formation.

02:51.280 --> 02:55.360
This almost sounds prophetic, doesn't it? Identity politics is a primary tool of the left,

02:55.360 --> 02:58.320
though the right has begun to pick it up as well in recent years. And despite the

02:58.320 --> 03:02.640
left's anti-capitalist stance, they have hyper-capitalized their identities.

03:02.640 --> 03:07.680
From your random leftoid consumer demanding that you watch Captain Marvel or Black Panther

03:07.680 --> 03:11.600
or Harley Quinn or else you're a bigot, to breadtubers growing ridiculously wealthy

03:11.600 --> 03:15.360
off the backs of their viewers while simultaneously agitating for a revolution,

03:15.360 --> 03:20.000
to champagne socialist coffee shop co-ops, to progressive clothing brands selling Che

03:20.000 --> 03:24.560
Guevara t-shirts and trans rights hats, all of them made in overseas sweatshops.

03:24.560 --> 03:28.880
Most of the paper is spent drawing links between capitalism and schizophrenia,

03:28.880 --> 03:33.840
as the title would suggest. The point seems to be that the postmodernist youth art of the 1990s,

03:33.840 --> 03:39.440
the erraticness of MTV programming is used as an example repeatedly, is schizophrenic in nature.

03:39.440 --> 03:43.360
It mimics the schizophrenic experience. As such, the capitalist mindset and the

03:43.360 --> 03:47.600
schizophrenic mindset are identical, mindless nonsense meant to be consumed

03:47.600 --> 03:52.480
unthinkingly with no real purpose behind it. Schizophrenia is characterized as capitalism's

03:52.480 --> 03:56.800
deepest tendency, but also that capitalism must ultimately fight back against it,

03:56.800 --> 04:00.320
as schizos cannot be consumed, unlike other capitalist elements.

04:00.320 --> 04:04.640
Schizophrenia is therefore the contradictions of capitalism finally made manifest,

04:04.640 --> 04:08.560
an image of its impending collapse. Paredes' prescription is that activists

04:08.560 --> 04:12.400
use schizophrenic strategies to accelerate consumer-based identity formation and

04:12.400 --> 04:17.280
dissolution in order to destabilize the mental health of individuals and thus weaken capitalism.

04:17.280 --> 04:21.200
There, I just packed 6,000 words of nonsense into one paragraph,

04:21.200 --> 04:23.840
and V said that I couldn't summarize things quick enough.

04:23.840 --> 04:28.400
The point is, before Jonah Peretti founded BuzzFeed, he was a Marxist, a postmodernist,

04:28.400 --> 04:32.880
and a critical theorist. When I read that paper, it seemed to me that he had a specific interest

04:32.880 --> 04:37.680
in how modern mental illness was created by, and was a mirror of, late-stage capitalism.

04:37.680 --> 04:42.400
How self-identification drives consumerism, and how the destabilization of identities,

04:42.400 --> 04:46.640
through rapid capitalist consumption, can generate mental illnesses and hasten the

04:46.640 --> 04:49.840
collapse of the current system. Keep all of this in mind for later.

04:49.840 --> 04:53.920
After Peretti's academic career slowed down, he was a co-founder of the Huffington Post

04:53.920 --> 04:58.000
back in 2005, along with Kenneth Lehrer, Arianna Huffington, the site's namesake,

04:58.000 --> 05:02.720
and surprisingly enough, Andrew Breitbart. Arianna Huffington was a conservative in a previous era

05:02.720 --> 05:07.440
of her life, and Andrew Breitbart had mentored under her. She shifted leftward during the George

05:07.440 --> 05:12.240
Bush years, and the initial idea of Huffington Post was that the two media titans, left and

05:12.240 --> 05:17.280
right-leaning, would keep the site balanced. But in actuality, Huffington Post gradually drifted

05:17.280 --> 05:21.840
leftward over time, and Breitbart moved on to found his own outlet. Peretti, for his part,

05:21.840 --> 05:26.800
did a lot of the background tech startup stuff for the Huffington Post, but he used the experience

05:26.800 --> 05:32.560
gained there to found BuzzFeed a year later in 2006. Now, for those of you who are younger,

05:32.560 --> 05:37.120
you might not know this, but BuzzFeed actually didn't begin as a news outlet.

05:37.120 --> 05:42.000
Peretti marketed it as the internet's popularity contest, and it aggregated stuff going viral at

05:42.000 --> 05:46.320
the time, almost like a primitive version of Reddit. The term viral hadn't even been coined

05:46.320 --> 05:51.280
yet, though, so they called any story that was blowing up online buzz instead. Unlike Reddit,

05:51.280 --> 05:56.480
though, BuzzFeed also produced its own comedic content and added that into the mix, similar to

05:56.480 --> 06:01.360
Cracked or College Humor. Though this era of BuzzFeed did have political commentary,

06:01.360 --> 06:04.960
it wasn't the site's main goal. Politics came up when a political story was either

06:04.960 --> 06:10.640
viral or funny, but otherwise, the site focused on short, snappy, shareable bits of content,

06:10.640 --> 06:15.680
with no real overarching theme behind it. In a sense, it was quasi-schizophrenic.

06:15.680 --> 06:20.720
BuzzFeed also brought in a now-ubiquitous innovation in website design. It seems obvious

06:20.720 --> 06:26.000
to us nowadays, but the idea of having a trending tab, aka a dedicated box on the front page,

06:26.000 --> 06:29.360
featuring the stories getting the most clicks right now, rather than a simple chronological

06:29.360 --> 06:34.240
order? Yeah, that wasn't a thing in 2006, and BuzzFeed popularized the feature. Also,

06:34.240 --> 06:39.200
their 2006 About page really reads like something out of an AI conversation from right now,

06:39.200 --> 06:42.960
explaining that their automated algorithms detect what's popular and filter it down to

06:42.960 --> 06:47.040
BuzzFeed's staff. To put this into context, this is from right around when YouTube was first

06:47.040 --> 06:51.600
launching. Nobody except maybe Microsoft was tinkering with software like this.

06:51.600 --> 06:54.320
Of course, they could also just be blowing smoke up our asses, who knows.

06:54.320 --> 06:59.920
BuzzFeed made the official jump from comedy aggregator to political news outlet in 2012,

06:59.920 --> 07:04.880
when it was the first publication, both online and print, to break the news that John McCain

07:04.880 --> 07:09.920
was going to endorse Mitt Romney in the 2012 presidential race. Breaking the story first

07:09.920 --> 07:14.480
massively raised BuzzFeed's profile and led to several rounds of investment, with the intention

07:14.480 --> 07:18.800
of turning BuzzFeed into a serious force in political news. And though Peretti would use

07:18.800 --> 07:23.360
the investment capital to massively expand BuzzFeed out, that didn't really change its

07:23.360 --> 07:27.920
reliability in the eyes of the public. A 2014 Pew Research Center survey found that

07:27.920 --> 07:32.640
while the majority of people didn't even know or care about BuzzFeed, most people who did

07:32.640 --> 07:38.240
viewed it as an inaccurate news source. In order to combat this, BuzzFeed's real journalism split

07:38.240 --> 07:43.920
off into BuzzFeedNews.com, but that didn't really help them. BuzzFeed's actual history of reporting

07:43.920 --> 07:48.480
basically shows us that there is no barrel too deep that they won't scrape the bottom of it.

07:48.480 --> 07:52.960
Following in Gawker's footsteps, BuzzFeed has no problem holding a double standard when it

07:52.960 --> 07:57.120
comes to celebrity nude photos. They published an article decrying people wanting to see the

07:57.120 --> 08:01.600
Jennifer Lawrence nudes, but they were completely okay with the babies. BuzzFeed staff have been

08:01.600 --> 08:06.400
fired for plagiarism, and not just some random intern, but senior reporters. They have no problem

08:06.400 --> 08:09.440
publishing stories without confirming the evidence that they're citing in the story.

08:09.440 --> 08:15.280
And of course, BuzzFeed published the legendary Trump Piss Dossier back in January of 2017.

08:15.280 --> 08:18.480
I don't know if you remember, it really went viral back then. The majority of the political

08:18.480 --> 08:22.240
claims in it, regardless of their veracity, were completely overshadowed by the fact that the

08:22.240 --> 08:27.840
dossier falsely claimed that Trump rented out the same hotel room that Obama stayed in in Moscow,

08:27.840 --> 08:32.960
hired prostitutes, pissed all over them in the same bed Obama slept in, and that the Russians

08:32.960 --> 08:37.200
caught it all on tape and they were blackmailing Trump with it. That was all fake, by the way.

08:37.200 --> 08:42.800
No other news outlet would touch that shit with a 10-foot pole, but BuzzFeed jumped right into the

08:42.800 --> 08:47.680
piss pit without a second thought. They even admitted, again, they had not actually verified

08:47.680 --> 08:52.160
the contents of the dossier, and other journalists were rightly angry with them for undermining

08:52.160 --> 08:55.840
the integrity of their profession, which is prophetic considering the state of journalism

08:55.840 --> 08:59.760
six years later. But nonetheless, they had a point back then. They lost those morals to Trump

08:59.760 --> 09:04.400
Derangement Syndrome eventually, but the objection to BuzzFeed's actions was rooted in the idea that

09:04.400 --> 09:09.440
journalism had to focus on accuracy rather than partisanship, which is a good objection even if

09:09.440 --> 09:13.920
they eventually abandon the principle. And then there's the financial troubles. By the end of

09:13.920 --> 09:17.920
2017, the company still wasn't profitable. And in response to investor pressure,

09:17.920 --> 09:21.840
Freddie began to close the doors of some of BuzzFeed's satellite outlets and laid off a

09:21.840 --> 09:27.440
round of employees, 100 in the States, 100 in France, and 45 in the UK. Another round of layoffs

09:27.440 --> 09:34.080
hit in 2019, this time approximately 200 people. In 2020, BuzzFeed shut down its UK on Australian

09:34.080 --> 09:39.280
divisions entirely. In March of 2022, three top editors announced that they'd be resigning and

09:39.280 --> 09:44.240
that the whole of BuzzFeed News itself would be facing widespread layoffs. And with the writing

09:44.240 --> 09:49.280
on the wall, BuzzFeed News was finally shut down on April 20th, 2023. That doesn't mean that

09:49.280 --> 09:54.080
Freddie is without a news mouthpiece, though. The failed upward success of BuzzFeed allowed him to

09:54.080 --> 09:58.400
eventually purchase the Huffington Post, his old stomping grounds, and his plan seems to be to

09:58.400 --> 10:04.480
focus on making news content over there and leave BuzzFeed for trash, I guess. In an email to his

10:04.480 --> 10:09.440
staff, Freddie said, I made the decision to overinvest in BuzzFeed News because I love their

10:09.440 --> 10:14.160
work and their mission so much. This made me slow to accept that the big platforms wouldn't provide

10:14.160 --> 10:18.640
the distribution or the financial support required to support premium, free journalism

10:18.640 --> 10:23.200
purpose-built for social media. To be fair, BuzzFeed has published some good work. They

10:23.200 --> 10:27.840
won a Pulitzer for their expose on the Uyghur genocide in China, but they've also done a lot

10:27.840 --> 10:32.560
of garbage. They've done mostly garbage, in fact. Amidst all of this, a failing company,

10:32.560 --> 10:37.440
no profitability for years, would it surprise you to learn that BuzzFeed also had strikes?

10:37.440 --> 10:42.000
Yes, despite BuzzFeed being run by an ideological Marxist, there were still labor disputes. Who

10:42.000 --> 10:46.000
would've thought? Now, I've spoken about unions before on this channel. I'm not opposed to the

10:46.000 --> 10:50.320
idea of unions in principle. I just don't think that they're good for every single type of job.

10:50.320 --> 10:54.880
I've personally seen examples of very good unions that have protected workers who are being bullied

10:54.880 --> 10:59.840
by particularly sadistic managers. I've also personally seen examples of bad unions where

10:59.840 --> 11:05.280
the worst employees were simply allowed to fail upward due to their seniority. A union is not a

11:05.280 --> 11:10.000
guarantee that things in the workplace will be better. A union is simply what it says on the tin.

11:10.000 --> 11:14.320
Collective bargaining. In a job where your skills are in high demand, where you're raking in the

11:14.320 --> 11:18.160
money and other companies are actually headhunting you and giving you better offers, you don't need

11:18.160 --> 11:23.120
a union. In that case, the worker actually has the power, despite how Marxists might cry about

11:23.120 --> 11:28.080
how that can never be true, because their labor is specialized and rare. They can actually negotiate

11:28.080 --> 11:32.960
on their own for a good contract. In other words, individual bargaining. Low-skill workers whose

11:32.960 --> 11:37.440
labor isn't individually very valuable, they don't have those perks, which is the main argument for

11:37.440 --> 11:42.080
collective bargaining. However, history has also shown us that collective bargaining in the face

11:42.080 --> 11:46.960
of a collapsing market does nothing. It's one thing when the industry is booming and the owners

11:46.960 --> 11:51.360
of businesses are rat-fucking their employees. Unions can do some good work there to get the

11:51.360 --> 11:54.720
standards of living up for their workers, but in an industry that is shrinking, where there is

11:54.720 --> 11:59.200
actually little money to be made, the demands of unionization tend to hasten the company's demise,

11:59.200 --> 12:03.600
rather than actually help any workers out. To put it simply, you just can't squeeze any more blood

12:03.600 --> 12:07.520
out of that stone, and that's the situation that BuzzFeed has consistently found itself in.

12:07.520 --> 12:12.080
From 2017 onward, while Peretti was downsizing his company again and again in an attempt to

12:12.080 --> 12:16.560
keep his head above water, he was also facing demands from his workforce to unionize. These

12:16.560 --> 12:21.920
efforts finally came to a head in February of 2019, where the employees of BuzzFeed News voted

12:21.920 --> 12:26.000
to unionize. At the time, the editor-in-chief stated, we look forward to meeting with the

12:26.000 --> 12:30.400
organizers to discuss a way towards voluntarily recognizing the union. But when it came time to

12:30.400 --> 12:34.720
actually sit down and work it out in April, the executives failed to show up for the meeting.

12:34.720 --> 12:39.040
The BuzzFeed News union on Twitter put them on blast with a viral tweet and staged a walkout

12:39.040 --> 12:43.920
in response. But by 2021, they still hadn't hammered out an agreement. Another viral tweet,

12:43.920 --> 12:49.040
another walkout. And when all the layoffs came in 2023, the BuzzFeed News union Twitter account

12:49.040 --> 12:54.000
was crying about how unfair it all was, and shilling a GoFundMe for the former employees.

12:54.000 --> 12:58.160
The union, for all of its news coverage, for all of its agitation, for all of its walkouts and

12:58.160 --> 13:02.880
threats of strikes, and viral tweets, only ever managed to get BuzzFeed to come to a tentative

13:02.880 --> 13:08.400
agreement in March of 2022. Various unionistas were hailing this as a huge win at the time,

13:08.400 --> 13:12.400
but considering that the fucking business died a year later, it didn't really matter.

13:12.400 --> 13:16.240
Now, I don't think that unionization killed BuzzFeed. Far from it. But do you think that

13:16.240 --> 13:21.280
spending even more on labor while already not being profitable would have helped their situation?

13:21.280 --> 13:26.160
Obviously not. Peretti himself was ultimately opposed to the idea of unionization,

13:26.160 --> 13:30.560
despite what his politics might make you believe. Back in 2015, he was asked about unionization and

13:30.560 --> 13:35.280
gave a pretty long, in-depth reply. I think unions have had a positive impact on a lot of places,

13:35.280 --> 13:38.400
like if you're working on an assembly line, and if you're negotiating with management,

13:38.400 --> 13:42.400
it can make a huge difference, particularly when labor is more replaceable. I don't think a union

13:42.400 --> 13:46.640
is right for BuzzFeed for two reasons. One, I think the way we pattern BuzzFeed is after

13:46.640 --> 13:50.800
companies like Google and Facebook, and the tech startups are very competitive for talent. They're

13:50.800 --> 13:55.280
all trying to get the best talent. That's how I see BuzzFeed as well. We need to provide amazing

13:55.280 --> 14:00.080
benefits. We need to provide as much incentive for people to pick BuzzFeed over any other company.

14:00.080 --> 14:04.160
A lot of the best new-economy companies are environments where there's an alliance between

14:04.160 --> 14:09.040
managers and employees. People have shared goals. Benefits and perks and compensation are very

14:09.040 --> 14:12.560
competitive, and I feel like that's the kind of market we're in. A lot of times, when you look

14:12.560 --> 14:16.880
at companies that have unionized, the relationship is much more adversarial. I think that actually

14:16.880 --> 14:21.200
wouldn't be very good for employees at BuzzFeed, particularly people who are writers and reporters,

14:21.200 --> 14:24.800
because the comps for writers and reporters are much less favorable than the comps for

14:24.800 --> 14:28.880
startup companies and tech companies. In general, I don't think it's the right idea for us.

14:28.880 --> 14:32.400
The other thing about BuzzFeed is that we're global. Most unions are national.

14:32.400 --> 14:36.560
We have people who move between different roles, and in general, unions do a lot of defining clearly

14:36.560 --> 14:41.120
what individual roles are and what a job function is. So for a flexible, dynamic company, it isn't

14:41.120 --> 14:44.880
something I think would be great. There's a lot of good points in here, like how BuzzFeed is already

14:44.880 --> 14:48.960
incentivized to keep talent around through better offers due to the competitiveness of their market,

14:48.960 --> 14:52.640
which isn't the case in blue-collar work. But I think the most interesting point is when he

14:52.640 --> 14:56.960
mentioned that he views BuzzFeed as having an alliance between managers and employees,

14:56.960 --> 15:00.160
where other industries have more adversarial relationships.

15:00.160 --> 15:04.320
Now, Peretti is a Marxist. We established that at the beginning of the video. He should know that,

15:04.320 --> 15:09.440
in Marxian terms, the managers and employees, the bourgeois and the proletariat, are inherently in

15:09.440 --> 15:13.680
an adversarial relationship due to their differing connection to the means of production. The

15:13.680 --> 15:18.240
bourgeois own the means of production and seek to extract surplus value from the proletariat.

15:18.240 --> 15:22.960
The proletariat work the means of production, and they must sell their labor in order to survive.

15:22.960 --> 15:28.480
Socialists view this relationship as inherently exploitative. It cannot not be adversarial in

15:28.480 --> 15:32.400
their book. It's impossible for them to have aligned goals in their view.

15:32.400 --> 15:36.720
When Peretti talks about the alliance between managers and employees, this is what socialists

15:36.720 --> 15:41.280
call class collaborationism. Because the adversarial relationship between the bourgeois

15:41.280 --> 15:45.840
and the proletariat is inherent to the Marxian class dynamic, it can only be abolished through

15:45.840 --> 15:49.840
abolishing the bourgeois itself and making the means of production worker-owned.

15:49.840 --> 15:53.200
Any other relationship that allows the class dynamic to continue,

15:53.200 --> 15:57.600
even if some workers are treated better than others, is collaboration between the classes.

15:57.600 --> 16:02.000
Socialists use the word collaboration specifically to call upon images of the downtrodden

16:02.000 --> 16:04.960
collaborating with their oppressor, victims collaborating with their overlords. Oh,

16:04.960 --> 16:09.200
and of course, they call it fascist. In other words, by the socialists' own morality,

16:09.200 --> 16:13.360
it doesn't matter that Peretti is, himself, an ideologically committed Marxist. He's still

16:13.360 --> 16:17.520
bourgeois. He's still the owner of the means of production, the head of an extractive institution

16:17.520 --> 16:22.000
that inherently oppresses the workers by trading capital for their labor and not giving them

16:22.000 --> 16:26.560
ownership. Regardless of his personal beliefs, he is still behaving like a capitalist.

16:26.560 --> 16:30.320
Now, in the real world, that's because as creator of a company, you're responsible for it. It's

16:30.320 --> 16:34.640
both your labor and your capital that created it. If you took loans or investment money to grow the

16:34.640 --> 16:38.400
company, you're responsible for that too. And the workers just aren't. In fact, the workers are

16:38.400 --> 16:43.040
often entirely oblivious to the responsibilities of ownership, which is how they were all so stupid

16:43.040 --> 16:46.800
as to make demands of BuzzFeed while they weren't even fucking solvent to begin with.

16:46.800 --> 16:51.440
But in the socialist La La Land, Peretti is a class traitor and probably a fascist capitalist

16:51.440 --> 16:56.000
pig. Every time a round of layoffs would hit or BuzzFeed announced another satellite was closing

16:56.000 --> 17:00.320
its doors, other media outlets would immediately start to sing their praises, talking about how

17:00.320 --> 17:04.560
important it was that BuzzFeed continue, how unfair it was that they were failing all that jazz.

17:04.560 --> 17:08.800
The journalist class is always hypersensitive when one of their fellow propaganda arms withers

17:08.800 --> 17:14.320
and dies. They all, of course, blame late-stage capitalism or social media megacorpos or whatever.

17:14.320 --> 17:18.960
Never once is the question asked, do these companies fail because the public at large

17:18.960 --> 17:23.120
just doesn't like the slop they put out? There's a detailed timeline of BuzzFeed's decline,

17:23.120 --> 17:26.880
which is quite interesting to read. Too much detail for this video. It goes into stock price

17:26.880 --> 17:31.600
fluctuations, universally going down since public in 2021, the slow hollowing out of BuzzFeed news

17:31.600 --> 17:36.000
and Peretti's denial that it's even happening to him, the ramping up of using AI to create the most

17:36.000 --> 17:39.920
banal of their content instead of having to employ writers to pen the next Game of Thrones

17:39.920 --> 17:45.760
or Marvel online quiz. But it's all for naught. BuzzFeed news has closed its doors and BuzzFeed

17:45.760 --> 17:51.360
itself is on life support. This is part of a wider trend of layoffs, strikes and bankruptcies all

17:51.360 --> 17:57.600
across corporate media. Vice, Vox, Insider, Disney, Washington Post, NPC, plus the writers and actors

17:57.600 --> 18:01.600
strikes, all stuff that I'll cover in future videos. It's all going up in flames and it's not

18:01.600 --> 18:06.080
because of late stage capitalism or whatever. It's because your average person just doesn't

18:06.080 --> 18:10.560
care to consume what they put out anymore. People are tired of the everything is political mantra

18:10.560 --> 18:14.880
that lies at the heart of all of their publishing. They're tired of diversity, inclusivity, equity

18:14.880 --> 18:19.360
being a constant political statement. They're tired that companies at the behest of champagne

18:19.360 --> 18:24.640
socialists like Peretti have turned each possible brand, outlet and franchise into a soapbox.

18:24.640 --> 18:29.280
They're not even necessarily tired of politics itself. The recent political drama about Trump's

18:29.280 --> 18:34.080
documents or the Hunter Biden court case are popular enough. They're tired of no longer having

18:34.080 --> 18:39.760
spaces where politics isn't talked about. This is the news that pretty tied for BuzzFeed long

18:39.760 --> 18:44.320
before it was even born, all the way back when he was a critical theory academic. And BuzzFeed has

18:44.320 --> 18:49.360
been slowly strangling within it for the better part of two decades. Anyone who looks at Peretti's

18:49.360 --> 18:53.360
career can understand this right away. This outcome was inevitable.
