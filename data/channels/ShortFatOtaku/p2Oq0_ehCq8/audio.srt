1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,520
Buzzfeed

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,080
Everybody knows Buzzfeed as a garbage website that publishes garbage articles,

3
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:14,560
full of woke nonsense and progressive apologia. But did you know that Buzzfeed actually began

4
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:17,840
as something completely different? This is the founder of Buzzfeed,

5
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:23,120
Jonah Peretti. His first footprint, at least in terms of online stuff, was back in 2001,

6
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:27,840
when his email exchange with Nike went viral. It was actually published on The Guardian way back

7
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:32,640
then. Nike was offering a custom shoe printing service, where you can ask them to print whatever

8
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:37,200
word you like on a pair of shoes. Peretti asked for a pair of Nike shoes with the word

9
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:41,920
Sweatshop embroidered on them, which Nike refused to do. Nike emailed him, stating that the custom

10
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:46,960
text was cancelled because it 1. Contained intellectual property, 2. Contained the name

11
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:52,000
of an athlete or team that Nike didn't have a contract with, 3. It was left blank, or 4. It

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,640
contained inappropriate slang of profanity. Nike didn't say which rule had been violated,

13
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:00,640
so Peretti replied by saying that Sweatshop isn't trademark, it's not the name of an athlete,

14
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:04,960
it's not blank, and it's not profanity, and that he wanted to remember the toil and labor of the

15
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:10,080
children that made his shoes. Nike responded, stating that Sweatshop was indeed inappropriate

16
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:14,560
slang. Peretti replied by citing Webster's Dictionary, where it's written that Sweatshop

17
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:18,560
isn't slang but is actually a normal word. Nike finally pulled the obvious trump card,

18
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:21,760
that they can actually just decline service for any reason they want.

19
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:25,760
Peretti then requested that instead of the embroidery, Nike send him a picture of the

20
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:30,640
10-year-old Vietnamese girl making his shoes. That was a wild ride, and I can appreciate a

21
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:33,840
good troll, but Peretti's politics are pretty clear from this exchange.

22
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:37,840
Back in 2001, when this happened, he would have been in his mid-twenties, and he likely

23
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:42,400
viewed himself as some flavor of revolutionary. He graduated from the University of California

24
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:46,960
in Santa Cruz in 1996, with a degree in environmental studies, with his most

25
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:51,760
notable academic work being the article Capitalism and Schizophrenia, published in a journal of

26
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:57,840
critical theory called Negations. Peretti's 1996 paper sets the stage for the rest of his career.

27
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:02,960
Here's how it begins. Every major corporation in the world has a web site offering product

28
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:08,320
information, interactive advertisements, and, increasingly, the ability to buy products online.

29
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:14,880
Discount books from Amazon.com, pizza delivery from Pizzanet.net, stocks from Schwab.com,

30
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:18,400
and just about anything else you can imagine, like the virtual mall,

31
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:22,320
VirtuMall.com, are available for purchase in cyberspace.

32
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:25,200
Wow, this paper really was written in 1996.

33
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:30,000
My central contention is that late capitalism not only accelerates the flow of capital,

34
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,960
but also accelerates the rate at which subjects assume identities. Identity formation is

35
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:39,440
inextricably linked to the urge to consume, and therefore the acceleration of capitalism

36
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:43,840
necessitates an increase in the rate at which individuals assume and shed identities.

37
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:48,320
The internet is one of many late capitalist phenomenon that allow for more flexible,

38
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:51,280
rapid, and profitable mechanisms of identity formation.

39
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:55,360
This almost sounds prophetic, doesn't it? Identity politics is a primary tool of the left,

40
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:58,320
though the right has begun to pick it up as well in recent years. And despite the

41
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:02,640
left's anti-capitalist stance, they have hyper-capitalized their identities.

42
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:07,680
From your random leftoid consumer demanding that you watch Captain Marvel or Black Panther

43
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:11,600
or Harley Quinn or else you're a bigot, to breadtubers growing ridiculously wealthy

44
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:15,360
off the backs of their viewers while simultaneously agitating for a revolution,

45
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:20,000
to champagne socialist coffee shop co-ops, to progressive clothing brands selling Che

46
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,560
Guevara t-shirts and trans rights hats, all of them made in overseas sweatshops.

47
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:28,880
Most of the paper is spent drawing links between capitalism and schizophrenia,

48
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:33,840
as the title would suggest. The point seems to be that the postmodernist youth art of the 1990s,

49
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:39,440
the erraticness of MTV programming is used as an example repeatedly, is schizophrenic in nature.

50
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:43,360
It mimics the schizophrenic experience. As such, the capitalist mindset and the

51
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:47,600
schizophrenic mindset are identical, mindless nonsense meant to be consumed

52
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:52,480
unthinkingly with no real purpose behind it. Schizophrenia is characterized as capitalism's

53
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:56,800
deepest tendency, but also that capitalism must ultimately fight back against it,

54
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:00,320
as schizos cannot be consumed, unlike other capitalist elements.

55
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:04,640
Schizophrenia is therefore the contradictions of capitalism finally made manifest,

56
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:08,560
an image of its impending collapse. Paredes' prescription is that activists

57
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:12,400
use schizophrenic strategies to accelerate consumer-based identity formation and

58
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:17,280
dissolution in order to destabilize the mental health of individuals and thus weaken capitalism.

59
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:21,200
There, I just packed 6,000 words of nonsense into one paragraph,

60
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:23,840
and V said that I couldn't summarize things quick enough.

61
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:28,400
The point is, before Jonah Peretti founded BuzzFeed, he was a Marxist, a postmodernist,

62
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:32,880
and a critical theorist. When I read that paper, it seemed to me that he had a specific interest

63
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:37,680
in how modern mental illness was created by, and was a mirror of, late-stage capitalism.

64
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:42,400
How self-identification drives consumerism, and how the destabilization of identities,

65
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:46,640
through rapid capitalist consumption, can generate mental illnesses and hasten the

66
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:49,840
collapse of the current system. Keep all of this in mind for later.

67
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:53,920
After Peretti's academic career slowed down, he was a co-founder of the Huffington Post

68
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:58,000
back in 2005, along with Kenneth Lehrer, Arianna Huffington, the site's namesake,

69
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,720
and surprisingly enough, Andrew Breitbart. Arianna Huffington was a conservative in a previous era

70
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:07,440
of her life, and Andrew Breitbart had mentored under her. She shifted leftward during the George

71
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:12,240
Bush years, and the initial idea of Huffington Post was that the two media titans, left and

72
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:17,280
right-leaning, would keep the site balanced. But in actuality, Huffington Post gradually drifted

73
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:21,840
leftward over time, and Breitbart moved on to found his own outlet. Peretti, for his part,

74
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:26,800
did a lot of the background tech startup stuff for the Huffington Post, but he used the experience

75
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:32,560
gained there to found BuzzFeed a year later in 2006. Now, for those of you who are younger,

76
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:37,120
you might not know this, but BuzzFeed actually didn't begin as a news outlet.

77
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:42,000
Peretti marketed it as the internet's popularity contest, and it aggregated stuff going viral at

78
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,320
the time, almost like a primitive version of Reddit. The term viral hadn't even been coined

79
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:51,280
yet, though, so they called any story that was blowing up online buzz instead. Unlike Reddit,

80
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:56,480
though, BuzzFeed also produced its own comedic content and added that into the mix, similar to

81
00:05:56,480 --> 00:06:01,360
Cracked or College Humor. Though this era of BuzzFeed did have political commentary,

82
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,960
it wasn't the site's main goal. Politics came up when a political story was either

83
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:10,640
viral or funny, but otherwise, the site focused on short, snappy, shareable bits of content,

84
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:15,680
with no real overarching theme behind it. In a sense, it was quasi-schizophrenic.

85
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:20,720
BuzzFeed also brought in a now-ubiquitous innovation in website design. It seems obvious

86
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:26,000
to us nowadays, but the idea of having a trending tab, aka a dedicated box on the front page,

87
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,360
featuring the stories getting the most clicks right now, rather than a simple chronological

88
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:34,240
order? Yeah, that wasn't a thing in 2006, and BuzzFeed popularized the feature. Also,

89
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:39,200
their 2006 About page really reads like something out of an AI conversation from right now,

90
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:42,960
explaining that their automated algorithms detect what's popular and filter it down to

91
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:47,040
BuzzFeed's staff. To put this into context, this is from right around when YouTube was first

92
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:51,600
launching. Nobody except maybe Microsoft was tinkering with software like this.

93
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:54,320
Of course, they could also just be blowing smoke up our asses, who knows.

94
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:59,920
BuzzFeed made the official jump from comedy aggregator to political news outlet in 2012,

95
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:04,880
when it was the first publication, both online and print, to break the news that John McCain

96
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:09,920
was going to endorse Mitt Romney in the 2012 presidential race. Breaking the story first

97
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:14,480
massively raised BuzzFeed's profile and led to several rounds of investment, with the intention

98
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:18,800
of turning BuzzFeed into a serious force in political news. And though Peretti would use

99
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:23,360
the investment capital to massively expand BuzzFeed out, that didn't really change its

100
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:27,920
reliability in the eyes of the public. A 2014 Pew Research Center survey found that

101
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:32,640
while the majority of people didn't even know or care about BuzzFeed, most people who did

102
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:38,240
viewed it as an inaccurate news source. In order to combat this, BuzzFeed's real journalism split

103
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:43,920
off into BuzzFeedNews.com, but that didn't really help them. BuzzFeed's actual history of reporting

104
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:48,480
basically shows us that there is no barrel too deep that they won't scrape the bottom of it.

105
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:52,960
Following in Gawker's footsteps, BuzzFeed has no problem holding a double standard when it

106
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:57,120
comes to celebrity nude photos. They published an article decrying people wanting to see the

107
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:01,600
Jennifer Lawrence nudes, but they were completely okay with the babies. BuzzFeed staff have been

108
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:06,400
fired for plagiarism, and not just some random intern, but senior reporters. They have no problem

109
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:09,440
publishing stories without confirming the evidence that they're citing in the story.

110
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:15,280
And of course, BuzzFeed published the legendary Trump Piss Dossier back in January of 2017.

111
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:18,480
I don't know if you remember, it really went viral back then. The majority of the political

112
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:22,240
claims in it, regardless of their veracity, were completely overshadowed by the fact that the

113
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:27,840
dossier falsely claimed that Trump rented out the same hotel room that Obama stayed in in Moscow,

114
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:32,960
hired prostitutes, pissed all over them in the same bed Obama slept in, and that the Russians

115
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:37,200
caught it all on tape and they were blackmailing Trump with it. That was all fake, by the way.

116
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:42,800
No other news outlet would touch that shit with a 10-foot pole, but BuzzFeed jumped right into the

117
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:47,680
piss pit without a second thought. They even admitted, again, they had not actually verified

118
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:52,160
the contents of the dossier, and other journalists were rightly angry with them for undermining

119
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:55,840
the integrity of their profession, which is prophetic considering the state of journalism

120
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:59,760
six years later. But nonetheless, they had a point back then. They lost those morals to Trump

121
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:04,400
Derangement Syndrome eventually, but the objection to BuzzFeed's actions was rooted in the idea that

122
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:09,440
journalism had to focus on accuracy rather than partisanship, which is a good objection even if

123
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:13,920
they eventually abandon the principle. And then there's the financial troubles. By the end of

124
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:17,920
2017, the company still wasn't profitable. And in response to investor pressure,

125
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:21,840
Freddie began to close the doors of some of BuzzFeed's satellite outlets and laid off a

126
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:27,440
round of employees, 100 in the States, 100 in France, and 45 in the UK. Another round of layoffs

127
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:34,080
hit in 2019, this time approximately 200 people. In 2020, BuzzFeed shut down its UK on Australian

128
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:39,280
divisions entirely. In March of 2022, three top editors announced that they'd be resigning and

129
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:44,240
that the whole of BuzzFeed News itself would be facing widespread layoffs. And with the writing

130
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:49,280
on the wall, BuzzFeed News was finally shut down on April 20th, 2023. That doesn't mean that

131
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:54,080
Freddie is without a news mouthpiece, though. The failed upward success of BuzzFeed allowed him to

132
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:58,400
eventually purchase the Huffington Post, his old stomping grounds, and his plan seems to be to

133
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:04,480
focus on making news content over there and leave BuzzFeed for trash, I guess. In an email to his

134
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:09,440
staff, Freddie said, I made the decision to overinvest in BuzzFeed News because I love their

135
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:14,160
work and their mission so much. This made me slow to accept that the big platforms wouldn't provide

136
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:18,640
the distribution or the financial support required to support premium, free journalism

137
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:23,200
purpose-built for social media. To be fair, BuzzFeed has published some good work. They

138
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:27,840
won a Pulitzer for their expose on the Uyghur genocide in China, but they've also done a lot

139
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:32,560
of garbage. They've done mostly garbage, in fact. Amidst all of this, a failing company,

140
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:37,440
no profitability for years, would it surprise you to learn that BuzzFeed also had strikes?

141
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:42,000
Yes, despite BuzzFeed being run by an ideological Marxist, there were still labor disputes. Who

142
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,000
would've thought? Now, I've spoken about unions before on this channel. I'm not opposed to the

143
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,320
idea of unions in principle. I just don't think that they're good for every single type of job.

144
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:54,880
I've personally seen examples of very good unions that have protected workers who are being bullied

145
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:59,840
by particularly sadistic managers. I've also personally seen examples of bad unions where

146
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:05,280
the worst employees were simply allowed to fail upward due to their seniority. A union is not a

147
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:10,000
guarantee that things in the workplace will be better. A union is simply what it says on the tin.

148
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,320
Collective bargaining. In a job where your skills are in high demand, where you're raking in the

149
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:18,160
money and other companies are actually headhunting you and giving you better offers, you don't need

150
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:23,120
a union. In that case, the worker actually has the power, despite how Marxists might cry about

151
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:28,080
how that can never be true, because their labor is specialized and rare. They can actually negotiate

152
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:32,960
on their own for a good contract. In other words, individual bargaining. Low-skill workers whose

153
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:37,440
labor isn't individually very valuable, they don't have those perks, which is the main argument for

154
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:42,080
collective bargaining. However, history has also shown us that collective bargaining in the face

155
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:46,960
of a collapsing market does nothing. It's one thing when the industry is booming and the owners

156
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:51,360
of businesses are rat-fucking their employees. Unions can do some good work there to get the

157
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:54,720
standards of living up for their workers, but in an industry that is shrinking, where there is

158
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:59,200
actually little money to be made, the demands of unionization tend to hasten the company's demise,

159
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:03,600
rather than actually help any workers out. To put it simply, you just can't squeeze any more blood

160
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:07,520
out of that stone, and that's the situation that BuzzFeed has consistently found itself in.

161
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:12,080
From 2017 onward, while Peretti was downsizing his company again and again in an attempt to

162
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:16,560
keep his head above water, he was also facing demands from his workforce to unionize. These

163
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:21,920
efforts finally came to a head in February of 2019, where the employees of BuzzFeed News voted

164
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:26,000
to unionize. At the time, the editor-in-chief stated, we look forward to meeting with the

165
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,400
organizers to discuss a way towards voluntarily recognizing the union. But when it came time to

166
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:34,720
actually sit down and work it out in April, the executives failed to show up for the meeting.

167
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:39,040
The BuzzFeed News union on Twitter put them on blast with a viral tweet and staged a walkout

168
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:43,920
in response. But by 2021, they still hadn't hammered out an agreement. Another viral tweet,

169
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:49,040
another walkout. And when all the layoffs came in 2023, the BuzzFeed News union Twitter account

170
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:54,000
was crying about how unfair it all was, and shilling a GoFundMe for the former employees.

171
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,160
The union, for all of its news coverage, for all of its agitation, for all of its walkouts and

172
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:02,880
threats of strikes, and viral tweets, only ever managed to get BuzzFeed to come to a tentative

173
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:08,400
agreement in March of 2022. Various unionistas were hailing this as a huge win at the time,

174
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:12,400
but considering that the fucking business died a year later, it didn't really matter.

175
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:16,240
Now, I don't think that unionization killed BuzzFeed. Far from it. But do you think that

176
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:21,280
spending even more on labor while already not being profitable would have helped their situation?

177
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:26,160
Obviously not. Peretti himself was ultimately opposed to the idea of unionization,

178
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:30,560
despite what his politics might make you believe. Back in 2015, he was asked about unionization and

179
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:35,280
gave a pretty long, in-depth reply. I think unions have had a positive impact on a lot of places,

180
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:38,400
like if you're working on an assembly line, and if you're negotiating with management,

181
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:42,400
it can make a huge difference, particularly when labor is more replaceable. I don't think a union

182
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:46,640
is right for BuzzFeed for two reasons. One, I think the way we pattern BuzzFeed is after

183
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:50,800
companies like Google and Facebook, and the tech startups are very competitive for talent. They're

184
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:55,280
all trying to get the best talent. That's how I see BuzzFeed as well. We need to provide amazing

185
00:13:55,280 --> 00:14:00,080
benefits. We need to provide as much incentive for people to pick BuzzFeed over any other company.

186
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:04,160
A lot of the best new-economy companies are environments where there's an alliance between

187
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:09,040
managers and employees. People have shared goals. Benefits and perks and compensation are very

188
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:12,560
competitive, and I feel like that's the kind of market we're in. A lot of times, when you look

189
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:16,880
at companies that have unionized, the relationship is much more adversarial. I think that actually

190
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:21,200
wouldn't be very good for employees at BuzzFeed, particularly people who are writers and reporters,

191
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:24,800
because the comps for writers and reporters are much less favorable than the comps for

192
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:28,880
startup companies and tech companies. In general, I don't think it's the right idea for us.

193
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:32,400
The other thing about BuzzFeed is that we're global. Most unions are national.

194
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:36,560
We have people who move between different roles, and in general, unions do a lot of defining clearly

195
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:41,120
what individual roles are and what a job function is. So for a flexible, dynamic company, it isn't

196
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:44,880
something I think would be great. There's a lot of good points in here, like how BuzzFeed is already

197
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:48,960
incentivized to keep talent around through better offers due to the competitiveness of their market,

198
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:52,640
which isn't the case in blue-collar work. But I think the most interesting point is when he

199
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:56,960
mentioned that he views BuzzFeed as having an alliance between managers and employees,

200
00:14:56,960 --> 00:15:00,160
where other industries have more adversarial relationships.

201
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:04,320
Now, Peretti is a Marxist. We established that at the beginning of the video. He should know that,

202
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:09,440
in Marxian terms, the managers and employees, the bourgeois and the proletariat, are inherently in

203
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:13,680
an adversarial relationship due to their differing connection to the means of production. The

204
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:18,240
bourgeois own the means of production and seek to extract surplus value from the proletariat.

205
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:22,960
The proletariat work the means of production, and they must sell their labor in order to survive.

206
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:28,480
Socialists view this relationship as inherently exploitative. It cannot not be adversarial in

207
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:32,400
their book. It's impossible for them to have aligned goals in their view.

208
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:36,720
When Peretti talks about the alliance between managers and employees, this is what socialists

209
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:41,280
call class collaborationism. Because the adversarial relationship between the bourgeois

210
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:45,840
and the proletariat is inherent to the Marxian class dynamic, it can only be abolished through

211
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:49,840
abolishing the bourgeois itself and making the means of production worker-owned.

212
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:53,200
Any other relationship that allows the class dynamic to continue,

213
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:57,600
even if some workers are treated better than others, is collaboration between the classes.

214
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:02,000
Socialists use the word collaboration specifically to call upon images of the downtrodden

215
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,960
collaborating with their oppressor, victims collaborating with their overlords. Oh,

216
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:09,200
and of course, they call it fascist. In other words, by the socialists' own morality,

217
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:13,360
it doesn't matter that Peretti is, himself, an ideologically committed Marxist. He's still

218
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:17,520
bourgeois. He's still the owner of the means of production, the head of an extractive institution

219
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:22,000
that inherently oppresses the workers by trading capital for their labor and not giving them

220
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,560
ownership. Regardless of his personal beliefs, he is still behaving like a capitalist.

221
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:30,320
Now, in the real world, that's because as creator of a company, you're responsible for it. It's

222
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:34,640
both your labor and your capital that created it. If you took loans or investment money to grow the

223
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:38,400
company, you're responsible for that too. And the workers just aren't. In fact, the workers are

224
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:43,040
often entirely oblivious to the responsibilities of ownership, which is how they were all so stupid

225
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:46,800
as to make demands of BuzzFeed while they weren't even fucking solvent to begin with.

226
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:51,440
But in the socialist La La Land, Peretti is a class traitor and probably a fascist capitalist

227
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:56,000
pig. Every time a round of layoffs would hit or BuzzFeed announced another satellite was closing

228
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:00,320
its doors, other media outlets would immediately start to sing their praises, talking about how

229
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:04,560
important it was that BuzzFeed continue, how unfair it was that they were failing all that jazz.

230
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:08,800
The journalist class is always hypersensitive when one of their fellow propaganda arms withers

231
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:14,320
and dies. They all, of course, blame late-stage capitalism or social media megacorpos or whatever.

232
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:18,960
Never once is the question asked, do these companies fail because the public at large

233
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:23,120
just doesn't like the slop they put out? There's a detailed timeline of BuzzFeed's decline,

234
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:26,880
which is quite interesting to read. Too much detail for this video. It goes into stock price

235
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:31,600
fluctuations, universally going down since public in 2021, the slow hollowing out of BuzzFeed news

236
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:36,000
and Peretti's denial that it's even happening to him, the ramping up of using AI to create the most

237
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,920
banal of their content instead of having to employ writers to pen the next Game of Thrones

238
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:45,760
or Marvel online quiz. But it's all for naught. BuzzFeed news has closed its doors and BuzzFeed

239
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:51,360
itself is on life support. This is part of a wider trend of layoffs, strikes and bankruptcies all

240
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:57,600
across corporate media. Vice, Vox, Insider, Disney, Washington Post, NPC, plus the writers and actors

241
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:01,600
strikes, all stuff that I'll cover in future videos. It's all going up in flames and it's not

242
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:06,080
because of late stage capitalism or whatever. It's because your average person just doesn't

243
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:10,560
care to consume what they put out anymore. People are tired of the everything is political mantra

244
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:14,880
that lies at the heart of all of their publishing. They're tired of diversity, inclusivity, equity

245
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:19,360
being a constant political statement. They're tired that companies at the behest of champagne

246
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:24,640
socialists like Peretti have turned each possible brand, outlet and franchise into a soapbox.

247
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:29,280
They're not even necessarily tired of politics itself. The recent political drama about Trump's

248
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:34,080
documents or the Hunter Biden court case are popular enough. They're tired of no longer having

249
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:39,760
spaces where politics isn't talked about. This is the news that pretty tied for BuzzFeed long

250
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:44,320
before it was even born, all the way back when he was a critical theory academic. And BuzzFeed has

251
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:49,360
been slowly strangling within it for the better part of two decades. Anyone who looks at Peretti's

252
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:53,360
career can understand this right away. This outcome was inevitable.
