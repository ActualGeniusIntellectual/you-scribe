0	5520	Buzzfeed
5520	10080	Everybody knows Buzzfeed as a garbage website that publishes garbage articles,
10080	14560	full of woke nonsense and progressive apologia. But did you know that Buzzfeed actually began
14560	17840	as something completely different? This is the founder of Buzzfeed,
17840	23120	Jonah Peretti. His first footprint, at least in terms of online stuff, was back in 2001,
23120	27840	when his email exchange with Nike went viral. It was actually published on The Guardian way back
27840	32640	then. Nike was offering a custom shoe printing service, where you can ask them to print whatever
32640	37200	word you like on a pair of shoes. Peretti asked for a pair of Nike shoes with the word
37200	41920	Sweatshop embroidered on them, which Nike refused to do. Nike emailed him, stating that the custom
41920	46960	text was cancelled because it 1. Contained intellectual property, 2. Contained the name
46960	52000	of an athlete or team that Nike didn't have a contract with, 3. It was left blank, or 4. It
52000	56640	contained inappropriate slang of profanity. Nike didn't say which rule had been violated,
56640	60640	so Peretti replied by saying that Sweatshop isn't trademark, it's not the name of an athlete,
60640	64960	it's not blank, and it's not profanity, and that he wanted to remember the toil and labor of the
64960	70080	children that made his shoes. Nike responded, stating that Sweatshop was indeed inappropriate
70080	74560	slang. Peretti replied by citing Webster's Dictionary, where it's written that Sweatshop
74560	78560	isn't slang but is actually a normal word. Nike finally pulled the obvious trump card,
78560	81760	that they can actually just decline service for any reason they want.
81760	85760	Peretti then requested that instead of the embroidery, Nike send him a picture of the
85760	90640	10-year-old Vietnamese girl making his shoes. That was a wild ride, and I can appreciate a
90640	93840	good troll, but Peretti's politics are pretty clear from this exchange.
93840	97840	Back in 2001, when this happened, he would have been in his mid-twenties, and he likely
97840	102400	viewed himself as some flavor of revolutionary. He graduated from the University of California
102400	106960	in Santa Cruz in 1996, with a degree in environmental studies, with his most
106960	111760	notable academic work being the article Capitalism and Schizophrenia, published in a journal of
111760	117840	critical theory called Negations. Peretti's 1996 paper sets the stage for the rest of his career.
117840	122960	Here's how it begins. Every major corporation in the world has a web site offering product
122960	128320	information, interactive advertisements, and, increasingly, the ability to buy products online.
128320	134880	Discount books from Amazon.com, pizza delivery from Pizzanet.net, stocks from Schwab.com,
134880	138400	and just about anything else you can imagine, like the virtual mall,
138480	142320	VirtuMall.com, are available for purchase in cyberspace.
142320	145200	Wow, this paper really was written in 1996.
145200	150000	My central contention is that late capitalism not only accelerates the flow of capital,
150000	154960	but also accelerates the rate at which subjects assume identities. Identity formation is
154960	159440	inextricably linked to the urge to consume, and therefore the acceleration of capitalism
159440	163840	necessitates an increase in the rate at which individuals assume and shed identities.
163840	168320	The internet is one of many late capitalist phenomenon that allow for more flexible,
168320	171280	rapid, and profitable mechanisms of identity formation.
171280	175360	This almost sounds prophetic, doesn't it? Identity politics is a primary tool of the left,
175360	178320	though the right has begun to pick it up as well in recent years. And despite the
178320	182640	left's anti-capitalist stance, they have hyper-capitalized their identities.
182640	187680	From your random leftoid consumer demanding that you watch Captain Marvel or Black Panther
187680	191600	or Harley Quinn or else you're a bigot, to breadtubers growing ridiculously wealthy
191600	195360	off the backs of their viewers while simultaneously agitating for a revolution,
195360	200000	to champagne socialist coffee shop co-ops, to progressive clothing brands selling Che
200000	204560	Guevara t-shirts and trans rights hats, all of them made in overseas sweatshops.
204560	208880	Most of the paper is spent drawing links between capitalism and schizophrenia,
208880	213840	as the title would suggest. The point seems to be that the postmodernist youth art of the 1990s,
213840	219440	the erraticness of MTV programming is used as an example repeatedly, is schizophrenic in nature.
219440	223360	It mimics the schizophrenic experience. As such, the capitalist mindset and the
223360	227600	schizophrenic mindset are identical, mindless nonsense meant to be consumed
227600	232480	unthinkingly with no real purpose behind it. Schizophrenia is characterized as capitalism's
232480	236800	deepest tendency, but also that capitalism must ultimately fight back against it,
236800	240320	as schizos cannot be consumed, unlike other capitalist elements.
240320	244640	Schizophrenia is therefore the contradictions of capitalism finally made manifest,
244640	248560	an image of its impending collapse. Paredes' prescription is that activists
248560	252400	use schizophrenic strategies to accelerate consumer-based identity formation and
252400	257280	dissolution in order to destabilize the mental health of individuals and thus weaken capitalism.
257280	261200	There, I just packed 6,000 words of nonsense into one paragraph,
261200	263840	and V said that I couldn't summarize things quick enough.
263840	268400	The point is, before Jonah Peretti founded BuzzFeed, he was a Marxist, a postmodernist,
268400	272880	and a critical theorist. When I read that paper, it seemed to me that he had a specific interest
272880	277680	in how modern mental illness was created by, and was a mirror of, late-stage capitalism.
277680	282400	How self-identification drives consumerism, and how the destabilization of identities,
282400	286640	through rapid capitalist consumption, can generate mental illnesses and hasten the
286640	289840	collapse of the current system. Keep all of this in mind for later.
289840	293920	After Peretti's academic career slowed down, he was a co-founder of the Huffington Post
293920	298000	back in 2005, along with Kenneth Lehrer, Arianna Huffington, the site's namesake,
298000	302720	and surprisingly enough, Andrew Breitbart. Arianna Huffington was a conservative in a previous era
302720	307440	of her life, and Andrew Breitbart had mentored under her. She shifted leftward during the George
307440	312240	Bush years, and the initial idea of Huffington Post was that the two media titans, left and
312240	317280	right-leaning, would keep the site balanced. But in actuality, Huffington Post gradually drifted
317280	321840	leftward over time, and Breitbart moved on to found his own outlet. Peretti, for his part,
321840	326800	did a lot of the background tech startup stuff for the Huffington Post, but he used the experience
326800	332560	gained there to found BuzzFeed a year later in 2006. Now, for those of you who are younger,
332560	337120	you might not know this, but BuzzFeed actually didn't begin as a news outlet.
337120	342000	Peretti marketed it as the internet's popularity contest, and it aggregated stuff going viral at
342000	346320	the time, almost like a primitive version of Reddit. The term viral hadn't even been coined
346320	351280	yet, though, so they called any story that was blowing up online buzz instead. Unlike Reddit,
351280	356480	though, BuzzFeed also produced its own comedic content and added that into the mix, similar to
356480	361360	Cracked or College Humor. Though this era of BuzzFeed did have political commentary,
361360	364960	it wasn't the site's main goal. Politics came up when a political story was either
364960	370640	viral or funny, but otherwise, the site focused on short, snappy, shareable bits of content,
370640	375680	with no real overarching theme behind it. In a sense, it was quasi-schizophrenic.
375680	380720	BuzzFeed also brought in a now-ubiquitous innovation in website design. It seems obvious
380720	386000	to us nowadays, but the idea of having a trending tab, aka a dedicated box on the front page,
386000	389360	featuring the stories getting the most clicks right now, rather than a simple chronological
389360	394240	order? Yeah, that wasn't a thing in 2006, and BuzzFeed popularized the feature. Also,
394240	399200	their 2006 About page really reads like something out of an AI conversation from right now,
399200	402960	explaining that their automated algorithms detect what's popular and filter it down to
402960	407040	BuzzFeed's staff. To put this into context, this is from right around when YouTube was first
407040	411600	launching. Nobody except maybe Microsoft was tinkering with software like this.
411600	414320	Of course, they could also just be blowing smoke up our asses, who knows.
414320	419920	BuzzFeed made the official jump from comedy aggregator to political news outlet in 2012,
419920	424880	when it was the first publication, both online and print, to break the news that John McCain
424880	429920	was going to endorse Mitt Romney in the 2012 presidential race. Breaking the story first
429920	434480	massively raised BuzzFeed's profile and led to several rounds of investment, with the intention
434480	438800	of turning BuzzFeed into a serious force in political news. And though Peretti would use
438800	443360	the investment capital to massively expand BuzzFeed out, that didn't really change its
443360	447920	reliability in the eyes of the public. A 2014 Pew Research Center survey found that
447920	452640	while the majority of people didn't even know or care about BuzzFeed, most people who did
452640	458240	viewed it as an inaccurate news source. In order to combat this, BuzzFeed's real journalism split
458240	463920	off into BuzzFeedNews.com, but that didn't really help them. BuzzFeed's actual history of reporting
463920	468480	basically shows us that there is no barrel too deep that they won't scrape the bottom of it.
468480	472960	Following in Gawker's footsteps, BuzzFeed has no problem holding a double standard when it
472960	477120	comes to celebrity nude photos. They published an article decrying people wanting to see the
477120	481600	Jennifer Lawrence nudes, but they were completely okay with the babies. BuzzFeed staff have been
481600	486400	fired for plagiarism, and not just some random intern, but senior reporters. They have no problem
486400	489440	publishing stories without confirming the evidence that they're citing in the story.
489440	495280	And of course, BuzzFeed published the legendary Trump Piss Dossier back in January of 2017.
495280	498480	I don't know if you remember, it really went viral back then. The majority of the political
498480	502240	claims in it, regardless of their veracity, were completely overshadowed by the fact that the
502240	507840	dossier falsely claimed that Trump rented out the same hotel room that Obama stayed in in Moscow,
507840	512960	hired prostitutes, pissed all over them in the same bed Obama slept in, and that the Russians
512960	517200	caught it all on tape and they were blackmailing Trump with it. That was all fake, by the way.
517200	522800	No other news outlet would touch that shit with a 10-foot pole, but BuzzFeed jumped right into the
522800	527680	piss pit without a second thought. They even admitted, again, they had not actually verified
527680	532160	the contents of the dossier, and other journalists were rightly angry with them for undermining
532160	535840	the integrity of their profession, which is prophetic considering the state of journalism
535840	539760	six years later. But nonetheless, they had a point back then. They lost those morals to Trump
539760	544400	Derangement Syndrome eventually, but the objection to BuzzFeed's actions was rooted in the idea that
544400	549440	journalism had to focus on accuracy rather than partisanship, which is a good objection even if
549440	553920	they eventually abandon the principle. And then there's the financial troubles. By the end of
553920	557920	2017, the company still wasn't profitable. And in response to investor pressure,
557920	561840	Freddie began to close the doors of some of BuzzFeed's satellite outlets and laid off a
561840	567440	round of employees, 100 in the States, 100 in France, and 45 in the UK. Another round of layoffs
567440	574080	hit in 2019, this time approximately 200 people. In 2020, BuzzFeed shut down its UK on Australian
574080	579280	divisions entirely. In March of 2022, three top editors announced that they'd be resigning and
579280	584240	that the whole of BuzzFeed News itself would be facing widespread layoffs. And with the writing
584240	589280	on the wall, BuzzFeed News was finally shut down on April 20th, 2023. That doesn't mean that
589280	594080	Freddie is without a news mouthpiece, though. The failed upward success of BuzzFeed allowed him to
594080	598400	eventually purchase the Huffington Post, his old stomping grounds, and his plan seems to be to
598400	604480	focus on making news content over there and leave BuzzFeed for trash, I guess. In an email to his
604480	609440	staff, Freddie said, I made the decision to overinvest in BuzzFeed News because I love their
609440	614160	work and their mission so much. This made me slow to accept that the big platforms wouldn't provide
614160	618640	the distribution or the financial support required to support premium, free journalism
618640	623200	purpose-built for social media. To be fair, BuzzFeed has published some good work. They
623200	627840	won a Pulitzer for their expose on the Uyghur genocide in China, but they've also done a lot
627840	632560	of garbage. They've done mostly garbage, in fact. Amidst all of this, a failing company,
632560	637440	no profitability for years, would it surprise you to learn that BuzzFeed also had strikes?
637440	642000	Yes, despite BuzzFeed being run by an ideological Marxist, there were still labor disputes. Who
642000	646000	would've thought? Now, I've spoken about unions before on this channel. I'm not opposed to the
646000	650320	idea of unions in principle. I just don't think that they're good for every single type of job.
650320	654880	I've personally seen examples of very good unions that have protected workers who are being bullied
654880	659840	by particularly sadistic managers. I've also personally seen examples of bad unions where
659840	665280	the worst employees were simply allowed to fail upward due to their seniority. A union is not a
665280	670000	guarantee that things in the workplace will be better. A union is simply what it says on the tin.
670000	674320	Collective bargaining. In a job where your skills are in high demand, where you're raking in the
674320	678160	money and other companies are actually headhunting you and giving you better offers, you don't need
678160	683120	a union. In that case, the worker actually has the power, despite how Marxists might cry about
683120	688080	how that can never be true, because their labor is specialized and rare. They can actually negotiate
688080	692960	on their own for a good contract. In other words, individual bargaining. Low-skill workers whose
692960	697440	labor isn't individually very valuable, they don't have those perks, which is the main argument for
697440	702080	collective bargaining. However, history has also shown us that collective bargaining in the face
702080	706960	of a collapsing market does nothing. It's one thing when the industry is booming and the owners
706960	711360	of businesses are rat-fucking their employees. Unions can do some good work there to get the
711360	714720	standards of living up for their workers, but in an industry that is shrinking, where there is
714720	719200	actually little money to be made, the demands of unionization tend to hasten the company's demise,
719200	723600	rather than actually help any workers out. To put it simply, you just can't squeeze any more blood
723600	727520	out of that stone, and that's the situation that BuzzFeed has consistently found itself in.
727520	732080	From 2017 onward, while Peretti was downsizing his company again and again in an attempt to
732080	736560	keep his head above water, he was also facing demands from his workforce to unionize. These
736560	741920	efforts finally came to a head in February of 2019, where the employees of BuzzFeed News voted
741920	746000	to unionize. At the time, the editor-in-chief stated, we look forward to meeting with the
746000	750400	organizers to discuss a way towards voluntarily recognizing the union. But when it came time to
750400	754720	actually sit down and work it out in April, the executives failed to show up for the meeting.
754720	759040	The BuzzFeed News union on Twitter put them on blast with a viral tweet and staged a walkout
759040	763920	in response. But by 2021, they still hadn't hammered out an agreement. Another viral tweet,
763920	769040	another walkout. And when all the layoffs came in 2023, the BuzzFeed News union Twitter account
769040	774000	was crying about how unfair it all was, and shilling a GoFundMe for the former employees.
774000	778160	The union, for all of its news coverage, for all of its agitation, for all of its walkouts and
778160	782880	threats of strikes, and viral tweets, only ever managed to get BuzzFeed to come to a tentative
782880	788400	agreement in March of 2022. Various unionistas were hailing this as a huge win at the time,
788400	792400	but considering that the fucking business died a year later, it didn't really matter.
792400	796240	Now, I don't think that unionization killed BuzzFeed. Far from it. But do you think that
796240	801280	spending even more on labor while already not being profitable would have helped their situation?
801280	806160	Obviously not. Peretti himself was ultimately opposed to the idea of unionization,
806160	810560	despite what his politics might make you believe. Back in 2015, he was asked about unionization and
810560	815280	gave a pretty long, in-depth reply. I think unions have had a positive impact on a lot of places,
815280	818400	like if you're working on an assembly line, and if you're negotiating with management,
818400	822400	it can make a huge difference, particularly when labor is more replaceable. I don't think a union
822400	826640	is right for BuzzFeed for two reasons. One, I think the way we pattern BuzzFeed is after
826640	830800	companies like Google and Facebook, and the tech startups are very competitive for talent. They're
830800	835280	all trying to get the best talent. That's how I see BuzzFeed as well. We need to provide amazing
835280	840080	benefits. We need to provide as much incentive for people to pick BuzzFeed over any other company.
840080	844160	A lot of the best new-economy companies are environments where there's an alliance between
844160	849040	managers and employees. People have shared goals. Benefits and perks and compensation are very
849040	852560	competitive, and I feel like that's the kind of market we're in. A lot of times, when you look
852560	856880	at companies that have unionized, the relationship is much more adversarial. I think that actually
856880	861200	wouldn't be very good for employees at BuzzFeed, particularly people who are writers and reporters,
861200	864800	because the comps for writers and reporters are much less favorable than the comps for
864800	868880	startup companies and tech companies. In general, I don't think it's the right idea for us.
868880	872400	The other thing about BuzzFeed is that we're global. Most unions are national.
872400	876560	We have people who move between different roles, and in general, unions do a lot of defining clearly
876560	881120	what individual roles are and what a job function is. So for a flexible, dynamic company, it isn't
881120	884880	something I think would be great. There's a lot of good points in here, like how BuzzFeed is already
884880	888960	incentivized to keep talent around through better offers due to the competitiveness of their market,
888960	892640	which isn't the case in blue-collar work. But I think the most interesting point is when he
892640	896960	mentioned that he views BuzzFeed as having an alliance between managers and employees,
896960	900160	where other industries have more adversarial relationships.
900160	904320	Now, Peretti is a Marxist. We established that at the beginning of the video. He should know that,
904320	909440	in Marxian terms, the managers and employees, the bourgeois and the proletariat, are inherently in
909440	913680	an adversarial relationship due to their differing connection to the means of production. The
913680	918240	bourgeois own the means of production and seek to extract surplus value from the proletariat.
918240	922960	The proletariat work the means of production, and they must sell their labor in order to survive.
922960	928480	Socialists view this relationship as inherently exploitative. It cannot not be adversarial in
928480	932400	their book. It's impossible for them to have aligned goals in their view.
932400	936720	When Peretti talks about the alliance between managers and employees, this is what socialists
936720	941280	call class collaborationism. Because the adversarial relationship between the bourgeois
941280	945840	and the proletariat is inherent to the Marxian class dynamic, it can only be abolished through
945840	949840	abolishing the bourgeois itself and making the means of production worker-owned.
949840	953200	Any other relationship that allows the class dynamic to continue,
953200	957600	even if some workers are treated better than others, is collaboration between the classes.
957600	962000	Socialists use the word collaboration specifically to call upon images of the downtrodden
962000	964960	collaborating with their oppressor, victims collaborating with their overlords. Oh,
964960	969200	and of course, they call it fascist. In other words, by the socialists' own morality,
969200	973360	it doesn't matter that Peretti is, himself, an ideologically committed Marxist. He's still
973360	977520	bourgeois. He's still the owner of the means of production, the head of an extractive institution
977520	982000	that inherently oppresses the workers by trading capital for their labor and not giving them
982000	986560	ownership. Regardless of his personal beliefs, he is still behaving like a capitalist.
986560	990320	Now, in the real world, that's because as creator of a company, you're responsible for it. It's
990320	994640	both your labor and your capital that created it. If you took loans or investment money to grow the
994640	998400	company, you're responsible for that too. And the workers just aren't. In fact, the workers are
998400	1003040	often entirely oblivious to the responsibilities of ownership, which is how they were all so stupid
1003040	1006800	as to make demands of BuzzFeed while they weren't even fucking solvent to begin with.
1006800	1011440	But in the socialist La La Land, Peretti is a class traitor and probably a fascist capitalist
1011440	1016000	pig. Every time a round of layoffs would hit or BuzzFeed announced another satellite was closing
1016000	1020320	its doors, other media outlets would immediately start to sing their praises, talking about how
1020320	1024560	important it was that BuzzFeed continue, how unfair it was that they were failing all that jazz.
1024560	1028800	The journalist class is always hypersensitive when one of their fellow propaganda arms withers
1028800	1034320	and dies. They all, of course, blame late-stage capitalism or social media megacorpos or whatever.
1034320	1038960	Never once is the question asked, do these companies fail because the public at large
1038960	1043120	just doesn't like the slop they put out? There's a detailed timeline of BuzzFeed's decline,
1043120	1046880	which is quite interesting to read. Too much detail for this video. It goes into stock price
1046880	1051600	fluctuations, universally going down since public in 2021, the slow hollowing out of BuzzFeed news
1051600	1056000	and Peretti's denial that it's even happening to him, the ramping up of using AI to create the most
1056000	1059920	banal of their content instead of having to employ writers to pen the next Game of Thrones
1059920	1065760	or Marvel online quiz. But it's all for naught. BuzzFeed news has closed its doors and BuzzFeed
1065760	1071360	itself is on life support. This is part of a wider trend of layoffs, strikes and bankruptcies all
1071360	1077600	across corporate media. Vice, Vox, Insider, Disney, Washington Post, NPC, plus the writers and actors
1077600	1081600	strikes, all stuff that I'll cover in future videos. It's all going up in flames and it's not
1081600	1086080	because of late stage capitalism or whatever. It's because your average person just doesn't
1086080	1090560	care to consume what they put out anymore. People are tired of the everything is political mantra
1090560	1094880	that lies at the heart of all of their publishing. They're tired of diversity, inclusivity, equity
1094880	1099360	being a constant political statement. They're tired that companies at the behest of champagne
1099360	1104640	socialists like Peretti have turned each possible brand, outlet and franchise into a soapbox.
1104640	1109280	They're not even necessarily tired of politics itself. The recent political drama about Trump's
1109280	1114080	documents or the Hunter Biden court case are popular enough. They're tired of no longer having
1114080	1119760	spaces where politics isn't talked about. This is the news that pretty tied for BuzzFeed long
1119760	1124320	before it was even born, all the way back when he was a critical theory academic. And BuzzFeed has
1124320	1129360	been slowly strangling within it for the better part of two decades. Anyone who looks at Peretti's
1129360	1133360	career can understand this right away. This outcome was inevitable.
