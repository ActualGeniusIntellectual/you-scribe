00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,800
Hello my friends, sorry I'm a day late on this, but here I am and we're here talking about the

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:11,600
Iowa caucus results. Now, I've been saving up a lot of my content regarding the Democratic Party

3
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:17,200
and the Democratic nomination race for basically after Trump wins 2020, because let's be honest,

4
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:21,200
Trump's probably going to win 2020. Regardless of what you think of him, the Democrats have been in

5
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:26,640
such a sorry state basically since Trump beat Hillary in 2016. There is no way they're actually

6
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:31,120
going to unite behind a candidate or field anybody possible of beating Trump at this point.

7
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:35,680
So I have this script sitting around called the Collapse of the Democratic Party that basically

8
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:39,680
will be like an hour long deep dive into everything they've done wrong in the past four

9
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:44,880
years. But then with the aftermath of the Iowa caucus and the trending of the hashtag Mayor Cheat

10
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:49,600
I knew I had to at least talk about this a little bit. So here's the basic story of the Iowa caucus.

11
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:55,120
As soon as it became clear that that Bernie was in the lead and that the the media's chosen one,

12
00:00:55,120 --> 00:01:01,040
Joe Biden, was in fourth place, suddenly the preliminary polling stopped. Suddenly CNN stopped

13
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:05,520
reporting on it. Suddenly the numbers stopped showing up. And this is actually quite irregular

14
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:10,720
because usually with these kind of races, they keep people updated pretty regularly. You know,

15
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:15,600
CNN likes those views. They want people tuning in to kind of watch the drama of the race unfold

16
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:19,520
as the numbers come in and the districts flip between one candidate or another. But as soon

17
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:24,640
as it became clear that Bernie was the one who was going to win it, suddenly all reporting stops.

18
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:30,880
And when pressed on this, they said it was for quality control. Who the fuck knows what that

19
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:36,400
means? But it seems to have something to do with the fact that the DNC was basically testing out

20
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:41,360
a new app in the Iowa caucus. But of course, because we haven't had enough Saturday morning

21
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:45,840
cartoon villainy floating around this goddamn election, the app in question was made by a

22
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:52,560
company called Shadow. Shadow is partially funded by Pete Buttigieg, or as Sticks likes to call him,

23
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:56,800
Booty Judge, which kind of makes sense considering that he's also gay, but that's neither here nor

24
00:01:56,800 --> 00:02:03,040
there. But the company has ties to Hillary Clinton. It has ties to George Soros. Of course it does.

25
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:07,680
And as soon as it seems like the anti-establishment candidate in Bernie Sanders is going to win,

26
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:13,360
suddenly the polls stopped coming in for quality control purposes. Suddenly those reports that did

27
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:18,000
come in that show Sanders winning, they disappear off the internet. And then before the whole

28
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:25,040
situation is resolved, Pete Buttigieg declares himself winner on stage. He walks up and he says,

29
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:29,680
despite there's no official results, he's like, thank you very, thank you very much. I won, I won

30
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:40,720
Iowa. So we don't know all the results, but we know by the time it's all said and done, Iowa, you have

31
00:02:40,720 --> 00:03:01,440
shocked the nation. Because by all indications, we are going on to New Hampshire victorious.

32
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:09,440
So of course, hashtags like Mayor Cheat or Pete Cheats started trending with a whole bunch of

33
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,840
various little bits of evidence that just kind of, they don't really show anything on their own,

34
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:18,080
but they kind of piece together to form this fabric. There are stories of volunteers within

35
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:24,320
the DNC noticing various inconsistencies that might be proof of Buttigieg cheating, in fact,

36
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:29,520
outright. There's video of a coin toss since of course, in some smaller precincts, you might

37
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:33,760
actually have direct ties when there's not that many votes. And generally you decide them by

38
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:37,200
flipping a coin, where very clearly the guy looks at the coin,

39
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:42,160
notices what what side it landed on, and then flips it to announce a win for Buttigieg.

40
00:03:42,160 --> 00:04:04,400
Not even the identity politicians are happy because I guess they grabbed the six black

41
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:09,040
people that happened to be in existence during Buttigieg's speech and put them all in the front

42
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:13,040
to make him look more inclusive. There actually wasn't that many black people there.

43
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:18,240
That's me in the front on the right of Buttigieg. I was asked three times to move away from my

44
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:22,960
friends in order to be placed in pictures. Hashtag tokenism. But of course, for some of these people,

45
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:27,600
it doesn't matter how hard the DNC fucks them because they will always, always be loyal.

46
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:34,240
If you are legitimately tweeting the hashtag Mayor Cheat, then you are either a Russian operative,

47
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:39,520
a GOP operative, or a useful idiot playing right into Trump and Russia's strategy of

48
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:43,920
dividing the Democratic Party. Any Democrat is a thousand times better than Trump.

49
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:48,000
Well, maybe it's that the Democratic Party seems to be naturally divided right now.

50
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:54,720
You moron. Like, you have the neoliberal wing, and then you have the radical activist wing,

51
00:04:54,720 --> 00:05:01,040
with nothing for the actual moderate centrists of the nation to unite behind. I can't prove it yet.

52
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:07,600
I feel safe in saying that both Bernie 1 and Mayor Cheat are trending because Russian propaganda

53
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:12,480
accounts are amplifying them. Putin's goal is to divide us. Instead, let's stand together,

54
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:16,880
elect Democrats, and sanction his ass out of office. A lot of these people who say,

55
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:22,880
we have to unite behind X. It just so happens that X is their specific political view,

56
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:26,480
because they have no intention of ever uniting behind anything else,

57
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:28,800
so they want everyone to just go their way, I guess.

58
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:34,320
Here's the thing. I'm not a fan of Biden. I'm not a fan of Buttigieg. I'm not even that much

59
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:39,680
of a fan of Sanders. Sorry. I used to be until he cut out to Hillary in 2016. But anyway,

60
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:45,680
most campaigns' internal polling makes their campaign candidate look a bit better than the

61
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:49,920
rest. A bit better than they should be. And that's kind of to be expected. Like,

62
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:55,280
if Bernie's campaign releases polls, Bernie probably looks better in them than the average.

63
00:05:55,280 --> 00:06:00,560
So there was one point early in the night where when the official Iowa caucus results were not

64
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:05,440
being posted, Bernie's campaign was posting results showing him with this overwhelming lead.

65
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:08,320
And I'm not surprised that those weren't completely accurate. Nothing against Bernie,

66
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:12,800
it's just how these things go. But nonetheless, this is probably the worst case scenario

67
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:18,800
for the Democrats at this point, because not only is there no one candidate to unite behind

68
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:25,680
at this point, regardless of who he is, this was so poorly mismanaged. It is a complete shitshow.

69
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:31,600
And there is no way that the average undecided voter is going to have any kind of faith in the

70
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:36,720
Democrats after this showing. After all of this shady bullshit, if there's somebody who was on

71
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:40,240
the fence thinking whether to go right or left this time around, they're probably just going to

72
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:44,400
say, fuck it, I'll go for Trump. It's the worst case scenario because nobody comes out looking

73
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:48,800
good. The Bernie bros think that Bernie was robbed yet again. Maybe he was, maybe he wasn't,

74
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:53,360
who knows. But here's the thing, even if Bernie legitimately lost an election, like was it wasn't

75
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:58,400
the result of kind of some kind of like 2016 Hillary style backroom deal, but Bernie actually

76
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:01,840
lost, there's still going to be a bunch of Bernie fans who just don't accept it. You know, they're

77
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:06,080
gonna be like, oh, it's DNC, it's rigged again. Then you have Elizabeth Warren, who's rather

78
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:13,040
unlikeable. You have Joe Biden, who seems to have made a new living being one giant fumble.

79
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:17,120
And now you have Pete Buttigieg. And Pete Buttigieg, he was one of the ones that I

80
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:22,000
actually thought had a decent chance at beating Trump. For me, there was Kirsten Gillibrand,

81
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:27,040
there was Tulsi Gabbard, and then there was Pete Buttigieg. Those three probably had the best shot

82
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:30,960
at beating Trump. Sorry, Yang Gang, I just don't think he was viable. But nonetheless,

83
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:36,560
those three were always consistently suppressed by the DNC. And maybe it is the case that Pete's

84
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:43,200
spike is just a natural result of his electability finally bubbling to the surface after, you know,

85
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:47,680
the nine months of bullshit that have been the Democratic race. But regardless of whether or

86
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:53,040
not Pete stole the race, or if this is just, you know, a poorly managed situation doesn't look good

87
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:57,440
on the Democrats. There's no confidence in the party anymore. The way that they're mismanaging

88
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:02,480
things, the way that like, the way this whole app situation worked out, the way that people are

89
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:08,720
bitterly divided on social media, it was between Elizabeth Warren and Bernie. Now you might be

90
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:13,760
asking, if the DNC was actually going to rig this thing, why would they rig it in favor of

91
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:19,280
Buttigieg? Why wouldn't they rig it in favor of Biden or Warren? Well, on the one hand, if there

92
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:23,760
was an apparatus behind the rigging, it was probably Buttigieg's because he was involved in

93
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:29,440
the shadow app. But more importantly, even though I believe that Buttigieg could beat Trump, I don't

94
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:34,160
think most people do. I don't think the DNC does at all. I think they're still putting all of their

95
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:41,040
hopes on Biden. And maybe the plan is to siphon away momentum and delegates from Bernie to

96
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:47,440
Buttigieg in states where Biden is obviously not going to win, like Iowa. Maybe the plan is that

97
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:52,880
Buttigieg's influence will cancel out Sanders in those states where Biden can't beat him.

98
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:57,920
So after Biden wins big in those states where he probably will win big, then as soon as the

99
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:03,600
Democratic convention happens, Bernie is kind of shuffled to the side because a lot of his momentum

100
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:08,000
was siphoned away by Buttigieg, who himself they don't believe to be viable, which will basically

101
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:13,200
allow Biden to start gobbling up superdelegates. Basically, I expect this sort of thing to happen

102
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:17,680
in every state where Biden can't beat Bernie. Something's going to come along to basically

103
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:22,720
take little chips and pieces out of Bernie's momentum such that Biden can win the long game.

104
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:26,480
Of course, none of this is going to help them beat Trump, but I guess they're going to go as far as

105
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:32,320
they can. And then it was between Joe Biden and Bernie, and now it's between Pete and Bernie.

106
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:37,280
Who knows where this is going to go, but basically there doesn't seem to be any way for the Democrats

107
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:42,000
to congeal behind any kind of candidate anymore. And I think the Iowa caucus kind of shows that.

108
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,000
It shows that they're like a fundamentally divided party. They're at war with themselves more than

109
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,240
they are at war with the Republicans and Trump, despite what some of them might say. And if they

110
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:56,880
were looking to impress an idea that they were in control, sane, rational, electable, if they're

111
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:01,360
looking to give off that impression to the undecided voter, this isn't how you do it.

112
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,200
This is how you do the complete opposite of that.
