Hello my friends, sorry I'm a day late on this, but here I am and we're here talking about the

00:04.800 --> 00:11.600
Iowa caucus results. Now, I've been saving up a lot of my content regarding the Democratic Party

00:11.600 --> 00:17.200
and the Democratic nomination race for basically after Trump wins 2020, because let's be honest,

00:17.200 --> 00:21.200
Trump's probably going to win 2020. Regardless of what you think of him, the Democrats have been in

00:21.200 --> 00:26.640
such a sorry state basically since Trump beat Hillary in 2016. There is no way they're actually

00:26.640 --> 00:31.120
going to unite behind a candidate or field anybody possible of beating Trump at this point.

00:31.120 --> 00:35.680
So I have this script sitting around called the Collapse of the Democratic Party that basically

00:35.680 --> 00:39.680
will be like an hour long deep dive into everything they've done wrong in the past four

00:39.680 --> 00:44.880
years. But then with the aftermath of the Iowa caucus and the trending of the hashtag Mayor Cheat

00:44.880 --> 00:49.600
I knew I had to at least talk about this a little bit. So here's the basic story of the Iowa caucus.

00:49.600 --> 00:55.120
As soon as it became clear that that Bernie was in the lead and that the the media's chosen one,

00:55.120 --> 01:01.040
Joe Biden, was in fourth place, suddenly the preliminary polling stopped. Suddenly CNN stopped

01:01.040 --> 01:05.520
reporting on it. Suddenly the numbers stopped showing up. And this is actually quite irregular

01:05.520 --> 01:10.720
because usually with these kind of races, they keep people updated pretty regularly. You know,

01:10.720 --> 01:15.600
CNN likes those views. They want people tuning in to kind of watch the drama of the race unfold

01:15.600 --> 01:19.520
as the numbers come in and the districts flip between one candidate or another. But as soon

01:19.520 --> 01:24.640
as it became clear that Bernie was the one who was going to win it, suddenly all reporting stops.

01:24.640 --> 01:30.880
And when pressed on this, they said it was for quality control. Who the fuck knows what that

01:30.880 --> 01:36.400
means? But it seems to have something to do with the fact that the DNC was basically testing out

01:36.400 --> 01:41.360
a new app in the Iowa caucus. But of course, because we haven't had enough Saturday morning

01:41.360 --> 01:45.840
cartoon villainy floating around this goddamn election, the app in question was made by a

01:45.840 --> 01:52.560
company called Shadow. Shadow is partially funded by Pete Buttigieg, or as Sticks likes to call him,

01:52.560 --> 01:56.800
Booty Judge, which kind of makes sense considering that he's also gay, but that's neither here nor

01:56.800 --> 02:03.040
there. But the company has ties to Hillary Clinton. It has ties to George Soros. Of course it does.

02:03.040 --> 02:07.680
And as soon as it seems like the anti-establishment candidate in Bernie Sanders is going to win,

02:07.680 --> 02:13.360
suddenly the polls stopped coming in for quality control purposes. Suddenly those reports that did

02:13.360 --> 02:18.000
come in that show Sanders winning, they disappear off the internet. And then before the whole

02:18.000 --> 02:25.040
situation is resolved, Pete Buttigieg declares himself winner on stage. He walks up and he says,

02:25.040 --> 02:29.680
despite there's no official results, he's like, thank you very, thank you very much. I won, I won

02:29.680 --> 02:40.720
Iowa. So we don't know all the results, but we know by the time it's all said and done, Iowa, you have

02:40.720 --> 03:01.440
shocked the nation. Because by all indications, we are going on to New Hampshire victorious.

03:03.840 --> 03:09.440
So of course, hashtags like Mayor Cheat or Pete Cheats started trending with a whole bunch of

03:10.000 --> 03:13.840
various little bits of evidence that just kind of, they don't really show anything on their own,

03:13.840 --> 03:18.080
but they kind of piece together to form this fabric. There are stories of volunteers within

03:18.080 --> 03:24.320
the DNC noticing various inconsistencies that might be proof of Buttigieg cheating, in fact,

03:24.320 --> 03:29.520
outright. There's video of a coin toss since of course, in some smaller precincts, you might

03:29.520 --> 03:33.760
actually have direct ties when there's not that many votes. And generally you decide them by

03:33.840 --> 03:37.200
flipping a coin, where very clearly the guy looks at the coin,

03:37.200 --> 03:42.160
notices what what side it landed on, and then flips it to announce a win for Buttigieg.

03:42.160 --> 04:04.400
Not even the identity politicians are happy because I guess they grabbed the six black

04:04.400 --> 04:09.040
people that happened to be in existence during Buttigieg's speech and put them all in the front

04:09.440 --> 04:13.040
to make him look more inclusive. There actually wasn't that many black people there.

04:13.040 --> 04:18.240
That's me in the front on the right of Buttigieg. I was asked three times to move away from my

04:18.240 --> 04:22.960
friends in order to be placed in pictures. Hashtag tokenism. But of course, for some of these people,

04:22.960 --> 04:27.600
it doesn't matter how hard the DNC fucks them because they will always, always be loyal.

04:28.160 --> 04:34.240
If you are legitimately tweeting the hashtag Mayor Cheat, then you are either a Russian operative,

04:34.240 --> 04:39.520
a GOP operative, or a useful idiot playing right into Trump and Russia's strategy of

04:39.520 --> 04:43.920
dividing the Democratic Party. Any Democrat is a thousand times better than Trump.

04:43.920 --> 04:48.000
Well, maybe it's that the Democratic Party seems to be naturally divided right now.

04:48.000 --> 04:54.720
You moron. Like, you have the neoliberal wing, and then you have the radical activist wing,

04:54.720 --> 05:01.040
with nothing for the actual moderate centrists of the nation to unite behind. I can't prove it yet.

05:01.040 --> 05:07.600
I feel safe in saying that both Bernie 1 and Mayor Cheat are trending because Russian propaganda

05:07.600 --> 05:12.480
accounts are amplifying them. Putin's goal is to divide us. Instead, let's stand together,

05:12.480 --> 05:16.880
elect Democrats, and sanction his ass out of office. A lot of these people who say,

05:16.880 --> 05:22.880
we have to unite behind X. It just so happens that X is their specific political view,

05:22.880 --> 05:26.480
because they have no intention of ever uniting behind anything else,

05:26.480 --> 05:28.800
so they want everyone to just go their way, I guess.

05:29.440 --> 05:34.320
Here's the thing. I'm not a fan of Biden. I'm not a fan of Buttigieg. I'm not even that much

05:34.320 --> 05:39.680
of a fan of Sanders. Sorry. I used to be until he cut out to Hillary in 2016. But anyway,

05:39.680 --> 05:45.680
most campaigns' internal polling makes their campaign candidate look a bit better than the

05:45.680 --> 05:49.920
rest. A bit better than they should be. And that's kind of to be expected. Like,

05:49.920 --> 05:55.280
if Bernie's campaign releases polls, Bernie probably looks better in them than the average.

05:55.280 --> 06:00.560
So there was one point early in the night where when the official Iowa caucus results were not

06:00.560 --> 06:05.440
being posted, Bernie's campaign was posting results showing him with this overwhelming lead.

06:05.440 --> 06:08.320
And I'm not surprised that those weren't completely accurate. Nothing against Bernie,

06:08.320 --> 06:12.800
it's just how these things go. But nonetheless, this is probably the worst case scenario

06:12.800 --> 06:18.800
for the Democrats at this point, because not only is there no one candidate to unite behind

06:18.800 --> 06:25.680
at this point, regardless of who he is, this was so poorly mismanaged. It is a complete shitshow.

06:25.680 --> 06:31.600
And there is no way that the average undecided voter is going to have any kind of faith in the

06:31.600 --> 06:36.720
Democrats after this showing. After all of this shady bullshit, if there's somebody who was on

06:36.720 --> 06:40.240
the fence thinking whether to go right or left this time around, they're probably just going to

06:40.240 --> 06:44.400
say, fuck it, I'll go for Trump. It's the worst case scenario because nobody comes out looking

06:44.400 --> 06:48.800
good. The Bernie bros think that Bernie was robbed yet again. Maybe he was, maybe he wasn't,

06:48.800 --> 06:53.360
who knows. But here's the thing, even if Bernie legitimately lost an election, like was it wasn't

06:53.360 --> 06:58.400
the result of kind of some kind of like 2016 Hillary style backroom deal, but Bernie actually

06:58.400 --> 07:01.840
lost, there's still going to be a bunch of Bernie fans who just don't accept it. You know, they're

07:01.840 --> 07:06.080
gonna be like, oh, it's DNC, it's rigged again. Then you have Elizabeth Warren, who's rather

07:06.080 --> 07:13.040
unlikeable. You have Joe Biden, who seems to have made a new living being one giant fumble.

07:13.040 --> 07:17.120
And now you have Pete Buttigieg. And Pete Buttigieg, he was one of the ones that I

07:17.120 --> 07:22.000
actually thought had a decent chance at beating Trump. For me, there was Kirsten Gillibrand,

07:22.000 --> 07:27.040
there was Tulsi Gabbard, and then there was Pete Buttigieg. Those three probably had the best shot

07:27.040 --> 07:30.960
at beating Trump. Sorry, Yang Gang, I just don't think he was viable. But nonetheless,

07:30.960 --> 07:36.560
those three were always consistently suppressed by the DNC. And maybe it is the case that Pete's

07:36.560 --> 07:43.200
spike is just a natural result of his electability finally bubbling to the surface after, you know,

07:43.200 --> 07:47.680
the nine months of bullshit that have been the Democratic race. But regardless of whether or

07:47.680 --> 07:53.040
not Pete stole the race, or if this is just, you know, a poorly managed situation doesn't look good

07:53.040 --> 07:57.440
on the Democrats. There's no confidence in the party anymore. The way that they're mismanaging

07:57.440 --> 08:02.480
things, the way that like, the way this whole app situation worked out, the way that people are

08:02.720 --> 08:08.720
bitterly divided on social media, it was between Elizabeth Warren and Bernie. Now you might be

08:08.720 --> 08:13.760
asking, if the DNC was actually going to rig this thing, why would they rig it in favor of

08:13.760 --> 08:19.280
Buttigieg? Why wouldn't they rig it in favor of Biden or Warren? Well, on the one hand, if there

08:19.280 --> 08:23.760
was an apparatus behind the rigging, it was probably Buttigieg's because he was involved in

08:23.760 --> 08:29.440
the shadow app. But more importantly, even though I believe that Buttigieg could beat Trump, I don't

08:29.520 --> 08:34.160
think most people do. I don't think the DNC does at all. I think they're still putting all of their

08:34.160 --> 08:41.040
hopes on Biden. And maybe the plan is to siphon away momentum and delegates from Bernie to

08:41.040 --> 08:47.440
Buttigieg in states where Biden is obviously not going to win, like Iowa. Maybe the plan is that

08:47.440 --> 08:52.880
Buttigieg's influence will cancel out Sanders in those states where Biden can't beat him.

08:52.880 --> 08:57.920
So after Biden wins big in those states where he probably will win big, then as soon as the

08:57.920 --> 09:03.600
Democratic convention happens, Bernie is kind of shuffled to the side because a lot of his momentum

09:03.600 --> 09:08.000
was siphoned away by Buttigieg, who himself they don't believe to be viable, which will basically

09:08.000 --> 09:13.200
allow Biden to start gobbling up superdelegates. Basically, I expect this sort of thing to happen

09:13.200 --> 09:17.680
in every state where Biden can't beat Bernie. Something's going to come along to basically

09:17.680 --> 09:22.720
take little chips and pieces out of Bernie's momentum such that Biden can win the long game.

09:22.720 --> 09:26.480
Of course, none of this is going to help them beat Trump, but I guess they're going to go as far as

09:26.480 --> 09:32.320
they can. And then it was between Joe Biden and Bernie, and now it's between Pete and Bernie.

09:32.320 --> 09:37.280
Who knows where this is going to go, but basically there doesn't seem to be any way for the Democrats

09:37.280 --> 09:42.000
to congeal behind any kind of candidate anymore. And I think the Iowa caucus kind of shows that.

09:42.000 --> 09:46.000
It shows that they're like a fundamentally divided party. They're at war with themselves more than

09:46.000 --> 09:50.240
they are at war with the Republicans and Trump, despite what some of them might say. And if they

09:50.240 --> 09:56.880
were looking to impress an idea that they were in control, sane, rational, electable, if they're

09:56.880 --> 10:01.360
looking to give off that impression to the undecided voter, this isn't how you do it.

10:01.360 --> 10:03.200
This is how you do the complete opposite of that.
