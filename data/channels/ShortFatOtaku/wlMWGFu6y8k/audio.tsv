0	4800	Hello my friends, sorry I'm a day late on this, but here I am and we're here talking about the
4800	11600	Iowa caucus results. Now, I've been saving up a lot of my content regarding the Democratic Party
11600	17200	and the Democratic nomination race for basically after Trump wins 2020, because let's be honest,
17200	21200	Trump's probably going to win 2020. Regardless of what you think of him, the Democrats have been in
21200	26640	such a sorry state basically since Trump beat Hillary in 2016. There is no way they're actually
26640	31120	going to unite behind a candidate or field anybody possible of beating Trump at this point.
31120	35680	So I have this script sitting around called the Collapse of the Democratic Party that basically
35680	39680	will be like an hour long deep dive into everything they've done wrong in the past four
39680	44880	years. But then with the aftermath of the Iowa caucus and the trending of the hashtag Mayor Cheat
44880	49600	I knew I had to at least talk about this a little bit. So here's the basic story of the Iowa caucus.
49600	55120	As soon as it became clear that that Bernie was in the lead and that the the media's chosen one,
55120	61040	Joe Biden, was in fourth place, suddenly the preliminary polling stopped. Suddenly CNN stopped
61040	65520	reporting on it. Suddenly the numbers stopped showing up. And this is actually quite irregular
65520	70720	because usually with these kind of races, they keep people updated pretty regularly. You know,
70720	75600	CNN likes those views. They want people tuning in to kind of watch the drama of the race unfold
75600	79520	as the numbers come in and the districts flip between one candidate or another. But as soon
79520	84640	as it became clear that Bernie was the one who was going to win it, suddenly all reporting stops.
84640	90880	And when pressed on this, they said it was for quality control. Who the fuck knows what that
90880	96400	means? But it seems to have something to do with the fact that the DNC was basically testing out
96400	101360	a new app in the Iowa caucus. But of course, because we haven't had enough Saturday morning
101360	105840	cartoon villainy floating around this goddamn election, the app in question was made by a
105840	112560	company called Shadow. Shadow is partially funded by Pete Buttigieg, or as Sticks likes to call him,
112560	116800	Booty Judge, which kind of makes sense considering that he's also gay, but that's neither here nor
116800	123040	there. But the company has ties to Hillary Clinton. It has ties to George Soros. Of course it does.
123040	127680	And as soon as it seems like the anti-establishment candidate in Bernie Sanders is going to win,
127680	133360	suddenly the polls stopped coming in for quality control purposes. Suddenly those reports that did
133360	138000	come in that show Sanders winning, they disappear off the internet. And then before the whole
138000	145040	situation is resolved, Pete Buttigieg declares himself winner on stage. He walks up and he says,
145040	149680	despite there's no official results, he's like, thank you very, thank you very much. I won, I won
149680	160720	Iowa. So we don't know all the results, but we know by the time it's all said and done, Iowa, you have
160720	181440	shocked the nation. Because by all indications, we are going on to New Hampshire victorious.
183840	189440	So of course, hashtags like Mayor Cheat or Pete Cheats started trending with a whole bunch of
190000	193840	various little bits of evidence that just kind of, they don't really show anything on their own,
193840	198080	but they kind of piece together to form this fabric. There are stories of volunteers within
198080	204320	the DNC noticing various inconsistencies that might be proof of Buttigieg cheating, in fact,
204320	209520	outright. There's video of a coin toss since of course, in some smaller precincts, you might
209520	213760	actually have direct ties when there's not that many votes. And generally you decide them by
213840	217200	flipping a coin, where very clearly the guy looks at the coin,
217200	222160	notices what what side it landed on, and then flips it to announce a win for Buttigieg.
222160	244400	Not even the identity politicians are happy because I guess they grabbed the six black
244400	249040	people that happened to be in existence during Buttigieg's speech and put them all in the front
249440	253040	to make him look more inclusive. There actually wasn't that many black people there.
253040	258240	That's me in the front on the right of Buttigieg. I was asked three times to move away from my
258240	262960	friends in order to be placed in pictures. Hashtag tokenism. But of course, for some of these people,
262960	267600	it doesn't matter how hard the DNC fucks them because they will always, always be loyal.
268160	274240	If you are legitimately tweeting the hashtag Mayor Cheat, then you are either a Russian operative,
274240	279520	a GOP operative, or a useful idiot playing right into Trump and Russia's strategy of
279520	283920	dividing the Democratic Party. Any Democrat is a thousand times better than Trump.
283920	288000	Well, maybe it's that the Democratic Party seems to be naturally divided right now.
288000	294720	You moron. Like, you have the neoliberal wing, and then you have the radical activist wing,
294720	301040	with nothing for the actual moderate centrists of the nation to unite behind. I can't prove it yet.
301040	307600	I feel safe in saying that both Bernie 1 and Mayor Cheat are trending because Russian propaganda
307600	312480	accounts are amplifying them. Putin's goal is to divide us. Instead, let's stand together,
312480	316880	elect Democrats, and sanction his ass out of office. A lot of these people who say,
316880	322880	we have to unite behind X. It just so happens that X is their specific political view,
322880	326480	because they have no intention of ever uniting behind anything else,
326480	328800	so they want everyone to just go their way, I guess.
329440	334320	Here's the thing. I'm not a fan of Biden. I'm not a fan of Buttigieg. I'm not even that much
334320	339680	of a fan of Sanders. Sorry. I used to be until he cut out to Hillary in 2016. But anyway,
339680	345680	most campaigns' internal polling makes their campaign candidate look a bit better than the
345680	349920	rest. A bit better than they should be. And that's kind of to be expected. Like,
349920	355280	if Bernie's campaign releases polls, Bernie probably looks better in them than the average.
355280	360560	So there was one point early in the night where when the official Iowa caucus results were not
360560	365440	being posted, Bernie's campaign was posting results showing him with this overwhelming lead.
365440	368320	And I'm not surprised that those weren't completely accurate. Nothing against Bernie,
368320	372800	it's just how these things go. But nonetheless, this is probably the worst case scenario
372800	378800	for the Democrats at this point, because not only is there no one candidate to unite behind
378800	385680	at this point, regardless of who he is, this was so poorly mismanaged. It is a complete shitshow.
385680	391600	And there is no way that the average undecided voter is going to have any kind of faith in the
391600	396720	Democrats after this showing. After all of this shady bullshit, if there's somebody who was on
396720	400240	the fence thinking whether to go right or left this time around, they're probably just going to
400240	404400	say, fuck it, I'll go for Trump. It's the worst case scenario because nobody comes out looking
404400	408800	good. The Bernie bros think that Bernie was robbed yet again. Maybe he was, maybe he wasn't,
408800	413360	who knows. But here's the thing, even if Bernie legitimately lost an election, like was it wasn't
413360	418400	the result of kind of some kind of like 2016 Hillary style backroom deal, but Bernie actually
418400	421840	lost, there's still going to be a bunch of Bernie fans who just don't accept it. You know, they're
421840	426080	gonna be like, oh, it's DNC, it's rigged again. Then you have Elizabeth Warren, who's rather
426080	433040	unlikeable. You have Joe Biden, who seems to have made a new living being one giant fumble.
433040	437120	And now you have Pete Buttigieg. And Pete Buttigieg, he was one of the ones that I
437120	442000	actually thought had a decent chance at beating Trump. For me, there was Kirsten Gillibrand,
442000	447040	there was Tulsi Gabbard, and then there was Pete Buttigieg. Those three probably had the best shot
447040	450960	at beating Trump. Sorry, Yang Gang, I just don't think he was viable. But nonetheless,
450960	456560	those three were always consistently suppressed by the DNC. And maybe it is the case that Pete's
456560	463200	spike is just a natural result of his electability finally bubbling to the surface after, you know,
463200	467680	the nine months of bullshit that have been the Democratic race. But regardless of whether or
467680	473040	not Pete stole the race, or if this is just, you know, a poorly managed situation doesn't look good
473040	477440	on the Democrats. There's no confidence in the party anymore. The way that they're mismanaging
477440	482480	things, the way that like, the way this whole app situation worked out, the way that people are
482720	488720	bitterly divided on social media, it was between Elizabeth Warren and Bernie. Now you might be
488720	493760	asking, if the DNC was actually going to rig this thing, why would they rig it in favor of
493760	499280	Buttigieg? Why wouldn't they rig it in favor of Biden or Warren? Well, on the one hand, if there
499280	503760	was an apparatus behind the rigging, it was probably Buttigieg's because he was involved in
503760	509440	the shadow app. But more importantly, even though I believe that Buttigieg could beat Trump, I don't
509520	514160	think most people do. I don't think the DNC does at all. I think they're still putting all of their
514160	521040	hopes on Biden. And maybe the plan is to siphon away momentum and delegates from Bernie to
521040	527440	Buttigieg in states where Biden is obviously not going to win, like Iowa. Maybe the plan is that
527440	532880	Buttigieg's influence will cancel out Sanders in those states where Biden can't beat him.
532880	537920	So after Biden wins big in those states where he probably will win big, then as soon as the
537920	543600	Democratic convention happens, Bernie is kind of shuffled to the side because a lot of his momentum
543600	548000	was siphoned away by Buttigieg, who himself they don't believe to be viable, which will basically
548000	553200	allow Biden to start gobbling up superdelegates. Basically, I expect this sort of thing to happen
553200	557680	in every state where Biden can't beat Bernie. Something's going to come along to basically
557680	562720	take little chips and pieces out of Bernie's momentum such that Biden can win the long game.
562720	566480	Of course, none of this is going to help them beat Trump, but I guess they're going to go as far as
566480	572320	they can. And then it was between Joe Biden and Bernie, and now it's between Pete and Bernie.
572320	577280	Who knows where this is going to go, but basically there doesn't seem to be any way for the Democrats
577280	582000	to congeal behind any kind of candidate anymore. And I think the Iowa caucus kind of shows that.
582000	586000	It shows that they're like a fundamentally divided party. They're at war with themselves more than
586000	590240	they are at war with the Republicans and Trump, despite what some of them might say. And if they
590240	596880	were looking to impress an idea that they were in control, sane, rational, electable, if they're
596880	601360	looking to give off that impression to the undecided voter, this isn't how you do it.
601360	603200	This is how you do the complete opposite of that.
