00:00.000 --> 00:15.640
Well, shit. I guess I better do my part. Wait, why is Bieber on here?

00:15.640 --> 00:21.320
In early 2017, PewDiePie paid two strangers through a service called Fiverr to hold up

00:21.320 --> 00:24.760
a sign that said death to all Jews as an obvious joke.

00:24.760 --> 00:32.480
Here we go. Sign to behold. Death to all-

Tell us how to pronounce your given message. Sub-scra-ab-to-keen-star-star.

00:49.480 --> 01:06.520
Guys, please, deliver. The fuck is this? I paid for this?

01:06.520 --> 01:16.980
What? What's with the Christmas- I like the editing.

01:16.980 --> 01:29.100
Subscribe to Keemstar. In response, the Wall Street Journal slandered

01:29.100 --> 01:33.780
him as an anti-Semite, and spent hundreds of hours watching his backlog to try and find

01:33.780 --> 01:36.620
other jokes that they could twist to support their position.

01:36.620 --> 01:42.180
As a result, PewDiePie lost a deal with Disney. Later that year, PewDiePie said nigger on

01:42.180 --> 02:10.140
a livestream, out of anger at the game he was playing.

02:10.140 --> 02:32.900
Even after apologizing, the mainstream media again jumped down his throat. In both instances,

02:32.900 --> 02:37.260
the media showed a distinct lack of interest in giving him the benefit of the doubt.

02:37.260 --> 02:49.220
On The Guardian, Cheloraminon wrote,

02:49.220 --> 02:53.860
Commonly known as PewDiePie, the vlogger called another player a fucking nigger during a live

02:53.860 --> 02:59.380
video stream. Taking too long to realize his mistake, he qualified the racist slur with

02:59.380 --> 03:04.100
I don't mean it in a bad way, and laughed it off. Listen to how that is written. Taking

03:04.100 --> 03:08.980
too long to realize his mistake, that's where we're at guys. Recognizing and understanding

03:08.980 --> 03:12.620
that you fucked up just doesn't count if you took an extra second or two too long to

03:12.620 --> 03:18.820
do it, according to social justice sensibilities. It was literally three seconds, and that's

03:18.820 --> 03:22.200
too long apparently. Despite the public outcry, many people are

03:22.200 --> 03:27.860
coming to Kellberg's defense, some using the hashtag PewDiePie did nothing wrong. Dismissing

03:27.860 --> 03:33.540
the event as a crime of gaming passion, this ignores his influence and sends a clear message

03:33.540 --> 03:37.660
that it's okay to be racist in the gaming community. Maybe I'm in the minority opinion

03:37.660 --> 03:42.420
on this, but I don't think PewDiePie has an imperative to consider his influence. Charles

03:42.420 --> 03:47.420
Barkley publicly stated that he's not a role model, but a basketball player, and that there

03:47.420 --> 03:54.420
was no moral impetus for him not to behave the way he wanted to behave.

04:17.420 --> 04:24.420
Moreover, I know what's really meant by ignoring his influence. Whenever progressives see a

04:26.260 --> 04:30.640
platform that somebody else built, they try to worm their way in, either by converting

04:30.640 --> 04:35.420
the people on the platform to their politics, or smuggling a person inside in order to co-opt

04:35.420 --> 04:39.980
it for their own use. It happened to Cracked, it happened to The Onion, it happened to every

04:39.980 --> 04:44.260
major tech giant out there, it happened to pretty much every video game developer, both

04:44.260 --> 04:50.420
AAA and Indie, it happened to books, comics, Hollywood TV, you name it. But because YouTube

04:50.420 --> 04:54.480
channels are generally centered around one guy, they've proven to be exceptionally

04:54.480 --> 04:58.060
resilient to this type of takeover. This is why there's been a flood of articles for

04:58.060 --> 05:02.900
the past five years talking about how racist YouTubers are, when the truth is, most of

05:02.900 --> 05:08.160
them are just inoculated against this specific type of bullshit. Casual use of racial slurs

05:08.160 --> 05:12.140
needs to be condemned wholeheartedly every single time. There is never a good reason

05:12.180 --> 05:16.400
to use the language displayed in this video. So by their own admission, this isn't even

05:16.400 --> 05:20.620
about PewDiePie actually being a racist, it's about his language. As these people might

05:20.620 --> 05:25.300
say in a different situation, it's about tone policing. Let's be honest here, if

05:25.300 --> 05:30.100
you actually think Pewds is a racist, you're either an idiot, or you're pushing an agenda.

05:30.100 --> 05:35.200
When people are frustrated, they say things out of that frustration. It's unreasonable

05:35.200 --> 05:40.360
to infer people's actual beliefs from those outbursts. In fact, social justice warriors

05:40.360 --> 05:46.320
routinely use but they were frustrated as an excuse to spew hate, like when The Guardian's

05:46.320 --> 05:50.860
Nasreen Malik said that actually punching your political opponents was justified because

05:50.860 --> 05:53.260
it was a form of racial catharsis.

05:53.260 --> 05:57.500
When Richard Spencer was punched while giving an interview in the street, it was a cathartic

05:57.500 --> 06:03.220
moment for many. A lot of us find ourselves at a loss for how to respond as frightening

06:03.220 --> 06:09.580
and dangerous views are suddenly not only being aired, but mainstreamed. Unable to adjust,

06:09.580 --> 06:14.400
we continue to engage with these views like they were just a new school of controversy.

06:14.400 --> 06:20.200
The world had changed, but we hadn't caught up. That punch? It caught us up. The punch

06:20.200 --> 06:25.960
was a calling out after a time when too many things were not called out for what they really

06:25.960 --> 06:31.800
are. Going high might make us feel good about being the better party, but it is not a suitable

06:31.800 --> 06:32.800
response.

06:32.800 --> 06:38.040
Hell, when Sarah Jong spouted her own racist, vile garbage, she wasn't even doing it

06:38.040 --> 06:43.420
out of frustration, but apparently that was okay. But as usual, it's no bad tactics,

06:43.420 --> 06:48.220
only bad targets. Pewdiepie's jokes are to be taken as legitimate antisemitism, but

06:48.220 --> 06:53.740
when the radicals on the left, like say in Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party or entire wings

06:53.740 --> 06:59.420
of Black Lives Matter and the Women's Marches legitimately hate Jews, it's just no big

06:59.420 --> 07:03.040
deal. One set of rules for me and another for thee, after all.

07:03.040 --> 07:08.260
My point is, the mainstream media has used every single possible opportunity, every method

07:08.260 --> 07:14.020
of attack it could find, to try and damage Pewdiepie, and as time has gone on, SJWs have

07:14.020 --> 07:19.420
begun to aid them in their efforts. For example, Aja Romano wastes no time writing a banal

07:19.420 --> 07:24.860
hit piece on Vox whenever Pewdiepie sneezes. She's there every time to lick up the snot.

07:24.860 --> 07:26.540
Romano later tweeted,

07:33.040 --> 07:38.320
Jesus Christ, she makes it sound like she's an actual reporter photographing naked Vietnamese

07:38.320 --> 07:42.780
kids running away from a battle or something. You shit talked a huge personality with no

07:42.780 --> 07:48.020
evidence to back you up. What did you expect his fans to do? Here's Diana, an SJW working

07:48.020 --> 07:53.300
for Ubisoft, requesting that the gaming industry end Pewdiepie. It doesn't matter that Pewdiepie

07:53.300 --> 07:57.820
has one of the biggest platforms in the world, and that if gaming companies cut ties with

07:57.820 --> 08:02.380
him, they would likely suffer financial losses. He has the wrong opinions, goddammit. And

08:02.380 --> 08:07.080
what's worse, he doesn't have the proper social justice wrong opinion exemption clearance

08:07.080 --> 08:12.240
like Jong and Malik and Romano do. By the way, Diana had to private her account after

08:12.240 --> 08:16.680
making this tweet. It turns out that baselessly shitting on somebody with a massive audience

08:16.680 --> 08:20.760
is not a smart move. A lesson that Wired also had to learn the hard way.

08:20.760 --> 08:24.800
Oopsie doopsie, turns out it's harder to cyber smear someone when their audience dwarfs

08:24.800 --> 08:28.380
yours. The internet was a mistake. We need to go back to the days where we could smear

08:28.380 --> 08:32.360
somebody and they couldn't fight back outside of a court of law. With the way things are,

08:32.360 --> 08:35.940
anyone can just point out our lies to millions of people. We're powerless.

08:35.940 --> 08:40.340
Okay, that's obviously a joke article. It was edited from inside the printer hacking

08:40.340 --> 08:45.700
army spreading Pewdiepie propaganda. But it's still pretty funny. And honestly, pretty true,

08:45.700 --> 08:50.180
considering that the actual Wired article also tries to slander Pewds as a racist. But

08:50.180 --> 08:55.460
the article's main point is to describe an event where fans of Pewdiepie hacked 80,000

08:55.460 --> 09:00.260
printers to print off messages advertising readers to subscribe to Pewdiepie and, although

09:00.260 --> 09:04.080
we took the long way to get here, we're finally at the question I pose at the beginning

09:04.080 --> 09:08.660
of this video. Why subscribe to Pewdiepie? The short version of the story is, Pewdiepie

09:08.660 --> 09:13.740
has been the top dog since 2013, but T-Series has come close multiple times to dethroning

09:13.740 --> 09:18.520
him for the most subscribed YouTube channel. T-Series is a success story in its own right.

09:18.520 --> 09:22.120
The owner was a poor fisherman from India who decided one day to make a channel where

09:22.120 --> 09:26.600
he could post music. And as more and more people in India got hooked up to the internet,

09:26.600 --> 09:31.260
T-Series began to blow up due to that alone. T-Series also gets more hits than Pewdiepie

09:31.260 --> 09:36.340
per day by a full order of magnitude due solely to the fact that most of its content is music

09:36.340 --> 09:41.060
and therefore will be replayed many times by its sub-base. And you know, good on T-Series

09:41.060 --> 09:45.280
for being successful. Good on the fisherman for building his own company. But it is a

09:45.280 --> 09:50.260
faceless company in the end, isn't it? Pewdiepie is as much the man as it is the brand. He

09:50.260 --> 09:55.020
may have an office space, he may employ people, but you can't just replace the man behind

09:55.020 --> 09:59.020
the brand. In my opinion, Game Grumps is a good example of what happens to a brand

09:59.020 --> 10:03.760
when you do replace the man behind it. Grumps had soul when it was Aaron and John, and even

10:03.760 --> 10:07.860
though it's wildly more successful now than it's ever been, Aaron and Dan have never

10:07.860 --> 10:11.840
been able to replicate the friendly rivalry that made the channel initially go viral.

10:11.840 --> 10:16.840
The history of Grumps is basically what happens when you let Pewdiepie transform into T-Series,

10:16.840 --> 10:21.400
strangely enough. But YouTube has always been about these solo guys, where the name of their

10:21.400 --> 10:24.540
person, the name of their channel, and the name of their show were always one and the

10:24.540 --> 10:28.960
same. The Angry Video Game nerd started that trend, and was number one in his own right

10:28.960 --> 10:34.140
during YouTube's early days. Spoonie, while he was relevant, was the same type of creator.

10:34.140 --> 10:39.340
JonTron is another massive example. From Sargon to Oni, from Maryland to Scooby, from the

10:39.340 --> 10:44.140
early days right up to the present day, YouTube culture has always revolved around YouTubers.

10:44.140 --> 10:49.380
Not so much channels or brands. It's YouTubers that go viral. It's channels and brands

10:49.380 --> 10:54.760
that get pushed by the algorithms, get shuffled around randomly on the homepage, and get undeserved

10:54.760 --> 10:59.320
spots on the trending list. I do think Jack Black's new channel is funny, but why do

10:59.320 --> 11:04.000
his videos consistently beat out Pewdiepie's to the official trending list, despite fewer

11:04.000 --> 11:09.060
subs, fewer hits, fewer comments and votes, and an overall slower rate of growth? Is it

11:09.060 --> 11:15.260
because Jack Black's a safe celebrity, and Pewdiepie's an unsafe YouTuber? Probably.

11:15.260 --> 11:20.240
But that's why people like YouTubers. Regardless of their quality, their consistency, their

11:20.240 --> 11:25.200
video style, their genre or their interests, regardless of anything else, their channels

11:25.200 --> 11:29.700
are as much about them as they are about what they produce. When the channel blows up, we

11:29.700 --> 11:33.560
can see it's because of their work. When a channel stops putting out videos, we can see

11:33.560 --> 11:37.640
it's because they're lazy. But it's always about the person behind the channel. And sometimes

11:37.640 --> 11:42.860
it is more than one person. Hell, my channel started with two people in 2009, and neither

11:42.860 --> 11:47.180
of them were me. But it's still people with faces that you can point to, for better or

11:47.180 --> 11:51.420
worse, and say that they are the channel. This can't be done with T-Series. And this

11:51.420 --> 11:56.240
can't be done with a lot of other YouTube-approved channels. And that's why the sub-battle between

11:56.240 --> 12:00.300
Pewdiepie and T-Series has become a battle for the soul of the internet. Pewdiepie is

12:00.300 --> 12:04.380
the single guy that is the face of his operation. The independent fellow who isn't afraid to

12:04.380 --> 12:09.240
give his honest opinion on any topic. He's the actual YouTuber. T-Series is the corporation

12:09.240 --> 12:15.920
without a face. The formulaic, safe, algorithm-friendly content churned out regularly. The TV-style

12:15.920 --> 12:21.400
channel. To be honest, a few years ago, it would have been the Fine Bros React brand,

12:21.400 --> 12:25.480
or Smosh or something, that probably would have exemplified this role. But most importantly

12:25.480 --> 12:30.160
of all, Pewdiepie is what YouTube started as, what YouTube has always done best, and

12:30.160 --> 12:36.160
what YouTube's user base wants it to be. Creator-focused, independent, uncontrollable by the media,

12:36.160 --> 12:41.280
and ultimately, honest. T-Series is what the media wants YouTube to be, what investors

12:41.280 --> 12:46.880
want YouTube to be, and frankly, what YouTube now wants YouTube to be. Brand-focused, safe,

12:46.880 --> 12:52.920
marketable, accountable to censors. YouTube wants to be the new cable TV. They would reorganize

12:52.920 --> 12:57.760
everybody's feeds to be a curated selection of pre-approved channels only if it wouldn't

12:57.760 --> 13:02.880
instantly kill their site. The immense negative reaction to YouTube Rewind is a great example

13:02.880 --> 13:07.680
of this. What did that piece of shit have? Celebrities who have nothing to do with YouTube

13:07.680 --> 13:11.840
or its culture. Small-time YouTube names that promote the proper politics and suck the right

13:11.840 --> 13:18.140
dicks. Safe, pre-packaged, freeze-dried, plastic-wrapped YouTubers that were hand-picked and pushed

13:18.140 --> 13:23.560
by YouTube because the content they shit out is utterly meaningless. And as a result, YouTube

13:23.560 --> 13:28.360
Rewind became the most downvoted video in YouTube history. And, like the social justice

13:28.360 --> 13:33.620
warriors from earlier, YouTube asymmetrically enforces its own rules. Mumkey Jones got banned

13:33.620 --> 13:38.520
for old jokes, not because of the jokes themselves, but because he's too small to cause a serious

13:38.520 --> 13:43.100
uproar. Sargon got a strike on a video from years ago because the rules have changed and

13:43.100 --> 13:48.100
are retroactively applied, at least to some of us. But Logan Paul can show a dead body

13:48.100 --> 13:52.480
on YouTube and nobody really cares in their offices. YouTube only gave him a tepid slap

13:52.480 --> 13:57.600
on the wrist after the entire internet made an uproar about it because YouTube has pre-approved

13:57.600 --> 14:02.460
Logan Paul as a safe bet, regardless of what he actually puts in his videos. But PewDiePie's

14:02.460 --> 14:07.060
a shitlord through and through. He's not a safe bet. And in spite of that, he's still

14:07.060 --> 14:11.960
too big for YouTube to touch, not if they want to wreck their own platform. Though frankly,

14:11.960 --> 14:16.460
calling them a platform at this point is inaccurate. In an interview, Bill Gates compared Windows

14:16.460 --> 14:20.800
to Facebook, refusing to call the latter a platform. That's a crock of shit. This isn't

14:20.800 --> 14:25.160
a platform. A platform is when the economic value of everybody that uses it exceeds the

14:25.160 --> 14:29.440
value of the company that created it. Then it's a platform. Gates correctly identified

14:29.440 --> 14:33.960
Windows as a platform because it was a portal through which a near infinite number of actions

14:33.960 --> 14:37.940
could be performed on a PC. Windows doesn't take a cut of the stream that you do, the

14:37.940 --> 14:42.580
image you draw, the video you edit, the book you write, or the business you perform, just

14:42.580 --> 14:47.540
because your PC is running Windows. But that's exactly what YouTube does. And it's even worse

14:47.540 --> 14:52.520
for Facebook or Twitter, where it's the users that are the product. These things aren't

14:52.520 --> 14:57.460
platforms. A platform is an avenue through which content is created, not an avenue through

14:57.460 --> 15:03.460
which content is controlled. YouTube, as well as the rest of social media, is far more centralized

15:03.460 --> 15:08.340
than a platform. And I think that's the ultimate problem here. Centralized control. That's

15:08.340 --> 15:13.520
where Gamergate came from, and ComiXgate after it. That's why Trump and Brexit happened.

15:13.520 --> 15:17.860
That's why everybody hates Facebook and Twitter and YouTube and Reddit. The internet began

15:17.860 --> 15:22.600
as a decentralized mess. But it was free. The internet's no longer decentralized, and

15:22.600 --> 15:27.220
we've been watching the freedom slowly disappear into the black hole of terms and conditions.

15:27.220 --> 15:30.440
Remember when content creators had their own websites where they would embed videos and

15:30.440 --> 15:35.400
shit? Now everything's a subreddit or a Facebook fan page. And now those communities don't

15:35.400 --> 15:39.980
get to decide the rules for themselves appropriate to that community. Everybody follows Facebook's

15:39.980 --> 15:45.160
rules or Reddit's rules or Twitter's or Discord's or YouTube's. And these companies have begun

15:45.160 --> 15:48.120
to weaponize that power against their user base.

15:48.120 --> 15:53.140
Gamergate didn't cause Trump or Brexit, as the progressives widely believe. Rather, Gamergate,

15:53.140 --> 15:57.260
Trump and Brexit all had a common starting point that they split off from. The desire

15:57.260 --> 16:02.280
to be free from an ever-centralizing control structure, which has become entirely detached

16:02.280 --> 16:06.900
from the interests of common people. Whether you're talking about career politicians, YouTube's

16:06.900 --> 16:12.180
customer service, or the attitude of snooty journos, detached really is the perfect word.

16:12.180 --> 16:15.260
Detached from accountability, morality, and sensibility.

16:15.260 --> 16:20.200
This is why subscribing to PewDiePie is important. Not because PewDiePie himself is solely keeping

16:20.200 --> 16:24.340
the forces of YouTube autocracy at bay, but because the internet tilts a little bit more

16:24.340 --> 16:28.780
away from freedom every time a social media company centralizes its power. Every time

16:28.780 --> 16:33.700
a new bit of speech previously considered fine is censored. Every time a corporate TV

16:33.700 --> 16:38.860
style channel is favored over a YouTuber. But this dream of centralized control, that's

16:38.860 --> 16:44.200
the wet dream of the SJWs and the mainstream media barons. It really is a strange union.

16:44.200 --> 16:49.020
The socialist advocates siding with the modern day robber barons against the common person.

16:49.020 --> 16:52.920
That's why the two big stories recently, The Mega Kids and Learn to Code, both blew

16:52.920 --> 16:57.220
up as rapidly as they did. They were both textbook examples of progressives in power

16:57.220 --> 17:01.660
grossly abusing that power, getting caught with their pants down, and filthy unwashed

17:01.660 --> 17:05.500
commoners on the internet having the gall to laugh at their expense. That's why every

17:05.500 --> 17:09.920
time somebody from outside the Overton window, somebody that SJWs and the progressive media

17:09.920 --> 17:15.660
have already tried to spin a narrative on, like Elon Musk, Ben Shapiro, Sargon, or UKIP,

17:15.660 --> 17:20.220
mentions or is mentioned by PewDiePie, it turns into a huge crisis. Oh no, PewDiePie

17:20.220 --> 17:24.740
is corrupting the youth, a short clip of Baked Alaska was on the channel, this is terrible,

17:24.740 --> 17:30.540
he's humanizing Ben Shapiro. Do you people even listen to yourselves? That's why the

17:30.540 --> 17:35.820
joke Wired article was so on point, it reveals exactly how they think. That's why social

17:35.820 --> 17:40.100
justicey teachers are wasting valuable time in class telling their students about how

17:40.100 --> 17:44.400
Gamergate is a hate group, how Pepe is a symbol of white supremacy, and how supporting

17:45.400 --> 17:51.600
And by every time you retweet one of these things, or every time you promote this idea,

17:51.600 --> 18:00.120
you are promoting ignorance, racism, genocide, antisemitism, these are all things that you

18:00.120 --> 18:05.960
are putting forward when you are doing anything that promotes PewDiePie. So be careful about

18:05.960 --> 18:10.080
this. If someone decided to, if something were to happen, if PewDiePie were to be sued

18:10.080 --> 18:14.680
for this, you could be complicit. If you retweet it, they could make you pay a fine

18:14.680 --> 18:21.200
as well, because you have officially published antisemitic things. So if you are republishing

18:21.200 --> 18:25.960
this stuff, you could get in trouble for it. Be very aware that that is a real thing.

18:25.960 --> 18:30.760
And that's why, despite all these efforts from the top, the regular people, the plebs,

18:30.760 --> 18:35.080
aren't having any of it. When the people in power write articles, we buy billboards. When

18:35.080 --> 18:39.080
the people in power demand the obedience of their students, we wear shirts at the Super

18:39.080 --> 18:43.800
Bowl. When the people in power use their large platforms to shame their users, we use

18:43.800 --> 18:48.520
our small platforms to voice our objection. And thankfully, YouTube is not so far gone

18:48.520 --> 18:52.660
yet that our small platforms are doomed to be small forever. We can still grow with enough

18:52.660 --> 18:58.240
hard work. That fact is the only appeal YouTube has left. And YouTube is desperately looking

18:58.240 --> 19:03.760
for a way to keep its fan base while simultaneously stripping away that final perk. The chance

19:03.760 --> 19:08.900
that a pleb might get big one day. It's Wojcicki's wet dream, but we need to ensure that it remains

19:08.900 --> 19:13.220
impossible. And if they actually do it, we need to ensure we have another platform we

19:13.220 --> 19:17.860
can thrive on. When I said this was a war for YouTube's soul, I meant it. This is a war

19:17.860 --> 19:23.680
between what YouTube naturally is and what moneyed interests want YouTube to be. This

19:23.680 --> 19:30.140
is a war between both YouTubers and viewers and YouTube itself. And it's not one that

19:30.140 --> 19:34.560
we started. Every time YouTube tweaks the algorithm so that you're less likely to see

19:34.560 --> 19:39.580
content that you want because they deem it to be unsafe. Every time YouTube shuffles

19:39.580 --> 19:43.840
the front page showing you a bunch of shit you don't really care about because that's

19:43.840 --> 19:49.360
what they want you to watch. Every time YouTube curates another part of its service, that

19:49.360 --> 19:54.320
is YouTube going to war with its own users. This video has become a bit of a ramble, but

19:54.320 --> 19:58.120
it's a topic that's close to my heart as a YouTuber myself. And I have a feeling that

19:58.120 --> 20:02.920
a lot of YouTubers and probably a good chunk of viewers agree with me on this. Subscribing

20:02.920 --> 20:07.340
to PewDiePie isn't really about subscribing to PewDiePie. It's about reaffirming the supremacy

20:07.340 --> 20:11.960
of the individual over the corporation. Of freedom of choice over algorithmic decision

20:11.960 --> 20:17.100
making. Of creativity and love over pre-approved safety. If that means that I get slandered

20:17.100 --> 20:24.240
as alt-right or a Nazi or a racist or whatever, fine. Before all else comes freedom.

20:24.240 --> 20:28.360
Thank you for watching guys. If you're here during the premiere, drop by my gaming channel

20:28.360 --> 20:34.240
at twitch.tv slash game boomers at 7pm EST, about 3 hours and change from now. I'm going

20:34.240 --> 20:37.320
to be attempting the path of pain in Hollow Knight, and if you're watching some time

20:37.320 --> 20:40.880
in the future, drop by anyway. I stream 5 nights a week, I'll probably be playing

20:40.880 --> 20:44.200
something. I'm outta here my friends. Remember, I love you.
