0	15640	Well, shit. I guess I better do my part. Wait, why is Bieber on here?
15640	21320	In early 2017, PewDiePie paid two strangers through a service called Fiverr to hold up
21320	24760	a sign that said death to all Jews as an obvious joke.
24760	32480	Here we go. Sign to behold. Death to all-
32480	49480	Tell us how to pronounce your given message. Sub-scra-ab-to-keen-star-star.
49480	66520	Guys, please, deliver. The fuck is this? I paid for this?
66520	76980	What? What's with the Christmas- I like the editing.
76980	89100	Subscribe to Keemstar. In response, the Wall Street Journal slandered
89100	93780	him as an anti-Semite, and spent hundreds of hours watching his backlog to try and find
93780	96620	other jokes that they could twist to support their position.
96620	102180	As a result, PewDiePie lost a deal with Disney. Later that year, PewDiePie said nigger on
102180	130140	a livestream, out of anger at the game he was playing.
130140	152900	Even after apologizing, the mainstream media again jumped down his throat. In both instances,
152900	157260	the media showed a distinct lack of interest in giving him the benefit of the doubt.
157260	169220	On The Guardian, Cheloraminon wrote,
169220	173860	Commonly known as PewDiePie, the vlogger called another player a fucking nigger during a live
173860	179380	video stream. Taking too long to realize his mistake, he qualified the racist slur with
179380	184100	I don't mean it in a bad way, and laughed it off. Listen to how that is written. Taking
184100	188980	too long to realize his mistake, that's where we're at guys. Recognizing and understanding
188980	192620	that you fucked up just doesn't count if you took an extra second or two too long to
192620	198820	do it, according to social justice sensibilities. It was literally three seconds, and that's
198820	202200	too long apparently. Despite the public outcry, many people are
202200	207860	coming to Kellberg's defense, some using the hashtag PewDiePie did nothing wrong. Dismissing
207860	213540	the event as a crime of gaming passion, this ignores his influence and sends a clear message
213540	217660	that it's okay to be racist in the gaming community. Maybe I'm in the minority opinion
217660	222420	on this, but I don't think PewDiePie has an imperative to consider his influence. Charles
222420	227420	Barkley publicly stated that he's not a role model, but a basketball player, and that there
227420	234420	was no moral impetus for him not to behave the way he wanted to behave.
257420	264420	Moreover, I know what's really meant by ignoring his influence. Whenever progressives see a
266260	270640	platform that somebody else built, they try to worm their way in, either by converting
270640	275420	the people on the platform to their politics, or smuggling a person inside in order to co-opt
275420	279980	it for their own use. It happened to Cracked, it happened to The Onion, it happened to every
279980	284260	major tech giant out there, it happened to pretty much every video game developer, both
284260	290420	AAA and Indie, it happened to books, comics, Hollywood TV, you name it. But because YouTube
290420	294480	channels are generally centered around one guy, they've proven to be exceptionally
294480	298060	resilient to this type of takeover. This is why there's been a flood of articles for
298060	302900	the past five years talking about how racist YouTubers are, when the truth is, most of
302900	308160	them are just inoculated against this specific type of bullshit. Casual use of racial slurs
308160	312140	needs to be condemned wholeheartedly every single time. There is never a good reason
312180	316400	to use the language displayed in this video. So by their own admission, this isn't even
316400	320620	about PewDiePie actually being a racist, it's about his language. As these people might
320620	325300	say in a different situation, it's about tone policing. Let's be honest here, if
325300	330100	you actually think Pewds is a racist, you're either an idiot, or you're pushing an agenda.
330100	335200	When people are frustrated, they say things out of that frustration. It's unreasonable
335200	340360	to infer people's actual beliefs from those outbursts. In fact, social justice warriors
340360	346320	routinely use but they were frustrated as an excuse to spew hate, like when The Guardian's
346320	350860	Nasreen Malik said that actually punching your political opponents was justified because
350860	353260	it was a form of racial catharsis.
353260	357500	When Richard Spencer was punched while giving an interview in the street, it was a cathartic
357500	363220	moment for many. A lot of us find ourselves at a loss for how to respond as frightening
363220	369580	and dangerous views are suddenly not only being aired, but mainstreamed. Unable to adjust,
369580	374400	we continue to engage with these views like they were just a new school of controversy.
374400	380200	The world had changed, but we hadn't caught up. That punch? It caught us up. The punch
380200	385960	was a calling out after a time when too many things were not called out for what they really
385960	391800	are. Going high might make us feel good about being the better party, but it is not a suitable
391800	392800	response.
392800	398040	Hell, when Sarah Jong spouted her own racist, vile garbage, she wasn't even doing it
398040	403420	out of frustration, but apparently that was okay. But as usual, it's no bad tactics,
403420	408220	only bad targets. Pewdiepie's jokes are to be taken as legitimate antisemitism, but
408220	413740	when the radicals on the left, like say in Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party or entire wings
413740	419420	of Black Lives Matter and the Women's Marches legitimately hate Jews, it's just no big
419420	423040	deal. One set of rules for me and another for thee, after all.
423040	428260	My point is, the mainstream media has used every single possible opportunity, every method
428260	434020	of attack it could find, to try and damage Pewdiepie, and as time has gone on, SJWs have
434020	439420	begun to aid them in their efforts. For example, Aja Romano wastes no time writing a banal
439420	444860	hit piece on Vox whenever Pewdiepie sneezes. She's there every time to lick up the snot.
444860	446540	Romano later tweeted,
453040	458320	Jesus Christ, she makes it sound like she's an actual reporter photographing naked Vietnamese
458320	462780	kids running away from a battle or something. You shit talked a huge personality with no
462780	468020	evidence to back you up. What did you expect his fans to do? Here's Diana, an SJW working
468020	473300	for Ubisoft, requesting that the gaming industry end Pewdiepie. It doesn't matter that Pewdiepie
473300	477820	has one of the biggest platforms in the world, and that if gaming companies cut ties with
477820	482380	him, they would likely suffer financial losses. He has the wrong opinions, goddammit. And
482380	487080	what's worse, he doesn't have the proper social justice wrong opinion exemption clearance
487080	492240	like Jong and Malik and Romano do. By the way, Diana had to private her account after
492240	496680	making this tweet. It turns out that baselessly shitting on somebody with a massive audience
496680	500760	is not a smart move. A lesson that Wired also had to learn the hard way.
500760	504800	Oopsie doopsie, turns out it's harder to cyber smear someone when their audience dwarfs
504800	508380	yours. The internet was a mistake. We need to go back to the days where we could smear
508380	512360	somebody and they couldn't fight back outside of a court of law. With the way things are,
512360	515940	anyone can just point out our lies to millions of people. We're powerless.
515940	520340	Okay, that's obviously a joke article. It was edited from inside the printer hacking
520340	525700	army spreading Pewdiepie propaganda. But it's still pretty funny. And honestly, pretty true,
525700	530180	considering that the actual Wired article also tries to slander Pewds as a racist. But
530180	535460	the article's main point is to describe an event where fans of Pewdiepie hacked 80,000
535460	540260	printers to print off messages advertising readers to subscribe to Pewdiepie and, although
540260	544080	we took the long way to get here, we're finally at the question I pose at the beginning
544080	548660	of this video. Why subscribe to Pewdiepie? The short version of the story is, Pewdiepie
548660	553740	has been the top dog since 2013, but T-Series has come close multiple times to dethroning
553740	558520	him for the most subscribed YouTube channel. T-Series is a success story in its own right.
558520	562120	The owner was a poor fisherman from India who decided one day to make a channel where
562120	566600	he could post music. And as more and more people in India got hooked up to the internet,
566600	571260	T-Series began to blow up due to that alone. T-Series also gets more hits than Pewdiepie
571260	576340	per day by a full order of magnitude due solely to the fact that most of its content is music
576340	581060	and therefore will be replayed many times by its sub-base. And you know, good on T-Series
581060	585280	for being successful. Good on the fisherman for building his own company. But it is a
585280	590260	faceless company in the end, isn't it? Pewdiepie is as much the man as it is the brand. He
590260	595020	may have an office space, he may employ people, but you can't just replace the man behind
595020	599020	the brand. In my opinion, Game Grumps is a good example of what happens to a brand
599020	603760	when you do replace the man behind it. Grumps had soul when it was Aaron and John, and even
603760	607860	though it's wildly more successful now than it's ever been, Aaron and Dan have never
607860	611840	been able to replicate the friendly rivalry that made the channel initially go viral.
611840	616840	The history of Grumps is basically what happens when you let Pewdiepie transform into T-Series,
616840	621400	strangely enough. But YouTube has always been about these solo guys, where the name of their
621400	624540	person, the name of their channel, and the name of their show were always one and the
624540	628960	same. The Angry Video Game nerd started that trend, and was number one in his own right
628960	634140	during YouTube's early days. Spoonie, while he was relevant, was the same type of creator.
634140	639340	JonTron is another massive example. From Sargon to Oni, from Maryland to Scooby, from the
639340	644140	early days right up to the present day, YouTube culture has always revolved around YouTubers.
644140	649380	Not so much channels or brands. It's YouTubers that go viral. It's channels and brands
649380	654760	that get pushed by the algorithms, get shuffled around randomly on the homepage, and get undeserved
654760	659320	spots on the trending list. I do think Jack Black's new channel is funny, but why do
659320	664000	his videos consistently beat out Pewdiepie's to the official trending list, despite fewer
664000	669060	subs, fewer hits, fewer comments and votes, and an overall slower rate of growth? Is it
669060	675260	because Jack Black's a safe celebrity, and Pewdiepie's an unsafe YouTuber? Probably.
675260	680240	But that's why people like YouTubers. Regardless of their quality, their consistency, their
680240	685200	video style, their genre or their interests, regardless of anything else, their channels
685200	689700	are as much about them as they are about what they produce. When the channel blows up, we
689700	693560	can see it's because of their work. When a channel stops putting out videos, we can see
693560	697640	it's because they're lazy. But it's always about the person behind the channel. And sometimes
697640	702860	it is more than one person. Hell, my channel started with two people in 2009, and neither
702860	707180	of them were me. But it's still people with faces that you can point to, for better or
707180	711420	worse, and say that they are the channel. This can't be done with T-Series. And this
711420	716240	can't be done with a lot of other YouTube-approved channels. And that's why the sub-battle between
716240	720300	Pewdiepie and T-Series has become a battle for the soul of the internet. Pewdiepie is
720300	724380	the single guy that is the face of his operation. The independent fellow who isn't afraid to
724380	729240	give his honest opinion on any topic. He's the actual YouTuber. T-Series is the corporation
729240	735920	without a face. The formulaic, safe, algorithm-friendly content churned out regularly. The TV-style
735920	741400	channel. To be honest, a few years ago, it would have been the Fine Bros React brand,
741400	745480	or Smosh or something, that probably would have exemplified this role. But most importantly
745480	750160	of all, Pewdiepie is what YouTube started as, what YouTube has always done best, and
750160	756160	what YouTube's user base wants it to be. Creator-focused, independent, uncontrollable by the media,
756160	761280	and ultimately, honest. T-Series is what the media wants YouTube to be, what investors
761280	766880	want YouTube to be, and frankly, what YouTube now wants YouTube to be. Brand-focused, safe,
766880	772920	marketable, accountable to censors. YouTube wants to be the new cable TV. They would reorganize
772920	777760	everybody's feeds to be a curated selection of pre-approved channels only if it wouldn't
777760	782880	instantly kill their site. The immense negative reaction to YouTube Rewind is a great example
782880	787680	of this. What did that piece of shit have? Celebrities who have nothing to do with YouTube
787680	791840	or its culture. Small-time YouTube names that promote the proper politics and suck the right
791840	798140	dicks. Safe, pre-packaged, freeze-dried, plastic-wrapped YouTubers that were hand-picked and pushed
798140	803560	by YouTube because the content they shit out is utterly meaningless. And as a result, YouTube
803560	808360	Rewind became the most downvoted video in YouTube history. And, like the social justice
808360	813620	warriors from earlier, YouTube asymmetrically enforces its own rules. Mumkey Jones got banned
813620	818520	for old jokes, not because of the jokes themselves, but because he's too small to cause a serious
818520	823100	uproar. Sargon got a strike on a video from years ago because the rules have changed and
823100	828100	are retroactively applied, at least to some of us. But Logan Paul can show a dead body
828100	832480	on YouTube and nobody really cares in their offices. YouTube only gave him a tepid slap
832480	837600	on the wrist after the entire internet made an uproar about it because YouTube has pre-approved
837600	842460	Logan Paul as a safe bet, regardless of what he actually puts in his videos. But PewDiePie's
842460	847060	a shitlord through and through. He's not a safe bet. And in spite of that, he's still
847060	851960	too big for YouTube to touch, not if they want to wreck their own platform. Though frankly,
851960	856460	calling them a platform at this point is inaccurate. In an interview, Bill Gates compared Windows
856460	860800	to Facebook, refusing to call the latter a platform. That's a crock of shit. This isn't
860800	865160	a platform. A platform is when the economic value of everybody that uses it exceeds the
865160	869440	value of the company that created it. Then it's a platform. Gates correctly identified
869440	873960	Windows as a platform because it was a portal through which a near infinite number of actions
873960	877940	could be performed on a PC. Windows doesn't take a cut of the stream that you do, the
877940	882580	image you draw, the video you edit, the book you write, or the business you perform, just
882580	887540	because your PC is running Windows. But that's exactly what YouTube does. And it's even worse
887540	892520	for Facebook or Twitter, where it's the users that are the product. These things aren't
892520	897460	platforms. A platform is an avenue through which content is created, not an avenue through
897460	903460	which content is controlled. YouTube, as well as the rest of social media, is far more centralized
903460	908340	than a platform. And I think that's the ultimate problem here. Centralized control. That's
908340	913520	where Gamergate came from, and ComiXgate after it. That's why Trump and Brexit happened.
913520	917860	That's why everybody hates Facebook and Twitter and YouTube and Reddit. The internet began
917860	922600	as a decentralized mess. But it was free. The internet's no longer decentralized, and
922600	927220	we've been watching the freedom slowly disappear into the black hole of terms and conditions.
927220	930440	Remember when content creators had their own websites where they would embed videos and
930440	935400	shit? Now everything's a subreddit or a Facebook fan page. And now those communities don't
935400	939980	get to decide the rules for themselves appropriate to that community. Everybody follows Facebook's
939980	945160	rules or Reddit's rules or Twitter's or Discord's or YouTube's. And these companies have begun
945160	948120	to weaponize that power against their user base.
948120	953140	Gamergate didn't cause Trump or Brexit, as the progressives widely believe. Rather, Gamergate,
953140	957260	Trump and Brexit all had a common starting point that they split off from. The desire
957260	962280	to be free from an ever-centralizing control structure, which has become entirely detached
962280	966900	from the interests of common people. Whether you're talking about career politicians, YouTube's
966900	972180	customer service, or the attitude of snooty journos, detached really is the perfect word.
972180	975260	Detached from accountability, morality, and sensibility.
975260	980200	This is why subscribing to PewDiePie is important. Not because PewDiePie himself is solely keeping
980200	984340	the forces of YouTube autocracy at bay, but because the internet tilts a little bit more
984340	988780	away from freedom every time a social media company centralizes its power. Every time
988780	993700	a new bit of speech previously considered fine is censored. Every time a corporate TV
993700	998860	style channel is favored over a YouTuber. But this dream of centralized control, that's
998860	1004200	the wet dream of the SJWs and the mainstream media barons. It really is a strange union.
1004200	1009020	The socialist advocates siding with the modern day robber barons against the common person.
1009020	1012920	That's why the two big stories recently, The Mega Kids and Learn to Code, both blew
1012920	1017220	up as rapidly as they did. They were both textbook examples of progressives in power
1017220	1021660	grossly abusing that power, getting caught with their pants down, and filthy unwashed
1021660	1025500	commoners on the internet having the gall to laugh at their expense. That's why every
1025500	1029920	time somebody from outside the Overton window, somebody that SJWs and the progressive media
1029920	1035660	have already tried to spin a narrative on, like Elon Musk, Ben Shapiro, Sargon, or UKIP,
1035660	1040220	mentions or is mentioned by PewDiePie, it turns into a huge crisis. Oh no, PewDiePie
1040220	1044740	is corrupting the youth, a short clip of Baked Alaska was on the channel, this is terrible,
1044740	1050540	he's humanizing Ben Shapiro. Do you people even listen to yourselves? That's why the
1050540	1055820	joke Wired article was so on point, it reveals exactly how they think. That's why social
1055820	1060100	justicey teachers are wasting valuable time in class telling their students about how
1060100	1064400	Gamergate is a hate group, how Pepe is a symbol of white supremacy, and how supporting
1065400	1071600	And by every time you retweet one of these things, or every time you promote this idea,
1071600	1080120	you are promoting ignorance, racism, genocide, antisemitism, these are all things that you
1080120	1085960	are putting forward when you are doing anything that promotes PewDiePie. So be careful about
1085960	1090080	this. If someone decided to, if something were to happen, if PewDiePie were to be sued
1090080	1094680	for this, you could be complicit. If you retweet it, they could make you pay a fine
1094680	1101200	as well, because you have officially published antisemitic things. So if you are republishing
1101200	1105960	this stuff, you could get in trouble for it. Be very aware that that is a real thing.
1105960	1110760	And that's why, despite all these efforts from the top, the regular people, the plebs,
1110760	1115080	aren't having any of it. When the people in power write articles, we buy billboards. When
1115080	1119080	the people in power demand the obedience of their students, we wear shirts at the Super
1119080	1123800	Bowl. When the people in power use their large platforms to shame their users, we use
1123800	1128520	our small platforms to voice our objection. And thankfully, YouTube is not so far gone
1128520	1132660	yet that our small platforms are doomed to be small forever. We can still grow with enough
1132660	1138240	hard work. That fact is the only appeal YouTube has left. And YouTube is desperately looking
1138240	1143760	for a way to keep its fan base while simultaneously stripping away that final perk. The chance
1143760	1148900	that a pleb might get big one day. It's Wojcicki's wet dream, but we need to ensure that it remains
1148900	1153220	impossible. And if they actually do it, we need to ensure we have another platform we
1153220	1157860	can thrive on. When I said this was a war for YouTube's soul, I meant it. This is a war
1157860	1163680	between what YouTube naturally is and what moneyed interests want YouTube to be. This
1163680	1170140	is a war between both YouTubers and viewers and YouTube itself. And it's not one that
1170140	1174560	we started. Every time YouTube tweaks the algorithm so that you're less likely to see
1174560	1179580	content that you want because they deem it to be unsafe. Every time YouTube shuffles
1179580	1183840	the front page showing you a bunch of shit you don't really care about because that's
1183840	1189360	what they want you to watch. Every time YouTube curates another part of its service, that
1189360	1194320	is YouTube going to war with its own users. This video has become a bit of a ramble, but
1194320	1198120	it's a topic that's close to my heart as a YouTuber myself. And I have a feeling that
1198120	1202920	a lot of YouTubers and probably a good chunk of viewers agree with me on this. Subscribing
1202920	1207340	to PewDiePie isn't really about subscribing to PewDiePie. It's about reaffirming the supremacy
1207340	1211960	of the individual over the corporation. Of freedom of choice over algorithmic decision
1211960	1217100	making. Of creativity and love over pre-approved safety. If that means that I get slandered
1217100	1224240	as alt-right or a Nazi or a racist or whatever, fine. Before all else comes freedom.
1224240	1228360	Thank you for watching guys. If you're here during the premiere, drop by my gaming channel
1228360	1234240	at twitch.tv slash game boomers at 7pm EST, about 3 hours and change from now. I'm going
1234240	1237320	to be attempting the path of pain in Hollow Knight, and if you're watching some time
1237320	1240880	in the future, drop by anyway. I stream 5 nights a week, I'll probably be playing
1240880	1244200	something. I'm outta here my friends. Remember, I love you.
