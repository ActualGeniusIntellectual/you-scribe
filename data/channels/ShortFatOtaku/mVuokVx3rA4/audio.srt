1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,640
Well, shit. I guess I better do my part. Wait, why is Bieber on here?

2
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:21,320
In early 2017, PewDiePie paid two strangers through a service called Fiverr to hold up

3
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:24,760
a sign that said death to all Jews as an obvious joke.

4
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:32,480
Here we go. Sign to behold. Death to all-

Tell us how to pronounce your given message. Sub-scra-ab-to-keen-star-star.

6
00:00:49,480 --> 00:01:06,520
Guys, please, deliver. The fuck is this? I paid for this?

7
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:16,980
What? What's with the Christmas- I like the editing.

8
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:29,100
Subscribe to Keemstar. In response, the Wall Street Journal slandered

9
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:33,780
him as an anti-Semite, and spent hundreds of hours watching his backlog to try and find

10
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:36,620
other jokes that they could twist to support their position.

11
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:42,180
As a result, PewDiePie lost a deal with Disney. Later that year, PewDiePie said nigger on

12
00:01:42,180 --> 00:02:10,140
a livestream, out of anger at the game he was playing.

13
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:32,900
Even after apologizing, the mainstream media again jumped down his throat. In both instances,

14
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:37,260
the media showed a distinct lack of interest in giving him the benefit of the doubt.

15
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:49,220
On The Guardian, Cheloraminon wrote,

16
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:53,860
Commonly known as PewDiePie, the vlogger called another player a fucking nigger during a live

17
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:59,380
video stream. Taking too long to realize his mistake, he qualified the racist slur with

18
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:04,100
I don't mean it in a bad way, and laughed it off. Listen to how that is written. Taking

19
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:08,980
too long to realize his mistake, that's where we're at guys. Recognizing and understanding

20
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:12,620
that you fucked up just doesn't count if you took an extra second or two too long to

21
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:18,820
do it, according to social justice sensibilities. It was literally three seconds, and that's

22
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:22,200
too long apparently. Despite the public outcry, many people are

23
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:27,860
coming to Kellberg's defense, some using the hashtag PewDiePie did nothing wrong. Dismissing

24
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:33,540
the event as a crime of gaming passion, this ignores his influence and sends a clear message

25
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:37,660
that it's okay to be racist in the gaming community. Maybe I'm in the minority opinion

26
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:42,420
on this, but I don't think PewDiePie has an imperative to consider his influence. Charles

27
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:47,420
Barkley publicly stated that he's not a role model, but a basketball player, and that there

28
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:54,420
was no moral impetus for him not to behave the way he wanted to behave.

29
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:24,420
Moreover, I know what's really meant by ignoring his influence. Whenever progressives see a

30
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:30,640
platform that somebody else built, they try to worm their way in, either by converting

31
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:35,420
the people on the platform to their politics, or smuggling a person inside in order to co-opt

32
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:39,980
it for their own use. It happened to Cracked, it happened to The Onion, it happened to every

33
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:44,260
major tech giant out there, it happened to pretty much every video game developer, both

34
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:50,420
AAA and Indie, it happened to books, comics, Hollywood TV, you name it. But because YouTube

35
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:54,480
channels are generally centered around one guy, they've proven to be exceptionally

36
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:58,060
resilient to this type of takeover. This is why there's been a flood of articles for

37
00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:02,900
the past five years talking about how racist YouTubers are, when the truth is, most of

38
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:08,160
them are just inoculated against this specific type of bullshit. Casual use of racial slurs

39
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:12,140
needs to be condemned wholeheartedly every single time. There is never a good reason

40
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:16,400
to use the language displayed in this video. So by their own admission, this isn't even

41
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:20,620
about PewDiePie actually being a racist, it's about his language. As these people might

42
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:25,300
say in a different situation, it's about tone policing. Let's be honest here, if

43
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:30,100
you actually think Pewds is a racist, you're either an idiot, or you're pushing an agenda.

44
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:35,200
When people are frustrated, they say things out of that frustration. It's unreasonable

45
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:40,360
to infer people's actual beliefs from those outbursts. In fact, social justice warriors

46
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:46,320
routinely use but they were frustrated as an excuse to spew hate, like when The Guardian's

47
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:50,860
Nasreen Malik said that actually punching your political opponents was justified because

48
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:53,260
it was a form of racial catharsis.

49
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:57,500
When Richard Spencer was punched while giving an interview in the street, it was a cathartic

50
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:03,220
moment for many. A lot of us find ourselves at a loss for how to respond as frightening

51
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:09,580
and dangerous views are suddenly not only being aired, but mainstreamed. Unable to adjust,

52
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:14,400
we continue to engage with these views like they were just a new school of controversy.

53
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:20,200
The world had changed, but we hadn't caught up. That punch? It caught us up. The punch

54
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:25,960
was a calling out after a time when too many things were not called out for what they really

55
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:31,800
are. Going high might make us feel good about being the better party, but it is not a suitable

56
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:32,800
response.

57
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:38,040
Hell, when Sarah Jong spouted her own racist, vile garbage, she wasn't even doing it

58
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:43,420
out of frustration, but apparently that was okay. But as usual, it's no bad tactics,

59
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:48,220
only bad targets. Pewdiepie's jokes are to be taken as legitimate antisemitism, but

60
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:53,740
when the radicals on the left, like say in Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party or entire wings

61
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:59,420
of Black Lives Matter and the Women's Marches legitimately hate Jews, it's just no big

62
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:03,040
deal. One set of rules for me and another for thee, after all.

63
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:08,260
My point is, the mainstream media has used every single possible opportunity, every method

64
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:14,020
of attack it could find, to try and damage Pewdiepie, and as time has gone on, SJWs have

65
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:19,420
begun to aid them in their efforts. For example, Aja Romano wastes no time writing a banal

66
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:24,860
hit piece on Vox whenever Pewdiepie sneezes. She's there every time to lick up the snot.

67
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:26,540
Romano later tweeted,

68
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:38,320
Jesus Christ, she makes it sound like she's an actual reporter photographing naked Vietnamese

69
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:42,780
kids running away from a battle or something. You shit talked a huge personality with no

70
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:48,020
evidence to back you up. What did you expect his fans to do? Here's Diana, an SJW working

71
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:53,300
for Ubisoft, requesting that the gaming industry end Pewdiepie. It doesn't matter that Pewdiepie

72
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:57,820
has one of the biggest platforms in the world, and that if gaming companies cut ties with

73
00:07:57,820 --> 00:08:02,380
him, they would likely suffer financial losses. He has the wrong opinions, goddammit. And

74
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:07,080
what's worse, he doesn't have the proper social justice wrong opinion exemption clearance

75
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:12,240
like Jong and Malik and Romano do. By the way, Diana had to private her account after

76
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:16,680
making this tweet. It turns out that baselessly shitting on somebody with a massive audience

77
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:20,760
is not a smart move. A lesson that Wired also had to learn the hard way.

78
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:24,800
Oopsie doopsie, turns out it's harder to cyber smear someone when their audience dwarfs

79
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:28,380
yours. The internet was a mistake. We need to go back to the days where we could smear

80
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:32,360
somebody and they couldn't fight back outside of a court of law. With the way things are,

81
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:35,940
anyone can just point out our lies to millions of people. We're powerless.

82
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:40,340
Okay, that's obviously a joke article. It was edited from inside the printer hacking

83
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:45,700
army spreading Pewdiepie propaganda. But it's still pretty funny. And honestly, pretty true,

84
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:50,180
considering that the actual Wired article also tries to slander Pewds as a racist. But

85
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:55,460
the article's main point is to describe an event where fans of Pewdiepie hacked 80,000

86
00:08:55,460 --> 00:09:00,260
printers to print off messages advertising readers to subscribe to Pewdiepie and, although

87
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:04,080
we took the long way to get here, we're finally at the question I pose at the beginning

88
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:08,660
of this video. Why subscribe to Pewdiepie? The short version of the story is, Pewdiepie

89
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:13,740
has been the top dog since 2013, but T-Series has come close multiple times to dethroning

90
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:18,520
him for the most subscribed YouTube channel. T-Series is a success story in its own right.

91
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:22,120
The owner was a poor fisherman from India who decided one day to make a channel where

92
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:26,600
he could post music. And as more and more people in India got hooked up to the internet,

93
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:31,260
T-Series began to blow up due to that alone. T-Series also gets more hits than Pewdiepie

94
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:36,340
per day by a full order of magnitude due solely to the fact that most of its content is music

95
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:41,060
and therefore will be replayed many times by its sub-base. And you know, good on T-Series

96
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:45,280
for being successful. Good on the fisherman for building his own company. But it is a

97
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:50,260
faceless company in the end, isn't it? Pewdiepie is as much the man as it is the brand. He

98
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:55,020
may have an office space, he may employ people, but you can't just replace the man behind

99
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:59,020
the brand. In my opinion, Game Grumps is a good example of what happens to a brand

100
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:03,760
when you do replace the man behind it. Grumps had soul when it was Aaron and John, and even

101
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:07,860
though it's wildly more successful now than it's ever been, Aaron and Dan have never

102
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:11,840
been able to replicate the friendly rivalry that made the channel initially go viral.

103
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:16,840
The history of Grumps is basically what happens when you let Pewdiepie transform into T-Series,

104
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:21,400
strangely enough. But YouTube has always been about these solo guys, where the name of their

105
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:24,540
person, the name of their channel, and the name of their show were always one and the

106
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:28,960
same. The Angry Video Game nerd started that trend, and was number one in his own right

107
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:34,140
during YouTube's early days. Spoonie, while he was relevant, was the same type of creator.

108
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:39,340
JonTron is another massive example. From Sargon to Oni, from Maryland to Scooby, from the

109
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:44,140
early days right up to the present day, YouTube culture has always revolved around YouTubers.

110
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:49,380
Not so much channels or brands. It's YouTubers that go viral. It's channels and brands

111
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:54,760
that get pushed by the algorithms, get shuffled around randomly on the homepage, and get undeserved

112
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:59,320
spots on the trending list. I do think Jack Black's new channel is funny, but why do

113
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:04,000
his videos consistently beat out Pewdiepie's to the official trending list, despite fewer

114
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:09,060
subs, fewer hits, fewer comments and votes, and an overall slower rate of growth? Is it

115
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:15,260
because Jack Black's a safe celebrity, and Pewdiepie's an unsafe YouTuber? Probably.

116
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:20,240
But that's why people like YouTubers. Regardless of their quality, their consistency, their

117
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:25,200
video style, their genre or their interests, regardless of anything else, their channels

118
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:29,700
are as much about them as they are about what they produce. When the channel blows up, we

119
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:33,560
can see it's because of their work. When a channel stops putting out videos, we can see

120
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:37,640
it's because they're lazy. But it's always about the person behind the channel. And sometimes

121
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:42,860
it is more than one person. Hell, my channel started with two people in 2009, and neither

122
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:47,180
of them were me. But it's still people with faces that you can point to, for better or

123
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:51,420
worse, and say that they are the channel. This can't be done with T-Series. And this

124
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:56,240
can't be done with a lot of other YouTube-approved channels. And that's why the sub-battle between

125
00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:00,300
Pewdiepie and T-Series has become a battle for the soul of the internet. Pewdiepie is

126
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:04,380
the single guy that is the face of his operation. The independent fellow who isn't afraid to

127
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:09,240
give his honest opinion on any topic. He's the actual YouTuber. T-Series is the corporation

128
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:15,920
without a face. The formulaic, safe, algorithm-friendly content churned out regularly. The TV-style

129
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:21,400
channel. To be honest, a few years ago, it would have been the Fine Bros React brand,

130
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:25,480
or Smosh or something, that probably would have exemplified this role. But most importantly

131
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:30,160
of all, Pewdiepie is what YouTube started as, what YouTube has always done best, and

132
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:36,160
what YouTube's user base wants it to be. Creator-focused, independent, uncontrollable by the media,

133
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:41,280
and ultimately, honest. T-Series is what the media wants YouTube to be, what investors

134
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:46,880
want YouTube to be, and frankly, what YouTube now wants YouTube to be. Brand-focused, safe,

135
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:52,920
marketable, accountable to censors. YouTube wants to be the new cable TV. They would reorganize

136
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:57,760
everybody's feeds to be a curated selection of pre-approved channels only if it wouldn't

137
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:02,880
instantly kill their site. The immense negative reaction to YouTube Rewind is a great example

138
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:07,680
of this. What did that piece of shit have? Celebrities who have nothing to do with YouTube

139
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:11,840
or its culture. Small-time YouTube names that promote the proper politics and suck the right

140
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:18,140
dicks. Safe, pre-packaged, freeze-dried, plastic-wrapped YouTubers that were hand-picked and pushed

141
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:23,560
by YouTube because the content they shit out is utterly meaningless. And as a result, YouTube

142
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:28,360
Rewind became the most downvoted video in YouTube history. And, like the social justice

143
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:33,620
warriors from earlier, YouTube asymmetrically enforces its own rules. Mumkey Jones got banned

144
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:38,520
for old jokes, not because of the jokes themselves, but because he's too small to cause a serious

145
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:43,100
uproar. Sargon got a strike on a video from years ago because the rules have changed and

146
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:48,100
are retroactively applied, at least to some of us. But Logan Paul can show a dead body

147
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:52,480
on YouTube and nobody really cares in their offices. YouTube only gave him a tepid slap

148
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:57,600
on the wrist after the entire internet made an uproar about it because YouTube has pre-approved

149
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:02,460
Logan Paul as a safe bet, regardless of what he actually puts in his videos. But PewDiePie's

150
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:07,060
a shitlord through and through. He's not a safe bet. And in spite of that, he's still

151
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:11,960
too big for YouTube to touch, not if they want to wreck their own platform. Though frankly,

152
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:16,460
calling them a platform at this point is inaccurate. In an interview, Bill Gates compared Windows

153
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:20,800
to Facebook, refusing to call the latter a platform. That's a crock of shit. This isn't

154
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:25,160
a platform. A platform is when the economic value of everybody that uses it exceeds the

155
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:29,440
value of the company that created it. Then it's a platform. Gates correctly identified

156
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:33,960
Windows as a platform because it was a portal through which a near infinite number of actions

157
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:37,940
could be performed on a PC. Windows doesn't take a cut of the stream that you do, the

158
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:42,580
image you draw, the video you edit, the book you write, or the business you perform, just

159
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:47,540
because your PC is running Windows. But that's exactly what YouTube does. And it's even worse

160
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:52,520
for Facebook or Twitter, where it's the users that are the product. These things aren't

161
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:57,460
platforms. A platform is an avenue through which content is created, not an avenue through

162
00:14:57,460 --> 00:15:03,460
which content is controlled. YouTube, as well as the rest of social media, is far more centralized

163
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:08,340
than a platform. And I think that's the ultimate problem here. Centralized control. That's

164
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:13,520
where Gamergate came from, and ComiXgate after it. That's why Trump and Brexit happened.

165
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:17,860
That's why everybody hates Facebook and Twitter and YouTube and Reddit. The internet began

166
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:22,600
as a decentralized mess. But it was free. The internet's no longer decentralized, and

167
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:27,220
we've been watching the freedom slowly disappear into the black hole of terms and conditions.

168
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:30,440
Remember when content creators had their own websites where they would embed videos and

169
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:35,400
shit? Now everything's a subreddit or a Facebook fan page. And now those communities don't

170
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:39,980
get to decide the rules for themselves appropriate to that community. Everybody follows Facebook's

171
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:45,160
rules or Reddit's rules or Twitter's or Discord's or YouTube's. And these companies have begun

172
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:48,120
to weaponize that power against their user base.

173
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:53,140
Gamergate didn't cause Trump or Brexit, as the progressives widely believe. Rather, Gamergate,

174
00:15:53,140 --> 00:15:57,260
Trump and Brexit all had a common starting point that they split off from. The desire

175
00:15:57,260 --> 00:16:02,280
to be free from an ever-centralizing control structure, which has become entirely detached

176
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:06,900
from the interests of common people. Whether you're talking about career politicians, YouTube's

177
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:12,180
customer service, or the attitude of snooty journos, detached really is the perfect word.

178
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:15,260
Detached from accountability, morality, and sensibility.

179
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:20,200
This is why subscribing to PewDiePie is important. Not because PewDiePie himself is solely keeping

180
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:24,340
the forces of YouTube autocracy at bay, but because the internet tilts a little bit more

181
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:28,780
away from freedom every time a social media company centralizes its power. Every time

182
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:33,700
a new bit of speech previously considered fine is censored. Every time a corporate TV

183
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:38,860
style channel is favored over a YouTuber. But this dream of centralized control, that's

184
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:44,200
the wet dream of the SJWs and the mainstream media barons. It really is a strange union.

185
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:49,020
The socialist advocates siding with the modern day robber barons against the common person.

186
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:52,920
That's why the two big stories recently, The Mega Kids and Learn to Code, both blew

187
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:57,220
up as rapidly as they did. They were both textbook examples of progressives in power

188
00:16:57,220 --> 00:17:01,660
grossly abusing that power, getting caught with their pants down, and filthy unwashed

189
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:05,500
commoners on the internet having the gall to laugh at their expense. That's why every

190
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:09,920
time somebody from outside the Overton window, somebody that SJWs and the progressive media

191
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:15,660
have already tried to spin a narrative on, like Elon Musk, Ben Shapiro, Sargon, or UKIP,

192
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:20,220
mentions or is mentioned by PewDiePie, it turns into a huge crisis. Oh no, PewDiePie

193
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:24,740
is corrupting the youth, a short clip of Baked Alaska was on the channel, this is terrible,

194
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:30,540
he's humanizing Ben Shapiro. Do you people even listen to yourselves? That's why the

195
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:35,820
joke Wired article was so on point, it reveals exactly how they think. That's why social

196
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:40,100
justicey teachers are wasting valuable time in class telling their students about how

197
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:44,400
Gamergate is a hate group, how Pepe is a symbol of white supremacy, and how supporting

198
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:51,600
And by every time you retweet one of these things, or every time you promote this idea,

199
00:17:51,600 --> 00:18:00,120
you are promoting ignorance, racism, genocide, antisemitism, these are all things that you

200
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:05,960
are putting forward when you are doing anything that promotes PewDiePie. So be careful about

201
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:10,080
this. If someone decided to, if something were to happen, if PewDiePie were to be sued

202
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:14,680
for this, you could be complicit. If you retweet it, they could make you pay a fine

203
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:21,200
as well, because you have officially published antisemitic things. So if you are republishing

204
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:25,960
this stuff, you could get in trouble for it. Be very aware that that is a real thing.

205
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:30,760
And that's why, despite all these efforts from the top, the regular people, the plebs,

206
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:35,080
aren't having any of it. When the people in power write articles, we buy billboards. When

207
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:39,080
the people in power demand the obedience of their students, we wear shirts at the Super

208
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:43,800
Bowl. When the people in power use their large platforms to shame their users, we use

209
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:48,520
our small platforms to voice our objection. And thankfully, YouTube is not so far gone

210
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:52,660
yet that our small platforms are doomed to be small forever. We can still grow with enough

211
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:58,240
hard work. That fact is the only appeal YouTube has left. And YouTube is desperately looking

212
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:03,760
for a way to keep its fan base while simultaneously stripping away that final perk. The chance

213
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:08,900
that a pleb might get big one day. It's Wojcicki's wet dream, but we need to ensure that it remains

214
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:13,220
impossible. And if they actually do it, we need to ensure we have another platform we

215
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:17,860
can thrive on. When I said this was a war for YouTube's soul, I meant it. This is a war

216
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:23,680
between what YouTube naturally is and what moneyed interests want YouTube to be. This

217
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:30,140
is a war between both YouTubers and viewers and YouTube itself. And it's not one that

218
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:34,560
we started. Every time YouTube tweaks the algorithm so that you're less likely to see

219
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:39,580
content that you want because they deem it to be unsafe. Every time YouTube shuffles

220
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:43,840
the front page showing you a bunch of shit you don't really care about because that's

221
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:49,360
what they want you to watch. Every time YouTube curates another part of its service, that

222
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:54,320
is YouTube going to war with its own users. This video has become a bit of a ramble, but

223
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:58,120
it's a topic that's close to my heart as a YouTuber myself. And I have a feeling that

224
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:02,920
a lot of YouTubers and probably a good chunk of viewers agree with me on this. Subscribing

225
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:07,340
to PewDiePie isn't really about subscribing to PewDiePie. It's about reaffirming the supremacy

226
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:11,960
of the individual over the corporation. Of freedom of choice over algorithmic decision

227
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:17,100
making. Of creativity and love over pre-approved safety. If that means that I get slandered

228
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:24,240
as alt-right or a Nazi or a racist or whatever, fine. Before all else comes freedom.

229
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:28,360
Thank you for watching guys. If you're here during the premiere, drop by my gaming channel

230
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:34,240
at twitch.tv slash game boomers at 7pm EST, about 3 hours and change from now. I'm going

231
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:37,320
to be attempting the path of pain in Hollow Knight, and if you're watching some time

232
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:40,880
in the future, drop by anyway. I stream 5 nights a week, I'll probably be playing

233
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:44,200
something. I'm outta here my friends. Remember, I love you.
