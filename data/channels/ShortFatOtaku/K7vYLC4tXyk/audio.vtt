WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:10.440
Oh god, you guys, I know this is a preemption to a regularly scheduled topic, but I've been

00:10.440 --> 00:12.160
trolling Twitter all day.

00:12.160 --> 00:13.880
Look at these masterpieces.

00:13.880 --> 00:17.360
Only one of them kind of took off, but they're all my babies and I love them dearly.

00:17.360 --> 00:20.040
Yeah, when I get a new Twitter account, I'll let you know.

00:20.040 --> 00:22.720
Speaking of babies though, we're here to talk about abortion.

00:22.720 --> 00:27.760
Now I did an abortion video like five years ago, where I tried to, as neutrally as possible,

00:27.760 --> 00:29.740
examine the arguments of both sides.

00:29.740 --> 00:33.280
I think I did an okay job of it all things considered, and even though it's old, I still

00:33.280 --> 00:34.420
think you should go back and watch it.

00:34.420 --> 00:38.580
I got a couple of things wrong, most notably that repeated abortions don't cause medical

00:38.580 --> 00:39.580
problems.

00:39.580 --> 00:41.060
They do, though the number has to be quite high.

00:41.060 --> 00:44.300
Also, I predicted COVID back in February of 2018.

00:44.300 --> 00:48.100
Do bodily autonomy rights not also include the right to not get a vaccination?

00:48.100 --> 00:50.780
Is a vaccination needle not also a foreign object?

00:50.780 --> 00:55.140
It seems to be a huge contradiction to me that people who champion bodily autonomy so

00:55.140 --> 00:59.060
much would also force people to get vaccinations if given the chance.

00:59.060 --> 01:00.780
Just call me Dev Stradamus.

01:00.780 --> 01:05.220
But the reason that we're talking about this again is because Roe v. Wade just got hit

01:05.220 --> 01:06.420
with a huge blow.

01:06.420 --> 01:09.220
Supreme Court has voted to overturn abortion rights.

01:09.220 --> 01:10.500
Draft opinion shows.

01:10.500 --> 01:15.580
We hold that Roe and Casey must be overruled, Justice Alito writes, in an initial majority

01:15.580 --> 01:17.260
draft circulated inside the court.

01:17.260 --> 01:21.380
This is a draft, meaning that Roe v. Wade hasn't been overturned yet, but it's probably

01:21.380 --> 01:22.460
coming down the pipe.

01:22.460 --> 01:28.160
The draft opinion is a full-throated, unflinching reputation of the 1973 decision, which guaranteed

01:28.160 --> 01:32.640
federal constitutional protections of abortion rights, and a subsequent 1992 decision, Planned

01:32.640 --> 01:36.200
Parenthood v. Casey, that largely maintained those rights.

01:36.200 --> 01:40.860
Roe was egregiously wrong from the start, Alito writes, we hold that Roe and Casey must

01:40.860 --> 01:41.860
be overruled.

01:41.860 --> 01:44.060
The document is labeled the opinion of the court.

01:44.060 --> 01:48.360
It is time to heed the Constitution and return the issue of abortion to the people's elected

01:48.360 --> 01:49.360
representatives.

01:49.360 --> 01:53.080
Everybody who's watched me for a while knows that I'm pro-choice, but even I can't

01:53.080 --> 01:54.260
argue with this logic.

01:54.260 --> 01:57.140
Roe v. Wade is known for being notoriously bad.

01:57.140 --> 02:01.820
It, out of nowhere, tied state regulation of abortion to the three trimesters of pregnancy,

02:01.820 --> 02:05.700
where, during the first trimester, governments could not prohibit abortions at all, during

02:05.700 --> 02:09.680
the second trimester, governments could require reasonable health regulations, and during

02:09.680 --> 02:14.840
the third trimester, abortions could be prohibited entirely so long as the laws contained exemptions

02:14.840 --> 02:18.020
for cases where they were necessary to save the life or health of the mother.

02:18.020 --> 02:22.220
The point of the Supreme Court is to judge whether or not the law being contested violates

02:22.220 --> 02:25.540
the Constitution, not to spin up new rules whole cloth.

02:25.540 --> 02:29.580
Nothing in the Constitution talks about trimesters or abortion, nor any previous ruling.

02:29.580 --> 02:33.660
The proper way to implement abortion rights was always through writing new legislation,

02:33.660 --> 02:37.020
not relying on a court case resting on shaky ground for 50 years.

02:37.020 --> 02:38.020
And you know what?

02:38.020 --> 02:39.940
The salt online is pretty incredible.

02:39.940 --> 02:45.140
The GOP hates women and is sentencing an entire generation to death.

02:45.140 --> 02:47.260
It seems like it's doing the opposite of that, buddy.

02:47.260 --> 02:50.580
It seems like an entirely new generation of kids are going to be born.

02:50.580 --> 02:55.920
An extremist Supreme Court is poised to overturn Roe v. Wade and impose its far-right, unpopular

02:55.920 --> 02:57.480
views on the entire country.

02:57.480 --> 03:01.000
It's time for the millions who support the Constitution and abortion rights to stand

03:01.000 --> 03:02.340
up and make their voices heard.

03:02.340 --> 03:03.560
We're not going back.

03:03.560 --> 03:05.300
So what do you want to do about it, Pocahontas?

03:05.300 --> 03:07.540
Are you going to riot in the Capitol building?

03:07.540 --> 03:10.700
One of the most disgraceful decisions in the history of the United States.

03:10.700 --> 03:15.060
Rather than conserving Roe v. Wade, the use of conserve there is lifting a lot of weight,

03:15.060 --> 03:17.300
which has been reaffirmed repeatedly for decades.

03:17.300 --> 03:22.380
These reactionaries disguised as conservatives have chosen to radically dismantle a core

03:22.380 --> 03:23.380
constitutional right.

03:23.380 --> 03:25.220
What do you think conservatives are?

03:25.220 --> 03:27.160
Do you think they share your values?

03:27.160 --> 03:30.280
Do you not understand that they have their own vision of the future?

03:30.280 --> 03:35.700
And do you actually think that a core constitutional right is a rickety court precedent not even

03:35.700 --> 03:37.520
found in the Constitution?

03:37.520 --> 03:42.360
Fuck every single one of these liberals who are blaming Jill Stein and third-party voters

03:42.360 --> 03:47.280
instead of their useless corporate party who could have codified abortion rights into law.

03:47.280 --> 03:50.040
Instead of using it as a cudgel to fundraise in every election.

03:50.040 --> 03:51.280
I'm not even going to comment on this one.

03:51.280 --> 03:55.620
I'm just going to stop recording for 15 minutes and masturbate to the sound of commie tears.

03:55.620 --> 04:01.460
Fuck Christians and their never-ending imperialistic, nationalistic, fascist patriarchy that puts

04:01.460 --> 04:05.320
people's lives at risk and doesn't give a shit about anyone or the science says the

04:05.320 --> 04:06.720
science.

04:06.720 --> 04:08.480
Shame on all who hold the cross.

04:08.480 --> 04:12.160
Two thousand years of genocide continues tonight.

04:12.160 --> 04:13.160
Fuck you.

04:13.160 --> 04:18.440
Hey, uh, Rabbi, is this why people are chanting abortion is a mitzvah at the Supreme Court

04:18.440 --> 04:19.440
right now?

04:19.440 --> 04:21.640
Yes, there is a lot of stuff to point fun at online right now.

04:21.640 --> 04:24.280
That could be a whole video on its own, just having a laugh.

04:24.280 --> 04:27.700
But people are actually protesting at the Supreme Court right now with barricades preset

04:27.700 --> 04:28.700
up for the event.

04:28.700 --> 04:30.340
My Spidey sense is tingling.

04:30.340 --> 04:33.400
Has there ever been a court draft leaked quite like this?

04:33.400 --> 04:35.680
The draft was apparently written in February, so why leak it now?

04:35.680 --> 04:40.640
I have a feeling this was leaked by some left-leaning, low-level staffer in order to galvanize the

04:40.640 --> 04:44.240
midterm vote, because 2022 is legitimately looking like a red wave.

04:44.240 --> 04:47.440
The Dems needed something to get their base riled up, and a leak like this would absolutely

04:47.440 --> 04:48.440
do the trick.

04:48.440 --> 04:51.620
The issue ultimately is, though, the naked hypocrisy of the whole thing.

04:51.620 --> 04:55.080
And no, I don't mean Joe Biden spending most of his career being against abortion

04:55.080 --> 04:57.120
before inexplicably shifting in his old age.

04:57.120 --> 04:59.180
That's clearly just moving with the political winds of his party.

04:59.180 --> 05:03.580
In 1992, Bill Clinton coined the phrase safe, legal, and rare.

05:03.580 --> 05:07.600
That was to be the compromise between conservatives and progressives on the legality of abortion.

05:07.600 --> 05:11.800
Clinton spent his political career in the 80s as being anti-abortion on a personal level,

05:11.800 --> 05:15.620
but he also recognized that he wasn't everyone, and there was a segment of the population

05:15.620 --> 05:17.520
voting for him that wanted abortion.

05:17.520 --> 05:19.360
And that phrase worked wonders.

05:19.360 --> 05:21.080
Safety is something that both sides can get behind.

05:21.080 --> 05:24.660
The danger of back-alley abortions would be remedied by the care and protection of a legitimate

05:24.660 --> 05:26.300
clinic or doctor's office.

05:26.300 --> 05:27.500
Legal was for the progressives.

05:27.500 --> 05:30.380
That safety could not be left to the vagueness of human emotion.

05:30.380 --> 05:31.680
It must be codified.

05:31.680 --> 05:33.260
And rare was for the conservatives.

05:33.260 --> 05:36.700
The people who found abortion to be morally reprehensible would at least be comforted by

05:36.700 --> 05:38.900
the fact that it would only happen when necessary.

05:38.900 --> 05:42.960
There would always be hardliners on the right who want no abortion whatsoever.

05:42.960 --> 05:45.780
And if you believe abortion to constitute death, fair enough.

05:45.780 --> 05:49.500
But no matter what topic it is, the political game never gives you an option that leads

05:49.500 --> 05:50.500
to no deaths.

05:50.500 --> 05:52.200
The best you can aim for is a minimum.

05:52.200 --> 05:56.680
There would also always be equivalent hardliners on the left who would want no restrictions

05:56.680 --> 05:57.680
on abortion at all.

05:57.680 --> 06:01.100
And while the right's hardliners remained shut out from the conversation, largely ignored

06:01.100 --> 06:04.940
by the mainstream right, mainly due to their political violence, the left's hardliners

06:04.940 --> 06:06.660
became the mainstream left.

06:06.660 --> 06:11.020
That's why the compromise of safe, legal and rare became the grotesque shout your abortion.

06:11.020 --> 06:14.760
And why people began to celebrate their ever increasing number of abortions, despite it

06:14.760 --> 06:17.780
being cringey and embarrassing and kind of gross.

06:17.780 --> 06:20.080
But safe, legal and rare was the compromise.

06:20.080 --> 06:23.780
And when the left violated the rare part of that compromise, they should not have been

06:23.780 --> 06:26.940
surprised when the right began to violate the legal part of it.

06:26.940 --> 06:29.940
When you ask the question, is it good to ban abortion?

06:29.940 --> 06:33.900
The conservative will say, yes, of course, life begins its conception.

06:33.900 --> 06:35.780
And by some metrics, it very clearly does.

06:35.900 --> 06:40.580
Meanwhile, the progressive will say, no, of course, women have the right to bodily autonomy.

06:40.580 --> 06:44.000
And if you believe in natural rights, then yeah, women clearly do.

06:44.000 --> 06:46.660
What can the liberal who is caught in the middle say to this?

06:46.660 --> 06:49.540
The liberals compromise was safe, legal and rare.

06:49.540 --> 06:53.260
The progressives have violated it by pushing to end the rare part and the conservatives

06:53.260 --> 06:57.240
are now counter violating it in turn by pushing to end the legal part.

06:57.240 --> 07:02.400
Your average person, your normie, your unaligned, disengaged, nominally liberal type generally

07:02.400 --> 07:04.760
views abortion as a necessary evil.

07:04.760 --> 07:07.080
They don't want it abolished, but they don't want it normalized.

07:07.080 --> 07:10.240
And with the progressive commitment to its rarity off the table, it seems like their

07:10.240 --> 07:14.080
only option to ensure that abortion is a rare event is to make it illegal.

07:14.080 --> 07:16.800
The progressives have left them no other choice.

07:16.800 --> 07:20.760
And yes, most people do view abortions as a necessary evil.

07:20.760 --> 07:25.080
Here's a report from the University of Chicago titled Trends in Public Attitudes Towards

07:25.080 --> 07:28.680
Abortion, containing data from 1972 to 2012.

07:28.680 --> 07:30.200
Here's the information we can glean from it.

07:30.200 --> 07:34.120
The progressive view that the abortion argument is simply pro-life men oppressing pro-choice

07:34.120 --> 07:37.560
women who have no place to be making these decisions is just false.

07:37.560 --> 07:42.400
While men are more likely to self-ID as pro-life and women as pro-choice, they actually answer

07:42.400 --> 07:46.960
all of the upcoming questions almost exactly the same, with on average only a 5% difference

07:46.960 --> 07:47.960
between the two.

07:47.960 --> 07:52.120
In general, men and women seem to hold the same views on topics related to abortion.

07:52.120 --> 07:57.580
71.5% of men and 69.4% of women said that abortion should be legal if there is a strong

07:57.580 --> 08:00.200
possibility of a serious fetal defect.

08:00.200 --> 08:07.020
83.1% of men and 43.3% of women say that abortion should be legal for married women who don't

08:07.020 --> 08:08.020
want more children.

08:08.020 --> 08:15.200
83.5% of men and 82.6% of women say that abortion should be legal if a woman's life is in danger

08:15.200 --> 08:16.200
by the pregnancy.

08:16.200 --> 08:21.600
40.4% of men and 40.9% of women say that abortion should be legal if a woman can't afford to

08:21.600 --> 08:23.040
have a kid right now.

08:23.040 --> 08:28.920
54.9% and 55.3% respectively say that it should be illegal in that circumstance.

08:28.920 --> 08:35.280
If the pregnancy is a result of rape, 71.1% of men and 72.8% of women say that abortion

08:35.280 --> 08:36.320
should be legal.

08:36.320 --> 08:41.380
Only 39% of both men and women said that abortion should be legally allowed in cases where the

08:41.380 --> 08:42.380
woman is unmarried.

08:42.380 --> 08:46.520
52.6% of men and 56.8% of women said that it should be illegal.

08:46.520 --> 08:52.080
40% of men and 43.2% of women said that abortion should be legal for any reason.

08:52.080 --> 08:57.720
57.9% of men and 54.2% of women said that it should be illegal for any reason.

08:57.720 --> 09:01.940
This data basically shows that large majorities of Americans believe that abortion should

09:01.940 --> 09:06.400
be legal in instances of rape, incest, and the life of the mother, which is the most

09:06.400 --> 09:10.360
popular Republican sloganeering on the topic, but also along with fetal defects, something

09:10.360 --> 09:11.880
that Republicans tend to ignore.

09:11.880 --> 09:16.900
It is a not small minority, but still a minority of both women and men hovering around 40%

09:16.900 --> 09:20.420
that believes abortion should simply be on demand with no restrictions.

09:20.420 --> 09:23.100
Of course, this data only goes up to 2012.

09:23.100 --> 09:26.960
It's entirely possible for attitudes to have changed drastically over the past 10 years,

09:26.960 --> 09:31.200
even though those attitudes remained solidly consistent from 1972 to 2012.

09:31.200 --> 09:35.440
There's more generalized data available on Pew Research that does go all the way up

09:35.440 --> 09:36.440
to 2021.

09:36.440 --> 09:40.040
It doesn't break it down by specific questions, like should abortion be legal in the case

09:40.040 --> 09:44.200
of rape or whatever like in the previous set, but it does record the general question, should

09:44.200 --> 09:48.400
abortion be legal under all circumstances, legal with restrictions, or illegal under

09:48.400 --> 09:50.480
all circumstances for both men and women.

09:50.480 --> 09:55.440
And the data is both identical to the previous paper and just as unchanging over time.

09:55.440 --> 09:59.800
For men, it generally ranges from 50 to 60% believing that abortion should be legal with

09:59.800 --> 10:04.840
restrictions, 20 to 30% believing that abortion should be blanket legal, and 15 to 20% believing

10:04.840 --> 10:06.680
that abortion should be blanket illegal.

10:06.680 --> 10:09.460
And the numbers are pretty much the exact same for women.

10:09.460 --> 10:15.000
As per the data, unrestricted abortion access is simply not as popular as radical leftists

10:15.000 --> 10:16.200
believe that it is.

10:16.200 --> 10:20.060
However, one of the only leftists that I still follow, Merrick, put forward on Twitter an

10:20.060 --> 10:24.920
argument based not in the popularity of democracy and electoralism, but in the much more firm,

10:24.920 --> 10:27.040
libertarian style language of rights.

10:27.040 --> 10:29.560
It's my right to do with my body what I choose.

10:29.560 --> 10:33.400
My life and my health come before the potential life of fetus has and always will.

10:33.400 --> 10:37.840
I and every other already living woman matter more and our body autonomy must be protected.

10:37.840 --> 10:40.200
Now listen, Merrick, it's 2022.

10:40.200 --> 10:41.620
Men can get pregnant too.

10:41.620 --> 10:42.760
But let's be serious here.

10:42.760 --> 10:43.760
You know what?

10:43.760 --> 10:45.440
I actually agree with the sentiment.

10:45.440 --> 10:49.040
The problem is, Merrick, the left has already abandoned the sentiment and your bringing

10:49.040 --> 10:51.340
it up right now feels hollow to me.

10:51.340 --> 10:52.460
Is this you, Merrick?

10:52.460 --> 10:56.780
He's also pro-cop, anti-vaccine mandate and strongly against the legalization of and making

10:56.780 --> 10:57.940
sex work safer.

10:57.940 --> 11:00.700
What happened to people's right to do with their body what they choose?

11:00.700 --> 11:03.340
To be pro-choice means that you should be left alone to choose whether or not you get

11:03.340 --> 11:07.280
an abortion or a vaccine or a food you eat or whether or not you transition or what drugs

11:07.280 --> 11:09.020
you take or who you have sex with.

11:09.020 --> 11:13.520
Either it's society's place to regulate what goes on inside of your body or it isn't, period.

11:13.520 --> 11:16.540
And because I'm personally pro-choice, I say it isn't.

11:16.540 --> 11:19.400
The state should have no opinion on whether or not you get an abortion, just like it should

11:19.400 --> 11:20.900
have no opinion whether or not you get a vaccine.

11:20.900 --> 11:23.980
I can already hear the leftist reply ring in my ears.

11:23.980 --> 11:26.340
But spreading disease is not the same as having kids.

11:26.340 --> 11:27.900
Yeah, that doesn't fly.

11:27.900 --> 11:32.000
When you say spreading a disease, you're appealing to the greater good, the social concern.

11:32.000 --> 11:35.380
You are saying the collective's interest trumped the rights of the individual to control what

11:35.380 --> 11:36.460
goes on in their body.

11:36.460 --> 11:40.860
If that's the case, if you don't value bodily autonomy as its own inviolable right, then

11:40.860 --> 11:44.780
you don't actually have any abortion rights as long as the collective deems it necessary

11:44.780 --> 11:45.780
to trump them.

11:45.780 --> 11:48.860
If COVID was an extreme enough situation to push for the violation of people's bodily

11:48.860 --> 11:52.580
integrity for the greater good, then all it takes is a sufficiently extreme enough

11:52.580 --> 11:58.140
situation to violate your right not to have kids, and poof, your abortion rights disappear.

11:58.140 --> 12:01.500
That is the difference between your average leftoid like Merrick and me.

12:01.500 --> 12:05.020
She appears to value bodily autonomy only when it's in her political interests.

12:05.020 --> 12:07.380
For her, it's not a virtue in and of itself.

12:07.380 --> 12:11.380
It is a downstream effect from what she actually wants, and it can be discarded for political

12:11.380 --> 12:12.380
expediency.

12:12.380 --> 12:16.620
I value bodily autonomy a priori, and I think any restrictions on it have to be a whole

12:16.620 --> 12:19.620
lot more serious than anything COVID related.

12:19.620 --> 12:20.900
But this is where we are.

12:20.900 --> 12:25.420
The entire left abandoned my body, my choice during the huge vaccine push.

12:25.420 --> 12:29.340
I saw many a leftist advocating for not taking the vax to be illegal, so to watch them fall

12:29.340 --> 12:31.820
back on it now is just hypocritical.

12:31.820 --> 12:33.780
But being hypocritical is consistent for the left.

12:33.780 --> 12:36.740
They have a history of violating rights for political expediency.

12:36.740 --> 12:38.580
Socialists do it for the right to property.

12:38.580 --> 12:40.340
Progs do it for the right to guns.

12:40.340 --> 12:41.940
Both do it for speech.

12:41.940 --> 12:44.260
Violating bodily autonomy is just ticking off another box.

12:44.260 --> 12:46.060
There's no principal position for the left here.

12:46.060 --> 12:49.500
They're just screeching about how they want what they want, with no foundation to stand

12:49.500 --> 12:54.020
on, no virtues to appeal to, just naked opportunism and gnashing of teeth now that they've failed.

12:54.020 --> 12:57.180
I sometimes feel like the only pro-choice person with a brain.

12:57.180 --> 13:01.240
The reason that the right rebels against Roe v. Wade is because it wasn't voted on.

13:01.240 --> 13:04.500
If abortion legislation was put forward and if the Republicans lost the vote, it might

13:04.500 --> 13:06.780
be bitter, but I don't think it would be this bitter.

13:06.780 --> 13:08.260
But Roe v. Wade isn't legislation.

13:08.260 --> 13:12.340
It's a poorly crafted, unjustifiable court decision that was bound to eventually fail.

13:12.340 --> 13:16.020
If you are a leftoid listening to this, consider the situation from the rightoid point of view.

13:16.060 --> 13:17.820
He lives in a red state.

13:17.820 --> 13:18.820
He's anti-abortion.

13:18.820 --> 13:20.220
All the people he knows are anti-abortion.

13:20.220 --> 13:21.240
He believes that it's murder.

13:21.240 --> 13:23.100
He believes that his government sponsors murder.

13:23.100 --> 13:25.840
His state legislature opposes it, but they can't do anything.

13:25.840 --> 13:29.260
His vote to stop it is useless because it was never actually voted on.

13:29.260 --> 13:33.380
It was simply imposed by the federal government, halfway across the continent, which he believes

13:33.380 --> 13:35.980
to be corrupt at best and illegitimate at worst.

13:35.980 --> 13:40.060
Of course, such a person would obviously rebel against Roe v. Wade in any way he can.

13:40.060 --> 13:43.300
He feels like, against the will of everybody he knows in his local government, that they

13:43.300 --> 13:47.700
are all a party to state-sanctioned genocide, enforced upon them at gunpoint by a bunch

13:47.700 --> 13:51.620
of coastal elites who don't know or care about or anything related to his life.

13:51.620 --> 13:56.060
And the leftists, instead of, say, talking to these people, understanding them, convincing

13:56.060 --> 14:00.180
them, converting them, these pro-choice people who should have been positive advocates for

14:00.180 --> 14:04.860
their position, who should have stuck by that bodily autonomy principle, instead, they shriek

14:04.860 --> 14:09.020
at the top of their lungs, shout your abortion, shout your abortion, subvert the system, smash

14:09.020 --> 14:11.860
the patriarchy, be as publicly immoral as possible.

14:11.860 --> 14:13.500
Did that convince the rightoids?

14:13.500 --> 14:17.860
Well, maybe only that they were correct to call you demons, along with driving away anybody

14:17.860 --> 14:19.240
who might have been on the fence, too.

14:19.240 --> 14:22.860
If you want people to join your cause, and you should, you need to extend a hand to them.

14:22.860 --> 14:26.640
You are asking them to move to your position, but that means that the burden is on you to

14:26.640 --> 14:27.640
ease them into it.

14:27.640 --> 14:31.400
You have to give them a lifeline that, in their own time, they can use to pull themselves

14:31.400 --> 14:32.400
into your camp.

14:32.400 --> 14:36.580
If all you do is screech and shout about how they're bigots for not immediately thinking

14:36.580 --> 14:39.780
like you, becoming a copy of you, they're just not going to join you.

14:39.780 --> 14:41.660
But that is the bed that the left has made.

14:41.660 --> 14:45.320
The left wanted it all, and they openly violated all of their stated principles to get it.

14:45.320 --> 14:48.780
Bodily autonomy used to be a concrete stance, something that you could really plant a flag

14:48.780 --> 14:49.780
on.

14:49.780 --> 14:52.900
It was my body, my choice, not my body, my choice.

14:52.900 --> 14:53.900
Terms and conditions apply.

14:53.900 --> 14:57.140
And unfortunately, when the left violated that principle during COVID, they lost the

14:57.140 --> 15:00.780
support of anybody who considered hypocrisy to be disgusting, and that is the majority

15:00.780 --> 15:01.780
of people.

15:01.780 --> 15:04.980
The end result will be that, in their pursuit of everything, the left is quite likely to

15:04.980 --> 15:05.820
get nothing at all.
