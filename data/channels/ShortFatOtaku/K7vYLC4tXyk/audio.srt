1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,440
Oh god, you guys, I know this is a preemption to a regularly scheduled topic, but I've been

2
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:12,160
trolling Twitter all day.

3
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:13,880
Look at these masterpieces.

4
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:17,360
Only one of them kind of took off, but they're all my babies and I love them dearly.

5
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:20,040
Yeah, when I get a new Twitter account, I'll let you know.

6
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:22,720
Speaking of babies though, we're here to talk about abortion.

7
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:27,760
Now I did an abortion video like five years ago, where I tried to, as neutrally as possible,

8
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:29,740
examine the arguments of both sides.

9
00:00:29,740 --> 00:00:33,280
I think I did an okay job of it all things considered, and even though it's old, I still

10
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:34,420
think you should go back and watch it.

11
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:38,580
I got a couple of things wrong, most notably that repeated abortions don't cause medical

12
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:39,580
problems.

13
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:41,060
They do, though the number has to be quite high.

14
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:44,300
Also, I predicted COVID back in February of 2018.

15
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:48,100
Do bodily autonomy rights not also include the right to not get a vaccination?

16
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:50,780
Is a vaccination needle not also a foreign object?

17
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:55,140
It seems to be a huge contradiction to me that people who champion bodily autonomy so

18
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:59,060
much would also force people to get vaccinations if given the chance.

19
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:00,780
Just call me Dev Stradamus.

20
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:05,220
But the reason that we're talking about this again is because Roe v. Wade just got hit

21
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:06,420
with a huge blow.

22
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:09,220
Supreme Court has voted to overturn abortion rights.

23
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:10,500
Draft opinion shows.

24
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:15,580
We hold that Roe and Casey must be overruled, Justice Alito writes, in an initial majority

25
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:17,260
draft circulated inside the court.

26
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:21,380
This is a draft, meaning that Roe v. Wade hasn't been overturned yet, but it's probably

27
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:22,460
coming down the pipe.

28
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:28,160
The draft opinion is a full-throated, unflinching reputation of the 1973 decision, which guaranteed

29
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:32,640
federal constitutional protections of abortion rights, and a subsequent 1992 decision, Planned

30
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:36,200
Parenthood v. Casey, that largely maintained those rights.

31
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:40,860
Roe was egregiously wrong from the start, Alito writes, we hold that Roe and Casey must

32
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:41,860
be overruled.

33
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:44,060
The document is labeled the opinion of the court.

34
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:48,360
It is time to heed the Constitution and return the issue of abortion to the people's elected

35
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:49,360
representatives.

36
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:53,080
Everybody who's watched me for a while knows that I'm pro-choice, but even I can't

37
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:54,260
argue with this logic.

38
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:57,140
Roe v. Wade is known for being notoriously bad.

39
00:01:57,140 --> 00:02:01,820
It, out of nowhere, tied state regulation of abortion to the three trimesters of pregnancy,

40
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:05,700
where, during the first trimester, governments could not prohibit abortions at all, during

41
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:09,680
the second trimester, governments could require reasonable health regulations, and during

42
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:14,840
the third trimester, abortions could be prohibited entirely so long as the laws contained exemptions

43
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:18,020
for cases where they were necessary to save the life or health of the mother.

44
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:22,220
The point of the Supreme Court is to judge whether or not the law being contested violates

45
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:25,540
the Constitution, not to spin up new rules whole cloth.

46
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:29,580
Nothing in the Constitution talks about trimesters or abortion, nor any previous ruling.

47
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:33,660
The proper way to implement abortion rights was always through writing new legislation,

48
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:37,020
not relying on a court case resting on shaky ground for 50 years.

49
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:38,020
And you know what?

50
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:39,940
The salt online is pretty incredible.

51
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:45,140
The GOP hates women and is sentencing an entire generation to death.

52
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:47,260
It seems like it's doing the opposite of that, buddy.

53
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:50,580
It seems like an entirely new generation of kids are going to be born.

54
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:55,920
An extremist Supreme Court is poised to overturn Roe v. Wade and impose its far-right, unpopular

55
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,480
views on the entire country.

56
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:01,000
It's time for the millions who support the Constitution and abortion rights to stand

57
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,340
up and make their voices heard.

58
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:03,560
We're not going back.

59
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:05,300
So what do you want to do about it, Pocahontas?

60
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:07,540
Are you going to riot in the Capitol building?

61
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:10,700
One of the most disgraceful decisions in the history of the United States.

62
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:15,060
Rather than conserving Roe v. Wade, the use of conserve there is lifting a lot of weight,

63
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:17,300
which has been reaffirmed repeatedly for decades.

64
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:22,380
These reactionaries disguised as conservatives have chosen to radically dismantle a core

65
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:23,380
constitutional right.

66
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:25,220
What do you think conservatives are?

67
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:27,160
Do you think they share your values?

68
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:30,280
Do you not understand that they have their own vision of the future?

69
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:35,700
And do you actually think that a core constitutional right is a rickety court precedent not even

70
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:37,520
found in the Constitution?

71
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:42,360
Fuck every single one of these liberals who are blaming Jill Stein and third-party voters

72
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:47,280
instead of their useless corporate party who could have codified abortion rights into law.

73
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:50,040
Instead of using it as a cudgel to fundraise in every election.

74
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:51,280
I'm not even going to comment on this one.

75
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:55,620
I'm just going to stop recording for 15 minutes and masturbate to the sound of commie tears.

76
00:03:55,620 --> 00:04:01,460
Fuck Christians and their never-ending imperialistic, nationalistic, fascist patriarchy that puts

77
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:05,320
people's lives at risk and doesn't give a shit about anyone or the science says the

78
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:06,720
science.

79
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,480
Shame on all who hold the cross.

80
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:12,160
Two thousand years of genocide continues tonight.

81
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,160
Fuck you.

82
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:18,440
Hey, uh, Rabbi, is this why people are chanting abortion is a mitzvah at the Supreme Court

83
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:19,440
right now?

84
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,640
Yes, there is a lot of stuff to point fun at online right now.

85
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:24,280
That could be a whole video on its own, just having a laugh.

86
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:27,700
But people are actually protesting at the Supreme Court right now with barricades preset

87
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:28,700
up for the event.

88
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:30,340
My Spidey sense is tingling.

89
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:33,400
Has there ever been a court draft leaked quite like this?

90
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:35,680
The draft was apparently written in February, so why leak it now?

91
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:40,640
I have a feeling this was leaked by some left-leaning, low-level staffer in order to galvanize the

92
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:44,240
midterm vote, because 2022 is legitimately looking like a red wave.

93
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:47,440
The Dems needed something to get their base riled up, and a leak like this would absolutely

94
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:48,440
do the trick.

95
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:51,620
The issue ultimately is, though, the naked hypocrisy of the whole thing.

96
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:55,080
And no, I don't mean Joe Biden spending most of his career being against abortion

97
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:57,120
before inexplicably shifting in his old age.

98
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,180
That's clearly just moving with the political winds of his party.

99
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:03,580
In 1992, Bill Clinton coined the phrase safe, legal, and rare.

100
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:07,600
That was to be the compromise between conservatives and progressives on the legality of abortion.

101
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:11,800
Clinton spent his political career in the 80s as being anti-abortion on a personal level,

102
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:15,620
but he also recognized that he wasn't everyone, and there was a segment of the population

103
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:17,520
voting for him that wanted abortion.

104
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,360
And that phrase worked wonders.

105
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,080
Safety is something that both sides can get behind.

106
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:24,660
The danger of back-alley abortions would be remedied by the care and protection of a legitimate

107
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:26,300
clinic or doctor's office.

108
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:27,500
Legal was for the progressives.

109
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:30,380
That safety could not be left to the vagueness of human emotion.

110
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:31,680
It must be codified.

111
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,260
And rare was for the conservatives.

112
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:36,700
The people who found abortion to be morally reprehensible would at least be comforted by

113
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:38,900
the fact that it would only happen when necessary.

114
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:42,960
There would always be hardliners on the right who want no abortion whatsoever.

115
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,780
And if you believe abortion to constitute death, fair enough.

116
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:49,500
But no matter what topic it is, the political game never gives you an option that leads

117
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:50,500
to no deaths.

118
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:52,200
The best you can aim for is a minimum.

119
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:56,680
There would also always be equivalent hardliners on the left who would want no restrictions

120
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:57,680
on abortion at all.

121
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:01,100
And while the right's hardliners remained shut out from the conversation, largely ignored

122
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:04,940
by the mainstream right, mainly due to their political violence, the left's hardliners

123
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:06,660
became the mainstream left.

124
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:11,020
That's why the compromise of safe, legal and rare became the grotesque shout your abortion.

125
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:14,760
And why people began to celebrate their ever increasing number of abortions, despite it

126
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:17,780
being cringey and embarrassing and kind of gross.

127
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:20,080
But safe, legal and rare was the compromise.

128
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:23,780
And when the left violated the rare part of that compromise, they should not have been

129
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:26,940
surprised when the right began to violate the legal part of it.

130
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:29,940
When you ask the question, is it good to ban abortion?

131
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:33,900
The conservative will say, yes, of course, life begins its conception.

132
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:35,780
And by some metrics, it very clearly does.

133
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:40,580
Meanwhile, the progressive will say, no, of course, women have the right to bodily autonomy.

134
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:44,000
And if you believe in natural rights, then yeah, women clearly do.

135
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,660
What can the liberal who is caught in the middle say to this?

136
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:49,540
The liberals compromise was safe, legal and rare.

137
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:53,260
The progressives have violated it by pushing to end the rare part and the conservatives

138
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:57,240
are now counter violating it in turn by pushing to end the legal part.

139
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:02,400
Your average person, your normie, your unaligned, disengaged, nominally liberal type generally

140
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,760
views abortion as a necessary evil.

141
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:07,080
They don't want it abolished, but they don't want it normalized.

142
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:10,240
And with the progressive commitment to its rarity off the table, it seems like their

143
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:14,080
only option to ensure that abortion is a rare event is to make it illegal.

144
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:16,800
The progressives have left them no other choice.

145
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:20,760
And yes, most people do view abortions as a necessary evil.

146
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:25,080
Here's a report from the University of Chicago titled Trends in Public Attitudes Towards

147
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:28,680
Abortion, containing data from 1972 to 2012.

148
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:30,200
Here's the information we can glean from it.

149
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:34,120
The progressive view that the abortion argument is simply pro-life men oppressing pro-choice

150
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:37,560
women who have no place to be making these decisions is just false.

151
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:42,400
While men are more likely to self-ID as pro-life and women as pro-choice, they actually answer

152
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:46,960
all of the upcoming questions almost exactly the same, with on average only a 5% difference

153
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:47,960
between the two.

154
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:52,120
In general, men and women seem to hold the same views on topics related to abortion.

155
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:57,580
71.5% of men and 69.4% of women said that abortion should be legal if there is a strong

156
00:07:57,580 --> 00:08:00,200
possibility of a serious fetal defect.

157
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:07,020
83.1% of men and 43.3% of women say that abortion should be legal for married women who don't

158
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:08,020
want more children.

159
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:15,200
83.5% of men and 82.6% of women say that abortion should be legal if a woman's life is in danger

160
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,200
by the pregnancy.

161
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:21,600
40.4% of men and 40.9% of women say that abortion should be legal if a woman can't afford to

162
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,040
have a kid right now.

163
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:28,920
54.9% and 55.3% respectively say that it should be illegal in that circumstance.

164
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:35,280
If the pregnancy is a result of rape, 71.1% of men and 72.8% of women say that abortion

165
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:36,320
should be legal.

166
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:41,380
Only 39% of both men and women said that abortion should be legally allowed in cases where the

167
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:42,380
woman is unmarried.

168
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:46,520
52.6% of men and 56.8% of women said that it should be illegal.

169
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:52,080
40% of men and 43.2% of women said that abortion should be legal for any reason.

170
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:57,720
57.9% of men and 54.2% of women said that it should be illegal for any reason.

171
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:01,940
This data basically shows that large majorities of Americans believe that abortion should

172
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:06,400
be legal in instances of rape, incest, and the life of the mother, which is the most

173
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:10,360
popular Republican sloganeering on the topic, but also along with fetal defects, something

174
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:11,880
that Republicans tend to ignore.

175
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:16,900
It is a not small minority, but still a minority of both women and men hovering around 40%

176
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:20,420
that believes abortion should simply be on demand with no restrictions.

177
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:23,100
Of course, this data only goes up to 2012.

178
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:26,960
It's entirely possible for attitudes to have changed drastically over the past 10 years,

179
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:31,200
even though those attitudes remained solidly consistent from 1972 to 2012.

180
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:35,440
There's more generalized data available on Pew Research that does go all the way up

181
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,440
to 2021.

182
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:40,040
It doesn't break it down by specific questions, like should abortion be legal in the case

183
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:44,200
of rape or whatever like in the previous set, but it does record the general question, should

184
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:48,400
abortion be legal under all circumstances, legal with restrictions, or illegal under

185
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:50,480
all circumstances for both men and women.

186
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:55,440
And the data is both identical to the previous paper and just as unchanging over time.

187
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:59,800
For men, it generally ranges from 50 to 60% believing that abortion should be legal with

188
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:04,840
restrictions, 20 to 30% believing that abortion should be blanket legal, and 15 to 20% believing

189
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:06,680
that abortion should be blanket illegal.

190
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:09,460
And the numbers are pretty much the exact same for women.

191
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:15,000
As per the data, unrestricted abortion access is simply not as popular as radical leftists

192
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,200
believe that it is.

193
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:20,060
However, one of the only leftists that I still follow, Merrick, put forward on Twitter an

194
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:24,920
argument based not in the popularity of democracy and electoralism, but in the much more firm,

195
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:27,040
libertarian style language of rights.

196
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:29,560
It's my right to do with my body what I choose.

197
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:33,400
My life and my health come before the potential life of fetus has and always will.

198
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:37,840
I and every other already living woman matter more and our body autonomy must be protected.

199
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:40,200
Now listen, Merrick, it's 2022.

200
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,620
Men can get pregnant too.

201
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:42,760
But let's be serious here.

202
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:43,760
You know what?

203
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,440
I actually agree with the sentiment.

204
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:49,040
The problem is, Merrick, the left has already abandoned the sentiment and your bringing

205
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,340
it up right now feels hollow to me.

206
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:52,460
Is this you, Merrick?

207
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:56,780
He's also pro-cop, anti-vaccine mandate and strongly against the legalization of and making

208
00:10:56,780 --> 00:10:57,940
sex work safer.

209
00:10:57,940 --> 00:11:00,700
What happened to people's right to do with their body what they choose?

210
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:03,340
To be pro-choice means that you should be left alone to choose whether or not you get

211
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:07,280
an abortion or a vaccine or a food you eat or whether or not you transition or what drugs

212
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:09,020
you take or who you have sex with.

213
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:13,520
Either it's society's place to regulate what goes on inside of your body or it isn't, period.

214
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:16,540
And because I'm personally pro-choice, I say it isn't.

215
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:19,400
The state should have no opinion on whether or not you get an abortion, just like it should

216
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:20,900
have no opinion whether or not you get a vaccine.

217
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:23,980
I can already hear the leftist reply ring in my ears.

218
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:26,340
But spreading disease is not the same as having kids.

219
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:27,900
Yeah, that doesn't fly.

220
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:32,000
When you say spreading a disease, you're appealing to the greater good, the social concern.

221
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,380
You are saying the collective's interest trumped the rights of the individual to control what

222
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:36,460
goes on in their body.

223
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:40,860
If that's the case, if you don't value bodily autonomy as its own inviolable right, then

224
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:44,780
you don't actually have any abortion rights as long as the collective deems it necessary

225
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:45,780
to trump them.

226
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:48,860
If COVID was an extreme enough situation to push for the violation of people's bodily

227
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:52,580
integrity for the greater good, then all it takes is a sufficiently extreme enough

228
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:58,140
situation to violate your right not to have kids, and poof, your abortion rights disappear.

229
00:11:58,140 --> 00:12:01,500
That is the difference between your average leftoid like Merrick and me.

230
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:05,020
She appears to value bodily autonomy only when it's in her political interests.

231
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:07,380
For her, it's not a virtue in and of itself.

232
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:11,380
It is a downstream effect from what she actually wants, and it can be discarded for political

233
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:12,380
expediency.

234
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:16,620
I value bodily autonomy a priori, and I think any restrictions on it have to be a whole

235
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:19,620
lot more serious than anything COVID related.

236
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:20,900
But this is where we are.

237
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:25,420
The entire left abandoned my body, my choice during the huge vaccine push.

238
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:29,340
I saw many a leftist advocating for not taking the vax to be illegal, so to watch them fall

239
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:31,820
back on it now is just hypocritical.

240
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:33,780
But being hypocritical is consistent for the left.

241
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:36,740
They have a history of violating rights for political expediency.

242
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:38,580
Socialists do it for the right to property.

243
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:40,340
Progs do it for the right to guns.

244
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:41,940
Both do it for speech.

245
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:44,260
Violating bodily autonomy is just ticking off another box.

246
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:46,060
There's no principal position for the left here.

247
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:49,500
They're just screeching about how they want what they want, with no foundation to stand

248
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:54,020
on, no virtues to appeal to, just naked opportunism and gnashing of teeth now that they've failed.

249
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:57,180
I sometimes feel like the only pro-choice person with a brain.

250
00:12:57,180 --> 00:13:01,240
The reason that the right rebels against Roe v. Wade is because it wasn't voted on.

251
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:04,500
If abortion legislation was put forward and if the Republicans lost the vote, it might

252
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:06,780
be bitter, but I don't think it would be this bitter.

253
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:08,260
But Roe v. Wade isn't legislation.

254
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:12,340
It's a poorly crafted, unjustifiable court decision that was bound to eventually fail.

255
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:16,020
If you are a leftoid listening to this, consider the situation from the rightoid point of view.

256
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:17,820
He lives in a red state.

257
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:18,820
He's anti-abortion.

258
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:20,220
All the people he knows are anti-abortion.

259
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:21,240
He believes that it's murder.

260
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:23,100
He believes that his government sponsors murder.

261
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:25,840
His state legislature opposes it, but they can't do anything.

262
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:29,260
His vote to stop it is useless because it was never actually voted on.

263
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:33,380
It was simply imposed by the federal government, halfway across the continent, which he believes

264
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:35,980
to be corrupt at best and illegitimate at worst.

265
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:40,060
Of course, such a person would obviously rebel against Roe v. Wade in any way he can.

266
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:43,300
He feels like, against the will of everybody he knows in his local government, that they

267
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:47,700
are all a party to state-sanctioned genocide, enforced upon them at gunpoint by a bunch

268
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:51,620
of coastal elites who don't know or care about or anything related to his life.

269
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:56,060
And the leftists, instead of, say, talking to these people, understanding them, convincing

270
00:13:56,060 --> 00:14:00,180
them, converting them, these pro-choice people who should have been positive advocates for

271
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:04,860
their position, who should have stuck by that bodily autonomy principle, instead, they shriek

272
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:09,020
at the top of their lungs, shout your abortion, shout your abortion, subvert the system, smash

273
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:11,860
the patriarchy, be as publicly immoral as possible.

274
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:13,500
Did that convince the rightoids?

275
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:17,860
Well, maybe only that they were correct to call you demons, along with driving away anybody

276
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:19,240
who might have been on the fence, too.

277
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:22,860
If you want people to join your cause, and you should, you need to extend a hand to them.

278
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:26,640
You are asking them to move to your position, but that means that the burden is on you to

279
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:27,640
ease them into it.

280
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:31,400
You have to give them a lifeline that, in their own time, they can use to pull themselves

281
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:32,400
into your camp.

282
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:36,580
If all you do is screech and shout about how they're bigots for not immediately thinking

283
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:39,780
like you, becoming a copy of you, they're just not going to join you.

284
00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:41,660
But that is the bed that the left has made.

285
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:45,320
The left wanted it all, and they openly violated all of their stated principles to get it.

286
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:48,780
Bodily autonomy used to be a concrete stance, something that you could really plant a flag

287
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:49,780
on.

288
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:52,900
It was my body, my choice, not my body, my choice.

289
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:53,900
Terms and conditions apply.

290
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:57,140
And unfortunately, when the left violated that principle during COVID, they lost the

291
00:14:57,140 --> 00:15:00,780
support of anybody who considered hypocrisy to be disgusting, and that is the majority

292
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:01,780
of people.

293
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:04,980
The end result will be that, in their pursuit of everything, the left is quite likely to

294
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:05,820
get nothing at all.
