0	10440	Oh god, you guys, I know this is a preemption to a regularly scheduled topic, but I've been
10440	12160	trolling Twitter all day.
12160	13880	Look at these masterpieces.
13880	17360	Only one of them kind of took off, but they're all my babies and I love them dearly.
17360	20040	Yeah, when I get a new Twitter account, I'll let you know.
20040	22720	Speaking of babies though, we're here to talk about abortion.
22720	27760	Now I did an abortion video like five years ago, where I tried to, as neutrally as possible,
27760	29740	examine the arguments of both sides.
29740	33280	I think I did an okay job of it all things considered, and even though it's old, I still
33280	34420	think you should go back and watch it.
34420	38580	I got a couple of things wrong, most notably that repeated abortions don't cause medical
38580	39580	problems.
39580	41060	They do, though the number has to be quite high.
41060	44300	Also, I predicted COVID back in February of 2018.
44300	48100	Do bodily autonomy rights not also include the right to not get a vaccination?
48100	50780	Is a vaccination needle not also a foreign object?
50780	55140	It seems to be a huge contradiction to me that people who champion bodily autonomy so
55140	59060	much would also force people to get vaccinations if given the chance.
59060	60780	Just call me Dev Stradamus.
60780	65220	But the reason that we're talking about this again is because Roe v. Wade just got hit
65220	66420	with a huge blow.
66420	69220	Supreme Court has voted to overturn abortion rights.
69220	70500	Draft opinion shows.
70500	75580	We hold that Roe and Casey must be overruled, Justice Alito writes, in an initial majority
75580	77260	draft circulated inside the court.
77260	81380	This is a draft, meaning that Roe v. Wade hasn't been overturned yet, but it's probably
81380	82460	coming down the pipe.
82460	88160	The draft opinion is a full-throated, unflinching reputation of the 1973 decision, which guaranteed
88160	92640	federal constitutional protections of abortion rights, and a subsequent 1992 decision, Planned
92640	96200	Parenthood v. Casey, that largely maintained those rights.
96200	100860	Roe was egregiously wrong from the start, Alito writes, we hold that Roe and Casey must
100860	101860	be overruled.
101860	104060	The document is labeled the opinion of the court.
104060	108360	It is time to heed the Constitution and return the issue of abortion to the people's elected
108360	109360	representatives.
109360	113080	Everybody who's watched me for a while knows that I'm pro-choice, but even I can't
113080	114260	argue with this logic.
114260	117140	Roe v. Wade is known for being notoriously bad.
117140	121820	It, out of nowhere, tied state regulation of abortion to the three trimesters of pregnancy,
121820	125700	where, during the first trimester, governments could not prohibit abortions at all, during
125700	129680	the second trimester, governments could require reasonable health regulations, and during
129680	134840	the third trimester, abortions could be prohibited entirely so long as the laws contained exemptions
134840	138020	for cases where they were necessary to save the life or health of the mother.
138020	142220	The point of the Supreme Court is to judge whether or not the law being contested violates
142220	145540	the Constitution, not to spin up new rules whole cloth.
145540	149580	Nothing in the Constitution talks about trimesters or abortion, nor any previous ruling.
149580	153660	The proper way to implement abortion rights was always through writing new legislation,
153660	157020	not relying on a court case resting on shaky ground for 50 years.
157020	158020	And you know what?
158020	159940	The salt online is pretty incredible.
159940	165140	The GOP hates women and is sentencing an entire generation to death.
165140	167260	It seems like it's doing the opposite of that, buddy.
167260	170580	It seems like an entirely new generation of kids are going to be born.
170580	175920	An extremist Supreme Court is poised to overturn Roe v. Wade and impose its far-right, unpopular
175920	177480	views on the entire country.
177480	181000	It's time for the millions who support the Constitution and abortion rights to stand
181000	182340	up and make their voices heard.
182340	183560	We're not going back.
183560	185300	So what do you want to do about it, Pocahontas?
185300	187540	Are you going to riot in the Capitol building?
187540	190700	One of the most disgraceful decisions in the history of the United States.
190700	195060	Rather than conserving Roe v. Wade, the use of conserve there is lifting a lot of weight,
195060	197300	which has been reaffirmed repeatedly for decades.
197300	202380	These reactionaries disguised as conservatives have chosen to radically dismantle a core
202380	203380	constitutional right.
203380	205220	What do you think conservatives are?
205220	207160	Do you think they share your values?
207160	210280	Do you not understand that they have their own vision of the future?
210280	215700	And do you actually think that a core constitutional right is a rickety court precedent not even
215700	217520	found in the Constitution?
217520	222360	Fuck every single one of these liberals who are blaming Jill Stein and third-party voters
222360	227280	instead of their useless corporate party who could have codified abortion rights into law.
227280	230040	Instead of using it as a cudgel to fundraise in every election.
230040	231280	I'm not even going to comment on this one.
231280	235620	I'm just going to stop recording for 15 minutes and masturbate to the sound of commie tears.
235620	241460	Fuck Christians and their never-ending imperialistic, nationalistic, fascist patriarchy that puts
241460	245320	people's lives at risk and doesn't give a shit about anyone or the science says the
245320	246720	science.
246720	248480	Shame on all who hold the cross.
248480	252160	Two thousand years of genocide continues tonight.
252160	253160	Fuck you.
253160	258440	Hey, uh, Rabbi, is this why people are chanting abortion is a mitzvah at the Supreme Court
258440	259440	right now?
259440	261640	Yes, there is a lot of stuff to point fun at online right now.
261640	264280	That could be a whole video on its own, just having a laugh.
264280	267700	But people are actually protesting at the Supreme Court right now with barricades preset
267700	268700	up for the event.
268700	270340	My Spidey sense is tingling.
270340	273400	Has there ever been a court draft leaked quite like this?
273400	275680	The draft was apparently written in February, so why leak it now?
275680	280640	I have a feeling this was leaked by some left-leaning, low-level staffer in order to galvanize the
280640	284240	midterm vote, because 2022 is legitimately looking like a red wave.
284240	287440	The Dems needed something to get their base riled up, and a leak like this would absolutely
287440	288440	do the trick.
288440	291620	The issue ultimately is, though, the naked hypocrisy of the whole thing.
291620	295080	And no, I don't mean Joe Biden spending most of his career being against abortion
295080	297120	before inexplicably shifting in his old age.
297120	299180	That's clearly just moving with the political winds of his party.
299180	303580	In 1992, Bill Clinton coined the phrase safe, legal, and rare.
303580	307600	That was to be the compromise between conservatives and progressives on the legality of abortion.
307600	311800	Clinton spent his political career in the 80s as being anti-abortion on a personal level,
311800	315620	but he also recognized that he wasn't everyone, and there was a segment of the population
315620	317520	voting for him that wanted abortion.
317520	319360	And that phrase worked wonders.
319360	321080	Safety is something that both sides can get behind.
321080	324660	The danger of back-alley abortions would be remedied by the care and protection of a legitimate
324660	326300	clinic or doctor's office.
326300	327500	Legal was for the progressives.
327500	330380	That safety could not be left to the vagueness of human emotion.
330380	331680	It must be codified.
331680	333260	And rare was for the conservatives.
333260	336700	The people who found abortion to be morally reprehensible would at least be comforted by
336700	338900	the fact that it would only happen when necessary.
338900	342960	There would always be hardliners on the right who want no abortion whatsoever.
342960	345780	And if you believe abortion to constitute death, fair enough.
345780	349500	But no matter what topic it is, the political game never gives you an option that leads
349500	350500	to no deaths.
350500	352200	The best you can aim for is a minimum.
352200	356680	There would also always be equivalent hardliners on the left who would want no restrictions
356680	357680	on abortion at all.
357680	361100	And while the right's hardliners remained shut out from the conversation, largely ignored
361100	364940	by the mainstream right, mainly due to their political violence, the left's hardliners
364940	366660	became the mainstream left.
366660	371020	That's why the compromise of safe, legal and rare became the grotesque shout your abortion.
371020	374760	And why people began to celebrate their ever increasing number of abortions, despite it
374760	377780	being cringey and embarrassing and kind of gross.
377780	380080	But safe, legal and rare was the compromise.
380080	383780	And when the left violated the rare part of that compromise, they should not have been
383780	386940	surprised when the right began to violate the legal part of it.
386940	389940	When you ask the question, is it good to ban abortion?
389940	393900	The conservative will say, yes, of course, life begins its conception.
393900	395780	And by some metrics, it very clearly does.
395900	400580	Meanwhile, the progressive will say, no, of course, women have the right to bodily autonomy.
400580	404000	And if you believe in natural rights, then yeah, women clearly do.
404000	406660	What can the liberal who is caught in the middle say to this?
406660	409540	The liberals compromise was safe, legal and rare.
409540	413260	The progressives have violated it by pushing to end the rare part and the conservatives
413260	417240	are now counter violating it in turn by pushing to end the legal part.
417240	422400	Your average person, your normie, your unaligned, disengaged, nominally liberal type generally
422400	424760	views abortion as a necessary evil.
424760	427080	They don't want it abolished, but they don't want it normalized.
427080	430240	And with the progressive commitment to its rarity off the table, it seems like their
430240	434080	only option to ensure that abortion is a rare event is to make it illegal.
434080	436800	The progressives have left them no other choice.
436800	440760	And yes, most people do view abortions as a necessary evil.
440760	445080	Here's a report from the University of Chicago titled Trends in Public Attitudes Towards
445080	448680	Abortion, containing data from 1972 to 2012.
448680	450200	Here's the information we can glean from it.
450200	454120	The progressive view that the abortion argument is simply pro-life men oppressing pro-choice
454120	457560	women who have no place to be making these decisions is just false.
457560	462400	While men are more likely to self-ID as pro-life and women as pro-choice, they actually answer
462400	466960	all of the upcoming questions almost exactly the same, with on average only a 5% difference
466960	467960	between the two.
467960	472120	In general, men and women seem to hold the same views on topics related to abortion.
472120	477580	71.5% of men and 69.4% of women said that abortion should be legal if there is a strong
477580	480200	possibility of a serious fetal defect.
480200	487020	83.1% of men and 43.3% of women say that abortion should be legal for married women who don't
487020	488020	want more children.
488020	495200	83.5% of men and 82.6% of women say that abortion should be legal if a woman's life is in danger
495200	496200	by the pregnancy.
496200	501600	40.4% of men and 40.9% of women say that abortion should be legal if a woman can't afford to
501600	503040	have a kid right now.
503040	508920	54.9% and 55.3% respectively say that it should be illegal in that circumstance.
508920	515280	If the pregnancy is a result of rape, 71.1% of men and 72.8% of women say that abortion
515280	516320	should be legal.
516320	521380	Only 39% of both men and women said that abortion should be legally allowed in cases where the
521380	522380	woman is unmarried.
522380	526520	52.6% of men and 56.8% of women said that it should be illegal.
526520	532080	40% of men and 43.2% of women said that abortion should be legal for any reason.
532080	537720	57.9% of men and 54.2% of women said that it should be illegal for any reason.
537720	541940	This data basically shows that large majorities of Americans believe that abortion should
541940	546400	be legal in instances of rape, incest, and the life of the mother, which is the most
546400	550360	popular Republican sloganeering on the topic, but also along with fetal defects, something
550360	551880	that Republicans tend to ignore.
551880	556900	It is a not small minority, but still a minority of both women and men hovering around 40%
556900	560420	that believes abortion should simply be on demand with no restrictions.
560420	563100	Of course, this data only goes up to 2012.
563100	566960	It's entirely possible for attitudes to have changed drastically over the past 10 years,
566960	571200	even though those attitudes remained solidly consistent from 1972 to 2012.
571200	575440	There's more generalized data available on Pew Research that does go all the way up
575440	576440	to 2021.
576440	580040	It doesn't break it down by specific questions, like should abortion be legal in the case
580040	584200	of rape or whatever like in the previous set, but it does record the general question, should
584200	588400	abortion be legal under all circumstances, legal with restrictions, or illegal under
588400	590480	all circumstances for both men and women.
590480	595440	And the data is both identical to the previous paper and just as unchanging over time.
595440	599800	For men, it generally ranges from 50 to 60% believing that abortion should be legal with
599800	604840	restrictions, 20 to 30% believing that abortion should be blanket legal, and 15 to 20% believing
604840	606680	that abortion should be blanket illegal.
606680	609460	And the numbers are pretty much the exact same for women.
609460	615000	As per the data, unrestricted abortion access is simply not as popular as radical leftists
615000	616200	believe that it is.
616200	620060	However, one of the only leftists that I still follow, Merrick, put forward on Twitter an
620060	624920	argument based not in the popularity of democracy and electoralism, but in the much more firm,
624920	627040	libertarian style language of rights.
627040	629560	It's my right to do with my body what I choose.
629560	633400	My life and my health come before the potential life of fetus has and always will.
633400	637840	I and every other already living woman matter more and our body autonomy must be protected.
637840	640200	Now listen, Merrick, it's 2022.
640200	641620	Men can get pregnant too.
641620	642760	But let's be serious here.
642760	643760	You know what?
643760	645440	I actually agree with the sentiment.
645440	649040	The problem is, Merrick, the left has already abandoned the sentiment and your bringing
649040	651340	it up right now feels hollow to me.
651340	652460	Is this you, Merrick?
652460	656780	He's also pro-cop, anti-vaccine mandate and strongly against the legalization of and making
656780	657940	sex work safer.
657940	660700	What happened to people's right to do with their body what they choose?
660700	663340	To be pro-choice means that you should be left alone to choose whether or not you get
663340	667280	an abortion or a vaccine or a food you eat or whether or not you transition or what drugs
667280	669020	you take or who you have sex with.
669020	673520	Either it's society's place to regulate what goes on inside of your body or it isn't, period.
673520	676540	And because I'm personally pro-choice, I say it isn't.
676540	679400	The state should have no opinion on whether or not you get an abortion, just like it should
679400	680900	have no opinion whether or not you get a vaccine.
680900	683980	I can already hear the leftist reply ring in my ears.
683980	686340	But spreading disease is not the same as having kids.
686340	687900	Yeah, that doesn't fly.
687900	692000	When you say spreading a disease, you're appealing to the greater good, the social concern.
692000	695380	You are saying the collective's interest trumped the rights of the individual to control what
695380	696460	goes on in their body.
696460	700860	If that's the case, if you don't value bodily autonomy as its own inviolable right, then
700860	704780	you don't actually have any abortion rights as long as the collective deems it necessary
704780	705780	to trump them.
705780	708860	If COVID was an extreme enough situation to push for the violation of people's bodily
708860	712580	integrity for the greater good, then all it takes is a sufficiently extreme enough
712580	718140	situation to violate your right not to have kids, and poof, your abortion rights disappear.
718140	721500	That is the difference between your average leftoid like Merrick and me.
721500	725020	She appears to value bodily autonomy only when it's in her political interests.
725020	727380	For her, it's not a virtue in and of itself.
727380	731380	It is a downstream effect from what she actually wants, and it can be discarded for political
731380	732380	expediency.
732380	736620	I value bodily autonomy a priori, and I think any restrictions on it have to be a whole
736620	739620	lot more serious than anything COVID related.
739620	740900	But this is where we are.
740900	745420	The entire left abandoned my body, my choice during the huge vaccine push.
745420	749340	I saw many a leftist advocating for not taking the vax to be illegal, so to watch them fall
749340	751820	back on it now is just hypocritical.
751820	753780	But being hypocritical is consistent for the left.
753780	756740	They have a history of violating rights for political expediency.
756740	758580	Socialists do it for the right to property.
758580	760340	Progs do it for the right to guns.
760340	761940	Both do it for speech.
761940	764260	Violating bodily autonomy is just ticking off another box.
764260	766060	There's no principal position for the left here.
766060	769500	They're just screeching about how they want what they want, with no foundation to stand
769500	774020	on, no virtues to appeal to, just naked opportunism and gnashing of teeth now that they've failed.
774020	777180	I sometimes feel like the only pro-choice person with a brain.
777180	781240	The reason that the right rebels against Roe v. Wade is because it wasn't voted on.
781240	784500	If abortion legislation was put forward and if the Republicans lost the vote, it might
784500	786780	be bitter, but I don't think it would be this bitter.
786780	788260	But Roe v. Wade isn't legislation.
788260	792340	It's a poorly crafted, unjustifiable court decision that was bound to eventually fail.
792340	796020	If you are a leftoid listening to this, consider the situation from the rightoid point of view.
796060	797820	He lives in a red state.
797820	798820	He's anti-abortion.
798820	800220	All the people he knows are anti-abortion.
800220	801240	He believes that it's murder.
801240	803100	He believes that his government sponsors murder.
803100	805840	His state legislature opposes it, but they can't do anything.
805840	809260	His vote to stop it is useless because it was never actually voted on.
809260	813380	It was simply imposed by the federal government, halfway across the continent, which he believes
813380	815980	to be corrupt at best and illegitimate at worst.
815980	820060	Of course, such a person would obviously rebel against Roe v. Wade in any way he can.
820060	823300	He feels like, against the will of everybody he knows in his local government, that they
823300	827700	are all a party to state-sanctioned genocide, enforced upon them at gunpoint by a bunch
827700	831620	of coastal elites who don't know or care about or anything related to his life.
831620	836060	And the leftists, instead of, say, talking to these people, understanding them, convincing
836060	840180	them, converting them, these pro-choice people who should have been positive advocates for
840180	844860	their position, who should have stuck by that bodily autonomy principle, instead, they shriek
844860	849020	at the top of their lungs, shout your abortion, shout your abortion, subvert the system, smash
849020	851860	the patriarchy, be as publicly immoral as possible.
851860	853500	Did that convince the rightoids?
853500	857860	Well, maybe only that they were correct to call you demons, along with driving away anybody
857860	859240	who might have been on the fence, too.
859240	862860	If you want people to join your cause, and you should, you need to extend a hand to them.
862860	866640	You are asking them to move to your position, but that means that the burden is on you to
866640	867640	ease them into it.
867640	871400	You have to give them a lifeline that, in their own time, they can use to pull themselves
871400	872400	into your camp.
872400	876580	If all you do is screech and shout about how they're bigots for not immediately thinking
876580	879780	like you, becoming a copy of you, they're just not going to join you.
879780	881660	But that is the bed that the left has made.
881660	885320	The left wanted it all, and they openly violated all of their stated principles to get it.
885320	888780	Bodily autonomy used to be a concrete stance, something that you could really plant a flag
888780	889780	on.
889780	892900	It was my body, my choice, not my body, my choice.
892900	893900	Terms and conditions apply.
893900	897140	And unfortunately, when the left violated that principle during COVID, they lost the
897140	900780	support of anybody who considered hypocrisy to be disgusting, and that is the majority
900780	901780	of people.
901780	904980	The end result will be that, in their pursuit of everything, the left is quite likely to
904980	905820	get nothing at all.
