0	10620	You guys heard about Vertigear? They're the ones who make those mega awful gamer chairs.
10620	14080	You know, they all have different brands on them but they basically just look alike. They're
14080	20260	overpriced, uncomfortable, low quality, and just all around not worth the buy. Yeah, those
20260	25120	guys. Well, regardless of the quality of the product, this happened recently. The official
25120	30560	Vertigear Twitter account posts, is this accurate? And it shows a male streamer. Normal twitch
30560	35420	setup, right? Gameplay, facecam, mic, female streamer. Where it's inverted, the focus is
35420	39600	clearly on the woman and not the gameplay. This is actually just a recreation of this
39600	44040	ancient meme from like 15 years ago. You'd see this floating around all the time on year
44040	49040	1 4chan. It's making fun of a certain little bit of human psychology which, if you're able
49040	53440	to accurately observe the world, you have to admit on some level is true. Not for everyone
53440	59040	obviously but in general. Well of course it's not 2007 anymore, it's 2021. This absolutely
59040	62840	blew up and now everybody is trying to dig into Vertigear to find all the problematic
62840	67560	things they've said. And oh boy are they finding a lot of them. And by a lot of them honestly
67560	73240	it's just regular memes that only terminally online people would complain about. And of
73240	78280	course because it's 2021, after going viral they immediately cucked out, gave in, and
78280	82600	posted a big long tweet about how sorry they are and how they're committed to diversity
82600	86240	and inclusion and blah blah blah. And they posted a second one. But in this one they
86240	90560	actually admitted that the poor intern who was running the account got fired. I mean
90560	94360	there was no reason to ever buy these products before but there's certainly not one now.
94360	98060	To nobody's surprise, Karens are coming out and trying to get the other companies that
98060	103100	work with Vertigear to stop doing so. Said Karen is also accepting donations for her
103100	108640	brave activism. One such individual is Miss Henley TV. You deleted it but you can't pretend
108640	113060	that it wasn't tweeted Vertigear. You owe the women in the industry a major apology.
113060	116840	How dare you say that women only use their looks on Twitch?
116840	121960	Also from Miss Henley, here's her OnlyFans. It's currently 60% off. And she also streams
121960	127640	Call of Duty Black Ops along with a Bikini Pool stream if she gets enough donations.
127640	133440	The exact people who were getting mad at Vertigear for making this post are the very people that
133440	139480	it was criticizing. And if there is a serious problem with Twitch it is the open brazenness
139480	145760	of the thoughts. Some will lie around all day and take donations to fart into their
145760	151520	microphones. Oh and by the way, the farter, the one who's currently writing donators
151520	156760	names on her body. In 2017 she said, I'm ashamed to say that Twitch is a platform that
156760	161120	supports lazy females selling their bodies for cash. You are teaching little girls to
161120	167880	sell sex, make them wear t-shirts and pants, compete on the same playing field as men,
167880	172160	feminism is equality, spread the word. Where did that go? You've got Amaranth making
172160	177840	totally not sexual content, dressing up like this and licking her microphone, or even better
177840	183380	bouncing around on a bed in what looks like some kind of Spiderman costume I think wearing
183380	190120	a horse head. What the fuck are we watching? These two girls did get banned but only temporary.
190120	195160	Felinity is well known for controversy after controversy. She had a nip slip on air, full
195160	201320	on wardrobe malfunction, she's abused animals on stream, throwing her cat around, giving
201320	210400	it vodka, and also her dog decided to inspect a little bit during the stream. Now I don't
210400	214760	know much about dogs but I have heard that dogs generally won't do this unless you train
214760	218520	them to so I don't know how to feel about this one guys.
218520	225440	And man if you guys only knew how to speak other languages. Twitch in Korea is on a whole
225440	231720	other level. You've got people streaming themselves doing lines of cocaine. Some have no problem
231720	252720	admitting to committing crimes on air, no big deal. You've got dudes in full latex
252720	257180	so that you can't actually see any nudity, getting vibrators shoved against their dick
257180	262320	so that they come. But because you can't see anything, it's on Twitch. You've got this
262320	272320	one channel here, Hot Underscore Ghee, streaming Russian fetish porn. Oh and by the way, the
272320	276200	channel is still around. It hasn't streamed anything, it was obviously a joke but it's
276200	280640	still here. And it really seems like Twitch is promoting this stuff because Twitch's advertisements
280640	285540	by the community for the community has no problem showing off this kind of content.
285540	290660	Twitch's own Let's Chat stream discussing the health of the community during a section
290660	295780	where they were actually talking about hot tub streams, shows off hot tub streams in
295780	300520	the front page recommended. So to somebody outside of the know, it seems like Twitch
300520	305960	really promotes this kind of behaviour. And at the same time, the guy who just live streamed
305960	311280	a bunch of dancing Asian videos and then cut in to tell all of his viewers that it's not
311280	314700	real and that they were all losers? Yeah, he got banned.
341280	363260	By the way, this clip's from It's a Gundam and that is a great puppet dude. Dark Side
363260	368220	Phil got banned and I'm not even sure what for, but I'm pretty sure it wasn't for swinging
368220	371820	Hannah's dong around, though then again, who knows.
371820	377720	Justaminx got banned from Twitch for using the words virgin, incel, and simp during her
377720	382920	live commentary. A professional Valorant player got banned because she went off to go to the
382920	388080	washroom for a break, her 3 year old child wandered into the room, and it is against
388080	391920	Twitch's rules to have unaccompanied minors on stream. People have been banned because
391920	395720	they've been doing IRL streams and completely outside of their control they get attacked
395720	400220	or mugged or shot at during those streams. Caleb got banned at one point for taking his
400220	405420	shirt off in order to show his fitness progress, and the only reason he got unbanned is because
405420	409500	his community was very large and managed to kick up a big fuss. And frankly, same with
409500	412620	Destiny. My pal Dimitri Munro was perma-banned off
412620	417020	Twitch because of some of the things he retweets on his Twitter account, not even for anything
417020	422840	done on Twitch. But some of these women straight up show full ass and pussy spread live on
422840	427040	Twitch and only got banned for 3 days. You use the wrong words, you make the wrong jokes,
427040	429920	you be the wrong person, and you're fucking out of there.
429920	433680	There is no serious rhyme or reason as to why this happens. It might be tempting to
433680	436960	assume it's about something like politics, where the political slants of the streamers
436960	440180	might have something to say about it. And there is a little bit of evidence for that,
440180	445040	but it seems to be more that if you have enough people on your side, enough viewers, enough
445040	449360	of a community, then Twitch will simply side with you, which ultimately boils down to how
449360	454760	many subs you have. If you are popular enough, you can do almost anything and get away with
454760	459320	almost anything. Twitch will simply let it happen. And if you're not, you can't. It's
459320	463420	that simple. Do you think I could get up there and spread my asshole on stream and not get
463420	467280	instantly banned off the platform? No. And at some point there was a whole bunch of rumors
467280	471280	floating around about how some of these women were actually getting with Twitch staff, which
471280	475620	meant that Twitch updated their terms of service. You can now get banned for suggesting that
475620	480460	a person's channel is only popular or has not been banned due to sexual favors. They
480460	485380	don't solve problems. They simply make talking about the problems against the rules. Of course,
485380	489740	you do get some girls that are just straight up honest. Chickenwingcandy says, no, I don't
489740	495020	have an OnlyFans. No, I'm not making one. No, I would not have viewers if I wasn't attractive.
495020	499820	This was proven by two failed channels over two-ish years in which the visual was focused
499820	504420	on gameplay rather than me. Blame yourself and your buddies for what you create. She's
504420	508700	making her money. Good for her. But Twitch has become this awful place, hasn't it? And
508700	513020	on the flip side of that, you do have these legitimately attractive women who are not
513020	517260	selling themselves in this way and who are also lamenting what Twitch has become.
517260	521500	I'm always going to speak my mind. And this is the one thing. This is, this is, this is
521500	527180	crazy to me. This is crazy to me. And I know I'm not the only one that feels that way.
527180	529740	I know there's a lot of women that feel that way, but they're not going to say anything
529740	534460	because God forbid anybody says anything. Then we come off being sexist because you
534460	538860	know what, if it's not hurting you, if it's not hurting you, then, then why do you care
538860	545020	so much? Now I care because this is the platform I'm fucking on. And what you don't understand
545020	550220	is when you open a door like that, those doors are going to keep opening. They should have
550220	555740	that hot tub meta that's happening. Great. I'm so over it. Like do what you want to do.
555740	558060	Even though I feel like there's other platforms for it, but that's fine. They got their own
558060	562460	category. Great. But when you allow that you're going to, you're opening the door up, right?
563660	570380	They're literally bending over doggy style, sucking on a microphone and making this
571100	575020	ear licking noises and staring at the camera, making eye contact
578780	580300	in the ASMR category.
580300	607500	If you're a female streamer on Twitch, the admins don't actually care. They just want to see your
607500	611580	ass. That's all it is. And every time they've added new sections of the site, these types of
611580	615980	people have moved in and taken up space for themselves. When they added just chatting,
615980	620300	like eight years ago or whatever it was, a lot of women on Twitch said, thank God,
620300	624220	I don't have to worry about faking playing a game anymore because they knew what their
624220	628380	audiences were there for. At one point, they added the art category so they could accommodate those
628380	632380	Bob Ross videos that are playing for a while. Okay, fair enough. Then you had Twitch thoughts
632380	636940	who were painting their boobs and saying, it's art. Stop sexualizing me, silly boys.
637660	641900	And they added the IRL streaming, the hot tub stream. And the thing is like, I'm not a prude.
641900	645900	I'm not against pornography, but shouldn't it happen on a site different from the one that
645900	651260	frankly is made for video games. At this point, Twitch has become chatterbait, but it has a
651260	656780	gaming subcategory. And even then not consistently because you walk the wrong tightrope, you get
656780	663980	banned. In fact, even project melody, the original vtuber thought from chatterbait plays games on
663980	669980	Twitch and does her sexual content on chatterbait. The internet's first fucking virtual stripper
669980	675980	uses Twitch for its intended purpose. While generic hoe number 8975 is constantly bending
675980	680860	over saying, oops, I dropped my mouse. He better shove my ass right into the camera.
680860	685340	VertiGear got canceled, not necessarily for being offensive, though, I guess to some people,
685340	690380	it's most certainly offensive, but because they were offensive and also correct, they were to
690380	696380	borrow a leftist phrase, speaking truth to power and the powerful didn't like it. It's as simple
696380	701820	as that. Now I still stream my gaming content on Twitch. In fact, after this video goes up,
701820	705820	I'll be streaming. So make sure to drop by. But I think I do so out of a nostalgia for the Twitch
705820	709660	that used to be, it wasn't just that you could get organically discovered on Twitch back then.
709660	714300	It was also that it had its own unique subculture, its own memes, its own personality separate from
714300	717580	the wider internet. But as the internet has slowly become centralized by a handful of
717580	722300	monopolizing companies, Twitch has lost a lot of its charm. Not all of it though. There are still
722300	725580	old school gaming channels on Twitch that are happy to keep that feeling alive within their
725580	730060	own communities. And my channel is absolutely one of them, but the wider site has largely lost its
730060	735100	unique edge, replacing it with cosplay tits and vapid political content. It stopped being a site
735100	740060	for gamers and instead became a site for Coomers. There's also evidence that Twitch is falling apart
740060	744620	internally as well, and I think I'll do some future Why Twitch Sucks videos so I can go into
744620	749420	those topics in more detail. But basically, the sub button on Twitch is an easy one-click button
749420	754220	that allows you to donate a recurring $5 monthly payment to your streamer of choice. Amazon Prime
754220	758060	comes with one free sub click as well, making it a popular option for people who want to support
758060	761900	somebody, don't have any money, but do use Amazon Prime. By the way, you know where to click if you
761900	765980	want to support this channel, right? It's right here. Right here. To get one of these sub buttons,
765980	769260	you have to sign an exclusivity contract with Twitch. But within the past year,
769260	773500	Twitch has just straight up stopped enforcing them. Small streamers like my pal Kibs,
773500	777740	all the way up to Destiny, all have sub buttons and multistream on YouTube too.
777740	781580	Nobody gives a shit about Twitch anymore, and Twitch doesn't give a shit either. I think at
781580	785740	this point the problems at Twitch are so systemic, it's going to take more than something like a CEO
785740	790220	change to fix them. The community absolutely hates Twitch, for what Twitch's staff has allowed it to
790220	793500	turn into. You know how YouTube pissed away all of its goodwill with its userbase over the last
793500	799180	decade? Twitch is that times 10. Frankly, nowadays most gaming streamers use it only because the
799740	803900	Amazon Prime free sub is a lot of money, including me. But if they're not going to even enforce their
803900	808060	exclusivity deal anymore, then fuck it. If you've ever wanted to watch my gaming streams but don't
808060	812540	actually like Twitch, there's a fair chance that, at some point in the near future, I just might
812540	815820	start streaming on my Game Boomers YouTube channel. Once I can get the monetization,
815820	820060	they're up and running. I love what Twitch used to be, I do want to see it come back. And a role
820060	824540	that I can play in that process is fostering a community that still has that old Twitch feel.
824540	828380	But at this point it's also incredibly stupid to put all your eggs in one basket.
828380	831820	The Twitch thoughts themselves are pretty bad, and they're certainly part of what's ruining
831820	836620	Twitch. But they only have so much power. They do what they do because Twitch allows them to do it.
836620	841340	Twitch has content moderation policies, but they regularly fail to enforce them against creators
841340	845660	as long as somebody in their office is having a wank to them. Twitch is rarely clear about
845660	849660	why you get banned, because they know every single time they've provided a concrete answer,
849660	853340	regular people have been able to use that to point out hypocrisy. And Twitch's only real
853340	857420	unbanning process is getting enough people to tag them on Twitter and shriek about it
857420	862380	until somebody higher up notices. So fuck it. If you want to watch and support my content,
862380	867100	check out Game Boomers on Twitch. But sometime, coming soon, also check out my gaming YouTube
867100	870860	channel. If they're not going to smarten up, I am. And if you're watching this video on release,
870860	875020	I will be doing a gaming stream shortly, so I'll see you there. Have a good one. I love you.
