1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,620
You guys heard about Vertigear? They're the ones who make those mega awful gamer chairs.

2
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:14,080
You know, they all have different brands on them but they basically just look alike. They're

3
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:20,260
overpriced, uncomfortable, low quality, and just all around not worth the buy. Yeah, those

4
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:25,120
guys. Well, regardless of the quality of the product, this happened recently. The official

5
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:30,560
Vertigear Twitter account posts, is this accurate? And it shows a male streamer. Normal twitch

6
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:35,420
setup, right? Gameplay, facecam, mic, female streamer. Where it's inverted, the focus is

7
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:39,600
clearly on the woman and not the gameplay. This is actually just a recreation of this

8
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:44,040
ancient meme from like 15 years ago. You'd see this floating around all the time on year

9
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:49,040
1 4chan. It's making fun of a certain little bit of human psychology which, if you're able

10
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:53,440
to accurately observe the world, you have to admit on some level is true. Not for everyone

11
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:59,040
obviously but in general. Well of course it's not 2007 anymore, it's 2021. This absolutely

12
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:02,840
blew up and now everybody is trying to dig into Vertigear to find all the problematic

13
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:07,560
things they've said. And oh boy are they finding a lot of them. And by a lot of them honestly

14
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:13,240
it's just regular memes that only terminally online people would complain about. And of

15
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:18,280
course because it's 2021, after going viral they immediately cucked out, gave in, and

16
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:22,600
posted a big long tweet about how sorry they are and how they're committed to diversity

17
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:26,240
and inclusion and blah blah blah. And they posted a second one. But in this one they

18
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:30,560
actually admitted that the poor intern who was running the account got fired. I mean

19
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:34,360
there was no reason to ever buy these products before but there's certainly not one now.

20
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:38,060
To nobody's surprise, Karens are coming out and trying to get the other companies that

21
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:43,100
work with Vertigear to stop doing so. Said Karen is also accepting donations for her

22
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:48,640
brave activism. One such individual is Miss Henley TV. You deleted it but you can't pretend

23
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:53,060
that it wasn't tweeted Vertigear. You owe the women in the industry a major apology.

24
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:56,840
How dare you say that women only use their looks on Twitch?

25
00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:01,960
Also from Miss Henley, here's her OnlyFans. It's currently 60% off. And she also streams

26
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:07,640
Call of Duty Black Ops along with a Bikini Pool stream if she gets enough donations.

27
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:13,440
The exact people who were getting mad at Vertigear for making this post are the very people that

28
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:19,480
it was criticizing. And if there is a serious problem with Twitch it is the open brazenness

29
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:25,760
of the thoughts. Some will lie around all day and take donations to fart into their

30
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:31,520
microphones. Oh and by the way, the farter, the one who's currently writing donators

31
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:36,760
names on her body. In 2017 she said, I'm ashamed to say that Twitch is a platform that

32
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:41,120
supports lazy females selling their bodies for cash. You are teaching little girls to

33
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:47,880
sell sex, make them wear t-shirts and pants, compete on the same playing field as men,

34
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:52,160
feminism is equality, spread the word. Where did that go? You've got Amaranth making

35
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:57,840
totally not sexual content, dressing up like this and licking her microphone, or even better

36
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:03,380
bouncing around on a bed in what looks like some kind of Spiderman costume I think wearing

37
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:10,120
a horse head. What the fuck are we watching? These two girls did get banned but only temporary.

38
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:15,160
Felinity is well known for controversy after controversy. She had a nip slip on air, full

39
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:21,320
on wardrobe malfunction, she's abused animals on stream, throwing her cat around, giving

40
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:30,400
it vodka, and also her dog decided to inspect a little bit during the stream. Now I don't

41
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:34,760
know much about dogs but I have heard that dogs generally won't do this unless you train

42
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:38,520
them to so I don't know how to feel about this one guys.

43
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:45,440
And man if you guys only knew how to speak other languages. Twitch in Korea is on a whole

44
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:51,720
other level. You've got people streaming themselves doing lines of cocaine. Some have no problem

45
00:03:51,720 --> 00:04:12,720
admitting to committing crimes on air, no big deal. You've got dudes in full latex

46
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:17,180
so that you can't actually see any nudity, getting vibrators shoved against their dick

47
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:22,320
so that they come. But because you can't see anything, it's on Twitch. You've got this

48
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:32,320
one channel here, Hot Underscore Ghee, streaming Russian fetish porn. Oh and by the way, the

49
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:36,200
channel is still around. It hasn't streamed anything, it was obviously a joke but it's

50
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:40,640
still here. And it really seems like Twitch is promoting this stuff because Twitch's advertisements

51
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:45,540
by the community for the community has no problem showing off this kind of content.

52
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:50,660
Twitch's own Let's Chat stream discussing the health of the community during a section

53
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:55,780
where they were actually talking about hot tub streams, shows off hot tub streams in

54
00:04:55,780 --> 00:05:00,520
the front page recommended. So to somebody outside of the know, it seems like Twitch

55
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:05,960
really promotes this kind of behaviour. And at the same time, the guy who just live streamed

56
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:11,280
a bunch of dancing Asian videos and then cut in to tell all of his viewers that it's not

57
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:14,700
real and that they were all losers? Yeah, he got banned.

58
00:05:41,280 --> 00:06:03,260
By the way, this clip's from It's a Gundam and that is a great puppet dude. Dark Side

59
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:08,220
Phil got banned and I'm not even sure what for, but I'm pretty sure it wasn't for swinging

60
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:11,820
Hannah's dong around, though then again, who knows.

61
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:17,720
Justaminx got banned from Twitch for using the words virgin, incel, and simp during her

62
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:22,920
live commentary. A professional Valorant player got banned because she went off to go to the

63
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:28,080
washroom for a break, her 3 year old child wandered into the room, and it is against

64
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:31,920
Twitch's rules to have unaccompanied minors on stream. People have been banned because

65
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:35,720
they've been doing IRL streams and completely outside of their control they get attacked

66
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:40,220
or mugged or shot at during those streams. Caleb got banned at one point for taking his

67
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:45,420
shirt off in order to show his fitness progress, and the only reason he got unbanned is because

68
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:49,500
his community was very large and managed to kick up a big fuss. And frankly, same with

69
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:52,620
Destiny. My pal Dimitri Munro was perma-banned off

70
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:57,020
Twitch because of some of the things he retweets on his Twitter account, not even for anything

71
00:06:57,020 --> 00:07:02,840
done on Twitch. But some of these women straight up show full ass and pussy spread live on

72
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:07,040
Twitch and only got banned for 3 days. You use the wrong words, you make the wrong jokes,

73
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:09,920
you be the wrong person, and you're fucking out of there.

74
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:13,680
There is no serious rhyme or reason as to why this happens. It might be tempting to

75
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:16,960
assume it's about something like politics, where the political slants of the streamers

76
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:20,180
might have something to say about it. And there is a little bit of evidence for that,

77
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:25,040
but it seems to be more that if you have enough people on your side, enough viewers, enough

78
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:29,360
of a community, then Twitch will simply side with you, which ultimately boils down to how

79
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:34,760
many subs you have. If you are popular enough, you can do almost anything and get away with

80
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:39,320
almost anything. Twitch will simply let it happen. And if you're not, you can't. It's

81
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:43,420
that simple. Do you think I could get up there and spread my asshole on stream and not get

82
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:47,280
instantly banned off the platform? No. And at some point there was a whole bunch of rumors

83
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:51,280
floating around about how some of these women were actually getting with Twitch staff, which

84
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:55,620
meant that Twitch updated their terms of service. You can now get banned for suggesting that

85
00:07:55,620 --> 00:08:00,460
a person's channel is only popular or has not been banned due to sexual favors. They

86
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:05,380
don't solve problems. They simply make talking about the problems against the rules. Of course,

87
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:09,740
you do get some girls that are just straight up honest. Chickenwingcandy says, no, I don't

88
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:15,020
have an OnlyFans. No, I'm not making one. No, I would not have viewers if I wasn't attractive.

89
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:19,820
This was proven by two failed channels over two-ish years in which the visual was focused

90
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:24,420
on gameplay rather than me. Blame yourself and your buddies for what you create. She's

91
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:28,700
making her money. Good for her. But Twitch has become this awful place, hasn't it? And

92
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:33,020
on the flip side of that, you do have these legitimately attractive women who are not

93
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:37,260
selling themselves in this way and who are also lamenting what Twitch has become.

94
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:41,500
I'm always going to speak my mind. And this is the one thing. This is, this is, this is

95
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:47,180
crazy to me. This is crazy to me. And I know I'm not the only one that feels that way.

96
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:49,740
I know there's a lot of women that feel that way, but they're not going to say anything

97
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:54,460
because God forbid anybody says anything. Then we come off being sexist because you

98
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:58,860
know what, if it's not hurting you, if it's not hurting you, then, then why do you care

99
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:05,020
so much? Now I care because this is the platform I'm fucking on. And what you don't understand

100
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:10,220
is when you open a door like that, those doors are going to keep opening. They should have

101
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:15,740
that hot tub meta that's happening. Great. I'm so over it. Like do what you want to do.

102
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:18,060
Even though I feel like there's other platforms for it, but that's fine. They got their own

103
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:22,460
category. Great. But when you allow that you're going to, you're opening the door up, right?

104
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:30,380
They're literally bending over doggy style, sucking on a microphone and making this

105
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:35,020
ear licking noises and staring at the camera, making eye contact

106
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:40,300
in the ASMR category.

107
00:09:40,300 --> 00:10:07,500
If you're a female streamer on Twitch, the admins don't actually care. They just want to see your

108
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:11,580
ass. That's all it is. And every time they've added new sections of the site, these types of

109
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:15,980
people have moved in and taken up space for themselves. When they added just chatting,

110
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:20,300
like eight years ago or whatever it was, a lot of women on Twitch said, thank God,

111
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:24,220
I don't have to worry about faking playing a game anymore because they knew what their

112
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:28,380
audiences were there for. At one point, they added the art category so they could accommodate those

113
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:32,380
Bob Ross videos that are playing for a while. Okay, fair enough. Then you had Twitch thoughts

114
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:36,940
who were painting their boobs and saying, it's art. Stop sexualizing me, silly boys.

115
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:41,900
And they added the IRL streaming, the hot tub stream. And the thing is like, I'm not a prude.

116
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:45,900
I'm not against pornography, but shouldn't it happen on a site different from the one that

117
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:51,260
frankly is made for video games. At this point, Twitch has become chatterbait, but it has a

118
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:56,780
gaming subcategory. And even then not consistently because you walk the wrong tightrope, you get

119
00:10:56,780 --> 00:11:03,980
banned. In fact, even project melody, the original vtuber thought from chatterbait plays games on

120
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:09,980
Twitch and does her sexual content on chatterbait. The internet's first fucking virtual stripper

121
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:15,980
uses Twitch for its intended purpose. While generic hoe number 8975 is constantly bending

122
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:20,860
over saying, oops, I dropped my mouse. He better shove my ass right into the camera.

123
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:25,340
VertiGear got canceled, not necessarily for being offensive, though, I guess to some people,

124
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:30,380
it's most certainly offensive, but because they were offensive and also correct, they were to

125
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:36,380
borrow a leftist phrase, speaking truth to power and the powerful didn't like it. It's as simple

126
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:41,820
as that. Now I still stream my gaming content on Twitch. In fact, after this video goes up,

127
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:45,820
I'll be streaming. So make sure to drop by. But I think I do so out of a nostalgia for the Twitch

128
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:49,660
that used to be, it wasn't just that you could get organically discovered on Twitch back then.

129
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:54,300
It was also that it had its own unique subculture, its own memes, its own personality separate from

130
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:57,580
the wider internet. But as the internet has slowly become centralized by a handful of

131
00:11:57,580 --> 00:12:02,300
monopolizing companies, Twitch has lost a lot of its charm. Not all of it though. There are still

132
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:05,580
old school gaming channels on Twitch that are happy to keep that feeling alive within their

133
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:10,060
own communities. And my channel is absolutely one of them, but the wider site has largely lost its

134
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:15,100
unique edge, replacing it with cosplay tits and vapid political content. It stopped being a site

135
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:20,060
for gamers and instead became a site for Coomers. There's also evidence that Twitch is falling apart

136
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:24,620
internally as well, and I think I'll do some future Why Twitch Sucks videos so I can go into

137
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:29,420
those topics in more detail. But basically, the sub button on Twitch is an easy one-click button

138
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:34,220
that allows you to donate a recurring $5 monthly payment to your streamer of choice. Amazon Prime

139
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:38,060
comes with one free sub click as well, making it a popular option for people who want to support

140
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:41,900
somebody, don't have any money, but do use Amazon Prime. By the way, you know where to click if you

141
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:45,980
want to support this channel, right? It's right here. Right here. To get one of these sub buttons,

142
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:49,260
you have to sign an exclusivity contract with Twitch. But within the past year,

143
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:53,500
Twitch has just straight up stopped enforcing them. Small streamers like my pal Kibs,

144
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:57,740
all the way up to Destiny, all have sub buttons and multistream on YouTube too.

145
00:12:57,740 --> 00:13:01,580
Nobody gives a shit about Twitch anymore, and Twitch doesn't give a shit either. I think at

146
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:05,740
this point the problems at Twitch are so systemic, it's going to take more than something like a CEO

147
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:10,220
change to fix them. The community absolutely hates Twitch, for what Twitch's staff has allowed it to

148
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:13,500
turn into. You know how YouTube pissed away all of its goodwill with its userbase over the last

149
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:19,180
decade? Twitch is that times 10. Frankly, nowadays most gaming streamers use it only because the

150
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:23,900
Amazon Prime free sub is a lot of money, including me. But if they're not going to even enforce their

151
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:28,060
exclusivity deal anymore, then fuck it. If you've ever wanted to watch my gaming streams but don't

152
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:32,540
actually like Twitch, there's a fair chance that, at some point in the near future, I just might

153
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:35,820
start streaming on my Game Boomers YouTube channel. Once I can get the monetization,

154
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:40,060
they're up and running. I love what Twitch used to be, I do want to see it come back. And a role

155
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:44,540
that I can play in that process is fostering a community that still has that old Twitch feel.

156
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:48,380
But at this point it's also incredibly stupid to put all your eggs in one basket.

157
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:51,820
The Twitch thoughts themselves are pretty bad, and they're certainly part of what's ruining

158
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:56,620
Twitch. But they only have so much power. They do what they do because Twitch allows them to do it.

159
00:13:56,620 --> 00:14:01,340
Twitch has content moderation policies, but they regularly fail to enforce them against creators

160
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:05,660
as long as somebody in their office is having a wank to them. Twitch is rarely clear about

161
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:09,660
why you get banned, because they know every single time they've provided a concrete answer,

162
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:13,340
regular people have been able to use that to point out hypocrisy. And Twitch's only real

163
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:17,420
unbanning process is getting enough people to tag them on Twitter and shriek about it

164
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:22,380
until somebody higher up notices. So fuck it. If you want to watch and support my content,

165
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:27,100
check out Game Boomers on Twitch. But sometime, coming soon, also check out my gaming YouTube

166
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:30,860
channel. If they're not going to smarten up, I am. And if you're watching this video on release,

167
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:35,020
I will be doing a gaming stream shortly, so I'll see you there. Have a good one. I love you.
