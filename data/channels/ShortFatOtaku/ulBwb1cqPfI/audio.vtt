You guys heard about Vertigear? They're the ones who make those mega awful gamer chairs.

00:10.620 --> 00:14.080
You know, they all have different brands on them but they basically just look alike. They're

00:14.080 --> 00:20.260
overpriced, uncomfortable, low quality, and just all around not worth the buy. Yeah, those

00:20.260 --> 00:25.120
guys. Well, regardless of the quality of the product, this happened recently. The official

00:25.120 --> 00:30.560
Vertigear Twitter account posts, is this accurate? And it shows a male streamer. Normal twitch

00:30.560 --> 00:35.420
setup, right? Gameplay, facecam, mic, female streamer. Where it's inverted, the focus is

00:35.420 --> 00:39.600
clearly on the woman and not the gameplay. This is actually just a recreation of this

00:39.600 --> 00:44.040
ancient meme from like 15 years ago. You'd see this floating around all the time on year

00:44.040 --> 00:49.040
1 4chan. It's making fun of a certain little bit of human psychology which, if you're able

00:49.040 --> 00:53.440
to accurately observe the world, you have to admit on some level is true. Not for everyone

00:53.440 --> 00:59.040
obviously but in general. Well of course it's not 2007 anymore, it's 2021. This absolutely

00:59.040 --> 01:02.840
blew up and now everybody is trying to dig into Vertigear to find all the problematic

01:02.840 --> 01:07.560
things they've said. And oh boy are they finding a lot of them. And by a lot of them honestly

01:07.560 --> 01:13.240
it's just regular memes that only terminally online people would complain about. And of

01:13.240 --> 01:18.280
course because it's 2021, after going viral they immediately cucked out, gave in, and

01:18.280 --> 01:22.600
posted a big long tweet about how sorry they are and how they're committed to diversity

01:22.600 --> 01:26.240
and inclusion and blah blah blah. And they posted a second one. But in this one they

01:26.240 --> 01:30.560
actually admitted that the poor intern who was running the account got fired. I mean

01:30.560 --> 01:34.360
there was no reason to ever buy these products before but there's certainly not one now.

01:34.360 --> 01:38.060
To nobody's surprise, Karens are coming out and trying to get the other companies that

01:38.060 --> 01:43.100
work with Vertigear to stop doing so. Said Karen is also accepting donations for her

01:43.100 --> 01:48.640
brave activism. One such individual is Miss Henley TV. You deleted it but you can't pretend

01:48.640 --> 01:53.060
that it wasn't tweeted Vertigear. You owe the women in the industry a major apology.

01:53.060 --> 01:56.840
How dare you say that women only use their looks on Twitch?

01:56.840 --> 02:01.960
Also from Miss Henley, here's her OnlyFans. It's currently 60% off. And she also streams

02:01.960 --> 02:07.640
Call of Duty Black Ops along with a Bikini Pool stream if she gets enough donations.

02:07.640 --> 02:13.440
The exact people who were getting mad at Vertigear for making this post are the very people that

02:13.440 --> 02:19.480
it was criticizing. And if there is a serious problem with Twitch it is the open brazenness

02:19.480 --> 02:25.760
of the thoughts. Some will lie around all day and take donations to fart into their

02:25.760 --> 02:31.520
microphones. Oh and by the way, the farter, the one who's currently writing donators

02:31.520 --> 02:36.760
names on her body. In 2017 she said, I'm ashamed to say that Twitch is a platform that

02:36.760 --> 02:41.120
supports lazy females selling their bodies for cash. You are teaching little girls to

02:41.120 --> 02:47.880
sell sex, make them wear t-shirts and pants, compete on the same playing field as men,

02:47.880 --> 02:52.160
feminism is equality, spread the word. Where did that go? You've got Amaranth making

02:52.160 --> 02:57.840
totally not sexual content, dressing up like this and licking her microphone, or even better

02:57.840 --> 03:03.380
bouncing around on a bed in what looks like some kind of Spiderman costume I think wearing

03:03.380 --> 03:10.120
a horse head. What the fuck are we watching? These two girls did get banned but only temporary.

03:10.120 --> 03:15.160
Felinity is well known for controversy after controversy. She had a nip slip on air, full

03:15.160 --> 03:21.320
on wardrobe malfunction, she's abused animals on stream, throwing her cat around, giving

03:21.320 --> 03:30.400
it vodka, and also her dog decided to inspect a little bit during the stream. Now I don't

03:30.400 --> 03:34.760
know much about dogs but I have heard that dogs generally won't do this unless you train

03:34.760 --> 03:38.520
them to so I don't know how to feel about this one guys.

03:38.520 --> 03:45.440
And man if you guys only knew how to speak other languages. Twitch in Korea is on a whole

03:45.440 --> 03:51.720
other level. You've got people streaming themselves doing lines of cocaine. Some have no problem

03:51.720 --> 04:12.720
admitting to committing crimes on air, no big deal. You've got dudes in full latex

04:12.720 --> 04:17.180
so that you can't actually see any nudity, getting vibrators shoved against their dick

04:17.180 --> 04:22.320
so that they come. But because you can't see anything, it's on Twitch. You've got this

04:22.320 --> 04:32.320
one channel here, Hot Underscore Ghee, streaming Russian fetish porn. Oh and by the way, the

04:32.320 --> 04:36.200
channel is still around. It hasn't streamed anything, it was obviously a joke but it's

04:36.200 --> 04:40.640
still here. And it really seems like Twitch is promoting this stuff because Twitch's advertisements

04:40.640 --> 04:45.540
by the community for the community has no problem showing off this kind of content.

04:45.540 --> 04:50.660
Twitch's own Let's Chat stream discussing the health of the community during a section

04:50.660 --> 04:55.780
where they were actually talking about hot tub streams, shows off hot tub streams in

04:55.780 --> 05:00.520
the front page recommended. So to somebody outside of the know, it seems like Twitch

05:00.520 --> 05:05.960
really promotes this kind of behaviour. And at the same time, the guy who just live streamed

05:05.960 --> 05:11.280
a bunch of dancing Asian videos and then cut in to tell all of his viewers that it's not

05:11.280 --> 05:14.700
real and that they were all losers? Yeah, he got banned.

05:41.280 --> 06:03.260
By the way, this clip's from It's a Gundam and that is a great puppet dude. Dark Side

06:03.260 --> 06:08.220
Phil got banned and I'm not even sure what for, but I'm pretty sure it wasn't for swinging

06:08.220 --> 06:11.820
Hannah's dong around, though then again, who knows.

06:11.820 --> 06:17.720
Justaminx got banned from Twitch for using the words virgin, incel, and simp during her

06:17.720 --> 06:22.920
live commentary. A professional Valorant player got banned because she went off to go to the

06:22.920 --> 06:28.080
washroom for a break, her 3 year old child wandered into the room, and it is against

06:28.080 --> 06:31.920
Twitch's rules to have unaccompanied minors on stream. People have been banned because

06:31.920 --> 06:35.720
they've been doing IRL streams and completely outside of their control they get attacked

06:35.720 --> 06:40.220
or mugged or shot at during those streams. Caleb got banned at one point for taking his

06:40.220 --> 06:45.420
shirt off in order to show his fitness progress, and the only reason he got unbanned is because

06:45.420 --> 06:49.500
his community was very large and managed to kick up a big fuss. And frankly, same with

06:49.500 --> 06:52.620
Destiny. My pal Dimitri Munro was perma-banned off

06:52.620 --> 06:57.020
Twitch because of some of the things he retweets on his Twitter account, not even for anything

06:57.020 --> 07:02.840
done on Twitch. But some of these women straight up show full ass and pussy spread live on

07:02.840 --> 07:07.040
Twitch and only got banned for 3 days. You use the wrong words, you make the wrong jokes,

07:07.040 --> 07:09.920
you be the wrong person, and you're fucking out of there.

07:09.920 --> 07:13.680
There is no serious rhyme or reason as to why this happens. It might be tempting to

07:13.680 --> 07:16.960
assume it's about something like politics, where the political slants of the streamers

07:16.960 --> 07:20.180
might have something to say about it. And there is a little bit of evidence for that,

07:20.180 --> 07:25.040
but it seems to be more that if you have enough people on your side, enough viewers, enough

07:25.040 --> 07:29.360
of a community, then Twitch will simply side with you, which ultimately boils down to how

07:29.360 --> 07:34.760
many subs you have. If you are popular enough, you can do almost anything and get away with

07:34.760 --> 07:39.320
almost anything. Twitch will simply let it happen. And if you're not, you can't. It's

07:39.320 --> 07:43.420
that simple. Do you think I could get up there and spread my asshole on stream and not get

07:43.420 --> 07:47.280
instantly banned off the platform? No. And at some point there was a whole bunch of rumors

07:47.280 --> 07:51.280
floating around about how some of these women were actually getting with Twitch staff, which

07:51.280 --> 07:55.620
meant that Twitch updated their terms of service. You can now get banned for suggesting that

07:55.620 --> 08:00.460
a person's channel is only popular or has not been banned due to sexual favors. They

08:00.460 --> 08:05.380
don't solve problems. They simply make talking about the problems against the rules. Of course,

08:05.380 --> 08:09.740
you do get some girls that are just straight up honest. Chickenwingcandy says, no, I don't

08:09.740 --> 08:15.020
have an OnlyFans. No, I'm not making one. No, I would not have viewers if I wasn't attractive.

08:15.020 --> 08:19.820
This was proven by two failed channels over two-ish years in which the visual was focused

08:19.820 --> 08:24.420
on gameplay rather than me. Blame yourself and your buddies for what you create. She's

08:24.420 --> 08:28.700
making her money. Good for her. But Twitch has become this awful place, hasn't it? And

08:28.700 --> 08:33.020
on the flip side of that, you do have these legitimately attractive women who are not

08:33.020 --> 08:37.260
selling themselves in this way and who are also lamenting what Twitch has become.

08:37.260 --> 08:41.500
I'm always going to speak my mind. And this is the one thing. This is, this is, this is

08:41.500 --> 08:47.180
crazy to me. This is crazy to me. And I know I'm not the only one that feels that way.

08:47.180 --> 08:49.740
I know there's a lot of women that feel that way, but they're not going to say anything

08:49.740 --> 08:54.460
because God forbid anybody says anything. Then we come off being sexist because you

08:54.460 --> 08:58.860
know what, if it's not hurting you, if it's not hurting you, then, then why do you care

08:58.860 --> 09:05.020
so much? Now I care because this is the platform I'm fucking on. And what you don't understand

09:05.020 --> 09:10.220
is when you open a door like that, those doors are going to keep opening. They should have

09:10.220 --> 09:15.740
that hot tub meta that's happening. Great. I'm so over it. Like do what you want to do.

09:15.740 --> 09:18.060
Even though I feel like there's other platforms for it, but that's fine. They got their own

09:18.060 --> 09:22.460
category. Great. But when you allow that you're going to, you're opening the door up, right?

09:23.660 --> 09:30.380
They're literally bending over doggy style, sucking on a microphone and making this

09:31.100 --> 09:35.020
ear licking noises and staring at the camera, making eye contact

09:38.780 --> 09:40.300
in the ASMR category.

09:40.300 --> 10:07.500
If you're a female streamer on Twitch, the admins don't actually care. They just want to see your

10:07.500 --> 10:11.580
ass. That's all it is. And every time they've added new sections of the site, these types of

10:11.580 --> 10:15.980
people have moved in and taken up space for themselves. When they added just chatting,

10:15.980 --> 10:20.300
like eight years ago or whatever it was, a lot of women on Twitch said, thank God,

10:20.300 --> 10:24.220
I don't have to worry about faking playing a game anymore because they knew what their

10:24.220 --> 10:28.380
audiences were there for. At one point, they added the art category so they could accommodate those

10:28.380 --> 10:32.380
Bob Ross videos that are playing for a while. Okay, fair enough. Then you had Twitch thoughts

10:32.380 --> 10:36.940
who were painting their boobs and saying, it's art. Stop sexualizing me, silly boys.

10:37.660 --> 10:41.900
And they added the IRL streaming, the hot tub stream. And the thing is like, I'm not a prude.

10:41.900 --> 10:45.900
I'm not against pornography, but shouldn't it happen on a site different from the one that

10:45.900 --> 10:51.260
frankly is made for video games. At this point, Twitch has become chatterbait, but it has a

10:51.260 --> 10:56.780
gaming subcategory. And even then not consistently because you walk the wrong tightrope, you get

10:56.780 --> 11:03.980
banned. In fact, even project melody, the original vtuber thought from chatterbait plays games on

11:03.980 --> 11:09.980
Twitch and does her sexual content on chatterbait. The internet's first fucking virtual stripper

11:09.980 --> 11:15.980
uses Twitch for its intended purpose. While generic hoe number 8975 is constantly bending

11:15.980 --> 11:20.860
over saying, oops, I dropped my mouse. He better shove my ass right into the camera.

11:20.860 --> 11:25.340
VertiGear got canceled, not necessarily for being offensive, though, I guess to some people,

11:25.340 --> 11:30.380
it's most certainly offensive, but because they were offensive and also correct, they were to

11:30.380 --> 11:36.380
borrow a leftist phrase, speaking truth to power and the powerful didn't like it. It's as simple

11:36.380 --> 11:41.820
as that. Now I still stream my gaming content on Twitch. In fact, after this video goes up,

11:41.820 --> 11:45.820
I'll be streaming. So make sure to drop by. But I think I do so out of a nostalgia for the Twitch

11:45.820 --> 11:49.660
that used to be, it wasn't just that you could get organically discovered on Twitch back then.

11:49.660 --> 11:54.300
It was also that it had its own unique subculture, its own memes, its own personality separate from

11:54.300 --> 11:57.580
the wider internet. But as the internet has slowly become centralized by a handful of

11:57.580 --> 12:02.300
monopolizing companies, Twitch has lost a lot of its charm. Not all of it though. There are still

12:02.300 --> 12:05.580
old school gaming channels on Twitch that are happy to keep that feeling alive within their

12:05.580 --> 12:10.060
own communities. And my channel is absolutely one of them, but the wider site has largely lost its

12:10.060 --> 12:15.100
unique edge, replacing it with cosplay tits and vapid political content. It stopped being a site

12:15.100 --> 12:20.060
for gamers and instead became a site for Coomers. There's also evidence that Twitch is falling apart

12:20.060 --> 12:24.620
internally as well, and I think I'll do some future Why Twitch Sucks videos so I can go into

12:24.620 --> 12:29.420
those topics in more detail. But basically, the sub button on Twitch is an easy one-click button

12:29.420 --> 12:34.220
that allows you to donate a recurring $5 monthly payment to your streamer of choice. Amazon Prime

12:34.220 --> 12:38.060
comes with one free sub click as well, making it a popular option for people who want to support

12:38.060 --> 12:41.900
somebody, don't have any money, but do use Amazon Prime. By the way, you know where to click if you

12:41.900 --> 12:45.980
want to support this channel, right? It's right here. Right here. To get one of these sub buttons,

12:45.980 --> 12:49.260
you have to sign an exclusivity contract with Twitch. But within the past year,

12:49.260 --> 12:53.500
Twitch has just straight up stopped enforcing them. Small streamers like my pal Kibs,

12:53.500 --> 12:57.740
all the way up to Destiny, all have sub buttons and multistream on YouTube too.

12:57.740 --> 13:01.580
Nobody gives a shit about Twitch anymore, and Twitch doesn't give a shit either. I think at

13:01.580 --> 13:05.740
this point the problems at Twitch are so systemic, it's going to take more than something like a CEO

13:05.740 --> 13:10.220
change to fix them. The community absolutely hates Twitch, for what Twitch's staff has allowed it to

13:10.220 --> 13:13.500
turn into. You know how YouTube pissed away all of its goodwill with its userbase over the last

13:13.500 --> 13:19.180
decade? Twitch is that times 10. Frankly, nowadays most gaming streamers use it only because the

13:19.740 --> 13:23.900
Amazon Prime free sub is a lot of money, including me. But if they're not going to even enforce their

13:23.900 --> 13:28.060
exclusivity deal anymore, then fuck it. If you've ever wanted to watch my gaming streams but don't

13:28.060 --> 13:32.540
actually like Twitch, there's a fair chance that, at some point in the near future, I just might

13:32.540 --> 13:35.820
start streaming on my Game Boomers YouTube channel. Once I can get the monetization,

13:35.820 --> 13:40.060
they're up and running. I love what Twitch used to be, I do want to see it come back. And a role

13:40.060 --> 13:44.540
that I can play in that process is fostering a community that still has that old Twitch feel.

13:44.540 --> 13:48.380
But at this point it's also incredibly stupid to put all your eggs in one basket.

13:48.380 --> 13:51.820
The Twitch thoughts themselves are pretty bad, and they're certainly part of what's ruining

13:51.820 --> 13:56.620
Twitch. But they only have so much power. They do what they do because Twitch allows them to do it.

13:56.620 --> 14:01.340
Twitch has content moderation policies, but they regularly fail to enforce them against creators

14:01.340 --> 14:05.660
as long as somebody in their office is having a wank to them. Twitch is rarely clear about

14:05.660 --> 14:09.660
why you get banned, because they know every single time they've provided a concrete answer,

14:09.660 --> 14:13.340
regular people have been able to use that to point out hypocrisy. And Twitch's only real

14:13.340 --> 14:17.420
unbanning process is getting enough people to tag them on Twitter and shriek about it

14:17.420 --> 14:22.380
until somebody higher up notices. So fuck it. If you want to watch and support my content,

14:22.380 --> 14:27.100
check out Game Boomers on Twitch. But sometime, coming soon, also check out my gaming YouTube

14:27.100 --> 14:30.860
channel. If they're not going to smarten up, I am. And if you're watching this video on release,

14:30.860 --> 14:35.020
I will be doing a gaming stream shortly, so I'll see you there. Have a good one. I love you.
