00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,360
Hello everyone, you know what you're here for. It's TikTok Tuesday. Though for a select few of

2
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:10,880
you, it's not Tuesday, is it? It's probably earlier. That's because I've activated the

3
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:16,000
ability for certain people to watch the video early. If you hit that YouTube membership button,

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,320
you can check out my content. I don't know what exactly to guarantee here. I'm not going to

5
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:24,320
guarantee anything. It'll be early. It'll be before it comes out usually. How early? That

6
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:28,640
depends on how lazy I am. But for most of you, you're watching this on Tuesday. And so welcome

7
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:34,240
to TikTok Tuesday. Let's dive right into this nonsense. If you do nothing about what I'm about

8
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:39,360
to tell you, the way you use the internet will be forever changed in two days. Oh, let's see.

9
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:44,240
This is the Kids Online Safety Act or COSA for short. And here's why you should do everything

10
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:49,040
in your power to prevent this bill from getting passed. Why? If this bill passes the vote for it

11
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:55,520
on Thursday, the entire internet access of America will be placed under censorship. This bill gives

12
00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:01,840
government officials the right to sue any company that exposes a minor to a controversial topic.

13
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:08,160
Now, what does that mean? Well, anything on race, gender, sexuality, politics, history, gun control,

14
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:14,320
your minors, information, anything, everything. And you know what these companies like TikTok,

15
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:18,560
like Instagram, like Facebook are going to do after this bill gets passed? What do they say?

16
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:24,160
Well, it's impossible to stop minors from seeing this content. We aren't going to allow it anymore.

17
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:26,560
You aren't going to be able to talk about these things anymore.

18
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:30,480
You look pretty young kid. Is this your first time? I don't know enough about this bill to

19
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:35,680
give you a reasonable dev take one way or the other. All I can say is if the government wants

20
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:39,120
the internet censored, they're just going to do it. That's just kind of how it's always been.

21
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:43,760
Something happened like almost like a decade ago now, I think maybe 12 or 13 years with the Channel

22
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:48,000
Awesome guys showing up at Congress to be like, hey, listen, your regulations will destroy our

23
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,880
business. There was the COPPA thing a few years back. There was the net neutrality conversation.

24
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:58,240
Every few years, some scare like this shows up. Now the internet has certainly gotten worse and

25
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:01,920
part of that probably can be chalked up to the government. So fair enough. But this kid is out

26
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:06,320
here saying, oh no, minors aren't going to be able to see things that minors shouldn't be seeing. Oh,

27
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:10,720
it's a travesty. Well, I mean, I don't necessarily think that this is the hill that I want to die on

28
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:14,160
when it comes to protecting internet free speech. I guess we'll have to see how it unfolds.

29
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:20,160
I don't know about you guys, but I might've seen this girl from somewhere before.

30
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,560
She seems awfully familiar, but I don't know.

31
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:26,480
Oh, we're comparing stats. Baby girl doesn't know that I am Tom Brady at this game.

32
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:33,520
Married at 18, divorced at 21, second marriage, married at 25, divorced at 28,

33
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:41,360
third engagement, engaged at 29, ended it at 30, but I kept the ring. I'm still keeping Tom Brady

34
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:49,520
on his toes. We should not be afraid to leave these men. We are not stuck with these people.

35
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:57,520
Marriage is not a sanctimonious thing. It is supposed to be something. It's a commitment

36
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:04,160
you make to someone, but if you feel like you're not getting anything from that commitment and

37
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:08,000
you're trying, you got to go, you got to go. It's not a commitment then is it?

38
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:14,080
I know it's difficult to fill out paperwork and to make appointments and to do all of these things,

39
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:17,840
but this is your fucking life. Do you want to be stuck with someone?

40
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:21,840
I'm glad I'm not stuck with you. Okay, that joke at the start of the video aside.

41
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:27,200
I don't know if I should be taking advice on relationships and marriage and monogamy

42
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:33,040
from a porn star who's had, as she says, three failed marriages. Perhaps you are not the person

43
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:38,240
who has the life experience that I can draw valuable information from, at least not in

44
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:42,800
terms of how to run a successful marriage. It's amazing the mindset of these people, right?

45
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:47,040
If you say something like marriage isn't the sanctimonious thing, well then it won't be.

46
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:50,160
The sanctity will be gone if you don't believe in it and how she's like,

47
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:54,000
well, yeah, it's a commitment, but well then it wasn't much of a commitment, right?

48
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:00,160
There are things in life that are for life as in they're one way doors. You go through them

49
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:04,480
and then you are on the other side and there's no going back. One of those things is growing up.

50
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:07,920
You can't go back and be a kid again. When you're an old man, you can't go back to middle age.

51
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:12,560
That's just how it is. And there are absolutely should be some choices that once you make,

52
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,360
you shouldn't be able to take them back. Now I'm not going to sit here and say that,

53
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:20,800
Oh, the, the abused wife should stay with the husband. Obviously not, but I hate this

54
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:26,800
mentality of marriage is simply like having a boyfriend or a girlfriend that lives with you.

55
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:40,800
Okay. All right. We've, we've now hit the end of the tech talk, NPC stream meme. Now we got

56
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:45,360
black guys out here. Role-playing as fucking plantation slaves. I think we've hit the end

57
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:49,760
of the meal. I think it's over now. Okay. Oh God, right at the start of the, I love big pharma shirt.

58
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:57,520
Here we fucking go. What country do you think this is? What the trans flag? What, what are

59
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:06,720
the trans flag look like that? Well, it is England. So I guess the trans flag,

60
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:19,680
all right. What could she say? Game of Thrones. Game of fucking Thrones.

61
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:28,480
That is the Welsh flag. Oh man. The vine sound effect at the end. That first one though,

62
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:34,000
that's the LGBT flag. Well, considering that they literally fly the pride flag instead of the union

63
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,920
Jack and a lot of places in the UK, I guess they're kind of becoming synonymous. I know

64
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:40,480
that's not the union Jack, but it's, it's the English flag, but you know what I mean though?

65
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:44,000
The English flag might as well be the pride flag at this point. Sorry. Sorry,

66
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:49,120
gang members because I celebrated pride. What the KFC fucking forgot my 40 chicken legs.

67
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:59,440
What is this AI shit? My teacher fucking failed me. So I shot her up.

68
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:03,920
My friends shot me to death. Oh my God. This is the gun sound effect. Every time I fucking forgot

69
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:09,120
my 30 chicken sandwiches. So I shot up. My stepfather killed my biological sister. My

70
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:13,840
family got killed by the cartel during vacation. Why are all the black ones related to guns?

71
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:19,520
I cheated on my husband with my son. My neighbor's dog raped my girlfriend. So I

72
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:30,880
shot it to death. I took a shit in a white only restroom. My boyfriend forcefully shoved a stick

73
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:36,560
up my asshole. My friends found out I was gay. So they killed my dogs. I came into a public

74
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:43,840
pool. Child support for 100 women. Hello? I eat three McDonald's big Macs a day. Recently. I

75
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:50,240
almost died due to a fatal heart attack. I was gay. So they disowned me. My pet monkey got me

76
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:59,680
pregnant. I celebrated pride month in the hood. Then 100 games. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. This is

77
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:06,000
clearly AI generated images and AI generated voices saying these ridiculous fucking stories,

78
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:11,360
but like are the stories themselves also AI generated? Some of them have to be like black

79
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:17,760
people shooting up KFCs over forgetting chicken legs. It's gotta be. I refuse to believe that

80
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:22,240
these can actually be real stories. This has to be all AI generated. Like chat GPT has gotta be

81
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:25,760
right in these things. I don't, I don't believe for a second. This is like an actual Reddit story

82
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:30,160
that's being read out here by the Microsoft Sam voices. I mean, it fucking could be, who knows?

83
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:34,960
But also one of them was an Indian woman saying that she got pregnant by a monkey. So probably

84
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:39,440
not. Dude. This one's actually not from Tik TOK. This is like an oldie from vine or Snapchat like

85
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:43,680
10 years ago. This is an oldie, but a goodie. We're going back to show you the shitty shorts

86
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:58,720
that suck ass. Following fat people, following fat people, old school trolling guys. This is

87
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:03,360
from like 2012 or something. You know, I'm a fat guy waddling around the supermarket. I wouldn't

88
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:06,720
mind if he did that. I wouldn't mind going viral for this. It's kind of funny. Jesus.

89
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:10,160
That brings me back. I wonder if you probably couldn't do that on the internet nowadays.

90
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:14,240
Oh God. One of my Twitter mutuals gave me this. Look at this.

91
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,240
Oh my God. Really?

92
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:50,880
What the fuck? Why? Just, just why? Listen, I got a lot of degenerate mutuals on Twitter. Okay.

93
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:53,920
Even my new Twitter account, by the way, follow the new account. I keep getting banned. Follow

94
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:59,600
the new account sleepy underscore Devo. There's so many weirdos on Twitter. And I mean, they're all

95
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:04,240
great, but I don't know what the fuck, like, why'd you post this video? Why do people in the,

96
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:09,200
in the video make it? What is, what is this shit? Okay. This one's the audio list. And I also got

97
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:13,440
a sense for it too. Cause like last week, there's a naked person in it. So what we're looking at is,

98
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:19,840
um, an overweight black woman again, walking down the freeway, naked, just strip naked with a gun.

99
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:24,800
And she's just firing at other passerby in the road, just pointing the gun at random

100
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:29,360
cars on the, on the freeway and just shooting at them. Like this person has to be having a

101
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:33,920
mental break or fucking something dude. Here's what their angle of it. Oh yeah. Fuck the car.

102
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:41,600
There's audio in this one. Holy shit. Yeah. She's shooting. Yeah. She's shooting at random cars,

103
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:52,800
dude. What the fuck? Holy shit, dude. Yeah. Oh my God. Oh my God. Oh my God. Oh my God.

104
00:09:55,760 --> 00:10:00,560
Oh yeah. She's just shooting it. Oh my God. Get the fuck out of there guys.

105
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:07,280
What the fuck? What the fuck? You have to hit her. I think she's ran out. Okay. Let's hope she ran

106
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:15,440
out. Holy shit, dude. Oh my God. Holy shit. Oh my God. Okay. There's like a holy Trinity of naked

107
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:20,080
black women doing weird things in public in terms of tech talk videos. Last week we saw one and this

108
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:24,160
week we saw one, the third one. I don't know if I want to show you cause it's the most grotesque of

109
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:27,680
them all. Um, also I have to censor it as well. Right. It's another, another black woman on the

110
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:33,280
freeway and she's bent over, uh, spreading her butt cheeks at passerby and she's pushing her

111
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:38,720
colon out of her asshole. All right. I saw some porn accounts retweet this and like she was like

112
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:42,880
flexing her gut muscles and she was like red socking. If you know what a red sock is and

113
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:47,760
porn terminology, she was red socking her colon just out of her asshole. And it was, and I was

114
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:54,400
like, Oh, why, why do people keep doing this? Why is everyone so fucked up, dude? What the fuck?

115
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:59,680
Maybe a Jonah Peretti was right about like the schizophrenia of late stage capitalism.

116
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:03,440
Everyone seems fucked up nowadays. All right. When I got time to do one more today and the

117
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:08,160
thumbnail for this one is three girls hanging around LA. So I guarantee you is going to be

118
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:11,760
brain rot. Let's go. How much do you think a guy should spend on an engagement ring? Oh,

119
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:16,240
fuck you. 10 times their salary. Oh my God. Has to be in like the six digits for sure.

120
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:20,240
How much do you think a guy should spend on an engagement ring? I'd say at least like a hundred

121
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:27,040
K. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Like none of these chicks are hot enough to demand that shit. These girls live

122
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:32,160
in fucking LA LA land, dude. I've said it once. I'll say it again. I am so happy to be dating

123
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:37,440
somebody who's actually cool. Holy fuck. All right guys, we've come to the end. I don't even know if

124
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:40,640
I've actually recorded enough to do a full video. It was going to be even over 10 minutes, but you

125
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:45,760
know what? Um, I suddenly have to go out. So this is it. I'm out of here. IRL beckons. I will see

126
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:51,200
you guys next time. Okay. Um, as always stream tonight, make sure you tune in. All right guys,

127
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,040
I'll see you next time. I love you.
