0	5360	Hello everyone, you know what you're here for. It's TikTok Tuesday. Though for a select few of
5360	10880	you, it's not Tuesday, is it? It's probably earlier. That's because I've activated the
10880	16000	ability for certain people to watch the video early. If you hit that YouTube membership button,
16000	20320	you can check out my content. I don't know what exactly to guarantee here. I'm not going to
20320	24320	guarantee anything. It'll be early. It'll be before it comes out usually. How early? That
24320	28640	depends on how lazy I am. But for most of you, you're watching this on Tuesday. And so welcome
28640	34240	to TikTok Tuesday. Let's dive right into this nonsense. If you do nothing about what I'm about
34240	39360	to tell you, the way you use the internet will be forever changed in two days. Oh, let's see.
39360	44240	This is the Kids Online Safety Act or COSA for short. And here's why you should do everything
44240	49040	in your power to prevent this bill from getting passed. Why? If this bill passes the vote for it
49040	55520	on Thursday, the entire internet access of America will be placed under censorship. This bill gives
55520	61840	government officials the right to sue any company that exposes a minor to a controversial topic.
61840	68160	Now, what does that mean? Well, anything on race, gender, sexuality, politics, history, gun control,
68160	74320	your minors, information, anything, everything. And you know what these companies like TikTok,
74320	78560	like Instagram, like Facebook are going to do after this bill gets passed? What do they say?
78560	84160	Well, it's impossible to stop minors from seeing this content. We aren't going to allow it anymore.
84160	86560	You aren't going to be able to talk about these things anymore.
86560	90480	You look pretty young kid. Is this your first time? I don't know enough about this bill to
90480	95680	give you a reasonable dev take one way or the other. All I can say is if the government wants
95680	99120	the internet censored, they're just going to do it. That's just kind of how it's always been.
99120	103760	Something happened like almost like a decade ago now, I think maybe 12 or 13 years with the Channel
103760	108000	Awesome guys showing up at Congress to be like, hey, listen, your regulations will destroy our
108000	112880	business. There was the COPPA thing a few years back. There was the net neutrality conversation.
112880	118240	Every few years, some scare like this shows up. Now the internet has certainly gotten worse and
118240	121920	part of that probably can be chalked up to the government. So fair enough. But this kid is out
121920	126320	here saying, oh no, minors aren't going to be able to see things that minors shouldn't be seeing. Oh,
126320	130720	it's a travesty. Well, I mean, I don't necessarily think that this is the hill that I want to die on
130720	134160	when it comes to protecting internet free speech. I guess we'll have to see how it unfolds.
136560	140160	I don't know about you guys, but I might've seen this girl from somewhere before.
140160	142560	She seems awfully familiar, but I don't know.
142560	146480	Oh, we're comparing stats. Baby girl doesn't know that I am Tom Brady at this game.
147360	153520	Married at 18, divorced at 21, second marriage, married at 25, divorced at 28,
153520	161360	third engagement, engaged at 29, ended it at 30, but I kept the ring. I'm still keeping Tom Brady
161360	169520	on his toes. We should not be afraid to leave these men. We are not stuck with these people.
169520	177520	Marriage is not a sanctimonious thing. It is supposed to be something. It's a commitment
177520	184160	you make to someone, but if you feel like you're not getting anything from that commitment and
184160	188000	you're trying, you got to go, you got to go. It's not a commitment then is it?
188800	194080	I know it's difficult to fill out paperwork and to make appointments and to do all of these things,
194080	197840	but this is your fucking life. Do you want to be stuck with someone?
197840	201840	I'm glad I'm not stuck with you. Okay, that joke at the start of the video aside.
201840	207200	I don't know if I should be taking advice on relationships and marriage and monogamy
207200	213040	from a porn star who's had, as she says, three failed marriages. Perhaps you are not the person
213040	218240	who has the life experience that I can draw valuable information from, at least not in
218240	222800	terms of how to run a successful marriage. It's amazing the mindset of these people, right?
222800	227040	If you say something like marriage isn't the sanctimonious thing, well then it won't be.
227040	230160	The sanctity will be gone if you don't believe in it and how she's like,
230160	234000	well, yeah, it's a commitment, but well then it wasn't much of a commitment, right?
234000	240160	There are things in life that are for life as in they're one way doors. You go through them
240160	244480	and then you are on the other side and there's no going back. One of those things is growing up.
244480	247920	You can't go back and be a kid again. When you're an old man, you can't go back to middle age.
247920	252560	That's just how it is. And there are absolutely should be some choices that once you make,
252560	255360	you shouldn't be able to take them back. Now I'm not going to sit here and say that,
255360	260800	Oh, the, the abused wife should stay with the husband. Obviously not, but I hate this
260800	266800	mentality of marriage is simply like having a boyfriend or a girlfriend that lives with you.
274800	280800	Okay. All right. We've, we've now hit the end of the tech talk, NPC stream meme. Now we got
280800	285360	black guys out here. Role-playing as fucking plantation slaves. I think we've hit the end
285360	289760	of the meal. I think it's over now. Okay. Oh God, right at the start of the, I love big pharma shirt.
289760	297520	Here we fucking go. What country do you think this is? What the trans flag? What, what are
297520	306720	the trans flag look like that? Well, it is England. So I guess the trans flag,
311760	319680	all right. What could she say? Game of Thrones. Game of fucking Thrones.
321200	328480	That is the Welsh flag. Oh man. The vine sound effect at the end. That first one though,
328480	334000	that's the LGBT flag. Well, considering that they literally fly the pride flag instead of the union
334000	337920	Jack and a lot of places in the UK, I guess they're kind of becoming synonymous. I know
337920	340480	that's not the union Jack, but it's, it's the English flag, but you know what I mean though?
340480	344000	The English flag might as well be the pride flag at this point. Sorry. Sorry,
344000	349120	gang members because I celebrated pride. What the KFC fucking forgot my 40 chicken legs.
354800	359440	What is this AI shit? My teacher fucking failed me. So I shot her up.
359440	363920	My friends shot me to death. Oh my God. This is the gun sound effect. Every time I fucking forgot
363920	369120	my 30 chicken sandwiches. So I shot up. My stepfather killed my biological sister. My
369520	373840	family got killed by the cartel during vacation. Why are all the black ones related to guns?
375120	379520	I cheated on my husband with my son. My neighbor's dog raped my girlfriend. So I
379520	390880	shot it to death. I took a shit in a white only restroom. My boyfriend forcefully shoved a stick
390880	396560	up my asshole. My friends found out I was gay. So they killed my dogs. I came into a public
396560	403840	pool. Child support for 100 women. Hello? I eat three McDonald's big Macs a day. Recently. I
403840	410240	almost died due to a fatal heart attack. I was gay. So they disowned me. My pet monkey got me
410240	419680	pregnant. I celebrated pride month in the hood. Then 100 games. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. This is
419680	426000	clearly AI generated images and AI generated voices saying these ridiculous fucking stories,
426000	431360	but like are the stories themselves also AI generated? Some of them have to be like black
431360	437760	people shooting up KFCs over forgetting chicken legs. It's gotta be. I refuse to believe that
437760	442240	these can actually be real stories. This has to be all AI generated. Like chat GPT has gotta be
442240	445760	right in these things. I don't, I don't believe for a second. This is like an actual Reddit story
445760	450160	that's being read out here by the Microsoft Sam voices. I mean, it fucking could be, who knows?
450160	454960	But also one of them was an Indian woman saying that she got pregnant by a monkey. So probably
454960	459440	not. Dude. This one's actually not from Tik TOK. This is like an oldie from vine or Snapchat like
459440	463680	10 years ago. This is an oldie, but a goodie. We're going back to show you the shitty shorts
463680	478720	that suck ass. Following fat people, following fat people, old school trolling guys. This is
478720	483360	from like 2012 or something. You know, I'm a fat guy waddling around the supermarket. I wouldn't
483440	486720	mind if he did that. I wouldn't mind going viral for this. It's kind of funny. Jesus.
486720	490160	That brings me back. I wonder if you probably couldn't do that on the internet nowadays.
491600	494240	Oh God. One of my Twitter mutuals gave me this. Look at this.
507120	508240	Oh my God. Really?
513360	530880	What the fuck? Why? Just, just why? Listen, I got a lot of degenerate mutuals on Twitter. Okay.
530880	533920	Even my new Twitter account, by the way, follow the new account. I keep getting banned. Follow
533920	539600	the new account sleepy underscore Devo. There's so many weirdos on Twitter. And I mean, they're all
539600	544240	great, but I don't know what the fuck, like, why'd you post this video? Why do people in the,
544240	549200	in the video make it? What is, what is this shit? Okay. This one's the audio list. And I also got
549200	553440	a sense for it too. Cause like last week, there's a naked person in it. So what we're looking at is,
553440	559840	um, an overweight black woman again, walking down the freeway, naked, just strip naked with a gun.
559840	564800	And she's just firing at other passerby in the road, just pointing the gun at random
564800	569360	cars on the, on the freeway and just shooting at them. Like this person has to be having a
569360	573920	mental break or fucking something dude. Here's what their angle of it. Oh yeah. Fuck the car.
573920	581600	There's audio in this one. Holy shit. Yeah. She's shooting. Yeah. She's shooting at random cars,
581600	592800	dude. What the fuck? Holy shit, dude. Yeah. Oh my God. Oh my God. Oh my God. Oh my God.
595760	600560	Oh yeah. She's just shooting it. Oh my God. Get the fuck out of there guys.
600560	607280	What the fuck? What the fuck? You have to hit her. I think she's ran out. Okay. Let's hope she ran
607280	615440	out. Holy shit, dude. Oh my God. Holy shit. Oh my God. Okay. There's like a holy Trinity of naked
615440	620080	black women doing weird things in public in terms of tech talk videos. Last week we saw one and this
620080	624160	week we saw one, the third one. I don't know if I want to show you cause it's the most grotesque of
624160	627680	them all. Um, also I have to censor it as well. Right. It's another, another black woman on the
627680	633280	freeway and she's bent over, uh, spreading her butt cheeks at passerby and she's pushing her
633280	638720	colon out of her asshole. All right. I saw some porn accounts retweet this and like she was like
638720	642880	flexing her gut muscles and she was like red socking. If you know what a red sock is and
642880	647760	porn terminology, she was red socking her colon just out of her asshole. And it was, and I was
647760	654400	like, Oh, why, why do people keep doing this? Why is everyone so fucked up, dude? What the fuck?
654400	659680	Maybe a Jonah Peretti was right about like the schizophrenia of late stage capitalism.
659680	663440	Everyone seems fucked up nowadays. All right. When I got time to do one more today and the
663440	668160	thumbnail for this one is three girls hanging around LA. So I guarantee you is going to be
668160	671760	brain rot. Let's go. How much do you think a guy should spend on an engagement ring? Oh,
671760	676240	fuck you. 10 times their salary. Oh my God. Has to be in like the six digits for sure.
676240	680240	How much do you think a guy should spend on an engagement ring? I'd say at least like a hundred
680240	687040	K. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Like none of these chicks are hot enough to demand that shit. These girls live
687040	692160	in fucking LA LA land, dude. I've said it once. I'll say it again. I am so happy to be dating
692160	697440	somebody who's actually cool. Holy fuck. All right guys, we've come to the end. I don't even know if
697440	700640	I've actually recorded enough to do a full video. It was going to be even over 10 minutes, but you
700640	705760	know what? Um, I suddenly have to go out. So this is it. I'm out of here. IRL beckons. I will see
705760	711200	you guys next time. Okay. Um, as always stream tonight, make sure you tune in. All right guys,
711200	713040	I'll see you next time. I love you.
