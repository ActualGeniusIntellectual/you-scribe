00:00.000 --> 00:05.360
Hello everyone, you know what you're here for. It's TikTok Tuesday. Though for a select few of

00:05.360 --> 00:10.880
you, it's not Tuesday, is it? It's probably earlier. That's because I've activated the

00:10.880 --> 00:16.000
ability for certain people to watch the video early. If you hit that YouTube membership button,

00:16.000 --> 00:20.320
you can check out my content. I don't know what exactly to guarantee here. I'm not going to

00:20.320 --> 00:24.320
guarantee anything. It'll be early. It'll be before it comes out usually. How early? That

00:24.320 --> 00:28.640
depends on how lazy I am. But for most of you, you're watching this on Tuesday. And so welcome

00:28.640 --> 00:34.240
to TikTok Tuesday. Let's dive right into this nonsense. If you do nothing about what I'm about

00:34.240 --> 00:39.360
to tell you, the way you use the internet will be forever changed in two days. Oh, let's see.

00:39.360 --> 00:44.240
This is the Kids Online Safety Act or COSA for short. And here's why you should do everything

00:44.240 --> 00:49.040
in your power to prevent this bill from getting passed. Why? If this bill passes the vote for it

00:49.040 --> 00:55.520
on Thursday, the entire internet access of America will be placed under censorship. This bill gives

00:55.520 --> 01:01.840
government officials the right to sue any company that exposes a minor to a controversial topic.

01:01.840 --> 01:08.160
Now, what does that mean? Well, anything on race, gender, sexuality, politics, history, gun control,

01:08.160 --> 01:14.320
your minors, information, anything, everything. And you know what these companies like TikTok,

01:14.320 --> 01:18.560
like Instagram, like Facebook are going to do after this bill gets passed? What do they say?

01:18.560 --> 01:24.160
Well, it's impossible to stop minors from seeing this content. We aren't going to allow it anymore.

01:24.160 --> 01:26.560
You aren't going to be able to talk about these things anymore.

01:26.560 --> 01:30.480
You look pretty young kid. Is this your first time? I don't know enough about this bill to

01:30.480 --> 01:35.680
give you a reasonable dev take one way or the other. All I can say is if the government wants

01:35.680 --> 01:39.120
the internet censored, they're just going to do it. That's just kind of how it's always been.

01:39.120 --> 01:43.760
Something happened like almost like a decade ago now, I think maybe 12 or 13 years with the Channel

01:43.760 --> 01:48.000
Awesome guys showing up at Congress to be like, hey, listen, your regulations will destroy our

01:48.000 --> 01:52.880
business. There was the COPPA thing a few years back. There was the net neutrality conversation.

01:52.880 --> 01:58.240
Every few years, some scare like this shows up. Now the internet has certainly gotten worse and

01:58.240 --> 02:01.920
part of that probably can be chalked up to the government. So fair enough. But this kid is out

02:01.920 --> 02:06.320
here saying, oh no, minors aren't going to be able to see things that minors shouldn't be seeing. Oh,

02:06.320 --> 02:10.720
it's a travesty. Well, I mean, I don't necessarily think that this is the hill that I want to die on

02:10.720 --> 02:14.160
when it comes to protecting internet free speech. I guess we'll have to see how it unfolds.

02:16.560 --> 02:20.160
I don't know about you guys, but I might've seen this girl from somewhere before.

02:20.160 --> 02:22.560
She seems awfully familiar, but I don't know.

02:22.560 --> 02:26.480
Oh, we're comparing stats. Baby girl doesn't know that I am Tom Brady at this game.

02:27.360 --> 02:33.520
Married at 18, divorced at 21, second marriage, married at 25, divorced at 28,

02:33.520 --> 02:41.360
third engagement, engaged at 29, ended it at 30, but I kept the ring. I'm still keeping Tom Brady

02:41.360 --> 02:49.520
on his toes. We should not be afraid to leave these men. We are not stuck with these people.

02:49.520 --> 02:57.520
Marriage is not a sanctimonious thing. It is supposed to be something. It's a commitment

02:57.520 --> 03:04.160
you make to someone, but if you feel like you're not getting anything from that commitment and

03:04.160 --> 03:08.000
you're trying, you got to go, you got to go. It's not a commitment then is it?

03:08.800 --> 03:14.080
I know it's difficult to fill out paperwork and to make appointments and to do all of these things,

03:14.080 --> 03:17.840
but this is your fucking life. Do you want to be stuck with someone?

03:17.840 --> 03:21.840
I'm glad I'm not stuck with you. Okay, that joke at the start of the video aside.

03:21.840 --> 03:27.200
I don't know if I should be taking advice on relationships and marriage and monogamy

03:27.200 --> 03:33.040
from a porn star who's had, as she says, three failed marriages. Perhaps you are not the person

03:33.040 --> 03:38.240
who has the life experience that I can draw valuable information from, at least not in

03:38.240 --> 03:42.800
terms of how to run a successful marriage. It's amazing the mindset of these people, right?

03:42.800 --> 03:47.040
If you say something like marriage isn't the sanctimonious thing, well then it won't be.

03:47.040 --> 03:50.160
The sanctity will be gone if you don't believe in it and how she's like,

03:50.160 --> 03:54.000
well, yeah, it's a commitment, but well then it wasn't much of a commitment, right?

03:54.000 --> 04:00.160
There are things in life that are for life as in they're one way doors. You go through them

04:00.160 --> 04:04.480
and then you are on the other side and there's no going back. One of those things is growing up.

04:04.480 --> 04:07.920
You can't go back and be a kid again. When you're an old man, you can't go back to middle age.

04:07.920 --> 04:12.560
That's just how it is. And there are absolutely should be some choices that once you make,

04:12.560 --> 04:15.360
you shouldn't be able to take them back. Now I'm not going to sit here and say that,

04:15.360 --> 04:20.800
Oh, the, the abused wife should stay with the husband. Obviously not, but I hate this

04:20.800 --> 04:26.800
mentality of marriage is simply like having a boyfriend or a girlfriend that lives with you.

04:34.800 --> 04:40.800
Okay. All right. We've, we've now hit the end of the tech talk, NPC stream meme. Now we got

04:40.800 --> 04:45.360
black guys out here. Role-playing as fucking plantation slaves. I think we've hit the end

04:45.360 --> 04:49.760
of the meal. I think it's over now. Okay. Oh God, right at the start of the, I love big pharma shirt.

04:49.760 --> 04:57.520
Here we fucking go. What country do you think this is? What the trans flag? What, what are

04:57.520 --> 05:06.720
the trans flag look like that? Well, it is England. So I guess the trans flag,

05:11.760 --> 05:19.680
all right. What could she say? Game of Thrones. Game of fucking Thrones.

05:21.200 --> 05:28.480
That is the Welsh flag. Oh man. The vine sound effect at the end. That first one though,

05:28.480 --> 05:34.000
that's the LGBT flag. Well, considering that they literally fly the pride flag instead of the union

05:34.000 --> 05:37.920
Jack and a lot of places in the UK, I guess they're kind of becoming synonymous. I know

05:37.920 --> 05:40.480
that's not the union Jack, but it's, it's the English flag, but you know what I mean though?

05:40.480 --> 05:44.000
The English flag might as well be the pride flag at this point. Sorry. Sorry,

05:44.000 --> 05:49.120
gang members because I celebrated pride. What the KFC fucking forgot my 40 chicken legs.

05:54.800 --> 05:59.440
What is this AI shit? My teacher fucking failed me. So I shot her up.

05:59.440 --> 06:03.920
My friends shot me to death. Oh my God. This is the gun sound effect. Every time I fucking forgot

06:03.920 --> 06:09.120
my 30 chicken sandwiches. So I shot up. My stepfather killed my biological sister. My

06:09.520 --> 06:13.840
family got killed by the cartel during vacation. Why are all the black ones related to guns?

06:15.120 --> 06:19.520
I cheated on my husband with my son. My neighbor's dog raped my girlfriend. So I

06:19.520 --> 06:30.880
shot it to death. I took a shit in a white only restroom. My boyfriend forcefully shoved a stick

06:30.880 --> 06:36.560
up my asshole. My friends found out I was gay. So they killed my dogs. I came into a public

06:36.560 --> 06:43.840
pool. Child support for 100 women. Hello? I eat three McDonald's big Macs a day. Recently. I

06:43.840 --> 06:50.240
almost died due to a fatal heart attack. I was gay. So they disowned me. My pet monkey got me

06:50.240 --> 06:59.680
pregnant. I celebrated pride month in the hood. Then 100 games. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. This is

06:59.680 --> 07:06.000
clearly AI generated images and AI generated voices saying these ridiculous fucking stories,

07:06.000 --> 07:11.360
but like are the stories themselves also AI generated? Some of them have to be like black

07:11.360 --> 07:17.760
people shooting up KFCs over forgetting chicken legs. It's gotta be. I refuse to believe that

07:17.760 --> 07:22.240
these can actually be real stories. This has to be all AI generated. Like chat GPT has gotta be

07:22.240 --> 07:25.760
right in these things. I don't, I don't believe for a second. This is like an actual Reddit story

07:25.760 --> 07:30.160
that's being read out here by the Microsoft Sam voices. I mean, it fucking could be, who knows?

07:30.160 --> 07:34.960
But also one of them was an Indian woman saying that she got pregnant by a monkey. So probably

07:34.960 --> 07:39.440
not. Dude. This one's actually not from Tik TOK. This is like an oldie from vine or Snapchat like

07:39.440 --> 07:43.680
10 years ago. This is an oldie, but a goodie. We're going back to show you the shitty shorts

07:43.680 --> 07:58.720
that suck ass. Following fat people, following fat people, old school trolling guys. This is

07:58.720 --> 08:03.360
from like 2012 or something. You know, I'm a fat guy waddling around the supermarket. I wouldn't

08:03.440 --> 08:06.720
mind if he did that. I wouldn't mind going viral for this. It's kind of funny. Jesus.

08:06.720 --> 08:10.160
That brings me back. I wonder if you probably couldn't do that on the internet nowadays.

08:11.600 --> 08:14.240
Oh God. One of my Twitter mutuals gave me this. Look at this.

08:27.120 --> 08:28.240
Oh my God. Really?

08:33.360 --> 08:50.880
What the fuck? Why? Just, just why? Listen, I got a lot of degenerate mutuals on Twitter. Okay.

08:50.880 --> 08:53.920
Even my new Twitter account, by the way, follow the new account. I keep getting banned. Follow

08:53.920 --> 08:59.600
the new account sleepy underscore Devo. There's so many weirdos on Twitter. And I mean, they're all

08:59.600 --> 09:04.240
great, but I don't know what the fuck, like, why'd you post this video? Why do people in the,

09:04.240 --> 09:09.200
in the video make it? What is, what is this shit? Okay. This one's the audio list. And I also got

09:09.200 --> 09:13.440
a sense for it too. Cause like last week, there's a naked person in it. So what we're looking at is,

09:13.440 --> 09:19.840
um, an overweight black woman again, walking down the freeway, naked, just strip naked with a gun.

09:19.840 --> 09:24.800
And she's just firing at other passerby in the road, just pointing the gun at random

09:24.800 --> 09:29.360
cars on the, on the freeway and just shooting at them. Like this person has to be having a

09:29.360 --> 09:33.920
mental break or fucking something dude. Here's what their angle of it. Oh yeah. Fuck the car.

09:33.920 --> 09:41.600
There's audio in this one. Holy shit. Yeah. She's shooting. Yeah. She's shooting at random cars,

09:41.600 --> 09:52.800
dude. What the fuck? Holy shit, dude. Yeah. Oh my God. Oh my God. Oh my God. Oh my God.

09:55.760 --> 10:00.560
Oh yeah. She's just shooting it. Oh my God. Get the fuck out of there guys.

10:00.560 --> 10:07.280
What the fuck? What the fuck? You have to hit her. I think she's ran out. Okay. Let's hope she ran

10:07.280 --> 10:15.440
out. Holy shit, dude. Oh my God. Holy shit. Oh my God. Okay. There's like a holy Trinity of naked

10:15.440 --> 10:20.080
black women doing weird things in public in terms of tech talk videos. Last week we saw one and this

10:20.080 --> 10:24.160
week we saw one, the third one. I don't know if I want to show you cause it's the most grotesque of

10:24.160 --> 10:27.680
them all. Um, also I have to censor it as well. Right. It's another, another black woman on the

10:27.680 --> 10:33.280
freeway and she's bent over, uh, spreading her butt cheeks at passerby and she's pushing her

10:33.280 --> 10:38.720
colon out of her asshole. All right. I saw some porn accounts retweet this and like she was like

10:38.720 --> 10:42.880
flexing her gut muscles and she was like red socking. If you know what a red sock is and

10:42.880 --> 10:47.760
porn terminology, she was red socking her colon just out of her asshole. And it was, and I was

10:47.760 --> 10:54.400
like, Oh, why, why do people keep doing this? Why is everyone so fucked up, dude? What the fuck?

10:54.400 --> 10:59.680
Maybe a Jonah Peretti was right about like the schizophrenia of late stage capitalism.

10:59.680 --> 11:03.440
Everyone seems fucked up nowadays. All right. When I got time to do one more today and the

11:03.440 --> 11:08.160
thumbnail for this one is three girls hanging around LA. So I guarantee you is going to be

11:08.160 --> 11:11.760
brain rot. Let's go. How much do you think a guy should spend on an engagement ring? Oh,

11:11.760 --> 11:16.240
fuck you. 10 times their salary. Oh my God. Has to be in like the six digits for sure.

11:16.240 --> 11:20.240
How much do you think a guy should spend on an engagement ring? I'd say at least like a hundred

11:20.240 --> 11:27.040
K. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Like none of these chicks are hot enough to demand that shit. These girls live

11:27.040 --> 11:32.160
in fucking LA LA land, dude. I've said it once. I'll say it again. I am so happy to be dating

11:32.160 --> 11:37.440
somebody who's actually cool. Holy fuck. All right guys, we've come to the end. I don't even know if

11:37.440 --> 11:40.640
I've actually recorded enough to do a full video. It was going to be even over 10 minutes, but you

11:40.640 --> 11:45.760
know what? Um, I suddenly have to go out. So this is it. I'm out of here. IRL beckons. I will see

11:45.760 --> 11:51.200
you guys next time. Okay. Um, as always stream tonight, make sure you tune in. All right guys,

11:51.200 --> 11:53.040
I'll see you next time. I love you.
