1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Who are you?

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:11,000
I'm Connor McCloud of the Klen McCloud.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
I was banished from the planet's ice 500 years ago.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
And I cannot die.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
He can't die, that is, unless he's decapitated.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
The year is 2024 and the Highlander, played by French actor Christopher Lambert,

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
is once again trying to save the world,

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
which is in danger this time by the very atmospheric shield

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
he implemented to save the planet in the original Highlander movie.

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
A plot reversal perhaps, but, says Lambert,

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
that was the intention of director Russell Mulcahy

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
to make a sequel that is quite different from the original.

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
You know, generally when you make a sequel, you copy the first movie.

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
To come out of the second, you say,

15
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I've seen it, it's the same as the first one, and Russell wanted to avoid that.

16
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
People might be disappointed by number two,

17
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
but you can't say that it's not a different movie.

18
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Don't worry, we're going to be okay.

19
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Easy for you to say, you don't have to worry about getting killed.

20
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,000
The original Highlander, released in 1985, was not a box office success,

21
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
but became a cult film on the home video market.

22
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
It also starred Christopher Lambert, an actor who rose to stardom

23
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
after his appearance in Greystoke, The Legend of Tarzan.

24
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
He is now one of France's top actors.

25
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
It sounds like magic.

26
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
It is, kind of.

27
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
But we are joined in a way that can never be broken, not even by death.

28
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
When you need me, you'll only have to call my name.

29
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Ramirez!

30
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Greetings, Highlander.

31
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
You called?

32
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,000
The original Highlander and the sequel also star Scottish actor Sean Connery.

33
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,000
He returns as Ramirez, the mentor and teacher to the Highlander.

34
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
The ancient power of the Quickening has joined us.

35
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
We are now as one.

36
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Highlander II, The Quickening, is like the original in at least one way.

37
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,000
It is pure science fiction fantasy, just the kind of film Lambert loves to make.

38
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
That's what I like about movies.

39
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
You know, they make me dream.

40
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I'm in a fantasy world, and it's not that I want to avoid the real world,

41
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
but when I'm making a movie, that's what I want.

42
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
In fact, Lambert becomes so much a part of his fantasy movie world

43
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
that he insists on performing most of the stunt scenes,

44
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
including the sword fighting sequences,

45
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
and says that quite often he gets injured as a result.

46
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
We rehearsed, as I told you, a long time,

47
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
but even though, I mean, when you're in the middle of it,

48
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
it gets messy at one point,

49
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
and then you get a big cut or whatever,

50
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
and that's the way it is.

51
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
It's part of the job, so you just accept it.

52
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Now, in life, my job is not to get fucking the elevator, free-falling elevator.

53
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I'm not going to do that in life. I'm not crazy.

54
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
But in the movie, it's fine.

55
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:18,000
The enormous, surreal set in Highlander II was built near Buenos Aires, Argentina.

56
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
We had such a big set to build.

57
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
We couldn't have built this city in any studio.

58
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
We needed an open space.

59
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
It's true we could have gone somewhere.

60
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
We couldn't find it in Los Angeles, couldn't find it in London,

61
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,000
and that was primarily the reason.

62
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
The other reason was to save money,

63
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,000
but, says Lambert, with the constantly fluctuating Argentinian currency,

64
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
it wasn't really a saving after all.

65
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Go to sleep on a Monday and you wake up on a Tuesday,

66
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
you've lost $2 million.

67
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
It really literally is like, you know, put it in the fire.

68
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
But that you can't know before, so it's impossible to say,

69
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
well, we're not going to shoot anymore in Argentina.

70
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
No, it's a great country.

71
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Both the Highlander films have environmental themes.

72
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
The world is dying because of damage to the ozone layer,

73
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
but Lambert doesn't think this movie message

74
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
precludes the film's primary goal to simply entertain.

75
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
It's not a pretentious movie, it's not an intellectual movie.

76
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
That doesn't mean intellectuals are not going to enjoy it.

77
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I think it's just an entertaining movie, and that's what movies should be.
