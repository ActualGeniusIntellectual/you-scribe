0	5000	Who are you?
5000	11000	I'm Connor McCloud of the Klen McCloud.
11000	16000	I was banished from the planet's ice 500 years ago.
16000	18000	And I cannot die.
18000	21000	He can't die, that is, unless he's decapitated.
21000	26000	The year is 2024 and the Highlander, played by French actor Christopher Lambert,
26000	28000	is once again trying to save the world,
28000	31000	which is in danger this time by the very atmospheric shield
31000	35000	he implemented to save the planet in the original Highlander movie.
35000	38000	A plot reversal perhaps, but, says Lambert,
38000	40000	that was the intention of director Russell Mulcahy
40000	44000	to make a sequel that is quite different from the original.
44000	48000	You know, generally when you make a sequel, you copy the first movie.
48000	50000	To come out of the second, you say,
50000	53000	I've seen it, it's the same as the first one, and Russell wanted to avoid that.
53000	55000	People might be disappointed by number two,
55000	58000	but you can't say that it's not a different movie.
58000	60000	Don't worry, we're going to be okay.
60000	63000	Easy for you to say, you don't have to worry about getting killed.
63000	68000	The original Highlander, released in 1985, was not a box office success,
68000	71000	but became a cult film on the home video market.
71000	74000	It also starred Christopher Lambert, an actor who rose to stardom
74000	77000	after his appearance in Greystoke, The Legend of Tarzan.
77000	80000	He is now one of France's top actors.
80000	82000	It sounds like magic.
82000	84000	It is, kind of.
84000	88000	But we are joined in a way that can never be broken, not even by death.
88000	91000	When you need me, you'll only have to call my name.
93000	96000	Ramirez!
100000	102000	Greetings, Highlander.
102000	104000	You called?
104000	109000	The original Highlander and the sequel also star Scottish actor Sean Connery.
109000	114000	He returns as Ramirez, the mentor and teacher to the Highlander.
126000	129000	The ancient power of the Quickening has joined us.
129000	131000	We are now as one.
131000	135000	Highlander II, The Quickening, is like the original in at least one way.
135000	140000	It is pure science fiction fantasy, just the kind of film Lambert loves to make.
140000	142000	That's what I like about movies.
142000	144000	You know, they make me dream.
144000	148000	I'm in a fantasy world, and it's not that I want to avoid the real world,
148000	150000	but when I'm making a movie, that's what I want.
150000	154000	In fact, Lambert becomes so much a part of his fantasy movie world
154000	157000	that he insists on performing most of the stunt scenes,
157000	159000	including the sword fighting sequences,
159000	162000	and says that quite often he gets injured as a result.
162000	165000	We rehearsed, as I told you, a long time,
165000	168000	but even though, I mean, when you're in the middle of it,
168000	170000	it gets messy at one point,
170000	174000	and then you get a big cut or whatever,
174000	176000	and that's the way it is.
180000	182000	It's part of the job, so you just accept it.
182000	187000	Now, in life, my job is not to get fucking the elevator, free-falling elevator.
187000	190000	I'm not going to do that in life. I'm not crazy.
190000	192000	But in the movie, it's fine.
192000	198000	The enormous, surreal set in Highlander II was built near Buenos Aires, Argentina.
198000	201000	We had such a big set to build.
201000	204000	We couldn't have built this city in any studio.
204000	206000	We needed an open space.
206000	208000	It's true we could have gone somewhere.
208000	211000	We couldn't find it in Los Angeles, couldn't find it in London,
211000	215000	and that was primarily the reason.
215000	217000	The other reason was to save money,
217000	221000	but, says Lambert, with the constantly fluctuating Argentinian currency,
221000	223000	it wasn't really a saving after all.
223000	225000	Go to sleep on a Monday and you wake up on a Tuesday,
225000	227000	you've lost $2 million.
227000	230000	It really literally is like, you know, put it in the fire.
230000	233000	But that you can't know before, so it's impossible to say,
233000	236000	well, we're not going to shoot anymore in Argentina.
236000	238000	No, it's a great country.
238000	241000	Both the Highlander films have environmental themes.
241000	244000	The world is dying because of damage to the ozone layer,
244000	246000	but Lambert doesn't think this movie message
246000	250000	precludes the film's primary goal to simply entertain.
250000	253000	It's not a pretentious movie, it's not an intellectual movie.
253000	256000	That doesn't mean intellectuals are not going to enjoy it.
256000	260000	I think it's just an entertaining movie, and that's what movies should be.
