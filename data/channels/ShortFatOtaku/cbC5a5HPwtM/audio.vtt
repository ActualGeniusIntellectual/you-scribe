00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
Who are you?

00:05.000 --> 00:11.000
I'm Connor McCloud of the Klen McCloud.

00:11.000 --> 00:16.000
I was banished from the planet's ice 500 years ago.

00:16.000 --> 00:18.000
And I cannot die.

00:18.000 --> 00:21.000
He can't die, that is, unless he's decapitated.

00:21.000 --> 00:26.000
The year is 2024 and the Highlander, played by French actor Christopher Lambert,

00:26.000 --> 00:28.000
is once again trying to save the world,

00:28.000 --> 00:31.000
which is in danger this time by the very atmospheric shield

00:31.000 --> 00:35.000
he implemented to save the planet in the original Highlander movie.

00:35.000 --> 00:38.000
A plot reversal perhaps, but, says Lambert,

00:38.000 --> 00:40.000
that was the intention of director Russell Mulcahy

00:40.000 --> 00:44.000
to make a sequel that is quite different from the original.

00:44.000 --> 00:48.000
You know, generally when you make a sequel, you copy the first movie.

00:48.000 --> 00:50.000
To come out of the second, you say,

00:50.000 --> 00:53.000
I've seen it, it's the same as the first one, and Russell wanted to avoid that.

00:53.000 --> 00:55.000
People might be disappointed by number two,

00:55.000 --> 00:58.000
but you can't say that it's not a different movie.

00:58.000 --> 01:00.000
Don't worry, we're going to be okay.

01:00.000 --> 01:03.000
Easy for you to say, you don't have to worry about getting killed.

01:03.000 --> 01:08.000
The original Highlander, released in 1985, was not a box office success,

01:08.000 --> 01:11.000
but became a cult film on the home video market.

01:11.000 --> 01:14.000
It also starred Christopher Lambert, an actor who rose to stardom

01:14.000 --> 01:17.000
after his appearance in Greystoke, The Legend of Tarzan.

01:17.000 --> 01:20.000
He is now one of France's top actors.

01:20.000 --> 01:22.000
It sounds like magic.

01:22.000 --> 01:24.000
It is, kind of.

01:24.000 --> 01:28.000
But we are joined in a way that can never be broken, not even by death.

01:28.000 --> 01:31.000
When you need me, you'll only have to call my name.

01:33.000 --> 01:36.000
Ramirez!

01:40.000 --> 01:42.000
Greetings, Highlander.

01:42.000 --> 01:44.000
You called?

01:44.000 --> 01:49.000
The original Highlander and the sequel also star Scottish actor Sean Connery.

01:49.000 --> 01:54.000
He returns as Ramirez, the mentor and teacher to the Highlander.

02:06.000 --> 02:09.000
The ancient power of the Quickening has joined us.

02:09.000 --> 02:11.000
We are now as one.

02:11.000 --> 02:15.000
Highlander II, The Quickening, is like the original in at least one way.

02:15.000 --> 02:20.000
It is pure science fiction fantasy, just the kind of film Lambert loves to make.

02:20.000 --> 02:22.000
That's what I like about movies.

02:22.000 --> 02:24.000
You know, they make me dream.

02:24.000 --> 02:28.000
I'm in a fantasy world, and it's not that I want to avoid the real world,

02:28.000 --> 02:30.000
but when I'm making a movie, that's what I want.

02:30.000 --> 02:34.000
In fact, Lambert becomes so much a part of his fantasy movie world

02:34.000 --> 02:37.000
that he insists on performing most of the stunt scenes,

02:37.000 --> 02:39.000
including the sword fighting sequences,

02:39.000 --> 02:42.000
and says that quite often he gets injured as a result.

02:42.000 --> 02:45.000
We rehearsed, as I told you, a long time,

02:45.000 --> 02:48.000
but even though, I mean, when you're in the middle of it,

02:48.000 --> 02:50.000
it gets messy at one point,

02:50.000 --> 02:54.000
and then you get a big cut or whatever,

02:54.000 --> 02:56.000
and that's the way it is.

03:00.000 --> 03:02.000
It's part of the job, so you just accept it.

03:02.000 --> 03:07.000
Now, in life, my job is not to get fucking the elevator, free-falling elevator.

03:07.000 --> 03:10.000
I'm not going to do that in life. I'm not crazy.

03:10.000 --> 03:12.000
But in the movie, it's fine.

03:12.000 --> 03:18.000
The enormous, surreal set in Highlander II was built near Buenos Aires, Argentina.

03:18.000 --> 03:21.000
We had such a big set to build.

03:21.000 --> 03:24.000
We couldn't have built this city in any studio.

03:24.000 --> 03:26.000
We needed an open space.

03:26.000 --> 03:28.000
It's true we could have gone somewhere.

03:28.000 --> 03:31.000
We couldn't find it in Los Angeles, couldn't find it in London,

03:31.000 --> 03:35.000
and that was primarily the reason.

03:35.000 --> 03:37.000
The other reason was to save money,

03:37.000 --> 03:41.000
but, says Lambert, with the constantly fluctuating Argentinian currency,

03:41.000 --> 03:43.000
it wasn't really a saving after all.

03:43.000 --> 03:45.000
Go to sleep on a Monday and you wake up on a Tuesday,

03:45.000 --> 03:47.000
you've lost $2 million.

03:47.000 --> 03:50.000
It really literally is like, you know, put it in the fire.

03:50.000 --> 03:53.000
But that you can't know before, so it's impossible to say,

03:53.000 --> 03:56.000
well, we're not going to shoot anymore in Argentina.

03:56.000 --> 03:58.000
No, it's a great country.

03:58.000 --> 04:01.000
Both the Highlander films have environmental themes.

04:01.000 --> 04:04.000
The world is dying because of damage to the ozone layer,

04:04.000 --> 04:06.000
but Lambert doesn't think this movie message

04:06.000 --> 04:10.000
precludes the film's primary goal to simply entertain.

04:10.000 --> 04:13.000
It's not a pretentious movie, it's not an intellectual movie.

04:13.000 --> 04:16.000
That doesn't mean intellectuals are not going to enjoy it.

04:16.000 --> 04:20.000
I think it's just an entertaining movie, and that's what movies should be.
