0	11000	This video is going to be one where I jibber-jab for a while on a topic with minimal quotations or clips or sources
11000	16000	because it's less about analyzing an event or somebody else's idea and more about presenting my own idea.
16000	21000	For this kind of video I used to use this artwork but at this point I've moved away from this kind of thing and more into the animated backgrounds.
21000	25000	No, it's not because butters made me look like a gorilla. It's got nothing to do with it.
25000	28000	Today we're going to explore the phrase harm reduction.
28000	32000	It's a phrase that is almost always used in the context of recreational drug use.
32000	36000	harmreduction.org, the website of the National Harm Reduction Coalition,
36000	42000	defines harm reduction as a set of practical strategies and ideas aimed at reducing negative consequences associated with drug use
42000	49000	and also a movement for social justice built on a belief end and respect for the rights of people who use drugs.
49000	56000	Harm reduction incorporates a spectrum of strategies that include safer use, managed use, abstinence, meeting people who use drugs where they're at
56000	59000	and addressing conditions of use along with the use itself.
59000	67000	Because harm reduction demands that interventions and policies designed to serve people who use drugs reflect specific individual and community needs
67000	71000	there is no universal definition of or formula for implementing harm reduction.
71000	76000	Listen, if this is a social justice movement I already expected to disregard that individual component of their philosophy.
76000	83000	But at the same time therapy to get over addictions, hell therapy for almost anything, always has to be individually tailored for the person for it to work.
83000	87000	So I wonder how they deal with the discrepancy. But it's that earlier list that's much more interesting to me.
87000	90000	Firstly, abstinence is pretty much the solution to everything believe it or not.
90000	94000	The issue is that if they're already tempted almost nobody can stick to abstinence.
94000	97000	It works for drugs, for sex, for overeating, for pretty much everything.
97000	102000	Generally if you don't do the behavior that you consider to be toxic you won't suffer the effects of having done it.
102000	105000	It seems pretty obvious right? It is of course not so simple.
105000	109000	Consider your average religious straight man who views being gay as a sin.
110000	115000	But he's not tempted to do it, so abstaining from that behavior is actually pretty easy.
115000	122000	But a drug addict who wants to stop doing drugs, or a fat person who wants to stop overeating, a sex addict who wants to stop having sex, it's not easy at all.
122000	124000	It's the correct thing to do, but it's not easy.
124000	128000	And by the way, child molesters who want to stop molesting children can be put in this boat too.
128000	132000	Obviously we have very good reasons to consider them monstrous, I'm not against that.
132000	137000	But the difference between a normal person who is not attracted to kids and a child molester isn't just a moral one.
137000	144000	In other words, if you were the exact same person but you just had a lower moral fiber, there's no reason to expect that you'd go off and diddle kids yourself.
144000	151000	It's not like we all desire sex with children, and our superior moral sense is what prevents us from doing it, even though some pedos might actually believe that to be the case.
151000	155000	We don't do it because we don't want to, regardless of our moral views.
155000	161000	If you actually have the desire to fuck kids and only your morality prevents you from doing so, well uh, good job on that I guess.
161000	163000	But that's not the majority of humanity.
163000	166000	Anyway, that's the abstinence position. Entirely correct, but hard to do.
166000	169000	The second point is safer use and managed use.
169000	176000	This is where you get shit like San Francisco handing out clean needles and Vancouver handing out safe supply of heroin or whatever, as if there could ever be such a thing.
176000	184000	The idea behind this is, if people are going to use drugs anyway, we should make it as safe as possible to do so so that the harm done is minimized.
184000	192000	I understand the logic. If a heroin user has a clean needle, then they're only doing heroin, not doing heroin along with spreading blood-borne infections like hepatitis or HIV.
192000	200000	The issue is, of course, is that the people who advocate for harm reduction have forgotten that the path to actually kicking an addiction is often not enabling the addiction but limiting it.
200000	203000	There are some people out there who aren't in too deep yet.
203000	209000	These people, if suddenly their supply of drugs was too hard to get or too unsafe to use, they'd be able to give it up.
209000	217000	But if some dumbfuck hipster prog is on the street corner handing out clean needles and drugs as a part of a harm reduction program, that guy's chances of kicking the habit are basically zero.
217000	225000	Then there are some people who are in way too deep. These are people who, even if there is no safe supply, they'll just say, fuck it, I'll go shoot up with the HIV needle in the trap house.
225000	232000	For these people, the harm reduction view might make some sense, but it can still ultimately act as a barrier preventing them from getting their lives together.
232000	237000	Most people who manage to overcome their addictions do so only after suffering a major loss.
237000	243000	Hitting rock bottom, it's colloquially called, though I don't really like that term because things can always get worse no matter how bad they currently are.
243000	247000	But you know what I mean, a drug user might need to get arrested before he decides to seriously give it up.
247000	251000	A fat guy might need to suffer a heart attack before he starts getting in shape, you know, stuff like this.
251000	262000	That kind of stark realization that your actions have consequences and you are about to suffer those consequences right now, that is a splash of cold water in the face that care and coddling cannot replicate.
262000	270000	Some people don't survive their encounter with rock bottom. Some people become desensitized to being at rock bottom such that major catastrophes become everyday occurrences to them.
271000	284000	These aren't good outcomes either, obviously, but because harm reduction principles prevent people from ever reaching that rock bottom, that of a desire to prevent those two worse outcomes, they also prevent people from reaching the better outcome, the one where you shake off the shackles on your own.
284000	291000	Let me try to visualize it. If we start at the top, pre-addiction, and we work our way to the bottom as addiction progresses, hitting that low point gives us one of two options.
291000	294000	Either we stay there or we die, or we recover and we move upward.
294000	303000	Harm reduction prevents us from ever hitting those worse options, but they also enable and prolong the addiction, preventing us from also having that transformative event, from moving through hell and coming out the other side.
303000	311000	The counter to this, from the harm reduction camp, however, is a strong one, and it's where we get to that third point, meeting people who use drugs where they're at and addressing conditions of use.
311000	322000	Clearly, if, for example, you have an alcoholic who's been drinking because he lost his job and lost his girlfriend, it's not entirely clear if he's strictly an alcoholic, especially if he stops drinking after getting his job and his girlfriend back.
322000	331000	A lot of harm reductionists view rock bottom as a myth. There's never any glaring sign in the moment that you've hit rock bottom. That's something that you can only realize after you've recovered.
331000	336000	So you should start simply improving now, incrementally, and then look back on your journey later and then evaluate it.
336000	343000	And like I said before, things can always be worse. Is getting discovered by your mom with a needle hanging out of your arm really rock bottom? It might be.
343000	349000	But it can always get worse. Imagine getting arrested for it. Imagine going to jail, being homeless, being estranged from everybody you care about.
349000	355000	Any moment can be a rock bottom, even if there are theoretical worst moments, and there are always theoretical worst moments.
355000	364000	I've talked in recent videos about the power of incremental change and about how socialists aim for the Utopia and become embittered that reality doesn't conform to their standards.
364000	374000	Making a positive move every day, rather than immediately leaping to the end without the ability to stay there, is often better for you because when you do finally reach the end of the journey, your chance of relapsing is a whole lot less.
374000	380000	It would seem to me that the abstinence position is the utopian one, the leaping to the end one, and the meet people where they're at position is the incremental one.
380000	382000	That's one point for the harm reductionists.
382000	390000	But at the same time, does it really seem realistic that if you give a heroin addict a safe supply of heroin, that your action will someday lead him to not using heroin?
390000	393000	Or will he just keep coming to you as his new supplier?
393000	399000	If you start to wean him off of the heroin, will he complain? Will he just find somebody else? Have you only prolonged his suffering?
399000	411000	How do you know that the heroin addict that you're supplying is actually moving towards bettering himself, and is actually willing to use less and less and less of your safe supply every time you see him, and he's not just getting his fix with no aim towards improvement?
411000	415000	If your answer is, take him at his word, I don't think you've ever spoken to a junkie before.
415000	421000	And if your answer is, it doesn't matter if he ever gets better, at least he's not getting worse, then I refer you back to my visualization.
421000	426000	Why would we take actions that stagnate people in no man's land, just because some of them would not survive the trials ahead?
426000	432000	Is it better to exist in limbo, coddled by those who supply you, or to roll the dice and take a chance on being your own man again?
432000	435000	This visualization works for so many things beyond drug use.
435000	444000	It works to describe people who simply exist as a wagie while living at the whims of other people, versus those who try to start their own businesses, where some may fail and some may succeed.
444000	449000	It works to describe people who are too scared to try and find partners, versus people who put themselves out there and get rejected and get laid.
449000	453000	This is a map of people who are risk adverse versus risk takers in general.
453000	459000	Risk takers don't do it simply because of the high risk high reward aspect, though that's certainly a part of it, but there's also non-material motivations.
459000	463000	Some people want to have the pride in standing on their own two feet. Some people want freedom. Some people want control.
463000	466000	And encountering the risk itself is its own thrill as well.
466000	471000	I don't know if harm reduction policies actually work all that well. Intuitively, I would have to say, probably not.
471000	473000	But rationally, I think it depends on what kind of person you're dealing with.
473000	476000	Some people are able to wean themselves off their addiction with a nudge in the right direction.
476000	478000	Some people need to burn their lives down before they figure it out.
479000	485000	It's a fundamental difference in personality, and simply saying, give them safe supply is a one-size-fits-all solution to an individualist problem.
485000	488000	Haha, remember when I said they'd have to abandon the individualist position?
488000	492000	But we've moved off the addiction conversation and more towards a risk adverse conversation.
492000	500000	And that's appropriate, because while harm reduction is a phrase overwhelmingly used in the context of addiction, commies and progs have also adopted it to refer to their politics.
500000	502000	They use it to refer to healthcare for obvious reasons.
503000	509000	They use it to refer to sex work, saying that prostitutes are forced into the job by their material conditions and we shouldn't be making it any worse for them.
509000	522000	They use it to refer to just a general push towards socialism, because the total harm of the world is reduced if we harm 1% of the population by stealing their stuff and distributing it to the 99%, alleviating all of their harm.
522000	523000	But is that really acceptable?
523000	530000	Hurting a group, not because they deserve it, not giving them any justice or recompense for it, but because doing so will help some larger group?
530000	533000	Would we accept that if we were talking about a race or an ethnicity?
533000	536000	We've already rejected that logic throughout our history multiple times now.
536000	543000	The socialist counter to this argument is that unlike the Jews and the Germans, or the blacks and the whites, the 1% does actually harm the 99%.
543000	547000	And that's when you go down the commie rabbit hole of employment is actually exploitation.
547000	552000	The worker cannot consent to having his surplus value stripped of him by his boss, because the alternative is starvation.
552000	556000	Starvation is the gun that capital owners hold to the head of the proletariat.
556000	558000	So let's examine the proposition.
558000	560000	Harm reduction. What counts as harm?
560000	566000	In fact, leftoids will ask the question, where is the harm all the time, when trying to justify their objections to conservative views on traditional morality.
566000	568000	And you know what? That's actually a fair question to ask.
568000	571000	But let's start with the dictionary definition and then work out from there.
571000	575000	For the normies, harm is defined as physical injury, especially that which is deliberately inflicted.
575000	577000	My Prague sensors are already going off.
577000	581000	They would most certainly view wrong speech as harmful, so let's remove that word physical.
581000	584000	Now the definition is injury, especially that which is deliberately inflicted.
584000	590000	Any leftoid worth their weight in sex positivity will bring up the BDSM example, where people regularly harm each other during sex.
590000	593000	The difference there is that those people are consenting.
593000	596000	So the concept of consent needs to be added to the definition.
596000	597000	If you consent, it's not harm.
597000	602000	Now the definition looks like injury, especially that which is deliberately inflicted without consent.
602000	606000	We already know that socialists disregard consent if they believe that power dynamics are at play.
606000	612000	You can't truly consent to employment, even if you enthusiastically want to work because of the dynamic between worker and boss.
612000	616000	However, this is ultimately a carbon copy of the radical feminist view on consent.
616000	621000	According to those people, women cannot truly consent to sex with men because of the power dynamics at play between women and men.
621000	627000	Most sex-positive socialists will reject this argument by saying that despite the man-woman power dynamic,
627000	632000	a woman having sex with a man that she consents to do it with, that act is still in her interest.
632000	634000	The interest being, in this case, the sex that she wants to have.
634000	638000	But the interest of the worker is always diametrically opposed to the interest of the boss.
639000	642000	And so employment can never be consensual, no matter how enthusiastic.
642000	646000	So now the concept of interest is introduced to the definition.
646000	652000	In order to include these cases, the definition of harm must now read something like injury against the interest of the injured party.
652000	661000	The inclusion of interest subsumes deliberate infliction, as you can still be surprised at a random circumstance that is for or against your interests, and still be hurt or not hurt by it.
661000	669000	Interest also subsumes consent, as the leftist has already admitted that consent against your interest is invalid, while consent in your interest is valid.
669000	673000	That's the difference between the man-woman scenario and the worker-boss scenario.
673000	678000	And this definition tracks not only with employment and sex, but also, say, with suicide.
678000	684000	Where we can frame the suicidal person as not acting in their own interest, despite clearly consenting to take their own life.
684000	689000	It can also track with working out, where working out can certainly inflict harm, but it's also in your interest to do so.
689000	702000	So, if the leftist definition of harm is something approximating an injury against the interest of the injured party, harm reduction, in a political sense, not just with the drugs, ends up coming out as something like reducing injuries not in my interest.
702000	706000	In other words, harm reduction simply means minimizing things that I don't like.
706000	710000	It's harm reduction to spread rumors about people who might oppose me, whether or not those rumors are true.
710000	714000	It's harm reduction to ensure that my political opponents lose an election, whether it happens fairly or not.
714000	718000	It's harm reduction to do what it takes to win, even if the win is illegitimate.
718000	722000	You call it selling out your principles, I call it fucking winning.
722000	725000	And that's my principle.
725000	726000	To win-
726000	730000	Okay, okay, I know it's like the third time in a row that I use that clip, I won't use it again. You get the point.
730000	736000	The ultimate problem with the question, where is the harm, isn't that it doesn't sometimes uncover some good context. It certainly does.
736000	738000	The problem is that it's not the right question to ask.
738000	743000	When examining a course of action, you shouldn't be saying, where is the harm, but where is the virtue.
743000	748000	It's not about figuring out which action is the least bad, so you can calculate how much bad you can get away with.
748000	750000	It's about figuring out which action is actually good.
750000	754000	Harm reduction is constantly putting out fires without ever actually contributing towards a positive vision.
754000	762000	I did that video recently called, The Crime of Being, where I described how what lies at the very bottom of the socialist ethic is a hatred of having been born.
762000	765000	And how the left is just constantly miserable all the time.
765000	770000	And it's like, yes, obviously, all you do is talk about how much you need to harm reduce your way to the utopia.
770000	773000	As if there is any utopia in the mediocrity of perpetuating a limbo.
773000	779000	There is no positive vision of the future here. There's no less junkies. There's only cleaner needles.
779000	783000	I like Merrick, she's one of the few commies online that I can stand for any length of time.
783000	790000	But in the past month, I've randomly tuned into three of her streams and each time it's been about how depressed and tired she is with politics.
790000	798000	At the same time, Taftage recently clued me into Bo Burnham Inside, where Burnham's two jokes are basically just, I'm depressed and I'm progressive.
798000	803000	Is there any fucking wonder that leftoids are like this? They don't have a positive, achievable vision of the future.
803000	806000	They spend all their time putting out fires by pouring gasoline on them.
806000	811000	They have no ability to actually think towards the future. They only see the immediate issues right in front of them.
811000	813000	In Hoppian terms, they have a low time preference.
813000	818000	Very quickly, time preference is a concept in economics. And caps love it, but it's actually pretty universally applicable.
818000	821000	Describing a rational actor's focus regarding relative valuation.
821000	825000	If you have a low time preference, you're more likely to shoot for short-term gain.
825000	831000	And if the future isn't guaranteed, then this is the most rational position. Get while the getting is good. Don't save up resources for a future that may not exist.
831000	836000	If you have a high time preference, you are more likely to delay gratification in order to receive a larger payout.
836000	839000	This is where you're working hard and saving and investing for the future.
839000	842000	Having a low time preference is something that a leftist would have.
842000	844000	They believe the world is going to end within the next decade.
844000	849000	And that the only thing that they can do is try to reduce the amount of harm, even if it creates more harm in the future because the future is hell.
849000	851000	And anything they build up will be destroyed anyway.
851000	856000	It's an apocalyptic vision that I don't think is actually going to come to pass, but it explains a lot of left-wing behavior.
856000	865000	If the world isn't actually going to end within our lifetimes, the meta-leftist worldview is irrational and self-destructive and ultimately makes society a whole lot worse, which is why we are where we are.
865000	870000	We've got tons of people out there all doing stuff that, to any normal human being, is completely ridiculous.
870000	872000	Why are you giving out heroin to addicts?
872000	875000	But from within their apocalyptic frame, it makes perfect sense.
875000	882000	A lot of other leftist moves within education or activism or whatever else are downstream from getting as many people as possible to buy in to the death cult.
882000	885000	And if you don't buy in, they can always fall back and call you a racist.
885000	888000	Forget all of that. Forget being called a racist if you don't self-destruct.
888000	894000	If you're deciding on your next course of action, ask yourself not where is the harm, but instead where is the virtue.
894000	896000	You get to decide what the virtue is you're pursuing.
896000	900000	Are you trying to study and get through school? Are you trying to lose some body fat? Kick a bad habit?
900000	903000	Your conscience will tell you what you need to pursue, if you're willing to listen to it.
903000	905000	And then you judge your actions based on that standard.
905000	909000	Not somebody else's standard. Not where is the harm. That's the wrong question to ask.
909000	915000	If you have to hem and haw about whether or not some vice impedes your progress, or does it really hurt that badly, that should be a warning sign to you.
915000	918000	Discover what you want, and then pursue it.
