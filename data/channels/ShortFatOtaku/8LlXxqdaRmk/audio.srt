1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,720
So, y'all heard about Drag Queen Story Hour?

2
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:11,880
No, this video isn't about Drag Queen Story Hour.

3
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:13,600
I'm sure you guys know the tale at this point.

4
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:17,920
It was a big deal by some people on the right a year or so ago, I think it might have been

5
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:21,380
a little bit more than a year, where there were drag queens at libraries telling stories

6
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:22,380
to kids.

7
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:25,540
And people on the right were saying that this is, this is degenerate, this is sick, who

8
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:27,880
knows if these drag queens are pedophiles or not.

9
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:30,920
People on the left were saying, you're ridiculous, it's harmless.

10
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:36,360
And then it turned out that Brett Blohm, who is a children's court judge and former president

11
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:41,720
of Cream City, was arrested a little while ago on charges of child pornography.

12
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:46,680
As you can see, his LinkedIn shows this to be the case, as does his employment page on

13
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:48,880
the Cream City Foundation website.

14
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:51,920
However, Snopes.com has debunked it.

15
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:56,720
No, Drag Queen Story Hour leader wasn't arrested on child porn charges.

16
00:00:56,720 --> 00:01:02,160
Now Snopes has rated this as false, and the meat of the fact checking article says that

17
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:09,380
the Cream City Foundation, which is what Blohm was the president and CEO of, is a Milwaukee

18
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:15,240
based LGBTQ advocacy group that offers grants and scholarships.

19
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:20,040
The Cream City Foundation was the fiscal sponsor to Drag Queen Story Hour's Milwaukee chapter.

20
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:24,980
So it turns out that Drag Queen Story Hour Milwaukee has never been run by the Cream

21
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:29,900
City Foundation or Brett Blohm, and they've never participated in planning, organizing,

22
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:31,900
hosting, or performing any of the events.

23
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:34,300
They've only taken donations from them.

24
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:39,740
Of course, there's also the fact that the same organization actually did have a registered

25
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:44,540
child sex offender read the kids in drag in a different city.

26
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:47,500
So I don't blame people for making a few connections here.

27
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:51,700
If we were to talk about this objectively, you will notice that in terms of this specific

28
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:56,900
case, there is little in the way of direct evidence, but there is a lot of circumstantial

29
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:57,900
evidence.

30
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:03,900
That being said, when Snopes.com rates this officially, puts their stamp on everything

31
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:06,940
as false, do you believe them?

32
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:07,940
Should you?

33
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:13,240
The errors in fact checking sites like Snopes has been an ongoing meme now for a while,

34
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:14,240
and with good reason.

35
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,340
Let me show you what I mean.

36
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:17,720
Here's another story that Snopes fact checked.

37
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:21,800
Has Iowa seen an alarming increase in vanishing children this summer?

38
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:25,600
Statistics sound much scarier when presented without any context whatsoever.

39
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:26,600
Oh damn.

40
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:30,640
The claim is the state of Iowa has seen an alarming increase in vanishing children reports

41
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,560
in the summer of 2018.

42
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,840
They have rated it as mostly false.

43
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:39,000
What you'll notice is that in fact checking articles where they're trying to obfuscate

44
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,360
something, they will make them extremely long.

45
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:45,000
Usually these things are quite short if it's just to the point, and then they'll actually

46
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,400
hide the truth in the final paragraph.

47
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:52,200
While the missing persons numbers presented by Free Thought Project were accurate at the

48
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:56,600
time of publication, the implication that they were presented an alarming trend or deviation

49
00:02:56,600 --> 00:03:00,680
from normal rates of missing persons was without basis.

50
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:04,920
So this group that published the numbers, Free Thought Project, they were still correct.

51
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:08,800
For some reason you got an implication there that may not have actually been in the article,

52
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,520
but the data itself was right.

53
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:16,460
And if the data itself was right, why do you feel the need to say Rachel Blevins penned

54
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:20,660
an article for the conspiracy prone site Free Thought Project?

55
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:22,740
Why say conspiracy prone site?

56
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:27,020
If it really is fact checking, if it's just the facts, ma'am, why are you adding those

57
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:28,580
kind of flourishes?

58
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:32,260
Is the COVID-19 vaccine female sterilization?

59
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:34,220
This is a big one.

60
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:35,900
That's completely false apparently.

61
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:40,900
The story was sourced from a blog called Health and Money News and reference statements made

62
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:44,180
by Michael Yeddon, who left the company in 2011.

63
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:49,900
His title there was Vice President and Chief Scientist for Allergy and Respiratory.

64
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:53,100
So he's somebody who probably knows at least a little bit about this.

65
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:58,220
Yeddon sent a letter calling on EMA to halt clinical trials of the COVID-19 vaccine in

66
00:03:58,220 --> 00:03:59,220
the EU.

67
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:03,380
In the letter, he stated that the vaccine blocks a protein that is key in the formation

68
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:05,340
of the placenta in mammals.

69
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:09,820
And they claimed it's possible women who received the vaccine could become infertile.

70
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:14,020
They did not state as fact that the vaccine causes sterility.

71
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:20,380
The Associated Press reported the vaccine is still considered experimental while final

72
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:22,200
testing is done.

73
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:28,300
So we have an instance where it's not clear, like I'm not going to make any kind of grand

74
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:33,700
proclamations regarding what this vaccine actually does, but we can safely and honestly

75
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:35,700
say it's not clear.

76
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:37,200
We don't know yet.

77
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:40,880
Somebody who is an expert says that infertility might happen.

78
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:45,600
But on a technical, medical level, infertility is not sterility.

79
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,240
So Snopes found this false.

80
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:52,700
Did AOC exaggerate the danger she was in during the Capitol riot?

81
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:58,120
The claim is AOC exaggerated the danger she was in during the riot in that she wasn't

82
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:02,980
even in the Capitol building where the rioting occurred, and that is in quotes, wasn't even

83
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:04,400
in the Capitol building.

84
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:07,640
Again, Snopes rates it mostly false.

85
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:08,640
What's true?

86
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:12,540
AOC wasn't in the main Capitol building where the House and Senate chambers are located.

87
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:18,080
So literally, the main contention that you quoted in the claim is true, and yet this

88
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:20,000
is mostly false to Snopes.

89
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,860
What's false is that AOC never claimed to be in the main Capitol building, and when

90
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:27,920
the attack began, she was in her office, which is located in a network of office buildings

91
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:31,480
immediately surrounding the Capitol, and her office building was one of the two buildings

92
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,720
that were evacuated.

93
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:38,240
Okay, but the claim was that she wasn't even in the Capitol building, and that was true.

94
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:43,520
Did a convicted terrorist sit on the board of a Black Lives Matter funding body?

95
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:47,600
The past crimes of Susan Rosenberg reemerged in the summer of 2020.

96
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:52,300
The claim is that Rosenberg is a convicted terrorist who sits on the board of the Directors

97
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:57,520
of Thousand Currents, an organization which handles fundraising for the BLM global network.

98
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:00,280
Snopes rated this as a mixture.

99
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:01,400
So what's true?

100
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:06,280
Rosenberg has served as vice chair of the board of directors for Thousand Currents,

101
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:11,880
and she was an active member of revolutionary left-wing movements whose illegal activities

102
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:16,400
included bombing US government buildings and committing armed robberies.

103
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,000
What's undetermined?

104
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:24,560
In the absence of a single, universally agreed definition of terrorism, it is a matter of

105
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:29,840
subjective determination as to whether the actions for which Rosenberg was convicted

106
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:34,600
and imprisoned, possession of weapons, and hundreds of pounds of explosives should be

107
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:37,320
described as acts of domestic terrorism.

108
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:42,640
There is no way that any reasonable person would not look at this and see Snopes trying

109
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:46,080
to cover something up, playing ball for their team.

110
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:51,920
If it were the inverse, if it were, say, the guy who rammed his car into a crowd, and I

111
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:56,080
think that was Charlottesville, if it were that guy who gets invited to sit on like a

112
00:06:56,080 --> 00:07:01,580
right-wing board 10 years or 20 years later, Snopes would be writing these fact-checking

113
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:07,600
articles saying, it's true, he's a terrorist, 100%, and people would be up in fucking arms

114
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,600
about it.

115
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:09,600
And you know what?

116
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,600
Rightfully so.

117
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:16,600
This is a person who went to jail on terrorism charges, but because it's left-wing terrorism,

118
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,340
Snopes goes to bat for them.

119
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:24,580
Did US presidential candidate Joe Biden say he had no empathy for the plight of younger

120
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:25,580
people?

121
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:26,580
Hmm.

122
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:27,760
Oh, look, it's mixed.

123
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:28,760
What's true?

124
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:34,200
In 2018, Biden did say he had no empathy for the plight of younger people.

125
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:36,200
What the fuck else do you need?

126
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,360
What's false?

127
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:42,800
Biden was making a specific and emphatic comparison between the relative progress and civility

128
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:47,280
of the present moment on one hand, and the upheaval and civil discord of his own youth

129
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,180
in the late 1960s.

130
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:52,400
He was not speaking in general or absolute terms.

131
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:57,280
If you switch this around, again, if this were Trump saying something, they'd be hitting

132
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:00,320
it with true, and they'd be pushing it fucking everywhere.

133
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:05,120
I'm using Snopes because, frankly, it's kind of easy, but PolitiFact does this, the New

134
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:10,400
York Times, frankly, any outlet that says they're officially fact-checking something.

135
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:14,520
The implication is that they're neutral, they're impartial, they can be trusted.

136
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:19,880
They are going to look through what a politician says and tell you, the reader, what the actual

137
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:20,900
truth is.

138
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:22,080
Where did they lie?

139
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:25,580
Where did they just make a mistake or kind of flub their words a little bit?

140
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:27,900
And where are they telling the absolute truth?

141
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:34,380
And there's certainly an air of impartiality to it, of authority, the idea that these are

142
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:35,500
the facts.

143
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:37,880
You can't trust them, but you can trust us.

144
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:42,440
Of course, for that trust to be earned, you have to actually be impartial.

145
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:47,340
You actually have to tell the truth, even when you might not personally agree with it.

146
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:50,140
And the reason I gave you these examples is to show you that it doesn't happen all the

147
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:51,140
time.

148
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:54,280
There is obviously a political bias within these organizations.

149
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:55,900
And here's what's really funny.

150
00:08:55,900 --> 00:09:00,840
When they actually do properly fact-check something, the New York Times properly fact-checking

151
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:08,140
the first 2020 presidential debate, and they realize that no, reality is not simply one-sided,

152
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:13,160
it's not all just orange man bad, people lose their minds.

153
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:19,000
Look at how many people are screaming that the New York Times dare actually fact-check

154
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,200
at least a little impartially.

155
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:27,200
It's not even that great, but it's not all just pure orange man bad propaganda.

156
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,200
And look at them.

157
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,680
Look at how angry they are.

158
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:34,680
It is no surprise to me that these propagandists are telling the big lie.

159
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:36,320
Here's a great example.

160
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:41,880
It has been repeated and repeated and repeated millions of times since Charlottesville that

161
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:48,160
Trump said, specifically in reference to the neo-Nazis at that rally, that you have some

162
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:52,600
very bad people in that group, but you also had people that were very fine people on both

163
00:09:52,600 --> 00:10:01,860
sides.

164
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:06,520
But even though Trump said that clip, and the short, you know, five second clip was

165
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:11,280
circulated around the internet like wildfire, it wasn't actually about the neo-Nazis at

166
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:12,280
the rally.

167
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:16,660
That was about the peaceful protesters on both sides, on the left and the right.

168
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:21,400
Because in the same press conference, Trump said, I'm not talking about the neo-Nazis

169
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:25,980
and the white nationalists, because they should be condemned totally.

170
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:30,740
And you had people, and I'm not talking about the neo-Nazis and the white nationalists,

171
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:32,880
because they should be condemned totally.

172
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:39,080
But you had many people in that group other than neo-Nazis and white nationalists, okay?

173
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:42,380
And the press has treated them absolutely unfairly.

174
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:48,460
Now, in the other group also, you had some fine people, but you also had troublemakers,

175
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:53,980
and you see them come with the black outfits, and with the helmets, and with the baseball

176
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:54,980
bats.

177
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:58,880
You had a lot of bad people in the other group, too.

178
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,700
But is that clip ever remembered?

179
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:03,020
Did that get spread around like wildfire millions of times?

180
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:04,340
No, of course not.

181
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:08,420
When Trump talked about his supporters protesting at the Capitol, is it ever mentioned that

182
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:12,700
he said he wants them to do it peacefully and patriotically?

183
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:14,880
No, of course not.

184
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:18,080
Because if you have a narrative, you can't let the truth get in the way of that.

185
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:22,980
And when you corrupt the fact-checkers, and you use their innate authority as supposed

186
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:27,680
truth-tellers in the service of that narrative, you have basically made it so that people

187
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:30,120
aren't going to trust fact-checking anymore.

188
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,660
And that's a dangerous place to be.

189
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:36,260
This is something I've been thinking about for a while, and it's basically like, there'll

190
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:41,420
be a larger video on it at some point, like something that's really well-written and well-thought-out

191
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:43,300
and well-scripted.

192
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:48,140
It's something like science versus scientism, if that makes sense.

193
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:51,420
I'm not anti-science by any stretch of the imagination.

194
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:56,100
But science tells us what the world is, not what we should do about it.

195
00:11:56,100 --> 00:12:00,900
How many times have you seen somebody try to push a political opinion on you?

196
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:05,340
And they do so by opening with, studies show, research suggests.

197
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:06,340
It's the science.

198
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:07,340
Listen to the experts.

199
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:08,920
All that is scientism.

200
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:11,400
It's not actually a search for truth.

201
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:12,900
It's simply an appeal to authority.

202
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:17,500
And the problem with that, though, is that a lot of science truly is an appeal to authority.

203
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:19,500
Let me explain.

204
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:23,340
Let's say that you have a study, and let's say that that study was published by an accredited

205
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:26,060
university with a good record.

206
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:30,720
And let's say the professor who published it, he is known in his field for being competent.

207
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,940
He's known personally for being honest.

208
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:38,540
There is no reason to suspect that he's simply using his clout to push an ideological agenda.

209
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:40,140
But how can you know?

210
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:46,020
Unless you recreate his study yourself, at some point you simply have to take his word

211
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:47,020
for it.

212
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:52,860
Which is why a lot of the arguments made by the scientismists, for lack of a better term,

213
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:55,080
they're all fundamentally arguments from authority.

214
00:12:55,080 --> 00:13:00,340
When someone says, studies show X is true, what are you doing not believing X?

215
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:02,400
They are not saying that X is true.

216
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:05,840
They are saying that accredited people believe X is true.

217
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:07,740
And what are you doing going against them?

218
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:10,360
This is a fundamental problem with knowledge.

219
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:14,160
Unless you do the study yourself, you can't truly know if it's true.

220
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:18,180
At some point, you have to take that leap of faith where you trust that the institution

221
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:22,400
of the school and the peer review process and the honesty of the professor and everything

222
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:26,320
else comes together to actually create something that approaches the truth.

223
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:30,400
At some point, you have to trust that unless you're going to literally recreate everything

224
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:31,400
yourself.

225
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:35,440
Imagine that you want to build a house and you hire the best construction company in

226
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,440
your area.

227
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:40,480
Their reputation speaks for them, but what is the percentage chance that they will take

228
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:41,480
your money and run?

229
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:43,640
Or they will make a shit house that collapses in six months.

230
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:45,920
Well, it's low, but it's not zero.

231
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,160
And that's kind of the point.

232
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:51,320
Eventually, you simply have to take things at face value and hope they work out.

233
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:54,460
That's part of, I guess, being in a high trust society.

234
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:59,400
But that only works if the people who are doing these jobs, whether it be construction

235
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:05,160
or making these studies or doing these fact checking, if they're actually honest consistently.

236
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:06,860
And we're no longer at that point.

237
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:10,820
This kind of ties into my previous video about grifters where vosh or other socialists say

238
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:13,500
that there's no real truth, there's only power.

239
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:18,840
If you actually believe that, you get a completely non-functioning society because you can no

240
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:21,700
longer trust that people will do the things that they say they're going to do.

241
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:25,560
You can no longer trust that the facts as reported to you are actually the facts.

242
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:30,660
The culture that socialists want to build destroys the capitalist economy, not necessarily

243
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:34,880
because they're opposed to it politically or something, but because capitalism functions

244
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:39,980
when you can basically trust the person that you've never even met before to actually do

245
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:41,740
the job that you hire them to do.

246
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:46,460
And one of the ways the socialist tries to stop capitalism is by making everyone distrust

247
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:47,460
each other.

248
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:52,520
Because to them, it's less about the truth, less about the facts, and more about the morals,

249
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:53,520
more about the ideology.

250
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:55,280
And no, I'm not just talking out of my ass.

251
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:57,480
You can hear that come out of AOC's own mouth if you want.

252
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:58,480
Take a listen.

253
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:01,300
One of the criticisms of you is that your math is fuzzy.

254
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:06,160
The Washington Post recently awarded you four Pinocchios for misstating some statistics

255
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,860
about Pentagon spending.

256
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:14,540
If people want to really blow up one figure here or one word there, I would argue that

257
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:17,260
they're missing the forest for the trees.

258
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:24,740
I think that there's a lot of people more concerned about being precisely factually

259
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:29,740
and semantically correct than about being morally right.

260
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:35,900
This position that AOC and Vosch hold to, and that so many other socialists also spout

261
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:40,800
right now, it is absolutely corrosive to a civil functioning society.

262
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,580
And it is the reason that we're starting to see shit like this.

263
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:44,580
Remember this?

264
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:50,660
When Chinese propaganda used the line, study shows, in order to push their fascist bullshit?

265
00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:51,980
Because of course they would.

266
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:53,020
Why wouldn't they?

267
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:57,900
Why wouldn't every single propagandist that has a narrative they want to shove down everyone's

268
00:15:57,900 --> 00:16:00,100
throat, simply do this from now on?

269
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:02,780
Just claim that a study says their political ideals are true.

270
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:04,740
They can even commission one, why not?

271
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:06,900
Buy off a university and have them do it.

272
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:09,140
Again, I'm not anti-science.

273
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:10,460
Science has its place.

274
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:15,460
It is the only tool we have to figure out what's actually going on around us.

275
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:20,860
It seems to be the height of arrogance that someone would come to you and tell you, this

276
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:22,960
is the objective truth.

277
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:24,900
Only I know what it is.

278
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:31,220
And only I have been empowered by all of these various social institutions to make this claim

279
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:32,580
on reality.

280
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:37,920
And then to say something that is so blatantly, obviously false.

281
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:43,880
There is no way that this isn't a power play by people who do not respect the concept of

282
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:44,880
truth at all.

283
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:48,200
The worst part about this is, I have no real solution.

284
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:49,640
We are now stuck in a bind.

285
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:54,080
We used to be able to trust that the universities actually meant something, but they don't anymore.

286
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:57,280
We used to be able to trust that the journalists would expose the truth, they don't anymore.

287
00:16:57,280 --> 00:17:02,200
We used to be able to believe that fact checkers actually cared about checking the facts, and

288
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:03,200
they don't anymore.

289
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:07,440
And without suitable replacements for those things, we are quite lost at the moment.

290
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:09,360
But it's not completely hopeless.

291
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:15,680
I think if you tell the truth, or at least don't lie, and surround yourself with people

292
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:19,540
doing the same, we can probably muddle through this together.

293
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:23,240
These corrupt systems will not last forever, they will eventually topple under the weight

294
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:24,580
of their own failures.

295
00:17:24,580 --> 00:17:27,200
And it will be a painful process to be sure.

296
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:29,180
It will just take time and effort.

297
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:33,220
And your part in that process is to never compromise your principles.

298
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:38,220
Never say something that you know in your conscience not to be true.

299
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:39,560
Even if it disagrees with me.

300
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:41,900
I'm not saying you should do what I want.

301
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:47,420
I'm saying hold yourself to a standard, and don't give in no matter who comes for you.

302
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:53,740
And I think if we do that enough, we will approach something that is approximately resembling

303
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:54,740
the truth.

304
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:59,940
And despite all of our fallibility, and despite all of our own problems, and despite starting

305
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:05,680
from, in some cases, nothing, that will get us far closer to the truth than anybody who

306
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:08,380
claims they're socialist will ever get.

307
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:10,140
