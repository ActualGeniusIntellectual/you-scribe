00:00.000 --> 00:08.720
So, y'all heard about Drag Queen Story Hour?

00:08.720 --> 00:11.880
No, this video isn't about Drag Queen Story Hour.

00:11.880 --> 00:13.600
I'm sure you guys know the tale at this point.

00:13.600 --> 00:17.920
It was a big deal by some people on the right a year or so ago, I think it might have been

00:17.920 --> 00:21.380
a little bit more than a year, where there were drag queens at libraries telling stories

00:21.380 --> 00:22.380
to kids.

00:22.380 --> 00:25.540
And people on the right were saying that this is, this is degenerate, this is sick, who

00:25.540 --> 00:27.880
knows if these drag queens are pedophiles or not.

00:27.880 --> 00:30.920
People on the left were saying, you're ridiculous, it's harmless.

00:30.920 --> 00:36.360
And then it turned out that Brett Blohm, who is a children's court judge and former president

00:36.360 --> 00:41.720
of Cream City, was arrested a little while ago on charges of child pornography.

00:41.720 --> 00:46.680
As you can see, his LinkedIn shows this to be the case, as does his employment page on

00:46.680 --> 00:48.880
the Cream City Foundation website.

00:48.880 --> 00:51.920
However, Snopes.com has debunked it.

00:51.920 --> 00:56.720
No, Drag Queen Story Hour leader wasn't arrested on child porn charges.

00:56.720 --> 01:02.160
Now Snopes has rated this as false, and the meat of the fact checking article says that

01:02.160 --> 01:09.380
the Cream City Foundation, which is what Blohm was the president and CEO of, is a Milwaukee

01:09.380 --> 01:15.240
based LGBTQ advocacy group that offers grants and scholarships.

01:15.240 --> 01:20.040
The Cream City Foundation was the fiscal sponsor to Drag Queen Story Hour's Milwaukee chapter.

01:20.040 --> 01:24.980
So it turns out that Drag Queen Story Hour Milwaukee has never been run by the Cream

01:24.980 --> 01:29.900
City Foundation or Brett Blohm, and they've never participated in planning, organizing,

01:29.900 --> 01:31.900
hosting, or performing any of the events.

01:31.900 --> 01:34.300
They've only taken donations from them.

01:34.300 --> 01:39.740
Of course, there's also the fact that the same organization actually did have a registered

01:39.740 --> 01:44.540
child sex offender read the kids in drag in a different city.

01:44.540 --> 01:47.500
So I don't blame people for making a few connections here.

01:47.500 --> 01:51.700
If we were to talk about this objectively, you will notice that in terms of this specific

01:51.700 --> 01:56.900
case, there is little in the way of direct evidence, but there is a lot of circumstantial

01:56.900 --> 01:57.900
evidence.

01:57.900 --> 02:03.900
That being said, when Snopes.com rates this officially, puts their stamp on everything

02:03.900 --> 02:06.940
as false, do you believe them?

02:06.940 --> 02:07.940
Should you?

02:07.940 --> 02:13.240
The errors in fact checking sites like Snopes has been an ongoing meme now for a while,

02:13.240 --> 02:14.240
and with good reason.

02:14.240 --> 02:15.340
Let me show you what I mean.

02:15.340 --> 02:17.720
Here's another story that Snopes fact checked.

02:17.720 --> 02:21.800
Has Iowa seen an alarming increase in vanishing children this summer?

02:21.800 --> 02:25.600
Statistics sound much scarier when presented without any context whatsoever.

02:25.600 --> 02:26.600
Oh damn.

02:26.600 --> 02:30.640
The claim is the state of Iowa has seen an alarming increase in vanishing children reports

02:30.640 --> 02:32.560
in the summer of 2018.

02:32.560 --> 02:34.840
They have rated it as mostly false.

02:34.840 --> 02:39.000
What you'll notice is that in fact checking articles where they're trying to obfuscate

02:39.000 --> 02:41.360
something, they will make them extremely long.

02:41.360 --> 02:45.000
Usually these things are quite short if it's just to the point, and then they'll actually

02:45.000 --> 02:47.400
hide the truth in the final paragraph.

02:47.400 --> 02:52.200
While the missing persons numbers presented by Free Thought Project were accurate at the

02:52.200 --> 02:56.600
time of publication, the implication that they were presented an alarming trend or deviation

02:56.600 --> 03:00.680
from normal rates of missing persons was without basis.

03:00.680 --> 03:04.920
So this group that published the numbers, Free Thought Project, they were still correct.

03:04.920 --> 03:08.800
For some reason you got an implication there that may not have actually been in the article,

03:08.800 --> 03:11.520
but the data itself was right.

03:11.520 --> 03:16.460
And if the data itself was right, why do you feel the need to say Rachel Blevins penned

03:16.460 --> 03:20.660
an article for the conspiracy prone site Free Thought Project?

03:20.660 --> 03:22.740
Why say conspiracy prone site?

03:22.740 --> 03:27.020
If it really is fact checking, if it's just the facts, ma'am, why are you adding those

03:27.020 --> 03:28.580
kind of flourishes?

03:28.580 --> 03:32.260
Is the COVID-19 vaccine female sterilization?

03:32.260 --> 03:34.220
This is a big one.

03:34.220 --> 03:35.900
That's completely false apparently.

03:35.900 --> 03:40.900
The story was sourced from a blog called Health and Money News and reference statements made

03:40.900 --> 03:44.180
by Michael Yeddon, who left the company in 2011.

03:44.180 --> 03:49.900
His title there was Vice President and Chief Scientist for Allergy and Respiratory.

03:49.900 --> 03:53.100
So he's somebody who probably knows at least a little bit about this.

03:53.100 --> 03:58.220
Yeddon sent a letter calling on EMA to halt clinical trials of the COVID-19 vaccine in

03:58.220 --> 03:59.220
the EU.

03:59.220 --> 04:03.380
In the letter, he stated that the vaccine blocks a protein that is key in the formation

04:03.380 --> 04:05.340
of the placenta in mammals.

04:05.340 --> 04:09.820
And they claimed it's possible women who received the vaccine could become infertile.

04:09.820 --> 04:14.020
They did not state as fact that the vaccine causes sterility.

04:14.020 --> 04:20.380
The Associated Press reported the vaccine is still considered experimental while final

04:20.380 --> 04:22.200
testing is done.

04:22.200 --> 04:28.300
So we have an instance where it's not clear, like I'm not going to make any kind of grand

04:28.300 --> 04:33.700
proclamations regarding what this vaccine actually does, but we can safely and honestly

04:33.700 --> 04:35.700
say it's not clear.

04:35.700 --> 04:37.200
We don't know yet.

04:37.200 --> 04:40.880
Somebody who is an expert says that infertility might happen.

04:40.880 --> 04:45.600
But on a technical, medical level, infertility is not sterility.

04:45.600 --> 04:48.240
So Snopes found this false.

04:48.240 --> 04:52.700
Did AOC exaggerate the danger she was in during the Capitol riot?

04:52.700 --> 04:58.120
The claim is AOC exaggerated the danger she was in during the riot in that she wasn't

04:58.120 --> 05:02.980
even in the Capitol building where the rioting occurred, and that is in quotes, wasn't even

05:02.980 --> 05:04.400
in the Capitol building.

05:04.400 --> 05:07.640
Again, Snopes rates it mostly false.

05:07.640 --> 05:08.640
What's true?

05:08.640 --> 05:12.540
AOC wasn't in the main Capitol building where the House and Senate chambers are located.

05:12.540 --> 05:18.080
So literally, the main contention that you quoted in the claim is true, and yet this

05:18.080 --> 05:20.000
is mostly false to Snopes.

05:20.000 --> 05:23.860
What's false is that AOC never claimed to be in the main Capitol building, and when

05:23.860 --> 05:27.920
the attack began, she was in her office, which is located in a network of office buildings

05:27.920 --> 05:31.480
immediately surrounding the Capitol, and her office building was one of the two buildings

05:31.480 --> 05:32.720
that were evacuated.

05:32.720 --> 05:38.240
Okay, but the claim was that she wasn't even in the Capitol building, and that was true.

05:38.240 --> 05:43.520
Did a convicted terrorist sit on the board of a Black Lives Matter funding body?

05:43.520 --> 05:47.600
The past crimes of Susan Rosenberg reemerged in the summer of 2020.

05:47.600 --> 05:52.300
The claim is that Rosenberg is a convicted terrorist who sits on the board of the Directors

05:52.300 --> 05:57.520
of Thousand Currents, an organization which handles fundraising for the BLM global network.

05:57.520 --> 06:00.280
Snopes rated this as a mixture.

06:00.280 --> 06:01.400
So what's true?

06:01.400 --> 06:06.280
Rosenberg has served as vice chair of the board of directors for Thousand Currents,

06:06.280 --> 06:11.880
and she was an active member of revolutionary left-wing movements whose illegal activities

06:11.880 --> 06:16.400
included bombing US government buildings and committing armed robberies.

06:16.400 --> 06:18.000
What's undetermined?

06:18.000 --> 06:24.560
In the absence of a single, universally agreed definition of terrorism, it is a matter of

06:24.560 --> 06:29.840
subjective determination as to whether the actions for which Rosenberg was convicted

06:29.840 --> 06:34.600
and imprisoned, possession of weapons, and hundreds of pounds of explosives should be

06:34.600 --> 06:37.320
described as acts of domestic terrorism.

06:37.320 --> 06:42.640
There is no way that any reasonable person would not look at this and see Snopes trying

06:42.640 --> 06:46.080
to cover something up, playing ball for their team.

06:46.080 --> 06:51.920
If it were the inverse, if it were, say, the guy who rammed his car into a crowd, and I

06:51.920 --> 06:56.080
think that was Charlottesville, if it were that guy who gets invited to sit on like a

06:56.080 --> 07:01.580
right-wing board 10 years or 20 years later, Snopes would be writing these fact-checking

07:01.580 --> 07:07.600
articles saying, it's true, he's a terrorist, 100%, and people would be up in fucking arms

07:07.600 --> 07:08.600
about it.

07:08.600 --> 07:09.600
And you know what?

07:09.600 --> 07:10.600
Rightfully so.

07:10.600 --> 07:16.600
This is a person who went to jail on terrorism charges, but because it's left-wing terrorism,

07:16.600 --> 07:18.340
Snopes goes to bat for them.

07:18.340 --> 07:24.580
Did US presidential candidate Joe Biden say he had no empathy for the plight of younger

07:24.580 --> 07:25.580
people?

07:25.580 --> 07:26.580
Hmm.

07:26.580 --> 07:27.760
Oh, look, it's mixed.

07:27.760 --> 07:28.760
What's true?

07:28.760 --> 07:34.200
In 2018, Biden did say he had no empathy for the plight of younger people.

07:34.200 --> 07:36.200
What the fuck else do you need?

07:36.200 --> 07:37.360
What's false?

07:37.360 --> 07:42.800
Biden was making a specific and emphatic comparison between the relative progress and civility

07:42.800 --> 07:47.280
of the present moment on one hand, and the upheaval and civil discord of his own youth

07:47.280 --> 07:49.180
in the late 1960s.

07:49.180 --> 07:52.400
He was not speaking in general or absolute terms.

07:52.400 --> 07:57.280
If you switch this around, again, if this were Trump saying something, they'd be hitting

07:57.280 --> 08:00.320
it with true, and they'd be pushing it fucking everywhere.

08:00.320 --> 08:05.120
I'm using Snopes because, frankly, it's kind of easy, but PolitiFact does this, the New

08:05.120 --> 08:10.400
York Times, frankly, any outlet that says they're officially fact-checking something.

08:10.400 --> 08:14.520
The implication is that they're neutral, they're impartial, they can be trusted.

08:14.520 --> 08:19.880
They are going to look through what a politician says and tell you, the reader, what the actual

08:19.880 --> 08:20.900
truth is.

08:20.900 --> 08:22.080
Where did they lie?

08:22.080 --> 08:25.580
Where did they just make a mistake or kind of flub their words a little bit?

08:25.580 --> 08:27.900
And where are they telling the absolute truth?

08:27.900 --> 08:34.380
And there's certainly an air of impartiality to it, of authority, the idea that these are

08:34.380 --> 08:35.500
the facts.

08:35.500 --> 08:37.880
You can't trust them, but you can trust us.

08:37.880 --> 08:42.440
Of course, for that trust to be earned, you have to actually be impartial.

08:42.440 --> 08:47.340
You actually have to tell the truth, even when you might not personally agree with it.

08:47.340 --> 08:50.140
And the reason I gave you these examples is to show you that it doesn't happen all the

08:50.140 --> 08:51.140
time.

08:51.140 --> 08:54.280
There is obviously a political bias within these organizations.

08:54.280 --> 08:55.900
And here's what's really funny.

08:55.900 --> 09:00.840
When they actually do properly fact-check something, the New York Times properly fact-checking

09:00.840 --> 09:08.140
the first 2020 presidential debate, and they realize that no, reality is not simply one-sided,

09:08.140 --> 09:13.160
it's not all just orange man bad, people lose their minds.

09:13.160 --> 09:19.000
Look at how many people are screaming that the New York Times dare actually fact-check

09:19.000 --> 09:21.200
at least a little impartially.

09:21.200 --> 09:27.200
It's not even that great, but it's not all just pure orange man bad propaganda.

09:27.200 --> 09:28.200
And look at them.

09:28.200 --> 09:29.680
Look at how angry they are.

09:29.680 --> 09:34.680
It is no surprise to me that these propagandists are telling the big lie.

09:34.680 --> 09:36.320
Here's a great example.

09:36.320 --> 09:41.880
It has been repeated and repeated and repeated millions of times since Charlottesville that

09:41.880 --> 09:48.160
Trump said, specifically in reference to the neo-Nazis at that rally, that you have some

09:48.160 --> 09:52.600
very bad people in that group, but you also had people that were very fine people on both

09:52.600 --> 10:01.860
sides.

10:01.860 --> 10:06.520
But even though Trump said that clip, and the short, you know, five second clip was

10:06.520 --> 10:11.280
circulated around the internet like wildfire, it wasn't actually about the neo-Nazis at

10:11.280 --> 10:12.280
the rally.

10:12.280 --> 10:16.660
That was about the peaceful protesters on both sides, on the left and the right.

10:16.660 --> 10:21.400
Because in the same press conference, Trump said, I'm not talking about the neo-Nazis

10:21.400 --> 10:25.980
and the white nationalists, because they should be condemned totally.

10:25.980 --> 10:30.740
And you had people, and I'm not talking about the neo-Nazis and the white nationalists,

10:30.740 --> 10:32.880
because they should be condemned totally.

10:32.880 --> 10:39.080
But you had many people in that group other than neo-Nazis and white nationalists, okay?

10:39.080 --> 10:42.380
And the press has treated them absolutely unfairly.

10:42.380 --> 10:48.460
Now, in the other group also, you had some fine people, but you also had troublemakers,

10:48.460 --> 10:53.980
and you see them come with the black outfits, and with the helmets, and with the baseball

10:53.980 --> 10:54.980
bats.

10:54.980 --> 10:58.880
You had a lot of bad people in the other group, too.

10:58.880 --> 11:00.700
But is that clip ever remembered?

11:00.700 --> 11:03.020
Did that get spread around like wildfire millions of times?

11:03.020 --> 11:04.340
No, of course not.

11:04.340 --> 11:08.420
When Trump talked about his supporters protesting at the Capitol, is it ever mentioned that

11:08.420 --> 11:12.700
he said he wants them to do it peacefully and patriotically?

11:12.700 --> 11:14.880
No, of course not.

11:14.880 --> 11:18.080
Because if you have a narrative, you can't let the truth get in the way of that.

11:18.080 --> 11:22.980
And when you corrupt the fact-checkers, and you use their innate authority as supposed

11:22.980 --> 11:27.680
truth-tellers in the service of that narrative, you have basically made it so that people

11:27.680 --> 11:30.120
aren't going to trust fact-checking anymore.

11:30.120 --> 11:31.660
And that's a dangerous place to be.

11:31.660 --> 11:36.260
This is something I've been thinking about for a while, and it's basically like, there'll

11:36.260 --> 11:41.420
be a larger video on it at some point, like something that's really well-written and well-thought-out

11:41.420 --> 11:43.300
and well-scripted.

11:43.300 --> 11:48.140
It's something like science versus scientism, if that makes sense.

11:48.140 --> 11:51.420
I'm not anti-science by any stretch of the imagination.

11:51.420 --> 11:56.100
But science tells us what the world is, not what we should do about it.

11:56.100 --> 12:00.900
How many times have you seen somebody try to push a political opinion on you?

12:00.900 --> 12:05.340
And they do so by opening with, studies show, research suggests.

12:05.340 --> 12:06.340
It's the science.

12:06.340 --> 12:07.340
Listen to the experts.

12:07.340 --> 12:08.920
All that is scientism.

12:08.920 --> 12:11.400
It's not actually a search for truth.

12:11.400 --> 12:12.900
It's simply an appeal to authority.

12:12.900 --> 12:17.500
And the problem with that, though, is that a lot of science truly is an appeal to authority.

12:17.500 --> 12:19.500
Let me explain.

12:19.500 --> 12:23.340
Let's say that you have a study, and let's say that that study was published by an accredited

12:23.340 --> 12:26.060
university with a good record.

12:26.060 --> 12:30.720
And let's say the professor who published it, he is known in his field for being competent.

12:30.720 --> 12:32.940
He's known personally for being honest.

12:32.940 --> 12:38.540
There is no reason to suspect that he's simply using his clout to push an ideological agenda.

12:38.540 --> 12:40.140
But how can you know?

12:40.140 --> 12:46.020
Unless you recreate his study yourself, at some point you simply have to take his word

12:46.020 --> 12:47.020
for it.

12:47.020 --> 12:52.860
Which is why a lot of the arguments made by the scientismists, for lack of a better term,

12:52.860 --> 12:55.080
they're all fundamentally arguments from authority.

12:55.080 --> 13:00.340
When someone says, studies show X is true, what are you doing not believing X?

13:00.340 --> 13:02.400
They are not saying that X is true.

13:02.400 --> 13:05.840
They are saying that accredited people believe X is true.

13:05.840 --> 13:07.740
And what are you doing going against them?

13:07.740 --> 13:10.360
This is a fundamental problem with knowledge.

13:10.360 --> 13:14.160
Unless you do the study yourself, you can't truly know if it's true.

13:14.160 --> 13:18.180
At some point, you have to take that leap of faith where you trust that the institution

13:18.180 --> 13:22.400
of the school and the peer review process and the honesty of the professor and everything

13:22.400 --> 13:26.320
else comes together to actually create something that approaches the truth.

13:26.320 --> 13:30.400
At some point, you have to trust that unless you're going to literally recreate everything

13:30.400 --> 13:31.400
yourself.

13:31.400 --> 13:35.440
Imagine that you want to build a house and you hire the best construction company in

13:35.440 --> 13:36.440
your area.

13:36.440 --> 13:40.480
Their reputation speaks for them, but what is the percentage chance that they will take

13:40.480 --> 13:41.480
your money and run?

13:41.480 --> 13:43.640
Or they will make a shit house that collapses in six months.

13:43.640 --> 13:45.920
Well, it's low, but it's not zero.

13:45.920 --> 13:47.160
And that's kind of the point.

13:47.160 --> 13:51.320
Eventually, you simply have to take things at face value and hope they work out.

13:51.320 --> 13:54.460
That's part of, I guess, being in a high trust society.

13:54.460 --> 13:59.400
But that only works if the people who are doing these jobs, whether it be construction

13:59.400 --> 14:05.160
or making these studies or doing these fact checking, if they're actually honest consistently.

14:05.160 --> 14:06.860
And we're no longer at that point.

14:06.860 --> 14:10.820
This kind of ties into my previous video about grifters where vosh or other socialists say

14:10.820 --> 14:13.500
that there's no real truth, there's only power.

14:13.500 --> 14:18.840
If you actually believe that, you get a completely non-functioning society because you can no

14:18.840 --> 14:21.700
longer trust that people will do the things that they say they're going to do.

14:21.700 --> 14:25.560
You can no longer trust that the facts as reported to you are actually the facts.

14:25.560 --> 14:30.660
The culture that socialists want to build destroys the capitalist economy, not necessarily

14:30.660 --> 14:34.880
because they're opposed to it politically or something, but because capitalism functions

14:34.880 --> 14:39.980
when you can basically trust the person that you've never even met before to actually do

14:39.980 --> 14:41.740
the job that you hire them to do.

14:41.740 --> 14:46.460
And one of the ways the socialist tries to stop capitalism is by making everyone distrust

14:46.460 --> 14:47.460
each other.

14:47.460 --> 14:52.520
Because to them, it's less about the truth, less about the facts, and more about the morals,

14:52.520 --> 14:53.520
more about the ideology.

14:53.520 --> 14:55.280
And no, I'm not just talking out of my ass.

14:55.280 --> 14:57.480
You can hear that come out of AOC's own mouth if you want.

14:57.480 --> 14:58.480
Take a listen.

14:58.480 --> 15:01.300
One of the criticisms of you is that your math is fuzzy.

15:01.300 --> 15:06.160
The Washington Post recently awarded you four Pinocchios for misstating some statistics

15:06.160 --> 15:07.860
about Pentagon spending.

15:07.860 --> 15:14.540
If people want to really blow up one figure here or one word there, I would argue that

15:14.540 --> 15:17.260
they're missing the forest for the trees.

15:17.260 --> 15:24.740
I think that there's a lot of people more concerned about being precisely factually

15:24.740 --> 15:29.740
and semantically correct than about being morally right.

15:29.740 --> 15:35.900
This position that AOC and Vosch hold to, and that so many other socialists also spout

15:35.900 --> 15:40.800
right now, it is absolutely corrosive to a civil functioning society.

15:40.800 --> 15:43.580
And it is the reason that we're starting to see shit like this.

15:43.580 --> 15:44.580
Remember this?

15:44.580 --> 15:50.660
When Chinese propaganda used the line, study shows, in order to push their fascist bullshit?

15:50.660 --> 15:51.980
Because of course they would.

15:51.980 --> 15:53.020
Why wouldn't they?

15:53.020 --> 15:57.900
Why wouldn't every single propagandist that has a narrative they want to shove down everyone's

15:57.900 --> 16:00.100
throat, simply do this from now on?

16:00.100 --> 16:02.780
Just claim that a study says their political ideals are true.

16:02.780 --> 16:04.740
They can even commission one, why not?

16:04.740 --> 16:06.900
Buy off a university and have them do it.

16:06.900 --> 16:09.140
Again, I'm not anti-science.

16:09.140 --> 16:10.460
Science has its place.

16:10.460 --> 16:15.460
It is the only tool we have to figure out what's actually going on around us.

16:15.460 --> 16:20.860
It seems to be the height of arrogance that someone would come to you and tell you, this

16:20.860 --> 16:22.960
is the objective truth.

16:22.960 --> 16:24.900
Only I know what it is.

16:24.900 --> 16:31.220
And only I have been empowered by all of these various social institutions to make this claim

16:31.220 --> 16:32.580
on reality.

16:32.580 --> 16:37.920
And then to say something that is so blatantly, obviously false.

16:37.920 --> 16:43.880
There is no way that this isn't a power play by people who do not respect the concept of

16:43.880 --> 16:44.880
truth at all.

16:44.880 --> 16:48.200
The worst part about this is, I have no real solution.

16:48.200 --> 16:49.640
We are now stuck in a bind.

16:49.640 --> 16:54.080
We used to be able to trust that the universities actually meant something, but they don't anymore.

16:54.080 --> 16:57.280
We used to be able to trust that the journalists would expose the truth, they don't anymore.

16:57.280 --> 17:02.200
We used to be able to believe that fact checkers actually cared about checking the facts, and

17:02.200 --> 17:03.200
they don't anymore.

17:03.200 --> 17:07.440
And without suitable replacements for those things, we are quite lost at the moment.

17:07.440 --> 17:09.360
But it's not completely hopeless.

17:09.360 --> 17:15.680
I think if you tell the truth, or at least don't lie, and surround yourself with people

17:15.680 --> 17:19.540
doing the same, we can probably muddle through this together.

17:19.540 --> 17:23.240
These corrupt systems will not last forever, they will eventually topple under the weight

17:23.240 --> 17:24.580
of their own failures.

17:24.580 --> 17:27.200
And it will be a painful process to be sure.

17:27.200 --> 17:29.180
It will just take time and effort.

17:29.180 --> 17:33.220
And your part in that process is to never compromise your principles.

17:33.220 --> 17:38.220
Never say something that you know in your conscience not to be true.

17:38.220 --> 17:39.560
Even if it disagrees with me.

17:39.560 --> 17:41.900
I'm not saying you should do what I want.

17:41.900 --> 17:47.420
I'm saying hold yourself to a standard, and don't give in no matter who comes for you.

17:47.420 --> 17:53.740
And I think if we do that enough, we will approach something that is approximately resembling

17:53.740 --> 17:54.740
the truth.

17:54.740 --> 17:59.940
And despite all of our fallibility, and despite all of our own problems, and despite starting

17:59.940 --> 18:05.680
from, in some cases, nothing, that will get us far closer to the truth than anybody who

18:05.680 --> 18:08.380
claims they're socialist will ever get.

18:08.380 --> 18:10.140
