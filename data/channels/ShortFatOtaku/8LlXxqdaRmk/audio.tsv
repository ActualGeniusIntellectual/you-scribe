0	8720	So, y'all heard about Drag Queen Story Hour?
8720	11880	No, this video isn't about Drag Queen Story Hour.
11880	13600	I'm sure you guys know the tale at this point.
13600	17920	It was a big deal by some people on the right a year or so ago, I think it might have been
17920	21380	a little bit more than a year, where there were drag queens at libraries telling stories
21380	22380	to kids.
22380	25540	And people on the right were saying that this is, this is degenerate, this is sick, who
25540	27880	knows if these drag queens are pedophiles or not.
27880	30920	People on the left were saying, you're ridiculous, it's harmless.
30920	36360	And then it turned out that Brett Blohm, who is a children's court judge and former president
36360	41720	of Cream City, was arrested a little while ago on charges of child pornography.
41720	46680	As you can see, his LinkedIn shows this to be the case, as does his employment page on
46680	48880	the Cream City Foundation website.
48880	51920	However, Snopes.com has debunked it.
51920	56720	No, Drag Queen Story Hour leader wasn't arrested on child porn charges.
56720	62160	Now Snopes has rated this as false, and the meat of the fact checking article says that
62160	69380	the Cream City Foundation, which is what Blohm was the president and CEO of, is a Milwaukee
69380	75240	based LGBTQ advocacy group that offers grants and scholarships.
75240	80040	The Cream City Foundation was the fiscal sponsor to Drag Queen Story Hour's Milwaukee chapter.
80040	84980	So it turns out that Drag Queen Story Hour Milwaukee has never been run by the Cream
84980	89900	City Foundation or Brett Blohm, and they've never participated in planning, organizing,
89900	91900	hosting, or performing any of the events.
91900	94300	They've only taken donations from them.
94300	99740	Of course, there's also the fact that the same organization actually did have a registered
99740	104540	child sex offender read the kids in drag in a different city.
104540	107500	So I don't blame people for making a few connections here.
107500	111700	If we were to talk about this objectively, you will notice that in terms of this specific
111700	116900	case, there is little in the way of direct evidence, but there is a lot of circumstantial
116900	117900	evidence.
117900	123900	That being said, when Snopes.com rates this officially, puts their stamp on everything
123900	126940	as false, do you believe them?
126940	127940	Should you?
127940	133240	The errors in fact checking sites like Snopes has been an ongoing meme now for a while,
133240	134240	and with good reason.
134240	135340	Let me show you what I mean.
135340	137720	Here's another story that Snopes fact checked.
137720	141800	Has Iowa seen an alarming increase in vanishing children this summer?
141800	145600	Statistics sound much scarier when presented without any context whatsoever.
145600	146600	Oh damn.
146600	150640	The claim is the state of Iowa has seen an alarming increase in vanishing children reports
150640	152560	in the summer of 2018.
152560	154840	They have rated it as mostly false.
154840	159000	What you'll notice is that in fact checking articles where they're trying to obfuscate
159000	161360	something, they will make them extremely long.
161360	165000	Usually these things are quite short if it's just to the point, and then they'll actually
165000	167400	hide the truth in the final paragraph.
167400	172200	While the missing persons numbers presented by Free Thought Project were accurate at the
172200	176600	time of publication, the implication that they were presented an alarming trend or deviation
176600	180680	from normal rates of missing persons was without basis.
180680	184920	So this group that published the numbers, Free Thought Project, they were still correct.
184920	188800	For some reason you got an implication there that may not have actually been in the article,
188800	191520	but the data itself was right.
191520	196460	And if the data itself was right, why do you feel the need to say Rachel Blevins penned
196460	200660	an article for the conspiracy prone site Free Thought Project?
200660	202740	Why say conspiracy prone site?
202740	207020	If it really is fact checking, if it's just the facts, ma'am, why are you adding those
207020	208580	kind of flourishes?
208580	212260	Is the COVID-19 vaccine female sterilization?
212260	214220	This is a big one.
214220	215900	That's completely false apparently.
215900	220900	The story was sourced from a blog called Health and Money News and reference statements made
220900	224180	by Michael Yeddon, who left the company in 2011.
224180	229900	His title there was Vice President and Chief Scientist for Allergy and Respiratory.
229900	233100	So he's somebody who probably knows at least a little bit about this.
233100	238220	Yeddon sent a letter calling on EMA to halt clinical trials of the COVID-19 vaccine in
238220	239220	the EU.
239220	243380	In the letter, he stated that the vaccine blocks a protein that is key in the formation
243380	245340	of the placenta in mammals.
245340	249820	And they claimed it's possible women who received the vaccine could become infertile.
249820	254020	They did not state as fact that the vaccine causes sterility.
254020	260380	The Associated Press reported the vaccine is still considered experimental while final
260380	262200	testing is done.
262200	268300	So we have an instance where it's not clear, like I'm not going to make any kind of grand
268300	273700	proclamations regarding what this vaccine actually does, but we can safely and honestly
273700	275700	say it's not clear.
275700	277200	We don't know yet.
277200	280880	Somebody who is an expert says that infertility might happen.
280880	285600	But on a technical, medical level, infertility is not sterility.
285600	288240	So Snopes found this false.
288240	292700	Did AOC exaggerate the danger she was in during the Capitol riot?
292700	298120	The claim is AOC exaggerated the danger she was in during the riot in that she wasn't
298120	302980	even in the Capitol building where the rioting occurred, and that is in quotes, wasn't even
302980	304400	in the Capitol building.
304400	307640	Again, Snopes rates it mostly false.
307640	308640	What's true?
308640	312540	AOC wasn't in the main Capitol building where the House and Senate chambers are located.
312540	318080	So literally, the main contention that you quoted in the claim is true, and yet this
318080	320000	is mostly false to Snopes.
320000	323860	What's false is that AOC never claimed to be in the main Capitol building, and when
323860	327920	the attack began, she was in her office, which is located in a network of office buildings
327920	331480	immediately surrounding the Capitol, and her office building was one of the two buildings
331480	332720	that were evacuated.
332720	338240	Okay, but the claim was that she wasn't even in the Capitol building, and that was true.
338240	343520	Did a convicted terrorist sit on the board of a Black Lives Matter funding body?
343520	347600	The past crimes of Susan Rosenberg reemerged in the summer of 2020.
347600	352300	The claim is that Rosenberg is a convicted terrorist who sits on the board of the Directors
352300	357520	of Thousand Currents, an organization which handles fundraising for the BLM global network.
357520	360280	Snopes rated this as a mixture.
360280	361400	So what's true?
361400	366280	Rosenberg has served as vice chair of the board of directors for Thousand Currents,
366280	371880	and she was an active member of revolutionary left-wing movements whose illegal activities
371880	376400	included bombing US government buildings and committing armed robberies.
376400	378000	What's undetermined?
378000	384560	In the absence of a single, universally agreed definition of terrorism, it is a matter of
384560	389840	subjective determination as to whether the actions for which Rosenberg was convicted
389840	394600	and imprisoned, possession of weapons, and hundreds of pounds of explosives should be
394600	397320	described as acts of domestic terrorism.
397320	402640	There is no way that any reasonable person would not look at this and see Snopes trying
402640	406080	to cover something up, playing ball for their team.
406080	411920	If it were the inverse, if it were, say, the guy who rammed his car into a crowd, and I
411920	416080	think that was Charlottesville, if it were that guy who gets invited to sit on like a
416080	421580	right-wing board 10 years or 20 years later, Snopes would be writing these fact-checking
421580	427600	articles saying, it's true, he's a terrorist, 100%, and people would be up in fucking arms
427600	428600	about it.
428600	429600	And you know what?
429600	430600	Rightfully so.
430600	436600	This is a person who went to jail on terrorism charges, but because it's left-wing terrorism,
436600	438340	Snopes goes to bat for them.
438340	444580	Did US presidential candidate Joe Biden say he had no empathy for the plight of younger
444580	445580	people?
445580	446580	Hmm.
446580	447760	Oh, look, it's mixed.
447760	448760	What's true?
448760	454200	In 2018, Biden did say he had no empathy for the plight of younger people.
454200	456200	What the fuck else do you need?
456200	457360	What's false?
457360	462800	Biden was making a specific and emphatic comparison between the relative progress and civility
462800	467280	of the present moment on one hand, and the upheaval and civil discord of his own youth
467280	469180	in the late 1960s.
469180	472400	He was not speaking in general or absolute terms.
472400	477280	If you switch this around, again, if this were Trump saying something, they'd be hitting
477280	480320	it with true, and they'd be pushing it fucking everywhere.
480320	485120	I'm using Snopes because, frankly, it's kind of easy, but PolitiFact does this, the New
485120	490400	York Times, frankly, any outlet that says they're officially fact-checking something.
490400	494520	The implication is that they're neutral, they're impartial, they can be trusted.
494520	499880	They are going to look through what a politician says and tell you, the reader, what the actual
499880	500900	truth is.
500900	502080	Where did they lie?
502080	505580	Where did they just make a mistake or kind of flub their words a little bit?
505580	507900	And where are they telling the absolute truth?
507900	514380	And there's certainly an air of impartiality to it, of authority, the idea that these are
514380	515500	the facts.
515500	517880	You can't trust them, but you can trust us.
517880	522440	Of course, for that trust to be earned, you have to actually be impartial.
522440	527340	You actually have to tell the truth, even when you might not personally agree with it.
527340	530140	And the reason I gave you these examples is to show you that it doesn't happen all the
530140	531140	time.
531140	534280	There is obviously a political bias within these organizations.
534280	535900	And here's what's really funny.
535900	540840	When they actually do properly fact-check something, the New York Times properly fact-checking
540840	548140	the first 2020 presidential debate, and they realize that no, reality is not simply one-sided,
548140	553160	it's not all just orange man bad, people lose their minds.
553160	559000	Look at how many people are screaming that the New York Times dare actually fact-check
559000	561200	at least a little impartially.
561200	567200	It's not even that great, but it's not all just pure orange man bad propaganda.
567200	568200	And look at them.
568200	569680	Look at how angry they are.
569680	574680	It is no surprise to me that these propagandists are telling the big lie.
574680	576320	Here's a great example.
576320	581880	It has been repeated and repeated and repeated millions of times since Charlottesville that
581880	588160	Trump said, specifically in reference to the neo-Nazis at that rally, that you have some
588160	592600	very bad people in that group, but you also had people that were very fine people on both
592600	601860	sides.
601860	606520	But even though Trump said that clip, and the short, you know, five second clip was
606520	611280	circulated around the internet like wildfire, it wasn't actually about the neo-Nazis at
611280	612280	the rally.
612280	616660	That was about the peaceful protesters on both sides, on the left and the right.
616660	621400	Because in the same press conference, Trump said, I'm not talking about the neo-Nazis
621400	625980	and the white nationalists, because they should be condemned totally.
625980	630740	And you had people, and I'm not talking about the neo-Nazis and the white nationalists,
630740	632880	because they should be condemned totally.
632880	639080	But you had many people in that group other than neo-Nazis and white nationalists, okay?
639080	642380	And the press has treated them absolutely unfairly.
642380	648460	Now, in the other group also, you had some fine people, but you also had troublemakers,
648460	653980	and you see them come with the black outfits, and with the helmets, and with the baseball
653980	654980	bats.
654980	658880	You had a lot of bad people in the other group, too.
658880	660700	But is that clip ever remembered?
660700	663020	Did that get spread around like wildfire millions of times?
663020	664340	No, of course not.
664340	668420	When Trump talked about his supporters protesting at the Capitol, is it ever mentioned that
668420	672700	he said he wants them to do it peacefully and patriotically?
672700	674880	No, of course not.
674880	678080	Because if you have a narrative, you can't let the truth get in the way of that.
678080	682980	And when you corrupt the fact-checkers, and you use their innate authority as supposed
682980	687680	truth-tellers in the service of that narrative, you have basically made it so that people
687680	690120	aren't going to trust fact-checking anymore.
690120	691660	And that's a dangerous place to be.
691660	696260	This is something I've been thinking about for a while, and it's basically like, there'll
696260	701420	be a larger video on it at some point, like something that's really well-written and well-thought-out
701420	703300	and well-scripted.
703300	708140	It's something like science versus scientism, if that makes sense.
708140	711420	I'm not anti-science by any stretch of the imagination.
711420	716100	But science tells us what the world is, not what we should do about it.
716100	720900	How many times have you seen somebody try to push a political opinion on you?
720900	725340	And they do so by opening with, studies show, research suggests.
725340	726340	It's the science.
726340	727340	Listen to the experts.
727340	728920	All that is scientism.
728920	731400	It's not actually a search for truth.
731400	732900	It's simply an appeal to authority.
732900	737500	And the problem with that, though, is that a lot of science truly is an appeal to authority.
737500	739500	Let me explain.
739500	743340	Let's say that you have a study, and let's say that that study was published by an accredited
743340	746060	university with a good record.
746060	750720	And let's say the professor who published it, he is known in his field for being competent.
750720	752940	He's known personally for being honest.
752940	758540	There is no reason to suspect that he's simply using his clout to push an ideological agenda.
758540	760140	But how can you know?
760140	766020	Unless you recreate his study yourself, at some point you simply have to take his word
766020	767020	for it.
767020	772860	Which is why a lot of the arguments made by the scientismists, for lack of a better term,
772860	775080	they're all fundamentally arguments from authority.
775080	780340	When someone says, studies show X is true, what are you doing not believing X?
780340	782400	They are not saying that X is true.
782400	785840	They are saying that accredited people believe X is true.
785840	787740	And what are you doing going against them?
787740	790360	This is a fundamental problem with knowledge.
790360	794160	Unless you do the study yourself, you can't truly know if it's true.
794160	798180	At some point, you have to take that leap of faith where you trust that the institution
798180	802400	of the school and the peer review process and the honesty of the professor and everything
802400	806320	else comes together to actually create something that approaches the truth.
806320	810400	At some point, you have to trust that unless you're going to literally recreate everything
810400	811400	yourself.
811400	815440	Imagine that you want to build a house and you hire the best construction company in
815440	816440	your area.
816440	820480	Their reputation speaks for them, but what is the percentage chance that they will take
820480	821480	your money and run?
821480	823640	Or they will make a shit house that collapses in six months.
823640	825920	Well, it's low, but it's not zero.
825920	827160	And that's kind of the point.
827160	831320	Eventually, you simply have to take things at face value and hope they work out.
831320	834460	That's part of, I guess, being in a high trust society.
834460	839400	But that only works if the people who are doing these jobs, whether it be construction
839400	845160	or making these studies or doing these fact checking, if they're actually honest consistently.
845160	846860	And we're no longer at that point.
846860	850820	This kind of ties into my previous video about grifters where vosh or other socialists say
850820	853500	that there's no real truth, there's only power.
853500	858840	If you actually believe that, you get a completely non-functioning society because you can no
858840	861700	longer trust that people will do the things that they say they're going to do.
861700	865560	You can no longer trust that the facts as reported to you are actually the facts.
865560	870660	The culture that socialists want to build destroys the capitalist economy, not necessarily
870660	874880	because they're opposed to it politically or something, but because capitalism functions
874880	879980	when you can basically trust the person that you've never even met before to actually do
879980	881740	the job that you hire them to do.
881740	886460	And one of the ways the socialist tries to stop capitalism is by making everyone distrust
886460	887460	each other.
887460	892520	Because to them, it's less about the truth, less about the facts, and more about the morals,
892520	893520	more about the ideology.
893520	895280	And no, I'm not just talking out of my ass.
895280	897480	You can hear that come out of AOC's own mouth if you want.
897480	898480	Take a listen.
898480	901300	One of the criticisms of you is that your math is fuzzy.
901300	906160	The Washington Post recently awarded you four Pinocchios for misstating some statistics
906160	907860	about Pentagon spending.
907860	914540	If people want to really blow up one figure here or one word there, I would argue that
914540	917260	they're missing the forest for the trees.
917260	924740	I think that there's a lot of people more concerned about being precisely factually
924740	929740	and semantically correct than about being morally right.
929740	935900	This position that AOC and Vosch hold to, and that so many other socialists also spout
935900	940800	right now, it is absolutely corrosive to a civil functioning society.
940800	943580	And it is the reason that we're starting to see shit like this.
943580	944580	Remember this?
944580	950660	When Chinese propaganda used the line, study shows, in order to push their fascist bullshit?
950660	951980	Because of course they would.
951980	953020	Why wouldn't they?
953020	957900	Why wouldn't every single propagandist that has a narrative they want to shove down everyone's
957900	960100	throat, simply do this from now on?
960100	962780	Just claim that a study says their political ideals are true.
962780	964740	They can even commission one, why not?
964740	966900	Buy off a university and have them do it.
966900	969140	Again, I'm not anti-science.
969140	970460	Science has its place.
970460	975460	It is the only tool we have to figure out what's actually going on around us.
975460	980860	It seems to be the height of arrogance that someone would come to you and tell you, this
980860	982960	is the objective truth.
982960	984900	Only I know what it is.
984900	991220	And only I have been empowered by all of these various social institutions to make this claim
991220	992580	on reality.
992580	997920	And then to say something that is so blatantly, obviously false.
997920	1003880	There is no way that this isn't a power play by people who do not respect the concept of
1003880	1004880	truth at all.
1004880	1008200	The worst part about this is, I have no real solution.
1008200	1009640	We are now stuck in a bind.
1009640	1014080	We used to be able to trust that the universities actually meant something, but they don't anymore.
1014080	1017280	We used to be able to trust that the journalists would expose the truth, they don't anymore.
1017280	1022200	We used to be able to believe that fact checkers actually cared about checking the facts, and
1022200	1023200	they don't anymore.
1023200	1027440	And without suitable replacements for those things, we are quite lost at the moment.
1027440	1029360	But it's not completely hopeless.
1029360	1035680	I think if you tell the truth, or at least don't lie, and surround yourself with people
1035680	1039540	doing the same, we can probably muddle through this together.
1039540	1043240	These corrupt systems will not last forever, they will eventually topple under the weight
1043240	1044580	of their own failures.
1044580	1047200	And it will be a painful process to be sure.
1047200	1049180	It will just take time and effort.
1049180	1053220	And your part in that process is to never compromise your principles.
1053220	1058220	Never say something that you know in your conscience not to be true.
1058220	1059560	Even if it disagrees with me.
1059560	1061900	I'm not saying you should do what I want.
1061900	1067420	I'm saying hold yourself to a standard, and don't give in no matter who comes for you.
1067420	1073740	And I think if we do that enough, we will approach something that is approximately resembling
1073740	1074740	the truth.
1074740	1079940	And despite all of our fallibility, and despite all of our own problems, and despite starting
1079940	1085680	from, in some cases, nothing, that will get us far closer to the truth than anybody who
1085680	1088380	claims they're socialist will ever get.
