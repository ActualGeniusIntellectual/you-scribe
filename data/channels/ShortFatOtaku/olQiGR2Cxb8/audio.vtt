00:00.000 --> 00:05.760
Hey everyone, welcome to SJ Weekly for January 6th, 2019.

00:05.760 --> 00:07.920
Today I'm not having a caffeinated drink at all.

00:07.920 --> 00:12.520
It's actually a smoothie, because I'm trying to lose weight and get healthy.

00:12.520 --> 00:19.120
So in this smoothie I have protein powder, flax seed, bananas, avocado, blueberries,

00:19.120 --> 00:21.520
kale, and some chocolate almond milk.

00:21.520 --> 00:23.760
Quite thick and it's very tasty.

00:23.760 --> 00:32.400
It's really hard to swallow too, but it's really good.

00:32.400 --> 00:35.960
I hope you guys are enjoying the daily videos.

00:35.960 --> 00:40.200
My goal for this channel is to do one video a day at least, like a video or a stream or

00:40.200 --> 00:41.200
a something.

00:41.200 --> 00:44.840
Most of the time they will be short videos, like 8 to 15 minutes.

00:44.840 --> 00:49.200
However, I'm sure you noticed that the four days before the Mastercard video came out

00:49.200 --> 00:53.720
there was nothing, and that's because that video just took a lot of time.

00:53.720 --> 00:57.880
So if you ever noticed that I stopped putting out daily videos, and I haven't told you

00:57.880 --> 01:02.760
like I'm going on a vacation or some reason, it's probably because I'm working on something

01:02.760 --> 01:03.760
big.

01:03.760 --> 01:07.000
But for the most part I'm going to try to do something every day on this channel.

01:07.000 --> 01:09.040
Because hey, the YouTube algorithm likes it too.

01:09.040 --> 01:13.440
I want to apologize ahead of time for this article, because there's all these cancerous

01:13.440 --> 01:16.160
Sims 4 ads on it.

01:16.160 --> 01:19.480
Well, I had to turn off my ad blocker to even view it.

01:19.480 --> 01:20.760
It wouldn't even let me see it.

01:20.760 --> 01:27.480
But this is from VG247, some low level games journal site.

01:27.480 --> 01:31.360
Diversity is important because a video game is much more than its gameplay.

01:31.360 --> 01:37.080
The tweet for this article references Battlefield V, of course, because that is currently the

01:37.080 --> 01:42.720
game that absolutely nobody likes due to it being made entirely by diversity hires.

01:42.720 --> 01:45.800
Video games are crafted from so many parts it's difficult to pin down exactly where

01:45.800 --> 01:47.320
the game exists.

01:47.320 --> 01:49.560
The game's the whole thing?

01:49.560 --> 01:54.280
There are no parts of a video game that are not a video game.

01:54.280 --> 01:57.560
Interactive entertainment is getting increasingly complex, and the goals of the creators are

01:57.560 --> 01:59.100
more varied than ever.

01:59.100 --> 02:01.320
Simply being fun often isn't enough.

02:01.320 --> 02:03.720
No that's really the point of it.

02:03.720 --> 02:08.600
You may not find the game fun, but the game has to be fun to somebody.

02:08.600 --> 02:11.720
It can't not somehow engage you.

02:11.720 --> 02:14.360
All forms of entertainment have to either be fun or interesting.

02:14.360 --> 02:20.280
I remember years ago when Yahtzee reviewed No More Heroes, he said that a lot of the

02:20.280 --> 02:27.480
game mechanics were interesting, but if Suda51 was actually sacrificing fun in order to make

02:27.480 --> 02:31.920
some kind of thematic statement, he had his head up his ass.

02:31.920 --> 02:33.120
And I completely agree.

02:33.120 --> 02:37.880
You can make games that tell a story or have a political arc or have a context or something

02:37.880 --> 02:42.800
along these lines that a lot of SJWs like to do, but you also have to make a fun game.

02:42.800 --> 02:47.160
One home is literally just walking through the house, and there's not really anything

02:47.160 --> 02:48.160
to it.

02:48.160 --> 02:51.860
You just walk through a built environment and you inspect things.

02:51.860 --> 02:55.440
You can make a game about teenage lesbians, but it has to have gameplay, it has to be

02:55.440 --> 02:56.600
fun at some point.

02:56.600 --> 03:00.800
Despite this hunger for more diversity within our stories and experiences, there are still

03:00.800 --> 03:04.600
people who push back, pining for the days when gameplay was king.

03:04.600 --> 03:07.920
You're talking as if these two things can't coexist.

03:07.920 --> 03:10.220
For example, you even have this picture here, alright?

03:10.260 --> 03:13.260
This picture is from a game that has a fair amount of gameplay in it.

03:13.260 --> 03:17.460
There's exploring, there's climbing, there's shooting, there's things that the player can

03:17.460 --> 03:21.340
do even though it's about two non-white women.

03:21.340 --> 03:22.340
And you know what?

03:22.340 --> 03:25.800
It being about two non-white women doesn't really matter.

03:25.800 --> 03:28.020
Gameplay will always be king in that regard.

03:28.020 --> 03:32.240
Recently, Battlefield V came under criticism from some circles for its inclusion of female

03:32.240 --> 03:33.240
soldiers.

03:33.240 --> 03:40.640
No, it came under criticism from most circles for its inclusion of female soldiers while

03:40.640 --> 03:43.840
simultaneously claiming to be historically accurate.

03:43.840 --> 03:49.080
If somebody made a World War II game with a bunch of women as soldiers and then it was

03:49.080 --> 03:52.760
like okay this is obviously like just our fucking strange take on it and we're gonna

03:52.760 --> 03:55.360
be goofy about this, I'm okay with that.

03:55.360 --> 03:58.640
But if you're going to claim to be historically accurate, you have to make something that

03:58.640 --> 04:00.800
is at least relatively historically accurate.

04:00.800 --> 04:04.440
According to those people, the women break the illusion more than an enemy magically

04:04.440 --> 04:05.440
spawning on a squadmate.

04:05.440 --> 04:10.120
Well that's because an enemy magically spawning on a squadmate is not a part of the story,

04:10.120 --> 04:11.900
it's a part of the gameplay mechanics.

04:11.900 --> 04:19.120
At some point, you do have to make some concessions in the fabric of reality of the game in order

04:19.120 --> 04:20.460
to make the gameplay.

04:20.460 --> 04:24.980
And usually when it happens, the story does not talk about it.

04:24.980 --> 04:28.720
You don't see it happen in cutscenes, none of the characters remark on it because it

04:28.720 --> 04:30.520
is a gameplay mechanic.

04:30.520 --> 04:33.960
Women want to feel represented in their hobby, it gives them more enjoyment than playing

04:33.960 --> 04:34.960
as a man.

04:34.960 --> 04:36.040
Is this the truth?

04:36.040 --> 04:40.320
Because you know, whenever I play a game, I don't really care much about what I play

04:40.320 --> 04:41.320
as.

04:41.320 --> 04:46.880
And of course, it seems like this article was written by somebody who's a man and therefore

04:46.880 --> 04:52.260
would not really know how women feel about playing as male or female avatars.

04:52.260 --> 04:55.720
Unless Kirk is a gender neutral name, but I don't think it is.

04:55.720 --> 04:59.340
And actually he addresses this right here, one argument is that story and gameplay are

04:59.340 --> 05:02.100
two separate entities, well they are.

05:02.100 --> 05:06.180
Interestingly, having women soldiers in Battlefield V is viewed by some as a story choice.

05:06.180 --> 05:07.820
That's because it is.

05:07.820 --> 05:12.060
I mean, they don't impact the gameplay, they're just an avatar.

05:12.060 --> 05:16.820
In a multiplayer mode, if there were just female soldiers you could play as, you could

05:16.820 --> 05:22.020
just drop into a four player deathmatch or something, or an online mode, I don't really

05:22.020 --> 05:23.020
care about that.

05:23.020 --> 05:27.500
But if you're claiming to be writing a historically accurate story for single player mode, it

05:27.500 --> 05:32.520
has to be historically accurate, which means that women were not on the World War II battlefield.

05:32.520 --> 05:34.060
There is no other way to view that.

05:34.060 --> 05:39.200
I mean, if you want to tell a World War II story and have women involved, you could do

05:39.200 --> 05:41.700
something like Valkyria Chronicles did.

05:41.700 --> 05:47.160
It's a fantasy universe with around a World War II era level of technology, as far as

05:47.160 --> 05:52.820
I can tell, and they have women fighting, because that's how that universe runs.

05:52.820 --> 05:56.500
There's no onus on it to be historically accurate because it's its own story.

05:56.500 --> 06:01.060
Let's move on to academics mobbing of a young scholar must be denounced.

06:01.060 --> 06:06.060
The latest victim of an academic mobbing is a 28-year-old social scientist, Noah Carl,

06:06.060 --> 06:10.780
who has been awarded a Toby Jackman-Newton Trust Research Fellowship at St. Edmunds College

06:10.780 --> 06:12.220
at the University of Cambridge.

06:12.220 --> 06:17.100
Rarely has the power asymmetry between the academic mob and its victim been so stark.

06:17.100 --> 06:21.560
Dr. Carl is a young researcher, just starting out his career, who is being mobbed for being

06:21.560 --> 06:25.700
awarded a prestigious research scholarship on the basis of his peer-reviewed research.

06:25.700 --> 06:35.260
While getting a position like this is normally a time for celebration for junior academics,

06:35.260 --> 06:41.020
Dr. Carl has gone to ground, unable to defend his reputation from libelous attacks.

06:41.020 --> 06:43.980
What's going on here?

06:43.980 --> 06:47.740
300 academics from around the world, many of them professors, have signed an open letter

06:47.740 --> 06:52.300
denouncing Dr. Carl and demanding that the university immediately conduct an investigation

06:52.300 --> 06:57.260
into the appointment process, on the grounds that his work is ethically suspect and mythologically

06:57.260 --> 06:58.260
flawed.

06:58.260 --> 07:01.500
The letter states, we are shocked that a body of work that includes vital errors in data

07:01.500 --> 07:05.340
analysis and interpretation appears to have been taken seriously.

07:05.340 --> 07:09.440
The letter contains no evidence of any academic misconduct, and it does not include a single

07:09.440 --> 07:14.820
reference to any of Dr. Carl's papers.

07:14.820 --> 07:15.820
What is this?

07:15.820 --> 07:18.920
Open letter for racist pseudos...

07:18.920 --> 07:23.480
No place for racist pseudoscience at Cambridge.

07:23.480 --> 07:26.460
Did he do something racist, or is this just a witch hunt?

07:26.460 --> 07:29.920
We write to express our dismay at the appointment of Noah Carl, careful consideration of his

07:29.920 --> 07:34.680
published work and public stance on various issues, particularly on the claimed relationship

07:34.680 --> 07:39.700
between race, criminality, and genetic intelligence, lead us to conclude that his work is ethically

07:39.700 --> 07:42.780
suspect and mythologically flawed.

07:42.780 --> 07:43.780
Is there any evidence...

07:43.780 --> 07:47.400
Okay, there's a bunch of professors who don't want him to do it, but is there any evidence

07:47.400 --> 07:50.120
that what he's doing is factually incorrect?

07:50.120 --> 07:54.580
We call on the college, the university, and the Newton Trust to issue a public statement

07:54.580 --> 07:59.480
disassociating themselves from research that seeks to establish correlations between race,

07:59.480 --> 08:03.640
genes, intelligence, and criminality in order to explain one by the other.

08:03.640 --> 08:07.400
I don't think any of these groups are going out with the express objective of trying to

08:07.400 --> 08:12.520
establish a correlation between race, genes, intelligence, and criminality.

08:12.520 --> 08:16.000
I think they just want to investigate the issue impartially.

08:16.000 --> 08:19.480
And if that's the problem, if the problem is that he wants to look into it eyes open,

08:19.480 --> 08:21.080
I think you guys are wrong.

08:21.080 --> 08:22.460
Like obviously wrong.

08:22.460 --> 08:26.000
It's almost like you're putting the cart before the horse when you want to completely bar

08:26.000 --> 08:27.880
this type of research.

08:27.880 --> 08:32.200
Dr. Carl's crime is that he has defended intelligence researchers who have written about the taboo

08:32.200 --> 08:37.280
topics of race, genes, and IQ, and argue that stifling debate in these areas is likely to

08:37.280 --> 08:40.200
cause more harm than allowing them to be freely discussed by academics.

08:40.200 --> 08:45.960
Yeah, I mean, if it's politically inconvenient that the science may show a link between race,

08:45.960 --> 08:51.720
genes, and IQ, that sucks, I guess, but the truth is still incontrovertible.

08:51.720 --> 08:55.080
If that's what the truth is, I don't know, I'm not a scientist, but censoring people

08:55.080 --> 09:01.360
who want to conduct impartial research into these forbidden taboo topics is not the way

09:01.360 --> 09:02.360
to go.

09:02.360 --> 09:06.460
One of the people who signed that letter, Professor Graeber, did not specify a single

09:06.460 --> 09:10.720
research paper by Dr. Carl that includes any of the aforementioned concepts, let alone

09:10.720 --> 09:11.760
all three.

09:11.760 --> 09:16.000
And we couldn't find any instances in Dr. Carl's academic writing of his using the

09:16.000 --> 09:17.600
term genetic intelligence.

09:17.600 --> 09:21.840
The implication of Professor Graeber's response, as well as the letter, is that Dr. Carl has

09:21.840 --> 09:26.640
linked average differences in intelligence between races to genetic differences, when

09:26.640 --> 09:31.880
in fact he has stated that a genetic contribution to racial gaps in IQ has not been conclusively

09:31.880 --> 09:32.880
demonstrated.

09:32.880 --> 09:36.100
It sounds like they just don't want him to talk about it at all, even if he's agreeing

09:36.100 --> 09:37.100
with them.

09:37.100 --> 09:40.860
Perhaps Professor Graeber is confusing references in Dr. Carl's work to the fact that the individual

09:40.860 --> 09:46.060
differences in IQ are genetically influenced, although not genetically determined, with

09:46.060 --> 09:49.700
claims about group differences being genetically influenced?

09:49.700 --> 09:54.020
The second would be controversial, but the first is one of the most robust, off-replicated

09:54.020 --> 09:55.480
findings in all of psychology.

09:55.480 --> 10:01.580
So it sounds like Dr. Carl is saying something that equates to one of the most robust, off-replicated

10:01.580 --> 10:07.020
findings in all of psychology, and yet it is also very easily confused with something

10:07.020 --> 10:13.660
controversial, and so as a way to smear him, these people are just saying that he's controversial.

10:13.660 --> 10:15.380
This is absolutely fucking ridiculous.

10:15.380 --> 10:17.140
Let's stay on campus for a little bit longer.

10:17.140 --> 10:19.480
Exeter University expels students over racism.

10:19.480 --> 10:20.480
This looks somewhat familiar.

10:20.480 --> 10:21.980
Have I done this article before?

10:21.980 --> 10:23.200
I don't know.

10:23.200 --> 10:27.660
University launched investigation after allegations of racism, sexism, and homophobia, of course.

10:27.660 --> 10:30.940
Several students at the University of Exeter have been expelled following allegations of

10:30.940 --> 10:32.300
yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

10:32.300 --> 10:37.840
If you ain't English, go home, bomb the mosques, and we need a race war.

10:37.840 --> 10:40.220
It sounds like they're just being edgy shitlords.

10:40.220 --> 10:45.460
A student created the Dodgy Blokes Society WhatsApp group last summer for use by a small

10:45.460 --> 10:50.080
group of students attached to the Braxton Law Society, but its content became increasingly

10:50.080 --> 10:54.860
racist and deplorable over time, and he began to document the worst examples.

10:54.860 --> 10:59.200
Among them, he said, were cases in which students backed a policy of racial discrimination and

10:59.200 --> 11:02.640
joked about buying slaves from African countries.

11:02.640 --> 11:04.320
Holy, okay.

11:04.320 --> 11:09.360
There comes a time when people say something so outlandish, so ridiculous, that either

11:09.360 --> 11:14.680
you're truly living in a society degrading into tyranny, or alternatively, it's a fucking

11:14.680 --> 11:15.680
joke.

11:15.680 --> 11:20.280
And I guess people on the far left think that it's the former, but I'm pretty sure it's

11:20.280 --> 11:21.280
the latter.

11:21.280 --> 11:24.780
These incidents are happening all the time, but they are not visible.

11:24.780 --> 11:28.280
There will be other group chats and other incidents of intimidation, but we will not

11:28.280 --> 11:31.040
always see the prejudice.

11:31.040 --> 11:32.360
Is that a complaint?

11:32.360 --> 11:36.920
Are you complaining that the relevant authorities cannot look into every single private chat

11:36.920 --> 11:37.920
room on the internet?

11:37.920 --> 11:40.760
Do you want them to start listening to your phone conversations as well?

11:40.760 --> 11:46.000
It was reported that five students were initially suspended from the university over the incident,

11:46.000 --> 11:49.360
but Exeter refuses to say how many had been expelled, suspended, or subjected to another

11:49.360 --> 11:51.360
form of sanction.

11:51.360 --> 11:52.360
So hold on, hold on.

11:52.360 --> 11:58.360
This university suspended five people for what they said on an app in a private room,

11:58.360 --> 12:01.280
so far off campus because it's the fucking internet.

12:01.280 --> 12:03.080
It's so fucking ridiculous, man.

12:03.080 --> 12:08.800
What you say in private should not be used to publicly punish you.

12:08.800 --> 12:10.240
It's so fucking awful.

12:10.240 --> 12:14.880
Presumably these people aren't actually buying slaves from Africa or actually committing

12:14.880 --> 12:16.240
gang rape.

12:16.240 --> 12:19.560
So it just, it's just, it's fucking terrible, man.

12:19.560 --> 12:23.560
But I have the cure for all of this, a vaccine.

12:23.560 --> 12:41.080
Let's watch this video, eh?

12:41.080 --> 12:45.660
What High Resolves is doing is inoculating people against hatred.

12:45.660 --> 12:58.860
What it's doing is giving them capabilities to build a better future.

12:58.860 --> 13:04.080
The secret sauce of High Resolves is creating activities where young people get to make

13:04.080 --> 13:15.440
some kind of moral choice and then getting them to reflect on that choice.

13:15.440 --> 13:19.440
You then have to do some repeated practice in the classroom so that it moves from working

13:19.440 --> 13:38.880
memory to long-term memory.

13:38.880 --> 13:46.640
What if you could inoculate a critical mass of a society?

13:46.640 --> 13:54.400
Okay, so I was actually scared that they were going to start drugging people to make them

13:54.400 --> 13:59.320
more compliant when it comes to ridiculous nonsense that happens around them.

13:59.320 --> 14:04.660
I've already seen some insane stories, like people wanting to put laudanum in the water

14:04.660 --> 14:09.820
supply and just like complete nutjobs like that, putting magnets in your fucking brain

14:09.820 --> 14:13.060
so a vaccine wouldn't actually be out of the question.

14:13.060 --> 14:18.860
There just seems to be this preoccupation with altering human biology to make it more

14:18.860 --> 14:25.260
social justice compliant and it's just, it's just nightmare fuel, man.

14:25.260 --> 14:27.560
But at least that's not what we're talking about here.

14:27.560 --> 14:33.160
This is just basically, okay, expose people to situations where maybe their beliefs and

14:33.160 --> 14:34.160
views can be challenged.

14:34.160 --> 14:35.160
Okay, you know, fine.

14:35.160 --> 14:38.160
That's what happens all the time.

14:38.160 --> 14:44.500
However, I have a feeling that when they say hatred and prejudice, they don't actually

14:44.500 --> 14:45.960
mean hatred and prejudice.

14:45.960 --> 14:51.500
They mean, you know, making people more accepting to mass migration, open borders, the complete

14:51.500 --> 14:54.320
destruction of job markets and lowering of wages.

14:54.320 --> 14:56.880
All because if you object, then you're a racist, obviously.

14:56.880 --> 14:59.180
Anyway, that's the end for me today, guys.

14:59.180 --> 15:00.760
I know this is short.

15:00.760 --> 15:05.640
Honestly, the SJ weeklies might be a little bit shorter than normal for a while just due

15:05.640 --> 15:11.960
to the demand of simultaneously making short everyday videos and occasionally making some

15:11.960 --> 15:14.080
longer bombshell ones.

15:14.080 --> 15:16.400
And the less though, I will see you guys tomorrow.

15:16.400 --> 15:16.920
I love you.
