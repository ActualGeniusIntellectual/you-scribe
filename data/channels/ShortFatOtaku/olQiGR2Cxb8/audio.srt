00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,760
Hey everyone, welcome to SJ Weekly for January 6th, 2019.

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:07,920
Today I'm not having a caffeinated drink at all.

3
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:12,520
It's actually a smoothie, because I'm trying to lose weight and get healthy.

4
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:19,120
So in this smoothie I have protein powder, flax seed, bananas, avocado, blueberries,

5
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:21,520
kale, and some chocolate almond milk.

6
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:23,760
Quite thick and it's very tasty.

7
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:32,400
It's really hard to swallow too, but it's really good.

8
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:35,960
I hope you guys are enjoying the daily videos.

9
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:40,200
My goal for this channel is to do one video a day at least, like a video or a stream or

10
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:41,200
a something.

11
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:44,840
Most of the time they will be short videos, like 8 to 15 minutes.

12
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:49,200
However, I'm sure you noticed that the four days before the Mastercard video came out

13
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:53,720
there was nothing, and that's because that video just took a lot of time.

14
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:57,880
So if you ever noticed that I stopped putting out daily videos, and I haven't told you

15
00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:02,760
like I'm going on a vacation or some reason, it's probably because I'm working on something

16
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:03,760
big.

17
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:07,000
But for the most part I'm going to try to do something every day on this channel.

18
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,040
Because hey, the YouTube algorithm likes it too.

19
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:13,440
I want to apologize ahead of time for this article, because there's all these cancerous

20
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:16,160
Sims 4 ads on it.

21
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:19,480
Well, I had to turn off my ad blocker to even view it.

22
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:20,760
It wouldn't even let me see it.

23
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:27,480
But this is from VG247, some low level games journal site.

24
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:31,360
Diversity is important because a video game is much more than its gameplay.

25
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:37,080
The tweet for this article references Battlefield V, of course, because that is currently the

26
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:42,720
game that absolutely nobody likes due to it being made entirely by diversity hires.

27
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,800
Video games are crafted from so many parts it's difficult to pin down exactly where

28
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:47,320
the game exists.

29
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:49,560
The game's the whole thing?

30
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:54,280
There are no parts of a video game that are not a video game.

31
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:57,560
Interactive entertainment is getting increasingly complex, and the goals of the creators are

32
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:59,100
more varied than ever.

33
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:01,320
Simply being fun often isn't enough.

34
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:03,720
No that's really the point of it.

35
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:08,600
You may not find the game fun, but the game has to be fun to somebody.

36
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:11,720
It can't not somehow engage you.

37
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:14,360
All forms of entertainment have to either be fun or interesting.

38
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:20,280
I remember years ago when Yahtzee reviewed No More Heroes, he said that a lot of the

39
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:27,480
game mechanics were interesting, but if Suda51 was actually sacrificing fun in order to make

40
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:31,920
some kind of thematic statement, he had his head up his ass.

41
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,120
And I completely agree.

42
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:37,880
You can make games that tell a story or have a political arc or have a context or something

43
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:42,800
along these lines that a lot of SJWs like to do, but you also have to make a fun game.

44
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:47,160
One home is literally just walking through the house, and there's not really anything

45
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:48,160
to it.

46
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:51,860
You just walk through a built environment and you inspect things.

47
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:55,440
You can make a game about teenage lesbians, but it has to have gameplay, it has to be

48
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:56,600
fun at some point.

49
00:02:56,600 --> 00:03:00,800
Despite this hunger for more diversity within our stories and experiences, there are still

50
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:04,600
people who push back, pining for the days when gameplay was king.

51
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:07,920
You're talking as if these two things can't coexist.

52
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,220
For example, you even have this picture here, alright?

53
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:13,260
This picture is from a game that has a fair amount of gameplay in it.

54
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:17,460
There's exploring, there's climbing, there's shooting, there's things that the player can

55
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:21,340
do even though it's about two non-white women.

56
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:22,340
And you know what?

57
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:25,800
It being about two non-white women doesn't really matter.

58
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:28,020
Gameplay will always be king in that regard.

59
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:32,240
Recently, Battlefield V came under criticism from some circles for its inclusion of female

60
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,240
soldiers.

61
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:40,640
No, it came under criticism from most circles for its inclusion of female soldiers while

62
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:43,840
simultaneously claiming to be historically accurate.

63
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:49,080
If somebody made a World War II game with a bunch of women as soldiers and then it was

64
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:52,760
like okay this is obviously like just our fucking strange take on it and we're gonna

65
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:55,360
be goofy about this, I'm okay with that.

66
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,640
But if you're going to claim to be historically accurate, you have to make something that

67
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,800
is at least relatively historically accurate.

68
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:04,440
According to those people, the women break the illusion more than an enemy magically

69
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:05,440
spawning on a squadmate.

70
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:10,120
Well that's because an enemy magically spawning on a squadmate is not a part of the story,

71
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,900
it's a part of the gameplay mechanics.

72
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:19,120
At some point, you do have to make some concessions in the fabric of reality of the game in order

73
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,460
to make the gameplay.

74
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:24,980
And usually when it happens, the story does not talk about it.

75
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:28,720
You don't see it happen in cutscenes, none of the characters remark on it because it

76
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,520
is a gameplay mechanic.

77
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:33,960
Women want to feel represented in their hobby, it gives them more enjoyment than playing

78
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:34,960
as a man.

79
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,040
Is this the truth?

80
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:40,320
Because you know, whenever I play a game, I don't really care much about what I play

81
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,320
as.

82
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:46,880
And of course, it seems like this article was written by somebody who's a man and therefore

83
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:52,260
would not really know how women feel about playing as male or female avatars.

84
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:55,720
Unless Kirk is a gender neutral name, but I don't think it is.

85
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:59,340
And actually he addresses this right here, one argument is that story and gameplay are

86
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:02,100
two separate entities, well they are.

87
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:06,180
Interestingly, having women soldiers in Battlefield V is viewed by some as a story choice.

88
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:07,820
That's because it is.

89
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:12,060
I mean, they don't impact the gameplay, they're just an avatar.

90
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:16,820
In a multiplayer mode, if there were just female soldiers you could play as, you could

91
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:22,020
just drop into a four player deathmatch or something, or an online mode, I don't really

92
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:23,020
care about that.

93
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:27,500
But if you're claiming to be writing a historically accurate story for single player mode, it

94
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:32,520
has to be historically accurate, which means that women were not on the World War II battlefield.

95
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:34,060
There is no other way to view that.

96
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:39,200
I mean, if you want to tell a World War II story and have women involved, you could do

97
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:41,700
something like Valkyria Chronicles did.

98
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:47,160
It's a fantasy universe with around a World War II era level of technology, as far as

99
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:52,820
I can tell, and they have women fighting, because that's how that universe runs.

100
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:56,500
There's no onus on it to be historically accurate because it's its own story.

101
00:05:56,500 --> 00:06:01,060
Let's move on to academics mobbing of a young scholar must be denounced.

102
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:06,060
The latest victim of an academic mobbing is a 28-year-old social scientist, Noah Carl,

103
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:10,780
who has been awarded a Toby Jackman-Newton Trust Research Fellowship at St. Edmunds College

104
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:12,220
at the University of Cambridge.

105
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:17,100
Rarely has the power asymmetry between the academic mob and its victim been so stark.

106
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:21,560
Dr. Carl is a young researcher, just starting out his career, who is being mobbed for being

107
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:25,700
awarded a prestigious research scholarship on the basis of his peer-reviewed research.

108
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:35,260
While getting a position like this is normally a time for celebration for junior academics,

109
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:41,020
Dr. Carl has gone to ground, unable to defend his reputation from libelous attacks.

110
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:43,980
What's going on here?

111
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:47,740
300 academics from around the world, many of them professors, have signed an open letter

112
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:52,300
denouncing Dr. Carl and demanding that the university immediately conduct an investigation

113
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:57,260
into the appointment process, on the grounds that his work is ethically suspect and mythologically

114
00:06:57,260 --> 00:06:58,260
flawed.

115
00:06:58,260 --> 00:07:01,500
The letter states, we are shocked that a body of work that includes vital errors in data

116
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:05,340
analysis and interpretation appears to have been taken seriously.

117
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:09,440
The letter contains no evidence of any academic misconduct, and it does not include a single

118
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:14,820
reference to any of Dr. Carl's papers.

119
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:15,820
What is this?

120
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:18,920
Open letter for racist pseudos...

121
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:23,480
No place for racist pseudoscience at Cambridge.

122
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:26,460
Did he do something racist, or is this just a witch hunt?

123
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:29,920
We write to express our dismay at the appointment of Noah Carl, careful consideration of his

124
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:34,680
published work and public stance on various issues, particularly on the claimed relationship

125
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:39,700
between race, criminality, and genetic intelligence, lead us to conclude that his work is ethically

126
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:42,780
suspect and mythologically flawed.

127
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:43,780
Is there any evidence...

128
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:47,400
Okay, there's a bunch of professors who don't want him to do it, but is there any evidence

129
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:50,120
that what he's doing is factually incorrect?

130
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:54,580
We call on the college, the university, and the Newton Trust to issue a public statement

131
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:59,480
disassociating themselves from research that seeks to establish correlations between race,

132
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:03,640
genes, intelligence, and criminality in order to explain one by the other.

133
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:07,400
I don't think any of these groups are going out with the express objective of trying to

134
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:12,520
establish a correlation between race, genes, intelligence, and criminality.

135
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:16,000
I think they just want to investigate the issue impartially.

136
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,480
And if that's the problem, if the problem is that he wants to look into it eyes open,

137
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:21,080
I think you guys are wrong.

138
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:22,460
Like obviously wrong.

139
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:26,000
It's almost like you're putting the cart before the horse when you want to completely bar

140
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,880
this type of research.

141
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:32,200
Dr. Carl's crime is that he has defended intelligence researchers who have written about the taboo

142
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:37,280
topics of race, genes, and IQ, and argue that stifling debate in these areas is likely to

143
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:40,200
cause more harm than allowing them to be freely discussed by academics.

144
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:45,960
Yeah, I mean, if it's politically inconvenient that the science may show a link between race,

145
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:51,720
genes, and IQ, that sucks, I guess, but the truth is still incontrovertible.

146
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:55,080
If that's what the truth is, I don't know, I'm not a scientist, but censoring people

147
00:08:55,080 --> 00:09:01,360
who want to conduct impartial research into these forbidden taboo topics is not the way

148
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,360
to go.

149
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:06,460
One of the people who signed that letter, Professor Graeber, did not specify a single

150
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:10,720
research paper by Dr. Carl that includes any of the aforementioned concepts, let alone

151
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:11,760
all three.

152
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:16,000
And we couldn't find any instances in Dr. Carl's academic writing of his using the

153
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,600
term genetic intelligence.

154
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:21,840
The implication of Professor Graeber's response, as well as the letter, is that Dr. Carl has

155
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:26,640
linked average differences in intelligence between races to genetic differences, when

156
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:31,880
in fact he has stated that a genetic contribution to racial gaps in IQ has not been conclusively

157
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:32,880
demonstrated.

158
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:36,100
It sounds like they just don't want him to talk about it at all, even if he's agreeing

159
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:37,100
with them.

160
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:40,860
Perhaps Professor Graeber is confusing references in Dr. Carl's work to the fact that the individual

161
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:46,060
differences in IQ are genetically influenced, although not genetically determined, with

162
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:49,700
claims about group differences being genetically influenced?

163
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:54,020
The second would be controversial, but the first is one of the most robust, off-replicated

164
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:55,480
findings in all of psychology.

165
00:09:55,480 --> 00:10:01,580
So it sounds like Dr. Carl is saying something that equates to one of the most robust, off-replicated

166
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:07,020
findings in all of psychology, and yet it is also very easily confused with something

167
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:13,660
controversial, and so as a way to smear him, these people are just saying that he's controversial.

168
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:15,380
This is absolutely fucking ridiculous.

169
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:17,140
Let's stay on campus for a little bit longer.

170
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:19,480
Exeter University expels students over racism.

171
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:20,480
This looks somewhat familiar.

172
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,980
Have I done this article before?

173
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:23,200
I don't know.

174
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:27,660
University launched investigation after allegations of racism, sexism, and homophobia, of course.

175
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:30,940
Several students at the University of Exeter have been expelled following allegations of

176
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:32,300
yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

177
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:37,840
If you ain't English, go home, bomb the mosques, and we need a race war.

178
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:40,220
It sounds like they're just being edgy shitlords.

179
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:45,460
A student created the Dodgy Blokes Society WhatsApp group last summer for use by a small

180
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:50,080
group of students attached to the Braxton Law Society, but its content became increasingly

181
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:54,860
racist and deplorable over time, and he began to document the worst examples.

182
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:59,200
Among them, he said, were cases in which students backed a policy of racial discrimination and

183
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:02,640
joked about buying slaves from African countries.

184
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,320
Holy, okay.

185
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:09,360
There comes a time when people say something so outlandish, so ridiculous, that either

186
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:14,680
you're truly living in a society degrading into tyranny, or alternatively, it's a fucking

187
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:15,680
joke.

188
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:20,280
And I guess people on the far left think that it's the former, but I'm pretty sure it's

189
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:21,280
the latter.

190
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:24,780
These incidents are happening all the time, but they are not visible.

191
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:28,280
There will be other group chats and other incidents of intimidation, but we will not

192
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:31,040
always see the prejudice.

193
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,360
Is that a complaint?

194
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:36,920
Are you complaining that the relevant authorities cannot look into every single private chat

195
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:37,920
room on the internet?

196
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:40,760
Do you want them to start listening to your phone conversations as well?

197
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:46,000
It was reported that five students were initially suspended from the university over the incident,

198
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,360
but Exeter refuses to say how many had been expelled, suspended, or subjected to another

199
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,360
form of sanction.

200
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,360
So hold on, hold on.

201
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:58,360
This university suspended five people for what they said on an app in a private room,

202
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:01,280
so far off campus because it's the fucking internet.

203
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:03,080
It's so fucking ridiculous, man.

204
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:08,800
What you say in private should not be used to publicly punish you.

205
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,240
It's so fucking awful.

206
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:14,880
Presumably these people aren't actually buying slaves from Africa or actually committing

207
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,240
gang rape.

208
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:19,560
So it just, it's just, it's fucking terrible, man.

209
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:23,560
But I have the cure for all of this, a vaccine.

210
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:41,080
Let's watch this video, eh?

211
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:45,660
What High Resolves is doing is inoculating people against hatred.

212
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:58,860
What it's doing is giving them capabilities to build a better future.

213
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:04,080
The secret sauce of High Resolves is creating activities where young people get to make

214
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:15,440
some kind of moral choice and then getting them to reflect on that choice.

215
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:19,440
You then have to do some repeated practice in the classroom so that it moves from working

216
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:38,880
memory to long-term memory.

217
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:46,640
What if you could inoculate a critical mass of a society?

218
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:54,400
Okay, so I was actually scared that they were going to start drugging people to make them

219
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:59,320
more compliant when it comes to ridiculous nonsense that happens around them.

220
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:04,660
I've already seen some insane stories, like people wanting to put laudanum in the water

221
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:09,820
supply and just like complete nutjobs like that, putting magnets in your fucking brain

222
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:13,060
so a vaccine wouldn't actually be out of the question.

223
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:18,860
There just seems to be this preoccupation with altering human biology to make it more

224
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:25,260
social justice compliant and it's just, it's just nightmare fuel, man.

225
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:27,560
But at least that's not what we're talking about here.

226
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:33,160
This is just basically, okay, expose people to situations where maybe their beliefs and

227
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:34,160
views can be challenged.

228
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:35,160
Okay, you know, fine.

229
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:38,160
That's what happens all the time.

230
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:44,500
However, I have a feeling that when they say hatred and prejudice, they don't actually

231
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:45,960
mean hatred and prejudice.

232
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:51,500
They mean, you know, making people more accepting to mass migration, open borders, the complete

233
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:54,320
destruction of job markets and lowering of wages.

234
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:56,880
All because if you object, then you're a racist, obviously.

235
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:59,180
Anyway, that's the end for me today, guys.

236
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:00,760
I know this is short.

237
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:05,640
Honestly, the SJ weeklies might be a little bit shorter than normal for a while just due

238
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:11,960
to the demand of simultaneously making short everyday videos and occasionally making some

239
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:14,080
longer bombshell ones.

240
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:16,400
And the less though, I will see you guys tomorrow.

241
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:16,920
I love you.
