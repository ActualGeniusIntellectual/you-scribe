0	5760	Hey everyone, welcome to SJ Weekly for January 6th, 2019.
5760	7920	Today I'm not having a caffeinated drink at all.
7920	12520	It's actually a smoothie, because I'm trying to lose weight and get healthy.
12520	19120	So in this smoothie I have protein powder, flax seed, bananas, avocado, blueberries,
19120	21520	kale, and some chocolate almond milk.
21520	23760	Quite thick and it's very tasty.
23760	32400	It's really hard to swallow too, but it's really good.
32400	35960	I hope you guys are enjoying the daily videos.
35960	40200	My goal for this channel is to do one video a day at least, like a video or a stream or
40200	41200	a something.
41200	44840	Most of the time they will be short videos, like 8 to 15 minutes.
44840	49200	However, I'm sure you noticed that the four days before the Mastercard video came out
49200	53720	there was nothing, and that's because that video just took a lot of time.
53720	57880	So if you ever noticed that I stopped putting out daily videos, and I haven't told you
57880	62760	like I'm going on a vacation or some reason, it's probably because I'm working on something
62760	63760	big.
63760	67000	But for the most part I'm going to try to do something every day on this channel.
67000	69040	Because hey, the YouTube algorithm likes it too.
69040	73440	I want to apologize ahead of time for this article, because there's all these cancerous
73440	76160	Sims 4 ads on it.
76160	79480	Well, I had to turn off my ad blocker to even view it.
79480	80760	It wouldn't even let me see it.
80760	87480	But this is from VG247, some low level games journal site.
87480	91360	Diversity is important because a video game is much more than its gameplay.
91360	97080	The tweet for this article references Battlefield V, of course, because that is currently the
97080	102720	game that absolutely nobody likes due to it being made entirely by diversity hires.
102720	105800	Video games are crafted from so many parts it's difficult to pin down exactly where
105800	107320	the game exists.
107320	109560	The game's the whole thing?
109560	114280	There are no parts of a video game that are not a video game.
114280	117560	Interactive entertainment is getting increasingly complex, and the goals of the creators are
117560	119100	more varied than ever.
119100	121320	Simply being fun often isn't enough.
121320	123720	No that's really the point of it.
123720	128600	You may not find the game fun, but the game has to be fun to somebody.
128600	131720	It can't not somehow engage you.
131720	134360	All forms of entertainment have to either be fun or interesting.
134360	140280	I remember years ago when Yahtzee reviewed No More Heroes, he said that a lot of the
140280	147480	game mechanics were interesting, but if Suda51 was actually sacrificing fun in order to make
147480	151920	some kind of thematic statement, he had his head up his ass.
151920	153120	And I completely agree.
153120	157880	You can make games that tell a story or have a political arc or have a context or something
157880	162800	along these lines that a lot of SJWs like to do, but you also have to make a fun game.
162800	167160	One home is literally just walking through the house, and there's not really anything
167160	168160	to it.
168160	171860	You just walk through a built environment and you inspect things.
171860	175440	You can make a game about teenage lesbians, but it has to have gameplay, it has to be
175440	176600	fun at some point.
176600	180800	Despite this hunger for more diversity within our stories and experiences, there are still
180800	184600	people who push back, pining for the days when gameplay was king.
184600	187920	You're talking as if these two things can't coexist.
187920	190220	For example, you even have this picture here, alright?
190260	193260	This picture is from a game that has a fair amount of gameplay in it.
193260	197460	There's exploring, there's climbing, there's shooting, there's things that the player can
197460	201340	do even though it's about two non-white women.
201340	202340	And you know what?
202340	205800	It being about two non-white women doesn't really matter.
205800	208020	Gameplay will always be king in that regard.
208020	212240	Recently, Battlefield V came under criticism from some circles for its inclusion of female
212240	213240	soldiers.
213240	220640	No, it came under criticism from most circles for its inclusion of female soldiers while
220640	223840	simultaneously claiming to be historically accurate.
223840	229080	If somebody made a World War II game with a bunch of women as soldiers and then it was
229080	232760	like okay this is obviously like just our fucking strange take on it and we're gonna
232760	235360	be goofy about this, I'm okay with that.
235360	238640	But if you're going to claim to be historically accurate, you have to make something that
238640	240800	is at least relatively historically accurate.
240800	244440	According to those people, the women break the illusion more than an enemy magically
244440	245440	spawning on a squadmate.
245440	250120	Well that's because an enemy magically spawning on a squadmate is not a part of the story,
250120	251900	it's a part of the gameplay mechanics.
251900	259120	At some point, you do have to make some concessions in the fabric of reality of the game in order
259120	260460	to make the gameplay.
260460	264980	And usually when it happens, the story does not talk about it.
264980	268720	You don't see it happen in cutscenes, none of the characters remark on it because it
268720	270520	is a gameplay mechanic.
270520	273960	Women want to feel represented in their hobby, it gives them more enjoyment than playing
273960	274960	as a man.
274960	276040	Is this the truth?
276040	280320	Because you know, whenever I play a game, I don't really care much about what I play
280320	281320	as.
281320	286880	And of course, it seems like this article was written by somebody who's a man and therefore
286880	292260	would not really know how women feel about playing as male or female avatars.
292260	295720	Unless Kirk is a gender neutral name, but I don't think it is.
295720	299340	And actually he addresses this right here, one argument is that story and gameplay are
299340	302100	two separate entities, well they are.
302100	306180	Interestingly, having women soldiers in Battlefield V is viewed by some as a story choice.
306180	307820	That's because it is.
307820	312060	I mean, they don't impact the gameplay, they're just an avatar.
312060	316820	In a multiplayer mode, if there were just female soldiers you could play as, you could
316820	322020	just drop into a four player deathmatch or something, or an online mode, I don't really
322020	323020	care about that.
323020	327500	But if you're claiming to be writing a historically accurate story for single player mode, it
327500	332520	has to be historically accurate, which means that women were not on the World War II battlefield.
332520	334060	There is no other way to view that.
334060	339200	I mean, if you want to tell a World War II story and have women involved, you could do
339200	341700	something like Valkyria Chronicles did.
341700	347160	It's a fantasy universe with around a World War II era level of technology, as far as
347160	352820	I can tell, and they have women fighting, because that's how that universe runs.
352820	356500	There's no onus on it to be historically accurate because it's its own story.
356500	361060	Let's move on to academics mobbing of a young scholar must be denounced.
361060	366060	The latest victim of an academic mobbing is a 28-year-old social scientist, Noah Carl,
366060	370780	who has been awarded a Toby Jackman-Newton Trust Research Fellowship at St. Edmunds College
370780	372220	at the University of Cambridge.
372220	377100	Rarely has the power asymmetry between the academic mob and its victim been so stark.
377100	381560	Dr. Carl is a young researcher, just starting out his career, who is being mobbed for being
381560	385700	awarded a prestigious research scholarship on the basis of his peer-reviewed research.
385700	395260	While getting a position like this is normally a time for celebration for junior academics,
395260	401020	Dr. Carl has gone to ground, unable to defend his reputation from libelous attacks.
401020	403980	What's going on here?
403980	407740	300 academics from around the world, many of them professors, have signed an open letter
407740	412300	denouncing Dr. Carl and demanding that the university immediately conduct an investigation
412300	417260	into the appointment process, on the grounds that his work is ethically suspect and mythologically
417260	418260	flawed.
418260	421500	The letter states, we are shocked that a body of work that includes vital errors in data
421500	425340	analysis and interpretation appears to have been taken seriously.
425340	429440	The letter contains no evidence of any academic misconduct, and it does not include a single
429440	434820	reference to any of Dr. Carl's papers.
434820	435820	What is this?
435820	438920	Open letter for racist pseudos...
438920	443480	No place for racist pseudoscience at Cambridge.
443480	446460	Did he do something racist, or is this just a witch hunt?
446460	449920	We write to express our dismay at the appointment of Noah Carl, careful consideration of his
449920	454680	published work and public stance on various issues, particularly on the claimed relationship
454680	459700	between race, criminality, and genetic intelligence, lead us to conclude that his work is ethically
459700	462780	suspect and mythologically flawed.
462780	463780	Is there any evidence...
463780	467400	Okay, there's a bunch of professors who don't want him to do it, but is there any evidence
467400	470120	that what he's doing is factually incorrect?
470120	474580	We call on the college, the university, and the Newton Trust to issue a public statement
474580	479480	disassociating themselves from research that seeks to establish correlations between race,
479480	483640	genes, intelligence, and criminality in order to explain one by the other.
483640	487400	I don't think any of these groups are going out with the express objective of trying to
487400	492520	establish a correlation between race, genes, intelligence, and criminality.
492520	496000	I think they just want to investigate the issue impartially.
496000	499480	And if that's the problem, if the problem is that he wants to look into it eyes open,
499480	501080	I think you guys are wrong.
501080	502460	Like obviously wrong.
502460	506000	It's almost like you're putting the cart before the horse when you want to completely bar
506000	507880	this type of research.
507880	512200	Dr. Carl's crime is that he has defended intelligence researchers who have written about the taboo
512200	517280	topics of race, genes, and IQ, and argue that stifling debate in these areas is likely to
517280	520200	cause more harm than allowing them to be freely discussed by academics.
520200	525960	Yeah, I mean, if it's politically inconvenient that the science may show a link between race,
525960	531720	genes, and IQ, that sucks, I guess, but the truth is still incontrovertible.
531720	535080	If that's what the truth is, I don't know, I'm not a scientist, but censoring people
535080	541360	who want to conduct impartial research into these forbidden taboo topics is not the way
541360	542360	to go.
542360	546460	One of the people who signed that letter, Professor Graeber, did not specify a single
546460	550720	research paper by Dr. Carl that includes any of the aforementioned concepts, let alone
550720	551760	all three.
551760	556000	And we couldn't find any instances in Dr. Carl's academic writing of his using the
556000	557600	term genetic intelligence.
557600	561840	The implication of Professor Graeber's response, as well as the letter, is that Dr. Carl has
561840	566640	linked average differences in intelligence between races to genetic differences, when
566640	571880	in fact he has stated that a genetic contribution to racial gaps in IQ has not been conclusively
571880	572880	demonstrated.
572880	576100	It sounds like they just don't want him to talk about it at all, even if he's agreeing
576100	577100	with them.
577100	580860	Perhaps Professor Graeber is confusing references in Dr. Carl's work to the fact that the individual
580860	586060	differences in IQ are genetically influenced, although not genetically determined, with
586060	589700	claims about group differences being genetically influenced?
589700	594020	The second would be controversial, but the first is one of the most robust, off-replicated
594020	595480	findings in all of psychology.
595480	601580	So it sounds like Dr. Carl is saying something that equates to one of the most robust, off-replicated
601580	607020	findings in all of psychology, and yet it is also very easily confused with something
607020	613660	controversial, and so as a way to smear him, these people are just saying that he's controversial.
613660	615380	This is absolutely fucking ridiculous.
615380	617140	Let's stay on campus for a little bit longer.
617140	619480	Exeter University expels students over racism.
619480	620480	This looks somewhat familiar.
620480	621980	Have I done this article before?
621980	623200	I don't know.
623200	627660	University launched investigation after allegations of racism, sexism, and homophobia, of course.
627660	630940	Several students at the University of Exeter have been expelled following allegations of
630940	632300	yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.
632300	637840	If you ain't English, go home, bomb the mosques, and we need a race war.
637840	640220	It sounds like they're just being edgy shitlords.
640220	645460	A student created the Dodgy Blokes Society WhatsApp group last summer for use by a small
645460	650080	group of students attached to the Braxton Law Society, but its content became increasingly
650080	654860	racist and deplorable over time, and he began to document the worst examples.
654860	659200	Among them, he said, were cases in which students backed a policy of racial discrimination and
659200	662640	joked about buying slaves from African countries.
662640	664320	Holy, okay.
664320	669360	There comes a time when people say something so outlandish, so ridiculous, that either
669360	674680	you're truly living in a society degrading into tyranny, or alternatively, it's a fucking
674680	675680	joke.
675680	680280	And I guess people on the far left think that it's the former, but I'm pretty sure it's
680280	681280	the latter.
681280	684780	These incidents are happening all the time, but they are not visible.
684780	688280	There will be other group chats and other incidents of intimidation, but we will not
688280	691040	always see the prejudice.
691040	692360	Is that a complaint?
692360	696920	Are you complaining that the relevant authorities cannot look into every single private chat
696920	697920	room on the internet?
697920	700760	Do you want them to start listening to your phone conversations as well?
700760	706000	It was reported that five students were initially suspended from the university over the incident,
706000	709360	but Exeter refuses to say how many had been expelled, suspended, or subjected to another
709360	711360	form of sanction.
711360	712360	So hold on, hold on.
712360	718360	This university suspended five people for what they said on an app in a private room,
718360	721280	so far off campus because it's the fucking internet.
721280	723080	It's so fucking ridiculous, man.
723080	728800	What you say in private should not be used to publicly punish you.
728800	730240	It's so fucking awful.
730240	734880	Presumably these people aren't actually buying slaves from Africa or actually committing
734880	736240	gang rape.
736240	739560	So it just, it's just, it's fucking terrible, man.
739560	743560	But I have the cure for all of this, a vaccine.
743560	761080	Let's watch this video, eh?
761080	765660	What High Resolves is doing is inoculating people against hatred.
765660	778860	What it's doing is giving them capabilities to build a better future.
778860	784080	The secret sauce of High Resolves is creating activities where young people get to make
784080	795440	some kind of moral choice and then getting them to reflect on that choice.
795440	799440	You then have to do some repeated practice in the classroom so that it moves from working
799440	818880	memory to long-term memory.
818880	826640	What if you could inoculate a critical mass of a society?
826640	834400	Okay, so I was actually scared that they were going to start drugging people to make them
834400	839320	more compliant when it comes to ridiculous nonsense that happens around them.
839320	844660	I've already seen some insane stories, like people wanting to put laudanum in the water
844660	849820	supply and just like complete nutjobs like that, putting magnets in your fucking brain
849820	853060	so a vaccine wouldn't actually be out of the question.
853060	858860	There just seems to be this preoccupation with altering human biology to make it more
858860	865260	social justice compliant and it's just, it's just nightmare fuel, man.
865260	867560	But at least that's not what we're talking about here.
867560	873160	This is just basically, okay, expose people to situations where maybe their beliefs and
873160	874160	views can be challenged.
874160	875160	Okay, you know, fine.
875160	878160	That's what happens all the time.
878160	884500	However, I have a feeling that when they say hatred and prejudice, they don't actually
884500	885960	mean hatred and prejudice.
885960	891500	They mean, you know, making people more accepting to mass migration, open borders, the complete
891500	894320	destruction of job markets and lowering of wages.
894320	896880	All because if you object, then you're a racist, obviously.
896880	899180	Anyway, that's the end for me today, guys.
899180	900760	I know this is short.
900760	905640	Honestly, the SJ weeklies might be a little bit shorter than normal for a while just due
905640	911960	to the demand of simultaneously making short everyday videos and occasionally making some
911960	914080	longer bombshell ones.
914080	916400	And the less though, I will see you guys tomorrow.
916400	916920	I love you.
