00:00.000 --> 00:04.000
From where does the right for the state to use force on its own citizens

00:04.000 --> 00:07.280
spring? This is a question I've been thinking about quite a bit

00:07.280 --> 00:10.800
considering the riots of the past few months. The monopoly on violence or the

00:10.800 --> 00:13.120
monopoly of the legitimate use of physical force

00:13.120 --> 00:16.640
is a concept that has been known to political philosophers for a long time.

00:16.640 --> 00:21.200
It's first talked about in the 1576 work The Six Books of the Republic

00:21.200 --> 00:24.320
and it was popularized in Thomas Hobbes's 1651

00:24.320 --> 00:27.920
Leviathan. I mentioned in a previous video that people who want a stateless

00:27.920 --> 00:30.400
society, and more specifically they want open

00:30.400 --> 00:35.200
borders policies in western countries, they are fundamentally anti-human rights.

00:35.200 --> 00:39.040
They may not say it, they may not even believe it, but if you follow their ideas

00:39.040 --> 00:42.480
to their natural conclusion that's what you get to. Without borders a country has

00:42.480 --> 00:46.000
no jurisdiction. There is no rigidly defined place where

00:46.000 --> 00:49.600
the laws of a country are in effect. The law is the practical compromise

00:49.600 --> 00:52.560
between everyone's overlapping set of human rights.

00:52.560 --> 00:56.720
Everyone has human rights and therefore everyone has a responsibility to uphold

00:56.720 --> 01:00.160
everybody else's human rights. When you fail to uphold those rights

01:00.160 --> 01:03.520
that is when the law steps in. So without borders there's no

01:03.520 --> 01:07.280
jurisdiction, no law, and no rights. And the monopoly on

01:07.280 --> 01:10.160
violence is simply the mechanism by which the state

01:10.160 --> 01:13.600
enforces people's rights. If your rights have been violated, if you've been

01:13.600 --> 01:16.720
assaulted or something, the agents of the state, the police,

01:16.720 --> 01:20.560
will probably have to use violence themselves to apprehend and bring to

01:20.560 --> 01:22.560
justice the person who violated your rights.

01:22.560 --> 01:26.320
But it is because the state is meant to uphold everyone's rights

01:26.320 --> 01:29.840
that they have a monopoly on the legitimate use of physical force.

01:29.840 --> 01:33.120
Only their force is legitimate because they are

01:33.120 --> 01:37.200
in theory supposed to be using it to uphold everybody's rights.

01:37.200 --> 01:40.480
That is what the night watchman state of liberalism is.

01:40.480 --> 01:44.080
The state does not exist to guide the people as the eternal father as the

01:44.080 --> 01:46.720
fascists would claim. The state does not exist to determine

01:46.720 --> 01:50.160
for them what right and wrong is as the socialists would claim. The state is meant

01:50.160 --> 01:53.760
to stay out of the affairs of the people unless the rights of the people have

01:53.760 --> 01:57.280
been violated. It is this restriction that makes their

01:57.280 --> 02:01.520
use of force legitimate. So of course when Antifa goons are

02:01.520 --> 02:04.560
rioting in the streets, when Black Lives Matter protesters

02:04.560 --> 02:08.240
block legitimate traffic, when buildings burn down, when people are assaulted, when

02:08.240 --> 02:11.840
people die during these protests, the police have a

02:11.840 --> 02:14.800
mandate to move in and break them up. Innocent

02:14.800 --> 02:17.680
people's rights are being violated by these rioters.

02:17.680 --> 02:21.120
When that Antifa guy dragged that man out of his car and then kicked him in

02:21.120 --> 02:24.640
the back of the head on the street, that was not a legitimate use of force.

02:24.640 --> 02:28.400
That was political violence and the police have an obligation

02:28.400 --> 02:32.640
to step in. When that crowd of Black Lives Matter people opened fire onto a

02:32.640 --> 02:37.200
car and killed an eight-year-old girl, that was not a legitimate use of force.

02:37.200 --> 02:40.800
But is it possible for the police to overstep their bounds? Is it possible for

02:40.800 --> 02:43.200
the state, even though they have a monopoly on the

02:43.200 --> 02:46.560
legitimate use of force, to use that monopoly in an illegitimate

02:46.560 --> 02:50.800
way? The answer is of course yes. Every single

02:50.800 --> 02:55.440
totalitarian nightmare state, whether that be fascist, nazi, communist,

02:55.440 --> 02:58.400
or socialist, they all show that to be the case. When

02:58.400 --> 03:01.200
the agents of the state fail to uphold the rights of their

03:01.200 --> 03:04.320
citizens but actively violate those rights for the purposes of the

03:04.320 --> 03:06.960
government, then that use of force is no longer

03:06.960 --> 03:10.240
legitimate. But when you're talking about fascism or socialism it's pretty clear

03:10.240 --> 03:12.160
cut. You can see the difference between say

03:12.160 --> 03:15.360
Venezuela brutalizing its own people and American police

03:15.360 --> 03:18.800
stopping violent riots. But what about when things are not so clear cut?

03:18.800 --> 03:23.680
What happens when American police crack down on a legitimately peaceful protest?

03:23.680 --> 03:26.880
Is that an illegitimate use of state force?

03:26.880 --> 03:30.000
I would say yes, it is. And I would say that those police are

03:30.000 --> 03:33.760
just as much at fault as the violent rioters are. Of course the counter

03:33.760 --> 03:36.720
argument to this is also at least somewhat valid. I've

03:36.720 --> 03:40.320
heard Sargon say this phrase before, a peaceful protest is only peaceful

03:40.320 --> 03:43.920
until it's not. There is no guarantee that a peaceful protest will stay

03:43.920 --> 03:47.040
peaceful. Maybe there's some antifa goons in there just waiting to throw on

03:47.040 --> 03:49.920
the black masks and and rile everybody up. Maybe there

03:49.920 --> 03:52.560
actually is a plant from the police side of things

03:52.560 --> 03:56.000
who go around smashing buildings and trying to get stuff started. I know that

03:56.000 --> 03:59.120
some people consider that to be tinfoil hatty but I do actually think that's

03:59.120 --> 04:02.560
happened at least in some places. Either way though it doesn't matter. What

04:02.560 --> 04:05.440
matters is that once a peaceful protest becomes a riot

04:05.440 --> 04:08.560
then the police have a mandate to step in. But not before. Yes,

04:08.560 --> 04:12.240
a peaceful protest is only peaceful until it isn't. But until

04:12.240 --> 04:15.760
it isn't, the police do not have a place to step in.

04:15.760 --> 04:19.120
Yes, the police do have an obligation to wait

04:19.120 --> 04:23.440
until it becomes violent, if it becomes violent, before they have a legitimate

04:23.440 --> 04:27.200
reason to step in and stop it. But are there instances where violent

04:27.200 --> 04:31.360
riots themselves are justified? Where their force, even though it isn't

04:31.360 --> 04:35.600
from the state, is also legitimate? Well, look at the Hong Kong protests.

04:35.600 --> 04:39.840
Nobody except the most indoctrinated brain-dead socialists on Twitter

04:39.840 --> 04:43.600
think that China is actually good at this point. And the Hong Kong people,

04:43.600 --> 04:47.520
in fighting for freedom, they have engaged in violence with the police

04:47.520 --> 04:49.840
there. Sometimes they have even initiated

04:49.840 --> 04:53.680
violence against the police there. Therefore, can we say that a state loses

04:53.680 --> 04:56.640
the monopoly of the legitimate use of physical force,

04:56.640 --> 05:01.360
at least philosophically if not legally, if that state is totalitarian and if the

05:01.360 --> 05:03.840
people are rising up against it in the name of freedom?

05:03.840 --> 05:09.760
On paper, yes you can, but that opens such a huge door that it's

05:09.760 --> 05:13.360
insane, because in in some ways that legitimizes Antifa.

05:13.360 --> 05:15.680
If you actually manage to sit down and talk with an Antifa person,

05:15.680 --> 05:18.240
and you know they don't try to attack you or call you a fast or something, you

05:18.240 --> 05:20.480
can actually get them to speak, let's just say hypothetically for a little

05:20.480 --> 05:23.360
while. They will say that their use of force is legitimate,

05:23.360 --> 05:26.960
because they believe the United States to be a tyrannical state,

05:26.960 --> 05:30.720
and they believe that they are fighting for freedom. Obviously as liberals we

05:30.720 --> 05:33.680
don't believe that, but they do. And now suddenly the whole

05:33.680 --> 05:36.800
thing becomes subjective. If all it takes to undermine the monopoly on

05:36.800 --> 05:40.560
violence is the legitimate belief that your state is corrupt,

05:40.560 --> 05:44.080
even if it might not be, and that you are fighting for freedom, even if you might

05:44.080 --> 05:46.640
not be, then does the monopoly on violence mean

05:46.640 --> 05:50.960
anything at all? Because if we were to take the philosophy of the monopoly on

05:50.960 --> 05:54.640
violence to be to be something that is moral, that is

05:54.640 --> 05:57.600
respectable, that we should run our societies by, then

05:57.600 --> 06:00.960
there is no room left for revolution in the name of

06:00.960 --> 06:04.720
freedom against a tyrannical government. But Antifa is not really engaging in

06:04.720 --> 06:07.760
revolution, are they? I mean they say they are, all

06:07.760 --> 06:10.080
the rhetoric says revolution, revolution, revolution,

06:10.080 --> 06:13.120
they all want the people's revolution, the workers revolution, they're all

06:13.120 --> 06:16.320
looking for the socialist utopia, but what do they actually do? They

06:16.320 --> 06:18.640
protest, then those protests become violent,

06:18.640 --> 06:21.520
they smash up buildings, they attack random people in the streets

06:21.520 --> 06:26.240
indiscriminately. George Washington used guerrilla tactics, but he did fight a

06:26.240 --> 06:30.160
revolutionary war, he did have an army, he did engage on

06:30.160 --> 06:33.280
the battlefield, he did kill people and have his men be

06:33.280 --> 06:36.960
killed by the enemy, he took cities, he established government

06:36.960 --> 06:40.480
and made declarations. Is Antifa taking cities? They're

06:40.480 --> 06:42.960
destroying cities, but only because the cops aren't

06:42.960 --> 06:45.680
cracking down. Are they taking cities though?

06:45.680 --> 06:48.800
Are they replacing the previous structure with their own, or are they

06:48.800 --> 06:53.040
simply destroying everything around them? Are they balls enough to actually arm up,

06:53.040 --> 06:56.400
engage in a battle with the police, using firearms,

06:56.400 --> 06:59.600
potentially win that battle and then establish their new state,

06:59.600 --> 07:03.200
or are they simply larping, causing property damage

07:03.200 --> 07:07.120
and then screaming about how everything's unfair when they finally get

07:07.120 --> 07:10.080
arrested? If your government is tyrannical and

07:10.080 --> 07:14.400
your cause is just, then your violence can be legitimate if

07:14.400 --> 07:18.800
you engage in a civil war. Not this larping nonsense, not talking

07:18.800 --> 07:22.320
big on twitter, not throwing a few bricks or attacking

07:22.320 --> 07:26.720
random people in the street, but an actual organized uprising. The

07:26.720 --> 07:29.920
tactics that the socialists and therefore Antifa have been using

07:29.920 --> 07:34.400
are not the same tactics that you see in a civil war. They're behaving more like

07:34.400 --> 07:38.400
Germany's brown shirts or Italy's black shirts. In fact Weimar Germany is a good

07:38.400 --> 07:41.440
example, I think that's why at least around this time last year

07:41.440 --> 07:44.960
a lot of liberal commenters were talking about, you know, Weimar America and stuff

07:44.960 --> 07:48.160
like that. It's because the Nazi party, the German

07:48.160 --> 07:52.080
monarchist party, and the German communist party all had a

07:52.080 --> 07:55.040
wing of their party where young people would

07:55.040 --> 07:58.320
dress up and engage in indiscriminate street violence,

07:58.320 --> 08:01.360
destabilizing the country enough that eventually the people,

08:01.360 --> 08:04.720
completely tired and done with all of the street chaos,

08:04.720 --> 08:08.560
democratically elected a strongman authoritarian to come in and restore

08:08.560 --> 08:11.840
order. This is by the way that meme and then

08:11.840 --> 08:14.880
suddenly for no reason at all Hitler was elected to power.

08:14.880 --> 08:17.520
However it's not consistent that socialist street violence always leads

08:17.520 --> 08:20.560
to fascism. Generally what happens is street violence

08:20.560 --> 08:23.920
of any stripe will lead to a political upheaval in the

08:23.920 --> 08:27.200
electoral system of any stripe. So you might get socialist street

08:27.200 --> 08:29.040
violence that leads to a fascist government,

08:29.040 --> 08:31.920
you might get fascist street violence that leads to a socialist government, or

08:31.920 --> 08:34.720
you might get any any other combination. But the only

08:34.720 --> 08:37.760
reason that groups like Antifa do this sort of thing

08:37.760 --> 08:41.520
is because they know they do not have the mandate to actually engage in a full

08:41.520 --> 08:45.280
on civil war. The people just do not support them

08:45.280 --> 08:49.760
enough. So they agitate, they subvert using media,

08:49.760 --> 08:52.880
using education, using whatever it is they can get into. They

08:52.880 --> 08:55.760
radicalize. They welcome the radicalization of

08:55.760 --> 08:59.600
themselves and others as a good thing. They create a moral system where the

08:59.600 --> 09:03.680
more radically you believe, the better of a person you are. And again

09:03.680 --> 09:06.800
it does not take long to look around, you can see people parroting this stuff

09:06.800 --> 09:09.840
all the time. Not all socialists are good people, but

09:09.840 --> 09:12.800
all good people are socialists. Or you see this slogan, actually I think

09:12.800 --> 09:16.320
Shewin Head has this in her avatar, do not let this depress you, let it

09:16.320 --> 09:20.000
radicalize you. They take pride in how extreme they are

09:20.000 --> 09:24.000
as if it is a statement of faith. And in fact they function the same way as like

09:24.000 --> 09:27.840
radical islamists do, who want to impose Sharia law on the entire world,

09:27.840 --> 09:31.440
or radical christians do. You know the 1990s neo-cons

09:31.440 --> 09:34.880
ma-jesus types, the ones who didn't believe that rape was real because the

09:34.880 --> 09:37.120
body has ways of shutting that thing down.

09:37.120 --> 09:40.240
Man, the 90s and 2000s were just rife with

09:40.240 --> 09:43.680
ridiculous quotes coming out of the Republican party, but they were that

09:43.680 --> 09:46.640
type of party back then. They were subverted by Christian

09:46.640 --> 09:49.680
fundamentalists, but now it's 20 years later and a lot of

09:49.680 --> 09:52.800
them have died off. This is where the socialists are now.

09:52.800 --> 09:56.480
They have become so subverted that they believe that they

09:56.480 --> 09:59.680
are simply correct, and therefore all of their violence is

09:59.680 --> 10:03.600
legitimate, and all of the police violence against them is not legitimate.

10:03.600 --> 10:06.720
It doesn't matter who has the monopoly on the legitimate use of physical force,

10:06.720 --> 10:10.480
it doesn't matter who's actually right or who's actually standing for democracy.

10:10.480 --> 10:14.000
They are more radical, therefore they are more correct, and the monopoly on

10:14.000 --> 10:17.040
violence should be in their hands by virtue alone.

10:17.040 --> 10:20.960
And the worst part about it all is that in 10 to 20 years

10:20.960 --> 10:24.560
these Antifa people, these people will be the ones running for office

10:24.560 --> 10:28.800
probably in the DNC, in the same way that AOC and the squad is getting elected

10:28.800 --> 10:32.720
right now. I'm not some blind fucking statist that

10:32.720 --> 10:35.440
thinks all use of police violence is legitimate,

10:35.440 --> 10:38.560
and every single person out there is simply a rioter that needs to be put

10:38.560 --> 10:41.760
down with extreme prejudice. That's not how I view this. The police

10:41.760 --> 10:45.600
have overstepped their bounds constantly for a very long time. They are

10:45.600 --> 10:47.760
probably not going to be held accountable for it, and that is

10:47.760 --> 10:52.480
absolutely infuriating to me. However, in my opinion, the much bigger problem

10:52.480 --> 10:55.920
are the violent rioters of today. Not because they're violent, that's a

10:55.920 --> 10:58.080
problem, but it's a it's a problem in the here and now,

10:58.080 --> 11:01.200
but because of what they will do should they ever actually gain

11:01.200 --> 11:04.800
any kind of power. They will destroy liberal society,

11:04.800 --> 11:08.960
and we have to stop them. It's as simple as that. I'll talk to you guys next time.

11:08.960 --> 11:11.840
I love you.
