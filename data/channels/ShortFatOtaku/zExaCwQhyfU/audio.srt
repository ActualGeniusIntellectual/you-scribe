1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
From where does the right for the state to use force on its own citizens

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,280
spring? This is a question I've been thinking about quite a bit

3
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:10,800
considering the riots of the past few months. The monopoly on violence or the

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:13,120
monopoly of the legitimate use of physical force

5
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:16,640
is a concept that has been known to political philosophers for a long time.

6
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:21,200
It's first talked about in the 1576 work The Six Books of the Republic

7
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:24,320
and it was popularized in Thomas Hobbes's 1651

8
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:27,920
Leviathan. I mentioned in a previous video that people who want a stateless

9
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:30,400
society, and more specifically they want open

10
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:35,200
borders policies in western countries, they are fundamentally anti-human rights.

11
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:39,040
They may not say it, they may not even believe it, but if you follow their ideas

12
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:42,480
to their natural conclusion that's what you get to. Without borders a country has

13
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:46,000
no jurisdiction. There is no rigidly defined place where

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,600
the laws of a country are in effect. The law is the practical compromise

15
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:52,560
between everyone's overlapping set of human rights.

16
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:56,720
Everyone has human rights and therefore everyone has a responsibility to uphold

17
00:00:56,720 --> 00:01:00,160
everybody else's human rights. When you fail to uphold those rights

18
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:03,520
that is when the law steps in. So without borders there's no

19
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:07,280
jurisdiction, no law, and no rights. And the monopoly on

20
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:10,160
violence is simply the mechanism by which the state

21
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:13,600
enforces people's rights. If your rights have been violated, if you've been

22
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:16,720
assaulted or something, the agents of the state, the police,

23
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:20,560
will probably have to use violence themselves to apprehend and bring to

24
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:22,560
justice the person who violated your rights.

25
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:26,320
But it is because the state is meant to uphold everyone's rights

26
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:29,840
that they have a monopoly on the legitimate use of physical force.

27
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:33,120
Only their force is legitimate because they are

28
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:37,200
in theory supposed to be using it to uphold everybody's rights.

29
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,480
That is what the night watchman state of liberalism is.

30
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:44,080
The state does not exist to guide the people as the eternal father as the

31
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:46,720
fascists would claim. The state does not exist to determine

32
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:50,160
for them what right and wrong is as the socialists would claim. The state is meant

33
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:53,760
to stay out of the affairs of the people unless the rights of the people have

34
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:57,280
been violated. It is this restriction that makes their

35
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:01,520
use of force legitimate. So of course when Antifa goons are

36
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:04,560
rioting in the streets, when Black Lives Matter protesters

37
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:08,240
block legitimate traffic, when buildings burn down, when people are assaulted, when

38
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:11,840
people die during these protests, the police have a

39
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,800
mandate to move in and break them up. Innocent

40
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,680
people's rights are being violated by these rioters.

41
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:21,120
When that Antifa guy dragged that man out of his car and then kicked him in

42
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:24,640
the back of the head on the street, that was not a legitimate use of force.

43
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:28,400
That was political violence and the police have an obligation

44
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:32,640
to step in. When that crowd of Black Lives Matter people opened fire onto a

45
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:37,200
car and killed an eight-year-old girl, that was not a legitimate use of force.

46
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:40,800
But is it possible for the police to overstep their bounds? Is it possible for

47
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,200
the state, even though they have a monopoly on the

48
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:46,560
legitimate use of force, to use that monopoly in an illegitimate

49
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:50,800
way? The answer is of course yes. Every single

50
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:55,440
totalitarian nightmare state, whether that be fascist, nazi, communist,

51
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:58,400
or socialist, they all show that to be the case. When

52
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:01,200
the agents of the state fail to uphold the rights of their

53
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:04,320
citizens but actively violate those rights for the purposes of the

54
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:06,960
government, then that use of force is no longer

55
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:10,240
legitimate. But when you're talking about fascism or socialism it's pretty clear

56
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:12,160
cut. You can see the difference between say

57
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:15,360
Venezuela brutalizing its own people and American police

58
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,800
stopping violent riots. But what about when things are not so clear cut?

59
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:23,680
What happens when American police crack down on a legitimately peaceful protest?

60
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,880
Is that an illegitimate use of state force?

61
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:30,000
I would say yes, it is. And I would say that those police are

62
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,760
just as much at fault as the violent rioters are. Of course the counter

63
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:36,720
argument to this is also at least somewhat valid. I've

64
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:40,320
heard Sargon say this phrase before, a peaceful protest is only peaceful

65
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:43,920
until it's not. There is no guarantee that a peaceful protest will stay

66
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:47,040
peaceful. Maybe there's some antifa goons in there just waiting to throw on

67
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:49,920
the black masks and and rile everybody up. Maybe there

68
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:52,560
actually is a plant from the police side of things

69
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:56,000
who go around smashing buildings and trying to get stuff started. I know that

70
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,120
some people consider that to be tinfoil hatty but I do actually think that's

71
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:02,560
happened at least in some places. Either way though it doesn't matter. What

72
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:05,440
matters is that once a peaceful protest becomes a riot

73
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:08,560
then the police have a mandate to step in. But not before. Yes,

74
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:12,240
a peaceful protest is only peaceful until it isn't. But until

75
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:15,760
it isn't, the police do not have a place to step in.

76
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:19,120
Yes, the police do have an obligation to wait

77
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:23,440
until it becomes violent, if it becomes violent, before they have a legitimate

78
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:27,200
reason to step in and stop it. But are there instances where violent

79
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:31,360
riots themselves are justified? Where their force, even though it isn't

80
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:35,600
from the state, is also legitimate? Well, look at the Hong Kong protests.

81
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:39,840
Nobody except the most indoctrinated brain-dead socialists on Twitter

82
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:43,600
think that China is actually good at this point. And the Hong Kong people,

83
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:47,520
in fighting for freedom, they have engaged in violence with the police

84
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,840
there. Sometimes they have even initiated

85
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:53,680
violence against the police there. Therefore, can we say that a state loses

86
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:56,640
the monopoly of the legitimate use of physical force,

87
00:04:56,640 --> 00:05:01,360
at least philosophically if not legally, if that state is totalitarian and if the

88
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,840
people are rising up against it in the name of freedom?

89
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:09,760
On paper, yes you can, but that opens such a huge door that it's

90
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:13,360
insane, because in in some ways that legitimizes Antifa.

91
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,680
If you actually manage to sit down and talk with an Antifa person,

92
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:18,240
and you know they don't try to attack you or call you a fast or something, you

93
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,480
can actually get them to speak, let's just say hypothetically for a little

94
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:23,360
while. They will say that their use of force is legitimate,

95
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:26,960
because they believe the United States to be a tyrannical state,

96
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:30,720
and they believe that they are fighting for freedom. Obviously as liberals we

97
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,680
don't believe that, but they do. And now suddenly the whole

98
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:36,800
thing becomes subjective. If all it takes to undermine the monopoly on

99
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:40,560
violence is the legitimate belief that your state is corrupt,

100
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:44,080
even if it might not be, and that you are fighting for freedom, even if you might

101
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:46,640
not be, then does the monopoly on violence mean

102
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:50,960
anything at all? Because if we were to take the philosophy of the monopoly on

103
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:54,640
violence to be to be something that is moral, that is

104
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:57,600
respectable, that we should run our societies by, then

105
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,960
there is no room left for revolution in the name of

106
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:04,720
freedom against a tyrannical government. But Antifa is not really engaging in

107
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:07,760
revolution, are they? I mean they say they are, all

108
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:10,080
the rhetoric says revolution, revolution, revolution,

109
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:13,120
they all want the people's revolution, the workers revolution, they're all

110
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:16,320
looking for the socialist utopia, but what do they actually do? They

111
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:18,640
protest, then those protests become violent,

112
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:21,520
they smash up buildings, they attack random people in the streets

113
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:26,240
indiscriminately. George Washington used guerrilla tactics, but he did fight a

114
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:30,160
revolutionary war, he did have an army, he did engage on

115
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:33,280
the battlefield, he did kill people and have his men be

116
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:36,960
killed by the enemy, he took cities, he established government

117
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:40,480
and made declarations. Is Antifa taking cities? They're

118
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:42,960
destroying cities, but only because the cops aren't

119
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:45,680
cracking down. Are they taking cities though?

120
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:48,800
Are they replacing the previous structure with their own, or are they

121
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:53,040
simply destroying everything around them? Are they balls enough to actually arm up,

122
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:56,400
engage in a battle with the police, using firearms,

123
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:59,600
potentially win that battle and then establish their new state,

124
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:03,200
or are they simply larping, causing property damage

125
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:07,120
and then screaming about how everything's unfair when they finally get

126
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:10,080
arrested? If your government is tyrannical and

127
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:14,400
your cause is just, then your violence can be legitimate if

128
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:18,800
you engage in a civil war. Not this larping nonsense, not talking

129
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:22,320
big on twitter, not throwing a few bricks or attacking

130
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:26,720
random people in the street, but an actual organized uprising. The

131
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:29,920
tactics that the socialists and therefore Antifa have been using

132
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:34,400
are not the same tactics that you see in a civil war. They're behaving more like

133
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:38,400
Germany's brown shirts or Italy's black shirts. In fact Weimar Germany is a good

134
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:41,440
example, I think that's why at least around this time last year

135
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:44,960
a lot of liberal commenters were talking about, you know, Weimar America and stuff

136
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:48,160
like that. It's because the Nazi party, the German

137
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:52,080
monarchist party, and the German communist party all had a

138
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:55,040
wing of their party where young people would

139
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:58,320
dress up and engage in indiscriminate street violence,

140
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:01,360
destabilizing the country enough that eventually the people,

141
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:04,720
completely tired and done with all of the street chaos,

142
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:08,560
democratically elected a strongman authoritarian to come in and restore

143
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:11,840
order. This is by the way that meme and then

144
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:14,880
suddenly for no reason at all Hitler was elected to power.

145
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:17,520
However it's not consistent that socialist street violence always leads

146
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:20,560
to fascism. Generally what happens is street violence

147
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:23,920
of any stripe will lead to a political upheaval in the

148
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:27,200
electoral system of any stripe. So you might get socialist street

149
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:29,040
violence that leads to a fascist government,

150
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:31,920
you might get fascist street violence that leads to a socialist government, or

151
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:34,720
you might get any any other combination. But the only

152
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:37,760
reason that groups like Antifa do this sort of thing

153
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:41,520
is because they know they do not have the mandate to actually engage in a full

154
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:45,280
on civil war. The people just do not support them

155
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:49,760
enough. So they agitate, they subvert using media,

156
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:52,880
using education, using whatever it is they can get into. They

157
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:55,760
radicalize. They welcome the radicalization of

158
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:59,600
themselves and others as a good thing. They create a moral system where the

159
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:03,680
more radically you believe, the better of a person you are. And again

160
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:06,800
it does not take long to look around, you can see people parroting this stuff

161
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:09,840
all the time. Not all socialists are good people, but

162
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:12,800
all good people are socialists. Or you see this slogan, actually I think

163
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:16,320
Shewin Head has this in her avatar, do not let this depress you, let it

164
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:20,000
radicalize you. They take pride in how extreme they are

165
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,000
as if it is a statement of faith. And in fact they function the same way as like

166
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,840
radical islamists do, who want to impose Sharia law on the entire world,

167
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:31,440
or radical christians do. You know the 1990s neo-cons

168
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:34,880
ma-jesus types, the ones who didn't believe that rape was real because the

169
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:37,120
body has ways of shutting that thing down.

170
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:40,240
Man, the 90s and 2000s were just rife with

171
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:43,680
ridiculous quotes coming out of the Republican party, but they were that

172
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:46,640
type of party back then. They were subverted by Christian

173
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:49,680
fundamentalists, but now it's 20 years later and a lot of

174
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:52,800
them have died off. This is where the socialists are now.

175
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:56,480
They have become so subverted that they believe that they

176
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:59,680
are simply correct, and therefore all of their violence is

177
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:03,600
legitimate, and all of the police violence against them is not legitimate.

178
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,720
It doesn't matter who has the monopoly on the legitimate use of physical force,

179
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:10,480
it doesn't matter who's actually right or who's actually standing for democracy.

180
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:14,000
They are more radical, therefore they are more correct, and the monopoly on

181
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,040
violence should be in their hands by virtue alone.

182
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:20,960
And the worst part about it all is that in 10 to 20 years

183
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:24,560
these Antifa people, these people will be the ones running for office

184
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:28,800
probably in the DNC, in the same way that AOC and the squad is getting elected

185
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:32,720
right now. I'm not some blind fucking statist that

186
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:35,440
thinks all use of police violence is legitimate,

187
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:38,560
and every single person out there is simply a rioter that needs to be put

188
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:41,760
down with extreme prejudice. That's not how I view this. The police

189
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:45,600
have overstepped their bounds constantly for a very long time. They are

190
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,760
probably not going to be held accountable for it, and that is

191
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:52,480
absolutely infuriating to me. However, in my opinion, the much bigger problem

192
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:55,920
are the violent rioters of today. Not because they're violent, that's a

193
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:58,080
problem, but it's a it's a problem in the here and now,

194
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:01,200
but because of what they will do should they ever actually gain

195
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:04,800
any kind of power. They will destroy liberal society,

196
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:08,960
and we have to stop them. It's as simple as that. I'll talk to you guys next time.

197
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:11,840
I love you.
