0	4000	From where does the right for the state to use force on its own citizens
4000	7280	spring? This is a question I've been thinking about quite a bit
7280	10800	considering the riots of the past few months. The monopoly on violence or the
10800	13120	monopoly of the legitimate use of physical force
13120	16640	is a concept that has been known to political philosophers for a long time.
16640	21200	It's first talked about in the 1576 work The Six Books of the Republic
21200	24320	and it was popularized in Thomas Hobbes's 1651
24320	27920	Leviathan. I mentioned in a previous video that people who want a stateless
27920	30400	society, and more specifically they want open
30400	35200	borders policies in western countries, they are fundamentally anti-human rights.
35200	39040	They may not say it, they may not even believe it, but if you follow their ideas
39040	42480	to their natural conclusion that's what you get to. Without borders a country has
42480	46000	no jurisdiction. There is no rigidly defined place where
46000	49600	the laws of a country are in effect. The law is the practical compromise
49600	52560	between everyone's overlapping set of human rights.
52560	56720	Everyone has human rights and therefore everyone has a responsibility to uphold
56720	60160	everybody else's human rights. When you fail to uphold those rights
60160	63520	that is when the law steps in. So without borders there's no
63520	67280	jurisdiction, no law, and no rights. And the monopoly on
67280	70160	violence is simply the mechanism by which the state
70160	73600	enforces people's rights. If your rights have been violated, if you've been
73600	76720	assaulted or something, the agents of the state, the police,
76720	80560	will probably have to use violence themselves to apprehend and bring to
80560	82560	justice the person who violated your rights.
82560	86320	But it is because the state is meant to uphold everyone's rights
86320	89840	that they have a monopoly on the legitimate use of physical force.
89840	93120	Only their force is legitimate because they are
93120	97200	in theory supposed to be using it to uphold everybody's rights.
97200	100480	That is what the night watchman state of liberalism is.
100480	104080	The state does not exist to guide the people as the eternal father as the
104080	106720	fascists would claim. The state does not exist to determine
106720	110160	for them what right and wrong is as the socialists would claim. The state is meant
110160	113760	to stay out of the affairs of the people unless the rights of the people have
113760	117280	been violated. It is this restriction that makes their
117280	121520	use of force legitimate. So of course when Antifa goons are
121520	124560	rioting in the streets, when Black Lives Matter protesters
124560	128240	block legitimate traffic, when buildings burn down, when people are assaulted, when
128240	131840	people die during these protests, the police have a
131840	134800	mandate to move in and break them up. Innocent
134800	137680	people's rights are being violated by these rioters.
137680	141120	When that Antifa guy dragged that man out of his car and then kicked him in
141120	144640	the back of the head on the street, that was not a legitimate use of force.
144640	148400	That was political violence and the police have an obligation
148400	152640	to step in. When that crowd of Black Lives Matter people opened fire onto a
152640	157200	car and killed an eight-year-old girl, that was not a legitimate use of force.
157200	160800	But is it possible for the police to overstep their bounds? Is it possible for
160800	163200	the state, even though they have a monopoly on the
163200	166560	legitimate use of force, to use that monopoly in an illegitimate
166560	170800	way? The answer is of course yes. Every single
170800	175440	totalitarian nightmare state, whether that be fascist, nazi, communist,
175440	178400	or socialist, they all show that to be the case. When
178400	181200	the agents of the state fail to uphold the rights of their
181200	184320	citizens but actively violate those rights for the purposes of the
184320	186960	government, then that use of force is no longer
186960	190240	legitimate. But when you're talking about fascism or socialism it's pretty clear
190240	192160	cut. You can see the difference between say
192160	195360	Venezuela brutalizing its own people and American police
195360	198800	stopping violent riots. But what about when things are not so clear cut?
198800	203680	What happens when American police crack down on a legitimately peaceful protest?
203680	206880	Is that an illegitimate use of state force?
206880	210000	I would say yes, it is. And I would say that those police are
210000	213760	just as much at fault as the violent rioters are. Of course the counter
213760	216720	argument to this is also at least somewhat valid. I've
216720	220320	heard Sargon say this phrase before, a peaceful protest is only peaceful
220320	223920	until it's not. There is no guarantee that a peaceful protest will stay
223920	227040	peaceful. Maybe there's some antifa goons in there just waiting to throw on
227040	229920	the black masks and and rile everybody up. Maybe there
229920	232560	actually is a plant from the police side of things
232560	236000	who go around smashing buildings and trying to get stuff started. I know that
236000	239120	some people consider that to be tinfoil hatty but I do actually think that's
239120	242560	happened at least in some places. Either way though it doesn't matter. What
242560	245440	matters is that once a peaceful protest becomes a riot
245440	248560	then the police have a mandate to step in. But not before. Yes,
248560	252240	a peaceful protest is only peaceful until it isn't. But until
252240	255760	it isn't, the police do not have a place to step in.
255760	259120	Yes, the police do have an obligation to wait
259120	263440	until it becomes violent, if it becomes violent, before they have a legitimate
263440	267200	reason to step in and stop it. But are there instances where violent
267200	271360	riots themselves are justified? Where their force, even though it isn't
271360	275600	from the state, is also legitimate? Well, look at the Hong Kong protests.
275600	279840	Nobody except the most indoctrinated brain-dead socialists on Twitter
279840	283600	think that China is actually good at this point. And the Hong Kong people,
283600	287520	in fighting for freedom, they have engaged in violence with the police
287520	289840	there. Sometimes they have even initiated
289840	293680	violence against the police there. Therefore, can we say that a state loses
293680	296640	the monopoly of the legitimate use of physical force,
296640	301360	at least philosophically if not legally, if that state is totalitarian and if the
301360	303840	people are rising up against it in the name of freedom?
303840	309760	On paper, yes you can, but that opens such a huge door that it's
309760	313360	insane, because in in some ways that legitimizes Antifa.
313360	315680	If you actually manage to sit down and talk with an Antifa person,
315680	318240	and you know they don't try to attack you or call you a fast or something, you
318240	320480	can actually get them to speak, let's just say hypothetically for a little
320480	323360	while. They will say that their use of force is legitimate,
323360	326960	because they believe the United States to be a tyrannical state,
326960	330720	and they believe that they are fighting for freedom. Obviously as liberals we
330720	333680	don't believe that, but they do. And now suddenly the whole
333680	336800	thing becomes subjective. If all it takes to undermine the monopoly on
336800	340560	violence is the legitimate belief that your state is corrupt,
340560	344080	even if it might not be, and that you are fighting for freedom, even if you might
344080	346640	not be, then does the monopoly on violence mean
346640	350960	anything at all? Because if we were to take the philosophy of the monopoly on
350960	354640	violence to be to be something that is moral, that is
354640	357600	respectable, that we should run our societies by, then
357600	360960	there is no room left for revolution in the name of
360960	364720	freedom against a tyrannical government. But Antifa is not really engaging in
364720	367760	revolution, are they? I mean they say they are, all
367760	370080	the rhetoric says revolution, revolution, revolution,
370080	373120	they all want the people's revolution, the workers revolution, they're all
373120	376320	looking for the socialist utopia, but what do they actually do? They
376320	378640	protest, then those protests become violent,
378640	381520	they smash up buildings, they attack random people in the streets
381520	386240	indiscriminately. George Washington used guerrilla tactics, but he did fight a
386240	390160	revolutionary war, he did have an army, he did engage on
390160	393280	the battlefield, he did kill people and have his men be
393280	396960	killed by the enemy, he took cities, he established government
396960	400480	and made declarations. Is Antifa taking cities? They're
400480	402960	destroying cities, but only because the cops aren't
402960	405680	cracking down. Are they taking cities though?
405680	408800	Are they replacing the previous structure with their own, or are they
408800	413040	simply destroying everything around them? Are they balls enough to actually arm up,
413040	416400	engage in a battle with the police, using firearms,
416400	419600	potentially win that battle and then establish their new state,
419600	423200	or are they simply larping, causing property damage
423200	427120	and then screaming about how everything's unfair when they finally get
427120	430080	arrested? If your government is tyrannical and
430080	434400	your cause is just, then your violence can be legitimate if
434400	438800	you engage in a civil war. Not this larping nonsense, not talking
438800	442320	big on twitter, not throwing a few bricks or attacking
442320	446720	random people in the street, but an actual organized uprising. The
446720	449920	tactics that the socialists and therefore Antifa have been using
449920	454400	are not the same tactics that you see in a civil war. They're behaving more like
454400	458400	Germany's brown shirts or Italy's black shirts. In fact Weimar Germany is a good
458400	461440	example, I think that's why at least around this time last year
461440	464960	a lot of liberal commenters were talking about, you know, Weimar America and stuff
464960	468160	like that. It's because the Nazi party, the German
468160	472080	monarchist party, and the German communist party all had a
472080	475040	wing of their party where young people would
475040	478320	dress up and engage in indiscriminate street violence,
478320	481360	destabilizing the country enough that eventually the people,
481360	484720	completely tired and done with all of the street chaos,
484720	488560	democratically elected a strongman authoritarian to come in and restore
488560	491840	order. This is by the way that meme and then
491840	494880	suddenly for no reason at all Hitler was elected to power.
494880	497520	However it's not consistent that socialist street violence always leads
497520	500560	to fascism. Generally what happens is street violence
500560	503920	of any stripe will lead to a political upheaval in the
503920	507200	electoral system of any stripe. So you might get socialist street
507200	509040	violence that leads to a fascist government,
509040	511920	you might get fascist street violence that leads to a socialist government, or
511920	514720	you might get any any other combination. But the only
514720	517760	reason that groups like Antifa do this sort of thing
517760	521520	is because they know they do not have the mandate to actually engage in a full
521520	525280	on civil war. The people just do not support them
525280	529760	enough. So they agitate, they subvert using media,
529760	532880	using education, using whatever it is they can get into. They
532880	535760	radicalize. They welcome the radicalization of
535760	539600	themselves and others as a good thing. They create a moral system where the
539600	543680	more radically you believe, the better of a person you are. And again
543680	546800	it does not take long to look around, you can see people parroting this stuff
546800	549840	all the time. Not all socialists are good people, but
549840	552800	all good people are socialists. Or you see this slogan, actually I think
552800	556320	Shewin Head has this in her avatar, do not let this depress you, let it
556320	560000	radicalize you. They take pride in how extreme they are
560000	564000	as if it is a statement of faith. And in fact they function the same way as like
564000	567840	radical islamists do, who want to impose Sharia law on the entire world,
567840	571440	or radical christians do. You know the 1990s neo-cons
571440	574880	ma-jesus types, the ones who didn't believe that rape was real because the
574880	577120	body has ways of shutting that thing down.
577120	580240	Man, the 90s and 2000s were just rife with
580240	583680	ridiculous quotes coming out of the Republican party, but they were that
583680	586640	type of party back then. They were subverted by Christian
586640	589680	fundamentalists, but now it's 20 years later and a lot of
589680	592800	them have died off. This is where the socialists are now.
592800	596480	They have become so subverted that they believe that they
596480	599680	are simply correct, and therefore all of their violence is
599680	603600	legitimate, and all of the police violence against them is not legitimate.
603600	606720	It doesn't matter who has the monopoly on the legitimate use of physical force,
606720	610480	it doesn't matter who's actually right or who's actually standing for democracy.
610480	614000	They are more radical, therefore they are more correct, and the monopoly on
614000	617040	violence should be in their hands by virtue alone.
617040	620960	And the worst part about it all is that in 10 to 20 years
620960	624560	these Antifa people, these people will be the ones running for office
624560	628800	probably in the DNC, in the same way that AOC and the squad is getting elected
628800	632720	right now. I'm not some blind fucking statist that
632720	635440	thinks all use of police violence is legitimate,
635440	638560	and every single person out there is simply a rioter that needs to be put
638560	641760	down with extreme prejudice. That's not how I view this. The police
641760	645600	have overstepped their bounds constantly for a very long time. They are
645600	647760	probably not going to be held accountable for it, and that is
647760	652480	absolutely infuriating to me. However, in my opinion, the much bigger problem
652480	655920	are the violent rioters of today. Not because they're violent, that's a
655920	658080	problem, but it's a it's a problem in the here and now,
658080	661200	but because of what they will do should they ever actually gain
661200	664800	any kind of power. They will destroy liberal society,
664800	668960	and we have to stop them. It's as simple as that. I'll talk to you guys next time.
668960	671840	I love you.
