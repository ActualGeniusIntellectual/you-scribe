0	10780	Today is the day where I do a fun little video about a tiny drop of internet nonsense, like
10780	16000	my previous video about how progressives pushed the super inclusive term Latinx to the point
16000	20400	of making the Latino community absolutely hate progressivism, or about how the easily
20400	24600	triggered tend to use the star symbol to censor words on Twitter.
24600	28840	Not just slurs or swears, and remember kids, you can say the word fuck online, but going
28840	33500	so far as to censor people's names so that their public statements are harder to be discovered
33500	34600	outside of their friend group.
34600	36840	Yep, this is a silly little video like that.
36840	37840	Why?
37840	42240	Well, the main reason is because I'm currently juggling like four scripts in various stages
42240	45800	of completion, each of which are at least an hour long and involve tons of editing,
45800	50360	and I still want to at least try and stay on my one video a day streak, so today is
50360	51360	just going to have to be a gimme.
51360	53000	It's okay though, we'll still have some fun.
53000	57400	Here's another bit of terminology that terminally online progressive Twitter culture warriors
57400	61200	tend to regularly deploy, the word normalize.
61200	65360	Whenever you see this shit in a tweet, you know you're reading some garbage dumb fuck
65360	66360	nonsense.
66360	67960	Normalize is a pretty simple word.
67960	71520	Even if I don't give you the official definition, you probably understand, but it means bring
71520	75480	or return to a normal or standard condition or state.
75480	80760	So as a quick example, the normal internal human body temperature is 37 degrees Celsius.
80760	82900	That's 98.6 in freedom units.
82900	85500	If you have a fever, you're likely to be several degrees higher.
85500	90360	When your fever breaks and you return to normal, that is your fever normalizing.
90360	94180	Normalization is the process of taking an abnormal value and returning it to baseline.
94180	96840	However, that's not how progressives use the word.
96840	101280	When a progressive says normalization, they're describing the process of taking an abnormal
101280	103880	value and making it the new baseline.
103880	110240	For example, being trans is pretty rare, ranging from 0.1% to 0.6% of the world population.
110240	113660	The normal value of gender identity is being cis.
113660	118580	If we were to use normalize per the dictionary definition, the phrase normalize transness
118580	122840	means literally to make trans people cis, which is not what progressives want.
122840	127260	When they're saying normalize transness, they mean to say that being trans should be
127260	128360	considered normal.
128360	132820	It should be the default, the baseline, and we should work to make that situation a reality.
132820	136960	In some ways, to normalize something literally means to make it the new normal.
136960	141780	When progressives say this, most of them mean that both transness and cisness should be
141780	142780	the baseline.
142900	148380	But few radicals do genuinely mean to make transness the only baseline and push cisness
148380	149440	to be the outlier.
149440	152540	The terminology they often use in this case is centering.
152540	154900	There can only be one center of a circle.
154900	156860	Everything else is necessarily periphery.
156860	161220	So when you center transness, you are necessarily othering cisness.
161220	165380	It's for this reason that, as a general rule, people who tell me that I have a moral obligation
165380	169460	to center something that isn't already central, I tend to just outright ignore them because
169460	173060	they're simply trying to browbeat me into servicing their politics.
173060	178500	But most progressives who use the term normalization don't actually intend to displace the default
178500	180460	with the beneficiaries of their activism.
180460	184300	They simply want the default to be expanded in order to include them.
184300	187260	Whether or not that's actually possible is a different story that is heavily dependent
187260	188820	on what exactly we're talking about.
188820	193640	The first time the word normalize was ever used in this manner, as in, to describe some
193640	199140	sort of social change the speaker deemed necessary, was in 2019, when this fella said, normalize
199140	200380	apologizing to children.
200380	201940	Okay, this doesn't seem too crazy.
201940	205580	We've all known instances where an adult was mistaken, their kid was correct, and when
205580	209020	the truth came out, the adult didn't apologize in order to maintain authority.
209020	211500	And to be honest, that's pretty shitty to be on the other end of.
211500	212500	So okay, I get it.
212500	215900	But after this, we started seeing calls to normalize random political shit.
215900	217580	Things to normalize for men.
217580	221420	Asking for help, being feminine, going to therapy, encouraging them to talk, seeking
221420	223740	help for mental health, crying or showing emotions.
223740	224900	I get it, I get it.
224900	227100	Men's mental health is in the shitter right now.
227100	229600	And some of this advice might help in some scenarios.
229600	233180	But there's absolutely a type of woman out there who will immediately and permanently
233180	235260	friend zone you if you do any of this shit.
235260	237320	Yeah, those women are terrible and you shouldn't fuck with them.
237320	238320	But you know what?
238320	242460	Despite all of this being kind of true, there's also still a lot of value in stoicism.
242460	243700	Things to normalize.
243700	248340	Same sex relationships, female masturbation, non-binary pronouns, public breastfeeding,
248340	252700	androgynous fashion, not wearing a bra, women in positions of power, guys showing emotions.
252700	255700	This is just your random feminist grab bag of positions.
255700	256960	Most of them have already been normalized.
256960	258520	And the remaining ones are just kind of dumb.
258520	262720	But this really does reinforce the notion that saying normalize X is just a slightly
262720	265320	more academic way of saying I want X.
265320	267520	It ain't just Twitter, this is seeping into journalism too.
267520	271240	Like normalizing conversations about periods at the breakfast table with a uterus shaped
271240	272240	cereal.
272240	273360	Why in the fuck would you ever want to do that?
273360	277120	Or the extremely grotesque, we need to normalize abortion, which is probably the most blatant
277120	281240	example of somebody trying to engineer what the norm is for their own selfish benefit.
281240	285640	There's a round of famous posts where the target being normalized is repeated over and
285640	289040	over, as if saying it many times will make it come true like it's a magic spell.
289040	293160	Like normalize sexist relationships, normalize dating sex workers, going from one extreme
293160	294440	to the other there.
294440	298160	Normalize incest, the front page of PornHub shows us we've been there for years, dude.
298160	300440	Normalize pigging is, uh, this one a joke?
300440	301440	I can't tell.
301440	304440	Reminds me of the dude who engaged in a very similar meme from like a decade ago, I need
304440	308640	feminism because, where he's cited enjoying his girlfriend's strap-on.
308640	312440	The point of all of these is that these are all things that are not normal, and the person
312440	316360	making the post believes they should be, likely for some political or social end.
316360	320520	But this rapidly turned into a very common joke, meant to make fun of these types of
320520	321520	activists.
321520	323860	Like, for example, normalize shitting in the shower.
323860	326200	Normalize singing sea shanties in pubs.
326200	328040	Normalize using XD again.
328040	330960	Normalize leaving after the first red flag, I won't but y'all should.
330960	335600	And then there's the very famous one, normalize platonically telling your bros they look submissive
335600	339500	and breedable, which actually spawned the submissive and breedable meme, as well as
339500	343840	utilizing both the normalize meme and the hand clap emoji between every word meme.
343840	345740	The meme density is high on this one.
345740	349140	Everyone got tired of this whole thing pretty quickly, with people starting to say normalize
349140	352280	shutting the fuck up, or normalize not saying normalize.
352280	355500	We all know what's going on here, it's just a newer, slightly more academic way to
355500	357580	talk about your desired political and social change.
357580	361340	You still see people using the term unironically sometimes in that initial progressive way,
361340	364500	but for the most part nowadays it's just considered a tired joke that pops up every
364500	366580	once in a while, and nobody blinks an eye at it.
366580	368700	In fact, you could say it's become pretty normalized.
368700	372340	Here's a pretty common meme that cuts to the heart of what's going on here.
372340	375900	Listen here, partner, if something has to be normalized, then it ain't normal.
375900	380060	The caption implies that the things that are truly normal are just naturally normal, or
380060	384620	they were normalized not through the activism of a specific political class at one specific
384620	388860	moment in history, but instead by standing the test of time and becoming a tradition.
388860	391580	This combined with the fact that the meme depicts a cowboy, even though he's also
391580	395540	a dog, implies that you should just know what the normal is through simple intuition.
395540	399740	It doesn't need to be academically calculated, or explained, or somehow created, you just
399740	400740	know it when you feel it.
400740	403140	I don't completely agree with this, but I don't disagree either.
403140	406220	You can sort of see this play out when you take a look at what progressives demand that
406220	407600	you don't normalize.
407600	410300	Check out this braindead take from Thought Slime.
410300	415060	Attempts at recuperating Nazi memes seems to often have the effect of normalizing those
415060	418020	memes because now when people see them they aren't instantly repulsed.
418020	422380	It's even worse when the meme format is premised on Nazi ideology, and only the surface
422380	423500	logic has changed.
423500	430940	Like the square jawed yes guy with the chinless drooling guy.
430940	432940	That meme is inherently ableist.
432940	437000	Trying to make the drooling guy Richard Spencer and the buff guy Antifa or whatever doesn't
437000	438000	change that.
438000	440340	It just lets the ableism ooze into leftist messaging.
440340	444900	Okay, uh, if your followers can't tell what's going on here Thought Slime, that might actually
444900	447660	be about their average IQ, not the use of the memes.
447660	449220	But look at what he's saying here.
449220	452420	Memes that the far right use, or whatever this guy considers to be far right, which
452420	455460	is probably everything not part of his specific political circle.
455460	460740	These memes are so inherently far right, that even when non-far right people use them, they're
460740	462700	normalizing far right ideas.
462700	467060	Even if the content of the meme is changed to show Antifa to be the chad and the Nazis
467060	472060	to be drooling wojaks, the framing itself was originally far right, therefore all uses
472060	473540	of it are also far right.
473540	477020	In a video many years ago, I forget which one, it was in the early Trump era I think,
477020	479940	I described this as being like the Midas touch.
479940	482820	Everything a far right meme touches turns far right.
482820	484740	And he's not the only person who thinks this.
484740	486620	It's a pretty common thing to go on about.
486620	487620	Like this here.
487620	489700	Stop memeing about the trad girl wojak.
489700	494060	It is literally based on white supremacist ideals of femininity, and by trying to subvert
494060	496420	it, you're actually making an alt-right meme relatable.
496420	500420	No, I'm not reading another insufferably long twitter thread on this.
500420	501420	That right there will do.
501420	505800	Or how about this person, who wants a little girl beaten for normalizing Nazism because
505800	507060	she likes to draw Pepe.
507060	512300	The logic here is the same logic behind not showing swastikas in a historically accurate
512300	516420	manner, or censoring old works with language considered okay back then but offensive now.
516420	519640	They're thinking that if the current generation has this normalized for them, they'll start
519640	520860	to believe it's okay.
520860	525540	You flip that logic around, and you've now got explanation as to why they demand, say,
525540	528660	black representation in stories where it doesn't make any historical sense, or make sense in
528660	529660	the lore.
529660	534700	To them, normalization, or preventing normalization, is more important than the integrity and accuracy
534700	535700	of the art.
535700	537140	As always, watch my Gramsci video.
537140	540260	The issue is, even by the standard of the pursuit of their own goals, they're still
540260	541260	wrong.
541260	544540	If you change the alt-right meme to not be the exclusive domain of the alt-right, which
544540	547980	did eventually happen to good ol' Pepe even in the minds of the left, you strip it of
547980	549160	its alt-right power.
549160	552760	If a normie looks at Pepe, they're not being transformed into a neo-nazi or whatever, they
552760	556260	see a funny frog, and they laugh about it, and Pepe's status as a symbol representing
556260	557680	the alt-right weakens.
557680	562160	If you want to defeat your enemies, then at least part of what you do is take their symbols.
562160	565060	But if you want to keep the spectre of your enemies around, so that you can virtue signal
565060	568180	about yourself and then use them to draw up support, well, in that case, I can see
568180	570540	why you'd object to taking them down through mockery.
570540	574840	The common leftist objection to the message in that it ain't normal meme is that nothing
574840	576740	is actually normal naturally.
576740	579700	Everything is imposed by the dominant politics of the era.
579700	581300	Check out how this message is worded.
581300	585900	Cisgender heterosexual representation in society is so normalized you don't even recognize
585900	586900	it.
586900	590040	If we inject some color into our otherwise black and white society, you feel like it's
590040	591040	all you can see.
591040	593020	Don't worry, it won't make you gay or trans or kids.
593020	594420	There's a lot of problems here.
594420	598860	But for our purposes today, the assumption being made is that being cisgender and heterosexual
598860	600940	isn't normal, but normalized.
600940	605260	It's not the natural state of humanity, it's imposed by our current politics.
605260	609300	And that, presumably, it's possible for a different world to exist, where a different
609300	613820	politics and culture imposes being transgender and homosexual instead.
613820	617720	In other words, most people are straight and cis instead of gay and trans, not because
617720	620100	of their nature, but because of our culture.
620100	624540	Yes, this completely destroys the moral underpinning of the born-that-way narrative that pushed
624540	626640	for gay marriage back in the 2000s.
626640	629520	But these people either don't understand that or just don't care.
629520	633900	When somebody says that they want to normalize a thing, they're relying on a purely social
633900	635820	constructivist view of the human condition.
635820	639580	That with enough planning, knowledge, and power, the things that conservatives call
639580	641660	human nature can be changed.
641660	643600	Of course, in the real world, that's not how things work.
643600	646060	Not until we develop perfect gene editing or something like that.
646060	650460	The final point on this topic is that the term normal is often used with this undue
650460	651460	moral weight.
651460	655580	It simply means conforming to a standard, usual, typical, expected, without a moral
655580	656580	weight attached.
656580	661300	The assumption of this moral weight, in recent times, is derived from the definition of abnormal.
661300	666160	Often, abnormal does come with a moral weight, deviating from what is normal or usual, typically
666160	668560	in a way that is undesirable or worrying.
668560	673080	The logic is, if the moral weight of abnormal is bad, then the moral weight of normal must
673080	674080	be good.
674100	677560	Therefore, if we normalize something that the dominant culture considers abnormal, we
677560	679960	are also granting it a positive moral weight.
679960	684920	In other words, if we normalize being trans, we make being trans a moral act.
684920	688260	And as long as being trans remains abnormal, it is immoral.
688260	689400	This logic doesn't sit right with me.
689400	693100	And I think it's because as an edgelord millennial who doesn't suffer from trolls' remorse,
693100	695560	being abnormal was actually the goal when I was younger.
695560	699200	The outsiders of my generation, whether that was the nerds or the stoners or the punks,
699200	702320	didn't try to make what we were the normal thing, the dominant culture.
702320	703600	We knew that would ruin it.
703600	705720	We knew the normies would come in and fuck it up.
705720	707560	We didn't want to normalize our differences.
707560	709200	We reveled in being abnormal.
709200	712820	I've done several videos now on the whole conservatism is the counterculture idea.
712820	716640	And what I'm talking about now really seems to resonate with what's going on over there.
716640	721280	The punks of nowadays are parroting progressive orthodoxy, same as most governments and institutions
721280	722280	out there.
722280	724140	So definitionally, they can't be the outsider.
724140	725460	They can't be the abnormal.
725460	727800	If they ever once were, they've since been normalized.
727800	730320	But frankly, it was just better before.
730320	732000	Milo might be a nutjob now.
732000	736200	Before he drove himself off the conversion therapy, Copium cliff, he made an offhand
736200	739960	joke that gay sex was a lot more fun when it was taboo.
739960	743320	And now that everybody's doing it and accepts it, it's just kind of boring.
743320	746720	There is something to that, you know, when you normalize the abnormal, yeah, you end
746720	750500	up bringing people on the fringes into the center, but you also lose everything fun about
750500	757320	being fringe, esoteric knowledge, closed communities, gate kept fandoms, secretly violated taboos.
757320	759360	These things are fun to engage in.
759400	761760	They're actually edgy, not just safe edgy.
761760	766320	Meanwhile, universalized knowledge, inclusive communities, open fandoms, normalization of
766320	768000	the taboo, this is all just lame.
768000	771680	I know that one chick talked about adding color to our black and white world, but it's
771680	772680	actually the opposite.
772680	775040	You're turning those colorful parts into black and white.
775040	778400	The best example that I can think of for this effect is the word queer.
778400	783380	If you read any old literature, you'll know that for a long, long time, queer meant strange
783380	784380	or odd.
784380	789160	In the early 20th century, queer came to refer to people with a strange or odd sexuality,
789160	791720	aka gay or trans people, and it was used as a slur.
791720	794960	It has since been reclaimed by the LGBTQ plus movement.
794960	795960	See, it's right there.
795960	796960	It's the Q.
796960	798960	But what does queer mean to progressives nowadays?
798960	803760	Well, sometimes it simply means being gay or being trans, but that meaning is rapidly
803760	805140	falling out of usage.
805140	806820	Most gay people just call themselves gay.
806820	808240	Most trans people just call themselves trans.
808240	813060	I mentioned in my link as a twink video that there was this concept of the trans umbrella,
813060	818080	that trans activists are now claiming any type of gender nonconformity as being nonbinary
818080	820280	or genderqueer and therefore they're trans.
820280	824800	So tomboys are trans, not because they experience dysphoria or they transition, despite the
824800	829360	attempts of the egg hatchers sometimes, but because their gender presentation is non-traditional
829360	833220	and therefore they're not just tomboys, they're nonbinary and therefore they're trans and
833220	835480	therefore they're part of being LGBTQ.
835480	839120	This is retarded logic, but it is becoming more and more common.
839120	843680	Allow me to introduce you to its equally retarded brother, queer heterosexuality.
843680	848640	It's very easy to find articles and blog posts all over usual lefty spaces talking
848640	850600	about this concept, but here's the TLDR.
850600	854800	In queer political theory, there's this concept of the rehabilitated heterosexual,
854800	859420	the straight person who, while still being attracted to the opposite sex, does not uphold
859420	864280	cis-normative heteropatriarchy through his presentations, actions, or political affiliations.
864280	868680	These people are cis and straight, but nonetheless have non-traditional gender expressions and
868680	870500	adopt alternate gender roles.
870500	874820	In other words, it's the final stop on demon mama's gender is just an aesthetic logic
874820	878660	extended to all of sex, gender, sexuality, and identity.
878660	887540	Gender is a category of self-identification that means what you want it to mean.
887540	895180	And it means what you engage, it refers to how you engage socially and how you assert
895180	896720	your own identity.
896720	901880	So yeah, it is fair to say that gender is essentially an aesthetic.
901880	904960	We've seen bi lesbians and straight lesbians before.
904960	908520	If you can identify as anything you want, why can't you identify as a queer straight?
908520	911080	Here's an excellent practical example of what I'm talking about.
911080	915080	I mentioned recently on the Archcast that there's a Linus Tech Tips series where Linus
915080	919640	gets $5,000 from AMD to build the ultimate PC for one of his employees.
919640	923000	The videos involve getting to know one of the employees who is usually behind the camera,
923000	925840	seeing their home, talking to their spouses, while building the PC.
925840	929320	And in one of these videos, this guy's girlfriend proclaims that she's queer as
929320	930320	fuck.
930320	931320	What does that mean?
931320	932320	She doesn't appear to be trans.
932320	933860	Yeah, I know you can't know 100%, but I'm pretty sure.
933860	935440	And she is in a straight relationship.
935440	936640	Does that mean that she's bisexual?
936640	939140	Why not just say she's bi as fuck?
939140	942720	Is it because she's got the big glasses and the curly hairstyle and the bright yellow
942720	947580	garish overalls and probably a closet full of hoop earrings and flannel shirts and other
947580	949320	queer fashion aesthetics?
949320	951240	That's how this entire segment comes off to me.
951240	956120	If gender is simply an aesthetic, as Demon Momma claims, then queerness is also just
956120	957120	an aesthetic.
957120	961160	And if queerness is just an aesthetic, then straight cis people can wear the aesthetic
961160	966720	and claim all of the moral righteousness of being a part of the LGBTQ plus movement.
966720	968040	That is what normalization is.
968040	969040	That's what it does.
969040	974260	We have normalized being LGBTQ to the point that straight people are ironically queer,
974260	977880	as long as they believe in the correct things and present themselves in the correct manner.
977880	981660	Again, this flies in the face of previous waves of gay and trans activism, which were
981660	983160	interested in assimilation.
983160	986040	One day, I am truly going to have to do that queer theory video.
986040	990080	But for now, the point is, the end result of the normalizing process is the destruction
990080	994920	of everything unique about a thing and its reduction to only its surface level components.
994920	998820	I'm not saying that I want to go back to an era where gays were being persecuted or something.
998820	1001560	If you want that, then I've got some real estate in the Middle East to sell you.
1001560	1006020	I'm saying that normalization destroys all of the good things about being not normal.
1006020	1007020	The fun.
1007020	1008020	The edginess.
1008020	1009020	The sense of community.
1009020	1010020	The sense of specialty.
1010020	1014780	The value of these things is in their particularity, and the universalization of progressivism
1014780	1016540	is anathema to the particular.
