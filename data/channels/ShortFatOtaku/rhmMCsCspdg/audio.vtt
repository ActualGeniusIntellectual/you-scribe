00:00.000 --> 00:10.780
Today is the day where I do a fun little video about a tiny drop of internet nonsense, like

00:10.780 --> 00:16.000
my previous video about how progressives pushed the super inclusive term Latinx to the point

00:16.000 --> 00:20.400
of making the Latino community absolutely hate progressivism, or about how the easily

00:20.400 --> 00:24.600
triggered tend to use the star symbol to censor words on Twitter.

00:24.600 --> 00:28.840
Not just slurs or swears, and remember kids, you can say the word fuck online, but going

00:28.840 --> 00:33.500
so far as to censor people's names so that their public statements are harder to be discovered

00:33.500 --> 00:34.600
outside of their friend group.

00:34.600 --> 00:36.840
Yep, this is a silly little video like that.

00:36.840 --> 00:37.840
Why?

00:37.840 --> 00:42.240
Well, the main reason is because I'm currently juggling like four scripts in various stages

00:42.240 --> 00:45.800
of completion, each of which are at least an hour long and involve tons of editing,

00:45.800 --> 00:50.360
and I still want to at least try and stay on my one video a day streak, so today is

00:50.360 --> 00:51.360
just going to have to be a gimme.

00:51.360 --> 00:53.000
It's okay though, we'll still have some fun.

00:53.000 --> 00:57.400
Here's another bit of terminology that terminally online progressive Twitter culture warriors

00:57.400 --> 01:01.200
tend to regularly deploy, the word normalize.

01:01.200 --> 01:05.360
Whenever you see this shit in a tweet, you know you're reading some garbage dumb fuck

01:05.360 --> 01:06.360
nonsense.

01:06.360 --> 01:07.960
Normalize is a pretty simple word.

01:07.960 --> 01:11.520
Even if I don't give you the official definition, you probably understand, but it means bring

01:11.520 --> 01:15.480
or return to a normal or standard condition or state.

01:15.480 --> 01:20.760
So as a quick example, the normal internal human body temperature is 37 degrees Celsius.

01:20.760 --> 01:22.900
That's 98.6 in freedom units.

01:22.900 --> 01:25.500
If you have a fever, you're likely to be several degrees higher.

01:25.500 --> 01:30.360
When your fever breaks and you return to normal, that is your fever normalizing.

01:30.360 --> 01:34.180
Normalization is the process of taking an abnormal value and returning it to baseline.

01:34.180 --> 01:36.840
However, that's not how progressives use the word.

01:36.840 --> 01:41.280
When a progressive says normalization, they're describing the process of taking an abnormal

01:41.280 --> 01:43.880
value and making it the new baseline.

01:43.880 --> 01:50.240
For example, being trans is pretty rare, ranging from 0.1% to 0.6% of the world population.

01:50.240 --> 01:53.660
The normal value of gender identity is being cis.

01:53.660 --> 01:58.580
If we were to use normalize per the dictionary definition, the phrase normalize transness

01:58.580 --> 02:02.840
means literally to make trans people cis, which is not what progressives want.

02:02.840 --> 02:07.260
When they're saying normalize transness, they mean to say that being trans should be

02:07.260 --> 02:08.360
considered normal.

02:08.360 --> 02:12.820
It should be the default, the baseline, and we should work to make that situation a reality.

02:12.820 --> 02:16.960
In some ways, to normalize something literally means to make it the new normal.

02:16.960 --> 02:21.780
When progressives say this, most of them mean that both transness and cisness should be

02:21.780 --> 02:22.780
the baseline.

02:22.900 --> 02:28.380
But few radicals do genuinely mean to make transness the only baseline and push cisness

02:28.380 --> 02:29.440
to be the outlier.

02:29.440 --> 02:32.540
The terminology they often use in this case is centering.

02:32.540 --> 02:34.900
There can only be one center of a circle.

02:34.900 --> 02:36.860
Everything else is necessarily periphery.

02:36.860 --> 02:41.220
So when you center transness, you are necessarily othering cisness.

02:41.220 --> 02:45.380
It's for this reason that, as a general rule, people who tell me that I have a moral obligation

02:45.380 --> 02:49.460
to center something that isn't already central, I tend to just outright ignore them because

02:49.460 --> 02:53.060
they're simply trying to browbeat me into servicing their politics.

02:53.060 --> 02:58.500
But most progressives who use the term normalization don't actually intend to displace the default

02:58.500 --> 03:00.460
with the beneficiaries of their activism.

03:00.460 --> 03:04.300
They simply want the default to be expanded in order to include them.

03:04.300 --> 03:07.260
Whether or not that's actually possible is a different story that is heavily dependent

03:07.260 --> 03:08.820
on what exactly we're talking about.

03:08.820 --> 03:13.640
The first time the word normalize was ever used in this manner, as in, to describe some

03:13.640 --> 03:19.140
sort of social change the speaker deemed necessary, was in 2019, when this fella said, normalize

03:19.140 --> 03:20.380
apologizing to children.

03:20.380 --> 03:21.940
Okay, this doesn't seem too crazy.

03:21.940 --> 03:25.580
We've all known instances where an adult was mistaken, their kid was correct, and when

03:25.580 --> 03:29.020
the truth came out, the adult didn't apologize in order to maintain authority.

03:29.020 --> 03:31.500
And to be honest, that's pretty shitty to be on the other end of.

03:31.500 --> 03:32.500
So okay, I get it.

03:32.500 --> 03:35.900
But after this, we started seeing calls to normalize random political shit.

03:35.900 --> 03:37.580
Things to normalize for men.

03:37.580 --> 03:41.420
Asking for help, being feminine, going to therapy, encouraging them to talk, seeking

03:41.420 --> 03:43.740
help for mental health, crying or showing emotions.

03:43.740 --> 03:44.900
I get it, I get it.

03:44.900 --> 03:47.100
Men's mental health is in the shitter right now.

03:47.100 --> 03:49.600
And some of this advice might help in some scenarios.

03:49.600 --> 03:53.180
But there's absolutely a type of woman out there who will immediately and permanently

03:53.180 --> 03:55.260
friend zone you if you do any of this shit.

03:55.260 --> 03:57.320
Yeah, those women are terrible and you shouldn't fuck with them.

03:57.320 --> 03:58.320
But you know what?

03:58.320 --> 04:02.460
Despite all of this being kind of true, there's also still a lot of value in stoicism.

04:02.460 --> 04:03.700
Things to normalize.

04:03.700 --> 04:08.340
Same sex relationships, female masturbation, non-binary pronouns, public breastfeeding,

04:08.340 --> 04:12.700
androgynous fashion, not wearing a bra, women in positions of power, guys showing emotions.

04:12.700 --> 04:15.700
This is just your random feminist grab bag of positions.

04:15.700 --> 04:16.960
Most of them have already been normalized.

04:16.960 --> 04:18.520
And the remaining ones are just kind of dumb.

04:18.520 --> 04:22.720
But this really does reinforce the notion that saying normalize X is just a slightly

04:22.720 --> 04:25.320
more academic way of saying I want X.

04:25.320 --> 04:27.520
It ain't just Twitter, this is seeping into journalism too.

04:27.520 --> 04:31.240
Like normalizing conversations about periods at the breakfast table with a uterus shaped

04:31.240 --> 04:32.240
cereal.

04:32.240 --> 04:33.360
Why in the fuck would you ever want to do that?

04:33.360 --> 04:37.120
Or the extremely grotesque, we need to normalize abortion, which is probably the most blatant

04:37.120 --> 04:41.240
example of somebody trying to engineer what the norm is for their own selfish benefit.

04:41.240 --> 04:45.640
There's a round of famous posts where the target being normalized is repeated over and

04:45.640 --> 04:49.040
over, as if saying it many times will make it come true like it's a magic spell.

04:49.040 --> 04:53.160
Like normalize sexist relationships, normalize dating sex workers, going from one extreme

04:53.160 --> 04:54.440
to the other there.

04:54.440 --> 04:58.160
Normalize incest, the front page of PornHub shows us we've been there for years, dude.

04:58.160 --> 05:00.440
Normalize pigging is, uh, this one a joke?

05:00.440 --> 05:01.440
I can't tell.

05:01.440 --> 05:04.440
Reminds me of the dude who engaged in a very similar meme from like a decade ago, I need

05:04.440 --> 05:08.640
feminism because, where he's cited enjoying his girlfriend's strap-on.

05:08.640 --> 05:12.440
The point of all of these is that these are all things that are not normal, and the person

05:12.440 --> 05:16.360
making the post believes they should be, likely for some political or social end.

05:16.360 --> 05:20.520
But this rapidly turned into a very common joke, meant to make fun of these types of

05:20.520 --> 05:21.520
activists.

05:21.520 --> 05:23.860
Like, for example, normalize shitting in the shower.

05:23.860 --> 05:26.200
Normalize singing sea shanties in pubs.

05:26.200 --> 05:28.040
Normalize using XD again.

05:28.040 --> 05:30.960
Normalize leaving after the first red flag, I won't but y'all should.

05:30.960 --> 05:35.600
And then there's the very famous one, normalize platonically telling your bros they look submissive

05:35.600 --> 05:39.500
and breedable, which actually spawned the submissive and breedable meme, as well as

05:39.500 --> 05:43.840
utilizing both the normalize meme and the hand clap emoji between every word meme.

05:43.840 --> 05:45.740
The meme density is high on this one.

05:45.740 --> 05:49.140
Everyone got tired of this whole thing pretty quickly, with people starting to say normalize

05:49.140 --> 05:52.280
shutting the fuck up, or normalize not saying normalize.

05:52.280 --> 05:55.500
We all know what's going on here, it's just a newer, slightly more academic way to

05:55.500 --> 05:57.580
talk about your desired political and social change.

05:57.580 --> 06:01.340
You still see people using the term unironically sometimes in that initial progressive way,

06:01.340 --> 06:04.500
but for the most part nowadays it's just considered a tired joke that pops up every

06:04.500 --> 06:06.580
once in a while, and nobody blinks an eye at it.

06:06.580 --> 06:08.700
In fact, you could say it's become pretty normalized.

06:08.700 --> 06:12.340
Here's a pretty common meme that cuts to the heart of what's going on here.

06:12.340 --> 06:15.900
Listen here, partner, if something has to be normalized, then it ain't normal.

06:15.900 --> 06:20.060
The caption implies that the things that are truly normal are just naturally normal, or

06:20.060 --> 06:24.620
they were normalized not through the activism of a specific political class at one specific

06:24.620 --> 06:28.860
moment in history, but instead by standing the test of time and becoming a tradition.

06:28.860 --> 06:31.580
This combined with the fact that the meme depicts a cowboy, even though he's also

06:31.580 --> 06:35.540
a dog, implies that you should just know what the normal is through simple intuition.

06:35.540 --> 06:39.740
It doesn't need to be academically calculated, or explained, or somehow created, you just

06:39.740 --> 06:40.740
know it when you feel it.

06:40.740 --> 06:43.140
I don't completely agree with this, but I don't disagree either.

06:43.140 --> 06:46.220
You can sort of see this play out when you take a look at what progressives demand that

06:46.220 --> 06:47.600
you don't normalize.

06:47.600 --> 06:50.300
Check out this braindead take from Thought Slime.

06:50.300 --> 06:55.060
Attempts at recuperating Nazi memes seems to often have the effect of normalizing those

06:55.060 --> 06:58.020
memes because now when people see them they aren't instantly repulsed.

06:58.020 --> 07:02.380
It's even worse when the meme format is premised on Nazi ideology, and only the surface

07:02.380 --> 07:03.500
logic has changed.

07:03.500 --> 07:10.940
Like the square jawed yes guy with the chinless drooling guy.

07:10.940 --> 07:12.940
That meme is inherently ableist.

07:12.940 --> 07:17.000
Trying to make the drooling guy Richard Spencer and the buff guy Antifa or whatever doesn't

07:17.000 --> 07:18.000
change that.

07:18.000 --> 07:20.340
It just lets the ableism ooze into leftist messaging.

07:20.340 --> 07:24.900
Okay, uh, if your followers can't tell what's going on here Thought Slime, that might actually

07:24.900 --> 07:27.660
be about their average IQ, not the use of the memes.

07:27.660 --> 07:29.220
But look at what he's saying here.

07:29.220 --> 07:32.420
Memes that the far right use, or whatever this guy considers to be far right, which

07:32.420 --> 07:35.460
is probably everything not part of his specific political circle.

07:35.460 --> 07:40.740
These memes are so inherently far right, that even when non-far right people use them, they're

07:40.740 --> 07:42.700
normalizing far right ideas.

07:42.700 --> 07:47.060
Even if the content of the meme is changed to show Antifa to be the chad and the Nazis

07:47.060 --> 07:52.060
to be drooling wojaks, the framing itself was originally far right, therefore all uses

07:52.060 --> 07:53.540
of it are also far right.

07:53.540 --> 07:57.020
In a video many years ago, I forget which one, it was in the early Trump era I think,

07:57.020 --> 07:59.940
I described this as being like the Midas touch.

07:59.940 --> 08:02.820
Everything a far right meme touches turns far right.

08:02.820 --> 08:04.740
And he's not the only person who thinks this.

08:04.740 --> 08:06.620
It's a pretty common thing to go on about.

08:06.620 --> 08:07.620
Like this here.

08:07.620 --> 08:09.700
Stop memeing about the trad girl wojak.

08:09.700 --> 08:14.060
It is literally based on white supremacist ideals of femininity, and by trying to subvert

08:14.060 --> 08:16.420
it, you're actually making an alt-right meme relatable.

08:16.420 --> 08:20.420
No, I'm not reading another insufferably long twitter thread on this.

08:20.420 --> 08:21.420
That right there will do.

08:21.420 --> 08:25.800
Or how about this person, who wants a little girl beaten for normalizing Nazism because

08:25.800 --> 08:27.060
she likes to draw Pepe.

08:27.060 --> 08:32.300
The logic here is the same logic behind not showing swastikas in a historically accurate

08:32.300 --> 08:36.420
manner, or censoring old works with language considered okay back then but offensive now.

08:36.420 --> 08:39.640
They're thinking that if the current generation has this normalized for them, they'll start

08:39.640 --> 08:40.860
to believe it's okay.

08:40.860 --> 08:45.540
You flip that logic around, and you've now got explanation as to why they demand, say,

08:45.540 --> 08:48.660
black representation in stories where it doesn't make any historical sense, or make sense in

08:48.660 --> 08:49.660
the lore.

08:49.660 --> 08:54.700
To them, normalization, or preventing normalization, is more important than the integrity and accuracy

08:54.700 --> 08:55.700
of the art.

08:55.700 --> 08:57.140
As always, watch my Gramsci video.

08:57.140 --> 09:00.260
The issue is, even by the standard of the pursuit of their own goals, they're still

09:00.260 --> 09:01.260
wrong.

09:01.260 --> 09:04.540
If you change the alt-right meme to not be the exclusive domain of the alt-right, which

09:04.540 --> 09:07.980
did eventually happen to good ol' Pepe even in the minds of the left, you strip it of

09:07.980 --> 09:09.160
its alt-right power.

09:09.160 --> 09:12.760
If a normie looks at Pepe, they're not being transformed into a neo-nazi or whatever, they

09:12.760 --> 09:16.260
see a funny frog, and they laugh about it, and Pepe's status as a symbol representing

09:16.260 --> 09:17.680
the alt-right weakens.

09:17.680 --> 09:22.160
If you want to defeat your enemies, then at least part of what you do is take their symbols.

09:22.160 --> 09:25.060
But if you want to keep the spectre of your enemies around, so that you can virtue signal

09:25.060 --> 09:28.180
about yourself and then use them to draw up support, well, in that case, I can see

09:28.180 --> 09:30.540
why you'd object to taking them down through mockery.

09:30.540 --> 09:34.840
The common leftist objection to the message in that it ain't normal meme is that nothing

09:34.840 --> 09:36.740
is actually normal naturally.

09:36.740 --> 09:39.700
Everything is imposed by the dominant politics of the era.

09:39.700 --> 09:41.300
Check out how this message is worded.

09:41.300 --> 09:45.900
Cisgender heterosexual representation in society is so normalized you don't even recognize

09:45.900 --> 09:46.900
it.

09:46.900 --> 09:50.040
If we inject some color into our otherwise black and white society, you feel like it's

09:50.040 --> 09:51.040
all you can see.

09:51.040 --> 09:53.020
Don't worry, it won't make you gay or trans or kids.

09:53.020 --> 09:54.420
There's a lot of problems here.

09:54.420 --> 09:58.860
But for our purposes today, the assumption being made is that being cisgender and heterosexual

09:58.860 --> 10:00.940
isn't normal, but normalized.

10:00.940 --> 10:05.260
It's not the natural state of humanity, it's imposed by our current politics.

10:05.260 --> 10:09.300
And that, presumably, it's possible for a different world to exist, where a different

10:09.300 --> 10:13.820
politics and culture imposes being transgender and homosexual instead.

10:13.820 --> 10:17.720
In other words, most people are straight and cis instead of gay and trans, not because

10:17.720 --> 10:20.100
of their nature, but because of our culture.

10:20.100 --> 10:24.540
Yes, this completely destroys the moral underpinning of the born-that-way narrative that pushed

10:24.540 --> 10:26.640
for gay marriage back in the 2000s.

10:26.640 --> 10:29.520
But these people either don't understand that or just don't care.

10:29.520 --> 10:33.900
When somebody says that they want to normalize a thing, they're relying on a purely social

10:33.900 --> 10:35.820
constructivist view of the human condition.

10:35.820 --> 10:39.580
That with enough planning, knowledge, and power, the things that conservatives call

10:39.580 --> 10:41.660
human nature can be changed.

10:41.660 --> 10:43.600
Of course, in the real world, that's not how things work.

10:43.600 --> 10:46.060
Not until we develop perfect gene editing or something like that.

10:46.060 --> 10:50.460
The final point on this topic is that the term normal is often used with this undue

10:50.460 --> 10:51.460
moral weight.

10:51.460 --> 10:55.580
It simply means conforming to a standard, usual, typical, expected, without a moral

10:55.580 --> 10:56.580
weight attached.

10:56.580 --> 11:01.300
The assumption of this moral weight, in recent times, is derived from the definition of abnormal.

11:01.300 --> 11:06.160
Often, abnormal does come with a moral weight, deviating from what is normal or usual, typically

11:06.160 --> 11:08.560
in a way that is undesirable or worrying.

11:08.560 --> 11:13.080
The logic is, if the moral weight of abnormal is bad, then the moral weight of normal must

11:13.080 --> 11:14.080
be good.

11:14.100 --> 11:17.560
Therefore, if we normalize something that the dominant culture considers abnormal, we

11:17.560 --> 11:19.960
are also granting it a positive moral weight.

11:19.960 --> 11:24.920
In other words, if we normalize being trans, we make being trans a moral act.

11:24.920 --> 11:28.260
And as long as being trans remains abnormal, it is immoral.

11:28.260 --> 11:29.400
This logic doesn't sit right with me.

11:29.400 --> 11:33.100
And I think it's because as an edgelord millennial who doesn't suffer from trolls' remorse,

11:33.100 --> 11:35.560
being abnormal was actually the goal when I was younger.

11:35.560 --> 11:39.200
The outsiders of my generation, whether that was the nerds or the stoners or the punks,

11:39.200 --> 11:42.320
didn't try to make what we were the normal thing, the dominant culture.

11:42.320 --> 11:43.600
We knew that would ruin it.

11:43.600 --> 11:45.720
We knew the normies would come in and fuck it up.

11:45.720 --> 11:47.560
We didn't want to normalize our differences.

11:47.560 --> 11:49.200
We reveled in being abnormal.

11:49.200 --> 11:52.820
I've done several videos now on the whole conservatism is the counterculture idea.

11:52.820 --> 11:56.640
And what I'm talking about now really seems to resonate with what's going on over there.

11:56.640 --> 12:01.280
The punks of nowadays are parroting progressive orthodoxy, same as most governments and institutions

12:01.280 --> 12:02.280
out there.

12:02.280 --> 12:04.140
So definitionally, they can't be the outsider.

12:04.140 --> 12:05.460
They can't be the abnormal.

12:05.460 --> 12:07.800
If they ever once were, they've since been normalized.

12:07.800 --> 12:10.320
But frankly, it was just better before.

12:10.320 --> 12:12.000
Milo might be a nutjob now.

12:12.000 --> 12:16.200
Before he drove himself off the conversion therapy, Copium cliff, he made an offhand

12:16.200 --> 12:19.960
joke that gay sex was a lot more fun when it was taboo.

12:19.960 --> 12:23.320
And now that everybody's doing it and accepts it, it's just kind of boring.

12:23.320 --> 12:26.720
There is something to that, you know, when you normalize the abnormal, yeah, you end

12:26.720 --> 12:30.500
up bringing people on the fringes into the center, but you also lose everything fun about

12:30.500 --> 12:37.320
being fringe, esoteric knowledge, closed communities, gate kept fandoms, secretly violated taboos.

12:37.320 --> 12:39.360
These things are fun to engage in.

12:39.400 --> 12:41.760
They're actually edgy, not just safe edgy.

12:41.760 --> 12:46.320
Meanwhile, universalized knowledge, inclusive communities, open fandoms, normalization of

12:46.320 --> 12:48.000
the taboo, this is all just lame.

12:48.000 --> 12:51.680
I know that one chick talked about adding color to our black and white world, but it's

12:51.680 --> 12:52.680
actually the opposite.

12:52.680 --> 12:55.040
You're turning those colorful parts into black and white.

12:55.040 --> 12:58.400
The best example that I can think of for this effect is the word queer.

12:58.400 --> 13:03.380
If you read any old literature, you'll know that for a long, long time, queer meant strange

13:03.380 --> 13:04.380
or odd.

13:04.380 --> 13:09.160
In the early 20th century, queer came to refer to people with a strange or odd sexuality,

13:09.160 --> 13:11.720
aka gay or trans people, and it was used as a slur.

13:11.720 --> 13:14.960
It has since been reclaimed by the LGBTQ plus movement.

13:14.960 --> 13:15.960
See, it's right there.

13:15.960 --> 13:16.960
It's the Q.

13:16.960 --> 13:18.960
But what does queer mean to progressives nowadays?

13:18.960 --> 13:23.760
Well, sometimes it simply means being gay or being trans, but that meaning is rapidly

13:23.760 --> 13:25.140
falling out of usage.

13:25.140 --> 13:26.820
Most gay people just call themselves gay.

13:26.820 --> 13:28.240
Most trans people just call themselves trans.

13:28.240 --> 13:33.060
I mentioned in my link as a twink video that there was this concept of the trans umbrella,

13:33.060 --> 13:38.080
that trans activists are now claiming any type of gender nonconformity as being nonbinary

13:38.080 --> 13:40.280
or genderqueer and therefore they're trans.

13:40.280 --> 13:44.800
So tomboys are trans, not because they experience dysphoria or they transition, despite the

13:44.800 --> 13:49.360
attempts of the egg hatchers sometimes, but because their gender presentation is non-traditional

13:49.360 --> 13:53.220
and therefore they're not just tomboys, they're nonbinary and therefore they're trans and

13:53.220 --> 13:55.480
therefore they're part of being LGBTQ.

13:55.480 --> 13:59.120
This is retarded logic, but it is becoming more and more common.

13:59.120 --> 14:03.680
Allow me to introduce you to its equally retarded brother, queer heterosexuality.

14:03.680 --> 14:08.640
It's very easy to find articles and blog posts all over usual lefty spaces talking

14:08.640 --> 14:10.600
about this concept, but here's the TLDR.

14:10.600 --> 14:14.800
In queer political theory, there's this concept of the rehabilitated heterosexual,

14:14.800 --> 14:19.420
the straight person who, while still being attracted to the opposite sex, does not uphold

14:19.420 --> 14:24.280
cis-normative heteropatriarchy through his presentations, actions, or political affiliations.

14:24.280 --> 14:28.680
These people are cis and straight, but nonetheless have non-traditional gender expressions and

14:28.680 --> 14:30.500
adopt alternate gender roles.

14:30.500 --> 14:34.820
In other words, it's the final stop on demon mama's gender is just an aesthetic logic

14:34.820 --> 14:38.660
extended to all of sex, gender, sexuality, and identity.

14:38.660 --> 14:47.540
Gender is a category of self-identification that means what you want it to mean.

14:47.540 --> 14:55.180
And it means what you engage, it refers to how you engage socially and how you assert

14:55.180 --> 14:56.720
your own identity.

14:56.720 --> 15:01.880
So yeah, it is fair to say that gender is essentially an aesthetic.

15:01.880 --> 15:04.960
We've seen bi lesbians and straight lesbians before.

15:04.960 --> 15:08.520
If you can identify as anything you want, why can't you identify as a queer straight?

15:08.520 --> 15:11.080
Here's an excellent practical example of what I'm talking about.

15:11.080 --> 15:15.080
I mentioned recently on the Archcast that there's a Linus Tech Tips series where Linus

15:15.080 --> 15:19.640
gets $5,000 from AMD to build the ultimate PC for one of his employees.

15:19.640 --> 15:23.000
The videos involve getting to know one of the employees who is usually behind the camera,

15:23.000 --> 15:25.840
seeing their home, talking to their spouses, while building the PC.

15:25.840 --> 15:29.320
And in one of these videos, this guy's girlfriend proclaims that she's queer as

15:29.320 --> 15:30.320
fuck.

15:30.320 --> 15:31.320
What does that mean?

15:31.320 --> 15:32.320
She doesn't appear to be trans.

15:32.320 --> 15:33.860
Yeah, I know you can't know 100%, but I'm pretty sure.

15:33.860 --> 15:35.440
And she is in a straight relationship.

15:35.440 --> 15:36.640
Does that mean that she's bisexual?

15:36.640 --> 15:39.140
Why not just say she's bi as fuck?

15:39.140 --> 15:42.720
Is it because she's got the big glasses and the curly hairstyle and the bright yellow

15:42.720 --> 15:47.580
garish overalls and probably a closet full of hoop earrings and flannel shirts and other

15:47.580 --> 15:49.320
queer fashion aesthetics?

15:49.320 --> 15:51.240
That's how this entire segment comes off to me.

15:51.240 --> 15:56.120
If gender is simply an aesthetic, as Demon Momma claims, then queerness is also just

15:56.120 --> 15:57.120
an aesthetic.

15:57.120 --> 16:01.160
And if queerness is just an aesthetic, then straight cis people can wear the aesthetic

16:01.160 --> 16:06.720
and claim all of the moral righteousness of being a part of the LGBTQ plus movement.

16:06.720 --> 16:08.040
That is what normalization is.

16:08.040 --> 16:09.040
That's what it does.

16:09.040 --> 16:14.260
We have normalized being LGBTQ to the point that straight people are ironically queer,

16:14.260 --> 16:17.880
as long as they believe in the correct things and present themselves in the correct manner.

16:17.880 --> 16:21.660
Again, this flies in the face of previous waves of gay and trans activism, which were

16:21.660 --> 16:23.160
interested in assimilation.

16:23.160 --> 16:26.040
One day, I am truly going to have to do that queer theory video.

16:26.040 --> 16:30.080
But for now, the point is, the end result of the normalizing process is the destruction

16:30.080 --> 16:34.920
of everything unique about a thing and its reduction to only its surface level components.

16:34.920 --> 16:38.820
I'm not saying that I want to go back to an era where gays were being persecuted or something.

16:38.820 --> 16:41.560
If you want that, then I've got some real estate in the Middle East to sell you.

16:41.560 --> 16:46.020
I'm saying that normalization destroys all of the good things about being not normal.

16:46.020 --> 16:47.020
The fun.

16:47.020 --> 16:48.020
The edginess.

16:48.020 --> 16:49.020
The sense of community.

16:49.020 --> 16:50.020
The sense of specialty.

16:50.020 --> 16:54.780
The value of these things is in their particularity, and the universalization of progressivism

16:54.780 --> 16:56.540
is anathema to the particular.
