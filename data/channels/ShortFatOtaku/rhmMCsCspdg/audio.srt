00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,780
Today is the day where I do a fun little video about a tiny drop of internet nonsense, like

2
00:00:10,780 --> 00:00:16,000
my previous video about how progressives pushed the super inclusive term Latinx to the point

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,400
of making the Latino community absolutely hate progressivism, or about how the easily

4
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:24,600
triggered tend to use the star symbol to censor words on Twitter.

5
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:28,840
Not just slurs or swears, and remember kids, you can say the word fuck online, but going

6
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:33,500
so far as to censor people's names so that their public statements are harder to be discovered

7
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:34,600
outside of their friend group.

8
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:36,840
Yep, this is a silly little video like that.

9
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:37,840
Why?

10
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:42,240
Well, the main reason is because I'm currently juggling like four scripts in various stages

11
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:45,800
of completion, each of which are at least an hour long and involve tons of editing,

12
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:50,360
and I still want to at least try and stay on my one video a day streak, so today is

13
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:51,360
just going to have to be a gimme.

14
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,000
It's okay though, we'll still have some fun.

15
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,400
Here's another bit of terminology that terminally online progressive Twitter culture warriors

16
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:01,200
tend to regularly deploy, the word normalize.

17
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:05,360
Whenever you see this shit in a tweet, you know you're reading some garbage dumb fuck

18
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:06,360
nonsense.

19
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:07,960
Normalize is a pretty simple word.

20
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:11,520
Even if I don't give you the official definition, you probably understand, but it means bring

21
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:15,480
or return to a normal or standard condition or state.

22
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:20,760
So as a quick example, the normal internal human body temperature is 37 degrees Celsius.

23
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:22,900
That's 98.6 in freedom units.

24
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:25,500
If you have a fever, you're likely to be several degrees higher.

25
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:30,360
When your fever breaks and you return to normal, that is your fever normalizing.

26
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:34,180
Normalization is the process of taking an abnormal value and returning it to baseline.

27
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:36,840
However, that's not how progressives use the word.

28
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:41,280
When a progressive says normalization, they're describing the process of taking an abnormal

29
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,880
value and making it the new baseline.

30
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:50,240
For example, being trans is pretty rare, ranging from 0.1% to 0.6% of the world population.

31
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:53,660
The normal value of gender identity is being cis.

32
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:58,580
If we were to use normalize per the dictionary definition, the phrase normalize transness

33
00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:02,840
means literally to make trans people cis, which is not what progressives want.

34
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:07,260
When they're saying normalize transness, they mean to say that being trans should be

35
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:08,360
considered normal.

36
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:12,820
It should be the default, the baseline, and we should work to make that situation a reality.

37
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:16,960
In some ways, to normalize something literally means to make it the new normal.

38
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:21,780
When progressives say this, most of them mean that both transness and cisness should be

39
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:22,780
the baseline.

40
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:28,380
But few radicals do genuinely mean to make transness the only baseline and push cisness

41
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:29,440
to be the outlier.

42
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:32,540
The terminology they often use in this case is centering.

43
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:34,900
There can only be one center of a circle.

44
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:36,860
Everything else is necessarily periphery.

45
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:41,220
So when you center transness, you are necessarily othering cisness.

46
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:45,380
It's for this reason that, as a general rule, people who tell me that I have a moral obligation

47
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:49,460
to center something that isn't already central, I tend to just outright ignore them because

48
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:53,060
they're simply trying to browbeat me into servicing their politics.

49
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:58,500
But most progressives who use the term normalization don't actually intend to displace the default

50
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:00,460
with the beneficiaries of their activism.

51
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:04,300
They simply want the default to be expanded in order to include them.

52
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:07,260
Whether or not that's actually possible is a different story that is heavily dependent

53
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:08,820
on what exactly we're talking about.

54
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:13,640
The first time the word normalize was ever used in this manner, as in, to describe some

55
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:19,140
sort of social change the speaker deemed necessary, was in 2019, when this fella said, normalize

56
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:20,380
apologizing to children.

57
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:21,940
Okay, this doesn't seem too crazy.

58
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:25,580
We've all known instances where an adult was mistaken, their kid was correct, and when

59
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:29,020
the truth came out, the adult didn't apologize in order to maintain authority.

60
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:31,500
And to be honest, that's pretty shitty to be on the other end of.

61
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:32,500
So okay, I get it.

62
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:35,900
But after this, we started seeing calls to normalize random political shit.

63
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:37,580
Things to normalize for men.

64
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:41,420
Asking for help, being feminine, going to therapy, encouraging them to talk, seeking

65
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:43,740
help for mental health, crying or showing emotions.

66
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:44,900
I get it, I get it.

67
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:47,100
Men's mental health is in the shitter right now.

68
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:49,600
And some of this advice might help in some scenarios.

69
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:53,180
But there's absolutely a type of woman out there who will immediately and permanently

70
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:55,260
friend zone you if you do any of this shit.

71
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:57,320
Yeah, those women are terrible and you shouldn't fuck with them.

72
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,320
But you know what?

73
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:02,460
Despite all of this being kind of true, there's also still a lot of value in stoicism.

74
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:03,700
Things to normalize.

75
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:08,340
Same sex relationships, female masturbation, non-binary pronouns, public breastfeeding,

76
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:12,700
androgynous fashion, not wearing a bra, women in positions of power, guys showing emotions.

77
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:15,700
This is just your random feminist grab bag of positions.

78
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:16,960
Most of them have already been normalized.

79
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:18,520
And the remaining ones are just kind of dumb.

80
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:22,720
But this really does reinforce the notion that saying normalize X is just a slightly

81
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,320
more academic way of saying I want X.

82
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:27,520
It ain't just Twitter, this is seeping into journalism too.

83
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:31,240
Like normalizing conversations about periods at the breakfast table with a uterus shaped

84
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:32,240
cereal.

85
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,360
Why in the fuck would you ever want to do that?

86
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:37,120
Or the extremely grotesque, we need to normalize abortion, which is probably the most blatant

87
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:41,240
example of somebody trying to engineer what the norm is for their own selfish benefit.

88
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:45,640
There's a round of famous posts where the target being normalized is repeated over and

89
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:49,040
over, as if saying it many times will make it come true like it's a magic spell.

90
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:53,160
Like normalize sexist relationships, normalize dating sex workers, going from one extreme

91
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,440
to the other there.

92
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:58,160
Normalize incest, the front page of PornHub shows us we've been there for years, dude.

93
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,440
Normalize pigging is, uh, this one a joke?

94
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:01,440
I can't tell.

95
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:04,440
Reminds me of the dude who engaged in a very similar meme from like a decade ago, I need

96
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:08,640
feminism because, where he's cited enjoying his girlfriend's strap-on.

97
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:12,440
The point of all of these is that these are all things that are not normal, and the person

98
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:16,360
making the post believes they should be, likely for some political or social end.

99
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:20,520
But this rapidly turned into a very common joke, meant to make fun of these types of

100
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:21,520
activists.

101
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,860
Like, for example, normalize shitting in the shower.

102
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:26,200
Normalize singing sea shanties in pubs.

103
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:28,040
Normalize using XD again.

104
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:30,960
Normalize leaving after the first red flag, I won't but y'all should.

105
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:35,600
And then there's the very famous one, normalize platonically telling your bros they look submissive

106
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:39,500
and breedable, which actually spawned the submissive and breedable meme, as well as

107
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:43,840
utilizing both the normalize meme and the hand clap emoji between every word meme.

108
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,740
The meme density is high on this one.

109
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:49,140
Everyone got tired of this whole thing pretty quickly, with people starting to say normalize

110
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:52,280
shutting the fuck up, or normalize not saying normalize.

111
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:55,500
We all know what's going on here, it's just a newer, slightly more academic way to

112
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:57,580
talk about your desired political and social change.

113
00:05:57,580 --> 00:06:01,340
You still see people using the term unironically sometimes in that initial progressive way,

114
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:04,500
but for the most part nowadays it's just considered a tired joke that pops up every

115
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:06,580
once in a while, and nobody blinks an eye at it.

116
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:08,700
In fact, you could say it's become pretty normalized.

117
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:12,340
Here's a pretty common meme that cuts to the heart of what's going on here.

118
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:15,900
Listen here, partner, if something has to be normalized, then it ain't normal.

119
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:20,060
The caption implies that the things that are truly normal are just naturally normal, or

120
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:24,620
they were normalized not through the activism of a specific political class at one specific

121
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:28,860
moment in history, but instead by standing the test of time and becoming a tradition.

122
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:31,580
This combined with the fact that the meme depicts a cowboy, even though he's also

123
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:35,540
a dog, implies that you should just know what the normal is through simple intuition.

124
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:39,740
It doesn't need to be academically calculated, or explained, or somehow created, you just

125
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:40,740
know it when you feel it.

126
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:43,140
I don't completely agree with this, but I don't disagree either.

127
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:46,220
You can sort of see this play out when you take a look at what progressives demand that

128
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:47,600
you don't normalize.

129
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:50,300
Check out this braindead take from Thought Slime.

130
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:55,060
Attempts at recuperating Nazi memes seems to often have the effect of normalizing those

131
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:58,020
memes because now when people see them they aren't instantly repulsed.

132
00:06:58,020 --> 00:07:02,380
It's even worse when the meme format is premised on Nazi ideology, and only the surface

133
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:03,500
logic has changed.

134
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:10,940
Like the square jawed yes guy with the chinless drooling guy.

135
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:12,940
That meme is inherently ableist.

136
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:17,000
Trying to make the drooling guy Richard Spencer and the buff guy Antifa or whatever doesn't

137
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
change that.

138
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,340
It just lets the ableism ooze into leftist messaging.

139
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:24,900
Okay, uh, if your followers can't tell what's going on here Thought Slime, that might actually

140
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:27,660
be about their average IQ, not the use of the memes.

141
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:29,220
But look at what he's saying here.

142
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:32,420
Memes that the far right use, or whatever this guy considers to be far right, which

143
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:35,460
is probably everything not part of his specific political circle.

144
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:40,740
These memes are so inherently far right, that even when non-far right people use them, they're

145
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:42,700
normalizing far right ideas.

146
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:47,060
Even if the content of the meme is changed to show Antifa to be the chad and the Nazis

147
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:52,060
to be drooling wojaks, the framing itself was originally far right, therefore all uses

148
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:53,540
of it are also far right.

149
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:57,020
In a video many years ago, I forget which one, it was in the early Trump era I think,

150
00:07:57,020 --> 00:07:59,940
I described this as being like the Midas touch.

151
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:02,820
Everything a far right meme touches turns far right.

152
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:04,740
And he's not the only person who thinks this.

153
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:06,620
It's a pretty common thing to go on about.

154
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:07,620
Like this here.

155
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:09,700
Stop memeing about the trad girl wojak.

156
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:14,060
It is literally based on white supremacist ideals of femininity, and by trying to subvert

157
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:16,420
it, you're actually making an alt-right meme relatable.

158
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:20,420
No, I'm not reading another insufferably long twitter thread on this.

159
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:21,420
That right there will do.

160
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:25,800
Or how about this person, who wants a little girl beaten for normalizing Nazism because

161
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,060
she likes to draw Pepe.

162
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:32,300
The logic here is the same logic behind not showing swastikas in a historically accurate

163
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:36,420
manner, or censoring old works with language considered okay back then but offensive now.

164
00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:39,640
They're thinking that if the current generation has this normalized for them, they'll start

165
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:40,860
to believe it's okay.

166
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:45,540
You flip that logic around, and you've now got explanation as to why they demand, say,

167
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:48,660
black representation in stories where it doesn't make any historical sense, or make sense in

168
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:49,660
the lore.

169
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:54,700
To them, normalization, or preventing normalization, is more important than the integrity and accuracy

170
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:55,700
of the art.

171
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:57,140
As always, watch my Gramsci video.

172
00:08:57,140 --> 00:09:00,260
The issue is, even by the standard of the pursuit of their own goals, they're still

173
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:01,260
wrong.

174
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:04,540
If you change the alt-right meme to not be the exclusive domain of the alt-right, which

175
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:07,980
did eventually happen to good ol' Pepe even in the minds of the left, you strip it of

176
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:09,160
its alt-right power.

177
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:12,760
If a normie looks at Pepe, they're not being transformed into a neo-nazi or whatever, they

178
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:16,260
see a funny frog, and they laugh about it, and Pepe's status as a symbol representing

179
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:17,680
the alt-right weakens.

180
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:22,160
If you want to defeat your enemies, then at least part of what you do is take their symbols.

181
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:25,060
But if you want to keep the spectre of your enemies around, so that you can virtue signal

182
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:28,180
about yourself and then use them to draw up support, well, in that case, I can see

183
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:30,540
why you'd object to taking them down through mockery.

184
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:34,840
The common leftist objection to the message in that it ain't normal meme is that nothing

185
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,740
is actually normal naturally.

186
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:39,700
Everything is imposed by the dominant politics of the era.

187
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:41,300
Check out how this message is worded.

188
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:45,900
Cisgender heterosexual representation in society is so normalized you don't even recognize

189
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:46,900
it.

190
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:50,040
If we inject some color into our otherwise black and white society, you feel like it's

191
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:51,040
all you can see.

192
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:53,020
Don't worry, it won't make you gay or trans or kids.

193
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:54,420
There's a lot of problems here.

194
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:58,860
But for our purposes today, the assumption being made is that being cisgender and heterosexual

195
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:00,940
isn't normal, but normalized.

196
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:05,260
It's not the natural state of humanity, it's imposed by our current politics.

197
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:09,300
And that, presumably, it's possible for a different world to exist, where a different

198
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:13,820
politics and culture imposes being transgender and homosexual instead.

199
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:17,720
In other words, most people are straight and cis instead of gay and trans, not because

200
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:20,100
of their nature, but because of our culture.

201
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:24,540
Yes, this completely destroys the moral underpinning of the born-that-way narrative that pushed

202
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:26,640
for gay marriage back in the 2000s.

203
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:29,520
But these people either don't understand that or just don't care.

204
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:33,900
When somebody says that they want to normalize a thing, they're relying on a purely social

205
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:35,820
constructivist view of the human condition.

206
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:39,580
That with enough planning, knowledge, and power, the things that conservatives call

207
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:41,660
human nature can be changed.

208
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:43,600
Of course, in the real world, that's not how things work.

209
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:46,060
Not until we develop perfect gene editing or something like that.

210
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:50,460
The final point on this topic is that the term normal is often used with this undue

211
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:51,460
moral weight.

212
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:55,580
It simply means conforming to a standard, usual, typical, expected, without a moral

213
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:56,580
weight attached.

214
00:10:56,580 --> 00:11:01,300
The assumption of this moral weight, in recent times, is derived from the definition of abnormal.

215
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:06,160
Often, abnormal does come with a moral weight, deviating from what is normal or usual, typically

216
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,560
in a way that is undesirable or worrying.

217
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:13,080
The logic is, if the moral weight of abnormal is bad, then the moral weight of normal must

218
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,080
be good.

219
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:17,560
Therefore, if we normalize something that the dominant culture considers abnormal, we

220
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:19,960
are also granting it a positive moral weight.

221
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:24,920
In other words, if we normalize being trans, we make being trans a moral act.

222
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:28,260
And as long as being trans remains abnormal, it is immoral.

223
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:29,400
This logic doesn't sit right with me.

224
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:33,100
And I think it's because as an edgelord millennial who doesn't suffer from trolls' remorse,

225
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:35,560
being abnormal was actually the goal when I was younger.

226
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:39,200
The outsiders of my generation, whether that was the nerds or the stoners or the punks,

227
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:42,320
didn't try to make what we were the normal thing, the dominant culture.

228
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,600
We knew that would ruin it.

229
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,720
We knew the normies would come in and fuck it up.

230
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:47,560
We didn't want to normalize our differences.

231
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:49,200
We reveled in being abnormal.

232
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:52,820
I've done several videos now on the whole conservatism is the counterculture idea.

233
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:56,640
And what I'm talking about now really seems to resonate with what's going on over there.

234
00:11:56,640 --> 00:12:01,280
The punks of nowadays are parroting progressive orthodoxy, same as most governments and institutions

235
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:02,280
out there.

236
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:04,140
So definitionally, they can't be the outsider.

237
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:05,460
They can't be the abnormal.

238
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:07,800
If they ever once were, they've since been normalized.

239
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:10,320
But frankly, it was just better before.

240
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:12,000
Milo might be a nutjob now.

241
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,200
Before he drove himself off the conversion therapy, Copium cliff, he made an offhand

242
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:19,960
joke that gay sex was a lot more fun when it was taboo.

243
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:23,320
And now that everybody's doing it and accepts it, it's just kind of boring.

244
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:26,720
There is something to that, you know, when you normalize the abnormal, yeah, you end

245
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:30,500
up bringing people on the fringes into the center, but you also lose everything fun about

246
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:37,320
being fringe, esoteric knowledge, closed communities, gate kept fandoms, secretly violated taboos.

247
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:39,360
These things are fun to engage in.

248
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:41,760
They're actually edgy, not just safe edgy.

249
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:46,320
Meanwhile, universalized knowledge, inclusive communities, open fandoms, normalization of

250
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,000
the taboo, this is all just lame.

251
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,680
I know that one chick talked about adding color to our black and white world, but it's

252
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:52,680
actually the opposite.

253
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:55,040
You're turning those colorful parts into black and white.

254
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:58,400
The best example that I can think of for this effect is the word queer.

255
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:03,380
If you read any old literature, you'll know that for a long, long time, queer meant strange

256
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:04,380
or odd.

257
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:09,160
In the early 20th century, queer came to refer to people with a strange or odd sexuality,

258
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:11,720
aka gay or trans people, and it was used as a slur.

259
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:14,960
It has since been reclaimed by the LGBTQ plus movement.

260
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:15,960
See, it's right there.

261
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:16,960
It's the Q.

262
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:18,960
But what does queer mean to progressives nowadays?

263
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:23,760
Well, sometimes it simply means being gay or being trans, but that meaning is rapidly

264
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,140
falling out of usage.

265
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:26,820
Most gay people just call themselves gay.

266
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:28,240
Most trans people just call themselves trans.

267
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:33,060
I mentioned in my link as a twink video that there was this concept of the trans umbrella,

268
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:38,080
that trans activists are now claiming any type of gender nonconformity as being nonbinary

269
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:40,280
or genderqueer and therefore they're trans.

270
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:44,800
So tomboys are trans, not because they experience dysphoria or they transition, despite the

271
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:49,360
attempts of the egg hatchers sometimes, but because their gender presentation is non-traditional

272
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:53,220
and therefore they're not just tomboys, they're nonbinary and therefore they're trans and

273
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:55,480
therefore they're part of being LGBTQ.

274
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:59,120
This is retarded logic, but it is becoming more and more common.

275
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:03,680
Allow me to introduce you to its equally retarded brother, queer heterosexuality.

276
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:08,640
It's very easy to find articles and blog posts all over usual lefty spaces talking

277
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:10,600
about this concept, but here's the TLDR.

278
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:14,800
In queer political theory, there's this concept of the rehabilitated heterosexual,

279
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:19,420
the straight person who, while still being attracted to the opposite sex, does not uphold

280
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:24,280
cis-normative heteropatriarchy through his presentations, actions, or political affiliations.

281
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:28,680
These people are cis and straight, but nonetheless have non-traditional gender expressions and

282
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:30,500
adopt alternate gender roles.

283
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:34,820
In other words, it's the final stop on demon mama's gender is just an aesthetic logic

284
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:38,660
extended to all of sex, gender, sexuality, and identity.

285
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:47,540
Gender is a category of self-identification that means what you want it to mean.

286
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:55,180
And it means what you engage, it refers to how you engage socially and how you assert

287
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:56,720
your own identity.

288
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:01,880
So yeah, it is fair to say that gender is essentially an aesthetic.

289
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:04,960
We've seen bi lesbians and straight lesbians before.

290
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:08,520
If you can identify as anything you want, why can't you identify as a queer straight?

291
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:11,080
Here's an excellent practical example of what I'm talking about.

292
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:15,080
I mentioned recently on the Archcast that there's a Linus Tech Tips series where Linus

293
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:19,640
gets $5,000 from AMD to build the ultimate PC for one of his employees.

294
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:23,000
The videos involve getting to know one of the employees who is usually behind the camera,

295
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,840
seeing their home, talking to their spouses, while building the PC.

296
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:29,320
And in one of these videos, this guy's girlfriend proclaims that she's queer as

297
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:30,320
fuck.

298
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,320
What does that mean?

299
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:32,320
She doesn't appear to be trans.

300
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,860
Yeah, I know you can't know 100%, but I'm pretty sure.

301
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:35,440
And she is in a straight relationship.

302
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:36,640
Does that mean that she's bisexual?

303
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:39,140
Why not just say she's bi as fuck?

304
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:42,720
Is it because she's got the big glasses and the curly hairstyle and the bright yellow

305
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:47,580
garish overalls and probably a closet full of hoop earrings and flannel shirts and other

306
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:49,320
queer fashion aesthetics?

307
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:51,240
That's how this entire segment comes off to me.

308
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:56,120
If gender is simply an aesthetic, as Demon Momma claims, then queerness is also just

309
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:57,120
an aesthetic.

310
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:01,160
And if queerness is just an aesthetic, then straight cis people can wear the aesthetic

311
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:06,720
and claim all of the moral righteousness of being a part of the LGBTQ plus movement.

312
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,040
That is what normalization is.

313
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:09,040
That's what it does.

314
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:14,260
We have normalized being LGBTQ to the point that straight people are ironically queer,

315
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:17,880
as long as they believe in the correct things and present themselves in the correct manner.

316
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:21,660
Again, this flies in the face of previous waves of gay and trans activism, which were

317
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:23,160
interested in assimilation.

318
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:26,040
One day, I am truly going to have to do that queer theory video.

319
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:30,080
But for now, the point is, the end result of the normalizing process is the destruction

320
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:34,920
of everything unique about a thing and its reduction to only its surface level components.

321
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:38,820
I'm not saying that I want to go back to an era where gays were being persecuted or something.

322
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:41,560
If you want that, then I've got some real estate in the Middle East to sell you.

323
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:46,020
I'm saying that normalization destroys all of the good things about being not normal.

324
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:47,020
The fun.

325
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:48,020
The edginess.

326
