0	3500	Everyone and their mother right now is making jokes about the new Mac Pro.
3500	5900	Yes, it's a $6,000 cheese grater.
5900	8100	Yes, the monitor is another $5,000.
8100	11200	Yes, the stand to hold out the monitor costs another $1,000.
11200	14100	And yes, those figures are for the base model.
14100	16300	The souped-up version is more like $16,000.
16300	18800	It's not that the new Mac Pro is unimpressive.
18800	21800	The actual hardware inside is not top-tier, but it's pretty close.
21800	25100	And the monitor having 6K capabilities is pretty phenomenal.
25100	27800	But a PC with these stats would cost half the price.
27800	32700	And it's no surprise to anyone that after Apple got thwomped by Microsoft in the 1990s,
32700	35900	and they attached some chrome plating to track the hipsters over,
35900	38500	that when you buy Apple, you're largely buying a brand.
38500	43400	That's why when I needed to use Mac-only software, I ran a Hackintosh for two years.
43400	48600	A Hackintosh, for those of you unaware, is when you use PC hardware and run Mac OS on it.
48600	52300	It takes some tinkering to get working, but it's a lot cheaper than buying an actual Mac.
52300	56300	I actually recorded an old vlog about the creation of my Hackintosh back when I did it,
56300	58600	that I was too lazy to put up.
58600	61400	Is there any actual real interest in seeing it with you guys?
61400	62500	Should I actually put it up?
62500	67500	Anyway, my point is, when you're building a PC, you have near-infinite levels of customizability.
67500	71800	But Macs are, as a regular viewer once described them in my stream chat as,
71800	74200	luxury Ledite appliances.
74200	75500	That's pretty good, dude, thanks.
75500	79400	There's not much in the way of tinkering around inside of Apple products.
79400	81000	At least not very easily.
81000	85600	And that's by Apple's design, so that you have to go through their expensive repair services.
85600	91000	That's why the right-to-repair legal battle often centers around things like iPhones and whatever.
91000	96700	Apple would prefer that you think of everything they sell as a magic box, with unknowable arcane contents.
96700	101600	Something that you can't simply tinker with yourself to repair, but must be handed off to their experts.
101600	103800	Or better yet, simply replaced for something new.
103800	108100	This is the same reason why the Geek Squad still maintains a tiny niche market among the boomers.
108100	112000	Where they'll charge you hundreds of bucks to reset a Windows password, another bullshit like that.
112000	114700	A boomer probably knows how to do maintenance on his own car,
114700	118800	or at the very least understands that you can pop the hood and take a look at the inner workings.
118800	119700	But a computer?
119700	124600	It might as well be an ancient black obelisk that only the Best Buy shamans can commune with.
124600	128400	And the car analogy really does describe the stunt that Apple's trying to pull.
128400	131300	With a car, everything on the inside is relatively accessible.
131300	135100	And there's a thriving culture around do-it-yourself vehicle mods and repairs.
135100	136600	With computers, not so much.
136600	138600	And Apple capitalizes on that ignorance.
138600	141900	An Apple car would quite literally have no way to repair it.
141900	145800	And an Apple mechanic would simply tell you to shell out for a new one like you're an easy mark.
145800	150400	And the coastal elites, the hipsters and the journos and the social justice Apples, they all fall for it.
150400	151500	Hook, line and sinker.
151500	157000	For being members of the working class, they sure can't afford to buy wildly overpriced garbage.
157000	160600	And Apple, for being such a socially left company that they proudly declare,
160600	162600	hate has no place on our platforms.
162600	166500	They've got no problem with exploiting brown third-worlders in their sweatshops,
166500	169800	making Apple products in order to mark them up about 10,000%
169800	174200	and then sell them to rich kid communists who see absolutely no problem with what they're doing.
174200	176000	It's all just a gigantic circle jerk.
176000	178900	SJWs talk about how progressive and morally superior they are,
178900	181300	as they support business models they claim to oppose.
181300	186100	Companies virtue signal in the press and fake progressivism to try and sell more of their product,
186100	190300	all the while never truly bringing their business practices into line with their stated goals.
190300	195200	Nobody cares when Apple talks about hate speech or Google slaps a pride flag on their search engine,
195200	196700	because we all know it's a smokescreen.
196700	197400	It's a lie.
197400	200800	It's a calculated tactic to get social justice idiots to give them more money.
200800	204700	And it works because of Apple's design philosophy, and the sneaky sleight of hand they use along with it.
204700	207300	When you look at an Apple product, especially some of their earlier stuff,
207300	210900	you can see why the transition from educational tool to hipster paradise worked.
210900	214700	The iPod, the iPhone, and iMac all have a sleek feel to them.
214700	217500	There's a simplicity to the buttons and the on-screen interfaces.
217500	220000	You know exactly what everything does just by looking at it.
220000	223600	This allows Apple products to be accessible, cross-language, cross-culture,
223600	225000	even with the technologically illiterate.
225000	230100	But the process of simplification has also been smoothing nuance out of the conversation at Apple for a long time now.
230100	233200	There's no room to modify an Apple device, because who knows how it works.
233200	237300	You can't repair it if it breaks, it's so simple either it works or it doesn't, and that's that.
237300	241300	And if you try, well, expect the entire weight of Apple to come down on you,
241300	246000	because they don't want anybody breaking the illusion that their products aren't simply enchanted talismans,
246000	248200	but have knowable constituent parts.
248200	250900	Which is hilarious, by the way, considering that the new Mac Pro
250900	256800	does actually include industry-standard PCIe ports alongside their own proprietary GPU option.
256800	262200	Now, if you could simply open the computer up, put in a GeForce or a Radeon graphics card into one of those PCIes,
262200	266200	then you'd be fine, but the minute you open an Apple machine, you void the warranty.
266200	271300	So instead, you get stuck with Apple's aging proprietary GPU models that will likely never get updated,
271300	276000	or you can pay out the ass to have a certified Apple tech install an industry-standard graphics card,
276000	278100	at triple the PC price because you're a sucker.
278100	281900	And all those suckers that lap this nonsense up are precisely the types of people
281900	285000	who are fine with dumbing down everything else in their lives.
285000	289000	The over-reliance on simplistic IKEA constructions for furniture, for example,
289000	293300	or buying everything they can off Amazon because Amazon Prime is just so convenient,
293300	296100	over-consumption of fast food or other unhealthy options,
296100	298700	while claiming that their poor health is due to genetic factors,
298700	303300	a failure to understand any type of living that isn't centered on California or New York,
303300	307300	the tendency to reduce politics to an it's-us-or-them zero-sum game,
307300	311100	where you're either a progressive SJW or you're a fascist, there's no middle ground.
311100	314100	I'm not saying there's no room for convenience in life, there obviously is,
314100	319700	but the people that Apple products appeal to are the people who consistently take the easiest and shallowest routes throughout their life,
319700	323200	and then blame the state of the world and of themselves on everything else around them,
323200	326900	failing to fully realize both the poor consequences of their poor choices,
326900	331700	and that most of their problems would be solved by not taking the path of least resistance every single time.
331700	335400	In other words, unlike all of the other elements of Apple's design philosophy,
335400	338500	freedom can't be simplified away, it's too complex.
338500	340600	Social justice is what you get when you try.
340600	342500	Unlike most other companies right now,
342500	346300	I'd argue that Chick-fil-A is actually following their personal morality at this point,
346300	348000	and operating beyond profit.
348000	351300	I don't agree at all with Chick-fil-A's stance on gay people,
351300	357300	but they're not motivated solely by profit because they've stuck to it even when it's become socially unpopular to do so.
357300	361200	All of these other companies only took up the rainbow flag after it became the safe option to do so.
361200	364100	A business is only truly interested in a social cause,
364100	366300	if it's willing to lose customers to stand up for it.
366300	369700	Otherwise, it's just plain old greed wearing the SJW hat.
