1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,500
Everyone and their mother right now is making jokes about the new Mac Pro.

2
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:05,900
Yes, it's a $6,000 cheese grater.

3
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:08,100
Yes, the monitor is another $5,000.

4
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:11,200
Yes, the stand to hold out the monitor costs another $1,000.

5
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:14,100
And yes, those figures are for the base model.

6
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:16,300
The souped-up version is more like $16,000.

7
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:18,800
It's not that the new Mac Pro is unimpressive.

8
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:21,800
The actual hardware inside is not top-tier, but it's pretty close.

9
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:25,100
And the monitor having 6K capabilities is pretty phenomenal.

10
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:27,800
But a PC with these stats would cost half the price.

11
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:32,700
And it's no surprise to anyone that after Apple got thwomped by Microsoft in the 1990s,

12
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:35,900
and they attached some chrome plating to track the hipsters over,

13
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:38,500
that when you buy Apple, you're largely buying a brand.

14
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:43,400
That's why when I needed to use Mac-only software, I ran a Hackintosh for two years.

15
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:48,600
A Hackintosh, for those of you unaware, is when you use PC hardware and run Mac OS on it.

16
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:52,300
It takes some tinkering to get working, but it's a lot cheaper than buying an actual Mac.

17
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:56,300
I actually recorded an old vlog about the creation of my Hackintosh back when I did it,

18
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:58,600
that I was too lazy to put up.

19
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:01,400
Is there any actual real interest in seeing it with you guys?

20
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:02,500
Should I actually put it up?

21
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:07,500
Anyway, my point is, when you're building a PC, you have near-infinite levels of customizability.

22
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:11,800
But Macs are, as a regular viewer once described them in my stream chat as,

23
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:14,200
luxury Ledite appliances.

24
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:15,500
That's pretty good, dude, thanks.

25
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:19,400
There's not much in the way of tinkering around inside of Apple products.

26
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:21,000
At least not very easily.

27
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,600
And that's by Apple's design, so that you have to go through their expensive repair services.

28
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:31,000
That's why the right-to-repair legal battle often centers around things like iPhones and whatever.

29
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,700
Apple would prefer that you think of everything they sell as a magic box, with unknowable arcane contents.

30
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:41,600
Something that you can't simply tinker with yourself to repair, but must be handed off to their experts.

31
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,800
Or better yet, simply replaced for something new.

32
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:48,100
This is the same reason why the Geek Squad still maintains a tiny niche market among the boomers.

33
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:52,000
Where they'll charge you hundreds of bucks to reset a Windows password, another bullshit like that.

34
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,700
A boomer probably knows how to do maintenance on his own car,

35
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:58,800
or at the very least understands that you can pop the hood and take a look at the inner workings.

36
00:01:58,800 --> 00:01:59,700
But a computer?

37
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:04,600
It might as well be an ancient black obelisk that only the Best Buy shamans can commune with.

38
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:08,400
And the car analogy really does describe the stunt that Apple's trying to pull.

39
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:11,300
With a car, everything on the inside is relatively accessible.

40
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:15,100
And there's a thriving culture around do-it-yourself vehicle mods and repairs.

41
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:16,600
With computers, not so much.

42
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:18,600
And Apple capitalizes on that ignorance.

43
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:21,900
An Apple car would quite literally have no way to repair it.

44
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:25,800
And an Apple mechanic would simply tell you to shell out for a new one like you're an easy mark.

45
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:30,400
And the coastal elites, the hipsters and the journos and the social justice Apples, they all fall for it.

46
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,500
Hook, line and sinker.

47
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:37,000
For being members of the working class, they sure can't afford to buy wildly overpriced garbage.

48
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,600
And Apple, for being such a socially left company that they proudly declare,

49
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:42,600
hate has no place on our platforms.

50
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:46,500
They've got no problem with exploiting brown third-worlders in their sweatshops,

51
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:49,800
making Apple products in order to mark them up about 10,000%

52
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:54,200
and then sell them to rich kid communists who see absolutely no problem with what they're doing.

53
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:56,000
It's all just a gigantic circle jerk.

54
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,900
SJWs talk about how progressive and morally superior they are,

55
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:01,300
as they support business models they claim to oppose.

56
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:06,100
Companies virtue signal in the press and fake progressivism to try and sell more of their product,

57
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:10,300
all the while never truly bringing their business practices into line with their stated goals.

58
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:15,200
Nobody cares when Apple talks about hate speech or Google slaps a pride flag on their search engine,

59
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,700
because we all know it's a smokescreen.

60
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:17,400
It's a lie.

61
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:20,800
It's a calculated tactic to get social justice idiots to give them more money.

62
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:24,700
And it works because of Apple's design philosophy, and the sneaky sleight of hand they use along with it.

63
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:27,300
When you look at an Apple product, especially some of their earlier stuff,

64
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:30,900
you can see why the transition from educational tool to hipster paradise worked.

65
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:34,700
The iPod, the iPhone, and iMac all have a sleek feel to them.

66
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:37,500
There's a simplicity to the buttons and the on-screen interfaces.

67
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:40,000
You know exactly what everything does just by looking at it.

68
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,600
This allows Apple products to be accessible, cross-language, cross-culture,

69
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:45,000
even with the technologically illiterate.

70
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:50,100
But the process of simplification has also been smoothing nuance out of the conversation at Apple for a long time now.

71
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:53,200
There's no room to modify an Apple device, because who knows how it works.

72
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:57,300
You can't repair it if it breaks, it's so simple either it works or it doesn't, and that's that.

73
00:03:57,300 --> 00:04:01,300
And if you try, well, expect the entire weight of Apple to come down on you,

74
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:06,000
because they don't want anybody breaking the illusion that their products aren't simply enchanted talismans,

75
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,200
but have knowable constituent parts.

76
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:10,900
Which is hilarious, by the way, considering that the new Mac Pro

77
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:16,800
does actually include industry-standard PCIe ports alongside their own proprietary GPU option.

78
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:22,200
Now, if you could simply open the computer up, put in a GeForce or a Radeon graphics card into one of those PCIes,

79
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:26,200
then you'd be fine, but the minute you open an Apple machine, you void the warranty.

80
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:31,300
So instead, you get stuck with Apple's aging proprietary GPU models that will likely never get updated,

81
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:36,000
or you can pay out the ass to have a certified Apple tech install an industry-standard graphics card,

82
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,100
at triple the PC price because you're a sucker.

83
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:41,900
And all those suckers that lap this nonsense up are precisely the types of people

84
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:45,000
who are fine with dumbing down everything else in their lives.

85
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,000
The over-reliance on simplistic IKEA constructions for furniture, for example,

86
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,300
or buying everything they can off Amazon because Amazon Prime is just so convenient,

87
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:56,100
over-consumption of fast food or other unhealthy options,

88
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:58,700
while claiming that their poor health is due to genetic factors,

89
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:03,300
a failure to understand any type of living that isn't centered on California or New York,

90
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:07,300
the tendency to reduce politics to an it's-us-or-them zero-sum game,

91
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:11,100
where you're either a progressive SJW or you're a fascist, there's no middle ground.

92
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:14,100
I'm not saying there's no room for convenience in life, there obviously is,

93
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:19,700
but the people that Apple products appeal to are the people who consistently take the easiest and shallowest routes throughout their life,

94
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:23,200
and then blame the state of the world and of themselves on everything else around them,

95
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:26,900
failing to fully realize both the poor consequences of their poor choices,

96
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:31,700
and that most of their problems would be solved by not taking the path of least resistance every single time.

97
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:35,400
In other words, unlike all of the other elements of Apple's design philosophy,

98
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:38,500
freedom can't be simplified away, it's too complex.

99
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:40,600
Social justice is what you get when you try.

100
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,500
Unlike most other companies right now,

101
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:46,300
I'd argue that Chick-fil-A is actually following their personal morality at this point,

102
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:48,000
and operating beyond profit.

103
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,300
I don't agree at all with Chick-fil-A's stance on gay people,

104
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:57,300
but they're not motivated solely by profit because they've stuck to it even when it's become socially unpopular to do so.

105
00:05:57,300 --> 00:06:01,200
All of these other companies only took up the rainbow flag after it became the safe option to do so.

106
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:04,100
A business is only truly interested in a social cause,

107
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:06,300
if it's willing to lose customers to stand up for it.

108
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:09,700
Otherwise, it's just plain old greed wearing the SJW hat.
