1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,520
Hello, what's up?

2
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:03,720
Hey, how's it going?

3
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:05,380
I'm going to sound a little bit strange.

4
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:07,440
I'm in a different location right now.

5
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:09,920
How do I sound?

6
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:11,600
You sound good.

7
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:12,560
OK, that's good.

8
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:13,560
That's good.

9
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:16,240
Have you been?

10
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:17,940
I've been fine.

11
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:19,720
How have you been?

12
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:20,360
I'm pretty good.

13
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:23,000
I took a week off from YouTubing.

14
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,720
Nice.

15
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:26,200
Actually, over the course of the week,

16
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:34,800
I uploaded a series that it was me, Arch, Kibbs, Lilith,

17
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,400
and Taftach.

18
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:39,360
Taftach bowed out like 3 quarters of the way

19
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:41,040
through because she couldn't do it anymore.

20
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:44,480
But we watched Lord of the Rings, The Rings of Power,

21
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:46,960
season one, and like, Rift on it because it's not a very good

22
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:47,800
show.

23
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:48,960
But I released that.

24
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:50,200
Yeah, it's pretty bad.

25
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:52,840
But I released it over the course of my week off.

26
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:54,200
It was a pretty good week off.

27
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:55,000
Yeah.

28
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,160
That's cool.

29
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:57,960
Someone says I'm more muffled than normal.

30
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:59,880
Yes, I mean, this is a lot.

31
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:01,240
I got to just hold on.

32
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:03,560
Jesus.

33
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:05,320
Hold on.

34
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:06,520
I'm in a different location.

35
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:08,520
All my stuff's strange.

36
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:14,680
But yeah, so what's the TLDR and what you're doing right now?

37
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:17,000
I've only seen like a little bit of the stream.

38
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,080
What's going on here?

39
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:21,280
I'm reviewing my torture from the past two days, essentially.

40
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:24,320
The first piece of torture was the panel

41
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:29,040
that turned into a 3v1, and nobody else could get in.

42
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:32,200
And the second torture is the two hours of hate.

43
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:35,560
That actually ended up being more like two hours

44
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:37,200
of mild criticism.

45
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,640
Oh my gosh, thank you for the $10, Elle.

46
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,880
Oh, is that Elle from Death Note even?

47
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:45,040
It kind of looks like the, yeah.

48
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:45,760
Yeah, that's him.

49
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:46,680
Elle from Death Note.

50
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:47,180
Jesus.

51
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:53,880
So I guess my first question is, why

52
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:57,120
are you doing this to yourself?

53
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,800
Self torturing again.

54
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:01,080
You seem to do this regularly.

55
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:03,400
I think it's good for me to review things.

56
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:10,040
Like that panel where it turned into everybody versus me,

57
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:12,360
I thought I did worse on than I actually

58
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,980
did when I actually reviewed it.

59
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:18,400
I was like, oh, this wasn't bad at all.

60
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:21,280
And it made me feel a little bit better as well.

61
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,640
And then it's just good to go over things

62
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:27,120
and kind of see where you could put other things, how you

63
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,280
can improve stuff like that.

64
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,000
Oh, fair enough.

65
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:30,520
Fair enough.

66
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:33,120
It just also sounds like you're torturing yourself,

67
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,240
which probably isn't that good.

68
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,400
But I mean, hey, if you're.

69
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,560
Alt-right punching bag art.

70
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:40,280
Yeah, yeah, apparently I'm an alt-right punching bag,

71
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,800
apparently.

72
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,400
So that's another thing.

73
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:47,080
Yeah, I don't think I am, but.

74
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:50,160
Someone in your chat says, has Brove responded to Sunday yet?

75
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,440
Do you mean me?

76
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:53,440
I guess he means you, yeah.

77
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,160
I don't think you'd need to.

78
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:56,800
No, no.

79
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,120
You should just clown on him.

80
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,800
What I would do is just clown on him.

81
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,400
He's my favorite lolcow right now.

82
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:06,960
He seems to be kind of insane.

83
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,360
Just a little bit.

84
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,200
Yeah.

85
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:14,560
And he seems like, oh, man, I don't necessarily

86
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,400
know how similar they are.

87
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,960
But he seems to have a similar obsessive pattern

88
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:21,360
like Mr. Girl does, where he'll be

89
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,000
hyper-fixated for a little bit and then move on, you know?

90
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,240
You know, he used to be a huge Sargon fan, apparently.

91
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,520
That's actually really funny.

92
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:37,880
OK, so this is, I don't know about this current video

93
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:39,920
that you're about to watch, but the previous one

94
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:44,240
was all about the platforming drama, right?

95
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:48,800
So what's the TLDR on the Stardust platforming drama?

96
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:51,600
That I should care about the harm

97
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,400
that I put out more than I should

98
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,440
care about whatever benefits I think

99
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:59,280
I'm getting from my interaction.

100
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,280
At least that's what other people think.

101
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:05,120
I personally, like what you said about different frameworks

102
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:08,600
that we're operating in really resonated with me.

103
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:11,120
Last time we talked, I think, I don't know how long ago it was

104
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,880
when you said that to me.

105
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:14,280
But that really resonated with me.

106
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:18,160
And also, I think, I can't lie and say that I, you know,

107
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:21,400
like I know, TedLogic can do this.

108
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:23,560
He can just gig a chat, be like, I don't give a fuck,

109
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:26,480
and it'll be fine, right?

110
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:30,040
I can't really lie about it.

111
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,600
I think it would be dishonest for me

112
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:36,200
to say I don't care about harm that I can inflict at all.

113
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:39,320
Clearly, I care about some type of harm.

114
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:43,480
But as it is right now, any type of harm

115
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:47,880
that I could, that is possible for me platforming people

116
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:53,480
is outweighed by how much I love what I'm doing

117
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:57,600
and what benefits I think I'm getting from it.

118
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:01,600
And it just outweighs it every time for me.

119
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,760
There may be some harm there, but the harm

120
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:08,400
is just not enough for me to not do what I'm doing.

121
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,920
Just to be clear, what you're talking about

122
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:14,080
is when you'll talk to like Richard Spencer or somebody

123
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:17,000
else who's on the dissident right or something.

124
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,400
And you're platforming them.

125
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:22,400
And they're saying, these people, MindWaves

126
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:26,240
and whoever else it was in that previous video,

127
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:30,520
they're telling you that you're talking to Richard Spencer

128
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:32,680
or whoever.

129
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:36,920
You're allowing them to expose their ideas to your audience.

130
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,920
And so that's going to cause more harm than good

131
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:39,440
down the road.

132
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:46,600
Even if you were to accept that as true,

133
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,760
what is actually your take on that?

134
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:52,640
The idea that, oh, you talking to Richard Spencer

135
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:54,480
and let's say that you do exceptionally poorly

136
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:56,200
in a debate with him or something.

137
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:58,640
And so what ends up happening is your audience

138
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:02,160
is converted into neo-Nazis, right?

139
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,720
Yeah, or some people in the audience are, yeah.

140
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:07,000
Yeah, that's their view, right?

141
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,600
And what's your counterargument to that?

142
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:13,760
My counterargument is that I get better, right?

143
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:16,120
And I just do better next time.

144
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:22,240
My counterargument is that if they were that easily converted

145
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,440
then they weren't really mine to begin with.

146
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:28,720
Yeah, yeah.

147
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:32,480
See, I genuinely don't agree with the platforming arguments

148
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:34,360
and I'm a lot more like chud logic on this

149
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,440
where it's like, I don't care.

150
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:36,840
I'm here to have fun.

151
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:38,040
I'm here to do whatever I want.

152
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:40,680
I'm here to make some money in some senses.

153
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:42,400
So it's like, I don't care.

154
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:46,160
At the same time, like I don't even think chud logic

155
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:49,400
would say that I'm here to make money

156
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:54,160
by causing harm to other people by his own standard

157
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,600
of whatever harm happens to be.

158
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:57,600
I don't even think chud would say that, you know?

159
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,680
I think people genuinely don't think that they're,

160
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,680
that even if they are causing harm,

161
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,920
they don't think they are generally, you know?

162
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:08,600
Like if you were to talk to some like oil baron

163
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:12,200
who's destroying, you know, just destroying a forest

164
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:15,560
or destroying something to get oil and then sell it,

165
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,080
he's gonna say that, well, there's benefits

166
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:18,480
to getting the oil and selling it too.

167
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:20,800
And there are benefits to getting the oil and selling it.

168
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,200
He's just gonna have a different moral calculus, right?

169
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:26,800
And you can go back and forth on whether or not

170
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:30,560
like he's correct or actually, at some point you can't

171
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:34,880
because like, morality is one of those tough,

172
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:36,400
one of those really tough things to talk about

173
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,560
because at the end of the day,

174
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:41,760
everybody seems to be correct from their own point of view,

175
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:42,960
if you know what I mean.

176
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,200
Yeah.

177
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:51,600
Like, Sargon and I have had a bunch of morality arguments

178
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:54,720
over the past couple of years in private, in private.

179
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:57,560
And a lot of it was like just reading up

180
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:59,640
on like certain philosophy and certain ideas

181
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:02,080
and what morality is and how it should be structured.

182
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:05,920
And it's just that you realize that like,

183
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:10,680
you drill down to a point where you understand

184
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:13,960
that everything is just, it's all just how you feel

185
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:17,240
about it and there's no real moral calculus at all,

186
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,400
which is kind of like a black pill,

187
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:19,960
but it seems to be true.

188
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:20,800
You know what I mean?

189
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,080
Yeah.

190
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,880
I mean, if it's true that these things have a risk,

191
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:26,440
so does everything else.

192
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:28,440
Like everything else has a risk.

193
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:32,480
And at the end of the day, is that risk worth it for you?

194
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:36,880
And I'm gonna answer like, with what I'm doing, yes.

195
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:44,120
And it's worth it because not just because of the benefits

196
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:47,120
I get from it, but because I genuinely enjoy.

197
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:50,880
And there are very few, I love making content,

198
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:55,880
but there is very little content that I enjoy as much

199
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,080
as like sitting down with people

200
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:01,480
who I'm not supposed to sit down with,

201
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:02,320
and having a conversation with them.

202
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,680
To be fair, I'm the same way, yeah, that's, yeah.

203
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:07,640
It's very, there's so, I love it so much.

204
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:12,640
And it's like, people are asking me to care so much

205
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:16,600
about this potential for harm,

206
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:20,520
that I stopped doing something that I like deeply love

207
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:23,120
or that I start doing it less, you know?

208
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:26,520
And I don't think that's fair though.

209
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:28,400
No, I know exactly what you mean.

210
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,280
Someone in the chat said,

211
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:31,360
what does this high school take?

212
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:34,520
So here's, it's not quite a high school take.

213
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:39,520
It's like, you know, when you're young,

214
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:42,640
most young people, we're talking like under 10 years old,

215
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:45,080
like really young, they tend to operate under

216
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:47,760
like some kind of deontological frame, right?

217
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:50,120
If they're religious, if they're raised by religious family

218
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:52,520
or just, you know, rules-based ethics,

219
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:55,640
you follow what your teacher says, follow what your parents

220
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:56,840
say, whatever, right?

221
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,960
And then like, generally, as you start thinking

222
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:01,840
about these systems a bit more,

223
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:04,160
as you hit like your teen years and your twenties,

224
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:06,480
that's when you start getting like consequentialists, right?

225
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,040
And God, I'm reminded of like,

226
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:10,880
Xanderhal talking to Lauren Souther.

227
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:11,720
Did you watch that?

228
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:13,800
It was like a year ago or six months ago, whatever it was?

229
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:14,640
Yeah, yeah.

230
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,960
And Xanderhal tried to hit her with like,

231
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,560
are you a consequentialist?

232
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:20,900
Like just asking that question openly several times.

233
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:23,720
And Xanderhal doesn't seem to understand,

234
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:25,080
not to just throw shade on him.

235
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,760
He's not here, but I also don't care.

236
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:30,600
But like, he seems to be at that like early twenties.

237
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:31,560
I think he's in his early twenties.

238
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:34,600
So he's at that early twenties stage where it seems like

239
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:38,120
ruthlessly going after ends in defiance

240
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:41,560
of rules-based morality or in defiance of tradition

241
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:44,640
or in defiance of whatever seems to be the best thing to do

242
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,440
because what you want is to improve the world.

243
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:48,000
So, you know, fair enough.

244
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,280
But he just doesn't understand that like,

245
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:52,840
and what a lot of people I've noticed on the left,

246
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:57,800
what they don't understand is basically that

247
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:00,440
in order for any sort of consequentialist

248
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:03,260
or any sort of utilitarian ethics to work,

249
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:07,400
you already have to have defined what the good is first

250
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:10,120
in order to like be able to point out a good end,

251
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:12,080
if you know what I mean.

252
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:14,120
So it's like, well, I think I might've,

253
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:16,960
I don't know if I made this comparison with you

254
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:18,800
or with somebody else, but I was saying like,

255
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:23,480
you could have a consequentialist ISIS fighter

256
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:25,460
who believes that it's a good end

257
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:28,120
to throw a gay person off of a rooftop

258
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,720
and to him, that's a good end.

259
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:31,760
And so he can actually give you a list of good ends

260
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:35,160
that comes out of having one less gay person in the world.

261
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:38,160
And then it's just like, well,

262
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:41,280
how did he get using the same framework,

263
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:44,240
a completely different end than you or I would get to?

264
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,360
And it's because, well,

265
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:51,360
any sort of moral calculus is based on a foundation

266
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:55,520
of what is basically just your moral intuitions,

267
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:57,240
just your feelings, right?

268
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:59,200
So like, you and I will say,

269
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,600
well, we shouldn't kill gay people.

270
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:02,800
And that guy might say, well, we should kill gay people.

271
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:05,320
And then the only real difference between us

272
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:09,280
is that we feel one way and he feels a different way.

273
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:12,960
And at that point, it's hard to reconcile

274
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:14,400
different morality, you know what I mean?

275
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,760
It's, there's like a,

276
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:21,000
you're just not going to communicate

277
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,800
with the other person, I guess, yeah, so.

278
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:26,920
Yeah, and I think the last time we talked,

279
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:28,640
you were playing, I think, Dark Tide,

280
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:30,680
and I was trying to cheer you up about something or other.

281
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:32,760
And I basically said that a lot of people

282
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:36,280
who are like extremely progressive,

283
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:41,040
or they are, or they're like socialist or something,

284
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:43,120
some kind of revolutionary socialist,

285
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:48,120
they tend to view every single action

286
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,680
through a moral framework that's like,

287
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:55,040
well, how can I advance my political cause?

288
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,040
And so if you're not advancing a political cause

289
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:00,400
when you're doing, taking any sort of step anywhere,

290
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:04,840
especially in public, then you're doing something bad, right?

291
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:05,680
So if you're-

292
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,440
Yeah, how can I make the world more left

293
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:10,760
is I remember what you said specifically about it, yeah.

294
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:13,040
Yes, but here's the thing.

295
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,920
If you don't value making the world more left,

296
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:18,120
or at least you don't value it as much as they do,

297
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:18,960
well, then you're operating

298
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:20,880
from a different moral framework, right?

299
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:23,520
Yeah, and I don't value it as much as they do.

300
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:28,520
I don't value, I value this meaningful conversation

301
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:33,520
with somebody more than I value,

302
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:38,520
worrying about some harm that I'm inflicting

303
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:43,160
into the world through it.

304
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:44,000
I don't know.

305
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,880
And yeah, I don't know if that makes sense, but-

306
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:47,720
No, it does, it does.

307
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:50,600
And that's probably what I would tell people like mine way,

308
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:53,120
which is just like, listen, you have a moral framework

309
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:55,360
such that you view things this way,

310
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:57,080
but I don't share that framework.

311
00:13:57,080 --> 00:14:00,840
And to me, the greater good is having these conversations

312
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,240
compared to the possibility,

313
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:06,400
the admittedly very small possibility that somebody on,

314
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:10,240
you know, considering your audience, considering you,

315
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:12,640
considering the relative size of your stream

316
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:14,520
that you're going to like cause the Third Reich

317
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,080
is next to 0%.

318
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:18,800
So like, it's not much of a big deal, you know?

319
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:21,600
There's no actual harm being done here.

320
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:24,320
And that's the case with almost all platforming arguments.

321
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:28,320
You know, until you get to like destiny or bigger,

322
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:31,800
or like a million subs on YouTube,

323
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:33,440
like a Sargon or something,

324
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:36,400
until you get to like these really big names and larger,

325
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:38,600
the platforming argument like makes no fucking sense.

326
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:41,880
Like, you know, how much Nazism are you actually spreading

327
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:44,680
on like a 20 view Twitch panel stream?

328
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:47,200
Like fucking none, you know what I mean?

329
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,600
It's ridiculous.

330
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:56,040
There's also one other thing I've been thinking about.

331
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:57,720
I was thinking of, it kind of came into mind

332
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:59,960
as I was watching you talk about this.

333
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:05,480
The third main moral framework is virtue ethics.

334
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:08,600
And you're familiar with virtue ethics, right?

335
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:09,680
Not really a whole lot.

336
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:12,680
I'm not really familiar with ethics as a whole.

337
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:13,520
Okay, okay.

338
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:16,080
So yeah, so the TLDR is that consequentialism

339
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:17,880
is goodness is good ends.

340
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:21,760
The deontological is goodness is good rules.

341
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:25,160
And then virtue ethics is goodness is good habits.

342
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:27,480
And the idea of virtue ethics is basically that

343
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:31,320
things that are good are things that cultivate

344
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:36,320
good moral character in how you behave, right?

345
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:40,680
In the kind of the quality of person that you are.

346
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:47,440
And so I know Sargon is on a big virtue ethics art

347
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:49,880
right now, destiny started up in a virtue ethics art

348
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:51,160
like last year.

349
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:53,740
I think destiny started by reading CS Lewis.

350
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:56,440
But there's a famous quote,

351
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:57,720
I don't think it's a CS Lewis quote,

352
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:59,720
but there's a famous quote that says that

353
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:06,440
it's something that man is both the marble and the sculptor.

354
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:10,640
And the idea is that every action that you take

355
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:14,180
also acts on you and you change as a result of it, right?

356
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:19,160
And I think everyone has the experience

357
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:24,080
of being like a bit trepidatious about doing a new thing.

358
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:25,540
But then as soon as you do it,

359
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:26,580
you realize, oh, I can do it.

360
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:28,660
And then you do it regularly.

361
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:32,080
Smokers, for example, drug users, people who drink alcohol,

362
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:35,820
but also more positive behaviors as well.

363
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:37,940
And you're scared about breaking out of your shell,

364
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:40,340
you break out of your shell, oh, it's actually not so bad.

365
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:42,300
What's happening psychologically is like

366
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:46,900
new pathways are being formed in your brain

367
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:48,700
that makes it easier to do those actions

368
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:50,500
a second, third, fourth, fifth time.

369
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:55,260
And so what ends up happening is that

370
00:16:57,540 --> 00:17:02,540
good ethical behavior is whatever builds

371
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:06,380
virtuous habits in your person.

372
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:07,940
And that can be related to good rules

373
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:09,760
and it can be related to good ends,

374
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:11,980
but it's also related to good habits.

375
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:16,680
And the reason I'm bringing this up,

376
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:17,980
the reason I'm bringing this up

377
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:20,220
is because even though a lot of left-leaning people

378
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:22,700
are like strict consequentialists,

379
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:25,960
the entire argument regarding platforming

380
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:27,540
is a virtue ethics argument.

381
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:32,420
And a lot of lefties tend to reject virtue ethics

382
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:34,260
because to them it's all about getting the goal,

383
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:35,220
getting the result.

384
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:37,540
You know, it's all about chasing after

385
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:39,360
what makes the world a better place

386
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:41,540
in a very like ruthless manner.

387
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:45,660
And you know, the most extreme leftists in history

388
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:49,220
always ended up committing like these huge political purges

389
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:51,460
because they were after the goal,

390
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:54,360
regardless of what kind of monster it turned them into.

391
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:58,380
I think that's, you know, there's a common critique

392
00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:01,320
of the authoritarian left on the right.

393
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:02,860
And it's that they always believe

394
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:04,760
that it's one more purge until utopia.

395
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:10,940
But the platforming conversation,

396
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:13,080
the platforming argument is like,

397
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:17,700
it's a virtue ethics argument because the implication

398
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:20,020
is that your audience will turn into Nazis

399
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:22,300
through exposure to these new ideas.

400
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:25,260
But if your audience were actually strict consequentialists

401
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:26,940
then it wouldn't matter how much exposure

402
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:28,620
to these ideas they get

403
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:31,100
because they're always going to go for the results.

404
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:33,380
And if they're good results, they're good results, right?

405
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:36,620
So it's funny to see,

406
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:38,660
like I don't think these people have fully thought

407
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:42,140
through their ideas because it's funny to see them,

408
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:44,700
like it's funny to see them use logic

409
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:47,580
that they would never use in any other situation.

410
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:50,540
That is a really interesting point.

411
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:57,200
Is there a way that you can, well, I mean, I guess,

412
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:02,580
it's super interesting that it's like

413
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:05,660
a virtue ethics argument, the platforming argument.

414
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:10,700
I feel like it's a mix of consequentialist and virtue,

415
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:12,340
isn't it?

416
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:14,180
Well, here's the thing, at the extremes,

417
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:16,660
all three of the ethical systems blend into one,

418
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:19,860
which is why talking about them is kind of meaningless.

419
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:20,700
You know what I mean?

420
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:25,540
Like, I mean, if you talk about deontological ethics,

421
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:27,620
the common critique that pretty much everyone knows

422
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:29,740
is like, well, what if you have a bad rule?

423
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:31,300
It's like, well, good equals good rules.

424
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:33,380
Well, if you have a bad rule, should you follow it?

425
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:38,380
And like, well, if you live in a system of honor

426
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:39,860
or like a caste system or something

427
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:42,260
and you have to kill somebody who's innocent otherwise,

428
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:43,180
I was like, should you follow that?

429
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:44,780
Well, the answer seems to be no, right?

430
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:48,140
You push deontological ethics to their limit,

431
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:49,940
they seem to break pretty easily

432
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:52,580
when it comes to committing immoral actions.

433
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:55,420
But at the same time, consequentialist ethics

434
00:19:55,420 --> 00:19:57,060
has a very similar problem.

435
00:19:57,060 --> 00:20:00,060
And I've heard it said, I've heard it said a few times,

436
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:02,660
like in a pure consequentialist world,

437
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:05,060
no one would ever go to a hospital, right?

438
00:20:05,060 --> 00:20:06,820
And the reason you wouldn't go to a hospital

439
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:10,140
is because like just per the strict moral calculus,

440
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:13,140
you can go into a hospital for like a cold

441
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:16,620
and then in the hospital are like 10 patients

442
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:20,680
who could all use your organs.

443
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:22,980
And the moral calculus is, well, guess what?

444
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:25,580
They'll just kill you, take your organs,

445
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:27,700
save these 10 lives, one life versus 10, right?

446
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:30,100
The moral calculus weighs out that that's a moral action

447
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:32,100
in a purely consequentialist sense.

448
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:34,020
And so it's like, well, fuck,

449
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:35,860
what kind of world do you build

450
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:38,560
when you have that kind of society?

451
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:40,300
Well, it'd be a terrible one, right?

452
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:46,300
So, and then you get to basically you reach a point

453
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:50,700
where you realize that the limits of each ethical system

454
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:54,100
are shored up by the other two ethical systems, you know?

455
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:56,060
Yeah, yeah, I can see that now, yeah.

456
00:20:57,300 --> 00:21:02,300
And I did a video, a video like a year and a half ago

457
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:04,500
or something and the TLDR of it

458
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:07,160
was that consent is a deontological concept

459
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:10,440
because consent is a set of rules.

460
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:13,020
It's rules-based ethics, right?

461
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:15,960
Like if, you know, you can use sexual consent,

462
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:19,160
you can use consent to working in a job

463
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:20,680
or consent to whatever, right?

464
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:21,880
Anything in life, right?

465
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:27,560
And basically, if you're consenting

466
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:29,720
to whatever it is you're consenting to,

467
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:31,200
you're laying out a set of rules and you're saying,

468
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,280
okay, well, I'm going to do X, Y, Z

469
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:35,480
and you're going to do for me, A, B, C

470
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:37,800
and we're not going to violate these rules

471
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:40,140
because you don't want to violate the consent

472
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:41,720
of your partner when you're having sex with them

473
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:45,200
or violate your employer-employee relationship,

474
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:47,720
whatever it happens to be, the contract, whatever it is.

475
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:50,360
So consent is a concept

476
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:52,720
that comes out of deontological ethics

477
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:56,480
and I've seen people, again, on the left

478
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:59,820
like hate deontology so much.

479
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:04,920
And there's this view on the right as like,

480
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,880
well, how come there are so many leftist sex pests?

481
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:07,720
How many?

482
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:08,540
Like, how come?

483
00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:09,380
Why, why?

484
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:10,760
And I don't know if there actually are that many or not,

485
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:14,080
but there are at least a few like high profile public ones.

486
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:16,080
And it's like, well, why are there?

487
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:21,080
And it seems to be the case is that if you have no sense

488
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:23,800
of deontological ethics in your ethical system,

489
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:26,480
then there's no reason to ever respect consent

490
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:29,320
because consent doesn't exist in consequentialism, right?

491
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:32,800
Like in a purely consequentialist sense, you know,

492
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:34,840
how much money could I be offered

493
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:37,040
to rape my girlfriend, right?

494
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:39,320
Well, you can just keep jacking that number up

495
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:42,040
until it hits a point where I should just do it

496
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:44,520
because I can get more good out of it

497
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:46,000
from having that much money to do more good

498
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,880
in the world with than not, right?

499
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:51,320
So in order to object to that scenario,

500
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:54,080
you have to go outside of consequentialism.

501
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:56,520
It's, this isn't exactly

502
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:59,000
like a super entertaining conversation.

503
00:22:59,000 --> 00:22:59,840
Sorry, chat.

504
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:01,000
It's helpful.

505
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:01,840
It's helpful.

506
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:03,000
Chat, shut up.

507
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,880
Okay, seriously, this is helpful.

508
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:07,120
Sorry guys, sorry.

509
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:13,040
No, I think it is very helpful.

510
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:16,520
So that is something that's interesting.

511
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:17,920
And I think maybe I need to brush up

512
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:19,560
on what you're talking about,

513
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:22,480
these different like ethical frameworks and stuff

514
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:24,200
or whatever they're called.

515
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:25,040
The best thing you can do,

516
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:27,280
the best thing you can do for like almost any of this

517
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:29,080
is just Wikipedia it, you know?

518
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:30,640
Like I do a fair amount of reading

519
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,120
because I like to read.

520
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:34,040
And like for some like political topics,

521
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:35,080
especially if you're talking about fascism

522
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:36,680
because it's such an old idea

523
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:39,400
and it's like, it was around for like 30 years

524
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:40,400
and it vanished.

525
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:41,880
So like for that you have to read.

526
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:43,240
But for a lot of these other topics

527
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:45,640
that are still like talked about today,

528
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:48,920
Wikipedia articles are very accurate.

529
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:50,000
You know what I mean?

530
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,960
Okay, yeah, I'll take a look at that.

531
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:55,680
Yeah, I will.

532
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:56,520
Thank you for that.

533
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:58,240
I think that will actually help my argument.

534
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:02,280
If I dive into those different ethics things more,

535
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:04,200
I will definitely be able to argue better.

536
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:06,800
So for example, like you could,

537
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:08,440
when someone like Mindwave says like,

538
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:09,560
well, don't you think you have a responsibility

539
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:11,540
to platform whatever, right?

540
00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:14,240
You could do the chud logic root of I don't care giga chad.

541
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:15,080
But you could also say,

542
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:17,000
listen, I think the greater good

543
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:23,080
is exposing these ideas and hopefully debunking them.

544
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:24,720
But even if I can't debunk them,

545
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:26,840
the greater good is in having the conversation

546
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:28,800
because free speech itself is a virtue.

547
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,840
Free speech itself is a virtue.

548
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:34,440
And enforcing those virtues,

549
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:35,360
especially in a climate

550
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:37,440
where they're not really being upheld anymore,

551
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:38,960
at least not right now,

552
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:40,560
that's a greater good than any harm

553
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:43,300
that could come of these ideas spreading.

554
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:45,240
And then you could also say that,

555
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:46,960
well, the greater good is also

556
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:49,280
that you hone your own skills.

557
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:50,120
And you say, well, you know,

558
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:53,000
even if one of my audience turns into a neo-Nazi

559
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,500
because I lost a debate against Richard Spencer,

560
00:24:55,540 --> 00:24:57,460
well, I'm now a better debater for it.

561
00:24:57,460 --> 00:25:00,020
And that seems to be like a worthy trade off

562
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:02,260
because now I'm better, you know?

563
00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:06,540
And oftentimes, like a lot of these,

564
00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:12,860
they're frankly just kind of like these bullying arguments.

565
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:14,660
They seem to be easily brushed away

566
00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:18,220
by appeals to self-improvement in my experience.

567
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:20,840
Interesting.

568
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:22,300
That is really helpful.

569
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:24,420
Somebody in your chat says,

570
00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:27,020
force mind waves to prove that it's bad.

571
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:29,380
I mean, mind waves can pretty easily prove

572
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:30,940
it's a hypothetical bad, right?

573
00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:34,140
Like the logic tree is there.

574
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:34,980
Oh, you refused?

575
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:35,820
Really?

576
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:36,640
It's easy to prove.

577
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:39,380
I mean, but it's easy to prove,

578
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:41,540
but it's also easy to debunk, right?

579
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:42,580
Yeah.

580
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:43,980
So like he could say something like,

581
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:45,280
listen, you know,

582
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:47,060
Stardust platforms Richard Spencer,

583
00:25:47,060 --> 00:25:49,380
Richard Spencer converts one of Stardust audience.

584
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:51,580
The world is now made incrementally worse

585
00:25:51,660 --> 00:25:53,580
because there's one more Nazi in the world.

586
00:25:53,580 --> 00:25:55,180
Like there's the logic, right?

587
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:58,180
And then you could say, well,

588
00:25:58,180 --> 00:25:59,500
even if that's the case,

589
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:01,520
there's so many other benefits to it.

590
00:26:03,340 --> 00:26:05,100
And no, no offense,

591
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:07,500
but you're not like a 10,000 viewer streamer or something.

592
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:09,740
So there's, so the drawbacks aren't really there.

593
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:10,660
You know what I mean?

594
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:14,980
Yeah, they were, yeah.

595
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:16,620
Anyway, I figured I'd just come on

596
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:18,180
and talk to you for a little bit

597
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:20,580
because every time I've tuned in to your stream

598
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:21,420
like the past few,

599
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:22,580
it seems like you're going through

600
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:24,420
some sort of struggle session.

601
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:26,720
Some sort of self-flagellation, yeah.

602
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:31,680
And the last time I talked to you,

603
00:26:33,180 --> 00:26:35,020
when you were playing Darktide,

604
00:26:35,020 --> 00:26:37,120
you also seemed down and I'm like, Jesus,

605
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:39,180
this is like the Stardust depression arc.

606
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:43,740
I think I've been a little bit more unsure of myself

607
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:46,300
recently in the past few months,

608
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:48,440
but I think I'm coming out of it.

609
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:51,360
I think we all get into funks for a little bit.

610
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:52,440
Oh yeah, me too, me too.

611
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:55,360
Yeah, I know I used to be much more confident

612
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:58,540
as a person several months ago.

613
00:26:58,540 --> 00:26:59,380
And then I don't know,

614
00:26:59,380 --> 00:27:01,280
the past couple of months have been

615
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:04,520
kind of like a Stardust no confidence arc.

616
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:09,560
And I think I'm coming out of it now, so yeah.

617
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:12,480
Is that because of mind waves or something else?

618
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:14,080
I think it's just compounding things.

619
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:16,360
I've just had like a whole bunch of things going on,

620
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:17,680
so yeah.

621
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:18,960
Okay, all right.

622
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:19,800
Yeah.

623
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:21,840
Yeah, I mean, I've had like IRL things

624
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,680
like unrelated to anything I do online,

625
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:26,080
also screw up what I'm trying to do.

626
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:27,560
It happens all the time, you know?

627
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:28,920
Yeah.

628
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:30,280
Yeah, I think you just have something

629
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:31,480
that kind of shakes you

630
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:34,880
and kind of shakes your reality for a little bit.

631
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:38,000
And then you think, can I trust my reality

632
00:27:39,740 --> 00:27:41,480
the way that I thought I could?

633
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:43,560
And you're unsure of it for a really long time.

634
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:45,280
And then you realize that,

635
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:47,760
well, that was kind of like a freak accident.

636
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:51,520
So I have to like trust myself

637
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:56,320
or I won't be able to do anything again, so yeah.

638
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:59,000
Yeah, and a lot of that is just gonna be practice too,

639
00:27:59,000 --> 00:27:59,960
you know?

640
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:01,640
Yeah, yeah.

641
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:03,280
Someone in your chances at this point,

642
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:05,520
I'm sure only mind waves cares about it.

643
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:06,960
At this point, the only appropriate action

644
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:08,240
is to bully him.

645
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:11,200
Well, maybe not bully him, maybe just ignore him.

646
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:14,240
Because I think I heard through the grapevine

647
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:16,520
he wrote a manifesto about you, is that true?

648
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:17,760
Yeah, yeah, he did.

649
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:21,120
I asked him for timestamps on like specific things

650
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:23,960
within this interview that I did that he didn't like.

651
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:25,880
And he said he put them,

652
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:28,480
but I've looked at like several sections

653
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:33,480
of this platforming manifesto or whatever.

654
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:40,960
And I don't see it.

655
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:44,520
I think he said that it's in a link in here somewhere,

656
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:47,840
but I'll have to look through the links and stuff and see.

657
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:50,160
So, yeah.

658
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:53,760
So it's not as well made as like a destiny manifesto

659
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:56,360
where like everything's sourced, nothing like that?

660
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:01,120
No, he sources me a bunch.

661
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:03,400
So he sources, yeah.

662
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:07,240
He just makes it all about me,

663
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:10,520
which is like, yeah, really targeted.

664
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:14,480
So, and then he's just been in,

665
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:17,000
he's been kind of dishonest about me, I feel,

666
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:20,160
and mischaracterizing me a whole lot, I feel.

667
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:24,440
Were you guys friends before this?

668
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:26,680
We were friendly, I think, we were friendly.

669
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:30,200
It always sucks when that sort of thing happens

670
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:31,680
and it's over, eh?

671
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:33,520
Yeah, yeah.

672
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:36,080
Because you had a drama with Mr. Girl, didn't you?

673
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:38,320
I only barely knew about this.

674
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:40,440
Were you guys friends before that too?

675
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:42,520
Yeah.

676
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:44,400
Yeah.

677
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:45,240
Oh, geez.

678
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:47,640
Man.

679
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:50,880
It is what it is.

680
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:51,800
Yeah, it always sucks

681
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:52,800
and that's what I think happens, right?

682
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:55,960
Like here, let me tell you a story

683
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:58,120
and it'll be a short story.

684
00:29:58,120 --> 00:29:58,960
Let me tell you a story

685
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:01,640
and see if it sounds familiar to you, okay?

686
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:06,640
So I started doing a podcast with a friend of mine in 2017.

687
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:07,880
All right.

688
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:11,520
We had a good time, you know, we had a good time.

689
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:15,000
But by the time like 2021 rolled around,

690
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:19,800
he had been like hyper radicalized by COVID.

691
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:23,920
He's in the UK and British lockdowns

692
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:26,080
and restrictions were significantly more strict

693
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:27,480
than in America or Canada.

694
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:29,640
And he was also like,

695
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:34,640
he had built up this persona of himself.

696
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:37,440
Well, it wasn't a persona, it was real, it was real.

697
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:38,840
He wasn't faking it.

698
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:40,480
He had like an engineering job

699
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:43,520
and he would like, he'd be flown out by companies

700
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:45,400
that he would work with to go to like,

701
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:46,960
to go to the States, go to Turkey,

702
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:50,000
go to like various places just to do work, right?

703
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,680
And he had a lot of money, he had a lot of travel time.

704
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:56,720
And he kind of built up this image of himself

705
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:58,880
where he would be the guy that would like fly

706
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:02,560
into some foreign place for a job.

707
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:04,400
He'd have some fun there on the side.

708
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:06,680
If he had internet friends there,

709
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:08,680
he'd be the guy that would go and visit

710
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:09,680
and be like, hey, I'm here.

711
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:11,080
And then they'd go to the bar,

712
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:13,520
then he'd like throw some money around.

713
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:14,440
He'd be the center of attention.

714
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:17,240
And then he would fly off.

715
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:21,520
That was kind of the life he had built for himself.

716
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:23,480
And then he was grounded and lost his job

717
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:26,600
and lost everything during COVID lockdowns.

718
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:27,440
He kept his house

719
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:29,280
because he inherited his house from his dad.

720
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:33,840
And then he spent like a year and a half

721
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:37,120
locked down in this house with no job,

722
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:42,120
a pile of cocaine, two trans girlfriends,

723
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:47,240
one of whom was an actual neo-Nazi

724
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:50,080
and the other one who was an anarcho-capitalist.

725
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:55,080
And so he's got these two GIFs

726
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:57,440
doing lines of Coke off his dick.

727
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:01,160
And they're like reading him all of this crazy,

728
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:02,960
this crazy political theory.

729
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,160
And this guy radicalizes like fucking crazy.

730
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:11,000
And as he radicalizes, I don't.

731
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,560
Sargon does, but not nearly as much

732
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:13,960
and not for the same reasons.

733
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:16,920
Arch doesn't, V doesn't, Kibbe doesn't.

734
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:21,800
None of us in our circle radicalize at all, really.

735
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:25,040
And he gets to the point where he's so fucking lost

736
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:27,960
and he's so fed up with all of us

737
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:29,640
that he leaks all of our DMs.

738
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:33,440
And it was a huge drama on our side of the internet.

739
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:34,960
And so we all cut him out.

740
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:37,240
We kicked him out of our private circle.

741
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:38,560
I stopped the podcast with him.

742
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:41,120
It was a big fucking blowout.

743
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:46,120
But like I've heard that story repeated so many times.

744
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:50,680
Like I think Destiny had a podcast with someone

745
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:52,060
like five years ago that blew up

746
00:32:52,060 --> 00:32:53,960
because like he got backstabbed.

747
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:55,640
Destiny got backstabbed by Mr. Girl,

748
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:57,600
like backstabbed by Vaush and Hassan.

749
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:01,760
Like Sargon has been backstabbed by people several times.

750
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:06,760
Like it just seems to be a thing in these online spaces

751
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:08,360
where there are just some people

752
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:10,780
who for whatever reason can't handle it.

753
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:12,960
And then they, like it gets into,

754
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:14,700
it turns into like high school drama.

755
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:15,800
You know what I mean?

756
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:18,160
Yeah.

757
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:19,000
I think so.

758
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:19,820
And it doesn't matter like,

759
00:33:19,820 --> 00:33:22,340
it doesn't matter what political side we're talking about

760
00:33:22,340 --> 00:33:26,120
or what groups, what, it doesn't matter any of it

761
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:29,300
because they all seem to happen like roughly the same way.

762
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:30,140
You know?

763
00:33:30,140 --> 00:33:30,960
Yeah.

764
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:34,640
So fuck, you know, I know the feeling

765
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:36,880
of like thinking that you're friends with someone

766
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:38,480
and then like watching it all just blow up

767
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:41,120
because they put the knife right in your back.

768
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,220
You know what I mean?

769
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:43,560
Yeah, yeah.

770
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:44,840
It's never a good feeling.

771
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:48,200
But also like making a misjudgment yourself, right?

772
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:52,880
Making a misjudgment on somebody's intentions

773
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:57,220
or whether they're capable of treating you a certain way.

774
00:33:58,160 --> 00:34:03,160
It also changes like your sureness in the future on things.

775
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:09,760
Yeah, yeah, that's for sure.

776
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:12,360
Like I spent like a year giving him

777
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:13,600
the benefit of the doubt.

778
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:19,600
And he just didn't go anywhere, you know?

779
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:21,000
And Sargon's been backstabbed enough

780
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:24,560
that like he really doesn't want to like,

781
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:26,900
he has like his business going, he has his employees,

782
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:29,000
he has his friends, and I'm just like,

783
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,560
hey, Sargon, you should talk and also aerate sometime

784
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:33,160
because she's actually really cool even though you guys

785
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:34,440
would obviously disagree on a lot of things.

786
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:36,560
Like she's good faith and she's intelligent

787
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:38,560
and you guys have a good conversation.

788
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:42,400
I've been like, sorry, you should talk to Taftach

789
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:44,320
because Taftach is like a right winger

790
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:46,200
and she's read neoreactionary literature

791
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:47,040
which you've been reading

792
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:48,620
and like you guys have a decent conversation.

793
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:52,420
And like Sargon's been very like cautious

794
00:34:52,420 --> 00:34:55,940
about talking to new people because he's had so many people

795
00:34:55,940 --> 00:34:58,960
just knife him in the back, you know what I mean?

796
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:01,580
Yeah, yeah, for sure.

797
00:35:01,580 --> 00:35:03,420
Someone in the chat says, who cares about Sargon?

798
00:35:03,420 --> 00:35:05,340
Sargon's made his comeback, man.

799
00:35:05,340 --> 00:35:06,180
Like for real.

800
00:35:06,180 --> 00:35:07,540
Yeah, it seems like he's doing well.

801
00:35:07,540 --> 00:35:10,360
Yeah, he doesn't use the Sargon channel anymore

802
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:15,360
but he opened up a news outlet called the Lotus Eaters

803
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:20,920
and his couple of channels are doing really well.

804
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:22,160
He has some associated YouTube channels

805
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:24,400
are doing very well, but like his website is booming.

806
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:25,840
He's got like a dozen employees

807
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:27,040
and they're all like making,

808
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:29,040
they're all writing articles, they're all doing research.

809
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:31,360
Like, no, Sargon's doing very well.

810
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:33,560
He just doesn't call himself Sargon anymore.

811
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:37,480
Yeah, damn.

812
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:38,320
Yeah, I know.

813
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:40,120
It was so weird to have him covering stuff

814
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:40,980
that I was involved in.

815
00:35:40,980 --> 00:35:43,120
I was like, bro, what the fuck?

816
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:43,960
But yeah.

817
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:44,800
What was that?

818
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:46,080
What did he cover?

819
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:48,400
It was the Ana stuff.

820
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:49,560
Oh yeah.

821
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,040
He had no idea what was going on.

822
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:53,860
He was like calling me like a leftist

823
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:56,400
who's incapable of seeing their own flaws.

824
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:57,760
And I was like, damn bro,

825
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:00,720
like you got all that from Ana crying about me.

826
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:03,760
Like, yeah.

827
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:05,640
I didn't see, I think I've heard,

828
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:10,640
like I heard that the take on the Ana stuff

829
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:13,920
that he gave on the Lotus Eaters podcast was not great

830
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:16,920
but also because he doesn't follow the drama, right?

831
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:17,760
Yeah.

832
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:18,600
He doesn't follow any of that drama.

833
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:20,160
And I'm like, dude, what the fuck are you doing?

834
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:23,520
He just used it to like virtue signal essentially,

835
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:24,360
in my opinion.

836
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:30,160
See, even though Sargon's my friend,

837
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:33,820
I still like disagree with a lot of the stuff

838
00:36:33,820 --> 00:36:36,760
that they put out over in the Lotus Eaters.

839
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:39,280
I only really agree with it about half the time, you know?

840
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:40,680
Like a lot of times I'm like, no, Sargon.

841
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:42,560
But here's the thing, we're still friends, right?

842
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:45,680
Like I've had very, very spirited debates with him

843
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:49,000
in private over whatever, like many topics, right?

844
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,720
But we're still friends at the end of the day

845
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:52,560
because there's this understanding that like,

846
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:54,980
even though we're having this fight,

847
00:36:54,980 --> 00:36:57,200
there's still the meta ethic of the friendship

848
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:59,480
that remains intact and you don't attack that.

849
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:00,680
You can have the debate,

850
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:03,120
but you don't attack the friendship, you know what I mean?

851
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:08,500
Yeah.

852
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:12,440
And it seems like a lot of people just don't do that.

853
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:14,000
They just don't.

854
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,960
They think that having a disagreement means

855
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:17,960
that you're not friends anymore.

856
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:19,320
It's like, what the fuck?

857
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:20,160
Yeah, I mean-

858
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:23,420
We're not 16 anymore, guys, like come on.

859
00:37:23,420 --> 00:37:24,760
I don't necessarily think that,

860
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:29,760
but I think when somebody is like talking down to you

861
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:33,400
on a regular basis and like talking over you

862
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:41,360
and like mischaracterizing you in really public places,

863
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:46,000
I think that really does degrade a friendship, so.

864
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:48,560
Yeah, yeah, it does.

865
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:51,080
Especially if it's not like a joke, right?

866
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:52,560
Yeah.

867
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:56,600
Like I will publicly degrade Kibs every chance I get,

868
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:58,440
but we both know we're joking, you know?

869
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:00,320
Yeah, yeah.

870
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:03,880
That always sucks.

871
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:04,720
Yeah, that's okay then.

872
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:08,960
And you know what, like if the stuff with Mr. Girl

873
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:12,320
and then with Mind Waves has contributed in large part

874
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:15,680
to your recent malaise, I wouldn't be surprised

875
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:19,180
because to be honest, I took like, after my backstab,

876
00:38:19,180 --> 00:38:20,020
I took like a month off.

877
00:38:20,020 --> 00:38:22,080
I was like, I'm getting the fuck offline for a while.

878
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:23,640
Like, I'm just getting out of here, man.

879
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:24,800
I'm just piecing.

880
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:27,520
I'm doing some IRL stuff and I needed it to be honest.

881
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:28,640
I needed it.

882
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:30,280
Yeah, yeah.

883
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:31,900
Yeah, well, we'll see.

884
00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:35,320
I mean, you know, there's multiple compounding factors

885
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:40,320
and stuff, but I think I had majority of my dip

886
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:42,040
like the past couple of months

887
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:43,420
and I think I'm coming out of it now.

888
00:38:43,420 --> 00:38:45,440
So I'm really happy about that.

889
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:46,280
That's good.

890
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:47,120
That's good.

891
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:47,960
Yeah, coming out of it.

892
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:49,760
Everyone comes out of it eventually, you know?

893
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:51,800
Yeah, yeah, I think so.

894
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:53,360
Well, thank you for speaking with me.

895
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:56,000
Is there anything else that you wanted to talk about or?

896
00:38:57,320 --> 00:38:59,520
Nothing I can think of off the top of my head.

897
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:01,480
Okay.

898
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:04,240
I've been here for like half an hour, 45 minutes.

899
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:08,920
Then watching me sell flag light as usual, so yeah.

900
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:11,760
That's long enough for me to turn into a clip

901
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:14,320
on my channel, ha ha ha ha ha.

902
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:15,160
Nice.

903
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:19,160
Listen, everyone who's watching this on my channel,

904
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:20,880
you know, in the next couple of days, whenever it goes out,

905
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:23,440
make sure to go sub to Stardust, okay?

906
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:24,400
Yeah, thank you.

907
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:25,840
Yeah.

908
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:27,020
Anyway, thanks for talking.

909
00:39:27,020 --> 00:39:27,860
I'll see you later, okay?

910
00:39:27,860 --> 00:39:28,680
Yeah, see you later.

911
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:29,520
Thanks for talking.

912
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:31,120
I really appreciate it.

913
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:32,000
Yeah, no problem.

914
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:32,840
Bye.
