00:00.000 --> 00:09.920
I've been trying to figure out why I like Destiny so much recently, and I really do

00:09.920 --> 00:15.860
think it all stems from that one part in the most recent Vaush vs Destiny debate where

00:15.860 --> 00:44.260
Destiny says, I try to live my principles.

00:44.260 --> 00:48.340
I think that it would be unethical for me to maximize my existence in a capitalist society.

00:48.340 --> 00:51.300
I've turned down a lot of money for stuff that would maximize my existence in a capitalist

00:51.300 --> 00:53.860
society, because I think it's unethical to do so. I don't agree that, like,

00:55.140 --> 00:57.860
because it doesn't further what I believe in, and it doesn't further what you've turned down.

00:58.420 --> 01:02.580
I've turned down a ton of fucking gambling sponsorships. There was so much money flying

01:02.580 --> 01:06.420
around in the CSGO skin days. There was so much of that shit that I fucking turned down.

01:07.220 --> 01:11.620
Okay, good. And you've turned down, and I, for my part, have turned down every sponsorship,

01:11.620 --> 01:15.220
because it's not a part of my aesthetic. I don't want to.

01:15.220 --> 01:22.660
Okay, wait, then don't make those things the same. Wait, wait, don't compare that to me, okay?

01:22.660 --> 01:27.860
In my opinion, this is where he really caught Vaush in the hypocrisy. If Vaush is willing to

01:27.860 --> 01:33.380
say that the most egregious parts of capitalism, from his point of view obviously, are not as bad

01:33.380 --> 01:39.060
simply because it's a socialist who's doing it, and therefore there's no actual obligation for

01:39.060 --> 01:43.460
a socialist to live by their principles. And, you know, start a worker co-op, or pay people

01:43.460 --> 01:47.460
at higher than normal rates for the market, or rent out property at lower than normal rates for

01:47.460 --> 01:52.980
the market. If a socialist simply behaves the same as every other capitalist, and Vaush considers

01:52.980 --> 01:56.660
that better just because they're a socialist, then there's no actual principles there. It's

01:56.660 --> 02:02.100
just tribalism. Abstinence, in one sense, is you just stand by and you watch a person drown.

02:02.100 --> 02:06.420
And abstinence, which is negative. And abstinence, in the business sense, is you just stand by and

02:06.420 --> 02:11.540
you watch another business open up and exploit workers. Which would be neutral, but the death

02:11.540 --> 02:17.060
is negative. How is that? Okay, I never ever ever want you to say again that, like, capitalism is

02:17.060 --> 02:21.300
negative, or business owners are bad, because you understand my argument enough. I guess not,

02:21.300 --> 02:25.140
because you've bit the neutral bullet on basically every single actor in a capitalist system. And

02:25.140 --> 02:29.780
since that moment, I've been watching more and more Destiny, and I've realized that even when

02:29.780 --> 02:35.300
I disagree with him, I can respect him because I do think he actually believes what he's saying.

02:35.300 --> 02:40.260
And, you know, a couple years ago I thought he was completely out to lunch. So, hey, maybe that's

02:40.260 --> 02:44.980
how you actually convince people to at least listen to you, is to, you know, be honest, be

02:44.980 --> 02:50.660
sincere. What I'm getting to, though, is that in a previous video, I mentioned that this difference

02:50.660 --> 02:55.620
between Destiny and Vaush is why I thought, and still do think, that Vaush is a grifter.

02:55.620 --> 03:00.340
He misunderstood that comment. He thought that I was saying he was a fake leftist.

03:01.300 --> 03:23.300
But the truth is, I wasn't saying that at all. Vaush is absolutely 100%

03:24.260 --> 03:29.780
the most real leftist out there. It's just that leftism itself is the grift.

03:29.780 --> 03:34.660
How many breadtubers and leftytubers and whatever else do you need to see who are explicitly not

03:34.660 --> 03:38.580
living by their principles? How many of them do you need to encounter before you realize that

03:38.580 --> 03:41.860
something's actually up here? The only one out of all of them that I actually think

03:41.860 --> 03:46.820
runs their channel like a worker co-op, for example, is the serfs. Vaush certainly doesn't

03:46.820 --> 03:51.380
do it, and whenever he's asked, he runs himself in circles trying to explain why. You think Contra

03:51.380 --> 03:56.500
does it? Hell, how about Philosophy Tube, the whole thing that started the debate between

03:56.500 --> 04:01.060
Vaush and Destiny in the first place, where Philosophy Tube was indirectly calling for some

04:01.060 --> 04:06.500
kind of rent strike action with rhetoric like, we need to rise up, even though I promise you

04:06.500 --> 04:11.300
that YouTube channel is pulling in a lot of money. There is definitely this feeling that I get

04:11.300 --> 04:16.900
regarding all these champagne socialists who talk about revolutions while simply taking the paycheck

04:16.900 --> 04:21.780
and not actually doing anything themselves to further their cause. But it's not just Destiny.

04:21.780 --> 04:27.060
Even if you don't like Sargon, you have to admit, he started a company, he's hired six people,

04:27.060 --> 04:32.180
he is a liberal, and he's running his business on those liberal principles. And you know what? All

04:32.180 --> 04:36.900
of those people seem to be actually doing well because of it. Their lives seem to be better

04:36.900 --> 04:41.620
working for the Lotus Eaters rather than doing whatever it was they were doing before. And hell,

04:41.620 --> 04:46.180
look at Kraut. Even if you don't like Kraut, you should go check out his, I don't even know what to

04:46.180 --> 04:52.180
call it, Workers Manifesto? Basically Kraut wrote down and made public how he intends to operate his

04:52.180 --> 04:56.820
business in the future, since it being a YouTube channel, it's run primarily on ad revenue and

04:56.820 --> 05:02.500
donations. And in it, he points out that he plans to live by his principles as well. He intends to

05:02.500 --> 05:08.020
give everyone working under him a living wage. The excess money will go into making his content

05:08.020 --> 05:13.140
higher quality. He will not complain about having to pay taxes like Hassan Piker and others. And he

05:13.140 --> 05:17.700
even changed his private discord where this happens to be called Workers Union. I'm not sure

05:17.700 --> 05:22.260
if people under him actually have a union or not, but I do know just from personally talking to

05:22.260 --> 05:27.700
Kraut that he intends to treat them fairly. This is what living your principles is. It costs money.

05:27.700 --> 05:32.900
But you know what? It makes those working for you have better lives. In turn, they are likely to

05:32.900 --> 05:37.780
create a better product. And then you yourself, as the owner of the business, you profit in the long

05:37.780 --> 05:43.220
term too. And for all of the screaming and crying about the socialist revolution that comes out of

05:43.220 --> 05:48.100
BreadTube, they are absolutely unwilling to actually live their principles. Additionally,

05:48.100 --> 05:54.020
if for some reason you were curious whether or not I live my principles, the answer is I try to

05:54.020 --> 05:58.740
the best that I can. I have never hidden from you where the money that you guys so generously give

05:58.740 --> 06:03.780
me actually goes to. Yes, I'm paying for food and rent and other essential bills. I'm also paying

06:03.780 --> 06:08.260
the artists who work for me. And I do reinvest back into the channel, though at this point I

06:08.260 --> 06:12.340
only need to buy one CPU and then I think I'm good for equipment. That doesn't mean I've been perfect

06:12.340 --> 06:16.180
though. For example, recently there was kind of a scandal that you may not know about if you're not

06:16.180 --> 06:20.740
in my discord or follow my Twitch, where my roommate who has worked on the show before, he

06:20.740 --> 06:25.540
found himself in some financial and potentially legal trouble. And so because he works with me on

06:25.540 --> 06:31.220
the channel sometimes, people gave a shit ton of donations on the Twitch channel that we both co-host

06:31.220 --> 06:36.260
hoping to help him out in a hard time. And now for reasons that I'm not going to get into,

06:36.260 --> 06:40.500
he hasn't been on the channel in about a month and a half. And people are starting to ask me,

06:40.500 --> 06:45.700
hey, we gave all this money to help him out. Where is he? And the honest truth is I have no answer.

06:45.700 --> 06:49.780
And personally, I feel kind of bad that like people gave money that ended up being under

06:49.780 --> 06:55.060
false pretenses and I can refund it if you really want, but it will go towards the channel in some

06:55.060 --> 06:59.380
form or another. It's just one of those situations where I feel kind of bad about it. But even though

06:59.380 --> 07:04.260
I'm not perfect, I do try to live my principles and not lie to you about where your money goes.

07:04.260 --> 07:10.420
In a previous video, I talked about where the Black Lives Matter money goes. When you donate

07:10.420 --> 07:14.900
to, I think it's blacklivesmatter.com or .org or something, it goes into a Democratic slush fund,

07:14.900 --> 07:19.300
gets laundered around a bit, and then ends up in the pockets of people like this. Atlanta

07:19.300 --> 07:27.060
activist spent $200,000 in Black Lives Matter donations on his house and personal expenses.

07:27.060 --> 07:31.860
The FBI has arrested the founder of a Black Lives Matter group in Atlanta on

07:31.860 --> 07:37.940
fraud and money laundering charges. And more recently, Black Lives Matter co-founder Patrice

07:37.940 --> 07:46.660
Con Colors lands Topanga Canyon compound for $1.4 million, 2,400 square feet, three bedrooms,

07:46.660 --> 07:51.860
two bathrooms, plus one bed, one bath guest house in Topanga Canyon, Los Angeles. This place,

07:51.860 --> 07:57.700
by the way, it's pretty beautiful. The only way this house is getting bought is with that

07:57.700 --> 08:02.980
race grifter money, you know? Laughing all the way to the fucking bank. Remember, Patrice Con

08:02.980 --> 08:08.980
Colors was the woman who said this. We actually do have an ideological frame. Myself and Alicia

08:08.980 --> 08:19.860
in particular are trained organizers. We are trained Marxists. We are super

08:22.420 --> 08:28.660
versed on sort of ideological theories. This is how it always goes with people who are

08:28.660 --> 08:34.980
super versed in Marxist theory. They do not redistribute wealth or power, they simply

08:34.980 --> 08:40.820
centralize it. Now, on a moral level, I'm not against the idea of somebody getting rich,

08:40.820 --> 08:45.060
even if it's through something ridiculous like this, and then buying themselves a nice house.

08:45.060 --> 08:49.780
But if you're like a true socialist, a true believer in Black Lives Matter, you have to

08:49.780 --> 08:56.420
be looking at this with disgust right now. With egg on your face, in fact, for even contributing

08:56.420 --> 09:04.020
one cent of your own money to this mess. While I was editing the video, this article showed up.

09:04.020 --> 09:10.260
Inside, BLM co-founder Patrice Con Colors' million-dollar real estate buying binge.

09:10.260 --> 09:14.420
As protests broke out across the country in the name of Black Lives Matter,

09:14.420 --> 09:20.580
the group's co-founder went on a real estate buying binge, snagging four high-end homes.

09:20.580 --> 09:25.460
So it's not just one anymore, guys. It's not just the one that I showed pictures of. She was eyeing

09:25.460 --> 09:31.780
property in the Bahamas, and there's also luxury apartments and townhouses alongside that LA home.

09:31.780 --> 09:37.940
Here's her home in Georgia. It's quite the indoor pool. Here's her house in Englewood, California.

09:37.940 --> 09:43.700
And here's a place in South LA. I have heard so many socialists tell me that it should be

09:43.700 --> 09:49.940
illegal for people to own multiple homes. And yet, here is a socialist who has the means to do so,

09:50.500 --> 09:54.660
absolutely buying that shit up. The hypocrisy is incredible.

09:54.660 --> 09:58.740
Also, while I was editing this video, I was tipped off about another instance like this.

09:58.740 --> 10:03.300
It's obviously not to the same scale as the whole owning four homes thing, but you can see this to

10:03.300 --> 10:07.620
different levels all over the place on the left. When the George Floyd protests happened, the blog

10:07.620 --> 10:15.300
Stefano.me posted a big list of black-owned kawaii brands. So basically, if you're looking for

10:15.300 --> 10:20.900
original hyper cute anime style art, lolita fashion, and other Japanese type stuff, there are

10:20.900 --> 10:26.660
many shops out there that do that sort of thing. And since 2020 was the big push of support black

10:26.660 --> 10:31.540
businesses, here's a list of them. One that I want to point out here is called Otaku Apparel.

10:31.540 --> 10:37.700
It's Otaku Apparel, I guess. It's based in Houston, Texas, and offers cute, colorful apparel

10:37.700 --> 10:43.940
and accessories in multiple sizes. In October 9th, 2020, the owner of Otaku says, I'm going to have

10:43.940 --> 10:48.900
to close the store down for a couple months to catch up on all my orders. Please read the full

10:48.900 --> 10:54.820
post for additional information. Now that was what, six months ago? Check out these comments.

10:54.820 --> 11:00.740
I've sent multiple emails in September, October, January, and now with no response. Could you

11:00.740 --> 11:06.740
please provide official communication or status updates? I ordered on June 5th. It's too late to

11:06.740 --> 11:10.660
do a chargeback. I would like to be either refunded or get the stuff that was purchased.

11:10.660 --> 11:15.140
I love how you lied on your friend's post saying that you would finally address us

11:15.140 --> 11:20.100
as the brand owner, only to go back into hiding for another two weeks on top of the four months

11:20.100 --> 11:26.340
of ghosting us. I placed an order in September of 2020 and waited until January to inquire.

11:26.340 --> 11:31.780
Still haven't received a reply or any update of any kind. Just so y'all know, the owner will

11:31.780 --> 11:38.340
not respond to emails and said no June refunds because your money was unknowingly donated to

11:38.340 --> 11:44.180
Black Lives Matter. Make your disputes with the bank if you can. No refunds or cancellations.

11:44.180 --> 11:48.660
Same thing on her Instagram. I ordered from you back in July and never got what I paid for.

11:48.660 --> 11:53.380
Why you scamming people? Come on now. I ordered from your place in June. I tried to be

11:53.380 --> 11:57.940
understanding but it's literally almost a year and no updates. It's more frustrating on our end

11:57.940 --> 12:02.980
because we spent our own money. Socialists do not respect the concept of money. Therefore,

12:02.980 --> 12:07.860
you should not expect them to be responsible with yours. And this isn't new. It's been going on for

12:07.860 --> 12:12.820
a while. In Manning Johnson's book, Color, Communism, and Common Sense, where he talks

12:12.820 --> 12:16.740
about both the race grifters and the commie grifters, he writes,

12:42.820 --> 13:11.460
And I think, in a separate video,

13:11.460 --> 13:14.900
I brought up this very old quote, but I'll do it again just to make sure we're all on

13:14.900 --> 13:20.100
the same page here. These are the words of Booker T. Washington from an era long before

13:20.100 --> 13:22.100
any of the things we're talking about today.

13:41.620 --> 13:45.060
Some of these people do not want the negro to lose his grievances,

13:45.060 --> 13:50.020
because they do not want to lose their jobs. We see this everywhere. The feminists in academia

13:50.020 --> 13:54.340
do not actually want to solve any gender problems that may exist, because then they would be out of

13:54.340 --> 13:58.500
a job. The race hustlers do not want to solve any race problems that may actually exist,

13:58.500 --> 14:01.700
because then they would be out of a job. And the breadtubers? I think most of all,

14:01.700 --> 14:05.700
they definitely want to keep the grift going. These are people who have built an entire

14:05.700 --> 14:12.020
industry and now profit off of identity politics. And no, no, there is no identity

14:12.020 --> 14:16.260
politics on the right. Identity politics is a very specific thing. I know people on Twitter,

14:16.260 --> 14:19.540
I know breadtubers, I know streamers, all these people who say, the right's idpol,

14:19.540 --> 14:23.540
they also love it, no no no no, you misunderstand. What you're talking about is just tribalism,

14:23.540 --> 14:28.420
okay? There is definitely race tribalism, gender tribalism, class tribalism,

14:28.420 --> 14:33.380
political affiliation tribalism, identifying with a group, or talking for that group collectively,

14:33.380 --> 14:38.260
or something like that. That's not idpol, that's just tribalism. Identity politics is a very

14:38.260 --> 14:43.700
specific thing. And yes, it is uniquely leftist if we are using the left-right binary, because it

14:43.700 --> 14:50.260
comes out of a 1960s French intellectual movement that repurposed Marxist analysis for group

14:50.260 --> 14:55.220
dynamics other than class. So when the Marxists look at the proletariat and the bourgeoisie,

14:55.220 --> 15:01.380
the new left, meaning leftism from 1960s onwards, takes that framework and applies it to things like

15:01.380 --> 15:07.220
race and gender. That's what idpol is. The right wing of politics for all of their many problems

15:07.220 --> 15:13.060
do not engage in idpol. They do engage in tribalism, but not identity politics.

15:13.060 --> 15:19.140
And this is what makes the left, specifically, a giant grift. It doesn't matter if you're

15:19.140 --> 15:24.100
Robin DiAngelo publishing White Fragility, it doesn't matter if you're Patrice Khan Colors

15:24.100 --> 15:27.780
buying a giant house using your Black Lives Matter money, it doesn't matter if you're a

15:27.780 --> 15:31.460
breadtuber raking in donations while never actually living your principles.

15:31.460 --> 15:36.980
What connects these separate types of leftism together is their grifting nature. They're

15:36.980 --> 15:41.460
fundamentally anti-individual, which is by the way why they're an anti-individual solution for

15:41.460 --> 15:46.100
your life's problems, and instead talk about collective solutions, collective action,

15:46.100 --> 15:50.900
stuff like this. The implication there is that you can't actually fix what's wrong with your life,

15:50.900 --> 15:55.780
you have to be part of a collective that gets it done. Of course, they just so happen to have

15:55.780 --> 15:59.220
the entry to that collective, and it's not going to cost you very much to join.

15:59.220 --> 16:02.740
It's the exact same kind of thing that cults and super churches do on the right.

16:02.740 --> 16:07.940
Those are also grifts. They will sell you spiritual salvation for the low price of 1999.

16:07.940 --> 16:11.860
The left will sell you material salvation for the same price. Does this mean that I consider

16:11.860 --> 16:17.700
the right to also be a grift? Um, yeah. But at that point it really depends on what you mean by

16:17.700 --> 16:22.180
left and right. From where I'm standing, the center seems to be the only non-grift position

16:22.180 --> 16:26.180
on the traditional French Revolution era spectrum, where you'll find the classical

16:26.180 --> 16:31.300
liberals and some of the libertarians as well. But outside of the center, the rest of politics

16:31.300 --> 16:35.700
is just a toll booth. Though this applies to both the left and the right, it's most prominent with

16:35.700 --> 16:41.140
socialism. Come on in, we'll fix things, guys, everything will be better. Also, pay at the door.
