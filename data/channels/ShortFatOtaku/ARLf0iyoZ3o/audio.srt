1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,920
I've been trying to figure out why I like Destiny so much recently, and I really do

2
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:15,860
think it all stems from that one part in the most recent Vaush vs Destiny debate where

3
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:44,260
Destiny says, I try to live my principles.

4
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:48,340
I think that it would be unethical for me to maximize my existence in a capitalist society.

5
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:51,300
I've turned down a lot of money for stuff that would maximize my existence in a capitalist

6
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:53,860
society, because I think it's unethical to do so. I don't agree that, like,

7
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:57,860
because it doesn't further what I believe in, and it doesn't further what you've turned down.

8
00:00:58,420 --> 00:01:02,580
I've turned down a ton of fucking gambling sponsorships. There was so much money flying

9
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:06,420
around in the CSGO skin days. There was so much of that shit that I fucking turned down.

10
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:11,620
Okay, good. And you've turned down, and I, for my part, have turned down every sponsorship,

11
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:15,220
because it's not a part of my aesthetic. I don't want to.

12
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:22,660
Okay, wait, then don't make those things the same. Wait, wait, don't compare that to me, okay?

13
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:27,860
In my opinion, this is where he really caught Vaush in the hypocrisy. If Vaush is willing to

14
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:33,380
say that the most egregious parts of capitalism, from his point of view obviously, are not as bad

15
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:39,060
simply because it's a socialist who's doing it, and therefore there's no actual obligation for

16
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:43,460
a socialist to live by their principles. And, you know, start a worker co-op, or pay people

17
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:47,460
at higher than normal rates for the market, or rent out property at lower than normal rates for

18
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:52,980
the market. If a socialist simply behaves the same as every other capitalist, and Vaush considers

19
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:56,660
that better just because they're a socialist, then there's no actual principles there. It's

20
00:01:56,660 --> 00:02:02,100
just tribalism. Abstinence, in one sense, is you just stand by and you watch a person drown.

21
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:06,420
And abstinence, which is negative. And abstinence, in the business sense, is you just stand by and

22
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:11,540
you watch another business open up and exploit workers. Which would be neutral, but the death

23
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:17,060
is negative. How is that? Okay, I never ever ever want you to say again that, like, capitalism is

24
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:21,300
negative, or business owners are bad, because you understand my argument enough. I guess not,

25
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:25,140
because you've bit the neutral bullet on basically every single actor in a capitalist system. And

26
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:29,780
since that moment, I've been watching more and more Destiny, and I've realized that even when

27
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:35,300
I disagree with him, I can respect him because I do think he actually believes what he's saying.

28
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:40,260
And, you know, a couple years ago I thought he was completely out to lunch. So, hey, maybe that's

29
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:44,980
how you actually convince people to at least listen to you, is to, you know, be honest, be

30
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:50,660
sincere. What I'm getting to, though, is that in a previous video, I mentioned that this difference

31
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:55,620
between Destiny and Vaush is why I thought, and still do think, that Vaush is a grifter.

32
00:02:55,620 --> 00:03:00,340
He misunderstood that comment. He thought that I was saying he was a fake leftist.

33
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:23,300
But the truth is, I wasn't saying that at all. Vaush is absolutely 100%

34
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:29,780
the most real leftist out there. It's just that leftism itself is the grift.

35
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:34,660
How many breadtubers and leftytubers and whatever else do you need to see who are explicitly not

36
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:38,580
living by their principles? How many of them do you need to encounter before you realize that

37
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:41,860
something's actually up here? The only one out of all of them that I actually think

38
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:46,820
runs their channel like a worker co-op, for example, is the serfs. Vaush certainly doesn't

39
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:51,380
do it, and whenever he's asked, he runs himself in circles trying to explain why. You think Contra

40
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:56,500
does it? Hell, how about Philosophy Tube, the whole thing that started the debate between

41
00:03:56,500 --> 00:04:01,060
Vaush and Destiny in the first place, where Philosophy Tube was indirectly calling for some

42
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:06,500
kind of rent strike action with rhetoric like, we need to rise up, even though I promise you

43
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:11,300
that YouTube channel is pulling in a lot of money. There is definitely this feeling that I get

44
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:16,900
regarding all these champagne socialists who talk about revolutions while simply taking the paycheck

45
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:21,780
and not actually doing anything themselves to further their cause. But it's not just Destiny.

46
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:27,060
Even if you don't like Sargon, you have to admit, he started a company, he's hired six people,

47
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:32,180
he is a liberal, and he's running his business on those liberal principles. And you know what? All

48
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:36,900
of those people seem to be actually doing well because of it. Their lives seem to be better

49
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:41,620
working for the Lotus Eaters rather than doing whatever it was they were doing before. And hell,

50
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:46,180
look at Kraut. Even if you don't like Kraut, you should go check out his, I don't even know what to

51
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:52,180
call it, Workers Manifesto? Basically Kraut wrote down and made public how he intends to operate his

52
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:56,820
business in the future, since it being a YouTube channel, it's run primarily on ad revenue and

53
00:04:56,820 --> 00:05:02,500
donations. And in it, he points out that he plans to live by his principles as well. He intends to

54
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:08,020
give everyone working under him a living wage. The excess money will go into making his content

55
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:13,140
higher quality. He will not complain about having to pay taxes like Hassan Piker and others. And he

56
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:17,700
even changed his private discord where this happens to be called Workers Union. I'm not sure

57
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:22,260
if people under him actually have a union or not, but I do know just from personally talking to

58
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:27,700
Kraut that he intends to treat them fairly. This is what living your principles is. It costs money.

59
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:32,900
But you know what? It makes those working for you have better lives. In turn, they are likely to

60
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:37,780
create a better product. And then you yourself, as the owner of the business, you profit in the long

61
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:43,220
term too. And for all of the screaming and crying about the socialist revolution that comes out of

62
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:48,100
BreadTube, they are absolutely unwilling to actually live their principles. Additionally,

63
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:54,020
if for some reason you were curious whether or not I live my principles, the answer is I try to

64
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:58,740
the best that I can. I have never hidden from you where the money that you guys so generously give

65
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:03,780
me actually goes to. Yes, I'm paying for food and rent and other essential bills. I'm also paying

66
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:08,260
the artists who work for me. And I do reinvest back into the channel, though at this point I

67
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:12,340
only need to buy one CPU and then I think I'm good for equipment. That doesn't mean I've been perfect

68
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:16,180
though. For example, recently there was kind of a scandal that you may not know about if you're not

69
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:20,740
in my discord or follow my Twitch, where my roommate who has worked on the show before, he

70
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:25,540
found himself in some financial and potentially legal trouble. And so because he works with me on

71
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:31,220
the channel sometimes, people gave a shit ton of donations on the Twitch channel that we both co-host

72
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:36,260
hoping to help him out in a hard time. And now for reasons that I'm not going to get into,

73
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:40,500
he hasn't been on the channel in about a month and a half. And people are starting to ask me,

74
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:45,700
hey, we gave all this money to help him out. Where is he? And the honest truth is I have no answer.

75
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:49,780
And personally, I feel kind of bad that like people gave money that ended up being under

76
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:55,060
false pretenses and I can refund it if you really want, but it will go towards the channel in some

77
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:59,380
form or another. It's just one of those situations where I feel kind of bad about it. But even though

78
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:04,260
I'm not perfect, I do try to live my principles and not lie to you about where your money goes.

79
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:10,420
In a previous video, I talked about where the Black Lives Matter money goes. When you donate

80
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:14,900
to, I think it's blacklivesmatter.com or .org or something, it goes into a Democratic slush fund,

81
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:19,300
gets laundered around a bit, and then ends up in the pockets of people like this. Atlanta

82
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:27,060
activist spent $200,000 in Black Lives Matter donations on his house and personal expenses.

83
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:31,860
The FBI has arrested the founder of a Black Lives Matter group in Atlanta on

84
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:37,940
fraud and money laundering charges. And more recently, Black Lives Matter co-founder Patrice

85
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:46,660
Con Colors lands Topanga Canyon compound for $1.4 million, 2,400 square feet, three bedrooms,

86
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:51,860
two bathrooms, plus one bed, one bath guest house in Topanga Canyon, Los Angeles. This place,

87
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:57,700
by the way, it's pretty beautiful. The only way this house is getting bought is with that

88
00:07:57,700 --> 00:08:02,980
race grifter money, you know? Laughing all the way to the fucking bank. Remember, Patrice Con

89
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:08,980
Colors was the woman who said this. We actually do have an ideological frame. Myself and Alicia

90
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:19,860
in particular are trained organizers. We are trained Marxists. We are super

91
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:28,660
versed on sort of ideological theories. This is how it always goes with people who are

92
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:34,980
super versed in Marxist theory. They do not redistribute wealth or power, they simply

93
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:40,820
centralize it. Now, on a moral level, I'm not against the idea of somebody getting rich,

94
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:45,060
even if it's through something ridiculous like this, and then buying themselves a nice house.

95
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:49,780
But if you're like a true socialist, a true believer in Black Lives Matter, you have to

96
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:56,420
be looking at this with disgust right now. With egg on your face, in fact, for even contributing

97
00:08:56,420 --> 00:09:04,020
one cent of your own money to this mess. While I was editing the video, this article showed up.

98
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:10,260
Inside, BLM co-founder Patrice Con Colors' million-dollar real estate buying binge.

99
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:14,420
As protests broke out across the country in the name of Black Lives Matter,

100
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:20,580
the group's co-founder went on a real estate buying binge, snagging four high-end homes.

101
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:25,460
So it's not just one anymore, guys. It's not just the one that I showed pictures of. She was eyeing

102
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:31,780
property in the Bahamas, and there's also luxury apartments and townhouses alongside that LA home.

103
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:37,940
Here's her home in Georgia. It's quite the indoor pool. Here's her house in Englewood, California.

104
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:43,700
And here's a place in South LA. I have heard so many socialists tell me that it should be

105
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:49,940
illegal for people to own multiple homes. And yet, here is a socialist who has the means to do so,

106
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:54,660
absolutely buying that shit up. The hypocrisy is incredible.

107
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:58,740
Also, while I was editing this video, I was tipped off about another instance like this.

108
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:03,300
It's obviously not to the same scale as the whole owning four homes thing, but you can see this to

109
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:07,620
different levels all over the place on the left. When the George Floyd protests happened, the blog

110
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:15,300
Stefano.me posted a big list of black-owned kawaii brands. So basically, if you're looking for

111
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:20,900
original hyper cute anime style art, lolita fashion, and other Japanese type stuff, there are

112
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:26,660
many shops out there that do that sort of thing. And since 2020 was the big push of support black

113
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:31,540
businesses, here's a list of them. One that I want to point out here is called Otaku Apparel.

114
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:37,700
It's Otaku Apparel, I guess. It's based in Houston, Texas, and offers cute, colorful apparel

115
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:43,940
and accessories in multiple sizes. In October 9th, 2020, the owner of Otaku says, I'm going to have

116
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:48,900
to close the store down for a couple months to catch up on all my orders. Please read the full

117
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:54,820
post for additional information. Now that was what, six months ago? Check out these comments.

118
00:10:54,820 --> 00:11:00,740
I've sent multiple emails in September, October, January, and now with no response. Could you

119
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:06,740
please provide official communication or status updates? I ordered on June 5th. It's too late to

120
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:10,660
do a chargeback. I would like to be either refunded or get the stuff that was purchased.

121
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:15,140
I love how you lied on your friend's post saying that you would finally address us

122
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:20,100
as the brand owner, only to go back into hiding for another two weeks on top of the four months

123
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:26,340
of ghosting us. I placed an order in September of 2020 and waited until January to inquire.

124
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:31,780
Still haven't received a reply or any update of any kind. Just so y'all know, the owner will

125
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:38,340
not respond to emails and said no June refunds because your money was unknowingly donated to

126
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:44,180
Black Lives Matter. Make your disputes with the bank if you can. No refunds or cancellations.

127
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:48,660
Same thing on her Instagram. I ordered from you back in July and never got what I paid for.

128
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:53,380
Why you scamming people? Come on now. I ordered from your place in June. I tried to be

129
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:57,940
understanding but it's literally almost a year and no updates. It's more frustrating on our end

130
00:11:57,940 --> 00:12:02,980
because we spent our own money. Socialists do not respect the concept of money. Therefore,

131
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:07,860
you should not expect them to be responsible with yours. And this isn't new. It's been going on for

132
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:12,820
a while. In Manning Johnson's book, Color, Communism, and Common Sense, where he talks

133
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:16,740
about both the race grifters and the commie grifters, he writes,

134
00:12:42,820 --> 00:13:11,460
And I think, in a separate video,

135
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:14,900
I brought up this very old quote, but I'll do it again just to make sure we're all on

136
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:20,100
the same page here. These are the words of Booker T. Washington from an era long before

137
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:22,100
any of the things we're talking about today.

138
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:45,060
Some of these people do not want the negro to lose his grievances,

139
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:50,020
because they do not want to lose their jobs. We see this everywhere. The feminists in academia

140
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:54,340
do not actually want to solve any gender problems that may exist, because then they would be out of

141
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:58,500
a job. The race hustlers do not want to solve any race problems that may actually exist,

142
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:01,700
because then they would be out of a job. And the breadtubers? I think most of all,

143
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:05,700
they definitely want to keep the grift going. These are people who have built an entire

144
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:12,020
industry and now profit off of identity politics. And no, no, there is no identity

145
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:16,260
politics on the right. Identity politics is a very specific thing. I know people on Twitter,

146
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:19,540
I know breadtubers, I know streamers, all these people who say, the right's idpol,

147
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:23,540
they also love it, no no no no, you misunderstand. What you're talking about is just tribalism,

148
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:28,420
okay? There is definitely race tribalism, gender tribalism, class tribalism,

149
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:33,380
political affiliation tribalism, identifying with a group, or talking for that group collectively,

150
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:38,260
or something like that. That's not idpol, that's just tribalism. Identity politics is a very

151
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:43,700
specific thing. And yes, it is uniquely leftist if we are using the left-right binary, because it

152
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:50,260
comes out of a 1960s French intellectual movement that repurposed Marxist analysis for group

153
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:55,220
dynamics other than class. So when the Marxists look at the proletariat and the bourgeoisie,

154
00:14:55,220 --> 00:15:01,380
the new left, meaning leftism from 1960s onwards, takes that framework and applies it to things like

155
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:07,220
race and gender. That's what idpol is. The right wing of politics for all of their many problems

156
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:13,060
do not engage in idpol. They do engage in tribalism, but not identity politics.

157
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:19,140
And this is what makes the left, specifically, a giant grift. It doesn't matter if you're

158
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:24,100
Robin DiAngelo publishing White Fragility, it doesn't matter if you're Patrice Khan Colors

159
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:27,780
buying a giant house using your Black Lives Matter money, it doesn't matter if you're a

160
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:31,460
breadtuber raking in donations while never actually living your principles.

161
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:36,980
What connects these separate types of leftism together is their grifting nature. They're

162
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:41,460
fundamentally anti-individual, which is by the way why they're an anti-individual solution for

163
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:46,100
your life's problems, and instead talk about collective solutions, collective action,

164
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:50,900
stuff like this. The implication there is that you can't actually fix what's wrong with your life,

165
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:55,780
you have to be part of a collective that gets it done. Of course, they just so happen to have

166
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:59,220
the entry to that collective, and it's not going to cost you very much to join.

167
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:02,740
It's the exact same kind of thing that cults and super churches do on the right.

168
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:07,940
Those are also grifts. They will sell you spiritual salvation for the low price of 1999.

169
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:11,860
The left will sell you material salvation for the same price. Does this mean that I consider

170
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:17,700
the right to also be a grift? Um, yeah. But at that point it really depends on what you mean by

171
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:22,180
left and right. From where I'm standing, the center seems to be the only non-grift position

172
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:26,180
on the traditional French Revolution era spectrum, where you'll find the classical

173
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:31,300
liberals and some of the libertarians as well. But outside of the center, the rest of politics

174
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:35,700
is just a toll booth. Though this applies to both the left and the right, it's most prominent with

175
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:41,140
socialism. Come on in, we'll fix things, guys, everything will be better. Also, pay at the door.
