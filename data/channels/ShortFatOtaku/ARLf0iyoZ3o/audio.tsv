0	9920	I've been trying to figure out why I like Destiny so much recently, and I really do
9920	15860	think it all stems from that one part in the most recent Vaush vs Destiny debate where
15860	44260	Destiny says, I try to live my principles.
44260	48340	I think that it would be unethical for me to maximize my existence in a capitalist society.
48340	51300	I've turned down a lot of money for stuff that would maximize my existence in a capitalist
51300	53860	society, because I think it's unethical to do so. I don't agree that, like,
55140	57860	because it doesn't further what I believe in, and it doesn't further what you've turned down.
58420	62580	I've turned down a ton of fucking gambling sponsorships. There was so much money flying
62580	66420	around in the CSGO skin days. There was so much of that shit that I fucking turned down.
67220	71620	Okay, good. And you've turned down, and I, for my part, have turned down every sponsorship,
71620	75220	because it's not a part of my aesthetic. I don't want to.
75220	82660	Okay, wait, then don't make those things the same. Wait, wait, don't compare that to me, okay?
82660	87860	In my opinion, this is where he really caught Vaush in the hypocrisy. If Vaush is willing to
87860	93380	say that the most egregious parts of capitalism, from his point of view obviously, are not as bad
93380	99060	simply because it's a socialist who's doing it, and therefore there's no actual obligation for
99060	103460	a socialist to live by their principles. And, you know, start a worker co-op, or pay people
103460	107460	at higher than normal rates for the market, or rent out property at lower than normal rates for
107460	112980	the market. If a socialist simply behaves the same as every other capitalist, and Vaush considers
112980	116660	that better just because they're a socialist, then there's no actual principles there. It's
116660	122100	just tribalism. Abstinence, in one sense, is you just stand by and you watch a person drown.
122100	126420	And abstinence, which is negative. And abstinence, in the business sense, is you just stand by and
126420	131540	you watch another business open up and exploit workers. Which would be neutral, but the death
131540	137060	is negative. How is that? Okay, I never ever ever want you to say again that, like, capitalism is
137060	141300	negative, or business owners are bad, because you understand my argument enough. I guess not,
141300	145140	because you've bit the neutral bullet on basically every single actor in a capitalist system. And
145140	149780	since that moment, I've been watching more and more Destiny, and I've realized that even when
149780	155300	I disagree with him, I can respect him because I do think he actually believes what he's saying.
155300	160260	And, you know, a couple years ago I thought he was completely out to lunch. So, hey, maybe that's
160260	164980	how you actually convince people to at least listen to you, is to, you know, be honest, be
164980	170660	sincere. What I'm getting to, though, is that in a previous video, I mentioned that this difference
170660	175620	between Destiny and Vaush is why I thought, and still do think, that Vaush is a grifter.
175620	180340	He misunderstood that comment. He thought that I was saying he was a fake leftist.
181300	203300	But the truth is, I wasn't saying that at all. Vaush is absolutely 100%
204260	209780	the most real leftist out there. It's just that leftism itself is the grift.
209780	214660	How many breadtubers and leftytubers and whatever else do you need to see who are explicitly not
214660	218580	living by their principles? How many of them do you need to encounter before you realize that
218580	221860	something's actually up here? The only one out of all of them that I actually think
221860	226820	runs their channel like a worker co-op, for example, is the serfs. Vaush certainly doesn't
226820	231380	do it, and whenever he's asked, he runs himself in circles trying to explain why. You think Contra
231380	236500	does it? Hell, how about Philosophy Tube, the whole thing that started the debate between
236500	241060	Vaush and Destiny in the first place, where Philosophy Tube was indirectly calling for some
241060	246500	kind of rent strike action with rhetoric like, we need to rise up, even though I promise you
246500	251300	that YouTube channel is pulling in a lot of money. There is definitely this feeling that I get
251300	256900	regarding all these champagne socialists who talk about revolutions while simply taking the paycheck
256900	261780	and not actually doing anything themselves to further their cause. But it's not just Destiny.
261780	267060	Even if you don't like Sargon, you have to admit, he started a company, he's hired six people,
267060	272180	he is a liberal, and he's running his business on those liberal principles. And you know what? All
272180	276900	of those people seem to be actually doing well because of it. Their lives seem to be better
276900	281620	working for the Lotus Eaters rather than doing whatever it was they were doing before. And hell,
281620	286180	look at Kraut. Even if you don't like Kraut, you should go check out his, I don't even know what to
286180	292180	call it, Workers Manifesto? Basically Kraut wrote down and made public how he intends to operate his
292180	296820	business in the future, since it being a YouTube channel, it's run primarily on ad revenue and
296820	302500	donations. And in it, he points out that he plans to live by his principles as well. He intends to
302500	308020	give everyone working under him a living wage. The excess money will go into making his content
308020	313140	higher quality. He will not complain about having to pay taxes like Hassan Piker and others. And he
313140	317700	even changed his private discord where this happens to be called Workers Union. I'm not sure
317700	322260	if people under him actually have a union or not, but I do know just from personally talking to
322260	327700	Kraut that he intends to treat them fairly. This is what living your principles is. It costs money.
327700	332900	But you know what? It makes those working for you have better lives. In turn, they are likely to
332900	337780	create a better product. And then you yourself, as the owner of the business, you profit in the long
337780	343220	term too. And for all of the screaming and crying about the socialist revolution that comes out of
343220	348100	BreadTube, they are absolutely unwilling to actually live their principles. Additionally,
348100	354020	if for some reason you were curious whether or not I live my principles, the answer is I try to
354020	358740	the best that I can. I have never hidden from you where the money that you guys so generously give
358740	363780	me actually goes to. Yes, I'm paying for food and rent and other essential bills. I'm also paying
363780	368260	the artists who work for me. And I do reinvest back into the channel, though at this point I
368260	372340	only need to buy one CPU and then I think I'm good for equipment. That doesn't mean I've been perfect
372340	376180	though. For example, recently there was kind of a scandal that you may not know about if you're not
376180	380740	in my discord or follow my Twitch, where my roommate who has worked on the show before, he
380740	385540	found himself in some financial and potentially legal trouble. And so because he works with me on
385540	391220	the channel sometimes, people gave a shit ton of donations on the Twitch channel that we both co-host
391220	396260	hoping to help him out in a hard time. And now for reasons that I'm not going to get into,
396260	400500	he hasn't been on the channel in about a month and a half. And people are starting to ask me,
400500	405700	hey, we gave all this money to help him out. Where is he? And the honest truth is I have no answer.
405700	409780	And personally, I feel kind of bad that like people gave money that ended up being under
409780	415060	false pretenses and I can refund it if you really want, but it will go towards the channel in some
415060	419380	form or another. It's just one of those situations where I feel kind of bad about it. But even though
419380	424260	I'm not perfect, I do try to live my principles and not lie to you about where your money goes.
424260	430420	In a previous video, I talked about where the Black Lives Matter money goes. When you donate
430420	434900	to, I think it's blacklivesmatter.com or .org or something, it goes into a Democratic slush fund,
434900	439300	gets laundered around a bit, and then ends up in the pockets of people like this. Atlanta
439300	447060	activist spent $200,000 in Black Lives Matter donations on his house and personal expenses.
447060	451860	The FBI has arrested the founder of a Black Lives Matter group in Atlanta on
451860	457940	fraud and money laundering charges. And more recently, Black Lives Matter co-founder Patrice
457940	466660	Con Colors lands Topanga Canyon compound for $1.4 million, 2,400 square feet, three bedrooms,
466660	471860	two bathrooms, plus one bed, one bath guest house in Topanga Canyon, Los Angeles. This place,
471860	477700	by the way, it's pretty beautiful. The only way this house is getting bought is with that
477700	482980	race grifter money, you know? Laughing all the way to the fucking bank. Remember, Patrice Con
482980	488980	Colors was the woman who said this. We actually do have an ideological frame. Myself and Alicia
488980	499860	in particular are trained organizers. We are trained Marxists. We are super
502420	508660	versed on sort of ideological theories. This is how it always goes with people who are
508660	514980	super versed in Marxist theory. They do not redistribute wealth or power, they simply
514980	520820	centralize it. Now, on a moral level, I'm not against the idea of somebody getting rich,
520820	525060	even if it's through something ridiculous like this, and then buying themselves a nice house.
525060	529780	But if you're like a true socialist, a true believer in Black Lives Matter, you have to
529780	536420	be looking at this with disgust right now. With egg on your face, in fact, for even contributing
536420	544020	one cent of your own money to this mess. While I was editing the video, this article showed up.
544020	550260	Inside, BLM co-founder Patrice Con Colors' million-dollar real estate buying binge.
550260	554420	As protests broke out across the country in the name of Black Lives Matter,
554420	560580	the group's co-founder went on a real estate buying binge, snagging four high-end homes.
560580	565460	So it's not just one anymore, guys. It's not just the one that I showed pictures of. She was eyeing
565460	571780	property in the Bahamas, and there's also luxury apartments and townhouses alongside that LA home.
571780	577940	Here's her home in Georgia. It's quite the indoor pool. Here's her house in Englewood, California.
577940	583700	And here's a place in South LA. I have heard so many socialists tell me that it should be
583700	589940	illegal for people to own multiple homes. And yet, here is a socialist who has the means to do so,
590500	594660	absolutely buying that shit up. The hypocrisy is incredible.
594660	598740	Also, while I was editing this video, I was tipped off about another instance like this.
598740	603300	It's obviously not to the same scale as the whole owning four homes thing, but you can see this to
603300	607620	different levels all over the place on the left. When the George Floyd protests happened, the blog
607620	615300	Stefano.me posted a big list of black-owned kawaii brands. So basically, if you're looking for
615300	620900	original hyper cute anime style art, lolita fashion, and other Japanese type stuff, there are
620900	626660	many shops out there that do that sort of thing. And since 2020 was the big push of support black
626660	631540	businesses, here's a list of them. One that I want to point out here is called Otaku Apparel.
631540	637700	It's Otaku Apparel, I guess. It's based in Houston, Texas, and offers cute, colorful apparel
637700	643940	and accessories in multiple sizes. In October 9th, 2020, the owner of Otaku says, I'm going to have
643940	648900	to close the store down for a couple months to catch up on all my orders. Please read the full
648900	654820	post for additional information. Now that was what, six months ago? Check out these comments.
654820	660740	I've sent multiple emails in September, October, January, and now with no response. Could you
660740	666740	please provide official communication or status updates? I ordered on June 5th. It's too late to
666740	670660	do a chargeback. I would like to be either refunded or get the stuff that was purchased.
670660	675140	I love how you lied on your friend's post saying that you would finally address us
675140	680100	as the brand owner, only to go back into hiding for another two weeks on top of the four months
680100	686340	of ghosting us. I placed an order in September of 2020 and waited until January to inquire.
686340	691780	Still haven't received a reply or any update of any kind. Just so y'all know, the owner will
691780	698340	not respond to emails and said no June refunds because your money was unknowingly donated to
698340	704180	Black Lives Matter. Make your disputes with the bank if you can. No refunds or cancellations.
704180	708660	Same thing on her Instagram. I ordered from you back in July and never got what I paid for.
708660	713380	Why you scamming people? Come on now. I ordered from your place in June. I tried to be
713380	717940	understanding but it's literally almost a year and no updates. It's more frustrating on our end
717940	722980	because we spent our own money. Socialists do not respect the concept of money. Therefore,
722980	727860	you should not expect them to be responsible with yours. And this isn't new. It's been going on for
727860	732820	a while. In Manning Johnson's book, Color, Communism, and Common Sense, where he talks
732820	736740	about both the race grifters and the commie grifters, he writes,
762820	791460	And I think, in a separate video,
791460	794900	I brought up this very old quote, but I'll do it again just to make sure we're all on
794900	800100	the same page here. These are the words of Booker T. Washington from an era long before
800100	802100	any of the things we're talking about today.
821620	825060	Some of these people do not want the negro to lose his grievances,
825060	830020	because they do not want to lose their jobs. We see this everywhere. The feminists in academia
830020	834340	do not actually want to solve any gender problems that may exist, because then they would be out of
834340	838500	a job. The race hustlers do not want to solve any race problems that may actually exist,
838500	841700	because then they would be out of a job. And the breadtubers? I think most of all,
841700	845700	they definitely want to keep the grift going. These are people who have built an entire
845700	852020	industry and now profit off of identity politics. And no, no, there is no identity
852020	856260	politics on the right. Identity politics is a very specific thing. I know people on Twitter,
856260	859540	I know breadtubers, I know streamers, all these people who say, the right's idpol,
859540	863540	they also love it, no no no no, you misunderstand. What you're talking about is just tribalism,
863540	868420	okay? There is definitely race tribalism, gender tribalism, class tribalism,
868420	873380	political affiliation tribalism, identifying with a group, or talking for that group collectively,
873380	878260	or something like that. That's not idpol, that's just tribalism. Identity politics is a very
878260	883700	specific thing. And yes, it is uniquely leftist if we are using the left-right binary, because it
883700	890260	comes out of a 1960s French intellectual movement that repurposed Marxist analysis for group
890260	895220	dynamics other than class. So when the Marxists look at the proletariat and the bourgeoisie,
895220	901380	the new left, meaning leftism from 1960s onwards, takes that framework and applies it to things like
901380	907220	race and gender. That's what idpol is. The right wing of politics for all of their many problems
907220	913060	do not engage in idpol. They do engage in tribalism, but not identity politics.
913060	919140	And this is what makes the left, specifically, a giant grift. It doesn't matter if you're
919140	924100	Robin DiAngelo publishing White Fragility, it doesn't matter if you're Patrice Khan Colors
924100	927780	buying a giant house using your Black Lives Matter money, it doesn't matter if you're a
927780	931460	breadtuber raking in donations while never actually living your principles.
931460	936980	What connects these separate types of leftism together is their grifting nature. They're
936980	941460	fundamentally anti-individual, which is by the way why they're an anti-individual solution for
941460	946100	your life's problems, and instead talk about collective solutions, collective action,
946100	950900	stuff like this. The implication there is that you can't actually fix what's wrong with your life,
950900	955780	you have to be part of a collective that gets it done. Of course, they just so happen to have
955780	959220	the entry to that collective, and it's not going to cost you very much to join.
959220	962740	It's the exact same kind of thing that cults and super churches do on the right.
962740	967940	Those are also grifts. They will sell you spiritual salvation for the low price of 1999.
967940	971860	The left will sell you material salvation for the same price. Does this mean that I consider
971860	977700	the right to also be a grift? Um, yeah. But at that point it really depends on what you mean by
977700	982180	left and right. From where I'm standing, the center seems to be the only non-grift position
982180	986180	on the traditional French Revolution era spectrum, where you'll find the classical
986180	991300	liberals and some of the libertarians as well. But outside of the center, the rest of politics
991300	995700	is just a toll booth. Though this applies to both the left and the right, it's most prominent with
995700	1001140	socialism. Come on in, we'll fix things, guys, everything will be better. Also, pay at the door.
