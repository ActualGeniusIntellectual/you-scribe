00:00.000 --> 00:04.520
The thumbnail for this video was made by Jinjango, a viewer of mine and a really cool artist.

00:04.520 --> 00:07.680
You can check out his artwork at the website on screen and in the description.

00:07.680 --> 00:21.100
Thanks very much, man.

00:21.100 --> 00:24.640
Every year around this time we have the privilege of watching the Game Awards.

00:24.640 --> 00:28.700
The show is, as you might expect, a yearly awards show for the best video games released

00:28.700 --> 00:33.460
that year, considered to be video games' own Oscars or Emmys, in fact, sometimes directly

00:33.460 --> 00:48.460
compared to them.

00:48.460 --> 00:53.620
The Game Awards began as Spike TV's Video Game Awards, or the VGAs, starting in 2003.

00:53.620 --> 00:58.020
It was honestly a nightmare of a show that most fans consider to be a mockery of video

00:58.020 --> 01:01.660
games, hosted by celebrities that did not care whatsoever about games, and stuffed

01:01.660 --> 01:04.800
to the brim with advertisements and meaningless musical numbers.

01:04.800 --> 01:08.440
And actually, the modern show is much the same, showing that some things really don't

01:08.440 --> 01:09.440
change all that much.

01:09.440 --> 01:11.000
But there was one big change.

01:11.000 --> 01:17.000
The Spike TV era of the VGAs, from 2003 to 2013, was produced by Game Trailers host Jeff

01:17.000 --> 01:23.100
Keeley, who was known to gamers for his impassioned defense of Mass Effect on Fox TV in 2007,

01:23.100 --> 01:26.940
in regards to that game's sex scenes with the blue alien Liara.

01:26.940 --> 01:30.740
That version of the Game Awards, already not popular with gamers, suffered a complete

01:30.740 --> 01:34.420
crash and burn after the infamous Dorito Pope incident of 2012.

01:34.420 --> 01:38.300
Keeley, in his capacity as the producer of the VGAs and official representative of Spike

01:38.300 --> 01:42.540
TV, gave a heartfelt speech about what video games meant to him and how much he loved the

01:42.540 --> 01:45.900
industry, and the medium, and his job, and the people he works with, while surrounded

01:45.900 --> 01:48.240
by an avalanche of Doritos and Mountain Dew.

01:48.240 --> 01:52.460
The look on this man's face as he desperately tried to convince everyone he was not actually

01:52.460 --> 01:56.100
a shill is basically what single-handedly tanked the whole project.

01:56.260 --> 02:00.380
It's no surprise to me that the VGAs only ran for one more year, but they didn't die

02:00.380 --> 02:01.900
along with the rest of Spike TV.

02:01.900 --> 02:06.120
In 2014, the first year after Spike had axed the awards, Keeley started up his own show

02:06.120 --> 02:10.460
titled just The Game Awards, or TGAs instead of VGAs, though a lot of people still use

02:10.460 --> 02:12.260
the VGAs to refer to the show.

02:12.260 --> 02:14.260
This was Keeley's passion project.

02:14.260 --> 02:18.300
As a teenager back in 1994, he was tapped to provide material for Cybermania 94's

02:18.300 --> 02:21.600
hosts William Shatner and Leslie Nielsen, who didn't know much about video games and

02:21.600 --> 02:23.400
relied on Keeley's additions to their scripts.

02:23.400 --> 02:27.140
Although Cybermania was a short-lived failure, it planted the seed in Keeley's mind that

02:27.140 --> 02:30.740
video games should have its own awards show, just like every other medium.

02:30.740 --> 02:34.840
And when it came time for the VGAs to break away from Spike TV, Keeley invested one million

02:34.840 --> 02:37.960
dollars of his own money to get the 2014 show off the ground.

02:37.960 --> 02:39.480
This is his baby.

02:39.480 --> 02:42.680
Despite my complaints about how bloated the show can be sometimes, it's still a pretty

02:42.680 --> 02:43.760
fun spectacle.

02:43.760 --> 02:48.440
Gamers are a rowdier crowd than most media consumers, and game devs are a lot less professional,

02:48.440 --> 02:51.760
leading to each year's show generating at least one lasting meme.

02:51.760 --> 02:56.840
And 2022 is no exception.

02:56.840 --> 03:01.440
Like, for example, when the voice actor for Kratos in God of War gave a ten-minute monologue,

03:01.440 --> 03:04.840
clearly drunk or high or something, causing Keeley to quip that he was trying to give

03:04.840 --> 03:06.320
away more Steam Decks.

03:06.320 --> 03:09.540
Steam had a deal with the Game Awards to give away a Steam Deck to a random viewer for each

03:09.540 --> 03:10.760
minute of airtime.

03:10.760 --> 03:14.160
Or when Al Pacino came out on the stage, looking like he had one foot in the grave, and gave

03:14.160 --> 03:17.840
him meandering speech about being too old for this shit, but his kids like video games,

03:17.840 --> 03:18.840
and that's nice.

03:18.840 --> 03:22.600
Or the epic flute guy in the orchestra, who went absolutely wild every time the camera

03:22.600 --> 03:23.600
was on him.

03:23.600 --> 03:28.200
Or how angry everyone was at literally every single winner of every award, most notably

03:28.200 --> 03:32.280
the Player's Choice Award, going to Genshin Impact instead of Sonic Frontiers.

03:32.280 --> 03:34.040
But these aren't the memes you're here for, right?

03:34.040 --> 03:36.720
Like, these are pretty good, but they're not what stole the show.

03:36.720 --> 03:38.520
You're here for this.

03:38.520 --> 04:04.880
Alright, well, that's right, a random kid snuck on stage, got a hold of the mic, and

04:04.880 --> 04:10.040
said, I want to nominate this award to my reformed Orthodox Rabbi, Bill Clinton.

04:10.040 --> 04:12.960
I was streaming the awards live with my friends, and we couldn't believe it.

04:12.960 --> 04:15.480
We had to rewind back and see it again for ourselves.

04:15.480 --> 04:17.540
During the stream, I had a feeling something was off.

04:17.540 --> 04:21.020
The Elden Ring team had won previous awards, and it was the same guys going up to the stage

04:21.020 --> 04:22.360
to accept it each time.

04:22.360 --> 04:26.840
To have this random kid with them in the background, who is clearly not an adult Japanese game

04:26.840 --> 04:30.860
dev, but just blending in back there like he's part of the crew, it struck me as odd.

04:30.860 --> 04:32.000
Like what is this guy doing here?

04:32.000 --> 04:33.080
Is he the son of one of the developers?

04:33.080 --> 04:34.960
Maybe they have a white wife or something.

04:34.960 --> 04:36.320
Is he Joseph Perez's son?

04:36.320 --> 04:39.180
The winner of last year's game of the year, and the announcer of this year's?

04:39.180 --> 04:40.180
What is he doing there?

04:40.180 --> 04:43.160
Watching the stream back, you can see the moment when he just slips into the crowd from

04:43.160 --> 04:44.160
another aisle.

04:44.160 --> 04:46.880
This became the breakaway meme of the 2022 game awards.

04:46.880 --> 04:49.360
There's just too many memes to go over them all.

04:49.360 --> 04:50.920
It went viral like mad.

04:50.920 --> 04:55.180
People are making Elden Ring invasion references, people are making references to that old public

04:55.180 --> 05:00.080
access cable show gaming in the Clinton years, plus the usual sneak 100 and Among Us memes

05:00.080 --> 05:01.080
that you'd expect.

05:01.080 --> 05:03.040
People will be laughing about this for a long time.

05:03.040 --> 05:04.520
And some people weren't laughing.

05:04.520 --> 05:05.520
Keely for one.

05:05.520 --> 05:06.520
That's understandable.

05:06.520 --> 05:07.520
After all, this is his passion project.

05:07.520 --> 05:09.560
And look at his face after it happened.

05:09.560 --> 05:10.800
He was pissed.

05:10.800 --> 05:14.000
The individual who interrupted our game of the year moment has been arrested.

05:14.000 --> 05:17.700
There were widespread calls, mainly jokes, of course, to free our bro.

05:17.700 --> 05:21.280
And if you turn up the background audio on the stream, you can hear the moment where

05:21.280 --> 05:31.000
security apprehends him.

05:31.000 --> 05:33.320
There is, of course, a real security concern here.

05:33.320 --> 05:37.000
If he actually wanted to do something malicious and not just be a troll, he clearly had the

05:37.000 --> 05:38.120
opportunity.

05:38.120 --> 05:39.780
Security wasn't rushing the stage or anything.

05:39.780 --> 05:43.920
In fact, they just slowly walked toward the mic while he was talking, let him finish up,

05:43.920 --> 05:46.080
and then lead him backstage after the fact.

05:46.080 --> 05:50.560
But some people are taking what is clearly just a teenage kid fucking around, maybe fucking

05:50.560 --> 05:53.940
around on a bit too big of a scale, but still just fucking around and turning it into a

05:53.940 --> 05:55.280
whole political issue.

05:55.280 --> 05:59.640
I'm finding it very surprising that in 2022, some people thought even for a second that

05:59.640 --> 06:04.140
the Game Award Kid's speech, which references Jews and Bill Clinton, was just a fun joke.

06:04.140 --> 06:07.800
Jesus Christ, man, they're even doing the shoe phrenology thing to discover that he's

06:07.800 --> 06:09.200
wearing Kanye's shoes.

06:09.200 --> 06:12.120
The leftoids are really trying to make this guy into a political story because of the

06:12.120 --> 06:15.120
whole Jewish question thing happening outside of gaming right now.

06:15.120 --> 06:17.720
The question remains, who is the Bill Clinton kid?

06:17.720 --> 06:21.120
According to a journalist working at the Washington Post, who was in attendance at the awards

06:21.120 --> 06:23.160
show, nobody there even knew who he was.

06:23.160 --> 06:25.280
Well, there's a few people online who know.

06:25.280 --> 06:27.520
Here is a text exchange between two of his friends.

06:27.520 --> 06:29.640
Look who's behind the Elden Ring, guys, it's my homie.

06:29.640 --> 06:30.640
Bill Clinton?

06:30.640 --> 06:31.640
That's him.

06:31.640 --> 06:33.240
That's the same kid who was on Infowars with the free Taiwan thing.

06:33.240 --> 06:35.060
Did he just walk up there and no one stopped him?

06:35.060 --> 06:38.740
He told me his plan four days ago while I was playing Warzone with him and I said, zero

06:38.740 --> 06:39.740
chance it happens.

06:39.740 --> 06:43.920
Dude, if I were still a teenager and this were my friend, I would be reacting in exactly

06:43.920 --> 06:47.760
this way, shitting myself laughing at what my bro managed to pull off.

06:47.760 --> 06:51.640
As for the Infowars thing, yeah, it turns out he actually was on Infowars four years

06:51.640 --> 06:53.840
ago, looking and sounding much younger.

06:53.840 --> 06:56.760
For a while, people didn't think it was truly him, but I guess puberty really hit

06:57.000 --> 06:58.000
him like a pile of bricks.

06:58.000 --> 07:00.880
There's a video on his Twitter account that is also two years old.

07:00.880 --> 07:03.480
And yeah, if you line it all up, you can see the age progression.

07:03.480 --> 07:07.280
As for his voice, that's a jokey accent he puts on and you can hear him do it over on

07:07.280 --> 07:08.280
his TikTok account.

07:08.280 --> 07:12.120
You're very stupid because you don't speak French and you don't speak Italian.

07:12.120 --> 07:16.120
I don't speak French because I don't speak any other languages.

07:16.120 --> 07:19.120
I don't speak any other languages.

07:19.120 --> 07:26.120
You're very stupid because I don't speak a lot of French and you don't speak a lot of

07:26.120 --> 07:27.120
French.

07:27.120 --> 07:34.120
I don't speak French because I don't speak any other languages.

07:34.120 --> 07:37.120
Ah, I see.

07:37.960 --> 07:42.960
Great, so do you want to talk on abortion?

07:42.960 --> 07:45.960
Not with someone who's 12.

07:45.960 --> 07:49.960
I'm not 12 years old and you know, that's pretty disrespectful.

07:49.960 --> 07:53.400
No offense, but you sound like you are underage.

07:53.400 --> 07:57.200
But it's the Infowars appearance that leftoids are leaning on to insinuate that this kid

07:57.200 --> 08:01.560
is not just a troll who maybe got in a bit over his head, but instead is actually a raging

08:01.560 --> 08:06.000
anti-Semite indoctrinated by Kanye and Nick Fuentes and is dog whistling to all the other

08:06.000 --> 08:10.560
gamers out there by telling a Jewish Bill Clinton joke and getting instantly arrested.

08:10.560 --> 08:13.460
I guess that was his grand plan to bring about the fourth Reich.

08:13.460 --> 08:15.740
The thing is, I watched the Infowars video.

08:15.740 --> 08:18.740
It seems like the host, it's not even Alex Jones, it's some other guy, is trying to turn

08:18.740 --> 08:22.280
this kid, his name is Metan Evan by the way, into another Soph.

08:22.280 --> 08:26.200
Soph is a right wing YouTuber who went viral when she was like 9 or 10 and has continued

08:26.200 --> 08:28.160
to make content into her teen years.

08:28.160 --> 08:31.960
She's like the right wing as Greta Thunberg, though unlike Thunberg, Soph is at least partially

08:31.960 --> 08:32.960
self-produced.

08:32.960 --> 08:36.600
I think every political ideology likes to see young people getting involved with their

08:36.600 --> 08:40.060
movement and often tries to center them as mouthpieces when they can.

08:40.060 --> 08:42.600
But Evan wasn't exactly playing along with the Infowars guy.

08:42.600 --> 08:46.940
He had a lot to say about Hong Kong and Taiwan, but he passively refused to engage on most

08:46.940 --> 08:51.240
other right wing culture war topics, either redirecting back to China or just trolling.

08:51.240 --> 08:54.600
It's his behavior on Infowars that really makes me think he's just taking the piss.

08:54.600 --> 08:58.260
And the idea that this kid's life should be ruined over what is seriously just a prank

08:58.260 --> 08:59.520
is wild to me.

08:59.520 --> 09:01.200
He's clearly not an anti-Semite.

09:01.200 --> 09:02.200
His friends even confirmed.

09:02.200 --> 09:03.680
He's fucking Jewish.

09:03.680 --> 09:06.040
Jokes aside, here is the serious dev take.

09:06.040 --> 09:07.040
Should he have been arrested?

09:07.040 --> 09:08.040
Of course.

09:08.040 --> 09:10.360
You can probably hit him with a trespassing or a disturbing the peace charge, but at the

09:10.360 --> 09:11.360
same time, he's a kid.

09:11.360 --> 09:13.580
He looks to be what, 14 years old?

09:13.580 --> 09:16.760
How much ridiculous shit did you or I get up to when we were 14?

09:16.760 --> 09:19.040
And what happened to us if we got caught?

09:19.040 --> 09:20.400
Generally it was a slap on the wrist.

09:20.400 --> 09:24.080
Enough to scare us straight, not enough to ruin our lives over a dumb prank we pulled

09:24.080 --> 09:25.220
while we were in high school.

09:25.220 --> 09:28.280
The people calling for this kid's head are delusional, man.

09:28.280 --> 09:31.720
Imagine not being able to get a job in your 20s or 30s because you wandered up onto a

09:31.720 --> 09:35.180
stage at the Game Awards when you were 14 and made a joke about Bill Clinton.

09:35.180 --> 09:36.180
That would be insane.

09:36.180 --> 09:41.880
No, I don't think Matan Evan is an anti-Semite or a raging crypto-gripper or anything like

09:41.880 --> 09:46.120
that, and I hope for once in their lives the chained monkeys over at Kotaku have some human

09:46.120 --> 09:50.600
fucking decency and leave this kid alone instead of choosing to publish hit piece after hit

09:50.600 --> 09:54.400
piece about how he proves the alt-right is ascendant and taking over America, whipping

09:54.400 --> 09:56.320
up Twitter into a witch hunt in the process.

09:56.320 --> 09:59.900
He's clearly a kid who was fucking around and got a little bit over his head.

09:59.900 --> 10:00.900
Probably a lot over his head.

10:00.900 --> 10:03.000
Give him a slap on the wrist and let him go.

10:03.000 --> 10:05.940
Nobody deserves to have the internet follow him around for something like this.

10:05.940 --> 10:08.520
In any case, Matan Evan is giving interviews.

10:08.520 --> 10:12.100
For example, he just spoke to Jason Schreier, who also agrees with my assessment that he's

10:12.100 --> 10:13.100
just a prankster.

10:13.100 --> 10:14.820
But hey, don't take any of our words for it.

10:14.820 --> 10:17.540
Come back to my channel tomorrow and you can hear it from him yourself.
