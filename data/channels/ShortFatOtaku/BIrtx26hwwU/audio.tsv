4520	7680	You can check out his artwork at the website on screen and in the description.
7680	21100	Thanks very much, man.
21100	24640	Every year around this time we have the privilege of watching the Game Awards.
24640	28700	The show is, as you might expect, a yearly awards show for the best video games released
28700	33460	that year, considered to be video games' own Oscars or Emmys, in fact, sometimes directly
33460	48460	compared to them.
48460	53620	The Game Awards began as Spike TV's Video Game Awards, or the VGAs, starting in 2003.
53620	58020	It was honestly a nightmare of a show that most fans consider to be a mockery of video
58020	61660	games, hosted by celebrities that did not care whatsoever about games, and stuffed
61660	64800	to the brim with advertisements and meaningless musical numbers.
64800	68440	And actually, the modern show is much the same, showing that some things really don't
68440	69440	change all that much.
69440	71000	But there was one big change.
71000	77000	The Spike TV era of the VGAs, from 2003 to 2013, was produced by Game Trailers host Jeff
77000	83100	Keeley, who was known to gamers for his impassioned defense of Mass Effect on Fox TV in 2007,
83100	86940	in regards to that game's sex scenes with the blue alien Liara.
86940	90740	That version of the Game Awards, already not popular with gamers, suffered a complete
90740	94420	crash and burn after the infamous Dorito Pope incident of 2012.
94420	98300	Keeley, in his capacity as the producer of the VGAs and official representative of Spike
98300	102540	TV, gave a heartfelt speech about what video games meant to him and how much he loved the
102540	105900	industry, and the medium, and his job, and the people he works with, while surrounded
105900	108240	by an avalanche of Doritos and Mountain Dew.
108240	112460	The look on this man's face as he desperately tried to convince everyone he was not actually
112460	116100	a shill is basically what single-handedly tanked the whole project.
116260	120380	It's no surprise to me that the VGAs only ran for one more year, but they didn't die
120380	121900	along with the rest of Spike TV.
121900	126120	In 2014, the first year after Spike had axed the awards, Keeley started up his own show
126120	130460	titled just The Game Awards, or TGAs instead of VGAs, though a lot of people still use
130460	132260	the VGAs to refer to the show.
132260	134260	This was Keeley's passion project.
134260	138300	As a teenager back in 1994, he was tapped to provide material for Cybermania 94's
138300	141600	hosts William Shatner and Leslie Nielsen, who didn't know much about video games and
141600	143400	relied on Keeley's additions to their scripts.
143400	147140	Although Cybermania was a short-lived failure, it planted the seed in Keeley's mind that
147140	150740	video games should have its own awards show, just like every other medium.
150740	154840	And when it came time for the VGAs to break away from Spike TV, Keeley invested one million
154840	157960	dollars of his own money to get the 2014 show off the ground.
157960	159480	This is his baby.
159480	162680	Despite my complaints about how bloated the show can be sometimes, it's still a pretty
162680	163760	fun spectacle.
163760	168440	Gamers are a rowdier crowd than most media consumers, and game devs are a lot less professional,
168440	171760	leading to each year's show generating at least one lasting meme.
171760	176840	And 2022 is no exception.
176840	181440	Like, for example, when the voice actor for Kratos in God of War gave a ten-minute monologue,
181440	184840	clearly drunk or high or something, causing Keeley to quip that he was trying to give
184840	186320	away more Steam Decks.
186320	189540	Steam had a deal with the Game Awards to give away a Steam Deck to a random viewer for each
189540	190760	minute of airtime.
190760	194160	Or when Al Pacino came out on the stage, looking like he had one foot in the grave, and gave
194160	197840	him meandering speech about being too old for this shit, but his kids like video games,
197840	198840	and that's nice.
198840	202600	Or the epic flute guy in the orchestra, who went absolutely wild every time the camera
202600	203600	was on him.
203600	208200	Or how angry everyone was at literally every single winner of every award, most notably
208200	212280	the Player's Choice Award, going to Genshin Impact instead of Sonic Frontiers.
212280	214040	But these aren't the memes you're here for, right?
214040	216720	Like, these are pretty good, but they're not what stole the show.
216720	218520	You're here for this.
218520	244880	Alright, well, that's right, a random kid snuck on stage, got a hold of the mic, and
244880	250040	said, I want to nominate this award to my reformed Orthodox Rabbi, Bill Clinton.
250040	252960	I was streaming the awards live with my friends, and we couldn't believe it.
252960	255480	We had to rewind back and see it again for ourselves.
255480	257540	During the stream, I had a feeling something was off.
257540	261020	The Elden Ring team had won previous awards, and it was the same guys going up to the stage
261020	262360	to accept it each time.
262360	266840	To have this random kid with them in the background, who is clearly not an adult Japanese game
266840	270860	dev, but just blending in back there like he's part of the crew, it struck me as odd.
270860	272000	Like what is this guy doing here?
272000	273080	Is he the son of one of the developers?
273080	274960	Maybe they have a white wife or something.
274960	276320	Is he Joseph Perez's son?
276320	279180	The winner of last year's game of the year, and the announcer of this year's?
279180	280180	What is he doing there?
280180	283160	Watching the stream back, you can see the moment when he just slips into the crowd from
283160	284160	another aisle.
284160	286880	This became the breakaway meme of the 2022 game awards.
286880	289360	There's just too many memes to go over them all.
289360	290920	It went viral like mad.
290920	295180	People are making Elden Ring invasion references, people are making references to that old public
295180	300080	access cable show gaming in the Clinton years, plus the usual sneak 100 and Among Us memes
300080	301080	that you'd expect.
301080	303040	People will be laughing about this for a long time.
303040	304520	And some people weren't laughing.
304520	305520	Keely for one.
305520	306520	That's understandable.
306520	307520	After all, this is his passion project.
307520	309560	And look at his face after it happened.
309560	310800	He was pissed.
310800	314000	The individual who interrupted our game of the year moment has been arrested.
314000	317700	There were widespread calls, mainly jokes, of course, to free our bro.
317700	321280	And if you turn up the background audio on the stream, you can hear the moment where
321280	331000	security apprehends him.
331000	333320	There is, of course, a real security concern here.
333320	337000	If he actually wanted to do something malicious and not just be a troll, he clearly had the
337000	338120	opportunity.
338120	339780	Security wasn't rushing the stage or anything.
339780	343920	In fact, they just slowly walked toward the mic while he was talking, let him finish up,
343920	346080	and then lead him backstage after the fact.
346080	350560	But some people are taking what is clearly just a teenage kid fucking around, maybe fucking
350560	353940	around on a bit too big of a scale, but still just fucking around and turning it into a
353940	355280	whole political issue.
355280	359640	I'm finding it very surprising that in 2022, some people thought even for a second that
359640	364140	the Game Award Kid's speech, which references Jews and Bill Clinton, was just a fun joke.
364140	367800	Jesus Christ, man, they're even doing the shoe phrenology thing to discover that he's
367800	369200	wearing Kanye's shoes.
369200	372120	The leftoids are really trying to make this guy into a political story because of the
372120	375120	whole Jewish question thing happening outside of gaming right now.
375120	377720	The question remains, who is the Bill Clinton kid?
377720	381120	According to a journalist working at the Washington Post, who was in attendance at the awards
381120	383160	show, nobody there even knew who he was.
383160	385280	Well, there's a few people online who know.
385280	387520	Here is a text exchange between two of his friends.
387520	389640	Look who's behind the Elden Ring, guys, it's my homie.
389640	390640	Bill Clinton?
390640	391640	That's him.
391640	393240	That's the same kid who was on Infowars with the free Taiwan thing.
393240	395060	Did he just walk up there and no one stopped him?
395060	398740	He told me his plan four days ago while I was playing Warzone with him and I said, zero
398740	399740	chance it happens.
399740	403920	Dude, if I were still a teenager and this were my friend, I would be reacting in exactly
403920	407760	this way, shitting myself laughing at what my bro managed to pull off.
407760	411640	As for the Infowars thing, yeah, it turns out he actually was on Infowars four years
411640	413840	ago, looking and sounding much younger.
413840	416760	For a while, people didn't think it was truly him, but I guess puberty really hit
417000	418000	him like a pile of bricks.
418000	420880	There's a video on his Twitter account that is also two years old.
420880	423480	And yeah, if you line it all up, you can see the age progression.
423480	427280	As for his voice, that's a jokey accent he puts on and you can hear him do it over on
427280	428280	his TikTok account.
428280	432120	You're very stupid because you don't speak French and you don't speak Italian.
432120	436120	I don't speak French because I don't speak any other languages.
436120	439120	I don't speak any other languages.
439120	446120	You're very stupid because I don't speak a lot of French and you don't speak a lot of
446120	447120	French.
447120	454120	I don't speak French because I don't speak any other languages.
454120	457120	Ah, I see.
457960	462960	Great, so do you want to talk on abortion?
462960	465960	Not with someone who's 12.
465960	469960	I'm not 12 years old and you know, that's pretty disrespectful.
469960	473400	No offense, but you sound like you are underage.
473400	477200	But it's the Infowars appearance that leftoids are leaning on to insinuate that this kid
477200	481560	is not just a troll who maybe got in a bit over his head, but instead is actually a raging
481560	486000	anti-Semite indoctrinated by Kanye and Nick Fuentes and is dog whistling to all the other
486000	490560	gamers out there by telling a Jewish Bill Clinton joke and getting instantly arrested.
490560	493460	I guess that was his grand plan to bring about the fourth Reich.
493460	495740	The thing is, I watched the Infowars video.
495740	498740	It seems like the host, it's not even Alex Jones, it's some other guy, is trying to turn
498740	502280	this kid, his name is Metan Evan by the way, into another Soph.
502280	506200	Soph is a right wing YouTuber who went viral when she was like 9 or 10 and has continued
506200	508160	to make content into her teen years.
508160	511960	She's like the right wing as Greta Thunberg, though unlike Thunberg, Soph is at least partially
511960	512960	self-produced.
512960	516600	I think every political ideology likes to see young people getting involved with their
516600	520060	movement and often tries to center them as mouthpieces when they can.
520060	522600	But Evan wasn't exactly playing along with the Infowars guy.
522600	526940	He had a lot to say about Hong Kong and Taiwan, but he passively refused to engage on most
526940	531240	other right wing culture war topics, either redirecting back to China or just trolling.
531240	534600	It's his behavior on Infowars that really makes me think he's just taking the piss.
534600	538260	And the idea that this kid's life should be ruined over what is seriously just a prank
538260	539520	is wild to me.
539520	541200	He's clearly not an anti-Semite.
541200	542200	His friends even confirmed.
542200	543680	He's fucking Jewish.
543680	546040	Jokes aside, here is the serious dev take.
546040	547040	Should he have been arrested?
547040	548040	Of course.
548040	550360	You can probably hit him with a trespassing or a disturbing the peace charge, but at the
550360	551360	same time, he's a kid.
551360	553580	He looks to be what, 14 years old?
553580	556760	How much ridiculous shit did you or I get up to when we were 14?
556760	559040	And what happened to us if we got caught?
559040	560400	Generally it was a slap on the wrist.
560400	564080	Enough to scare us straight, not enough to ruin our lives over a dumb prank we pulled
564080	565220	while we were in high school.
565220	568280	The people calling for this kid's head are delusional, man.
568280	571720	Imagine not being able to get a job in your 20s or 30s because you wandered up onto a
571720	575180	stage at the Game Awards when you were 14 and made a joke about Bill Clinton.
575180	576180	That would be insane.
576180	581880	No, I don't think Matan Evan is an anti-Semite or a raging crypto-gripper or anything like
581880	586120	that, and I hope for once in their lives the chained monkeys over at Kotaku have some human
586120	590600	fucking decency and leave this kid alone instead of choosing to publish hit piece after hit
590600	594400	piece about how he proves the alt-right is ascendant and taking over America, whipping
594400	596320	up Twitter into a witch hunt in the process.
596320	599900	He's clearly a kid who was fucking around and got a little bit over his head.
599900	600900	Probably a lot over his head.
600900	603000	Give him a slap on the wrist and let him go.
603000	605940	Nobody deserves to have the internet follow him around for something like this.
605940	608520	In any case, Matan Evan is giving interviews.
608520	612100	For example, he just spoke to Jason Schreier, who also agrees with my assessment that he's
612100	613100	just a prankster.
613100	614820	But hey, don't take any of our words for it.
614820	617540	Come back to my channel tomorrow and you can hear it from him yourself.
