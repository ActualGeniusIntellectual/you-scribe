00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,520
The thumbnail for this video was made by Jinjango, a viewer of mine and a really cool artist.

2
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:07,680
You can check out his artwork at the website on screen and in the description.

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:21,100
Thanks very much, man.

4
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:24,640
Every year around this time we have the privilege of watching the Game Awards.

5
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:28,700
The show is, as you might expect, a yearly awards show for the best video games released

6
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:33,460
that year, considered to be video games' own Oscars or Emmys, in fact, sometimes directly

7
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:48,460
compared to them.

8
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:53,620
The Game Awards began as Spike TV's Video Game Awards, or the VGAs, starting in 2003.

9
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:58,020
It was honestly a nightmare of a show that most fans consider to be a mockery of video

10
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:01,660
games, hosted by celebrities that did not care whatsoever about games, and stuffed

11
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:04,800
to the brim with advertisements and meaningless musical numbers.

12
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:08,440
And actually, the modern show is much the same, showing that some things really don't

13
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:09,440
change all that much.

14
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:11,000
But there was one big change.

15
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:17,000
The Spike TV era of the VGAs, from 2003 to 2013, was produced by Game Trailers host Jeff

16
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:23,100
Keeley, who was known to gamers for his impassioned defense of Mass Effect on Fox TV in 2007,

17
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:26,940
in regards to that game's sex scenes with the blue alien Liara.

18
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:30,740
That version of the Game Awards, already not popular with gamers, suffered a complete

19
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:34,420
crash and burn after the infamous Dorito Pope incident of 2012.

20
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:38,300
Keeley, in his capacity as the producer of the VGAs and official representative of Spike

21
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:42,540
TV, gave a heartfelt speech about what video games meant to him and how much he loved the

22
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:45,900
industry, and the medium, and his job, and the people he works with, while surrounded

23
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:48,240
by an avalanche of Doritos and Mountain Dew.

24
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:52,460
The look on this man's face as he desperately tried to convince everyone he was not actually

25
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:56,100
a shill is basically what single-handedly tanked the whole project.

26
00:01:56,260 --> 00:02:00,380
It's no surprise to me that the VGAs only ran for one more year, but they didn't die

27
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:01,900
along with the rest of Spike TV.

28
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:06,120
In 2014, the first year after Spike had axed the awards, Keeley started up his own show

29
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:10,460
titled just The Game Awards, or TGAs instead of VGAs, though a lot of people still use

30
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:12,260
the VGAs to refer to the show.

31
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:14,260
This was Keeley's passion project.

32
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:18,300
As a teenager back in 1994, he was tapped to provide material for Cybermania 94's

33
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:21,600
hosts William Shatner and Leslie Nielsen, who didn't know much about video games and

34
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,400
relied on Keeley's additions to their scripts.

35
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:27,140
Although Cybermania was a short-lived failure, it planted the seed in Keeley's mind that

36
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:30,740
video games should have its own awards show, just like every other medium.

37
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:34,840
And when it came time for the VGAs to break away from Spike TV, Keeley invested one million

38
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:37,960
dollars of his own money to get the 2014 show off the ground.

39
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,480
This is his baby.

40
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:42,680
Despite my complaints about how bloated the show can be sometimes, it's still a pretty

41
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:43,760
fun spectacle.

42
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:48,440
Gamers are a rowdier crowd than most media consumers, and game devs are a lot less professional,

43
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:51,760
leading to each year's show generating at least one lasting meme.

44
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:56,840
And 2022 is no exception.

45
00:02:56,840 --> 00:03:01,440
Like, for example, when the voice actor for Kratos in God of War gave a ten-minute monologue,

46
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:04,840
clearly drunk or high or something, causing Keeley to quip that he was trying to give

47
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:06,320
away more Steam Decks.

48
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:09,540
Steam had a deal with the Game Awards to give away a Steam Deck to a random viewer for each

49
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:10,760
minute of airtime.

50
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:14,160
Or when Al Pacino came out on the stage, looking like he had one foot in the grave, and gave

51
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:17,840
him meandering speech about being too old for this shit, but his kids like video games,

52
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:18,840
and that's nice.

53
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:22,600
Or the epic flute guy in the orchestra, who went absolutely wild every time the camera

54
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:23,600
was on him.

55
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:28,200
Or how angry everyone was at literally every single winner of every award, most notably

56
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:32,280
the Player's Choice Award, going to Genshin Impact instead of Sonic Frontiers.

57
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:34,040
But these aren't the memes you're here for, right?

58
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:36,720
Like, these are pretty good, but they're not what stole the show.

59
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,520
You're here for this.

60
00:03:38,520 --> 00:04:04,880
Alright, well, that's right, a random kid snuck on stage, got a hold of the mic, and

61
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:10,040
said, I want to nominate this award to my reformed Orthodox Rabbi, Bill Clinton.

62
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:12,960
I was streaming the awards live with my friends, and we couldn't believe it.

63
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:15,480
We had to rewind back and see it again for ourselves.

64
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:17,540
During the stream, I had a feeling something was off.

65
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:21,020
The Elden Ring team had won previous awards, and it was the same guys going up to the stage

66
00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:22,360
to accept it each time.

67
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:26,840
To have this random kid with them in the background, who is clearly not an adult Japanese game

68
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:30,860
dev, but just blending in back there like he's part of the crew, it struck me as odd.

69
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:32,000
Like what is this guy doing here?

70
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,080
Is he the son of one of the developers?

71
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:34,960
Maybe they have a white wife or something.

72
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,320
Is he Joseph Perez's son?

73
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:39,180
The winner of last year's game of the year, and the announcer of this year's?

74
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:40,180
What is he doing there?

75
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:43,160
Watching the stream back, you can see the moment when he just slips into the crowd from

76
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:44,160
another aisle.

77
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,880
This became the breakaway meme of the 2022 game awards.

78
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:49,360
There's just too many memes to go over them all.

79
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,920
It went viral like mad.

80
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:55,180
People are making Elden Ring invasion references, people are making references to that old public

81
00:04:55,180 --> 00:05:00,080
access cable show gaming in the Clinton years, plus the usual sneak 100 and Among Us memes

82
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,080
that you'd expect.

83
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:03,040
People will be laughing about this for a long time.

84
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,520
And some people weren't laughing.

85
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:05,520
Keely for one.

86
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:06,520
That's understandable.

87
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:07,520
After all, this is his passion project.

88
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:09,560
And look at his face after it happened.

89
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:10,800
He was pissed.

90
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:14,000
The individual who interrupted our game of the year moment has been arrested.

91
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,700
There were widespread calls, mainly jokes, of course, to free our bro.

92
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:21,280
And if you turn up the background audio on the stream, you can hear the moment where

93
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:31,000
security apprehends him.

94
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,320
There is, of course, a real security concern here.

95
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:37,000
If he actually wanted to do something malicious and not just be a troll, he clearly had the

96
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,120
opportunity.

97
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,780
Security wasn't rushing the stage or anything.

98
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:43,920
In fact, they just slowly walked toward the mic while he was talking, let him finish up,

99
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:46,080
and then lead him backstage after the fact.

100
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:50,560
But some people are taking what is clearly just a teenage kid fucking around, maybe fucking

101
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:53,940
around on a bit too big of a scale, but still just fucking around and turning it into a

102
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:55,280
whole political issue.

103
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:59,640
I'm finding it very surprising that in 2022, some people thought even for a second that

104
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:04,140
the Game Award Kid's speech, which references Jews and Bill Clinton, was just a fun joke.

105
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:07,800
Jesus Christ, man, they're even doing the shoe phrenology thing to discover that he's

106
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,200
wearing Kanye's shoes.

107
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:12,120
The leftoids are really trying to make this guy into a political story because of the

108
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:15,120
whole Jewish question thing happening outside of gaming right now.

109
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,720
The question remains, who is the Bill Clinton kid?

110
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:21,120
According to a journalist working at the Washington Post, who was in attendance at the awards

111
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,160
show, nobody there even knew who he was.

112
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:25,280
Well, there's a few people online who know.

113
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:27,520
Here is a text exchange between two of his friends.

114
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,640
Look who's behind the Elden Ring, guys, it's my homie.

115
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:30,640
Bill Clinton?

116
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:31,640
That's him.

117
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:33,240
That's the same kid who was on Infowars with the free Taiwan thing.

118
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:35,060
Did he just walk up there and no one stopped him?

119
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:38,740
He told me his plan four days ago while I was playing Warzone with him and I said, zero

120
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:39,740
chance it happens.

121
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:43,920
Dude, if I were still a teenager and this were my friend, I would be reacting in exactly

122
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:47,760
this way, shitting myself laughing at what my bro managed to pull off.

123
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:51,640
As for the Infowars thing, yeah, it turns out he actually was on Infowars four years

124
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:53,840
ago, looking and sounding much younger.

125
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:56,760
For a while, people didn't think it was truly him, but I guess puberty really hit

126
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
him like a pile of bricks.

127
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,880
There's a video on his Twitter account that is also two years old.

128
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:03,480
And yeah, if you line it all up, you can see the age progression.

129
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:07,280
As for his voice, that's a jokey accent he puts on and you can hear him do it over on

130
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,280
his TikTok account.

131
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:12,120
You're very stupid because you don't speak French and you don't speak Italian.

132
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:16,120
I don't speak French because I don't speak any other languages.

133
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:19,120
I don't speak any other languages.

134
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:26,120
You're very stupid because I don't speak a lot of French and you don't speak a lot of

135
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,120
French.

136
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:34,120
I don't speak French because I don't speak any other languages.

137
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:37,120
Ah, I see.

138
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:42,960
Great, so do you want to talk on abortion?

139
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,960
Not with someone who's 12.

140
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:49,960
I'm not 12 years old and you know, that's pretty disrespectful.

141
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:53,400
No offense, but you sound like you are underage.

142
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:57,200
But it's the Infowars appearance that leftoids are leaning on to insinuate that this kid

143
00:07:57,200 --> 00:08:01,560
is not just a troll who maybe got in a bit over his head, but instead is actually a raging

144
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:06,000
anti-Semite indoctrinated by Kanye and Nick Fuentes and is dog whistling to all the other

145
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,560
gamers out there by telling a Jewish Bill Clinton joke and getting instantly arrested.

146
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:13,460
I guess that was his grand plan to bring about the fourth Reich.

147
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:15,740
The thing is, I watched the Infowars video.

148
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:18,740
It seems like the host, it's not even Alex Jones, it's some other guy, is trying to turn

149
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:22,280
this kid, his name is Metan Evan by the way, into another Soph.

150
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:26,200
Soph is a right wing YouTuber who went viral when she was like 9 or 10 and has continued

151
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:28,160
to make content into her teen years.

152
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:31,960
She's like the right wing as Greta Thunberg, though unlike Thunberg, Soph is at least partially

153
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:32,960
self-produced.

154
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:36,600
I think every political ideology likes to see young people getting involved with their

155
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:40,060
movement and often tries to center them as mouthpieces when they can.

156
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:42,600
But Evan wasn't exactly playing along with the Infowars guy.

157
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:46,940
He had a lot to say about Hong Kong and Taiwan, but he passively refused to engage on most

158
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:51,240
other right wing culture war topics, either redirecting back to China or just trolling.

159
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:54,600
It's his behavior on Infowars that really makes me think he's just taking the piss.

160
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:58,260
And the idea that this kid's life should be ruined over what is seriously just a prank

161
00:08:58,260 --> 00:08:59,520
is wild to me.

162
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:01,200
He's clearly not an anti-Semite.

163
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,200
His friends even confirmed.

164
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,680
He's fucking Jewish.

165
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:06,040
Jokes aside, here is the serious dev take.

166
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:07,040
Should he have been arrested?

167
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,040
Of course.

168
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:10,360
You can probably hit him with a trespassing or a disturbing the peace charge, but at the

169
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:11,360
same time, he's a kid.

170
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,580
He looks to be what, 14 years old?

171
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:16,760
How much ridiculous shit did you or I get up to when we were 14?

172
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:19,040
And what happened to us if we got caught?

173
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:20,400
Generally it was a slap on the wrist.

174
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:24,080
Enough to scare us straight, not enough to ruin our lives over a dumb prank we pulled

175
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,220
while we were in high school.

176
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:28,280
The people calling for this kid's head are delusional, man.

177
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:31,720
Imagine not being able to get a job in your 20s or 30s because you wandered up onto a

178
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:35,180
stage at the Game Awards when you were 14 and made a joke about Bill Clinton.

179
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:36,180
That would be insane.

180
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:41,880
No, I don't think Matan Evan is an anti-Semite or a raging crypto-gripper or anything like

181
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:46,120
that, and I hope for once in their lives the chained monkeys over at Kotaku have some human

182
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:50,600
fucking decency and leave this kid alone instead of choosing to publish hit piece after hit

183
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:54,400
piece about how he proves the alt-right is ascendant and taking over America, whipping

184
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:56,320
up Twitter into a witch hunt in the process.

185
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:59,900
He's clearly a kid who was fucking around and got a little bit over his head.

186
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:00,900
Probably a lot over his head.

187
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:03,000
Give him a slap on the wrist and let him go.

188
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,940
Nobody deserves to have the internet follow him around for something like this.

189
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:08,520
In any case, Matan Evan is giving interviews.

190
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:12,100
For example, he just spoke to Jason Schreier, who also agrees with my assessment that he's

191
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:13,100
just a prankster.

192
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:14,820
But hey, don't take any of our words for it.

193
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:17,540
Come back to my channel tomorrow and you can hear it from him yourself.
