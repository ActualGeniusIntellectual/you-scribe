1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,080
What's up Dave?

2
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:12,960
Do you want to tell all the people out there who are looking at you right now what's going

3
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:13,960
on today?

4
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:14,960
Because today is the 15th.

5
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:15,960
Oh yeah, I do.

6
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:16,960
Wait.

7
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:19,960
Is this a live thing?

8
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:28,360
Oh my god man.

9
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:31,240
This is when we get two videos a day from now on.

10
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:33,160
This has been No Talent Gaming Starts.

11
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:35,480
Yup, yup, yup, yup, June 15th.

12
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:38,320
Do you just have no talent in the rest of your life as well?

13
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:39,800
It is June 15th.

14
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:41,600
It is that day.

15
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:44,960
That day where life changes forever.

16
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:45,960
Life changes forever.

17
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:46,960
Two day, two day.

18
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:47,960
Two, two, two, two inches a day.

19
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:48,960
Guarantee, guarantee, guarantee, guarantee.

20
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:49,960
What games will they be Dave?

21
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:58,720
That will do Bangor Kazooie and Pokemon Soul Silver.

22
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:01,240
Are you really sure about that?

23
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:02,360
I'm HIV positive.
