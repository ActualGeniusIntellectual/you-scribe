What's up Dave?

00:07.080 --> 00:12.960
Do you want to tell all the people out there who are looking at you right now what's going

00:12.960 --> 00:13.960
on today?

00:13.960 --> 00:14.960
Because today is the 15th.

00:14.960 --> 00:15.960
Oh yeah, I do.

00:15.960 --> 00:16.960
Wait.

00:16.960 --> 00:19.960
Is this a live thing?

00:19.960 --> 00:28.360
Oh my god man.

00:28.360 --> 00:31.240
This is when we get two videos a day from now on.

00:31.240 --> 00:33.160
This has been No Talent Gaming Starts.

00:33.160 --> 00:35.480
Yup, yup, yup, yup, June 15th.

00:35.480 --> 00:38.320
Do you just have no talent in the rest of your life as well?

00:38.320 --> 00:39.800
It is June 15th.

00:39.800 --> 00:41.600
It is that day.

00:41.600 --> 00:44.960
That day where life changes forever.

00:44.960 --> 00:45.960
Life changes forever.

00:45.960 --> 00:46.960
Two day, two day.

00:46.960 --> 00:47.960
Two, two, two, two inches a day.

00:47.960 --> 00:48.960
Guarantee, guarantee, guarantee, guarantee.

00:48.960 --> 00:49.960
What games will they be Dave?

00:49.960 --> 00:58.720
That will do Bangor Kazooie and Pokemon Soul Silver.

00:58.720 --> 01:01.240
Are you really sure about that?

01:01.240 --> 01:02.360
I'm HIV positive.
