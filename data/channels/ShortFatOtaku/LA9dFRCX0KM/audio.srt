1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,360
So I was having a very enlightening conversation on stream last night. It was the The Last of Us 2

2
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:12,480
stream. And to be fair, I was actually doing quite poorly at it. And the main reason for that is

3
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:19,920
because, well, I was operating on about one and a half hours sleep. Yeah, it's it's it's been kind

4
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:26,480
of a rough, a rough past couple days, if you know what I mean. But nonetheless, my chatroom was

5
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:32,080
making some very good points. And I would like at least the opportunity to ruminate on them and

6
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:37,280
maybe answer some questions at a time when I have, you know, had a full night's sleep and had some

7
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:42,640
coffee and I'm actually kind of at least halfway put together right now. Okay, so the contention

8
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:48,640
was over my use of the terms, you know, leftist, centrist, and I guess rightist. And the way I've

9
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:52,960
always seen things is that you have, you know, the left-right spectrum of politics. I know that it's

10
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:58,720
it's very simplistic. Most people like to use either like the the eight axis spectrum of

11
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:03,520
politics. Sometimes they like to use the left-right freedom order grid of politics. I think all of

12
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:07,680
these tools have their place when talking about politics. The way that I conceptualize the the

13
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:12,720
one axis system where it's just left and right is that it's relatively unchanging and that the

14
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:19,040
Overton window is a box on this left-right politics that kind of shifts leftward or rightward

15
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:24,960
as basically the larger public opinion changes. Which is how, you know, my support in the late

16
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:31,360
1990s of say gay marriage and universal health care and things like that. Those were a very

17
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:37,200
solidly leftist position but as the Overton window has shifted much further left and now that it's

18
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:42,000
all about, you know, hard socialism or the demonization of masculinity and other things

19
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,880
like this that things have kind of gone too far left to me. Well within the Overton window I now

20
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:51,520
look like somebody who is right wing which is why a lot of the far left nowadays calls me right

21
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:57,440
wing. And why I call them the far left because see if the entire spectrum is left center right

22
00:01:57,440 --> 00:02:01,360
then I am still the center left and the far left is now the far left. However, and this is something

23
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:06,000
that I genuinely didn't know about this is this is news to me, some people actually view the left

24
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:12,240
right center labels as being part of the Overton window itself. So the definitions of left center

25
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:17,440
and right will change as the Overton window moves. Okay that makes sense to me. I think it's a dumb

26
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:21,680
way of doing things but if that is how we are going to understand these concepts then maybe we

27
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:26,000
should change up the conversation entirely. For example a person on discord DMed me this a couple

28
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:32,320
months ago and I wish I could remember which one it was. Was it Sushimaru? I'm sorry I can't remember

29
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:37,360
who it was. I'm sorry but you know who you are. You showed me this idea. Other than having an axis

30
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:42,720
with two ends you have a triangle. When the enlightenment basically philosophically shattered

31
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:48,000
the idea of the old theocracies and the old monarchies once and for all we got primarily

32
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,200
three schools of thought out of it and those three schools of thought are properly described by

33
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:59,280
the French motto liberty equality and fraternity with liberty generally mapping onto liberalism

34
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:04,800
equality generally mapping onto communism and fraternity generally mapping onto fascism.

35
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:10,960
These also correspondingly map onto the human values of freedom equality and tradition and

36
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:15,200
really it's it's not too hard to see how this is the case the liberals the original liberals the

37
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:19,680
classical liberals they're more concerned with personal freedom than they are with tradition

38
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:24,960
or equality the free speech of liberalism is a direct challenge to tradition meanwhile the free

39
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:29,760
markets of liberalism are a direct challenge to equality meanwhile the communist in valuing

40
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:34,640
equality over both freedom and tradition will try to see that everyone is equal oftentimes

41
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:38,720
they will claim to do this by raising everyone up to the highest standard but oftentimes that

42
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:43,600
is impossible and in practice communism often drags everyone to the lowest standard one of the

43
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:47,920
great jokes about communism is that we might all be poor but at least we're all equal fascism

44
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:53,280
meanwhile in its valuing of tradition over both freedom and equality always devolves into tyrannical

45
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:59,600
states that bind themselves together by some kind of unifying force with the Italians it was

46
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:05,200
nationalism with Germans it was the race but it's always some kind of characteristic like that

47
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:10,240
that keeps the society together so okay we've got these three schools of thought and they are all

48
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:15,600
opposed to each other in equal measure for example the liberal with freedom as his highest order value

49
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:20,560
correctly views both fascism and communism as being anti-freedom the traditional life that the

50
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:25,360
fascist would impose on everyone is fundamentally anti-freedom because people would not be free to

51
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:30,080
reject it meanwhile the redistribution policies that the communists would impose on the marketplace

52
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:35,040
as well as in practice the mass slaughtering of those people that they deemed to be the bourgeoisie

53
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:39,520
like say the kulaks the peasantry who were you know these serfs that finally managed to get

54
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:43,360
a little bit of land for themselves did well because they were actually competent farmers

55
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:47,520
and then got slaughtered by the soviets when they resisted the collectivization of their rightly

56
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:52,720
owned lands remember the kulaks were heroes sorry about that that little side rant my main point is

57
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:58,240
the liberal with freedom as his highest order value when push comes to shove will reject both

58
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:03,920
tradition and equality because those values in their purest form infringe on the freedom of the

59
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:09,840
individual meanwhile the communist with equality as his highest order value will reject both

60
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:15,360
freedom and tradition but for different reasons tradition because tradition because that is the

61
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:20,720
thing that they are trying to destroy they want to directly revolt and wash away those old orders and

62
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:24,320
all of their problems like with monarchy and feudalism as well as with what they perceive to

63
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:29,280
be problems in capitalism but they also do oppose individual freedom because freedom means the

64
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:34,160
freedom not to go along with their revolution that's why they label these people as bootlickers

65
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:39,920
as counter-revolutionary elements as reactionaries they do fundamentally believe that there is a

66
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:45,600
proper politics that there is only one way for progress to actually go that there is only one

67
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:50,400
path to follow so if you're a fascist and therefore in the name of tradition you reject

68
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:56,320
progress the communist will oppose you however if you are a liberal and therefore you don't reject

69
00:05:56,320 --> 00:06:01,600
progress but you have a different idea of what progress is if you don't agree with them well

70
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:05,920
then the communist will oppose you as well and this is also why communists often conflate

71
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:11,920
liberals and fascists you'll often see things like liberalism is the handmaiden of fascism or you'll

72
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:17,520
see fascism is just capitalism and decay you know stuff like this it's because they believe they

73
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:24,480
have an exclusive claim to what progressivism is they believe they are the arbiter of progress and

74
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:30,960
so even the act of debating it is to them fascism counter-intuitively enough it's why you constantly

75
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:36,640
see these people deplatforming others or initiating violence in the streets or slandering everyone who

76
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:40,800
doesn't agree with them as a nazi or something right meanwhile the fascist rejects the liberal

77
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:45,280
for the same reason that the liberal rejects the fascist freedom means having the option to not

78
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:49,760
be traditional or live a traditional life and if tradition is your highest order of value then

79
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:53,840
freedom is in natural opposition to that meanwhile tradition is also in natural opposition to

80
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:58,720
equality because the traditional hierarchy was not an equal one the old orders were not orders

81
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:02,800
of equality and therefore the communists and fascists also fundamentally disagreed on that

82
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:08,320
you'll notice that i've spent more time talking about the flaws of communism than the flaws of

83
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:13,360
fascism in this video so far that is not out of any love of the fascist rather it's because

84
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:17,760
i don't think we really need to go over the flaws of fascism anymore do we the 20th century kind of

85
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:22,720
showed the flaws pretty clearly of both fascism and communism to the point that i can't believe

86
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:27,360
we're still fucking debating it like 80 years later but the difference is as i talked about

87
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:32,800
in my yuri bezbanov video yesterday it's that fascists never culturally integrated themselves

88
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:37,280
into the west the way the communists did there are no fascist university professors teaching the next

89
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:41,520
round of kids to be white supremacists or something but there are a shit ton of marxists

90
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:45,360
out there i personally have had the unfortunate pleasure of being taught by a bunch of them and

91
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:51,280
i'm very grateful that i managed to pull myself out of that the point is you have this triangle

92
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:57,280
right of these opposing values and i'd say the classical liberal is probably about here if you

93
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:01,280
go extremely high up on the freedom scale you get to like the anarcho stuff like the anarcho

94
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:06,560
capitalists and stuff the classical liberal is is not quite so high you've got the basic bitch

95
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:11,360
conservative you know the conservative that you would find in like a regular first world democracy

96
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:15,680
they're going to be leaning a bit more towards order you have the social democrat who's probably

97
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:20,240
leaning a bit more towards equality but they still have some aspects of freedom in them you of course

98
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:24,960
have the pure fascist and the pure communist meanwhile the nazis specifically they were

99
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:29,440
actually probably a little bit more towards equality than freedom though they were definitely

100
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:33,120
still within tradition because if you read a lot of a lot of hitler's writings you'll realize

101
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:40,320
that he adopted some socialist policy he simply wanted to be a nationalized variant of it not a

102
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:46,400
globalized variant he wanted socialism for only the germans that's why it was national socialism

103
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:50,560
the mere image of that would probably be the tankies because you know the the stalin types

104
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:54,560
they weren't pure ideological communists but they definitely filled in that gap with

105
00:08:54,560 --> 00:09:00,880
authoritarianism and not personal freedom and so we have a very rough but i think at least

106
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:06,560
somewhat useful political map and since the terms leftist or or center left or right wing centrist

107
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:11,920
whatever they've kind of become nebulous i think i'm going to try and stick with with this graphic

108
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:17,360
from now on in terms of how i declare myself politically because i do believe myself to be

109
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:23,280
a classical liberal i'm not a communist i'm not a fascist personal freedom is the highest order

110
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:27,760
value for me and i think the most successful societies are the ones that value personal

111
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:34,320
freedom over both equality and tradition i spend so much of my time on this channel talking about

112
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:40,000
the communists because that seems to be the resurgent political ideology right now go over

113
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,720
to breadtube you can find a shit ton of socialist channels over there there's marxist apologists

114
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:49,760
all over the place is there actually like a resurgent fascism you got like guys like richard

115
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:54,800
spencer or or nick fuentes in the alt-right but who the hell are they does anyone care they had

116
00:09:54,800 --> 00:10:01,280
their peak like four years ago and they peaked at what maybe maybe at the most like 20 000 people

117
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:06,720
the remnants of what was once the alt-right basically just became ethan ralph's fan base

118
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:11,600
like there's nothing left to them they're absolutely gone the current political war

119
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:15,760
right now is between the liberals and the communists and because the communist views

120
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:21,680
liberalism and fascism as being hand in hand that's why they all call everyone fascist i've

121
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:26,480
been talking about all this for a while now because i want to show how liberalism communism

122
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:31,680
and fascism while they're connected they all oppose each other for very specific reasons

123
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:36,640
and they have connected yet different views on a lot of topics for example regarding the state the

124
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:41,440
liberal views the state as a necessary evil it exists as a night watchman it stays out of people's

125
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:46,640
way it has no real moral opinion and it only gets involved when someone's rights are violated

126
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:50,960
the socialist state meanwhile is a temporary evil because the socialist state is meant to transition

127
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:57,680
towards pure communism the state is totalitarian it is as marks described it a dictatorship of the

128
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:02,960
proletariat it's run by the workers revolution which spends its time forcibly re-educating the

129
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:08,000
people towards communist thought until the state can naturally wither away into a stateless society

130
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,160
so they view the state as a temporary evil the fascist meanwhile views the state as the ultimate

131
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:17,200
good the eternal mechanism through which the people are best expressed as mussolini wrote

132
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:21,280
and everything the people the property everything is subservient to the state

133
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:25,680
speaking of property the liberals view property as an inherently good thing they view it as an

134
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:30,480
expression of a person's labor if you work you create property or you get paid and money and then

135
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:33,840
use the money to buy property either way at some point you're working at something and you're

136
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:38,240
creating property out of it and in fact it's out of the concept of property that human rights come

137
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:43,200
about because we own our lives as if it is property we own our bodies as if they are property

138
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:48,400
communism meanwhile views property as inherently evil all property is communal property including

139
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:52,720
the individual and of course this view of property and money in the economy fails to take into

140
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:57,600
account natural human greed which believe it or not you can't be re-educated out of which is why

141
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:02,720
it always takes a tremendous amount of force directly from the government in order to impose

142
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:07,280
this sort of thing on the people that is the main reason why socialism will never actually

143
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:12,560
wither away and become communism because no bureaucracy ever voluntarily shrinks itself

144
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:16,880
meanwhile fascists view property as a necessary evil they recognize that people will work harder

145
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:21,760
if they work for themselves but ultimately all property is state-owned again including the

146
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:26,880
individual and speaking of the individual the liberal views the purpose of the state itself

147
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:32,000
to be the citizens of it the people create the state for their purposes laws are written at the

148
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,960
whim of the people the liberal state is almost like a patchwork piece where free people will

149
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:42,480
debate vote and ultimately change up the making of the state as circumstance demands socialism

150
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:47,600
views the citizen as inconsequential they hope for a global worldwide communist revolution and

151
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:53,040
everyone will simply be communal fascism meanwhile views people as being owned directly by the state

152
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:57,920
the state controls and guides them as an eternal father and while the liberals believe that the

153
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:02,880
people create the state the fascists believe that the state creates the people so while these three

154
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:08,320
forces exist in opposition to each other they also sometimes agree as you can see the liberals and

155
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:13,280
fascists both agree that the state should exist meanwhile the communists do not therefore the

156
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:19,040
communists often see the liberals as fascists or at least as fascist helpers or vulnerable to

157
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:24,320
fascism liberals and communists both hate the elitism of the fascist the purpose of the fascist

158
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:29,840
state is to create and enforce a strict hierarchy of power while the communist wishes to do away

159
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:34,400
with hierarchy altogether and the liberal prefers a hierarchy of competence communists and fascists

160
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:39,360
both agree with mass slavery fascism enslaves people directly in the name of the state

161
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:42,640
communism does it indirectly by the collectivization of the means of production

162
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:47,600
and the mass re-education of people to think the same way which in practice also results in slavery

163
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:53,200
the liberal opposes both communism and fascism as revolutionary ideologies destructive to the

164
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:58,000
freedom of the individual so with this in place you can kind of see why someone from a liberal

165
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,400
point of view will look at a communist and a fascist and say those are both totalitarian

166
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:05,920
they're anti-freedom i don't want that the communist meanwhile looks at a liberal

167
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:12,080
and screams fascist nazi collaborator bootlicker etc etc meanwhile the fascist views both of them

168
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:17,040
as disorderly as rejecting the natural state of the world some of my fans have linked to me

169
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:22,320
i i'd say about five different breadtubers at this point voshes is only one of them

170
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:25,760
but five different breadtubers who have done videos on me people who have done you know

171
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:30,960
reply girl videos to some of the things that i've done um i haven't really watched much of them to

172
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:35,040
be honest you know the drama scene is not exactly my cup of tea anymore you know but even though i

173
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:39,120
don't watch those videos fans of those communities definitely come into my videos and start leaving

174
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:42,800
comments and starting debates that's fine of course that's their freedom of speech but in

175
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:49,280
talking with them i've kind of discovered a few things um i've discovered why these people think

176
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:54,720
the way that they do about progress you know we we had the whole reactionary video we had we had

177
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:59,360
the talk on progressivism what progress is and that's because in general the communist worships

178
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:03,760
progress they are an entirely materialistic philosophy there's no there's no spiritual

179
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:07,440
aspect to them at all they're all about progress but they're all about a very narrow definition of

180
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:12,160
what progress is and it's also why i think most people who are who are progressives or who are

181
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:15,680
on the progressive left or whatever i think that's why most of them end up being communists or

182
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:21,520
socialists in the end but the fascist rejects the idea of progress entirely in favor of tradition

183
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:26,720
they say no that's something new that's progress we're not going that way we are sticking to the

184
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:31,200
old ways that is the way of the fascist meanwhile the liberal is different from both of these things

185
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:35,680
the liberal doesn't reject progress as a concept the way that the fascist does but the liberal

186
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:40,960
does not agree with the narrow-minded definition of what progress is that the communist believes

187
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:46,880
in the communist you know skimmed over the little red book and said oh this is the road map of

188
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:50,960
progress we follow these steps like their commandments and will reach the promised land

189
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:56,000
the communist utopia the communists lacking a spiritual aspect of their philosophy and being

190
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:01,280
entirely materialistic worship progressivism as if it is a religion in a sense they believe that

191
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:07,440
there is only one path for humanity to take for things to progress and that everyone who doesn't

192
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:12,320
follow that path is a reactionary a counter-revolutionary something like that i talked

193
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:15,600
about this a little bit at the start of the video but but here's kind of the main point the liberal's

194
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:19,920
view of progress is much broader than the socialist's view of progress for the liberal

195
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:25,840
progress is a spectrum you could say for the liberal what progress is isn't predetermined or

196
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:31,440
predefined written by a prophet in an ancient text or by a philosopher in a manifesto progress is the

197
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:36,560
future it's the unknown we don't know what progress is how can you know the thing that you haven't

198
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:42,800
thought up yet so for the liberal progress is experimentation progress is trying new things

199
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:49,040
progress is a thousand different paths that may or may not lead somewhere it is not inherited knowledge

200
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:54,080
brought down it is not inherited knowledge brought down by god himself meanwhile the

201
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:58,720
socialist believes that they have the perfect knowledge of what progressivism is they believe

202
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:04,240
that they have the perfect politics they know the one true way just like every other religious zealot

203
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:08,320
and therefore every person who disagrees with them regardless of whether they're disagreeing with them

204
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:13,280
on the utility of progress itself or the direction that progress should take they're labeled as a

205
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:18,720
heretic or you know a reactionary and since the ideological war right now is between the

206
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:23,920
liberals and the socialists and this war is fought not over whether or not we should progress

207
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:29,360
but what form that progress should take it is no surprise to me that breadtubers for example

208
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:35,120
view liberals as reactionaries just like the communists view liberals as fascists if they

209
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:40,320
categorically understand the one true path of progress then everyone else's opinion

210
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:44,480
must simply be going backwards but we know that's not the truth of the matter

211
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:49,840
all right i'm done guys make sure to speak freely i'll talk to you next time i love you
