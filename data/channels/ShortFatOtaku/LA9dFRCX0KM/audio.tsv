0	5360	So I was having a very enlightening conversation on stream last night. It was the The Last of Us 2
5360	12480	stream. And to be fair, I was actually doing quite poorly at it. And the main reason for that is
12480	19920	because, well, I was operating on about one and a half hours sleep. Yeah, it's it's it's been kind
19920	26480	of a rough, a rough past couple days, if you know what I mean. But nonetheless, my chatroom was
26480	32080	making some very good points. And I would like at least the opportunity to ruminate on them and
32080	37280	maybe answer some questions at a time when I have, you know, had a full night's sleep and had some
37280	42640	coffee and I'm actually kind of at least halfway put together right now. Okay, so the contention
42640	48640	was over my use of the terms, you know, leftist, centrist, and I guess rightist. And the way I've
48640	52960	always seen things is that you have, you know, the left-right spectrum of politics. I know that it's
53440	58720	it's very simplistic. Most people like to use either like the the eight axis spectrum of
58720	63520	politics. Sometimes they like to use the left-right freedom order grid of politics. I think all of
63520	67680	these tools have their place when talking about politics. The way that I conceptualize the the
67680	72720	one axis system where it's just left and right is that it's relatively unchanging and that the
72720	79040	Overton window is a box on this left-right politics that kind of shifts leftward or rightward
79040	84960	as basically the larger public opinion changes. Which is how, you know, my support in the late
84960	91360	1990s of say gay marriage and universal health care and things like that. Those were a very
91360	97200	solidly leftist position but as the Overton window has shifted much further left and now that it's
97200	102000	all about, you know, hard socialism or the demonization of masculinity and other things
102000	106880	like this that things have kind of gone too far left to me. Well within the Overton window I now
106880	111520	look like somebody who is right wing which is why a lot of the far left nowadays calls me right
111520	117440	wing. And why I call them the far left because see if the entire spectrum is left center right
117440	121360	then I am still the center left and the far left is now the far left. However, and this is something
121360	126000	that I genuinely didn't know about this is this is news to me, some people actually view the left
126000	132240	right center labels as being part of the Overton window itself. So the definitions of left center
132240	137440	and right will change as the Overton window moves. Okay that makes sense to me. I think it's a dumb
137440	141680	way of doing things but if that is how we are going to understand these concepts then maybe we
141680	146000	should change up the conversation entirely. For example a person on discord DMed me this a couple
146000	152320	months ago and I wish I could remember which one it was. Was it Sushimaru? I'm sorry I can't remember
152320	157360	who it was. I'm sorry but you know who you are. You showed me this idea. Other than having an axis
157360	162720	with two ends you have a triangle. When the enlightenment basically philosophically shattered
162720	168000	the idea of the old theocracies and the old monarchies once and for all we got primarily
168000	173200	three schools of thought out of it and those three schools of thought are properly described by
173200	179280	the French motto liberty equality and fraternity with liberty generally mapping onto liberalism
179280	184800	equality generally mapping onto communism and fraternity generally mapping onto fascism.
184800	190960	These also correspondingly map onto the human values of freedom equality and tradition and
190960	195200	really it's it's not too hard to see how this is the case the liberals the original liberals the
195200	199680	classical liberals they're more concerned with personal freedom than they are with tradition
199680	204960	or equality the free speech of liberalism is a direct challenge to tradition meanwhile the free
204960	209760	markets of liberalism are a direct challenge to equality meanwhile the communist in valuing
209760	214640	equality over both freedom and tradition will try to see that everyone is equal oftentimes
214640	218720	they will claim to do this by raising everyone up to the highest standard but oftentimes that
218720	223600	is impossible and in practice communism often drags everyone to the lowest standard one of the
223600	227920	great jokes about communism is that we might all be poor but at least we're all equal fascism
227920	233280	meanwhile in its valuing of tradition over both freedom and equality always devolves into tyrannical
233280	239600	states that bind themselves together by some kind of unifying force with the Italians it was
239600	245200	nationalism with Germans it was the race but it's always some kind of characteristic like that
245200	250240	that keeps the society together so okay we've got these three schools of thought and they are all
250240	255600	opposed to each other in equal measure for example the liberal with freedom as his highest order value
255600	260560	correctly views both fascism and communism as being anti-freedom the traditional life that the
260560	265360	fascist would impose on everyone is fundamentally anti-freedom because people would not be free to
265360	270080	reject it meanwhile the redistribution policies that the communists would impose on the marketplace
270080	275040	as well as in practice the mass slaughtering of those people that they deemed to be the bourgeoisie
275040	279520	like say the kulaks the peasantry who were you know these serfs that finally managed to get
279520	283360	a little bit of land for themselves did well because they were actually competent farmers
283360	287520	and then got slaughtered by the soviets when they resisted the collectivization of their rightly
287520	292720	owned lands remember the kulaks were heroes sorry about that that little side rant my main point is
292720	298240	the liberal with freedom as his highest order value when push comes to shove will reject both
298240	303920	tradition and equality because those values in their purest form infringe on the freedom of the
303920	309840	individual meanwhile the communist with equality as his highest order value will reject both
309840	315360	freedom and tradition but for different reasons tradition because tradition because that is the
315360	320720	thing that they are trying to destroy they want to directly revolt and wash away those old orders and
320720	324320	all of their problems like with monarchy and feudalism as well as with what they perceive to
324320	329280	be problems in capitalism but they also do oppose individual freedom because freedom means the
329280	334160	freedom not to go along with their revolution that's why they label these people as bootlickers
334160	339920	as counter-revolutionary elements as reactionaries they do fundamentally believe that there is a
339920	345600	proper politics that there is only one way for progress to actually go that there is only one
345600	350400	path to follow so if you're a fascist and therefore in the name of tradition you reject
350400	356320	progress the communist will oppose you however if you are a liberal and therefore you don't reject
356320	361600	progress but you have a different idea of what progress is if you don't agree with them well
361600	365920	then the communist will oppose you as well and this is also why communists often conflate
365920	371920	liberals and fascists you'll often see things like liberalism is the handmaiden of fascism or you'll
371920	377520	see fascism is just capitalism and decay you know stuff like this it's because they believe they
377520	384480	have an exclusive claim to what progressivism is they believe they are the arbiter of progress and
384480	390960	so even the act of debating it is to them fascism counter-intuitively enough it's why you constantly
390960	396640	see these people deplatforming others or initiating violence in the streets or slandering everyone who
396640	400800	doesn't agree with them as a nazi or something right meanwhile the fascist rejects the liberal
400800	405280	for the same reason that the liberal rejects the fascist freedom means having the option to not
405280	409760	be traditional or live a traditional life and if tradition is your highest order of value then
409760	413840	freedom is in natural opposition to that meanwhile tradition is also in natural opposition to
413840	418720	equality because the traditional hierarchy was not an equal one the old orders were not orders
418720	422800	of equality and therefore the communists and fascists also fundamentally disagreed on that
422800	428320	you'll notice that i've spent more time talking about the flaws of communism than the flaws of
428320	433360	fascism in this video so far that is not out of any love of the fascist rather it's because
433360	437760	i don't think we really need to go over the flaws of fascism anymore do we the 20th century kind of
437760	442720	showed the flaws pretty clearly of both fascism and communism to the point that i can't believe
442720	447360	we're still fucking debating it like 80 years later but the difference is as i talked about
447360	452800	in my yuri bezbanov video yesterday it's that fascists never culturally integrated themselves
452800	457280	into the west the way the communists did there are no fascist university professors teaching the next
457280	461520	round of kids to be white supremacists or something but there are a shit ton of marxists
461520	465360	out there i personally have had the unfortunate pleasure of being taught by a bunch of them and
465360	471280	i'm very grateful that i managed to pull myself out of that the point is you have this triangle
471280	477280	right of these opposing values and i'd say the classical liberal is probably about here if you
477280	481280	go extremely high up on the freedom scale you get to like the anarcho stuff like the anarcho
481280	486560	capitalists and stuff the classical liberal is is not quite so high you've got the basic bitch
486560	491360	conservative you know the conservative that you would find in like a regular first world democracy
491360	495680	they're going to be leaning a bit more towards order you have the social democrat who's probably
495680	500240	leaning a bit more towards equality but they still have some aspects of freedom in them you of course
500240	504960	have the pure fascist and the pure communist meanwhile the nazis specifically they were
504960	509440	actually probably a little bit more towards equality than freedom though they were definitely
509440	513120	still within tradition because if you read a lot of a lot of hitler's writings you'll realize
513680	520320	that he adopted some socialist policy he simply wanted to be a nationalized variant of it not a
520320	526400	globalized variant he wanted socialism for only the germans that's why it was national socialism
526400	530560	the mere image of that would probably be the tankies because you know the the stalin types
530560	534560	they weren't pure ideological communists but they definitely filled in that gap with
534560	540880	authoritarianism and not personal freedom and so we have a very rough but i think at least
540880	546560	somewhat useful political map and since the terms leftist or or center left or right wing centrist
546560	551920	whatever they've kind of become nebulous i think i'm going to try and stick with with this graphic
551920	557360	from now on in terms of how i declare myself politically because i do believe myself to be
557360	563280	a classical liberal i'm not a communist i'm not a fascist personal freedom is the highest order
563280	567760	value for me and i think the most successful societies are the ones that value personal
567760	574320	freedom over both equality and tradition i spend so much of my time on this channel talking about
574320	580000	the communists because that seems to be the resurgent political ideology right now go over
580000	584720	to breadtube you can find a shit ton of socialist channels over there there's marxist apologists
584720	589760	all over the place is there actually like a resurgent fascism you got like guys like richard
589760	594800	spencer or or nick fuentes in the alt-right but who the hell are they does anyone care they had
594800	601280	their peak like four years ago and they peaked at what maybe maybe at the most like 20 000 people
601280	606720	the remnants of what was once the alt-right basically just became ethan ralph's fan base
606720	611600	like there's nothing left to them they're absolutely gone the current political war
611600	615760	right now is between the liberals and the communists and because the communist views
615760	621680	liberalism and fascism as being hand in hand that's why they all call everyone fascist i've
621680	626480	been talking about all this for a while now because i want to show how liberalism communism
626480	631680	and fascism while they're connected they all oppose each other for very specific reasons
631680	636640	and they have connected yet different views on a lot of topics for example regarding the state the
636640	641440	liberal views the state as a necessary evil it exists as a night watchman it stays out of people's
641440	646640	way it has no real moral opinion and it only gets involved when someone's rights are violated
646640	650960	the socialist state meanwhile is a temporary evil because the socialist state is meant to transition
650960	657680	towards pure communism the state is totalitarian it is as marks described it a dictatorship of the
657680	662960	proletariat it's run by the workers revolution which spends its time forcibly re-educating the
662960	668000	people towards communist thought until the state can naturally wither away into a stateless society
668000	672160	so they view the state as a temporary evil the fascist meanwhile views the state as the ultimate
672160	677200	good the eternal mechanism through which the people are best expressed as mussolini wrote
677200	681280	and everything the people the property everything is subservient to the state
681280	685680	speaking of property the liberals view property as an inherently good thing they view it as an
685680	690480	expression of a person's labor if you work you create property or you get paid and money and then
690480	693840	use the money to buy property either way at some point you're working at something and you're
693840	698240	creating property out of it and in fact it's out of the concept of property that human rights come
698240	703200	about because we own our lives as if it is property we own our bodies as if they are property
703200	708400	communism meanwhile views property as inherently evil all property is communal property including
708400	712720	the individual and of course this view of property and money in the economy fails to take into
712720	717600	account natural human greed which believe it or not you can't be re-educated out of which is why
717600	722720	it always takes a tremendous amount of force directly from the government in order to impose
722720	727280	this sort of thing on the people that is the main reason why socialism will never actually
727280	732560	wither away and become communism because no bureaucracy ever voluntarily shrinks itself
732560	736880	meanwhile fascists view property as a necessary evil they recognize that people will work harder
736880	741760	if they work for themselves but ultimately all property is state-owned again including the
741760	746880	individual and speaking of the individual the liberal views the purpose of the state itself
746880	752000	to be the citizens of it the people create the state for their purposes laws are written at the
752000	756960	whim of the people the liberal state is almost like a patchwork piece where free people will
756960	762480	debate vote and ultimately change up the making of the state as circumstance demands socialism
762480	767600	views the citizen as inconsequential they hope for a global worldwide communist revolution and
767600	773040	everyone will simply be communal fascism meanwhile views people as being owned directly by the state
773040	777920	the state controls and guides them as an eternal father and while the liberals believe that the
777920	782880	people create the state the fascists believe that the state creates the people so while these three
782880	788320	forces exist in opposition to each other they also sometimes agree as you can see the liberals and
788320	793280	fascists both agree that the state should exist meanwhile the communists do not therefore the
793280	799040	communists often see the liberals as fascists or at least as fascist helpers or vulnerable to
799040	804320	fascism liberals and communists both hate the elitism of the fascist the purpose of the fascist
804320	809840	state is to create and enforce a strict hierarchy of power while the communist wishes to do away
809840	814400	with hierarchy altogether and the liberal prefers a hierarchy of competence communists and fascists
814400	819360	both agree with mass slavery fascism enslaves people directly in the name of the state
819360	822640	communism does it indirectly by the collectivization of the means of production
822640	827600	and the mass re-education of people to think the same way which in practice also results in slavery
827600	833200	the liberal opposes both communism and fascism as revolutionary ideologies destructive to the
833200	838000	freedom of the individual so with this in place you can kind of see why someone from a liberal
838000	842400	point of view will look at a communist and a fascist and say those are both totalitarian
842400	845920	they're anti-freedom i don't want that the communist meanwhile looks at a liberal
845920	852080	and screams fascist nazi collaborator bootlicker etc etc meanwhile the fascist views both of them
852080	857040	as disorderly as rejecting the natural state of the world some of my fans have linked to me
857680	862320	i i'd say about five different breadtubers at this point voshes is only one of them
862320	865760	but five different breadtubers who have done videos on me people who have done you know
865760	870960	reply girl videos to some of the things that i've done um i haven't really watched much of them to
870960	875040	be honest you know the drama scene is not exactly my cup of tea anymore you know but even though i
875040	879120	don't watch those videos fans of those communities definitely come into my videos and start leaving
879120	882800	comments and starting debates that's fine of course that's their freedom of speech but in
882800	889280	talking with them i've kind of discovered a few things um i've discovered why these people think
889280	894720	the way that they do about progress you know we we had the whole reactionary video we had we had
894720	899360	the talk on progressivism what progress is and that's because in general the communist worships
899360	903760	progress they are an entirely materialistic philosophy there's no there's no spiritual
903760	907440	aspect to them at all they're all about progress but they're all about a very narrow definition of
907440	912160	what progress is and it's also why i think most people who are who are progressives or who are
912160	915680	on the progressive left or whatever i think that's why most of them end up being communists or
915680	921520	socialists in the end but the fascist rejects the idea of progress entirely in favor of tradition
921520	926720	they say no that's something new that's progress we're not going that way we are sticking to the
926720	931200	old ways that is the way of the fascist meanwhile the liberal is different from both of these things
931200	935680	the liberal doesn't reject progress as a concept the way that the fascist does but the liberal
935680	940960	does not agree with the narrow-minded definition of what progress is that the communist believes
940960	946880	in the communist you know skimmed over the little red book and said oh this is the road map of
946880	950960	progress we follow these steps like their commandments and will reach the promised land
950960	956000	the communist utopia the communists lacking a spiritual aspect of their philosophy and being
956000	961280	entirely materialistic worship progressivism as if it is a religion in a sense they believe that
961280	967440	there is only one path for humanity to take for things to progress and that everyone who doesn't
967440	972320	follow that path is a reactionary a counter-revolutionary something like that i talked
972320	975600	about this a little bit at the start of the video but but here's kind of the main point the liberal's
975600	979920	view of progress is much broader than the socialist's view of progress for the liberal
979920	985840	progress is a spectrum you could say for the liberal what progress is isn't predetermined or
985840	991440	predefined written by a prophet in an ancient text or by a philosopher in a manifesto progress is the
991440	996560	future it's the unknown we don't know what progress is how can you know the thing that you haven't
996560	1002800	thought up yet so for the liberal progress is experimentation progress is trying new things
1002800	1009040	progress is a thousand different paths that may or may not lead somewhere it is not inherited knowledge
1009040	1014080	brought down it is not inherited knowledge brought down by god himself meanwhile the
1014080	1018720	socialist believes that they have the perfect knowledge of what progressivism is they believe
1018720	1024240	that they have the perfect politics they know the one true way just like every other religious zealot
1024240	1028320	and therefore every person who disagrees with them regardless of whether they're disagreeing with them
1028320	1033280	on the utility of progress itself or the direction that progress should take they're labeled as a
1033280	1038720	heretic or you know a reactionary and since the ideological war right now is between the
1038720	1043920	liberals and the socialists and this war is fought not over whether or not we should progress
1043920	1049360	but what form that progress should take it is no surprise to me that breadtubers for example
1049360	1055120	view liberals as reactionaries just like the communists view liberals as fascists if they
1055120	1060320	categorically understand the one true path of progress then everyone else's opinion
1060320	1064480	must simply be going backwards but we know that's not the truth of the matter
1064480	1069840	all right i'm done guys make sure to speak freely i'll talk to you next time i love you
