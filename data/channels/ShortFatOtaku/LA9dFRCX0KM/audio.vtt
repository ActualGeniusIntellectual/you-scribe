00:00.000 --> 00:05.360
So I was having a very enlightening conversation on stream last night. It was the The Last of Us 2

00:05.360 --> 00:12.480
stream. And to be fair, I was actually doing quite poorly at it. And the main reason for that is

00:12.480 --> 00:19.920
because, well, I was operating on about one and a half hours sleep. Yeah, it's it's it's been kind

00:19.920 --> 00:26.480
of a rough, a rough past couple days, if you know what I mean. But nonetheless, my chatroom was

00:26.480 --> 00:32.080
making some very good points. And I would like at least the opportunity to ruminate on them and

00:32.080 --> 00:37.280
maybe answer some questions at a time when I have, you know, had a full night's sleep and had some

00:37.280 --> 00:42.640
coffee and I'm actually kind of at least halfway put together right now. Okay, so the contention

00:42.640 --> 00:48.640
was over my use of the terms, you know, leftist, centrist, and I guess rightist. And the way I've

00:48.640 --> 00:52.960
always seen things is that you have, you know, the left-right spectrum of politics. I know that it's

00:53.440 --> 00:58.720
it's very simplistic. Most people like to use either like the the eight axis spectrum of

00:58.720 --> 01:03.520
politics. Sometimes they like to use the left-right freedom order grid of politics. I think all of

01:03.520 --> 01:07.680
these tools have their place when talking about politics. The way that I conceptualize the the

01:07.680 --> 01:12.720
one axis system where it's just left and right is that it's relatively unchanging and that the

01:12.720 --> 01:19.040
Overton window is a box on this left-right politics that kind of shifts leftward or rightward

01:19.040 --> 01:24.960
as basically the larger public opinion changes. Which is how, you know, my support in the late

01:24.960 --> 01:31.360
1990s of say gay marriage and universal health care and things like that. Those were a very

01:31.360 --> 01:37.200
solidly leftist position but as the Overton window has shifted much further left and now that it's

01:37.200 --> 01:42.000
all about, you know, hard socialism or the demonization of masculinity and other things

01:42.000 --> 01:46.880
like this that things have kind of gone too far left to me. Well within the Overton window I now

01:46.880 --> 01:51.520
look like somebody who is right wing which is why a lot of the far left nowadays calls me right

01:51.520 --> 01:57.440
wing. And why I call them the far left because see if the entire spectrum is left center right

01:57.440 --> 02:01.360
then I am still the center left and the far left is now the far left. However, and this is something

02:01.360 --> 02:06.000
that I genuinely didn't know about this is this is news to me, some people actually view the left

02:06.000 --> 02:12.240
right center labels as being part of the Overton window itself. So the definitions of left center

02:12.240 --> 02:17.440
and right will change as the Overton window moves. Okay that makes sense to me. I think it's a dumb

02:17.440 --> 02:21.680
way of doing things but if that is how we are going to understand these concepts then maybe we

02:21.680 --> 02:26.000
should change up the conversation entirely. For example a person on discord DMed me this a couple

02:26.000 --> 02:32.320
months ago and I wish I could remember which one it was. Was it Sushimaru? I'm sorry I can't remember

02:32.320 --> 02:37.360
who it was. I'm sorry but you know who you are. You showed me this idea. Other than having an axis

02:37.360 --> 02:42.720
with two ends you have a triangle. When the enlightenment basically philosophically shattered

02:42.720 --> 02:48.000
the idea of the old theocracies and the old monarchies once and for all we got primarily

02:48.000 --> 02:53.200
three schools of thought out of it and those three schools of thought are properly described by

02:53.200 --> 02:59.280
the French motto liberty equality and fraternity with liberty generally mapping onto liberalism

02:59.280 --> 03:04.800
equality generally mapping onto communism and fraternity generally mapping onto fascism.

03:04.800 --> 03:10.960
These also correspondingly map onto the human values of freedom equality and tradition and

03:10.960 --> 03:15.200
really it's it's not too hard to see how this is the case the liberals the original liberals the

03:15.200 --> 03:19.680
classical liberals they're more concerned with personal freedom than they are with tradition

03:19.680 --> 03:24.960
or equality the free speech of liberalism is a direct challenge to tradition meanwhile the free

03:24.960 --> 03:29.760
markets of liberalism are a direct challenge to equality meanwhile the communist in valuing

03:29.760 --> 03:34.640
equality over both freedom and tradition will try to see that everyone is equal oftentimes

03:34.640 --> 03:38.720
they will claim to do this by raising everyone up to the highest standard but oftentimes that

03:38.720 --> 03:43.600
is impossible and in practice communism often drags everyone to the lowest standard one of the

03:43.600 --> 03:47.920
great jokes about communism is that we might all be poor but at least we're all equal fascism

03:47.920 --> 03:53.280
meanwhile in its valuing of tradition over both freedom and equality always devolves into tyrannical

03:53.280 --> 03:59.600
states that bind themselves together by some kind of unifying force with the Italians it was

03:59.600 --> 04:05.200
nationalism with Germans it was the race but it's always some kind of characteristic like that

04:05.200 --> 04:10.240
that keeps the society together so okay we've got these three schools of thought and they are all

04:10.240 --> 04:15.600
opposed to each other in equal measure for example the liberal with freedom as his highest order value

04:15.600 --> 04:20.560
correctly views both fascism and communism as being anti-freedom the traditional life that the

04:20.560 --> 04:25.360
fascist would impose on everyone is fundamentally anti-freedom because people would not be free to

04:25.360 --> 04:30.080
reject it meanwhile the redistribution policies that the communists would impose on the marketplace

04:30.080 --> 04:35.040
as well as in practice the mass slaughtering of those people that they deemed to be the bourgeoisie

04:35.040 --> 04:39.520
like say the kulaks the peasantry who were you know these serfs that finally managed to get

04:39.520 --> 04:43.360
a little bit of land for themselves did well because they were actually competent farmers

04:43.360 --> 04:47.520
and then got slaughtered by the soviets when they resisted the collectivization of their rightly

04:47.520 --> 04:52.720
owned lands remember the kulaks were heroes sorry about that that little side rant my main point is

04:52.720 --> 04:58.240
the liberal with freedom as his highest order value when push comes to shove will reject both

04:58.240 --> 05:03.920
tradition and equality because those values in their purest form infringe on the freedom of the

05:03.920 --> 05:09.840
individual meanwhile the communist with equality as his highest order value will reject both

05:09.840 --> 05:15.360
freedom and tradition but for different reasons tradition because tradition because that is the

05:15.360 --> 05:20.720
thing that they are trying to destroy they want to directly revolt and wash away those old orders and

05:20.720 --> 05:24.320
all of their problems like with monarchy and feudalism as well as with what they perceive to

05:24.320 --> 05:29.280
be problems in capitalism but they also do oppose individual freedom because freedom means the

05:29.280 --> 05:34.160
freedom not to go along with their revolution that's why they label these people as bootlickers

05:34.160 --> 05:39.920
as counter-revolutionary elements as reactionaries they do fundamentally believe that there is a

05:39.920 --> 05:45.600
proper politics that there is only one way for progress to actually go that there is only one

05:45.600 --> 05:50.400
path to follow so if you're a fascist and therefore in the name of tradition you reject

05:50.400 --> 05:56.320
progress the communist will oppose you however if you are a liberal and therefore you don't reject

05:56.320 --> 06:01.600
progress but you have a different idea of what progress is if you don't agree with them well

06:01.600 --> 06:05.920
then the communist will oppose you as well and this is also why communists often conflate

06:05.920 --> 06:11.920
liberals and fascists you'll often see things like liberalism is the handmaiden of fascism or you'll

06:11.920 --> 06:17.520
see fascism is just capitalism and decay you know stuff like this it's because they believe they

06:17.520 --> 06:24.480
have an exclusive claim to what progressivism is they believe they are the arbiter of progress and

06:24.480 --> 06:30.960
so even the act of debating it is to them fascism counter-intuitively enough it's why you constantly

06:30.960 --> 06:36.640
see these people deplatforming others or initiating violence in the streets or slandering everyone who

06:36.640 --> 06:40.800
doesn't agree with them as a nazi or something right meanwhile the fascist rejects the liberal

06:40.800 --> 06:45.280
for the same reason that the liberal rejects the fascist freedom means having the option to not

06:45.280 --> 06:49.760
be traditional or live a traditional life and if tradition is your highest order of value then

06:49.760 --> 06:53.840
freedom is in natural opposition to that meanwhile tradition is also in natural opposition to

06:53.840 --> 06:58.720
equality because the traditional hierarchy was not an equal one the old orders were not orders

06:58.720 --> 07:02.800
of equality and therefore the communists and fascists also fundamentally disagreed on that

07:02.800 --> 07:08.320
you'll notice that i've spent more time talking about the flaws of communism than the flaws of

07:08.320 --> 07:13.360
fascism in this video so far that is not out of any love of the fascist rather it's because

07:13.360 --> 07:17.760
i don't think we really need to go over the flaws of fascism anymore do we the 20th century kind of

07:17.760 --> 07:22.720
showed the flaws pretty clearly of both fascism and communism to the point that i can't believe

07:22.720 --> 07:27.360
we're still fucking debating it like 80 years later but the difference is as i talked about

07:27.360 --> 07:32.800
in my yuri bezbanov video yesterday it's that fascists never culturally integrated themselves

07:32.800 --> 07:37.280
into the west the way the communists did there are no fascist university professors teaching the next

07:37.280 --> 07:41.520
round of kids to be white supremacists or something but there are a shit ton of marxists

07:41.520 --> 07:45.360
out there i personally have had the unfortunate pleasure of being taught by a bunch of them and

07:45.360 --> 07:51.280
i'm very grateful that i managed to pull myself out of that the point is you have this triangle

07:51.280 --> 07:57.280
right of these opposing values and i'd say the classical liberal is probably about here if you

07:57.280 --> 08:01.280
go extremely high up on the freedom scale you get to like the anarcho stuff like the anarcho

08:01.280 --> 08:06.560
capitalists and stuff the classical liberal is is not quite so high you've got the basic bitch

08:06.560 --> 08:11.360
conservative you know the conservative that you would find in like a regular first world democracy

08:11.360 --> 08:15.680
they're going to be leaning a bit more towards order you have the social democrat who's probably

08:15.680 --> 08:20.240
leaning a bit more towards equality but they still have some aspects of freedom in them you of course

08:20.240 --> 08:24.960
have the pure fascist and the pure communist meanwhile the nazis specifically they were

08:24.960 --> 08:29.440
actually probably a little bit more towards equality than freedom though they were definitely

08:29.440 --> 08:33.120
still within tradition because if you read a lot of a lot of hitler's writings you'll realize

08:33.680 --> 08:40.320
that he adopted some socialist policy he simply wanted to be a nationalized variant of it not a

08:40.320 --> 08:46.400
globalized variant he wanted socialism for only the germans that's why it was national socialism

08:46.400 --> 08:50.560
the mere image of that would probably be the tankies because you know the the stalin types

08:50.560 --> 08:54.560
they weren't pure ideological communists but they definitely filled in that gap with

08:54.560 --> 09:00.880
authoritarianism and not personal freedom and so we have a very rough but i think at least

09:00.880 --> 09:06.560
somewhat useful political map and since the terms leftist or or center left or right wing centrist

09:06.560 --> 09:11.920
whatever they've kind of become nebulous i think i'm going to try and stick with with this graphic

09:11.920 --> 09:17.360
from now on in terms of how i declare myself politically because i do believe myself to be

09:17.360 --> 09:23.280
a classical liberal i'm not a communist i'm not a fascist personal freedom is the highest order

09:23.280 --> 09:27.760
value for me and i think the most successful societies are the ones that value personal

09:27.760 --> 09:34.320
freedom over both equality and tradition i spend so much of my time on this channel talking about

09:34.320 --> 09:40.000
the communists because that seems to be the resurgent political ideology right now go over

09:40.000 --> 09:44.720
to breadtube you can find a shit ton of socialist channels over there there's marxist apologists

09:44.720 --> 09:49.760
all over the place is there actually like a resurgent fascism you got like guys like richard

09:49.760 --> 09:54.800
spencer or or nick fuentes in the alt-right but who the hell are they does anyone care they had

09:54.800 --> 10:01.280
their peak like four years ago and they peaked at what maybe maybe at the most like 20 000 people

10:01.280 --> 10:06.720
the remnants of what was once the alt-right basically just became ethan ralph's fan base

10:06.720 --> 10:11.600
like there's nothing left to them they're absolutely gone the current political war

10:11.600 --> 10:15.760
right now is between the liberals and the communists and because the communist views

10:15.760 --> 10:21.680
liberalism and fascism as being hand in hand that's why they all call everyone fascist i've

10:21.680 --> 10:26.480
been talking about all this for a while now because i want to show how liberalism communism

10:26.480 --> 10:31.680
and fascism while they're connected they all oppose each other for very specific reasons

10:31.680 --> 10:36.640
and they have connected yet different views on a lot of topics for example regarding the state the

10:36.640 --> 10:41.440
liberal views the state as a necessary evil it exists as a night watchman it stays out of people's

10:41.440 --> 10:46.640
way it has no real moral opinion and it only gets involved when someone's rights are violated

10:46.640 --> 10:50.960
the socialist state meanwhile is a temporary evil because the socialist state is meant to transition

10:50.960 --> 10:57.680
towards pure communism the state is totalitarian it is as marks described it a dictatorship of the

10:57.680 --> 11:02.960
proletariat it's run by the workers revolution which spends its time forcibly re-educating the

11:02.960 --> 11:08.000
people towards communist thought until the state can naturally wither away into a stateless society

11:08.000 --> 11:12.160
so they view the state as a temporary evil the fascist meanwhile views the state as the ultimate

11:12.160 --> 11:17.200
good the eternal mechanism through which the people are best expressed as mussolini wrote

11:17.200 --> 11:21.280
and everything the people the property everything is subservient to the state

11:21.280 --> 11:25.680
speaking of property the liberals view property as an inherently good thing they view it as an

11:25.680 --> 11:30.480
expression of a person's labor if you work you create property or you get paid and money and then

11:30.480 --> 11:33.840
use the money to buy property either way at some point you're working at something and you're

11:33.840 --> 11:38.240
creating property out of it and in fact it's out of the concept of property that human rights come

11:38.240 --> 11:43.200
about because we own our lives as if it is property we own our bodies as if they are property

11:43.200 --> 11:48.400
communism meanwhile views property as inherently evil all property is communal property including

11:48.400 --> 11:52.720
the individual and of course this view of property and money in the economy fails to take into

11:52.720 --> 11:57.600
account natural human greed which believe it or not you can't be re-educated out of which is why

11:57.600 --> 12:02.720
it always takes a tremendous amount of force directly from the government in order to impose

12:02.720 --> 12:07.280
this sort of thing on the people that is the main reason why socialism will never actually

12:07.280 --> 12:12.560
wither away and become communism because no bureaucracy ever voluntarily shrinks itself

12:12.560 --> 12:16.880
meanwhile fascists view property as a necessary evil they recognize that people will work harder

12:16.880 --> 12:21.760
if they work for themselves but ultimately all property is state-owned again including the

12:21.760 --> 12:26.880
individual and speaking of the individual the liberal views the purpose of the state itself

12:26.880 --> 12:32.000
to be the citizens of it the people create the state for their purposes laws are written at the

12:32.000 --> 12:36.960
whim of the people the liberal state is almost like a patchwork piece where free people will

12:36.960 --> 12:42.480
debate vote and ultimately change up the making of the state as circumstance demands socialism

12:42.480 --> 12:47.600
views the citizen as inconsequential they hope for a global worldwide communist revolution and

12:47.600 --> 12:53.040
everyone will simply be communal fascism meanwhile views people as being owned directly by the state

12:53.040 --> 12:57.920
the state controls and guides them as an eternal father and while the liberals believe that the

12:57.920 --> 13:02.880
people create the state the fascists believe that the state creates the people so while these three

13:02.880 --> 13:08.320
forces exist in opposition to each other they also sometimes agree as you can see the liberals and

13:08.320 --> 13:13.280
fascists both agree that the state should exist meanwhile the communists do not therefore the

13:13.280 --> 13:19.040
communists often see the liberals as fascists or at least as fascist helpers or vulnerable to

13:19.040 --> 13:24.320
fascism liberals and communists both hate the elitism of the fascist the purpose of the fascist

13:24.320 --> 13:29.840
state is to create and enforce a strict hierarchy of power while the communist wishes to do away

13:29.840 --> 13:34.400
with hierarchy altogether and the liberal prefers a hierarchy of competence communists and fascists

13:34.400 --> 13:39.360
both agree with mass slavery fascism enslaves people directly in the name of the state

13:39.360 --> 13:42.640
communism does it indirectly by the collectivization of the means of production

13:42.640 --> 13:47.600
and the mass re-education of people to think the same way which in practice also results in slavery

13:47.600 --> 13:53.200
the liberal opposes both communism and fascism as revolutionary ideologies destructive to the

13:53.200 --> 13:58.000
freedom of the individual so with this in place you can kind of see why someone from a liberal

13:58.000 --> 14:02.400
point of view will look at a communist and a fascist and say those are both totalitarian

14:02.400 --> 14:05.920
they're anti-freedom i don't want that the communist meanwhile looks at a liberal

14:05.920 --> 14:12.080
and screams fascist nazi collaborator bootlicker etc etc meanwhile the fascist views both of them

14:12.080 --> 14:17.040
as disorderly as rejecting the natural state of the world some of my fans have linked to me

14:17.680 --> 14:22.320
i i'd say about five different breadtubers at this point voshes is only one of them

14:22.320 --> 14:25.760
but five different breadtubers who have done videos on me people who have done you know

14:25.760 --> 14:30.960
reply girl videos to some of the things that i've done um i haven't really watched much of them to

14:30.960 --> 14:35.040
be honest you know the drama scene is not exactly my cup of tea anymore you know but even though i

14:35.040 --> 14:39.120
don't watch those videos fans of those communities definitely come into my videos and start leaving

14:39.120 --> 14:42.800
comments and starting debates that's fine of course that's their freedom of speech but in

14:42.800 --> 14:49.280
talking with them i've kind of discovered a few things um i've discovered why these people think

14:49.280 --> 14:54.720
the way that they do about progress you know we we had the whole reactionary video we had we had

14:54.720 --> 14:59.360
the talk on progressivism what progress is and that's because in general the communist worships

14:59.360 --> 15:03.760
progress they are an entirely materialistic philosophy there's no there's no spiritual

15:03.760 --> 15:07.440
aspect to them at all they're all about progress but they're all about a very narrow definition of

15:07.440 --> 15:12.160
what progress is and it's also why i think most people who are who are progressives or who are

15:12.160 --> 15:15.680
on the progressive left or whatever i think that's why most of them end up being communists or

15:15.680 --> 15:21.520
socialists in the end but the fascist rejects the idea of progress entirely in favor of tradition

15:21.520 --> 15:26.720
they say no that's something new that's progress we're not going that way we are sticking to the

15:26.720 --> 15:31.200
old ways that is the way of the fascist meanwhile the liberal is different from both of these things

15:31.200 --> 15:35.680
the liberal doesn't reject progress as a concept the way that the fascist does but the liberal

15:35.680 --> 15:40.960
does not agree with the narrow-minded definition of what progress is that the communist believes

15:40.960 --> 15:46.880
in the communist you know skimmed over the little red book and said oh this is the road map of

15:46.880 --> 15:50.960
progress we follow these steps like their commandments and will reach the promised land

15:50.960 --> 15:56.000
the communist utopia the communists lacking a spiritual aspect of their philosophy and being

15:56.000 --> 16:01.280
entirely materialistic worship progressivism as if it is a religion in a sense they believe that

16:01.280 --> 16:07.440
there is only one path for humanity to take for things to progress and that everyone who doesn't

16:07.440 --> 16:12.320
follow that path is a reactionary a counter-revolutionary something like that i talked

16:12.320 --> 16:15.600
about this a little bit at the start of the video but but here's kind of the main point the liberal's

16:15.600 --> 16:19.920
view of progress is much broader than the socialist's view of progress for the liberal

16:19.920 --> 16:25.840
progress is a spectrum you could say for the liberal what progress is isn't predetermined or

16:25.840 --> 16:31.440
predefined written by a prophet in an ancient text or by a philosopher in a manifesto progress is the

16:31.440 --> 16:36.560
future it's the unknown we don't know what progress is how can you know the thing that you haven't

16:36.560 --> 16:42.800
thought up yet so for the liberal progress is experimentation progress is trying new things

16:42.800 --> 16:49.040
progress is a thousand different paths that may or may not lead somewhere it is not inherited knowledge

16:49.040 --> 16:54.080
brought down it is not inherited knowledge brought down by god himself meanwhile the

16:54.080 --> 16:58.720
socialist believes that they have the perfect knowledge of what progressivism is they believe

16:58.720 --> 17:04.240
that they have the perfect politics they know the one true way just like every other religious zealot

17:04.240 --> 17:08.320
and therefore every person who disagrees with them regardless of whether they're disagreeing with them

17:08.320 --> 17:13.280
on the utility of progress itself or the direction that progress should take they're labeled as a

17:13.280 --> 17:18.720
heretic or you know a reactionary and since the ideological war right now is between the

17:18.720 --> 17:23.920
liberals and the socialists and this war is fought not over whether or not we should progress

17:23.920 --> 17:29.360
but what form that progress should take it is no surprise to me that breadtubers for example

17:29.360 --> 17:35.120
view liberals as reactionaries just like the communists view liberals as fascists if they

17:35.120 --> 17:40.320
categorically understand the one true path of progress then everyone else's opinion

17:40.320 --> 17:44.480
must simply be going backwards but we know that's not the truth of the matter

17:44.480 --> 17:49.840
all right i'm done guys make sure to speak freely i'll talk to you next time i love you
