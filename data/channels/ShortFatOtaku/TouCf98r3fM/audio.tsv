0	5000	So I noticed that quite a few people took, uh, took objection to my video yesterday.
5000	8000	And I mean, that's fine. We don't always have to agree on everything, right?
8000	13000	The point of yesterday's video was that it doesn't really matter how many people are out there being idiots.
13000	16000	Yeah, it's bad, and yeah, they shouldn't do it.
16000	20000	And yeah, if what they're doing is illegal or even immoral, they should be held accountable for that.
20000	24000	But that, to me, the greater problem is government overreach.
24000	27000	The greater problem is the unwarranted restriction of freedoms.
27000	30000	But I do understand the opposing point of view, you know?
30000	34000	This idea that this virus is going to kill a whole bunch of the boomers,
34000	39000	and therefore anybody who loves their parents or loves their grandparents is going to want to stay inside.
39000	41000	Well, yeah, but that's voluntary, isn't it?
41000	44000	I mean, if you live with grandma and you have to go outside for some reason,
44000	48000	well, that should actually be a pretty good motivator for you to be responsible while you're out there.
48000	51000	I'm not saying don't wear masks. I'm not saying don't wear gloves.
51000	54000	I'm not saying don't practice social distancing.
54000	59000	I'm not saying don't do all of those things that responsible individuals should do.
59000	63000	What I'm saying is that it's not up to the government to do that for you.
63000	69000	And in fact, you can make a blanket statement that quarantine itself can actually be seen as unethical,
69000	71000	at least from some points of view.
71000	75000	Consider Typhoid Mary. Was it ethical for the government to quarantine her?
75000	82000	Typhoid Mary was somebody who could spread typhoid fever around, but didn't actually have the symptoms of it herself.
82000	84000	She was an asymptomatic carrier.
84000	89000	And in fact, she was a carrier of this disease from the time that she got it up until the end of her life.
89000	94000	She worked as a cook. And for a while, at least, she didn't know she was capable of spreading the disease.
94000	97000	The government put her in quarantine for three years.
97000	100000	And after those three years were up, she was ordered not to work as a cook again.
100000	105000	But it turns out that she just didn't believe the diagnosis, went back to work as a cook,
105000	110000	caused another pandemic of typhoid fever, and then was put into quarantine for the rest of her life.
110000	113000	You have to ask yourself, did she do anything wrong?
113000	116000	I don't mean, did she cause suffering? She obviously did.
116000	118000	But did she consciously do anything wrong?
118000	121000	Before the first quarantine, the answer was obviously no. She didn't know.
121000	123000	She didn't know what she was spreading. She didn't know what was going on.
123000	128000	And to be honest, to a working class woman, completely uneducated, living at the turn of the century,
128000	134000	this idea that you could spread disease to everyone around you while not actually suffering from the disease yourself,
134000	137000	that would seem quite unbelievable to someone like her.
137000	142000	I can actually understand why, at least in that situation, she wouldn't believe that diagnosis.
142000	146000	We would obviously believe it today because we're all more educated, but she didn't have that privilege.
146000	151000	But in a more general sense, in terms of natural rights, did she do anything wrong?
151000	157000	Sure, she was ignorant, but she didn't go around purposefully spreading typhoid fever.
157000	160000	I mean, maybe she did deep in her heart, like, who knows, right?
160000	163000	But as far as we can tell, she just didn't understand what was going on.
163000	168000	And if there's no intent, and if the person reasonably believes that they're not the problem,
168000	172000	and that person simply exists in public, is there any guilt?
172000	174000	Or maybe we can formulate it like this.
174000	180000	If there is some quality that a person has that is endemic to them, that is, it's simply part of them,
180000	187000	and they can't remove it or change it, and their simply existing in public causes massive problems for other people,
187000	189000	who do you blame for that?
189000	195000	If you blame the individual for that, then you start to go down a whole bunch of terrible roads.
195000	201000	You can definitely have an individual of a minority race, and then have it be their fault that they exist,
201000	205000	because the majority doesn't like them, and they walk down the street or something.
205000	211000	This is obviously not the same situation as someone who asymptomatically carries a virus, I know that.
211000	216000	But if we're going to start blaming people for things that they do not actually do,
216000	222000	and simply happen around them because they exist outside, there is definitely a slippery slope there.
222000	227000	Of course, at the same time, even though I might excuse Typhoid Mary back in her day,
227000	230000	I wouldn't excuse her now, because nowadays we do have education.
230000	235000	And people generally do know about germ theory in a way that they didn't 120 years ago.
235000	240000	You know, when it turned out that Rand Paul had an asymptomatic variant of coronavirus,
240000	243000	he was smart enough and educated enough to self-isolate.
243000	246000	But I also do think that it's important to note that he did it himself.
246000	250000	It was the right thing to do, but the government didn't order him to do it.
250000	255000	There are going to be some people who listen to this video and, for some wild reason,
255000	260000	think that I'm just being pro-spreader or something. That's definitely not the case that I'm making here.
260000	267000	The case that I'm making is that forcibly quarantining someone always infringes on their individual rights.
267000	271000	And yes, that just might be required sometimes.
271000	277000	Like in the case of Typhoid Mary, where people were getting sick and dying all around her constantly no matter where she went.
277000	280000	But the state cannot simply use that power whenever it likes.
280000	283000	It has to be only the most serious of cases.
283000	287000	And frankly, I don't think coronavirus is the most serious of cases.
287000	293000	The Asian flu of 1958 killed an estimated 116,000 Americans,
293000	297000	back when the US only had around 150 million people in it.
297000	299000	But the country didn't shut down.
299000	301000	Civil liberties were not suspended.
301000	306000	2009's swine flu, otherwise colloquially known at the time as H1N1,
306000	311000	killed over half a million people worldwide, infected nearly one and a half billion.
311000	313000	And yet, we didn't close things down.
313000	319000	Not only that, the pandemic was not pinned on Obama, in the same way that the media seems to be trying to pin this one on Trump.
319000	322000	Why they're not pinning it on China, I'll never understand.
322000	326000	Your average flu season infects around one billion people a year.
326000	328000	And again, you might get a half a million deaths a year from it.
328000	334000	We don't strip people of their civil rights and close down the entire world for four months a year.
334000	337000	I'm not saying that coronavirus isn't serious. It is.
337000	341000	I'm not saying that any of the things that we're currently doing aren't helping.
341000	342000	They are.
342000	345000	I'm not even making a purely economic argument, although that's definitely part of it.
345000	348000	I think if we keep ourselves locked up for more than a few more months,
348000	353000	there will be a massive worldwide depression that will kill more people than the virus ever will.
353000	355000	But I'm not even making that argument this time.
355000	362000	What I'm saying is, how many governments have actually ever given up the emergency powers they've seized during a crisis?
362000	366000	Was the Patriot Act repealed after Al Qaeda was routed in Afghanistan?
366000	371000	Did the NSA, with the help of big tech, ever actually stop collecting your data?
371000	374000	Or listening in on your phone conversations or reading your private messages?
374000	379000	I'll definitely have a video coming up about what these authoritarians are doing on the ground.
379000	381000	We can take a look at it in greater detail then.
381000	383000	But the point is, is that it's not worth it.
383000	387000	Like I said in my last video, I could catch this virus and die from it.
387000	389000	And on my deathbed, I would stand by it.
389000	392000	That it is not worth throwing away our civil liberties over this.
392000	394000	There's also a practical argument, too.
394000	398000	For some reason, there's a lot of doomerism going around because of this whole reinfection thing.
398000	399000	People are getting reinfected.
399000	406000	The honest truth is, the reinfection thing is probably just really bad testing methodology from earlier in the outbreak.
406000	409000	People who thought they were sick weren't actually sick, but the tests showed that they were.
409000	411000	And then they ended up catching it later.
411000	415000	I do think that at the very least, getting sick provides you with partial immunity.
415000	419000	Maybe not full inoculation, but definitely partial immunity.
419000	420000	And here's why.
420000	425000	We've seen, generally, a slowdown in the acceleration of cases worldwide.
425000	429000	We're not talking about China's numbers, because China's numbers are very obviously made up at this point.
429000	432000	There's no way that in the past month they only got like 3,000 new cases.
432000	433000	There's no way.
433000	435000	They have millions over there, and they're just not telling us.
435000	441000	But in places where numbers are more likely to be reliable, we've seen this slowdown in acceleration.
441000	445000	And you could say, maybe that's because of all the various treatments that we've discovered.
445000	447000	Or maybe it's because of the social distancing, or everyone staying inside.
447000	448000	Yeah, maybe.
448000	454000	But also you have areas where the country didn't actually lock things down all that strictly.
454000	458000	And we're still seeing a decrease in the acceleration of new cases.
458000	466000	What that says to me is that there's probably some kind of asymptomatic variant going around between people that's going relatively undetected.
466000	468000	No one's really knowing that they have it.
468000	470000	No one's really knowing that they're spreading it.
470000	473000	And that it's conferring at least some partial resistance.
473000	483000	Because then those resistant people can't actually get any more serious cases that would then cause them to have serious symptoms, go to the hospital, get tested, get officially confirmed.
483000	492000	And places that have no lockdown and little to no social distancing are still experiencing a slowdown in the acceleration of cases.
492000	495000	Either the official numbers are just completely made up, which is possible.
495000	500000	Or there is this asymptomatic variant that is slowly inoculating the world's population.
500000	507000	And frankly, if that's the case, if nature really is handling this thing on its own, then social distancing can actually hinder that.
507000	512000	If you have an asymptomatic variant and you're not spreading it to everyone around you, well then they're not getting the benefit of it.
512000	517000	I'm also not saying that we should never have locked things down in the first place, because we obviously should have.
517000	520000	But the lockdown was for a specific reason.
520000	523000	Yeah, they call it flattening the curve, but here's what it actually is.
523000	524000	It was to do a few things.
524000	534000	One, ramp up local production capacity such that they can start making their own masks and ventilators and other things and not have to rely on China to deliver it to them, because they're not delivering them right now.
534000	535000	And we've done that.
535000	539000	Western companies are in fact jumping into the fight and making all the stuff that we need.
539000	543000	It's almost like a World War II era thing where everyone's kind of pulling together to do what needs to be done.
543000	547000	Two, the time was to be used to develop an effective treatment.
547000	550000	It seems like hydroxychloroquine is that effective treatment.
550000	552000	It's not a vaccine or anything, you can't take it before you get it.
552000	555000	And please don't go drinking the aquarium cleaner or whatever it was.
555000	559000	But it does seem to be an effective drug that you can take while you have it.
559000	561000	And vaccines are being developed.
561000	563000	There are some universities here in Canada working on vaccines.
563000	565000	I know France is working on a vaccine.
565000	566000	This stuff will come.
566000	570000	And this time was to be used to get those efforts started, which we've done.
570000	580000	In other words, a worldwide quarantine was needed to basically buy us enough time to research the virus, develop treatments, and manufacture what we need to actually fight it.
580000	583000	And for the most part, we've done that now.
583000	585000	I'm not saying don't stay in.
585000	586000	If you want to stay in, stay in.
586000	590000	I'm not saying don't be more careful than normal when you go out.
590000	592000	If you want to, go ahead.
592000	598000	I'm saying at this point, the state should stop restricting people from leaving their houses.
598000	600000	It is an overreach of government authority.
600000	602000	It is a power grab.
602000	606000	Human rights don't stop being human rights just because there's a pandemic on.
606000	608000	Anyway, that's just my point of view.
608000	613000	Again, I'm not some kind of secret super spreader or something.
613000	615000	I'm not denying that this virus exists.
615000	617000	I'm not denying that it may in fact be serious.
617000	620000	And it will certainly kill people, and no one wants that to happen.
620000	627000	What I'm saying is, at this point, I think the greater threat is the authoritarians and the government who view this as an opportunity to consolidate power.
627000	629000	Anyway, thank you for listening to me ramble a little bit.
629000	636000	I am enjoying the fact that whenever I do a video that is literally just my thoughts and not like analysis of news or with articles or something,
636000	640000	but just me working something out in my head, that you guys still like listening to it.
640000	642000	So thank you very much for all your support.
642000	643000	I'll see you in the next video.
643000	644000	I love you.
