00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
So I noticed that quite a few people took, uh, took objection to my video yesterday.

00:05.000 --> 00:08.000
And I mean, that's fine. We don't always have to agree on everything, right?

00:08.000 --> 00:13.000
The point of yesterday's video was that it doesn't really matter how many people are out there being idiots.

00:13.000 --> 00:16.000
Yeah, it's bad, and yeah, they shouldn't do it.

00:16.000 --> 00:20.000
And yeah, if what they're doing is illegal or even immoral, they should be held accountable for that.

00:20.000 --> 00:24.000
But that, to me, the greater problem is government overreach.

00:24.000 --> 00:27.000
The greater problem is the unwarranted restriction of freedoms.

00:27.000 --> 00:30.000
But I do understand the opposing point of view, you know?

00:30.000 --> 00:34.000
This idea that this virus is going to kill a whole bunch of the boomers,

00:34.000 --> 00:39.000
and therefore anybody who loves their parents or loves their grandparents is going to want to stay inside.

00:39.000 --> 00:41.000
Well, yeah, but that's voluntary, isn't it?

00:41.000 --> 00:44.000
I mean, if you live with grandma and you have to go outside for some reason,

00:44.000 --> 00:48.000
well, that should actually be a pretty good motivator for you to be responsible while you're out there.

00:48.000 --> 00:51.000
I'm not saying don't wear masks. I'm not saying don't wear gloves.

00:51.000 --> 00:54.000
I'm not saying don't practice social distancing.

00:54.000 --> 00:59.000
I'm not saying don't do all of those things that responsible individuals should do.

00:59.000 --> 01:03.000
What I'm saying is that it's not up to the government to do that for you.

01:03.000 --> 01:09.000
And in fact, you can make a blanket statement that quarantine itself can actually be seen as unethical,

01:09.000 --> 01:11.000
at least from some points of view.

01:11.000 --> 01:15.000
Consider Typhoid Mary. Was it ethical for the government to quarantine her?

01:15.000 --> 01:22.000
Typhoid Mary was somebody who could spread typhoid fever around, but didn't actually have the symptoms of it herself.

01:22.000 --> 01:24.000
She was an asymptomatic carrier.

01:24.000 --> 01:29.000
And in fact, she was a carrier of this disease from the time that she got it up until the end of her life.

01:29.000 --> 01:34.000
She worked as a cook. And for a while, at least, she didn't know she was capable of spreading the disease.

01:34.000 --> 01:37.000
The government put her in quarantine for three years.

01:37.000 --> 01:40.000
And after those three years were up, she was ordered not to work as a cook again.

01:40.000 --> 01:45.000
But it turns out that she just didn't believe the diagnosis, went back to work as a cook,

01:45.000 --> 01:50.000
caused another pandemic of typhoid fever, and then was put into quarantine for the rest of her life.

01:50.000 --> 01:53.000
You have to ask yourself, did she do anything wrong?

01:53.000 --> 01:56.000
I don't mean, did she cause suffering? She obviously did.

01:56.000 --> 01:58.000
But did she consciously do anything wrong?

01:58.000 --> 02:01.000
Before the first quarantine, the answer was obviously no. She didn't know.

02:01.000 --> 02:03.000
She didn't know what she was spreading. She didn't know what was going on.

02:03.000 --> 02:08.000
And to be honest, to a working class woman, completely uneducated, living at the turn of the century,

02:08.000 --> 02:14.000
this idea that you could spread disease to everyone around you while not actually suffering from the disease yourself,

02:14.000 --> 02:17.000
that would seem quite unbelievable to someone like her.

02:17.000 --> 02:22.000
I can actually understand why, at least in that situation, she wouldn't believe that diagnosis.

02:22.000 --> 02:26.000
We would obviously believe it today because we're all more educated, but she didn't have that privilege.

02:26.000 --> 02:31.000
But in a more general sense, in terms of natural rights, did she do anything wrong?

02:31.000 --> 02:37.000
Sure, she was ignorant, but she didn't go around purposefully spreading typhoid fever.

02:37.000 --> 02:40.000
I mean, maybe she did deep in her heart, like, who knows, right?

02:40.000 --> 02:43.000
But as far as we can tell, she just didn't understand what was going on.

02:43.000 --> 02:48.000
And if there's no intent, and if the person reasonably believes that they're not the problem,

02:48.000 --> 02:52.000
and that person simply exists in public, is there any guilt?

02:52.000 --> 02:54.000
Or maybe we can formulate it like this.

02:54.000 --> 03:00.000
If there is some quality that a person has that is endemic to them, that is, it's simply part of them,

03:00.000 --> 03:07.000
and they can't remove it or change it, and their simply existing in public causes massive problems for other people,

03:07.000 --> 03:09.000
who do you blame for that?

03:09.000 --> 03:15.000
If you blame the individual for that, then you start to go down a whole bunch of terrible roads.

03:15.000 --> 03:21.000
You can definitely have an individual of a minority race, and then have it be their fault that they exist,

03:21.000 --> 03:25.000
because the majority doesn't like them, and they walk down the street or something.

03:25.000 --> 03:31.000
This is obviously not the same situation as someone who asymptomatically carries a virus, I know that.

03:31.000 --> 03:36.000
But if we're going to start blaming people for things that they do not actually do,

03:36.000 --> 03:42.000
and simply happen around them because they exist outside, there is definitely a slippery slope there.

03:42.000 --> 03:47.000
Of course, at the same time, even though I might excuse Typhoid Mary back in her day,

03:47.000 --> 03:50.000
I wouldn't excuse her now, because nowadays we do have education.

03:50.000 --> 03:55.000
And people generally do know about germ theory in a way that they didn't 120 years ago.

03:55.000 --> 04:00.000
You know, when it turned out that Rand Paul had an asymptomatic variant of coronavirus,

04:00.000 --> 04:03.000
he was smart enough and educated enough to self-isolate.

04:03.000 --> 04:06.000
But I also do think that it's important to note that he did it himself.

04:06.000 --> 04:10.000
It was the right thing to do, but the government didn't order him to do it.

04:10.000 --> 04:15.000
There are going to be some people who listen to this video and, for some wild reason,

04:15.000 --> 04:20.000
think that I'm just being pro-spreader or something. That's definitely not the case that I'm making here.

04:20.000 --> 04:27.000
The case that I'm making is that forcibly quarantining someone always infringes on their individual rights.

04:27.000 --> 04:31.000
And yes, that just might be required sometimes.

04:31.000 --> 04:37.000
Like in the case of Typhoid Mary, where people were getting sick and dying all around her constantly no matter where she went.

04:37.000 --> 04:40.000
But the state cannot simply use that power whenever it likes.

04:40.000 --> 04:43.000
It has to be only the most serious of cases.

04:43.000 --> 04:47.000
And frankly, I don't think coronavirus is the most serious of cases.

04:47.000 --> 04:53.000
The Asian flu of 1958 killed an estimated 116,000 Americans,

04:53.000 --> 04:57.000
back when the US only had around 150 million people in it.

04:57.000 --> 04:59.000
But the country didn't shut down.

04:59.000 --> 05:01.000
Civil liberties were not suspended.

05:01.000 --> 05:06.000
2009's swine flu, otherwise colloquially known at the time as H1N1,

05:06.000 --> 05:11.000
killed over half a million people worldwide, infected nearly one and a half billion.

05:11.000 --> 05:13.000
And yet, we didn't close things down.

05:13.000 --> 05:19.000
Not only that, the pandemic was not pinned on Obama, in the same way that the media seems to be trying to pin this one on Trump.

05:19.000 --> 05:22.000
Why they're not pinning it on China, I'll never understand.

05:22.000 --> 05:26.000
Your average flu season infects around one billion people a year.

05:26.000 --> 05:28.000
And again, you might get a half a million deaths a year from it.

05:28.000 --> 05:34.000
We don't strip people of their civil rights and close down the entire world for four months a year.

05:34.000 --> 05:37.000
I'm not saying that coronavirus isn't serious. It is.

05:37.000 --> 05:41.000
I'm not saying that any of the things that we're currently doing aren't helping.

05:41.000 --> 05:42.000
They are.

05:42.000 --> 05:45.000
I'm not even making a purely economic argument, although that's definitely part of it.

05:45.000 --> 05:48.000
I think if we keep ourselves locked up for more than a few more months,

05:48.000 --> 05:53.000
there will be a massive worldwide depression that will kill more people than the virus ever will.

05:53.000 --> 05:55.000
But I'm not even making that argument this time.

05:55.000 --> 06:02.000
What I'm saying is, how many governments have actually ever given up the emergency powers they've seized during a crisis?

06:02.000 --> 06:06.000
Was the Patriot Act repealed after Al Qaeda was routed in Afghanistan?

06:06.000 --> 06:11.000
Did the NSA, with the help of big tech, ever actually stop collecting your data?

06:11.000 --> 06:14.000
Or listening in on your phone conversations or reading your private messages?

06:14.000 --> 06:19.000
I'll definitely have a video coming up about what these authoritarians are doing on the ground.

06:19.000 --> 06:21.000
We can take a look at it in greater detail then.

06:21.000 --> 06:23.000
But the point is, is that it's not worth it.

06:23.000 --> 06:27.000
Like I said in my last video, I could catch this virus and die from it.

06:27.000 --> 06:29.000
And on my deathbed, I would stand by it.

06:29.000 --> 06:32.000
That it is not worth throwing away our civil liberties over this.

06:32.000 --> 06:34.000
There's also a practical argument, too.

06:34.000 --> 06:38.000
For some reason, there's a lot of doomerism going around because of this whole reinfection thing.

06:38.000 --> 06:39.000
People are getting reinfected.

06:39.000 --> 06:46.000
The honest truth is, the reinfection thing is probably just really bad testing methodology from earlier in the outbreak.

06:46.000 --> 06:49.000
People who thought they were sick weren't actually sick, but the tests showed that they were.

06:49.000 --> 06:51.000
And then they ended up catching it later.

06:51.000 --> 06:55.000
I do think that at the very least, getting sick provides you with partial immunity.

06:55.000 --> 06:59.000
Maybe not full inoculation, but definitely partial immunity.

06:59.000 --> 07:00.000
And here's why.

07:00.000 --> 07:05.000
We've seen, generally, a slowdown in the acceleration of cases worldwide.

07:05.000 --> 07:09.000
We're not talking about China's numbers, because China's numbers are very obviously made up at this point.

07:09.000 --> 07:12.000
There's no way that in the past month they only got like 3,000 new cases.

07:12.000 --> 07:13.000
There's no way.

07:13.000 --> 07:15.000
They have millions over there, and they're just not telling us.

07:15.000 --> 07:21.000
But in places where numbers are more likely to be reliable, we've seen this slowdown in acceleration.

07:21.000 --> 07:25.000
And you could say, maybe that's because of all the various treatments that we've discovered.

07:25.000 --> 07:27.000
Or maybe it's because of the social distancing, or everyone staying inside.

07:27.000 --> 07:28.000
Yeah, maybe.

07:28.000 --> 07:34.000
But also you have areas where the country didn't actually lock things down all that strictly.

07:34.000 --> 07:38.000
And we're still seeing a decrease in the acceleration of new cases.

07:38.000 --> 07:46.000
What that says to me is that there's probably some kind of asymptomatic variant going around between people that's going relatively undetected.

07:46.000 --> 07:48.000
No one's really knowing that they have it.

07:48.000 --> 07:50.000
No one's really knowing that they're spreading it.

07:50.000 --> 07:53.000
And that it's conferring at least some partial resistance.

07:53.000 --> 08:03.000
Because then those resistant people can't actually get any more serious cases that would then cause them to have serious symptoms, go to the hospital, get tested, get officially confirmed.

08:03.000 --> 08:12.000
And places that have no lockdown and little to no social distancing are still experiencing a slowdown in the acceleration of cases.

08:12.000 --> 08:15.000
Either the official numbers are just completely made up, which is possible.

08:15.000 --> 08:20.000
Or there is this asymptomatic variant that is slowly inoculating the world's population.

08:20.000 --> 08:27.000
And frankly, if that's the case, if nature really is handling this thing on its own, then social distancing can actually hinder that.

08:27.000 --> 08:32.000
If you have an asymptomatic variant and you're not spreading it to everyone around you, well then they're not getting the benefit of it.

08:32.000 --> 08:37.000
I'm also not saying that we should never have locked things down in the first place, because we obviously should have.

08:37.000 --> 08:40.000
But the lockdown was for a specific reason.

08:40.000 --> 08:43.000
Yeah, they call it flattening the curve, but here's what it actually is.

08:43.000 --> 08:44.000
It was to do a few things.

08:44.000 --> 08:54.000
One, ramp up local production capacity such that they can start making their own masks and ventilators and other things and not have to rely on China to deliver it to them, because they're not delivering them right now.

08:54.000 --> 08:55.000
And we've done that.

08:55.000 --> 08:59.000
Western companies are in fact jumping into the fight and making all the stuff that we need.

08:59.000 --> 09:03.000
It's almost like a World War II era thing where everyone's kind of pulling together to do what needs to be done.

09:03.000 --> 09:07.000
Two, the time was to be used to develop an effective treatment.

09:07.000 --> 09:10.000
It seems like hydroxychloroquine is that effective treatment.

09:10.000 --> 09:12.000
It's not a vaccine or anything, you can't take it before you get it.

09:12.000 --> 09:15.000
And please don't go drinking the aquarium cleaner or whatever it was.

09:15.000 --> 09:19.000
But it does seem to be an effective drug that you can take while you have it.

09:19.000 --> 09:21.000
And vaccines are being developed.

09:21.000 --> 09:23.000
There are some universities here in Canada working on vaccines.

09:23.000 --> 09:25.000
I know France is working on a vaccine.

09:25.000 --> 09:26.000
This stuff will come.

09:26.000 --> 09:30.000
And this time was to be used to get those efforts started, which we've done.

09:30.000 --> 09:40.000
In other words, a worldwide quarantine was needed to basically buy us enough time to research the virus, develop treatments, and manufacture what we need to actually fight it.

09:40.000 --> 09:43.000
And for the most part, we've done that now.

09:43.000 --> 09:45.000
I'm not saying don't stay in.

09:45.000 --> 09:46.000
If you want to stay in, stay in.

09:46.000 --> 09:50.000
I'm not saying don't be more careful than normal when you go out.

09:50.000 --> 09:52.000
If you want to, go ahead.

09:52.000 --> 09:58.000
I'm saying at this point, the state should stop restricting people from leaving their houses.

09:58.000 --> 10:00.000
It is an overreach of government authority.

10:00.000 --> 10:02.000
It is a power grab.

10:02.000 --> 10:06.000
Human rights don't stop being human rights just because there's a pandemic on.

10:06.000 --> 10:08.000
Anyway, that's just my point of view.

10:08.000 --> 10:13.000
Again, I'm not some kind of secret super spreader or something.

10:13.000 --> 10:15.000
I'm not denying that this virus exists.

10:15.000 --> 10:17.000
I'm not denying that it may in fact be serious.

10:17.000 --> 10:20.000
And it will certainly kill people, and no one wants that to happen.

10:20.000 --> 10:27.000
What I'm saying is, at this point, I think the greater threat is the authoritarians and the government who view this as an opportunity to consolidate power.

10:27.000 --> 10:29.000
Anyway, thank you for listening to me ramble a little bit.

10:29.000 --> 10:36.000
I am enjoying the fact that whenever I do a video that is literally just my thoughts and not like analysis of news or with articles or something,

10:36.000 --> 10:40.000
but just me working something out in my head, that you guys still like listening to it.

10:40.000 --> 10:42.000
So thank you very much for all your support.

10:42.000 --> 10:43.000
I'll see you in the next video.

10:43.000 --> 10:44.000
I love you.
