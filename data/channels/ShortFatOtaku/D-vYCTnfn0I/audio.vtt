00:00.000 --> 00:10.440
To anyone who's made Let's Plays or commentary or any other kind of YouTube video, you've

00:10.440 --> 00:15.180
probably seen Audacity before. It's a lightweight, feature-filled, easy-to-use audio recording

00:15.180 --> 00:19.740
program. Pretty much everybody uses it. Even a lot of the big players in the YouTube scene

00:19.740 --> 00:25.020
use it. Because it's just as good, and sometimes even better, than professional options like

00:25.020 --> 00:29.200
Adobe Audition. And the recent controversy surrounding it is that it's now a possible

00:29.200 --> 00:34.300
spyware. The famous open-source audio manipulation program was acquired by a company named Muse

00:34.300 --> 00:38.540
Group two months ago. The same company owns other projects in its portfolio, such as Ultimate

00:38.540 --> 00:42.620
Guitar and MuseScore. Ever since then, Audacity has been a heated topic. The parent company

00:42.620 --> 00:46.660
is a multinational company, and it has been trying to start a data collection mechanism

00:46.660 --> 00:51.220
in the software. While Audacity is nothing more than a desktop program, its developers

00:51.220 --> 00:55.200
want to make it phone home with various data taken from users' machines.

00:55.200 --> 00:59.340
And here's a look at their new terms of service. What personal data does Audacity

00:59.340 --> 01:03.780
collect and why? They'll collect your operating system version, your country based on your

01:03.780 --> 01:09.780
IP, details about your computer, non-fatal error codes and messages, and crash reports.

01:09.780 --> 01:14.660
The IP is a bit sketchy, but this is pretty normal for most programs. However, they also

01:14.660 --> 01:19.900
collect for legal enforcement, data necessary for law enforcement, litigation and authorities

01:19.900 --> 01:25.540
requests, if any. What does that mean? Well, nobody knows. They're not telling us. But

01:25.540 --> 01:29.880
it is entirely possible that they could be just collecting copies of anything that you

01:29.880 --> 01:35.160
record with the program. Who does Audacity share your personal data with? Our staff members,

01:35.160 --> 01:41.300
any competent law enforcement body, regulatory, government agency, court or other third party,

01:41.300 --> 01:46.800
our auditors, advisors, legal representatives and similar agents, and to a potential buyer.

01:46.800 --> 01:51.140
At the same time, they also added this clause. The app we provide is not intended for individuals

01:51.140 --> 01:55.700
below the age of 13. If you are under 13 years old, please do not use the app. In many parts

01:55.700 --> 01:59.960
of the internet using world, there's pretty strict laws regarding data collection from

01:59.960 --> 02:05.700
people who are under the age of 13. So it really sounds like Audacity plans to collect

02:05.700 --> 02:10.220
all of your data, like every other app out there, and sell it in order to make some kind

02:10.220 --> 02:16.540
of a profit. In essence, Audacity has become spyware. Audacity uses the GPL3 license. It's

02:16.540 --> 02:21.120
a license for open source software, mainly because people who make free software don't

02:21.120 --> 02:27.080
want it being stolen by big corpos. How it works is GPL code is considered to be free

02:27.080 --> 02:31.240
and open source, meaning anyone can use it and no one can charge money for it. And how

02:31.240 --> 02:36.360
the license works is that if you use any GPL code from somebody else's project, then all

02:36.360 --> 02:42.680
of the code in your project also has to be GPL. GPL software legally has to be free and

02:42.680 --> 02:47.180
not have any restrictions on who can use it. Audacity's new owners are trying to circumvent

02:47.180 --> 02:53.140
this by having their coders sign new agreements to change Audacity's license over to a different

02:53.140 --> 02:57.340
one, which would allow it to be sold as regular software. But to do so, they have to rewrite

02:57.340 --> 03:04.120
code that was made by GPL contributors, especially those who are refusing to sign. And yes, this

03:04.120 --> 03:08.000
is a violation of the GPL license because derivative works are also legally covered

03:08.000 --> 03:13.740
by GPL, meaning that if you look at, say, a GPL program and say, you know what, I don't

03:13.740 --> 03:18.180
want to deal with this license bullshit. I'll just remake it looking at this. Well, that's

03:18.180 --> 03:21.780
still covered by the license because if you're just rewriting the code to do the exact same

03:21.780 --> 03:26.700
thing for the explicit purpose of replacing existing code, you are absolutely in for a

03:26.700 --> 03:31.660
legal battle. And if Audacity's new owners successfully managed to actually do this,

03:31.660 --> 03:35.900
there will likely be a new license because the current license is GPL3. They're likely

03:35.900 --> 03:40.640
going to make GPL4, which closes all of these loopholes. In other words, people are fucking

03:40.640 --> 03:45.080
pissed and I don't blame them, man. This is a reliable piece of software that's been used

03:45.080 --> 03:48.960
for over a decade. And now that it's in the hands of new owners, they're suddenly harvesting

03:48.960 --> 03:55.520
everybody's data. This affects Audacity 3.0.0 or later. So if you still want to use the

03:55.520 --> 03:59.720
program, get a previous version. Additionally, get it from a site that's not the Audacity

03:59.720 --> 04:04.240
official site, just in case. But as always, there's a wider story here. And the story

04:04.240 --> 04:08.600
is that of privacy. Every website seems to be going in the shitter nowadays, and they're

04:08.600 --> 04:14.200
all requiring like a phone number or a picture of your photo ID or something. They want you

04:14.200 --> 04:17.860
to basically plant a beacon at your house and let everybody know where you are. And

04:17.860 --> 04:22.820
it's rather ridiculous, isn't it? At least to my sensibilities, it is. I'm old enough

04:22.820 --> 04:27.420
that I come from an era of the internet where like your parents and PSAs and stuff on TV

04:27.420 --> 04:32.220
would say, hey, don't give out your private information online. That's dangerous. Who

04:32.220 --> 04:37.120
knows who might be out there? And you know what? That's still true. And everybody's forgotten

04:37.120 --> 04:42.200
it. At one point being anonymous used to be prudent until Facebook made being publicly

04:42.200 --> 04:47.720
identifiable trendy. It's not just Twitter and Facebook. It's even more niche things

04:47.720 --> 04:53.600
like GitHub, or those Snapchat and Instagram personality quizzes. The most recent push

04:53.600 --> 04:58.540
against anonymity is happening due to the the soccer situation over in Europe right

04:58.540 --> 05:03.460
now. I will have a video with Lilith and I talking about that situation more in depth,

05:03.460 --> 05:06.960
but we can do a surface level right now for this conversation. Piers Morgan went viral

05:06.960 --> 05:11.760
a couple days ago for this stunningly stupid take. Racist abuse targeted at England football

05:11.760 --> 05:18.240
stars exposes social media's biggest failing. It's time tech firms ban all anonymous accounts

05:18.240 --> 05:24.800
and insist on ID so we can see how brave these bigoted scumbags feel when they're made accountable.

05:24.800 --> 05:30.340
In the name of progressive values, get rid of anonymity. Of course it's not just soccer

05:30.340 --> 05:34.860
players, it's actors and comedians and verified people of all stripes. None of them like the

05:34.860 --> 05:39.100
fact that they can actually be talked back to. That a commoner actually has a method

05:39.100 --> 05:44.520
by which they can point at them and say, no, you're ridiculous. Fuck off. They simply want

05:44.520 --> 05:50.460
to be able to rule unchallenged. Here's old man Devo story number 9000 on this channel.

05:50.460 --> 05:55.020
Two in one video in fact. But when I was younger and the left was the dissident voice

05:55.020 --> 06:00.080
and not the main culture, anonymity was highly valued among progressives because they feared

06:00.080 --> 06:04.020
retaliation from the religious conservative monoculture. But now that these people are

06:04.020 --> 06:08.200
in charge, now that they're the ones wielding power, the protection of being anonymous has

06:08.200 --> 06:12.620
to go. And yeah, they all feel this way. Boris and parliament should stop online racism in

06:12.620 --> 06:16.440
its tracks by passing legislation forcing Twitter and Facebook in the UK to have only

06:16.440 --> 06:20.720
named accounts, checking people's details and banning anonymous ones. It happens in

06:20.720 --> 06:25.920
bedding, so why not social media? Come on Zuckerberg, literally in online papers, please.

06:25.920 --> 06:29.480
Social media companies need to step up and take accountability and action to ban abusers

06:29.480 --> 06:33.460
from their platforms. Gather evidence that can lead to prosecution and support making

06:33.460 --> 06:38.480
their platforms free from this type of abuse. Stop anonymity and require ID. Everyone's

06:38.480 --> 06:42.100
saying this has a checkmark beside their names, obviously. None of them are anonymous, so

06:42.100 --> 06:47.740
they want none of us to be anonymous too. As a social media professional, you look like

06:47.740 --> 06:52.020
one, dude. I want everybody to understand this and the real issue. I've had to ban

06:52.020 --> 06:56.120
so many people on Facebook for the terrible things they've said. Anonymity definitely

06:56.120 --> 07:01.040
makes abuse easier because social media sites do a bad job of policing their spaces. These

07:01.040 --> 07:05.900
people never stopped being children. They simply substituted their parents for a larger

07:05.900 --> 07:10.860
authority whether that be corporations or the state. Make verified ID a requirement

07:10.860 --> 07:17.180
for opening a social media account. Nearly 400,000 fucking idiots signed this petition.

07:17.180 --> 07:23.540
It's ridiculous that I now have almost 12,000 accounts blocked. Nearly all of them are anonymous.

07:23.540 --> 07:27.380
Requiring official ID would wipe out most trolling overnight. You have them blocked,

07:27.380 --> 07:30.660
man. What's the problem? Like you've already solved the problem. Not all anonymous accounts

07:30.660 --> 07:33.540
are used for bile or trolling. Some people have them to protect their identity or their

07:33.540 --> 07:38.620
lives from others. And of course, the verified replies with, sorry, trolling is the top priority,

07:38.620 --> 07:42.660
I'm afraid. It's literally killing people. If you're worried about being identified,

07:42.660 --> 07:47.820
don't go on Twitter or Facebook. Trolling is literally killing people, guys. Some people

07:47.820 --> 07:52.240
have never been punched in the face and it shows. Trolling is an issue. You need to get a grip like

07:52.240 --> 07:55.460
you sound like a naive child who knows nothing. You're trash and your YouTube channel is trash.

07:55.460 --> 08:00.500
You have been reported repair for a ban. These have to be the softest people that our species

08:00.500 --> 08:05.980
has ever created. Like this is shit that kids would say back in the day. Now you have like

08:05.980 --> 08:10.900
35 year olds saying this shit. The truth is though, a lot of these progressives want to

08:10.900 --> 08:14.740
ban anonymity. Not because they're getting trolled. Well, maybe it's kind of because

08:14.740 --> 08:17.620
they're getting trolled. They don't have a spine, but more importantly, because every day,

08:17.620 --> 08:22.020
their propaganda attempts are effortlessly destroyed and replaced by much more coherent

08:22.020 --> 08:27.260
analysis by idiots on Twitter named fart butt with daily dose, Vegeta Piccolo avatars,

08:27.260 --> 08:32.540
who also post a big titty anime porn on their accounts. And the verifieds are so fucking angry

08:32.700 --> 08:36.860
about it that every time they're showed to be the idiots that they are, they want that guy's

08:36.860 --> 08:42.540
bank account information, his address and his place of employment so that they can use all

08:42.540 --> 08:47.100
of their clout to ruin him for daring to talk back. This is old hat, by the way, I'm going to

08:47.100 --> 08:51.180
CNN docs, the guy for making fun of them. That was like four years ago. I did a video on it back

08:51.180 --> 08:56.020
in the day. The absolute worst site for abuse right now is Facebook, not even Twitter, Facebook,

08:56.020 --> 09:01.860
and Facebook actually has a real name policy. So on some level, this isn't about being anonymous.

09:02.220 --> 09:06.380
It's about stopping dissent. And of course, we all know this, right? It doesn't matter that

09:06.380 --> 09:11.260
losing the right to be anonymous will hurt investigative journalists or whistleblowers

09:11.260 --> 09:16.060
or free expression and privacy rights people or people who are gay or trans and still in the

09:16.060 --> 09:20.300
closet or ex Muslims hiding from an oppressive family or people who are running away from

09:20.300 --> 09:25.340
oppressive regimes of all types. These people will continue to screech that being anonymous

09:25.340 --> 09:30.380
is inherently harassment and white supremacy and also their nonsense because they are simply

09:30.380 --> 09:34.700
puppets for tyrants. And of course, we know the next step, right? As soon as you can easily

09:34.700 --> 09:39.580
identify somebody for even the slightest of grievances, well, why not strip everything

09:39.580 --> 09:44.220
from them? They're already guilty. And I've got a plan. The time has come to not only find these

09:44.220 --> 09:48.780
people, not only to prosecute them for their lawless behavior, but also basically to ex

09:48.780 --> 09:53.500
communicate them from our society. So forget about locking them up, forget about throwing away the

09:53.500 --> 09:57.820
key. Forget about banning them from football stadiums, right? I've got a better idea. Instead,

09:57.820 --> 10:03.020
let's make it impossible for them to actually have a life. No bank account, no ability to travel,

10:03.020 --> 10:07.820
no passport, no benefits, nothing. Forget kicking out. Let's kick them out. We don't need them.

10:07.820 --> 10:13.740
Britain doesn't need them. Adios amigos. And you don't like it because I've said that in Spanish,

10:13.740 --> 10:17.820
no bank account, no ability to travel, no passport, no benefits, nothing. Of course,

10:17.820 --> 10:22.940
these people never call for this regarding say pedophiles or rapists, maybe because they'd hit

10:22.940 --> 10:26.700
too many of their own. This ties into cancel culture. And like I said before, it's already

10:26.700 --> 10:31.420
been happening for years. This happened a little while ago, academic agent, a far right YouTuber,

10:31.420 --> 10:37.180
allegedly a former Surrey lecturer was let go by his university. Now, I don't agree with AA's

10:37.180 --> 10:42.860
politics that much, but should he be fired for them? No, of course, his GoFundMe meant to support

10:42.860 --> 10:48.140
him and his family during that time was taken down. Because for people who have been canceled,

10:48.140 --> 10:52.460
people who have had their anonymity stripped away from them, there is no more private life,

10:52.460 --> 10:58.220
which is again, why this stuff isn't liberal shit, but leftist shit. It's not liberals who

10:58.220 --> 11:02.540
say everything's political. We believe that it's important to have a non political space,

11:02.540 --> 11:07.500
a private life. That being said, there are absolutely instances where leftists have been

11:07.500 --> 11:12.940
very pro anonymous. Last year, somebody on GitHub programmed a face depixelizer. It does what it

11:12.940 --> 11:17.740
says. It'll take a pixelized face and reveal it using algorithms. And here are some of the

11:17.740 --> 11:22.620
leftist objections to it. Following the killing of George Floyd by police on May 25,

11:22.620 --> 11:27.820
people of color across the US have been risking their lives in protests against police brutality

11:27.820 --> 11:33.180
and a deeply racist system. Police have been known to threaten, assault and even kill protesters,

11:33.180 --> 11:37.980
identifying them using information gathered from social media, as well as facial recognition

11:37.980 --> 11:42.140
algorithms. The highly questionable ethics of releasing a tool that could be used to

11:42.140 --> 11:47.260
subvert anonymization under any circumstance aside, releasing this right now is not only

11:47.260 --> 11:52.860
incredibly dangerous, but can and will get people killed. Any use of this technology is an aid to

11:52.860 --> 11:57.660
the illegitimate American police state and police states all over the world. What you're doing is

11:57.660 --> 12:01.900
unethical and will lead to more and more deaths from the savage police system of the United

12:01.900 --> 12:06.060
States. Of course, the problem is you can't really close a Pandora's box. Somebody will invent this

12:06.060 --> 12:10.300
eventually, though I do think it's hilarious that they're calling it narc code. During the

12:10.300 --> 12:16.540
Brianna Taylor protests, the protesters not only removed all white people, but also removed the

12:16.540 --> 12:19.660
press. They, too, didn't want to be filmed.

12:46.540 --> 12:55.820
A protest in DC saw protesters wearing masks, yes, because of COVID, but this wasn't allowed before,

12:55.820 --> 13:00.700
and shining lights into the cameras of media to prevent them from documenting who was actually

13:00.700 --> 13:05.180
there. Andy Ngo pointed out this is what Antifa were first doing to me back in 2018. Local

13:05.180 --> 13:09.820
journalists stayed silent or said conservative media didn't deserve support. It emboldened Antifa

13:09.820 --> 13:14.060
eventually to beat me and steal my equipment. Well, this is what happens. It starts with

13:14.060 --> 13:19.100
conservative media, and now it is all media. Also from Andy Ngo, law enforcement in Portland

13:19.100 --> 13:23.900
are expressing concern over Antifa's announced BLM direct action tonight in downtown. This was

13:23.900 --> 13:29.500
back in November of 2020. Video recording was banned, which is a predictor of planned violence.

13:29.500 --> 13:34.940
No streamers, no megaphones, no masters. The left absolutely understands the value of being

13:34.940 --> 13:39.180
anonymous. No one is ever going to get anything done if you're filming them and giving them years

13:39.180 --> 13:43.580
in prison or getting them killed and for what? So you can get money and a stupid action shot?

13:43.580 --> 13:48.700
They absolutely want to go unseen. They want the media to report how stunning and brave they are,

13:48.700 --> 13:53.820
but not actually film them as they commit crimes. To the point that the anarchist library has an

13:53.820 --> 13:59.980
essay called In Defense of Smashing Cameras. This is where the left differs from the liberals in

13:59.980 --> 14:05.100
their defensive anonymity. Our concern is not concerning the so-called right to take pictures

14:05.100 --> 14:10.700
in a public place. We could care less about this boring defense that photographers resort to when

14:10.780 --> 14:16.540
critiqued. Our question is not what are your rights in public? Rather, where do you stand

14:16.540 --> 14:22.540
when it comes to social struggle? How do you act to further the revolt? Simply put, journalists do

14:22.540 --> 14:27.340
not have any political right to a spectacle. They have the ability to participate in a moment of

14:27.340 --> 14:32.860
revolt and they forgo that capacity by consigning the event to a digital memory rather than a future

14:32.860 --> 14:37.660
possibility. While photographic evidence has been useful in the past, we maintain that by

14:37.660 --> 14:42.540
prioritizing documentation in ignorance or indifference to its effect on an action,

14:42.540 --> 14:48.140
journalists are not comrades. This is not a liberal defense of being anonymous. This in fact

14:48.140 --> 14:53.980
strips away people's right to be a bystander. This is George Bush level you're with us or against us

14:53.980 --> 14:59.020
shit. And of course they have 10 rules. One, contrary to what many protest photography tips

14:59.020 --> 15:03.340
tell you, don't get up close. Two, if there are faces in your shot, blur them. A simple

15:03.340 --> 15:07.580
swirl in photoshop won't do. We're talking scrambling such that the police cannot reverse

15:07.580 --> 15:11.420
the process. Three, if there's distinctive or identifying clothing in your shot, blur them.

15:11.420 --> 15:15.740
Four, if certain identities stick out, the few black bodies in a white protest for example,

15:15.740 --> 15:19.900
delete the photo. Five, if you choose to participate as a spectator, keep in mind that

15:19.900 --> 15:23.820
even spectators participate here, then realize that your participation is secondary to those

15:23.820 --> 15:27.820
actively engaged in the moment of revolt. This means that you should step aside even if that

15:27.820 --> 15:32.380
means losing the winning shot. Six, if possible, and it usually is,

15:32.380 --> 15:36.380
ask for consent or indicate that you are taking a photo so that we have an option to turn away

15:36.380 --> 15:41.020
or decline. Yes, we get it. We're in a public place you don't have to ask. But realize that failure to

15:41.020 --> 15:45.500
ask makes us suspicious of your motivations and provides us with added reason to assert

15:45.500 --> 15:50.780
our capacity for opacity. Seven, your camera is a weapon. Friendly fire is unacceptable.

15:50.780 --> 15:55.740
Eight, you are a partisan in a social war. Become involved in the struggles you choose

15:55.740 --> 16:00.300
to document. Should they be documented? If so, how should they be documented to

16:00.300 --> 16:03.980
spread their capacities? Become a comrade and earn the trust of those around you.

16:04.700 --> 16:08.780
Accepting professional activists. For the vast majority of us, this is not a career.

16:08.780 --> 16:15.420
Nine, photograph the police. So again, all of these rules apply only to them and not to their

16:15.420 --> 16:20.380
opponents. And ten, infer more guidelines from the analysis above. The left does not defend being

16:20.380 --> 16:26.380
anonymous. It defends being anonymous for them. It's not just activists. It's not just activists

16:26.380 --> 16:31.420
that progressives want anonymity to protect. This conversation also links very well with the

16:31.420 --> 16:37.740
trans deadnaming thing. There is this push by progressives recently to basically remove every

16:37.740 --> 16:42.300
possible barrier to changing your name and your gender. Even the fact that it might cost a little

16:42.300 --> 16:47.820
bit of money down at the DMV, that's too much. Most notably in the destiny versus the serfs

16:47.820 --> 16:53.100
debate, where Lance thought it was incredibly fucked up that Google required people to have

16:53.100 --> 16:58.220
their dead names on their official ID for security reasons. But if you can change your name at a whim

16:58.220 --> 17:04.060
with no cost, just easily snip all the cords to your past and then go off burden-free. I mean,

17:04.060 --> 17:07.980
it sounds nice, but what does that let you get away with? There have absolutely been instances

17:07.980 --> 17:12.940
of people changing their names to avoid connection to a prior crime. If you make this easier,

17:12.940 --> 17:17.580
even under the guise of trans rights, there will always be people who exploit it.

17:17.580 --> 17:23.420
Mastercard even created something called True Name, which allows transgender and non-binary

17:23.420 --> 17:28.380
people to display their chosen name on their credit card. Regardless of legal status,

17:28.940 --> 17:36.060
this is 100% going to open the way to fraud, and also trolling. Thanks, Twitter.

17:36.060 --> 17:41.180
And we can actually see the progressive hypocrisy on being anonymous, because even as they screech

17:41.260 --> 17:46.700
for protecting anonymity for their activists, they are absolutely overwhelmingly the faction

17:46.700 --> 17:50.380
of cancel culture right now. And yes, I've done videos on cancel culture before, so we're not

17:50.380 --> 17:54.460
going to dig into it too deeply. But it is important to look at some examples specifically

17:54.460 --> 17:59.100
in terms of being anonymous. Let's start here. A Deliveroo writer in Berlin made the mistake

17:59.100 --> 18:02.460
of saying he thought Brexit was good to some remainder British customers. He accused him

18:02.460 --> 18:07.820
of being a Nazi and he lost his job. As of early Sunday morning, four offensive tweets using an

18:07.820 --> 18:11.820
anti-gay slur remained active on Kyler Murray's Twitter account.

18:11.820 --> 18:17.340
I apologize for the tweets that have come to light tonight from when I was 14 and 15.

18:17.340 --> 18:20.380
I used a poor choice of word that doesn't reflect who I am or what I believe.

18:20.380 --> 18:25.020
Is this not fucking ridiculous? Shit posting as a kid and it comes back to haunt you when

18:25.020 --> 18:29.340
you're an adult. I am so happy I did not grow up in the age of social media. Holy shit,

18:29.340 --> 18:32.940
dude. How Kevin Hart tweeted himself out of a job hosting the Oscars.

18:32.940 --> 18:37.900
Step one, be really mean to gay people for no reason. In 2011, he tweeted,

18:37.900 --> 18:40.860
yo, if my son comes home and tries to play with my daughter's dollhouse,

18:40.860 --> 18:46.540
I'm going to break it over his head and say in my voice, stop, that's gay. Yes, humor was edgier

18:46.540 --> 18:51.340
back in the day. Yes, that's not a problem. You know what? It was better. The American Humanist

18:51.340 --> 18:55.420
Association has withdrawn an honor from Richard Dawkins. And I don't know if you're an atheist

18:55.420 --> 18:59.500
and you're critiquing religion. I don't think it's racist to critique Islam. This is a Canadian

18:59.500 --> 19:04.620
sports program. And this went down last year. We apologize to Hal Johnson for the racism he

19:04.620 --> 19:13.980
experienced at TSN beginning in 1988. I mean, I'm sure it sucked, but it's 1988, dude. A 1971

19:13.980 --> 19:19.660
Playboy interview featuring John Wayne's comments on race and sexuality have stirred a fresh debate.

19:19.660 --> 19:25.580
Holy fuck. How long has John Wayne been dead for? Who cares? The past was problematic. Fucking live

19:25.580 --> 19:30.220
with it. If I haven't yet made it clear to you, the point is progressives view anonymity as they

19:30.220 --> 19:35.980
view many other things as a privilege. One set of rules for thee and another for me. And when some

19:35.980 --> 19:40.620
dumb fuck online says, oh, you're an anonymous account, no one's trying to dox you. Just present

19:40.620 --> 19:45.500
yourself, Mr. Anime Avatar. It sounds a whole lot like Goebbels saying, if you have nothing to fear,

19:45.500 --> 19:49.580
you have nothing to hide. A lot of these people, the progressives, the check marks,

19:49.580 --> 19:54.540
even the socialist activists who want this stuff, they're all pawns. None of them have any real

19:54.540 --> 19:59.900
power, but they are being used because the actual powers that be are moving on the anonymous

19:59.900 --> 20:05.900
question. And they're using the left's brain dead defense of removing anonymity to justify doing so.

20:05.900 --> 20:11.340
As of April of this year, anonymous social media accounts in Australia might be gone. They may need

20:11.340 --> 20:17.180
100 points of identification to use social media. A judge has granted the first known warrant for

20:17.180 --> 20:23.180
law enforcement to conduct a dragnet search through the DNA of 1.3 million people in the

20:23.180 --> 20:30.140
GED matched genetic genealogy database. 86% of those users did not explicitly consent to

20:30.140 --> 20:35.740
law enforcement searches. The US wants smartphone location data to fight the coronavirus. The

20:35.740 --> 20:40.380
Pentagon is surveilling Americans without a warrant revealed by a senator back in May.

20:40.380 --> 20:46.780
And as another reminder, this isn't new. Back in 2018, Jess Phillips was calling for the banning

20:46.780 --> 20:51.420
of anonymous social media accounts, and the Guardian was happy to support her on this.

20:51.420 --> 20:56.060
In the present day, Diane Abbott has said that social media companies should collect names and

20:56.060 --> 21:01.900
addresses of all social media users, stating that absolute anonymity on social media has had its

21:01.900 --> 21:08.060
day. Last week, there was a huge controversy, as it was discovered that the NSA was actually spying

21:08.060 --> 21:14.300
on Tucker Carlson. There's definitely been a slow boiling the frog on the anonymity issue.

21:14.300 --> 21:19.420
Back in 2001, when we had the Patriot Act passed, they were saying they were only going to spy on

21:19.420 --> 21:24.220
foreign enemies. By 2013, we had learned that the NSA had spied on Americans, but nobody cared.

21:24.220 --> 21:29.100
By 2014, we had learned that the CIA had spied on the US Senate, but they were really sorry about

21:29.100 --> 21:33.740
it. By 2017, we had learned that the FBI had spied on Donald Trump while he was president,

21:33.740 --> 21:39.180
but I mean, he's Hitler, so who cares, right? By 2021, we had realized the NSA had spied on

21:39.180 --> 21:43.740
US journalists, but it's just Tucker Carlson, so who gives a shit, right? It has been both

21:43.820 --> 21:49.580
governments and corporations getting people used to the idea that it's okay if they're spied on,

21:49.580 --> 21:53.900
that it's okay if they don't have a private life, and it seems that people generally don't object

21:53.900 --> 22:01.260
to this until it's their job that's lost, or their friends that shun them, or their speech that's

22:01.260 --> 22:05.900
been silenced. Even Anonymous themselves, like the activist group Anonymous, has turned into a

22:05.900 --> 22:11.340
fucking joke. As my pal Brick once said before he got banned off Twitter, Anonymous in 2008,

22:11.340 --> 22:15.420
we DDoS the Church of Scientology and track down pedophiles. Anonymous in 2020,

22:15.420 --> 22:20.620
Twitter, please help us, they're ruining my poll. People for like thousands of years at this point,

22:20.620 --> 22:25.580
people have understood the value of being anonymous, of being able to actually say what's

22:25.580 --> 22:31.340
on your mind. Literally speaking truth to power, that is what being anonymous allows for, to have a

22:31.340 --> 22:37.500
place that is private, to have a location where you don't have to be always on, to be able to

22:37.500 --> 22:41.820
regroup and then come back to those things that you find politically important in life,

22:42.380 --> 22:48.860
with a renewed energy, or with renewed arguments, or new ideas. In this video I have done what in my

22:48.860 --> 22:52.940
opinion is a completely justified overlap between the concept of anonymity and the concept of

22:52.940 --> 22:58.140
privacy, because when you take away one you must necessarily take away the other, and that is

22:58.140 --> 23:02.060
absolutely what they're gunning for. They are gunning for not only your ability to be anonymous,

23:03.020 --> 23:09.100
to say things anonymously online, to not get fired over an old take from when you were a child,

23:09.100 --> 23:12.540
or a controversial political opinion that you really shouldn't be fired for,

23:12.540 --> 23:18.540
but what goes with that is also the ability to live privately, to not live in a glass house.

23:18.540 --> 23:24.540
At the same time, as a content creator who has been doxxed, I do kind of understand the objection to

23:24.540 --> 23:29.180
it, right? Let's be honest here, let's give the devil his due. If you're a streamer, especially

23:29.180 --> 23:33.260
if you're a lot bigger than me, I understand larger streamers have this to the nth degree,

23:33.260 --> 23:38.700
but if you're a streamer or you're a video creator, where everything you do is hate-watched

23:38.700 --> 23:43.100
and catalogued, and then put into an archive for like three years, only to be pulled out later by

23:43.100 --> 23:48.380
somebody who absolutely fucking wants to destroy you, and that person is completely anonymous,

23:48.380 --> 23:53.180
does kind of seem unfair, doesn't it? Yes, it's part of the job, but in the moment when it happens

23:53.180 --> 23:57.260
it does feel unfair. But, because it's generally progressives doing this sort of thing,

23:58.220 --> 24:03.820
and they want anonymity for them and not for you, they see no problems with this. They should be

24:03.820 --> 24:08.540
anonymous, and the creators they harass should absolutely not be. There's no principles here,

24:08.540 --> 24:12.460
there's simply power. So I understand it when a content creator says, hey, you're out here

24:12.460 --> 24:15.820
shitting on me and like hate-watching me and cataloging everything that I do,

24:15.820 --> 24:19.340
but you're not going to step to the plate? Like, I understand their position. But at the same time,

24:19.340 --> 24:25.580
this is why progressives scream bloody murder when there is a popular, well-known content creator who

24:25.580 --> 24:29.900
manages to remain anonymous. And there are some of them. Like, I don't think anyone's doxxed It's

24:29.900 --> 24:35.580
a Gundam yet, and people fucking hate him. But forcing everybody to be named is not the answer.

24:36.140 --> 24:40.220
In fact, it seems to me like a better answer is forcing everybody to be anonymous.

24:40.220 --> 24:44.060
That's why I still like places like 4chan, and to a lesser extent Newgrounds,

24:44.060 --> 24:48.860
they still hold that principle. Now, there are some solutions floating around out there.

24:49.420 --> 24:54.300
One of them is the EU's right to be forgotten. The idea behind the right to be forgotten is

24:54.300 --> 24:58.780
that its proponents believe that there should be a right to have private information about

24:58.780 --> 25:02.540
a person removed from the internet. The problem with the right to be forgotten is that it

25:02.540 --> 25:07.740
directly clashes with the right to access of information, the right to education, and yes,

25:07.740 --> 25:11.260
the right to speech and the right to freedom of expression, as well as criticism over the

25:11.260 --> 25:16.300
possibility of using it to rewrite history or maintain censorship. Of course, there are good

25:16.300 --> 25:21.420
reasons to consider such a thing too. Not simply cancel culture or the right to be anonymous,

25:21.420 --> 25:26.460
but also stuff like revenge porn or having absolute falsehoods appear whenever you get

25:26.460 --> 25:30.140
your name searched on Google or something. However, the right to be forgotten, especially

25:30.140 --> 25:35.500
how the EU implements it, seems to be a sledgehammer of a tool when the situation

25:35.500 --> 25:40.300
probably requires something more like a scalpel. Lilith had this idea that doxing should be a

25:40.300 --> 25:44.380
federal crime, it's not free speech to post people's information for malicious purposes.

25:44.380 --> 25:48.460
Dankula replied with, I would argue that private administration information about an individual

25:48.540 --> 25:52.140
is their private property that can only be shared with their permission. Tech companies that use

25:52.140 --> 25:56.220
data as currency would also be seething. That seems to target most of the bad parts of the

25:56.220 --> 26:00.220
equation here without actually infringing on people's right to free speech. I do disagree

26:00.220 --> 26:05.340
with Lilith here though. She says, none of that lol I found your information through extensive digging,

26:05.340 --> 26:09.660
so it's basically public. I get what she's saying, but the problem with this point of view is that

26:09.660 --> 26:13.820
it completely disregards the fact that phone books used to be a thing. Now for those of you zoomers

26:13.820 --> 26:19.260
don't know what a phone book is, back in the day everybody's name, address, and phone number,

26:19.260 --> 26:23.820
in your area anyway, your local area, was listed in a phone book. And so if you wanted to look up

26:23.820 --> 26:27.980
somebody's number and call them, all you had to do was fill out your phone book. Everyone had one,

26:27.980 --> 26:32.060
they were given away by the city once a year for free with updates and every yearly revision,

26:32.060 --> 26:35.980
and the concept of the phone book has since fallen out of style. Nobody knows what they are anymore,

26:35.980 --> 26:41.100
nobody cares about them, but they are new enough that back during gamergate, back in 2014 when

26:41.100 --> 26:45.580
gamergate was happening, and Zoe Quinn was screaming bloody murder about being doxxed by

26:45.580 --> 26:51.340
people, it turns out that her doxxing came from the phone book. Because in 2014 they were on the

26:51.340 --> 26:55.180
way out, but they weren't gone yet. And anyone who lived in her area or her family's area could

26:55.180 --> 27:00.700
simply look her up in the phone book. The argument against doxxing back then was that if you could

27:00.700 --> 27:06.140
find it in a phone book, it wasn't doxxing because that was absolutely publicly available information.

27:06.140 --> 27:09.820
And that seems like a good argument even now. There's a difference though. There's no more

27:09.820 --> 27:15.740
phone books. And not only is there no more phone books, people are way crazier nowadays than they

27:15.740 --> 27:21.100
were in 2014. Cancel culture was minuscule back then compared to now. But still, Dankula seems

27:21.100 --> 27:26.060
to have a good solution here. If we can consider data to be property, and therefore it can only

27:26.060 --> 27:30.940
legally be shared with the person's express permission, then I think that would solve a

27:30.940 --> 27:35.500
lot of the problems. But not all of them. There are absolutely some people out there who just

27:35.500 --> 27:39.180
don't give a shit. They'll say, you know what, I like Facebook too much, I like Instagram too

27:39.180 --> 27:43.660
much, I like TikTok too much, fuck it. You can have all the data, I don't care. Here it is.

27:43.660 --> 27:49.020
I'll gladly sign whatever piece of paper you put in front of me so I can use these fun services.

27:49.020 --> 27:52.620
And then when they go out and get fucking cancelled because all their data's out there,

27:52.620 --> 27:56.780
it'll be too late. That being said, it's a far better solution than the government forcing

27:56.780 --> 28:02.060
all social media to collect everyone's data and remove anonymity in the process. That sounds

28:02.060 --> 28:06.620
absolutely fucking terrible. I wouldn't mind a world where there's like a set of social media

28:06.620 --> 28:12.380
platforms that are old, archaic, and completely data collection heavy, and then a set of newer

28:12.380 --> 28:15.900
social media platforms that are more anonymized. I'm okay with that. But like I said at the

28:15.900 --> 28:20.620
beginning of the video, this is only partially about being anonymous. It is more importantly

28:20.620 --> 28:25.500
about the destruction of the concept of privacy, and what it does to those people who have been

28:25.500 --> 28:29.980
affected by it. I mentioned Academic Agent earlier, but there have been many YouTubers

28:29.980 --> 28:34.860
and content creators who have had their lives destroyed by hate viewers. And those people,

28:35.420 --> 28:40.700
in order to survive because they're now completely unemployable, they have to rely on basically the

28:40.700 --> 28:45.500
charity of their viewers, whether that be through watching ads on YouTube or Twitch or wherever

28:45.500 --> 28:50.540
they happen to be putting their stuff, through donations, through subs on Twitch, through super

28:50.540 --> 28:55.340
chats, through Patreon or Subscribestar donations, whatever it is. As more people express wrong

28:55.340 --> 29:00.540
opinions and are cancelled for it, more and more of them turn towards crowdfunding to stay alive.

29:00.540 --> 29:05.500
And then those people who hold the same opinions, but still manage to have an income,

29:05.500 --> 29:09.740
and let's assume that they actually care about supporting the YouTubers and content creators

29:09.740 --> 29:13.820
that they like, well now they have to support another one, and another one, and another one.

29:13.820 --> 29:20.060
It almost feels like a long war of attrition to slowly destroy those people who are ideologically

29:20.060 --> 29:25.420
opposed to wokeness. If your opposition cannot even provide for themselves and their family,

29:25.420 --> 29:30.620
then one, they're less able to move against you, and two, that is an extra burden on their

29:30.620 --> 29:35.420
community for those people who still can support themselves. This is the reality of the culture

29:35.420 --> 29:40.060
war. It's not going to be a bloody conflict or a riot in the streets. Those do happen,

29:40.060 --> 29:49.100
but those are primarily a distraction. The real war is a slow, steady march to destroy all dissent.

29:49.100 --> 29:54.220
This is the main reason why alt tech has to survive. Because if it doesn't, there will be

29:54.220 --> 29:59.180
no anonymity. It will be a dystopia where you have no privacy and everything you do is watched.

29:59.180 --> 30:05.260
And every single dumbfuck progressive out there will cheer it on until the day it finally comes

30:05.260 --> 30:09.660
for them. You use the wrong pronoun, you tell the wrong joke, you make the wrong hand gesture,

30:09.660 --> 30:13.900
say the wrong word, wear the wrong clothes, order the wrong food, sing the wrong song.

30:13.900 --> 30:18.620
Nobody can keep track of all of their rules, so eventually everyone slips up. And as soon as you

30:18.620 --> 30:22.620
do, you're far right, you're a bigot, you're islamophobic, you're a knuckle dragger, you're

30:22.620 --> 30:27.180
hateful, you're white trash, you're a patriarch. All of your previous virtue signaling counts for

30:27.180 --> 30:33.020
nothing. You can never be forgiven. You will always be that person who did that problematic

30:33.020 --> 30:38.300
thing. You'll be unemployable, unlovable, unwanted. You will be exactly like those people that you

30:38.300 --> 30:43.660
currently torment. This is the brave new world you've created. Welcome to the purity spiral.

30:43.660 --> 30:47.900
It's a long way down. Hey guys, that's the end of the video, so thanks for watching. What I

30:47.900 --> 30:53.340
described here has also unfortunately happened to my roommate. Simply, through his association

30:53.340 --> 30:58.460
with me, he actually lost his job. And until he can get back up on his feet, he's helping me out

30:58.460 --> 31:03.660
with my projects and this channel supporting him too. So, if you're interested in keeping us going,

31:03.660 --> 31:07.740
please consider dropping by our gaming channel. Tomorrow night we're playing the Skyward Sword

31:07.740 --> 31:12.060
HD release. We actually have a pretty big event planned for it, so it'll be I think a pretty

31:12.060 --> 31:16.300
fun stream. Thanks very much for your support, and I'll see you there. I love you.
