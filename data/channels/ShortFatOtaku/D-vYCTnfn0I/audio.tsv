0	10440	To anyone who's made Let's Plays or commentary or any other kind of YouTube video, you've
10440	15180	probably seen Audacity before. It's a lightweight, feature-filled, easy-to-use audio recording
15180	19740	program. Pretty much everybody uses it. Even a lot of the big players in the YouTube scene
19740	25020	use it. Because it's just as good, and sometimes even better, than professional options like
25020	29200	Adobe Audition. And the recent controversy surrounding it is that it's now a possible
29200	34300	spyware. The famous open-source audio manipulation program was acquired by a company named Muse
34300	38540	Group two months ago. The same company owns other projects in its portfolio, such as Ultimate
38540	42620	Guitar and MuseScore. Ever since then, Audacity has been a heated topic. The parent company
42620	46660	is a multinational company, and it has been trying to start a data collection mechanism
46660	51220	in the software. While Audacity is nothing more than a desktop program, its developers
51220	55200	want to make it phone home with various data taken from users' machines.
55200	59340	And here's a look at their new terms of service. What personal data does Audacity
59340	63780	collect and why? They'll collect your operating system version, your country based on your
63780	69780	IP, details about your computer, non-fatal error codes and messages, and crash reports.
69780	74660	The IP is a bit sketchy, but this is pretty normal for most programs. However, they also
74660	79900	collect for legal enforcement, data necessary for law enforcement, litigation and authorities
79900	85540	requests, if any. What does that mean? Well, nobody knows. They're not telling us. But
85540	89880	it is entirely possible that they could be just collecting copies of anything that you
89880	95160	record with the program. Who does Audacity share your personal data with? Our staff members,
95160	101300	any competent law enforcement body, regulatory, government agency, court or other third party,
101300	106800	our auditors, advisors, legal representatives and similar agents, and to a potential buyer.
106800	111140	At the same time, they also added this clause. The app we provide is not intended for individuals
111140	115700	below the age of 13. If you are under 13 years old, please do not use the app. In many parts
115700	119960	of the internet using world, there's pretty strict laws regarding data collection from
119960	125700	people who are under the age of 13. So it really sounds like Audacity plans to collect
125700	130220	all of your data, like every other app out there, and sell it in order to make some kind
130220	136540	of a profit. In essence, Audacity has become spyware. Audacity uses the GPL3 license. It's
136540	141120	a license for open source software, mainly because people who make free software don't
141120	147080	want it being stolen by big corpos. How it works is GPL code is considered to be free
147080	151240	and open source, meaning anyone can use it and no one can charge money for it. And how
151240	156360	the license works is that if you use any GPL code from somebody else's project, then all
156360	162680	of the code in your project also has to be GPL. GPL software legally has to be free and
162680	167180	not have any restrictions on who can use it. Audacity's new owners are trying to circumvent
167180	173140	this by having their coders sign new agreements to change Audacity's license over to a different
173140	177340	one, which would allow it to be sold as regular software. But to do so, they have to rewrite
177340	184120	code that was made by GPL contributors, especially those who are refusing to sign. And yes, this
184120	188000	is a violation of the GPL license because derivative works are also legally covered
188000	193740	by GPL, meaning that if you look at, say, a GPL program and say, you know what, I don't
193740	198180	want to deal with this license bullshit. I'll just remake it looking at this. Well, that's
198180	201780	still covered by the license because if you're just rewriting the code to do the exact same
201780	206700	thing for the explicit purpose of replacing existing code, you are absolutely in for a
206700	211660	legal battle. And if Audacity's new owners successfully managed to actually do this,
211660	215900	there will likely be a new license because the current license is GPL3. They're likely
215900	220640	going to make GPL4, which closes all of these loopholes. In other words, people are fucking
220640	225080	pissed and I don't blame them, man. This is a reliable piece of software that's been used
225080	228960	for over a decade. And now that it's in the hands of new owners, they're suddenly harvesting
228960	235520	everybody's data. This affects Audacity 3.0.0 or later. So if you still want to use the
235520	239720	program, get a previous version. Additionally, get it from a site that's not the Audacity
239720	244240	official site, just in case. But as always, there's a wider story here. And the story
244240	248600	is that of privacy. Every website seems to be going in the shitter nowadays, and they're
248600	254200	all requiring like a phone number or a picture of your photo ID or something. They want you
254200	257860	to basically plant a beacon at your house and let everybody know where you are. And
257860	262820	it's rather ridiculous, isn't it? At least to my sensibilities, it is. I'm old enough
262820	267420	that I come from an era of the internet where like your parents and PSAs and stuff on TV
267420	272220	would say, hey, don't give out your private information online. That's dangerous. Who
272220	277120	knows who might be out there? And you know what? That's still true. And everybody's forgotten
277120	282200	it. At one point being anonymous used to be prudent until Facebook made being publicly
282200	287720	identifiable trendy. It's not just Twitter and Facebook. It's even more niche things
287720	293600	like GitHub, or those Snapchat and Instagram personality quizzes. The most recent push
293600	298540	against anonymity is happening due to the the soccer situation over in Europe right
298540	303460	now. I will have a video with Lilith and I talking about that situation more in depth,
303460	306960	but we can do a surface level right now for this conversation. Piers Morgan went viral
306960	311760	a couple days ago for this stunningly stupid take. Racist abuse targeted at England football
311760	318240	stars exposes social media's biggest failing. It's time tech firms ban all anonymous accounts
318240	324800	and insist on ID so we can see how brave these bigoted scumbags feel when they're made accountable.
324800	330340	In the name of progressive values, get rid of anonymity. Of course it's not just soccer
330340	334860	players, it's actors and comedians and verified people of all stripes. None of them like the
334860	339100	fact that they can actually be talked back to. That a commoner actually has a method
339100	344520	by which they can point at them and say, no, you're ridiculous. Fuck off. They simply want
344520	350460	to be able to rule unchallenged. Here's old man Devo story number 9000 on this channel.
350460	355020	Two in one video in fact. But when I was younger and the left was the dissident voice
355020	360080	and not the main culture, anonymity was highly valued among progressives because they feared
360080	364020	retaliation from the religious conservative monoculture. But now that these people are
364020	368200	in charge, now that they're the ones wielding power, the protection of being anonymous has
368200	372620	to go. And yeah, they all feel this way. Boris and parliament should stop online racism in
372620	376440	its tracks by passing legislation forcing Twitter and Facebook in the UK to have only
376440	380720	named accounts, checking people's details and banning anonymous ones. It happens in
380720	385920	bedding, so why not social media? Come on Zuckerberg, literally in online papers, please.
385920	389480	Social media companies need to step up and take accountability and action to ban abusers
389480	393460	from their platforms. Gather evidence that can lead to prosecution and support making
393460	398480	their platforms free from this type of abuse. Stop anonymity and require ID. Everyone's
398480	402100	saying this has a checkmark beside their names, obviously. None of them are anonymous, so
402100	407740	they want none of us to be anonymous too. As a social media professional, you look like
407740	412020	one, dude. I want everybody to understand this and the real issue. I've had to ban
412020	416120	so many people on Facebook for the terrible things they've said. Anonymity definitely
416120	421040	makes abuse easier because social media sites do a bad job of policing their spaces. These
421040	425900	people never stopped being children. They simply substituted their parents for a larger
425900	430860	authority whether that be corporations or the state. Make verified ID a requirement
430860	437180	for opening a social media account. Nearly 400,000 fucking idiots signed this petition.
437180	443540	It's ridiculous that I now have almost 12,000 accounts blocked. Nearly all of them are anonymous.
443540	447380	Requiring official ID would wipe out most trolling overnight. You have them blocked,
447380	450660	man. What's the problem? Like you've already solved the problem. Not all anonymous accounts
450660	453540	are used for bile or trolling. Some people have them to protect their identity or their
453540	458620	lives from others. And of course, the verified replies with, sorry, trolling is the top priority,
458620	462660	I'm afraid. It's literally killing people. If you're worried about being identified,
462660	467820	don't go on Twitter or Facebook. Trolling is literally killing people, guys. Some people
467820	472240	have never been punched in the face and it shows. Trolling is an issue. You need to get a grip like
472240	475460	you sound like a naive child who knows nothing. You're trash and your YouTube channel is trash.
475460	480500	You have been reported repair for a ban. These have to be the softest people that our species
480500	485980	has ever created. Like this is shit that kids would say back in the day. Now you have like
485980	490900	35 year olds saying this shit. The truth is though, a lot of these progressives want to
490900	494740	ban anonymity. Not because they're getting trolled. Well, maybe it's kind of because
494740	497620	they're getting trolled. They don't have a spine, but more importantly, because every day,
497620	502020	their propaganda attempts are effortlessly destroyed and replaced by much more coherent
502020	507260	analysis by idiots on Twitter named fart butt with daily dose, Vegeta Piccolo avatars,
507260	512540	who also post a big titty anime porn on their accounts. And the verifieds are so fucking angry
512700	516860	about it that every time they're showed to be the idiots that they are, they want that guy's
516860	522540	bank account information, his address and his place of employment so that they can use all
522540	527100	of their clout to ruin him for daring to talk back. This is old hat, by the way, I'm going to
527100	531180	CNN docs, the guy for making fun of them. That was like four years ago. I did a video on it back
531180	536020	in the day. The absolute worst site for abuse right now is Facebook, not even Twitter, Facebook,
536020	541860	and Facebook actually has a real name policy. So on some level, this isn't about being anonymous.
542220	546380	It's about stopping dissent. And of course, we all know this, right? It doesn't matter that
546380	551260	losing the right to be anonymous will hurt investigative journalists or whistleblowers
551260	556060	or free expression and privacy rights people or people who are gay or trans and still in the
556060	560300	closet or ex Muslims hiding from an oppressive family or people who are running away from
560300	565340	oppressive regimes of all types. These people will continue to screech that being anonymous
565340	570380	is inherently harassment and white supremacy and also their nonsense because they are simply
570380	574700	puppets for tyrants. And of course, we know the next step, right? As soon as you can easily
574700	579580	identify somebody for even the slightest of grievances, well, why not strip everything
579580	584220	from them? They're already guilty. And I've got a plan. The time has come to not only find these
584220	588780	people, not only to prosecute them for their lawless behavior, but also basically to ex
588780	593500	communicate them from our society. So forget about locking them up, forget about throwing away the
593500	597820	key. Forget about banning them from football stadiums, right? I've got a better idea. Instead,
597820	603020	let's make it impossible for them to actually have a life. No bank account, no ability to travel,
603020	607820	no passport, no benefits, nothing. Forget kicking out. Let's kick them out. We don't need them.
607820	613740	Britain doesn't need them. Adios amigos. And you don't like it because I've said that in Spanish,
613740	617820	no bank account, no ability to travel, no passport, no benefits, nothing. Of course,
617820	622940	these people never call for this regarding say pedophiles or rapists, maybe because they'd hit
622940	626700	too many of their own. This ties into cancel culture. And like I said before, it's already
626700	631420	been happening for years. This happened a little while ago, academic agent, a far right YouTuber,
631420	637180	allegedly a former Surrey lecturer was let go by his university. Now, I don't agree with AA's
637180	642860	politics that much, but should he be fired for them? No, of course, his GoFundMe meant to support
642860	648140	him and his family during that time was taken down. Because for people who have been canceled,
648140	652460	people who have had their anonymity stripped away from them, there is no more private life,
652460	658220	which is again, why this stuff isn't liberal shit, but leftist shit. It's not liberals who
658220	662540	say everything's political. We believe that it's important to have a non political space,
662540	667500	a private life. That being said, there are absolutely instances where leftists have been
667500	672940	very pro anonymous. Last year, somebody on GitHub programmed a face depixelizer. It does what it
672940	677740	says. It'll take a pixelized face and reveal it using algorithms. And here are some of the
677740	682620	leftist objections to it. Following the killing of George Floyd by police on May 25,
682620	687820	people of color across the US have been risking their lives in protests against police brutality
687820	693180	and a deeply racist system. Police have been known to threaten, assault and even kill protesters,
693180	697980	identifying them using information gathered from social media, as well as facial recognition
697980	702140	algorithms. The highly questionable ethics of releasing a tool that could be used to
702140	707260	subvert anonymization under any circumstance aside, releasing this right now is not only
707260	712860	incredibly dangerous, but can and will get people killed. Any use of this technology is an aid to
712860	717660	the illegitimate American police state and police states all over the world. What you're doing is
717660	721900	unethical and will lead to more and more deaths from the savage police system of the United
721900	726060	States. Of course, the problem is you can't really close a Pandora's box. Somebody will invent this
726060	730300	eventually, though I do think it's hilarious that they're calling it narc code. During the
730300	736540	Brianna Taylor protests, the protesters not only removed all white people, but also removed the
736540	739660	press. They, too, didn't want to be filmed.
766540	775820	A protest in DC saw protesters wearing masks, yes, because of COVID, but this wasn't allowed before,
775820	780700	and shining lights into the cameras of media to prevent them from documenting who was actually
780700	785180	there. Andy Ngo pointed out this is what Antifa were first doing to me back in 2018. Local
785180	789820	journalists stayed silent or said conservative media didn't deserve support. It emboldened Antifa
789820	794060	eventually to beat me and steal my equipment. Well, this is what happens. It starts with
794060	799100	conservative media, and now it is all media. Also from Andy Ngo, law enforcement in Portland
799100	803900	are expressing concern over Antifa's announced BLM direct action tonight in downtown. This was
803900	809500	back in November of 2020. Video recording was banned, which is a predictor of planned violence.
809500	814940	No streamers, no megaphones, no masters. The left absolutely understands the value of being
814940	819180	anonymous. No one is ever going to get anything done if you're filming them and giving them years
819180	823580	in prison or getting them killed and for what? So you can get money and a stupid action shot?
823580	828700	They absolutely want to go unseen. They want the media to report how stunning and brave they are,
828700	833820	but not actually film them as they commit crimes. To the point that the anarchist library has an
833820	839980	essay called In Defense of Smashing Cameras. This is where the left differs from the liberals in
839980	845100	their defensive anonymity. Our concern is not concerning the so-called right to take pictures
845100	850700	in a public place. We could care less about this boring defense that photographers resort to when
850780	856540	critiqued. Our question is not what are your rights in public? Rather, where do you stand
856540	862540	when it comes to social struggle? How do you act to further the revolt? Simply put, journalists do
862540	867340	not have any political right to a spectacle. They have the ability to participate in a moment of
867340	872860	revolt and they forgo that capacity by consigning the event to a digital memory rather than a future
872860	877660	possibility. While photographic evidence has been useful in the past, we maintain that by
877660	882540	prioritizing documentation in ignorance or indifference to its effect on an action,
882540	888140	journalists are not comrades. This is not a liberal defense of being anonymous. This in fact
888140	893980	strips away people's right to be a bystander. This is George Bush level you're with us or against us
893980	899020	shit. And of course they have 10 rules. One, contrary to what many protest photography tips
899020	903340	tell you, don't get up close. Two, if there are faces in your shot, blur them. A simple
903340	907580	swirl in photoshop won't do. We're talking scrambling such that the police cannot reverse
907580	911420	the process. Three, if there's distinctive or identifying clothing in your shot, blur them.
911420	915740	Four, if certain identities stick out, the few black bodies in a white protest for example,
915740	919900	delete the photo. Five, if you choose to participate as a spectator, keep in mind that
919900	923820	even spectators participate here, then realize that your participation is secondary to those
923820	927820	actively engaged in the moment of revolt. This means that you should step aside even if that
927820	932380	means losing the winning shot. Six, if possible, and it usually is,
932380	936380	ask for consent or indicate that you are taking a photo so that we have an option to turn away
936380	941020	or decline. Yes, we get it. We're in a public place you don't have to ask. But realize that failure to
941020	945500	ask makes us suspicious of your motivations and provides us with added reason to assert
945500	950780	our capacity for opacity. Seven, your camera is a weapon. Friendly fire is unacceptable.
950780	955740	Eight, you are a partisan in a social war. Become involved in the struggles you choose
955740	960300	to document. Should they be documented? If so, how should they be documented to
960300	963980	spread their capacities? Become a comrade and earn the trust of those around you.
964700	968780	Accepting professional activists. For the vast majority of us, this is not a career.
968780	975420	Nine, photograph the police. So again, all of these rules apply only to them and not to their
975420	980380	opponents. And ten, infer more guidelines from the analysis above. The left does not defend being
980380	986380	anonymous. It defends being anonymous for them. It's not just activists. It's not just activists
986380	991420	that progressives want anonymity to protect. This conversation also links very well with the
991420	997740	trans deadnaming thing. There is this push by progressives recently to basically remove every
997740	1002300	possible barrier to changing your name and your gender. Even the fact that it might cost a little
1002300	1007820	bit of money down at the DMV, that's too much. Most notably in the destiny versus the serfs
1007820	1013100	debate, where Lance thought it was incredibly fucked up that Google required people to have
1013100	1018220	their dead names on their official ID for security reasons. But if you can change your name at a whim
1018220	1024060	with no cost, just easily snip all the cords to your past and then go off burden-free. I mean,
1024060	1027980	it sounds nice, but what does that let you get away with? There have absolutely been instances
1027980	1032940	of people changing their names to avoid connection to a prior crime. If you make this easier,
1032940	1037580	even under the guise of trans rights, there will always be people who exploit it.
1037580	1043420	Mastercard even created something called True Name, which allows transgender and non-binary
1043420	1048380	people to display their chosen name on their credit card. Regardless of legal status,
1048940	1056060	this is 100% going to open the way to fraud, and also trolling. Thanks, Twitter.
1056060	1061180	And we can actually see the progressive hypocrisy on being anonymous, because even as they screech
1061260	1066700	for protecting anonymity for their activists, they are absolutely overwhelmingly the faction
1066700	1070380	of cancel culture right now. And yes, I've done videos on cancel culture before, so we're not
1070380	1074460	going to dig into it too deeply. But it is important to look at some examples specifically
1074460	1079100	in terms of being anonymous. Let's start here. A Deliveroo writer in Berlin made the mistake
1079100	1082460	of saying he thought Brexit was good to some remainder British customers. He accused him
1082460	1087820	of being a Nazi and he lost his job. As of early Sunday morning, four offensive tweets using an
1087820	1091820	anti-gay slur remained active on Kyler Murray's Twitter account.
1091820	1097340	I apologize for the tweets that have come to light tonight from when I was 14 and 15.
1097340	1100380	I used a poor choice of word that doesn't reflect who I am or what I believe.
1100380	1105020	Is this not fucking ridiculous? Shit posting as a kid and it comes back to haunt you when
1105020	1109340	you're an adult. I am so happy I did not grow up in the age of social media. Holy shit,
1109340	1112940	dude. How Kevin Hart tweeted himself out of a job hosting the Oscars.
1112940	1117900	Step one, be really mean to gay people for no reason. In 2011, he tweeted,
1117900	1120860	yo, if my son comes home and tries to play with my daughter's dollhouse,
1120860	1126540	I'm going to break it over his head and say in my voice, stop, that's gay. Yes, humor was edgier
1126540	1131340	back in the day. Yes, that's not a problem. You know what? It was better. The American Humanist
1131340	1135420	Association has withdrawn an honor from Richard Dawkins. And I don't know if you're an atheist
1135420	1139500	and you're critiquing religion. I don't think it's racist to critique Islam. This is a Canadian
1139500	1144620	sports program. And this went down last year. We apologize to Hal Johnson for the racism he
1144620	1153980	experienced at TSN beginning in 1988. I mean, I'm sure it sucked, but it's 1988, dude. A 1971
1153980	1159660	Playboy interview featuring John Wayne's comments on race and sexuality have stirred a fresh debate.
1159660	1165580	Holy fuck. How long has John Wayne been dead for? Who cares? The past was problematic. Fucking live
1165580	1170220	with it. If I haven't yet made it clear to you, the point is progressives view anonymity as they
1170220	1175980	view many other things as a privilege. One set of rules for thee and another for me. And when some
1175980	1180620	dumb fuck online says, oh, you're an anonymous account, no one's trying to dox you. Just present
1180620	1185500	yourself, Mr. Anime Avatar. It sounds a whole lot like Goebbels saying, if you have nothing to fear,
1185500	1189580	you have nothing to hide. A lot of these people, the progressives, the check marks,
1189580	1194540	even the socialist activists who want this stuff, they're all pawns. None of them have any real
1194540	1199900	power, but they are being used because the actual powers that be are moving on the anonymous
1199900	1205900	question. And they're using the left's brain dead defense of removing anonymity to justify doing so.
1205900	1211340	As of April of this year, anonymous social media accounts in Australia might be gone. They may need
1211340	1217180	100 points of identification to use social media. A judge has granted the first known warrant for
1217180	1223180	law enforcement to conduct a dragnet search through the DNA of 1.3 million people in the
1223180	1230140	GED matched genetic genealogy database. 86% of those users did not explicitly consent to
1230140	1235740	law enforcement searches. The US wants smartphone location data to fight the coronavirus. The
1235740	1240380	Pentagon is surveilling Americans without a warrant revealed by a senator back in May.
1240380	1246780	And as another reminder, this isn't new. Back in 2018, Jess Phillips was calling for the banning
1246780	1251420	of anonymous social media accounts, and the Guardian was happy to support her on this.
1251420	1256060	In the present day, Diane Abbott has said that social media companies should collect names and
1256060	1261900	addresses of all social media users, stating that absolute anonymity on social media has had its
1261900	1268060	day. Last week, there was a huge controversy, as it was discovered that the NSA was actually spying
1268060	1274300	on Tucker Carlson. There's definitely been a slow boiling the frog on the anonymity issue.
1274300	1279420	Back in 2001, when we had the Patriot Act passed, they were saying they were only going to spy on
1279420	1284220	foreign enemies. By 2013, we had learned that the NSA had spied on Americans, but nobody cared.
1284220	1289100	By 2014, we had learned that the CIA had spied on the US Senate, but they were really sorry about
1289100	1293740	it. By 2017, we had learned that the FBI had spied on Donald Trump while he was president,
1293740	1299180	but I mean, he's Hitler, so who cares, right? By 2021, we had realized the NSA had spied on
1299180	1303740	US journalists, but it's just Tucker Carlson, so who gives a shit, right? It has been both
1303820	1309580	governments and corporations getting people used to the idea that it's okay if they're spied on,
1309580	1313900	that it's okay if they don't have a private life, and it seems that people generally don't object
1313900	1321260	to this until it's their job that's lost, or their friends that shun them, or their speech that's
1321260	1325900	been silenced. Even Anonymous themselves, like the activist group Anonymous, has turned into a
1325900	1331340	fucking joke. As my pal Brick once said before he got banned off Twitter, Anonymous in 2008,
1331340	1335420	we DDoS the Church of Scientology and track down pedophiles. Anonymous in 2020,
1335420	1340620	Twitter, please help us, they're ruining my poll. People for like thousands of years at this point,
1340620	1345580	people have understood the value of being anonymous, of being able to actually say what's
1345580	1351340	on your mind. Literally speaking truth to power, that is what being anonymous allows for, to have a
1351340	1357500	place that is private, to have a location where you don't have to be always on, to be able to
1357500	1361820	regroup and then come back to those things that you find politically important in life,
1362380	1368860	with a renewed energy, or with renewed arguments, or new ideas. In this video I have done what in my
1368860	1372940	opinion is a completely justified overlap between the concept of anonymity and the concept of
1372940	1378140	privacy, because when you take away one you must necessarily take away the other, and that is
1378140	1382060	absolutely what they're gunning for. They are gunning for not only your ability to be anonymous,
1383020	1389100	to say things anonymously online, to not get fired over an old take from when you were a child,
1389100	1392540	or a controversial political opinion that you really shouldn't be fired for,
1392540	1398540	but what goes with that is also the ability to live privately, to not live in a glass house.
1398540	1404540	At the same time, as a content creator who has been doxxed, I do kind of understand the objection to
1404540	1409180	it, right? Let's be honest here, let's give the devil his due. If you're a streamer, especially
1409180	1413260	if you're a lot bigger than me, I understand larger streamers have this to the nth degree,
1413260	1418700	but if you're a streamer or you're a video creator, where everything you do is hate-watched
1418700	1423100	and catalogued, and then put into an archive for like three years, only to be pulled out later by
1423100	1428380	somebody who absolutely fucking wants to destroy you, and that person is completely anonymous,
1428380	1433180	does kind of seem unfair, doesn't it? Yes, it's part of the job, but in the moment when it happens
1433180	1437260	it does feel unfair. But, because it's generally progressives doing this sort of thing,
1438220	1443820	and they want anonymity for them and not for you, they see no problems with this. They should be
1443820	1448540	anonymous, and the creators they harass should absolutely not be. There's no principles here,
1448540	1452460	there's simply power. So I understand it when a content creator says, hey, you're out here
1452460	1455820	shitting on me and like hate-watching me and cataloging everything that I do,
1455820	1459340	but you're not going to step to the plate? Like, I understand their position. But at the same time,
1459340	1465580	this is why progressives scream bloody murder when there is a popular, well-known content creator who
1465580	1469900	manages to remain anonymous. And there are some of them. Like, I don't think anyone's doxxed It's
1469900	1475580	a Gundam yet, and people fucking hate him. But forcing everybody to be named is not the answer.
1476140	1480220	In fact, it seems to me like a better answer is forcing everybody to be anonymous.
1480220	1484060	That's why I still like places like 4chan, and to a lesser extent Newgrounds,
1484060	1488860	they still hold that principle. Now, there are some solutions floating around out there.
1489420	1494300	One of them is the EU's right to be forgotten. The idea behind the right to be forgotten is
1494300	1498780	that its proponents believe that there should be a right to have private information about
1498780	1502540	a person removed from the internet. The problem with the right to be forgotten is that it
1502540	1507740	directly clashes with the right to access of information, the right to education, and yes,
1507740	1511260	the right to speech and the right to freedom of expression, as well as criticism over the
1511260	1516300	possibility of using it to rewrite history or maintain censorship. Of course, there are good
1516300	1521420	reasons to consider such a thing too. Not simply cancel culture or the right to be anonymous,
1521420	1526460	but also stuff like revenge porn or having absolute falsehoods appear whenever you get
1526460	1530140	your name searched on Google or something. However, the right to be forgotten, especially
1530140	1535500	how the EU implements it, seems to be a sledgehammer of a tool when the situation
1535500	1540300	probably requires something more like a scalpel. Lilith had this idea that doxing should be a
1540300	1544380	federal crime, it's not free speech to post people's information for malicious purposes.
1544380	1548460	Dankula replied with, I would argue that private administration information about an individual
1548540	1552140	is their private property that can only be shared with their permission. Tech companies that use
1552140	1556220	data as currency would also be seething. That seems to target most of the bad parts of the
1556220	1560220	equation here without actually infringing on people's right to free speech. I do disagree
1560220	1565340	with Lilith here though. She says, none of that lol I found your information through extensive digging,
1565340	1569660	so it's basically public. I get what she's saying, but the problem with this point of view is that
1569660	1573820	it completely disregards the fact that phone books used to be a thing. Now for those of you zoomers
1573820	1579260	don't know what a phone book is, back in the day everybody's name, address, and phone number,
1579260	1583820	in your area anyway, your local area, was listed in a phone book. And so if you wanted to look up
1583820	1587980	somebody's number and call them, all you had to do was fill out your phone book. Everyone had one,
1587980	1592060	they were given away by the city once a year for free with updates and every yearly revision,
1592060	1595980	and the concept of the phone book has since fallen out of style. Nobody knows what they are anymore,
1595980	1601100	nobody cares about them, but they are new enough that back during gamergate, back in 2014 when
1601100	1605580	gamergate was happening, and Zoe Quinn was screaming bloody murder about being doxxed by
1605580	1611340	people, it turns out that her doxxing came from the phone book. Because in 2014 they were on the
1611340	1615180	way out, but they weren't gone yet. And anyone who lived in her area or her family's area could
1615180	1620700	simply look her up in the phone book. The argument against doxxing back then was that if you could
1620700	1626140	find it in a phone book, it wasn't doxxing because that was absolutely publicly available information.
1626140	1629820	And that seems like a good argument even now. There's a difference though. There's no more
1629820	1635740	phone books. And not only is there no more phone books, people are way crazier nowadays than they
1635740	1641100	were in 2014. Cancel culture was minuscule back then compared to now. But still, Dankula seems
1641100	1646060	to have a good solution here. If we can consider data to be property, and therefore it can only
1646060	1650940	legally be shared with the person's express permission, then I think that would solve a
1650940	1655500	lot of the problems. But not all of them. There are absolutely some people out there who just
1655500	1659180	don't give a shit. They'll say, you know what, I like Facebook too much, I like Instagram too
1659180	1663660	much, I like TikTok too much, fuck it. You can have all the data, I don't care. Here it is.
1663660	1669020	I'll gladly sign whatever piece of paper you put in front of me so I can use these fun services.
1669020	1672620	And then when they go out and get fucking cancelled because all their data's out there,
1672620	1676780	it'll be too late. That being said, it's a far better solution than the government forcing
1676780	1682060	all social media to collect everyone's data and remove anonymity in the process. That sounds
1682060	1686620	absolutely fucking terrible. I wouldn't mind a world where there's like a set of social media
1686620	1692380	platforms that are old, archaic, and completely data collection heavy, and then a set of newer
1692380	1695900	social media platforms that are more anonymized. I'm okay with that. But like I said at the
1695900	1700620	beginning of the video, this is only partially about being anonymous. It is more importantly
1700620	1705500	about the destruction of the concept of privacy, and what it does to those people who have been
1705500	1709980	affected by it. I mentioned Academic Agent earlier, but there have been many YouTubers
1709980	1714860	and content creators who have had their lives destroyed by hate viewers. And those people,
1715420	1720700	in order to survive because they're now completely unemployable, they have to rely on basically the
1720700	1725500	charity of their viewers, whether that be through watching ads on YouTube or Twitch or wherever
1725500	1730540	they happen to be putting their stuff, through donations, through subs on Twitch, through super
1730540	1735340	chats, through Patreon or Subscribestar donations, whatever it is. As more people express wrong
1735340	1740540	opinions and are cancelled for it, more and more of them turn towards crowdfunding to stay alive.
1740540	1745500	And then those people who hold the same opinions, but still manage to have an income,
1745500	1749740	and let's assume that they actually care about supporting the YouTubers and content creators
1749740	1753820	that they like, well now they have to support another one, and another one, and another one.
1753820	1760060	It almost feels like a long war of attrition to slowly destroy those people who are ideologically
1760060	1765420	opposed to wokeness. If your opposition cannot even provide for themselves and their family,
1765420	1770620	then one, they're less able to move against you, and two, that is an extra burden on their
1770620	1775420	community for those people who still can support themselves. This is the reality of the culture
1775420	1780060	war. It's not going to be a bloody conflict or a riot in the streets. Those do happen,
1780060	1789100	but those are primarily a distraction. The real war is a slow, steady march to destroy all dissent.
1789100	1794220	This is the main reason why alt tech has to survive. Because if it doesn't, there will be
1794220	1799180	no anonymity. It will be a dystopia where you have no privacy and everything you do is watched.
1799180	1805260	And every single dumbfuck progressive out there will cheer it on until the day it finally comes
1805260	1809660	for them. You use the wrong pronoun, you tell the wrong joke, you make the wrong hand gesture,
1809660	1813900	say the wrong word, wear the wrong clothes, order the wrong food, sing the wrong song.
1813900	1818620	Nobody can keep track of all of their rules, so eventually everyone slips up. And as soon as you
1818620	1822620	do, you're far right, you're a bigot, you're islamophobic, you're a knuckle dragger, you're
1822620	1827180	hateful, you're white trash, you're a patriarch. All of your previous virtue signaling counts for
1827180	1833020	nothing. You can never be forgiven. You will always be that person who did that problematic
1833020	1838300	thing. You'll be unemployable, unlovable, unwanted. You will be exactly like those people that you
1838300	1843660	currently torment. This is the brave new world you've created. Welcome to the purity spiral.
1843660	1847900	It's a long way down. Hey guys, that's the end of the video, so thanks for watching. What I
1847900	1853340	described here has also unfortunately happened to my roommate. Simply, through his association
1853340	1858460	with me, he actually lost his job. And until he can get back up on his feet, he's helping me out
1858460	1863660	with my projects and this channel supporting him too. So, if you're interested in keeping us going,
1863660	1867740	please consider dropping by our gaming channel. Tomorrow night we're playing the Skyward Sword
1867740	1872060	HD release. We actually have a pretty big event planned for it, so it'll be I think a pretty
1872060	1876300	fun stream. Thanks very much for your support, and I'll see you there. I love you.
