00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,440
To anyone who's made Let's Plays or commentary or any other kind of YouTube video, you've

2
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:15,180
probably seen Audacity before. It's a lightweight, feature-filled, easy-to-use audio recording

3
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:19,740
program. Pretty much everybody uses it. Even a lot of the big players in the YouTube scene

4
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:25,020
use it. Because it's just as good, and sometimes even better, than professional options like

5
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:29,200
Adobe Audition. And the recent controversy surrounding it is that it's now a possible

6
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:34,300
spyware. The famous open-source audio manipulation program was acquired by a company named Muse

7
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:38,540
Group two months ago. The same company owns other projects in its portfolio, such as Ultimate

8
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:42,620
Guitar and MuseScore. Ever since then, Audacity has been a heated topic. The parent company

9
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:46,660
is a multinational company, and it has been trying to start a data collection mechanism

10
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:51,220
in the software. While Audacity is nothing more than a desktop program, its developers

11
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:55,200
want to make it phone home with various data taken from users' machines.

12
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:59,340
And here's a look at their new terms of service. What personal data does Audacity

13
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:03,780
collect and why? They'll collect your operating system version, your country based on your

14
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:09,780
IP, details about your computer, non-fatal error codes and messages, and crash reports.

15
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:14,660
The IP is a bit sketchy, but this is pretty normal for most programs. However, they also

16
00:01:14,660 --> 00:01:19,900
collect for legal enforcement, data necessary for law enforcement, litigation and authorities

17
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:25,540
requests, if any. What does that mean? Well, nobody knows. They're not telling us. But

18
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:29,880
it is entirely possible that they could be just collecting copies of anything that you

19
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:35,160
record with the program. Who does Audacity share your personal data with? Our staff members,

20
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:41,300
any competent law enforcement body, regulatory, government agency, court or other third party,

21
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:46,800
our auditors, advisors, legal representatives and similar agents, and to a potential buyer.

22
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:51,140
At the same time, they also added this clause. The app we provide is not intended for individuals

23
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:55,700
below the age of 13. If you are under 13 years old, please do not use the app. In many parts

24
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:59,960
of the internet using world, there's pretty strict laws regarding data collection from

25
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:05,700
people who are under the age of 13. So it really sounds like Audacity plans to collect

26
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:10,220
all of your data, like every other app out there, and sell it in order to make some kind

27
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:16,540
of a profit. In essence, Audacity has become spyware. Audacity uses the GPL3 license. It's

28
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:21,120
a license for open source software, mainly because people who make free software don't

29
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:27,080
want it being stolen by big corpos. How it works is GPL code is considered to be free

30
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:31,240
and open source, meaning anyone can use it and no one can charge money for it. And how

31
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:36,360
the license works is that if you use any GPL code from somebody else's project, then all

32
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:42,680
of the code in your project also has to be GPL. GPL software legally has to be free and

33
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:47,180
not have any restrictions on who can use it. Audacity's new owners are trying to circumvent

34
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:53,140
this by having their coders sign new agreements to change Audacity's license over to a different

35
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:57,340
one, which would allow it to be sold as regular software. But to do so, they have to rewrite

36
00:02:57,340 --> 00:03:04,120
code that was made by GPL contributors, especially those who are refusing to sign. And yes, this

37
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:08,000
is a violation of the GPL license because derivative works are also legally covered

38
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:13,740
by GPL, meaning that if you look at, say, a GPL program and say, you know what, I don't

39
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:18,180
want to deal with this license bullshit. I'll just remake it looking at this. Well, that's

40
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:21,780
still covered by the license because if you're just rewriting the code to do the exact same

41
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:26,700
thing for the explicit purpose of replacing existing code, you are absolutely in for a

42
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:31,660
legal battle. And if Audacity's new owners successfully managed to actually do this,

43
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:35,900
there will likely be a new license because the current license is GPL3. They're likely

44
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:40,640
going to make GPL4, which closes all of these loopholes. In other words, people are fucking

45
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:45,080
pissed and I don't blame them, man. This is a reliable piece of software that's been used

46
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:48,960
for over a decade. And now that it's in the hands of new owners, they're suddenly harvesting

47
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:55,520
everybody's data. This affects Audacity 3.0.0 or later. So if you still want to use the

48
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:59,720
program, get a previous version. Additionally, get it from a site that's not the Audacity

49
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:04,240
official site, just in case. But as always, there's a wider story here. And the story

50
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:08,600
is that of privacy. Every website seems to be going in the shitter nowadays, and they're

51
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:14,200
all requiring like a phone number or a picture of your photo ID or something. They want you

52
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:17,860
to basically plant a beacon at your house and let everybody know where you are. And

53
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:22,820
it's rather ridiculous, isn't it? At least to my sensibilities, it is. I'm old enough

54
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:27,420
that I come from an era of the internet where like your parents and PSAs and stuff on TV

55
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:32,220
would say, hey, don't give out your private information online. That's dangerous. Who

56
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:37,120
knows who might be out there? And you know what? That's still true. And everybody's forgotten

57
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:42,200
it. At one point being anonymous used to be prudent until Facebook made being publicly

58
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:47,720
identifiable trendy. It's not just Twitter and Facebook. It's even more niche things

59
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:53,600
like GitHub, or those Snapchat and Instagram personality quizzes. The most recent push

60
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:58,540
against anonymity is happening due to the the soccer situation over in Europe right

61
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:03,460
now. I will have a video with Lilith and I talking about that situation more in depth,

62
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:06,960
but we can do a surface level right now for this conversation. Piers Morgan went viral

63
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:11,760
a couple days ago for this stunningly stupid take. Racist abuse targeted at England football

64
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:18,240
stars exposes social media's biggest failing. It's time tech firms ban all anonymous accounts

65
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:24,800
and insist on ID so we can see how brave these bigoted scumbags feel when they're made accountable.

66
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:30,340
In the name of progressive values, get rid of anonymity. Of course it's not just soccer

67
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:34,860
players, it's actors and comedians and verified people of all stripes. None of them like the

68
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:39,100
fact that they can actually be talked back to. That a commoner actually has a method

69
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:44,520
by which they can point at them and say, no, you're ridiculous. Fuck off. They simply want

70
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:50,460
to be able to rule unchallenged. Here's old man Devo story number 9000 on this channel.

71
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:55,020
Two in one video in fact. But when I was younger and the left was the dissident voice

72
00:05:55,020 --> 00:06:00,080
and not the main culture, anonymity was highly valued among progressives because they feared

73
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:04,020
retaliation from the religious conservative monoculture. But now that these people are

74
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:08,200
in charge, now that they're the ones wielding power, the protection of being anonymous has

75
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:12,620
to go. And yeah, they all feel this way. Boris and parliament should stop online racism in

76
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:16,440
its tracks by passing legislation forcing Twitter and Facebook in the UK to have only

77
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:20,720
named accounts, checking people's details and banning anonymous ones. It happens in

78
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:25,920
bedding, so why not social media? Come on Zuckerberg, literally in online papers, please.

79
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:29,480
Social media companies need to step up and take accountability and action to ban abusers

80
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:33,460
from their platforms. Gather evidence that can lead to prosecution and support making

81
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:38,480
their platforms free from this type of abuse. Stop anonymity and require ID. Everyone's

82
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:42,100
saying this has a checkmark beside their names, obviously. None of them are anonymous, so

83
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:47,740
they want none of us to be anonymous too. As a social media professional, you look like

84
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:52,020
one, dude. I want everybody to understand this and the real issue. I've had to ban

85
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:56,120
so many people on Facebook for the terrible things they've said. Anonymity definitely

86
00:06:56,120 --> 00:07:01,040
makes abuse easier because social media sites do a bad job of policing their spaces. These

87
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:05,900
people never stopped being children. They simply substituted their parents for a larger

88
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:10,860
authority whether that be corporations or the state. Make verified ID a requirement

89
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:17,180
for opening a social media account. Nearly 400,000 fucking idiots signed this petition.

90
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:23,540
It's ridiculous that I now have almost 12,000 accounts blocked. Nearly all of them are anonymous.

91
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:27,380
Requiring official ID would wipe out most trolling overnight. You have them blocked,

92
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:30,660
man. What's the problem? Like you've already solved the problem. Not all anonymous accounts

93
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:33,540
are used for bile or trolling. Some people have them to protect their identity or their

94
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:38,620
lives from others. And of course, the verified replies with, sorry, trolling is the top priority,

95
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:42,660
I'm afraid. It's literally killing people. If you're worried about being identified,

96
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:47,820
don't go on Twitter or Facebook. Trolling is literally killing people, guys. Some people

97
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:52,240
have never been punched in the face and it shows. Trolling is an issue. You need to get a grip like

98
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:55,460
you sound like a naive child who knows nothing. You're trash and your YouTube channel is trash.

99
00:07:55,460 --> 00:08:00,500
You have been reported repair for a ban. These have to be the softest people that our species

100
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:05,980
has ever created. Like this is shit that kids would say back in the day. Now you have like

101
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:10,900
35 year olds saying this shit. The truth is though, a lot of these progressives want to

102
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:14,740
ban anonymity. Not because they're getting trolled. Well, maybe it's kind of because

103
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:17,620
they're getting trolled. They don't have a spine, but more importantly, because every day,

104
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:22,020
their propaganda attempts are effortlessly destroyed and replaced by much more coherent

105
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:27,260
analysis by idiots on Twitter named fart butt with daily dose, Vegeta Piccolo avatars,

106
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:32,540
who also post a big titty anime porn on their accounts. And the verifieds are so fucking angry

107
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:36,860
about it that every time they're showed to be the idiots that they are, they want that guy's

108
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:42,540
bank account information, his address and his place of employment so that they can use all

109
00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:47,100
of their clout to ruin him for daring to talk back. This is old hat, by the way, I'm going to

110
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:51,180
CNN docs, the guy for making fun of them. That was like four years ago. I did a video on it back

111
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:56,020
in the day. The absolute worst site for abuse right now is Facebook, not even Twitter, Facebook,

112
00:08:56,020 --> 00:09:01,860
and Facebook actually has a real name policy. So on some level, this isn't about being anonymous.

113
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:06,380
It's about stopping dissent. And of course, we all know this, right? It doesn't matter that

114
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:11,260
losing the right to be anonymous will hurt investigative journalists or whistleblowers

115
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:16,060
or free expression and privacy rights people or people who are gay or trans and still in the

116
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:20,300
closet or ex Muslims hiding from an oppressive family or people who are running away from

117
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:25,340
oppressive regimes of all types. These people will continue to screech that being anonymous

118
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:30,380
is inherently harassment and white supremacy and also their nonsense because they are simply

119
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:34,700
puppets for tyrants. And of course, we know the next step, right? As soon as you can easily

120
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:39,580
identify somebody for even the slightest of grievances, well, why not strip everything

121
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:44,220
from them? They're already guilty. And I've got a plan. The time has come to not only find these

122
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:48,780
people, not only to prosecute them for their lawless behavior, but also basically to ex

123
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:53,500
communicate them from our society. So forget about locking them up, forget about throwing away the

124
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:57,820
key. Forget about banning them from football stadiums, right? I've got a better idea. Instead,

125
00:09:57,820 --> 00:10:03,020
let's make it impossible for them to actually have a life. No bank account, no ability to travel,

126
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:07,820
no passport, no benefits, nothing. Forget kicking out. Let's kick them out. We don't need them.

127
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:13,740
Britain doesn't need them. Adios amigos. And you don't like it because I've said that in Spanish,

128
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:17,820
no bank account, no ability to travel, no passport, no benefits, nothing. Of course,

129
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:22,940
these people never call for this regarding say pedophiles or rapists, maybe because they'd hit

130
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:26,700
too many of their own. This ties into cancel culture. And like I said before, it's already

131
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:31,420
been happening for years. This happened a little while ago, academic agent, a far right YouTuber,

132
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:37,180
allegedly a former Surrey lecturer was let go by his university. Now, I don't agree with AA's

133
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:42,860
politics that much, but should he be fired for them? No, of course, his GoFundMe meant to support

134
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:48,140
him and his family during that time was taken down. Because for people who have been canceled,

135
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:52,460
people who have had their anonymity stripped away from them, there is no more private life,

136
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:58,220
which is again, why this stuff isn't liberal shit, but leftist shit. It's not liberals who

137
00:10:58,220 --> 00:11:02,540
say everything's political. We believe that it's important to have a non political space,

138
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:07,500
a private life. That being said, there are absolutely instances where leftists have been

139
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:12,940
very pro anonymous. Last year, somebody on GitHub programmed a face depixelizer. It does what it

140
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:17,740
says. It'll take a pixelized face and reveal it using algorithms. And here are some of the

141
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:22,620
leftist objections to it. Following the killing of George Floyd by police on May 25,

142
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:27,820
people of color across the US have been risking their lives in protests against police brutality

143
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:33,180
and a deeply racist system. Police have been known to threaten, assault and even kill protesters,

144
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:37,980
identifying them using information gathered from social media, as well as facial recognition

145
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:42,140
algorithms. The highly questionable ethics of releasing a tool that could be used to

146
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:47,260
subvert anonymization under any circumstance aside, releasing this right now is not only

147
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:52,860
incredibly dangerous, but can and will get people killed. Any use of this technology is an aid to

148
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:57,660
the illegitimate American police state and police states all over the world. What you're doing is

149
00:11:57,660 --> 00:12:01,900
unethical and will lead to more and more deaths from the savage police system of the United

150
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:06,060
States. Of course, the problem is you can't really close a Pandora's box. Somebody will invent this

151
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:10,300
eventually, though I do think it's hilarious that they're calling it narc code. During the

152
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:16,540
Brianna Taylor protests, the protesters not only removed all white people, but also removed the

153
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:19,660
press. They, too, didn't want to be filmed.

154
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:55,820
A protest in DC saw protesters wearing masks, yes, because of COVID, but this wasn't allowed before,

155
00:12:55,820 --> 00:13:00,700
and shining lights into the cameras of media to prevent them from documenting who was actually

156
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:05,180
there. Andy Ngo pointed out this is what Antifa were first doing to me back in 2018. Local

157
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:09,820
journalists stayed silent or said conservative media didn't deserve support. It emboldened Antifa

158
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:14,060
eventually to beat me and steal my equipment. Well, this is what happens. It starts with

159
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:19,100
conservative media, and now it is all media. Also from Andy Ngo, law enforcement in Portland

160
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:23,900
are expressing concern over Antifa's announced BLM direct action tonight in downtown. This was

161
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:29,500
back in November of 2020. Video recording was banned, which is a predictor of planned violence.

162
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:34,940
No streamers, no megaphones, no masters. The left absolutely understands the value of being

163
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:39,180
anonymous. No one is ever going to get anything done if you're filming them and giving them years

164
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:43,580
in prison or getting them killed and for what? So you can get money and a stupid action shot?

165
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:48,700
They absolutely want to go unseen. They want the media to report how stunning and brave they are,

166
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:53,820
but not actually film them as they commit crimes. To the point that the anarchist library has an

167
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:59,980
essay called In Defense of Smashing Cameras. This is where the left differs from the liberals in

168
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:05,100
their defensive anonymity. Our concern is not concerning the so-called right to take pictures

169
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:10,700
in a public place. We could care less about this boring defense that photographers resort to when

170
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:16,540
critiqued. Our question is not what are your rights in public? Rather, where do you stand

171
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:22,540
when it comes to social struggle? How do you act to further the revolt? Simply put, journalists do

172
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:27,340
not have any political right to a spectacle. They have the ability to participate in a moment of

173
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:32,860
revolt and they forgo that capacity by consigning the event to a digital memory rather than a future

174
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:37,660
possibility. While photographic evidence has been useful in the past, we maintain that by

175
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:42,540
prioritizing documentation in ignorance or indifference to its effect on an action,

176
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:48,140
journalists are not comrades. This is not a liberal defense of being anonymous. This in fact

177
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:53,980
strips away people's right to be a bystander. This is George Bush level you're with us or against us

178
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:59,020
shit. And of course they have 10 rules. One, contrary to what many protest photography tips

179
00:14:59,020 --> 00:15:03,340
tell you, don't get up close. Two, if there are faces in your shot, blur them. A simple

180
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:07,580
swirl in photoshop won't do. We're talking scrambling such that the police cannot reverse

181
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:11,420
the process. Three, if there's distinctive or identifying clothing in your shot, blur them.

182
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:15,740
Four, if certain identities stick out, the few black bodies in a white protest for example,

183
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:19,900
delete the photo. Five, if you choose to participate as a spectator, keep in mind that

184
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:23,820
even spectators participate here, then realize that your participation is secondary to those

185
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:27,820
actively engaged in the moment of revolt. This means that you should step aside even if that

186
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:32,380
means losing the winning shot. Six, if possible, and it usually is,

187
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:36,380
ask for consent or indicate that you are taking a photo so that we have an option to turn away

188
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:41,020
or decline. Yes, we get it. We're in a public place you don't have to ask. But realize that failure to

189
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:45,500
ask makes us suspicious of your motivations and provides us with added reason to assert

190
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:50,780
our capacity for opacity. Seven, your camera is a weapon. Friendly fire is unacceptable.

191
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:55,740
Eight, you are a partisan in a social war. Become involved in the struggles you choose

192
00:15:55,740 --> 00:16:00,300
to document. Should they be documented? If so, how should they be documented to

193
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:03,980
spread their capacities? Become a comrade and earn the trust of those around you.

194
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:08,780
Accepting professional activists. For the vast majority of us, this is not a career.

195
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:15,420
Nine, photograph the police. So again, all of these rules apply only to them and not to their

196
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:20,380
opponents. And ten, infer more guidelines from the analysis above. The left does not defend being

197
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:26,380
anonymous. It defends being anonymous for them. It's not just activists. It's not just activists

198
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:31,420
that progressives want anonymity to protect. This conversation also links very well with the

199
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:37,740
trans deadnaming thing. There is this push by progressives recently to basically remove every

200
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:42,300
possible barrier to changing your name and your gender. Even the fact that it might cost a little

201
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:47,820
bit of money down at the DMV, that's too much. Most notably in the destiny versus the serfs

202
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:53,100
debate, where Lance thought it was incredibly fucked up that Google required people to have

203
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:58,220
their dead names on their official ID for security reasons. But if you can change your name at a whim

204
00:16:58,220 --> 00:17:04,060
with no cost, just easily snip all the cords to your past and then go off burden-free. I mean,

205
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:07,980
it sounds nice, but what does that let you get away with? There have absolutely been instances

206
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:12,940
of people changing their names to avoid connection to a prior crime. If you make this easier,

207
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:17,580
even under the guise of trans rights, there will always be people who exploit it.

208
00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:23,420
Mastercard even created something called True Name, which allows transgender and non-binary

209
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:28,380
people to display their chosen name on their credit card. Regardless of legal status,

210
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:36,060
this is 100% going to open the way to fraud, and also trolling. Thanks, Twitter.

211
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:41,180
And we can actually see the progressive hypocrisy on being anonymous, because even as they screech

212
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:46,700
for protecting anonymity for their activists, they are absolutely overwhelmingly the faction

213
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:50,380
of cancel culture right now. And yes, I've done videos on cancel culture before, so we're not

214
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:54,460
going to dig into it too deeply. But it is important to look at some examples specifically

215
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:59,100
in terms of being anonymous. Let's start here. A Deliveroo writer in Berlin made the mistake

216
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:02,460
of saying he thought Brexit was good to some remainder British customers. He accused him

217
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:07,820
of being a Nazi and he lost his job. As of early Sunday morning, four offensive tweets using an

218
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:11,820
anti-gay slur remained active on Kyler Murray's Twitter account.

219
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:17,340
I apologize for the tweets that have come to light tonight from when I was 14 and 15.

220
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:20,380
I used a poor choice of word that doesn't reflect who I am or what I believe.

221
00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:25,020
Is this not fucking ridiculous? Shit posting as a kid and it comes back to haunt you when

222
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:29,340
you're an adult. I am so happy I did not grow up in the age of social media. Holy shit,

223
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:32,940
dude. How Kevin Hart tweeted himself out of a job hosting the Oscars.

224
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:37,900
Step one, be really mean to gay people for no reason. In 2011, he tweeted,

225
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:40,860
yo, if my son comes home and tries to play with my daughter's dollhouse,

226
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:46,540
I'm going to break it over his head and say in my voice, stop, that's gay. Yes, humor was edgier

227
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:51,340
back in the day. Yes, that's not a problem. You know what? It was better. The American Humanist

228
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:55,420
Association has withdrawn an honor from Richard Dawkins. And I don't know if you're an atheist

229
00:18:55,420 --> 00:18:59,500
and you're critiquing religion. I don't think it's racist to critique Islam. This is a Canadian

230
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:04,620
sports program. And this went down last year. We apologize to Hal Johnson for the racism he

231
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:13,980
experienced at TSN beginning in 1988. I mean, I'm sure it sucked, but it's 1988, dude. A 1971

232
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:19,660
Playboy interview featuring John Wayne's comments on race and sexuality have stirred a fresh debate.

233
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:25,580
Holy fuck. How long has John Wayne been dead for? Who cares? The past was problematic. Fucking live

234
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:30,220
with it. If I haven't yet made it clear to you, the point is progressives view anonymity as they

235
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:35,980
view many other things as a privilege. One set of rules for thee and another for me. And when some

236
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:40,620
dumb fuck online says, oh, you're an anonymous account, no one's trying to dox you. Just present

237
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:45,500
yourself, Mr. Anime Avatar. It sounds a whole lot like Goebbels saying, if you have nothing to fear,

238
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:49,580
you have nothing to hide. A lot of these people, the progressives, the check marks,

239
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:54,540
even the socialist activists who want this stuff, they're all pawns. None of them have any real

240
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:59,900
power, but they are being used because the actual powers that be are moving on the anonymous

241
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:05,900
question. And they're using the left's brain dead defense of removing anonymity to justify doing so.

242
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:11,340
As of April of this year, anonymous social media accounts in Australia might be gone. They may need

243
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:17,180
100 points of identification to use social media. A judge has granted the first known warrant for

244
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:23,180
law enforcement to conduct a dragnet search through the DNA of 1.3 million people in the

245
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:30,140
GED matched genetic genealogy database. 86% of those users did not explicitly consent to

246
00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:35,740
law enforcement searches. The US wants smartphone location data to fight the coronavirus. The

247
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:40,380
Pentagon is surveilling Americans without a warrant revealed by a senator back in May.

248
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:46,780
And as another reminder, this isn't new. Back in 2018, Jess Phillips was calling for the banning

249
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:51,420
of anonymous social media accounts, and the Guardian was happy to support her on this.

250
00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:56,060
In the present day, Diane Abbott has said that social media companies should collect names and

251
00:20:56,060 --> 00:21:01,900
addresses of all social media users, stating that absolute anonymity on social media has had its

252
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:08,060
day. Last week, there was a huge controversy, as it was discovered that the NSA was actually spying

253
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:14,300
on Tucker Carlson. There's definitely been a slow boiling the frog on the anonymity issue.

254
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:19,420
Back in 2001, when we had the Patriot Act passed, they were saying they were only going to spy on

255
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:24,220
foreign enemies. By 2013, we had learned that the NSA had spied on Americans, but nobody cared.

256
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:29,100
By 2014, we had learned that the CIA had spied on the US Senate, but they were really sorry about

257
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:33,740
it. By 2017, we had learned that the FBI had spied on Donald Trump while he was president,

258
00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:39,180
but I mean, he's Hitler, so who cares, right? By 2021, we had realized the NSA had spied on

259
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:43,740
US journalists, but it's just Tucker Carlson, so who gives a shit, right? It has been both

260
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:49,580
governments and corporations getting people used to the idea that it's okay if they're spied on,

261
00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:53,900
that it's okay if they don't have a private life, and it seems that people generally don't object

262
00:21:53,900 --> 00:22:01,260
to this until it's their job that's lost, or their friends that shun them, or their speech that's

263
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:05,900
been silenced. Even Anonymous themselves, like the activist group Anonymous, has turned into a

264
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:11,340
fucking joke. As my pal Brick once said before he got banned off Twitter, Anonymous in 2008,

265
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:15,420
we DDoS the Church of Scientology and track down pedophiles. Anonymous in 2020,

266
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:20,620
Twitter, please help us, they're ruining my poll. People for like thousands of years at this point,

267
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:25,580
people have understood the value of being anonymous, of being able to actually say what's

268
00:22:25,580 --> 00:22:31,340
on your mind. Literally speaking truth to power, that is what being anonymous allows for, to have a

269
00:22:31,340 --> 00:22:37,500
place that is private, to have a location where you don't have to be always on, to be able to

270
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:41,820
regroup and then come back to those things that you find politically important in life,

271
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:48,860
with a renewed energy, or with renewed arguments, or new ideas. In this video I have done what in my

272
00:22:48,860 --> 00:22:52,940
opinion is a completely justified overlap between the concept of anonymity and the concept of

273
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:58,140
privacy, because when you take away one you must necessarily take away the other, and that is

274
00:22:58,140 --> 00:23:02,060
absolutely what they're gunning for. They are gunning for not only your ability to be anonymous,

275
00:23:03,020 --> 00:23:09,100
to say things anonymously online, to not get fired over an old take from when you were a child,

276
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:12,540
or a controversial political opinion that you really shouldn't be fired for,

277
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:18,540
but what goes with that is also the ability to live privately, to not live in a glass house.

278
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:24,540
At the same time, as a content creator who has been doxxed, I do kind of understand the objection to

279
00:23:24,540 --> 00:23:29,180
it, right? Let's be honest here, let's give the devil his due. If you're a streamer, especially

280
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:33,260
if you're a lot bigger than me, I understand larger streamers have this to the nth degree,

281
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:38,700
but if you're a streamer or you're a video creator, where everything you do is hate-watched

282
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:43,100
and catalogued, and then put into an archive for like three years, only to be pulled out later by

283
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:48,380
somebody who absolutely fucking wants to destroy you, and that person is completely anonymous,

284
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:53,180
does kind of seem unfair, doesn't it? Yes, it's part of the job, but in the moment when it happens

285
00:23:53,180 --> 00:23:57,260
it does feel unfair. But, because it's generally progressives doing this sort of thing,

286
00:23:58,220 --> 00:24:03,820
and they want anonymity for them and not for you, they see no problems with this. They should be

287
00:24:03,820 --> 00:24:08,540
anonymous, and the creators they harass should absolutely not be. There's no principles here,

288
00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:12,460
there's simply power. So I understand it when a content creator says, hey, you're out here

289
00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:15,820
shitting on me and like hate-watching me and cataloging everything that I do,

290
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:19,340
but you're not going to step to the plate? Like, I understand their position. But at the same time,

291
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:25,580
this is why progressives scream bloody murder when there is a popular, well-known content creator who

292
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:29,900
manages to remain anonymous. And there are some of them. Like, I don't think anyone's doxxed It's

293
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:35,580
a Gundam yet, and people fucking hate him. But forcing everybody to be named is not the answer.

294
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:40,220
In fact, it seems to me like a better answer is forcing everybody to be anonymous.

295
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:44,060
That's why I still like places like 4chan, and to a lesser extent Newgrounds,

296
00:24:44,060 --> 00:24:48,860
they still hold that principle. Now, there are some solutions floating around out there.

297
00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:54,300
One of them is the EU's right to be forgotten. The idea behind the right to be forgotten is

298
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:58,780
that its proponents believe that there should be a right to have private information about

299
00:24:58,780 --> 00:25:02,540
a person removed from the internet. The problem with the right to be forgotten is that it

300
00:25:02,540 --> 00:25:07,740
directly clashes with the right to access of information, the right to education, and yes,

301
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:11,260
the right to speech and the right to freedom of expression, as well as criticism over the

302
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:16,300
possibility of using it to rewrite history or maintain censorship. Of course, there are good

303
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:21,420
reasons to consider such a thing too. Not simply cancel culture or the right to be anonymous,

304
00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:26,460
but also stuff like revenge porn or having absolute falsehoods appear whenever you get

305
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:30,140
your name searched on Google or something. However, the right to be forgotten, especially

306
00:25:30,140 --> 00:25:35,500
how the EU implements it, seems to be a sledgehammer of a tool when the situation

307
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:40,300
probably requires something more like a scalpel. Lilith had this idea that doxing should be a

308
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:44,380
federal crime, it's not free speech to post people's information for malicious purposes.

309
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:48,460
Dankula replied with, I would argue that private administration information about an individual

310
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:52,140
is their private property that can only be shared with their permission. Tech companies that use

311
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:56,220
data as currency would also be seething. That seems to target most of the bad parts of the

312
00:25:56,220 --> 00:26:00,220
equation here without actually infringing on people's right to free speech. I do disagree

313
00:26:00,220 --> 00:26:05,340
with Lilith here though. She says, none of that lol I found your information through extensive digging,

314
00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:09,660
so it's basically public. I get what she's saying, but the problem with this point of view is that

315
00:26:09,660 --> 00:26:13,820
it completely disregards the fact that phone books used to be a thing. Now for those of you zoomers

316
00:26:13,820 --> 00:26:19,260
don't know what a phone book is, back in the day everybody's name, address, and phone number,

317
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:23,820
in your area anyway, your local area, was listed in a phone book. And so if you wanted to look up

318
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:27,980
somebody's number and call them, all you had to do was fill out your phone book. Everyone had one,

319
00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:32,060
they were given away by the city once a year for free with updates and every yearly revision,

320
00:26:32,060 --> 00:26:35,980
and the concept of the phone book has since fallen out of style. Nobody knows what they are anymore,

321
00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:41,100
nobody cares about them, but they are new enough that back during gamergate, back in 2014 when

322
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:45,580
gamergate was happening, and Zoe Quinn was screaming bloody murder about being doxxed by

323
00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:51,340
people, it turns out that her doxxing came from the phone book. Because in 2014 they were on the

324
00:26:51,340 --> 00:26:55,180
way out, but they weren't gone yet. And anyone who lived in her area or her family's area could

325
00:26:55,180 --> 00:27:00,700
simply look her up in the phone book. The argument against doxxing back then was that if you could

326
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:06,140
find it in a phone book, it wasn't doxxing because that was absolutely publicly available information.

327
00:27:06,140 --> 00:27:09,820
And that seems like a good argument even now. There's a difference though. There's no more

328
00:27:09,820 --> 00:27:15,740
phone books. And not only is there no more phone books, people are way crazier nowadays than they

329
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:21,100
were in 2014. Cancel culture was minuscule back then compared to now. But still, Dankula seems

330
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:26,060
to have a good solution here. If we can consider data to be property, and therefore it can only

331
00:27:26,060 --> 00:27:30,940
legally be shared with the person's express permission, then I think that would solve a

332
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:35,500
lot of the problems. But not all of them. There are absolutely some people out there who just

333
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:39,180
don't give a shit. They'll say, you know what, I like Facebook too much, I like Instagram too

334
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:43,660
much, I like TikTok too much, fuck it. You can have all the data, I don't care. Here it is.

335
00:27:43,660 --> 00:27:49,020
I'll gladly sign whatever piece of paper you put in front of me so I can use these fun services.

336
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:52,620
And then when they go out and get fucking cancelled because all their data's out there,

337
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:56,780
it'll be too late. That being said, it's a far better solution than the government forcing

338
00:27:56,780 --> 00:28:02,060
all social media to collect everyone's data and remove anonymity in the process. That sounds

339
00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:06,620
absolutely fucking terrible. I wouldn't mind a world where there's like a set of social media

340
00:28:06,620 --> 00:28:12,380
platforms that are old, archaic, and completely data collection heavy, and then a set of newer

341
00:28:12,380 --> 00:28:15,900
social media platforms that are more anonymized. I'm okay with that. But like I said at the

342
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:20,620
beginning of the video, this is only partially about being anonymous. It is more importantly

343
00:28:20,620 --> 00:28:25,500
about the destruction of the concept of privacy, and what it does to those people who have been

344
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:29,980
affected by it. I mentioned Academic Agent earlier, but there have been many YouTubers

345
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:34,860
and content creators who have had their lives destroyed by hate viewers. And those people,

346
00:28:35,420 --> 00:28:40,700
in order to survive because they're now completely unemployable, they have to rely on basically the

347
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:45,500
charity of their viewers, whether that be through watching ads on YouTube or Twitch or wherever

348
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:50,540
they happen to be putting their stuff, through donations, through subs on Twitch, through super

349
00:28:50,540 --> 00:28:55,340
chats, through Patreon or Subscribestar donations, whatever it is. As more people express wrong

350
00:28:55,340 --> 00:29:00,540
opinions and are cancelled for it, more and more of them turn towards crowdfunding to stay alive.

351
00:29:00,540 --> 00:29:05,500
And then those people who hold the same opinions, but still manage to have an income,

352
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:09,740
and let's assume that they actually care about supporting the YouTubers and content creators

353
00:29:09,740 --> 00:29:13,820
that they like, well now they have to support another one, and another one, and another one.

354
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:20,060
It almost feels like a long war of attrition to slowly destroy those people who are ideologically

355
00:29:20,060 --> 00:29:25,420
opposed to wokeness. If your opposition cannot even provide for themselves and their family,

356
00:29:25,420 --> 00:29:30,620
then one, they're less able to move against you, and two, that is an extra burden on their

357
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:35,420
community for those people who still can support themselves. This is the reality of the culture

358
00:29:35,420 --> 00:29:40,060
war. It's not going to be a bloody conflict or a riot in the streets. Those do happen,

359
00:29:40,060 --> 00:29:49,100
but those are primarily a distraction. The real war is a slow, steady march to destroy all dissent.

360
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:54,220
This is the main reason why alt tech has to survive. Because if it doesn't, there will be

361
00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:59,180
no anonymity. It will be a dystopia where you have no privacy and everything you do is watched.

362
00:29:59,180 --> 00:30:05,260
And every single dumbfuck progressive out there will cheer it on until the day it finally comes

363
00:30:05,260 --> 00:30:09,660
for them. You use the wrong pronoun, you tell the wrong joke, you make the wrong hand gesture,

364
00:30:09,660 --> 00:30:13,900
say the wrong word, wear the wrong clothes, order the wrong food, sing the wrong song.

365
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:18,620
Nobody can keep track of all of their rules, so eventually everyone slips up. And as soon as you

366
00:30:18,620 --> 00:30:22,620
do, you're far right, you're a bigot, you're islamophobic, you're a knuckle dragger, you're

367
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:27,180
hateful, you're white trash, you're a patriarch. All of your previous virtue signaling counts for

368
00:30:27,180 --> 00:30:33,020
nothing. You can never be forgiven. You will always be that person who did that problematic

369
00:30:33,020 --> 00:30:38,300
thing. You'll be unemployable, unlovable, unwanted. You will be exactly like those people that you

370
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:43,660
currently torment. This is the brave new world you've created. Welcome to the purity spiral.

371
00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:47,900
It's a long way down. Hey guys, that's the end of the video, so thanks for watching. What I

372
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:53,340
described here has also unfortunately happened to my roommate. Simply, through his association

373
00:30:53,340 --> 00:30:58,460
with me, he actually lost his job. And until he can get back up on his feet, he's helping me out

374
00:30:58,460 --> 00:31:03,660
with my projects and this channel supporting him too. So, if you're interested in keeping us going,

375
00:31:03,660 --> 00:31:07,740
please consider dropping by our gaming channel. Tomorrow night we're playing the Skyward Sword

376
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:12,060
HD release. We actually have a pretty big event planned for it, so it'll be I think a pretty

377
00:31:12,060 --> 00:31:16,300
fun stream. Thanks very much for your support, and I'll see you there. I love you.
