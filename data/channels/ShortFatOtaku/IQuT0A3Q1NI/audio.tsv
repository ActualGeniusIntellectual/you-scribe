0	12340	Welcome to Plagiarism Tonight, I'm your host, Bobbert Billian.
12340	16260	The horror film reviewer, Count Dracula, is the most recent victim of YouTube's terrible
16260	18340	video takedown policies.
18340	21220	But this time, it may not be YouTube's fault.
21220	24380	Since the implementation of YouTube's new system that automatically obliterates any
24380	28600	video that might potentially have a scrap of fair use content in it, many channels and
28600	34020	videos have been removed for the service, and their creators are beginning to protest.
34020	38900	But Dracula's most recent angry vlog was removed not by YouTube's automated monkeys, but by
38900	42420	the very people Dracula was angry at in the video.
42420	45780	When we reached out to YouTube for comment, a spokesperson said,
45780	49660	Google's YouTube is not an appropriate place to be negative.
49660	53140	For further comment on the subject, you will have to sync your program into our Google
54140	59580	with your Google Plus account that I'm totally sure you commonly use.
59580	64060	In other news, relationships and marriages across the pond are on the rise.
64060	68360	As local love opportunities dwindle, many people in the United States are looking overseas
68360	72420	for romantic partners, with many of them finding happiness in the UK.
72420	76820	But the biggest hurdle in the path of these ocean-crossed lovers is travel.
76820	81980	Recently for a few couples, this has been exacerbated by a group of con men who promised
81980	87140	them the resources to finally live together in the same country as reimbursement for work,
87140	90740	only to have them later refuse to pay.
90740	95580	Interpol has put out a general alert regarding the con men, with an officer saying when you
95580	98140	hire people, you're supposed to pay them.
98140	103200	You can't say stuff like, the work you did was decent but not exceptional, or I don't
103200	105500	have to pay on anyone's terms but my own.
105500	108500	Who do you think you are, Walmart?
108500	111520	Canadian researchers have finally discovered a cure for cancer.
111520	115600	The revolutionary breakthrough comes after doctors performed a series of tests on a man
115600	117140	with cancer in Quebec.
117140	121140	These tests revealed that not working, not paying your bills and shirking your responsibilities
121140	125660	in general have a dramatic effect on cancer cells, reducing their numbers to zero before
125660	127560	the cancer can even take hold.
127560	131720	It also acts as an effective bulwark against the harrowing side effects of chemotherapy,
131720	137560	allowing the man to remain obese and with a full head of hair even as he underwent treatment.
137560	140960	Doctors are prescribing caution to would-be volunteers for further testing of this new
140960	146340	cure though, stating that while lying about everything under the sun may have a dramatic
146340	152640	effect on stage 4 leukemia and stomach cancer, it still makes you a douchebag.
152640	154720	This has been your host, BobboardBillion.
154720	157040	Take a break and plagiarize.
170960	177960	See you next time.
