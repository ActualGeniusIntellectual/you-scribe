Welcome to Plagiarism Tonight, I'm your host, Bobbert Billian.

00:12.340 --> 00:16.260
The horror film reviewer, Count Dracula, is the most recent victim of YouTube's terrible

00:16.260 --> 00:18.340
video takedown policies.

00:18.340 --> 00:21.220
But this time, it may not be YouTube's fault.

00:21.220 --> 00:24.380
Since the implementation of YouTube's new system that automatically obliterates any

00:24.380 --> 00:28.600
video that might potentially have a scrap of fair use content in it, many channels and

00:28.600 --> 00:34.020
videos have been removed for the service, and their creators are beginning to protest.

00:34.020 --> 00:38.900
But Dracula's most recent angry vlog was removed not by YouTube's automated monkeys, but by

00:38.900 --> 00:42.420
the very people Dracula was angry at in the video.

00:42.420 --> 00:45.780
When we reached out to YouTube for comment, a spokesperson said,

00:45.780 --> 00:49.660
Google's YouTube is not an appropriate place to be negative.

00:49.660 --> 00:53.140
For further comment on the subject, you will have to sync your program into our Google

00:54.140 --> 00:59.580
with your Google Plus account that I'm totally sure you commonly use.

00:59.580 --> 01:04.060
In other news, relationships and marriages across the pond are on the rise.

01:04.060 --> 01:08.360
As local love opportunities dwindle, many people in the United States are looking overseas

01:08.360 --> 01:12.420
for romantic partners, with many of them finding happiness in the UK.

01:12.420 --> 01:16.820
But the biggest hurdle in the path of these ocean-crossed lovers is travel.

01:16.820 --> 01:21.980
Recently for a few couples, this has been exacerbated by a group of con men who promised

01:21.980 --> 01:27.140
them the resources to finally live together in the same country as reimbursement for work,

01:27.140 --> 01:30.740
only to have them later refuse to pay.

01:30.740 --> 01:35.580
Interpol has put out a general alert regarding the con men, with an officer saying when you

01:35.580 --> 01:38.140
hire people, you're supposed to pay them.

01:38.140 --> 01:43.200
You can't say stuff like, the work you did was decent but not exceptional, or I don't

01:43.200 --> 01:45.500
have to pay on anyone's terms but my own.

01:45.500 --> 01:48.500
Who do you think you are, Walmart?

01:48.500 --> 01:51.520
Canadian researchers have finally discovered a cure for cancer.

01:51.520 --> 01:55.600
The revolutionary breakthrough comes after doctors performed a series of tests on a man

01:55.600 --> 01:57.140
with cancer in Quebec.

01:57.140 --> 02:01.140
These tests revealed that not working, not paying your bills and shirking your responsibilities

02:01.140 --> 02:05.660
in general have a dramatic effect on cancer cells, reducing their numbers to zero before

02:05.660 --> 02:07.560
the cancer can even take hold.

02:07.560 --> 02:11.720
It also acts as an effective bulwark against the harrowing side effects of chemotherapy,

02:11.720 --> 02:17.560
allowing the man to remain obese and with a full head of hair even as he underwent treatment.

02:17.560 --> 02:20.960
Doctors are prescribing caution to would-be volunteers for further testing of this new

02:20.960 --> 02:26.340
cure though, stating that while lying about everything under the sun may have a dramatic

02:26.340 --> 02:32.640
effect on stage 4 leukemia and stomach cancer, it still makes you a douchebag.

02:32.640 --> 02:34.720
This has been your host, BobboardBillion.

02:34.720 --> 02:37.040
Take a break and plagiarize.

02:50.960 --> 02:57.960
See you next time.
