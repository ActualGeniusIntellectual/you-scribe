Welcome to Plagiarism Tonight, I'm your host, Bobbert Billian.

2
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:16,260
The horror film reviewer, Count Dracula, is the most recent victim of YouTube's terrible

3
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:18,340
video takedown policies.

4
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:21,220
But this time, it may not be YouTube's fault.

5
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:24,380
Since the implementation of YouTube's new system that automatically obliterates any

6
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:28,600
video that might potentially have a scrap of fair use content in it, many channels and

7
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:34,020
videos have been removed for the service, and their creators are beginning to protest.

8
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:38,900
But Dracula's most recent angry vlog was removed not by YouTube's automated monkeys, but by

9
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:42,420
the very people Dracula was angry at in the video.

10
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:45,780
When we reached out to YouTube for comment, a spokesperson said,

11
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:49,660
Google's YouTube is not an appropriate place to be negative.

12
00:00:49,660 --> 00:00:53,140
For further comment on the subject, you will have to sync your program into our Google

13
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:59,580
with your Google Plus account that I'm totally sure you commonly use.

14
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:04,060
In other news, relationships and marriages across the pond are on the rise.

15
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:08,360
As local love opportunities dwindle, many people in the United States are looking overseas

16
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:12,420
for romantic partners, with many of them finding happiness in the UK.

17
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:16,820
But the biggest hurdle in the path of these ocean-crossed lovers is travel.

18
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:21,980
Recently for a few couples, this has been exacerbated by a group of con men who promised

19
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:27,140
them the resources to finally live together in the same country as reimbursement for work,

20
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:30,740
only to have them later refuse to pay.

21
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:35,580
Interpol has put out a general alert regarding the con men, with an officer saying when you

22
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:38,140
hire people, you're supposed to pay them.

23
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:43,200
You can't say stuff like, the work you did was decent but not exceptional, or I don't

24
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,500
have to pay on anyone's terms but my own.

25
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:48,500
Who do you think you are, Walmart?

26
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:51,520
Canadian researchers have finally discovered a cure for cancer.

27
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:55,600
The revolutionary breakthrough comes after doctors performed a series of tests on a man

28
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,140
with cancer in Quebec.

29
00:01:57,140 --> 00:02:01,140
These tests revealed that not working, not paying your bills and shirking your responsibilities

30
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:05,660
in general have a dramatic effect on cancer cells, reducing their numbers to zero before

31
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:07,560
the cancer can even take hold.

32
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:11,720
It also acts as an effective bulwark against the harrowing side effects of chemotherapy,

33
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:17,560
allowing the man to remain obese and with a full head of hair even as he underwent treatment.

34
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:20,960
Doctors are prescribing caution to would-be volunteers for further testing of this new

35
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:26,340
cure though, stating that while lying about everything under the sun may have a dramatic

36
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:32,640
effect on stage 4 leukemia and stomach cancer, it still makes you a douchebag.

37
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,720
This has been your host, BobboardBillion.

38
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:37,040
Take a break and plagiarize.

39
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:57,960
See you next time.
