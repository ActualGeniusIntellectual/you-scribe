00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,360
This video is kind of a follow-up to a previous video, called consent is deontological. Here's

2
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:15,560
the TLDR. Consequentialist ethics are basically good is good ends. Deontological ethics are

3
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:19,480
basically good is good rules. The problem with deontology is that it's not hard to find a

4
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:24,160
situation where a corrupt set of rules causes evil, hence the idea of the pious churchgoer

5
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:28,060
hurting others in the name of God. The problem with consequentialism is it's very easy to justify

6
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:32,300
any sort of evil as long as it's theorized outcome is good, hence the phrase ends justify

7
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:37,540
the means. And in the video I describe how the concept of consent operates on deontological

8
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:41,340
ethics. The basic idea is when you give your consent to another person what you're actually

9
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:46,140
doing is outlining a set of rules almost always informal and unwritten ones but rules nonetheless

10
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:51,500
that you agree to abide by and this works not only for sexual consent but all types of consent.

11
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:57,140
Let's say I tell you I'll meet you at the pub at 7 p.m. that is a rule I give you my word I will

12
00:00:57,140 --> 00:01:01,620
be at a place and time and if I breach it I will have failed morally in some small way given that

13
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:06,140
example but it's still a failure if I arrive at 715 you're justified in being a little annoyed

14
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:10,540
at me even if you are also late then we're both a little bit at fault let's say that you're late

15
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:14,660
because your car got hit on the way over and I'm late because I'm a little bit lazy even though the

16
00:01:14,660 --> 00:01:19,220
outcome is the same that we're both late one of us has a greater moral culpability because it's

17
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:23,580
not only outcomes that matter but intentions as well that's why I made the point in that video

18
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:27,960
that fundamentally socialists don't care about consent and not simply because the socialist

19
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:32,140
community colloquially seems to contain more sex pests on average it's also because socialism

20
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:36,620
contains a disdain for the concept of private contracts or voluntary association or property

21
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:41,260
ownership or if you're dealing with the really progressive ones stuff like monogamous relationships

22
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:46,420
or concepts like prudence or honor socialists view your consent as an obstacle in the way of

23
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:51,460
the socialist project you call it selling out your principles I call it fucking winning and

24
00:01:51,460 --> 00:02:01,420
that's my principle to win as a socialist not to lose as a socialist that's not my principle I

25
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:06,820
don't give a fuck about principled failure haha bringing it back vosh has been pretty good to me

26
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:09,940
with this clip I'm not gonna lie but I've been thinking about this idea a little bit more

27
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:14,780
recently I did that video on Roe v Wade where my position was basically that while I am pro-choice

28
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:19,860
myself the actual ruling of Roe v Wade was a bad way to implement abortion access it wasn't voted

29
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:23,860
on by the people of the United States on either the state or federal level rather it was imposed

30
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:28,780
on the population by the court access to abortion in the USA was gained not by passing legislature

31
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:34,020
but by bypassing the legislative process altogether using pretty shaky judicial reasoning to do so it's

32
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:39,700
not the court's job to spin up whole cloth new quasi legislature like Roe v Wade did it's the

33
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:43,900
court's job to judge whether or not a piece of actually passed legislation violates the

34
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:48,740
Constitution in other words I recognized that Roe v Wade violated the process and I've had a

35
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:52,100
few conversations with left-leaning people I'm friendly with in this topic at this point and the

36
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:57,380
question almost always boils down to the process they asked me why is violating the process so

37
00:02:57,380 --> 00:03:01,700
important to you isn't the outcome good don't you want abortion access to and that's when I realized

38
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:05,540
yeah I do want abortion access I do think the outcome is good or at least unnecessary evil

39
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:10,060
definitely a lesser evil than if abortion were just blanket banned but I also realized the process

40
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:13,780
was important not simply for the sake of the process itself but because the process is the

41
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:18,820
upon which the consequences rest that's why Roe v Wade is falling apart regardless of how you feel

42
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:22,980
about how it was constructed the foundation has always been broken and as I was talking about this

43
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:27,620
with these people I realized that this is the same as the relationship between deontology and

44
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:32,020
consequentialism understanding that the process needs to be followed in order to create a solid

45
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:36,420
justification for the outcome is the same as understanding that you need deontological ethics

46
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:40,660
in order for consequentialist ethics to even make sense I gave the example in that previous video

47
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:45,060
about consent of the consequentialist atheist arguing with the consequentialist isis member

48
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:49,220
over whether or not it's ethical to throw gay people off of rooftops the atheist can appeal

49
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:53,060
to good ends you shouldn't kill people who haven't hurt anybody else being gay isn't bad and the isis

50
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:57,140
member can appeal to his good ends that's degenerate scrubbing society god is happy as sharia is

51
00:03:57,140 --> 00:04:01,460
fulfilled both of these people are calculating out the best ends but what makes their results

52
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:05,940
different is that they each begin with a different deontological rule set the isis member is assuming

53
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:10,340
that killing gays is good a priori while the atheist assuming the opposite and their difference

54
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:14,340
and consequences are just post-hoc rationalizations there's no reason to assume

55
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:18,660
that either of them is objectively correct either there's no scientific consensus here the universe

56
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:22,580
itself doesn't care if the gays are killed or not the atheist might appeal to harm reduction but the

57
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:26,100
isis member will say that he's reducing harm to society the atheist might appeal to something

58
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:30,100
akin to the libertarian's non-aggression principle that the gay person didn't make any aggressive

59
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:34,100
actions toward anybody else simply living in private the isis member well he'll likely

60
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:38,820
actually say that being gay is itself an aggressive action but if he's smart he'll say that valuing

61
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:43,540
self-defense and non-aggression is itself subjective and he's under no obligation to

62
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:48,500
value those things in his calculations it seems like at least to me what is good is what feels

63
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:52,020
good and i don't mean feels good like it's pleasurable and i don't mean anything like that

64
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:57,300
i mean it feels like goodness it feels like it is moral and that's way more of a deontological

65
00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:01,220
statement than a consequentialist one it makes sense then that all consequentialist calculations

66
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:06,660
require a deontological frame that's how you determine what makes good ends good that's why

67
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:10,340
the atheist and the isis member cannot come to the same conclusion despite both being

68
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:14,260
consequentialists if consequentialism is the mathematics telling you how to solve a formula

69
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:18,420
then deontology is the numbers you plug into the formula you're trying to solve they require each

70
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:22,500
other in a way i've also been thinking about the january 6th riots recently the issue with them

71
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:26,660
isn't that they were inherently unethical if the election was actually being stolen by a group of

72
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:31,540
anti-democratic elites then every single thing done on that day and far more would have been

73
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:34,980
entirely justified what else can you do if your vote's being stolen that's why i don't completely

74
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:38,660
blame the rioters they still did it there's still a level of culpability there like i said if you

75
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:41,940
truly believe you're about to lose your government and fall into a dictatorship there's no other

76
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:45,140
option that's why i don't buy some of the stuff that i hear coming out of the broader left right

77
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:49,620
now about how all the rioters were these evil fascist insurrectionists or whatever the issue

78
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:54,500
ultimately is was it actually being stolen i know that a lot of people who watch this channel

79
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:58,180
genuinely believe that it was they believe that the institutions were corrupted the votes were

80
00:05:58,180 --> 00:06:02,100
rigged everybody was deep state agents operating to get rid of trump the whole thing at this point

81
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:06,660
i'm kind of on the fence i think the election was actually probably legit but if decisive evidence

82
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:10,180
dropped tomorrow that it wasn't i wouldn't be surprised for the sake of this conversation

83
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:14,260
though we're assuming that the election was completely valid trump lost fair and square

84
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:19,220
and that trump was not just a bumbling doofus who didn't know how much damage he was causing

85
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:23,780
or an egomaniac who huffed his own copium to the point that he also believed he won and was

86
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:29,300
unjustly being ousted but that trump was actually a budding dictator who knew he had lost and didn't

87
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:34,740
care because he a priori considered his victory to be more important than the vote assume that

88
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:39,060
for this conversation i know it's hard you can do it the democratic process is arguably the most

89
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:43,540
important institution in u.s history trump was fighting tooth and nail to undermine that

90
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:48,260
institution from poisoning the well on mail-in ballots months before the vote to saying to his

91
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:52,580
supporters we gotta march up there take back our country you don't fight like hell you're not gonna

92
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:59,460
have a country anymore we're going to try and give them the kind of pride and boldness that

93
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:04,340
they need to take back our country and admittedly yes also saying we need to peacefully make our

94
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:08,820
voices heard which to be fair is pretty good cover for his rhetoric i know that everyone here will

95
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:15,940
soon be marching over to the capitol building to peacefully and patriotically make your voices

96
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:20,260
heard they're calling up various governors saying you gotta find me more votes all i want to do is

97
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:31,700
this i just want to find uh 11 780 votes which is one more that we have to putting his own vice

98
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:36,820
president on blast when he refused to violate the procedure and crown trump president in other words

99
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:41,380
trump's behaviors and rhetoric tried to undermine the institutions of the united states at multiple

100
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:46,340
points and created an environment where average people believe the only possible redress they

101
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:51,700
had for their grievances if trump didn't win the election was political violence so if we assume

102
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:56,420
that one like i said before trump's actually a budding dictator not a copium huffer or a doofus

103
00:07:56,420 --> 00:08:00,900
and two the institutions of the united states were not actually corrupted and were functioning as

104
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:06,420
intended then trump was acting in an ends justify the means worst case consequentialist scenario the

105
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:10,340
institutions of the united states are a deontological process maybe not in a moral

106
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:14,660
sense but certainly in a bureaucratic one the idea is no matter what the outcome is no matter who

107
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:19,380
wins the election we follow this process we follow these rules and it is the following of

108
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:24,100
these rules that makes that win that outcome legitimate and trump's undermining of public

109
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:29,620
trust in those institutions works to delegitimize those rules that process if it turns out that

110
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:33,220
trump wasn't actually a budding dictator and the institutions were functioning the situation is

111
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:38,180
mostly the same trump is just delusional instead but what if trump's not a budding dictator and

112
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:42,580
the institutions were actually broken like he claimed they were well then we get into that

113
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:47,140
what if the rules are bad critique of the deontological view deontology's great weakness

114
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:52,100
is that there's no easy way to reform the rules you have to rely on examining the ends to see if

115
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:56,660
the rules are fit for purpose which seems to track if evidence came out tomorrow that decisively

116
00:08:56,660 --> 00:09:01,220
proved the election was actually stolen from trump the only proper thing to do would be to screw the

117
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:05,940
rules and give him his second term but even then that's not fully appealing to the ends in a sense

118
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:10,820
the end is trump gets what's rightfully his but it's that rightfully his part that is still an

119
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:15,300
appeal to deontology the process was corrupted but we still appeal to the process as it should

120
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:19,300
have functioned the rules were bad therefore we should have been following these good rules

121
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:22,580
by the way as for what i actually believe at this point i'm pretty sure that trump actually

122
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:25,780
huffed on his own copium too much i don't think he was a dictator with a plan to overthrow the

123
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:29,540
election while knowing full well he had lost it i think he genuinely believes it was stolen from

124
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:33,700
him just like his supporters genuinely believe it he's egotistical and probably delusional but not

125
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:37,860
a fascist one last thing too there's a lot of progressive radicals who are ultra democracy

126
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:41,700
cucked right now and fair enough but they take it way too far they scream about why is the electoral

127
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:45,620
college a thing why is the senate a vote by land and not by people why are judges not voted on why

128
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:50,020
isn't everything at all times voted on by everybody but you know what it's not democracy that gave

129
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:54,340
trump the ultimate pushback i guarantee i would put money on this there are absolutely republican

130
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:59,620
elected officials who inwardly think that trump is fucked up but they don't dare say it publicly

131
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:03,940
because they know that he's electorally popular among the right right now these people are bound

132
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:07,860
not to the truth or the good but to the popular that's the point of democracy and we've seen the

133
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:11,860
inverse too whenever trump did anything good during his presidency every single person on

134
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:16,020
the left bent themselves into fucking knots trying to play it up as evil because that's what was

135
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:20,340
popular for their electorate trump received his hardest pushback from people in appointed

136
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:24,820
positions judges and cabinet members who were aligned with him politically but didn't need to

137
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:30,020
worry about reelection and could investigate his claims with a more unbiased eye that too is

138
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:34,740
ultimately part of the process part of the institution and is deontological in how it

139
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:39,140
functions even william fucking bar trump's attorney general who spent a good chunk of

140
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:43,620
his term with his nose right up trump's asshole came out and said that there was no irregularities

141
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:46,900
in the election that would have changed its outcome he wasn't voted on he was appointed

142
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:50,180
that's not to say that appointed people can't be corrupted in other ways they certainly can

143
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:54,180
but they can't be corrupted by following the fickle whims of an electorate and that's what

144
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:59,380
makes a good process a good deontological code it has different conflicting components that all have

145
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:03,620
different strengths and weaknesses not everything in the u.s government is democratic because it

146
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:08,260
would be entirely at the whims of the weaknesses of democracy but you still need some democracy in

147
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:12,340
there because democracy's strengths cover the weaknesses of a fully appointed system too as i

148
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:16,580
said before trump set it up such that people would feel like their only course of redress if he

149
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:21,380
didn't win was political violence the point of liberal democratic institutions is to increase

150
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:25,940
the amount of space between somebody having a legitimate grievance and somebody resorting to

151
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:31,380
violence to redress that grievance in a liberal society there are many different non-violent ways

152
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:34,900
to redress a grievance you can compromise with people privately to secure a solution

153
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:38,740
you can take them to court you can run for office or vote for candidates who will implement changes

154
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:42,420
that help your situation you can speak out publicly and draw more people to your cause

155
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:47,460
you don't have to resort to violence except in the most extreme circumstances all anti-liberals

156
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:52,180
regardless of political stripe have one big thing in common their desire to reduce the amount of

157
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:56,580
space between having a legitimate grievance and having to resort to violence to solve it

158
00:11:56,580 --> 00:11:59,940
not just trump on the right saying stuff that we got to take our country back but how many

159
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:04,420
leftists have you heard this phrase from i do feel like we engage in very very selective phony

160
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:07,860
outraged political violence depending on how angry we are the people who are advocating for it

161
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:14,340
politics is violence the fact by the way the only i also hate this i hate this um i hate when he

162
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:19,540
um does this shit where he says like um politics is violence like

163
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:28,660
it's such a stupid equivocation okay politics is violence what do you mean by that fosh that's

164
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:32,420
actually an anarchist phrase and both left and right anarchists use it the idea behind it is

165
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:38,020
that all conflict is necessarily violent and the idea of a non-violent conflict is a liberal

166
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:42,740
delusion if i don't like what you're doing i could kill you to make you stop or i could vote with

167
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:46,900
100 other people that you must stop and then if you don't give in to us then we kill you and our

168
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:50,660
killing of you is legitimized because a democratic apparatus did it but it's the same thing in the

169
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:55,940
end when you hear the phrase politics is violence or voting is violence what is being said by the

170
00:12:55,940 --> 00:13:01,220
anarchist is that the result is the same regardless of what process produces the result aka the

171
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:05,300
consequences are the same regardless of what deontological principle leads to them for a person

172
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:09,700
to actually say this though they have to have never experienced real violence yeah it might be

173
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:13,140
the case that you have a great idea for society but the electorate disagrees with you and then

174
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:17,460
they outvote you and then society gets measurably worse as a result that sucks that might even be

175
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:22,340
violence on you because you didn't ask for this worst situation it was imposed on you by their

176
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:27,540
shitty inferior ideas but is it worse violence than them directly killing you i don't think so

177
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:32,260
and i don't think that anybody who's ever experienced true violence in the flesh would

178
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:36,980
ever make that claim there's two competing schools of classical liberal thought one that man is

179
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:42,420
naturally good in its society that makes him evil and two that man is naturally evil in its society

180
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:47,060
that makes him good if the first position were true then dismantling every single institution

181
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:51,380
would lead to a better world but considering the failure of all types of anarchism and our

182
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:55,140
current successes despite all of our problems i don't think that's true if the second position

183
00:13:55,140 --> 00:14:00,180
were true that society's institutions make us good then how do we explain a totalitarian state that

184
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:04,740
grinds down all within it or an oppressive indifferent bureaucracy lost within its own

185
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:09,460
procedures these clearly don't create good people either but these are the bad rules of

186
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:13,060
a failed deontological system that doesn't mean that every deontological system is a failure

187
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:16,980
doesn't mean that good rules can't exist somewhere i don't exactly know where i'm going with this

188
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:20,340
most of this video has been a ramble these are kind of new ideas to me i've been thinking up

189
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:23,300
and frankly i've been gone for a while i needed something to put out it seems like to me a

190
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:27,780
prosperous liberal society is one that is democratic but not too democratic that allows for

191
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:31,620
the individual to override the democratic will in some important matters but not all of them that

192
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:36,660
doesn't chase good ends for the sake of building a utopia but instead grounds those good ends in

193
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:41,620
adhering to good rules and constantly updates what constitutes a good rule by examining what

194
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:47,460
kind of ends they produce a liberal society must simultaneously be deontological and consequentialist

195
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:53,140
it must be democratic but also have areas of life where the democratic will has no say the

196
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:58,180
liberal principles of universal standards and rule of law consent and voluntary action privacy

197
00:14:58,180 --> 00:15:03,140
and individuality these are deontological principles liberal institutions must be

198
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:08,260
deontological because the consequentialism of liberal people is legitimized by that foundation
