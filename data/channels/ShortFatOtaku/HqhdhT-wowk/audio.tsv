0	10360	This video is kind of a follow-up to a previous video, called consent is deontological. Here's
10360	15560	the TLDR. Consequentialist ethics are basically good is good ends. Deontological ethics are
15560	19480	basically good is good rules. The problem with deontology is that it's not hard to find a
19480	24160	situation where a corrupt set of rules causes evil, hence the idea of the pious churchgoer
24160	28060	hurting others in the name of God. The problem with consequentialism is it's very easy to justify
28060	32300	any sort of evil as long as it's theorized outcome is good, hence the phrase ends justify
32300	37540	the means. And in the video I describe how the concept of consent operates on deontological
37540	41340	ethics. The basic idea is when you give your consent to another person what you're actually
41340	46140	doing is outlining a set of rules almost always informal and unwritten ones but rules nonetheless
46140	51500	that you agree to abide by and this works not only for sexual consent but all types of consent.
51500	57140	Let's say I tell you I'll meet you at the pub at 7 p.m. that is a rule I give you my word I will
57140	61620	be at a place and time and if I breach it I will have failed morally in some small way given that
61620	66140	example but it's still a failure if I arrive at 715 you're justified in being a little annoyed
66140	70540	at me even if you are also late then we're both a little bit at fault let's say that you're late
70540	74660	because your car got hit on the way over and I'm late because I'm a little bit lazy even though the
74660	79220	outcome is the same that we're both late one of us has a greater moral culpability because it's
79220	83580	not only outcomes that matter but intentions as well that's why I made the point in that video
83660	87960	that fundamentally socialists don't care about consent and not simply because the socialist
87960	92140	community colloquially seems to contain more sex pests on average it's also because socialism
92140	96620	contains a disdain for the concept of private contracts or voluntary association or property
96620	101260	ownership or if you're dealing with the really progressive ones stuff like monogamous relationships
101260	106420	or concepts like prudence or honor socialists view your consent as an obstacle in the way of
106420	111460	the socialist project you call it selling out your principles I call it fucking winning and
111460	121420	that's my principle to win as a socialist not to lose as a socialist that's not my principle I
121420	126820	don't give a fuck about principled failure haha bringing it back vosh has been pretty good to me
126820	129940	with this clip I'm not gonna lie but I've been thinking about this idea a little bit more
129940	134780	recently I did that video on Roe v Wade where my position was basically that while I am pro-choice
134820	139860	myself the actual ruling of Roe v Wade was a bad way to implement abortion access it wasn't voted
139860	143860	on by the people of the United States on either the state or federal level rather it was imposed
143860	148780	on the population by the court access to abortion in the USA was gained not by passing legislature
148780	154020	but by bypassing the legislative process altogether using pretty shaky judicial reasoning to do so it's
154020	159700	not the court's job to spin up whole cloth new quasi legislature like Roe v Wade did it's the
159700	163900	court's job to judge whether or not a piece of actually passed legislation violates the
163900	168740	Constitution in other words I recognized that Roe v Wade violated the process and I've had a
168740	172100	few conversations with left-leaning people I'm friendly with in this topic at this point and the
172100	177380	question almost always boils down to the process they asked me why is violating the process so
177380	181700	important to you isn't the outcome good don't you want abortion access to and that's when I realized
181700	185540	yeah I do want abortion access I do think the outcome is good or at least unnecessary evil
185540	190060	definitely a lesser evil than if abortion were just blanket banned but I also realized the process
190060	193780	was important not simply for the sake of the process itself but because the process is the
194660	198820	upon which the consequences rest that's why Roe v Wade is falling apart regardless of how you feel
198820	202980	about how it was constructed the foundation has always been broken and as I was talking about this
202980	207620	with these people I realized that this is the same as the relationship between deontology and
207620	212020	consequentialism understanding that the process needs to be followed in order to create a solid
212020	216420	justification for the outcome is the same as understanding that you need deontological ethics
216420	220660	in order for consequentialist ethics to even make sense I gave the example in that previous video
220660	225060	about consent of the consequentialist atheist arguing with the consequentialist isis member
225060	229220	over whether or not it's ethical to throw gay people off of rooftops the atheist can appeal
229220	233060	to good ends you shouldn't kill people who haven't hurt anybody else being gay isn't bad and the isis
233060	237140	member can appeal to his good ends that's degenerate scrubbing society god is happy as sharia is
237140	241460	fulfilled both of these people are calculating out the best ends but what makes their results
241460	245940	different is that they each begin with a different deontological rule set the isis member is assuming
245940	250340	that killing gays is good a priori while the atheist assuming the opposite and their difference
250340	254340	and consequences are just post-hoc rationalizations there's no reason to assume
254340	258660	that either of them is objectively correct either there's no scientific consensus here the universe
258660	262580	itself doesn't care if the gays are killed or not the atheist might appeal to harm reduction but the
262580	266100	isis member will say that he's reducing harm to society the atheist might appeal to something
266100	270100	akin to the libertarian's non-aggression principle that the gay person didn't make any aggressive
270100	274100	actions toward anybody else simply living in private the isis member well he'll likely
274100	278820	actually say that being gay is itself an aggressive action but if he's smart he'll say that valuing
278820	283540	self-defense and non-aggression is itself subjective and he's under no obligation to
283540	288500	value those things in his calculations it seems like at least to me what is good is what feels
288500	292020	good and i don't mean feels good like it's pleasurable and i don't mean anything like that
292020	297300	i mean it feels like goodness it feels like it is moral and that's way more of a deontological
297300	301220	statement than a consequentialist one it makes sense then that all consequentialist calculations
301220	306660	require a deontological frame that's how you determine what makes good ends good that's why
306660	310340	the atheist and the isis member cannot come to the same conclusion despite both being
310340	314260	consequentialists if consequentialism is the mathematics telling you how to solve a formula
314260	318420	then deontology is the numbers you plug into the formula you're trying to solve they require each
318420	322500	other in a way i've also been thinking about the january 6th riots recently the issue with them
322500	326660	isn't that they were inherently unethical if the election was actually being stolen by a group of
326660	331540	anti-democratic elites then every single thing done on that day and far more would have been
331540	334980	entirely justified what else can you do if your vote's being stolen that's why i don't completely
334980	338660	blame the rioters they still did it there's still a level of culpability there like i said if you
338660	341940	truly believe you're about to lose your government and fall into a dictatorship there's no other
341940	345140	option that's why i don't buy some of the stuff that i hear coming out of the broader left right
345140	349620	now about how all the rioters were these evil fascist insurrectionists or whatever the issue
349620	354500	ultimately is was it actually being stolen i know that a lot of people who watch this channel
354500	358180	genuinely believe that it was they believe that the institutions were corrupted the votes were
358180	362100	rigged everybody was deep state agents operating to get rid of trump the whole thing at this point
362100	366660	i'm kind of on the fence i think the election was actually probably legit but if decisive evidence
366660	370180	dropped tomorrow that it wasn't i wouldn't be surprised for the sake of this conversation
370180	374260	though we're assuming that the election was completely valid trump lost fair and square
374260	379220	and that trump was not just a bumbling doofus who didn't know how much damage he was causing
379220	383780	or an egomaniac who huffed his own copium to the point that he also believed he won and was
383780	389300	unjustly being ousted but that trump was actually a budding dictator who knew he had lost and didn't
389300	394740	care because he a priori considered his victory to be more important than the vote assume that
394740	399060	for this conversation i know it's hard you can do it the democratic process is arguably the most
399060	403540	important institution in u.s history trump was fighting tooth and nail to undermine that
403540	408260	institution from poisoning the well on mail-in ballots months before the vote to saying to his
408260	412580	supporters we gotta march up there take back our country you don't fight like hell you're not gonna
412580	419460	have a country anymore we're going to try and give them the kind of pride and boldness that
419460	424340	they need to take back our country and admittedly yes also saying we need to peacefully make our
424340	428820	voices heard which to be fair is pretty good cover for his rhetoric i know that everyone here will
428820	435940	soon be marching over to the capitol building to peacefully and patriotically make your voices
435940	440260	heard they're calling up various governors saying you gotta find me more votes all i want to do is
440260	451700	this i just want to find uh 11 780 votes which is one more that we have to putting his own vice
451700	456820	president on blast when he refused to violate the procedure and crown trump president in other words
456820	461380	trump's behaviors and rhetoric tried to undermine the institutions of the united states at multiple
461380	466340	points and created an environment where average people believe the only possible redress they
466340	471700	had for their grievances if trump didn't win the election was political violence so if we assume
471700	476420	that one like i said before trump's actually a budding dictator not a copium huffer or a doofus
476420	480900	and two the institutions of the united states were not actually corrupted and were functioning as
480900	486420	intended then trump was acting in an ends justify the means worst case consequentialist scenario the
486420	490340	institutions of the united states are a deontological process maybe not in a moral
490340	494660	sense but certainly in a bureaucratic one the idea is no matter what the outcome is no matter who
494660	499380	wins the election we follow this process we follow these rules and it is the following of
499380	504100	these rules that makes that win that outcome legitimate and trump's undermining of public
504100	509620	trust in those institutions works to delegitimize those rules that process if it turns out that
509620	513220	trump wasn't actually a budding dictator and the institutions were functioning the situation is
513220	518180	mostly the same trump is just delusional instead but what if trump's not a budding dictator and
518180	522580	the institutions were actually broken like he claimed they were well then we get into that
522580	527140	what if the rules are bad critique of the deontological view deontology's great weakness
527140	532100	is that there's no easy way to reform the rules you have to rely on examining the ends to see if
532100	536660	the rules are fit for purpose which seems to track if evidence came out tomorrow that decisively
536660	541220	proved the election was actually stolen from trump the only proper thing to do would be to screw the
541220	545940	rules and give him his second term but even then that's not fully appealing to the ends in a sense
545940	550820	the end is trump gets what's rightfully his but it's that rightfully his part that is still an
550820	555300	appeal to deontology the process was corrupted but we still appeal to the process as it should
555300	559300	have functioned the rules were bad therefore we should have been following these good rules
559300	562580	by the way as for what i actually believe at this point i'm pretty sure that trump actually
562580	565780	huffed on his own copium too much i don't think he was a dictator with a plan to overthrow the
565780	569540	election while knowing full well he had lost it i think he genuinely believes it was stolen from
569540	573700	him just like his supporters genuinely believe it he's egotistical and probably delusional but not
573700	577860	a fascist one last thing too there's a lot of progressive radicals who are ultra democracy
577860	581700	cucked right now and fair enough but they take it way too far they scream about why is the electoral
581700	585620	college a thing why is the senate a vote by land and not by people why are judges not voted on why
585620	590020	isn't everything at all times voted on by everybody but you know what it's not democracy that gave
590020	594340	trump the ultimate pushback i guarantee i would put money on this there are absolutely republican
594340	599620	elected officials who inwardly think that trump is fucked up but they don't dare say it publicly
599620	603940	because they know that he's electorally popular among the right right now these people are bound
603940	607860	not to the truth or the good but to the popular that's the point of democracy and we've seen the
607860	611860	inverse too whenever trump did anything good during his presidency every single person on
611860	616020	the left bent themselves into fucking knots trying to play it up as evil because that's what was
616020	620340	popular for their electorate trump received his hardest pushback from people in appointed
620340	624820	positions judges and cabinet members who were aligned with him politically but didn't need to
624820	630020	worry about reelection and could investigate his claims with a more unbiased eye that too is
630020	634740	ultimately part of the process part of the institution and is deontological in how it
634740	639140	functions even william fucking bar trump's attorney general who spent a good chunk of
639140	643620	his term with his nose right up trump's asshole came out and said that there was no irregularities
643620	646900	in the election that would have changed its outcome he wasn't voted on he was appointed
646900	650180	that's not to say that appointed people can't be corrupted in other ways they certainly can
650180	654180	but they can't be corrupted by following the fickle whims of an electorate and that's what
654180	659380	makes a good process a good deontological code it has different conflicting components that all have
659380	663620	different strengths and weaknesses not everything in the u.s government is democratic because it
663620	668260	would be entirely at the whims of the weaknesses of democracy but you still need some democracy in
668260	672340	there because democracy's strengths cover the weaknesses of a fully appointed system too as i
672340	676580	said before trump set it up such that people would feel like their only course of redress if he
676580	681380	didn't win was political violence the point of liberal democratic institutions is to increase
681380	685940	the amount of space between somebody having a legitimate grievance and somebody resorting to
685940	691380	violence to redress that grievance in a liberal society there are many different non-violent ways
691380	694900	to redress a grievance you can compromise with people privately to secure a solution
694900	698740	you can take them to court you can run for office or vote for candidates who will implement changes
698740	702420	that help your situation you can speak out publicly and draw more people to your cause
702420	707460	you don't have to resort to violence except in the most extreme circumstances all anti-liberals
707460	712180	regardless of political stripe have one big thing in common their desire to reduce the amount of
712180	716580	space between having a legitimate grievance and having to resort to violence to solve it
716580	719940	not just trump on the right saying stuff that we got to take our country back but how many
719940	724420	leftists have you heard this phrase from i do feel like we engage in very very selective phony
724420	727860	outraged political violence depending on how angry we are the people who are advocating for it
727860	734340	politics is violence the fact by the way the only i also hate this i hate this um i hate when he
734340	739540	um does this shit where he says like um politics is violence like
742980	748660	it's such a stupid equivocation okay politics is violence what do you mean by that fosh that's
748660	752420	actually an anarchist phrase and both left and right anarchists use it the idea behind it is
752420	758020	that all conflict is necessarily violent and the idea of a non-violent conflict is a liberal
758020	762740	delusion if i don't like what you're doing i could kill you to make you stop or i could vote with
762740	766900	100 other people that you must stop and then if you don't give in to us then we kill you and our
766900	770660	killing of you is legitimized because a democratic apparatus did it but it's the same thing in the
770660	775940	end when you hear the phrase politics is violence or voting is violence what is being said by the
775940	781220	anarchist is that the result is the same regardless of what process produces the result aka the
781220	785300	consequences are the same regardless of what deontological principle leads to them for a person
785300	789700	to actually say this though they have to have never experienced real violence yeah it might be
789700	793140	the case that you have a great idea for society but the electorate disagrees with you and then
793140	797460	they outvote you and then society gets measurably worse as a result that sucks that might even be
797460	802340	violence on you because you didn't ask for this worst situation it was imposed on you by their
802340	807540	shitty inferior ideas but is it worse violence than them directly killing you i don't think so
807540	812260	and i don't think that anybody who's ever experienced true violence in the flesh would
812260	816980	ever make that claim there's two competing schools of classical liberal thought one that man is
816980	822420	naturally good in its society that makes him evil and two that man is naturally evil in its society
822420	827060	that makes him good if the first position were true then dismantling every single institution
827060	831380	would lead to a better world but considering the failure of all types of anarchism and our
831380	835140	current successes despite all of our problems i don't think that's true if the second position
835140	840180	were true that society's institutions make us good then how do we explain a totalitarian state that
840180	844740	grinds down all within it or an oppressive indifferent bureaucracy lost within its own
844740	849460	procedures these clearly don't create good people either but these are the bad rules of
849460	853060	a failed deontological system that doesn't mean that every deontological system is a failure
853060	856980	doesn't mean that good rules can't exist somewhere i don't exactly know where i'm going with this
856980	860340	most of this video has been a ramble these are kind of new ideas to me i've been thinking up
860340	863300	and frankly i've been gone for a while i needed something to put out it seems like to me a
863300	867780	prosperous liberal society is one that is democratic but not too democratic that allows for
867780	871620	the individual to override the democratic will in some important matters but not all of them that
871620	876660	doesn't chase good ends for the sake of building a utopia but instead grounds those good ends in
876660	881620	adhering to good rules and constantly updates what constitutes a good rule by examining what
881620	887460	kind of ends they produce a liberal society must simultaneously be deontological and consequentialist
887460	893140	it must be democratic but also have areas of life where the democratic will has no say the
893140	898180	liberal principles of universal standards and rule of law consent and voluntary action privacy
898180	903140	and individuality these are deontological principles liberal institutions must be
903140	908260	deontological because the consequentialism of liberal people is legitimized by that foundation
