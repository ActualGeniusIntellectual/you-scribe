00:00.000 --> 00:10.360
This video is kind of a follow-up to a previous video, called consent is deontological. Here's

00:10.360 --> 00:15.560
the TLDR. Consequentialist ethics are basically good is good ends. Deontological ethics are

00:15.560 --> 00:19.480
basically good is good rules. The problem with deontology is that it's not hard to find a

00:19.480 --> 00:24.160
situation where a corrupt set of rules causes evil, hence the idea of the pious churchgoer

00:24.160 --> 00:28.060
hurting others in the name of God. The problem with consequentialism is it's very easy to justify

00:28.060 --> 00:32.300
any sort of evil as long as it's theorized outcome is good, hence the phrase ends justify

00:32.300 --> 00:37.540
the means. And in the video I describe how the concept of consent operates on deontological

00:37.540 --> 00:41.340
ethics. The basic idea is when you give your consent to another person what you're actually

00:41.340 --> 00:46.140
doing is outlining a set of rules almost always informal and unwritten ones but rules nonetheless

00:46.140 --> 00:51.500
that you agree to abide by and this works not only for sexual consent but all types of consent.

00:51.500 --> 00:57.140
Let's say I tell you I'll meet you at the pub at 7 p.m. that is a rule I give you my word I will

00:57.140 --> 01:01.620
be at a place and time and if I breach it I will have failed morally in some small way given that

01:01.620 --> 01:06.140
example but it's still a failure if I arrive at 715 you're justified in being a little annoyed

01:06.140 --> 01:10.540
at me even if you are also late then we're both a little bit at fault let's say that you're late

01:10.540 --> 01:14.660
because your car got hit on the way over and I'm late because I'm a little bit lazy even though the

01:14.660 --> 01:19.220
outcome is the same that we're both late one of us has a greater moral culpability because it's

01:19.220 --> 01:23.580
not only outcomes that matter but intentions as well that's why I made the point in that video

01:23.660 --> 01:27.960
that fundamentally socialists don't care about consent and not simply because the socialist

01:27.960 --> 01:32.140
community colloquially seems to contain more sex pests on average it's also because socialism

01:32.140 --> 01:36.620
contains a disdain for the concept of private contracts or voluntary association or property

01:36.620 --> 01:41.260
ownership or if you're dealing with the really progressive ones stuff like monogamous relationships

01:41.260 --> 01:46.420
or concepts like prudence or honor socialists view your consent as an obstacle in the way of

01:46.420 --> 01:51.460
the socialist project you call it selling out your principles I call it fucking winning and

01:51.460 --> 02:01.420
that's my principle to win as a socialist not to lose as a socialist that's not my principle I

02:01.420 --> 02:06.820
don't give a fuck about principled failure haha bringing it back vosh has been pretty good to me

02:06.820 --> 02:09.940
with this clip I'm not gonna lie but I've been thinking about this idea a little bit more

02:09.940 --> 02:14.780
recently I did that video on Roe v Wade where my position was basically that while I am pro-choice

02:14.820 --> 02:19.860
myself the actual ruling of Roe v Wade was a bad way to implement abortion access it wasn't voted

02:19.860 --> 02:23.860
on by the people of the United States on either the state or federal level rather it was imposed

02:23.860 --> 02:28.780
on the population by the court access to abortion in the USA was gained not by passing legislature

02:28.780 --> 02:34.020
but by bypassing the legislative process altogether using pretty shaky judicial reasoning to do so it's

02:34.020 --> 02:39.700
not the court's job to spin up whole cloth new quasi legislature like Roe v Wade did it's the

02:39.700 --> 02:43.900
court's job to judge whether or not a piece of actually passed legislation violates the

02:43.900 --> 02:48.740
Constitution in other words I recognized that Roe v Wade violated the process and I've had a

02:48.740 --> 02:52.100
few conversations with left-leaning people I'm friendly with in this topic at this point and the

02:52.100 --> 02:57.380
question almost always boils down to the process they asked me why is violating the process so

02:57.380 --> 03:01.700
important to you isn't the outcome good don't you want abortion access to and that's when I realized

03:01.700 --> 03:05.540
yeah I do want abortion access I do think the outcome is good or at least unnecessary evil

03:05.540 --> 03:10.060
definitely a lesser evil than if abortion were just blanket banned but I also realized the process

03:10.060 --> 03:13.780
was important not simply for the sake of the process itself but because the process is the

03:14.660 --> 03:18.820
upon which the consequences rest that's why Roe v Wade is falling apart regardless of how you feel

03:18.820 --> 03:22.980
about how it was constructed the foundation has always been broken and as I was talking about this

03:22.980 --> 03:27.620
with these people I realized that this is the same as the relationship between deontology and

03:27.620 --> 03:32.020
consequentialism understanding that the process needs to be followed in order to create a solid

03:32.020 --> 03:36.420
justification for the outcome is the same as understanding that you need deontological ethics

03:36.420 --> 03:40.660
in order for consequentialist ethics to even make sense I gave the example in that previous video

03:40.660 --> 03:45.060
about consent of the consequentialist atheist arguing with the consequentialist isis member

03:45.060 --> 03:49.220
over whether or not it's ethical to throw gay people off of rooftops the atheist can appeal

03:49.220 --> 03:53.060
to good ends you shouldn't kill people who haven't hurt anybody else being gay isn't bad and the isis

03:53.060 --> 03:57.140
member can appeal to his good ends that's degenerate scrubbing society god is happy as sharia is

03:57.140 --> 04:01.460
fulfilled both of these people are calculating out the best ends but what makes their results

04:01.460 --> 04:05.940
different is that they each begin with a different deontological rule set the isis member is assuming

04:05.940 --> 04:10.340
that killing gays is good a priori while the atheist assuming the opposite and their difference

04:10.340 --> 04:14.340
and consequences are just post-hoc rationalizations there's no reason to assume

04:14.340 --> 04:18.660
that either of them is objectively correct either there's no scientific consensus here the universe

04:18.660 --> 04:22.580
itself doesn't care if the gays are killed or not the atheist might appeal to harm reduction but the

04:22.580 --> 04:26.100
isis member will say that he's reducing harm to society the atheist might appeal to something

04:26.100 --> 04:30.100
akin to the libertarian's non-aggression principle that the gay person didn't make any aggressive

04:30.100 --> 04:34.100
actions toward anybody else simply living in private the isis member well he'll likely

04:34.100 --> 04:38.820
actually say that being gay is itself an aggressive action but if he's smart he'll say that valuing

04:38.820 --> 04:43.540
self-defense and non-aggression is itself subjective and he's under no obligation to

04:43.540 --> 04:48.500
value those things in his calculations it seems like at least to me what is good is what feels

04:48.500 --> 04:52.020
good and i don't mean feels good like it's pleasurable and i don't mean anything like that

04:52.020 --> 04:57.300
i mean it feels like goodness it feels like it is moral and that's way more of a deontological

04:57.300 --> 05:01.220
statement than a consequentialist one it makes sense then that all consequentialist calculations

05:01.220 --> 05:06.660
require a deontological frame that's how you determine what makes good ends good that's why

05:06.660 --> 05:10.340
the atheist and the isis member cannot come to the same conclusion despite both being

05:10.340 --> 05:14.260
consequentialists if consequentialism is the mathematics telling you how to solve a formula

05:14.260 --> 05:18.420
then deontology is the numbers you plug into the formula you're trying to solve they require each

05:18.420 --> 05:22.500
other in a way i've also been thinking about the january 6th riots recently the issue with them

05:22.500 --> 05:26.660
isn't that they were inherently unethical if the election was actually being stolen by a group of

05:26.660 --> 05:31.540
anti-democratic elites then every single thing done on that day and far more would have been

05:31.540 --> 05:34.980
entirely justified what else can you do if your vote's being stolen that's why i don't completely

05:34.980 --> 05:38.660
blame the rioters they still did it there's still a level of culpability there like i said if you

05:38.660 --> 05:41.940
truly believe you're about to lose your government and fall into a dictatorship there's no other

05:41.940 --> 05:45.140
option that's why i don't buy some of the stuff that i hear coming out of the broader left right

05:45.140 --> 05:49.620
now about how all the rioters were these evil fascist insurrectionists or whatever the issue

05:49.620 --> 05:54.500
ultimately is was it actually being stolen i know that a lot of people who watch this channel

05:54.500 --> 05:58.180
genuinely believe that it was they believe that the institutions were corrupted the votes were

05:58.180 --> 06:02.100
rigged everybody was deep state agents operating to get rid of trump the whole thing at this point

06:02.100 --> 06:06.660
i'm kind of on the fence i think the election was actually probably legit but if decisive evidence

06:06.660 --> 06:10.180
dropped tomorrow that it wasn't i wouldn't be surprised for the sake of this conversation

06:10.180 --> 06:14.260
though we're assuming that the election was completely valid trump lost fair and square

06:14.260 --> 06:19.220
and that trump was not just a bumbling doofus who didn't know how much damage he was causing

06:19.220 --> 06:23.780
or an egomaniac who huffed his own copium to the point that he also believed he won and was

06:23.780 --> 06:29.300
unjustly being ousted but that trump was actually a budding dictator who knew he had lost and didn't

06:29.300 --> 06:34.740
care because he a priori considered his victory to be more important than the vote assume that

06:34.740 --> 06:39.060
for this conversation i know it's hard you can do it the democratic process is arguably the most

06:39.060 --> 06:43.540
important institution in u.s history trump was fighting tooth and nail to undermine that

06:43.540 --> 06:48.260
institution from poisoning the well on mail-in ballots months before the vote to saying to his

06:48.260 --> 06:52.580
supporters we gotta march up there take back our country you don't fight like hell you're not gonna

06:52.580 --> 06:59.460
have a country anymore we're going to try and give them the kind of pride and boldness that

06:59.460 --> 07:04.340
they need to take back our country and admittedly yes also saying we need to peacefully make our

07:04.340 --> 07:08.820
voices heard which to be fair is pretty good cover for his rhetoric i know that everyone here will

07:08.820 --> 07:15.940
soon be marching over to the capitol building to peacefully and patriotically make your voices

07:15.940 --> 07:20.260
heard they're calling up various governors saying you gotta find me more votes all i want to do is

07:20.260 --> 07:31.700
this i just want to find uh 11 780 votes which is one more that we have to putting his own vice

07:31.700 --> 07:36.820
president on blast when he refused to violate the procedure and crown trump president in other words

07:36.820 --> 07:41.380
trump's behaviors and rhetoric tried to undermine the institutions of the united states at multiple

07:41.380 --> 07:46.340
points and created an environment where average people believe the only possible redress they

07:46.340 --> 07:51.700
had for their grievances if trump didn't win the election was political violence so if we assume

07:51.700 --> 07:56.420
that one like i said before trump's actually a budding dictator not a copium huffer or a doofus

07:56.420 --> 08:00.900
and two the institutions of the united states were not actually corrupted and were functioning as

08:00.900 --> 08:06.420
intended then trump was acting in an ends justify the means worst case consequentialist scenario the

08:06.420 --> 08:10.340
institutions of the united states are a deontological process maybe not in a moral

08:10.340 --> 08:14.660
sense but certainly in a bureaucratic one the idea is no matter what the outcome is no matter who

08:14.660 --> 08:19.380
wins the election we follow this process we follow these rules and it is the following of

08:19.380 --> 08:24.100
these rules that makes that win that outcome legitimate and trump's undermining of public

08:24.100 --> 08:29.620
trust in those institutions works to delegitimize those rules that process if it turns out that

08:29.620 --> 08:33.220
trump wasn't actually a budding dictator and the institutions were functioning the situation is

08:33.220 --> 08:38.180
mostly the same trump is just delusional instead but what if trump's not a budding dictator and

08:38.180 --> 08:42.580
the institutions were actually broken like he claimed they were well then we get into that

08:42.580 --> 08:47.140
what if the rules are bad critique of the deontological view deontology's great weakness

08:47.140 --> 08:52.100
is that there's no easy way to reform the rules you have to rely on examining the ends to see if

08:52.100 --> 08:56.660
the rules are fit for purpose which seems to track if evidence came out tomorrow that decisively

08:56.660 --> 09:01.220
proved the election was actually stolen from trump the only proper thing to do would be to screw the

09:01.220 --> 09:05.940
rules and give him his second term but even then that's not fully appealing to the ends in a sense

09:05.940 --> 09:10.820
the end is trump gets what's rightfully his but it's that rightfully his part that is still an

09:10.820 --> 09:15.300
appeal to deontology the process was corrupted but we still appeal to the process as it should

09:15.300 --> 09:19.300
have functioned the rules were bad therefore we should have been following these good rules

09:19.300 --> 09:22.580
by the way as for what i actually believe at this point i'm pretty sure that trump actually

09:22.580 --> 09:25.780
huffed on his own copium too much i don't think he was a dictator with a plan to overthrow the

09:25.780 --> 09:29.540
election while knowing full well he had lost it i think he genuinely believes it was stolen from

09:29.540 --> 09:33.700
him just like his supporters genuinely believe it he's egotistical and probably delusional but not

09:33.700 --> 09:37.860
a fascist one last thing too there's a lot of progressive radicals who are ultra democracy

09:37.860 --> 09:41.700
cucked right now and fair enough but they take it way too far they scream about why is the electoral

09:41.700 --> 09:45.620
college a thing why is the senate a vote by land and not by people why are judges not voted on why

09:45.620 --> 09:50.020
isn't everything at all times voted on by everybody but you know what it's not democracy that gave

09:50.020 --> 09:54.340
trump the ultimate pushback i guarantee i would put money on this there are absolutely republican

09:54.340 --> 09:59.620
elected officials who inwardly think that trump is fucked up but they don't dare say it publicly

09:59.620 --> 10:03.940
because they know that he's electorally popular among the right right now these people are bound

10:03.940 --> 10:07.860
not to the truth or the good but to the popular that's the point of democracy and we've seen the

10:07.860 --> 10:11.860
inverse too whenever trump did anything good during his presidency every single person on

10:11.860 --> 10:16.020
the left bent themselves into fucking knots trying to play it up as evil because that's what was

10:16.020 --> 10:20.340
popular for their electorate trump received his hardest pushback from people in appointed

10:20.340 --> 10:24.820
positions judges and cabinet members who were aligned with him politically but didn't need to

10:24.820 --> 10:30.020
worry about reelection and could investigate his claims with a more unbiased eye that too is

10:30.020 --> 10:34.740
ultimately part of the process part of the institution and is deontological in how it

10:34.740 --> 10:39.140
functions even william fucking bar trump's attorney general who spent a good chunk of

10:39.140 --> 10:43.620
his term with his nose right up trump's asshole came out and said that there was no irregularities

10:43.620 --> 10:46.900
in the election that would have changed its outcome he wasn't voted on he was appointed

10:46.900 --> 10:50.180
that's not to say that appointed people can't be corrupted in other ways they certainly can

10:50.180 --> 10:54.180
but they can't be corrupted by following the fickle whims of an electorate and that's what

10:54.180 --> 10:59.380
makes a good process a good deontological code it has different conflicting components that all have

10:59.380 --> 11:03.620
different strengths and weaknesses not everything in the u.s government is democratic because it

11:03.620 --> 11:08.260
would be entirely at the whims of the weaknesses of democracy but you still need some democracy in

11:08.260 --> 11:12.340
there because democracy's strengths cover the weaknesses of a fully appointed system too as i

11:12.340 --> 11:16.580
said before trump set it up such that people would feel like their only course of redress if he

11:16.580 --> 11:21.380
didn't win was political violence the point of liberal democratic institutions is to increase

11:21.380 --> 11:25.940
the amount of space between somebody having a legitimate grievance and somebody resorting to

11:25.940 --> 11:31.380
violence to redress that grievance in a liberal society there are many different non-violent ways

11:31.380 --> 11:34.900
to redress a grievance you can compromise with people privately to secure a solution

11:34.900 --> 11:38.740
you can take them to court you can run for office or vote for candidates who will implement changes

11:38.740 --> 11:42.420
that help your situation you can speak out publicly and draw more people to your cause

11:42.420 --> 11:47.460
you don't have to resort to violence except in the most extreme circumstances all anti-liberals

11:47.460 --> 11:52.180
regardless of political stripe have one big thing in common their desire to reduce the amount of

11:52.180 --> 11:56.580
space between having a legitimate grievance and having to resort to violence to solve it

11:56.580 --> 11:59.940
not just trump on the right saying stuff that we got to take our country back but how many

11:59.940 --> 12:04.420
leftists have you heard this phrase from i do feel like we engage in very very selective phony

12:04.420 --> 12:07.860
outraged political violence depending on how angry we are the people who are advocating for it

12:07.860 --> 12:14.340
politics is violence the fact by the way the only i also hate this i hate this um i hate when he

12:14.340 --> 12:19.540
um does this shit where he says like um politics is violence like

12:22.980 --> 12:28.660
it's such a stupid equivocation okay politics is violence what do you mean by that fosh that's

12:28.660 --> 12:32.420
actually an anarchist phrase and both left and right anarchists use it the idea behind it is

12:32.420 --> 12:38.020
that all conflict is necessarily violent and the idea of a non-violent conflict is a liberal

12:38.020 --> 12:42.740
delusion if i don't like what you're doing i could kill you to make you stop or i could vote with

12:42.740 --> 12:46.900
100 other people that you must stop and then if you don't give in to us then we kill you and our

12:46.900 --> 12:50.660
killing of you is legitimized because a democratic apparatus did it but it's the same thing in the

12:50.660 --> 12:55.940
end when you hear the phrase politics is violence or voting is violence what is being said by the

12:55.940 --> 13:01.220
anarchist is that the result is the same regardless of what process produces the result aka the

13:01.220 --> 13:05.300
consequences are the same regardless of what deontological principle leads to them for a person

13:05.300 --> 13:09.700
to actually say this though they have to have never experienced real violence yeah it might be

13:09.700 --> 13:13.140
the case that you have a great idea for society but the electorate disagrees with you and then

13:13.140 --> 13:17.460
they outvote you and then society gets measurably worse as a result that sucks that might even be

13:17.460 --> 13:22.340
violence on you because you didn't ask for this worst situation it was imposed on you by their

13:22.340 --> 13:27.540
shitty inferior ideas but is it worse violence than them directly killing you i don't think so

13:27.540 --> 13:32.260
and i don't think that anybody who's ever experienced true violence in the flesh would

13:32.260 --> 13:36.980
ever make that claim there's two competing schools of classical liberal thought one that man is

13:36.980 --> 13:42.420
naturally good in its society that makes him evil and two that man is naturally evil in its society

13:42.420 --> 13:47.060
that makes him good if the first position were true then dismantling every single institution

13:47.060 --> 13:51.380
would lead to a better world but considering the failure of all types of anarchism and our

13:51.380 --> 13:55.140
current successes despite all of our problems i don't think that's true if the second position

13:55.140 --> 14:00.180
were true that society's institutions make us good then how do we explain a totalitarian state that

14:00.180 --> 14:04.740
grinds down all within it or an oppressive indifferent bureaucracy lost within its own

14:04.740 --> 14:09.460
procedures these clearly don't create good people either but these are the bad rules of

14:09.460 --> 14:13.060
a failed deontological system that doesn't mean that every deontological system is a failure

14:13.060 --> 14:16.980
doesn't mean that good rules can't exist somewhere i don't exactly know where i'm going with this

14:16.980 --> 14:20.340
most of this video has been a ramble these are kind of new ideas to me i've been thinking up

14:20.340 --> 14:23.300
and frankly i've been gone for a while i needed something to put out it seems like to me a

14:23.300 --> 14:27.780
prosperous liberal society is one that is democratic but not too democratic that allows for

14:27.780 --> 14:31.620
the individual to override the democratic will in some important matters but not all of them that

14:31.620 --> 14:36.660
doesn't chase good ends for the sake of building a utopia but instead grounds those good ends in

14:36.660 --> 14:41.620
adhering to good rules and constantly updates what constitutes a good rule by examining what

14:41.620 --> 14:47.460
kind of ends they produce a liberal society must simultaneously be deontological and consequentialist

14:47.460 --> 14:53.140
it must be democratic but also have areas of life where the democratic will has no say the

14:53.140 --> 14:58.180
liberal principles of universal standards and rule of law consent and voluntary action privacy

14:58.180 --> 15:03.140
and individuality these are deontological principles liberal institutions must be

15:03.140 --> 15:08.260
deontological because the consequentialism of liberal people is legitimized by that foundation
