0	2800	Hey guys, Dev here. I'm just going to do a quick little vlog.
2800	10120	When Dave went off to work today, he found an Amazon package and this would be the package
10120	14480	outside the door. And he was really excited about it, so he came to get me, but he couldn't
14480	18240	actually stick around to open it up with me. And then I immediately started ripping it
18240	21640	open and I realized, you know what, I should probably actually do a little video on this,
21640	28120	if only because, well, you guys made this possible. This is about 250 bucks worth of
28120	35280	sound equipment, which we got the money from, this time from ad revenue. Not from Patreon.
35280	40320	Patreon is going towards something else, but this time this is from our ad revenue from
40320	46520	YouTube over the past little while. So thanks a lot for watching, if you watch without ad
46520	52000	blocker. And if you watch with ad blocker, that's totally fine too, but thanks. For all
52000	55520	you guys who watch, thanks. We couldn't do this without you.
55920	68200	So the first thing we got was the Zenix Q1202 USB audio mixer by Behringer. And the main
68200	73960	reason we picked up this is because we're going to use it to vastly increase our sound
73960	79320	quality of all of our videos. It'll work for the Let's Plays, the anime reviews, vlogs,
79320	85000	gamergate stuff. It'll do something for everything. Let's just kind of take a look here. Like
85000	92000	I said, I jumped the gun and I started opening it up a little bit. We have here standard
92000	99200	USB. This is where the sound kind of comes out of the device and into your computer.
99200	106320	Standard power cable, nothing too special about it. And here's the thing itself. I'm
106320	120120	just going to open this up. There it is in the packaging. Let me just pull it off and
120120	128120	kind of look at it. This is normally on for about 200 Canadian. We picked it up for about
128120	133920	130 Canadian because Amazon was having a special. And here it is all outside of the packaging.
133920	139680	It did contain one of those little containers of candy that you should always feed your
139680	148400	children but not today. The actual device itself is pretty sturdy. It's some pretty
148400	153840	good plastic, some pretty good metal on it. I'll get this box away. It's kind of confusing
153840	163160	actually. But it seems like it's very solidly built. And that's always a plus. Just because
163200	167280	there's always some objects that you buy and you spend a lot of money on them and they
167280	179840	fall apart right away. But here it is. Now there is an instruction manual so I'm sure
179840	185280	we'll go over the details of what each of these functions does. But basically you plug
185280	192080	your microphones in up there. You can adjust levels, adjust audio quality. You can do effects,
192080	201000	various things. And then on the back it all outputs by USB to your computer. And then
201000	206040	you record it with Audacity or some other program. So if you have a large number of
206040	212400	people speaking at once you'd want a board like this. Or if you have only one person
212400	216920	and you want to do an effect or increase the audio quality you would also use this board.
216920	221760	As you can see there's a number of different types of connectors. You can plug in all different
221760	229480	types of mics. A bunch of different knobbies that I have no clue what they'll do yet. But
229480	237440	I mean we'll figure it out right? But basically this will have the biggest impact on the Let's
237440	244680	Plays. This camera that I'm using right now has a shotgun mic on the top of it. And usually
244680	251120	what happens is because we cannot cut out the TV volume from the shotgun mic picking
251120	257320	up our speaking, what will end up happening is that the camera audio track will have the
257320	264240	TV game stuff and then our speaking. And that's what we end up using. And some people have
264240	267960	noticed the game audio quality is kind of low because it's coming out of the TV and
267960	273320	back into the camera. Our only real solution for this was to pick up a bunch of mics, have
273320	279720	them wired through a panel like this, and then kind of attach the mics to our shirts.
280520	284400	In that situation only our voices would be picked up and then we could use the higher
284400	290560	quality audio from the game capture. And we needed technology like this to be able to
290560	296560	do that. And now we have it. So that's great. The second thing we got today were these lavalier
296560	300560	microphones to go with it. Now we are going to need adapters for these mics to make it
300560	304360	work with this panel but the adapters are cheap. They're like $2 a piece. We got three
304360	309640	of these mics. Now these are two in the box here. We were hoping to get four because usually
309640	315380	we would use four on the Let's Plays at maximum but only three of them were on sale. So when
315380	319480	the fourth, we're not in a rush, when the fourth one comes on sale we'll buy the fourth
319480	324880	one. Let's take a quick look at these. They're from Audio Technica which is the same company
324880	330800	that we use for this mic which is our AT2020 which is a very good mic. It's lasted five
330800	335600	years now and it's still going strong. These ran us at 30 bucks a pop so that ends up being
335600	341820	around 90. And these honestly are only going to help with the Let's Plays. We'll use the
341820	347280	panel with other microphones for the gamergate stuff and for the anime review stuff. These
347280	353760	are our Let's Play only thing. They are a lower end lavalier mic but I did see a video
353760	359080	online showing off their quality and they're good for what we need. We don't need to spend
359080	365720	100 bucks a person, at least just yet. This thing, this is actually a mic that's primarily
365720	371160	made to be used on cell phones so this thing is basically for that. It's like a cell phone
371160	376120	connector. Everything else here, the clip attaches it to your shirt, there's the mic,
376120	379860	there's the windsock if you want to use it, there's the power thing and there's the battery.
379860	386360	So it all really is standard stuff. The sound quality on it, from what I could tell was
386360	392720	very good, at least for the price of 30 bucks. You can't ask for more than that. And with
392720	398600	three of these, Dave and I will use one each during the Let's Plays and when we do Skyward
398600	403400	Sword again with Cabbage we'll have three of them going. And then we'll just have to
403400	409360	get by using our old method for any kind of four player game until we get the fourth mic.
410240	416920	So yeah, all in all this stash of stuff ran us about 250 bucks, probably another 30 for
416920	423280	a fourth mic. We're going to have to buy some replacement batteries because these, they're
423280	429240	not common, you can't just go into a hardware store and just pick them up like a watch battery,
429240	434220	they're a different size. So we'll probably need to buy some spares of those. And we will
434220	439380	need to buy the cheap connectors that allow us to plug these mics into this board. But
439380	445260	here's the great thing about it, is that these mics are cheap, but they'll do. If we ever
445260	451400	get big, these can be easily replaced, but this board will work with everything. And
451400	455900	this really is the more expensive piece. So like, if a few years down the road we have
455900	462900	enough money and enough of a demand to actually get like really good mics, like $100 mics,
463540	466980	these can be easily replaced because they're kind of cheapos, but the new mics will work
466980	471980	with this thing too, which is great. So we do have the ability to expand and upgrade,
471980	478420	and these will work as long as I just buy that little adapter because this is a standard
478420	485420	computer mic size for the jack here. Meanwhile, those jacks over there are for the next size
487060	491860	up, but it's completely compatible. All you got to do is just buy the thing and stick
491860	495100	it in. So it's going to be great. I don't know when you'll actually see this stuff in
495100	500980	use, but I'm sure we'll make a big hullabaloo about it on the show. So yeah, thanks to everyone
500980	506980	who watches, thanks to everyone who watches without adblock, who donates to Patreon, who
506980	512180	donates to Paypal, everything, you're all great. And I know some of you are probably
512180	519180	looking for the gamergate video, I know, I know. It's coming, trust me. There's just...
519180	523540	I'm not involved in the digging process, but apparently Camera Lady will pull a thread
523540	528460	in digging and then find more stuff and they want to get back at it. So I mean, you'll
528460	531660	see it, we haven't given up. But yeah, thanks everyone, and see you next time.
