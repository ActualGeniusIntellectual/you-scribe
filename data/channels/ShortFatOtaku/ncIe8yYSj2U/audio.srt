00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,800
Hey guys, Dev here. I'm just going to do a quick little vlog.

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:10,120
When Dave went off to work today, he found an Amazon package and this would be the package

3
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:14,480
outside the door. And he was really excited about it, so he came to get me, but he couldn't

4
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:18,240
actually stick around to open it up with me. And then I immediately started ripping it

5
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:21,640
open and I realized, you know what, I should probably actually do a little video on this,

6
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:28,120
if only because, well, you guys made this possible. This is about 250 bucks worth of

7
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:35,280
sound equipment, which we got the money from, this time from ad revenue. Not from Patreon.

8
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:40,320
Patreon is going towards something else, but this time this is from our ad revenue from

9
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:46,520
YouTube over the past little while. So thanks a lot for watching, if you watch without ad

10
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:52,000
blocker. And if you watch with ad blocker, that's totally fine too, but thanks. For all

11
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,520
you guys who watch, thanks. We couldn't do this without you.

12
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:08,200
So the first thing we got was the Zenix Q1202 USB audio mixer by Behringer. And the main

13
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:13,960
reason we picked up this is because we're going to use it to vastly increase our sound

14
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:19,320
quality of all of our videos. It'll work for the Let's Plays, the anime reviews, vlogs,

15
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:25,000
gamergate stuff. It'll do something for everything. Let's just kind of take a look here. Like

16
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I said, I jumped the gun and I started opening it up a little bit. We have here standard

17
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:39,200
USB. This is where the sound kind of comes out of the device and into your computer.

18
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:46,320
Standard power cable, nothing too special about it. And here's the thing itself. I'm

19
00:01:46,320 --> 00:02:00,120
just going to open this up. There it is in the packaging. Let me just pull it off and

20
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:08,120
kind of look at it. This is normally on for about 200 Canadian. We picked it up for about

21
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:13,920
130 Canadian because Amazon was having a special. And here it is all outside of the packaging.

22
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:19,680
It did contain one of those little containers of candy that you should always feed your

23
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:28,400
children but not today. The actual device itself is pretty sturdy. It's some pretty

24
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:33,840
good plastic, some pretty good metal on it. I'll get this box away. It's kind of confusing

25
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:43,160
actually. But it seems like it's very solidly built. And that's always a plus. Just because

26
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:47,280
there's always some objects that you buy and you spend a lot of money on them and they

27
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:59,840
fall apart right away. But here it is. Now there is an instruction manual so I'm sure

28
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:05,280
we'll go over the details of what each of these functions does. But basically you plug

29
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:12,080
your microphones in up there. You can adjust levels, adjust audio quality. You can do effects,

30
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:21,000
various things. And then on the back it all outputs by USB to your computer. And then

31
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:26,040
you record it with Audacity or some other program. So if you have a large number of

32
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:32,400
people speaking at once you'd want a board like this. Or if you have only one person

33
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:36,920
and you want to do an effect or increase the audio quality you would also use this board.

34
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:41,760
As you can see there's a number of different types of connectors. You can plug in all different

35
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:49,480
types of mics. A bunch of different knobbies that I have no clue what they'll do yet. But

36
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:57,440
I mean we'll figure it out right? But basically this will have the biggest impact on the Let's

37
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:04,680
Plays. This camera that I'm using right now has a shotgun mic on the top of it. And usually

38
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:11,120
what happens is because we cannot cut out the TV volume from the shotgun mic picking

39
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:17,320
up our speaking, what will end up happening is that the camera audio track will have the

40
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:24,240
TV game stuff and then our speaking. And that's what we end up using. And some people have

41
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:27,960
noticed the game audio quality is kind of low because it's coming out of the TV and

42
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:33,320
back into the camera. Our only real solution for this was to pick up a bunch of mics, have

43
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:39,720
them wired through a panel like this, and then kind of attach the mics to our shirts.

44
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:44,400
In that situation only our voices would be picked up and then we could use the higher

45
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:50,560
quality audio from the game capture. And we needed technology like this to be able to

46
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:56,560
do that. And now we have it. So that's great. The second thing we got today were these lavalier

47
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:00,560
microphones to go with it. Now we are going to need adapters for these mics to make it

48
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:04,360
work with this panel but the adapters are cheap. They're like $2 a piece. We got three

49
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:09,640
of these mics. Now these are two in the box here. We were hoping to get four because usually

50
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:15,380
we would use four on the Let's Plays at maximum but only three of them were on sale. So when

51
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:19,480
the fourth, we're not in a rush, when the fourth one comes on sale we'll buy the fourth

52
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:24,880
one. Let's take a quick look at these. They're from Audio Technica which is the same company

53
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:30,800
that we use for this mic which is our AT2020 which is a very good mic. It's lasted five

54
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:35,600
years now and it's still going strong. These ran us at 30 bucks a pop so that ends up being

55
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:41,820
around 90. And these honestly are only going to help with the Let's Plays. We'll use the

56
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:47,280
panel with other microphones for the gamergate stuff and for the anime review stuff. These

57
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:53,760
are our Let's Play only thing. They are a lower end lavalier mic but I did see a video

58
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:59,080
online showing off their quality and they're good for what we need. We don't need to spend

59
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:05,720
100 bucks a person, at least just yet. This thing, this is actually a mic that's primarily

60
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:11,160
made to be used on cell phones so this thing is basically for that. It's like a cell phone

61
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:16,120
connector. Everything else here, the clip attaches it to your shirt, there's the mic,

62
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:19,860
there's the windsock if you want to use it, there's the power thing and there's the battery.

63
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:26,360
So it all really is standard stuff. The sound quality on it, from what I could tell was

64
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:32,720
very good, at least for the price of 30 bucks. You can't ask for more than that. And with

65
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:38,600
three of these, Dave and I will use one each during the Let's Plays and when we do Skyward

66
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:43,400
Sword again with Cabbage we'll have three of them going. And then we'll just have to

67
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:49,360
get by using our old method for any kind of four player game until we get the fourth mic.

68
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:56,920
So yeah, all in all this stash of stuff ran us about 250 bucks, probably another 30 for

69
00:06:56,920 --> 00:07:03,280
a fourth mic. We're going to have to buy some replacement batteries because these, they're

70
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:09,240
not common, you can't just go into a hardware store and just pick them up like a watch battery,

71
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:14,220
they're a different size. So we'll probably need to buy some spares of those. And we will

72
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:19,380
need to buy the cheap connectors that allow us to plug these mics into this board. But

73
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:25,260
here's the great thing about it, is that these mics are cheap, but they'll do. If we ever

74
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:31,400
get big, these can be easily replaced, but this board will work with everything. And

75
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:35,900
this really is the more expensive piece. So like, if a few years down the road we have

76
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:42,900
enough money and enough of a demand to actually get like really good mics, like $100 mics,

77
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:46,980
these can be easily replaced because they're kind of cheapos, but the new mics will work

78
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:51,980
with this thing too, which is great. So we do have the ability to expand and upgrade,

79
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:58,420
and these will work as long as I just buy that little adapter because this is a standard

80
00:07:58,420 --> 00:08:05,420
computer mic size for the jack here. Meanwhile, those jacks over there are for the next size

81
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:11,860
up, but it's completely compatible. All you got to do is just buy the thing and stick

82
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:15,100
it in. So it's going to be great. I don't know when you'll actually see this stuff in

83
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:20,980
use, but I'm sure we'll make a big hullabaloo about it on the show. So yeah, thanks to everyone

84
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:26,980
who watches, thanks to everyone who watches without adblock, who donates to Patreon, who

85
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:32,180
donates to Paypal, everything, you're all great. And I know some of you are probably

86
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:39,180
looking for the gamergate video, I know, I know. It's coming, trust me. There's just...

87
00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:43,540
I'm not involved in the digging process, but apparently Camera Lady will pull a thread

88
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:48,460
in digging and then find more stuff and they want to get back at it. So I mean, you'll

89
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:51,660
see it, we haven't given up. But yeah, thanks everyone, and see you next time.
