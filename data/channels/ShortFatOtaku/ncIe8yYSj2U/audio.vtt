00:00.000 --> 00:02.800
Hey guys, Dev here. I'm just going to do a quick little vlog.

00:02.800 --> 00:10.120
When Dave went off to work today, he found an Amazon package and this would be the package

00:10.120 --> 00:14.480
outside the door. And he was really excited about it, so he came to get me, but he couldn't

00:14.480 --> 00:18.240
actually stick around to open it up with me. And then I immediately started ripping it

00:18.240 --> 00:21.640
open and I realized, you know what, I should probably actually do a little video on this,

00:21.640 --> 00:28.120
if only because, well, you guys made this possible. This is about 250 bucks worth of

00:28.120 --> 00:35.280
sound equipment, which we got the money from, this time from ad revenue. Not from Patreon.

00:35.280 --> 00:40.320
Patreon is going towards something else, but this time this is from our ad revenue from

00:40.320 --> 00:46.520
YouTube over the past little while. So thanks a lot for watching, if you watch without ad

00:46.520 --> 00:52.000
blocker. And if you watch with ad blocker, that's totally fine too, but thanks. For all

00:52.000 --> 00:55.520
you guys who watch, thanks. We couldn't do this without you.

00:55.920 --> 01:08.200
So the first thing we got was the Zenix Q1202 USB audio mixer by Behringer. And the main

01:08.200 --> 01:13.960
reason we picked up this is because we're going to use it to vastly increase our sound

01:13.960 --> 01:19.320
quality of all of our videos. It'll work for the Let's Plays, the anime reviews, vlogs,

01:19.320 --> 01:25.000
gamergate stuff. It'll do something for everything. Let's just kind of take a look here. Like

01:25.000 --> 01:32.000
I said, I jumped the gun and I started opening it up a little bit. We have here standard

01:32.000 --> 01:39.200
USB. This is where the sound kind of comes out of the device and into your computer.

01:39.200 --> 01:46.320
Standard power cable, nothing too special about it. And here's the thing itself. I'm

01:46.320 --> 02:00.120
just going to open this up. There it is in the packaging. Let me just pull it off and

02:00.120 --> 02:08.120
kind of look at it. This is normally on for about 200 Canadian. We picked it up for about

02:08.120 --> 02:13.920
130 Canadian because Amazon was having a special. And here it is all outside of the packaging.

02:13.920 --> 02:19.680
It did contain one of those little containers of candy that you should always feed your

02:19.680 --> 02:28.400
children but not today. The actual device itself is pretty sturdy. It's some pretty

02:28.400 --> 02:33.840
good plastic, some pretty good metal on it. I'll get this box away. It's kind of confusing

02:33.840 --> 02:43.160
actually. But it seems like it's very solidly built. And that's always a plus. Just because

02:43.200 --> 02:47.280
there's always some objects that you buy and you spend a lot of money on them and they

02:47.280 --> 02:59.840
fall apart right away. But here it is. Now there is an instruction manual so I'm sure

02:59.840 --> 03:05.280
we'll go over the details of what each of these functions does. But basically you plug

03:05.280 --> 03:12.080
your microphones in up there. You can adjust levels, adjust audio quality. You can do effects,

03:12.080 --> 03:21.000
various things. And then on the back it all outputs by USB to your computer. And then

03:21.000 --> 03:26.040
you record it with Audacity or some other program. So if you have a large number of

03:26.040 --> 03:32.400
people speaking at once you'd want a board like this. Or if you have only one person

03:32.400 --> 03:36.920
and you want to do an effect or increase the audio quality you would also use this board.

03:36.920 --> 03:41.760
As you can see there's a number of different types of connectors. You can plug in all different

03:41.760 --> 03:49.480
types of mics. A bunch of different knobbies that I have no clue what they'll do yet. But

03:49.480 --> 03:57.440
I mean we'll figure it out right? But basically this will have the biggest impact on the Let's

03:57.440 --> 04:04.680
Plays. This camera that I'm using right now has a shotgun mic on the top of it. And usually

04:04.680 --> 04:11.120
what happens is because we cannot cut out the TV volume from the shotgun mic picking

04:11.120 --> 04:17.320
up our speaking, what will end up happening is that the camera audio track will have the

04:17.320 --> 04:24.240
TV game stuff and then our speaking. And that's what we end up using. And some people have

04:24.240 --> 04:27.960
noticed the game audio quality is kind of low because it's coming out of the TV and

04:27.960 --> 04:33.320
back into the camera. Our only real solution for this was to pick up a bunch of mics, have

04:33.320 --> 04:39.720
them wired through a panel like this, and then kind of attach the mics to our shirts.

04:40.520 --> 04:44.400
In that situation only our voices would be picked up and then we could use the higher

04:44.400 --> 04:50.560
quality audio from the game capture. And we needed technology like this to be able to

04:50.560 --> 04:56.560
do that. And now we have it. So that's great. The second thing we got today were these lavalier

04:56.560 --> 05:00.560
microphones to go with it. Now we are going to need adapters for these mics to make it

05:00.560 --> 05:04.360
work with this panel but the adapters are cheap. They're like $2 a piece. We got three

05:04.360 --> 05:09.640
of these mics. Now these are two in the box here. We were hoping to get four because usually

05:09.640 --> 05:15.380
we would use four on the Let's Plays at maximum but only three of them were on sale. So when

05:15.380 --> 05:19.480
the fourth, we're not in a rush, when the fourth one comes on sale we'll buy the fourth

05:19.480 --> 05:24.880
one. Let's take a quick look at these. They're from Audio Technica which is the same company

05:24.880 --> 05:30.800
that we use for this mic which is our AT2020 which is a very good mic. It's lasted five

05:30.800 --> 05:35.600
years now and it's still going strong. These ran us at 30 bucks a pop so that ends up being

05:35.600 --> 05:41.820
around 90. And these honestly are only going to help with the Let's Plays. We'll use the

05:41.820 --> 05:47.280
panel with other microphones for the gamergate stuff and for the anime review stuff. These

05:47.280 --> 05:53.760
are our Let's Play only thing. They are a lower end lavalier mic but I did see a video

05:53.760 --> 05:59.080
online showing off their quality and they're good for what we need. We don't need to spend

05:59.080 --> 06:05.720
100 bucks a person, at least just yet. This thing, this is actually a mic that's primarily

06:05.720 --> 06:11.160
made to be used on cell phones so this thing is basically for that. It's like a cell phone

06:11.160 --> 06:16.120
connector. Everything else here, the clip attaches it to your shirt, there's the mic,

06:16.120 --> 06:19.860
there's the windsock if you want to use it, there's the power thing and there's the battery.

06:19.860 --> 06:26.360
So it all really is standard stuff. The sound quality on it, from what I could tell was

06:26.360 --> 06:32.720
very good, at least for the price of 30 bucks. You can't ask for more than that. And with

06:32.720 --> 06:38.600
three of these, Dave and I will use one each during the Let's Plays and when we do Skyward

06:38.600 --> 06:43.400
Sword again with Cabbage we'll have three of them going. And then we'll just have to

06:43.400 --> 06:49.360
get by using our old method for any kind of four player game until we get the fourth mic.

06:50.240 --> 06:56.920
So yeah, all in all this stash of stuff ran us about 250 bucks, probably another 30 for

06:56.920 --> 07:03.280
a fourth mic. We're going to have to buy some replacement batteries because these, they're

07:03.280 --> 07:09.240
not common, you can't just go into a hardware store and just pick them up like a watch battery,

07:09.240 --> 07:14.220
they're a different size. So we'll probably need to buy some spares of those. And we will

07:14.220 --> 07:19.380
need to buy the cheap connectors that allow us to plug these mics into this board. But

07:19.380 --> 07:25.260
here's the great thing about it, is that these mics are cheap, but they'll do. If we ever

07:25.260 --> 07:31.400
get big, these can be easily replaced, but this board will work with everything. And

07:31.400 --> 07:35.900
this really is the more expensive piece. So like, if a few years down the road we have

07:35.900 --> 07:42.900
enough money and enough of a demand to actually get like really good mics, like $100 mics,

07:43.540 --> 07:46.980
these can be easily replaced because they're kind of cheapos, but the new mics will work

07:46.980 --> 07:51.980
with this thing too, which is great. So we do have the ability to expand and upgrade,

07:51.980 --> 07:58.420
and these will work as long as I just buy that little adapter because this is a standard

07:58.420 --> 08:05.420
computer mic size for the jack here. Meanwhile, those jacks over there are for the next size

08:07.060 --> 08:11.860
up, but it's completely compatible. All you got to do is just buy the thing and stick

08:11.860 --> 08:15.100
it in. So it's going to be great. I don't know when you'll actually see this stuff in

08:15.100 --> 08:20.980
use, but I'm sure we'll make a big hullabaloo about it on the show. So yeah, thanks to everyone

08:20.980 --> 08:26.980
who watches, thanks to everyone who watches without adblock, who donates to Patreon, who

08:26.980 --> 08:32.180
donates to Paypal, everything, you're all great. And I know some of you are probably

08:32.180 --> 08:39.180
looking for the gamergate video, I know, I know. It's coming, trust me. There's just...

08:39.180 --> 08:43.540
I'm not involved in the digging process, but apparently Camera Lady will pull a thread

08:43.540 --> 08:48.460
in digging and then find more stuff and they want to get back at it. So I mean, you'll

08:48.460 --> 08:51.660
see it, we haven't given up. But yeah, thanks everyone, and see you next time.
