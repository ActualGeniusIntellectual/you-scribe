1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,540
Every three months or so, I'll peek back at my Kiwi Farms thread, just to see what's

2
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:10,540
going on.

3
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:12,860
And it's usually a whole lot of nothing, because I'm a pretty boring guy.

4
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:16,580
One person even did the Gotta Hand It To Him thing, which hey, I can appreciate.

5
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:19,300
But there's one bit there that got the ol' wheels turning.

6
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:20,380
Check out this interaction.

7
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:24,100
I feel like this dude exists solely to argue with his own fanbase at this point.

8
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:28,080
The funny thing is, in the past he has had videos where his opinion was fairly unpopular.

9
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:30,800
His fanbase argued, but it was never this vitriolic.

10
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:33,160
At this point, he seems to outright hate his fans.

11
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:36,200
It's the end of the journey for the Le Superior Centrist Grift.

12
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:38,840
Sooner than later, his new audience will overlap with Vosch.

13
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:42,520
It's what happened to Adam and Sitch, geez, tell me you don't watch Adam and Sitch without

14
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:43,520
telling me.

15
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:47,680
They might do too many Vosch reactions for my taste, yeah, but I'm not sure Vosch's

16
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:50,960
audience are all going to be watching dudes who spend half of their total upload time

17
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:52,280
making fun of Vosch.

18
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:56,440
I feel like he's regretting staying on the Centrist Grift for this long, and didn't

19
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:59,480
become a breadtuber a few years back when the pickings were good.

20
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:00,480
Well, no.

21
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:03,400
I didn't become a breadtuber for one reason, I'm not a socialist.

22
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:04,400
Simple as that.

23
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:07,140
But the important bit is the fighting with my audience stuff.

24
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:09,320
That has happened a lot recently, eh?

25
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:13,200
Yesterday's Sip, showing how libs of TikTok were factually incorrect with one of their

26
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,980
claims, that got some people pretty angry in the chat, frankly, irrationally.

27
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:19,420
Or when Lilith and I covered the Mar-a-Lago raid.

28
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:21,840
Or when Lilith and I talked to Richie, the detransitioner.

29
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,480
Or that Purity Spiral video.

30
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:26,960
In total, there may have been a dozen times that my audience has vehemently disagreed

31
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:31,000
with me so far this year, to the point that we openly argue in the chat or the comments.

32
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
And you know what?

33
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
That's okay by me.

34
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,960
I don't actually hate you guys, even when we have very strong disagreements.

35
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:36,960
I'm not spoonie.

36
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:39,720
I may say you're wrong, I might even call you dumb, but I don't hate you.

37
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:41,800
I don't want you to leave and never come back.

38
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:45,160
But I'm also not going to say anything I don't think is true, just to keep you around

39
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:46,160
either.

40
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:49,200
At the end of the day, I do value my integrity more than being successful.

41
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,720
This video isn't actually about the Kiwi Farms thing, by the way, they just got the

42
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:52,720
noggin joggin.

43
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:55,720
They'll say a YouTuber is going downhill because whenever they reply to criticism in

44
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:58,980
the comments, they're just coping and seething, and they clearly hate their audience.

45
00:01:58,980 --> 00:02:02,440
But they'll also say that a YouTuber is a grifter who says only what their audience

46
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:04,600
wants to hear in order to avoid losing them.

47
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:06,680
And you can't be both of those things at the same time.

48
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:07,680
But you know what?

49
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:08,680
It's Kiwi Farms.

50
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:09,680
They're here for the entertainment.

51
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:12,280
Like from the comedy video, whatever makes the joke funnier without precedence.

52
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:14,520
It doesn't need to be consistent, only funny.

53
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:15,520
I can appreciate that.

54
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:18,480
No, they just got me thinking about the concept of audience capture.

55
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:21,920
I'm not talking about how to capture your audience, like how to be charismatic and hold

56
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:22,920
a crowd's attention.

57
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:25,960
I'm also not talking about a captured audience, where the audience is forced to listen to

58
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:26,960
a creator.

59
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:30,080
It's actually kind of the inverse, where the creator is forced to speak to an audience.

60
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,920
The term was first coined, I think, by Eric Weinstein.

61
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:36,640
The idea is that a content creator attracts an audience that doesn't quite align with

62
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:37,640
his own views.

63
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:41,760
So in order to keep that audience happy, friendly, and coming back for more content, the content

64
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:44,820
creator's own views has to shift towards their audience.

65
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:48,800
If the audience's views also shift, this can turn into a negative feedback loop, where

66
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:52,960
a content creator is incentivized to continuously produce more extremist content in order to

67
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:55,400
keep an ever-radicalizing audience watching.

68
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:58,880
And most of the time, the content creator also ends up radicalizing themselves.

69
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:03,640
Weinstein described what he does to try and avoid audience capture in a July 2021 appearance

70
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:04,640
on Rebel Wisdom.

71
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:07,800
That I may have introduced the concept of audience capture because I've been worrying

72
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:11,200
about the same thing from the beginning.

73
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:15,400
You know, I think I've counseled many people that you have to put poisonous tweets for

74
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:21,160
the people who follow you who you wish would not follow you, you know, you have to make

75
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:27,840
sure in some sense that they understand that you're not there to flatter them.

76
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:31,640
And he's been doing this as far back as 2016, when he said, I try to keep an open mind with

77
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:35,200
those who disagree with me, but any chance I get to shed followers with incurable hate

78
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,680
in their hearts is welcome.

79
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:38,480
And here's the same attitude in 2021.

80
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:43,360
I periodically intentionally shed clusters of followers to avoid what I years ago termed

81
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,480
audience capture.

82
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:48,760
By tweeting fair points that I know unreasonable people will not abide, whoever's left is usually

83
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:49,760
fair minded.

84
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:52,900
I'm now worried I'm losing followers due to a purge though.

85
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:56,480
That last sentence doesn't mean that he is okay with audience capture, by the way.

86
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:00,880
He later says, I highly recommend shedding those who attempt to steer you off the cliff.

87
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:02,400
It's well worth the losses.

88
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:05,480
We have many examples of those who have been lost to audience capture.

89
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:07,920
The most high profile one is probably Jordan Peterson.

90
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:12,340
I did the tubcast a little bit ago with Lilith and Taftage on his Ellen Elliott page rant

91
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:14,440
where he seemed genuinely unhinged.

92
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:19,260
This is a far cry from the educated, articulate 2015 era Jordan Peterson back when he was

93
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:20,840
uploading university lectures.

94
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:23,940
Where he was once intelligent, now he seems rather dumbed down.

95
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:28,400
Where he was once inquiring and skeptical, now he seems close minded and conspiratorial.

96
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,560
Look at his interviews too.

97
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:33,620
Where he once destroyed Kathy Newman, now he sounds a bit whacked out talking to Kyle

98
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:34,620
Kalinsky.

99
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:38,560
And while it may be his responsibility to not become a nutter, I don't fully blame him

100
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,560
either.

101
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:40,640
Look at what Jordan Peterson's gone through.

102
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:43,200
A benzo addiction, a wife who almost died to cancer.

103
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:46,780
The near destruction of his career, constant vilification wherever he goes.

104
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:50,720
From a political camp that, a decade ago, none of us thought were even capable of doing.

105
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:53,800
There's that comic where the leftist pushes the centrist into the rightist camp and the

106
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:56,960
rightist guy picks him up and the leftist guy is like, oh, all the centrists are just

107
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,040
on the right in the end.

108
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,840
That actually happens to a lot of people.

109
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:04,200
Audience capture isn't just how your viewers fluff you, it's how your haters hate you too.

110
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:09,160
It might be dumb to let yourself be controlled by contrarianism, but it's also very common.

111
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:12,200
Almost to the point that it's unreasonable to expect your average person to overcome

112
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,200
it.

113
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:15,080
Who is going to stay loyal to a tribe that hates them?

114
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:18,780
With these two feedback loops in play, how a creator and their audience radicalize each

115
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:22,460
other, and how a creator and his haters repel each other, we can see the mechanisms that

116
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:24,560
push at least some people to the right.

117
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:27,360
In fact, I think we all identified them during gamergate even.

118
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:31,400
Most gamers back then were edgy kids, yeah, but they still generally believed in the basic

119
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:35,720
liberal center-left principles, and the common sentiment felt in the community at that time

120
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:40,280
– I should know, I was there – was disbelief that the game journos, who were all self-proclaimed

121
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:44,800
leftists themselves and openly virtue signaled about their commitment to honesty and integrity,

122
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:48,660
had stabbed their own readers in the back when it came to uncovering the corruption

123
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:49,660
among their own.

124
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:53,200
I'm not surprised whatsoever that a lot of the old gamergate and skeptic people eventually

125
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:57,200
drifted away from the left, and if that event wasn't its primary cause, it was certainly

126
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,200
the first step.

127
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:02,000
But it's not just those guys, it's people like Majid Nawaz, who started off by funding

128
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,400
a counter-terrorism think tank and advocating on behalf of ex-Muslims.

129
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:09,480
But once his posts regarding Covid being fake went viral, his new audience began to feed

130
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:13,800
him new information, causing him to spiral into New World Order conspiracy stuff.

131
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:17,700
Or it's Brandon Straka, the gay guy who started the walkaway campaign, who popularized

132
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:22,160
Leaving the Left, who left the left so hard he found himself at the Capitol Riots on January

133
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:25,900
6th, telling the crowd to charge and grab police riot shields on the video.

134
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:29,240
Or it's Emma Sulkowicz, this is Mattress Girl by the way, now we're going into the

135
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,240
deep lore.

136
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:34,440
In 2014 she began carrying her mattress around campus everywhere she went, in protest of

137
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:37,040
the university's handling of her rape case in 2012.

138
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:41,240
In this case, she was so far left that this process actually de-radicalized her to the

139
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,240
center.

140
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:45,960
By 2019 she was a generic liberal, dating and being friends with generic conservatives.

141
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:50,560
Or it's Brett Weinstein, Eric's brother, the guy from the 2017 Evergreen College shit

142
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,560
show.

143
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:53,660
Just in case you don't remember that story, Evergreen College had an informal event called

144
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:57,160
the Day of Absence, where minority students and teachers were asked not to come to campus

145
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,160
that day.

146
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:01,540
They weren't forced, it was voluntary, and the idea was to highlight to white people

147
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:05,800
what it would be like if people of color weren't there in class or performing their necessary

148
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:06,800
functions.

149
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:09,620
Evergreen College's day was the Day of Presence, where they returned to campus and discussed

150
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:10,620
their experiences.

151
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:14,840
However, in 2017, in reaction to Trump's election, some students of color decided to

152
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:18,960
make the Day of Absence a day where white students were required to not attend school

153
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:19,960
for the day.

154
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:23,840
Brett Weinstein, then a professor at Evergreen, objected, and was thrust into the national

155
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:28,120
spotlight as the entire school erupted in protest against what they perceived to be

156
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:29,760
Weinstein's hatred.

157
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:33,040
Weinstein attempted to hold normal classes, but the protest became violent enough that

158
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:35,800
campus security told him it was no longer safe to be there.

159
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:39,680
Parts of the college were occupied by rioters and university staff and faculty not knowing

160
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:42,440
what to do, meekly complied with all of their demands.

161
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:45,480
The event was such a stain on the college that they've lost about half their total

162
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:47,040
enrollment since that incident.

163
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:50,560
Like Jordan Peterson, if you listen to Brett Weinstein's interviews and lectures from

164
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,880
2017, he's reasonable, articulate, and intelligent.

165
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:57,120
But if you listen to him now, he too is going down rabbit holes and radicalizing, in part

166
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,840
due to his experience at the hands of his enemies, and in part due to following the

167
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,560
positive feedback from his audience.

168
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:04,280
But I'm not saying that this is a uniquely right-drifting phenomenon, it's not.

169
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:08,240
What do you think happened to Hassan, or Shu on head, or Vashj, especially now that he's

170
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,240
in his fortress arc?

171
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:12,840
Anybody who isolates themselves from their opponents is bound to feel the effects of

172
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:15,440
not being exposed to new ideas eventually.

173
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:19,600
And it seems like the left understands this on some level, and actually wants it to happen.

174
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:23,000
That's why it's always a problem whenever a leftist talks to a non-leftist, it's always

175
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,120
platforming bad people or whatever, because they believe that even engaging with an alternative

176
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:31,520
point of view, simply acknowledging that it exists, is tantamount to personally helping

177
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:32,520
it spread.

178
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:36,760
It's fair if you argue your points so poorly that you lose your audience to your opponent

179
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:38,360
in a debate, then this might be true.

180
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:42,000
But it's even more true that ignoring your opponent doesn't simply make him go away.

181
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,120
He will keep making moves in the spaces you don't control, where your outrage can't reach

182
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,120
him.

183
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,120
That's the lesson of alt-tech.

184
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:51,640
I also think that's why so many leftists began to pull their own hair out after, when they

185
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:54,160
stopped talking to Destiny, he began talking to the right.

186
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:57,400
And when they got him banned from Twitch, he kept streaming off Twitch.

187
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:59,340
They genuinely wanted him to vanish.

188
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:02,740
But audience capture also isn't a purely political phenomenon either.

189
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:04,100
Look at Nikocado Avocado.

190
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:07,900
Back before he became a 400-pound bag of shit whose entire career revolved around eating

191
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:11,380
himself to death on camera, he did videos where he played violin, where he talked about

192
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:15,300
his romance and being gay, where he talked about being a vegan, yeah he was a vegan once

193
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:16,300
if you can believe it.

194
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:19,940
But it's his mukbang content that went viral, and so it's his mukbang content that he leaned

195
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:20,940
into.

196
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:24,000
He's got millions of subs and views and he's rolling in the money, but do you think he's

197
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,120
a happy man?

198
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:28,920
He might have been poor without his current success, but at least he wouldn't be this.

199
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:31,160
Take the political component out of the conversation.

200
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:35,120
How many YouTubers and streamers have changed what they do based on what went viral?

201
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:39,120
How many of them tried to break out of that mold, failed, and then went back to what worked?

202
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,640
And how many of them changed themselves as a result?

203
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:43,000
The list seems endless.

204
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:47,040
Game Grumps after John left, Doug Walker with Demo Reel, the Epic Meal Time guys, I feel

205
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,880
like every corner of YouTube has something like this happening.

206
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:51,160
Even me to an extent.

207
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:55,040
The deep lore of this channel is that it was started in 2009 with funny anime videos that

208
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:58,000
I made with my friends when we were younger, hence the name Short Petotaku.

209
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:01,840
But we also tried Let's Play stuff for a while before Gamergate got me into politics.

210
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:04,760
Around a year ago I received a hate message that probably got me to think the most out

211
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:07,680
of any other hate message, far more than anything from Kiwi Farms.

212
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:11,640
It was a Vosh sub who said that the only reason I was doing political content is because I

213
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:13,340
couldn't hack it as a Let's Player.

214
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:17,320
I was desperate for my channel to take off, and because my politics videos made it, that's

215
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,320
what I did.

216
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:21,480
And that I would really rather be a Let's Player or a streamer, but I'm just not up

217
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:22,480
to snuff.

218
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:23,480
Is that true?

219
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:25,640
I mean, on some level, maybe.

220
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:28,760
I've never said anything that I disagree with in any of my videos.

221
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:32,280
I never presented anything that I knew to be a lie, and I haven't arbitrarily shifted

222
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:34,480
my political positions to satiate my audience.

223
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:35,920
If I did I wouldn't do this video.

224
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:39,720
But I have noticed that my politics videos get hits where my Let's Plays and anime

225
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:42,400
reviews don't, and I absolutely did chase those hits.

226
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:44,520
On some level, yeah, I was audience captured.

227
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:46,100
But I don't think it was in the same way.

228
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:49,560
I still do the Let's Play thing, it's a gaming stream now by the way, and I'd be

229
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:53,440
grateful if you checked it out, I tried to stream in the ol' SFO Arcade most evenings.

230
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:57,600
But even if that gets no views, even if it never actually takes off, I'm content with

231
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:58,600
it.

232
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:01,800
I would like it to, obviously, but my enjoyment of playing games and talking to my co-hosts

233
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:04,680
and talking to the chat isn't dependent on my material success.

234
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:09,320
I may be doing what took off to pay the bills, but I'm still doing what didn't, because

235
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:11,280
I love doing them both.

236
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:15,600
Consider an alternate universe where SFO is actually a gaming channel or an anime channel,

237
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:19,360
where it's my gaming stuff that took off, and my politics videos get almost no hits.

238
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:23,320
I might be happier considering how stressful the politics scene can be online, sure, but

239
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:25,360
would I still never do politics videos?

240
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,360
No, absolutely not.

241
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:29,600
I'd be a gaming channel where most people are there for the gameplay, and occasionally

242
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:32,960
I'd do a politics video, or I'd have a side channel with no traction or something,

243
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:36,240
and once in a while I'd get a comment of somebody saying, man I came here for the games,

244
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:39,360
but I didn't know you were going to use your platform like this, I don't like your

245
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:42,020
politics videos, just stop doing them and stick to the gameplay.

246
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:43,640
And I would just be like, yeah whatever man.

247
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:47,560
In both cases, my focus is towards what pays the bills, but I would still ultimately be

248
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:49,440
doing all of what I want to do.

249
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:53,400
Ever since I've heard of the idea of audience capture, I realize that it perfectly describes

250
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:54,400
what I want to avoid.

251
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:57,920
I don't want to get so mind-fucked by the most extremist elements of my own audience,

252
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:00,480
no offense, that I end up thinking exactly like them.

253
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,200
And you shouldn't want me to, either.

254
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:05,500
Isn't it more interesting when we actually disagree, and we can use those disagreements

255
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:07,440
to explore new ideas or figure things out?

256
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:10,040
I have a feeling that if you want me to be exactly like you, it's because you want

257
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:12,680
me to propagate your ideas, and I'm not here for that.

258
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:13,680
Sorry.

259
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:16,920
Now, I don't think I'm as extreme as Eric with his idea that it's worth it to purge

260
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:18,300
people, that seems a little bit much.

261
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:22,220
But I also don't feel especially beholden to the idea that I should listen to people

262
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:26,540
who are both more extreme than me, and are genuine fans of me, when they demand that

263
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:29,960
I change my views or admit something is true when I don't think it is.

264
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:31,660
I'm not going to say, go away.

265
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:32,780
I'm not going to hate you.

266
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:35,900
I'm not total biscuits saying you've already been replaced, I don't care.

267
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:39,460
But I'm also not going to chase you around and beg for forgiveness, because clearly,

268
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:43,460
if I disagree with you, it's only because my growth is causing my ego to go to my head,

269
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:44,460
and there's no other reason.

270
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:45,460
No, I don't buy it.

271
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:48,140
I think I said this in another recent video, but I'll repeat it here.

272
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:51,980
There's a golden mean between doing exactly what your audience wants at all times, truth

273
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:55,920
or integrity be damned, and going to war with your audience or consider them dispensable

274
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:58,340
because they refuse to fall in line and worship you.

275
00:12:58,340 --> 00:13:00,900
And I think that midpoint is firm humility.

276
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:04,340
I may disagree with you, but that means nothing beyond the disagreement.

277
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:08,520
I do what I want, not because I don't value your time, but because I do value mine.

278
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:13,260
I make the content that inspires me, when it inspires me, not because I'm egotistical,

279
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:16,340
but because I know that's when it will be me at my best.

280
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:20,880
And most importantly of all, there are so many people I once respected and watched religiously

281
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:23,300
who have been mind-fucked by audience capture.

282
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:26,300
It's true that I don't want to become somebody I'm not, but I also don't want to be that

283
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:27,640
disappointment for you.

284
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:30,780
You might disagree with me, you might even stop watching me one day, but I never want

285
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:33,740
you to be able to say that I changed and betrayed what I used to be all about.

286
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:34,740
No.

287
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:37,220
If I'm going to go out, it's going to be a different way than that.
