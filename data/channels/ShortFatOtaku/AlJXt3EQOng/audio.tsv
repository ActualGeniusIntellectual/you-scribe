0	9540	Every three months or so, I'll peek back at my Kiwi Farms thread, just to see what's
9540	10540	going on.
10540	12860	And it's usually a whole lot of nothing, because I'm a pretty boring guy.
12860	16580	One person even did the Gotta Hand It To Him thing, which hey, I can appreciate.
16580	19300	But there's one bit there that got the ol' wheels turning.
19300	20380	Check out this interaction.
20380	24100	I feel like this dude exists solely to argue with his own fanbase at this point.
24100	28080	The funny thing is, in the past he has had videos where his opinion was fairly unpopular.
28080	30800	His fanbase argued, but it was never this vitriolic.
30800	33160	At this point, he seems to outright hate his fans.
33160	36200	It's the end of the journey for the Le Superior Centrist Grift.
36200	38840	Sooner than later, his new audience will overlap with Vosch.
38840	42520	It's what happened to Adam and Sitch, geez, tell me you don't watch Adam and Sitch without
42520	43520	telling me.
43520	47680	They might do too many Vosch reactions for my taste, yeah, but I'm not sure Vosch's
47680	50960	audience are all going to be watching dudes who spend half of their total upload time
50960	52280	making fun of Vosch.
52280	56440	I feel like he's regretting staying on the Centrist Grift for this long, and didn't
56440	59480	become a breadtuber a few years back when the pickings were good.
59480	60480	Well, no.
60480	63400	I didn't become a breadtuber for one reason, I'm not a socialist.
63400	64400	Simple as that.
64400	67140	But the important bit is the fighting with my audience stuff.
67140	69320	That has happened a lot recently, eh?
69320	73200	Yesterday's Sip, showing how libs of TikTok were factually incorrect with one of their
73200	76980	claims, that got some people pretty angry in the chat, frankly, irrationally.
76980	79420	Or when Lilith and I covered the Mar-a-Lago raid.
79420	81840	Or when Lilith and I talked to Richie, the detransitioner.
81840	83480	Or that Purity Spiral video.
83520	86960	In total, there may have been a dozen times that my audience has vehemently disagreed
86960	91000	with me so far this year, to the point that we openly argue in the chat or the comments.
91000	92000	And you know what?
92000	93000	That's okay by me.
93000	95960	I don't actually hate you guys, even when we have very strong disagreements.
95960	96960	I'm not spoonie.
96960	99720	I may say you're wrong, I might even call you dumb, but I don't hate you.
99720	101800	I don't want you to leave and never come back.
101800	105160	But I'm also not going to say anything I don't think is true, just to keep you around
105160	106160	either.
106160	109200	At the end of the day, I do value my integrity more than being successful.
109200	111720	This video isn't actually about the Kiwi Farms thing, by the way, they just got the
111720	112720	noggin joggin.
112960	115720	They'll say a YouTuber is going downhill because whenever they reply to criticism in
115720	118980	the comments, they're just coping and seething, and they clearly hate their audience.
118980	122440	But they'll also say that a YouTuber is a grifter who says only what their audience
122440	124600	wants to hear in order to avoid losing them.
124600	126680	And you can't be both of those things at the same time.
126680	127680	But you know what?
127680	128680	It's Kiwi Farms.
128680	129680	They're here for the entertainment.
129680	132280	Like from the comedy video, whatever makes the joke funnier without precedence.
132280	134520	It doesn't need to be consistent, only funny.
134520	135520	I can appreciate that.
135520	138480	No, they just got me thinking about the concept of audience capture.
138480	141920	I'm not talking about how to capture your audience, like how to be charismatic and hold
141920	142920	a crowd's attention.
142920	145960	I'm also not talking about a captured audience, where the audience is forced to listen to
145960	146960	a creator.
146960	150080	It's actually kind of the inverse, where the creator is forced to speak to an audience.
150080	152920	The term was first coined, I think, by Eric Weinstein.
152920	156640	The idea is that a content creator attracts an audience that doesn't quite align with
156640	157640	his own views.
157640	161760	So in order to keep that audience happy, friendly, and coming back for more content, the content
161760	164820	creator's own views has to shift towards their audience.
164820	168800	If the audience's views also shift, this can turn into a negative feedback loop, where
168800	172960	a content creator is incentivized to continuously produce more extremist content in order to
172960	175400	keep an ever-radicalizing audience watching.
175400	178880	And most of the time, the content creator also ends up radicalizing themselves.
178880	183640	Weinstein described what he does to try and avoid audience capture in a July 2021 appearance
183640	184640	on Rebel Wisdom.
184640	187800	That I may have introduced the concept of audience capture because I've been worrying
187800	191200	about the same thing from the beginning.
191200	195400	You know, I think I've counseled many people that you have to put poisonous tweets for
195400	201160	the people who follow you who you wish would not follow you, you know, you have to make
201160	207840	sure in some sense that they understand that you're not there to flatter them.
207840	211640	And he's been doing this as far back as 2016, when he said, I try to keep an open mind with
211640	215200	those who disagree with me, but any chance I get to shed followers with incurable hate
215200	216680	in their hearts is welcome.
216680	218480	And here's the same attitude in 2021.
218480	223360	I periodically intentionally shed clusters of followers to avoid what I years ago termed
223360	224480	audience capture.
224480	228760	By tweeting fair points that I know unreasonable people will not abide, whoever's left is usually
228760	229760	fair minded.
229760	232900	I'm now worried I'm losing followers due to a purge though.
232900	236480	That last sentence doesn't mean that he is okay with audience capture, by the way.
236480	240880	He later says, I highly recommend shedding those who attempt to steer you off the cliff.
240880	242400	It's well worth the losses.
242400	245480	We have many examples of those who have been lost to audience capture.
245480	247920	The most high profile one is probably Jordan Peterson.
247920	252340	I did the tubcast a little bit ago with Lilith and Taftage on his Ellen Elliott page rant
252340	254440	where he seemed genuinely unhinged.
254440	259260	This is a far cry from the educated, articulate 2015 era Jordan Peterson back when he was
259260	260840	uploading university lectures.
260840	263940	Where he was once intelligent, now he seems rather dumbed down.
263940	268400	Where he was once inquiring and skeptical, now he seems close minded and conspiratorial.
268400	269560	Look at his interviews too.
269560	273620	Where he once destroyed Kathy Newman, now he sounds a bit whacked out talking to Kyle
273620	274620	Kalinsky.
274620	278560	And while it may be his responsibility to not become a nutter, I don't fully blame him
278560	279560	either.
279560	280640	Look at what Jordan Peterson's gone through.
280640	283200	A benzo addiction, a wife who almost died to cancer.
283200	286780	The near destruction of his career, constant vilification wherever he goes.
286780	290720	From a political camp that, a decade ago, none of us thought were even capable of doing.
290720	293800	There's that comic where the leftist pushes the centrist into the rightist camp and the
293800	296960	rightist guy picks him up and the leftist guy is like, oh, all the centrists are just
296960	298040	on the right in the end.
298040	299840	That actually happens to a lot of people.
299840	304200	Audience capture isn't just how your viewers fluff you, it's how your haters hate you too.
304200	309160	It might be dumb to let yourself be controlled by contrarianism, but it's also very common.
309160	312200	Almost to the point that it's unreasonable to expect your average person to overcome
312200	313200	it.
313200	315080	Who is going to stay loyal to a tribe that hates them?
315080	318780	With these two feedback loops in play, how a creator and their audience radicalize each
318780	322460	other, and how a creator and his haters repel each other, we can see the mechanisms that
322460	324560	push at least some people to the right.
324560	327360	In fact, I think we all identified them during gamergate even.
327360	331400	Most gamers back then were edgy kids, yeah, but they still generally believed in the basic
331400	335720	liberal center-left principles, and the common sentiment felt in the community at that time
335720	340280	– I should know, I was there – was disbelief that the game journos, who were all self-proclaimed
340280	344800	leftists themselves and openly virtue signaled about their commitment to honesty and integrity,
344800	348660	had stabbed their own readers in the back when it came to uncovering the corruption
348660	349660	among their own.
349660	353200	I'm not surprised whatsoever that a lot of the old gamergate and skeptic people eventually
353200	357200	drifted away from the left, and if that event wasn't its primary cause, it was certainly
357200	358200	the first step.
358200	362000	But it's not just those guys, it's people like Majid Nawaz, who started off by funding
362000	365400	a counter-terrorism think tank and advocating on behalf of ex-Muslims.
365400	369480	But once his posts regarding Covid being fake went viral, his new audience began to feed
369480	373800	him new information, causing him to spiral into New World Order conspiracy stuff.
373800	377700	Or it's Brandon Straka, the gay guy who started the walkaway campaign, who popularized
377700	382160	Leaving the Left, who left the left so hard he found himself at the Capitol Riots on January
382160	385900	6th, telling the crowd to charge and grab police riot shields on the video.
385900	389240	Or it's Emma Sulkowicz, this is Mattress Girl by the way, now we're going into the
389240	390240	deep lore.
390240	394440	In 2014 she began carrying her mattress around campus everywhere she went, in protest of
394440	397040	the university's handling of her rape case in 2012.
397040	401240	In this case, she was so far left that this process actually de-radicalized her to the
401240	402240	center.
402240	405960	By 2019 she was a generic liberal, dating and being friends with generic conservatives.
405960	410560	Or it's Brett Weinstein, Eric's brother, the guy from the 2017 Evergreen College shit
410560	411560	show.
411560	413660	Just in case you don't remember that story, Evergreen College had an informal event called
413660	417160	the Day of Absence, where minority students and teachers were asked not to come to campus
417160	418160	that day.
418160	421540	They weren't forced, it was voluntary, and the idea was to highlight to white people
421540	425800	what it would be like if people of color weren't there in class or performing their necessary
425800	426800	functions.
426800	429620	Evergreen College's day was the Day of Presence, where they returned to campus and discussed
429620	430620	their experiences.
430620	434840	However, in 2017, in reaction to Trump's election, some students of color decided to
434840	438960	make the Day of Absence a day where white students were required to not attend school
438960	439960	for the day.
439960	443840	Brett Weinstein, then a professor at Evergreen, objected, and was thrust into the national
443840	448120	spotlight as the entire school erupted in protest against what they perceived to be
448120	449760	Weinstein's hatred.
449760	453040	Weinstein attempted to hold normal classes, but the protest became violent enough that
453040	455800	campus security told him it was no longer safe to be there.
455800	459680	Parts of the college were occupied by rioters and university staff and faculty not knowing
459680	462440	what to do, meekly complied with all of their demands.
462440	465480	The event was such a stain on the college that they've lost about half their total
465480	467040	enrollment since that incident.
467040	470560	Like Jordan Peterson, if you listen to Brett Weinstein's interviews and lectures from
470560	472880	2017, he's reasonable, articulate, and intelligent.
472880	477120	But if you listen to him now, he too is going down rabbit holes and radicalizing, in part
477120	479840	due to his experience at the hands of his enemies, and in part due to following the
479840	481560	positive feedback from his audience.
481560	484280	But I'm not saying that this is a uniquely right-drifting phenomenon, it's not.
484760	488240	What do you think happened to Hassan, or Shu on head, or Vashj, especially now that he's
488240	489240	in his fortress arc?
489240	492840	Anybody who isolates themselves from their opponents is bound to feel the effects of
492840	495440	not being exposed to new ideas eventually.
495440	499600	And it seems like the left understands this on some level, and actually wants it to happen.
499600	503000	That's why it's always a problem whenever a leftist talks to a non-leftist, it's always
503000	507120	platforming bad people or whatever, because they believe that even engaging with an alternative
507120	511520	point of view, simply acknowledging that it exists, is tantamount to personally helping
511520	512520	it spread.
512760	516760	It's fair if you argue your points so poorly that you lose your audience to your opponent
516760	518360	in a debate, then this might be true.
518360	522000	But it's even more true that ignoring your opponent doesn't simply make him go away.
522000	526120	He will keep making moves in the spaces you don't control, where your outrage can't reach
526120	527120	him.
527120	528120	That's the lesson of alt-tech.
528120	531640	I also think that's why so many leftists began to pull their own hair out after, when they
531640	534160	stopped talking to Destiny, he began talking to the right.
534160	537400	And when they got him banned from Twitch, he kept streaming off Twitch.
537400	539340	They genuinely wanted him to vanish.
539340	542740	But audience capture also isn't a purely political phenomenon either.
542740	544100	Look at Nikocado Avocado.
544100	547900	Back before he became a 400-pound bag of shit whose entire career revolved around eating
547900	551380	himself to death on camera, he did videos where he played violin, where he talked about
551380	555300	his romance and being gay, where he talked about being a vegan, yeah he was a vegan once
555300	556300	if you can believe it.
556300	559940	But it's his mukbang content that went viral, and so it's his mukbang content that he leaned
559940	560940	into.
560940	564000	He's got millions of subs and views and he's rolling in the money, but do you think he's
564000	565120	a happy man?
565120	568920	He might have been poor without his current success, but at least he wouldn't be this.
568920	571160	Take the political component out of the conversation.
571160	575120	How many YouTubers and streamers have changed what they do based on what went viral?
575120	579120	How many of them tried to break out of that mold, failed, and then went back to what worked?
579120	581640	And how many of them changed themselves as a result?
581640	583000	The list seems endless.
583000	587040	Game Grumps after John left, Doug Walker with Demo Reel, the Epic Meal Time guys, I feel
587040	589880	like every corner of YouTube has something like this happening.
589880	591160	Even me to an extent.
591160	595040	The deep lore of this channel is that it was started in 2009 with funny anime videos that
595040	598000	I made with my friends when we were younger, hence the name Short Petotaku.
598080	601840	But we also tried Let's Play stuff for a while before Gamergate got me into politics.
601840	604760	Around a year ago I received a hate message that probably got me to think the most out
604760	607680	of any other hate message, far more than anything from Kiwi Farms.
607680	611640	It was a Vosh sub who said that the only reason I was doing political content is because I
611640	613340	couldn't hack it as a Let's Player.
613340	617320	I was desperate for my channel to take off, and because my politics videos made it, that's
617320	618320	what I did.
618320	621480	And that I would really rather be a Let's Player or a streamer, but I'm just not up
621480	622480	to snuff.
622480	623480	Is that true?
623480	625640	I mean, on some level, maybe.
625640	628760	I've never said anything that I disagree with in any of my videos.
628760	632280	I never presented anything that I knew to be a lie, and I haven't arbitrarily shifted
632280	634480	my political positions to satiate my audience.
634480	635920	If I did I wouldn't do this video.
635920	639720	But I have noticed that my politics videos get hits where my Let's Plays and anime
639720	642400	reviews don't, and I absolutely did chase those hits.
642400	644520	On some level, yeah, I was audience captured.
644520	646100	But I don't think it was in the same way.
646100	649560	I still do the Let's Play thing, it's a gaming stream now by the way, and I'd be
649560	653440	grateful if you checked it out, I tried to stream in the ol' SFO Arcade most evenings.
653480	657600	But even if that gets no views, even if it never actually takes off, I'm content with
657600	658600	it.
658600	661800	I would like it to, obviously, but my enjoyment of playing games and talking to my co-hosts
661800	664680	and talking to the chat isn't dependent on my material success.
664680	669320	I may be doing what took off to pay the bills, but I'm still doing what didn't, because
669320	671280	I love doing them both.
671280	675600	Consider an alternate universe where SFO is actually a gaming channel or an anime channel,
675600	679360	where it's my gaming stuff that took off, and my politics videos get almost no hits.
679360	683320	I might be happier considering how stressful the politics scene can be online, sure, but
683320	685360	would I still never do politics videos?
685360	686360	No, absolutely not.
686360	689600	I'd be a gaming channel where most people are there for the gameplay, and occasionally
689600	692960	I'd do a politics video, or I'd have a side channel with no traction or something,
692960	696240	and once in a while I'd get a comment of somebody saying, man I came here for the games,
696240	699360	but I didn't know you were going to use your platform like this, I don't like your
699360	702020	politics videos, just stop doing them and stick to the gameplay.
702020	703640	And I would just be like, yeah whatever man.
703640	707560	In both cases, my focus is towards what pays the bills, but I would still ultimately be
707560	709440	doing all of what I want to do.
709440	713400	Ever since I've heard of the idea of audience capture, I realize that it perfectly describes
713400	714400	what I want to avoid.
714400	717920	I don't want to get so mind-fucked by the most extremist elements of my own audience,
717920	720480	no offense, that I end up thinking exactly like them.
720480	722200	And you shouldn't want me to, either.
722200	725500	Isn't it more interesting when we actually disagree, and we can use those disagreements
725500	727440	to explore new ideas or figure things out?
727440	730040	I have a feeling that if you want me to be exactly like you, it's because you want
730040	732680	me to propagate your ideas, and I'm not here for that.
732680	733680	Sorry.
733680	736920	Now, I don't think I'm as extreme as Eric with his idea that it's worth it to purge
736920	738300	people, that seems a little bit much.
738300	742220	But I also don't feel especially beholden to the idea that I should listen to people
742220	746540	who are both more extreme than me, and are genuine fans of me, when they demand that
746540	749960	I change my views or admit something is true when I don't think it is.
749960	751660	I'm not going to say, go away.
751660	752780	I'm not going to hate you.
752780	755900	I'm not total biscuits saying you've already been replaced, I don't care.
755900	759460	But I'm also not going to chase you around and beg for forgiveness, because clearly,
759460	763460	if I disagree with you, it's only because my growth is causing my ego to go to my head,
763460	764460	and there's no other reason.
764460	765460	No, I don't buy it.
765460	768140	I think I said this in another recent video, but I'll repeat it here.
768140	771980	There's a golden mean between doing exactly what your audience wants at all times, truth
771980	775920	or integrity be damned, and going to war with your audience or consider them dispensable
775920	778340	because they refuse to fall in line and worship you.
778340	780900	And I think that midpoint is firm humility.
780900	784340	I may disagree with you, but that means nothing beyond the disagreement.
784340	788520	I do what I want, not because I don't value your time, but because I do value mine.
788520	793260	I make the content that inspires me, when it inspires me, not because I'm egotistical,
793260	796340	but because I know that's when it will be me at my best.
796340	800880	And most importantly of all, there are so many people I once respected and watched religiously
800880	803300	who have been mind-fucked by audience capture.
803300	806300	It's true that I don't want to become somebody I'm not, but I also don't want to be that
806300	807640	disappointment for you.
807640	810780	You might disagree with me, you might even stop watching me one day, but I never want
810780	813740	you to be able to say that I changed and betrayed what I used to be all about.
813740	814740	No.
814740	817220	If I'm going to go out, it's going to be a different way than that.
