WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:09.540
Every three months or so, I'll peek back at my Kiwi Farms thread, just to see what's

00:09.540 --> 00:10.540
going on.

00:10.540 --> 00:12.860
And it's usually a whole lot of nothing, because I'm a pretty boring guy.

00:12.860 --> 00:16.580
One person even did the Gotta Hand It To Him thing, which hey, I can appreciate.

00:16.580 --> 00:19.300
But there's one bit there that got the ol' wheels turning.

00:19.300 --> 00:20.380
Check out this interaction.

00:20.380 --> 00:24.100
I feel like this dude exists solely to argue with his own fanbase at this point.

00:24.100 --> 00:28.080
The funny thing is, in the past he has had videos where his opinion was fairly unpopular.

00:28.080 --> 00:30.800
His fanbase argued, but it was never this vitriolic.

00:30.800 --> 00:33.160
At this point, he seems to outright hate his fans.

00:33.160 --> 00:36.200
It's the end of the journey for the Le Superior Centrist Grift.

00:36.200 --> 00:38.840
Sooner than later, his new audience will overlap with Vosch.

00:38.840 --> 00:42.520
It's what happened to Adam and Sitch, geez, tell me you don't watch Adam and Sitch without

00:42.520 --> 00:43.520
telling me.

00:43.520 --> 00:47.680
They might do too many Vosch reactions for my taste, yeah, but I'm not sure Vosch's

00:47.680 --> 00:50.960
audience are all going to be watching dudes who spend half of their total upload time

00:50.960 --> 00:52.280
making fun of Vosch.

00:52.280 --> 00:56.440
I feel like he's regretting staying on the Centrist Grift for this long, and didn't

00:56.440 --> 00:59.480
become a breadtuber a few years back when the pickings were good.

00:59.480 --> 01:00.480
Well, no.

01:00.480 --> 01:03.400
I didn't become a breadtuber for one reason, I'm not a socialist.

01:03.400 --> 01:04.400
Simple as that.

01:04.400 --> 01:07.140
But the important bit is the fighting with my audience stuff.

01:07.140 --> 01:09.320
That has happened a lot recently, eh?

01:09.320 --> 01:13.200
Yesterday's Sip, showing how libs of TikTok were factually incorrect with one of their

01:13.200 --> 01:16.980
claims, that got some people pretty angry in the chat, frankly, irrationally.

01:16.980 --> 01:19.420
Or when Lilith and I covered the Mar-a-Lago raid.

01:19.420 --> 01:21.840
Or when Lilith and I talked to Richie, the detransitioner.

01:21.840 --> 01:23.480
Or that Purity Spiral video.

01:23.520 --> 01:26.960
In total, there may have been a dozen times that my audience has vehemently disagreed

01:26.960 --> 01:31.000
with me so far this year, to the point that we openly argue in the chat or the comments.

01:31.000 --> 01:32.000
And you know what?

01:32.000 --> 01:33.000
That's okay by me.

01:33.000 --> 01:35.960
I don't actually hate you guys, even when we have very strong disagreements.

01:35.960 --> 01:36.960
I'm not spoonie.

01:36.960 --> 01:39.720
I may say you're wrong, I might even call you dumb, but I don't hate you.

01:39.720 --> 01:41.800
I don't want you to leave and never come back.

01:41.800 --> 01:45.160
But I'm also not going to say anything I don't think is true, just to keep you around

01:45.160 --> 01:46.160
either.

01:46.160 --> 01:49.200
At the end of the day, I do value my integrity more than being successful.

01:49.200 --> 01:51.720
This video isn't actually about the Kiwi Farms thing, by the way, they just got the

01:51.720 --> 01:52.720
noggin joggin.

01:52.960 --> 01:55.720
They'll say a YouTuber is going downhill because whenever they reply to criticism in

01:55.720 --> 01:58.980
the comments, they're just coping and seething, and they clearly hate their audience.

01:58.980 --> 02:02.440
But they'll also say that a YouTuber is a grifter who says only what their audience

02:02.440 --> 02:04.600
wants to hear in order to avoid losing them.

02:04.600 --> 02:06.680
And you can't be both of those things at the same time.

02:06.680 --> 02:07.680
But you know what?

02:07.680 --> 02:08.680
It's Kiwi Farms.

02:08.680 --> 02:09.680
They're here for the entertainment.

02:09.680 --> 02:12.280
Like from the comedy video, whatever makes the joke funnier without precedence.

02:12.280 --> 02:14.520
It doesn't need to be consistent, only funny.

02:14.520 --> 02:15.520
I can appreciate that.

02:15.520 --> 02:18.480
No, they just got me thinking about the concept of audience capture.

02:18.480 --> 02:21.920
I'm not talking about how to capture your audience, like how to be charismatic and hold

02:21.920 --> 02:22.920
a crowd's attention.

02:22.920 --> 02:25.960
I'm also not talking about a captured audience, where the audience is forced to listen to

02:25.960 --> 02:26.960
a creator.

02:26.960 --> 02:30.080
It's actually kind of the inverse, where the creator is forced to speak to an audience.

02:30.080 --> 02:32.920
The term was first coined, I think, by Eric Weinstein.

02:32.920 --> 02:36.640
The idea is that a content creator attracts an audience that doesn't quite align with

02:36.640 --> 02:37.640
his own views.

02:37.640 --> 02:41.760
So in order to keep that audience happy, friendly, and coming back for more content, the content

02:41.760 --> 02:44.820
creator's own views has to shift towards their audience.

02:44.820 --> 02:48.800
If the audience's views also shift, this can turn into a negative feedback loop, where

02:48.800 --> 02:52.960
a content creator is incentivized to continuously produce more extremist content in order to

02:52.960 --> 02:55.400
keep an ever-radicalizing audience watching.

02:55.400 --> 02:58.880
And most of the time, the content creator also ends up radicalizing themselves.

02:58.880 --> 03:03.640
Weinstein described what he does to try and avoid audience capture in a July 2021 appearance

03:03.640 --> 03:04.640
on Rebel Wisdom.

03:04.640 --> 03:07.800
That I may have introduced the concept of audience capture because I've been worrying

03:07.800 --> 03:11.200
about the same thing from the beginning.

03:11.200 --> 03:15.400
You know, I think I've counseled many people that you have to put poisonous tweets for

03:15.400 --> 03:21.160
the people who follow you who you wish would not follow you, you know, you have to make

03:21.160 --> 03:27.840
sure in some sense that they understand that you're not there to flatter them.

03:27.840 --> 03:31.640
And he's been doing this as far back as 2016, when he said, I try to keep an open mind with

03:31.640 --> 03:35.200
those who disagree with me, but any chance I get to shed followers with incurable hate

03:35.200 --> 03:36.680
in their hearts is welcome.

03:36.680 --> 03:38.480
And here's the same attitude in 2021.

03:38.480 --> 03:43.360
I periodically intentionally shed clusters of followers to avoid what I years ago termed

03:43.360 --> 03:44.480
audience capture.

03:44.480 --> 03:48.760
By tweeting fair points that I know unreasonable people will not abide, whoever's left is usually

03:48.760 --> 03:49.760
fair minded.

03:49.760 --> 03:52.900
I'm now worried I'm losing followers due to a purge though.

03:52.900 --> 03:56.480
That last sentence doesn't mean that he is okay with audience capture, by the way.

03:56.480 --> 04:00.880
He later says, I highly recommend shedding those who attempt to steer you off the cliff.

04:00.880 --> 04:02.400
It's well worth the losses.

04:02.400 --> 04:05.480
We have many examples of those who have been lost to audience capture.

04:05.480 --> 04:07.920
The most high profile one is probably Jordan Peterson.

04:07.920 --> 04:12.340
I did the tubcast a little bit ago with Lilith and Taftage on his Ellen Elliott page rant

04:12.340 --> 04:14.440
where he seemed genuinely unhinged.

04:14.440 --> 04:19.260
This is a far cry from the educated, articulate 2015 era Jordan Peterson back when he was

04:19.260 --> 04:20.840
uploading university lectures.

04:20.840 --> 04:23.940
Where he was once intelligent, now he seems rather dumbed down.

04:23.940 --> 04:28.400
Where he was once inquiring and skeptical, now he seems close minded and conspiratorial.

04:28.400 --> 04:29.560
Look at his interviews too.

04:29.560 --> 04:33.620
Where he once destroyed Kathy Newman, now he sounds a bit whacked out talking to Kyle

04:33.620 --> 04:34.620
Kalinsky.

04:34.620 --> 04:38.560
And while it may be his responsibility to not become a nutter, I don't fully blame him

04:38.560 --> 04:39.560
either.

04:39.560 --> 04:40.640
Look at what Jordan Peterson's gone through.

04:40.640 --> 04:43.200
A benzo addiction, a wife who almost died to cancer.

04:43.200 --> 04:46.780
The near destruction of his career, constant vilification wherever he goes.

04:46.780 --> 04:50.720
From a political camp that, a decade ago, none of us thought were even capable of doing.

04:50.720 --> 04:53.800
There's that comic where the leftist pushes the centrist into the rightist camp and the

04:53.800 --> 04:56.960
rightist guy picks him up and the leftist guy is like, oh, all the centrists are just

04:56.960 --> 04:58.040
on the right in the end.

04:58.040 --> 04:59.840
That actually happens to a lot of people.

04:59.840 --> 05:04.200
Audience capture isn't just how your viewers fluff you, it's how your haters hate you too.

05:04.200 --> 05:09.160
It might be dumb to let yourself be controlled by contrarianism, but it's also very common.

05:09.160 --> 05:12.200
Almost to the point that it's unreasonable to expect your average person to overcome

05:12.200 --> 05:13.200
it.

05:13.200 --> 05:15.080
Who is going to stay loyal to a tribe that hates them?

05:15.080 --> 05:18.780
With these two feedback loops in play, how a creator and their audience radicalize each

05:18.780 --> 05:22.460
other, and how a creator and his haters repel each other, we can see the mechanisms that

05:22.460 --> 05:24.560
push at least some people to the right.

05:24.560 --> 05:27.360
In fact, I think we all identified them during gamergate even.

05:27.360 --> 05:31.400
Most gamers back then were edgy kids, yeah, but they still generally believed in the basic

05:31.400 --> 05:35.720
liberal center-left principles, and the common sentiment felt in the community at that time

05:35.720 --> 05:40.280
– I should know, I was there – was disbelief that the game journos, who were all self-proclaimed

05:40.280 --> 05:44.800
leftists themselves and openly virtue signaled about their commitment to honesty and integrity,

05:44.800 --> 05:48.660
had stabbed their own readers in the back when it came to uncovering the corruption

05:48.660 --> 05:49.660
among their own.

05:49.660 --> 05:53.200
I'm not surprised whatsoever that a lot of the old gamergate and skeptic people eventually

05:53.200 --> 05:57.200
drifted away from the left, and if that event wasn't its primary cause, it was certainly

05:57.200 --> 05:58.200
the first step.

05:58.200 --> 06:02.000
But it's not just those guys, it's people like Majid Nawaz, who started off by funding

06:02.000 --> 06:05.400
a counter-terrorism think tank and advocating on behalf of ex-Muslims.

06:05.400 --> 06:09.480
But once his posts regarding Covid being fake went viral, his new audience began to feed

06:09.480 --> 06:13.800
him new information, causing him to spiral into New World Order conspiracy stuff.

06:13.800 --> 06:17.700
Or it's Brandon Straka, the gay guy who started the walkaway campaign, who popularized

06:17.700 --> 06:22.160
Leaving the Left, who left the left so hard he found himself at the Capitol Riots on January

06:22.160 --> 06:25.900
6th, telling the crowd to charge and grab police riot shields on the video.

06:25.900 --> 06:29.240
Or it's Emma Sulkowicz, this is Mattress Girl by the way, now we're going into the

06:29.240 --> 06:30.240
deep lore.

06:30.240 --> 06:34.440
In 2014 she began carrying her mattress around campus everywhere she went, in protest of

06:34.440 --> 06:37.040
the university's handling of her rape case in 2012.

06:37.040 --> 06:41.240
In this case, she was so far left that this process actually de-radicalized her to the

06:41.240 --> 06:42.240
center.

06:42.240 --> 06:45.960
By 2019 she was a generic liberal, dating and being friends with generic conservatives.

06:45.960 --> 06:50.560
Or it's Brett Weinstein, Eric's brother, the guy from the 2017 Evergreen College shit

06:50.560 --> 06:51.560
show.

06:51.560 --> 06:53.660
Just in case you don't remember that story, Evergreen College had an informal event called

06:53.660 --> 06:57.160
the Day of Absence, where minority students and teachers were asked not to come to campus

06:57.160 --> 06:58.160
that day.

06:58.160 --> 07:01.540
They weren't forced, it was voluntary, and the idea was to highlight to white people

07:01.540 --> 07:05.800
what it would be like if people of color weren't there in class or performing their necessary

07:05.800 --> 07:06.800
functions.

07:06.800 --> 07:09.620
Evergreen College's day was the Day of Presence, where they returned to campus and discussed

07:09.620 --> 07:10.620
their experiences.

07:10.620 --> 07:14.840
However, in 2017, in reaction to Trump's election, some students of color decided to

07:14.840 --> 07:18.960
make the Day of Absence a day where white students were required to not attend school

07:18.960 --> 07:19.960
for the day.

07:19.960 --> 07:23.840
Brett Weinstein, then a professor at Evergreen, objected, and was thrust into the national

07:23.840 --> 07:28.120
spotlight as the entire school erupted in protest against what they perceived to be

07:28.120 --> 07:29.760
Weinstein's hatred.

07:29.760 --> 07:33.040
Weinstein attempted to hold normal classes, but the protest became violent enough that

07:33.040 --> 07:35.800
campus security told him it was no longer safe to be there.

07:35.800 --> 07:39.680
Parts of the college were occupied by rioters and university staff and faculty not knowing

07:39.680 --> 07:42.440
what to do, meekly complied with all of their demands.

07:42.440 --> 07:45.480
The event was such a stain on the college that they've lost about half their total

07:45.480 --> 07:47.040
enrollment since that incident.

07:47.040 --> 07:50.560
Like Jordan Peterson, if you listen to Brett Weinstein's interviews and lectures from

07:50.560 --> 07:52.880
2017, he's reasonable, articulate, and intelligent.

07:52.880 --> 07:57.120
But if you listen to him now, he too is going down rabbit holes and radicalizing, in part

07:57.120 --> 07:59.840
due to his experience at the hands of his enemies, and in part due to following the

07:59.840 --> 08:01.560
positive feedback from his audience.

08:01.560 --> 08:04.280
But I'm not saying that this is a uniquely right-drifting phenomenon, it's not.

08:04.760 --> 08:08.240
What do you think happened to Hassan, or Shu on head, or Vashj, especially now that he's

08:08.240 --> 08:09.240
in his fortress arc?

08:09.240 --> 08:12.840
Anybody who isolates themselves from their opponents is bound to feel the effects of

08:12.840 --> 08:15.440
not being exposed to new ideas eventually.

08:15.440 --> 08:19.600
And it seems like the left understands this on some level, and actually wants it to happen.

08:19.600 --> 08:23.000
That's why it's always a problem whenever a leftist talks to a non-leftist, it's always

08:23.000 --> 08:27.120
platforming bad people or whatever, because they believe that even engaging with an alternative

08:27.120 --> 08:31.520
point of view, simply acknowledging that it exists, is tantamount to personally helping

08:31.520 --> 08:32.520
it spread.

08:32.760 --> 08:36.760
It's fair if you argue your points so poorly that you lose your audience to your opponent

08:36.760 --> 08:38.360
in a debate, then this might be true.

08:38.360 --> 08:42.000
But it's even more true that ignoring your opponent doesn't simply make him go away.

08:42.000 --> 08:46.120
He will keep making moves in the spaces you don't control, where your outrage can't reach

08:46.120 --> 08:47.120
him.

08:47.120 --> 08:48.120
That's the lesson of alt-tech.

08:48.120 --> 08:51.640
I also think that's why so many leftists began to pull their own hair out after, when they

08:51.640 --> 08:54.160
stopped talking to Destiny, he began talking to the right.

08:54.160 --> 08:57.400
And when they got him banned from Twitch, he kept streaming off Twitch.

08:57.400 --> 08:59.340
They genuinely wanted him to vanish.

08:59.340 --> 09:02.740
But audience capture also isn't a purely political phenomenon either.

09:02.740 --> 09:04.100
Look at Nikocado Avocado.

09:04.100 --> 09:07.900
Back before he became a 400-pound bag of shit whose entire career revolved around eating

09:07.900 --> 09:11.380
himself to death on camera, he did videos where he played violin, where he talked about

09:11.380 --> 09:15.300
his romance and being gay, where he talked about being a vegan, yeah he was a vegan once

09:15.300 --> 09:16.300
if you can believe it.

09:16.300 --> 09:19.940
But it's his mukbang content that went viral, and so it's his mukbang content that he leaned

09:19.940 --> 09:20.940
into.

09:20.940 --> 09:24.000
He's got millions of subs and views and he's rolling in the money, but do you think he's

09:24.000 --> 09:25.120
a happy man?

09:25.120 --> 09:28.920
He might have been poor without his current success, but at least he wouldn't be this.

09:28.920 --> 09:31.160
Take the political component out of the conversation.

09:31.160 --> 09:35.120
How many YouTubers and streamers have changed what they do based on what went viral?

09:35.120 --> 09:39.120
How many of them tried to break out of that mold, failed, and then went back to what worked?

09:39.120 --> 09:41.640
And how many of them changed themselves as a result?

09:41.640 --> 09:43.000
The list seems endless.

09:43.000 --> 09:47.040
Game Grumps after John left, Doug Walker with Demo Reel, the Epic Meal Time guys, I feel

09:47.040 --> 09:49.880
like every corner of YouTube has something like this happening.

09:49.880 --> 09:51.160
Even me to an extent.

09:51.160 --> 09:55.040
The deep lore of this channel is that it was started in 2009 with funny anime videos that

09:55.040 --> 09:58.000
I made with my friends when we were younger, hence the name Short Petotaku.

09:58.080 --> 10:01.840
But we also tried Let's Play stuff for a while before Gamergate got me into politics.

10:01.840 --> 10:04.760
Around a year ago I received a hate message that probably got me to think the most out

10:04.760 --> 10:07.680
of any other hate message, far more than anything from Kiwi Farms.

10:07.680 --> 10:11.640
It was a Vosh sub who said that the only reason I was doing political content is because I

10:11.640 --> 10:13.340
couldn't hack it as a Let's Player.

10:13.340 --> 10:17.320
I was desperate for my channel to take off, and because my politics videos made it, that's

10:17.320 --> 10:18.320
what I did.

10:18.320 --> 10:21.480
And that I would really rather be a Let's Player or a streamer, but I'm just not up

10:21.480 --> 10:22.480
to snuff.

10:22.480 --> 10:23.480
Is that true?

10:23.480 --> 10:25.640
I mean, on some level, maybe.

10:25.640 --> 10:28.760
I've never said anything that I disagree with in any of my videos.

10:28.760 --> 10:32.280
I never presented anything that I knew to be a lie, and I haven't arbitrarily shifted

10:32.280 --> 10:34.480
my political positions to satiate my audience.

10:34.480 --> 10:35.920
If I did I wouldn't do this video.

10:35.920 --> 10:39.720
But I have noticed that my politics videos get hits where my Let's Plays and anime

10:39.720 --> 10:42.400
reviews don't, and I absolutely did chase those hits.

10:42.400 --> 10:44.520
On some level, yeah, I was audience captured.

10:44.520 --> 10:46.100
But I don't think it was in the same way.

10:46.100 --> 10:49.560
I still do the Let's Play thing, it's a gaming stream now by the way, and I'd be

10:49.560 --> 10:53.440
grateful if you checked it out, I tried to stream in the ol' SFO Arcade most evenings.

10:53.480 --> 10:57.600
But even if that gets no views, even if it never actually takes off, I'm content with

10:57.600 --> 10:58.600
it.

10:58.600 --> 11:01.800
I would like it to, obviously, but my enjoyment of playing games and talking to my co-hosts

11:01.800 --> 11:04.680
and talking to the chat isn't dependent on my material success.

11:04.680 --> 11:09.320
I may be doing what took off to pay the bills, but I'm still doing what didn't, because

11:09.320 --> 11:11.280
I love doing them both.

11:11.280 --> 11:15.600
Consider an alternate universe where SFO is actually a gaming channel or an anime channel,

11:15.600 --> 11:19.360
where it's my gaming stuff that took off, and my politics videos get almost no hits.

11:19.360 --> 11:23.320
I might be happier considering how stressful the politics scene can be online, sure, but

11:23.320 --> 11:25.360
would I still never do politics videos?

11:25.360 --> 11:26.360
No, absolutely not.

11:26.360 --> 11:29.600
I'd be a gaming channel where most people are there for the gameplay, and occasionally

11:29.600 --> 11:32.960
I'd do a politics video, or I'd have a side channel with no traction or something,

11:32.960 --> 11:36.240
and once in a while I'd get a comment of somebody saying, man I came here for the games,

11:36.240 --> 11:39.360
but I didn't know you were going to use your platform like this, I don't like your

11:39.360 --> 11:42.020
politics videos, just stop doing them and stick to the gameplay.

11:42.020 --> 11:43.640
And I would just be like, yeah whatever man.

11:43.640 --> 11:47.560
In both cases, my focus is towards what pays the bills, but I would still ultimately be

11:47.560 --> 11:49.440
doing all of what I want to do.

11:49.440 --> 11:53.400
Ever since I've heard of the idea of audience capture, I realize that it perfectly describes

11:53.400 --> 11:54.400
what I want to avoid.

11:54.400 --> 11:57.920
I don't want to get so mind-fucked by the most extremist elements of my own audience,

11:57.920 --> 12:00.480
no offense, that I end up thinking exactly like them.

12:00.480 --> 12:02.200
And you shouldn't want me to, either.

12:02.200 --> 12:05.500
Isn't it more interesting when we actually disagree, and we can use those disagreements

12:05.500 --> 12:07.440
to explore new ideas or figure things out?

12:07.440 --> 12:10.040
I have a feeling that if you want me to be exactly like you, it's because you want

12:10.040 --> 12:12.680
me to propagate your ideas, and I'm not here for that.

12:12.680 --> 12:13.680
Sorry.

12:13.680 --> 12:16.920
Now, I don't think I'm as extreme as Eric with his idea that it's worth it to purge

12:16.920 --> 12:18.300
people, that seems a little bit much.

12:18.300 --> 12:22.220
But I also don't feel especially beholden to the idea that I should listen to people

12:22.220 --> 12:26.540
who are both more extreme than me, and are genuine fans of me, when they demand that

12:26.540 --> 12:29.960
I change my views or admit something is true when I don't think it is.

12:29.960 --> 12:31.660
I'm not going to say, go away.

12:31.660 --> 12:32.780
I'm not going to hate you.

12:32.780 --> 12:35.900
I'm not total biscuits saying you've already been replaced, I don't care.

12:35.900 --> 12:39.460
But I'm also not going to chase you around and beg for forgiveness, because clearly,

12:39.460 --> 12:43.460
if I disagree with you, it's only because my growth is causing my ego to go to my head,

12:43.460 --> 12:44.460
and there's no other reason.

12:44.460 --> 12:45.460
No, I don't buy it.

12:45.460 --> 12:48.140
I think I said this in another recent video, but I'll repeat it here.

12:48.140 --> 12:51.980
There's a golden mean between doing exactly what your audience wants at all times, truth

12:51.980 --> 12:55.920
or integrity be damned, and going to war with your audience or consider them dispensable

12:55.920 --> 12:58.340
because they refuse to fall in line and worship you.

12:58.340 --> 13:00.900
And I think that midpoint is firm humility.

13:00.900 --> 13:04.340
I may disagree with you, but that means nothing beyond the disagreement.

13:04.340 --> 13:08.520
I do what I want, not because I don't value your time, but because I do value mine.

13:08.520 --> 13:13.260
I make the content that inspires me, when it inspires me, not because I'm egotistical,

13:13.260 --> 13:16.340
but because I know that's when it will be me at my best.

13:16.340 --> 13:20.880
And most importantly of all, there are so many people I once respected and watched religiously

13:20.880 --> 13:23.300
who have been mind-fucked by audience capture.

13:23.300 --> 13:26.300
It's true that I don't want to become somebody I'm not, but I also don't want to be that

13:26.300 --> 13:27.640
disappointment for you.

13:27.640 --> 13:30.780
You might disagree with me, you might even stop watching me one day, but I never want

13:30.780 --> 13:33.740
you to be able to say that I changed and betrayed what I used to be all about.

13:33.740 --> 13:34.740
No.

13:34.740 --> 13:37.220
If I'm going to go out, it's going to be a different way than that.
