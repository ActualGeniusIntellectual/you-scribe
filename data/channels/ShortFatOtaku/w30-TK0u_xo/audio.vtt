WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:08.000
Starting the evening off right with an evening coffee.

00:08.000 --> 00:09.760
How do you feel about it, Naomi?

00:09.760 --> 00:12.200
Stop having coffee and staying up till like four.

00:12.200 --> 00:13.200
Yeah, well.

00:13.200 --> 00:14.200
Stop it.

00:14.200 --> 00:15.200
I got work to do.

00:15.200 --> 00:18.560
Then fucking wake up earlier instead of staying up so late.

00:18.560 --> 00:21.800
Hey, you can't swear in the first minute of a YouTube video or else I get demonetized.

00:21.800 --> 00:22.800
Oh shit.

00:22.800 --> 00:24.360
You can edit this out.

00:24.360 --> 00:27.240
Okay, so I'm here doing a movie thing.

00:27.240 --> 00:29.880
Take a little Naomi, by the way, in the movie video artwork.

00:29.880 --> 00:30.880
Yeah, it's cute.

00:30.880 --> 00:32.240
Yeah, take a little plush.

00:32.240 --> 00:36.880
I also appreciate how they have me in sandals because apparently the artist knows how much

00:36.880 --> 00:39.400
I hate socks.

00:39.400 --> 00:48.320
So ever since Kenobi, I've decided to dip my toes, my little toes into the idea of covering

00:48.320 --> 00:51.320
some media, not all media, but like as we know.

00:51.320 --> 00:54.160
I wouldn't call them little toes.

00:54.160 --> 01:01.680
I haven't really been a media guy, but when we did Santa ink last year, I kind of wait.

01:01.680 --> 01:07.920
I haven't been a media guy used to do anime reviews and also did the film school thing.

01:07.920 --> 01:08.920
I know.

01:08.920 --> 01:09.920
I know.

01:09.920 --> 01:10.920
No, no.

01:10.920 --> 01:11.920
I meant in terms of this channel.

01:11.920 --> 01:12.920
This channel is always like, here's the thing.

01:12.920 --> 01:17.520
People in my sphere of the Internet, they cover like politics and they'll cover drama

01:17.520 --> 01:19.520
and they'll cover media.

01:19.520 --> 01:23.720
But in the context of, wow, this show is terrible and there may be a political or a drama reason

01:23.720 --> 01:24.720
as to why.

01:24.720 --> 01:26.600
Isn't that why you started doing it?

01:26.600 --> 01:27.600
Yeah.

01:27.600 --> 01:32.020
I was avoiding that basically until we, you and I watched Santa ink and then earlier we

01:32.020 --> 01:37.120
watched cuties and even though cuties sucked and Santa ink sucked, the experience of watching

01:37.120 --> 01:40.440
them with you and like doing a video is actually pretty fun.

01:40.440 --> 01:42.240
So I was like, maybe I should, I should do this a bit more.

01:42.240 --> 01:45.520
So then we did Kenobi and come, he was a big fucking, it was way too big of a project.

01:45.520 --> 01:48.240
It's a huge project, but I enjoyed it.

01:48.240 --> 01:52.360
And so I was like, Jesus, there's like four awful shows coming out right now.

01:52.360 --> 01:57.120
There's the star Wars and or show, which looks okay, but I mean everyone is going to be bad

01:57.120 --> 02:03.000
and it might be Star Wars is always bad, but there is the Lord of the rings, the rings

02:03.000 --> 02:10.560
of power show with, with, with Eminem, with Eminem is sour on.

02:10.560 --> 02:13.320
And then there's she Hulk, which I did watch.

02:13.320 --> 02:18.760
And Oh my God, watch the first episode and then showed me clips and I was like, why the

02:18.760 --> 02:20.240
fuck is this so cringe?

02:20.240 --> 02:21.240
You walked out.

02:21.240 --> 02:22.240
With me.

02:22.240 --> 02:23.240
No, no, no.

02:23.240 --> 02:29.320
I'm turning it on just for a minute.

02:29.320 --> 02:30.520
Okay.

02:30.520 --> 02:31.520
Watch this.

02:31.520 --> 02:32.520
And you're going to cringe instantly.

02:32.520 --> 02:33.520
Okay.

02:33.520 --> 02:34.920
I'm already cruncher.

02:34.920 --> 02:35.920
See you later.

02:35.920 --> 02:42.440
Little Gator, bad-ass woman, a Ruth Bader Ginsburg fucking, um, bobblehead.

02:42.440 --> 02:49.040
And I am not already, I'm just experiencing why I am right, but that should be you on

02:49.040 --> 02:50.040
a t-shirt.

02:50.040 --> 02:54.280
But like this, this entire show is literally just girl boss.

02:54.280 --> 02:59.200
And then, um, there was this show, which is the game of Thrones house, host of the dragon

02:59.200 --> 03:00.200
show.

03:00.200 --> 03:03.160
The thing about house of the dragon is it kind of snuck up on everyone.

03:03.160 --> 03:07.360
Like everyone, I think game of Thrones final season was so God awful.

03:07.360 --> 03:10.640
And the last few seasons before that were like so middle of the road compared to like

03:10.640 --> 03:15.680
the first five that everyone forgot their show was coming.

03:15.680 --> 03:19.320
It looked like shit when the trailers came out like a year or two ago and then everyone

03:19.320 --> 03:20.320
forgot.

03:20.320 --> 03:21.320
And then it is like, it just, it just, it just happened.

03:21.320 --> 03:24.280
Like I, I look on Twitter and it's like, Oh, how's the dragon?

03:24.280 --> 03:26.800
So like the day, the day it happened, here's the thing.

03:26.800 --> 03:28.440
I don't think anyone forgot.

03:28.440 --> 03:31.860
I think that everyone just got burned by game of Thrones.

03:31.860 --> 03:37.560
So fucking bad that they were just like, no, they, the, the entire internet was actually

03:37.560 --> 03:39.800
when no, we're not going to pay attention.

03:39.800 --> 03:40.800
Yeah.

03:40.800 --> 03:48.200
Like the first one of the few times that's happened is this, it's like an inverse Morbius

03:48.200 --> 03:52.920
where like they actively willed it into existence again, they actively willed how's the dragon

03:52.920 --> 03:53.920
away.

03:53.920 --> 03:54.920
Yeah.

03:54.920 --> 04:01.920
Um, I was pleasantly surprised by house of the dragon in that it was like a solid, okay.

04:01.920 --> 04:03.880
It wasn't amazing.

04:03.880 --> 04:07.800
It wasn't as good as game of Thrones at its best, but it wasn't, it wasn't, it wasn't,

04:07.800 --> 04:09.160
it wasn't nearly as bad as I thought it was going to be.

04:09.160 --> 04:15.360
I am not going to hold out hope just in case, no, no, I do, I see the thing is I've learned

04:15.360 --> 04:20.080
over the years that if you have no expectations, you generally feel happier.

04:20.080 --> 04:23.300
Is that how you do with me?

04:23.300 --> 04:24.300
No comment.

04:24.300 --> 04:33.040
No, no, but like I was like, I wasn't exactly pleasantly surprised.

04:33.040 --> 04:40.560
Like I had a feeling it was going to be okay and it was okay, but I do not hold out hope

04:40.560 --> 04:43.480
that it's going to get as good as game of Thrones did.

04:43.480 --> 04:44.560
No, I don't think it will either.

04:44.560 --> 04:48.920
But I will say that Matt Smith was not as bad as everyone thought he was going to be.

04:48.920 --> 04:51.680
He looked awful in the trailer because like the wig doesn't fit him.

04:51.680 --> 04:52.680
His face doesn't really fit.

04:52.680 --> 04:53.680
In the trailer or the first episode?

04:53.680 --> 04:54.680
Uh, the trailer.

04:54.680 --> 04:55.680
Okay.

04:55.680 --> 04:57.920
Cause I was just like, the wig doesn't look that bad in the first episode.

04:57.920 --> 05:02.000
You made that comment and I was just like, I mean, to be honest, I have a terrible eye

05:02.000 --> 05:03.000
for these things.

05:03.000 --> 05:06.400
Like, like apparently I know someone who wears a Japan and I can't tell.

05:06.400 --> 05:08.700
By the way, I guess at this point we should probably get, like we should now probably

05:08.700 --> 05:11.920
say we're gonna get into spoilers because we haven't spoiled anything yet.

05:11.920 --> 05:12.920
Yeah.

05:12.920 --> 05:13.920
Spoilers by the way.

05:14.280 --> 05:15.280
Yeah.

05:15.280 --> 05:16.280
Yeah.

05:16.280 --> 05:17.280
Now, now click off.

05:17.280 --> 05:18.280
You know what?

05:18.280 --> 05:19.280
Don't watch.

05:19.280 --> 05:20.280
Why are you even watching my fucking video?

05:20.280 --> 05:21.280
If you, if you don't want to be spoiled.

05:21.280 --> 05:22.280
Fuck you.

05:22.280 --> 05:23.280
Okay.

05:23.280 --> 05:27.720
So listen, don't read any of the comments because you're, you're going to get spoiled.

05:27.720 --> 05:32.280
I talked to Mauler and Mauler was like, yeah, she Hulk is awful, but, but house of the dragon

05:32.280 --> 05:34.240
was actually like, it was a pleasant surprise.

05:34.240 --> 05:38.880
I talked to arch and arch was like, no, how's the dragon still awful?

05:38.880 --> 05:41.680
And here, here's the reason that he gave, here's the reason he gave.

05:41.680 --> 05:48.680
He said that the, the young princess being kind of like quasi lesbian with her hand,

05:48.680 --> 05:53.520
her handmaiden that that that's like progressive shoehorning, which I didn't feel that at all.

05:53.520 --> 05:58.560
That just felt like that felt like a more natural lesbian, the relationship than a lot

05:58.560 --> 05:59.560
of the ones that we're getting right now.

05:59.560 --> 06:04.640
It would have been shoehorning if, you know, I can't even think of a good example, but

06:04.640 --> 06:07.840
give me a good example of lesbian shoehorning.

06:07.840 --> 06:16.000
Um, Steven universe, okay, fine.

06:16.000 --> 06:21.520
Um, the finale of my little pony, they just made two of the ponies together.

06:21.520 --> 06:25.160
I mean, I guess, I don't know though, like every, every time someone talks about shoehorning

06:25.160 --> 06:27.880
stuff in like it, but they just give an example.

06:27.880 --> 06:29.280
That's just a surprise.

06:29.280 --> 06:33.520
It just happened off screen and I'm like, yeah, that's bad, but I've never really felt

06:33.520 --> 06:34.520
like a shoehorning.

06:34.520 --> 06:38.440
It's like, like you wouldn't have the same comment if two of the characters were a guy

06:38.440 --> 06:41.580
and a girl and still got together, you know?

06:41.580 --> 06:42.580
That's true.

06:42.580 --> 06:46.720
So I never feel like it's shoehorning when someone like, I agree that it's bad because

06:46.720 --> 06:48.280
it happened off screen.

06:48.280 --> 06:55.920
Well, also like, like there's, there's the stereotype of girl power, we're together and

06:55.920 --> 06:58.240
fuck the patriarchy, which the show didn't really do.

06:58.240 --> 06:59.240
No.

06:59.240 --> 07:00.240
Yeah.

07:00.240 --> 07:03.580
Like I think that would have been in this show specifically a more like, obviously she's

07:03.580 --> 07:10.780
going to her and her beautiful lover who is a, who is another lady or fucking gonna

07:10.780 --> 07:14.940
like plan to kill the king or they're like Mary Sue their way out of some.

07:14.940 --> 07:15.940
They didn't do that.

07:15.940 --> 07:16.940
No.

07:16.940 --> 07:17.940
Yeah.

07:17.940 --> 07:18.940
That's the second thing though.

07:18.940 --> 07:22.180
Is that Arch, Arch, I think Arch called her a Mary Sue or something similar to it because

07:22.180 --> 07:25.940
we are told that she's intelligent, but we aren't shown.

07:25.940 --> 07:26.940
And I'm like, hold on.

07:26.940 --> 07:30.860
No, we are shown that she's intelligent because there's that they do the exact scene with

07:30.860 --> 07:35.300
her, that in the first episode of Game of Thrones, they did with Bran.

07:35.300 --> 07:37.780
So you will go all the way back to the first season Game of Thrones.

07:37.780 --> 07:41.640
There's, there's a, there's a scene where Bran is sitting around and he's being taught

07:41.640 --> 07:46.180
by the Maester and he's like, you have to say, what, what, what, what's the house?

07:46.180 --> 07:48.020
What's the, is it Bran or Arya?

07:48.020 --> 07:49.020
It's one of the two.

07:49.020 --> 07:50.700
But anyway, it's like, what, what's the house?

07:50.700 --> 07:51.700
Arya.

07:51.700 --> 07:52.700
Is it Arya?

07:52.700 --> 07:53.700
Okay.

07:53.700 --> 07:54.700
Well, either way.

07:54.700 --> 07:55.700
No, but the name, you said Arya, Arya.

07:55.700 --> 07:56.700
Okay.

07:56.700 --> 07:59.840
Anyway, the Maester was like, okay, what's the house and what's, what's their sigil.

07:59.840 --> 08:02.600
And you have to, you have to know all this stuff because it's important.

08:02.600 --> 08:06.760
And the person, whichever, whichever, whichever person, whichever kid, whichever kid it was,

08:06.760 --> 08:08.120
I was like, yeah, I know this already.

08:08.120 --> 08:10.920
I know what I know and like didn't care.

08:10.920 --> 08:11.920
And the Maester was like, yeah, take this seriously.

08:11.920 --> 08:12.920
He's like, I already know it.

08:12.920 --> 08:14.560
And then like, and like, they just rattle it off, right?

08:14.560 --> 08:19.760
They did a very similar scene where they're lying in the Godswood and the, it's not the

08:19.760 --> 08:22.360
Godswood, it's just a tree, isn't it?

08:22.360 --> 08:27.760
I don't remember anything about Game of Thrones, any of the names anymore, but you know, this

08:27.760 --> 08:30.040
episode, they were lying in the forest.

08:30.040 --> 08:31.040
Okay.

08:31.040 --> 08:37.920
And, and they had the book open and the princess was like, I already know this stuff.

08:37.920 --> 08:39.720
And the handmaiden was like, you have to know this stuff.

08:39.720 --> 08:40.720
And then she's like, all right.

08:40.720 --> 08:42.040
And then she just rattled it off.

08:42.040 --> 08:46.800
It's the same scene and it's meant to show that she's actually intelligent.

08:46.800 --> 08:47.800
She just doesn't care.

08:47.800 --> 08:48.800
She's not stupid.

08:48.800 --> 08:52.520
Some people are saying that she is being treated like a Mary Sue and I don't think so.

08:52.520 --> 08:53.840
I disagree with that statement.

08:53.840 --> 08:58.600
I think that they definitely, they definitely established her as one, being neglected by

08:58.600 --> 09:02.040
her father and two, therefore being rebellious.

09:02.040 --> 09:05.640
And three, she seems to be quite naturally intelligent and they, they showed all of that.

09:05.640 --> 09:07.880
They didn't, it wasn't, it wasn't a problem of show, not tell.

09:07.880 --> 09:08.880
They showed that.

09:08.880 --> 09:12.520
Let's do a quick TLDR of the show's plot.

09:12.520 --> 09:13.520
Okay.

09:13.520 --> 09:18.880
You have the king and he's, he's, he's not really a weak king necessarily, but he has

09:18.880 --> 09:21.440
like his problems and they seem to be kind of getting to him.

09:21.440 --> 09:26.720
You have his wife, his wife, the queen, and she's been, she's pregnant and she's trying

09:26.720 --> 09:30.880
to give him an heir cause he doesn't have any male male heirs.

09:30.880 --> 09:36.060
You have his brother and his brother is, is the prince and he's next in line since the

09:36.060 --> 09:40.080
king can't produce a male heir and the brother's kind of sadistic and he seems to be kind of

09:40.080 --> 09:41.320
a bad apple.

09:41.320 --> 09:46.000
And then you have his daughter and his daughter is the princess and the prince, this is the

09:46.000 --> 09:50.600
intelligent, you know, not a Mary Sue, but people are calling her a Mary Sue lesbian

09:50.600 --> 09:51.600
character.

09:51.600 --> 09:52.600
Okay.

09:52.600 --> 09:53.600
Maybe lesbian.

09:53.600 --> 09:54.600
Maybe.

09:54.600 --> 09:55.600
There's, there's hints.

09:55.600 --> 09:56.600
There's hints of it.

09:56.600 --> 09:57.600
You think they're slamming clams?

09:57.600 --> 10:03.440
Well, here's the thing to like broach off until like, since we're doing a TLDR to broach

10:03.440 --> 10:09.980
off and do a different part of it is that like there's hints of it, but also the character

10:09.980 --> 10:13.600
that there's hints with seems to be very much into dudes.

10:13.600 --> 10:17.760
Well, they both seem to be into dudes, they just all seem to be into each other.

10:17.760 --> 10:22.920
I could, I mean, I guess, but it's, it's, I like how you're bi and you're like being

10:22.920 --> 10:23.920
bi is unsatisfying.

10:23.920 --> 10:24.920
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

10:24.920 --> 10:25.920
I'm not saying it's not satisfying.

10:25.920 --> 10:30.020
I'm saying that because Hollywood forgets that bi characters exist unless they are shoe

10:30.020 --> 10:31.240
horning them in for some reason.

10:31.240 --> 10:32.240
Sometimes.

10:32.240 --> 10:33.240
Yeah.

10:33.240 --> 10:34.240
All the fucking time.

10:34.240 --> 10:36.600
But to be fair, Game of Thrones is pretty good about that generally, about not doing

10:36.600 --> 10:37.600
that shit.

10:37.600 --> 10:38.600
Yes.

10:38.600 --> 10:39.600
But this Game of Thrones is bad.

10:39.600 --> 10:40.600
So, okay.

10:40.600 --> 10:41.600
I, I, yeah.

10:41.600 --> 10:45.160
So who the fuck knows?

10:46.000 --> 10:50.280
The story is basically they're trying to have an heir.

10:50.280 --> 10:52.640
The king is very much like, I need a fucking heir, dude.

10:52.640 --> 10:54.960
And like, there's like a bunch of tension surrounding this.

10:54.960 --> 10:55.960
Yeah.

10:55.960 --> 10:58.740
They hold a tournament and the tournament is supposed to be to celebrate the birth of

10:58.740 --> 10:59.740
his child.

10:59.740 --> 11:00.740
Yeah.

11:00.740 --> 11:01.740
Cause the wife is like almost due.

11:01.740 --> 11:03.440
Her belly is big and super gross.

11:03.440 --> 11:04.440
Yeah.

11:04.440 --> 11:07.760
No offense to pregnant woman.

11:07.760 --> 11:10.520
I just, I can't, I can't.

11:10.520 --> 11:14.220
So they, she goes into labor during the tournament.

11:14.280 --> 11:15.980
It goes poorly.

11:15.980 --> 11:17.820
They have to cut it out of her.

11:17.820 --> 11:18.820
Okay.

11:18.820 --> 11:19.820
That was a graphic scene.

11:19.820 --> 11:20.820
That was a really graphic scene.

11:20.820 --> 11:23.340
And it was legitimately upsetting.

11:23.340 --> 11:24.340
Yeah.

11:24.340 --> 11:25.340
To watch.

11:25.340 --> 11:26.340
Holy shit.

11:26.340 --> 11:27.340
Yeah.

11:27.340 --> 11:32.980
Like if, if you or your girlfriend, uh, like are not okay with like really graphic, like

11:32.980 --> 11:42.060
harm to pregnant woman, you might want to like kind of fast forward through that scene.

11:42.060 --> 11:43.340
But it's a long, long scene.

11:43.340 --> 11:44.340
It's actually pretty long scene.

11:44.340 --> 11:45.340
Yeah.

11:45.340 --> 11:46.340
There's a lot of blood.

11:46.340 --> 11:47.340
Yeah.

11:47.340 --> 11:49.020
Because they cut into parts of the really graphic part.

11:49.020 --> 11:50.800
You'll know it when it starts to come up.

11:50.800 --> 11:54.120
The really graphic part, two parts in the tourney, which is also graphic, but honestly

11:54.120 --> 11:55.120
was better.

11:55.120 --> 11:56.120
Yeah.

11:56.120 --> 11:59.380
We're like beating guys faces and like cutting off their hands and shit and it's not as graphic

11:59.380 --> 12:00.380
as the pregnancy scene.

12:00.380 --> 12:02.060
No, like it was extremely upsetting.

12:02.060 --> 12:08.240
Like you guys just heard me say, I don't like, I know I was like, I was not okay.

12:08.240 --> 12:12.260
I was totally, but like you guys just heard me say that I did not like the look of pregnant

12:12.260 --> 12:16.140
woman's bellies and I'm still just like, holy shit, that was really upsetting.

12:16.140 --> 12:18.980
Well yeah.

12:18.980 --> 12:20.400
So they have to cut it out of her.

12:20.400 --> 12:21.400
She dies.

12:21.400 --> 12:23.180
The baby survives a bit, but dies.

12:23.180 --> 12:24.180
Yep.

12:24.180 --> 12:28.420
And so this is like a major tragedy for the kingdom and the kingdom is kind of falling

12:28.420 --> 12:30.340
apart and there's no air.

12:30.340 --> 12:34.420
And however, the air, the, the, the legal air, you know, the council comes together

12:34.420 --> 12:37.440
and was like, listen, you can't have your legal air be your brother because he's fucking

12:37.440 --> 12:38.440
crazy dude.

12:38.440 --> 12:42.220
Because, because what happened earlier was that there was, um, he, he, he, he, he, he

12:42.220 --> 12:47.260
is, he is the Lord commander of the gold cloaks, which is the city watch, which is new.

12:47.260 --> 12:48.260
It's new.

12:48.260 --> 12:51.820
And at this point of the history, it's, it's a 172 years before the original game show.

12:51.820 --> 12:53.820
And we don't remember anyone's names by the way.

12:53.820 --> 12:54.820
Sorry.

12:54.820 --> 12:57.180
Damon was the, but I don't remember anyone's name.

12:57.180 --> 12:58.180
Anyone else?

12:58.180 --> 12:59.180
Yeah.

12:59.180 --> 13:00.180
I don't know anyone's names.

13:00.180 --> 13:01.420
I barely, I didn't even remember his name to who said it.

13:01.420 --> 13:02.420
I don't know anyone's names.

13:02.420 --> 13:06.700
Well, anyway, anyway, there's a, there's a scene where like in order to prepare for the

13:06.700 --> 13:11.180
tourney, uh, he, he gets all the gold cloaks and they go out into King's landing.

13:11.180 --> 13:12.860
They find all the murderers and kill them.

13:12.860 --> 13:16.460
They find all the rapists and castrate them and they find all the thieves and chop their

13:16.460 --> 13:17.740
hands off.

13:17.740 --> 13:21.020
And then the council is like, dude, you got to get hold of your brother because he's going

13:21.020 --> 13:22.460
way too fucking far with this stuff.

13:22.460 --> 13:29.040
He's going so far that they needed a cart pulled by two horses to drag all the fucking

13:29.040 --> 13:31.340
corpses and bodies and parts away.

13:31.340 --> 13:32.340
Yeah.

13:32.340 --> 13:33.340
Fuck.

13:33.340 --> 13:34.340
Like that actually made me laugh.

13:34.340 --> 13:41.120
That was, that was just like, so, um, they're like, listen,

13:41.120 --> 13:45.780
you can't, you can't have your brother be this crazy.

13:45.780 --> 13:46.780
He can't be the king.

13:46.780 --> 13:48.160
If you die, like he can't be your heir.

13:48.160 --> 13:49.560
And the King's like, he's still my brother.

13:49.560 --> 13:52.640
And then like his brother goes off and celebrates with the gold cloaks.

13:52.640 --> 13:58.100
He celebrates the death of the King's newborn son by calling him.

13:58.100 --> 13:59.100
Was it air for a minute?

13:59.100 --> 14:00.480
No, it was air for a day.

14:00.480 --> 14:01.480
Air for a day.

14:01.480 --> 14:02.480
Yep.

14:02.480 --> 14:05.160
And then the King finds out, the King finds out he's really pissed.

14:05.160 --> 14:06.160
He's royally pissed.

14:06.160 --> 14:07.160
Royally pissed.

14:07.160 --> 14:13.800
And so he banishes him back to Dragonstone and then name, yes, he does.

14:13.800 --> 14:14.800
Isn't Dragonstone?

14:14.800 --> 14:17.080
No, it was back to the Vale with his wife.

14:17.080 --> 14:19.720
Well, either way you banishes him.

14:19.720 --> 14:24.840
And then the King names his daughter for the first time, the first time a woman gets to

14:24.840 --> 14:25.840
do it.

14:25.840 --> 14:28.580
His daughter is now the heir to the throne.

14:28.580 --> 14:33.180
And then the King is like, listen, dude, uh, here's the secret passed on from all the Kings

14:33.180 --> 14:39.260
is that one day in maybe 172 years from now, we are going to have to fight the White Walkers.

14:39.260 --> 14:40.260
No.

14:40.260 --> 14:41.260
Okay.

14:41.260 --> 14:42.260
No.

14:42.260 --> 14:47.220
And also, and the King is like also by the way, uh, this entire prophecy that I'm passing

14:47.220 --> 14:50.540
on to you is actually completely false because Arya kills him anyway with, with, with the

14:50.540 --> 14:51.540
dagger.

14:51.540 --> 14:52.540
Yeah.

14:52.540 --> 14:54.820
Actually, I think that's going to be a thing because if you notice the King had the dagger

14:54.820 --> 14:59.660
that Arya used to stab him, what the King actually said is that the first Targaryen

14:59.660 --> 15:04.820
King of Westeros had a dream and the dream is a prophecy and it's that winter is coming

15:04.820 --> 15:09.100
and that there's going to be the army of darkness will march down from the North, which is by

15:09.100 --> 15:10.420
the way, what happens in Game of Thrones.

15:10.420 --> 15:12.220
I don't think he actually said army.

15:12.220 --> 15:15.260
He just, he literally just said the darkness is going to come from the North.

15:15.260 --> 15:19.740
He was actually super vague about it, which I appreciated, but the cringey part was what

15:19.740 --> 15:20.980
the prophecy was called.

15:20.980 --> 15:22.660
It was called the Song of Ice and Fire.

15:22.660 --> 15:23.660
It was cringey.

15:23.660 --> 15:27.260
But that's what called the prophecy that that's what it was called in the original books.

15:27.260 --> 15:28.260
Okay.

15:28.860 --> 15:29.860
And it's like a medieval.

15:29.860 --> 15:30.860
George R.R. Martin.

15:30.860 --> 15:31.940
That's cringey as fuck.

15:31.940 --> 15:34.500
Don't call the prophecy that well, that's, that's why the book series called the Song

15:34.500 --> 15:35.500
of Ice and Fire.

15:35.500 --> 15:40.260
If you can just call it a Song of Ice and Fire and then not have the prophecy be named

15:40.260 --> 15:41.260
that that's just cringey.

15:41.260 --> 15:43.460
It just sounds like a terrible name for a prophecy.

15:43.460 --> 15:45.420
That's my issue with it.

15:45.420 --> 15:47.580
Everything was recorded in ballads and poetry and stuff.

15:47.580 --> 15:48.580
So it makes sense.

15:48.580 --> 15:49.580
I don't care.

15:49.580 --> 15:51.060
It's just like, you just dislike the medieval times.

15:51.060 --> 15:52.060
You know what?

15:52.060 --> 15:54.060
I've never, I've never been to medieval times ever.

15:54.060 --> 15:55.060
Okay.

15:55.060 --> 15:56.060
I'll go without you.

15:56.060 --> 15:57.060
Not allowed.

15:57.060 --> 15:58.060
Fuck a hot lady.

15:58.860 --> 15:59.860
Fuck you.

15:59.860 --> 16:00.860
Okay.

16:00.860 --> 16:06.860
Um, so yeah, like that's the TLDR of the plot and I don't know, like the, the actors that

16:06.860 --> 16:10.860
they chose for the roles, they seem to be not quite right.

16:10.860 --> 16:11.860
Each of them.

16:11.860 --> 16:12.860
Yeah.

16:12.860 --> 16:18.620
It's like the princess, the King, the brother, they all, they all like it strangely feels

16:18.620 --> 16:24.540
not like the thing with the Game of Thrones, the one I think, I think one of the reasons

16:24.540 --> 16:29.100
why everyone liked it so much is because with the first episode you were just drawn

16:29.100 --> 16:34.380
into that world, like with the actors and the sets and the, I think still kind of bad

16:34.380 --> 16:35.380
CGI back then.

16:35.380 --> 16:38.060
It has some better CGI's that went on.

16:38.060 --> 16:39.060
There was bad CGI in this.

16:39.060 --> 16:40.060
Holy fuck.

16:40.060 --> 16:41.060
The cart, the backgrounds.

16:41.060 --> 16:42.060
Yeah.

16:42.060 --> 16:43.060
Who?

16:43.060 --> 16:44.060
Yeah.

16:44.060 --> 16:48.180
You just get drawn into the world because of how like lived in and grungy and like everything,

16:48.180 --> 16:52.340
how people looked, you know, and like how they sounded and how they acted.

16:52.340 --> 16:55.900
I think it was because like in the original Game of Thrones, they were pretty high tier

16:55.900 --> 16:59.060
actors and these ones, they probably aren't so high tier.

16:59.060 --> 17:03.620
Again, probably budget issues, like except technically Matt Smith, I guess.

17:03.620 --> 17:08.280
I think part of it though, is also the fact that in the first episode of Game of Thrones,

17:08.280 --> 17:10.700
you have, you get to see everyone's perspective.

17:10.700 --> 17:11.700
Okay.

17:11.700 --> 17:13.300
You get to see high born and low born characters.

17:13.300 --> 17:18.300
There's Kings and princes and there's princesses and there's Queens and there's Royal ladies,

17:18.300 --> 17:21.300
but then you also get to see, yep, there's bastard.

17:21.300 --> 17:25.700
You get to hang out with Jon Snow, you get to hang out with Tyrion, with Theon, you get

17:25.700 --> 17:29.060
to hang out with Arya when she's like running around, and Bran when they're like running

17:29.060 --> 17:32.540
around with like basically being street rats.

17:32.540 --> 17:37.900
Like there's instances where we get to see the points of view of people who aren't royalty,

17:37.900 --> 17:40.580
even if they might be a little bit.

17:40.580 --> 17:43.020
And there's also non-royal characters directly as well.

17:43.020 --> 17:44.020
Yeah.

17:44.020 --> 17:45.020
Like the prostitutes.

17:45.020 --> 17:47.580
But in this show, there's not much of that.

17:47.580 --> 17:48.580
It's all...

17:48.580 --> 17:50.060
It was only the prostitutes.

17:50.060 --> 17:55.660
It's all like court drama, which is fine, but you need to establish the world first.

17:55.660 --> 17:58.980
Like if this was a standalone show and they hadn't made Game of Thrones, this wouldn't

17:58.980 --> 17:59.980
have gone anywhere.

17:59.980 --> 18:00.980
Yes, I agree.

18:00.980 --> 18:06.460
I think, because that's the thing to branch off also, a lot of the first episode felt

18:06.460 --> 18:07.460
really rushed.

18:07.460 --> 18:08.460
Like it felt like a lot of stuff.

18:08.460 --> 18:10.460
Like it was like, what, an hour long?

18:10.460 --> 18:11.460
How long was it?

18:11.460 --> 18:12.460
It was an hour long.

18:12.460 --> 18:13.460
Yeah.

18:13.460 --> 18:14.460
It felt like, and that's the thing though, it was an hour.

18:14.460 --> 18:15.460
A lot of stuff happens.

18:15.460 --> 18:18.540
Well, to be fair, a lot of stuff happened in the first episode of Game of Thrones.

18:18.540 --> 18:23.540
It didn't feel rushed is my point.

18:23.540 --> 18:24.540
I don't think this felt rushed.

18:24.540 --> 18:25.540
It did to me.

18:25.540 --> 18:26.540
I don't think so.

18:26.540 --> 18:27.920
It felt like a lot of stuff just like happened.

18:27.920 --> 18:36.540
And I think that to fix the, like not having commoner issues problem is to not banish Daemon

18:36.540 --> 18:42.680
before the first episode and have him like be, while kind of a crazy person, like show

18:42.680 --> 18:45.660
his interpersonal relationships a bit with the commoners.

18:45.660 --> 18:46.660
Like episode two.

18:46.660 --> 18:47.660
Yeah.

18:47.780 --> 18:55.780
Because he made the comment when he was in the council meeting that none of them left

18:55.780 --> 18:56.780
the Red Keep.

18:56.780 --> 18:58.620
Except for him because he's the city commander.

18:58.620 --> 19:02.660
To go down and like be around the commoners is one of the reasons he stated that he had

19:02.660 --> 19:05.300
to like fucking do all the shit that he did.

19:05.300 --> 19:07.300
Which is a bit of a, a bit of a cope.

19:07.300 --> 19:08.300
I know what you mean.

19:08.300 --> 19:12.100
I think that would have actually solved an issue because it felt really rushed.

19:12.100 --> 19:13.100
I don't know.

19:13.100 --> 19:15.660
You guys got to go watch it and tell me if you agree with me, but it felt rushed.

19:15.660 --> 19:19.340
You could have had him like be banished by the end of the second episode.

19:19.340 --> 19:22.060
But I understand the point of view is that they wanted to get the main conflict of the

19:22.060 --> 19:25.540
show started, which was going to be, by the way, the civil war that is already in the

19:25.540 --> 19:26.620
lore of the book.

19:26.620 --> 19:30.540
So they're doing that story of the civil war between the King's brother and the King's

19:30.540 --> 19:31.540
daughter.

19:31.540 --> 19:35.700
So they wanted to make that the central story of the show.

19:35.700 --> 19:40.220
So they wanted to actually show the event that kicked it off, which is the death of

19:40.220 --> 19:41.220
the Queen.

19:41.220 --> 19:47.500
The fact that there's no male heir and then Damon, even though he is like, here's the

19:47.500 --> 19:48.500
thing.

19:48.500 --> 19:49.500
He's clearly a bad person.

19:49.500 --> 19:50.500
Yeah.

19:50.500 --> 19:53.740
He's not good, but he made a good point when he was having his final discussion with the

19:53.740 --> 19:57.580
King where it's like, listen, I'm your family.

19:57.580 --> 19:59.980
Everyone else in the council is just sucking up to you and not telling you the truth, which

19:59.980 --> 20:03.420
actually seems to be the truth, which was correct for a thing.

20:03.420 --> 20:07.780
I actually don't want to spoil because it's pretty good, but like that happened before

20:07.780 --> 20:10.140
that scene where it's like, Oh, I was like, Oh, I didn't say it out loud, but I was like,

20:10.540 --> 20:12.540
Oh my God, look, he's right showing all the points.

20:12.540 --> 20:14.540
And they already showed that that was good storytelling guys.

20:14.540 --> 20:15.540
Yes.

20:15.540 --> 20:16.540
Yes, it was.

20:16.540 --> 20:20.540
Even though Damon is not a good person, there are still moments where it's like, listen,

20:20.540 --> 20:23.900
you might be making a mistake sending him out in the cold, especially because he's dangerous.

20:23.900 --> 20:24.900
Yeah.

20:24.900 --> 20:28.900
Like it was, it was a weird feeling of like, he's very obviously not a good person, but

20:28.900 --> 20:34.300
also just like, Oh, cute moments with niece, you know, like, like trying to like protect

20:34.300 --> 20:37.460
his brother and obviously feeling, um, uh,

20:37.460 --> 20:38.460
yeah.

20:38.460 --> 20:39.460
Yeah.

20:39.460 --> 20:43.260
No, by his brother before the banishment, right?

20:43.260 --> 20:47.660
Cause he, cause he had said that, you know, you haven't made me your hand with what, why

20:47.660 --> 20:48.660
you,

20:48.660 --> 20:49.660
yeah.

20:49.660 --> 20:50.660
Yeah.

20:50.660 --> 20:55.740
And that's one thing that I think the show did very well is that it, it had that, it

20:55.740 --> 21:01.980
had that it has those gray characters that Game of Thrones is really well known for care.

21:01.980 --> 21:04.760
Like no one's really good and no one's really evil.

21:04.760 --> 21:08.480
Like you have characters that are more evil than good for sure, but everyone has,

21:08.480 --> 21:13.200
they're small moments of you sympathize and then you're just, you look at yourself and

21:13.200 --> 21:14.200
be like, what the fuck?

21:14.200 --> 21:15.200
Why did I sympathize?

21:15.200 --> 21:21.240
Meanwhile, when you have fucking She-Hulk where She-Hulk is just right, where She-Hulk

21:21.240 --> 21:29.740
is just correct in every circumstance and the Hulk is just considered like a fucking

21:29.740 --> 21:34.260
moron even though he's been doing this for over, Oh God, that show was bad.

21:34.260 --> 21:37.900
So actually you're not talking about, no, we're not, no, we're not.

21:37.900 --> 21:38.900
Here's the thing.

21:38.900 --> 21:39.900
Here's the thing.

21:39.900 --> 21:45.800
Um, I expected to have to be like, Oh God, we got to make a terrible fucking video on

21:45.800 --> 21:49.720
how bad house, house of the dragon is like how I'm probably gonna make one and She-Hulk

21:49.720 --> 21:52.140
eventually or on that halo show.

21:52.140 --> 21:53.140
Oh God.

21:53.140 --> 21:54.140
You know what?

21:54.140 --> 21:55.140
I'll finish watching.

21:55.140 --> 21:56.140
Fuck you.

21:56.140 --> 21:57.580
We watched the first episode of the halo show and then we walked out and she's like, this

21:57.580 --> 21:58.580
is so fucking bad.

21:58.580 --> 21:59.580
So fucking bad.

21:59.580 --> 22:00.580
You know what's funny?

22:00.580 --> 22:01.580
You love halo.

22:01.580 --> 22:02.580
Well, yes.

22:02.580 --> 22:03.580
To, to a degree.

22:03.900 --> 22:08.580
Not as much as people who play halo all the time.

22:08.580 --> 22:12.420
I have a good, I have a few good memories of halo and so I do enjoy the games.

22:12.420 --> 22:17.840
But anyway, um, I will say this about halo since dev decided to mention She-Hulk is that

22:17.840 --> 22:23.540
I think it would have been an okay series if it hadn't had the name brand halo and all

22:23.540 --> 22:24.540
the halo things.

22:24.540 --> 22:25.540
I don't know about that.

22:25.540 --> 22:26.540
I think it would have.

22:26.540 --> 22:27.540
I didn't think good.

22:27.540 --> 22:28.540
I said, okay.

22:28.540 --> 22:31.740
Anyway, what ruined it was that it said it was halo and it wasn't.

22:31.740 --> 22:37.980
So my point is though, is that I was expecting to have to make a review or a video on how

22:37.980 --> 22:42.660
awful house the dragon is and here's how bad the CG is and here's how they ruined this

22:42.660 --> 22:44.360
and here's how they ruined that.

22:44.360 --> 22:47.380
And there might even even been a political element to it where you get like the get woke,

22:47.380 --> 22:49.280
go broke thing.

22:49.280 --> 22:52.780
But we're talking about it like this right now in a more off the cuff manner where it's

22:52.780 --> 22:56.660
not an edited video because I was pleasantly surprised.

22:56.660 --> 22:58.020
I can actually recommend it to you.

22:58.020 --> 22:59.580
I can say, you know what?

22:59.580 --> 23:03.580
Even though every single fucking thing coming out, whether it's a re a reboot or a remake

23:03.580 --> 23:07.620
or a sequel, no one wanted or a rehash or even just a new show, even though they all

23:07.620 --> 23:12.740
fucking suck every single one of them, I can actually recommend this.

23:12.740 --> 23:17.380
And so I'm not going to do any sort of big in depth review unless, unless the show like

23:17.380 --> 23:20.840
craters in the next few weeks, I'm not going to do any sort of big in depth review like

23:20.840 --> 23:21.840
Kenobi or anything.

23:21.840 --> 23:24.340
I think I'm going to say you should watch this one.

23:24.340 --> 23:25.340
Yeah.

23:25.340 --> 23:31.740
I mean, I do recommend it, but I also part of I'm, I'm, I'm torn because part of me wants

23:31.740 --> 23:34.180
to recommend it and be like, give the show a chance.

23:34.180 --> 23:38.180
So they get a better budget and can do better CGI.

23:38.180 --> 23:39.180
Give peace a chance.

23:39.180 --> 23:45.040
However, however, I also don't want to recommend it because the show is okay and it's going

23:45.040 --> 23:46.860
to do either one of two things.

23:46.860 --> 23:50.300
One is going to get better and that means it's going to be better than game of thrones,

23:50.300 --> 23:53.740
which is just going to make me sad because game of thrones is really good and then got

23:53.740 --> 23:59.180
torn to torn asunder or, or it's going to go real bad.

23:59.180 --> 24:06.220
I'm going to go real, real bad and I'll be like, I can't watch anything anymore.

24:06.220 --> 24:12.100
Well we watched anything on, we watched Star Trek, strange new worlds and we were both

24:12.100 --> 24:14.180
surprised that that show was actually good too.

24:14.180 --> 24:17.460
Yeah, but even by the end you're like, Oh, this is a good show.

24:17.460 --> 24:18.460
I'll go all the way through.

24:18.460 --> 24:19.460
It was a good show.

24:19.460 --> 24:23.620
It was still like, yeah, but like it was still only on par with like the okay episodes of

24:23.620 --> 24:25.340
TNG.

24:25.340 --> 24:27.500
That's pretty good for compared to fucking Picard.

24:27.500 --> 24:28.500
Yeah.

24:28.500 --> 24:29.500
Well you know what?

24:29.500 --> 24:32.860
My fucking view wouldn't be so fucking destroyed if you hadn't made me watch Picard.

24:32.860 --> 24:33.860
That was a fun time.

24:33.860 --> 24:35.220
We never ever watched Picard.

24:35.220 --> 24:36.700
We should do a Picard video.

24:36.700 --> 24:37.700
Fuck you.

24:37.700 --> 24:40.420
No, I refuse to live through any of that ever again.

24:40.420 --> 24:41.420
My soul hurts.

24:41.420 --> 24:42.700
You're just talking about it.

24:42.700 --> 24:44.380
No, my soul hurts.

24:44.380 --> 24:47.340
I have actually like mostly gotten rid of most of Picard.

24:47.340 --> 24:48.780
I don't remember most of it anymore.

24:48.780 --> 24:53.060
Remember the part when like the autistic girl is the Vogue queen?

24:53.980 --> 24:59.540
There was, there was actually an article put out where the showrunner of strange new worlds

24:59.540 --> 25:05.740
pitched the show to the studio by saying, why don't we just do the classic Star Trek?

25:05.740 --> 25:11.780
Like you don't need some kind of big long, you know, like, so you don't need some kind

25:11.780 --> 25:15.900
of huge plot where the entire galaxy, the entire universe is at stake and there's like

25:15.900 --> 25:18.900
constant Starship battles and crazy shit going on.

25:18.900 --> 25:22.180
And at last the entire, just do standalone episodes.

25:23.060 --> 25:29.460
And have like a reasonably well liked cast doing adventures every single day and resolving

25:29.460 --> 25:31.020
them by the end of the adventure.

25:31.020 --> 25:34.420
And maybe you have a little morality tale in there, or maybe it's like a little science

25:34.420 --> 25:39.100
fiction thing, or maybe it's like a puzzle problem, like whatever, but they just do Star

25:39.100 --> 25:40.100
Trek.

25:40.100 --> 25:41.100
And that's what they did.

25:41.100 --> 25:42.100
And it was good.

25:42.100 --> 25:43.100
Yes.

25:43.100 --> 25:45.300
But they also do, they do do this more modern storytelling thing that I do enjoy of they

25:45.300 --> 25:50.540
have episodic episodes that are small tie-ins to past episodes because there's one character

25:50.540 --> 25:51.860
who dies and he's actually gone.

25:51.860 --> 25:52.860
Yeah.

25:52.860 --> 25:55.740
Like they're, they're, they're small tie-ins and I've always enjoyed it.

25:55.740 --> 25:59.860
I like how modern shows have done that cause I found a lot of old shows just don't do that.

25:59.860 --> 26:01.740
They're so episodically, nothing ever changes.

26:01.740 --> 26:04.020
And it annoys me so much.

26:04.020 --> 26:08.300
I mean, that was the big problem with Voyagers that it got too episodic where like, Villana

26:08.300 --> 26:12.820
Torres was dealing with being half-cling on the entire seven fucking years of the show.

26:12.820 --> 26:16.700
And that got old pretty fucking quick after you did it like 10 times.

26:16.700 --> 26:17.700
Yeah.

26:17.700 --> 26:20.700
Anyway, Host of the Dragon is okay.

26:20.700 --> 26:21.700
It's okay.

26:21.700 --> 26:22.700
You know what?

26:22.700 --> 26:26.180
I'm not really gonna, I'm not going to do a video on it unless it like massively tanks

26:26.180 --> 26:27.820
in the next few episodes.

26:27.820 --> 26:29.620
I think I, I think I will wait.

26:29.620 --> 26:33.220
I'll talk about She-Hulk probably at some point and how terrible that is.

26:33.220 --> 26:37.100
And I'll probably talk about, um, we all know Lord of the Rings, Rings of Power is going

26:37.100 --> 26:38.100
to be fucking abysmal.

26:38.100 --> 26:39.100
I don't want to watch it.

26:39.100 --> 26:40.100
Oh my God.

26:40.100 --> 26:41.100
It's going to be abysmal.

26:41.100 --> 26:44.100
I haven't even watched the, like the new quote unquote movies yet.

26:44.100 --> 26:45.100
Here's the thing.

26:45.100 --> 26:47.300
Like our arch movies, I haven't seen them.

26:47.300 --> 26:51.020
I think like Arch and Kibbs and Lilith and I are going to do like a four person watch

26:51.020 --> 26:53.480
party of, of Rings of Power.

26:53.480 --> 26:54.480
You guys should.

26:54.480 --> 26:58.540
I, you, you watch the first episode and then tell me how it is and I will give it a chance

26:58.540 --> 27:01.220
because honestly I just, I'll just say it's great.

27:01.220 --> 27:03.340
And then it'll be fucking like so bad.

27:03.340 --> 27:08.500
Don't kick the computer and then you'll be single.

27:08.500 --> 27:14.260
Anyway, um, if you like Game of Thrones, give Host of the Dragon a chance.

27:14.260 --> 27:15.260
It's not bad.

27:15.260 --> 27:19.620
This is the first episode that we're doing this in, so give at least the first episode

27:19.620 --> 27:20.620
a chance.

27:20.620 --> 27:21.620
Give it, give it a chance.

27:21.620 --> 27:27.220
And you'll have to forgive it for the terrible CGI because I don't care about those sort

27:27.220 --> 27:32.380
of things because I watched terrible looking anime because I do things I'm not allowed

27:32.380 --> 27:33.380
to talk about on YouTube.

27:33.380 --> 27:36.060
I guess that's the end.

27:36.060 --> 27:39.100
How does, how does Red Letter Media usually end these things?

27:39.100 --> 27:40.700
By throwing beer at things.

27:40.700 --> 27:41.700
Oh yeah.

27:41.700 --> 27:43.940
Da da da da da da da da.
