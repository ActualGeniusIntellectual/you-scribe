1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Starting the evening off right with an evening coffee.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,760
How do you feel about it, Naomi?

3
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:12,200
Stop having coffee and staying up till like four.

4
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:13,200
Yeah, well.

5
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:14,200
Stop it.

6
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:15,200
I got work to do.

7
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:18,560
Then fucking wake up earlier instead of staying up so late.

8
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:21,800
Hey, you can't swear in the first minute of a YouTube video or else I get demonetized.

9
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:22,800
Oh shit.

10
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,360
You can edit this out.

11
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:27,240
Okay, so I'm here doing a movie thing.

12
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:29,880
Take a little Naomi, by the way, in the movie video artwork.

13
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:30,880
Yeah, it's cute.

14
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:32,240
Yeah, take a little plush.

15
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:36,880
I also appreciate how they have me in sandals because apparently the artist knows how much

16
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:39,400
I hate socks.

17
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:48,320
So ever since Kenobi, I've decided to dip my toes, my little toes into the idea of covering

18
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:51,320
some media, not all media, but like as we know.

19
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:54,160
I wouldn't call them little toes.

20
00:00:54,160 --> 00:01:01,680
I haven't really been a media guy, but when we did Santa ink last year, I kind of wait.

21
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:07,920
I haven't been a media guy used to do anime reviews and also did the film school thing.

22
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:08,920
I know.

23
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:09,920
I know.

24
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:10,920
No, no.

25
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:11,920
I meant in terms of this channel.

26
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:12,920
This channel is always like, here's the thing.

27
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:17,520
People in my sphere of the Internet, they cover like politics and they'll cover drama

28
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,520
and they'll cover media.

29
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:23,720
But in the context of, wow, this show is terrible and there may be a political or a drama reason

30
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:24,720
as to why.

31
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,600
Isn't that why you started doing it?

32
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:27,600
Yeah.

33
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:32,020
I was avoiding that basically until we, you and I watched Santa ink and then earlier we

34
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:37,120
watched cuties and even though cuties sucked and Santa ink sucked, the experience of watching

35
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:40,440
them with you and like doing a video is actually pretty fun.

36
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:42,240
So I was like, maybe I should, I should do this a bit more.

37
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:45,520
So then we did Kenobi and come, he was a big fucking, it was way too big of a project.

38
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:48,240
It's a huge project, but I enjoyed it.

39
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:52,360
And so I was like, Jesus, there's like four awful shows coming out right now.

40
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:57,120
There's the star Wars and or show, which looks okay, but I mean everyone is going to be bad

41
00:01:57,120 --> 00:02:03,000
and it might be Star Wars is always bad, but there is the Lord of the rings, the rings

42
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:10,560
of power show with, with, with Eminem, with Eminem is sour on.

43
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,320
And then there's she Hulk, which I did watch.

44
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:18,760
And Oh my God, watch the first episode and then showed me clips and I was like, why the

45
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:20,240
fuck is this so cringe?

46
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,240
You walked out.

47
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:22,240
With me.

48
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,240
No, no, no.

49
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:29,320
I'm turning it on just for a minute.

50
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:30,520
Okay.

51
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,520
Watch this.

52
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,520
And you're going to cringe instantly.

53
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:33,520
Okay.

54
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:34,920
I'm already cruncher.

55
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:35,920
See you later.

56
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:42,440
Little Gator, bad-ass woman, a Ruth Bader Ginsburg fucking, um, bobblehead.

57
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:49,040
And I am not already, I'm just experiencing why I am right, but that should be you on

58
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,040
a t-shirt.

59
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:54,280
But like this, this entire show is literally just girl boss.

60
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:59,200
And then, um, there was this show, which is the game of Thrones house, host of the dragon

61
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,200
show.

62
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:03,160
The thing about house of the dragon is it kind of snuck up on everyone.

63
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:07,360
Like everyone, I think game of Thrones final season was so God awful.

64
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:10,640
And the last few seasons before that were like so middle of the road compared to like

65
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:15,680
the first five that everyone forgot their show was coming.

66
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:19,320
It looked like shit when the trailers came out like a year or two ago and then everyone

67
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:20,320
forgot.

68
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:21,320
And then it is like, it just, it just, it just happened.

69
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:24,280
Like I, I look on Twitter and it's like, Oh, how's the dragon?

70
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:26,800
So like the day, the day it happened, here's the thing.

71
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,440
I don't think anyone forgot.

72
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:31,860
I think that everyone just got burned by game of Thrones.

73
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:37,560
So fucking bad that they were just like, no, they, the, the entire internet was actually

74
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:39,800
when no, we're not going to pay attention.

75
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:40,800
Yeah.

76
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:48,200
Like the first one of the few times that's happened is this, it's like an inverse Morbius

77
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:52,920
where like they actively willed it into existence again, they actively willed how's the dragon

78
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:53,920
away.

79
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:54,920
Yeah.

80
00:03:54,920 --> 00:04:01,920
Um, I was pleasantly surprised by house of the dragon in that it was like a solid, okay.

81
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,880
It wasn't amazing.

82
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:07,800
It wasn't as good as game of Thrones at its best, but it wasn't, it wasn't, it wasn't,

83
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,160
it wasn't nearly as bad as I thought it was going to be.

84
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:15,360
I am not going to hold out hope just in case, no, no, I do, I see the thing is I've learned

85
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:20,080
over the years that if you have no expectations, you generally feel happier.

86
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:23,300
Is that how you do with me?

87
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:24,300
No comment.

88
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:33,040
No, no, but like I was like, I wasn't exactly pleasantly surprised.

89
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:40,560
Like I had a feeling it was going to be okay and it was okay, but I do not hold out hope

90
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:43,480
that it's going to get as good as game of Thrones did.

91
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:44,560
No, I don't think it will either.

92
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:48,920
But I will say that Matt Smith was not as bad as everyone thought he was going to be.

93
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:51,680
He looked awful in the trailer because like the wig doesn't fit him.

94
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:52,680
His face doesn't really fit.

95
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:53,680
In the trailer or the first episode?

96
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:54,680
Uh, the trailer.

97
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:55,680
Okay.

98
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,920
Cause I was just like, the wig doesn't look that bad in the first episode.

99
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:02,000
You made that comment and I was just like, I mean, to be honest, I have a terrible eye

100
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
for these things.

101
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,400
Like, like apparently I know someone who wears a Japan and I can't tell.

102
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,700
By the way, I guess at this point we should probably get, like we should now probably

103
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:11,920
say we're gonna get into spoilers because we haven't spoiled anything yet.

104
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:12,920
Yeah.

105
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:13,920
Spoilers by the way.

106
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:15,280
Yeah.

107
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,280
Yeah.

108
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:17,280
Now, now click off.

109
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,280
You know what?

110
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:19,280
Don't watch.

111
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,280
Why are you even watching my fucking video?

112
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:21,280
If you, if you don't want to be spoiled.

113
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,280
Fuck you.

114
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,280
Okay.

115
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:27,720
So listen, don't read any of the comments because you're, you're going to get spoiled.

116
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:32,280
I talked to Mauler and Mauler was like, yeah, she Hulk is awful, but, but house of the dragon

117
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:34,240
was actually like, it was a pleasant surprise.

118
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:38,880
I talked to arch and arch was like, no, how's the dragon still awful?

119
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,680
And here, here's the reason that he gave, here's the reason he gave.

120
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:48,680
He said that the, the young princess being kind of like quasi lesbian with her hand,

121
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:53,520
her handmaiden that that that's like progressive shoehorning, which I didn't feel that at all.

122
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:58,560
That just felt like that felt like a more natural lesbian, the relationship than a lot

123
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,560
of the ones that we're getting right now.

124
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:04,640
It would have been shoehorning if, you know, I can't even think of a good example, but

125
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:07,840
give me a good example of lesbian shoehorning.

126
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:16,000
Um, Steven universe, okay, fine.

127
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:21,520
Um, the finale of my little pony, they just made two of the ponies together.

128
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:25,160
I mean, I guess, I don't know though, like every, every time someone talks about shoehorning

129
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:27,880
stuff in like it, but they just give an example.

130
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:29,280
That's just a surprise.

131
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:33,520
It just happened off screen and I'm like, yeah, that's bad, but I've never really felt

132
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:34,520
like a shoehorning.

133
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:38,440
It's like, like you wouldn't have the same comment if two of the characters were a guy

134
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:41,580
and a girl and still got together, you know?

135
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:42,580
That's true.

136
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:46,720
So I never feel like it's shoehorning when someone like, I agree that it's bad because

137
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,280
it happened off screen.

138
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:55,920
Well, also like, like there's, there's the stereotype of girl power, we're together and

139
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:58,240
fuck the patriarchy, which the show didn't really do.

140
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,240
No.

141
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:00,240
Yeah.

142
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:03,580
Like I think that would have been in this show specifically a more like, obviously she's

143
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:10,780
going to her and her beautiful lover who is a, who is another lady or fucking gonna

144
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:14,940
like plan to kill the king or they're like Mary Sue their way out of some.

145
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:15,940
They didn't do that.

146
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:16,940
No.

147
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:17,940
Yeah.

148
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:18,940
That's the second thing though.

149
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:22,180
Is that Arch, Arch, I think Arch called her a Mary Sue or something similar to it because

150
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:25,940
we are told that she's intelligent, but we aren't shown.

151
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:26,940
And I'm like, hold on.

152
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:30,860
No, we are shown that she's intelligent because there's that they do the exact scene with

153
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:35,300
her, that in the first episode of Game of Thrones, they did with Bran.

154
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:37,780
So you will go all the way back to the first season Game of Thrones.

155
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:41,640
There's, there's a, there's a scene where Bran is sitting around and he's being taught

156
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:46,180
by the Maester and he's like, you have to say, what, what, what, what's the house?

157
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:48,020
What's the, is it Bran or Arya?

158
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:49,020
It's one of the two.

159
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:50,700
But anyway, it's like, what, what's the house?

160
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:51,700
Arya.

161
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:52,700
Is it Arya?

162
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:53,700
Okay.

163
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:54,700
Well, either way.

164
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:55,700
No, but the name, you said Arya, Arya.

165
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:56,700
Okay.

166
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:59,840
Anyway, the Maester was like, okay, what's the house and what's, what's their sigil.

167
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:02,600
And you have to, you have to know all this stuff because it's important.

168
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:06,760
And the person, whichever, whichever, whichever person, whichever kid, whichever kid it was,

169
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:08,120
I was like, yeah, I know this already.

170
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:10,920
I know what I know and like didn't care.

171
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:11,920
And the Maester was like, yeah, take this seriously.

172
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:12,920
He's like, I already know it.

173
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,560
And then like, and like, they just rattle it off, right?

174
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:19,760
They did a very similar scene where they're lying in the Godswood and the, it's not the

175
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:22,360
Godswood, it's just a tree, isn't it?

176
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:27,760
I don't remember anything about Game of Thrones, any of the names anymore, but you know, this

177
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:30,040
episode, they were lying in the forest.

178
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,040
Okay.

179
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:37,920
And, and they had the book open and the princess was like, I already know this stuff.

180
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:39,720
And the handmaiden was like, you have to know this stuff.

181
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:40,720
And then she's like, all right.

182
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,040
And then she just rattled it off.

183
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:46,800
It's the same scene and it's meant to show that she's actually intelligent.

184
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:47,800
She just doesn't care.

185
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:48,800
She's not stupid.

186
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:52,520
Some people are saying that she is being treated like a Mary Sue and I don't think so.

187
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:53,840
I disagree with that statement.

188
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:58,600
I think that they definitely, they definitely established her as one, being neglected by

189
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:02,040
her father and two, therefore being rebellious.

190
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:05,640
And three, she seems to be quite naturally intelligent and they, they showed all of that.

191
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:07,880
They didn't, it wasn't, it wasn't a problem of show, not tell.

192
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:08,880
They showed that.

193
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:12,520
Let's do a quick TLDR of the show's plot.

194
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:13,520
Okay.

195
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:18,880
You have the king and he's, he's, he's not really a weak king necessarily, but he has

196
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:21,440
like his problems and they seem to be kind of getting to him.

197
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:26,720
You have his wife, his wife, the queen, and she's been, she's pregnant and she's trying

198
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:30,880
to give him an heir cause he doesn't have any male male heirs.

199
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:36,060
You have his brother and his brother is, is the prince and he's next in line since the

200
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:40,080
king can't produce a male heir and the brother's kind of sadistic and he seems to be kind of

201
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,320
a bad apple.

202
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:46,000
And then you have his daughter and his daughter is the princess and the prince, this is the

203
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,600
intelligent, you know, not a Mary Sue, but people are calling her a Mary Sue lesbian

204
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:51,600
character.

205
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,600
Okay.

206
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:53,600
Maybe lesbian.

207
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,600
Maybe.

208
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,600
There's, there's hints.

209
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,600
There's hints of it.

210
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:57,600
You think they're slamming clams?

211
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:03,440
Well, here's the thing to like broach off until like, since we're doing a TLDR to broach

212
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:09,980
off and do a different part of it is that like there's hints of it, but also the character

213
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:13,600
that there's hints with seems to be very much into dudes.

214
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:17,760
Well, they both seem to be into dudes, they just all seem to be into each other.

215
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:22,920
I could, I mean, I guess, but it's, it's, I like how you're bi and you're like being

216
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:23,920
bi is unsatisfying.

217
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:24,920
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

218
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:25,920
I'm not saying it's not satisfying.

219
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:30,020
I'm saying that because Hollywood forgets that bi characters exist unless they are shoe

220
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:31,240
horning them in for some reason.

221
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:32,240
Sometimes.

222
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,240
Yeah.

223
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,240
All the fucking time.

224
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,600
But to be fair, Game of Thrones is pretty good about that generally, about not doing

225
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:37,600
that shit.

226
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:38,600
Yes.

227
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:39,600
But this Game of Thrones is bad.

228
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,600
So, okay.

229
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:41,600
I, I, yeah.

230
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:45,160
So who the fuck knows?

231
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,280
The story is basically they're trying to have an heir.

232
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:52,640
The king is very much like, I need a fucking heir, dude.

233
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,960
And like, there's like a bunch of tension surrounding this.

234
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:55,960
Yeah.

235
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:58,740
They hold a tournament and the tournament is supposed to be to celebrate the birth of

236
00:10:58,740 --> 00:10:59,740
his child.

237
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:00,740
Yeah.

238
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:01,740
Cause the wife is like almost due.

239
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:03,440
Her belly is big and super gross.

240
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:04,440
Yeah.

241
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:07,760
No offense to pregnant woman.

242
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:10,520
I just, I can't, I can't.

243
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:14,220
So they, she goes into labor during the tournament.

244
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:15,980
It goes poorly.

245
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:17,820
They have to cut it out of her.

246
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:18,820
Okay.

247
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:19,820
That was a graphic scene.

248
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:20,820
That was a really graphic scene.

249
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:23,340
And it was legitimately upsetting.

250
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:24,340
Yeah.

251
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:25,340
To watch.

252
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:26,340
Holy shit.

253
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:27,340
Yeah.

254
00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:32,980
Like if, if you or your girlfriend, uh, like are not okay with like really graphic, like

255
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:42,060
harm to pregnant woman, you might want to like kind of fast forward through that scene.

256
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:43,340
But it's a long, long scene.

257
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:44,340
It's actually pretty long scene.

258
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:45,340
Yeah.

259
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:46,340
There's a lot of blood.

260
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:47,340
Yeah.

261
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:49,020
Because they cut into parts of the really graphic part.

262
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:50,800
You'll know it when it starts to come up.

263
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:54,120
The really graphic part, two parts in the tourney, which is also graphic, but honestly

264
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:55,120
was better.

265
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,120
Yeah.

266
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:59,380
We're like beating guys faces and like cutting off their hands and shit and it's not as graphic

267
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:00,380
as the pregnancy scene.

268
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:02,060
No, like it was extremely upsetting.

269
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:08,240
Like you guys just heard me say, I don't like, I know I was like, I was not okay.

270
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:12,260
I was totally, but like you guys just heard me say that I did not like the look of pregnant

271
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:16,140
woman's bellies and I'm still just like, holy shit, that was really upsetting.

272
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:18,980
Well yeah.

273
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:20,400
So they have to cut it out of her.

274
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:21,400
She dies.

275
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:23,180
The baby survives a bit, but dies.

276
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:24,180
Yep.

277
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:28,420
And so this is like a major tragedy for the kingdom and the kingdom is kind of falling

278
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:30,340
apart and there's no air.

279
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:34,420
And however, the air, the, the, the legal air, you know, the council comes together

280
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:37,440
and was like, listen, you can't have your legal air be your brother because he's fucking

281
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,440
crazy dude.

282
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:42,220
Because, because what happened earlier was that there was, um, he, he, he, he, he, he

283
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:47,260
is, he is the Lord commander of the gold cloaks, which is the city watch, which is new.

284
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:48,260
It's new.

285
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:51,820
And at this point of the history, it's, it's a 172 years before the original game show.

286
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:53,820
And we don't remember anyone's names by the way.

287
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:54,820
Sorry.

288
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:57,180
Damon was the, but I don't remember anyone's name.

289
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:58,180
Anyone else?

290
00:12:58,180 --> 00:12:59,180
Yeah.

291
00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:00,180
I don't know anyone's names.

292
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:01,420
I barely, I didn't even remember his name to who said it.

293
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:02,420
I don't know anyone's names.

294
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:06,700
Well, anyway, anyway, there's a, there's a scene where like in order to prepare for the

295
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:11,180
tourney, uh, he, he gets all the gold cloaks and they go out into King's landing.

296
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:12,860
They find all the murderers and kill them.

297
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:16,460
They find all the rapists and castrate them and they find all the thieves and chop their

298
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:17,740
hands off.

299
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:21,020
And then the council is like, dude, you got to get hold of your brother because he's going

300
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:22,460
way too fucking far with this stuff.

301
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:29,040
He's going so far that they needed a cart pulled by two horses to drag all the fucking

302
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:31,340
corpses and bodies and parts away.

303
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:32,340
Yeah.

304
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:33,340
Fuck.

305
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:34,340
Like that actually made me laugh.

306
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:41,120
That was, that was just like, so, um, they're like, listen,

307
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:45,780
you can't, you can't have your brother be this crazy.

308
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:46,780
He can't be the king.

309
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:48,160
If you die, like he can't be your heir.

310
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,560
And the King's like, he's still my brother.

311
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:52,640
And then like his brother goes off and celebrates with the gold cloaks.

312
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:58,100
He celebrates the death of the King's newborn son by calling him.

313
00:13:58,100 --> 00:13:59,100
Was it air for a minute?

314
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:00,480
No, it was air for a day.

315
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:01,480
Air for a day.

316
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:02,480
Yep.

317
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:05,160
And then the King finds out, the King finds out he's really pissed.

318
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:06,160
He's royally pissed.

319
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:07,160
Royally pissed.

320
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:13,800
And so he banishes him back to Dragonstone and then name, yes, he does.

321
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:14,800
Isn't Dragonstone?

322
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:17,080
No, it was back to the Vale with his wife.

323
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:19,720
Well, either way you banishes him.

324
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:24,840
And then the King names his daughter for the first time, the first time a woman gets to

325
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:25,840
do it.

326
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:28,580
His daughter is now the heir to the throne.

327
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:33,180
And then the King is like, listen, dude, uh, here's the secret passed on from all the Kings

328
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:39,260
is that one day in maybe 172 years from now, we are going to have to fight the White Walkers.

329
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:40,260
No.

330
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:41,260
Okay.

331
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:42,260
No.

332
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:47,220
And also, and the King is like also by the way, uh, this entire prophecy that I'm passing

333
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:50,540
on to you is actually completely false because Arya kills him anyway with, with, with the

334
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:51,540
dagger.

335
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:52,540
Yeah.

336
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:54,820
Actually, I think that's going to be a thing because if you notice the King had the dagger

337
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:59,660
that Arya used to stab him, what the King actually said is that the first Targaryen

338
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:04,820
King of Westeros had a dream and the dream is a prophecy and it's that winter is coming

339
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:09,100
and that there's going to be the army of darkness will march down from the North, which is by

340
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:10,420
the way, what happens in Game of Thrones.

341
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:12,220
I don't think he actually said army.

342
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:15,260
He just, he literally just said the darkness is going to come from the North.

343
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:19,740
He was actually super vague about it, which I appreciated, but the cringey part was what

344
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:20,980
the prophecy was called.

345
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:22,660
It was called the Song of Ice and Fire.

346
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:23,660
It was cringey.

347
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:27,260
But that's what called the prophecy that that's what it was called in the original books.

348
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:28,260
Okay.

349
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:29,860
And it's like a medieval.

350
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:30,860
George R.R. Martin.

351
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:31,940
That's cringey as fuck.

352
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:34,500
Don't call the prophecy that well, that's, that's why the book series called the Song

353
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:35,500
of Ice and Fire.

354
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:40,260
If you can just call it a Song of Ice and Fire and then not have the prophecy be named

355
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:41,260
that that's just cringey.

356
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:43,460
It just sounds like a terrible name for a prophecy.

357
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:45,420
That's my issue with it.

358
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:47,580
Everything was recorded in ballads and poetry and stuff.

359
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:48,580
So it makes sense.

360
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:49,580
I don't care.

361
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:51,060
It's just like, you just dislike the medieval times.

362
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:52,060
You know what?

363
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:54,060
I've never, I've never been to medieval times ever.

364
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:55,060
Okay.

365
00:15:55,060 --> 00:15:56,060
I'll go without you.

366
00:15:56,060 --> 00:15:57,060
Not allowed.

367
00:15:57,060 --> 00:15:58,060
Fuck a hot lady.

368
00:15:58,860 --> 00:15:59,860
Fuck you.

369
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:00,860
Okay.

370
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:06,860
Um, so yeah, like that's the TLDR of the plot and I don't know, like the, the actors that

371
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:10,860
they chose for the roles, they seem to be not quite right.

372
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:11,860
Each of them.

373
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:12,860
Yeah.

374
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:18,620
It's like the princess, the King, the brother, they all, they all like it strangely feels

375
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:24,540
not like the thing with the Game of Thrones, the one I think, I think one of the reasons

376
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:29,100
why everyone liked it so much is because with the first episode you were just drawn

377
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:34,380
into that world, like with the actors and the sets and the, I think still kind of bad

378
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:35,380
CGI back then.

379
00:16:35,380 --> 00:16:38,060
It has some better CGI's that went on.

380
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:39,060
There was bad CGI in this.

381
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:40,060
Holy fuck.

382
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:41,060
The cart, the backgrounds.

383
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:42,060
Yeah.

384
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:43,060
Who?

385
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:44,060
Yeah.

386
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:48,180
You just get drawn into the world because of how like lived in and grungy and like everything,

387
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:52,340
how people looked, you know, and like how they sounded and how they acted.

388
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:55,900
I think it was because like in the original Game of Thrones, they were pretty high tier

389
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:59,060
actors and these ones, they probably aren't so high tier.

390
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:03,620
Again, probably budget issues, like except technically Matt Smith, I guess.

391
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:08,280
I think part of it though, is also the fact that in the first episode of Game of Thrones,

392
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:10,700
you have, you get to see everyone's perspective.

393
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:11,700
Okay.

394
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:13,300
You get to see high born and low born characters.

395
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:18,300
There's Kings and princes and there's princesses and there's Queens and there's Royal ladies,

396
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:21,300
but then you also get to see, yep, there's bastard.

397
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:25,700
You get to hang out with Jon Snow, you get to hang out with Tyrion, with Theon, you get

398
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:29,060
to hang out with Arya when she's like running around, and Bran when they're like running

399
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:32,540
around with like basically being street rats.

400
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:37,900
Like there's instances where we get to see the points of view of people who aren't royalty,

401
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:40,580
even if they might be a little bit.

402
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:43,020
And there's also non-royal characters directly as well.

403
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:44,020
Yeah.

404
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:45,020
Like the prostitutes.

405
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:47,580
But in this show, there's not much of that.

406
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:48,580
It's all...

407
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:50,060
It was only the prostitutes.

408
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:55,660
It's all like court drama, which is fine, but you need to establish the world first.

409
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:58,980
Like if this was a standalone show and they hadn't made Game of Thrones, this wouldn't

410
00:17:58,980 --> 00:17:59,980
have gone anywhere.

411
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:00,980
Yes, I agree.

412
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:06,460
I think, because that's the thing to branch off also, a lot of the first episode felt

413
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:07,460
really rushed.

414
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:08,460
Like it felt like a lot of stuff.

415
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:10,460
Like it was like, what, an hour long?

416
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:11,460
How long was it?

417
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:12,460
It was an hour long.

418
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:13,460
Yeah.

419
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:14,460
It felt like, and that's the thing though, it was an hour.

420
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:15,460
A lot of stuff happens.

421
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:18,540
Well, to be fair, a lot of stuff happened in the first episode of Game of Thrones.

422
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:23,540
It didn't feel rushed is my point.

423
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:24,540
I don't think this felt rushed.

424
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:25,540
It did to me.

425
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:26,540
I don't think so.

426
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:27,920
It felt like a lot of stuff just like happened.

427
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:36,540
And I think that to fix the, like not having commoner issues problem is to not banish Daemon

428
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:42,680
before the first episode and have him like be, while kind of a crazy person, like show

429
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:45,660
his interpersonal relationships a bit with the commoners.

430
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:46,660
Like episode two.

431
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:47,660
Yeah.

432
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:55,780
Because he made the comment when he was in the council meeting that none of them left

433
00:18:55,780 --> 00:18:56,780
the Red Keep.

434
00:18:56,780 --> 00:18:58,620
Except for him because he's the city commander.

435
00:18:58,620 --> 00:19:02,660
To go down and like be around the commoners is one of the reasons he stated that he had

436
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:05,300
to like fucking do all the shit that he did.

437
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:07,300
Which is a bit of a, a bit of a cope.

438
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:08,300
I know what you mean.

439
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:12,100
I think that would have actually solved an issue because it felt really rushed.

440
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:13,100
I don't know.

441
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:15,660
You guys got to go watch it and tell me if you agree with me, but it felt rushed.

442
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:19,340
You could have had him like be banished by the end of the second episode.

443
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:22,060
But I understand the point of view is that they wanted to get the main conflict of the

444
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:25,540
show started, which was going to be, by the way, the civil war that is already in the

445
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:26,620
lore of the book.

446
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:30,540
So they're doing that story of the civil war between the King's brother and the King's

447
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:31,540
daughter.

448
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:35,700
So they wanted to make that the central story of the show.

449
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:40,220
So they wanted to actually show the event that kicked it off, which is the death of

450
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:41,220
the Queen.

451
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:47,500
The fact that there's no male heir and then Damon, even though he is like, here's the

452
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:48,500
thing.

453
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:49,500
He's clearly a bad person.

454
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:50,500
Yeah.

455
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:53,740
He's not good, but he made a good point when he was having his final discussion with the

456
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:57,580
King where it's like, listen, I'm your family.

457
00:19:57,580 --> 00:19:59,980
Everyone else in the council is just sucking up to you and not telling you the truth, which

458
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:03,420
actually seems to be the truth, which was correct for a thing.

459
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:07,780
I actually don't want to spoil because it's pretty good, but like that happened before

460
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:10,140
that scene where it's like, Oh, I was like, Oh, I didn't say it out loud, but I was like,

461
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:12,540
Oh my God, look, he's right showing all the points.

462
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:14,540
And they already showed that that was good storytelling guys.

463
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:15,540
Yes.

464
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:16,540
Yes, it was.

465
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:20,540
Even though Damon is not a good person, there are still moments where it's like, listen,

466
00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:23,900
you might be making a mistake sending him out in the cold, especially because he's dangerous.

467
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:24,900
Yeah.

468
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:28,900
Like it was, it was a weird feeling of like, he's very obviously not a good person, but

469
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:34,300
also just like, Oh, cute moments with niece, you know, like, like trying to like protect

470
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:37,460
his brother and obviously feeling, um, uh,

471
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:38,460
yeah.

472
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:39,460
Yeah.

473
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:43,260
No, by his brother before the banishment, right?

474
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:47,660
Cause he, cause he had said that, you know, you haven't made me your hand with what, why

475
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:48,660
you,

476
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:49,660
yeah.

477
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:50,660
Yeah.

478
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:55,740
And that's one thing that I think the show did very well is that it, it had that, it

479
00:20:55,740 --> 00:21:01,980
had that it has those gray characters that Game of Thrones is really well known for care.

480
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:04,760
Like no one's really good and no one's really evil.

481
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:08,480
Like you have characters that are more evil than good for sure, but everyone has,

482
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:13,200
they're small moments of you sympathize and then you're just, you look at yourself and

483
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,200
be like, what the fuck?

484
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:15,200
Why did I sympathize?

485
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:21,240
Meanwhile, when you have fucking She-Hulk where She-Hulk is just right, where She-Hulk

486
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:29,740
is just correct in every circumstance and the Hulk is just considered like a fucking

487
00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:34,260
moron even though he's been doing this for over, Oh God, that show was bad.

488
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:37,900
So actually you're not talking about, no, we're not, no, we're not.

489
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:38,900
Here's the thing.

490
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:39,900
Here's the thing.

491
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:45,800
Um, I expected to have to be like, Oh God, we got to make a terrible fucking video on

492
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:49,720
how bad house, house of the dragon is like how I'm probably gonna make one and She-Hulk

493
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:52,140
eventually or on that halo show.

494
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:53,140
Oh God.

495
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:54,140
You know what?

496
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:55,140
I'll finish watching.

497
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:56,140
Fuck you.

498
00:21:56,140 --> 00:21:57,580
We watched the first episode of the halo show and then we walked out and she's like, this

499
00:21:57,580 --> 00:21:58,580
is so fucking bad.

500
00:21:58,580 --> 00:21:59,580
So fucking bad.

501
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:00,580
You know what's funny?

502
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:01,580
You love halo.

503
00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:02,580
Well, yes.

504
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:03,580
To, to a degree.

505
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:08,580
Not as much as people who play halo all the time.

506
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:12,420
I have a good, I have a few good memories of halo and so I do enjoy the games.

507
00:22:12,420 --> 00:22:17,840
But anyway, um, I will say this about halo since dev decided to mention She-Hulk is that

508
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:23,540
I think it would have been an okay series if it hadn't had the name brand halo and all

509
00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:24,540
the halo things.

510
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:25,540
I don't know about that.

511
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:26,540
I think it would have.

512
00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:27,540
I didn't think good.

513
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:28,540
I said, okay.

514
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:31,740
Anyway, what ruined it was that it said it was halo and it wasn't.

515
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:37,980
So my point is though, is that I was expecting to have to make a review or a video on how

516
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:42,660
awful house the dragon is and here's how bad the CG is and here's how they ruined this

517
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:44,360
and here's how they ruined that.

518
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:47,380
And there might even even been a political element to it where you get like the get woke,

519
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:49,280
go broke thing.

520
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:52,780
But we're talking about it like this right now in a more off the cuff manner where it's

521
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:56,660
not an edited video because I was pleasantly surprised.

522
00:22:56,660 --> 00:22:58,020
I can actually recommend it to you.

523
00:22:58,020 --> 00:22:59,580
I can say, you know what?

524
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:03,580
Even though every single fucking thing coming out, whether it's a re a reboot or a remake

525
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:07,620
or a sequel, no one wanted or a rehash or even just a new show, even though they all

526
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:12,740
fucking suck every single one of them, I can actually recommend this.

527
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:17,380
And so I'm not going to do any sort of big in depth review unless, unless the show like

528
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:20,840
craters in the next few weeks, I'm not going to do any sort of big in depth review like

529
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:21,840
Kenobi or anything.

530
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:24,340
I think I'm going to say you should watch this one.

531
00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:25,340
Yeah.

532
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:31,740
I mean, I do recommend it, but I also part of I'm, I'm, I'm torn because part of me wants

533
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:34,180
to recommend it and be like, give the show a chance.

534
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:38,180
So they get a better budget and can do better CGI.

535
00:23:38,180 --> 00:23:39,180
Give peace a chance.

536
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:45,040
However, however, I also don't want to recommend it because the show is okay and it's going

537
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:46,860
to do either one of two things.

538
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:50,300
One is going to get better and that means it's going to be better than game of thrones,

539
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:53,740
which is just going to make me sad because game of thrones is really good and then got

540
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:59,180
torn to torn asunder or, or it's going to go real bad.

541
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:06,220
I'm going to go real, real bad and I'll be like, I can't watch anything anymore.

542
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:12,100
Well we watched anything on, we watched Star Trek, strange new worlds and we were both

543
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:14,180
surprised that that show was actually good too.

544
00:24:14,180 --> 00:24:17,460
Yeah, but even by the end you're like, Oh, this is a good show.

545
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:18,460
I'll go all the way through.

546
00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:19,460
It was a good show.

547
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:23,620
It was still like, yeah, but like it was still only on par with like the okay episodes of

548
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:25,340
TNG.

549
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:27,500
That's pretty good for compared to fucking Picard.

550
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:28,500
Yeah.

551
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:29,500
Well you know what?

552
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:32,860
My fucking view wouldn't be so fucking destroyed if you hadn't made me watch Picard.

553
00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:33,860
That was a fun time.

554
00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:35,220
We never ever watched Picard.

555
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:36,700
We should do a Picard video.

556
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:37,700
Fuck you.

557
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:40,420
No, I refuse to live through any of that ever again.

558
00:24:40,420 --> 00:24:41,420
My soul hurts.

559
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:42,700
You're just talking about it.

560
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:44,380
No, my soul hurts.

561
00:24:44,380 --> 00:24:47,340
I have actually like mostly gotten rid of most of Picard.

562
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:48,780
I don't remember most of it anymore.

563
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:53,060
Remember the part when like the autistic girl is the Vogue queen?

564
00:24:53,980 --> 00:24:59,540
There was, there was actually an article put out where the showrunner of strange new worlds

565
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:05,740
pitched the show to the studio by saying, why don't we just do the classic Star Trek?

566
00:25:05,740 --> 00:25:11,780
Like you don't need some kind of big long, you know, like, so you don't need some kind

567
00:25:11,780 --> 00:25:15,900
of huge plot where the entire galaxy, the entire universe is at stake and there's like

568
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:18,900
constant Starship battles and crazy shit going on.

569
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:22,180
And at last the entire, just do standalone episodes.

570
00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:29,460
And have like a reasonably well liked cast doing adventures every single day and resolving

571
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:31,020
them by the end of the adventure.

572
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:34,420
And maybe you have a little morality tale in there, or maybe it's like a little science

573
00:25:34,420 --> 00:25:39,100
fiction thing, or maybe it's like a puzzle problem, like whatever, but they just do Star

574
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:40,100
Trek.

575
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:41,100
And that's what they did.

576
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:42,100
And it was good.

577
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:43,100
Yes.

578
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:45,300
But they also do, they do do this more modern storytelling thing that I do enjoy of they

579
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:50,540
have episodic episodes that are small tie-ins to past episodes because there's one character

580
00:25:50,540 --> 00:25:51,860
who dies and he's actually gone.

581
00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:52,860
Yeah.

582
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:55,740
Like they're, they're, they're small tie-ins and I've always enjoyed it.

583
00:25:55,740 --> 00:25:59,860
I like how modern shows have done that cause I found a lot of old shows just don't do that.

584
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:01,740
They're so episodically, nothing ever changes.

585
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:04,020
And it annoys me so much.

586
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:08,300
I mean, that was the big problem with Voyagers that it got too episodic where like, Villana

587
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:12,820
Torres was dealing with being half-cling on the entire seven fucking years of the show.

588
00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:16,700
And that got old pretty fucking quick after you did it like 10 times.

589
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:17,700
Yeah.

590
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:20,700
Anyway, Host of the Dragon is okay.

591
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:21,700
It's okay.

592
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:22,700
You know what?

593
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:26,180
I'm not really gonna, I'm not going to do a video on it unless it like massively tanks

594
00:26:26,180 --> 00:26:27,820
in the next few episodes.

595
00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:29,620
I think I, I think I will wait.

596
00:26:29,620 --> 00:26:33,220
I'll talk about She-Hulk probably at some point and how terrible that is.

597
00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:37,100
And I'll probably talk about, um, we all know Lord of the Rings, Rings of Power is going

598
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:38,100
to be fucking abysmal.

599
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:39,100
I don't want to watch it.

600
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:40,100
Oh my God.

601
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:41,100
It's going to be abysmal.

602
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:44,100
I haven't even watched the, like the new quote unquote movies yet.

603
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:45,100
Here's the thing.

604
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:47,300
Like our arch movies, I haven't seen them.

605
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:51,020
I think like Arch and Kibbs and Lilith and I are going to do like a four person watch

606
00:26:51,020 --> 00:26:53,480
party of, of Rings of Power.

607
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:54,480
You guys should.

608
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:58,540
I, you, you watch the first episode and then tell me how it is and I will give it a chance

609
00:26:58,540 --> 00:27:01,220
because honestly I just, I'll just say it's great.

610
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:03,340
And then it'll be fucking like so bad.

611
00:27:03,340 --> 00:27:08,500
Don't kick the computer and then you'll be single.

612
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:14,260
Anyway, um, if you like Game of Thrones, give Host of the Dragon a chance.

613
00:27:14,260 --> 00:27:15,260
It's not bad.

614
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:19,620
This is the first episode that we're doing this in, so give at least the first episode

615
00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:20,620
a chance.

616
00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:21,620
Give it, give it a chance.

617
00:27:21,620 --> 00:27:27,220
And you'll have to forgive it for the terrible CGI because I don't care about those sort

618
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:32,380
of things because I watched terrible looking anime because I do things I'm not allowed

619
00:27:32,380 --> 00:27:33,380
to talk about on YouTube.

620
00:27:33,380 --> 00:27:36,060
I guess that's the end.

621
00:27:36,060 --> 00:27:39,100
How does, how does Red Letter Media usually end these things?

622
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:40,700
By throwing beer at things.

623
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:41,700
Oh yeah.

624
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:43,940
Da da da da da da da da.
