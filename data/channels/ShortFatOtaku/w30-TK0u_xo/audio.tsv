0	8000	Starting the evening off right with an evening coffee.
8000	9760	How do you feel about it, Naomi?
9760	12200	Stop having coffee and staying up till like four.
12200	13200	Yeah, well.
13200	14200	Stop it.
14200	15200	I got work to do.
15200	18560	Then fucking wake up earlier instead of staying up so late.
18560	21800	Hey, you can't swear in the first minute of a YouTube video or else I get demonetized.
21800	22800	Oh shit.
22800	24360	You can edit this out.
24360	27240	Okay, so I'm here doing a movie thing.
27240	29880	Take a little Naomi, by the way, in the movie video artwork.
29880	30880	Yeah, it's cute.
30880	32240	Yeah, take a little plush.
32240	36880	I also appreciate how they have me in sandals because apparently the artist knows how much
36880	39400	I hate socks.
39400	48320	So ever since Kenobi, I've decided to dip my toes, my little toes into the idea of covering
48320	51320	some media, not all media, but like as we know.
51320	54160	I wouldn't call them little toes.
54160	61680	I haven't really been a media guy, but when we did Santa ink last year, I kind of wait.
61680	67920	I haven't been a media guy used to do anime reviews and also did the film school thing.
67920	68920	I know.
68920	69920	I know.
69920	70920	No, no.
70920	71920	I meant in terms of this channel.
71920	72920	This channel is always like, here's the thing.
72920	77520	People in my sphere of the Internet, they cover like politics and they'll cover drama
77520	79520	and they'll cover media.
79520	83720	But in the context of, wow, this show is terrible and there may be a political or a drama reason
83720	84720	as to why.
84720	86600	Isn't that why you started doing it?
86600	87600	Yeah.
87600	92020	I was avoiding that basically until we, you and I watched Santa ink and then earlier we
92020	97120	watched cuties and even though cuties sucked and Santa ink sucked, the experience of watching
97120	100440	them with you and like doing a video is actually pretty fun.
100440	102240	So I was like, maybe I should, I should do this a bit more.
102240	105520	So then we did Kenobi and come, he was a big fucking, it was way too big of a project.
105520	108240	It's a huge project, but I enjoyed it.
108240	112360	And so I was like, Jesus, there's like four awful shows coming out right now.
112360	117120	There's the star Wars and or show, which looks okay, but I mean everyone is going to be bad
117120	123000	and it might be Star Wars is always bad, but there is the Lord of the rings, the rings
123000	130560	of power show with, with, with Eminem, with Eminem is sour on.
130560	133320	And then there's she Hulk, which I did watch.
133320	138760	And Oh my God, watch the first episode and then showed me clips and I was like, why the
138760	140240	fuck is this so cringe?
140240	141240	You walked out.
141240	142240	With me.
142240	143240	No, no, no.
143240	149320	I'm turning it on just for a minute.
149320	150520	Okay.
150520	151520	Watch this.
151520	152520	And you're going to cringe instantly.
152520	153520	Okay.
153520	154920	I'm already cruncher.
154920	155920	See you later.
155920	162440	Little Gator, bad-ass woman, a Ruth Bader Ginsburg fucking, um, bobblehead.
162440	169040	And I am not already, I'm just experiencing why I am right, but that should be you on
169040	170040	a t-shirt.
170040	174280	But like this, this entire show is literally just girl boss.
174280	179200	And then, um, there was this show, which is the game of Thrones house, host of the dragon
179200	180200	show.
180200	183160	The thing about house of the dragon is it kind of snuck up on everyone.
183160	187360	Like everyone, I think game of Thrones final season was so God awful.
187360	190640	And the last few seasons before that were like so middle of the road compared to like
190640	195680	the first five that everyone forgot their show was coming.
195680	199320	It looked like shit when the trailers came out like a year or two ago and then everyone
199320	200320	forgot.
200320	201320	And then it is like, it just, it just, it just happened.
201320	204280	Like I, I look on Twitter and it's like, Oh, how's the dragon?
204280	206800	So like the day, the day it happened, here's the thing.
206800	208440	I don't think anyone forgot.
208440	211860	I think that everyone just got burned by game of Thrones.
211860	217560	So fucking bad that they were just like, no, they, the, the entire internet was actually
217560	219800	when no, we're not going to pay attention.
219800	220800	Yeah.
220800	228200	Like the first one of the few times that's happened is this, it's like an inverse Morbius
228200	232920	where like they actively willed it into existence again, they actively willed how's the dragon
232920	233920	away.
233920	234920	Yeah.
234920	241920	Um, I was pleasantly surprised by house of the dragon in that it was like a solid, okay.
241920	243880	It wasn't amazing.
243880	247800	It wasn't as good as game of Thrones at its best, but it wasn't, it wasn't, it wasn't,
247800	249160	it wasn't nearly as bad as I thought it was going to be.
249160	255360	I am not going to hold out hope just in case, no, no, I do, I see the thing is I've learned
255360	260080	over the years that if you have no expectations, you generally feel happier.
260080	263300	Is that how you do with me?
263300	264300	No comment.
264300	273040	No, no, but like I was like, I wasn't exactly pleasantly surprised.
273040	280560	Like I had a feeling it was going to be okay and it was okay, but I do not hold out hope
280560	283480	that it's going to get as good as game of Thrones did.
283480	284560	No, I don't think it will either.
284560	288920	But I will say that Matt Smith was not as bad as everyone thought he was going to be.
288920	291680	He looked awful in the trailer because like the wig doesn't fit him.
291680	292680	His face doesn't really fit.
292680	293680	In the trailer or the first episode?
293680	294680	Uh, the trailer.
294680	295680	Okay.
295680	297920	Cause I was just like, the wig doesn't look that bad in the first episode.
297920	302000	You made that comment and I was just like, I mean, to be honest, I have a terrible eye
302000	303000	for these things.
303000	306400	Like, like apparently I know someone who wears a Japan and I can't tell.
306400	308700	By the way, I guess at this point we should probably get, like we should now probably
308700	311920	say we're gonna get into spoilers because we haven't spoiled anything yet.
311920	312920	Yeah.
312920	313920	Spoilers by the way.
314280	315280	Yeah.
315280	316280	Yeah.
316280	317280	Now, now click off.
317280	318280	You know what?
318280	319280	Don't watch.
319280	320280	Why are you even watching my fucking video?
320280	321280	If you, if you don't want to be spoiled.
321280	322280	Fuck you.
322280	323280	Okay.
323280	327720	So listen, don't read any of the comments because you're, you're going to get spoiled.
327720	332280	I talked to Mauler and Mauler was like, yeah, she Hulk is awful, but, but house of the dragon
332280	334240	was actually like, it was a pleasant surprise.
334240	338880	I talked to arch and arch was like, no, how's the dragon still awful?
338880	341680	And here, here's the reason that he gave, here's the reason he gave.
341680	348680	He said that the, the young princess being kind of like quasi lesbian with her hand,
348680	353520	her handmaiden that that that's like progressive shoehorning, which I didn't feel that at all.
353520	358560	That just felt like that felt like a more natural lesbian, the relationship than a lot
358560	359560	of the ones that we're getting right now.
359560	364640	It would have been shoehorning if, you know, I can't even think of a good example, but
364640	367840	give me a good example of lesbian shoehorning.
367840	376000	Um, Steven universe, okay, fine.
376000	381520	Um, the finale of my little pony, they just made two of the ponies together.
381520	385160	I mean, I guess, I don't know though, like every, every time someone talks about shoehorning
385160	387880	stuff in like it, but they just give an example.
387880	389280	That's just a surprise.
389280	393520	It just happened off screen and I'm like, yeah, that's bad, but I've never really felt
393520	394520	like a shoehorning.
394520	398440	It's like, like you wouldn't have the same comment if two of the characters were a guy
398440	401580	and a girl and still got together, you know?
401580	402580	That's true.
402580	406720	So I never feel like it's shoehorning when someone like, I agree that it's bad because
406720	408280	it happened off screen.
408280	415920	Well, also like, like there's, there's the stereotype of girl power, we're together and
415920	418240	fuck the patriarchy, which the show didn't really do.
418240	419240	No.
419240	420240	Yeah.
420240	423580	Like I think that would have been in this show specifically a more like, obviously she's
423580	430780	going to her and her beautiful lover who is a, who is another lady or fucking gonna
430780	434940	like plan to kill the king or they're like Mary Sue their way out of some.
434940	435940	They didn't do that.
435940	436940	No.
436940	437940	Yeah.
437940	438940	That's the second thing though.
438940	442180	Is that Arch, Arch, I think Arch called her a Mary Sue or something similar to it because
442180	445940	we are told that she's intelligent, but we aren't shown.
445940	446940	And I'm like, hold on.
446940	450860	No, we are shown that she's intelligent because there's that they do the exact scene with
450860	455300	her, that in the first episode of Game of Thrones, they did with Bran.
455300	457780	So you will go all the way back to the first season Game of Thrones.
457780	461640	There's, there's a, there's a scene where Bran is sitting around and he's being taught
461640	466180	by the Maester and he's like, you have to say, what, what, what, what's the house?
466180	468020	What's the, is it Bran or Arya?
468020	469020	It's one of the two.
469020	470700	But anyway, it's like, what, what's the house?
470700	471700	Arya.
471700	472700	Is it Arya?
472700	473700	Okay.
473700	474700	Well, either way.
474700	475700	No, but the name, you said Arya, Arya.
475700	476700	Okay.
476700	479840	Anyway, the Maester was like, okay, what's the house and what's, what's their sigil.
479840	482600	And you have to, you have to know all this stuff because it's important.
482600	486760	And the person, whichever, whichever, whichever person, whichever kid, whichever kid it was,
486760	488120	I was like, yeah, I know this already.
488120	490920	I know what I know and like didn't care.
490920	491920	And the Maester was like, yeah, take this seriously.
491920	492920	He's like, I already know it.
492920	494560	And then like, and like, they just rattle it off, right?
494560	499760	They did a very similar scene where they're lying in the Godswood and the, it's not the
499760	502360	Godswood, it's just a tree, isn't it?
502360	507760	I don't remember anything about Game of Thrones, any of the names anymore, but you know, this
507760	510040	episode, they were lying in the forest.
510040	511040	Okay.
511040	517920	And, and they had the book open and the princess was like, I already know this stuff.
517920	519720	And the handmaiden was like, you have to know this stuff.
519720	520720	And then she's like, all right.
520720	522040	And then she just rattled it off.
522040	526800	It's the same scene and it's meant to show that she's actually intelligent.
526800	527800	She just doesn't care.
527800	528800	She's not stupid.
528800	532520	Some people are saying that she is being treated like a Mary Sue and I don't think so.
532520	533840	I disagree with that statement.
533840	538600	I think that they definitely, they definitely established her as one, being neglected by
538600	542040	her father and two, therefore being rebellious.
542040	545640	And three, she seems to be quite naturally intelligent and they, they showed all of that.
545640	547880	They didn't, it wasn't, it wasn't a problem of show, not tell.
547880	548880	They showed that.
548880	552520	Let's do a quick TLDR of the show's plot.
552520	553520	Okay.
553520	558880	You have the king and he's, he's, he's not really a weak king necessarily, but he has
558880	561440	like his problems and they seem to be kind of getting to him.
561440	566720	You have his wife, his wife, the queen, and she's been, she's pregnant and she's trying
566720	570880	to give him an heir cause he doesn't have any male male heirs.
570880	576060	You have his brother and his brother is, is the prince and he's next in line since the
576060	580080	king can't produce a male heir and the brother's kind of sadistic and he seems to be kind of
580080	581320	a bad apple.
581320	586000	And then you have his daughter and his daughter is the princess and the prince, this is the
586000	590600	intelligent, you know, not a Mary Sue, but people are calling her a Mary Sue lesbian
590600	591600	character.
591600	592600	Okay.
592600	593600	Maybe lesbian.
593600	594600	Maybe.
594600	595600	There's, there's hints.
595600	596600	There's hints of it.
596600	597600	You think they're slamming clams?
597600	603440	Well, here's the thing to like broach off until like, since we're doing a TLDR to broach
603440	609980	off and do a different part of it is that like there's hints of it, but also the character
609980	613600	that there's hints with seems to be very much into dudes.
613600	617760	Well, they both seem to be into dudes, they just all seem to be into each other.
617760	622920	I could, I mean, I guess, but it's, it's, I like how you're bi and you're like being
622920	623920	bi is unsatisfying.
623920	624920	No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
624920	625920	I'm not saying it's not satisfying.
625920	630020	I'm saying that because Hollywood forgets that bi characters exist unless they are shoe
630020	631240	horning them in for some reason.
631240	632240	Sometimes.
632240	633240	Yeah.
633240	634240	All the fucking time.
634240	636600	But to be fair, Game of Thrones is pretty good about that generally, about not doing
636600	637600	that shit.
637600	638600	Yes.
638600	639600	But this Game of Thrones is bad.
639600	640600	So, okay.
640600	641600	I, I, yeah.
641600	645160	So who the fuck knows?
646000	650280	The story is basically they're trying to have an heir.
650280	652640	The king is very much like, I need a fucking heir, dude.
652640	654960	And like, there's like a bunch of tension surrounding this.
654960	655960	Yeah.
655960	658740	They hold a tournament and the tournament is supposed to be to celebrate the birth of
658740	659740	his child.
659740	660740	Yeah.
660740	661740	Cause the wife is like almost due.
661740	663440	Her belly is big and super gross.
663440	664440	Yeah.
664440	667760	No offense to pregnant woman.
667760	670520	I just, I can't, I can't.
670520	674220	So they, she goes into labor during the tournament.
674280	675980	It goes poorly.
675980	677820	They have to cut it out of her.
677820	678820	Okay.
678820	679820	That was a graphic scene.
679820	680820	That was a really graphic scene.
680820	683340	And it was legitimately upsetting.
683340	684340	Yeah.
684340	685340	To watch.
685340	686340	Holy shit.
686340	687340	Yeah.
687340	692980	Like if, if you or your girlfriend, uh, like are not okay with like really graphic, like
692980	702060	harm to pregnant woman, you might want to like kind of fast forward through that scene.
702060	703340	But it's a long, long scene.
703340	704340	It's actually pretty long scene.
704340	705340	Yeah.
705340	706340	There's a lot of blood.
706340	707340	Yeah.
707340	709020	Because they cut into parts of the really graphic part.
709020	710800	You'll know it when it starts to come up.
710800	714120	The really graphic part, two parts in the tourney, which is also graphic, but honestly
714120	715120	was better.
715120	716120	Yeah.
716120	719380	We're like beating guys faces and like cutting off their hands and shit and it's not as graphic
719380	720380	as the pregnancy scene.
720380	722060	No, like it was extremely upsetting.
722060	728240	Like you guys just heard me say, I don't like, I know I was like, I was not okay.
728240	732260	I was totally, but like you guys just heard me say that I did not like the look of pregnant
732260	736140	woman's bellies and I'm still just like, holy shit, that was really upsetting.
736140	738980	Well yeah.
738980	740400	So they have to cut it out of her.
740400	741400	She dies.
741400	743180	The baby survives a bit, but dies.
743180	744180	Yep.
744180	748420	And so this is like a major tragedy for the kingdom and the kingdom is kind of falling
748420	750340	apart and there's no air.
750340	754420	And however, the air, the, the, the legal air, you know, the council comes together
754420	757440	and was like, listen, you can't have your legal air be your brother because he's fucking
757440	758440	crazy dude.
758440	762220	Because, because what happened earlier was that there was, um, he, he, he, he, he, he
762220	767260	is, he is the Lord commander of the gold cloaks, which is the city watch, which is new.
767260	768260	It's new.
768260	771820	And at this point of the history, it's, it's a 172 years before the original game show.
771820	773820	And we don't remember anyone's names by the way.
773820	774820	Sorry.
774820	777180	Damon was the, but I don't remember anyone's name.
777180	778180	Anyone else?
778180	779180	Yeah.
779180	780180	I don't know anyone's names.
780180	781420	I barely, I didn't even remember his name to who said it.
781420	782420	I don't know anyone's names.
782420	786700	Well, anyway, anyway, there's a, there's a scene where like in order to prepare for the
786700	791180	tourney, uh, he, he gets all the gold cloaks and they go out into King's landing.
791180	792860	They find all the murderers and kill them.
792860	796460	They find all the rapists and castrate them and they find all the thieves and chop their
796460	797740	hands off.
797740	801020	And then the council is like, dude, you got to get hold of your brother because he's going
801020	802460	way too fucking far with this stuff.
802460	809040	He's going so far that they needed a cart pulled by two horses to drag all the fucking
809040	811340	corpses and bodies and parts away.
811340	812340	Yeah.
812340	813340	Fuck.
813340	814340	Like that actually made me laugh.
814340	821120	That was, that was just like, so, um, they're like, listen,
821120	825780	you can't, you can't have your brother be this crazy.
825780	826780	He can't be the king.
826780	828160	If you die, like he can't be your heir.
828160	829560	And the King's like, he's still my brother.
829560	832640	And then like his brother goes off and celebrates with the gold cloaks.
832640	838100	He celebrates the death of the King's newborn son by calling him.
838100	839100	Was it air for a minute?
839100	840480	No, it was air for a day.
840480	841480	Air for a day.
841480	842480	Yep.
842480	845160	And then the King finds out, the King finds out he's really pissed.
845160	846160	He's royally pissed.
846160	847160	Royally pissed.
847160	853800	And so he banishes him back to Dragonstone and then name, yes, he does.
853800	854800	Isn't Dragonstone?
854800	857080	No, it was back to the Vale with his wife.
857080	859720	Well, either way you banishes him.
859720	864840	And then the King names his daughter for the first time, the first time a woman gets to
864840	865840	do it.
865840	868580	His daughter is now the heir to the throne.
868580	873180	And then the King is like, listen, dude, uh, here's the secret passed on from all the Kings
873180	879260	is that one day in maybe 172 years from now, we are going to have to fight the White Walkers.
879260	880260	No.
880260	881260	Okay.
881260	882260	No.
882260	887220	And also, and the King is like also by the way, uh, this entire prophecy that I'm passing
887220	890540	on to you is actually completely false because Arya kills him anyway with, with, with the
890540	891540	dagger.
891540	892540	Yeah.
892540	894820	Actually, I think that's going to be a thing because if you notice the King had the dagger
894820	899660	that Arya used to stab him, what the King actually said is that the first Targaryen
899660	904820	King of Westeros had a dream and the dream is a prophecy and it's that winter is coming
904820	909100	and that there's going to be the army of darkness will march down from the North, which is by
909100	910420	the way, what happens in Game of Thrones.
910420	912220	I don't think he actually said army.
912220	915260	He just, he literally just said the darkness is going to come from the North.
915260	919740	He was actually super vague about it, which I appreciated, but the cringey part was what
919740	920980	the prophecy was called.
920980	922660	It was called the Song of Ice and Fire.
922660	923660	It was cringey.
923660	927260	But that's what called the prophecy that that's what it was called in the original books.
927260	928260	Okay.
928860	929860	And it's like a medieval.
929860	930860	George R.R. Martin.
930860	931940	That's cringey as fuck.
931940	934500	Don't call the prophecy that well, that's, that's why the book series called the Song
934500	935500	of Ice and Fire.
935500	940260	If you can just call it a Song of Ice and Fire and then not have the prophecy be named
940260	941260	that that's just cringey.
941260	943460	It just sounds like a terrible name for a prophecy.
943460	945420	That's my issue with it.
945420	947580	Everything was recorded in ballads and poetry and stuff.
947580	948580	So it makes sense.
948580	949580	I don't care.
949580	951060	It's just like, you just dislike the medieval times.
951060	952060	You know what?
952060	954060	I've never, I've never been to medieval times ever.
954060	955060	Okay.
955060	956060	I'll go without you.
956060	957060	Not allowed.
957060	958060	Fuck a hot lady.
958860	959860	Fuck you.
959860	960860	Okay.
960860	966860	Um, so yeah, like that's the TLDR of the plot and I don't know, like the, the actors that
966860	970860	they chose for the roles, they seem to be not quite right.
970860	971860	Each of them.
971860	972860	Yeah.
972860	978620	It's like the princess, the King, the brother, they all, they all like it strangely feels
978620	984540	not like the thing with the Game of Thrones, the one I think, I think one of the reasons
984540	989100	why everyone liked it so much is because with the first episode you were just drawn
989100	994380	into that world, like with the actors and the sets and the, I think still kind of bad
994380	995380	CGI back then.
995380	998060	It has some better CGI's that went on.
998060	999060	There was bad CGI in this.
999060	1000060	Holy fuck.
1000060	1001060	The cart, the backgrounds.
1001060	1002060	Yeah.
1002060	1003060	Who?
1003060	1004060	Yeah.
1004060	1008180	You just get drawn into the world because of how like lived in and grungy and like everything,
1008180	1012340	how people looked, you know, and like how they sounded and how they acted.
1012340	1015900	I think it was because like in the original Game of Thrones, they were pretty high tier
1015900	1019060	actors and these ones, they probably aren't so high tier.
1019060	1023620	Again, probably budget issues, like except technically Matt Smith, I guess.
1023620	1028280	I think part of it though, is also the fact that in the first episode of Game of Thrones,
1028280	1030700	you have, you get to see everyone's perspective.
1030700	1031700	Okay.
1031700	1033300	You get to see high born and low born characters.
1033300	1038300	There's Kings and princes and there's princesses and there's Queens and there's Royal ladies,
1038300	1041300	but then you also get to see, yep, there's bastard.
1041300	1045700	You get to hang out with Jon Snow, you get to hang out with Tyrion, with Theon, you get
1045700	1049060	to hang out with Arya when she's like running around, and Bran when they're like running
1049060	1052540	around with like basically being street rats.
1052540	1057900	Like there's instances where we get to see the points of view of people who aren't royalty,
1057900	1060580	even if they might be a little bit.
1060580	1063020	And there's also non-royal characters directly as well.
1063020	1064020	Yeah.
1064020	1065020	Like the prostitutes.
1065020	1067580	But in this show, there's not much of that.
1067580	1068580	It's all...
1068580	1070060	It was only the prostitutes.
1070060	1075660	It's all like court drama, which is fine, but you need to establish the world first.
1075660	1078980	Like if this was a standalone show and they hadn't made Game of Thrones, this wouldn't
1078980	1079980	have gone anywhere.
1079980	1080980	Yes, I agree.
1080980	1086460	I think, because that's the thing to branch off also, a lot of the first episode felt
1086460	1087460	really rushed.
1087460	1088460	Like it felt like a lot of stuff.
1088460	1090460	Like it was like, what, an hour long?
1090460	1091460	How long was it?
1091460	1092460	It was an hour long.
1092460	1093460	Yeah.
1093460	1094460	It felt like, and that's the thing though, it was an hour.
1094460	1095460	A lot of stuff happens.
1095460	1098540	Well, to be fair, a lot of stuff happened in the first episode of Game of Thrones.
1098540	1103540	It didn't feel rushed is my point.
1103540	1104540	I don't think this felt rushed.
1104540	1105540	It did to me.
1105540	1106540	I don't think so.
1106540	1107920	It felt like a lot of stuff just like happened.
1107920	1116540	And I think that to fix the, like not having commoner issues problem is to not banish Daemon
1116540	1122680	before the first episode and have him like be, while kind of a crazy person, like show
1122680	1125660	his interpersonal relationships a bit with the commoners.
1125660	1126660	Like episode two.
1126660	1127660	Yeah.
1127780	1135780	Because he made the comment when he was in the council meeting that none of them left
1135780	1136780	the Red Keep.
1136780	1138620	Except for him because he's the city commander.
1138620	1142660	To go down and like be around the commoners is one of the reasons he stated that he had
1142660	1145300	to like fucking do all the shit that he did.
1145300	1147300	Which is a bit of a, a bit of a cope.
1147300	1148300	I know what you mean.
1148300	1152100	I think that would have actually solved an issue because it felt really rushed.
1152100	1153100	I don't know.
1153100	1155660	You guys got to go watch it and tell me if you agree with me, but it felt rushed.
1155660	1159340	You could have had him like be banished by the end of the second episode.
1159340	1162060	But I understand the point of view is that they wanted to get the main conflict of the
1162060	1165540	show started, which was going to be, by the way, the civil war that is already in the
1165540	1166620	lore of the book.
1166620	1170540	So they're doing that story of the civil war between the King's brother and the King's
1170540	1171540	daughter.
1171540	1175700	So they wanted to make that the central story of the show.
1175700	1180220	So they wanted to actually show the event that kicked it off, which is the death of
1180220	1181220	the Queen.
1181220	1187500	The fact that there's no male heir and then Damon, even though he is like, here's the
1187500	1188500	thing.
1188500	1189500	He's clearly a bad person.
1189500	1190500	Yeah.
1190500	1193740	He's not good, but he made a good point when he was having his final discussion with the
1193740	1197580	King where it's like, listen, I'm your family.
1197580	1199980	Everyone else in the council is just sucking up to you and not telling you the truth, which
1199980	1203420	actually seems to be the truth, which was correct for a thing.
1203420	1207780	I actually don't want to spoil because it's pretty good, but like that happened before
1207780	1210140	that scene where it's like, Oh, I was like, Oh, I didn't say it out loud, but I was like,
1210540	1212540	Oh my God, look, he's right showing all the points.
1212540	1214540	And they already showed that that was good storytelling guys.
1214540	1215540	Yes.
1215540	1216540	Yes, it was.
1216540	1220540	Even though Damon is not a good person, there are still moments where it's like, listen,
1220540	1223900	you might be making a mistake sending him out in the cold, especially because he's dangerous.
1223900	1224900	Yeah.
1224900	1228900	Like it was, it was a weird feeling of like, he's very obviously not a good person, but
1228900	1234300	also just like, Oh, cute moments with niece, you know, like, like trying to like protect
1234300	1237460	his brother and obviously feeling, um, uh,
1237460	1238460	yeah.
1238460	1239460	Yeah.
1239460	1243260	No, by his brother before the banishment, right?
1243260	1247660	Cause he, cause he had said that, you know, you haven't made me your hand with what, why
1247660	1248660	you,
1248660	1249660	yeah.
1249660	1250660	Yeah.
1250660	1255740	And that's one thing that I think the show did very well is that it, it had that, it
1255740	1261980	had that it has those gray characters that Game of Thrones is really well known for care.
1261980	1264760	Like no one's really good and no one's really evil.
1264760	1268480	Like you have characters that are more evil than good for sure, but everyone has,
1268480	1273200	they're small moments of you sympathize and then you're just, you look at yourself and
1273200	1274200	be like, what the fuck?
1274200	1275200	Why did I sympathize?
1275200	1281240	Meanwhile, when you have fucking She-Hulk where She-Hulk is just right, where She-Hulk
1281240	1289740	is just correct in every circumstance and the Hulk is just considered like a fucking
1289740	1294260	moron even though he's been doing this for over, Oh God, that show was bad.
1294260	1297900	So actually you're not talking about, no, we're not, no, we're not.
1297900	1298900	Here's the thing.
1298900	1299900	Here's the thing.
1299900	1305800	Um, I expected to have to be like, Oh God, we got to make a terrible fucking video on
1305800	1309720	how bad house, house of the dragon is like how I'm probably gonna make one and She-Hulk
1309720	1312140	eventually or on that halo show.
1312140	1313140	Oh God.
1313140	1314140	You know what?
1314140	1315140	I'll finish watching.
1315140	1316140	Fuck you.
1316140	1317580	We watched the first episode of the halo show and then we walked out and she's like, this
1317580	1318580	is so fucking bad.
1318580	1319580	So fucking bad.
1319580	1320580	You know what's funny?
1320580	1321580	You love halo.
1321580	1322580	Well, yes.
1322580	1323580	To, to a degree.
1323900	1328580	Not as much as people who play halo all the time.
1328580	1332420	I have a good, I have a few good memories of halo and so I do enjoy the games.
1332420	1337840	But anyway, um, I will say this about halo since dev decided to mention She-Hulk is that
1337840	1343540	I think it would have been an okay series if it hadn't had the name brand halo and all
1343540	1344540	the halo things.
1344540	1345540	I don't know about that.
1345540	1346540	I think it would have.
1346540	1347540	I didn't think good.
1347540	1348540	I said, okay.
1348540	1351740	Anyway, what ruined it was that it said it was halo and it wasn't.
1351740	1357980	So my point is though, is that I was expecting to have to make a review or a video on how
1357980	1362660	awful house the dragon is and here's how bad the CG is and here's how they ruined this
1362660	1364360	and here's how they ruined that.
1364360	1367380	And there might even even been a political element to it where you get like the get woke,
1367380	1369280	go broke thing.
1369280	1372780	But we're talking about it like this right now in a more off the cuff manner where it's
1372780	1376660	not an edited video because I was pleasantly surprised.
1376660	1378020	I can actually recommend it to you.
1378020	1379580	I can say, you know what?
1379580	1383580	Even though every single fucking thing coming out, whether it's a re a reboot or a remake
1383580	1387620	or a sequel, no one wanted or a rehash or even just a new show, even though they all
1387620	1392740	fucking suck every single one of them, I can actually recommend this.
1392740	1397380	And so I'm not going to do any sort of big in depth review unless, unless the show like
1397380	1400840	craters in the next few weeks, I'm not going to do any sort of big in depth review like
1400840	1401840	Kenobi or anything.
1401840	1404340	I think I'm going to say you should watch this one.
1404340	1405340	Yeah.
1405340	1411740	I mean, I do recommend it, but I also part of I'm, I'm, I'm torn because part of me wants
1411740	1414180	to recommend it and be like, give the show a chance.
1414180	1418180	So they get a better budget and can do better CGI.
1418180	1419180	Give peace a chance.
1419180	1425040	However, however, I also don't want to recommend it because the show is okay and it's going
1425040	1426860	to do either one of two things.
1426860	1430300	One is going to get better and that means it's going to be better than game of thrones,
1430300	1433740	which is just going to make me sad because game of thrones is really good and then got
1433740	1439180	torn to torn asunder or, or it's going to go real bad.
1439180	1446220	I'm going to go real, real bad and I'll be like, I can't watch anything anymore.
1446220	1452100	Well we watched anything on, we watched Star Trek, strange new worlds and we were both
1452100	1454180	surprised that that show was actually good too.
1454180	1457460	Yeah, but even by the end you're like, Oh, this is a good show.
1457460	1458460	I'll go all the way through.
1458460	1459460	It was a good show.
1459460	1463620	It was still like, yeah, but like it was still only on par with like the okay episodes of
1463620	1465340	TNG.
1465340	1467500	That's pretty good for compared to fucking Picard.
1467500	1468500	Yeah.
1468500	1469500	Well you know what?
1469500	1472860	My fucking view wouldn't be so fucking destroyed if you hadn't made me watch Picard.
1472860	1473860	That was a fun time.
1473860	1475220	We never ever watched Picard.
1475220	1476700	We should do a Picard video.
1476700	1477700	Fuck you.
1477700	1480420	No, I refuse to live through any of that ever again.
1480420	1481420	My soul hurts.
1481420	1482700	You're just talking about it.
1482700	1484380	No, my soul hurts.
1484380	1487340	I have actually like mostly gotten rid of most of Picard.
1487340	1488780	I don't remember most of it anymore.
1488780	1493060	Remember the part when like the autistic girl is the Vogue queen?
1493980	1499540	There was, there was actually an article put out where the showrunner of strange new worlds
1499540	1505740	pitched the show to the studio by saying, why don't we just do the classic Star Trek?
1505740	1511780	Like you don't need some kind of big long, you know, like, so you don't need some kind
1511780	1515900	of huge plot where the entire galaxy, the entire universe is at stake and there's like
1515900	1518900	constant Starship battles and crazy shit going on.
1518900	1522180	And at last the entire, just do standalone episodes.
1523060	1529460	And have like a reasonably well liked cast doing adventures every single day and resolving
1529460	1531020	them by the end of the adventure.
1531020	1534420	And maybe you have a little morality tale in there, or maybe it's like a little science
1534420	1539100	fiction thing, or maybe it's like a puzzle problem, like whatever, but they just do Star
1539100	1540100	Trek.
1540100	1541100	And that's what they did.
1541100	1542100	And it was good.
1542100	1543100	Yes.
1543100	1545300	But they also do, they do do this more modern storytelling thing that I do enjoy of they
1545300	1550540	have episodic episodes that are small tie-ins to past episodes because there's one character
1550540	1551860	who dies and he's actually gone.
1551860	1552860	Yeah.
1552860	1555740	Like they're, they're, they're small tie-ins and I've always enjoyed it.
1555740	1559860	I like how modern shows have done that cause I found a lot of old shows just don't do that.
1559860	1561740	They're so episodically, nothing ever changes.
1561740	1564020	And it annoys me so much.
1564020	1568300	I mean, that was the big problem with Voyagers that it got too episodic where like, Villana
1568300	1572820	Torres was dealing with being half-cling on the entire seven fucking years of the show.
1572820	1576700	And that got old pretty fucking quick after you did it like 10 times.
1576700	1577700	Yeah.
1577700	1580700	Anyway, Host of the Dragon is okay.
1580700	1581700	It's okay.
1581700	1582700	You know what?
1582700	1586180	I'm not really gonna, I'm not going to do a video on it unless it like massively tanks
1586180	1587820	in the next few episodes.
1587820	1589620	I think I, I think I will wait.
1589620	1593220	I'll talk about She-Hulk probably at some point and how terrible that is.
1593220	1597100	And I'll probably talk about, um, we all know Lord of the Rings, Rings of Power is going
1597100	1598100	to be fucking abysmal.
1598100	1599100	I don't want to watch it.
1599100	1600100	Oh my God.
1600100	1601100	It's going to be abysmal.
1601100	1604100	I haven't even watched the, like the new quote unquote movies yet.
1604100	1605100	Here's the thing.
1605100	1607300	Like our arch movies, I haven't seen them.
1607300	1611020	I think like Arch and Kibbs and Lilith and I are going to do like a four person watch
1611020	1613480	party of, of Rings of Power.
1613480	1614480	You guys should.
1614480	1618540	I, you, you watch the first episode and then tell me how it is and I will give it a chance
1618540	1621220	because honestly I just, I'll just say it's great.
1621220	1623340	And then it'll be fucking like so bad.
1623340	1628500	Don't kick the computer and then you'll be single.
1628500	1634260	Anyway, um, if you like Game of Thrones, give Host of the Dragon a chance.
1634260	1635260	It's not bad.
1635260	1639620	This is the first episode that we're doing this in, so give at least the first episode
1639620	1640620	a chance.
1640620	1641620	Give it, give it a chance.
1641620	1647220	And you'll have to forgive it for the terrible CGI because I don't care about those sort
1647220	1652380	of things because I watched terrible looking anime because I do things I'm not allowed
1652380	1653380	to talk about on YouTube.
1653380	1656060	I guess that's the end.
1656060	1659100	How does, how does Red Letter Media usually end these things?
1659100	1660700	By throwing beer at things.
1660700	1661700	Oh yeah.
1661700	1663940	Da da da da da da da da.
