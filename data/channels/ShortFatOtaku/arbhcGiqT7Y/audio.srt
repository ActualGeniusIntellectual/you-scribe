1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,840
So, how was everyone's Christmas?

2
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:08,840
What did you all get?

3
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:10,100
Was your stocking full of coal?

4
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:11,880
Did you actually get what you put on your list for Santa?

5
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:16,400
I'm at that point in my life where I can buy a lot of the more mundane things that I want.

6
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:19,120
Like video games, or tools, or computer parts, or whatever.

7
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:22,180
And what I really value is time spent with people closest to me.

8
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:23,920
That makes me quite hard to shop for.

9
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:26,000
But I think this is actually pretty normal as an adult.

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,300
When I was a kid I wanted nothing more than a Nintendo 64.

11
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:34,300
And so back then my parents knew exactly what to buy me.

12
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:35,680
Now I have everything that I want.

13
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:38,920
To the point that I actually look forward to getting new socks and underwear whenever

14
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:40,720
I go back to visit my mom for the holidays.

15
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:42,320
Geez, never thought I'd be saying that.

16
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:43,680
But I guess it's just part of growing up.

17
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:47,980
However, how many of you got, as a fine, and I mean the finest Christmas gift, a Trump

18
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:48,980
NFT?

19
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:49,980
Oh yeah.

20
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:52,000
I haven't really spoken about NFTs before on this channel, have I?

21
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,700
Okay, here's a very quick TLDR.

22
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:56,800
My layman's understanding of a blockchain is that it's a digital ledger.

23
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:01,220
Each section is a block, and each future block contains data about the previous block that,

24
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:04,200
due to the algorithmic nature of the data, can't be edited.

25
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:08,440
If any block were to be secretly edited after publishing, the referential chain of algorithmic

26
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:12,900
data back through the ledger would change the data of all the previous blocks.

27
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:17,500
What this means is, any data stored on a blockchain can never be deleted without destroying every

28
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:20,260
single copy of the entire blockchain in existence.

29
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:22,180
A Bitcoin is a fungible token.

30
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:24,020
Fungible meaning replaceable or identical.

31
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:26,720
Each Bitcoin is worth the same amount as any other Bitcoin.

32
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:30,460
Nothing differentiates individual Bitcoins except their individual location on a blockchain

33
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:31,860
and who currently owns them.

34
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:34,220
NFT stands for non-fungible token.

35
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:39,040
What this means is individual NFTs might hold individual locations on a blockchain and might

36
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:41,140
have unique owners, just like a Bitcoin.

37
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:44,760
But each individual NFT is not interchangeable like Bitcoins are.

38
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:45,920
Each one is unique.

39
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:49,300
The most famous NFTs are from the Bored Ape Yacht Club collection.

40
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:54,220
The owner of all this nonsense, Yuga Labs, came to prominence in 2021, when they revealed

41
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:59,100
algorithmically generated artwork of the Bored Apes, cartoon monkey characters who all stand

42
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:03,380
in the same identical pose and frame, and for whom basic art AI generates different

43
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:05,740
faces, accessories, and assets.

44
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:10,620
Each ape image was added to the Ethereum blockchain, and then Yuga Labs sold them in the same way

45
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:11,620
you'd buy a Bitcoin.

46
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:16,000
An owner of a Bored Ape owns a specific spot in a blockchain, as proven by a digital ledger.

47
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,880
But unlike with a crypto blockchain where you just own a token, this time it comes with

48
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:22,760
an image, and all the intellectual property rights to that image, including the right

49
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:26,560
to use your Bored Ape in TV shows or movies or whatever else you might want to do with

50
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:27,560
it.

51
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:29,400
If all this sounds retarded, that's because it is.

52
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:34,480
Ever since Yuga Labs dropped the Bored Apes in April of 2021, NFTs have blown up.

53
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:37,320
Lots of rich people have spent lots of money on this as the next big thing.

54
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:41,480
And lots of not-so-rich people have lost lots of money on this, hoping to strike it rich

55
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:44,940
and resell the NFTs as the speculation bubble inflated.

56
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:47,120
But instead, they ended up destroying their lives.

57
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:50,960
Because people immediately saw through all this bullshit, and the entire NFT market had

58
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:54,820
collapsed and burned by June of 2021, just three months later.

59
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:58,020
But that hasn't stopped people from still trying to grift off the whole concept, with

60
00:02:58,020 --> 00:03:02,040
artists getting commissioned to draw NFTs for new shady startups, and influencers promoting

61
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:05,040
new NFT projects that are clearly just designed to be a rug pull.

62
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:08,000
By the way, a rug pull in the crypto world is exactly what it sounds like.

63
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,820
An influencer backs a new shitcoin, or in this case a new NFT, hypes it to their audience

64
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:15,160
as the next big thing, sells the product to their audience to make money, and then pulls

65
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:17,760
out of the project, letting the product's value collapse.

66
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:20,800
So they pocket the cash, and you are left with an asset you thought would appreciate

67
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:24,460
in value with the influencer's backing, but instead is just worthless.

68
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:28,200
Lots of people have lost lots of money in the past year and a half over this sort of

69
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,920
thing, which is just amazing to me.

70
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:33,560
Anyone who's financially savvy, or hell, just internet savvy, should be able to see

71
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:35,120
exactly what's happening here.

72
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:39,180
At least when Count Dankula sold NFTs, he said outright, listen guys, this is not an

73
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:40,500
asset that is going to inflate.

74
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:44,260
This is just a way for you to support my channel, and hey, fair enough, at least he's being

75
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:45,260
honest.

76
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:44,100
Thank you.

77
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:45,260
My god.

78
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:49,300
I think the reason he calls them trading cards is to reel in the boomers who don't know

79
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:52,540
what an NFT is, but who would totally buy a Trump baseball card.

80
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:55,140
He even sounds like a 3am infomercial scammer.

81
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:56,220
Look at these pictures.

82
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:57,220
Trump is Superman.

83
00:04:57,220 --> 00:04:58,220
Trump is a cowboy.

84
00:04:58,220 --> 00:04:59,220
Trump is an astronaut.

85
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:03,340
It looks like Trump saw the 2016 You Can't Stump the Trump series and said okay, it's

86
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:04,540
time to monetize that shit.

87
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:08,100
Trump had been hyping up a big announcement due to drop on December 15th.

88
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:10,320
It's going to be huge guys, make sure to tune in.

89
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,500
But it was just NFTs.

90
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:15,340
And holy shit, the rightoids were not happy about it.

91
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:32,900
Listen to Steve Bannon lose it.

92
00:05:32,900 --> 00:06:00,900
Meanwhile Newsmax, a pretty right-leaning news source, had a hilarious reaction.

93
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:15,620
Everyone is dumbstruck that this is what Trump is doing now.

94
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:19,220
You guys all doubted me when like a month ago or whatever I said it was Ron DeSantis

95
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:21,760
and not Trump who was the future of the Republican Party.

96
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:22,980
I was correct.

97
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:26,800
This is what Trump is spending his final bits of energy and influence on.

98
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:29,400
The MAGA movement at this point is spent.

99
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:32,900
Of course, despite the despair of the rightoids, and despite knowing exactly how these sorts

100
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:34,960
of schemes go, Trump got his bag.

101
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:37,340
A 4.5 million dollar bag, to be precise.

102
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:40,840
The Trump NFTs sold out within a day, each one going for $99 a pop.

103
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:44,000
And hey, you know, to Trump's credit, they actually are beginning to inflate in value,

104
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
at least for now.

105
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,400
Private owners of Trump NFTs are now selling them on the NFT exchange website, OpenSea,

106
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:51,480
for $1200 a pop or more.

107
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:56,080
By the way, the fine print says that 10% of each subsequent sale of any Trump NFT goes

108
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:58,280
into the pocket of the artist responsible for them.

109
00:06:58,280 --> 00:06:59,320
What a tidy grift.

110
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:03,040
And there also seems to be a serious question about where all this money is going.

111
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:07,080
Trump himself has stated that while the cards use his likeness, and he is clearly promoting

112
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:08,960
them, he is not in charge of the venture.

113
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:14,060
In fact, the company officially running the show is the blandly named NFT International

114
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:19,180
LLC, whose mailing address is a UPS office in Utah, but whose official business address

115
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:20,860
is a house in Wyoming.

116
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:25,160
This is a notorious piece of property in the Shell company game, being the official home

117
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:29,560
of thousands of LLCs, many of which are components of organized crime.

118
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:34,820
NFT International LLC is owned by another company, CIC Ventures, with a mailing address

119
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:38,060
at the Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach.

120
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:43,360
This company is owned by former Trump advisor Nick Luna and current Trump lawyer John Marion.

121
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:46,800
Those advertised sweepstakes prizes such as dinners with Trump and trips to Mar-a-Lago

122
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:47,800
with every NFT sold?

123
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:52,300
I don't know about you, but I wouldn't count in any of those ever actually materializing.

124
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:53,880
I think Trump has lost it, guys.

125
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:55,520
He wasn't like this in 2016.

126
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:59,480
I think it was a combination of his celebrity status and ego, his decisive 2016 victory

127
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:03,520
over the Republican establishment, his win over Hillary, the realities of being a president,

128
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:07,640
and his apparent Twitter addiction, all turned Trump into a caricature of himself.

129
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:09,080
And he was already kind of a caricature.

130
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:13,400
And I think that loss in 2020, where the real world finally impacted that bubble he was

131
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:15,040
living in, completely fucked him up.

132
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:18,600
He's been raving about how he didn't actually lose and it's so unfair and this and that

133
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,180
for two fucking years now.

134
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:22,640
And I think everyone is just done with the copium.

135
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:25,640
You know how you sometimes bump into that guy from high school who had one legitimately

136
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:29,520
awesome moment at the big championship sports ball game where he triumphed and took it home

137
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:30,520
for the school?

138
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:33,800
Only now he's been graduated for years and yet he still brings that shit up every time

139
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:34,800
you see him?

140
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:35,800
Almost like that's where his life peaked?

141
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:37,080
That's what Trump is now.

142
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:41,520
I think that 2020 loss and his subsequent isolation at Mar-a-Lago has brainrotted him

143
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:42,520
to the extreme.

144
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:45,160
He still talks like he's the president, he makes announcements like he's the president,

145
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:49,600
he's got files at Mar-a-Lago that he refused to hand over and the FBI had to fucking raid

146
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,600
him for them.

147
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:52,920
I can already hear the coping comments.

148
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:58,160
He didn't declassify them and he couldn't because the Atomic Energy Act places jurisdiction

149
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:01,120
over nuclear secrets in the hands of Congress, not the president.

150
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:05,360
I think Trump hasn't fully faced up to the fact that he lost and he's going through

151
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:10,360
a very public denial and spiral process that is honestly pretty sad to watch.

152
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:14,120
All that being said, Trump didn't only announce Trump NFTs on December 15th.

153
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:17,080
A second announcement which got way less attention was this one.

154
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:23,640
Today I'm announcing my plan to shatter the left-wing censorship regime and to reclaim

155
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:26,800
the right to free speech for all Americans.

156
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:32,960
In recent weeks, bombshell reports have confirmed that a sinister group of deep state bureaucrats,

157
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:39,980
Silicon Valley tyrants, left-wing activists and depraved corporate news media have been

158
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:44,940
conspiring to manipulate and silence the American people.

159
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:50,800
They have collaborated to suppress vital information on everything from elections to

160
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,400
public health.

161
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:59,820
The censorship cartel must be dismantled and destroyed and it must happen immediately.

162
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:05,580
If any U.S. university is discovered to have engaged in censorship activities or election

163
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:13,580
interferences in the past, such as flagging social media content for removal of blacklisting,

164
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:19,280
those universities should lose federal research dollars and federal student loan support for

165
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:22,220
a period of five years and maybe more.

166
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:28,000
We should also enact new laws laying out clear criminal penalties for federal bureaucrats

167
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:33,940
who partner with private entities to do an end run around the Constitution and deprive

168
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:37,880
Americans of their first, fourth and fifth amendment rights.

169
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:41,440
In other words, deprive them of their vote.

170
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:46,460
And once you lose those elections and once you lose your borders like we have, you no

171
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:47,940
longer have a country.

172
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:48,940
Yeah.

173
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:52,460
Trump's plan is to dismantle the censorship happening in schools, media and big tech using

174
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:53,460
government power.

175
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:54,460
I understand the appeal.

176
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:58,220
We have seen schools, media and big tech all be censorious towards the little guy.

177
00:10:58,220 --> 00:11:02,800
At the same time, schools, the media and big tech also have free speech rights.

178
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:06,460
And the idea of the government coming in and curtailing the free speech of anyone, whether

179
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:10,740
that's your average Joe or the owner of a successful business, is pretty scary to me.

180
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:13,520
Especially when that sentiment is coming from the mouth of a guy who over on Truth

181
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:17,840
Social recently said that the Twitter files being released by Elon right now are grounds

182
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:22,560
for overturning the 2020 election and the termination of all rules, regulations and

183
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,240
articles, even the Constitution.

184
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:28,320
Now, whatever the Twitter files releases are, and there's some debate on that, they are

185
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:32,800
not grounds for the termination of the Constitution in order to unilaterally reinstate Trump as

186
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:33,800
president.

187
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:37,880
And this type of flagrant disregard for the Constitution makes Trump just as unfit to

188
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:42,380
rule as the Democratic lawmaker who says the Second Amendment doesn't matter.

189
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:43,380
Yeah.

190
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:47,360
While this is mostly a goofy video about Trump and NFTs, I think there's something under

191
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:48,360
the surface here.

192
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:49,700
I liked Trump in 2016.

193
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:52,820
The memes were great, and some of the shit he was saying in that elections debates were

194
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:56,860
spot on, but he's become something else in the past six years, something that I don't

195
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:59,860
think anybody with a conscience can continue to support.

196
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:06,500
Also, isn't it strange that NFTs are basically just the rare Pepe's black market meme come

197
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:07,500
to life?

198
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:09,520
I know that was a joke, right?
