0	7840	So, how was everyone's Christmas?
7840	8840	What did you all get?
8840	10100	Was your stocking full of coal?
10100	11880	Did you actually get what you put on your list for Santa?
11880	16400	I'm at that point in my life where I can buy a lot of the more mundane things that I want.
16400	19120	Like video games, or tools, or computer parts, or whatever.
19120	22180	And what I really value is time spent with people closest to me.
22180	23920	That makes me quite hard to shop for.
23920	26000	But I think this is actually pretty normal as an adult.
26000	31300	When I was a kid I wanted nothing more than a Nintendo 64.
31300	34300	And so back then my parents knew exactly what to buy me.
34300	35680	Now I have everything that I want.
35680	38920	To the point that I actually look forward to getting new socks and underwear whenever
38920	40720	I go back to visit my mom for the holidays.
40720	42320	Geez, never thought I'd be saying that.
42320	43680	But I guess it's just part of growing up.
43680	47980	However, how many of you got, as a fine, and I mean the finest Christmas gift, a Trump
47980	48980	NFT?
48980	49980	Oh yeah.
49980	52000	I haven't really spoken about NFTs before on this channel, have I?
52000	53700	Okay, here's a very quick TLDR.
53700	56800	My layman's understanding of a blockchain is that it's a digital ledger.
56800	61220	Each section is a block, and each future block contains data about the previous block that,
61220	64200	due to the algorithmic nature of the data, can't be edited.
64200	68440	If any block were to be secretly edited after publishing, the referential chain of algorithmic
68440	72900	data back through the ledger would change the data of all the previous blocks.
72900	77500	What this means is, any data stored on a blockchain can never be deleted without destroying every
77500	80260	single copy of the entire blockchain in existence.
80260	82180	A Bitcoin is a fungible token.
82180	84020	Fungible meaning replaceable or identical.
84020	86720	Each Bitcoin is worth the same amount as any other Bitcoin.
86720	90460	Nothing differentiates individual Bitcoins except their individual location on a blockchain
90460	91860	and who currently owns them.
91860	94220	NFT stands for non-fungible token.
94220	99040	What this means is individual NFTs might hold individual locations on a blockchain and might
99040	101140	have unique owners, just like a Bitcoin.
101140	104760	But each individual NFT is not interchangeable like Bitcoins are.
104760	105920	Each one is unique.
105920	109300	The most famous NFTs are from the Bored Ape Yacht Club collection.
109300	114220	The owner of all this nonsense, Yuga Labs, came to prominence in 2021, when they revealed
114220	119100	algorithmically generated artwork of the Bored Apes, cartoon monkey characters who all stand
119100	123380	in the same identical pose and frame, and for whom basic art AI generates different
123380	125740	faces, accessories, and assets.
125740	130620	Each ape image was added to the Ethereum blockchain, and then Yuga Labs sold them in the same way
130620	131620	you'd buy a Bitcoin.
131620	136000	An owner of a Bored Ape owns a specific spot in a blockchain, as proven by a digital ledger.
136000	138880	But unlike with a crypto blockchain where you just own a token, this time it comes with
138960	142760	an image, and all the intellectual property rights to that image, including the right
142760	146560	to use your Bored Ape in TV shows or movies or whatever else you might want to do with
146560	147560	it.
147560	149400	If all this sounds retarded, that's because it is.
149400	154480	Ever since Yuga Labs dropped the Bored Apes in April of 2021, NFTs have blown up.
154480	157320	Lots of rich people have spent lots of money on this as the next big thing.
157320	161480	And lots of not-so-rich people have lost lots of money on this, hoping to strike it rich
161480	164940	and resell the NFTs as the speculation bubble inflated.
164940	167120	But instead, they ended up destroying their lives.
167460	170960	Because people immediately saw through all this bullshit, and the entire NFT market had
170960	174820	collapsed and burned by June of 2021, just three months later.
174820	178020	But that hasn't stopped people from still trying to grift off the whole concept, with
178020	182040	artists getting commissioned to draw NFTs for new shady startups, and influencers promoting
182040	185040	new NFT projects that are clearly just designed to be a rug pull.
185040	188000	By the way, a rug pull in the crypto world is exactly what it sounds like.
188000	191820	An influencer backs a new shitcoin, or in this case a new NFT, hypes it to their audience
191820	195160	as the next big thing, sells the product to their audience to make money, and then pulls
195160	197760	out of the project, letting the product's value collapse.
197760	200800	So they pocket the cash, and you are left with an asset you thought would appreciate
200800	204460	in value with the influencer's backing, but instead is just worthless.
204460	208200	Lots of people have lost lots of money in the past year and a half over this sort of
208200	209920	thing, which is just amazing to me.
209920	213560	Anyone who's financially savvy, or hell, just internet savvy, should be able to see
213560	215120	exactly what's happening here.
215120	219180	At least when Count Dankula sold NFTs, he said outright, listen guys, this is not an
219180	220500	asset that is going to inflate.
220500	224260	This is just a way for you to support my channel, and hey, fair enough, at least he's being
224260	225260	honest.
254260	284100	Thank you.
284260	285260	My god.
285260	289300	I think the reason he calls them trading cards is to reel in the boomers who don't know
289300	292540	what an NFT is, but who would totally buy a Trump baseball card.
292540	295140	He even sounds like a 3am infomercial scammer.
295140	296220	Look at these pictures.
296220	297220	Trump is Superman.
297220	298220	Trump is a cowboy.
298220	299220	Trump is an astronaut.
299220	303340	It looks like Trump saw the 2016 You Can't Stump the Trump series and said okay, it's
303340	304540	time to monetize that shit.
304540	308100	Trump had been hyping up a big announcement due to drop on December 15th.
308100	310320	It's going to be huge guys, make sure to tune in.
310320	312500	But it was just NFTs.
312500	315340	And holy shit, the rightoids were not happy about it.
315340	332900	Listen to Steve Bannon lose it.
332900	360900	Meanwhile Newsmax, a pretty right-leaning news source, had a hilarious reaction.
360900	375620	Everyone is dumbstruck that this is what Trump is doing now.
375620	379220	You guys all doubted me when like a month ago or whatever I said it was Ron DeSantis
379220	381760	and not Trump who was the future of the Republican Party.
381760	382980	I was correct.
382980	386800	This is what Trump is spending his final bits of energy and influence on.
386800	389400	The MAGA movement at this point is spent.
389400	392900	Of course, despite the despair of the rightoids, and despite knowing exactly how these sorts
392900	394960	of schemes go, Trump got his bag.
394960	397340	A 4.5 million dollar bag, to be precise.
397340	400840	The Trump NFTs sold out within a day, each one going for $99 a pop.
400840	404000	And hey, you know, to Trump's credit, they actually are beginning to inflate in value,
404000	405000	at least for now.
405000	409400	Private owners of Trump NFTs are now selling them on the NFT exchange website, OpenSea,
409400	411480	for $1200 a pop or more.
411480	416080	By the way, the fine print says that 10% of each subsequent sale of any Trump NFT goes
416080	418280	into the pocket of the artist responsible for them.
418280	419320	What a tidy grift.
419320	423040	And there also seems to be a serious question about where all this money is going.
423040	427080	Trump himself has stated that while the cards use his likeness, and he is clearly promoting
427080	428960	them, he is not in charge of the venture.
428960	434060	In fact, the company officially running the show is the blandly named NFT International
434060	439180	LLC, whose mailing address is a UPS office in Utah, but whose official business address
439180	440860	is a house in Wyoming.
440860	445160	This is a notorious piece of property in the Shell company game, being the official home
445160	449560	of thousands of LLCs, many of which are components of organized crime.
449560	454820	NFT International LLC is owned by another company, CIC Ventures, with a mailing address
454820	458060	at the Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach.
458060	463360	This company is owned by former Trump advisor Nick Luna and current Trump lawyer John Marion.
463360	466800	Those advertised sweepstakes prizes such as dinners with Trump and trips to Mar-a-Lago
466800	467800	with every NFT sold?
467800	472300	I don't know about you, but I wouldn't count in any of those ever actually materializing.
472300	473880	I think Trump has lost it, guys.
473920	475520	He wasn't like this in 2016.
475520	479480	I think it was a combination of his celebrity status and ego, his decisive 2016 victory
479480	483520	over the Republican establishment, his win over Hillary, the realities of being a president,
483520	487640	and his apparent Twitter addiction, all turned Trump into a caricature of himself.
487640	489080	And he was already kind of a caricature.
489080	493400	And I think that loss in 2020, where the real world finally impacted that bubble he was
493400	495040	living in, completely fucked him up.
495040	498600	He's been raving about how he didn't actually lose and it's so unfair and this and that
498600	500180	for two fucking years now.
500180	502640	And I think everyone is just done with the copium.
502640	505640	You know how you sometimes bump into that guy from high school who had one legitimately
505640	509520	awesome moment at the big championship sports ball game where he triumphed and took it home
509520	510520	for the school?
510520	513800	Only now he's been graduated for years and yet he still brings that shit up every time
513800	514800	you see him?
514800	515800	Almost like that's where his life peaked?
515800	517080	That's what Trump is now.
517080	521520	I think that 2020 loss and his subsequent isolation at Mar-a-Lago has brainrotted him
521520	522520	to the extreme.
522520	525160	He still talks like he's the president, he makes announcements like he's the president,
525160	529600	he's got files at Mar-a-Lago that he refused to hand over and the FBI had to fucking raid
529600	530600	him for them.
530600	532920	I can already hear the coping comments.
532920	538160	He didn't declassify them and he couldn't because the Atomic Energy Act places jurisdiction
538160	541120	over nuclear secrets in the hands of Congress, not the president.
541120	545360	I think Trump hasn't fully faced up to the fact that he lost and he's going through
545360	550360	a very public denial and spiral process that is honestly pretty sad to watch.
550360	554120	All that being said, Trump didn't only announce Trump NFTs on December 15th.
554120	557080	A second announcement which got way less attention was this one.
557080	563640	Today I'm announcing my plan to shatter the left-wing censorship regime and to reclaim
563640	566800	the right to free speech for all Americans.
566800	572960	In recent weeks, bombshell reports have confirmed that a sinister group of deep state bureaucrats,
572960	579980	Silicon Valley tyrants, left-wing activists and depraved corporate news media have been
579980	584940	conspiring to manipulate and silence the American people.
584940	590800	They have collaborated to suppress vital information on everything from elections to
590800	592400	public health.
592400	599820	The censorship cartel must be dismantled and destroyed and it must happen immediately.
599820	605580	If any U.S. university is discovered to have engaged in censorship activities or election
605580	613580	interferences in the past, such as flagging social media content for removal of blacklisting,
613800	619280	those universities should lose federal research dollars and federal student loan support for
619280	622220	a period of five years and maybe more.
622220	628000	We should also enact new laws laying out clear criminal penalties for federal bureaucrats
628000	633940	who partner with private entities to do an end run around the Constitution and deprive
633940	637880	Americans of their first, fourth and fifth amendment rights.
637880	641440	In other words, deprive them of their vote.
641440	646460	And once you lose those elections and once you lose your borders like we have, you no
646460	647940	longer have a country.
647940	648940	Yeah.
648940	652460	Trump's plan is to dismantle the censorship happening in schools, media and big tech using
652460	653460	government power.
653460	654460	I understand the appeal.
654460	658220	We have seen schools, media and big tech all be censorious towards the little guy.
658220	662800	At the same time, schools, the media and big tech also have free speech rights.
662800	666460	And the idea of the government coming in and curtailing the free speech of anyone, whether
666460	670740	that's your average Joe or the owner of a successful business, is pretty scary to me.
670740	673520	Especially when that sentiment is coming from the mouth of a guy who over on Truth
673520	677840	Social recently said that the Twitter files being released by Elon right now are grounds
677840	682560	for overturning the 2020 election and the termination of all rules, regulations and
682560	684240	articles, even the Constitution.
684240	688320	Now, whatever the Twitter files releases are, and there's some debate on that, they are
688320	692800	not grounds for the termination of the Constitution in order to unilaterally reinstate Trump as
692800	693800	president.
693800	697880	And this type of flagrant disregard for the Constitution makes Trump just as unfit to
697880	702380	rule as the Democratic lawmaker who says the Second Amendment doesn't matter.
702380	703380	Yeah.
703380	707360	While this is mostly a goofy video about Trump and NFTs, I think there's something under
707360	708360	the surface here.
708360	709700	I liked Trump in 2016.
709700	712820	The memes were great, and some of the shit he was saying in that elections debates were
712820	716860	spot on, but he's become something else in the past six years, something that I don't
716860	719860	think anybody with a conscience can continue to support.
719860	726500	Also, isn't it strange that NFTs are basically just the rare Pepe's black market meme come
726500	727500	to life?
727500	729520	I know that was a joke, right?
