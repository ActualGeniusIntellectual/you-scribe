00:00.000 --> 00:07.840
So, how was everyone's Christmas?

00:07.840 --> 00:08.840
What did you all get?

00:08.840 --> 00:10.100
Was your stocking full of coal?

00:10.100 --> 00:11.880
Did you actually get what you put on your list for Santa?

00:11.880 --> 00:16.400
I'm at that point in my life where I can buy a lot of the more mundane things that I want.

00:16.400 --> 00:19.120
Like video games, or tools, or computer parts, or whatever.

00:19.120 --> 00:22.180
And what I really value is time spent with people closest to me.

00:22.180 --> 00:23.920
That makes me quite hard to shop for.

00:23.920 --> 00:26.000
But I think this is actually pretty normal as an adult.

00:26.000 --> 00:31.300
When I was a kid I wanted nothing more than a Nintendo 64.

00:31.300 --> 00:34.300
And so back then my parents knew exactly what to buy me.

00:34.300 --> 00:35.680
Now I have everything that I want.

00:35.680 --> 00:38.920
To the point that I actually look forward to getting new socks and underwear whenever

00:38.920 --> 00:40.720
I go back to visit my mom for the holidays.

00:40.720 --> 00:42.320
Geez, never thought I'd be saying that.

00:42.320 --> 00:43.680
But I guess it's just part of growing up.

00:43.680 --> 00:47.980
However, how many of you got, as a fine, and I mean the finest Christmas gift, a Trump

00:47.980 --> 00:48.980
NFT?

00:48.980 --> 00:49.980
Oh yeah.

00:49.980 --> 00:52.000
I haven't really spoken about NFTs before on this channel, have I?

00:52.000 --> 00:53.700
Okay, here's a very quick TLDR.

00:53.700 --> 00:56.800
My layman's understanding of a blockchain is that it's a digital ledger.

00:56.800 --> 01:01.220
Each section is a block, and each future block contains data about the previous block that,

01:01.220 --> 01:04.200
due to the algorithmic nature of the data, can't be edited.

01:04.200 --> 01:08.440
If any block were to be secretly edited after publishing, the referential chain of algorithmic

01:08.440 --> 01:12.900
data back through the ledger would change the data of all the previous blocks.

01:12.900 --> 01:17.500
What this means is, any data stored on a blockchain can never be deleted without destroying every

01:17.500 --> 01:20.260
single copy of the entire blockchain in existence.

01:20.260 --> 01:22.180
A Bitcoin is a fungible token.

01:22.180 --> 01:24.020
Fungible meaning replaceable or identical.

01:24.020 --> 01:26.720
Each Bitcoin is worth the same amount as any other Bitcoin.

01:26.720 --> 01:30.460
Nothing differentiates individual Bitcoins except their individual location on a blockchain

01:30.460 --> 01:31.860
and who currently owns them.

01:31.860 --> 01:34.220
NFT stands for non-fungible token.

01:34.220 --> 01:39.040
What this means is individual NFTs might hold individual locations on a blockchain and might

01:39.040 --> 01:41.140
have unique owners, just like a Bitcoin.

01:41.140 --> 01:44.760
But each individual NFT is not interchangeable like Bitcoins are.

01:44.760 --> 01:45.920
Each one is unique.

01:45.920 --> 01:49.300
The most famous NFTs are from the Bored Ape Yacht Club collection.

01:49.300 --> 01:54.220
The owner of all this nonsense, Yuga Labs, came to prominence in 2021, when they revealed

01:54.220 --> 01:59.100
algorithmically generated artwork of the Bored Apes, cartoon monkey characters who all stand

01:59.100 --> 02:03.380
in the same identical pose and frame, and for whom basic art AI generates different

02:03.380 --> 02:05.740
faces, accessories, and assets.

02:05.740 --> 02:10.620
Each ape image was added to the Ethereum blockchain, and then Yuga Labs sold them in the same way

02:10.620 --> 02:11.620
you'd buy a Bitcoin.

02:11.620 --> 02:16.000
An owner of a Bored Ape owns a specific spot in a blockchain, as proven by a digital ledger.

02:16.000 --> 02:18.880
But unlike with a crypto blockchain where you just own a token, this time it comes with

02:18.960 --> 02:22.760
an image, and all the intellectual property rights to that image, including the right

02:22.760 --> 02:26.560
to use your Bored Ape in TV shows or movies or whatever else you might want to do with

02:26.560 --> 02:27.560
it.

02:27.560 --> 02:29.400
If all this sounds retarded, that's because it is.

02:29.400 --> 02:34.480
Ever since Yuga Labs dropped the Bored Apes in April of 2021, NFTs have blown up.

02:34.480 --> 02:37.320
Lots of rich people have spent lots of money on this as the next big thing.

02:37.320 --> 02:41.480
And lots of not-so-rich people have lost lots of money on this, hoping to strike it rich

02:41.480 --> 02:44.940
and resell the NFTs as the speculation bubble inflated.

02:44.940 --> 02:47.120
But instead, they ended up destroying their lives.

02:47.460 --> 02:50.960
Because people immediately saw through all this bullshit, and the entire NFT market had

02:50.960 --> 02:54.820
collapsed and burned by June of 2021, just three months later.

02:54.820 --> 02:58.020
But that hasn't stopped people from still trying to grift off the whole concept, with

02:58.020 --> 03:02.040
artists getting commissioned to draw NFTs for new shady startups, and influencers promoting

03:02.040 --> 03:05.040
new NFT projects that are clearly just designed to be a rug pull.

03:05.040 --> 03:08.000
By the way, a rug pull in the crypto world is exactly what it sounds like.

03:08.000 --> 03:11.820
An influencer backs a new shitcoin, or in this case a new NFT, hypes it to their audience

03:11.820 --> 03:15.160
as the next big thing, sells the product to their audience to make money, and then pulls

03:15.160 --> 03:17.760
out of the project, letting the product's value collapse.

03:17.760 --> 03:20.800
So they pocket the cash, and you are left with an asset you thought would appreciate

03:20.800 --> 03:24.460
in value with the influencer's backing, but instead is just worthless.

03:24.460 --> 03:28.200
Lots of people have lost lots of money in the past year and a half over this sort of

03:28.200 --> 03:29.920
thing, which is just amazing to me.

03:29.920 --> 03:33.560
Anyone who's financially savvy, or hell, just internet savvy, should be able to see

03:33.560 --> 03:35.120
exactly what's happening here.

03:35.120 --> 03:39.180
At least when Count Dankula sold NFTs, he said outright, listen guys, this is not an

03:39.180 --> 03:40.500
asset that is going to inflate.

03:40.500 --> 03:44.260
This is just a way for you to support my channel, and hey, fair enough, at least he's being

03:44.260 --> 03:45.260
honest.

04:14.260 --> 04:44.100
Thank you.

04:44.260 --> 04:45.260
My god.

04:45.260 --> 04:49.300
I think the reason he calls them trading cards is to reel in the boomers who don't know

04:49.300 --> 04:52.540
what an NFT is, but who would totally buy a Trump baseball card.

04:52.540 --> 04:55.140
He even sounds like a 3am infomercial scammer.

04:55.140 --> 04:56.220
Look at these pictures.

04:56.220 --> 04:57.220
Trump is Superman.

04:57.220 --> 04:58.220
Trump is a cowboy.

04:58.220 --> 04:59.220
Trump is an astronaut.

04:59.220 --> 05:03.340
It looks like Trump saw the 2016 You Can't Stump the Trump series and said okay, it's

05:03.340 --> 05:04.540
time to monetize that shit.

05:04.540 --> 05:08.100
Trump had been hyping up a big announcement due to drop on December 15th.

05:08.100 --> 05:10.320
It's going to be huge guys, make sure to tune in.

05:10.320 --> 05:12.500
But it was just NFTs.

05:12.500 --> 05:15.340
And holy shit, the rightoids were not happy about it.

05:15.340 --> 05:32.900
Listen to Steve Bannon lose it.

05:32.900 --> 06:00.900
Meanwhile Newsmax, a pretty right-leaning news source, had a hilarious reaction.

06:00.900 --> 06:15.620
Everyone is dumbstruck that this is what Trump is doing now.

06:15.620 --> 06:19.220
You guys all doubted me when like a month ago or whatever I said it was Ron DeSantis

06:19.220 --> 06:21.760
and not Trump who was the future of the Republican Party.

06:21.760 --> 06:22.980
I was correct.

06:22.980 --> 06:26.800
This is what Trump is spending his final bits of energy and influence on.

06:26.800 --> 06:29.400
The MAGA movement at this point is spent.

06:29.400 --> 06:32.900
Of course, despite the despair of the rightoids, and despite knowing exactly how these sorts

06:32.900 --> 06:34.960
of schemes go, Trump got his bag.

06:34.960 --> 06:37.340
A 4.5 million dollar bag, to be precise.

06:37.340 --> 06:40.840
The Trump NFTs sold out within a day, each one going for $99 a pop.

06:40.840 --> 06:44.000
And hey, you know, to Trump's credit, they actually are beginning to inflate in value,

06:44.000 --> 06:45.000
at least for now.

06:45.000 --> 06:49.400
Private owners of Trump NFTs are now selling them on the NFT exchange website, OpenSea,

06:49.400 --> 06:51.480
for $1200 a pop or more.

06:51.480 --> 06:56.080
By the way, the fine print says that 10% of each subsequent sale of any Trump NFT goes

06:56.080 --> 06:58.280
into the pocket of the artist responsible for them.

06:58.280 --> 06:59.320
What a tidy grift.

06:59.320 --> 07:03.040
And there also seems to be a serious question about where all this money is going.

07:03.040 --> 07:07.080
Trump himself has stated that while the cards use his likeness, and he is clearly promoting

07:07.080 --> 07:08.960
them, he is not in charge of the venture.

07:08.960 --> 07:14.060
In fact, the company officially running the show is the blandly named NFT International

07:14.060 --> 07:19.180
LLC, whose mailing address is a UPS office in Utah, but whose official business address

07:19.180 --> 07:20.860
is a house in Wyoming.

07:20.860 --> 07:25.160
This is a notorious piece of property in the Shell company game, being the official home

07:25.160 --> 07:29.560
of thousands of LLCs, many of which are components of organized crime.

07:29.560 --> 07:34.820
NFT International LLC is owned by another company, CIC Ventures, with a mailing address

07:34.820 --> 07:38.060
at the Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach.

07:38.060 --> 07:43.360
This company is owned by former Trump advisor Nick Luna and current Trump lawyer John Marion.

07:43.360 --> 07:46.800
Those advertised sweepstakes prizes such as dinners with Trump and trips to Mar-a-Lago

07:46.800 --> 07:47.800
with every NFT sold?

07:47.800 --> 07:52.300
I don't know about you, but I wouldn't count in any of those ever actually materializing.

07:52.300 --> 07:53.880
I think Trump has lost it, guys.

07:53.920 --> 07:55.520
He wasn't like this in 2016.

07:55.520 --> 07:59.480
I think it was a combination of his celebrity status and ego, his decisive 2016 victory

07:59.480 --> 08:03.520
over the Republican establishment, his win over Hillary, the realities of being a president,

08:03.520 --> 08:07.640
and his apparent Twitter addiction, all turned Trump into a caricature of himself.

08:07.640 --> 08:09.080
And he was already kind of a caricature.

08:09.080 --> 08:13.400
And I think that loss in 2020, where the real world finally impacted that bubble he was

08:13.400 --> 08:15.040
living in, completely fucked him up.

08:15.040 --> 08:18.600
He's been raving about how he didn't actually lose and it's so unfair and this and that

08:18.600 --> 08:20.180
for two fucking years now.

08:20.180 --> 08:22.640
And I think everyone is just done with the copium.

08:22.640 --> 08:25.640
You know how you sometimes bump into that guy from high school who had one legitimately

08:25.640 --> 08:29.520
awesome moment at the big championship sports ball game where he triumphed and took it home

08:29.520 --> 08:30.520
for the school?

08:30.520 --> 08:33.800
Only now he's been graduated for years and yet he still brings that shit up every time

08:33.800 --> 08:34.800
you see him?

08:34.800 --> 08:35.800
Almost like that's where his life peaked?

08:35.800 --> 08:37.080
That's what Trump is now.

08:37.080 --> 08:41.520
I think that 2020 loss and his subsequent isolation at Mar-a-Lago has brainrotted him

08:41.520 --> 08:42.520
to the extreme.

08:42.520 --> 08:45.160
He still talks like he's the president, he makes announcements like he's the president,

08:45.160 --> 08:49.600
he's got files at Mar-a-Lago that he refused to hand over and the FBI had to fucking raid

08:49.600 --> 08:50.600
him for them.

08:50.600 --> 08:52.920
I can already hear the coping comments.

08:52.920 --> 08:58.160
He didn't declassify them and he couldn't because the Atomic Energy Act places jurisdiction

08:58.160 --> 09:01.120
over nuclear secrets in the hands of Congress, not the president.

09:01.120 --> 09:05.360
I think Trump hasn't fully faced up to the fact that he lost and he's going through

09:05.360 --> 09:10.360
a very public denial and spiral process that is honestly pretty sad to watch.

09:10.360 --> 09:14.120
All that being said, Trump didn't only announce Trump NFTs on December 15th.

09:14.120 --> 09:17.080
A second announcement which got way less attention was this one.

09:17.080 --> 09:23.640
Today I'm announcing my plan to shatter the left-wing censorship regime and to reclaim

09:23.640 --> 09:26.800
the right to free speech for all Americans.

09:26.800 --> 09:32.960
In recent weeks, bombshell reports have confirmed that a sinister group of deep state bureaucrats,

09:32.960 --> 09:39.980
Silicon Valley tyrants, left-wing activists and depraved corporate news media have been

09:39.980 --> 09:44.940
conspiring to manipulate and silence the American people.

09:44.940 --> 09:50.800
They have collaborated to suppress vital information on everything from elections to

09:50.800 --> 09:52.400
public health.

09:52.400 --> 09:59.820
The censorship cartel must be dismantled and destroyed and it must happen immediately.

09:59.820 --> 10:05.580
If any U.S. university is discovered to have engaged in censorship activities or election

10:05.580 --> 10:13.580
interferences in the past, such as flagging social media content for removal of blacklisting,

10:13.800 --> 10:19.280
those universities should lose federal research dollars and federal student loan support for

10:19.280 --> 10:22.220
a period of five years and maybe more.

10:22.220 --> 10:28.000
We should also enact new laws laying out clear criminal penalties for federal bureaucrats

10:28.000 --> 10:33.940
who partner with private entities to do an end run around the Constitution and deprive

10:33.940 --> 10:37.880
Americans of their first, fourth and fifth amendment rights.

10:37.880 --> 10:41.440
In other words, deprive them of their vote.

10:41.440 --> 10:46.460
And once you lose those elections and once you lose your borders like we have, you no

10:46.460 --> 10:47.940
longer have a country.

10:47.940 --> 10:48.940
Yeah.

10:48.940 --> 10:52.460
Trump's plan is to dismantle the censorship happening in schools, media and big tech using

10:52.460 --> 10:53.460
government power.

10:53.460 --> 10:54.460
I understand the appeal.

10:54.460 --> 10:58.220
We have seen schools, media and big tech all be censorious towards the little guy.

10:58.220 --> 11:02.800
At the same time, schools, the media and big tech also have free speech rights.

11:02.800 --> 11:06.460
And the idea of the government coming in and curtailing the free speech of anyone, whether

11:06.460 --> 11:10.740
that's your average Joe or the owner of a successful business, is pretty scary to me.

11:10.740 --> 11:13.520
Especially when that sentiment is coming from the mouth of a guy who over on Truth

11:13.520 --> 11:17.840
Social recently said that the Twitter files being released by Elon right now are grounds

11:17.840 --> 11:22.560
for overturning the 2020 election and the termination of all rules, regulations and

11:22.560 --> 11:24.240
articles, even the Constitution.

11:24.240 --> 11:28.320
Now, whatever the Twitter files releases are, and there's some debate on that, they are

11:28.320 --> 11:32.800
not grounds for the termination of the Constitution in order to unilaterally reinstate Trump as

11:32.800 --> 11:33.800
president.

11:33.800 --> 11:37.880
And this type of flagrant disregard for the Constitution makes Trump just as unfit to

11:37.880 --> 11:42.380
rule as the Democratic lawmaker who says the Second Amendment doesn't matter.

11:42.380 --> 11:43.380
Yeah.

11:43.380 --> 11:47.360
While this is mostly a goofy video about Trump and NFTs, I think there's something under

11:47.360 --> 11:48.360
the surface here.

11:48.360 --> 11:49.700
I liked Trump in 2016.

11:49.700 --> 11:52.820
The memes were great, and some of the shit he was saying in that elections debates were

11:52.820 --> 11:56.860
spot on, but he's become something else in the past six years, something that I don't

11:56.860 --> 11:59.860
think anybody with a conscience can continue to support.

11:59.860 --> 12:06.500
Also, isn't it strange that NFTs are basically just the rare Pepe's black market meme come

12:06.500 --> 12:07.500
to life?

12:07.500 --> 12:09.520
I know that was a joke, right?
