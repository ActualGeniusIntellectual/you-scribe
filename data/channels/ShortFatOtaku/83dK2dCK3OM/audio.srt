1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,740
The last video was all about the train wreck that is Santa Inc, go watch that if you missed

2
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:10,740
it.

3
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:14,340
One of the best barometers of just how bad Santa Inc is, and this also works for the

4
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:18,660
Star Wars sequel trilogy, for the cowboy bebop live action remake, ghostbusters 2016, or

5
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:23,560
really any shitty woke modern retelling of a classic story, is the ratio it got on Rotten

6
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:24,560
Tomatoes.

7
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:28,900
Rotten Tomatoes is a website for movie reviews founded in 1998, boy looking at this brings

8
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:29,900
back memories.

9
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:33,880
It was meant to be a place where anybody could log in and leave reviews of any movie, following

10
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:38,940
in that late 90s and early 2000s trend of internet services as democratizing cultural

11
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:39,940
forces.

12
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:42,740
The system is easy enough to understand, there's a series of professional film critics who

13
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:44,580
contribute to a film's fresh score.

14
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:50,560
A total average score of 60% or higher indicates a fresh film, 59% or lower a rotten one.

15
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:56,860
A certified fresh score indicates 70% or higher with at least 80 reviews and 5 from top critics,

16
00:00:56,860 --> 00:00:58,140
whatever that refers to.

17
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:00,400
Meanwhile the audience score is more simplistic.

18
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:03,700
The audience can't rate from 0 to 100, but from 1 star to 5.

19
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:08,460
A full popcorn bucket means that more viewers rated the film 3.5 stars or higher, and an

20
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:12,980
empty popcorn bucket means that more viewers rated the film as lower than 3.5 stars.

21
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:13,980
Seems real simple right?

22
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:14,980
What could go wrong here?

23
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:18,460
Could it be that given enough time and political interest, the creator class and the audience

24
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:22,340
class would have diverging interests, leading to those two scores representing entirely

25
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:23,740
different things than advertised?

26
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:26,080
I mean it's 2021 so yeah that's exactly what happened.

27
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:30,360
The critical score seems to be balanced heavily in favor of left-leaning politics, and that's

28
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:33,800
no surprise to me, it makes sense that a more left-leaning person would have the personality

29
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:35,880
type that draws them to professional film critique.

30
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:39,960
But that doesn't mean that the audience score is a mirror of that, being heavily balanced

31
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:41,960
in favor of right-leaning politics.

32
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:45,520
In fact the audience score seems to be more balanced in favor of the apolitical.

33
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:49,700
Leftists, rightists, and centrists all have access to the audience score, and I'm not

34
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:52,400
surprised that a more neutral take would shake out of that.

35
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:56,520
So when you see a film that has a high critical score but a low audience score, your best

36
00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:00,720
bet is that it's a bunch of woke garbage that explicitly pushes a prog message to the

37
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:01,960
detriment of quality.

38
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:06,040
While if you see a film that has a low critical score but a high audience score, it's either

39
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:10,180
explicitly anti-woke, which is kinda rare nowadays, or more commonly it's a series

40
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:14,060
that has ducked the revisionist trend as of late and held off in the politics in order

41
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:16,300
to create a more authentic experience.

42
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:20,540
Also keep in mind that this effect can still take place even if the film itself is apolitical.

43
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:25,060
If a writer, director, or actor makes a very public political statement, or finds themselves

44
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:28,860
in some kind of controversy online, then this effect will still happen, and it can bend

45
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:30,860
either way, left or non-left.

46
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:32,180
Here let me show you some examples.

47
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:36,100
Let's begin with Santa Inc, that godforsaken series that's kicked off my dive down this

48
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:37,100
rabbit hole.

49
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:40,260
Yep, it's still at a 4% audience score and no critical reviews.

50
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:43,180
Not even the establishment is trying to prop this dumpster fire up.

51
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:47,080
Back in 2019 it was a bit of a controversy that film critics were shitting all over Rambo

52
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:51,200
Last Blood, before Rotten Tomatoes even opened up the movie for audience voting.

53
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:56,800
This massively enlarged prostate of a film can only make you wince with its badly acted

54
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:03,460
Geronto ultra-violence, its Trumpian fantasies of Mexican rapists, and a hilariously insecure

55
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:08,980
US border, and its crass enthusiasm for rape revenge attacks undertaken by a still-got-it

56
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:12,720
senior dude 73 years young on behalf of a sweet teenager.

57
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:18,140
Gabriella falls prey to a Trumpian array of bad hombres, including a pair of central-casting

58
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:20,040
cartel sex slavers.

59
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:24,680
Rambo has long been a symbol of imperialistic rage, and Last Blood is no exception.

60
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:28,520
Transplaining the action to Arizona provides the natural setting for a border drama that

61
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:32,560
plays into Trump-era fear-mongering, right down to its ominous shot of a border wall

62
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:35,160
as Rambo heads south in search of justice.

63
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:36,160
Trump Trump Trump.

64
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:37,920
Jesus, I forgot what things were like during the Trump era.

65
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:41,600
I wonder if these idiots are all still screeching about Trump nowadays, especially considering

66
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:44,920
that the reality of the situation on the Mexican border occasionally turns out to be

67
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:46,760
exactly like the movie.

68
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:52,180
Nowadays, Rambo Last Blood has a 26% from critics and an 81% from audiences, almost

69
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:55,240
like the screeching outrage of the progs only made people like it more.

70
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:57,540
But it could also be more simplistic than that.

71
00:03:57,540 --> 00:04:00,280
Sometimes people genuinely like simplistic movies, or even bad movies.

72
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:06,160
And I don't mean in an it's-so-bad-it's-amazing kind of way, like The Room, Troll 2, or Birdemic.

73
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:09,880
These movies generally end up with extremely low critic scores, with audience scores that

74
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:11,040
are all over the map.

75
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:15,480
Consider that The Road to El Dorado, A Goofy Movie, Hook, and Jumanji are all movies that

76
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:19,240
are just sort of okay, but nonetheless have a lot of nostalgia attached to them.

77
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:23,160
I'm not surprised that the audience score is higher based on love of the idea of The

78
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:25,360
Thing rather than the quality of The Thing itself.

79
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,800
You know the new Batwoman show?

80
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:30,800
One where they made her black for political reasons, and the costume design looks so shit

81
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:35,640
that the Batwoman porn parody had better costumes, and the director of said porn laughed at the

82
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:36,640
show about it?

83
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:39,600
Yeah, we've got an 80% from critics and a 16% from audiences.

84
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:43,800
I don't know if the show is actually good, probably not, but even if it was, public disrespect

85
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:47,620
for the source material by the creators is another reason for audience backlash.

86
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:51,840
You can see similar trends for stuff like Sausage Party, Ghostbusters 2016, The Last

87
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,380
Jedi, and Captain Marvel.

88
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:57,520
It turns out people don't want to eat shit, no matter how much the reviewers polish that

89
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:58,520
turd up.

90
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:02,680
In recent years, the various scores on Rotten Tomatoes have actually proven to impact a

91
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:06,720
film's success or failure, to the point that studios have begun to take notice.

92
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:10,120
There's been complaints from a whole bunch of different people about how movies are flopping

93
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:12,440
due to having a bad score on Rotten Tomatoes.

94
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:14,660
The answer to this, of course, is to make a better movie.

95
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:18,280
But Rotten Tomatoes itself has had its own share of controversies over the years.

96
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:22,360
Back when Joker came out, people noticed that a 3 out of 5 rating for the film was given

97
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:26,640
a Rotten Icon, but other movies around the same time, given the same rating, were given

98
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:27,640
a Fresh Icon.

99
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:31,840
The person who posted the reviews in question didn't know why it looked that way, and

100
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:34,720
that it wasn't their fault, but the fault of Rotten Tomatoes.

101
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:39,280
This led people to assume a subtle suppression attempt of Joker on Rotten Tomatoes, and because

102
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:42,800
of the highly politicized nature of that movie, everyone lost their minds over it.

103
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:47,160
The thing is, though, the article I'm showing on screen describing this story is around

104
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:51,680
the middle in terms of length, and ends by saying, ultimately all of this information

105
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:56,460
confirms that there is no conspiracy against Joker and Rotten Tomatoes doesn't have a bias.

106
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:58,920
But the article doesn't actually prove that conclusion.

107
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:03,220
No, really, I linked the article in the description, pause this video and go read it really quick.

108
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:07,060
It points out other instances of this same discrepancy, but doesn't actually explain

109
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:08,300
why it's happening.

110
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:12,280
Additionally, when Captain Marvel came out, Rotten Tomatoes deleted thousands of audience

111
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:16,220
reviews on release day, simultaneously claiming that the deletions were accidental and due

112
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:21,420
to a bug in their service, while also claiming that the reviews were false and created by

113
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:22,420
bots.

114
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:25,820
I mean, if they really were bot reviews, there would be no need to claim that their deletion

115
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:26,820
is a glitch.

116
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:29,080
They would be doing their job properly in that case.

117
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:32,000
Of course, it didn't matter to the score at the end of the day, Captain Marvel now

118
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,020
has 100,000 audience reviews with a 45% approval rating.

119
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:40,020
But I'm sure it mattered during that opening weekend rush, when a good chunk of the money

120
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:41,340
on the movie is made.

121
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:44,800
It doesn't matter if everybody knows the movie sucks nowadays, if you can hold off on publicizing

122
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:48,040
that realization for just long enough for the studio to make their money, it'll be worth

123
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,040
it.

124
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,040
The same thing happened with Doctor Who.

125
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:52,040
Frankly, in my opinion, Doctor Who is never good.

126
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:54,500
Its best moments really only reach the height of mediocre.

127
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:57,720
But their new stuff is a real dumpster fire, and fans have been letting their displeasure

128
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:01,980
be known on Rotten Tomatoes, where they roundly rejected season 12 of the show, only to later

129
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:04,440
discover that their reviews were being deleted by the site.

130
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:07,780
And don't get me started on explicitly political documentaries.

131
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:09,720
Mayor Pete seems to be a stinker.

132
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:12,440
I Am Greta and Hillary are even worse.

133
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:15,040
But probably the hardest ratio of all is for Fauci.

134
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,400
Here's something that's real interesting.

135
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:20,600
On most pages, you see a heading called What to Know, which includes an explanation of

136
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,160
the critic's Tomatometer score.

137
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:27,420
But only on the Fauci page is there an additional heading, explaining that 2% audience score.

138
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:31,200
After Fauci's digital release, some viewers express their dissatisfaction with the subject

139
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:33,660
matter by giving the documentary a Rotten rating.

140
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:36,900
In other words, Rotten Tomatoes felt the need to add a disclaimer to explain that people

141
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:40,340
are downloading the movie not based on the movie's quality, but because they don't

142
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:41,340
like Fauci.

143
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:42,340
And fair enough.

144
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:45,500
But when the movie in question is a biopic, it's reasonable to expect those two topics

145
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:46,500
to be linked.

146
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:50,860
Of course, like I said in my Get Woke, Go Broke video, all of this still doesn't prove

147
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:52,900
the existence of a hard and fast rule.

148
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:56,900
The RBG biopic is still well liked by both critics and the audience.

149
00:07:56,900 --> 00:08:01,640
The Cowboy Bebop live-action remake was panned by both, while The Wheel of Time is loved

150
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:02,640
by both.

151
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:08,420
And yet, both shows are doing so poorly financially that journos are feeling inclined to try and

152
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:10,520
spin their failures as positive.

153
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:14,200
How far do you have to go down the Bezmenov subversive hole before you start to say such

154
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:18,240
incredulous shit as, being rejected by the common person is a sign we're on the right

155
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,240
track?

156
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:20,240
Cope.

157
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,240
Seethe.

158
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:22,240
Unionize.

159
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:27,940
Over the den of sexual abuse, Vice.com, titled Rotten Tomatoes Reviews are the Culture Wars

160
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:32,300
New Battlefield, show that critics know exactly how all this looks, and that they have a need

161
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:34,860
to maintain that facade of neutrality.

162
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:37,820
Because if they're neutral and everything just so happens to be flowing their way from

163
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:41,360
a neutral power structure, then they're obviously just objectively correct.

164
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:45,300
And their opponents are all just right-wing review bombers who are mad about being phased

165
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:47,340
out in the new modern cultural landscape.

166
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:51,460
This article looks at Dave Chappelle's The Closer, 43% with critics and 96% with the

167
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:54,880
audience by the way, and frames it as a part of the wider culture war.

168
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:59,040
Over the past few years Rotten Tomatoes has attracted political actors, especially right-wing

169
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:02,360
ones, to the site to review big pop culture events like Marvel movies.

170
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:04,420
This is a part of a broader cottage industry.

171
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:08,160
Weirdos on YouTube, for example, make dozens of videos about the box office numbers of

172
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:11,660
Marvel movies with non-white, non-male leads in order to make a central point about how

173
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:16,960
being woke, i.e. making movies starring people who aren't white men, leads to poor box

174
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,080
office numbers.

175
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:21,360
Of course, Vice would describe their political opposition like this.

176
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:25,940
The term cottage industry is only partially true, but its use delegitimizes critics of

177
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:30,360
broader cultural leftism specifically because those critics lack institutional backing.

178
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:34,820
The description of woke as being about movies that don't star white men losing money is

179
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:36,560
an obvious oversimplification.

180
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:40,200
For example, the issue with the Star Wars sequels isn't that Rey is a woman, it's

181
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:42,900
that Rey is a shitty character, playing out a shitty story.

182
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:48,200
And the whole weirdos on YouTube remark is wallpapered over a deep insecurity and resentment

183
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:52,720
that online print media has towards YouTubers nowadays as YouTubers replace them, just as

184
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:57,360
online print media replaced TV, TV replaced radio, and radio replaced newspapers.

185
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,520
This is a problem far larger than just Rotten Tomatoes.

186
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:03,200
Remember back in 2020 when The Last of Us Part II dropped, one of the shittiest games

187
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:07,400
released in the past decade or so, and it was shown on Metacritic to have a 95% reviewer

188
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:11,140
score and a 3.3 out of 10 user score?

189
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:14,980
Meanwhile, releasing around the same time was the remake of Spongebob Squarepants Battle

190
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:18,740
for Bikini Bottom, an absolutely beloved game by fans of the original, where the critics

191
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:21,940
score was 66% and the user score was 9.1 out of 10.

192
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:25,140
I'll tell you straight away, I never liked the Spongebob game, and the remake wasn't

193
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:27,900
very good, at least not for me, but that's because I didn't play the original game

194
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:28,900
as a kid.

195
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:30,020
There's no nostalgia for me there.

196
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:33,900
And while nostalgia can cloud your judgement, that doesn't mean that the fun derived from

197
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:35,940
nostalgia is somehow illegitimate.

198
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:37,100
People just like what they like.

199
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:41,060
And if that means the dirty, unwashed masters are going to massively upvote their mediocre

200
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:44,340
Spongebob game because it was a formative part of their childhood, while rejecting The

201
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:48,540
Last of Us Part II because it's absolutely fucking awful, who might argue?

202
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:50,420
I do the exact same thing with Earthbound.

203
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:53,620
That game's got loads of technical problems, but I love it because I played it when I was

204
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:54,620
a kid.

205
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:57,260
The difference is, I don't feel personally attacked when people say they don't like

206
00:10:57,260 --> 00:10:58,260
Earthbound.

207
00:10:58,260 --> 00:11:01,280
I don't feel like it's some huge assault on a grand political project I've been slowly

208
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:04,820
building up behind the scenes, subverting institutions left and right in order to piece

209
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:07,240
it all together, because I'm not a fucking commie.

210
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:08,500
That is the reason they're doing it.

211
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:12,980
The everything is political, quasi-fascist mentality pouring out of prog activism at

212
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:15,300
breakneck pace nowadays is something to behold.

213
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:17,380
That's the political goal of all of this stuff.

214
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:20,020
Again, just like the last video, you've gotta read Gramsci.

215
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:22,940
But there's also a distinct personal reason for it too.

216
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:26,020
All of these aspiring professional critics on Rotten Tomatoes and elsewhere, and I say

217
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:29,300
aspiring because there's no way in hell most of them are living off this shit, are

218
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:34,460
the product of years of not being taken seriously by anybody besides film school dropouts and

219
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:36,140
SJW indie developers.

220
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:40,220
And they reek of desperation to be recognized, to be taken seriously.

221
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:44,460
Everything screams adulthood to the stunted growth of a man-child than making everything

222
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:45,460
political.

223
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:48,460
Meanwhile, an actual adult knows that there's a time and place for politics, but there's

224
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:50,460
also a time and place where you turn it off and relax.

225
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:54,020
We're at the end of the video, and where this topic of conversation continues is far

226
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:58,220
beyond the scope of Rotten Tomatoes, so we'll have to do a deep dive into it another time.

227
00:11:58,220 --> 00:12:01,880
But here's the basic idea, the split between critics and the common person is a symptom

228
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:06,200
of a much larger problem, and that problem is best described as the general lack of trust

229
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,660
in our institutions right now.

230
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:11,540
Consider this, when you buy food at the store, how do you truly know that the food is what's

231
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:12,540
advertised?

232
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:14,720
Well, that first level trust will be established by yourself.

233
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:17,600
If the sign says apple and you look at it and it looks like an apple, you're probably

234
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:18,820
going to assume it's an apple.

235
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:21,900
But for example, how do you know what the ingredients are in a box of crackers, or in

236
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:22,900
a loaf of bread?

237
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:26,020
Well, you can always check out the nutritional facts printed on the box, but how do you know

238
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:27,060
those are accurate?

239
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:30,820
The answer to that is that it's generally illegal for companies to falsify those sorts

240
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:31,820
of things.

241
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:35,260
But how do you truly know if the system is working properly for this specific box that

242
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:36,260
you're holding?

243
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:37,700
How do you know that there wasn't a mistake in the printing?

244
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:40,260
How do you know that this company didn't pay off the government?

245
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:42,740
How do you know the whole thing just isn't a huge sham?

246
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:45,020
We can follow this logic down to its inevitable conclusion.

247
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:48,900
You can only truly know what you yourself are currently personally experiencing.

248
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:50,460
Not even what you experienced.

249
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:52,420
Not even the past is really that safe.

250
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:55,260
That might have been falsified, or maybe you misremember it, but the situation has changed

251
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:56,260
since then.

252
00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:58,740
Who knows if your old childhood home or school still looks like that?

253
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:02,820
This is the how do you know if Africa exists if you're not currently living there problem.

254
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:06,820
We have many trustworthy accounts of Africa's existence, but there's still a very tiny probability

255
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:08,220
that it's not real.

256
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:10,800
Trust in social institutions works the same way.

257
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:13,700
As an example, consider the current coronavirus situation right now.

258
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:17,500
The governments of the world, in lockstep with the news and social media and Hollywood,

259
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:22,260
are all pushing the vaccine extremely hard and stifling even good faith conversations

260
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:23,260
about it.

261
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:26,040
Even assuming that the vaccine is perfectly safe for everybody at all times.

262
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:29,260
You shouldn't be surprised that there's a sizable minority of people who just don't

263
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:32,500
want to get it, considering how people in power were completely willing to shred the

264
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:35,400
social contract on live TV for the world to see.

265
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:37,880
The issue isn't whether or not the vaccine works.

266
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:41,780
The issue is whether or not you trust the various social institutions telling you that

267
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:42,780
it works.

268
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:47,040
And the way that those institutions have behaved during the pandemic have contributed to a

269
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:50,340
widespread feeling that public trust has been breached.

270
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:54,980
The commonplace mockery of stuff like experts weigh in, studies show, and so on, shows exactly

271
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:55,980
what I mean.

272
00:13:55,980 --> 00:14:00,060
An expert in any field is not only required to have expert level knowledge on the topic

273
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:03,980
at hand, but also needs to be considered trustworthy enough to be listened to by those

274
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:07,500
people who don't have that knowledge, but would nonetheless benefit by listening to

275
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:08,500
them.

276
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:12,980
Trust is built up by, among other things, being consistently apolitical in their judgement,

277
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:16,760
and showing political bias is one fast way to destroy that trust among the common people.

278
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:19,020
And so, we have our current problems.

279
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:23,260
From people seeing the heavy hand of COVID authoritarianism and rejecting all measures

280
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:26,540
outright, regardless of whether or not they would actually work, all the way down to movie

281
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:30,420
critics being biased on RottenTomatoes.com and facing a backlash from people who reject

282
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:34,100
them out of principle, trust in our political, social, and cultural institutions is at an

283
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:39,060
all time low, and the only way to fix that situation is to be as honest and truthful

284
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:41,020
as you can in your own dealings.

285
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:45,520
This is why I fully reject that boneheaded view on the right that thinks that non-leftists

286
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:49,680
should be just as bad as leftists, but in the other direction, and that all institutions

287
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:54,020
are inherently corrupt and always will be, that's just some paleo-libertarian cope frankly.

288
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:57,940
Either view will create the exact same authoritarianism that we're currently facing, just with a

289
00:14:57,940 --> 00:15:00,060
right-wing coat of paint instead of a left-wing one.

290
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:03,780
I'm sure that take will get me pushback from rightoids that watch me, but that's fine.

291
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:08,060
The reason I always say in my videos what I genuinely believe to be the truth is because

292
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:12,660
even though I'm not a journalist, I am part of an industry that is replacing journalism,

293
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:16,320
and I would never want you to stop trusting me the way that we have stopped trusting them.

294
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:20,740
The only way out of this nightmare situation is for us to be trustworthy in a way that

295
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:22,740
Prague politics will not allow.

296
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:27,060
In other words, truth, rather than pendulum swinging to the far right because the far

297
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:30,380
left exists, is the greatest cure for socialist subversion.
