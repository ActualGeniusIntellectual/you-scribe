0	9740	The last video was all about the train wreck that is Santa Inc, go watch that if you missed
9740	10740	it.
10740	14340	One of the best barometers of just how bad Santa Inc is, and this also works for the
14340	18660	Star Wars sequel trilogy, for the cowboy bebop live action remake, ghostbusters 2016, or
18660	23560	really any shitty woke modern retelling of a classic story, is the ratio it got on Rotten
23560	24560	Tomatoes.
24560	28900	Rotten Tomatoes is a website for movie reviews founded in 1998, boy looking at this brings
28900	29900	back memories.
29900	33880	It was meant to be a place where anybody could log in and leave reviews of any movie, following
33880	38940	in that late 90s and early 2000s trend of internet services as democratizing cultural
38940	39940	forces.
39940	42740	The system is easy enough to understand, there's a series of professional film critics who
42740	44580	contribute to a film's fresh score.
44580	50560	A total average score of 60% or higher indicates a fresh film, 59% or lower a rotten one.
50560	56860	A certified fresh score indicates 70% or higher with at least 80 reviews and 5 from top critics,
56860	58140	whatever that refers to.
58140	60400	Meanwhile the audience score is more simplistic.
60400	63700	The audience can't rate from 0 to 100, but from 1 star to 5.
63700	68460	A full popcorn bucket means that more viewers rated the film 3.5 stars or higher, and an
68460	72980	empty popcorn bucket means that more viewers rated the film as lower than 3.5 stars.
72980	73980	Seems real simple right?
73980	74980	What could go wrong here?
74980	78460	Could it be that given enough time and political interest, the creator class and the audience
78460	82340	class would have diverging interests, leading to those two scores representing entirely
82340	83740	different things than advertised?
83740	86080	I mean it's 2021 so yeah that's exactly what happened.
86080	90360	The critical score seems to be balanced heavily in favor of left-leaning politics, and that's
90360	93800	no surprise to me, it makes sense that a more left-leaning person would have the personality
93800	95880	type that draws them to professional film critique.
95880	99960	But that doesn't mean that the audience score is a mirror of that, being heavily balanced
99960	101960	in favor of right-leaning politics.
101960	105520	In fact the audience score seems to be more balanced in favor of the apolitical.
105520	109700	Leftists, rightists, and centrists all have access to the audience score, and I'm not
109700	112400	surprised that a more neutral take would shake out of that.
112400	116520	So when you see a film that has a high critical score but a low audience score, your best
116520	120720	bet is that it's a bunch of woke garbage that explicitly pushes a prog message to the
120720	121960	detriment of quality.
121960	126040	While if you see a film that has a low critical score but a high audience score, it's either
126040	130180	explicitly anti-woke, which is kinda rare nowadays, or more commonly it's a series
130180	134060	that has ducked the revisionist trend as of late and held off in the politics in order
134060	136300	to create a more authentic experience.
136300	140540	Also keep in mind that this effect can still take place even if the film itself is apolitical.
140540	145060	If a writer, director, or actor makes a very public political statement, or finds themselves
145060	148860	in some kind of controversy online, then this effect will still happen, and it can bend
148860	150860	either way, left or non-left.
150860	152180	Here let me show you some examples.
152180	156100	Let's begin with Santa Inc, that godforsaken series that's kicked off my dive down this
156100	157100	rabbit hole.
157100	160260	Yep, it's still at a 4% audience score and no critical reviews.
160260	163180	Not even the establishment is trying to prop this dumpster fire up.
163180	167080	Back in 2019 it was a bit of a controversy that film critics were shitting all over Rambo
167080	171200	Last Blood, before Rotten Tomatoes even opened up the movie for audience voting.
171200	176800	This massively enlarged prostate of a film can only make you wince with its badly acted
176800	183460	Geronto ultra-violence, its Trumpian fantasies of Mexican rapists, and a hilariously insecure
183460	188980	US border, and its crass enthusiasm for rape revenge attacks undertaken by a still-got-it
188980	192720	senior dude 73 years young on behalf of a sweet teenager.
192720	198140	Gabriella falls prey to a Trumpian array of bad hombres, including a pair of central-casting
198140	200040	cartel sex slavers.
200040	204680	Rambo has long been a symbol of imperialistic rage, and Last Blood is no exception.
204680	208520	Transplaining the action to Arizona provides the natural setting for a border drama that
208520	212560	plays into Trump-era fear-mongering, right down to its ominous shot of a border wall
212560	215160	as Rambo heads south in search of justice.
215160	216160	Trump Trump Trump.
216160	217920	Jesus, I forgot what things were like during the Trump era.
217920	221600	I wonder if these idiots are all still screeching about Trump nowadays, especially considering
221600	224920	that the reality of the situation on the Mexican border occasionally turns out to be
224920	226760	exactly like the movie.
226760	232180	Nowadays, Rambo Last Blood has a 26% from critics and an 81% from audiences, almost
232180	235240	like the screeching outrage of the progs only made people like it more.
235240	237540	But it could also be more simplistic than that.
237540	240280	Sometimes people genuinely like simplistic movies, or even bad movies.
240280	246160	And I don't mean in an it's-so-bad-it's-amazing kind of way, like The Room, Troll 2, or Birdemic.
246160	249880	These movies generally end up with extremely low critic scores, with audience scores that
249880	251040	are all over the map.
251040	255480	Consider that The Road to El Dorado, A Goofy Movie, Hook, and Jumanji are all movies that
255480	259240	are just sort of okay, but nonetheless have a lot of nostalgia attached to them.
259240	263160	I'm not surprised that the audience score is higher based on love of the idea of The
263160	265360	Thing rather than the quality of The Thing itself.
265360	266800	You know the new Batwoman show?
266800	270800	One where they made her black for political reasons, and the costume design looks so shit
270800	275640	that the Batwoman porn parody had better costumes, and the director of said porn laughed at the
275640	276640	show about it?
276640	279600	Yeah, we've got an 80% from critics and a 16% from audiences.
280160	283800	I don't know if the show is actually good, probably not, but even if it was, public disrespect
283800	287620	for the source material by the creators is another reason for audience backlash.
287620	291840	You can see similar trends for stuff like Sausage Party, Ghostbusters 2016, The Last
291840	293380	Jedi, and Captain Marvel.
293380	297520	It turns out people don't want to eat shit, no matter how much the reviewers polish that
297520	298520	turd up.
298520	302680	In recent years, the various scores on Rotten Tomatoes have actually proven to impact a
302680	306720	film's success or failure, to the point that studios have begun to take notice.
306720	310120	There's been complaints from a whole bunch of different people about how movies are flopping
310120	312440	due to having a bad score on Rotten Tomatoes.
312440	314660	The answer to this, of course, is to make a better movie.
314660	318280	But Rotten Tomatoes itself has had its own share of controversies over the years.
318280	322360	Back when Joker came out, people noticed that a 3 out of 5 rating for the film was given
322360	326640	a Rotten Icon, but other movies around the same time, given the same rating, were given
326640	327640	a Fresh Icon.
327640	331840	The person who posted the reviews in question didn't know why it looked that way, and
331840	334720	that it wasn't their fault, but the fault of Rotten Tomatoes.
334720	339280	This led people to assume a subtle suppression attempt of Joker on Rotten Tomatoes, and because
339280	342800	of the highly politicized nature of that movie, everyone lost their minds over it.
342800	347160	The thing is, though, the article I'm showing on screen describing this story is around
347160	351680	the middle in terms of length, and ends by saying, ultimately all of this information
351680	356460	confirms that there is no conspiracy against Joker and Rotten Tomatoes doesn't have a bias.
356460	358920	But the article doesn't actually prove that conclusion.
358920	363220	No, really, I linked the article in the description, pause this video and go read it really quick.
363220	367060	It points out other instances of this same discrepancy, but doesn't actually explain
367060	368300	why it's happening.
368300	372280	Additionally, when Captain Marvel came out, Rotten Tomatoes deleted thousands of audience
372280	376220	reviews on release day, simultaneously claiming that the deletions were accidental and due
376220	381420	to a bug in their service, while also claiming that the reviews were false and created by
381420	382420	bots.
382420	385820	I mean, if they really were bot reviews, there would be no need to claim that their deletion
385820	386820	is a glitch.
386820	389080	They would be doing their job properly in that case.
389080	392000	Of course, it didn't matter to the score at the end of the day, Captain Marvel now
392000	396020	has 100,000 audience reviews with a 45% approval rating.
396020	400020	But I'm sure it mattered during that opening weekend rush, when a good chunk of the money
400020	401340	on the movie is made.
401340	404800	It doesn't matter if everybody knows the movie sucks nowadays, if you can hold off on publicizing
404800	408040	that realization for just long enough for the studio to make their money, it'll be worth
408040	409040	it.
409040	410040	The same thing happened with Doctor Who.
410040	412040	Frankly, in my opinion, Doctor Who is never good.
412040	414500	Its best moments really only reach the height of mediocre.
414500	417720	But their new stuff is a real dumpster fire, and fans have been letting their displeasure
417720	421980	be known on Rotten Tomatoes, where they roundly rejected season 12 of the show, only to later
421980	424440	discover that their reviews were being deleted by the site.
424440	427780	And don't get me started on explicitly political documentaries.
427780	429720	Mayor Pete seems to be a stinker.
429720	432440	I Am Greta and Hillary are even worse.
432440	435040	But probably the hardest ratio of all is for Fauci.
435040	436400	Here's something that's real interesting.
436400	440600	On most pages, you see a heading called What to Know, which includes an explanation of
440600	442160	the critic's Tomatometer score.
442160	447420	But only on the Fauci page is there an additional heading, explaining that 2% audience score.
447420	451200	After Fauci's digital release, some viewers express their dissatisfaction with the subject
451200	453660	matter by giving the documentary a Rotten rating.
453660	456900	In other words, Rotten Tomatoes felt the need to add a disclaimer to explain that people
456900	460340	are downloading the movie not based on the movie's quality, but because they don't
460340	461340	like Fauci.
461340	462340	And fair enough.
462340	465500	But when the movie in question is a biopic, it's reasonable to expect those two topics
465500	466500	to be linked.
466500	470860	Of course, like I said in my Get Woke, Go Broke video, all of this still doesn't prove
470860	472900	the existence of a hard and fast rule.
472900	476900	The RBG biopic is still well liked by both critics and the audience.
476900	481640	The Cowboy Bebop live-action remake was panned by both, while The Wheel of Time is loved
481640	482640	by both.
482640	488420	And yet, both shows are doing so poorly financially that journos are feeling inclined to try and
488420	490520	spin their failures as positive.
490520	494200	How far do you have to go down the Bezmenov subversive hole before you start to say such
494200	498240	incredulous shit as, being rejected by the common person is a sign we're on the right
498240	499240	track?
499240	500240	Cope.
500240	501240	Seethe.
501240	502240	Unionize.
502240	507940	Over the den of sexual abuse, Vice.com, titled Rotten Tomatoes Reviews are the Culture Wars
507940	512300	New Battlefield, show that critics know exactly how all this looks, and that they have a need
512300	514860	to maintain that facade of neutrality.
514860	517820	Because if they're neutral and everything just so happens to be flowing their way from
517820	521360	a neutral power structure, then they're obviously just objectively correct.
521360	525300	And their opponents are all just right-wing review bombers who are mad about being phased
525300	527340	out in the new modern cultural landscape.
527340	531460	This article looks at Dave Chappelle's The Closer, 43% with critics and 96% with the
531460	534880	audience by the way, and frames it as a part of the wider culture war.
534880	539040	Over the past few years Rotten Tomatoes has attracted political actors, especially right-wing
539040	542360	ones, to the site to review big pop culture events like Marvel movies.
542360	544420	This is a part of a broader cottage industry.
544420	548160	Weirdos on YouTube, for example, make dozens of videos about the box office numbers of
548160	551660	Marvel movies with non-white, non-male leads in order to make a central point about how
551660	556960	being woke, i.e. making movies starring people who aren't white men, leads to poor box
556960	558080	office numbers.
558080	561360	Of course, Vice would describe their political opposition like this.
561360	565940	The term cottage industry is only partially true, but its use delegitimizes critics of
565940	570360	broader cultural leftism specifically because those critics lack institutional backing.
570360	574820	The description of woke as being about movies that don't star white men losing money is
574820	576560	an obvious oversimplification.
576560	580200	For example, the issue with the Star Wars sequels isn't that Rey is a woman, it's
580200	582900	that Rey is a shitty character, playing out a shitty story.
582900	588200	And the whole weirdos on YouTube remark is wallpapered over a deep insecurity and resentment
588200	592720	that online print media has towards YouTubers nowadays as YouTubers replace them, just as
592720	597360	online print media replaced TV, TV replaced radio, and radio replaced newspapers.
597360	599520	This is a problem far larger than just Rotten Tomatoes.
599520	603200	Remember back in 2020 when The Last of Us Part II dropped, one of the shittiest games
603200	607400	released in the past decade or so, and it was shown on Metacritic to have a 95% reviewer
607400	611140	score and a 3.3 out of 10 user score?
611140	614980	Meanwhile, releasing around the same time was the remake of Spongebob Squarepants Battle
614980	618740	for Bikini Bottom, an absolutely beloved game by fans of the original, where the critics
618740	621940	score was 66% and the user score was 9.1 out of 10.
621940	625140	I'll tell you straight away, I never liked the Spongebob game, and the remake wasn't
625140	627900	very good, at least not for me, but that's because I didn't play the original game
627900	628900	as a kid.
628900	630020	There's no nostalgia for me there.
630020	633900	And while nostalgia can cloud your judgement, that doesn't mean that the fun derived from
633900	635940	nostalgia is somehow illegitimate.
635940	637100	People just like what they like.
637100	641060	And if that means the dirty, unwashed masters are going to massively upvote their mediocre
641060	644340	Spongebob game because it was a formative part of their childhood, while rejecting The
644340	648540	Last of Us Part II because it's absolutely fucking awful, who might argue?
648540	650420	I do the exact same thing with Earthbound.
650420	653620	That game's got loads of technical problems, but I love it because I played it when I was
653620	654620	a kid.
654620	657260	The difference is, I don't feel personally attacked when people say they don't like
657260	658260	Earthbound.
658260	661280	I don't feel like it's some huge assault on a grand political project I've been slowly
661280	664820	building up behind the scenes, subverting institutions left and right in order to piece
664820	667240	it all together, because I'm not a fucking commie.
667240	668500	That is the reason they're doing it.
668500	672980	The everything is political, quasi-fascist mentality pouring out of prog activism at
672980	675300	breakneck pace nowadays is something to behold.
675300	677380	That's the political goal of all of this stuff.
677380	680020	Again, just like the last video, you've gotta read Gramsci.
680020	682940	But there's also a distinct personal reason for it too.
682940	686020	All of these aspiring professional critics on Rotten Tomatoes and elsewhere, and I say
686020	689300	aspiring because there's no way in hell most of them are living off this shit, are
689300	694460	the product of years of not being taken seriously by anybody besides film school dropouts and
694460	696140	SJW indie developers.
696140	700220	And they reek of desperation to be recognized, to be taken seriously.
700220	704460	Everything screams adulthood to the stunted growth of a man-child than making everything
704460	705460	political.
705460	708460	Meanwhile, an actual adult knows that there's a time and place for politics, but there's
708460	710460	also a time and place where you turn it off and relax.
710460	714020	We're at the end of the video, and where this topic of conversation continues is far
714020	718220	beyond the scope of Rotten Tomatoes, so we'll have to do a deep dive into it another time.
718220	721880	But here's the basic idea, the split between critics and the common person is a symptom
721880	726200	of a much larger problem, and that problem is best described as the general lack of trust
726200	727660	in our institutions right now.
727660	731540	Consider this, when you buy food at the store, how do you truly know that the food is what's
731540	732540	advertised?
732540	734720	Well, that first level trust will be established by yourself.
734720	737600	If the sign says apple and you look at it and it looks like an apple, you're probably
737600	738820	going to assume it's an apple.
738820	741900	But for example, how do you know what the ingredients are in a box of crackers, or in
741900	742900	a loaf of bread?
742900	746020	Well, you can always check out the nutritional facts printed on the box, but how do you know
746020	747060	those are accurate?
747060	750820	The answer to that is that it's generally illegal for companies to falsify those sorts
750820	751820	of things.
751820	755260	But how do you truly know if the system is working properly for this specific box that
755260	756260	you're holding?
756260	757700	How do you know that there wasn't a mistake in the printing?
757700	760260	How do you know that this company didn't pay off the government?
760260	762740	How do you know the whole thing just isn't a huge sham?
762740	765020	We can follow this logic down to its inevitable conclusion.
765020	768900	You can only truly know what you yourself are currently personally experiencing.
768900	770460	Not even what you experienced.
770460	772420	Not even the past is really that safe.
772420	775260	That might have been falsified, or maybe you misremember it, but the situation has changed
775260	776260	since then.
776260	778740	Who knows if your old childhood home or school still looks like that?
778740	782820	This is the how do you know if Africa exists if you're not currently living there problem.
782820	786820	We have many trustworthy accounts of Africa's existence, but there's still a very tiny probability
786820	788220	that it's not real.
788220	790800	Trust in social institutions works the same way.
790800	793700	As an example, consider the current coronavirus situation right now.
793700	797500	The governments of the world, in lockstep with the news and social media and Hollywood,
797500	802260	are all pushing the vaccine extremely hard and stifling even good faith conversations
802260	803260	about it.
803260	806040	Even assuming that the vaccine is perfectly safe for everybody at all times.
806040	809260	You shouldn't be surprised that there's a sizable minority of people who just don't
809260	812500	want to get it, considering how people in power were completely willing to shred the
812500	815400	social contract on live TV for the world to see.
815400	817880	The issue isn't whether or not the vaccine works.
817880	821780	The issue is whether or not you trust the various social institutions telling you that
821780	822780	it works.
822780	827040	And the way that those institutions have behaved during the pandemic have contributed to a
827040	830340	widespread feeling that public trust has been breached.
830340	834980	The commonplace mockery of stuff like experts weigh in, studies show, and so on, shows exactly
834980	835980	what I mean.
835980	840060	An expert in any field is not only required to have expert level knowledge on the topic
840060	843980	at hand, but also needs to be considered trustworthy enough to be listened to by those
843980	847500	people who don't have that knowledge, but would nonetheless benefit by listening to
847500	848500	them.
848500	852980	Trust is built up by, among other things, being consistently apolitical in their judgement,
852980	856760	and showing political bias is one fast way to destroy that trust among the common people.
856760	859020	And so, we have our current problems.
859020	863260	From people seeing the heavy hand of COVID authoritarianism and rejecting all measures
863260	866540	outright, regardless of whether or not they would actually work, all the way down to movie
866540	870420	critics being biased on RottenTomatoes.com and facing a backlash from people who reject
870420	874100	them out of principle, trust in our political, social, and cultural institutions is at an
874100	879060	all time low, and the only way to fix that situation is to be as honest and truthful
879060	881020	as you can in your own dealings.
881020	885520	This is why I fully reject that boneheaded view on the right that thinks that non-leftists
885520	889680	should be just as bad as leftists, but in the other direction, and that all institutions
889680	894020	are inherently corrupt and always will be, that's just some paleo-libertarian cope frankly.
894020	897940	Either view will create the exact same authoritarianism that we're currently facing, just with a
897940	900060	right-wing coat of paint instead of a left-wing one.
900060	903780	I'm sure that take will get me pushback from rightoids that watch me, but that's fine.
903780	908060	The reason I always say in my videos what I genuinely believe to be the truth is because
908060	912660	even though I'm not a journalist, I am part of an industry that is replacing journalism,
912660	916320	and I would never want you to stop trusting me the way that we have stopped trusting them.
916320	920740	The only way out of this nightmare situation is for us to be trustworthy in a way that
920740	922740	Prague politics will not allow.
922740	927060	In other words, truth, rather than pendulum swinging to the far right because the far
927060	930380	left exists, is the greatest cure for socialist subversion.
