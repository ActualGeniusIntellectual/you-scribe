WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:09.740
The last video was all about the train wreck that is Santa Inc, go watch that if you missed

00:09.740 --> 00:10.740
it.

00:10.740 --> 00:14.340
One of the best barometers of just how bad Santa Inc is, and this also works for the

00:14.340 --> 00:18.660
Star Wars sequel trilogy, for the cowboy bebop live action remake, ghostbusters 2016, or

00:18.660 --> 00:23.560
really any shitty woke modern retelling of a classic story, is the ratio it got on Rotten

00:23.560 --> 00:24.560
Tomatoes.

00:24.560 --> 00:28.900
Rotten Tomatoes is a website for movie reviews founded in 1998, boy looking at this brings

00:28.900 --> 00:29.900
back memories.

00:29.900 --> 00:33.880
It was meant to be a place where anybody could log in and leave reviews of any movie, following

00:33.880 --> 00:38.940
in that late 90s and early 2000s trend of internet services as democratizing cultural

00:38.940 --> 00:39.940
forces.

00:39.940 --> 00:42.740
The system is easy enough to understand, there's a series of professional film critics who

00:42.740 --> 00:44.580
contribute to a film's fresh score.

00:44.580 --> 00:50.560
A total average score of 60% or higher indicates a fresh film, 59% or lower a rotten one.

00:50.560 --> 00:56.860
A certified fresh score indicates 70% or higher with at least 80 reviews and 5 from top critics,

00:56.860 --> 00:58.140
whatever that refers to.

00:58.140 --> 01:00.400
Meanwhile the audience score is more simplistic.

01:00.400 --> 01:03.700
The audience can't rate from 0 to 100, but from 1 star to 5.

01:03.700 --> 01:08.460
A full popcorn bucket means that more viewers rated the film 3.5 stars or higher, and an

01:08.460 --> 01:12.980
empty popcorn bucket means that more viewers rated the film as lower than 3.5 stars.

01:12.980 --> 01:13.980
Seems real simple right?

01:13.980 --> 01:14.980
What could go wrong here?

01:14.980 --> 01:18.460
Could it be that given enough time and political interest, the creator class and the audience

01:18.460 --> 01:22.340
class would have diverging interests, leading to those two scores representing entirely

01:22.340 --> 01:23.740
different things than advertised?

01:23.740 --> 01:26.080
I mean it's 2021 so yeah that's exactly what happened.

01:26.080 --> 01:30.360
The critical score seems to be balanced heavily in favor of left-leaning politics, and that's

01:30.360 --> 01:33.800
no surprise to me, it makes sense that a more left-leaning person would have the personality

01:33.800 --> 01:35.880
type that draws them to professional film critique.

01:35.880 --> 01:39.960
But that doesn't mean that the audience score is a mirror of that, being heavily balanced

01:39.960 --> 01:41.960
in favor of right-leaning politics.

01:41.960 --> 01:45.520
In fact the audience score seems to be more balanced in favor of the apolitical.

01:45.520 --> 01:49.700
Leftists, rightists, and centrists all have access to the audience score, and I'm not

01:49.700 --> 01:52.400
surprised that a more neutral take would shake out of that.

01:52.400 --> 01:56.520
So when you see a film that has a high critical score but a low audience score, your best

01:56.520 --> 02:00.720
bet is that it's a bunch of woke garbage that explicitly pushes a prog message to the

02:00.720 --> 02:01.960
detriment of quality.

02:01.960 --> 02:06.040
While if you see a film that has a low critical score but a high audience score, it's either

02:06.040 --> 02:10.180
explicitly anti-woke, which is kinda rare nowadays, or more commonly it's a series

02:10.180 --> 02:14.060
that has ducked the revisionist trend as of late and held off in the politics in order

02:14.060 --> 02:16.300
to create a more authentic experience.

02:16.300 --> 02:20.540
Also keep in mind that this effect can still take place even if the film itself is apolitical.

02:20.540 --> 02:25.060
If a writer, director, or actor makes a very public political statement, or finds themselves

02:25.060 --> 02:28.860
in some kind of controversy online, then this effect will still happen, and it can bend

02:28.860 --> 02:30.860
either way, left or non-left.

02:30.860 --> 02:32.180
Here let me show you some examples.

02:32.180 --> 02:36.100
Let's begin with Santa Inc, that godforsaken series that's kicked off my dive down this

02:36.100 --> 02:37.100
rabbit hole.

02:37.100 --> 02:40.260
Yep, it's still at a 4% audience score and no critical reviews.

02:40.260 --> 02:43.180
Not even the establishment is trying to prop this dumpster fire up.

02:43.180 --> 02:47.080
Back in 2019 it was a bit of a controversy that film critics were shitting all over Rambo

02:47.080 --> 02:51.200
Last Blood, before Rotten Tomatoes even opened up the movie for audience voting.

02:51.200 --> 02:56.800
This massively enlarged prostate of a film can only make you wince with its badly acted

02:56.800 --> 03:03.460
Geronto ultra-violence, its Trumpian fantasies of Mexican rapists, and a hilariously insecure

03:03.460 --> 03:08.980
US border, and its crass enthusiasm for rape revenge attacks undertaken by a still-got-it

03:08.980 --> 03:12.720
senior dude 73 years young on behalf of a sweet teenager.

03:12.720 --> 03:18.140
Gabriella falls prey to a Trumpian array of bad hombres, including a pair of central-casting

03:18.140 --> 03:20.040
cartel sex slavers.

03:20.040 --> 03:24.680
Rambo has long been a symbol of imperialistic rage, and Last Blood is no exception.

03:24.680 --> 03:28.520
Transplaining the action to Arizona provides the natural setting for a border drama that

03:28.520 --> 03:32.560
plays into Trump-era fear-mongering, right down to its ominous shot of a border wall

03:32.560 --> 03:35.160
as Rambo heads south in search of justice.

03:35.160 --> 03:36.160
Trump Trump Trump.

03:36.160 --> 03:37.920
Jesus, I forgot what things were like during the Trump era.

03:37.920 --> 03:41.600
I wonder if these idiots are all still screeching about Trump nowadays, especially considering

03:41.600 --> 03:44.920
that the reality of the situation on the Mexican border occasionally turns out to be

03:44.920 --> 03:46.760
exactly like the movie.

03:46.760 --> 03:52.180
Nowadays, Rambo Last Blood has a 26% from critics and an 81% from audiences, almost

03:52.180 --> 03:55.240
like the screeching outrage of the progs only made people like it more.

03:55.240 --> 03:57.540
But it could also be more simplistic than that.

03:57.540 --> 04:00.280
Sometimes people genuinely like simplistic movies, or even bad movies.

04:00.280 --> 04:06.160
And I don't mean in an it's-so-bad-it's-amazing kind of way, like The Room, Troll 2, or Birdemic.

04:06.160 --> 04:09.880
These movies generally end up with extremely low critic scores, with audience scores that

04:09.880 --> 04:11.040
are all over the map.

04:11.040 --> 04:15.480
Consider that The Road to El Dorado, A Goofy Movie, Hook, and Jumanji are all movies that

04:15.480 --> 04:19.240
are just sort of okay, but nonetheless have a lot of nostalgia attached to them.

04:19.240 --> 04:23.160
I'm not surprised that the audience score is higher based on love of the idea of The

04:23.160 --> 04:25.360
Thing rather than the quality of The Thing itself.

04:25.360 --> 04:26.800
You know the new Batwoman show?

04:26.800 --> 04:30.800
One where they made her black for political reasons, and the costume design looks so shit

04:30.800 --> 04:35.640
that the Batwoman porn parody had better costumes, and the director of said porn laughed at the

04:35.640 --> 04:36.640
show about it?

04:36.640 --> 04:39.600
Yeah, we've got an 80% from critics and a 16% from audiences.

04:40.160 --> 04:43.800
I don't know if the show is actually good, probably not, but even if it was, public disrespect

04:43.800 --> 04:47.620
for the source material by the creators is another reason for audience backlash.

04:47.620 --> 04:51.840
You can see similar trends for stuff like Sausage Party, Ghostbusters 2016, The Last

04:51.840 --> 04:53.380
Jedi, and Captain Marvel.

04:53.380 --> 04:57.520
It turns out people don't want to eat shit, no matter how much the reviewers polish that

04:57.520 --> 04:58.520
turd up.

04:58.520 --> 05:02.680
In recent years, the various scores on Rotten Tomatoes have actually proven to impact a

05:02.680 --> 05:06.720
film's success or failure, to the point that studios have begun to take notice.

05:06.720 --> 05:10.120
There's been complaints from a whole bunch of different people about how movies are flopping

05:10.120 --> 05:12.440
due to having a bad score on Rotten Tomatoes.

05:12.440 --> 05:14.660
The answer to this, of course, is to make a better movie.

05:14.660 --> 05:18.280
But Rotten Tomatoes itself has had its own share of controversies over the years.

05:18.280 --> 05:22.360
Back when Joker came out, people noticed that a 3 out of 5 rating for the film was given

05:22.360 --> 05:26.640
a Rotten Icon, but other movies around the same time, given the same rating, were given

05:26.640 --> 05:27.640
a Fresh Icon.

05:27.640 --> 05:31.840
The person who posted the reviews in question didn't know why it looked that way, and

05:31.840 --> 05:34.720
that it wasn't their fault, but the fault of Rotten Tomatoes.

05:34.720 --> 05:39.280
This led people to assume a subtle suppression attempt of Joker on Rotten Tomatoes, and because

05:39.280 --> 05:42.800
of the highly politicized nature of that movie, everyone lost their minds over it.

05:42.800 --> 05:47.160
The thing is, though, the article I'm showing on screen describing this story is around

05:47.160 --> 05:51.680
the middle in terms of length, and ends by saying, ultimately all of this information

05:51.680 --> 05:56.460
confirms that there is no conspiracy against Joker and Rotten Tomatoes doesn't have a bias.

05:56.460 --> 05:58.920
But the article doesn't actually prove that conclusion.

05:58.920 --> 06:03.220
No, really, I linked the article in the description, pause this video and go read it really quick.

06:03.220 --> 06:07.060
It points out other instances of this same discrepancy, but doesn't actually explain

06:07.060 --> 06:08.300
why it's happening.

06:08.300 --> 06:12.280
Additionally, when Captain Marvel came out, Rotten Tomatoes deleted thousands of audience

06:12.280 --> 06:16.220
reviews on release day, simultaneously claiming that the deletions were accidental and due

06:16.220 --> 06:21.420
to a bug in their service, while also claiming that the reviews were false and created by

06:21.420 --> 06:22.420
bots.

06:22.420 --> 06:25.820
I mean, if they really were bot reviews, there would be no need to claim that their deletion

06:25.820 --> 06:26.820
is a glitch.

06:26.820 --> 06:29.080
They would be doing their job properly in that case.

06:29.080 --> 06:32.000
Of course, it didn't matter to the score at the end of the day, Captain Marvel now

06:32.000 --> 06:36.020
has 100,000 audience reviews with a 45% approval rating.

06:36.020 --> 06:40.020
But I'm sure it mattered during that opening weekend rush, when a good chunk of the money

06:40.020 --> 06:41.340
on the movie is made.

06:41.340 --> 06:44.800
It doesn't matter if everybody knows the movie sucks nowadays, if you can hold off on publicizing

06:44.800 --> 06:48.040
that realization for just long enough for the studio to make their money, it'll be worth

06:48.040 --> 06:49.040
it.

06:49.040 --> 06:50.040
The same thing happened with Doctor Who.

06:50.040 --> 06:52.040
Frankly, in my opinion, Doctor Who is never good.

06:52.040 --> 06:54.500
Its best moments really only reach the height of mediocre.

06:54.500 --> 06:57.720
But their new stuff is a real dumpster fire, and fans have been letting their displeasure

06:57.720 --> 07:01.980
be known on Rotten Tomatoes, where they roundly rejected season 12 of the show, only to later

07:01.980 --> 07:04.440
discover that their reviews were being deleted by the site.

07:04.440 --> 07:07.780
And don't get me started on explicitly political documentaries.

07:07.780 --> 07:09.720
Mayor Pete seems to be a stinker.

07:09.720 --> 07:12.440
I Am Greta and Hillary are even worse.

07:12.440 --> 07:15.040
But probably the hardest ratio of all is for Fauci.

07:15.040 --> 07:16.400
Here's something that's real interesting.

07:16.400 --> 07:20.600
On most pages, you see a heading called What to Know, which includes an explanation of

07:20.600 --> 07:22.160
the critic's Tomatometer score.

07:22.160 --> 07:27.420
But only on the Fauci page is there an additional heading, explaining that 2% audience score.

07:27.420 --> 07:31.200
After Fauci's digital release, some viewers express their dissatisfaction with the subject

07:31.200 --> 07:33.660
matter by giving the documentary a Rotten rating.

07:33.660 --> 07:36.900
In other words, Rotten Tomatoes felt the need to add a disclaimer to explain that people

07:36.900 --> 07:40.340
are downloading the movie not based on the movie's quality, but because they don't

07:40.340 --> 07:41.340
like Fauci.

07:41.340 --> 07:42.340
And fair enough.

07:42.340 --> 07:45.500
But when the movie in question is a biopic, it's reasonable to expect those two topics

07:45.500 --> 07:46.500
to be linked.

07:46.500 --> 07:50.860
Of course, like I said in my Get Woke, Go Broke video, all of this still doesn't prove

07:50.860 --> 07:52.900
the existence of a hard and fast rule.

07:52.900 --> 07:56.900
The RBG biopic is still well liked by both critics and the audience.

07:56.900 --> 08:01.640
The Cowboy Bebop live-action remake was panned by both, while The Wheel of Time is loved

08:01.640 --> 08:02.640
by both.

08:02.640 --> 08:08.420
And yet, both shows are doing so poorly financially that journos are feeling inclined to try and

08:08.420 --> 08:10.520
spin their failures as positive.

08:10.520 --> 08:14.200
How far do you have to go down the Bezmenov subversive hole before you start to say such

08:14.200 --> 08:18.240
incredulous shit as, being rejected by the common person is a sign we're on the right

08:18.240 --> 08:19.240
track?

08:19.240 --> 08:20.240
Cope.

08:20.240 --> 08:21.240
Seethe.

08:21.240 --> 08:22.240
Unionize.

08:22.240 --> 08:27.940
Over the den of sexual abuse, Vice.com, titled Rotten Tomatoes Reviews are the Culture Wars

08:27.940 --> 08:32.300
New Battlefield, show that critics know exactly how all this looks, and that they have a need

08:32.300 --> 08:34.860
to maintain that facade of neutrality.

08:34.860 --> 08:37.820
Because if they're neutral and everything just so happens to be flowing their way from

08:37.820 --> 08:41.360
a neutral power structure, then they're obviously just objectively correct.

08:41.360 --> 08:45.300
And their opponents are all just right-wing review bombers who are mad about being phased

08:45.300 --> 08:47.340
out in the new modern cultural landscape.

08:47.340 --> 08:51.460
This article looks at Dave Chappelle's The Closer, 43% with critics and 96% with the

08:51.460 --> 08:54.880
audience by the way, and frames it as a part of the wider culture war.

08:54.880 --> 08:59.040
Over the past few years Rotten Tomatoes has attracted political actors, especially right-wing

08:59.040 --> 09:02.360
ones, to the site to review big pop culture events like Marvel movies.

09:02.360 --> 09:04.420
This is a part of a broader cottage industry.

09:04.420 --> 09:08.160
Weirdos on YouTube, for example, make dozens of videos about the box office numbers of

09:08.160 --> 09:11.660
Marvel movies with non-white, non-male leads in order to make a central point about how

09:11.660 --> 09:16.960
being woke, i.e. making movies starring people who aren't white men, leads to poor box

09:16.960 --> 09:18.080
office numbers.

09:18.080 --> 09:21.360
Of course, Vice would describe their political opposition like this.

09:21.360 --> 09:25.940
The term cottage industry is only partially true, but its use delegitimizes critics of

09:25.940 --> 09:30.360
broader cultural leftism specifically because those critics lack institutional backing.

09:30.360 --> 09:34.820
The description of woke as being about movies that don't star white men losing money is

09:34.820 --> 09:36.560
an obvious oversimplification.

09:36.560 --> 09:40.200
For example, the issue with the Star Wars sequels isn't that Rey is a woman, it's

09:40.200 --> 09:42.900
that Rey is a shitty character, playing out a shitty story.

09:42.900 --> 09:48.200
And the whole weirdos on YouTube remark is wallpapered over a deep insecurity and resentment

09:48.200 --> 09:52.720
that online print media has towards YouTubers nowadays as YouTubers replace them, just as

09:52.720 --> 09:57.360
online print media replaced TV, TV replaced radio, and radio replaced newspapers.

09:57.360 --> 09:59.520
This is a problem far larger than just Rotten Tomatoes.

09:59.520 --> 10:03.200
Remember back in 2020 when The Last of Us Part II dropped, one of the shittiest games

10:03.200 --> 10:07.400
released in the past decade or so, and it was shown on Metacritic to have a 95% reviewer

10:07.400 --> 10:11.140
score and a 3.3 out of 10 user score?

10:11.140 --> 10:14.980
Meanwhile, releasing around the same time was the remake of Spongebob Squarepants Battle

10:14.980 --> 10:18.740
for Bikini Bottom, an absolutely beloved game by fans of the original, where the critics

10:18.740 --> 10:21.940
score was 66% and the user score was 9.1 out of 10.

10:21.940 --> 10:25.140
I'll tell you straight away, I never liked the Spongebob game, and the remake wasn't

10:25.140 --> 10:27.900
very good, at least not for me, but that's because I didn't play the original game

10:27.900 --> 10:28.900
as a kid.

10:28.900 --> 10:30.020
There's no nostalgia for me there.

10:30.020 --> 10:33.900
And while nostalgia can cloud your judgement, that doesn't mean that the fun derived from

10:33.900 --> 10:35.940
nostalgia is somehow illegitimate.

10:35.940 --> 10:37.100
People just like what they like.

10:37.100 --> 10:41.060
And if that means the dirty, unwashed masters are going to massively upvote their mediocre

10:41.060 --> 10:44.340
Spongebob game because it was a formative part of their childhood, while rejecting The

10:44.340 --> 10:48.540
Last of Us Part II because it's absolutely fucking awful, who might argue?

10:48.540 --> 10:50.420
I do the exact same thing with Earthbound.

10:50.420 --> 10:53.620
That game's got loads of technical problems, but I love it because I played it when I was

10:53.620 --> 10:54.620
a kid.

10:54.620 --> 10:57.260
The difference is, I don't feel personally attacked when people say they don't like

10:57.260 --> 10:58.260
Earthbound.

10:58.260 --> 11:01.280
I don't feel like it's some huge assault on a grand political project I've been slowly

11:01.280 --> 11:04.820
building up behind the scenes, subverting institutions left and right in order to piece

11:04.820 --> 11:07.240
it all together, because I'm not a fucking commie.

11:07.240 --> 11:08.500
That is the reason they're doing it.

11:08.500 --> 11:12.980
The everything is political, quasi-fascist mentality pouring out of prog activism at

11:12.980 --> 11:15.300
breakneck pace nowadays is something to behold.

11:15.300 --> 11:17.380
That's the political goal of all of this stuff.

11:17.380 --> 11:20.020
Again, just like the last video, you've gotta read Gramsci.

11:20.020 --> 11:22.940
But there's also a distinct personal reason for it too.

11:22.940 --> 11:26.020
All of these aspiring professional critics on Rotten Tomatoes and elsewhere, and I say

11:26.020 --> 11:29.300
aspiring because there's no way in hell most of them are living off this shit, are

11:29.300 --> 11:34.460
the product of years of not being taken seriously by anybody besides film school dropouts and

11:34.460 --> 11:36.140
SJW indie developers.

11:36.140 --> 11:40.220
And they reek of desperation to be recognized, to be taken seriously.

11:40.220 --> 11:44.460
Everything screams adulthood to the stunted growth of a man-child than making everything

11:44.460 --> 11:45.460
political.

11:45.460 --> 11:48.460
Meanwhile, an actual adult knows that there's a time and place for politics, but there's

11:48.460 --> 11:50.460
also a time and place where you turn it off and relax.

11:50.460 --> 11:54.020
We're at the end of the video, and where this topic of conversation continues is far

11:54.020 --> 11:58.220
beyond the scope of Rotten Tomatoes, so we'll have to do a deep dive into it another time.

11:58.220 --> 12:01.880
But here's the basic idea, the split between critics and the common person is a symptom

12:01.880 --> 12:06.200
of a much larger problem, and that problem is best described as the general lack of trust

12:06.200 --> 12:07.660
in our institutions right now.

12:07.660 --> 12:11.540
Consider this, when you buy food at the store, how do you truly know that the food is what's

12:11.540 --> 12:12.540
advertised?

12:12.540 --> 12:14.720
Well, that first level trust will be established by yourself.

12:14.720 --> 12:17.600
If the sign says apple and you look at it and it looks like an apple, you're probably

12:17.600 --> 12:18.820
going to assume it's an apple.

12:18.820 --> 12:21.900
But for example, how do you know what the ingredients are in a box of crackers, or in

12:21.900 --> 12:22.900
a loaf of bread?

12:22.900 --> 12:26.020
Well, you can always check out the nutritional facts printed on the box, but how do you know

12:26.020 --> 12:27.060
those are accurate?

12:27.060 --> 12:30.820
The answer to that is that it's generally illegal for companies to falsify those sorts

12:30.820 --> 12:31.820
of things.

12:31.820 --> 12:35.260
But how do you truly know if the system is working properly for this specific box that

12:35.260 --> 12:36.260
you're holding?

12:36.260 --> 12:37.700
How do you know that there wasn't a mistake in the printing?

12:37.700 --> 12:40.260
How do you know that this company didn't pay off the government?

12:40.260 --> 12:42.740
How do you know the whole thing just isn't a huge sham?

12:42.740 --> 12:45.020
We can follow this logic down to its inevitable conclusion.

12:45.020 --> 12:48.900
You can only truly know what you yourself are currently personally experiencing.

12:48.900 --> 12:50.460
Not even what you experienced.

12:50.460 --> 12:52.420
Not even the past is really that safe.

12:52.420 --> 12:55.260
That might have been falsified, or maybe you misremember it, but the situation has changed

12:55.260 --> 12:56.260
since then.

12:56.260 --> 12:58.740
Who knows if your old childhood home or school still looks like that?

12:58.740 --> 13:02.820
This is the how do you know if Africa exists if you're not currently living there problem.

13:02.820 --> 13:06.820
We have many trustworthy accounts of Africa's existence, but there's still a very tiny probability

13:06.820 --> 13:08.220
that it's not real.

13:08.220 --> 13:10.800
Trust in social institutions works the same way.

13:10.800 --> 13:13.700
As an example, consider the current coronavirus situation right now.

13:13.700 --> 13:17.500
The governments of the world, in lockstep with the news and social media and Hollywood,

13:17.500 --> 13:22.260
are all pushing the vaccine extremely hard and stifling even good faith conversations

13:22.260 --> 13:23.260
about it.

13:23.260 --> 13:26.040
Even assuming that the vaccine is perfectly safe for everybody at all times.

13:26.040 --> 13:29.260
You shouldn't be surprised that there's a sizable minority of people who just don't

13:29.260 --> 13:32.500
want to get it, considering how people in power were completely willing to shred the

13:32.500 --> 13:35.400
social contract on live TV for the world to see.

13:35.400 --> 13:37.880
The issue isn't whether or not the vaccine works.

13:37.880 --> 13:41.780
The issue is whether or not you trust the various social institutions telling you that

13:41.780 --> 13:42.780
it works.

13:42.780 --> 13:47.040
And the way that those institutions have behaved during the pandemic have contributed to a

13:47.040 --> 13:50.340
widespread feeling that public trust has been breached.

13:50.340 --> 13:54.980
The commonplace mockery of stuff like experts weigh in, studies show, and so on, shows exactly

13:54.980 --> 13:55.980
what I mean.

13:55.980 --> 14:00.060
An expert in any field is not only required to have expert level knowledge on the topic

14:00.060 --> 14:03.980
at hand, but also needs to be considered trustworthy enough to be listened to by those

14:03.980 --> 14:07.500
people who don't have that knowledge, but would nonetheless benefit by listening to

14:07.500 --> 14:08.500
them.

14:08.500 --> 14:12.980
Trust is built up by, among other things, being consistently apolitical in their judgement,

14:12.980 --> 14:16.760
and showing political bias is one fast way to destroy that trust among the common people.

14:16.760 --> 14:19.020
And so, we have our current problems.

14:19.020 --> 14:23.260
From people seeing the heavy hand of COVID authoritarianism and rejecting all measures

14:23.260 --> 14:26.540
outright, regardless of whether or not they would actually work, all the way down to movie

14:26.540 --> 14:30.420
critics being biased on RottenTomatoes.com and facing a backlash from people who reject

14:30.420 --> 14:34.100
them out of principle, trust in our political, social, and cultural institutions is at an

14:34.100 --> 14:39.060
all time low, and the only way to fix that situation is to be as honest and truthful

14:39.060 --> 14:41.020
as you can in your own dealings.

14:41.020 --> 14:45.520
This is why I fully reject that boneheaded view on the right that thinks that non-leftists

14:45.520 --> 14:49.680
should be just as bad as leftists, but in the other direction, and that all institutions

14:49.680 --> 14:54.020
are inherently corrupt and always will be, that's just some paleo-libertarian cope frankly.

14:54.020 --> 14:57.940
Either view will create the exact same authoritarianism that we're currently facing, just with a

14:57.940 --> 15:00.060
right-wing coat of paint instead of a left-wing one.

15:00.060 --> 15:03.780
I'm sure that take will get me pushback from rightoids that watch me, but that's fine.

15:03.780 --> 15:08.060
The reason I always say in my videos what I genuinely believe to be the truth is because

15:08.060 --> 15:12.660
even though I'm not a journalist, I am part of an industry that is replacing journalism,

15:12.660 --> 15:16.320
and I would never want you to stop trusting me the way that we have stopped trusting them.

15:16.320 --> 15:20.740
The only way out of this nightmare situation is for us to be trustworthy in a way that

15:20.740 --> 15:22.740
Prague politics will not allow.

15:22.740 --> 15:27.060
In other words, truth, rather than pendulum swinging to the far right because the far

15:27.060 --> 15:30.380
left exists, is the greatest cure for socialist subversion.
