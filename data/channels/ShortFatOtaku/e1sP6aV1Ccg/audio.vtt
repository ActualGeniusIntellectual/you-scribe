WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:09.240
it's time for us to check back in on the valde school shooting situation and

00:09.240 --> 00:12.680
before we get going just know that there is no way this video gets monetized so

00:12.680 --> 00:15.800
please consider hitting up the channel subscribe star or memberships button or

00:15.800 --> 00:18.840
anything else you use to give us a float I first cover this event during a tub

00:18.840 --> 00:22.380
cast with Lilith right when it happened and back then we could only go by word

00:22.380 --> 00:26.060
of mouth on what happened but since then a full video of events has come out I

00:26.060 --> 00:29.400
won't show anything gruesome but I will use it to narrate so here's a quick

00:29.400 --> 00:34.000
recap on May 24th 2022 Salvador Ramos started his day by shooting his

00:34.000 --> 00:37.160
grandmother in the face severely wounding her she miraculously survived

00:37.160 --> 00:40.640
being released from the hospital on June 28th though she will likely never speak

00:40.640 --> 00:43.760
again the current theory is they got into a fight over her disappointment

00:43.760 --> 00:47.080
that he failed to graduate from high school after the fight Ramos drove to

00:47.080 --> 00:50.760
the school where he actually crashed his car into a ditch people from a nearby

00:50.760 --> 00:53.880
funeral home came out to assist but he began shooting at them causing them to

00:53.880 --> 00:58.160
run away and call the cops afterward Ramos leisurely walked into the school

00:58.160 --> 01:02.160
barricaded himself into a classroom and began executing students he was

01:02.160 --> 01:06.520
astonishingly given approximately an hour and a half to basically do whatever

01:06.520 --> 01:09.920
he wanted by the responding police because the ranking officer Pedro

01:09.920 --> 01:14.340
Arradondo misidentified the event as a hostage situation and not an active

01:14.340 --> 01:19.000
shooter in response the police called in tactical officers from the nearby border

01:19.000 --> 01:22.600
patrol unit which was 70 miles away cordoned off the school campus from the

01:22.600 --> 01:26.200
public took up a defensive posture and attempted to make contact with her most

01:26.200 --> 01:29.720
in order to negotiate all things that you should do during a hostage situation

01:29.720 --> 01:33.020
but also all things that you shouldn't do during an active shooter situation

01:33.020 --> 01:36.680
because all that does is give them more time time that Ramos used to do two

01:36.680 --> 01:41.040
sweeps of classroom one one one and one one two allowing him to shoot each

01:41.040 --> 01:45.120
person a second time to ensure that nobody survived and only one child did

01:45.120 --> 01:49.160
survive in the end incredulously this led to mistakes like the cops saying if

01:49.160 --> 01:52.920
you need help shout a student shouting help which alerted Ramos who then move

01:52.920 --> 01:56.760
between one one one and one one two through a shared back office killing her

01:56.760 --> 02:01.000
it would be a comedy of errors if it weren't so grotesque eventually it was

02:01.000 --> 02:04.560
the border patrol seen here in camo with helmets and heavier armor that took a

02:04.560 --> 02:07.880
janitor's key opened the door to the classroom and finally killed Ramos while

02:07.880 --> 02:10.840
the police under the command of Arradondo stood back and watched it's

02:10.840 --> 02:13.960
important to note at this point that Arradondo is the police chief of the

02:13.960 --> 02:17.680
uvalde consolidated independent school district and that the officers seen

02:17.680 --> 02:22.120
throughout most of the videos are ucisd officers they're not the police force of

02:22.120 --> 02:25.640
the city of uvalde but rather the school district's own security their

02:25.640 --> 02:28.960
jurisdiction is only the schools within the district at the time of the shooting

02:28.960 --> 02:32.520
Arradondo had six officers working under school boards started having their own

02:32.520 --> 02:36.840
police forces assigned directly to them in Texas after the 2018 Santa Fe

02:36.840 --> 02:40.080
shooting so since we've last talked about this there's been a number of very

02:40.080 --> 02:43.560
fishy developments the police responsible have been rapidly changing

02:43.560 --> 02:46.780
their public stance as new information keeps coming to light they've hired on a

02:46.780 --> 02:50.280
private law firm with the hopes to resist in court any release of police

02:50.280 --> 02:53.460
body cam footage or other private records arguing that the files could be

02:53.460 --> 02:58.280
highly embarrassing or evoke emotional or mental distress they've stopped

02:58.280 --> 03:01.800
cooperating with the state of Texas's own investigation into the shooting and

03:01.800 --> 03:05.560
how it was handled and of course this very ominous public statement that all

03:05.560 --> 03:08.960
victims were killed by Salvador Ramos and nobody else makes it sound like

03:08.960 --> 03:12.520
they're desperately trying to hide that their own officers fucked up however

03:12.520 --> 03:16.860
despite how popular that theory was in social media the school security camera

03:16.860 --> 03:20.700
footage seems to disprove that it shows officers hunkering down for a hostage

03:20.700 --> 03:24.420
situation it shows many mistakes most blatant of all how they're just standing

03:24.420 --> 03:28.620
around following Arradondo's orders even as they hear repeated waves of gunshots

03:28.620 --> 03:32.020
go off it even shows an officer sanitizing his hands you gotta stop that

03:32.020 --> 03:36.020
COVID spread but it doesn't show officers shooting children that being

03:36.020 --> 03:39.220
said how did this footage get out anyway after all you've all day is fighting

03:39.220 --> 03:42.980
tooth and nail against any investigative efforts even going so far as expelling

03:42.980 --> 03:46.500
journalists and parents from a city council meeting where testimony and

03:46.500 --> 03:50.460
security footage was being presented to city officials so why aren't wired you're

03:50.460 --> 03:54.140
allowing reporters to stay in the building to date it intimidated by who

03:54.140 --> 03:57.660
my reporters yeah so we have to leave the building is where you're saying

03:57.660 --> 04:02.060
because people are intimidated by us yes

04:02.460 --> 04:13.100
come in and protect our children are you a parent yeah yeah I can ask you why

04:13.100 --> 04:17.500
they would be intimidated by us I understand that but why would they be

04:17.500 --> 04:25.820
intimidated by us has someone complained to you sir about being intimidated yes

04:25.820 --> 04:29.980
like me actually had a lady that had a panic attack last week because reporters

04:29.980 --> 04:34.740
were in them yes she just freaked out well ultimately it was leaked by the

04:34.740 --> 04:39.460
Austin American statesman a news outlet local to Texas two days ago they

04:39.460 --> 04:42.820
published and edited a four-minute video which they released on their website and

04:42.820 --> 04:46.260
is fit for TV while they dumped onto their YouTube channel the full hour and

04:46.260 --> 04:50.020
a half including body cam footage school security cam footage and footage from

04:50.020 --> 04:52.860
the funeral home across the street here's the city's response to this leak

04:52.860 --> 04:56.100
from a recent city council meeting I'll say one thing since you brought up the

04:56.100 --> 04:59.980
video and then the press will address your questions after the meeting but I

04:59.980 --> 05:03.860
want to go on the record the way that video was released today is one of the

05:03.860 --> 05:08.500
most chicken things I've ever seen yes I've wanted the video released but all

05:08.500 --> 05:12.180
these news agencies knew that we were working with the with the House

05:12.180 --> 05:15.780
Committee they were gonna have a meeting Sunday to give a report to the

05:15.780 --> 05:19.740
family members Sunday morning and then Sunday afternoon at around two o'clock

05:19.740 --> 05:22.980
they were going to come back and answer the family's questions and show them the

05:22.980 --> 05:27.980
video every news agency knew that they were talking to the house the house went

05:27.980 --> 05:32.180
to the Austin American statesmen and KVU TV and told them this was going to

05:32.180 --> 05:36.180
happen and the response was well we all have a job to do there was no reason for

05:36.180 --> 05:39.500
those families to have to see all I've seen is the first little segment of four

05:39.500 --> 05:43.220
minutes but there's no reason for the families to have to see that I mean they

05:43.220 --> 05:46.020
were gonna see the video but they didn't need to see the gunman coming in and

05:46.020 --> 05:49.420
hear the gunshots they don't need to relive that they've been through enough

05:49.420 --> 05:53.580
and that was the most chicken way to put this video out today whether it was

05:53.580 --> 05:57.340
released by the DPS or who it was released for in my opinion was very

05:57.340 --> 06:01.460
unprofessional which this investigation has been in my opinion since day one

06:01.460 --> 06:04.900
this was the proper thing to do man you were dragging your heels it's a

06:04.900 --> 06:08.420
journalist's job to report on events as accurately as possible to uncover the

06:08.420 --> 06:11.300
truth even if it's politically uncomfortable and the response here

06:11.300 --> 06:14.460
just seems to be pure cope yeah okay the families don't need to see it again fair

06:14.460 --> 06:17.700
enough they can change the channel they can always not go to the website or to

06:17.700 --> 06:20.780
the YouTube video but the rest of the public deserves to have access to it it

06:20.780 --> 06:24.300
was chicken shit yeah to release that video the way you did it that part of

06:24.300 --> 06:28.820
that video was not supposed to be in what they're doing on Sunday that was

06:28.820 --> 06:32.980
not supposed to be there they did that for ratings and they did that for money

06:32.980 --> 06:37.260
and that's only reason they put that out there ratings and money I mean I don't

06:37.260 --> 06:40.380
even know if TV ratings matter anymore but what money how much YouTube revenue

06:40.380 --> 06:42.740
do you think a video of a school shooting is gonna generate I know I'm

06:42.740 --> 06:52.900
not getting anything we're gonna handle that Adam I'm not gonna get into an

06:52.900 --> 06:55.980
argument with you on that you know I haven't seen the video yet but I can

06:55.980 --> 06:58.940
tell you that one of the officers you've called they've got they got grace in

06:58.940 --> 07:02.540
that deal in that video he goes back down that hall three times trying to get

07:02.540 --> 07:07.940
in that room three different times three different times I know what

07:07.940 --> 07:12.740
everybody thinks and we need to let the investigation come through and yeah this

07:12.740 --> 07:16.060
is the best response just right to their face were the cops chicken shit and they

07:16.060 --> 07:20.420
just dodge it I think they know that heads need to roll here you can see for

07:20.420 --> 07:23.820
example the father of one of the victims who is also a police officer being held

07:23.820 --> 07:27.740
back by his fellow officers because they were ordered not to go in it could be

07:27.740 --> 07:30.500
cowardice it could be following the chain of command too strictly even though

07:30.500 --> 07:33.540
clearly on the ground it's a different situation but man this was a massive

07:33.540 --> 07:38.060
fuckup a transcript between the UCISD police and a Texas Department of Public

07:38.060 --> 07:41.860
Safety agent makes it sound like a chain of command problem the agent asked are

07:41.860 --> 07:44.780
there still kids in the classrooms if so they just need to go in the police

07:44.780 --> 07:48.740
reply that he got back was it's unknown at this time the agent reiterated y'all

07:48.740 --> 07:51.220
don't know if there's kids in there if there's kids in there we need to go in

07:51.220 --> 07:54.380
there and the police reply was again whoever is in charge will determine that

07:54.380 --> 07:58.160
the agent at this point exasperated took charge in evacuating parts of the school

07:58.160 --> 08:02.280
that the UCISD officers left alone saying that at least he could save those

08:02.280 --> 08:05.720
kids at this point the whole thing seems to be at least from the outside a

08:05.720 --> 08:09.360
product of chief Arradondo's massive mistake and since the shooting he's

08:09.360 --> 08:12.880
resigned from his position on the Yvalle City Council as well as been placed on

08:12.880 --> 08:15.520
administrative leave from his position within the Yvalle school district

08:15.520 --> 08:18.840
Arradondo meanwhile despite transcripts between the various parties clearly

08:18.840 --> 08:22.640
show him calling the shots has since denied he was the ranking officer on the

08:22.640 --> 08:26.360
scene Arradondo was the one trying all the janitors keys approximately 10

08:26.360 --> 08:30.480
pounds worth of keys in a massive ring on an unrelated door in an attempt to

08:30.480 --> 08:34.520
identify a master key that could unlock all the school's doors including 111 and

08:34.520 --> 08:38.480
112 while at the same time a short distance away the police had access to a

08:38.480 --> 08:42.720
halogen bar a device used by firefighters to open lock doors during a

08:42.720 --> 08:46.080
house fire keep in mind this was their primary jurisdiction their police for

08:46.080 --> 08:49.280
the school board why did they not have their own keys or know which keys went

08:49.280 --> 08:51.920
where why did they not have a plan for this sort of thing why did they

08:51.920 --> 08:55.760
mistakenly identify it as a hostage situation why did Arradondo ditch his

08:55.800 --> 08:59.480
radio right when the event began yeah that happened too people are out here

08:59.480 --> 09:01.880
saying that the cops killed kids accidentally and that's why it's being

09:01.880 --> 09:04.840
covered up but that always seemed a bit far-fetched and it also doesn't seem to

09:04.840 --> 09:08.520
be true at this point but frankly we don't need that to assign blame here the

09:08.520 --> 09:11.560
police were incompetent they were unprepared they assessed the situation

09:11.560 --> 09:15.200
wrong and nobody wanted to step up take ownership and be the leader of the

09:15.200 --> 09:18.760
situation when it was desperately needed and we can probably pin at least a good

09:18.760 --> 09:22.040
chunk of the blame on Arradondo in response people are calling for tighter

09:22.040 --> 09:25.400
gun controls and I'm just thinking you fucking serious yeah the shooter got his

09:25.440 --> 09:29.320
guns legally and fair enough but you want to concentrate all the legitimate

09:29.320 --> 09:32.560
usage of guns into the hands of the police when they're this incompetent I

09:32.560 --> 09:35.560
know not all cops but it's still a moronic idea if you want to put extra

09:35.560 --> 09:38.640
barriers in the path of young people to get guns that's an idea you can probably

09:38.640 --> 09:42.520
have some good faith compromise on they are underage but you don't want a world

09:42.520 --> 09:46.000
where all the responsible adults are disarmed and all the cops are too

09:46.000 --> 09:49.680
disorganized or worse too cowardly to do the job that they're supposed to do this

09:49.680 --> 09:53.080
whole thing is just a cluster fuck this was a massive fuck-up on behalf of

09:53.080 --> 09:55.920
Arradondo and it's looking like he's thankfully not gonna escape

09:55.920 --> 09:59.560
responsibility for it something that does happen far too often I have said

09:59.560 --> 10:05.280
from day one that every agency that was in that hallway has to be accountable

10:05.280 --> 10:10.160
for their actions that day everyone no one will be exempt that includes local

10:10.160 --> 10:16.360
school federal state everyone has to explain their actions that day everybody

10:16.360 --> 10:20.000
has to be accountable these are the kind of mistakes that you can't afford to

10:20.000 --> 10:24.080
make in this job if you want to know why all you need to do is look at the

10:24.080 --> 10:26.520
memorial
