0	9240	it's time for us to check back in on the valde school shooting situation and
9240	12680	before we get going just know that there is no way this video gets monetized so
12680	15800	please consider hitting up the channel subscribe star or memberships button or
15800	18840	anything else you use to give us a float I first cover this event during a tub
18840	22380	cast with Lilith right when it happened and back then we could only go by word
22380	26060	of mouth on what happened but since then a full video of events has come out I
26060	29400	won't show anything gruesome but I will use it to narrate so here's a quick
29400	34000	recap on May 24th 2022 Salvador Ramos started his day by shooting his
34000	37160	grandmother in the face severely wounding her she miraculously survived
37160	40640	being released from the hospital on June 28th though she will likely never speak
40640	43760	again the current theory is they got into a fight over her disappointment
43760	47080	that he failed to graduate from high school after the fight Ramos drove to
47080	50760	the school where he actually crashed his car into a ditch people from a nearby
50760	53880	funeral home came out to assist but he began shooting at them causing them to
53880	58160	run away and call the cops afterward Ramos leisurely walked into the school
58160	62160	barricaded himself into a classroom and began executing students he was
62160	66520	astonishingly given approximately an hour and a half to basically do whatever
66520	69920	he wanted by the responding police because the ranking officer Pedro
69920	74340	Arradondo misidentified the event as a hostage situation and not an active
74340	79000	shooter in response the police called in tactical officers from the nearby border
79000	82600	patrol unit which was 70 miles away cordoned off the school campus from the
82600	86200	public took up a defensive posture and attempted to make contact with her most
86200	89720	in order to negotiate all things that you should do during a hostage situation
89720	93020	but also all things that you shouldn't do during an active shooter situation
93020	96680	because all that does is give them more time time that Ramos used to do two
96680	101040	sweeps of classroom one one one and one one two allowing him to shoot each
101040	105120	person a second time to ensure that nobody survived and only one child did
105120	109160	survive in the end incredulously this led to mistakes like the cops saying if
109160	112920	you need help shout a student shouting help which alerted Ramos who then move
112920	116760	between one one one and one one two through a shared back office killing her
116760	121000	it would be a comedy of errors if it weren't so grotesque eventually it was
121000	124560	the border patrol seen here in camo with helmets and heavier armor that took a
124560	127880	janitor's key opened the door to the classroom and finally killed Ramos while
127880	130840	the police under the command of Arradondo stood back and watched it's
130840	133960	important to note at this point that Arradondo is the police chief of the
133960	137680	uvalde consolidated independent school district and that the officers seen
137680	142120	throughout most of the videos are ucisd officers they're not the police force of
142120	145640	the city of uvalde but rather the school district's own security their
145640	148960	jurisdiction is only the schools within the district at the time of the shooting
148960	152520	Arradondo had six officers working under school boards started having their own
152520	156840	police forces assigned directly to them in Texas after the 2018 Santa Fe
156840	160080	shooting so since we've last talked about this there's been a number of very
160080	163560	fishy developments the police responsible have been rapidly changing
163560	166780	their public stance as new information keeps coming to light they've hired on a
166780	170280	private law firm with the hopes to resist in court any release of police
170280	173460	body cam footage or other private records arguing that the files could be
173460	178280	highly embarrassing or evoke emotional or mental distress they've stopped
178280	181800	cooperating with the state of Texas's own investigation into the shooting and
181800	185560	how it was handled and of course this very ominous public statement that all
185560	188960	victims were killed by Salvador Ramos and nobody else makes it sound like
188960	192520	they're desperately trying to hide that their own officers fucked up however
192520	196860	despite how popular that theory was in social media the school security camera
196860	200700	footage seems to disprove that it shows officers hunkering down for a hostage
200700	204420	situation it shows many mistakes most blatant of all how they're just standing
204420	208620	around following Arradondo's orders even as they hear repeated waves of gunshots
208620	212020	go off it even shows an officer sanitizing his hands you gotta stop that
212020	216020	COVID spread but it doesn't show officers shooting children that being
216020	219220	said how did this footage get out anyway after all you've all day is fighting
219220	222980	tooth and nail against any investigative efforts even going so far as expelling
222980	226500	journalists and parents from a city council meeting where testimony and
226500	230460	security footage was being presented to city officials so why aren't wired you're
230460	234140	allowing reporters to stay in the building to date it intimidated by who
234140	237660	my reporters yeah so we have to leave the building is where you're saying
237660	242060	because people are intimidated by us yes
242460	253100	come in and protect our children are you a parent yeah yeah I can ask you why
253100	257500	they would be intimidated by us I understand that but why would they be
257500	265820	intimidated by us has someone complained to you sir about being intimidated yes
265820	269980	like me actually had a lady that had a panic attack last week because reporters
269980	274740	were in them yes she just freaked out well ultimately it was leaked by the
274740	279460	Austin American statesman a news outlet local to Texas two days ago they
279460	282820	published and edited a four-minute video which they released on their website and
282820	286260	is fit for TV while they dumped onto their YouTube channel the full hour and
286260	290020	a half including body cam footage school security cam footage and footage from
290020	292860	the funeral home across the street here's the city's response to this leak
292860	296100	from a recent city council meeting I'll say one thing since you brought up the
296100	299980	video and then the press will address your questions after the meeting but I
299980	303860	want to go on the record the way that video was released today is one of the
303860	308500	most chicken things I've ever seen yes I've wanted the video released but all
308500	312180	these news agencies knew that we were working with the with the House
312180	315780	Committee they were gonna have a meeting Sunday to give a report to the
315780	319740	family members Sunday morning and then Sunday afternoon at around two o'clock
319740	322980	they were going to come back and answer the family's questions and show them the
322980	327980	video every news agency knew that they were talking to the house the house went
327980	332180	to the Austin American statesmen and KVU TV and told them this was going to
332180	336180	happen and the response was well we all have a job to do there was no reason for
336180	339500	those families to have to see all I've seen is the first little segment of four
339500	343220	minutes but there's no reason for the families to have to see that I mean they
343220	346020	were gonna see the video but they didn't need to see the gunman coming in and
346020	349420	hear the gunshots they don't need to relive that they've been through enough
349420	353580	and that was the most chicken way to put this video out today whether it was
353580	357340	released by the DPS or who it was released for in my opinion was very
357340	361460	unprofessional which this investigation has been in my opinion since day one
361460	364900	this was the proper thing to do man you were dragging your heels it's a
364900	368420	journalist's job to report on events as accurately as possible to uncover the
368420	371300	truth even if it's politically uncomfortable and the response here
371300	374460	just seems to be pure cope yeah okay the families don't need to see it again fair
374460	377700	enough they can change the channel they can always not go to the website or to
377700	380780	the YouTube video but the rest of the public deserves to have access to it it
380780	384300	was chicken shit yeah to release that video the way you did it that part of
384300	388820	that video was not supposed to be in what they're doing on Sunday that was
388820	392980	not supposed to be there they did that for ratings and they did that for money
392980	397260	and that's only reason they put that out there ratings and money I mean I don't
397260	400380	even know if TV ratings matter anymore but what money how much YouTube revenue
400380	402740	do you think a video of a school shooting is gonna generate I know I'm
402740	412900	not getting anything we're gonna handle that Adam I'm not gonna get into an
412900	415980	argument with you on that you know I haven't seen the video yet but I can
415980	418940	tell you that one of the officers you've called they've got they got grace in
418940	422540	that deal in that video he goes back down that hall three times trying to get
422540	427940	in that room three different times three different times I know what
427940	432740	everybody thinks and we need to let the investigation come through and yeah this
432740	436060	is the best response just right to their face were the cops chicken shit and they
436060	440420	just dodge it I think they know that heads need to roll here you can see for
440420	443820	example the father of one of the victims who is also a police officer being held
443820	447740	back by his fellow officers because they were ordered not to go in it could be
447740	450500	cowardice it could be following the chain of command too strictly even though
450500	453540	clearly on the ground it's a different situation but man this was a massive
453540	458060	fuckup a transcript between the UCISD police and a Texas Department of Public
458060	461860	Safety agent makes it sound like a chain of command problem the agent asked are
461860	464780	there still kids in the classrooms if so they just need to go in the police
464780	468740	reply that he got back was it's unknown at this time the agent reiterated y'all
468740	471220	don't know if there's kids in there if there's kids in there we need to go in
471220	474380	there and the police reply was again whoever is in charge will determine that
474380	478160	the agent at this point exasperated took charge in evacuating parts of the school
478160	482280	that the UCISD officers left alone saying that at least he could save those
482280	485720	kids at this point the whole thing seems to be at least from the outside a
485720	489360	product of chief Arradondo's massive mistake and since the shooting he's
489360	492880	resigned from his position on the Yvalle City Council as well as been placed on
492880	495520	administrative leave from his position within the Yvalle school district
495520	498840	Arradondo meanwhile despite transcripts between the various parties clearly
498840	502640	show him calling the shots has since denied he was the ranking officer on the
502640	506360	scene Arradondo was the one trying all the janitors keys approximately 10
506360	510480	pounds worth of keys in a massive ring on an unrelated door in an attempt to
510480	514520	identify a master key that could unlock all the school's doors including 111 and
514520	518480	112 while at the same time a short distance away the police had access to a
518480	522720	halogen bar a device used by firefighters to open lock doors during a
522720	526080	house fire keep in mind this was their primary jurisdiction their police for
526080	529280	the school board why did they not have their own keys or know which keys went
529280	531920	where why did they not have a plan for this sort of thing why did they
531920	535760	mistakenly identify it as a hostage situation why did Arradondo ditch his
535800	539480	radio right when the event began yeah that happened too people are out here
539480	541880	saying that the cops killed kids accidentally and that's why it's being
541880	544840	covered up but that always seemed a bit far-fetched and it also doesn't seem to
544840	548520	be true at this point but frankly we don't need that to assign blame here the
548520	551560	police were incompetent they were unprepared they assessed the situation
551560	555200	wrong and nobody wanted to step up take ownership and be the leader of the
555200	558760	situation when it was desperately needed and we can probably pin at least a good
558760	562040	chunk of the blame on Arradondo in response people are calling for tighter
562040	565400	gun controls and I'm just thinking you fucking serious yeah the shooter got his
565440	569320	guns legally and fair enough but you want to concentrate all the legitimate
569320	572560	usage of guns into the hands of the police when they're this incompetent I
572560	575560	know not all cops but it's still a moronic idea if you want to put extra
575560	578640	barriers in the path of young people to get guns that's an idea you can probably
578640	582520	have some good faith compromise on they are underage but you don't want a world
582520	586000	where all the responsible adults are disarmed and all the cops are too
586000	589680	disorganized or worse too cowardly to do the job that they're supposed to do this
589680	593080	whole thing is just a cluster fuck this was a massive fuck-up on behalf of
593080	595920	Arradondo and it's looking like he's thankfully not gonna escape
595920	599560	responsibility for it something that does happen far too often I have said
599560	605280	from day one that every agency that was in that hallway has to be accountable
605280	610160	for their actions that day everyone no one will be exempt that includes local
610160	616360	school federal state everyone has to explain their actions that day everybody
616360	620000	has to be accountable these are the kind of mistakes that you can't afford to
620000	624080	make in this job if you want to know why all you need to do is look at the
624080	626520	memorial
