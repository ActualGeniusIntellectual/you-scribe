1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,240
it's time for us to check back in on the valde school shooting situation and

2
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:12,680
before we get going just know that there is no way this video gets monetized so

3
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:15,800
please consider hitting up the channel subscribe star or memberships button or

4
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:18,840
anything else you use to give us a float I first cover this event during a tub

5
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:22,380
cast with Lilith right when it happened and back then we could only go by word

6
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:26,060
of mouth on what happened but since then a full video of events has come out I

7
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:29,400
won't show anything gruesome but I will use it to narrate so here's a quick

8
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:34,000
recap on May 24th 2022 Salvador Ramos started his day by shooting his

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,160
grandmother in the face severely wounding her she miraculously survived

10
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:40,640
being released from the hospital on June 28th though she will likely never speak

11
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:43,760
again the current theory is they got into a fight over her disappointment

12
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:47,080
that he failed to graduate from high school after the fight Ramos drove to

13
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:50,760
the school where he actually crashed his car into a ditch people from a nearby

14
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:53,880
funeral home came out to assist but he began shooting at them causing them to

15
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:58,160
run away and call the cops afterward Ramos leisurely walked into the school

16
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:02,160
barricaded himself into a classroom and began executing students he was

17
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:06,520
astonishingly given approximately an hour and a half to basically do whatever

18
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:09,920
he wanted by the responding police because the ranking officer Pedro

19
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:14,340
Arradondo misidentified the event as a hostage situation and not an active

20
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:19,000
shooter in response the police called in tactical officers from the nearby border

21
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,600
patrol unit which was 70 miles away cordoned off the school campus from the

22
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:26,200
public took up a defensive posture and attempted to make contact with her most

23
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:29,720
in order to negotiate all things that you should do during a hostage situation

24
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:33,020
but also all things that you shouldn't do during an active shooter situation

25
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:36,680
because all that does is give them more time time that Ramos used to do two

26
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:41,040
sweeps of classroom one one one and one one two allowing him to shoot each

27
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:45,120
person a second time to ensure that nobody survived and only one child did

28
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:49,160
survive in the end incredulously this led to mistakes like the cops saying if

29
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:52,920
you need help shout a student shouting help which alerted Ramos who then move

30
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:56,760
between one one one and one one two through a shared back office killing her

31
00:01:56,760 --> 00:02:01,000
it would be a comedy of errors if it weren't so grotesque eventually it was

32
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,560
the border patrol seen here in camo with helmets and heavier armor that took a

33
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:07,880
janitor's key opened the door to the classroom and finally killed Ramos while

34
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:10,840
the police under the command of Arradondo stood back and watched it's

35
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:13,960
important to note at this point that Arradondo is the police chief of the

36
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:17,680
uvalde consolidated independent school district and that the officers seen

37
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:22,120
throughout most of the videos are ucisd officers they're not the police force of

38
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:25,640
the city of uvalde but rather the school district's own security their

39
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:28,960
jurisdiction is only the schools within the district at the time of the shooting

40
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:32,520
Arradondo had six officers working under school boards started having their own

41
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:36,840
police forces assigned directly to them in Texas after the 2018 Santa Fe

42
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:40,080
shooting so since we've last talked about this there's been a number of very

43
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:43,560
fishy developments the police responsible have been rapidly changing

44
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:46,780
their public stance as new information keeps coming to light they've hired on a

45
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:50,280
private law firm with the hopes to resist in court any release of police

46
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:53,460
body cam footage or other private records arguing that the files could be

47
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:58,280
highly embarrassing or evoke emotional or mental distress they've stopped

48
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:01,800
cooperating with the state of Texas's own investigation into the shooting and

49
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:05,560
how it was handled and of course this very ominous public statement that all

50
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:08,960
victims were killed by Salvador Ramos and nobody else makes it sound like

51
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:12,520
they're desperately trying to hide that their own officers fucked up however

52
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:16,860
despite how popular that theory was in social media the school security camera

53
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:20,700
footage seems to disprove that it shows officers hunkering down for a hostage

54
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:24,420
situation it shows many mistakes most blatant of all how they're just standing

55
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:28,620
around following Arradondo's orders even as they hear repeated waves of gunshots

56
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:32,020
go off it even shows an officer sanitizing his hands you gotta stop that

57
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:36,020
COVID spread but it doesn't show officers shooting children that being

58
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:39,220
said how did this footage get out anyway after all you've all day is fighting

59
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:42,980
tooth and nail against any investigative efforts even going so far as expelling

60
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:46,500
journalists and parents from a city council meeting where testimony and

61
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:50,460
security footage was being presented to city officials so why aren't wired you're

62
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:54,140
allowing reporters to stay in the building to date it intimidated by who

63
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:57,660
my reporters yeah so we have to leave the building is where you're saying

64
00:03:57,660 --> 00:04:02,060
because people are intimidated by us yes

65
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:13,100
come in and protect our children are you a parent yeah yeah I can ask you why

66
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:17,500
they would be intimidated by us I understand that but why would they be

67
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:25,820
intimidated by us has someone complained to you sir about being intimidated yes

68
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:29,980
like me actually had a lady that had a panic attack last week because reporters

69
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:34,740
were in them yes she just freaked out well ultimately it was leaked by the

70
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:39,460
Austin American statesman a news outlet local to Texas two days ago they

71
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:42,820
published and edited a four-minute video which they released on their website and

72
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:46,260
is fit for TV while they dumped onto their YouTube channel the full hour and

73
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:50,020
a half including body cam footage school security cam footage and footage from

74
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:52,860
the funeral home across the street here's the city's response to this leak

75
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:56,100
from a recent city council meeting I'll say one thing since you brought up the

76
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:59,980
video and then the press will address your questions after the meeting but I

77
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:03,860
want to go on the record the way that video was released today is one of the

78
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:08,500
most chicken things I've ever seen yes I've wanted the video released but all

79
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:12,180
these news agencies knew that we were working with the with the House

80
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:15,780
Committee they were gonna have a meeting Sunday to give a report to the

81
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:19,740
family members Sunday morning and then Sunday afternoon at around two o'clock

82
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:22,980
they were going to come back and answer the family's questions and show them the

83
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:27,980
video every news agency knew that they were talking to the house the house went

84
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:32,180
to the Austin American statesmen and KVU TV and told them this was going to

85
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:36,180
happen and the response was well we all have a job to do there was no reason for

86
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:39,500
those families to have to see all I've seen is the first little segment of four

87
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:43,220
minutes but there's no reason for the families to have to see that I mean they

88
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:46,020
were gonna see the video but they didn't need to see the gunman coming in and

89
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:49,420
hear the gunshots they don't need to relive that they've been through enough

90
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:53,580
and that was the most chicken way to put this video out today whether it was

91
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:57,340
released by the DPS or who it was released for in my opinion was very

92
00:05:57,340 --> 00:06:01,460
unprofessional which this investigation has been in my opinion since day one

93
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:04,900
this was the proper thing to do man you were dragging your heels it's a

94
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:08,420
journalist's job to report on events as accurately as possible to uncover the

95
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:11,300
truth even if it's politically uncomfortable and the response here

96
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:14,460
just seems to be pure cope yeah okay the families don't need to see it again fair

97
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:17,700
enough they can change the channel they can always not go to the website or to

98
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:20,780
the YouTube video but the rest of the public deserves to have access to it it

99
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:24,300
was chicken shit yeah to release that video the way you did it that part of

100
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:28,820
that video was not supposed to be in what they're doing on Sunday that was

101
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:32,980
not supposed to be there they did that for ratings and they did that for money

102
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:37,260
and that's only reason they put that out there ratings and money I mean I don't

103
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:40,380
even know if TV ratings matter anymore but what money how much YouTube revenue

104
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:42,740
do you think a video of a school shooting is gonna generate I know I'm

105
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:52,900
not getting anything we're gonna handle that Adam I'm not gonna get into an

106
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:55,980
argument with you on that you know I haven't seen the video yet but I can

107
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:58,940
tell you that one of the officers you've called they've got they got grace in

108
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:02,540
that deal in that video he goes back down that hall three times trying to get

109
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:07,940
in that room three different times three different times I know what

110
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:12,740
everybody thinks and we need to let the investigation come through and yeah this

111
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:16,060
is the best response just right to their face were the cops chicken shit and they

112
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:20,420
just dodge it I think they know that heads need to roll here you can see for

113
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:23,820
example the father of one of the victims who is also a police officer being held

114
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:27,740
back by his fellow officers because they were ordered not to go in it could be

115
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:30,500
cowardice it could be following the chain of command too strictly even though

116
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:33,540
clearly on the ground it's a different situation but man this was a massive

117
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:38,060
fuckup a transcript between the UCISD police and a Texas Department of Public

118
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:41,860
Safety agent makes it sound like a chain of command problem the agent asked are

119
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:44,780
there still kids in the classrooms if so they just need to go in the police

120
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:48,740
reply that he got back was it's unknown at this time the agent reiterated y'all

121
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:51,220
don't know if there's kids in there if there's kids in there we need to go in

122
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:54,380
there and the police reply was again whoever is in charge will determine that

123
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:58,160
the agent at this point exasperated took charge in evacuating parts of the school

124
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:02,280
that the UCISD officers left alone saying that at least he could save those

125
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:05,720
kids at this point the whole thing seems to be at least from the outside a

126
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:09,360
product of chief Arradondo's massive mistake and since the shooting he's

127
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:12,880
resigned from his position on the Yvalle City Council as well as been placed on

128
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:15,520
administrative leave from his position within the Yvalle school district

129
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:18,840
Arradondo meanwhile despite transcripts between the various parties clearly

130
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:22,640
show him calling the shots has since denied he was the ranking officer on the

131
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:26,360
scene Arradondo was the one trying all the janitors keys approximately 10

132
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:30,480
pounds worth of keys in a massive ring on an unrelated door in an attempt to

133
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:34,520
identify a master key that could unlock all the school's doors including 111 and

134
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:38,480
112 while at the same time a short distance away the police had access to a

135
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:42,720
halogen bar a device used by firefighters to open lock doors during a

136
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:46,080
house fire keep in mind this was their primary jurisdiction their police for

137
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:49,280
the school board why did they not have their own keys or know which keys went

138
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:51,920
where why did they not have a plan for this sort of thing why did they

139
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:55,760
mistakenly identify it as a hostage situation why did Arradondo ditch his

140
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:59,480
radio right when the event began yeah that happened too people are out here

141
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:01,880
saying that the cops killed kids accidentally and that's why it's being

142
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:04,840
covered up but that always seemed a bit far-fetched and it also doesn't seem to

143
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:08,520
be true at this point but frankly we don't need that to assign blame here the

144
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:11,560
police were incompetent they were unprepared they assessed the situation

145
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:15,200
wrong and nobody wanted to step up take ownership and be the leader of the

146
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:18,760
situation when it was desperately needed and we can probably pin at least a good

147
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:22,040
chunk of the blame on Arradondo in response people are calling for tighter

148
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:25,400
gun controls and I'm just thinking you fucking serious yeah the shooter got his

149
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:29,320
guns legally and fair enough but you want to concentrate all the legitimate

150
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:32,560
usage of guns into the hands of the police when they're this incompetent I

151
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:35,560
know not all cops but it's still a moronic idea if you want to put extra

152
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:38,640
barriers in the path of young people to get guns that's an idea you can probably

153
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:42,520
have some good faith compromise on they are underage but you don't want a world

154
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:46,000
where all the responsible adults are disarmed and all the cops are too

155
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,680
disorganized or worse too cowardly to do the job that they're supposed to do this

156
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:53,080
whole thing is just a cluster fuck this was a massive fuck-up on behalf of

157
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:55,920
Arradondo and it's looking like he's thankfully not gonna escape

158
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:59,560
responsibility for it something that does happen far too often I have said
