0	5040	This video is a treat for me more than anything else, after coming off the heels of the last one.
5040	9920	This is a Let's Player Drama video, guys. So if that kind of nonsense ain't your cup of tea,
9920	13520	click off now. Otherwise, let's go down this wild rabbit hole.
13520	26480	Intro
26480	30320	If you've been watching me for a while, you know exactly how I feel about old YouTubers
30320	34960	and Game Grumps and Egoraptor. We don't gotta rehash that again, so here's some quick context.
34960	39120	When JonTron and Egoraptor realized they needed an editor for Game Grumps, Jon suggested his
39120	44080	high school friend Barry. After Jon left the channel, Barry stayed on, though he also eventually
44080	48880	left. He was replaced by Kevin, who had applied for the editor job like a normal job, rather than
48880	53520	simply being somebody's friend from before. Kevin eventually moved on to pursue an editing career in
53520	57760	Hollywood, stating publicly that he was always more interested in the editing part of the job,
57760	62720	rather than the Let's Play part of the job. Kevin was replaced by Matt and Ryan of Supermega.
62720	66720	At this point, Supermega wasn't really a big channel. Their initial growth came off the back
66720	70720	of the Game Grumps Association. It was a pretty good deal for them. Egoraptor let them record
70720	76000	the Supermega episodes in the Game Grumps office and using Game Grumps equipment and game library,
76000	80800	as well as giving them a ton of cross-promotion. Once Supermega became popular in its own right,
80800	84960	Matt and Ryan quit the Game Grumps editor job and branched off to do their own thing.
84960	88880	These two guys are cut from the same cloth as everybody else in this sphere. Edgy as fuck back
88880	93280	during the mid-2010s, which made them appealing and helped them grow, but in 2023 they're hyper
93280	97440	progressive, shitting all over anybody who still likes edgy jokes and pulling up the ladder behind
97440	102320	them. A classic case of trolls remorse. For example, back during the 2020 Summer of Love,
102320	105840	while Egoraptor was waffling over whether or not he should talk about Black Lives Matter
105840	110160	with his platform because, well, he is a gaming channel, not a political one, while his fans
110160	114240	strung him up for it because everything is political, Supermega immediately jumped right
114240	119040	in to chant BLM along with everyone else. Anyway, we're here to talk about, specifically,
119040	123280	the Supermega sex pest allegation. Now, I've had my butt burn on topics
123280	126880	like this before. I was wrong about the ProJared thing a few years back. He ended up being
126880	130960	innocent. I was riding the hype train. It's always a bit cathartic to see a former edgy
130960	136080	boy turned progressive get hit with allegations, but he was ultimately innocent. I was wrong to
136080	139600	talk about it the way that I did. I even apologized to him, though I don't think he even knows who I
139600	144640	am. But the point is, after the ProJared story, I made the decision to not cover shit like this
144640	148880	until the hype died down. And, well, it's been a couple weeks. The hype has died down. I know
149760	153840	I don't cover stories fast enough, but I like catching everything in one pass if possible.
153840	158640	Also, real quick, I'm not going to go into super autistic detail responding to every single claim
158640	162880	made in the various videos and streams today. There's hours of stuff to sift through. I'm
162880	166640	just going to give you the overview of what went down. If you want somebody listening to and
166640	172400	reacting to every single sentence of this drama, Chedlogic is your guy. He's spent like 12 hours
172400	177120	on this shit. Okay, enough nonsense. Let's get going. There's an e-girl with a channel named
177120	183360	Lex Updog, who posted a two hour long video titled My Experience with Don Derr and Super
183360	187680	Mega. Jesus Christ, these allegations are getting longer and longer every single time, aren't they?
187680	192160	Remember back when Angry Joe got slapped with a sex pest allegation? Back then, these were like
192160	195520	twitlongers that took maybe 10 minutes to read throughout the most. Now we're sitting here
195520	199920	watching feature length films about the drama of young California progressives. And it's got that
199920	201840	Zoomer editing too. Like watch this bit.
230560	234320	Look at how jittery it is. She's clearly cutting everything down rather than,
234320	237520	you know, doing one solid take. Except that crying. Got to leave that in.
237520	239600	Okay, okay. Let's listen to the allegation.
260560	267120	Like attempting to physically force me to give him oral. And the only reason why it didn't work
267120	273760	was because I like physically like pushed him away multiple times. When you're in a long
273760	278480	distance relationship with someone, you have to get to know someone. Like I feel like I'm a pretty
278480	285840	direct person. And aside from what the situation has like turned me into, I guess, but I feel like
285840	290800	when this happened, I was like, especially this particular situation, I was like,
290800	296160	no, I don't want to. I don't want to do this. And he kept telling me like, just do it. And
296800	302560	like multiple times while he was trying to force my head down. And he's like way bigger than me.
302560	309840	I don't know. It was, I was really freaked out after that. So eventually he let me go. But I
309840	314960	just kind of shut down and just went with like whatever else he wanted that night. And like for
314960	320320	the rest of the trip, I didn't know what to do in that situation. So it sounds like Lex had an
320320	324960	online only relationship for several years with Don who's a German and the artist for the super
324960	329760	mega channel. They finally met up in real life at Matt's house as she was also friends with Matt and
329760	334080	Ryan, the super mega duo, and he was in America. Their first night together, she's claiming he
334080	338080	tried to force her to do oral. She's kind of ambiguous on whether or not he successfully
338080	341200	forced her to do it, but he was rough and did something that she didn't like and that sexual
341200	345680	assault. Okay. Understood. Before we get in too deep to the schizo ramble, here's what I think
345680	351040	the wider context and timeline is since this video is all over the place. Super mega is in LA. Lex
351040	355040	is in Nashville. Don's in Germany trying to come to the States full time to work for super mega.
355040	360160	In November of 2021, Don and Lex are both visiting the super mega house. And that's when the alleged
360160	364480	sexual assault took place. Despite this, they continue to associate and remain in a relationship
364480	369760	until May of 2022. At that point, the super mega guys, Matt and Ryan, along with Lex and Don attend
369760	374560	creator clash in Tampa, where they share an Airbnb. It's during this trip that Lex ends the
374560	378640	relationship with Don. Let's hear about Don's description of that night's events, because after
378640	382560	this went viral, he wrote up his side of their relationship on Twitter. I want to start this off
382560	387440	by apologizing to Lex for any trauma she may feel regarding our past relationship and to anyone just
387440	391280	finding out about this who feels they were being lied to or kept in the dark. In regards to what
391280	396000	happened during November 2021, this is my side as to what happened. Lex and I were invited over by
396000	400000	Matt to stay over at his place for a week. We had been intimate since day one, but on the third
400000	404560	night, I asked her for oral. She at first said no because she had a cold sore. Later, I asked her
404560	409120	again and she said yes, but to be careful not to be too rough. During the act, I had pushed down on
409120	414000	her head, after which she recoiled and told me I was being too rough. I then profusely apologized
414000	419200	and we ended up watching TV and going to bed after. I just kind of shut down and just went with
419200	423120	like whatever else he wanted that night. Things were normal for the rest of the week until the
423200	426800	trip was over and we went back home. During this time, I was under no impression that
426800	430720	anything traumatizing had occurred. However, I realize now this is extremely upsetting for her.
430720	435680	So to me, so far, calling this sexual assault isn't accurate. He clearly went too far,
435680	438720	but he stopped when she objected. He apologized and they were both good.
438720	442400	Anybody who's been in a relationship knows this is kind of common, where one person accidentally
442400	445680	does something the other person doesn't like. There's no intention to hurt anybody there.
445680	450240	They just stop and deal with it like adults. This is normal behavior. Awkward sexual experiences
450240	454080	aren't assault. They don't need to be policed or brought to light in public. They're simply a part
454080	459680	of having sex. Lex goes over what Dawn acted like after she informed him, making light of his
459680	465200	reaction, calling it performative. The way I told him was basically, I was basically like,
465200	471040	hey, do you remember November when we first hung out? And he was like, yeah. I basically
471040	477200	asked him questions that necessitated him saying yes or no to because I wanted it to be easy for
477200	482720	me and I wanted it to be easy for him because I didn't want it to take too long. I didn't think
482720	488240	it needed to for me to tell him the way I was going to tell him. So I said, um, you remember
488240	494640	the first night, um, when you were like pushing my head down and I was telling you no, yes,
494640	499600	he says basically, um, he like didn't dispute anything that I said. He was just saying yes.
499600	504720	And I was like, you know, that's sexual assault, right? Like you can't do that to people. Like
504720	509120	that wasn't cool that you did that to me. I I've been like, really like messed up that you did
509120	514560	that. I like have to like get better from this. This is something that I'm like having to recover
514560	520640	from because it's making me not well, like basically explained to him all, but like a baby
520640	525600	that sexual assault is bad. And that, that what he did was that, and that you can't do it because
525600	530960	all it takes, like all it would have taken is for me to have been like, no, I don't want to.
530960	537040	And for him to stop, but he didn't nonetheless. So I say all this and he says, so does that mean
537040	543920	you're breaking up with me? And I was like, what? Yeah. To me, it was like, yeah, no. And that out
543920	549520	of everything I said was both the shortest response I had to say, or like the shortest thing
549520	554480	I had to say to him. And the most devastating he we're on the sidewalk, like we're walking
554480	559440	and I'm like, yeah, yeah, no, I don't want to, no, I don't want to be with you. And he stops
559440	565760	directly under the streetlight and does this for like a minute in front of me. I don't know.
565760	570400	It felt super formative. Now remember all of these people are super progressive, super woke,
570400	575120	including Don. Imagine it from his point of view, if he genuinely believed in progressive values,
575120	579360	he's being told that his girlfriend is dumping him and that he unknowingly committed sexual assault
579360	584400	on her. This is how a person with those values would react. This is realistic to me. It's funny
584400	588720	that Lex assumes that Don's reaction is performative when even her miming it is more
588720	592800	convincing than any of her own reactions in her video. Let's go back to Don's statement.
592800	597120	Our relationship seemed to have not changed. We were talking on Discord almost daily and planning
597120	601200	future trips together. However, a couple of months later, we met during Creator Clash.
601200	605360	During the trip, me and Lex stayed together in an Airbnb and I noticed that she was growing
605360	609200	very distant towards me. I asked her about why she was distant and if everything was okay,
609200	612720	but I was not given a straight answer. On the final day, she finally told me why she was so
612720	617120	troubled. She told me I was too rough with her last time and it reminded her of her ex's behavior.
617120	620560	I tried to apologize and we talked a little bit after, but after the conversation had ended,
620560	624000	she had broken up with me and I left the Airbnb to stay with other friends.
624000	628240	At this time, I had contacted Matt and told him it had just gone down. Matt had offered to fly
628240	632640	me to LA to stay at his place to figure things out. At his house, I explained to him and Ryan
632640	635920	what had happened and the details about the November trip and what she had told me after
635920	639920	Creator Clash. After that, I stayed over at his place for the next couple of weeks. Later,
639920	643600	Matt told me that he had made some arrangements for his friends to sleep over at his place,
643600	647920	moving me to stay at their office. A couple of days at the office had passed when Matt called
647920	651920	me and said that Lex was on her way to the office. I was given no prior notice that she
651920	656240	was going to be there or moving to LA. It was at this time I decided to leave and stay with
656240	660320	other friends in the area. After a week, I had flown back to Germany. I was then contacted by
660320	664480	Supermega that they were not going to be using my art anymore. After that, they cut contact with me
664480	668400	and I have not heard from them since. Following this, I decided to send Lex another apology via
668400	672160	Discord, but I got no reply from her. At this time, I accepted that I was not going to hear
672160	676560	back from Lex or Supermega for the foreseeable future. See, this story sounds like Matt is
676560	680560	helping out his friend, putting Don up at the Supermega house until he has gone back to Germany.
680560	685280	But after Lex shows up in LA, suddenly he's cut off. To me, it sounds like Lex probably convinced
685280	688720	Supermega to cut Don loose, and once he was out of the States, they probably figured it was time
688720	694480	to sever ties. Lex all but confirms as much in her video. So there was a chunk of time,
694480	699200	I want to say around a week after I got there, that I just didn't do that much.
699200	706240	That and like mentally recovering from Creator Clash. And as that span of time occurred,
706240	713280	every time I'd look on my phone, I'd notice things were going on in LA. Like, why is Don in LA? I
713280	719280	thought he was going back to Germany. Turns out, Matt invited Don to stay with him after Creator
719280	724320	Clash, after he was done staying in Florida and I think maybe somewhere else. It occurs to me
724320	731840	that I'm going to need to talk to more people about the Don thing, what happened with him,
731840	736160	to give context to why I don't want to see him. Well, would you look at that,
736160	740320	Lex is bedridden back at home due to the trials and tribulations of her drama filled life. She
740320	743600	checks her phone and sees that Don went to LA to hang out with Supermega and she's thinking,
743600	747040	shit, I got to get to LA and talk to those guys. So they know not to hang out with him anymore.
747040	751120	This is unironically despicable behavior. As I said before, Supermega is run by progressives
751120	754800	and watched by progressives. So if I had to guess, there was some ruthless utilitarian
754800	758880	calculus involved here in the optics of keeping on an artist who is being accused of sexual assault,
758880	764240	regardless of the truth of the claims. This is the only claim with possible teeth in Lex's entire
764240	768880	two hour video, that initial sexual assault claim from the November 2021 visit to the Supermega
768880	773600	house. Every other thing she brings up just isn't relevant. It's like she has a vendetta against
773600	778720	Supermega and is using Don's behavior as a way to take them down. So she ropes in every single
778720	783680	other complaint she has and tries to make them look worse by attaching them to the sexual assault.
783680	787920	Here's some examples. Don wanted to stay in the States to keep working on Supermega. Everyone was
787920	791360	friends and they were all cool. So they suggested that he marry Lex to get a green card as an
791360	795280	option. Lex reacted in her video as if this was them selling her off or something.
808720	815600	to come live in the US. And it had been going on for a bit now. And that day, Don had been asking,
815600	822320	he had been talking about it with me. He had been asking Supermega about filing papers to get a
822320	829040	green card. And Matt, at least I know Matt, I'm sure Brian too, Supermega in general, had no
829040	836880	interest in doing that for him. But they never, up until this point, never told him no straight out.
836880	842400	Never was like, yeah, we're not doing that. They would just give reasons why it was really hard or
842400	850160	really expensive to do that. So once again, he asked Matt and him and I were walking up the
850160	855600	stairs to Matt's living room and Matt responded something along the lines of like, why don't you
855600	861760	guys just get married? To which Don seemed like reciprocal to the idea. Like this ain't the Middle
861760	866560	East lady. You can just say no. Lex leaked some discord messages from 2022 months after the
866560	870800	alleged forced blowjob. And Don is here saying I love you very much. And she's replying with I love
870800	875440	you too. This is completely normal relationship stuff. And Lex is trying to spin it like it's
875440	879920	evidence of him manipulating her. The story's unreal, man. Lex mentions that she was on the
879920	884160	Supermega podcast with Don where she was acting uncomfortable with his presence and then says,
884160	888560	go look it up if you want to see it yourself. If you've watched that or listened to that podcast,
889200	895760	there's a part in it where Don starts telling a story, context to do with me or something. There
895760	901280	was a sentence where he starts to say something from having known him on and off for like four
901280	908400	years. I knew that he was going to say something about us dating. And even though I had wanted that
908400	915600	before this trip in November of 2021, I'd asked him multiple times like, do you want to be public
915600	920000	about this? Because we had been before. So I just didn't think of it as a big deal. And he
920000	928320	didn't want to, would still draw me art, but only send it to me. So I got a really bad feeling when
928320	933680	he started to bring it up. Mind you, I hadn't processed what he had done yet at all, really,
933680	939840	besides the fact that I knew he did what I told him not to do. And it made me not feel good. So
939840	944000	if I knew he was about to announce or like not announce or like casually mentioned that we were
944000	948560	dating in a podcast, wouldn't I want him to mention that? Like, like, of course I would,
948560	956800	right? But instead I interrupt him. I, I interrupted him and I made him stop. And I,
956800	960880	I told him like, I just made a joke or something. I think I said like, I'm going to kill you.
961440	967120	If you are somebody that likes their podcast or have watched it before, give a shit,
967760	972800	you can go find it. There's a part where Don just stops talking. And with this context,
972880	977360	if you listen back to it, I think it makes sense. I remember being so anxious. I feel like I was
977360	981200	having like a mini panic attack or something. I did go look it up only to discover that the
981200	984640	podcast had been deleted from the super mega channel. Don't worry though. The internet
984640	988640	never forgets. Both of you guys have been staying with me at my, at my house for the,
988640	993040	for the last week or so, you know, why, why should we tell everyone?
994800	999920	Because I'm going to kill him. Is there a secret? Keep in mind guys, this conversation is after the
999920	1003360	sexual assault. Does this sound like she's traumatized and doesn't want him to be there?
1003360	1007280	Not to me. In fact, despite her earlier claim that he was being distant and manipulative,
1007280	1010960	it sounds like he wants the relationship to be public and she's the one cutting him off.
1010960	1014080	I don't know why an OnlyFans model might want to keep her relationship a secret though. That's
1014080	1018880	just beyond my understanding. Lex talks about a sexual experience she had when she was underage
1018880	1023440	with a 21 year old man, which doesn't excuse it. It sounds like she won at the time and how that
1023440	1029520	experience massively traumatized her. 10 years ago this year, I had actually called someone out
1029520	1034960	before. I did it a bit over a year after it happened because I also didn't process it,
1034960	1042160	but it was also with an ex-boyfriend. I was 17 and he was 21 and I also told him no the whole
1042160	1047120	time and he still kept going. So it felt like I was like reliving something I'd gone through before.
1047120	1051600	Lex draws parallels between the 21 year old's behavior and Don's. Although she never actually
1051600	1056320	outlines how Don's behavior is abusive, beyond that one awkward experience that Don apologized
1056320	1060880	for, she still ultimately calls him an abuser in her video. Lex talks about somebody in their
1060880	1064960	friend circle named Layton who apparently was doing something with Game Grumps in their merch.
1064960	1070240	I didn't feel comfortable so I called Layton first. I didn't know him nearly as long at all,
1070240	1077760	but I feel like he had gone through or has gone through enough that him and I both talked about
1077760	1082880	that I know he would relate when I told him or like understand and like believe me when I told
1082880	1086240	him. I don't know, I don't really care. It's entirely irrelevant. She probably brought him
1086240	1090880	up because he believed her story unquestioningly. Lex also talks about how after getting to the
1090880	1095440	Super Mega House in LA and Don is finally cast out of the friend group, she begins living there with
1095440	1100320	her friend Rev. They're both trying to get on their feet and find a place to live in LA and Matt and
1100320	1104960	Ryan are graciously putting them up until they can get their own apartment. Lex is ambiguous about how
1104960	1108800	long they stayed at the Super Mega House, but it seems to be quite a while as eventually the guys
1108800	1113120	simply offer to pay the first couple months rent on a new place just to get her out of there. But
1113120	1119840	listen to how she recontextualizes that gift. Matt offered to pay for me to live somewhere,
1119840	1125600	like down payment plus several months, which if you're in LA, if you know anything about the
1125600	1131680	housing market in LA is an exorbitant amount of money. Jim's asleep next to us, just me and him
1131760	1136320	in his living room and he says this. Most freaked out I think I've ever been by him, aside from the
1136320	1142800	phone call obviously. I immediately said no. At this point, I didn't fully distrust him. I just
1142800	1149200	had a gut feeling that no one gives you that amount of money for no reason without something
1149200	1155520	to gain from it. It felt like a bribe. That's at least like, I don't know, the way he was saying it,
1155520	1160560	that's at least like 10k. And like regardless of how much it means to him or not, I didn't want it.
1160560	1167520	I felt like weirded out that he did that. He was saying this so I could live alone in LA. Like
1167520	1175840	specifically apartment money for me to live alone. It was very weird. I turned him down and you know
1175840	1181520	we ended whatever conversation we were having and I went to sleep. That's right. Rather than taking
1181520	1186320	this as a clear sign she needs to move on, she considers it bribe money for covering up the
1186320	1190960	dawn sexual assault and views it as the super mega crew pushing her to be isolated in LA.
1190960	1195200	The rest of the video documents Lex's travels with Rev to Nevada to Washington State to
1195200	1198800	North California, all the while living for free at the super mega house for months,
1198800	1202560	and Matt and Ryan trying to politely push them into finding their own place to live.
1202560	1207680	Lex characterizes these excursions simultaneously as vacations and work trips because she would
1207680	1211680	shoot a few OnlyFans pics on the road, something that she complained she couldn't do at the super
1211680	1215200	mega house because it's a studio for let's plays not your e-thought stuff.
1215200	1218720	One of the things was that I noticed when we were gone is that we stopped to getting asked
1218720	1225040	as many questions. It was mostly just about where we were so they could know when we would be gone
1225040	1231360	or when we'd be back to be gone fast, right? So and when we were out I would take pictures
1231360	1237120	and those pictures ended up surprisingly popping off and making me the money I was making last
1237120	1244400	summer because I couldn't at the super mega plex do regular work. Like I can't set up a photo
1244400	1250160	photo set station for myself and like take photos and clothes that I wouldn't feel comfortable
1250160	1256400	wearing around the guys at the office for example. So me getting like a desk or making a workspace
1256400	1260960	just wasn't an option and I didn't know that until after I got there.
1260960	1264480	So she's driving around the west half of America going on trips, seeing her friends,
1264480	1268160	blowing money left and right, tons of frivolous spending by her own admission.
1268160	1276400	Me and Rav at this point had been going to meet realtors however many other days but we were
1276400	1281840	one we didn't have like most of our stuff to actually move in and two we were Ubering
1281840	1288000	everywhere so a lot of the money that could have went to actually securing a place to stay went to
1288000	1293920	getting an Uber to getting Ubers like hundreds of dollars in Ubers just living in LA.
1293920	1296240	Her stuff is apparently getting constantly stolen.
1296240	1302880	Um the day after this conversation takes place we get robbed. I have no photos of that because I
1302880	1308800	as soon as I woke up and saw the car was empty of stuff I just screamed as loud as possible called
1308800	1314320	the cops no reason they could not help and then just cried a bunch and then made a post about it
1314320	1320720	which apparently was laughed at um by the guys at the office. That day that I got robbed and I
1320720	1326320	post about it no one that I knew in LA messaged me. Her extremely expensive car is constantly
1326320	1331040	breaking down. Didn't even include in those fingers buying the car. I think we spent two
1331040	1334880	days on that trying to find the car and then buying it which I could have spent more time on
1334880	1340160	it because I ended up getting a car that needed a four thousand dollar repair when I got back to LA
1340160	1345520	so I suffered because of having to rush from knowing I was going to be asked instead of them
1345520	1351040	just either giving me a date to leave by or asking me like can you is do you know when you
1351040	1356560	can be gone by instead they would just say you guys on a vacation again and if she's so broke
1356560	1361760	so hard done by why did she buy a fucking jeep if you just need to be getting around LA why not buy
1361760	1367040	a little city car jeeps are expensive basically Lex seems to have tons of money and rather than
1367040	1371120	moving forward with trying to get on her own two feet in LA she's living at the super mega house
1371120	1376160	for free leeching off of her friends and living the high life when matt and ryan become a bit more
1376160	1380880	insistent that lex moved the fuck out of their office here's how she frames that situation when
1380880	1388640	we get back in town there's a group chat where essentially me rav matt and ryan are all going
1388640	1394880	back and forth and it's basically matt and ryan telling us all the things we did wrong that made
1394880	1401680	them not want us there anymore after both we got kind of kicked out like nicely kicked out and
1401680	1407440	robbed and not contacted by them after their next correspondence is like telling us we were dirty
1407440	1413760	we were dirty the people that would spend hours cleaning up the office from when guys would order
1413760	1418960	every single day often don't throw it away they had a person come by but it's only once a month so
1418960	1423680	you can imagine the mess that gets made between the time and it was getting blamed on us we're
1423680	1427360	still not even at the point where super mega is involved in the drama yet guys dawn's their
1427360	1430560	channel artist he's already been given the boot you think that would be the end of the drama as
1430560	1434720	far as super mega is concerned but here is how lex tries to rope them in it's just we're trying
1434720	1439360	to get our lives together and we've been nothing but generous to y'all during this time i think
1439360	1444320	the idea that there are grievances time and time again with our friendship when we've been helping
1444320	1451120	you whenever we can is confusing it's not a good feeling and overwhelming especially since this
1451120	1458240	year has been nothing but drama since the jump literally nothing to do with me at all or rav
1458240	1463760	i don't care no one's saying that to me no one's saying i know you've dealt with a lot like like
1463760	1468080	they're they're saying they're only bringing it up it's like we've dealt with you like rav was
1468080	1473200	even rav just was like congrats about the bad thing that is good now and when it gets brought
1473200	1478960	up for us it's about like we've been helping you time and time again and there's still grievances
1478960	1485200	time and time again it's only been one grievance it was always the same grievance it was the same
1485200	1490160	thing that no one listened to me for and when i tried to talk about it no one wants to talk about
1490160	1496960	it and now it's a problem and i'm homeless sitting in this creepy weird uh sex trafficking room
1496960	1502240	getting told that like we're annoying basically that like we have too many grievances i got
1502240	1507840	assaulted man could you guys just like care like why'd you switch up what happened to keeping them
1507840	1513120	accountable ryan like this year's been nothing but drama since the jump for you i don't think
1513120	1517840	they relate to anything bad that we've been through i don't have to see don anymore what he
1517840	1522080	did to me i don't have to think about when but when someone is treating me actively different
1522080	1530240	all the time in front of me my only friends in la that i was my only plan of like staying somewhere
1530240	1536000	my only like safe place didn't want to help me said they did nothing but helped me and then
1536000	1541840	gaslit me about it and made me homeless because like sure maybe saying made me homeless was like
1541840	1548240	is like maybe extreme but one how else would you say that two we could have talked literally all
1548240	1554320	we had to do was do this we tried doing it even after and they still didn't want to so how do you
1554320	1559920	get someone to talk to you when they refuse to you just can't you heard that right lex is pinning
1559920	1564000	everything on super mega because the initial assault that awkward sexual encounter with
1564000	1568400	don that apparently was tantamount to super rape that happened at matt's house during a party what
1568400	1571920	the fuck man what do you expect them to do they already fired him and now that they want you to
1571920	1575440	stop partying and spending all your money while living rent-free in their studio and they're
1575440	1579840	getting tired with the whole oh i lost my phone all my laptop got stolen stuff and they want you
1579840	1584800	gone you're blaming them and saying they're not taking the dawn assault story seriously enough
1584800	1588960	in fact the end of this tale is that lex had to move back home because she couldn't make it and
1588960	1594080	she blames that on matt and ryan i had so much stuff i couldn't fit it all in one trip to go
1594640	1602560	so i had to drop off some of it at a storage unit we moved to uh airbnb in hollywood in september
1602560	1609600	and september was the last month i stayed in la until i was finally able to get back home you know
1609600	1615680	what matt did before crater clash this year he texted me how's tennessee as if he's not the reason
1615680	1621040	i'm there and when i didn't respond he took me off his instagram close friends did not follow
1621040	1626000	me he just like didn't want me to see the stuff he really has to say that's right the reason lex's
1626000	1630880	big move to la failed is because the people she was mooching off of finally kicked her out okay
1630880	1635360	here's that tiny nugget in here that got super mega's audience to turn on them it's when lex
1635360	1639520	claims that matt's response to her alleged sexual assault at the hands of dawn was to say that he
1639520	1644080	didn't want this drama to destroy super mega when someone says like hey your friend assaulted me
1644080	1650960	that friend happens to be a co-worker can we like can i not see him and you say this job is my
1650960	1656560	magnum opus multiple times there's like you just like don't care about people you just like care
1656560	1661840	about yourself like you're like you just don't see people as like real things anymore and definitely
1661840	1665920	is like how i felt to him if true that's obviously pretty shitty to say that he's more worried about
1665920	1669440	these allegations tanking his channel than he is about the allegation that one of his friends
1669440	1674240	sexually assaulted another one of his friends and then lex alleges a second sexual assault
1674240	1682080	by a different guy and okay so my reference of jim is that this is a silly guy so when he like
1682080	1686960	sits down on the couch next to me and then lays down and stretches out i'm like he's just being
1686960	1693680	silly so i tell him the whole story i tell him everything that happened you know up until then
1693680	1698880	i'm pretty sure i even said about that um don was there at the office and all that and just
1698880	1705360	because he was he came to me asking why i looked upset a lot so of course that's all that's all
1705360	1711840	the reasons when he heard my story he was like man i'm so sorry and then proceed to like start
1711840	1717520	flirting with me like right after i and like this is when i realized because i was doing most of
1717520	1722240	talking that after i was done with the story and he started talking like he started saying flirty
1722240	1728880	things and like he started putting me in a headlock that i was like oh he's drunk and like
1728880	1733920	pretty much right after i realized that he started kissing me um if you've ever seen a picture of jim
1733920	1739920	he's a really tall guy i it was not even in my brain to be like get this guy off of me or like
1739920	1746080	not get this guy off me yes i didn't want to kiss him because to me this guy i am not that close
1746080	1751440	friends with like we are just from the same place and like i thought he wanted to like get to know
1751440	1757440	me better listens to my sexual assault story and then makes out with me like at this rate i'm just
1757440	1762480	kind of stun locked i had no idea what he's doing i don't know if there's even any other people in
1762480	1768000	the place i think there was two other people i think matt and rav were still there so he like
1768000	1773360	gets up at some point after like putting me in a choke hold a few more times and kissing he only
1773360	1777120	kissed me a couple times but he put me in a choke hold for a while and it was very uncomfortable
1777120	1782160	he like gets up and then goes to the office and he's like come here i don't even remember
1782160	1787600	thinking anything i was literally just like confused and he because when he said that he was
1787600	1794960	in the office but he was in the closet and when i came over to him because i was just fucking i was
1794960	1799520	like why the my in my head i'm thinking why is this guy just went to the office closet like the
1799520	1804080	office where like everybody has their computers and there's like a coat closet and you just go
1804080	1809280	in there and stand in the doorway and give me a kiss again like i didn't even have like a
1809280	1814400	reaction i just didn't know what the fuck that was and then after that i was like do you like
1814400	1819760	me or something because i genuinely just so like it came out of nowhere like i said i just told him
1819760	1826000	about being assaulted and he does this and his answer is i think you're cute is so fucking weird
1826000	1829520	okay okay he's drunk you didn't realize it he's putting the moves on you he kisses you you don't
1829520	1834480	want it i got it the issue is when he moves from the living room to the back room and then beckons
1834480	1838880	you over you know what he's thinking after the kiss you're not retarded if you weren't into it
1838880	1844160	why did you go over there with him at some point you can't blame other people for your actions
1844160	1849600	saying shit like my self-esteem was so poor i just do whatever the men around me want doesn't make it
1849600	1854640	their fault it is your responsibility to assert your own boundaries and manage your own weaknesses
1854640	1861520	like listen to her wording here he had essentially used me for nudes i had a not
1861520	1868640	safe for work patreon and he used to sub to it when we weren't dating anymore and so i kept like
1868640	1874080	a boundary with him over it because i was mad at him not necessarily mad at him but i you know he
1874080	1879280	was my ex i didn't want to talk to him and gradually he like pushed that boundary over
1879280	1886320	he like unsubbed from my patreon at one point when we were talking normally enough and he like
1886320	1894160	would message me and ask me if it would be okay if i would send him like the files from the patreon
1894160	1899120	and i would be like you mean like the old ones that you're subbed to and he was like no like new
1899120	1904720	ones or like all of them i didn't want to but my boundaries were so poor i said yeah anyway like
1904720	1909920	at this point we talked enough that i thought he liked me so i was trying not to assume poorly of
1909920	1915360	him uh because i just genuinely didn't think he would do that and then he did so he was like
1915360	1920480	letting me leak my own nudes to him he was letting me leak my own nudes to him like he has
1920480	1926240	control over whether or not you allow this no you did this he asked you you complied it might have
1926240	1930800	been shitty of him to ask that doesn't mean that he's at fault for your compliance lex ultimately
1930800	1937120	blames this on some new quasi-therapeutic bullshit called flight or fawn you know how there's fight
1937120	1943200	flight or fawn i think i did fawn i'm looking this up i don't want to fuck this up fawn people
1943200	1948560	pleaser lack of identity no boundaries overwhelmed codependent yep flight or fight we all know well
1948560	1952480	enough it refers to two psychological knee-jerk responses to a threat you run away or you fight
1952480	1958720	back well modern therapy speak has led to flight or fawn taking its place where people like lex
1958720	1962880	knee-jerk to either running away or cuddling up to their abusers in an attempt to minimize the
1962880	1967200	abuse there's probably some psychological basis for this but i'm willing to bet this became a
1967200	1971760	thing solely because some middle-aged hipster therapist wanted a way to tell her neurotic
1971760	1975760	sexually dysfunctional female clients that they're not at fault for any bad decisions they make in
1975760	1980560	their lives these people are not mature enough to engage in sexual activity i know they're legally
1980560	1985040	mature enough and physically sure but mentally lex seems to be about 12 years old you don't
1985040	1989520	innocently walk into a side room with a drunk guy after making out without any expectation
1989520	1993920	of what's going to happen next unless you're either extremely dishonest or extremely immature
1993920	1998480	every time she talks about an event it's never her fault a man must have mind fucked her and if she
1998480	2002080	agreed to do it it wasn't really her the tragedies of life just keep coming at her from all directions
2002080	2006080	like they do for all of us and you can't expect her to stop vacationing and stop mooching when her
2006080	2010880	dog died and her car breaks down or her phone gets stolen she genuinely sounds like a child i know
2010880	2015680	that victims of legitimate sexual assault or rape or abuse or whatever can often make bad decisions
2015680	2019760	in the moment that if they weren't emotionally compromised they wouldn't make but we're talking
2019760	2024800	about months and months and years of interactions where she just keeps coming back keeps doing the
2024800	2029200	same stuff and it doesn't square up with me that's not proof but my gut tells me this is all trumped
2029200	2032960	up i don't buy the whole oh it takes time to process the trauma thing in this case not with
2032960	2038560	that awkward dawn experience anyway i mean it is entirely possible that lex is just massively fucked
2038560	2042560	up from that sexual experience with a 21 year old when she was a teenager it's also entirely
2042560	2046880	possible she is throwing everything possible at the wall in order to tie super mega to the
2046880	2051280	awkward sexual experience she had with don that she has retroactively defined as a sexual assault
2051280	2056400	despite continuing the relationship with him for months as a way to cancel super mega as revenge
2056400	2061440	for her big career leap of moving to la failing because they wouldn't let her mooch off of them
2061440	2066240	anymore and kicked her free-loading ass out of the super mega house frankly it's probably both
2066240	2070000	everything in lex's video feels like a vindictive ex-girlfriend bringing up all the things that her
2070000	2073520	former boyfriend did that she didn't like and now that they've broken up it's time to air all the
2073520	2078160	dirty laundry and she's doing it under the cover of an assault or abuse allegation feels very jonah
2078160	2084240	hill all over again you know in lex's entire video the only thing that matters is did don actually
2084240	2089200	commit the assault everything else is just window dressing anyway yeah lex's attempt to make it to
2089200	2093920	the big city finally ends with her after returning from a seattle trip with rev staying at a hostel
2093920	2098480	in santa monica that she describes as sex trafficker giga rape central which she blames
2098480	2104240	super mega for as they won't let her stay with them anymore so after we go to seattle get robbed
2104240	2111360	in portland the stuff we get robbed of laptop ipad work clothes makeup toiletries i'm a model and an
2111360	2118080	artist those are all the things that i need to make money in the world so at that point priority
2118080	2123120	number one was no longer finding a place to live but rebuying those things so i can make the money
2123120	2129200	to get a place to live at this point we just had drove back into town and we had nowhere to stay
2129200	2135520	trying to save all of our money to rebuy our stuff asap so since i have a jeep we just sleep in the
2135520	2144160	car i go to santa monica malibu area in between there and just go park by the ocean um because
2144160	2152640	it's free the first place we stayed outside of the plex was like some rinky dink hotel in
2152640	2160560	pasadena it was like obviously like used for sex trafficking like it was a giant master bedroom
2160560	2166400	with a hot tub and and it had a corded phone with the cable cut she eventually has to go back to
2166400	2170320	nashville and she blames the power dynamics of super mega being a large youtube channel and
2170320	2174000	white males and all the rest of it as to why her career didn't take off and she couldn't hack it
2174000	2179440	in la the way these guys like do group chats is they all go in the office together and say and
2179440	2185920	like play football and like make a plan and like who's doing good cop bad cop ass shit very
2185920	2191520	manipulative but how else do you think they would have had jim message me with matt in there they
2191520	2196480	all work together why does matt need to be in there except for a power dynamic like they know
2196480	2201440	what they're doing here's the final spin that she pulls in the story i've been holding on to this
2201440	2207120	weight for over a year for no reason what loyalty do these people have to me that i need to be like
2207120	2211680	i need to protect them what did they do for me they let me stay at their place and then made me
2211680	2216480	feel weird about it after they were like hey your assaulter's gonna be here when i got there like
2216480	2221040	i don't know they make and then they word stuff like i have to feel like i owe them something
2221040	2225040	i don't owe them anything they weren't charging you rent they said i could stay there you know
2225040	2229520	if he didn't like me there he could have done a lot of different things he could just opened his
2229520	2235120	mouth and talked to me that's what adults do contrary to popular belief adults communicate
2235120	2241520	and uh are mature and don't just leave everything to text and their employees and act like that's
2241520	2248160	normal and gaslight people about it and gaslight people about like being upset about your reaction
2248160	2253760	to assault that's right dawn's a rapist super mega fired him not for her sake but to cover it up and
2253760	2257840	save their own skin and lex is the victim because she can no longer stay with them free of charge
2257920	2263760	but before she finishes up lex drops this fucking bombshell i don't think they relate to anything
2263760	2270640	bad that we've been through and the one thing they could which was rav's uh partner attempting to
2270640	2276560	like take themselves was daniel their friend daniel matt's like at least twice in front of me
2277360	2282880	separate times we'll hang out with him has called daniel a coward so no they don't care about
2282880	2288880	suicide they don't give a shit about suicide they only give a shit about themselves and who
2288880	2293760	they can make jokes of that are under them that they can get away with for those of you who don't
2293760	2298640	know daniel was the irl friend of matt and ryan the three of them were pals before youtube before
2298640	2303360	super mega they ran the youtube channel syndigo from 2012 until 2015 creating some really funny
2303360	2308320	videos the channel ended when daniel killed himself in 2015 unlike super mega which got
2308320	2312240	big due to the game grumps connection syndigo blew up because the three of them genuinely worked
2312240	2317280	well together and they consistently made good viral content it's not an exaggeration to say
2317280	2321280	that matt and ryan may never have recovered their careers after the loss of daniel without the
2321280	2326080	exposure of game grumps after daniel's suicide matt and ryan stopped updating the syndigo channel
2326080	2329760	after posting a video discussing what happened in a tribute to daniel and then went on to reboot
2329760	2334000	their youtube careers with the super mega channel i've seen long-time viewers of matt and ryan
2334000	2338240	remark that their humor on super mega is nowhere near as good as their humor on syndigo i'm
2338240	2342080	presuming partially because daniel was an integral component of their dynamic and partially because
2342080	2346960	daniel's suicide radically changed matt and ryan's personalities for lex to bring daniel up and make
2346960	2351440	the claim that matt actually didn't give a shit about him that is the ultimate low blow that is
2351440	2355840	the moment that it's confirmed she truly is a heartless bitch way earlier in the video in one
2355840	2360320	of lex's side stories i mentioned a guy named latin and his weird dealings with game grumps merch
2360320	2364880	well you know how a canceling event goes right when lex's story went viral everybody who ever
2364880	2368640	had a beef with super mega came out of the woodwork to pile on and one of them was latin
2368640	2374160	this living broccoli patch of a zoomer all right let's see what he's got to say i found super mega
2374160	2381280	in college i was three weeks older than matt i was so inspired by the stupid shit that these boys were
2381280	2390880	doing and i felt like i don't know like i was inspired my entire career got started in 2017
2391520	2400080	by h3 h3 and that all i've ever wanted to do is youtube make making content making clothing making
2400080	2405440	like drawing like producing videos doing content has been the only thing i've ever wanted to do
2406160	2413200	and super mega was the first channel that i fully interacted with in person that like
2414320	2418560	wanted to put me in things dude why are you fucking crying right off the bat you just started
2418560	2422320	the stream what the fuck man are you this week look at his chat room it's full of simps i had
2422320	2425840	to pull this from chud's video because latin's taking his vod down look at all the mouth
2425840	2430160	breathers they're just here to enjoy the spectacle of somebody getting ruined over drama that's it
2430160	2434000	as for latin himself it sounds like he really idolized super mega he really wanted to be a
2434000	2437840	youtuber himself and he considered working for them to be a real opportunity which is apparently
2437840	2442800	why he's crying so much latin's story is just as meandering as lex's where he relitigates every
2442800	2446240	single thing that ever went wrong in his life presumably as a way to garner sympathy from
2446240	2450800	the audience and make him seem less responsible for his actions a lot of it is gay kid bullied
2450800	2454400	in high school for being gay kind of stuff and fair enough that can be pretty rough but here's
2454400	2460320	the actual meat of his allegation also by the way you guys when matt and ryan fired me um they
2460320	2465200	offered me two months severance in exchange for a contract to never talk about them
2466880	2474480	and because i'm an artist and i live in la and i need fucking money i signed the goddamn contract
2475280	2483760	and it was like all right there i go like i just you guys now know in perpetuity that i can't say
2483760	2487520	it's the golden like it's it's called a non-disparagement it means that if you can't
2487520	2494160	say anything nice about them you can't say anything at all and i am so fucking terrified
2494160	2500640	that these guys are gonna sue me because i can't afford to legally represent myself and that's why
2500640	2505120	and that's why i've been so fucking scared to talk about these guys holy shit dude are you
2505120	2510480	actually admitting on stream that you're breaking your fucking nda with super mega they handed latin
2510480	2514400	a big sack of money with the understanding that he would not do exactly what he's doing right now
2514400	2519200	which makes him deleting his fucking stream make a lot more sense this guy's a super dumbass brother
2519200	2524240	like i'm trying to like pay rent like i'm not trying to like get in a fucking lawsuit i don't
2524240	2528560	want drama i don't want the drama well then what are you doing here bro latin makes the claim that
2528560	2532720	super mega made a joke about his lithium use on their podcast which is pretty fucking dumb to do
2532720	2537600	about your employee's mental illness on air yeah i hadn't really made my mental health a fucking
2537600	2542400	bang publicly and then i'm streaming one day and then matt uh it was someone in my chat just was
2542400	2547440	like hey matt said on the podcast that he's gonna take away your uh your fucking lithium i have
2547440	2553360	uh bipolar 2 or like something like that one's a lot and i played it off on stream you know but
2553360	2559120	like afterwards like it was fucking weird yep fair enough that's a weird joke to make especially if
2559120	2564000	latin's medical issues aren't public he's got a point there latin's next claim revolves around
2564000	2568240	him thinking that everyone at the workplace hates him anytime i would come into the office five days
2568240	2573840	a week uh pretty much here's how the operation would work if i come into a room where everybody's
2573840	2578400	in they're laughing they're joking if i join the conversation if i sit in and i listen
2578400	2585760	i'm fine but if i start talking and i actually involve myself either the group circles in closer
2585760	2592400	so i'm not in the actual physical circle um someone will talk over me until i shut up
2594400	2602160	someone will say a joke like you're gay uh or you know stuff like that uh because it's funny
2602160	2609440	because it's funny um but people would i would get downplayed or ignored or talked over or just
2611360	2616640	i was given this like petty treatment and then i'm sitting there thinking these guys clearly
2616640	2620880	fucking hate me because they're doing this to me every day and then i ask them if we're why
2620880	2624400	they hate me and if they have issues and they're like we're good with our issues we just need to
2624400	2629840	communicate more but yet they keep fucking doing this shit to me they kept literally these people
2629840	2633920	in front of me would like imagine like the people who you think are your best friends
2634480	2639440	now imagine all of them in front of you making plans to hang out with each other after work
2639440	2644320	all the fucking time and not at inviting you and it's not like i felt entitled like i had to be
2644320	2650560	involved but it literally felt like petty shit that they were making plans in front of me because
2650560	2656160	they know they all knew that they were my only friends at the time like around like my other
2656160	2660960	friends also do content and they're very very busy with their jobs so those guys i saw the most
2660960	2666000	so they would be making plans to go do shit after work in front of me and then not ask me if i
2666000	2674160	wanted to go and then i it happened so much that i truly feel like it was it was on purpose this
2674160	2678720	is just work drama and friend group drama at this point nobody's obligated to like you off the clock
2678720	2682640	are you still mentally back in high school dude you're acting like it well hold on he
2682640	2687760	did say he has anxiety and bpd and bipolar maybe he actually is i was telling these fuckers
2688640	2697360	constantly about my bp1 my bipolar 1 and bpd and my paranoia and how i literally feel like every
2697360	2703040	person in my fucking life hates me all the time but then latin recontextualizes a huge chunk of
2703040	2707760	lex's story from the previous part listen to this like lex and rav are the people that like
2708720	2713040	when you're hanging out with them they're always the ones contributing all the wheat they're the
2713040	2718640	ones that are ordering uber eats and then they pass you their phone and you're like no i'm not
2718640	2722560	really hungry i don't want to get anything like i can't afford it right now and then they're like
2722560	2726000	instantly they they look at you like you're fucking stupid for assuming that you have to pay
2726000	2730480	them back like they would just be like no like we're boys i got you yeah dude that's why they
2730480	2734400	didn't have the cash to stay in la they were blowing it all on weed and uber eats they're
2734560	2738960	literally the taylor the rens millennial $22 avocado toast can't afford a house meme
2738960	2742880	man the fucking gall to say that you're poor and you're homeless and it's other people's fault that
2742880	2746640	your big adventure of moving to la failed and you had to move back home when you're spending
2746640	2751520	all your money on takeout and weed latin then pulls the same dick punch move that lex did
2751520	2756000	bringing up daniel's suicide however he recontextualizes it to be about his own suicide
2756000	2761360	attempts they would make jokes about daniel like they would make jokes for like like i'm someone
2761440	2767440	where like i've attempted suicide i am a very depressed person because of my bipolar
2767440	2774880	i make jokes about killing myself all the time that is a true fact but i make jokes about myself
2774880	2780640	or things like that i'm not making jokes to hurt people or making jokes about people that have
2780640	2789520	hurt themselves but matt and ryan make jokes about daniel like like they make jokes about daniel
2789520	2793680	that's right latin makes it all about him and how uncomfortable them talking about daniel's
2793680	2797600	suicide made him i'm sorry bro you're just not mentally stable enough to be an internet
2797600	2802000	personality as simple as that regardless of the veracity of any of your claims or any good reasons
2802000	2805920	you have for being fucked up or whatever if you are so weak that you just crumple like this at
2805920	2810400	the slightest bit of pushback get off the camera dog part of that suicide conversation revolved
2810400	2814480	around how there was some kid who tried to kill himself and super mega had the opportunity to send
2814480	2818800	him some free merch sign it you know do a good deed the problem is this kid wasn't even a fan
2818800	2828240	of super mega his family knew that he loved youtube comedy but they couldn't confirm if he
2828240	2836800	was a fan of super mega that they just didn't know but they knew he liked youtube comedy
2836800	2842400	i i got the merch ordered for the kid without talking to the boys first but i come to them
2842400	2847920	they're both sitting in their desks um in this office and uh there were four desks
2849280	2854080	everyone had like matt and ryan are on opposite sides of the room and then across from that
2854080	2862400	you have my desk and justin's desk um and uh justin was there that day uh he was in the room
2862400	2870320	with us and so i thought nothing of the story like i didn't think it was gonna be a big deal
2870320	2876880	like i i asked matt and ryan to sign this book and i start telling them the story and they
2876880	2885600	instantly just like go the fuck off on these stupid fucking jokes being like like they they
2885600	2891280	had to go why are we doing this he's not a fan like how do we know he's a fan like it and i was
2891280	2898640	like it doesn't matter just give him the fucking book no it absolutely matters it's one thing if
2898960	2903120	some fan is suicidal and they love your shit and your videos help them get through the day and you
2903120	2906800	send them a goodie bag that's a good deed but if you're just sending your junk to random suicidal
2906800	2911360	kids that's not helping out the community that's shamelessly promoting yourself off of their
2911360	2915520	suicide attempt also this is just a personal theory that i have there's no proof of it but
2915520	2919520	latin mentions offhandedly that the kid in question is somebody that his mom knows back
2919520	2924800	in his hometown my mom instantly like you know she's like yes i can get latin to get some merch
2924800	2930080	get him a book like we have to help him was he just trying to score some free shit for somebody
2930080	2934240	using his connections it's possible but again there's no proof it just feels likely to me
2934240	2940000	personally next up are latin's complaints about workplace shenanigans i get hired i join the team
2940000	2947840	officially and then i'm walking down the hallway towards the kitchen and matt yells from the office
2947840	2955360	in the back room that he's going that he will that he might as well show me his dick and balls
2955360	2962880	because i'm gonna see it anyways so he goes hey latin and i turn around and sure like i didn't
2962880	2968160	you know what i mean like it's i just think it's a bit but i turn around but the dude's
2968160	2976000	dick and balls are out these guys in front of me decide and um our cinematographer tucker um
2976720	2983840	they decide that they want to compare their assholes to each other so one one at a time
2983840	2989120	matt and ryan decide to just pull their their pants down um right next to me while i just have
2989120	2995760	to be sitting there on camera uh and show they're they're literally like faces in each other's
2995760	3002560	assholes matt jackson like go out we get extra drunk we're having the time of our life like
3002560	3007600	yeah we're just in this bar we're getting blasted and then at one point i go to the bathroom
3008560	3015840	and i go into the stall and i close the door and i'm peeing and the next thing that i know
3016400	3024720	is that matt's now entered my stall that i'm in that i closed the door and his camera is like
3024720	3031360	put out in front so he's like front facing he's he's filming just my dick and balls he's filming
3031360	3035360	me pee okay you know what fair enough he's got a point your boss shouldn't be pulling out his
3035360	3039360	dick and balls and showing them to you at the office or showing his asshole to other guys in
3039360	3044160	the recording room or recording employees taking a piss at some point your youtube channel gets big
3044160	3047680	enough that it's not just heterosexual life partners fucking around anymore it's real
3047680	3051680	employment you can't be doing that shit layton then takes the opportunity to go into matt cheating
3051680	3056080	on his girlfriend which is shitty but it's got nothing to do with layton or the workplace nonsense
3056080	3064000	then last summer uh i was the only person that didn't know that matt was cheating on his
3064000	3071200	girlfriend that i was a i was close with like matt's matt's girlfriend was such a good person
3071200	3080240	to me and i i loved her i still do um but i didn't know that matt was cheating on his girlfriend with
3080240	3085440	a new girl that had just joined our friend group that his girlfriend was scared of and felt like
3085440	3094080	was uh an issue um all at this exact same time while matt's having his his little secret
3094080	3103280	relationship that i didn't know about there was a night that uh me matt and jim drank so much
3104080	3112480	and at the end of the night uh this this girl comes over and matt and her just like laying
3112480	3118240	on the floor really really close and it's like it felt like middle school flirting and it was icky
3119360	3126480	but like i wasn't seeing anything that was like to me that consisted as cheating but it wasn't
3126480	3131440	enough for me to feel like i could go to his ex and tell her at the time well his current
3131440	3135760	girlfriend at the time i couldn't text her and be like hey matt's doing something um plus i didn't
3135760	3141040	want to risk my fucking job you know he goes into being raped while he was underage yeah again
3141040	3149680	really bad but nothing to do with super mega i was raped by a youtuber he got me really fucking high
3149680	3156160	and then he raped me and he told me that i was his boyfriend now and that we were you know we
3156160	3160720	loved each other and that's what we would do now and the next morning his friends told me his
3160720	3165840	friends found out his friends told me i was so young and that they i didn't know what just
3165840	3169200	happened to me and i didn't believe them because i thought i was mature for my age because he
3169200	3173600	treated me like an adult and i was like no we're fine he then goes into another employee named
3173600	3178160	jim and how he gets all this special treatment but look at how he describes that jim could just
3178160	3184720	like be like oh no my friend had a bad morning so i i had to take him to lunch and take him out all
3184720	3191200	day and and i i just had to go baby my my little friend and then matt and ryan would just like be
3191200	3195840	like yeah sure yeah dude when jim has a friend that needs special care latin makes fun of him
3195840	3199680	for being childish but when latin or lex or any of their associates need special care they're
3199680	3204400	crying and screaming about how super mega doesn't care about them how dare you latin then goes into
3204400	3208720	the circumstances of him getting fired but oddly enough he doesn't actually go into why he got
3208720	3214320	fired matt and ryan were like hey dude we have to talk to you like when i when you get if you guys
3214320	3220880	remember when i drove to vegas i knew that whole drive that matt and ryan were gonna fire me on
3220880	3226960	monday monday comes around they tell me that they still have some things to talk about between the
3226960	3234880	two of them so they're gonna talk to me on tuesday tuesday comes they're not at the office again
3235520	3241360	and i'm really paranoid i'm terrified that i'm gonna lose my job and i'm gonna lose my insurance
3241920	3247120	and the insurance is all i needed super mega for obviously i need the money to pay my bills
3247120	3257760	but i need my medication and they on that second day like i ended up texting the two of them and
3257760	3265040	i asked them i was like can you guys just please like confirm to me if i have a job still or not
3265040	3275280	because like i need to start processing if i need to leave california uh and they they were like
3275280	3280240	sorry dude our hands are tied for your benefit they kept saying that they said it was for my
3280240	3286720	benefit so uh later that week it's basically i think it's like maybe wednesday then is the next
3286720	3293360	day they tell me to come in and uh i get there and i walk in the door and i just knew i was
3293360	3303760	about to lose my job so uh i was in and out in under i would say 20 minutes um they told me that
3303760	3311520	i was done uh i tried to explain to them some issues that i have with them but they instantly
3311520	3317920	shut me down and tried to explain to me that it's my fault um so i realized again that i was
3317920	3323120	ignorant for trying to explain to them why why they were wrong so i just let them talk
3324000	3330000	uh and then matt and ryan tell me that i have to sign a non-disparagement contract
3330560	3338720	if i want severance they basically bragged to me that they didn't have to give me severance
3338720	3345600	but they felt like they were so good to me like they like matt and ryan felt like they were
3346640	3352480	blessing a poor person by handing them money and they were but it was it's two months severance
3352480	3361600	like if like that's genuinely nothing like i'm sorry like like yeah like it's money obviously
3362160	3367120	but two months severance is so fucked up and it wasn't even like they told me we're gonna also
3367120	3371600	try to see if we can extend medical benefits or anything they just didn't care they're like all
3371600	3380640	right here's here's two months rent uh and uh you can never fucking talk about us so yeah latin
3380640	3385360	signed the nda he knew he couldn't do what he's doing now and decided to do it anyway no sympathy
3385360	3390000	for this retard anyway latin skimmed over a big part of why he got fired he set up a super mega
3390000	3394560	irl event without scheduling it and informing people properly and as a result a bunch of fans
3394560	3400000	were left on the hook when matt and ryan didn't know to show up he went into how ryan misgenders
3400000	3408240	his trans partner in private ryan mcgee openly misgenders a trans person in his life that he
3408240	3421040	cares very much about behind their back i can't tell you how many times i would hear ryan mcgee
3421040	3431760	say i'm gonna go home to my boyfriend or i'm gonna go fuck this guy matt would make the jokes too
3431760	3441200	this this partner is such a sweet person i didn't know them well i don't think they
3441200	3449520	ever liked me um so we just weren't ever close but it broke my fucking heart because i would
3449520	3456640	see this person and i knew they didn't know that the person that they like literally their fucking
3456640	3470000	partner is misgendering them all the fucking time and it sorry it literally like it makes me so
3470000	3478080	fucking mad to see just blatant transphobia come from those fuckers and then they turn around and
3478080	3483840	are like we are so accepting of things oh guess what that was actually fake latin had to walk it
3483840	3489040	back on twitter he then brings up ryan sexting fans and like at this point latin stream devolves
3489040	3496400	into character assassination i believe that super mega is a toxic business that represents
3499360	3505680	nothing good nothing positive and the foundation that that channel was built on is is fucking
3505680	3510400	wise he says nothing of relevance from here on out he's just rambling and repeating points and
3510400	3515200	occasionally crying and shilling his upcoming show i have a show that i'm working on that
3515200	3525920	i'm going to release soon called only bricks where i interview only fans models in weird situations
3525920	3532480	and i let them pick a fun lego set and i want to give these people who get so much hate online
3532480	3538160	because dumbass n-cells say they're hot girls that have no personality or they just say that
3538160	3542880	they're people that just rely on their looks i think that's such a dumb idea and i want to
3542880	3549280	give these people the opportunity to truly prove who they are and basically doing anything he can
3549280	3553360	to pad out the stream so the donations keep rolling in wait is there an ad
3556800	3563040	i'm sorry everyone i wish i could turn that off but really do i don't want to try to seem like
3563040	3568400	i'm trying to monetize anything you can literally shut off twitch ads in the dashboard dude the only
3568400	3573600	legitimate parts of latin story is that matt and ryan are still behaving like super mega is a frat
3573600	3578160	house full of their friends rather than them both being 30 years old running a real business it
3578160	3582320	sounds like there was some weird sexual harassment shit at the super mega house not exploitative or
3582320	3586640	pleasurable or anything like that just prank shit that went too far and is not appropriate in a
3586640	3590800	business setting they clearly need to grow up these aren't high school friends they're employees
3590800	3594880	but everything else latin talks about is irrelevant he's simply dragging everything
3594880	3599280	out for the camera in order to garner sympathy earn some money and get his next project off the
3599280	3604160	ground eventually matt and ryan from super mega responded to everything on the super mega channel
3604160	3608640	they each did their own vlog and have basically peaced out from the internet since in ryan's vlog
3608640	3613200	he immediately sells dawn up the river but does so by appealing to lex's victimhood on the night of
3613200	3620160	may 25th lex reached out to me through text they wanted to talk about something i said okay she
3620160	3627520	called i answered and she began to confide in me about a sexual assault that she experienced
3628240	3634640	by our mutual friend don who was our channel artist at the time i took these allegations
3634640	3639120	seriously and expressed my support for lex and i asked her permission to talk to don about the
3639120	3645440	sexual assault directly unfortunately my words ended up ringing hollow as matt and i continuously
3645440	3656640	tiptoed around the subject we didn't expect this from don um nobody uh expects their friend to do
3656640	3661360	something this serious to another friend even though lex's whole thing was entirely about
3661360	3665040	how super mega apparently fucked up her life by kicking her out and only a little bit about don
3665040	3668880	at the start ryan completely sides with lex because he's a progressive and believe all women
3668880	3673040	he throws don under the bus and then he throws himself under the bus we selfishly waited until
3673040	3678880	we felt comfortable to have this discussion with don instead of having the victims back immediately
3678880	3684560	there's no excusing the lack of tack that was used to handle this um lex should have felt safe and i
3684560	3692880	am sorry to lex for making them feel like they weren't hurt at that time i was spineless could
3692880	3698880	have been handled so much better and should have been handled so much better especially since
3699440	3705840	lex was the one who trusted us with her story and her trauma there's no excusing the way matt
3705840	3713920	and i handled that situation if we were to do it right we would have from the get-go fired
3713920	3718800	down immediately going so far as to imply that he's quitting super mega i have obviously been
3718800	3725280	irresponsible with the platform i was given so as it stands i don't deserve one since this is my
3725280	3730800	final video this next topic is really the only thing i care to defend myself on this entire vlog
3730800	3734880	comes across as like i said at the start a calculated utilitarian move in order to save
3734880	3738880	super mega from the wrath of their young progressive audience ryan then goes after
3738880	3743520	latent for daring to utter daniel's name in a stream to address these allegations head on about
3743520	3749120	me making fun of the suicide of my best friend i just want to state that it's just untrue the
3749120	3754240	person making these claims never knew daniel they definitely were not a part of the group that
3754240	3763040	experienced the trauma of losing him and i think honestly it is disrespectful to bring him up
3763760	3770560	as a weapon i felt like he was just brought into the situation for drama's sake to try to
3771360	3780880	hurt me or matt or hurt our image i have done enough shit to tarnish my image but i will not
3780880	3790240	stand by and let someone talk lies about the way i talked or treated my trauma in regards to daniel
3790240	3796160	the sole focus of all of this should have been about the support that lex needed you know how
3796160	3800880	it is right kneel for the woman take down the gay guy normal stuff in progville the truth is even if
3800880	3806000	we assume lex's sexual assault claim is true latin is clearly just dog piling it happens every single
3806000	3809760	time a big canceling attempt goes down people see their chance and jump on it madison's doing it
3809760	3813200	right now at alliance tech tips something i'll likely cover in a future video there's one last
3813200	3816800	thing to check out before we move over to matt's video which is about five times as long as ryan's
3816800	3823360	i had inappropriate communications with fans while in a long-term committed relationship while
3823360	3828880	technically these actions are between two consenting adults it truly is pathetic and
3828880	3833280	there's no excuse for it it's clear that instead of being responsible with the super mega brand i
3834000	3839520	abused my position and my power for selfish self-indulgence listen if you're a cute girl
3839520	3844800	i will 100 exploit my tiny youtube stardom to get into your pants you can absolutely get ahead
3844800	3848880	with me by sending me your nudes i will totally abuse my position i don't give a fuck okay let's
3848880	3853040	move on to matt's video he immediately tells the breakup story from his point of view where lex
3853040	3858400	dumped don and then he flew don out to la to be a good friend so on may 19 2022 after returning home
3858400	3863520	from creator clash i got a call from don uh in which he was crying saying that him and lex had
3863520	3868080	just broken up he told me he was essentially stuck in florida because he's from germany and he had no
3868080	3873200	money and didn't know what to do and at this time i didn't know any specifics of what had happened
3873200	3878960	with the breakup he mentioned to me that they had been distant and then ended up just breaking up
3878960	3885680	that was the extent of my knowledge on the split at the time feeling bad for don i uh offered to
3885680	3890880	get him a one-way plane ticket to la to come crash at my place until he could find a way to get back
3890880	3896640	to germany he took me up on the offer and on may 23rd he flew out to la when don arrived he cried
3896640	3901920	to me about how heartbroken he was and the whole time i was none the wiser on what had actually
3901920	3907280	taken place between him and lex and if i had known i would not have invited him out to la to stay
3907280	3911760	with me i would not have housed him i don't remember exactly but i think rav was the one who
3911760	3917840	told me initially uh on my balcony one night and he told me that don had sexually assaulted lex
3917840	3924720	this was something that i did not expect from don and uh truth be told i had a bit of a hard time
3924720	3931680	accepting it i soon asked don about this um and what he told me was he chalked it up to basically
3931680	3937520	a misunderstanding in the bedroom at this time i did not grasp how serious the situation was
3937520	3943120	and obviously he did not either listen to that dude matt is acting like it's a failing that he
3943120	3947200	didn't immediately believe lex without proof and he had questions on whether or not his friend was
3947200	3951840	capable of committing sexual assault when that's a completely normal impulse matt takes the same
3951840	3956480	stance that ryan does even though lex is trying to destroy super mega he's supporting her against
3956480	3961440	don matt even admits that he did bring up his business in the context of the don sexual assault
3961440	3965680	allegations and says that he shouldn't have done that i told lex that ryan and i fully supported
3965680	3970720	her that we believed her 100 and that we would be there for her to be honest i was terrified
3970720	3976080	of misstepping in this situation due to its sensitive nature and how close it was to home
3976080	3982800	i was not sure how to navigate it this was all new territory to me and i asked her a really stupid
3982800	3987200	question because of that i asked lex what she wanted me and ryan to do about the situation
3987200	3992480	which was an absolutely dumb ass thing to ask i meant it from a place of we want to help and we
3992480	3997200	will do whatever it is you want us to do to make the situation better i now see that obviously came
3997200	4002560	across as me putting the responsibility of the situation back on the victim and i feel terrible
4002640	4007280	about that my intention was to be helpful and i went about it very poorly in lex's statement
4007280	4014400	she said that i brought up technicalities over don's employment as well as me saying something
4014400	4019840	along the lines of how much it would suck for super mega if this got out and that super mega
4019840	4024240	was my magnum opus and i didn't want anything to ruin that over the course of the phone call we did
4024240	4029360	discuss don's role with super mega and while i don't recall making any of those specific comments
4029360	4034080	i do know i brought up our business and how don's actions might affect that that was completely
4034080	4039040	wrong of me to do i never should have brought up anything as trivial as that while lex was telling
4039040	4044000	me something very difficult i was kind of freaking out and i was thinking out loud it should not have
4044000	4049200	even been on my mind uh and that was selfish of me what i should have done was just listened
4049200	4054800	and offered support and not questioned anything yeah that is shit of him but look at this double
4054800	4059920	standard lex wants every irrational action explained by trauma or fight or flan or
4059920	4064560	whatever the fuck but matt makes one knee-jerk misstep and he should be destroyed yeah he
4064560	4069440	shouldn't have done it but isn't lex's entire story built on the idea that people do irrational
4069440	4073520	things in the heat of the moment and we should excuse them for it matt buddy just claim you
4073520	4077680	were sexually assaulted it apparently explains everything away the first half of matt's video
4077680	4081840	is just him recontextualizing all the various stories that lex gave about her interactions
4081840	4086400	with dom to paint dom as the villain and lex as the victim and he and ryan are so sorry about
4086400	4091840	their part in all of it then at the halfway point he says this i also want to address a very large
4091840	4098400	chunk of lex's video that was focused on her and rav's time living at our office aka the super
4098400	4102160	mega plex did that not sound a little passive aggressive to you like you can't come out and
4102160	4105760	shit on lex but he's like yeah bitch we all know you spent most of your video not even talking
4105760	4110640	about dom matt knows that the smear is in and he has to reply to it without throwing lex into the
4110640	4115040	bus since she's a victimized woman but also while still presenting his own case he does this by
4115040	4119840	wording it like there is miscommunication on all sides we're all just so busy etc etc when she was
4119840	4123360	saying it was clearly meant to live or there was a secret meaning behind these messages or something
4123360	4128960	then matt provides new receipts things that lex didn't show in her two-hour video where lex painted
4128960	4133280	their relationship post moving out of the super mega house and back to nashville as being very
4133280	4137200	bitter and that she was left homeless and stuck in hostels or whatever they were actually texting
4137200	4142720	back and forth and being very friendly all the way through the end of 2022 months after apparently
4142720	4147360	lex said she had stopped running with them i thought that after i apologized to her last july
4147360	4153920	things had smoothed out and i think you could see why i would think that uh but that communication
4153920	4160320	ceased around the time that we fired latin who is a close friend of hers and now it all comes
4160320	4166720	together doesn't it lex is just fine with everyone and everything until her friend latin gets fired
4166800	4172320	from super mega for his incompetence and only then did these allegations start coming out it seems to
4172320	4176960	me like lex and latin put together this quasi manifesto shitting on super mega and front-loaded
4176960	4181120	it with lex's reinterpretation of a relationship with don as sexual assault in order to make the
4181120	4185600	whole story easier to swallow in the whole whirlwind of lex trying to make everything stick
4185600	4191040	she brought up how matt fucked some porn star not only did he cheat on his girlfriend and broke up
4191040	4197440	with her and then she found out after because jim was living with the new girl uh while she's still
4197440	4202800	friends with jim like they're both friends with jim he also takes a break with the new girlfriend
4202800	4213600	he's with to uh basically solicit a sex worker girl um that he was into to come live in la and
4213600	4221200	move from like across the us before he decided that he wanted to go back to the girlfriend
4221200	4227040	that he was just with so if i were him i would probably be reevaluating my life as well the porn
4227040	4232000	star in question morgan or morgue pie on social media also came out with her own dumb fuck
4232000	4236240	allegations about how matt fucked her and ghosted her and how she expected a relationship and how
4236240	4240640	awful he is they're not really worth going over because she's just stupid the charge here is we
4240640	4244560	had sex and he didn't call me back which man in an age of tinder and hookups that doesn't really
4244560	4248880	land anymore let alone with somebody who does fucking porn in any case matt simply admitted it
4248880	4253440	he said it was a hookup between his real relationships and then provided texts showing
4253440	4258800	that this was the case and morgan knew it in august 2022 when i was single and in between
4258800	4264160	relationships i sexted with her for one night and ultimately slept with her for two nights in
4264160	4270080	september when she was visiting los angeles during our hookups i explicitly stated to morgan that
4270080	4275440	this was a hookup and that i had just gotten out of a relationship and i was not looking for
4275440	4280560	anything and this is something she acknowledged i actually brought this up uh more than once
4280560	4286640	after she left la to go back home i could tell that she had caught some feelings and i did not
4286640	4292480	want to lead her on so i began to kind of distance myself shortly after i also ended up working
4292480	4296800	through a rough patch and started dating my current girlfriend and i talked to morgan even
4296800	4302320	less after this we stopped communication i didn't feel like it was appropriate to you know be
4302320	4308720	talking to someone who the relationship i had was primarily sexual uh while i had a girlfriend we
4308720	4313520	pretty much lost all contact uh after i started dating my current girlfriend and i figured that
4313520	4320800	that was normal and that's kind of just what is the typical life cycle of a hookup i was very
4320800	4328400	surprised to hear what morgan had to say on stream considering last month in june we had
4328400	4335600	a very pleasant conversation uh where we tied up any loose ends and smoothed everything out
4335600	4339600	and i'm going to share that conversation morgan reached out to me on june 8th and said hey matt
4339600	4344080	hope you're doing well i said hey i've been doing okay been really busy and stressed but i'm pushing
4344080	4348560	through have you been she said oh man me too supremely stressed but i'm coming to la this
4348560	4352480	month and i'll be doing so much cool shit so i'm excited glad to hear you're pushing through
4352480	4356400	i said i'm just kind of exhausted with tor coming up and stuff but i'll be okay i've been doing
4356400	4360480	therapy a lot which has been super helpful and glad to hear you're doing cool shit she replies
4360480	4364320	with oh i'm so happy to hear therapy has been helping i've had mixed results with that great
4364320	4368960	when it actually works out she replies with yeah man i'm excited but yeah just thought i'd check
4368960	4372880	up on you because even though things got a little weird i'll always care about you dude hope you
4372880	4377840	have a great tour too i respond with i appreciate it and i'm sorry things got a little weird i'm not
4377840	4381840	very good at navigating stuff and when i got in a relationship shortly after i wasn't sure how
4381840	4386000	to not be awkward about it i care about you too and i don't feel weird at all about things or
4386000	4391360	about you she said yeah i kind of know what happened lol people talk but cool man i'm glad
4391360	4396720	things aren't weird i said same glad it's not weird i feel a lot better now lol she said me too
4396720	4402400	i hate loose ends and i said same they bother me so much lol and for clarity i never felt bad or
4402400	4406880	negative about you i just didn't know how to not be awkward after a hookup i'm not really a hookup
4406880	4412000	person especially since i'm in a relationship now sorry for my awkwardness glad we're all good
4412000	4416800	morgan replies with yeah i felt a bit sour about it tbh because i'm not really a hookup person
4416800	4421840	either loki caught me with some feels and i felt pretty used afterwards but shit happens and that's
4421840	4426320	on me so i don't harbor any ill will towards you i mean i didn't expect a relationship or anything
4426320	4431360	but yeah lol i responded with i feel ya and i'm sorry for acting in any way that made you feel
4431360	4435360	used that was never my intention and i'm just kind of awkward with this stuff i could tell
4435360	4438640	a little that you were catching feels and i didn't want to lead you on and hurt you
4438640	4442960	morgan said i really appreciate that i'm just a big baby and when i open myself up like that
4442960	4446880	to someone it's because i'm really into them contrary to what my profession may lead you to
4446880	4451040	think but i'm glad we could talk about this i appreciate you talking about this with me even
4451040	4455200	though you aren't obligated to at all i said of course i'm really glad we're talking about it too
4455200	4460480	because i didn't like feeling awkward or having a loose end and she said yeah same w i respond with
4460560	4465760	a cool sunglasses smiley face and that was the last time we talked so why did morgan jump on
4465760	4470080	this bandwagon well maybe because she was one of the first people involved in latin's new show
4470080	4476160	morgue pie is someone that i met and didn't need to like me you know like didn't have to
4477600	4487120	but especially after all this crazy shit she still was so sweet to me and like wanted to record with
4487120	4493600	me and like she liked the idea of my show and so i recorded this insane fucking episode
4494960	4502640	of only bricks with morgan and we didn't even get like fucking three percent done everything here
4502640	4507360	seems to revolve around latin lex and morgan are his friends helping him out with their femoid
4507360	4512640	tears but it really just seems like this is latin's campaign to ruin super mega and matt says as much
4512640	4518160	a former employee of super mega named latin stallard has made some very serious accusations
4518160	4523760	against me and ryan i did not plan on nor did i want to make a segment of this video based around
4523760	4529920	this but after everything latin has said about us publicly i feel that i have no choice but to
4529920	4536000	respond and give my side of the story and show receipts we fired latin from working at super mega
4536000	4542720	in march 2023 and since then he has led a vindictive campaign to cancel us to deplatform
4542720	4548080	us to ruin our image basically we were not happy with his performance he had been causing problems
4548080	4552400	uh with his mood swings and outbursts at the office as well as a general performance that
4552400	4557360	we didn't like we made the difficult decision to let him go even latin's claims that the workplace
4557360	4562000	was full of homophobic jokes that he just hated and felt alienated due to ends up being not true
4562000	4567600	as matt shows off many texts of latin being totally cool with it i find it a little ironic
4567600	4573920	that he complained about this considering for example in december we were recording a podcast
4573920	4580320	when he came in unannounced and showed us his cock and balls in late 20s uh chuck hey latin
4581200	4587760	hey whoa do you see his balls latin you want to come take a seat do you see his balls
4588720	4593520	okay hold on i don't think it's appropriate for the podcast matt then shows screenshots from a
4593520	4598400	dedicated super mega hate discord where they plan to help latin cancel super mega by using any
4598400	4602720	scandal they can get their hands on we just need a piece of gossip it's big enough that their sponsor
4602720	4606240	will want to drop super mega well what if he tried to spin something like they covered by
4606240	4611120	sexual assault would that do the deed and it worked at least initially super mega went into
4611120	4615680	a subscriber death spiral their community subret was an open revolt everyone was disavowing them
4615680	4620240	and latin's own bitterness finally won the day at least initially this is a way for latin and
4620240	4625040	lex and morgan to try and bolster their careers by destroying larger creators they used to associate
4625040	4630160	with it's that simple dude and it all works because in 2023 you can be as shitty of a person
4630160	4635200	you want and simply say trauma and it's all excused believe all women guys don't be a rape
4635200	4640640	apologist by asking questions rav was also trying to figure out what had gone down and at this point
4640640	4646400	i don't think any of us still were taking it as seriously as we should have been and that is
4646400	4652880	something that i sincerely regret because we did not take it as seriously right from the jump as
4652880	4658800	we should have instead we asked questions and tried to do some detective work and get to the
4658800	4663920	bottom of it no no matt no doing detective work is supporting the rape the worst part is that
4663920	4668480	don's career is completely in tatters i think he's innocent he's been completely ruined by this this
4668480	4672080	was clearly a group of people who want to direct super mega and they decided to destroy don in the
4672080	4677040	process because he was an easy tool to use after all don's a fat guy who would ever believe that
4677040	4681040	somebody as hot as lex would ever consent to dating him lex's current boyfriend is also a
4681040	4685360	fat socialist soy boy she just seems to have a type what happened with super mega listen nick
4685360	4690560	made a video about it but all you need to know is that they're bad go to their subreddit there's
4690560	4697760	plenty of information google super mega subreddit and go there now look at anything look at the
4697760	4706080	first post it's been trending all weekend it's funny how fast everyone turned on super mega
4706080	4712720	yeah and i think that goes to show right it's kind of self-fulfilling in a sense you know it
4712720	4717840	kind of makes both lex's and latin's claim they don't want drama and they just want to tell their
4717840	4722240	stories and empower other victims ring really fucking hollow when they're gloating at the
4722240	4727600	super mega subscriber count going below 1 million said socialist soy boy runs a small time crumbtuber
4727600	4731840	channel putting out the worst leftist garbage content imaginable in between tweeting about
4731840	4736080	how he totally met the super mega guys and they totally use slurs constantly even though matt
4736080	4741040	confirmed he doesn't really know this guy shortly after one of latin's best friends who is lex's
4741040	4748640	boyfriend uh tried to instigate drama on twitter by lying and saying that he has heard us say the
4748640	4755200	n-word multiple times in reality we've only met this individual a handful of times and it's mostly
4755200	4763120	been at social events and always accompanied by lex so to think that we would just casually be
4763120	4769760	dropping the n-word with a hard r in front of not only someone who's a stranger but also a woman of
4769760	4775360	color yeah that makes a lot of sense this entire group of people are just leeches they've only
4775360	4780400	temporarily bound themselves together in order to take down super mega in fact latin shit talked
4780400	4785120	lex behind her back when she was squatting at the super mega house when these texts came out
4785120	4789760	i wonder if lex felt like a fucking retard burning all of her credibility to prop this little shit up
4789760	4793680	in any case latin wasn't doing anything in the name of accountability he just wanted to hurt
4793680	4802960	super mega i just hope you all believe that like this is not a push for me to try to get clout
4803760	4809440	i'm fucking terrified right now i don't buy that he's terrified for one second this is latin's
4809520	4813280	ticket to internet fame being the guy who got super mega cancelled and then plugging his new
4813280	4818080	show of course it was his plan all along morgan's part of latin's plan was ultimately insignificant
4818080	4822480	she simply served to be another source of matt looking bad after all matt and morgan were on good
4822480	4827040	terms right up until she started talking to latin following when i had that text conversation with
4827040	4832560	morgan and june where we smooth things over morgan began hanging out with our ex-employee
4832560	4837520	latin more and i have not heard from her since that conversation until i saw her stream lex's
4837520	4842640	story however was the core of their plans her claim was the catalyst for everything not because
4842640	4846640	she was actually a victim of dawn i don't buy that for a second they simply pre-faced the whole
4846640	4851600	canceling event with the dawn story to make it seem more legitimate lex's actual grievance is
4851600	4856640	she feels slighted because her next big career move was moving out to la making connections in
4856640	4860800	the creator space and trying to get something going that way that failed because she mooched
4860800	4866000	off super mega for months and everyone got tired of her being around as time went on and weeks
4866000	4872240	turned into months of them staying at the office we were unsure of their plans and how motivated
4872240	4877840	they were to actually find a place to move into there's simply no reason to believe this failed
4877840	4883360	me too attempt of dawn in my opinion dawn's the victim his careers and tatters he's lost all of
4883360	4888080	his connections there's no proof of anything and it's all real believable because lex is a pretty
4888080	4893600	woman and don is an unattractive guy the post me too era that we're currently living in in 2023
4893600	4899200	is fucking disgusting furthermore because lex self-id's as a she they non-binary trans person
4899200	4903760	she's not a woman and therefore under the laws of me too i am no longer obligated to believe her
4903760	4909440	see you later bitch anything and everything was on the table no matter what your race
4910000	4916320	or your identity or your your no matter what like you could be made fun of by those guys
4916320	4923200	someone who had been with latin and a group of his friends uh told us that he had been flaunting
4923200	4928880	that if things ever went south with us he could just easily cancel us he not only propagated
4928880	4933600	a lot of the jokes that he claimed to be offended by but he participated in the jokes he even
4933600	4938160	encouraged them we always wanted latin to feel comfortable even when we were making jokes we
4938160	4943600	never wanted him to feel targeted with any jokes his tone changed completely uh the moment he was
4943600	4948960	fired i felt so fucking weak i don't know i'm a i'm a big boy or whatever but like when i got when
4948960	4955680	i was like oh i'm non-binary i just woke up and i was like i'm bored i i'm she they now and uh
4955680	4960800	and i'm sure that works and then you got a ton more friends you got the crowds you got the eyes
4960800	4965760	on you everybody's like wow that's so cool yeah it felt like a lie to me
