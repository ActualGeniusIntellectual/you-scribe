WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:05.040
This video is a treat for me more than anything else, after coming off the heels of the last one.

00:05.040 --> 00:09.920
This is a Let's Player Drama video, guys. So if that kind of nonsense ain't your cup of tea,

00:09.920 --> 00:13.520
click off now. Otherwise, let's go down this wild rabbit hole.

00:13.520 --> 00:26.480
Intro

00:26.480 --> 00:30.320
If you've been watching me for a while, you know exactly how I feel about old YouTubers

00:30.320 --> 00:34.960
and Game Grumps and Egoraptor. We don't gotta rehash that again, so here's some quick context.

00:34.960 --> 00:39.120
When JonTron and Egoraptor realized they needed an editor for Game Grumps, Jon suggested his

00:39.120 --> 00:44.080
high school friend Barry. After Jon left the channel, Barry stayed on, though he also eventually

00:44.080 --> 00:48.880
left. He was replaced by Kevin, who had applied for the editor job like a normal job, rather than

00:48.880 --> 00:53.520
simply being somebody's friend from before. Kevin eventually moved on to pursue an editing career in

00:53.520 --> 00:57.760
Hollywood, stating publicly that he was always more interested in the editing part of the job,

00:57.760 --> 01:02.720
rather than the Let's Play part of the job. Kevin was replaced by Matt and Ryan of Supermega.

01:02.720 --> 01:06.720
At this point, Supermega wasn't really a big channel. Their initial growth came off the back

01:06.720 --> 01:10.720
of the Game Grumps Association. It was a pretty good deal for them. Egoraptor let them record

01:10.720 --> 01:16.000
the Supermega episodes in the Game Grumps office and using Game Grumps equipment and game library,

01:16.000 --> 01:20.800
as well as giving them a ton of cross-promotion. Once Supermega became popular in its own right,

01:20.800 --> 01:24.960
Matt and Ryan quit the Game Grumps editor job and branched off to do their own thing.

01:24.960 --> 01:28.880
These two guys are cut from the same cloth as everybody else in this sphere. Edgy as fuck back

01:28.880 --> 01:33.280
during the mid-2010s, which made them appealing and helped them grow, but in 2023 they're hyper

01:33.280 --> 01:37.440
progressive, shitting all over anybody who still likes edgy jokes and pulling up the ladder behind

01:37.440 --> 01:42.320
them. A classic case of trolls remorse. For example, back during the 2020 Summer of Love,

01:42.320 --> 01:45.840
while Egoraptor was waffling over whether or not he should talk about Black Lives Matter

01:45.840 --> 01:50.160
with his platform because, well, he is a gaming channel, not a political one, while his fans

01:50.160 --> 01:54.240
strung him up for it because everything is political, Supermega immediately jumped right

01:54.240 --> 01:59.040
in to chant BLM along with everyone else. Anyway, we're here to talk about, specifically,

01:59.040 --> 02:03.280
the Supermega sex pest allegation. Now, I've had my butt burn on topics

02:03.280 --> 02:06.880
like this before. I was wrong about the ProJared thing a few years back. He ended up being

02:06.880 --> 02:10.960
innocent. I was riding the hype train. It's always a bit cathartic to see a former edgy

02:10.960 --> 02:16.080
boy turned progressive get hit with allegations, but he was ultimately innocent. I was wrong to

02:16.080 --> 02:19.600
talk about it the way that I did. I even apologized to him, though I don't think he even knows who I

02:19.600 --> 02:24.640
am. But the point is, after the ProJared story, I made the decision to not cover shit like this

02:24.640 --> 02:28.880
until the hype died down. And, well, it's been a couple weeks. The hype has died down. I know

02:29.760 --> 02:33.840
I don't cover stories fast enough, but I like catching everything in one pass if possible.

02:33.840 --> 02:38.640
Also, real quick, I'm not going to go into super autistic detail responding to every single claim

02:38.640 --> 02:42.880
made in the various videos and streams today. There's hours of stuff to sift through. I'm

02:42.880 --> 02:46.640
just going to give you the overview of what went down. If you want somebody listening to and

02:46.640 --> 02:52.400
reacting to every single sentence of this drama, Chedlogic is your guy. He's spent like 12 hours

02:52.400 --> 02:57.120
on this shit. Okay, enough nonsense. Let's get going. There's an e-girl with a channel named

02:57.120 --> 03:03.360
Lex Updog, who posted a two hour long video titled My Experience with Don Derr and Super

03:03.360 --> 03:07.680
Mega. Jesus Christ, these allegations are getting longer and longer every single time, aren't they?

03:07.680 --> 03:12.160
Remember back when Angry Joe got slapped with a sex pest allegation? Back then, these were like

03:12.160 --> 03:15.520
twitlongers that took maybe 10 minutes to read throughout the most. Now we're sitting here

03:15.520 --> 03:19.920
watching feature length films about the drama of young California progressives. And it's got that

03:19.920 --> 03:21.840
Zoomer editing too. Like watch this bit.

03:50.560 --> 03:54.320
Look at how jittery it is. She's clearly cutting everything down rather than,

03:54.320 --> 03:57.520
you know, doing one solid take. Except that crying. Got to leave that in.

03:57.520 --> 03:59.600
Okay, okay. Let's listen to the allegation.

04:20.560 --> 04:27.120
Like attempting to physically force me to give him oral. And the only reason why it didn't work

04:27.120 --> 04:33.760
was because I like physically like pushed him away multiple times. When you're in a long

04:33.760 --> 04:38.480
distance relationship with someone, you have to get to know someone. Like I feel like I'm a pretty

04:38.480 --> 04:45.840
direct person. And aside from what the situation has like turned me into, I guess, but I feel like

04:45.840 --> 04:50.800
when this happened, I was like, especially this particular situation, I was like,

04:50.800 --> 04:56.160
no, I don't want to. I don't want to do this. And he kept telling me like, just do it. And

04:56.800 --> 05:02.560
like multiple times while he was trying to force my head down. And he's like way bigger than me.

05:02.560 --> 05:09.840
I don't know. It was, I was really freaked out after that. So eventually he let me go. But I

05:09.840 --> 05:14.960
just kind of shut down and just went with like whatever else he wanted that night. And like for

05:14.960 --> 05:20.320
the rest of the trip, I didn't know what to do in that situation. So it sounds like Lex had an

05:20.320 --> 05:24.960
online only relationship for several years with Don who's a German and the artist for the super

05:24.960 --> 05:29.760
mega channel. They finally met up in real life at Matt's house as she was also friends with Matt and

05:29.760 --> 05:34.080
Ryan, the super mega duo, and he was in America. Their first night together, she's claiming he

05:34.080 --> 05:38.080
tried to force her to do oral. She's kind of ambiguous on whether or not he successfully

05:38.080 --> 05:41.200
forced her to do it, but he was rough and did something that she didn't like and that sexual

05:41.200 --> 05:45.680
assault. Okay. Understood. Before we get in too deep to the schizo ramble, here's what I think

05:45.680 --> 05:51.040
the wider context and timeline is since this video is all over the place. Super mega is in LA. Lex

05:51.040 --> 05:55.040
is in Nashville. Don's in Germany trying to come to the States full time to work for super mega.

05:55.040 --> 06:00.160
In November of 2021, Don and Lex are both visiting the super mega house. And that's when the alleged

06:00.160 --> 06:04.480
sexual assault took place. Despite this, they continue to associate and remain in a relationship

06:04.480 --> 06:09.760
until May of 2022. At that point, the super mega guys, Matt and Ryan, along with Lex and Don attend

06:09.760 --> 06:14.560
creator clash in Tampa, where they share an Airbnb. It's during this trip that Lex ends the

06:14.560 --> 06:18.640
relationship with Don. Let's hear about Don's description of that night's events, because after

06:18.640 --> 06:22.560
this went viral, he wrote up his side of their relationship on Twitter. I want to start this off

06:22.560 --> 06:27.440
by apologizing to Lex for any trauma she may feel regarding our past relationship and to anyone just

06:27.440 --> 06:31.280
finding out about this who feels they were being lied to or kept in the dark. In regards to what

06:31.280 --> 06:36.000
happened during November 2021, this is my side as to what happened. Lex and I were invited over by

06:36.000 --> 06:40.000
Matt to stay over at his place for a week. We had been intimate since day one, but on the third

06:40.000 --> 06:44.560
night, I asked her for oral. She at first said no because she had a cold sore. Later, I asked her

06:44.560 --> 06:49.120
again and she said yes, but to be careful not to be too rough. During the act, I had pushed down on

06:49.120 --> 06:54.000
her head, after which she recoiled and told me I was being too rough. I then profusely apologized

06:54.000 --> 06:59.200
and we ended up watching TV and going to bed after. I just kind of shut down and just went with

06:59.200 --> 07:03.120
like whatever else he wanted that night. Things were normal for the rest of the week until the

07:03.200 --> 07:06.800
trip was over and we went back home. During this time, I was under no impression that

07:06.800 --> 07:10.720
anything traumatizing had occurred. However, I realize now this is extremely upsetting for her.

07:10.720 --> 07:15.680
So to me, so far, calling this sexual assault isn't accurate. He clearly went too far,

07:15.680 --> 07:18.720
but he stopped when she objected. He apologized and they were both good.

07:18.720 --> 07:22.400
Anybody who's been in a relationship knows this is kind of common, where one person accidentally

07:22.400 --> 07:25.680
does something the other person doesn't like. There's no intention to hurt anybody there.

07:25.680 --> 07:30.240
They just stop and deal with it like adults. This is normal behavior. Awkward sexual experiences

07:30.240 --> 07:34.080
aren't assault. They don't need to be policed or brought to light in public. They're simply a part

07:34.080 --> 07:39.680
of having sex. Lex goes over what Dawn acted like after she informed him, making light of his

07:39.680 --> 07:45.200
reaction, calling it performative. The way I told him was basically, I was basically like,

07:45.200 --> 07:51.040
hey, do you remember November when we first hung out? And he was like, yeah. I basically

07:51.040 --> 07:57.200
asked him questions that necessitated him saying yes or no to because I wanted it to be easy for

07:57.200 --> 08:02.720
me and I wanted it to be easy for him because I didn't want it to take too long. I didn't think

08:02.720 --> 08:08.240
it needed to for me to tell him the way I was going to tell him. So I said, um, you remember

08:08.240 --> 08:14.640
the first night, um, when you were like pushing my head down and I was telling you no, yes,

08:14.640 --> 08:19.600
he says basically, um, he like didn't dispute anything that I said. He was just saying yes.

08:19.600 --> 08:24.720
And I was like, you know, that's sexual assault, right? Like you can't do that to people. Like

08:24.720 --> 08:29.120
that wasn't cool that you did that to me. I I've been like, really like messed up that you did

08:29.120 --> 08:34.560
that. I like have to like get better from this. This is something that I'm like having to recover

08:34.560 --> 08:40.640
from because it's making me not well, like basically explained to him all, but like a baby

08:40.640 --> 08:45.600
that sexual assault is bad. And that, that what he did was that, and that you can't do it because

08:45.600 --> 08:50.960
all it takes, like all it would have taken is for me to have been like, no, I don't want to.

08:50.960 --> 08:57.040
And for him to stop, but he didn't nonetheless. So I say all this and he says, so does that mean

08:57.040 --> 09:03.920
you're breaking up with me? And I was like, what? Yeah. To me, it was like, yeah, no. And that out

09:03.920 --> 09:09.520
of everything I said was both the shortest response I had to say, or like the shortest thing

09:09.520 --> 09:14.480
I had to say to him. And the most devastating he we're on the sidewalk, like we're walking

09:14.480 --> 09:19.440
and I'm like, yeah, yeah, no, I don't want to, no, I don't want to be with you. And he stops

09:19.440 --> 09:25.760
directly under the streetlight and does this for like a minute in front of me. I don't know.

09:25.760 --> 09:30.400
It felt super formative. Now remember all of these people are super progressive, super woke,

09:30.400 --> 09:35.120
including Don. Imagine it from his point of view, if he genuinely believed in progressive values,

09:35.120 --> 09:39.360
he's being told that his girlfriend is dumping him and that he unknowingly committed sexual assault

09:39.360 --> 09:44.400
on her. This is how a person with those values would react. This is realistic to me. It's funny

09:44.400 --> 09:48.720
that Lex assumes that Don's reaction is performative when even her miming it is more

09:48.720 --> 09:52.800
convincing than any of her own reactions in her video. Let's go back to Don's statement.

09:52.800 --> 09:57.120
Our relationship seemed to have not changed. We were talking on Discord almost daily and planning

09:57.120 --> 10:01.200
future trips together. However, a couple of months later, we met during Creator Clash.

10:01.200 --> 10:05.360
During the trip, me and Lex stayed together in an Airbnb and I noticed that she was growing

10:05.360 --> 10:09.200
very distant towards me. I asked her about why she was distant and if everything was okay,

10:09.200 --> 10:12.720
but I was not given a straight answer. On the final day, she finally told me why she was so

10:12.720 --> 10:17.120
troubled. She told me I was too rough with her last time and it reminded her of her ex's behavior.

10:17.120 --> 10:20.560
I tried to apologize and we talked a little bit after, but after the conversation had ended,

10:20.560 --> 10:24.000
she had broken up with me and I left the Airbnb to stay with other friends.

10:24.000 --> 10:28.240
At this time, I had contacted Matt and told him it had just gone down. Matt had offered to fly

10:28.240 --> 10:32.640
me to LA to stay at his place to figure things out. At his house, I explained to him and Ryan

10:32.640 --> 10:35.920
what had happened and the details about the November trip and what she had told me after

10:35.920 --> 10:39.920
Creator Clash. After that, I stayed over at his place for the next couple of weeks. Later,

10:39.920 --> 10:43.600
Matt told me that he had made some arrangements for his friends to sleep over at his place,

10:43.600 --> 10:47.920
moving me to stay at their office. A couple of days at the office had passed when Matt called

10:47.920 --> 10:51.920
me and said that Lex was on her way to the office. I was given no prior notice that she

10:51.920 --> 10:56.240
was going to be there or moving to LA. It was at this time I decided to leave and stay with

10:56.240 --> 11:00.320
other friends in the area. After a week, I had flown back to Germany. I was then contacted by

11:00.320 --> 11:04.480
Supermega that they were not going to be using my art anymore. After that, they cut contact with me

11:04.480 --> 11:08.400
and I have not heard from them since. Following this, I decided to send Lex another apology via

11:08.400 --> 11:12.160
Discord, but I got no reply from her. At this time, I accepted that I was not going to hear

11:12.160 --> 11:16.560
back from Lex or Supermega for the foreseeable future. See, this story sounds like Matt is

11:16.560 --> 11:20.560
helping out his friend, putting Don up at the Supermega house until he has gone back to Germany.

11:20.560 --> 11:25.280
But after Lex shows up in LA, suddenly he's cut off. To me, it sounds like Lex probably convinced

11:25.280 --> 11:28.720
Supermega to cut Don loose, and once he was out of the States, they probably figured it was time

11:28.720 --> 11:34.480
to sever ties. Lex all but confirms as much in her video. So there was a chunk of time,

11:34.480 --> 11:39.200
I want to say around a week after I got there, that I just didn't do that much.

11:39.200 --> 11:46.240
That and like mentally recovering from Creator Clash. And as that span of time occurred,

11:46.240 --> 11:53.280
every time I'd look on my phone, I'd notice things were going on in LA. Like, why is Don in LA? I

11:53.280 --> 11:59.280
thought he was going back to Germany. Turns out, Matt invited Don to stay with him after Creator

11:59.280 --> 12:04.320
Clash, after he was done staying in Florida and I think maybe somewhere else. It occurs to me

12:04.320 --> 12:11.840
that I'm going to need to talk to more people about the Don thing, what happened with him,

12:11.840 --> 12:16.160
to give context to why I don't want to see him. Well, would you look at that,

12:16.160 --> 12:20.320
Lex is bedridden back at home due to the trials and tribulations of her drama filled life. She

12:20.320 --> 12:23.600
checks her phone and sees that Don went to LA to hang out with Supermega and she's thinking,

12:23.600 --> 12:27.040
shit, I got to get to LA and talk to those guys. So they know not to hang out with him anymore.

12:27.040 --> 12:31.120
This is unironically despicable behavior. As I said before, Supermega is run by progressives

12:31.120 --> 12:34.800
and watched by progressives. So if I had to guess, there was some ruthless utilitarian

12:34.800 --> 12:38.880
calculus involved here in the optics of keeping on an artist who is being accused of sexual assault,

12:38.880 --> 12:44.240
regardless of the truth of the claims. This is the only claim with possible teeth in Lex's entire

12:44.240 --> 12:48.880
two hour video, that initial sexual assault claim from the November 2021 visit to the Supermega

12:48.880 --> 12:53.600
house. Every other thing she brings up just isn't relevant. It's like she has a vendetta against

12:53.600 --> 12:58.720
Supermega and is using Don's behavior as a way to take them down. So she ropes in every single

12:58.720 --> 13:03.680
other complaint she has and tries to make them look worse by attaching them to the sexual assault.

13:03.680 --> 13:07.920
Here's some examples. Don wanted to stay in the States to keep working on Supermega. Everyone was

13:07.920 --> 13:11.360
friends and they were all cool. So they suggested that he marry Lex to get a green card as an

13:11.360 --> 13:15.280
option. Lex reacted in her video as if this was them selling her off or something.

13:28.720 --> 13:35.600
to come live in the US. And it had been going on for a bit now. And that day, Don had been asking,

13:35.600 --> 13:42.320
he had been talking about it with me. He had been asking Supermega about filing papers to get a

13:42.320 --> 13:49.040
green card. And Matt, at least I know Matt, I'm sure Brian too, Supermega in general, had no

13:49.040 --> 13:56.880
interest in doing that for him. But they never, up until this point, never told him no straight out.

13:56.880 --> 14:02.400
Never was like, yeah, we're not doing that. They would just give reasons why it was really hard or

14:02.400 --> 14:10.160
really expensive to do that. So once again, he asked Matt and him and I were walking up the

14:10.160 --> 14:15.600
stairs to Matt's living room and Matt responded something along the lines of like, why don't you

14:15.600 --> 14:21.760
guys just get married? To which Don seemed like reciprocal to the idea. Like this ain't the Middle

14:21.760 --> 14:26.560
East lady. You can just say no. Lex leaked some discord messages from 2022 months after the

14:26.560 --> 14:30.800
alleged forced blowjob. And Don is here saying I love you very much. And she's replying with I love

14:30.800 --> 14:35.440
you too. This is completely normal relationship stuff. And Lex is trying to spin it like it's

14:35.440 --> 14:39.920
evidence of him manipulating her. The story's unreal, man. Lex mentions that she was on the

14:39.920 --> 14:44.160
Supermega podcast with Don where she was acting uncomfortable with his presence and then says,

14:44.160 --> 14:48.560
go look it up if you want to see it yourself. If you've watched that or listened to that podcast,

14:49.200 --> 14:55.760
there's a part in it where Don starts telling a story, context to do with me or something. There

14:55.760 --> 15:01.280
was a sentence where he starts to say something from having known him on and off for like four

15:01.280 --> 15:08.400
years. I knew that he was going to say something about us dating. And even though I had wanted that

15:08.400 --> 15:15.600
before this trip in November of 2021, I'd asked him multiple times like, do you want to be public

15:15.600 --> 15:20.000
about this? Because we had been before. So I just didn't think of it as a big deal. And he

15:20.000 --> 15:28.320
didn't want to, would still draw me art, but only send it to me. So I got a really bad feeling when

15:28.320 --> 15:33.680
he started to bring it up. Mind you, I hadn't processed what he had done yet at all, really,

15:33.680 --> 15:39.840
besides the fact that I knew he did what I told him not to do. And it made me not feel good. So

15:39.840 --> 15:44.000
if I knew he was about to announce or like not announce or like casually mentioned that we were

15:44.000 --> 15:48.560
dating in a podcast, wouldn't I want him to mention that? Like, like, of course I would,

15:48.560 --> 15:56.800
right? But instead I interrupt him. I, I interrupted him and I made him stop. And I,

15:56.800 --> 16:00.880
I told him like, I just made a joke or something. I think I said like, I'm going to kill you.

16:01.440 --> 16:07.120
If you are somebody that likes their podcast or have watched it before, give a shit,

16:07.760 --> 16:12.800
you can go find it. There's a part where Don just stops talking. And with this context,

16:12.880 --> 16:17.360
if you listen back to it, I think it makes sense. I remember being so anxious. I feel like I was

16:17.360 --> 16:21.200
having like a mini panic attack or something. I did go look it up only to discover that the

16:21.200 --> 16:24.640
podcast had been deleted from the super mega channel. Don't worry though. The internet

16:24.640 --> 16:28.640
never forgets. Both of you guys have been staying with me at my, at my house for the,

16:28.640 --> 16:33.040
for the last week or so, you know, why, why should we tell everyone?

16:34.800 --> 16:39.920
Because I'm going to kill him. Is there a secret? Keep in mind guys, this conversation is after the

16:39.920 --> 16:43.360
sexual assault. Does this sound like she's traumatized and doesn't want him to be there?

16:43.360 --> 16:47.280
Not to me. In fact, despite her earlier claim that he was being distant and manipulative,

16:47.280 --> 16:50.960
it sounds like he wants the relationship to be public and she's the one cutting him off.

16:50.960 --> 16:54.080
I don't know why an OnlyFans model might want to keep her relationship a secret though. That's

16:54.080 --> 16:58.880
just beyond my understanding. Lex talks about a sexual experience she had when she was underage

16:58.880 --> 17:03.440
with a 21 year old man, which doesn't excuse it. It sounds like she won at the time and how that

17:03.440 --> 17:09.520
experience massively traumatized her. 10 years ago this year, I had actually called someone out

17:09.520 --> 17:14.960
before. I did it a bit over a year after it happened because I also didn't process it,

17:14.960 --> 17:22.160
but it was also with an ex-boyfriend. I was 17 and he was 21 and I also told him no the whole

17:22.160 --> 17:27.120
time and he still kept going. So it felt like I was like reliving something I'd gone through before.

17:27.120 --> 17:31.600
Lex draws parallels between the 21 year old's behavior and Don's. Although she never actually

17:31.600 --> 17:36.320
outlines how Don's behavior is abusive, beyond that one awkward experience that Don apologized

17:36.320 --> 17:40.880
for, she still ultimately calls him an abuser in her video. Lex talks about somebody in their

17:40.880 --> 17:44.960
friend circle named Layton who apparently was doing something with Game Grumps in their merch.

17:44.960 --> 17:50.240
I didn't feel comfortable so I called Layton first. I didn't know him nearly as long at all,

17:50.240 --> 17:57.760
but I feel like he had gone through or has gone through enough that him and I both talked about

17:57.760 --> 18:02.880
that I know he would relate when I told him or like understand and like believe me when I told

18:02.880 --> 18:06.240
him. I don't know, I don't really care. It's entirely irrelevant. She probably brought him

18:06.240 --> 18:10.880
up because he believed her story unquestioningly. Lex also talks about how after getting to the

18:10.880 --> 18:15.440
Super Mega House in LA and Don is finally cast out of the friend group, she begins living there with

18:15.440 --> 18:20.320
her friend Rev. They're both trying to get on their feet and find a place to live in LA and Matt and

18:20.320 --> 18:24.960
Ryan are graciously putting them up until they can get their own apartment. Lex is ambiguous about how

18:24.960 --> 18:28.800
long they stayed at the Super Mega House, but it seems to be quite a while as eventually the guys

18:28.800 --> 18:33.120
simply offer to pay the first couple months rent on a new place just to get her out of there. But

18:33.120 --> 18:39.840
listen to how she recontextualizes that gift. Matt offered to pay for me to live somewhere,

18:39.840 --> 18:45.600
like down payment plus several months, which if you're in LA, if you know anything about the

18:45.600 --> 18:51.680
housing market in LA is an exorbitant amount of money. Jim's asleep next to us, just me and him

18:51.760 --> 18:56.320
in his living room and he says this. Most freaked out I think I've ever been by him, aside from the

18:56.320 --> 19:02.800
phone call obviously. I immediately said no. At this point, I didn't fully distrust him. I just

19:02.800 --> 19:09.200
had a gut feeling that no one gives you that amount of money for no reason without something

19:09.200 --> 19:15.520
to gain from it. It felt like a bribe. That's at least like, I don't know, the way he was saying it,

19:15.520 --> 19:20.560
that's at least like 10k. And like regardless of how much it means to him or not, I didn't want it.

19:20.560 --> 19:27.520
I felt like weirded out that he did that. He was saying this so I could live alone in LA. Like

19:27.520 --> 19:35.840
specifically apartment money for me to live alone. It was very weird. I turned him down and you know

19:35.840 --> 19:41.520
we ended whatever conversation we were having and I went to sleep. That's right. Rather than taking

19:41.520 --> 19:46.320
this as a clear sign she needs to move on, she considers it bribe money for covering up the

19:46.320 --> 19:50.960
dawn sexual assault and views it as the super mega crew pushing her to be isolated in LA.

19:50.960 --> 19:55.200
The rest of the video documents Lex's travels with Rev to Nevada to Washington State to

19:55.200 --> 19:58.800
North California, all the while living for free at the super mega house for months,

19:58.800 --> 20:02.560
and Matt and Ryan trying to politely push them into finding their own place to live.

20:02.560 --> 20:07.680
Lex characterizes these excursions simultaneously as vacations and work trips because she would

20:07.680 --> 20:11.680
shoot a few OnlyFans pics on the road, something that she complained she couldn't do at the super

20:11.680 --> 20:15.200
mega house because it's a studio for let's plays not your e-thought stuff.

20:15.200 --> 20:18.720
One of the things was that I noticed when we were gone is that we stopped to getting asked

20:18.720 --> 20:25.040
as many questions. It was mostly just about where we were so they could know when we would be gone

20:25.040 --> 20:31.360
or when we'd be back to be gone fast, right? So and when we were out I would take pictures

20:31.360 --> 20:37.120
and those pictures ended up surprisingly popping off and making me the money I was making last

20:37.120 --> 20:44.400
summer because I couldn't at the super mega plex do regular work. Like I can't set up a photo

20:44.400 --> 20:50.160
photo set station for myself and like take photos and clothes that I wouldn't feel comfortable

20:50.160 --> 20:56.400
wearing around the guys at the office for example. So me getting like a desk or making a workspace

20:56.400 --> 21:00.960
just wasn't an option and I didn't know that until after I got there.

21:00.960 --> 21:04.480
So she's driving around the west half of America going on trips, seeing her friends,

21:04.480 --> 21:08.160
blowing money left and right, tons of frivolous spending by her own admission.

21:08.160 --> 21:16.400
Me and Rav at this point had been going to meet realtors however many other days but we were

21:16.400 --> 21:21.840
one we didn't have like most of our stuff to actually move in and two we were Ubering

21:21.840 --> 21:28.000
everywhere so a lot of the money that could have went to actually securing a place to stay went to

21:28.000 --> 21:33.920
getting an Uber to getting Ubers like hundreds of dollars in Ubers just living in LA.

21:33.920 --> 21:36.240
Her stuff is apparently getting constantly stolen.

21:36.240 --> 21:42.880
Um the day after this conversation takes place we get robbed. I have no photos of that because I

21:42.880 --> 21:48.800
as soon as I woke up and saw the car was empty of stuff I just screamed as loud as possible called

21:48.800 --> 21:54.320
the cops no reason they could not help and then just cried a bunch and then made a post about it

21:54.320 --> 22:00.720
which apparently was laughed at um by the guys at the office. That day that I got robbed and I

22:00.720 --> 22:06.320
post about it no one that I knew in LA messaged me. Her extremely expensive car is constantly

22:06.320 --> 22:11.040
breaking down. Didn't even include in those fingers buying the car. I think we spent two

22:11.040 --> 22:14.880
days on that trying to find the car and then buying it which I could have spent more time on

22:14.880 --> 22:20.160
it because I ended up getting a car that needed a four thousand dollar repair when I got back to LA

22:20.160 --> 22:25.520
so I suffered because of having to rush from knowing I was going to be asked instead of them

22:25.520 --> 22:31.040
just either giving me a date to leave by or asking me like can you is do you know when you

22:31.040 --> 22:36.560
can be gone by instead they would just say you guys on a vacation again and if she's so broke

22:36.560 --> 22:41.760
so hard done by why did she buy a fucking jeep if you just need to be getting around LA why not buy

22:41.760 --> 22:47.040
a little city car jeeps are expensive basically Lex seems to have tons of money and rather than

22:47.040 --> 22:51.120
moving forward with trying to get on her own two feet in LA she's living at the super mega house

22:51.120 --> 22:56.160
for free leeching off of her friends and living the high life when matt and ryan become a bit more

22:56.160 --> 23:00.880
insistent that lex moved the fuck out of their office here's how she frames that situation when

23:00.880 --> 23:08.640
we get back in town there's a group chat where essentially me rav matt and ryan are all going

23:08.640 --> 23:14.880
back and forth and it's basically matt and ryan telling us all the things we did wrong that made

23:14.880 --> 23:21.680
them not want us there anymore after both we got kind of kicked out like nicely kicked out and

23:21.680 --> 23:27.440
robbed and not contacted by them after their next correspondence is like telling us we were dirty

23:27.440 --> 23:33.760
we were dirty the people that would spend hours cleaning up the office from when guys would order

23:33.760 --> 23:38.960
every single day often don't throw it away they had a person come by but it's only once a month so

23:38.960 --> 23:43.680
you can imagine the mess that gets made between the time and it was getting blamed on us we're

23:43.680 --> 23:47.360
still not even at the point where super mega is involved in the drama yet guys dawn's their

23:47.360 --> 23:50.560
channel artist he's already been given the boot you think that would be the end of the drama as

23:50.560 --> 23:54.720
far as super mega is concerned but here is how lex tries to rope them in it's just we're trying

23:54.720 --> 23:59.360
to get our lives together and we've been nothing but generous to y'all during this time i think

23:59.360 --> 24:04.320
the idea that there are grievances time and time again with our friendship when we've been helping

24:04.320 --> 24:11.120
you whenever we can is confusing it's not a good feeling and overwhelming especially since this

24:11.120 --> 24:18.240
year has been nothing but drama since the jump literally nothing to do with me at all or rav

24:18.240 --> 24:23.760
i don't care no one's saying that to me no one's saying i know you've dealt with a lot like like

24:23.760 --> 24:28.080
they're they're saying they're only bringing it up it's like we've dealt with you like rav was

24:28.080 --> 24:33.200
even rav just was like congrats about the bad thing that is good now and when it gets brought

24:33.200 --> 24:38.960
up for us it's about like we've been helping you time and time again and there's still grievances

24:38.960 --> 24:45.200
time and time again it's only been one grievance it was always the same grievance it was the same

24:45.200 --> 24:50.160
thing that no one listened to me for and when i tried to talk about it no one wants to talk about

24:50.160 --> 24:56.960
it and now it's a problem and i'm homeless sitting in this creepy weird uh sex trafficking room

24:56.960 --> 25:02.240
getting told that like we're annoying basically that like we have too many grievances i got

25:02.240 --> 25:07.840
assaulted man could you guys just like care like why'd you switch up what happened to keeping them

25:07.840 --> 25:13.120
accountable ryan like this year's been nothing but drama since the jump for you i don't think

25:13.120 --> 25:17.840
they relate to anything bad that we've been through i don't have to see don anymore what he

25:17.840 --> 25:22.080
did to me i don't have to think about when but when someone is treating me actively different

25:22.080 --> 25:30.240
all the time in front of me my only friends in la that i was my only plan of like staying somewhere

25:30.240 --> 25:36.000
my only like safe place didn't want to help me said they did nothing but helped me and then

25:36.000 --> 25:41.840
gaslit me about it and made me homeless because like sure maybe saying made me homeless was like

25:41.840 --> 25:48.240
is like maybe extreme but one how else would you say that two we could have talked literally all

25:48.240 --> 25:54.320
we had to do was do this we tried doing it even after and they still didn't want to so how do you

25:54.320 --> 25:59.920
get someone to talk to you when they refuse to you just can't you heard that right lex is pinning

25:59.920 --> 26:04.000
everything on super mega because the initial assault that awkward sexual encounter with

26:04.000 --> 26:08.400
don that apparently was tantamount to super rape that happened at matt's house during a party what

26:08.400 --> 26:11.920
the fuck man what do you expect them to do they already fired him and now that they want you to

26:11.920 --> 26:15.440
stop partying and spending all your money while living rent-free in their studio and they're

26:15.440 --> 26:19.840
getting tired with the whole oh i lost my phone all my laptop got stolen stuff and they want you

26:19.840 --> 26:24.800
gone you're blaming them and saying they're not taking the dawn assault story seriously enough

26:24.800 --> 26:28.960
in fact the end of this tale is that lex had to move back home because she couldn't make it and

26:28.960 --> 26:34.080
she blames that on matt and ryan i had so much stuff i couldn't fit it all in one trip to go

26:34.640 --> 26:42.560
so i had to drop off some of it at a storage unit we moved to uh airbnb in hollywood in september

26:42.560 --> 26:49.600
and september was the last month i stayed in la until i was finally able to get back home you know

26:49.600 --> 26:55.680
what matt did before crater clash this year he texted me how's tennessee as if he's not the reason

26:55.680 --> 27:01.040
i'm there and when i didn't respond he took me off his instagram close friends did not follow

27:01.040 --> 27:06.000
me he just like didn't want me to see the stuff he really has to say that's right the reason lex's

27:06.000 --> 27:10.880
big move to la failed is because the people she was mooching off of finally kicked her out okay

27:10.880 --> 27:15.360
here's that tiny nugget in here that got super mega's audience to turn on them it's when lex

27:15.360 --> 27:19.520
claims that matt's response to her alleged sexual assault at the hands of dawn was to say that he

27:19.520 --> 27:24.080
didn't want this drama to destroy super mega when someone says like hey your friend assaulted me

27:24.080 --> 27:30.960
that friend happens to be a co-worker can we like can i not see him and you say this job is my

27:30.960 --> 27:36.560
magnum opus multiple times there's like you just like don't care about people you just like care

27:36.560 --> 27:41.840
about yourself like you're like you just don't see people as like real things anymore and definitely

27:41.840 --> 27:45.920
is like how i felt to him if true that's obviously pretty shitty to say that he's more worried about

27:45.920 --> 27:49.440
these allegations tanking his channel than he is about the allegation that one of his friends

27:49.440 --> 27:54.240
sexually assaulted another one of his friends and then lex alleges a second sexual assault

27:54.240 --> 28:02.080
by a different guy and okay so my reference of jim is that this is a silly guy so when he like

28:02.080 --> 28:06.960
sits down on the couch next to me and then lays down and stretches out i'm like he's just being

28:06.960 --> 28:13.680
silly so i tell him the whole story i tell him everything that happened you know up until then

28:13.680 --> 28:18.880
i'm pretty sure i even said about that um don was there at the office and all that and just

28:18.880 --> 28:25.360
because he was he came to me asking why i looked upset a lot so of course that's all that's all

28:25.360 --> 28:31.840
the reasons when he heard my story he was like man i'm so sorry and then proceed to like start

28:31.840 --> 28:37.520
flirting with me like right after i and like this is when i realized because i was doing most of

28:37.520 --> 28:42.240
talking that after i was done with the story and he started talking like he started saying flirty

28:42.240 --> 28:48.880
things and like he started putting me in a headlock that i was like oh he's drunk and like

28:48.880 --> 28:53.920
pretty much right after i realized that he started kissing me um if you've ever seen a picture of jim

28:53.920 --> 28:59.920
he's a really tall guy i it was not even in my brain to be like get this guy off of me or like

28:59.920 --> 29:06.080
not get this guy off me yes i didn't want to kiss him because to me this guy i am not that close

29:06.080 --> 29:11.440
friends with like we are just from the same place and like i thought he wanted to like get to know

29:11.440 --> 29:17.440
me better listens to my sexual assault story and then makes out with me like at this rate i'm just

29:17.440 --> 29:22.480
kind of stun locked i had no idea what he's doing i don't know if there's even any other people in

29:22.480 --> 29:28.000
the place i think there was two other people i think matt and rav were still there so he like

29:28.000 --> 29:33.360
gets up at some point after like putting me in a choke hold a few more times and kissing he only

29:33.360 --> 29:37.120
kissed me a couple times but he put me in a choke hold for a while and it was very uncomfortable

29:37.120 --> 29:42.160
he like gets up and then goes to the office and he's like come here i don't even remember

29:42.160 --> 29:47.600
thinking anything i was literally just like confused and he because when he said that he was

29:47.600 --> 29:54.960
in the office but he was in the closet and when i came over to him because i was just fucking i was

29:54.960 --> 29:59.520
like why the my in my head i'm thinking why is this guy just went to the office closet like the

29:59.520 --> 30:04.080
office where like everybody has their computers and there's like a coat closet and you just go

30:04.080 --> 30:09.280
in there and stand in the doorway and give me a kiss again like i didn't even have like a

30:09.280 --> 30:14.400
reaction i just didn't know what the fuck that was and then after that i was like do you like

30:14.400 --> 30:19.760
me or something because i genuinely just so like it came out of nowhere like i said i just told him

30:19.760 --> 30:26.000
about being assaulted and he does this and his answer is i think you're cute is so fucking weird

30:26.000 --> 30:29.520
okay okay he's drunk you didn't realize it he's putting the moves on you he kisses you you don't

30:29.520 --> 30:34.480
want it i got it the issue is when he moves from the living room to the back room and then beckons

30:34.480 --> 30:38.880
you over you know what he's thinking after the kiss you're not retarded if you weren't into it

30:38.880 --> 30:44.160
why did you go over there with him at some point you can't blame other people for your actions

30:44.160 --> 30:49.600
saying shit like my self-esteem was so poor i just do whatever the men around me want doesn't make it

30:49.600 --> 30:54.640
their fault it is your responsibility to assert your own boundaries and manage your own weaknesses

30:54.640 --> 31:01.520
like listen to her wording here he had essentially used me for nudes i had a not

31:01.520 --> 31:08.640
safe for work patreon and he used to sub to it when we weren't dating anymore and so i kept like

31:08.640 --> 31:14.080
a boundary with him over it because i was mad at him not necessarily mad at him but i you know he

31:14.080 --> 31:19.280
was my ex i didn't want to talk to him and gradually he like pushed that boundary over

31:19.280 --> 31:26.320
he like unsubbed from my patreon at one point when we were talking normally enough and he like

31:26.320 --> 31:34.160
would message me and ask me if it would be okay if i would send him like the files from the patreon

31:34.160 --> 31:39.120
and i would be like you mean like the old ones that you're subbed to and he was like no like new

31:39.120 --> 31:44.720
ones or like all of them i didn't want to but my boundaries were so poor i said yeah anyway like

31:44.720 --> 31:49.920
at this point we talked enough that i thought he liked me so i was trying not to assume poorly of

31:49.920 --> 31:55.360
him uh because i just genuinely didn't think he would do that and then he did so he was like

31:55.360 --> 32:00.480
letting me leak my own nudes to him he was letting me leak my own nudes to him like he has

32:00.480 --> 32:06.240
control over whether or not you allow this no you did this he asked you you complied it might have

32:06.240 --> 32:10.800
been shitty of him to ask that doesn't mean that he's at fault for your compliance lex ultimately

32:10.800 --> 32:17.120
blames this on some new quasi-therapeutic bullshit called flight or fawn you know how there's fight

32:17.120 --> 32:23.200
flight or fawn i think i did fawn i'm looking this up i don't want to fuck this up fawn people

32:23.200 --> 32:28.560
pleaser lack of identity no boundaries overwhelmed codependent yep flight or fight we all know well

32:28.560 --> 32:32.480
enough it refers to two psychological knee-jerk responses to a threat you run away or you fight

32:32.480 --> 32:38.720
back well modern therapy speak has led to flight or fawn taking its place where people like lex

32:38.720 --> 32:42.880
knee-jerk to either running away or cuddling up to their abusers in an attempt to minimize the

32:42.880 --> 32:47.200
abuse there's probably some psychological basis for this but i'm willing to bet this became a

32:47.200 --> 32:51.760
thing solely because some middle-aged hipster therapist wanted a way to tell her neurotic

32:51.760 --> 32:55.760
sexually dysfunctional female clients that they're not at fault for any bad decisions they make in

32:55.760 --> 33:00.560
their lives these people are not mature enough to engage in sexual activity i know they're legally

33:00.560 --> 33:05.040
mature enough and physically sure but mentally lex seems to be about 12 years old you don't

33:05.040 --> 33:09.520
innocently walk into a side room with a drunk guy after making out without any expectation

33:09.520 --> 33:13.920
of what's going to happen next unless you're either extremely dishonest or extremely immature

33:13.920 --> 33:18.480
every time she talks about an event it's never her fault a man must have mind fucked her and if she

33:18.480 --> 33:22.080
agreed to do it it wasn't really her the tragedies of life just keep coming at her from all directions

33:22.080 --> 33:26.080
like they do for all of us and you can't expect her to stop vacationing and stop mooching when her

33:26.080 --> 33:30.880
dog died and her car breaks down or her phone gets stolen she genuinely sounds like a child i know

33:30.880 --> 33:35.680
that victims of legitimate sexual assault or rape or abuse or whatever can often make bad decisions

33:35.680 --> 33:39.760
in the moment that if they weren't emotionally compromised they wouldn't make but we're talking

33:39.760 --> 33:44.800
about months and months and years of interactions where she just keeps coming back keeps doing the

33:44.800 --> 33:49.200
same stuff and it doesn't square up with me that's not proof but my gut tells me this is all trumped

33:49.200 --> 33:52.960
up i don't buy the whole oh it takes time to process the trauma thing in this case not with

33:52.960 --> 33:58.560
that awkward dawn experience anyway i mean it is entirely possible that lex is just massively fucked

33:58.560 --> 34:02.560
up from that sexual experience with a 21 year old when she was a teenager it's also entirely

34:02.560 --> 34:06.880
possible she is throwing everything possible at the wall in order to tie super mega to the

34:06.880 --> 34:11.280
awkward sexual experience she had with don that she has retroactively defined as a sexual assault

34:11.280 --> 34:16.400
despite continuing the relationship with him for months as a way to cancel super mega as revenge

34:16.400 --> 34:21.440
for her big career leap of moving to la failing because they wouldn't let her mooch off of them

34:21.440 --> 34:26.240
anymore and kicked her free-loading ass out of the super mega house frankly it's probably both

34:26.240 --> 34:30.000
everything in lex's video feels like a vindictive ex-girlfriend bringing up all the things that her

34:30.000 --> 34:33.520
former boyfriend did that she didn't like and now that they've broken up it's time to air all the

34:33.520 --> 34:38.160
dirty laundry and she's doing it under the cover of an assault or abuse allegation feels very jonah

34:38.160 --> 34:44.240
hill all over again you know in lex's entire video the only thing that matters is did don actually

34:44.240 --> 34:49.200
commit the assault everything else is just window dressing anyway yeah lex's attempt to make it to

34:49.200 --> 34:53.920
the big city finally ends with her after returning from a seattle trip with rev staying at a hostel

34:53.920 --> 34:58.480
in santa monica that she describes as sex trafficker giga rape central which she blames

34:58.480 --> 35:04.240
super mega for as they won't let her stay with them anymore so after we go to seattle get robbed

35:04.240 --> 35:11.360
in portland the stuff we get robbed of laptop ipad work clothes makeup toiletries i'm a model and an

35:11.360 --> 35:18.080
artist those are all the things that i need to make money in the world so at that point priority

35:18.080 --> 35:23.120
number one was no longer finding a place to live but rebuying those things so i can make the money

35:23.120 --> 35:29.200
to get a place to live at this point we just had drove back into town and we had nowhere to stay

35:29.200 --> 35:35.520
trying to save all of our money to rebuy our stuff asap so since i have a jeep we just sleep in the

35:35.520 --> 35:44.160
car i go to santa monica malibu area in between there and just go park by the ocean um because

35:44.160 --> 35:52.640
it's free the first place we stayed outside of the plex was like some rinky dink hotel in

35:52.640 --> 36:00.560
pasadena it was like obviously like used for sex trafficking like it was a giant master bedroom

36:00.560 --> 36:06.400
with a hot tub and and it had a corded phone with the cable cut she eventually has to go back to

36:06.400 --> 36:10.320
nashville and she blames the power dynamics of super mega being a large youtube channel and

36:10.320 --> 36:14.000
white males and all the rest of it as to why her career didn't take off and she couldn't hack it

36:14.000 --> 36:19.440
in la the way these guys like do group chats is they all go in the office together and say and

36:19.440 --> 36:25.920
like play football and like make a plan and like who's doing good cop bad cop ass shit very

36:25.920 --> 36:31.520
manipulative but how else do you think they would have had jim message me with matt in there they

36:31.520 --> 36:36.480
all work together why does matt need to be in there except for a power dynamic like they know

36:36.480 --> 36:41.440
what they're doing here's the final spin that she pulls in the story i've been holding on to this

36:41.440 --> 36:47.120
weight for over a year for no reason what loyalty do these people have to me that i need to be like

36:47.120 --> 36:51.680
i need to protect them what did they do for me they let me stay at their place and then made me

36:51.680 --> 36:56.480
feel weird about it after they were like hey your assaulter's gonna be here when i got there like

36:56.480 --> 37:01.040
i don't know they make and then they word stuff like i have to feel like i owe them something

37:01.040 --> 37:05.040
i don't owe them anything they weren't charging you rent they said i could stay there you know

37:05.040 --> 37:09.520
if he didn't like me there he could have done a lot of different things he could just opened his

37:09.520 --> 37:15.120
mouth and talked to me that's what adults do contrary to popular belief adults communicate

37:15.120 --> 37:21.520
and uh are mature and don't just leave everything to text and their employees and act like that's

37:21.520 --> 37:28.160
normal and gaslight people about it and gaslight people about like being upset about your reaction

37:28.160 --> 37:33.760
to assault that's right dawn's a rapist super mega fired him not for her sake but to cover it up and

37:33.760 --> 37:37.840
save their own skin and lex is the victim because she can no longer stay with them free of charge

37:37.920 --> 37:43.760
but before she finishes up lex drops this fucking bombshell i don't think they relate to anything

37:43.760 --> 37:50.640
bad that we've been through and the one thing they could which was rav's uh partner attempting to

37:50.640 --> 37:56.560
like take themselves was daniel their friend daniel matt's like at least twice in front of me

37:57.360 --> 38:02.880
separate times we'll hang out with him has called daniel a coward so no they don't care about

38:02.880 --> 38:08.880
suicide they don't give a shit about suicide they only give a shit about themselves and who

38:08.880 --> 38:13.760
they can make jokes of that are under them that they can get away with for those of you who don't

38:13.760 --> 38:18.640
know daniel was the irl friend of matt and ryan the three of them were pals before youtube before

38:18.640 --> 38:23.360
super mega they ran the youtube channel syndigo from 2012 until 2015 creating some really funny

38:23.360 --> 38:28.320
videos the channel ended when daniel killed himself in 2015 unlike super mega which got

38:28.320 --> 38:32.240
big due to the game grumps connection syndigo blew up because the three of them genuinely worked

38:32.240 --> 38:37.280
well together and they consistently made good viral content it's not an exaggeration to say

38:37.280 --> 38:41.280
that matt and ryan may never have recovered their careers after the loss of daniel without the

38:41.280 --> 38:46.080
exposure of game grumps after daniel's suicide matt and ryan stopped updating the syndigo channel

38:46.080 --> 38:49.760
after posting a video discussing what happened in a tribute to daniel and then went on to reboot

38:49.760 --> 38:54.000
their youtube careers with the super mega channel i've seen long-time viewers of matt and ryan

38:54.000 --> 38:58.240
remark that their humor on super mega is nowhere near as good as their humor on syndigo i'm

38:58.240 --> 39:02.080
presuming partially because daniel was an integral component of their dynamic and partially because

39:02.080 --> 39:06.960
daniel's suicide radically changed matt and ryan's personalities for lex to bring daniel up and make

39:06.960 --> 39:11.440
the claim that matt actually didn't give a shit about him that is the ultimate low blow that is

39:11.440 --> 39:15.840
the moment that it's confirmed she truly is a heartless bitch way earlier in the video in one

39:15.840 --> 39:20.320
of lex's side stories i mentioned a guy named latin and his weird dealings with game grumps merch

39:20.320 --> 39:24.880
well you know how a canceling event goes right when lex's story went viral everybody who ever

39:24.880 --> 39:28.640
had a beef with super mega came out of the woodwork to pile on and one of them was latin

39:28.640 --> 39:34.160
this living broccoli patch of a zoomer all right let's see what he's got to say i found super mega

39:34.160 --> 39:41.280
in college i was three weeks older than matt i was so inspired by the stupid shit that these boys were

39:41.280 --> 39:50.880
doing and i felt like i don't know like i was inspired my entire career got started in 2017

39:51.520 --> 40:00.080
by h3 h3 and that all i've ever wanted to do is youtube make making content making clothing making

40:00.080 --> 40:05.440
like drawing like producing videos doing content has been the only thing i've ever wanted to do

40:06.160 --> 40:13.200
and super mega was the first channel that i fully interacted with in person that like

40:14.320 --> 40:18.560
wanted to put me in things dude why are you fucking crying right off the bat you just started

40:18.560 --> 40:22.320
the stream what the fuck man are you this week look at his chat room it's full of simps i had

40:22.320 --> 40:25.840
to pull this from chud's video because latin's taking his vod down look at all the mouth

40:25.840 --> 40:30.160
breathers they're just here to enjoy the spectacle of somebody getting ruined over drama that's it

40:30.160 --> 40:34.000
as for latin himself it sounds like he really idolized super mega he really wanted to be a

40:34.000 --> 40:37.840
youtuber himself and he considered working for them to be a real opportunity which is apparently

40:37.840 --> 40:42.800
why he's crying so much latin's story is just as meandering as lex's where he relitigates every

40:42.800 --> 40:46.240
single thing that ever went wrong in his life presumably as a way to garner sympathy from

40:46.240 --> 40:50.800
the audience and make him seem less responsible for his actions a lot of it is gay kid bullied

40:50.800 --> 40:54.400
in high school for being gay kind of stuff and fair enough that can be pretty rough but here's

40:54.400 --> 41:00.320
the actual meat of his allegation also by the way you guys when matt and ryan fired me um they

41:00.320 --> 41:05.200
offered me two months severance in exchange for a contract to never talk about them

41:06.880 --> 41:14.480
and because i'm an artist and i live in la and i need fucking money i signed the goddamn contract

41:15.280 --> 41:23.760
and it was like all right there i go like i just you guys now know in perpetuity that i can't say

41:23.760 --> 41:27.520
it's the golden like it's it's called a non-disparagement it means that if you can't

41:27.520 --> 41:34.160
say anything nice about them you can't say anything at all and i am so fucking terrified

41:34.160 --> 41:40.640
that these guys are gonna sue me because i can't afford to legally represent myself and that's why

41:40.640 --> 41:45.120
and that's why i've been so fucking scared to talk about these guys holy shit dude are you

41:45.120 --> 41:50.480
actually admitting on stream that you're breaking your fucking nda with super mega they handed latin

41:50.480 --> 41:54.400
a big sack of money with the understanding that he would not do exactly what he's doing right now

41:54.400 --> 41:59.200
which makes him deleting his fucking stream make a lot more sense this guy's a super dumbass brother

41:59.200 --> 42:04.240
like i'm trying to like pay rent like i'm not trying to like get in a fucking lawsuit i don't

42:04.240 --> 42:08.560
want drama i don't want the drama well then what are you doing here bro latin makes the claim that

42:08.560 --> 42:12.720
super mega made a joke about his lithium use on their podcast which is pretty fucking dumb to do

42:12.720 --> 42:17.600
about your employee's mental illness on air yeah i hadn't really made my mental health a fucking

42:17.600 --> 42:22.400
bang publicly and then i'm streaming one day and then matt uh it was someone in my chat just was

42:22.400 --> 42:27.440
like hey matt said on the podcast that he's gonna take away your uh your fucking lithium i have

42:27.440 --> 42:33.360
uh bipolar 2 or like something like that one's a lot and i played it off on stream you know but

42:33.360 --> 42:39.120
like afterwards like it was fucking weird yep fair enough that's a weird joke to make especially if

42:39.120 --> 42:44.000
latin's medical issues aren't public he's got a point there latin's next claim revolves around

42:44.000 --> 42:48.240
him thinking that everyone at the workplace hates him anytime i would come into the office five days

42:48.240 --> 42:53.840
a week uh pretty much here's how the operation would work if i come into a room where everybody's

42:53.840 --> 42:58.400
in they're laughing they're joking if i join the conversation if i sit in and i listen

42:58.400 --> 43:05.760
i'm fine but if i start talking and i actually involve myself either the group circles in closer

43:05.760 --> 43:12.400
so i'm not in the actual physical circle um someone will talk over me until i shut up

43:14.400 --> 43:22.160
someone will say a joke like you're gay uh or you know stuff like that uh because it's funny

43:22.160 --> 43:29.440
because it's funny um but people would i would get downplayed or ignored or talked over or just

43:31.360 --> 43:36.640
i was given this like petty treatment and then i'm sitting there thinking these guys clearly

43:36.640 --> 43:40.880
fucking hate me because they're doing this to me every day and then i ask them if we're why

43:40.880 --> 43:44.400
they hate me and if they have issues and they're like we're good with our issues we just need to

43:44.400 --> 43:49.840
communicate more but yet they keep fucking doing this shit to me they kept literally these people

43:49.840 --> 43:53.920
in front of me would like imagine like the people who you think are your best friends

43:54.480 --> 43:59.440
now imagine all of them in front of you making plans to hang out with each other after work

43:59.440 --> 44:04.320
all the fucking time and not at inviting you and it's not like i felt entitled like i had to be

44:04.320 --> 44:10.560
involved but it literally felt like petty shit that they were making plans in front of me because

44:10.560 --> 44:16.160
they know they all knew that they were my only friends at the time like around like my other

44:16.160 --> 44:20.960
friends also do content and they're very very busy with their jobs so those guys i saw the most

44:20.960 --> 44:26.000
so they would be making plans to go do shit after work in front of me and then not ask me if i

44:26.000 --> 44:34.160
wanted to go and then i it happened so much that i truly feel like it was it was on purpose this

44:34.160 --> 44:38.720
is just work drama and friend group drama at this point nobody's obligated to like you off the clock

44:38.720 --> 44:42.640
are you still mentally back in high school dude you're acting like it well hold on he

44:42.640 --> 44:47.760
did say he has anxiety and bpd and bipolar maybe he actually is i was telling these fuckers

44:48.640 --> 44:57.360
constantly about my bp1 my bipolar 1 and bpd and my paranoia and how i literally feel like every

44:57.360 --> 45:03.040
person in my fucking life hates me all the time but then latin recontextualizes a huge chunk of

45:03.040 --> 45:07.760
lex's story from the previous part listen to this like lex and rav are the people that like

45:08.720 --> 45:13.040
when you're hanging out with them they're always the ones contributing all the wheat they're the

45:13.040 --> 45:18.640
ones that are ordering uber eats and then they pass you their phone and you're like no i'm not

45:18.640 --> 45:22.560
really hungry i don't want to get anything like i can't afford it right now and then they're like

45:22.560 --> 45:26.000
instantly they they look at you like you're fucking stupid for assuming that you have to pay

45:26.000 --> 45:30.480
them back like they would just be like no like we're boys i got you yeah dude that's why they

45:30.480 --> 45:34.400
didn't have the cash to stay in la they were blowing it all on weed and uber eats they're

45:34.560 --> 45:38.960
literally the taylor the rens millennial $22 avocado toast can't afford a house meme

45:38.960 --> 45:42.880
man the fucking gall to say that you're poor and you're homeless and it's other people's fault that

45:42.880 --> 45:46.640
your big adventure of moving to la failed and you had to move back home when you're spending

45:46.640 --> 45:51.520
all your money on takeout and weed latin then pulls the same dick punch move that lex did

45:51.520 --> 45:56.000
bringing up daniel's suicide however he recontextualizes it to be about his own suicide

45:56.000 --> 46:01.360
attempts they would make jokes about daniel like they would make jokes for like like i'm someone

46:01.440 --> 46:07.440
where like i've attempted suicide i am a very depressed person because of my bipolar

46:07.440 --> 46:14.880
i make jokes about killing myself all the time that is a true fact but i make jokes about myself

46:14.880 --> 46:20.640
or things like that i'm not making jokes to hurt people or making jokes about people that have

46:20.640 --> 46:29.520
hurt themselves but matt and ryan make jokes about daniel like like they make jokes about daniel

46:29.520 --> 46:33.680
that's right latin makes it all about him and how uncomfortable them talking about daniel's

46:33.680 --> 46:37.600
suicide made him i'm sorry bro you're just not mentally stable enough to be an internet

46:37.600 --> 46:42.000
personality as simple as that regardless of the veracity of any of your claims or any good reasons

46:42.000 --> 46:45.920
you have for being fucked up or whatever if you are so weak that you just crumple like this at

46:45.920 --> 46:50.400
the slightest bit of pushback get off the camera dog part of that suicide conversation revolved

46:50.400 --> 46:54.480
around how there was some kid who tried to kill himself and super mega had the opportunity to send

46:54.480 --> 46:58.800
him some free merch sign it you know do a good deed the problem is this kid wasn't even a fan

46:58.800 --> 47:08.240
of super mega his family knew that he loved youtube comedy but they couldn't confirm if he

47:08.240 --> 47:16.800
was a fan of super mega that they just didn't know but they knew he liked youtube comedy

47:16.800 --> 47:22.400
i i got the merch ordered for the kid without talking to the boys first but i come to them

47:22.400 --> 47:27.920
they're both sitting in their desks um in this office and uh there were four desks

47:29.280 --> 47:34.080
everyone had like matt and ryan are on opposite sides of the room and then across from that

47:34.080 --> 47:42.400
you have my desk and justin's desk um and uh justin was there that day uh he was in the room

47:42.400 --> 47:50.320
with us and so i thought nothing of the story like i didn't think it was gonna be a big deal

47:50.320 --> 47:56.880
like i i asked matt and ryan to sign this book and i start telling them the story and they

47:56.880 --> 48:05.600
instantly just like go the fuck off on these stupid fucking jokes being like like they they

48:05.600 --> 48:11.280
had to go why are we doing this he's not a fan like how do we know he's a fan like it and i was

48:11.280 --> 48:18.640
like it doesn't matter just give him the fucking book no it absolutely matters it's one thing if

48:18.960 --> 48:23.120
some fan is suicidal and they love your shit and your videos help them get through the day and you

48:23.120 --> 48:26.800
send them a goodie bag that's a good deed but if you're just sending your junk to random suicidal

48:26.800 --> 48:31.360
kids that's not helping out the community that's shamelessly promoting yourself off of their

48:31.360 --> 48:35.520
suicide attempt also this is just a personal theory that i have there's no proof of it but

48:35.520 --> 48:39.520
latin mentions offhandedly that the kid in question is somebody that his mom knows back

48:39.520 --> 48:44.800
in his hometown my mom instantly like you know she's like yes i can get latin to get some merch

48:44.800 --> 48:50.080
get him a book like we have to help him was he just trying to score some free shit for somebody

48:50.080 --> 48:54.240
using his connections it's possible but again there's no proof it just feels likely to me

48:54.240 --> 49:00.000
personally next up are latin's complaints about workplace shenanigans i get hired i join the team

49:00.000 --> 49:07.840
officially and then i'm walking down the hallway towards the kitchen and matt yells from the office

49:07.840 --> 49:15.360
in the back room that he's going that he will that he might as well show me his dick and balls

49:15.360 --> 49:22.880
because i'm gonna see it anyways so he goes hey latin and i turn around and sure like i didn't

49:22.880 --> 49:28.160
you know what i mean like it's i just think it's a bit but i turn around but the dude's

49:28.160 --> 49:36.000
dick and balls are out these guys in front of me decide and um our cinematographer tucker um

49:36.720 --> 49:43.840
they decide that they want to compare their assholes to each other so one one at a time

49:43.840 --> 49:49.120
matt and ryan decide to just pull their their pants down um right next to me while i just have

49:49.120 --> 49:55.760
to be sitting there on camera uh and show they're they're literally like faces in each other's

49:55.760 --> 50:02.560
assholes matt jackson like go out we get extra drunk we're having the time of our life like

50:02.560 --> 50:07.600
yeah we're just in this bar we're getting blasted and then at one point i go to the bathroom

50:08.560 --> 50:15.840
and i go into the stall and i close the door and i'm peeing and the next thing that i know

50:16.400 --> 50:24.720
is that matt's now entered my stall that i'm in that i closed the door and his camera is like

50:24.720 --> 50:31.360
put out in front so he's like front facing he's he's filming just my dick and balls he's filming

50:31.360 --> 50:35.360
me pee okay you know what fair enough he's got a point your boss shouldn't be pulling out his

50:35.360 --> 50:39.360
dick and balls and showing them to you at the office or showing his asshole to other guys in

50:39.360 --> 50:44.160
the recording room or recording employees taking a piss at some point your youtube channel gets big

50:44.160 --> 50:47.680
enough that it's not just heterosexual life partners fucking around anymore it's real

50:47.680 --> 50:51.680
employment you can't be doing that shit layton then takes the opportunity to go into matt cheating

50:51.680 --> 50:56.080
on his girlfriend which is shitty but it's got nothing to do with layton or the workplace nonsense

50:56.080 --> 51:04.000
then last summer uh i was the only person that didn't know that matt was cheating on his

51:04.000 --> 51:11.200
girlfriend that i was a i was close with like matt's matt's girlfriend was such a good person

51:11.200 --> 51:20.240
to me and i i loved her i still do um but i didn't know that matt was cheating on his girlfriend with

51:20.240 --> 51:25.440
a new girl that had just joined our friend group that his girlfriend was scared of and felt like

51:25.440 --> 51:34.080
was uh an issue um all at this exact same time while matt's having his his little secret

51:34.080 --> 51:43.280
relationship that i didn't know about there was a night that uh me matt and jim drank so much

51:44.080 --> 51:52.480
and at the end of the night uh this this girl comes over and matt and her just like laying

51:52.480 --> 51:58.240
on the floor really really close and it's like it felt like middle school flirting and it was icky

51:59.360 --> 52:06.480
but like i wasn't seeing anything that was like to me that consisted as cheating but it wasn't

52:06.480 --> 52:11.440
enough for me to feel like i could go to his ex and tell her at the time well his current

52:11.440 --> 52:15.760
girlfriend at the time i couldn't text her and be like hey matt's doing something um plus i didn't

52:15.760 --> 52:21.040
want to risk my fucking job you know he goes into being raped while he was underage yeah again

52:21.040 --> 52:29.680
really bad but nothing to do with super mega i was raped by a youtuber he got me really fucking high

52:29.680 --> 52:36.160
and then he raped me and he told me that i was his boyfriend now and that we were you know we

52:36.160 --> 52:40.720
loved each other and that's what we would do now and the next morning his friends told me his

52:40.720 --> 52:45.840
friends found out his friends told me i was so young and that they i didn't know what just

52:45.840 --> 52:49.200
happened to me and i didn't believe them because i thought i was mature for my age because he

52:49.200 --> 52:53.600
treated me like an adult and i was like no we're fine he then goes into another employee named

52:53.600 --> 52:58.160
jim and how he gets all this special treatment but look at how he describes that jim could just

52:58.160 --> 53:04.720
like be like oh no my friend had a bad morning so i i had to take him to lunch and take him out all

53:04.720 --> 53:11.200
day and and i i just had to go baby my my little friend and then matt and ryan would just like be

53:11.200 --> 53:15.840
like yeah sure yeah dude when jim has a friend that needs special care latin makes fun of him

53:15.840 --> 53:19.680
for being childish but when latin or lex or any of their associates need special care they're

53:19.680 --> 53:24.400
crying and screaming about how super mega doesn't care about them how dare you latin then goes into

53:24.400 --> 53:28.720
the circumstances of him getting fired but oddly enough he doesn't actually go into why he got

53:28.720 --> 53:34.320
fired matt and ryan were like hey dude we have to talk to you like when i when you get if you guys

53:34.320 --> 53:40.880
remember when i drove to vegas i knew that whole drive that matt and ryan were gonna fire me on

53:40.880 --> 53:46.960
monday monday comes around they tell me that they still have some things to talk about between the

53:46.960 --> 53:54.880
two of them so they're gonna talk to me on tuesday tuesday comes they're not at the office again

53:55.520 --> 54:01.360
and i'm really paranoid i'm terrified that i'm gonna lose my job and i'm gonna lose my insurance

54:01.920 --> 54:07.120
and the insurance is all i needed super mega for obviously i need the money to pay my bills

54:07.120 --> 54:17.760
but i need my medication and they on that second day like i ended up texting the two of them and

54:17.760 --> 54:25.040
i asked them i was like can you guys just please like confirm to me if i have a job still or not

54:25.040 --> 54:35.280
because like i need to start processing if i need to leave california uh and they they were like

54:35.280 --> 54:40.240
sorry dude our hands are tied for your benefit they kept saying that they said it was for my

54:40.240 --> 54:46.720
benefit so uh later that week it's basically i think it's like maybe wednesday then is the next

54:46.720 --> 54:53.360
day they tell me to come in and uh i get there and i walk in the door and i just knew i was

54:53.360 --> 55:03.760
about to lose my job so uh i was in and out in under i would say 20 minutes um they told me that

55:03.760 --> 55:11.520
i was done uh i tried to explain to them some issues that i have with them but they instantly

55:11.520 --> 55:17.920
shut me down and tried to explain to me that it's my fault um so i realized again that i was

55:17.920 --> 55:23.120
ignorant for trying to explain to them why why they were wrong so i just let them talk

55:24.000 --> 55:30.000
uh and then matt and ryan tell me that i have to sign a non-disparagement contract

55:30.560 --> 55:38.720
if i want severance they basically bragged to me that they didn't have to give me severance

55:38.720 --> 55:45.600
but they felt like they were so good to me like they like matt and ryan felt like they were

55:46.640 --> 55:52.480
blessing a poor person by handing them money and they were but it was it's two months severance

55:52.480 --> 56:01.600
like if like that's genuinely nothing like i'm sorry like like yeah like it's money obviously

56:02.160 --> 56:07.120
but two months severance is so fucked up and it wasn't even like they told me we're gonna also

56:07.120 --> 56:11.600
try to see if we can extend medical benefits or anything they just didn't care they're like all

56:11.600 --> 56:20.640
right here's here's two months rent uh and uh you can never fucking talk about us so yeah latin

56:20.640 --> 56:25.360
signed the nda he knew he couldn't do what he's doing now and decided to do it anyway no sympathy

56:25.360 --> 56:30.000
for this retard anyway latin skimmed over a big part of why he got fired he set up a super mega

56:30.000 --> 56:34.560
irl event without scheduling it and informing people properly and as a result a bunch of fans

56:34.560 --> 56:40.000
were left on the hook when matt and ryan didn't know to show up he went into how ryan misgenders

56:40.000 --> 56:48.240
his trans partner in private ryan mcgee openly misgenders a trans person in his life that he

56:48.240 --> 57:01.040
cares very much about behind their back i can't tell you how many times i would hear ryan mcgee

57:01.040 --> 57:11.760
say i'm gonna go home to my boyfriend or i'm gonna go fuck this guy matt would make the jokes too

57:11.760 --> 57:21.200
this this partner is such a sweet person i didn't know them well i don't think they

57:21.200 --> 57:29.520
ever liked me um so we just weren't ever close but it broke my fucking heart because i would

57:29.520 --> 57:36.640
see this person and i knew they didn't know that the person that they like literally their fucking

57:36.640 --> 57:50.000
partner is misgendering them all the fucking time and it sorry it literally like it makes me so

57:50.000 --> 57:58.080
fucking mad to see just blatant transphobia come from those fuckers and then they turn around and

57:58.080 --> 58:03.840
are like we are so accepting of things oh guess what that was actually fake latin had to walk it

58:03.840 --> 58:09.040
back on twitter he then brings up ryan sexting fans and like at this point latin stream devolves

58:09.040 --> 58:16.400
into character assassination i believe that super mega is a toxic business that represents

58:19.360 --> 58:25.680
nothing good nothing positive and the foundation that that channel was built on is is fucking

58:25.680 --> 58:30.400
wise he says nothing of relevance from here on out he's just rambling and repeating points and

58:30.400 --> 58:35.200
occasionally crying and shilling his upcoming show i have a show that i'm working on that

58:35.200 --> 58:45.920
i'm going to release soon called only bricks where i interview only fans models in weird situations

58:45.920 --> 58:52.480
and i let them pick a fun lego set and i want to give these people who get so much hate online

58:52.480 --> 58:58.160
because dumbass n-cells say they're hot girls that have no personality or they just say that

58:58.160 --> 59:02.880
they're people that just rely on their looks i think that's such a dumb idea and i want to

59:02.880 --> 59:09.280
give these people the opportunity to truly prove who they are and basically doing anything he can

59:09.280 --> 59:13.360
to pad out the stream so the donations keep rolling in wait is there an ad

59:16.800 --> 59:23.040
i'm sorry everyone i wish i could turn that off but really do i don't want to try to seem like

59:23.040 --> 59:28.400
i'm trying to monetize anything you can literally shut off twitch ads in the dashboard dude the only

59:28.400 --> 59:33.600
legitimate parts of latin story is that matt and ryan are still behaving like super mega is a frat

59:33.600 --> 59:38.160
house full of their friends rather than them both being 30 years old running a real business it

59:38.160 --> 59:42.320
sounds like there was some weird sexual harassment shit at the super mega house not exploitative or

59:42.320 --> 59:46.640
pleasurable or anything like that just prank shit that went too far and is not appropriate in a

59:46.640 --> 59:50.800
business setting they clearly need to grow up these aren't high school friends they're employees

59:50.800 --> 59:54.880
but everything else latin talks about is irrelevant he's simply dragging everything

59:54.880 --> 59:59.280
out for the camera in order to garner sympathy earn some money and get his next project off the

59:59.280 --> 01:00:04.160
ground eventually matt and ryan from super mega responded to everything on the super mega channel

01:00:04.160 --> 01:00:08.640
they each did their own vlog and have basically peaced out from the internet since in ryan's vlog

01:00:08.640 --> 01:00:13.200
he immediately sells dawn up the river but does so by appealing to lex's victimhood on the night of

01:00:13.200 --> 01:00:20.160
may 25th lex reached out to me through text they wanted to talk about something i said okay she

01:00:20.160 --> 01:00:27.520
called i answered and she began to confide in me about a sexual assault that she experienced

01:00:28.240 --> 01:00:34.640
by our mutual friend don who was our channel artist at the time i took these allegations

01:00:34.640 --> 01:00:39.120
seriously and expressed my support for lex and i asked her permission to talk to don about the

01:00:39.120 --> 01:00:45.440
sexual assault directly unfortunately my words ended up ringing hollow as matt and i continuously

01:00:45.440 --> 01:00:56.640
tiptoed around the subject we didn't expect this from don um nobody uh expects their friend to do

01:00:56.640 --> 01:01:01.360
something this serious to another friend even though lex's whole thing was entirely about

01:01:01.360 --> 01:01:05.040
how super mega apparently fucked up her life by kicking her out and only a little bit about don

01:01:05.040 --> 01:01:08.880
at the start ryan completely sides with lex because he's a progressive and believe all women

01:01:08.880 --> 01:01:13.040
he throws don under the bus and then he throws himself under the bus we selfishly waited until

01:01:13.040 --> 01:01:18.880
we felt comfortable to have this discussion with don instead of having the victims back immediately

01:01:18.880 --> 01:01:24.560
there's no excusing the lack of tack that was used to handle this um lex should have felt safe and i

01:01:24.560 --> 01:01:32.880
am sorry to lex for making them feel like they weren't hurt at that time i was spineless could

01:01:32.880 --> 01:01:38.880
have been handled so much better and should have been handled so much better especially since

01:01:39.440 --> 01:01:45.840
lex was the one who trusted us with her story and her trauma there's no excusing the way matt

01:01:45.840 --> 01:01:53.920
and i handled that situation if we were to do it right we would have from the get-go fired

01:01:53.920 --> 01:01:58.800
down immediately going so far as to imply that he's quitting super mega i have obviously been

01:01:58.800 --> 01:02:05.280
irresponsible with the platform i was given so as it stands i don't deserve one since this is my

01:02:05.280 --> 01:02:10.800
final video this next topic is really the only thing i care to defend myself on this entire vlog

01:02:10.800 --> 01:02:14.880
comes across as like i said at the start a calculated utilitarian move in order to save

01:02:14.880 --> 01:02:18.880
super mega from the wrath of their young progressive audience ryan then goes after

01:02:18.880 --> 01:02:23.520
latent for daring to utter daniel's name in a stream to address these allegations head on about

01:02:23.520 --> 01:02:29.120
me making fun of the suicide of my best friend i just want to state that it's just untrue the

01:02:29.120 --> 01:02:34.240
person making these claims never knew daniel they definitely were not a part of the group that

01:02:34.240 --> 01:02:43.040
experienced the trauma of losing him and i think honestly it is disrespectful to bring him up

01:02:43.760 --> 01:02:50.560
as a weapon i felt like he was just brought into the situation for drama's sake to try to

01:02:51.360 --> 01:03:00.880
hurt me or matt or hurt our image i have done enough shit to tarnish my image but i will not

01:03:00.880 --> 01:03:10.240
stand by and let someone talk lies about the way i talked or treated my trauma in regards to daniel

01:03:10.240 --> 01:03:16.160
the sole focus of all of this should have been about the support that lex needed you know how

01:03:16.160 --> 01:03:20.880
it is right kneel for the woman take down the gay guy normal stuff in progville the truth is even if

01:03:20.880 --> 01:03:26.000
we assume lex's sexual assault claim is true latin is clearly just dog piling it happens every single

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:29.760
time a big canceling attempt goes down people see their chance and jump on it madison's doing it

01:03:29.760 --> 01:03:33.200
right now at alliance tech tips something i'll likely cover in a future video there's one last

01:03:33.200 --> 01:03:36.800
thing to check out before we move over to matt's video which is about five times as long as ryan's

01:03:36.800 --> 01:03:43.360
i had inappropriate communications with fans while in a long-term committed relationship while

01:03:43.360 --> 01:03:48.880
technically these actions are between two consenting adults it truly is pathetic and

01:03:48.880 --> 01:03:53.280
there's no excuse for it it's clear that instead of being responsible with the super mega brand i

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:59.520
abused my position and my power for selfish self-indulgence listen if you're a cute girl

01:03:59.520 --> 01:04:04.800
i will 100 exploit my tiny youtube stardom to get into your pants you can absolutely get ahead

01:04:04.800 --> 01:04:08.880
with me by sending me your nudes i will totally abuse my position i don't give a fuck okay let's

01:04:08.880 --> 01:04:13.040
move on to matt's video he immediately tells the breakup story from his point of view where lex

01:04:13.040 --> 01:04:18.400
dumped don and then he flew don out to la to be a good friend so on may 19 2022 after returning home

01:04:18.400 --> 01:04:23.520
from creator clash i got a call from don uh in which he was crying saying that him and lex had

01:04:23.520 --> 01:04:28.080
just broken up he told me he was essentially stuck in florida because he's from germany and he had no

01:04:28.080 --> 01:04:33.200
money and didn't know what to do and at this time i didn't know any specifics of what had happened

01:04:33.200 --> 01:04:38.960
with the breakup he mentioned to me that they had been distant and then ended up just breaking up

01:04:38.960 --> 01:04:45.680
that was the extent of my knowledge on the split at the time feeling bad for don i uh offered to

01:04:45.680 --> 01:04:50.880
get him a one-way plane ticket to la to come crash at my place until he could find a way to get back

01:04:50.880 --> 01:04:56.640
to germany he took me up on the offer and on may 23rd he flew out to la when don arrived he cried

01:04:56.640 --> 01:05:01.920
to me about how heartbroken he was and the whole time i was none the wiser on what had actually

01:05:01.920 --> 01:05:07.280
taken place between him and lex and if i had known i would not have invited him out to la to stay

01:05:07.280 --> 01:05:11.760
with me i would not have housed him i don't remember exactly but i think rav was the one who

01:05:11.760 --> 01:05:17.840
told me initially uh on my balcony one night and he told me that don had sexually assaulted lex

01:05:17.840 --> 01:05:24.720
this was something that i did not expect from don and uh truth be told i had a bit of a hard time

01:05:24.720 --> 01:05:31.680
accepting it i soon asked don about this um and what he told me was he chalked it up to basically

01:05:31.680 --> 01:05:37.520
a misunderstanding in the bedroom at this time i did not grasp how serious the situation was

01:05:37.520 --> 01:05:43.120
and obviously he did not either listen to that dude matt is acting like it's a failing that he

01:05:43.120 --> 01:05:47.200
didn't immediately believe lex without proof and he had questions on whether or not his friend was

01:05:47.200 --> 01:05:51.840
capable of committing sexual assault when that's a completely normal impulse matt takes the same

01:05:51.840 --> 01:05:56.480
stance that ryan does even though lex is trying to destroy super mega he's supporting her against

01:05:56.480 --> 01:06:01.440
don matt even admits that he did bring up his business in the context of the don sexual assault

01:06:01.440 --> 01:06:05.680
allegations and says that he shouldn't have done that i told lex that ryan and i fully supported

01:06:05.680 --> 01:06:10.720
her that we believed her 100 and that we would be there for her to be honest i was terrified

01:06:10.720 --> 01:06:16.080
of misstepping in this situation due to its sensitive nature and how close it was to home

01:06:16.080 --> 01:06:22.800
i was not sure how to navigate it this was all new territory to me and i asked her a really stupid

01:06:22.800 --> 01:06:27.200
question because of that i asked lex what she wanted me and ryan to do about the situation

01:06:27.200 --> 01:06:32.480
which was an absolutely dumb ass thing to ask i meant it from a place of we want to help and we

01:06:32.480 --> 01:06:37.200
will do whatever it is you want us to do to make the situation better i now see that obviously came

01:06:37.200 --> 01:06:42.560
across as me putting the responsibility of the situation back on the victim and i feel terrible

01:06:42.640 --> 01:06:47.280
about that my intention was to be helpful and i went about it very poorly in lex's statement

01:06:47.280 --> 01:06:54.400
she said that i brought up technicalities over don's employment as well as me saying something

01:06:54.400 --> 01:06:59.840
along the lines of how much it would suck for super mega if this got out and that super mega

01:06:59.840 --> 01:07:04.240
was my magnum opus and i didn't want anything to ruin that over the course of the phone call we did

01:07:04.240 --> 01:07:09.360
discuss don's role with super mega and while i don't recall making any of those specific comments

01:07:09.360 --> 01:07:14.080
i do know i brought up our business and how don's actions might affect that that was completely

01:07:14.080 --> 01:07:19.040
wrong of me to do i never should have brought up anything as trivial as that while lex was telling

01:07:19.040 --> 01:07:24.000
me something very difficult i was kind of freaking out and i was thinking out loud it should not have

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:29.200
even been on my mind uh and that was selfish of me what i should have done was just listened

01:07:29.200 --> 01:07:34.800
and offered support and not questioned anything yeah that is shit of him but look at this double

01:07:34.800 --> 01:07:39.920
standard lex wants every irrational action explained by trauma or fight or flan or

01:07:39.920 --> 01:07:44.560
whatever the fuck but matt makes one knee-jerk misstep and he should be destroyed yeah he

01:07:44.560 --> 01:07:49.440
shouldn't have done it but isn't lex's entire story built on the idea that people do irrational

01:07:49.440 --> 01:07:53.520
things in the heat of the moment and we should excuse them for it matt buddy just claim you

01:07:53.520 --> 01:07:57.680
were sexually assaulted it apparently explains everything away the first half of matt's video

01:07:57.680 --> 01:08:01.840
is just him recontextualizing all the various stories that lex gave about her interactions

01:08:01.840 --> 01:08:06.400
with dom to paint dom as the villain and lex as the victim and he and ryan are so sorry about

01:08:06.400 --> 01:08:11.840
their part in all of it then at the halfway point he says this i also want to address a very large

01:08:11.840 --> 01:08:18.400
chunk of lex's video that was focused on her and rav's time living at our office aka the super

01:08:18.400 --> 01:08:22.160
mega plex did that not sound a little passive aggressive to you like you can't come out and

01:08:22.160 --> 01:08:25.760
shit on lex but he's like yeah bitch we all know you spent most of your video not even talking

01:08:25.760 --> 01:08:30.640
about dom matt knows that the smear is in and he has to reply to it without throwing lex into the

01:08:30.640 --> 01:08:35.040
bus since she's a victimized woman but also while still presenting his own case he does this by

01:08:35.040 --> 01:08:39.840
wording it like there is miscommunication on all sides we're all just so busy etc etc when she was

01:08:39.840 --> 01:08:43.360
saying it was clearly meant to live or there was a secret meaning behind these messages or something

01:08:43.360 --> 01:08:48.960
then matt provides new receipts things that lex didn't show in her two-hour video where lex painted

01:08:48.960 --> 01:08:53.280
their relationship post moving out of the super mega house and back to nashville as being very

01:08:53.280 --> 01:08:57.200
bitter and that she was left homeless and stuck in hostels or whatever they were actually texting

01:08:57.200 --> 01:09:02.720
back and forth and being very friendly all the way through the end of 2022 months after apparently

01:09:02.720 --> 01:09:07.360
lex said she had stopped running with them i thought that after i apologized to her last july

01:09:07.360 --> 01:09:13.920
things had smoothed out and i think you could see why i would think that uh but that communication

01:09:13.920 --> 01:09:20.320
ceased around the time that we fired latin who is a close friend of hers and now it all comes

01:09:20.320 --> 01:09:26.720
together doesn't it lex is just fine with everyone and everything until her friend latin gets fired

01:09:26.800 --> 01:09:32.320
from super mega for his incompetence and only then did these allegations start coming out it seems to

01:09:32.320 --> 01:09:36.960
me like lex and latin put together this quasi manifesto shitting on super mega and front-loaded

01:09:36.960 --> 01:09:41.120
it with lex's reinterpretation of a relationship with don as sexual assault in order to make the

01:09:41.120 --> 01:09:45.600
whole story easier to swallow in the whole whirlwind of lex trying to make everything stick

01:09:45.600 --> 01:09:51.040
she brought up how matt fucked some porn star not only did he cheat on his girlfriend and broke up

01:09:51.040 --> 01:09:57.440
with her and then she found out after because jim was living with the new girl uh while she's still

01:09:57.440 --> 01:10:02.800
friends with jim like they're both friends with jim he also takes a break with the new girlfriend

01:10:02.800 --> 01:10:13.600
he's with to uh basically solicit a sex worker girl um that he was into to come live in la and

01:10:13.600 --> 01:10:21.200
move from like across the us before he decided that he wanted to go back to the girlfriend

01:10:21.200 --> 01:10:27.040
that he was just with so if i were him i would probably be reevaluating my life as well the porn

01:10:27.040 --> 01:10:32.000
star in question morgan or morgue pie on social media also came out with her own dumb fuck

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:36.240
allegations about how matt fucked her and ghosted her and how she expected a relationship and how

01:10:36.240 --> 01:10:40.640
awful he is they're not really worth going over because she's just stupid the charge here is we

01:10:40.640 --> 01:10:44.560
had sex and he didn't call me back which man in an age of tinder and hookups that doesn't really

01:10:44.560 --> 01:10:48.880
land anymore let alone with somebody who does fucking porn in any case matt simply admitted it

01:10:48.880 --> 01:10:53.440
he said it was a hookup between his real relationships and then provided texts showing

01:10:53.440 --> 01:10:58.800
that this was the case and morgan knew it in august 2022 when i was single and in between

01:10:58.800 --> 01:11:04.160
relationships i sexted with her for one night and ultimately slept with her for two nights in

01:11:04.160 --> 01:11:10.080
september when she was visiting los angeles during our hookups i explicitly stated to morgan that

01:11:10.080 --> 01:11:15.440
this was a hookup and that i had just gotten out of a relationship and i was not looking for

01:11:15.440 --> 01:11:20.560
anything and this is something she acknowledged i actually brought this up uh more than once

01:11:20.560 --> 01:11:26.640
after she left la to go back home i could tell that she had caught some feelings and i did not

01:11:26.640 --> 01:11:32.480
want to lead her on so i began to kind of distance myself shortly after i also ended up working

01:11:32.480 --> 01:11:36.800
through a rough patch and started dating my current girlfriend and i talked to morgan even

01:11:36.800 --> 01:11:42.320
less after this we stopped communication i didn't feel like it was appropriate to you know be

01:11:42.320 --> 01:11:48.720
talking to someone who the relationship i had was primarily sexual uh while i had a girlfriend we

01:11:48.720 --> 01:11:53.520
pretty much lost all contact uh after i started dating my current girlfriend and i figured that

01:11:53.520 --> 01:12:00.800
that was normal and that's kind of just what is the typical life cycle of a hookup i was very

01:12:00.800 --> 01:12:08.400
surprised to hear what morgan had to say on stream considering last month in june we had

01:12:08.400 --> 01:12:15.600
a very pleasant conversation uh where we tied up any loose ends and smoothed everything out

01:12:15.600 --> 01:12:19.600
and i'm going to share that conversation morgan reached out to me on june 8th and said hey matt

01:12:19.600 --> 01:12:24.080
hope you're doing well i said hey i've been doing okay been really busy and stressed but i'm pushing

01:12:24.080 --> 01:12:28.560
through have you been she said oh man me too supremely stressed but i'm coming to la this

01:12:28.560 --> 01:12:32.480
month and i'll be doing so much cool shit so i'm excited glad to hear you're pushing through

01:12:32.480 --> 01:12:36.400
i said i'm just kind of exhausted with tor coming up and stuff but i'll be okay i've been doing

01:12:36.400 --> 01:12:40.480
therapy a lot which has been super helpful and glad to hear you're doing cool shit she replies

01:12:40.480 --> 01:12:44.320
with oh i'm so happy to hear therapy has been helping i've had mixed results with that great

01:12:44.320 --> 01:12:48.960
when it actually works out she replies with yeah man i'm excited but yeah just thought i'd check

01:12:48.960 --> 01:12:52.880
up on you because even though things got a little weird i'll always care about you dude hope you

01:12:52.880 --> 01:12:57.840
have a great tour too i respond with i appreciate it and i'm sorry things got a little weird i'm not

01:12:57.840 --> 01:13:01.840
very good at navigating stuff and when i got in a relationship shortly after i wasn't sure how

01:13:01.840 --> 01:13:06.000
to not be awkward about it i care about you too and i don't feel weird at all about things or

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:11.360
about you she said yeah i kind of know what happened lol people talk but cool man i'm glad

01:13:11.360 --> 01:13:16.720
things aren't weird i said same glad it's not weird i feel a lot better now lol she said me too

01:13:16.720 --> 01:13:22.400
i hate loose ends and i said same they bother me so much lol and for clarity i never felt bad or

01:13:22.400 --> 01:13:26.880
negative about you i just didn't know how to not be awkward after a hookup i'm not really a hookup

01:13:26.880 --> 01:13:32.000
person especially since i'm in a relationship now sorry for my awkwardness glad we're all good

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:36.800
morgan replies with yeah i felt a bit sour about it tbh because i'm not really a hookup person

01:13:36.800 --> 01:13:41.840
either loki caught me with some feels and i felt pretty used afterwards but shit happens and that's

01:13:41.840 --> 01:13:46.320
on me so i don't harbor any ill will towards you i mean i didn't expect a relationship or anything

01:13:46.320 --> 01:13:51.360
but yeah lol i responded with i feel ya and i'm sorry for acting in any way that made you feel

01:13:51.360 --> 01:13:55.360
used that was never my intention and i'm just kind of awkward with this stuff i could tell

01:13:55.360 --> 01:13:58.640
a little that you were catching feels and i didn't want to lead you on and hurt you

01:13:58.640 --> 01:14:02.960
morgan said i really appreciate that i'm just a big baby and when i open myself up like that

01:14:02.960 --> 01:14:06.880
to someone it's because i'm really into them contrary to what my profession may lead you to

01:14:06.880 --> 01:14:11.040
think but i'm glad we could talk about this i appreciate you talking about this with me even

01:14:11.040 --> 01:14:15.200
though you aren't obligated to at all i said of course i'm really glad we're talking about it too

01:14:15.200 --> 01:14:20.480
because i didn't like feeling awkward or having a loose end and she said yeah same w i respond with

01:14:20.560 --> 01:14:25.760
a cool sunglasses smiley face and that was the last time we talked so why did morgan jump on

01:14:25.760 --> 01:14:30.080
this bandwagon well maybe because she was one of the first people involved in latin's new show

01:14:30.080 --> 01:14:36.160
morgue pie is someone that i met and didn't need to like me you know like didn't have to

01:14:37.600 --> 01:14:47.120
but especially after all this crazy shit she still was so sweet to me and like wanted to record with

01:14:47.120 --> 01:14:53.600
me and like she liked the idea of my show and so i recorded this insane fucking episode

01:14:54.960 --> 01:15:02.640
of only bricks with morgan and we didn't even get like fucking three percent done everything here

01:15:02.640 --> 01:15:07.360
seems to revolve around latin lex and morgan are his friends helping him out with their femoid

01:15:07.360 --> 01:15:12.640
tears but it really just seems like this is latin's campaign to ruin super mega and matt says as much

01:15:12.640 --> 01:15:18.160
a former employee of super mega named latin stallard has made some very serious accusations

01:15:18.160 --> 01:15:23.760
against me and ryan i did not plan on nor did i want to make a segment of this video based around

01:15:23.760 --> 01:15:29.920
this but after everything latin has said about us publicly i feel that i have no choice but to

01:15:29.920 --> 01:15:36.000
respond and give my side of the story and show receipts we fired latin from working at super mega

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:42.720
in march 2023 and since then he has led a vindictive campaign to cancel us to deplatform

01:15:42.720 --> 01:15:48.080
us to ruin our image basically we were not happy with his performance he had been causing problems

01:15:48.080 --> 01:15:52.400
uh with his mood swings and outbursts at the office as well as a general performance that

01:15:52.400 --> 01:15:57.360
we didn't like we made the difficult decision to let him go even latin's claims that the workplace

01:15:57.360 --> 01:16:02.000
was full of homophobic jokes that he just hated and felt alienated due to ends up being not true

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:07.600
as matt shows off many texts of latin being totally cool with it i find it a little ironic

01:16:07.600 --> 01:16:13.920
that he complained about this considering for example in december we were recording a podcast

01:16:13.920 --> 01:16:20.320
when he came in unannounced and showed us his cock and balls in late 20s uh chuck hey latin

01:16:21.200 --> 01:16:27.760
hey whoa do you see his balls latin you want to come take a seat do you see his balls

01:16:28.720 --> 01:16:33.520
okay hold on i don't think it's appropriate for the podcast matt then shows screenshots from a

01:16:33.520 --> 01:16:38.400
dedicated super mega hate discord where they plan to help latin cancel super mega by using any

01:16:38.400 --> 01:16:42.720
scandal they can get their hands on we just need a piece of gossip it's big enough that their sponsor

01:16:42.720 --> 01:16:46.240
will want to drop super mega well what if he tried to spin something like they covered by

01:16:46.240 --> 01:16:51.120
sexual assault would that do the deed and it worked at least initially super mega went into

01:16:51.120 --> 01:16:55.680
a subscriber death spiral their community subret was an open revolt everyone was disavowing them

01:16:55.680 --> 01:17:00.240
and latin's own bitterness finally won the day at least initially this is a way for latin and

01:17:00.240 --> 01:17:05.040
lex and morgan to try and bolster their careers by destroying larger creators they used to associate

01:17:05.040 --> 01:17:10.160
with it's that simple dude and it all works because in 2023 you can be as shitty of a person

01:17:10.160 --> 01:17:15.200
you want and simply say trauma and it's all excused believe all women guys don't be a rape

01:17:15.200 --> 01:17:20.640
apologist by asking questions rav was also trying to figure out what had gone down and at this point

01:17:20.640 --> 01:17:26.400
i don't think any of us still were taking it as seriously as we should have been and that is

01:17:26.400 --> 01:17:32.880
something that i sincerely regret because we did not take it as seriously right from the jump as

01:17:32.880 --> 01:17:38.800
we should have instead we asked questions and tried to do some detective work and get to the

01:17:38.800 --> 01:17:43.920
bottom of it no no matt no doing detective work is supporting the rape the worst part is that

01:17:43.920 --> 01:17:48.480
don's career is completely in tatters i think he's innocent he's been completely ruined by this this

01:17:48.480 --> 01:17:52.080
was clearly a group of people who want to direct super mega and they decided to destroy don in the

01:17:52.080 --> 01:17:57.040
process because he was an easy tool to use after all don's a fat guy who would ever believe that

01:17:57.040 --> 01:18:01.040
somebody as hot as lex would ever consent to dating him lex's current boyfriend is also a

01:18:01.040 --> 01:18:05.360
fat socialist soy boy she just seems to have a type what happened with super mega listen nick

01:18:05.360 --> 01:18:10.560
made a video about it but all you need to know is that they're bad go to their subreddit there's

01:18:10.560 --> 01:18:17.760
plenty of information google super mega subreddit and go there now look at anything look at the

01:18:17.760 --> 01:18:26.080
first post it's been trending all weekend it's funny how fast everyone turned on super mega

01:18:26.080 --> 01:18:32.720
yeah and i think that goes to show right it's kind of self-fulfilling in a sense you know it

01:18:32.720 --> 01:18:37.840
kind of makes both lex's and latin's claim they don't want drama and they just want to tell their

01:18:37.840 --> 01:18:42.240
stories and empower other victims ring really fucking hollow when they're gloating at the

01:18:42.240 --> 01:18:47.600
super mega subscriber count going below 1 million said socialist soy boy runs a small time crumbtuber

01:18:47.600 --> 01:18:51.840
channel putting out the worst leftist garbage content imaginable in between tweeting about

01:18:51.840 --> 01:18:56.080
how he totally met the super mega guys and they totally use slurs constantly even though matt

01:18:56.080 --> 01:19:01.040
confirmed he doesn't really know this guy shortly after one of latin's best friends who is lex's

01:19:01.040 --> 01:19:08.640
boyfriend uh tried to instigate drama on twitter by lying and saying that he has heard us say the

01:19:08.640 --> 01:19:15.200
n-word multiple times in reality we've only met this individual a handful of times and it's mostly

01:19:15.200 --> 01:19:23.120
been at social events and always accompanied by lex so to think that we would just casually be

01:19:23.120 --> 01:19:29.760
dropping the n-word with a hard r in front of not only someone who's a stranger but also a woman of

01:19:29.760 --> 01:19:35.360
color yeah that makes a lot of sense this entire group of people are just leeches they've only

01:19:35.360 --> 01:19:40.400
temporarily bound themselves together in order to take down super mega in fact latin shit talked

01:19:40.400 --> 01:19:45.120
lex behind her back when she was squatting at the super mega house when these texts came out

01:19:45.120 --> 01:19:49.760
i wonder if lex felt like a fucking retard burning all of her credibility to prop this little shit up

01:19:49.760 --> 01:19:53.680
in any case latin wasn't doing anything in the name of accountability he just wanted to hurt

01:19:53.680 --> 01:20:02.960
super mega i just hope you all believe that like this is not a push for me to try to get clout

01:20:03.760 --> 01:20:09.440
i'm fucking terrified right now i don't buy that he's terrified for one second this is latin's

01:20:09.520 --> 01:20:13.280
ticket to internet fame being the guy who got super mega cancelled and then plugging his new

01:20:13.280 --> 01:20:18.080
show of course it was his plan all along morgan's part of latin's plan was ultimately insignificant

01:20:18.080 --> 01:20:22.480
she simply served to be another source of matt looking bad after all matt and morgan were on good

01:20:22.480 --> 01:20:27.040
terms right up until she started talking to latin following when i had that text conversation with

01:20:27.040 --> 01:20:32.560
morgan and june where we smooth things over morgan began hanging out with our ex-employee

01:20:32.560 --> 01:20:37.520
latin more and i have not heard from her since that conversation until i saw her stream lex's

01:20:37.520 --> 01:20:42.640
story however was the core of their plans her claim was the catalyst for everything not because

01:20:42.640 --> 01:20:46.640
she was actually a victim of dawn i don't buy that for a second they simply pre-faced the whole

01:20:46.640 --> 01:20:51.600
canceling event with the dawn story to make it seem more legitimate lex's actual grievance is

01:20:51.600 --> 01:20:56.640
she feels slighted because her next big career move was moving out to la making connections in

01:20:56.640 --> 01:21:00.800
the creator space and trying to get something going that way that failed because she mooched

01:21:00.800 --> 01:21:06.000
off super mega for months and everyone got tired of her being around as time went on and weeks

01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:12.240
turned into months of them staying at the office we were unsure of their plans and how motivated

01:21:12.240 --> 01:21:17.840
they were to actually find a place to move into there's simply no reason to believe this failed

01:21:17.840 --> 01:21:23.360
me too attempt of dawn in my opinion dawn's the victim his careers and tatters he's lost all of

01:21:23.360 --> 01:21:28.080
his connections there's no proof of anything and it's all real believable because lex is a pretty

01:21:28.080 --> 01:21:33.600
woman and don is an unattractive guy the post me too era that we're currently living in in 2023

01:21:33.600 --> 01:21:39.200
is fucking disgusting furthermore because lex self-id's as a she they non-binary trans person

01:21:39.200 --> 01:21:43.760
she's not a woman and therefore under the laws of me too i am no longer obligated to believe her

01:21:43.760 --> 01:21:49.440
see you later bitch anything and everything was on the table no matter what your race

01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:56.320
or your identity or your your no matter what like you could be made fun of by those guys

01:21:56.320 --> 01:22:03.200
someone who had been with latin and a group of his friends uh told us that he had been flaunting

01:22:03.200 --> 01:22:08.880
that if things ever went south with us he could just easily cancel us he not only propagated

01:22:08.880 --> 01:22:13.600
a lot of the jokes that he claimed to be offended by but he participated in the jokes he even

01:22:13.600 --> 01:22:18.160
encouraged them we always wanted latin to feel comfortable even when we were making jokes we

01:22:18.160 --> 01:22:23.600
never wanted him to feel targeted with any jokes his tone changed completely uh the moment he was

01:22:23.600 --> 01:22:28.960
fired i felt so fucking weak i don't know i'm a i'm a big boy or whatever but like when i got when

01:22:28.960 --> 01:22:35.680
i was like oh i'm non-binary i just woke up and i was like i'm bored i i'm she they now and uh

01:22:35.680 --> 01:22:40.800
and i'm sure that works and then you got a ton more friends you got the crowds you got the eyes

01:22:40.800 --> 01:22:45.760
on you everybody's like wow that's so cool yeah it felt like a lie to me
