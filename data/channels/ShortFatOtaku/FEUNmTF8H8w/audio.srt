00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,040
This video is a treat for me more than anything else, after coming off the heels of the last one.

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:09,920
This is a Let's Player Drama video, guys. So if that kind of nonsense ain't your cup of tea,

3
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:13,520
click off now. Otherwise, let's go down this wild rabbit hole.

4
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:26,480
Intro

5
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:30,320
If you've been watching me for a while, you know exactly how I feel about old YouTubers

6
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:34,960
and Game Grumps and Egoraptor. We don't gotta rehash that again, so here's some quick context.

7
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:39,120
When JonTron and Egoraptor realized they needed an editor for Game Grumps, Jon suggested his

8
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:44,080
high school friend Barry. After Jon left the channel, Barry stayed on, though he also eventually

9
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:48,880
left. He was replaced by Kevin, who had applied for the editor job like a normal job, rather than

10
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:53,520
simply being somebody's friend from before. Kevin eventually moved on to pursue an editing career in

11
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:57,760
Hollywood, stating publicly that he was always more interested in the editing part of the job,

12
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:02,720
rather than the Let's Play part of the job. Kevin was replaced by Matt and Ryan of Supermega.

13
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:06,720
At this point, Supermega wasn't really a big channel. Their initial growth came off the back

14
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:10,720
of the Game Grumps Association. It was a pretty good deal for them. Egoraptor let them record

15
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:16,000
the Supermega episodes in the Game Grumps office and using Game Grumps equipment and game library,

16
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,800
as well as giving them a ton of cross-promotion. Once Supermega became popular in its own right,

17
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:24,960
Matt and Ryan quit the Game Grumps editor job and branched off to do their own thing.

18
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:28,880
These two guys are cut from the same cloth as everybody else in this sphere. Edgy as fuck back

19
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:33,280
during the mid-2010s, which made them appealing and helped them grow, but in 2023 they're hyper

20
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:37,440
progressive, shitting all over anybody who still likes edgy jokes and pulling up the ladder behind

21
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:42,320
them. A classic case of trolls remorse. For example, back during the 2020 Summer of Love,

22
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:45,840
while Egoraptor was waffling over whether or not he should talk about Black Lives Matter

23
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:50,160
with his platform because, well, he is a gaming channel, not a political one, while his fans

24
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:54,240
strung him up for it because everything is political, Supermega immediately jumped right

25
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:59,040
in to chant BLM along with everyone else. Anyway, we're here to talk about, specifically,

26
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:03,280
the Supermega sex pest allegation. Now, I've had my butt burn on topics

27
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:06,880
like this before. I was wrong about the ProJared thing a few years back. He ended up being

28
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:10,960
innocent. I was riding the hype train. It's always a bit cathartic to see a former edgy

29
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:16,080
boy turned progressive get hit with allegations, but he was ultimately innocent. I was wrong to

30
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:19,600
talk about it the way that I did. I even apologized to him, though I don't think he even knows who I

31
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:24,640
am. But the point is, after the ProJared story, I made the decision to not cover shit like this

32
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:28,880
until the hype died down. And, well, it's been a couple weeks. The hype has died down. I know

33
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:33,840
I don't cover stories fast enough, but I like catching everything in one pass if possible.

34
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:38,640
Also, real quick, I'm not going to go into super autistic detail responding to every single claim

35
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:42,880
made in the various videos and streams today. There's hours of stuff to sift through. I'm

36
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:46,640
just going to give you the overview of what went down. If you want somebody listening to and

37
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:52,400
reacting to every single sentence of this drama, Chedlogic is your guy. He's spent like 12 hours

38
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:57,120
on this shit. Okay, enough nonsense. Let's get going. There's an e-girl with a channel named

39
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:03,360
Lex Updog, who posted a two hour long video titled My Experience with Don Derr and Super

40
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:07,680
Mega. Jesus Christ, these allegations are getting longer and longer every single time, aren't they?

41
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:12,160
Remember back when Angry Joe got slapped with a sex pest allegation? Back then, these were like

42
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:15,520
twitlongers that took maybe 10 minutes to read throughout the most. Now we're sitting here

43
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:19,920
watching feature length films about the drama of young California progressives. And it's got that

44
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,840
Zoomer editing too. Like watch this bit.

45
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:54,320
Look at how jittery it is. She's clearly cutting everything down rather than,

46
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:57,520
you know, doing one solid take. Except that crying. Got to leave that in.

47
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:59,600
Okay, okay. Let's listen to the allegation.

48
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:27,120
Like attempting to physically force me to give him oral. And the only reason why it didn't work

49
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:33,760
was because I like physically like pushed him away multiple times. When you're in a long

50
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:38,480
distance relationship with someone, you have to get to know someone. Like I feel like I'm a pretty

51
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:45,840
direct person. And aside from what the situation has like turned me into, I guess, but I feel like

52
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:50,800
when this happened, I was like, especially this particular situation, I was like,

53
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:56,160
no, I don't want to. I don't want to do this. And he kept telling me like, just do it. And

54
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:02,560
like multiple times while he was trying to force my head down. And he's like way bigger than me.

55
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:09,840
I don't know. It was, I was really freaked out after that. So eventually he let me go. But I

56
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:14,960
just kind of shut down and just went with like whatever else he wanted that night. And like for

57
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:20,320
the rest of the trip, I didn't know what to do in that situation. So it sounds like Lex had an

58
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:24,960
online only relationship for several years with Don who's a German and the artist for the super

59
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:29,760
mega channel. They finally met up in real life at Matt's house as she was also friends with Matt and

60
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:34,080
Ryan, the super mega duo, and he was in America. Their first night together, she's claiming he

61
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:38,080
tried to force her to do oral. She's kind of ambiguous on whether or not he successfully

62
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:41,200
forced her to do it, but he was rough and did something that she didn't like and that sexual

63
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:45,680
assault. Okay. Understood. Before we get in too deep to the schizo ramble, here's what I think

64
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:51,040
the wider context and timeline is since this video is all over the place. Super mega is in LA. Lex

65
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:55,040
is in Nashville. Don's in Germany trying to come to the States full time to work for super mega.

66
00:05:55,040 --> 00:06:00,160
In November of 2021, Don and Lex are both visiting the super mega house. And that's when the alleged

67
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:04,480
sexual assault took place. Despite this, they continue to associate and remain in a relationship

68
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:09,760
until May of 2022. At that point, the super mega guys, Matt and Ryan, along with Lex and Don attend

69
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:14,560
creator clash in Tampa, where they share an Airbnb. It's during this trip that Lex ends the

70
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:18,640
relationship with Don. Let's hear about Don's description of that night's events, because after

71
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:22,560
this went viral, he wrote up his side of their relationship on Twitter. I want to start this off

72
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:27,440
by apologizing to Lex for any trauma she may feel regarding our past relationship and to anyone just

73
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:31,280
finding out about this who feels they were being lied to or kept in the dark. In regards to what

74
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:36,000
happened during November 2021, this is my side as to what happened. Lex and I were invited over by

75
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Matt to stay over at his place for a week. We had been intimate since day one, but on the third

76
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,560
night, I asked her for oral. She at first said no because she had a cold sore. Later, I asked her

77
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:49,120
again and she said yes, but to be careful not to be too rough. During the act, I had pushed down on

78
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:54,000
her head, after which she recoiled and told me I was being too rough. I then profusely apologized

79
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:59,200
and we ended up watching TV and going to bed after. I just kind of shut down and just went with

80
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:03,120
like whatever else he wanted that night. Things were normal for the rest of the week until the

81
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:06,800
trip was over and we went back home. During this time, I was under no impression that

82
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:10,720
anything traumatizing had occurred. However, I realize now this is extremely upsetting for her.

83
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:15,680
So to me, so far, calling this sexual assault isn't accurate. He clearly went too far,

84
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:18,720
but he stopped when she objected. He apologized and they were both good.

85
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:22,400
Anybody who's been in a relationship knows this is kind of common, where one person accidentally

86
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:25,680
does something the other person doesn't like. There's no intention to hurt anybody there.

87
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:30,240
They just stop and deal with it like adults. This is normal behavior. Awkward sexual experiences

88
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:34,080
aren't assault. They don't need to be policed or brought to light in public. They're simply a part

89
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:39,680
of having sex. Lex goes over what Dawn acted like after she informed him, making light of his

90
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:45,200
reaction, calling it performative. The way I told him was basically, I was basically like,

91
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:51,040
hey, do you remember November when we first hung out? And he was like, yeah. I basically

92
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:57,200
asked him questions that necessitated him saying yes or no to because I wanted it to be easy for

93
00:07:57,200 --> 00:08:02,720
me and I wanted it to be easy for him because I didn't want it to take too long. I didn't think

94
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:08,240
it needed to for me to tell him the way I was going to tell him. So I said, um, you remember

95
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:14,640
the first night, um, when you were like pushing my head down and I was telling you no, yes,

96
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:19,600
he says basically, um, he like didn't dispute anything that I said. He was just saying yes.

97
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:24,720
And I was like, you know, that's sexual assault, right? Like you can't do that to people. Like

98
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:29,120
that wasn't cool that you did that to me. I I've been like, really like messed up that you did

99
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:34,560
that. I like have to like get better from this. This is something that I'm like having to recover

100
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:40,640
from because it's making me not well, like basically explained to him all, but like a baby

101
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:45,600
that sexual assault is bad. And that, that what he did was that, and that you can't do it because

102
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:50,960
all it takes, like all it would have taken is for me to have been like, no, I don't want to.

103
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:57,040
And for him to stop, but he didn't nonetheless. So I say all this and he says, so does that mean

104
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:03,920
you're breaking up with me? And I was like, what? Yeah. To me, it was like, yeah, no. And that out

105
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:09,520
of everything I said was both the shortest response I had to say, or like the shortest thing

106
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:14,480
I had to say to him. And the most devastating he we're on the sidewalk, like we're walking

107
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:19,440
and I'm like, yeah, yeah, no, I don't want to, no, I don't want to be with you. And he stops

108
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:25,760
directly under the streetlight and does this for like a minute in front of me. I don't know.

109
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:30,400
It felt super formative. Now remember all of these people are super progressive, super woke,

110
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:35,120
including Don. Imagine it from his point of view, if he genuinely believed in progressive values,

111
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:39,360
he's being told that his girlfriend is dumping him and that he unknowingly committed sexual assault

112
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:44,400
on her. This is how a person with those values would react. This is realistic to me. It's funny

113
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:48,720
that Lex assumes that Don's reaction is performative when even her miming it is more

114
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:52,800
convincing than any of her own reactions in her video. Let's go back to Don's statement.

115
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:57,120
Our relationship seemed to have not changed. We were talking on Discord almost daily and planning

116
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:01,200
future trips together. However, a couple of months later, we met during Creator Clash.

117
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:05,360
During the trip, me and Lex stayed together in an Airbnb and I noticed that she was growing

118
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:09,200
very distant towards me. I asked her about why she was distant and if everything was okay,

119
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:12,720
but I was not given a straight answer. On the final day, she finally told me why she was so

120
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:17,120
troubled. She told me I was too rough with her last time and it reminded her of her ex's behavior.

121
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:20,560
I tried to apologize and we talked a little bit after, but after the conversation had ended,

122
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:24,000
she had broken up with me and I left the Airbnb to stay with other friends.

123
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,240
At this time, I had contacted Matt and told him it had just gone down. Matt had offered to fly

124
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:32,640
me to LA to stay at his place to figure things out. At his house, I explained to him and Ryan

125
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:35,920
what had happened and the details about the November trip and what she had told me after

126
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:39,920
Creator Clash. After that, I stayed over at his place for the next couple of weeks. Later,

127
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:43,600
Matt told me that he had made some arrangements for his friends to sleep over at his place,

128
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:47,920
moving me to stay at their office. A couple of days at the office had passed when Matt called

129
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:51,920
me and said that Lex was on her way to the office. I was given no prior notice that she

130
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:56,240
was going to be there or moving to LA. It was at this time I decided to leave and stay with

131
00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:00,320
other friends in the area. After a week, I had flown back to Germany. I was then contacted by

132
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:04,480
Supermega that they were not going to be using my art anymore. After that, they cut contact with me

133
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:08,400
and I have not heard from them since. Following this, I decided to send Lex another apology via

134
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:12,160
Discord, but I got no reply from her. At this time, I accepted that I was not going to hear

135
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:16,560
back from Lex or Supermega for the foreseeable future. See, this story sounds like Matt is

136
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:20,560
helping out his friend, putting Don up at the Supermega house until he has gone back to Germany.

137
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:25,280
But after Lex shows up in LA, suddenly he's cut off. To me, it sounds like Lex probably convinced

138
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:28,720
Supermega to cut Don loose, and once he was out of the States, they probably figured it was time

139
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:34,480
to sever ties. Lex all but confirms as much in her video. So there was a chunk of time,

140
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:39,200
I want to say around a week after I got there, that I just didn't do that much.

141
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:46,240
That and like mentally recovering from Creator Clash. And as that span of time occurred,

142
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:53,280
every time I'd look on my phone, I'd notice things were going on in LA. Like, why is Don in LA? I

143
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:59,280
thought he was going back to Germany. Turns out, Matt invited Don to stay with him after Creator

144
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:04,320
Clash, after he was done staying in Florida and I think maybe somewhere else. It occurs to me

145
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:11,840
that I'm going to need to talk to more people about the Don thing, what happened with him,

146
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:16,160
to give context to why I don't want to see him. Well, would you look at that,

147
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:20,320
Lex is bedridden back at home due to the trials and tribulations of her drama filled life. She

148
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:23,600
checks her phone and sees that Don went to LA to hang out with Supermega and she's thinking,

149
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:27,040
shit, I got to get to LA and talk to those guys. So they know not to hang out with him anymore.

150
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:31,120
This is unironically despicable behavior. As I said before, Supermega is run by progressives

151
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:34,800
and watched by progressives. So if I had to guess, there was some ruthless utilitarian

152
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:38,880
calculus involved here in the optics of keeping on an artist who is being accused of sexual assault,

153
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:44,240
regardless of the truth of the claims. This is the only claim with possible teeth in Lex's entire

154
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:48,880
two hour video, that initial sexual assault claim from the November 2021 visit to the Supermega

155
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:53,600
house. Every other thing she brings up just isn't relevant. It's like she has a vendetta against

156
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:58,720
Supermega and is using Don's behavior as a way to take them down. So she ropes in every single

157
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:03,680
other complaint she has and tries to make them look worse by attaching them to the sexual assault.

158
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:07,920
Here's some examples. Don wanted to stay in the States to keep working on Supermega. Everyone was

159
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:11,360
friends and they were all cool. So they suggested that he marry Lex to get a green card as an

160
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:15,280
option. Lex reacted in her video as if this was them selling her off or something.

161
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:35,600
to come live in the US. And it had been going on for a bit now. And that day, Don had been asking,

162
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:42,320
he had been talking about it with me. He had been asking Supermega about filing papers to get a

163
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:49,040
green card. And Matt, at least I know Matt, I'm sure Brian too, Supermega in general, had no

164
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:56,880
interest in doing that for him. But they never, up until this point, never told him no straight out.

165
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:02,400
Never was like, yeah, we're not doing that. They would just give reasons why it was really hard or

166
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:10,160
really expensive to do that. So once again, he asked Matt and him and I were walking up the

167
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:15,600
stairs to Matt's living room and Matt responded something along the lines of like, why don't you

168
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:21,760
guys just get married? To which Don seemed like reciprocal to the idea. Like this ain't the Middle

169
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:26,560
East lady. You can just say no. Lex leaked some discord messages from 2022 months after the

170
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:30,800
alleged forced blowjob. And Don is here saying I love you very much. And she's replying with I love

171
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:35,440
you too. This is completely normal relationship stuff. And Lex is trying to spin it like it's

172
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:39,920
evidence of him manipulating her. The story's unreal, man. Lex mentions that she was on the

173
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:44,160
Supermega podcast with Don where she was acting uncomfortable with his presence and then says,

174
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:48,560
go look it up if you want to see it yourself. If you've watched that or listened to that podcast,

175
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:55,760
there's a part in it where Don starts telling a story, context to do with me or something. There

176
00:14:55,760 --> 00:15:01,280
was a sentence where he starts to say something from having known him on and off for like four

177
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:08,400
years. I knew that he was going to say something about us dating. And even though I had wanted that

178
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:15,600
before this trip in November of 2021, I'd asked him multiple times like, do you want to be public

179
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:20,000
about this? Because we had been before. So I just didn't think of it as a big deal. And he

180
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:28,320
didn't want to, would still draw me art, but only send it to me. So I got a really bad feeling when

181
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:33,680
he started to bring it up. Mind you, I hadn't processed what he had done yet at all, really,

182
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:39,840
besides the fact that I knew he did what I told him not to do. And it made me not feel good. So

183
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:44,000
if I knew he was about to announce or like not announce or like casually mentioned that we were

184
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:48,560
dating in a podcast, wouldn't I want him to mention that? Like, like, of course I would,

185
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:56,800
right? But instead I interrupt him. I, I interrupted him and I made him stop. And I,

186
00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:00,880
I told him like, I just made a joke or something. I think I said like, I'm going to kill you.

187
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:07,120
If you are somebody that likes their podcast or have watched it before, give a shit,

188
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:12,800
you can go find it. There's a part where Don just stops talking. And with this context,

189
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:17,360
if you listen back to it, I think it makes sense. I remember being so anxious. I feel like I was

190
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:21,200
having like a mini panic attack or something. I did go look it up only to discover that the

191
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:24,640
podcast had been deleted from the super mega channel. Don't worry though. The internet

192
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:28,640
never forgets. Both of you guys have been staying with me at my, at my house for the,

193
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:33,040
for the last week or so, you know, why, why should we tell everyone?

194
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:39,920
Because I'm going to kill him. Is there a secret? Keep in mind guys, this conversation is after the

195
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:43,360
sexual assault. Does this sound like she's traumatized and doesn't want him to be there?

196
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:47,280
Not to me. In fact, despite her earlier claim that he was being distant and manipulative,

197
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:50,960
it sounds like he wants the relationship to be public and she's the one cutting him off.

198
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:54,080
I don't know why an OnlyFans model might want to keep her relationship a secret though. That's

199
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:58,880
just beyond my understanding. Lex talks about a sexual experience she had when she was underage

200
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:03,440
with a 21 year old man, which doesn't excuse it. It sounds like she won at the time and how that

201
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:09,520
experience massively traumatized her. 10 years ago this year, I had actually called someone out

202
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:14,960
before. I did it a bit over a year after it happened because I also didn't process it,

203
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:22,160
but it was also with an ex-boyfriend. I was 17 and he was 21 and I also told him no the whole

204
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:27,120
time and he still kept going. So it felt like I was like reliving something I'd gone through before.

205
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:31,600
Lex draws parallels between the 21 year old's behavior and Don's. Although she never actually

206
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:36,320
outlines how Don's behavior is abusive, beyond that one awkward experience that Don apologized

207
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:40,880
for, she still ultimately calls him an abuser in her video. Lex talks about somebody in their

208
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:44,960
friend circle named Layton who apparently was doing something with Game Grumps in their merch.

209
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:50,240
I didn't feel comfortable so I called Layton first. I didn't know him nearly as long at all,

210
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:57,760
but I feel like he had gone through or has gone through enough that him and I both talked about

211
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:02,880
that I know he would relate when I told him or like understand and like believe me when I told

212
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:06,240
him. I don't know, I don't really care. It's entirely irrelevant. She probably brought him

213
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:10,880
up because he believed her story unquestioningly. Lex also talks about how after getting to the

214
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:15,440
Super Mega House in LA and Don is finally cast out of the friend group, she begins living there with

215
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:20,320
her friend Rev. They're both trying to get on their feet and find a place to live in LA and Matt and

216
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:24,960
Ryan are graciously putting them up until they can get their own apartment. Lex is ambiguous about how

217
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:28,800
long they stayed at the Super Mega House, but it seems to be quite a while as eventually the guys

218
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:33,120
simply offer to pay the first couple months rent on a new place just to get her out of there. But

219
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:39,840
listen to how she recontextualizes that gift. Matt offered to pay for me to live somewhere,

220
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:45,600
like down payment plus several months, which if you're in LA, if you know anything about the

221
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:51,680
housing market in LA is an exorbitant amount of money. Jim's asleep next to us, just me and him

222
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:56,320
in his living room and he says this. Most freaked out I think I've ever been by him, aside from the

223
00:18:56,320 --> 00:19:02,800
phone call obviously. I immediately said no. At this point, I didn't fully distrust him. I just

224
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:09,200
had a gut feeling that no one gives you that amount of money for no reason without something

225
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:15,520
to gain from it. It felt like a bribe. That's at least like, I don't know, the way he was saying it,

226
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:20,560
that's at least like 10k. And like regardless of how much it means to him or not, I didn't want it.

227
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:27,520
I felt like weirded out that he did that. He was saying this so I could live alone in LA. Like

228
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:35,840
specifically apartment money for me to live alone. It was very weird. I turned him down and you know

229
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:41,520
we ended whatever conversation we were having and I went to sleep. That's right. Rather than taking

230
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:46,320
this as a clear sign she needs to move on, she considers it bribe money for covering up the

231
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:50,960
dawn sexual assault and views it as the super mega crew pushing her to be isolated in LA.

232
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:55,200
The rest of the video documents Lex's travels with Rev to Nevada to Washington State to

233
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:58,800
North California, all the while living for free at the super mega house for months,

234
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:02,560
and Matt and Ryan trying to politely push them into finding their own place to live.

235
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:07,680
Lex characterizes these excursions simultaneously as vacations and work trips because she would

236
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:11,680
shoot a few OnlyFans pics on the road, something that she complained she couldn't do at the super

237
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:15,200
mega house because it's a studio for let's plays not your e-thought stuff.

238
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:18,720
One of the things was that I noticed when we were gone is that we stopped to getting asked

239
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:25,040
as many questions. It was mostly just about where we were so they could know when we would be gone

240
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:31,360
or when we'd be back to be gone fast, right? So and when we were out I would take pictures

241
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:37,120
and those pictures ended up surprisingly popping off and making me the money I was making last

242
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:44,400
summer because I couldn't at the super mega plex do regular work. Like I can't set up a photo

243
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:50,160
photo set station for myself and like take photos and clothes that I wouldn't feel comfortable

244
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:56,400
wearing around the guys at the office for example. So me getting like a desk or making a workspace

245
00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:00,960
just wasn't an option and I didn't know that until after I got there.

246
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:04,480
So she's driving around the west half of America going on trips, seeing her friends,

247
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:08,160
blowing money left and right, tons of frivolous spending by her own admission.

248
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:16,400
Me and Rav at this point had been going to meet realtors however many other days but we were

249
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:21,840
one we didn't have like most of our stuff to actually move in and two we were Ubering

250
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:28,000
everywhere so a lot of the money that could have went to actually securing a place to stay went to

251
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:33,920
getting an Uber to getting Ubers like hundreds of dollars in Ubers just living in LA.

252
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:36,240
Her stuff is apparently getting constantly stolen.

253
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:42,880
Um the day after this conversation takes place we get robbed. I have no photos of that because I

254
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:48,800
as soon as I woke up and saw the car was empty of stuff I just screamed as loud as possible called

255
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:54,320
the cops no reason they could not help and then just cried a bunch and then made a post about it

256
00:21:54,320 --> 00:22:00,720
which apparently was laughed at um by the guys at the office. That day that I got robbed and I

257
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:06,320
post about it no one that I knew in LA messaged me. Her extremely expensive car is constantly

258
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:11,040
breaking down. Didn't even include in those fingers buying the car. I think we spent two

259
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:14,880
days on that trying to find the car and then buying it which I could have spent more time on

260
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:20,160
it because I ended up getting a car that needed a four thousand dollar repair when I got back to LA

261
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:25,520
so I suffered because of having to rush from knowing I was going to be asked instead of them

262
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:31,040
just either giving me a date to leave by or asking me like can you is do you know when you

263
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:36,560
can be gone by instead they would just say you guys on a vacation again and if she's so broke

264
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:41,760
so hard done by why did she buy a fucking jeep if you just need to be getting around LA why not buy

265
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:47,040
a little city car jeeps are expensive basically Lex seems to have tons of money and rather than

266
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:51,120
moving forward with trying to get on her own two feet in LA she's living at the super mega house

267
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:56,160
for free leeching off of her friends and living the high life when matt and ryan become a bit more

268
00:22:56,160 --> 00:23:00,880
insistent that lex moved the fuck out of their office here's how she frames that situation when

269
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:08,640
we get back in town there's a group chat where essentially me rav matt and ryan are all going

270
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:14,880
back and forth and it's basically matt and ryan telling us all the things we did wrong that made

271
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:21,680
them not want us there anymore after both we got kind of kicked out like nicely kicked out and

272
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:27,440
robbed and not contacted by them after their next correspondence is like telling us we were dirty

273
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:33,760
we were dirty the people that would spend hours cleaning up the office from when guys would order

274
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:38,960
every single day often don't throw it away they had a person come by but it's only once a month so

275
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:43,680
you can imagine the mess that gets made between the time and it was getting blamed on us we're

276
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:47,360
still not even at the point where super mega is involved in the drama yet guys dawn's their

277
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:50,560
channel artist he's already been given the boot you think that would be the end of the drama as

278
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:54,720
far as super mega is concerned but here is how lex tries to rope them in it's just we're trying

279
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:59,360
to get our lives together and we've been nothing but generous to y'all during this time i think

280
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:04,320
the idea that there are grievances time and time again with our friendship when we've been helping

281
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:11,120
you whenever we can is confusing it's not a good feeling and overwhelming especially since this

282
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:18,240
year has been nothing but drama since the jump literally nothing to do with me at all or rav

283
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:23,760
i don't care no one's saying that to me no one's saying i know you've dealt with a lot like like

284
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:28,080
they're they're saying they're only bringing it up it's like we've dealt with you like rav was

285
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:33,200
even rav just was like congrats about the bad thing that is good now and when it gets brought

286
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:38,960
up for us it's about like we've been helping you time and time again and there's still grievances

287
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:45,200
time and time again it's only been one grievance it was always the same grievance it was the same

288
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:50,160
thing that no one listened to me for and when i tried to talk about it no one wants to talk about

289
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:56,960
it and now it's a problem and i'm homeless sitting in this creepy weird uh sex trafficking room

290
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:02,240
getting told that like we're annoying basically that like we have too many grievances i got

291
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:07,840
assaulted man could you guys just like care like why'd you switch up what happened to keeping them

292
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:13,120
accountable ryan like this year's been nothing but drama since the jump for you i don't think

293
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:17,840
they relate to anything bad that we've been through i don't have to see don anymore what he

294
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:22,080
did to me i don't have to think about when but when someone is treating me actively different

295
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:30,240
all the time in front of me my only friends in la that i was my only plan of like staying somewhere

296
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:36,000
my only like safe place didn't want to help me said they did nothing but helped me and then

297
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:41,840
gaslit me about it and made me homeless because like sure maybe saying made me homeless was like

298
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:48,240
is like maybe extreme but one how else would you say that two we could have talked literally all

299
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:54,320
we had to do was do this we tried doing it even after and they still didn't want to so how do you

300
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:59,920
get someone to talk to you when they refuse to you just can't you heard that right lex is pinning

301
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:04,000
everything on super mega because the initial assault that awkward sexual encounter with

302
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:08,400
don that apparently was tantamount to super rape that happened at matt's house during a party what

303
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:11,920
the fuck man what do you expect them to do they already fired him and now that they want you to

304
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:15,440
stop partying and spending all your money while living rent-free in their studio and they're

305
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:19,840
getting tired with the whole oh i lost my phone all my laptop got stolen stuff and they want you

306
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:24,800
gone you're blaming them and saying they're not taking the dawn assault story seriously enough

307
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:28,960
in fact the end of this tale is that lex had to move back home because she couldn't make it and

308
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:34,080
she blames that on matt and ryan i had so much stuff i couldn't fit it all in one trip to go

309
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:42,560
so i had to drop off some of it at a storage unit we moved to uh airbnb in hollywood in september

310
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:49,600
and september was the last month i stayed in la until i was finally able to get back home you know

311
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:55,680
what matt did before crater clash this year he texted me how's tennessee as if he's not the reason

312
00:26:55,680 --> 00:27:01,040
i'm there and when i didn't respond he took me off his instagram close friends did not follow

313
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:06,000
me he just like didn't want me to see the stuff he really has to say that's right the reason lex's

314
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:10,880
big move to la failed is because the people she was mooching off of finally kicked her out okay

315
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:15,360
here's that tiny nugget in here that got super mega's audience to turn on them it's when lex

316
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:19,520
claims that matt's response to her alleged sexual assault at the hands of dawn was to say that he

317
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:24,080
didn't want this drama to destroy super mega when someone says like hey your friend assaulted me

318
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:30,960
that friend happens to be a co-worker can we like can i not see him and you say this job is my

319
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:36,560
magnum opus multiple times there's like you just like don't care about people you just like care

320
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:41,840
about yourself like you're like you just don't see people as like real things anymore and definitely

321
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:45,920
is like how i felt to him if true that's obviously pretty shitty to say that he's more worried about

322
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:49,440
these allegations tanking his channel than he is about the allegation that one of his friends

323
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:54,240
sexually assaulted another one of his friends and then lex alleges a second sexual assault

324
00:27:54,240 --> 00:28:02,080
by a different guy and okay so my reference of jim is that this is a silly guy so when he like

325
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:06,960
sits down on the couch next to me and then lays down and stretches out i'm like he's just being

326
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:13,680
silly so i tell him the whole story i tell him everything that happened you know up until then

327
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:18,880
i'm pretty sure i even said about that um don was there at the office and all that and just

328
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:25,360
because he was he came to me asking why i looked upset a lot so of course that's all that's all

329
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:31,840
the reasons when he heard my story he was like man i'm so sorry and then proceed to like start

330
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:37,520
flirting with me like right after i and like this is when i realized because i was doing most of

331
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:42,240
talking that after i was done with the story and he started talking like he started saying flirty

332
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:48,880
things and like he started putting me in a headlock that i was like oh he's drunk and like

333
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:53,920
pretty much right after i realized that he started kissing me um if you've ever seen a picture of jim

334
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:59,920
he's a really tall guy i it was not even in my brain to be like get this guy off of me or like

335
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:06,080
not get this guy off me yes i didn't want to kiss him because to me this guy i am not that close

336
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:11,440
friends with like we are just from the same place and like i thought he wanted to like get to know

337
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:17,440
me better listens to my sexual assault story and then makes out with me like at this rate i'm just

338
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:22,480
kind of stun locked i had no idea what he's doing i don't know if there's even any other people in

339
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:28,000
the place i think there was two other people i think matt and rav were still there so he like

340
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:33,360
gets up at some point after like putting me in a choke hold a few more times and kissing he only

341
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:37,120
kissed me a couple times but he put me in a choke hold for a while and it was very uncomfortable

342
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:42,160
he like gets up and then goes to the office and he's like come here i don't even remember

343
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:47,600
thinking anything i was literally just like confused and he because when he said that he was

344
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:54,960
in the office but he was in the closet and when i came over to him because i was just fucking i was

345
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:59,520
like why the my in my head i'm thinking why is this guy just went to the office closet like the

346
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:04,080
office where like everybody has their computers and there's like a coat closet and you just go

347
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:09,280
in there and stand in the doorway and give me a kiss again like i didn't even have like a

348
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:14,400
reaction i just didn't know what the fuck that was and then after that i was like do you like

349
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:19,760
me or something because i genuinely just so like it came out of nowhere like i said i just told him

350
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:26,000
about being assaulted and he does this and his answer is i think you're cute is so fucking weird

351
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:29,520
okay okay he's drunk you didn't realize it he's putting the moves on you he kisses you you don't

352
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:34,480
want it i got it the issue is when he moves from the living room to the back room and then beckons

353
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:38,880
you over you know what he's thinking after the kiss you're not retarded if you weren't into it

354
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:44,160
why did you go over there with him at some point you can't blame other people for your actions

355
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:49,600
saying shit like my self-esteem was so poor i just do whatever the men around me want doesn't make it

356
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:54,640
their fault it is your responsibility to assert your own boundaries and manage your own weaknesses

357
00:30:54,640 --> 00:31:01,520
like listen to her wording here he had essentially used me for nudes i had a not

358
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:08,640
safe for work patreon and he used to sub to it when we weren't dating anymore and so i kept like

359
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:14,080
a boundary with him over it because i was mad at him not necessarily mad at him but i you know he

360
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:19,280
was my ex i didn't want to talk to him and gradually he like pushed that boundary over

361
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:26,320
he like unsubbed from my patreon at one point when we were talking normally enough and he like

362
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:34,160
would message me and ask me if it would be okay if i would send him like the files from the patreon

363
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:39,120
and i would be like you mean like the old ones that you're subbed to and he was like no like new

364
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:44,720
ones or like all of them i didn't want to but my boundaries were so poor i said yeah anyway like

365
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:49,920
at this point we talked enough that i thought he liked me so i was trying not to assume poorly of

366
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:55,360
him uh because i just genuinely didn't think he would do that and then he did so he was like

367
00:31:55,360 --> 00:32:00,480
letting me leak my own nudes to him he was letting me leak my own nudes to him like he has

368
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:06,240
control over whether or not you allow this no you did this he asked you you complied it might have

369
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:10,800
been shitty of him to ask that doesn't mean that he's at fault for your compliance lex ultimately

370
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:17,120
blames this on some new quasi-therapeutic bullshit called flight or fawn you know how there's fight

371
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:23,200
flight or fawn i think i did fawn i'm looking this up i don't want to fuck this up fawn people

372
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:28,560
pleaser lack of identity no boundaries overwhelmed codependent yep flight or fight we all know well

373
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:32,480
enough it refers to two psychological knee-jerk responses to a threat you run away or you fight

374
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:38,720
back well modern therapy speak has led to flight or fawn taking its place where people like lex

375
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:42,880
knee-jerk to either running away or cuddling up to their abusers in an attempt to minimize the

376
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:47,200
abuse there's probably some psychological basis for this but i'm willing to bet this became a

377
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:51,760
thing solely because some middle-aged hipster therapist wanted a way to tell her neurotic

378
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:55,760
sexually dysfunctional female clients that they're not at fault for any bad decisions they make in

379
00:32:55,760 --> 00:33:00,560
their lives these people are not mature enough to engage in sexual activity i know they're legally

380
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:05,040
mature enough and physically sure but mentally lex seems to be about 12 years old you don't

381
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:09,520
innocently walk into a side room with a drunk guy after making out without any expectation

382
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:13,920
of what's going to happen next unless you're either extremely dishonest or extremely immature

383
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:18,480
every time she talks about an event it's never her fault a man must have mind fucked her and if she

384
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:22,080
agreed to do it it wasn't really her the tragedies of life just keep coming at her from all directions

385
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:26,080
like they do for all of us and you can't expect her to stop vacationing and stop mooching when her

386
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:30,880
dog died and her car breaks down or her phone gets stolen she genuinely sounds like a child i know

387
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:35,680
that victims of legitimate sexual assault or rape or abuse or whatever can often make bad decisions

388
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:39,760
in the moment that if they weren't emotionally compromised they wouldn't make but we're talking

389
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:44,800
about months and months and years of interactions where she just keeps coming back keeps doing the

390
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:49,200
same stuff and it doesn't square up with me that's not proof but my gut tells me this is all trumped

391
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:52,960
up i don't buy the whole oh it takes time to process the trauma thing in this case not with

392
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:58,560
that awkward dawn experience anyway i mean it is entirely possible that lex is just massively fucked

393
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:02,560
up from that sexual experience with a 21 year old when she was a teenager it's also entirely

394
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:06,880
possible she is throwing everything possible at the wall in order to tie super mega to the

395
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:11,280
awkward sexual experience she had with don that she has retroactively defined as a sexual assault

396
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:16,400
despite continuing the relationship with him for months as a way to cancel super mega as revenge

397
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:21,440
for her big career leap of moving to la failing because they wouldn't let her mooch off of them

398
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:26,240
anymore and kicked her free-loading ass out of the super mega house frankly it's probably both

399
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:30,000
everything in lex's video feels like a vindictive ex-girlfriend bringing up all the things that her

400
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:33,520
former boyfriend did that she didn't like and now that they've broken up it's time to air all the

401
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:38,160
dirty laundry and she's doing it under the cover of an assault or abuse allegation feels very jonah

402
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:44,240
hill all over again you know in lex's entire video the only thing that matters is did don actually

403
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:49,200
commit the assault everything else is just window dressing anyway yeah lex's attempt to make it to

404
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:53,920
the big city finally ends with her after returning from a seattle trip with rev staying at a hostel

405
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:58,480
in santa monica that she describes as sex trafficker giga rape central which she blames

406
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:04,240
super mega for as they won't let her stay with them anymore so after we go to seattle get robbed

407
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:11,360
in portland the stuff we get robbed of laptop ipad work clothes makeup toiletries i'm a model and an

408
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:18,080
artist those are all the things that i need to make money in the world so at that point priority

409
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:23,120
number one was no longer finding a place to live but rebuying those things so i can make the money

410
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:29,200
to get a place to live at this point we just had drove back into town and we had nowhere to stay

411
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:35,520
trying to save all of our money to rebuy our stuff asap so since i have a jeep we just sleep in the

412
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:44,160
car i go to santa monica malibu area in between there and just go park by the ocean um because

413
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:52,640
it's free the first place we stayed outside of the plex was like some rinky dink hotel in

414
00:35:52,640 --> 00:36:00,560
pasadena it was like obviously like used for sex trafficking like it was a giant master bedroom

415
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:06,400
with a hot tub and and it had a corded phone with the cable cut she eventually has to go back to

416
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:10,320
nashville and she blames the power dynamics of super mega being a large youtube channel and

417
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:14,000
white males and all the rest of it as to why her career didn't take off and she couldn't hack it

418
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:19,440
in la the way these guys like do group chats is they all go in the office together and say and

419
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:25,920
like play football and like make a plan and like who's doing good cop bad cop ass shit very

420
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:31,520
manipulative but how else do you think they would have had jim message me with matt in there they

421
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:36,480
all work together why does matt need to be in there except for a power dynamic like they know

422
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:41,440
what they're doing here's the final spin that she pulls in the story i've been holding on to this

423
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:47,120
weight for over a year for no reason what loyalty do these people have to me that i need to be like

424
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:51,680
i need to protect them what did they do for me they let me stay at their place and then made me

425
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:56,480
feel weird about it after they were like hey your assaulter's gonna be here when i got there like

426
00:36:56,480 --> 00:37:01,040
i don't know they make and then they word stuff like i have to feel like i owe them something

427
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:05,040
i don't owe them anything they weren't charging you rent they said i could stay there you know

428
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:09,520
if he didn't like me there he could have done a lot of different things he could just opened his

429
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:15,120
mouth and talked to me that's what adults do contrary to popular belief adults communicate

430
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:21,520
and uh are mature and don't just leave everything to text and their employees and act like that's

431
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:28,160
normal and gaslight people about it and gaslight people about like being upset about your reaction

432
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:33,760
to assault that's right dawn's a rapist super mega fired him not for her sake but to cover it up and

433
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:37,840
save their own skin and lex is the victim because she can no longer stay with them free of charge

434
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:43,760
but before she finishes up lex drops this fucking bombshell i don't think they relate to anything

435
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:50,640
bad that we've been through and the one thing they could which was rav's uh partner attempting to

436
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:56,560
like take themselves was daniel their friend daniel matt's like at least twice in front of me

437
00:37:57,360 --> 00:38:02,880
separate times we'll hang out with him has called daniel a coward so no they don't care about

438
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:08,880
suicide they don't give a shit about suicide they only give a shit about themselves and who

439
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:13,760
they can make jokes of that are under them that they can get away with for those of you who don't

440
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:18,640
know daniel was the irl friend of matt and ryan the three of them were pals before youtube before

441
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:23,360
super mega they ran the youtube channel syndigo from 2012 until 2015 creating some really funny

442
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:28,320
videos the channel ended when daniel killed himself in 2015 unlike super mega which got

443
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:32,240
big due to the game grumps connection syndigo blew up because the three of them genuinely worked

444
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:37,280
well together and they consistently made good viral content it's not an exaggeration to say

445
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:41,280
that matt and ryan may never have recovered their careers after the loss of daniel without the

446
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:46,080
exposure of game grumps after daniel's suicide matt and ryan stopped updating the syndigo channel

447
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:49,760
after posting a video discussing what happened in a tribute to daniel and then went on to reboot

448
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:54,000
their youtube careers with the super mega channel i've seen long-time viewers of matt and ryan

449
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:58,240
remark that their humor on super mega is nowhere near as good as their humor on syndigo i'm

450
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:02,080
presuming partially because daniel was an integral component of their dynamic and partially because

451
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:06,960
daniel's suicide radically changed matt and ryan's personalities for lex to bring daniel up and make

452
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:11,440
the claim that matt actually didn't give a shit about him that is the ultimate low blow that is

453
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:15,840
the moment that it's confirmed she truly is a heartless bitch way earlier in the video in one

454
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:20,320
of lex's side stories i mentioned a guy named latin and his weird dealings with game grumps merch

455
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:24,880
well you know how a canceling event goes right when lex's story went viral everybody who ever

456
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:28,640
had a beef with super mega came out of the woodwork to pile on and one of them was latin

457
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:34,160
this living broccoli patch of a zoomer all right let's see what he's got to say i found super mega

458
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:41,280
in college i was three weeks older than matt i was so inspired by the stupid shit that these boys were

459
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:50,880
doing and i felt like i don't know like i was inspired my entire career got started in 2017

460
00:39:51,520 --> 00:40:00,080
by h3 h3 and that all i've ever wanted to do is youtube make making content making clothing making

461
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:05,440
like drawing like producing videos doing content has been the only thing i've ever wanted to do

462
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:13,200
and super mega was the first channel that i fully interacted with in person that like

463
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:18,560
wanted to put me in things dude why are you fucking crying right off the bat you just started

464
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:22,320
the stream what the fuck man are you this week look at his chat room it's full of simps i had

465
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:25,840
to pull this from chud's video because latin's taking his vod down look at all the mouth

466
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:30,160
breathers they're just here to enjoy the spectacle of somebody getting ruined over drama that's it

467
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:34,000
as for latin himself it sounds like he really idolized super mega he really wanted to be a

468
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:37,840
youtuber himself and he considered working for them to be a real opportunity which is apparently

469
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:42,800
why he's crying so much latin's story is just as meandering as lex's where he relitigates every

470
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:46,240
single thing that ever went wrong in his life presumably as a way to garner sympathy from

471
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:50,800
the audience and make him seem less responsible for his actions a lot of it is gay kid bullied

472
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:54,400
in high school for being gay kind of stuff and fair enough that can be pretty rough but here's

473
00:40:54,400 --> 00:41:00,320
the actual meat of his allegation also by the way you guys when matt and ryan fired me um they

474
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:05,200
offered me two months severance in exchange for a contract to never talk about them

475
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:14,480
and because i'm an artist and i live in la and i need fucking money i signed the goddamn contract

476
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:23,760
and it was like all right there i go like i just you guys now know in perpetuity that i can't say

477
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:27,520
it's the golden like it's it's called a non-disparagement it means that if you can't

478
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:34,160
say anything nice about them you can't say anything at all and i am so fucking terrified

479
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:40,640
that these guys are gonna sue me because i can't afford to legally represent myself and that's why

480
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:45,120
and that's why i've been so fucking scared to talk about these guys holy shit dude are you

481
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:50,480
actually admitting on stream that you're breaking your fucking nda with super mega they handed latin

482
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:54,400
a big sack of money with the understanding that he would not do exactly what he's doing right now

483
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:59,200
which makes him deleting his fucking stream make a lot more sense this guy's a super dumbass brother

484
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:04,240
like i'm trying to like pay rent like i'm not trying to like get in a fucking lawsuit i don't

485
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:08,560
want drama i don't want the drama well then what are you doing here bro latin makes the claim that

486
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:12,720
super mega made a joke about his lithium use on their podcast which is pretty fucking dumb to do

487
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:17,600
about your employee's mental illness on air yeah i hadn't really made my mental health a fucking

488
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:22,400
bang publicly and then i'm streaming one day and then matt uh it was someone in my chat just was

489
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:27,440
like hey matt said on the podcast that he's gonna take away your uh your fucking lithium i have

490
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:33,360
uh bipolar 2 or like something like that one's a lot and i played it off on stream you know but

491
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:39,120
like afterwards like it was fucking weird yep fair enough that's a weird joke to make especially if

492
00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:44,000
latin's medical issues aren't public he's got a point there latin's next claim revolves around

493
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:48,240
him thinking that everyone at the workplace hates him anytime i would come into the office five days

494
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:53,840
a week uh pretty much here's how the operation would work if i come into a room where everybody's

495
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:58,400
in they're laughing they're joking if i join the conversation if i sit in and i listen

496
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:05,760
i'm fine but if i start talking and i actually involve myself either the group circles in closer

497
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:12,400
so i'm not in the actual physical circle um someone will talk over me until i shut up

498
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:22,160
someone will say a joke like you're gay uh or you know stuff like that uh because it's funny

499
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:29,440
because it's funny um but people would i would get downplayed or ignored or talked over or just

500
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:36,640
i was given this like petty treatment and then i'm sitting there thinking these guys clearly

501
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:40,880
fucking hate me because they're doing this to me every day and then i ask them if we're why

502
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:44,400
they hate me and if they have issues and they're like we're good with our issues we just need to

503
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:49,840
communicate more but yet they keep fucking doing this shit to me they kept literally these people

504
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:53,920
in front of me would like imagine like the people who you think are your best friends

505
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:59,440
now imagine all of them in front of you making plans to hang out with each other after work

506
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:04,320
all the fucking time and not at inviting you and it's not like i felt entitled like i had to be

507
00:44:04,320 --> 00:44:10,560
involved but it literally felt like petty shit that they were making plans in front of me because

508
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:16,160
they know they all knew that they were my only friends at the time like around like my other

509
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:20,960
friends also do content and they're very very busy with their jobs so those guys i saw the most

510
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:26,000
so they would be making plans to go do shit after work in front of me and then not ask me if i

511
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:34,160
wanted to go and then i it happened so much that i truly feel like it was it was on purpose this

512
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:38,720
is just work drama and friend group drama at this point nobody's obligated to like you off the clock

513
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:42,640
are you still mentally back in high school dude you're acting like it well hold on he

514
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:47,760
did say he has anxiety and bpd and bipolar maybe he actually is i was telling these fuckers

515
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:57,360
constantly about my bp1 my bipolar 1 and bpd and my paranoia and how i literally feel like every

516
00:44:57,360 --> 00:45:03,040
person in my fucking life hates me all the time but then latin recontextualizes a huge chunk of

517
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:07,760
lex's story from the previous part listen to this like lex and rav are the people that like

518
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:13,040
when you're hanging out with them they're always the ones contributing all the wheat they're the

519
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:18,640
ones that are ordering uber eats and then they pass you their phone and you're like no i'm not

520
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:22,560
really hungry i don't want to get anything like i can't afford it right now and then they're like

521
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:26,000
instantly they they look at you like you're fucking stupid for assuming that you have to pay

522
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:30,480
them back like they would just be like no like we're boys i got you yeah dude that's why they

523
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:34,400
didn't have the cash to stay in la they were blowing it all on weed and uber eats they're

524
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:38,960
literally the taylor the rens millennial $22 avocado toast can't afford a house meme

525
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:42,880
man the fucking gall to say that you're poor and you're homeless and it's other people's fault that

526
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:46,640
your big adventure of moving to la failed and you had to move back home when you're spending

527
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:51,520
all your money on takeout and weed latin then pulls the same dick punch move that lex did

528
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:56,000
bringing up daniel's suicide however he recontextualizes it to be about his own suicide

529
00:45:56,000 --> 00:46:01,360
attempts they would make jokes about daniel like they would make jokes for like like i'm someone

530
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:07,440
where like i've attempted suicide i am a very depressed person because of my bipolar

531
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:14,880
i make jokes about killing myself all the time that is a true fact but i make jokes about myself

532
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:20,640
or things like that i'm not making jokes to hurt people or making jokes about people that have

533
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:29,520
hurt themselves but matt and ryan make jokes about daniel like like they make jokes about daniel

534
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:33,680
that's right latin makes it all about him and how uncomfortable them talking about daniel's

535
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:37,600
suicide made him i'm sorry bro you're just not mentally stable enough to be an internet

536
00:46:37,600 --> 00:46:42,000
personality as simple as that regardless of the veracity of any of your claims or any good reasons

537
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:45,920
you have for being fucked up or whatever if you are so weak that you just crumple like this at

538
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:50,400
the slightest bit of pushback get off the camera dog part of that suicide conversation revolved

539
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:54,480
around how there was some kid who tried to kill himself and super mega had the opportunity to send

540
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:58,800
him some free merch sign it you know do a good deed the problem is this kid wasn't even a fan

541
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:08,240
of super mega his family knew that he loved youtube comedy but they couldn't confirm if he

542
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:16,800
was a fan of super mega that they just didn't know but they knew he liked youtube comedy

543
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:22,400
i i got the merch ordered for the kid without talking to the boys first but i come to them

544
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:27,920
they're both sitting in their desks um in this office and uh there were four desks

545
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:34,080
everyone had like matt and ryan are on opposite sides of the room and then across from that

546
00:47:34,080 --> 00:47:42,400
you have my desk and justin's desk um and uh justin was there that day uh he was in the room

547
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:50,320
with us and so i thought nothing of the story like i didn't think it was gonna be a big deal

548
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:56,880
like i i asked matt and ryan to sign this book and i start telling them the story and they

549
00:47:56,880 --> 00:48:05,600
instantly just like go the fuck off on these stupid fucking jokes being like like they they

550
00:48:05,600 --> 00:48:11,280
had to go why are we doing this he's not a fan like how do we know he's a fan like it and i was

551
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:18,640
like it doesn't matter just give him the fucking book no it absolutely matters it's one thing if

552
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:23,120
some fan is suicidal and they love your shit and your videos help them get through the day and you

553
00:48:23,120 --> 00:48:26,800
send them a goodie bag that's a good deed but if you're just sending your junk to random suicidal

554
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:31,360
kids that's not helping out the community that's shamelessly promoting yourself off of their

555
00:48:31,360 --> 00:48:35,520
suicide attempt also this is just a personal theory that i have there's no proof of it but

556
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:39,520
latin mentions offhandedly that the kid in question is somebody that his mom knows back

557
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:44,800
in his hometown my mom instantly like you know she's like yes i can get latin to get some merch

558
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:50,080
get him a book like we have to help him was he just trying to score some free shit for somebody

559
00:48:50,080 --> 00:48:54,240
using his connections it's possible but again there's no proof it just feels likely to me

560
00:48:54,240 --> 00:49:00,000
personally next up are latin's complaints about workplace shenanigans i get hired i join the team

561
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:07,840
officially and then i'm walking down the hallway towards the kitchen and matt yells from the office

562
00:49:07,840 --> 00:49:15,360
in the back room that he's going that he will that he might as well show me his dick and balls

563
00:49:15,360 --> 00:49:22,880
because i'm gonna see it anyways so he goes hey latin and i turn around and sure like i didn't

564
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:28,160
you know what i mean like it's i just think it's a bit but i turn around but the dude's

565
00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:36,000
dick and balls are out these guys in front of me decide and um our cinematographer tucker um

566
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:43,840
they decide that they want to compare their assholes to each other so one one at a time

567
00:49:43,840 --> 00:49:49,120
matt and ryan decide to just pull their their pants down um right next to me while i just have

568
00:49:49,120 --> 00:49:55,760
to be sitting there on camera uh and show they're they're literally like faces in each other's

569
00:49:55,760 --> 00:50:02,560
assholes matt jackson like go out we get extra drunk we're having the time of our life like

570
00:50:02,560 --> 00:50:07,600
yeah we're just in this bar we're getting blasted and then at one point i go to the bathroom

571
00:50:08,560 --> 00:50:15,840
and i go into the stall and i close the door and i'm peeing and the next thing that i know

572
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:24,720
is that matt's now entered my stall that i'm in that i closed the door and his camera is like

573
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:31,360
put out in front so he's like front facing he's he's filming just my dick and balls he's filming

574
00:50:31,360 --> 00:50:35,360
me pee okay you know what fair enough he's got a point your boss shouldn't be pulling out his

575
00:50:35,360 --> 00:50:39,360
dick and balls and showing them to you at the office or showing his asshole to other guys in

576
00:50:39,360 --> 00:50:44,160
the recording room or recording employees taking a piss at some point your youtube channel gets big

577
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:47,680
enough that it's not just heterosexual life partners fucking around anymore it's real

578
00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:51,680
employment you can't be doing that shit layton then takes the opportunity to go into matt cheating

579
00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:56,080
on his girlfriend which is shitty but it's got nothing to do with layton or the workplace nonsense

580
00:50:56,080 --> 00:51:04,000
then last summer uh i was the only person that didn't know that matt was cheating on his

581
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:11,200
girlfriend that i was a i was close with like matt's matt's girlfriend was such a good person

582
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:20,240
to me and i i loved her i still do um but i didn't know that matt was cheating on his girlfriend with

583
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:25,440
a new girl that had just joined our friend group that his girlfriend was scared of and felt like

584
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:34,080
was uh an issue um all at this exact same time while matt's having his his little secret

585
00:51:34,080 --> 00:51:43,280
relationship that i didn't know about there was a night that uh me matt and jim drank so much

586
00:51:44,080 --> 00:51:52,480
and at the end of the night uh this this girl comes over and matt and her just like laying

587
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:58,240
on the floor really really close and it's like it felt like middle school flirting and it was icky

588
00:51:59,360 --> 00:52:06,480
but like i wasn't seeing anything that was like to me that consisted as cheating but it wasn't

589
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:11,440
enough for me to feel like i could go to his ex and tell her at the time well his current

590
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:15,760
girlfriend at the time i couldn't text her and be like hey matt's doing something um plus i didn't

591
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:21,040
want to risk my fucking job you know he goes into being raped while he was underage yeah again

592
00:52:21,040 --> 00:52:29,680
really bad but nothing to do with super mega i was raped by a youtuber he got me really fucking high

593
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:36,160
and then he raped me and he told me that i was his boyfriend now and that we were you know we

594
00:52:36,160 --> 00:52:40,720
loved each other and that's what we would do now and the next morning his friends told me his

595
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:45,840
friends found out his friends told me i was so young and that they i didn't know what just

596
00:52:45,840 --> 00:52:49,200
happened to me and i didn't believe them because i thought i was mature for my age because he

597
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:53,600
treated me like an adult and i was like no we're fine he then goes into another employee named

598
00:52:53,600 --> 00:52:58,160
jim and how he gets all this special treatment but look at how he describes that jim could just

599
00:52:58,160 --> 00:53:04,720
like be like oh no my friend had a bad morning so i i had to take him to lunch and take him out all

600
00:53:04,720 --> 00:53:11,200
day and and i i just had to go baby my my little friend and then matt and ryan would just like be

601
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:15,840
like yeah sure yeah dude when jim has a friend that needs special care latin makes fun of him

602
00:53:15,840 --> 00:53:19,680
for being childish but when latin or lex or any of their associates need special care they're

603
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:24,400
crying and screaming about how super mega doesn't care about them how dare you latin then goes into

604
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:28,720
the circumstances of him getting fired but oddly enough he doesn't actually go into why he got

605
00:53:28,720 --> 00:53:34,320
fired matt and ryan were like hey dude we have to talk to you like when i when you get if you guys

606
00:53:34,320 --> 00:53:40,880
remember when i drove to vegas i knew that whole drive that matt and ryan were gonna fire me on

607
00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:46,960
monday monday comes around they tell me that they still have some things to talk about between the

608
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:54,880
two of them so they're gonna talk to me on tuesday tuesday comes they're not at the office again

609
00:53:55,520 --> 00:54:01,360
and i'm really paranoid i'm terrified that i'm gonna lose my job and i'm gonna lose my insurance

610
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:07,120
and the insurance is all i needed super mega for obviously i need the money to pay my bills

611
00:54:07,120 --> 00:54:17,760
but i need my medication and they on that second day like i ended up texting the two of them and

612
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:25,040
i asked them i was like can you guys just please like confirm to me if i have a job still or not

613
00:54:25,040 --> 00:54:35,280
because like i need to start processing if i need to leave california uh and they they were like

614
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:40,240
sorry dude our hands are tied for your benefit they kept saying that they said it was for my

615
00:54:40,240 --> 00:54:46,720
benefit so uh later that week it's basically i think it's like maybe wednesday then is the next

616
00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:53,360
day they tell me to come in and uh i get there and i walk in the door and i just knew i was

617
00:54:53,360 --> 00:55:03,760
about to lose my job so uh i was in and out in under i would say 20 minutes um they told me that

618
00:55:03,760 --> 00:55:11,520
i was done uh i tried to explain to them some issues that i have with them but they instantly

619
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:17,920
shut me down and tried to explain to me that it's my fault um so i realized again that i was

620
00:55:17,920 --> 00:55:23,120
ignorant for trying to explain to them why why they were wrong so i just let them talk

621
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:30,000
uh and then matt and ryan tell me that i have to sign a non-disparagement contract

622
00:55:30,560 --> 00:55:38,720
if i want severance they basically bragged to me that they didn't have to give me severance

623
00:55:38,720 --> 00:55:45,600
but they felt like they were so good to me like they like matt and ryan felt like they were

624
00:55:46,640 --> 00:55:52,480
blessing a poor person by handing them money and they were but it was it's two months severance

625
00:55:52,480 --> 00:56:01,600
like if like that's genuinely nothing like i'm sorry like like yeah like it's money obviously

626
00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:07,120
but two months severance is so fucked up and it wasn't even like they told me we're gonna also

627
00:56:07,120 --> 00:56:11,600
try to see if we can extend medical benefits or anything they just didn't care they're like all

628
00:56:11,600 --> 00:56:20,640
right here's here's two months rent uh and uh you can never fucking talk about us so yeah latin

629
00:56:20,640 --> 00:56:25,360
signed the nda he knew he couldn't do what he's doing now and decided to do it anyway no sympathy

630
00:56:25,360 --> 00:56:30,000
for this retard anyway latin skimmed over a big part of why he got fired he set up a super mega

631
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:34,560
irl event without scheduling it and informing people properly and as a result a bunch of fans

632
00:56:34,560 --> 00:56:40,000
were left on the hook when matt and ryan didn't know to show up he went into how ryan misgenders

633
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:48,240
his trans partner in private ryan mcgee openly misgenders a trans person in his life that he

634
00:56:48,240 --> 00:57:01,040
cares very much about behind their back i can't tell you how many times i would hear ryan mcgee

635
00:57:01,040 --> 00:57:11,760
say i'm gonna go home to my boyfriend or i'm gonna go fuck this guy matt would make the jokes too

636
00:57:11,760 --> 00:57:21,200
this this partner is such a sweet person i didn't know them well i don't think they

637
00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:29,520
ever liked me um so we just weren't ever close but it broke my fucking heart because i would

638
00:57:29,520 --> 00:57:36,640
see this person and i knew they didn't know that the person that they like literally their fucking

639
00:57:36,640 --> 00:57:50,000
partner is misgendering them all the fucking time and it sorry it literally like it makes me so

640
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:58,080
fucking mad to see just blatant transphobia come from those fuckers and then they turn around and

641
00:57:58,080 --> 00:58:03,840
are like we are so accepting of things oh guess what that was actually fake latin had to walk it

642
00:58:03,840 --> 00:58:09,040
back on twitter he then brings up ryan sexting fans and like at this point latin stream devolves

643
00:58:09,040 --> 00:58:16,400
into character assassination i believe that super mega is a toxic business that represents

644
00:58:19,360 --> 00:58:25,680
nothing good nothing positive and the foundation that that channel was built on is is fucking

645
00:58:25,680 --> 00:58:30,400
wise he says nothing of relevance from here on out he's just rambling and repeating points and

646
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:35,200
occasionally crying and shilling his upcoming show i have a show that i'm working on that

647
00:58:35,200 --> 00:58:45,920
i'm going to release soon called only bricks where i interview only fans models in weird situations

648
00:58:45,920 --> 00:58:52,480
and i let them pick a fun lego set and i want to give these people who get so much hate online

649
00:58:52,480 --> 00:58:58,160
because dumbass n-cells say they're hot girls that have no personality or they just say that

650
00:58:58,160 --> 00:59:02,880
they're people that just rely on their looks i think that's such a dumb idea and i want to

651
00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:09,280
give these people the opportunity to truly prove who they are and basically doing anything he can

652
00:59:09,280 --> 00:59:13,360
to pad out the stream so the donations keep rolling in wait is there an ad

653
00:59:16,800 --> 00:59:23,040
i'm sorry everyone i wish i could turn that off but really do i don't want to try to seem like

654
00:59:23,040 --> 00:59:28,400
i'm trying to monetize anything you can literally shut off twitch ads in the dashboard dude the only

655
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:33,600
legitimate parts of latin story is that matt and ryan are still behaving like super mega is a frat

656
00:59:33,600 --> 00:59:38,160
house full of their friends rather than them both being 30 years old running a real business it

657
00:59:38,160 --> 00:59:42,320
sounds like there was some weird sexual harassment shit at the super mega house not exploitative or

658
00:59:42,320 --> 00:59:46,640
pleasurable or anything like that just prank shit that went too far and is not appropriate in a

659
00:59:46,640 --> 00:59:50,800
business setting they clearly need to grow up these aren't high school friends they're employees

660
00:59:50,800 --> 00:59:54,880
but everything else latin talks about is irrelevant he's simply dragging everything

661
00:59:54,880 --> 00:59:59,280
out for the camera in order to garner sympathy earn some money and get his next project off the

662
00:59:59,280 --> 01:00:04,160
ground eventually matt and ryan from super mega responded to everything on the super mega channel

663
01:00:04,160 --> 01:00:08,640
they each did their own vlog and have basically peaced out from the internet since in ryan's vlog

664
01:00:08,640 --> 01:00:13,200
he immediately sells dawn up the river but does so by appealing to lex's victimhood on the night of

665
01:00:13,200 --> 01:00:20,160
may 25th lex reached out to me through text they wanted to talk about something i said okay she

666
01:00:20,160 --> 01:00:27,520
called i answered and she began to confide in me about a sexual assault that she experienced

667
01:00:28,240 --> 01:00:34,640
by our mutual friend don who was our channel artist at the time i took these allegations

668
01:00:34,640 --> 01:00:39,120
seriously and expressed my support for lex and i asked her permission to talk to don about the

669
01:00:39,120 --> 01:00:45,440
sexual assault directly unfortunately my words ended up ringing hollow as matt and i continuously

670
01:00:45,440 --> 01:00:56,640
tiptoed around the subject we didn't expect this from don um nobody uh expects their friend to do

671
01:00:56,640 --> 01:01:01,360
something this serious to another friend even though lex's whole thing was entirely about

672
01:01:01,360 --> 01:01:05,040
how super mega apparently fucked up her life by kicking her out and only a little bit about don

673
01:01:05,040 --> 01:01:08,880
at the start ryan completely sides with lex because he's a progressive and believe all women

674
01:01:08,880 --> 01:01:13,040
he throws don under the bus and then he throws himself under the bus we selfishly waited until

675
01:01:13,040 --> 01:01:18,880
we felt comfortable to have this discussion with don instead of having the victims back immediately

676
01:01:18,880 --> 01:01:24,560
there's no excusing the lack of tack that was used to handle this um lex should have felt safe and i

677
01:01:24,560 --> 01:01:32,880
am sorry to lex for making them feel like they weren't hurt at that time i was spineless could

678
01:01:32,880 --> 01:01:38,880
have been handled so much better and should have been handled so much better especially since

679
01:01:39,440 --> 01:01:45,840
lex was the one who trusted us with her story and her trauma there's no excusing the way matt

680
01:01:45,840 --> 01:01:53,920
and i handled that situation if we were to do it right we would have from the get-go fired

681
01:01:53,920 --> 01:01:58,800
down immediately going so far as to imply that he's quitting super mega i have obviously been

682
01:01:58,800 --> 01:02:05,280
irresponsible with the platform i was given so as it stands i don't deserve one since this is my

683
01:02:05,280 --> 01:02:10,800
final video this next topic is really the only thing i care to defend myself on this entire vlog

684
01:02:10,800 --> 01:02:14,880
comes across as like i said at the start a calculated utilitarian move in order to save

685
01:02:14,880 --> 01:02:18,880
super mega from the wrath of their young progressive audience ryan then goes after

686
01:02:18,880 --> 01:02:23,520
latent for daring to utter daniel's name in a stream to address these allegations head on about

687
01:02:23,520 --> 01:02:29,120
me making fun of the suicide of my best friend i just want to state that it's just untrue the

688
01:02:29,120 --> 01:02:34,240
person making these claims never knew daniel they definitely were not a part of the group that

689
01:02:34,240 --> 01:02:43,040
experienced the trauma of losing him and i think honestly it is disrespectful to bring him up

690
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:50,560
as a weapon i felt like he was just brought into the situation for drama's sake to try to

691
01:02:51,360 --> 01:03:00,880
hurt me or matt or hurt our image i have done enough shit to tarnish my image but i will not

692
01:03:00,880 --> 01:03:10,240
stand by and let someone talk lies about the way i talked or treated my trauma in regards to daniel

693
01:03:10,240 --> 01:03:16,160
the sole focus of all of this should have been about the support that lex needed you know how

694
01:03:16,160 --> 01:03:20,880
it is right kneel for the woman take down the gay guy normal stuff in progville the truth is even if

695
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:26,000
we assume lex's sexual assault claim is true latin is clearly just dog piling it happens every single

696
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:29,760
time a big canceling attempt goes down people see their chance and jump on it madison's doing it

697
01:03:29,760 --> 01:03:33,200
right now at alliance tech tips something i'll likely cover in a future video there's one last

698
01:03:33,200 --> 01:03:36,800
thing to check out before we move over to matt's video which is about five times as long as ryan's

699
01:03:36,800 --> 01:03:43,360
i had inappropriate communications with fans while in a long-term committed relationship while

700
01:03:43,360 --> 01:03:48,880
technically these actions are between two consenting adults it truly is pathetic and

701
01:03:48,880 --> 01:03:53,280
there's no excuse for it it's clear that instead of being responsible with the super mega brand i

702
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:59,520
abused my position and my power for selfish self-indulgence listen if you're a cute girl

703
01:03:59,520 --> 01:04:04,800
i will 100 exploit my tiny youtube stardom to get into your pants you can absolutely get ahead

704
01:04:04,800 --> 01:04:08,880
with me by sending me your nudes i will totally abuse my position i don't give a fuck okay let's

705
01:04:08,880 --> 01:04:13,040
move on to matt's video he immediately tells the breakup story from his point of view where lex

706
01:04:13,040 --> 01:04:18,400
dumped don and then he flew don out to la to be a good friend so on may 19 2022 after returning home

707
01:04:18,400 --> 01:04:23,520
from creator clash i got a call from don uh in which he was crying saying that him and lex had

708
01:04:23,520 --> 01:04:28,080
just broken up he told me he was essentially stuck in florida because he's from germany and he had no

709
01:04:28,080 --> 01:04:33,200
money and didn't know what to do and at this time i didn't know any specifics of what had happened

710
01:04:33,200 --> 01:04:38,960
with the breakup he mentioned to me that they had been distant and then ended up just breaking up

711
01:04:38,960 --> 01:04:45,680
that was the extent of my knowledge on the split at the time feeling bad for don i uh offered to

712
01:04:45,680 --> 01:04:50,880
get him a one-way plane ticket to la to come crash at my place until he could find a way to get back

713
01:04:50,880 --> 01:04:56,640
to germany he took me up on the offer and on may 23rd he flew out to la when don arrived he cried

714
01:04:56,640 --> 01:05:01,920
to me about how heartbroken he was and the whole time i was none the wiser on what had actually

715
01:05:01,920 --> 01:05:07,280
taken place between him and lex and if i had known i would not have invited him out to la to stay

716
01:05:07,280 --> 01:05:11,760
with me i would not have housed him i don't remember exactly but i think rav was the one who

717
01:05:11,760 --> 01:05:17,840
told me initially uh on my balcony one night and he told me that don had sexually assaulted lex

718
01:05:17,840 --> 01:05:24,720
this was something that i did not expect from don and uh truth be told i had a bit of a hard time

719
01:05:24,720 --> 01:05:31,680
accepting it i soon asked don about this um and what he told me was he chalked it up to basically

720
01:05:31,680 --> 01:05:37,520
a misunderstanding in the bedroom at this time i did not grasp how serious the situation was

721
01:05:37,520 --> 01:05:43,120
and obviously he did not either listen to that dude matt is acting like it's a failing that he

722
01:05:43,120 --> 01:05:47,200
didn't immediately believe lex without proof and he had questions on whether or not his friend was

723
01:05:47,200 --> 01:05:51,840
capable of committing sexual assault when that's a completely normal impulse matt takes the same

724
01:05:51,840 --> 01:05:56,480
stance that ryan does even though lex is trying to destroy super mega he's supporting her against

725
01:05:56,480 --> 01:06:01,440
don matt even admits that he did bring up his business in the context of the don sexual assault

726
01:06:01,440 --> 01:06:05,680
allegations and says that he shouldn't have done that i told lex that ryan and i fully supported

727
01:06:05,680 --> 01:06:10,720
her that we believed her 100 and that we would be there for her to be honest i was terrified

728
01:06:10,720 --> 01:06:16,080
of misstepping in this situation due to its sensitive nature and how close it was to home

729
01:06:16,080 --> 01:06:22,800
i was not sure how to navigate it this was all new territory to me and i asked her a really stupid

730
01:06:22,800 --> 01:06:27,200
question because of that i asked lex what she wanted me and ryan to do about the situation

731
01:06:27,200 --> 01:06:32,480
which was an absolutely dumb ass thing to ask i meant it from a place of we want to help and we

732
01:06:32,480 --> 01:06:37,200
will do whatever it is you want us to do to make the situation better i now see that obviously came

733
01:06:37,200 --> 01:06:42,560
across as me putting the responsibility of the situation back on the victim and i feel terrible

734
01:06:42,640 --> 01:06:47,280
about that my intention was to be helpful and i went about it very poorly in lex's statement

735
01:06:47,280 --> 01:06:54,400
she said that i brought up technicalities over don's employment as well as me saying something

736
01:06:54,400 --> 01:06:59,840
along the lines of how much it would suck for super mega if this got out and that super mega

737
01:06:59,840 --> 01:07:04,240
was my magnum opus and i didn't want anything to ruin that over the course of the phone call we did

738
01:07:04,240 --> 01:07:09,360
discuss don's role with super mega and while i don't recall making any of those specific comments

739
01:07:09,360 --> 01:07:14,080
i do know i brought up our business and how don's actions might affect that that was completely

740
01:07:14,080 --> 01:07:19,040
wrong of me to do i never should have brought up anything as trivial as that while lex was telling

741
01:07:19,040 --> 01:07:24,000
me something very difficult i was kind of freaking out and i was thinking out loud it should not have

742
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:29,200
even been on my mind uh and that was selfish of me what i should have done was just listened

743
01:07:29,200 --> 01:07:34,800
and offered support and not questioned anything yeah that is shit of him but look at this double

744
01:07:34,800 --> 01:07:39,920
standard lex wants every irrational action explained by trauma or fight or flan or

745
01:07:39,920 --> 01:07:44,560
whatever the fuck but matt makes one knee-jerk misstep and he should be destroyed yeah he

746
01:07:44,560 --> 01:07:49,440
shouldn't have done it but isn't lex's entire story built on the idea that people do irrational

747
01:07:49,440 --> 01:07:53,520
things in the heat of the moment and we should excuse them for it matt buddy just claim you

748
01:07:53,520 --> 01:07:57,680
were sexually assaulted it apparently explains everything away the first half of matt's video

749
01:07:57,680 --> 01:08:01,840
is just him recontextualizing all the various stories that lex gave about her interactions

750
01:08:01,840 --> 01:08:06,400
with dom to paint dom as the villain and lex as the victim and he and ryan are so sorry about

751
01:08:06,400 --> 01:08:11,840
their part in all of it then at the halfway point he says this i also want to address a very large

752
01:08:11,840 --> 01:08:18,400
chunk of lex's video that was focused on her and rav's time living at our office aka the super

753
01:08:18,400 --> 01:08:22,160
mega plex did that not sound a little passive aggressive to you like you can't come out and

754
01:08:22,160 --> 01:08:25,760
shit on lex but he's like yeah bitch we all know you spent most of your video not even talking

755
01:08:25,760 --> 01:08:30,640
about dom matt knows that the smear is in and he has to reply to it without throwing lex into the

756
01:08:30,640 --> 01:08:35,040
bus since she's a victimized woman but also while still presenting his own case he does this by

757
01:08:35,040 --> 01:08:39,840
wording it like there is miscommunication on all sides we're all just so busy etc etc when she was

758
01:08:39,840 --> 01:08:43,360
saying it was clearly meant to live or there was a secret meaning behind these messages or something

759
01:08:43,360 --> 01:08:48,960
then matt provides new receipts things that lex didn't show in her two-hour video where lex painted

760
01:08:48,960 --> 01:08:53,280
their relationship post moving out of the super mega house and back to nashville as being very

761
01:08:53,280 --> 01:08:57,200
bitter and that she was left homeless and stuck in hostels or whatever they were actually texting

762
01:08:57,200 --> 01:09:02,720
back and forth and being very friendly all the way through the end of 2022 months after apparently

763
01:09:02,720 --> 01:09:07,360
lex said she had stopped running with them i thought that after i apologized to her last july

764
01:09:07,360 --> 01:09:13,920
things had smoothed out and i think you could see why i would think that uh but that communication

765
01:09:13,920 --> 01:09:20,320
ceased around the time that we fired latin who is a close friend of hers and now it all comes

766
01:09:20,320 --> 01:09:26,720
together doesn't it lex is just fine with everyone and everything until her friend latin gets fired

767
01:09:26,800 --> 01:09:32,320
from super mega for his incompetence and only then did these allegations start coming out it seems to

768
01:09:32,320 --> 01:09:36,960
me like lex and latin put together this quasi manifesto shitting on super mega and front-loaded

769
01:09:36,960 --> 01:09:41,120
it with lex's reinterpretation of a relationship with don as sexual assault in order to make the

770
01:09:41,120 --> 01:09:45,600
whole story easier to swallow in the whole whirlwind of lex trying to make everything stick

771
01:09:45,600 --> 01:09:51,040
she brought up how matt fucked some porn star not only did he cheat on his girlfriend and broke up

772
01:09:51,040 --> 01:09:57,440
with her and then she found out after because jim was living with the new girl uh while she's still

773
01:09:57,440 --> 01:10:02,800
friends with jim like they're both friends with jim he also takes a break with the new girlfriend

774
01:10:02,800 --> 01:10:13,600
he's with to uh basically solicit a sex worker girl um that he was into to come live in la and

775
01:10:13,600 --> 01:10:21,200
move from like across the us before he decided that he wanted to go back to the girlfriend

776
01:10:21,200 --> 01:10:27,040
that he was just with so if i were him i would probably be reevaluating my life as well the porn

777
01:10:27,040 --> 01:10:32,000
star in question morgan or morgue pie on social media also came out with her own dumb fuck

778
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:36,240
allegations about how matt fucked her and ghosted her and how she expected a relationship and how

779
01:10:36,240 --> 01:10:40,640
awful he is they're not really worth going over because she's just stupid the charge here is we

780
01:10:40,640 --> 01:10:44,560
had sex and he didn't call me back which man in an age of tinder and hookups that doesn't really

781
01:10:44,560 --> 01:10:48,880
land anymore let alone with somebody who does fucking porn in any case matt simply admitted it

782
01:10:48,880 --> 01:10:53,440
he said it was a hookup between his real relationships and then provided texts showing

783
01:10:53,440 --> 01:10:58,800
that this was the case and morgan knew it in august 2022 when i was single and in between

784
01:10:58,800 --> 01:11:04,160
relationships i sexted with her for one night and ultimately slept with her for two nights in

785
01:11:04,160 --> 01:11:10,080
september when she was visiting los angeles during our hookups i explicitly stated to morgan that

786
01:11:10,080 --> 01:11:15,440
this was a hookup and that i had just gotten out of a relationship and i was not looking for

787
01:11:15,440 --> 01:11:20,560
anything and this is something she acknowledged i actually brought this up uh more than once

788
01:11:20,560 --> 01:11:26,640
after she left la to go back home i could tell that she had caught some feelings and i did not

789
01:11:26,640 --> 01:11:32,480
want to lead her on so i began to kind of distance myself shortly after i also ended up working

790
01:11:32,480 --> 01:11:36,800
through a rough patch and started dating my current girlfriend and i talked to morgan even

791
01:11:36,800 --> 01:11:42,320
less after this we stopped communication i didn't feel like it was appropriate to you know be

792
01:11:42,320 --> 01:11:48,720
talking to someone who the relationship i had was primarily sexual uh while i had a girlfriend we

793
01:11:48,720 --> 01:11:53,520
pretty much lost all contact uh after i started dating my current girlfriend and i figured that

794
01:11:53,520 --> 01:12:00,800
that was normal and that's kind of just what is the typical life cycle of a hookup i was very

795
01:12:00,800 --> 01:12:08,400
surprised to hear what morgan had to say on stream considering last month in june we had

796
01:12:08,400 --> 01:12:15,600
a very pleasant conversation uh where we tied up any loose ends and smoothed everything out

797
01:12:15,600 --> 01:12:19,600
and i'm going to share that conversation morgan reached out to me on june 8th and said hey matt

798
01:12:19,600 --> 01:12:24,080
hope you're doing well i said hey i've been doing okay been really busy and stressed but i'm pushing

799
01:12:24,080 --> 01:12:28,560
through have you been she said oh man me too supremely stressed but i'm coming to la this

800
01:12:28,560 --> 01:12:32,480
month and i'll be doing so much cool shit so i'm excited glad to hear you're pushing through

801
01:12:32,480 --> 01:12:36,400
i said i'm just kind of exhausted with tor coming up and stuff but i'll be okay i've been doing

802
01:12:36,400 --> 01:12:40,480
therapy a lot which has been super helpful and glad to hear you're doing cool shit she replies

803
01:12:40,480 --> 01:12:44,320
with oh i'm so happy to hear therapy has been helping i've had mixed results with that great

804
01:12:44,320 --> 01:12:48,960
when it actually works out she replies with yeah man i'm excited but yeah just thought i'd check

805
01:12:48,960 --> 01:12:52,880
up on you because even though things got a little weird i'll always care about you dude hope you

806
01:12:52,880 --> 01:12:57,840
have a great tour too i respond with i appreciate it and i'm sorry things got a little weird i'm not

807
01:12:57,840 --> 01:13:01,840
very good at navigating stuff and when i got in a relationship shortly after i wasn't sure how

808
01:13:01,840 --> 01:13:06,000
to not be awkward about it i care about you too and i don't feel weird at all about things or

809
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:11,360
about you she said yeah i kind of know what happened lol people talk but cool man i'm glad

810
01:13:11,360 --> 01:13:16,720
things aren't weird i said same glad it's not weird i feel a lot better now lol she said me too

811
01:13:16,720 --> 01:13:22,400
i hate loose ends and i said same they bother me so much lol and for clarity i never felt bad or

812
01:13:22,400 --> 01:13:26,880
negative about you i just didn't know how to not be awkward after a hookup i'm not really a hookup

813
01:13:26,880 --> 01:13:32,000
person especially since i'm in a relationship now sorry for my awkwardness glad we're all good

814
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:36,800
morgan replies with yeah i felt a bit sour about it tbh because i'm not really a hookup person

815
01:13:36,800 --> 01:13:41,840
either loki caught me with some feels and i felt pretty used afterwards but shit happens and that's

816
01:13:41,840 --> 01:13:46,320
on me so i don't harbor any ill will towards you i mean i didn't expect a relationship or anything

817
01:13:46,320 --> 01:13:51,360
but yeah lol i responded with i feel ya and i'm sorry for acting in any way that made you feel

818
01:13:51,360 --> 01:13:55,360
used that was never my intention and i'm just kind of awkward with this stuff i could tell

819
01:13:55,360 --> 01:13:58,640
a little that you were catching feels and i didn't want to lead you on and hurt you

820
01:13:58,640 --> 01:14:02,960
morgan said i really appreciate that i'm just a big baby and when i open myself up like that

821
01:14:02,960 --> 01:14:06,880
to someone it's because i'm really into them contrary to what my profession may lead you to

822
01:14:06,880 --> 01:14:11,040
think but i'm glad we could talk about this i appreciate you talking about this with me even

823
01:14:11,040 --> 01:14:15,200
though you aren't obligated to at all i said of course i'm really glad we're talking about it too

824
01:14:15,200 --> 01:14:20,480
because i didn't like feeling awkward or having a loose end and she said yeah same w i respond with

825
01:14:20,560 --> 01:14:25,760
a cool sunglasses smiley face and that was the last time we talked so why did morgan jump on

826
01:14:25,760 --> 01:14:30,080
this bandwagon well maybe because she was one of the first people involved in latin's new show

827
01:14:30,080 --> 01:14:36,160
morgue pie is someone that i met and didn't need to like me you know like didn't have to

828
01:14:37,600 --> 01:14:47,120
but especially after all this crazy shit she still was so sweet to me and like wanted to record with

829
01:14:47,120 --> 01:14:53,600
me and like she liked the idea of my show and so i recorded this insane fucking episode

830
01:14:54,960 --> 01:15:02,640
of only bricks with morgan and we didn't even get like fucking three percent done everything here

831
01:15:02,640 --> 01:15:07,360
seems to revolve around latin lex and morgan are his friends helping him out with their femoid

832
01:15:07,360 --> 01:15:12,640
tears but it really just seems like this is latin's campaign to ruin super mega and matt says as much

833
01:15:12,640 --> 01:15:18,160
a former employee of super mega named latin stallard has made some very serious accusations

834
01:15:18,160 --> 01:15:23,760
against me and ryan i did not plan on nor did i want to make a segment of this video based around

835
01:15:23,760 --> 01:15:29,920
this but after everything latin has said about us publicly i feel that i have no choice but to

836
01:15:29,920 --> 01:15:36,000
respond and give my side of the story and show receipts we fired latin from working at super mega

837
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:42,720
in march 2023 and since then he has led a vindictive campaign to cancel us to deplatform

838
01:15:42,720 --> 01:15:48,080
us to ruin our image basically we were not happy with his performance he had been causing problems

839
01:15:48,080 --> 01:15:52,400
uh with his mood swings and outbursts at the office as well as a general performance that

840
01:15:52,400 --> 01:15:57,360
we didn't like we made the difficult decision to let him go even latin's claims that the workplace

841
01:15:57,360 --> 01:16:02,000
was full of homophobic jokes that he just hated and felt alienated due to ends up being not true

842
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:07,600
as matt shows off many texts of latin being totally cool with it i find it a little ironic

843
01:16:07,600 --> 01:16:13,920
that he complained about this considering for example in december we were recording a podcast

844
01:16:13,920 --> 01:16:20,320
when he came in unannounced and showed us his cock and balls in late 20s uh chuck hey latin

845
01:16:21,200 --> 01:16:27,760
hey whoa do you see his balls latin you want to come take a seat do you see his balls

846
01:16:28,720 --> 01:16:33,520
okay hold on i don't think it's appropriate for the podcast matt then shows screenshots from a

847
01:16:33,520 --> 01:16:38,400
dedicated super mega hate discord where they plan to help latin cancel super mega by using any

848
01:16:38,400 --> 01:16:42,720
scandal they can get their hands on we just need a piece of gossip it's big enough that their sponsor

849
01:16:42,720 --> 01:16:46,240
will want to drop super mega well what if he tried to spin something like they covered by

850
01:16:46,240 --> 01:16:51,120
sexual assault would that do the deed and it worked at least initially super mega went into

851
01:16:51,120 --> 01:16:55,680
a subscriber death spiral their community subret was an open revolt everyone was disavowing them

852
01:16:55,680 --> 01:17:00,240
and latin's own bitterness finally won the day at least initially this is a way for latin and

853
01:17:00,240 --> 01:17:05,040
lex and morgan to try and bolster their careers by destroying larger creators they used to associate

854
01:17:05,040 --> 01:17:10,160
with it's that simple dude and it all works because in 2023 you can be as shitty of a person

855
01:17:10,160 --> 01:17:15,200
you want and simply say trauma and it's all excused believe all women guys don't be a rape

856
01:17:15,200 --> 01:17:20,640
apologist by asking questions rav was also trying to figure out what had gone down and at this point

857
01:17:20,640 --> 01:17:26,400
i don't think any of us still were taking it as seriously as we should have been and that is

858
01:17:26,400 --> 01:17:32,880
something that i sincerely regret because we did not take it as seriously right from the jump as

859
01:17:32,880 --> 01:17:38,800
we should have instead we asked questions and tried to do some detective work and get to the

860
01:17:38,800 --> 01:17:43,920
bottom of it no no matt no doing detective work is supporting the rape the worst part is that

861
01:17:43,920 --> 01:17:48,480
don's career is completely in tatters i think he's innocent he's been completely ruined by this this

862
01:17:48,480 --> 01:17:52,080
was clearly a group of people who want to direct super mega and they decided to destroy don in the

863
01:17:52,080 --> 01:17:57,040
process because he was an easy tool to use after all don's a fat guy who would ever believe that

864
01:17:57,040 --> 01:18:01,040
somebody as hot as lex would ever consent to dating him lex's current boyfriend is also a

865
01:18:01,040 --> 01:18:05,360
fat socialist soy boy she just seems to have a type what happened with super mega listen nick

866
01:18:05,360 --> 01:18:10,560
made a video about it but all you need to know is that they're bad go to their subreddit there's

867
01:18:10,560 --> 01:18:17,760
plenty of information google super mega subreddit and go there now look at anything look at the

868
01:18:17,760 --> 01:18:26,080
first post it's been trending all weekend it's funny how fast everyone turned on super mega

869
01:18:26,080 --> 01:18:32,720
yeah and i think that goes to show right it's kind of self-fulfilling in a sense you know it

870
01:18:32,720 --> 01:18:37,840
kind of makes both lex's and latin's claim they don't want drama and they just want to tell their

871
01:18:37,840 --> 01:18:42,240
stories and empower other victims ring really fucking hollow when they're gloating at the

872
01:18:42,240 --> 01:18:47,600
super mega subscriber count going below 1 million said socialist soy boy runs a small time crumbtuber

873
01:18:47,600 --> 01:18:51,840
channel putting out the worst leftist garbage content imaginable in between tweeting about

874
01:18:51,840 --> 01:18:56,080
how he totally met the super mega guys and they totally use slurs constantly even though matt

875
01:18:56,080 --> 01:19:01,040
confirmed he doesn't really know this guy shortly after one of latin's best friends who is lex's

876
01:19:01,040 --> 01:19:08,640
boyfriend uh tried to instigate drama on twitter by lying and saying that he has heard us say the

877
01:19:08,640 --> 01:19:15,200
n-word multiple times in reality we've only met this individual a handful of times and it's mostly

878
01:19:15,200 --> 01:19:23,120
been at social events and always accompanied by lex so to think that we would just casually be

879
01:19:23,120 --> 01:19:29,760
dropping the n-word with a hard r in front of not only someone who's a stranger but also a woman of

880
01:19:29,760 --> 01:19:35,360
color yeah that makes a lot of sense this entire group of people are just leeches they've only

881
01:19:35,360 --> 01:19:40,400
temporarily bound themselves together in order to take down super mega in fact latin shit talked

882
01:19:40,400 --> 01:19:45,120
lex behind her back when she was squatting at the super mega house when these texts came out

883
01:19:45,120 --> 01:19:49,760
i wonder if lex felt like a fucking retard burning all of her credibility to prop this little shit up

884
01:19:49,760 --> 01:19:53,680
in any case latin wasn't doing anything in the name of accountability he just wanted to hurt

885
01:19:53,680 --> 01:20:02,960
super mega i just hope you all believe that like this is not a push for me to try to get clout

886
01:20:03,760 --> 01:20:09,440
i'm fucking terrified right now i don't buy that he's terrified for one second this is latin's

887
01:20:09,520 --> 01:20:13,280
ticket to internet fame being the guy who got super mega cancelled and then plugging his new

888
01:20:13,280 --> 01:20:18,080
show of course it was his plan all along morgan's part of latin's plan was ultimately insignificant

889
01:20:18,080 --> 01:20:22,480
she simply served to be another source of matt looking bad after all matt and morgan were on good

890
01:20:22,480 --> 01:20:27,040
terms right up until she started talking to latin following when i had that text conversation with

891
01:20:27,040 --> 01:20:32,560
morgan and june where we smooth things over morgan began hanging out with our ex-employee

892
01:20:32,560 --> 01:20:37,520
latin more and i have not heard from her since that conversation until i saw her stream lex's

893
01:20:37,520 --> 01:20:42,640
story however was the core of their plans her claim was the catalyst for everything not because

894
01:20:42,640 --> 01:20:46,640
she was actually a victim of dawn i don't buy that for a second they simply pre-faced the whole

895
01:20:46,640 --> 01:20:51,600
canceling event with the dawn story to make it seem more legitimate lex's actual grievance is

896
01:20:51,600 --> 01:20:56,640
she feels slighted because her next big career move was moving out to la making connections in

897
01:20:56,640 --> 01:21:00,800
the creator space and trying to get something going that way that failed because she mooched

898
01:21:00,800 --> 01:21:06,000
off super mega for months and everyone got tired of her being around as time went on and weeks

899
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:12,240
turned into months of them staying at the office we were unsure of their plans and how motivated

900
01:21:12,240 --> 01:21:17,840
they were to actually find a place to move into there's simply no reason to believe this failed

901
01:21:17,840 --> 01:21:23,360
me too attempt of dawn in my opinion dawn's the victim his careers and tatters he's lost all of

902
01:21:23,360 --> 01:21:28,080
his connections there's no proof of anything and it's all real believable because lex is a pretty

903
01:21:28,080 --> 01:21:33,600
woman and don is an unattractive guy the post me too era that we're currently living in in 2023

904
01:21:33,600 --> 01:21:39,200
is fucking disgusting furthermore because lex self-id's as a she they non-binary trans person

905
01:21:39,200 --> 01:21:43,760
she's not a woman and therefore under the laws of me too i am no longer obligated to believe her

906
01:21:43,760 --> 01:21:49,440
see you later bitch anything and everything was on the table no matter what your race

907
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:56,320
or your identity or your your no matter what like you could be made fun of by those guys

908
01:21:56,320 --> 01:22:03,200
someone who had been with latin and a group of his friends uh told us that he had been flaunting

909
01:22:03,200 --> 01:22:08,880
that if things ever went south with us he could just easily cancel us he not only propagated

910
01:22:08,880 --> 01:22:13,600
a lot of the jokes that he claimed to be offended by but he participated in the jokes he even

911
01:22:13,600 --> 01:22:18,160
encouraged them we always wanted latin to feel comfortable even when we were making jokes we

912
01:22:18,160 --> 01:22:23,600
never wanted him to feel targeted with any jokes his tone changed completely uh the moment he was

913
01:22:23,600 --> 01:22:28,960
fired i felt so fucking weak i don't know i'm a i'm a big boy or whatever but like when i got when

914
01:22:28,960 --> 01:22:35,680
i was like oh i'm non-binary i just woke up and i was like i'm bored i i'm she they now and uh

915
01:22:35,680 --> 01:22:40,800
and i'm sure that works and then you got a ton more friends you got the crowds you got the eyes

916
01:22:40,800 --> 01:22:45,760
on you everybody's like wow that's so cool yeah it felt like a lie to me
