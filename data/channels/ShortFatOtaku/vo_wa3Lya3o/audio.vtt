00:00.000 --> 00:02.240
Berkeley is no stranger to protests.

00:02.240 --> 00:06.800
In the 1960s, U of C Berkeley was the center point of the free speech movement,

00:06.800 --> 00:11.440
with iconic photographs emerging from the period of hippie students holding up free speech signs.

00:11.440 --> 00:15.760
In the 2010s, U of C Berkeley is also a center point of the free speech movement,

00:15.760 --> 00:17.280
though in a different way.

00:17.280 --> 00:21.440
Iconic photos now consist of hipster students burning free speech signs.

00:21.440 --> 00:26.240
Since Trump's election, U of C Berkeley, like other left-leaning locations in the United States,

00:26.240 --> 00:28.240
have collectively lost their minds.

00:28.240 --> 00:33.360
On February 1st, when conservative talking head and flamboyantly gay Trump supporter,

00:33.360 --> 00:37.040
Milo Yiannopoulos, was scheduled to give a speech on campus,

00:37.040 --> 00:41.520
approximately 1500 people showed up to peacefully protest, as is their right to do so.

00:41.520 --> 00:46.160
However, approximately 150 members of the Black Bloc, dressed head to toe in black

00:46.160 --> 00:48.480
in order to appear threatening and conceal their identities,

00:48.480 --> 00:51.680
infiltrated the crowd with weapons and began to incite violence.

00:51.680 --> 00:56.000
These individuals, who claimed to be part of either Antifa or BAM,

00:56.000 --> 00:58.240
otherwise known as by any means necessary,

00:58.240 --> 01:00.480
attacked both the crowd and the police,

01:00.480 --> 01:03.440
threw fireworks and lit the place on fucking fire.

01:03.440 --> 01:06.160
After Milo's event was canceled due to the violence,

01:06.160 --> 01:09.280
the crowd moved off campus into the city of Berkeley proper,

01:09.280 --> 01:11.200
damaging property in the downtown area.

01:11.200 --> 01:16.800
On March 4th, the aptly named March for Trump went down at multiple locations across the USA.

01:17.520 --> 01:21.360
As expected, the Berkeley protest turned violent even before it began,

01:21.360 --> 01:23.920
with Black Bloc members attacking the pro-Trump camp.

01:23.920 --> 01:27.200
This is when Based Stickman first became known to the internet.

01:27.200 --> 01:30.160
On April 15th, the battle for Berkeley began,

01:30.160 --> 01:34.000
having realized that the reason the Black Bloc had been so effective at turning the

01:34.000 --> 01:37.760
other rallies violent was because they came armed and prepared for a fight.

01:37.760 --> 01:41.920
So the right-wing group the Oath Keepers organized a pro-Trump rally

01:41.920 --> 01:44.080
and also decided to come prepared for a fight.

01:44.080 --> 01:48.720
The ensuing event was a shit show, with both sides repeatedly clashing with weapons,

01:48.720 --> 01:52.080
and multiple arrests and confiscations made by the police,

01:52.080 --> 01:55.520
most notably a former professor attacking a student with a bike lock.

01:55.520 --> 02:01.200
On August 27th, between 2,000 and 4,000 people attended a rally against hate,

02:01.200 --> 02:06.240
which remained largely peaceful until 100 Black Bloc members smuggled in weapons,

02:06.240 --> 02:09.200
bypassing the 500-strong police security checks,

02:09.200 --> 02:12.560
and began attacking the small number of right-wing counter-protesters.

02:12.560 --> 02:16.320
The Berkeley police chief ordered his officers to abandon the park,

02:16.320 --> 02:20.480
stating that having the police confront the Black Bloc would have only led to more violence.

02:20.480 --> 02:24.960
Antifa members also threatened to attack journalists documenting their actions at this event.

02:24.960 --> 02:28.880
If I haven't made it clear yet, Berkeley is a fucking powder keg,

02:28.880 --> 02:33.040
and the students would rather restrict free speech in what they'd call extreme cases,

02:33.040 --> 02:34.800
instead of letting it flourish.

02:34.800 --> 02:40.640
So when conservative pundit Ben Shapiro decided to give a speech at UFC Berkeley on September 14th,

02:40.640 --> 02:44.000
I don't think a single person was surprised that counter-protests sprung up,

02:44.000 --> 02:46.000
with some of them erupting into violence.

02:46.000 --> 02:47.840
Let's take a look at what went down.

02:47.840 --> 02:50.240
Here's the chant of some of the counter-protesters.

02:50.240 --> 03:01.120
If you couldn't make that out, they were saying,

03:01.120 --> 03:03.440
speech is violent, we will not be silent.

03:03.440 --> 03:07.920
Now, I've discussed the slippery slope of problems that come about when speech is equated to violence,

03:07.920 --> 03:10.800
when criticism of idea is equated to attack on a person,

03:10.800 --> 03:13.280
most notably in my video, The Free Speech Problem.

03:13.280 --> 03:15.280
Here's the cliff notes of my criticism.

03:15.280 --> 03:18.560
If speech is considered to be violent, then offense is assault.

03:18.560 --> 03:22.880
And if a hypothetical right to not be offended is like the right to not be assaulted,

03:22.880 --> 03:25.440
or if it is more paramount than the right to free speech,

03:25.440 --> 03:28.400
then any person can censor any speech they like,

03:28.400 --> 03:31.040
even legitimate criticism on the grounds of offense.

03:31.040 --> 03:34.720
But even beyond all that, isn't your chant completely self-defeating?

03:34.720 --> 03:38.960
If speech is violent, then the one thing you should be is silent, you idiots.

03:39.600 --> 03:42.240
Put your fist in the air with me and repeat after me.

03:42.800 --> 03:47.600
In the name of humanity, we refuse.

03:49.200 --> 03:56.080
To accept a fascist America, we will not be silent.

03:57.760 --> 04:05.360
We will not accommodate, we will not collaborate, we will not normalize it.

04:06.880 --> 04:13.840
We will rise up until these fascists are off our streets,

04:14.080 --> 04:19.360
out of our campuses, and out of the White House,

04:23.440 --> 04:24.560
November 4th.

04:26.000 --> 04:36.960
We come in the streets and stay in the streets until Trump and Pence and their whole regime

04:37.840 --> 04:48.560
are gone, night after night, day after day, November 4th, it begins.

04:54.000 --> 04:57.360
I wonder if these fools realize that a fascist regime wouldn't actually

04:57.360 --> 04:59.760
let them say what they're saying or do what they're doing.

04:59.760 --> 05:02.080
Oh well, November 4th video coming up.

05:02.640 --> 05:05.840
Thank you Antifa for maintaining my burgeoning YouTube career.

05:05.840 --> 05:09.120
Here's a U of C Berkeley grad student complaining that first-year students

05:09.120 --> 05:12.720
shouldn't have to be exposed to police or security or barricades on campus.

05:12.720 --> 05:14.080
I'm just a poet, okay?

05:15.120 --> 05:21.440
But I walk into my classroom with freshmen just now, two hours ago, and they ask me,

05:22.080 --> 05:24.000
why are there barricades on campus?

05:24.000 --> 05:26.480
Why is there a police force on campus?

05:26.480 --> 05:29.360
These people don't know, this has nothing to do with them.

05:30.160 --> 05:35.440
And the campus is completely being taken away from students who have every right to access.

05:35.840 --> 05:43.760
I don't think my students should have to be confronted with a

05:43.760 --> 05:45.600
militarized police force on campus.

05:47.680 --> 05:51.280
I don't think they should have to face threats, potential violence, mayhem,

05:51.280 --> 05:53.600
helicopters circling almost every week.

05:54.560 --> 05:59.200
Well, sorry sweetheart, but these first-year students are legally adults.

05:59.200 --> 06:01.200
And if they can't cope with reality yet,

06:01.200 --> 06:03.760
university is probably the best place to start learning that skill.

06:03.760 --> 06:07.280
And who's to blame?

06:08.960 --> 06:10.240
I think chancellor.

06:12.640 --> 06:17.280
Oh yeah, yeah, it's the university chancellor's fault for allowing Ben Shapiro to give his talk.

06:17.280 --> 06:20.400
It's not people who have threatened him and incited violence for the past 10 months

06:20.400 --> 06:22.880
at any high-profile conservative gathering, oh no.

06:22.880 --> 06:27.360
I mean, Ben might have given a talk at U of C Berkeley back in 2016

06:27.360 --> 06:29.440
and not needed a single bit of security at all,

06:30.000 --> 06:34.000
while this time the university had to spend $600,000 on security officers,

06:34.000 --> 06:37.120
on bodyguards, on barricades and other defensive measures.

06:37.120 --> 06:38.560
That's all just Ben's fault.

06:38.560 --> 06:42.080
If Ben just wasn't there, there would be no need for violence at all.

06:42.080 --> 06:46.240
And I just have to ask, what was Ben Shapiro wearing when she was raped?

06:46.880 --> 06:52.400
So under the guise of free speech, they're trying to make their events seem legitimate

06:52.400 --> 06:56.320
and they're trying to sow doubts about what's the right moral thing to do.

06:57.280 --> 07:01.920
And they always invoke John Stuart Mill about their free speech arguments,

07:02.720 --> 07:06.720
which means that apparently you're able to say whatever you want,

07:07.360 --> 07:10.000
but you can't go to physical violence.

07:10.800 --> 07:11.680
Okay, fine.

07:11.680 --> 07:13.760
Free marketplace of ideas.

07:13.760 --> 07:15.840
Every idea has equal value.

07:15.840 --> 07:16.640
That's bullshit.

07:19.440 --> 07:22.080
You don't understand what the free marketplace of ideas is.

07:22.080 --> 07:23.760
And I know you don't understand it,

07:23.840 --> 07:27.680
because the free marketplace of ideas is not about every idea having equal value.

07:28.480 --> 07:32.080
Free marketplace of ideas is about giving every idea a platform

07:32.080 --> 07:33.920
and then allowing the ones with the greatest value

07:33.920 --> 07:35.760
to naturally convince people through their merits.

07:36.560 --> 07:40.480
It's about disproving bad ideas, not preventing them from being heard.

07:40.480 --> 07:43.280
And I'm really sick of all this faulty reasoning

07:43.280 --> 07:46.080
and people trying to pull blinds over other people's eyes

07:46.080 --> 07:51.120
and trying to influence naive young students who don't know what any of this is about.

07:52.080 --> 07:55.600
Okay, Ben Shapiro might have gone to Harvard Law School

07:55.600 --> 07:57.120
and he can sound reasonable,

07:57.760 --> 08:02.720
but it's up to us to teach people how to go past the seeming facades.

08:03.920 --> 08:06.080
It's not rationality, it's fascism.

08:06.080 --> 08:08.960
It's irrational and it's dangerous.

08:08.960 --> 08:11.520
You heard it here, the bald-faced truth.

08:11.520 --> 08:13.600
This might as well be their fucking slogan.

08:13.600 --> 08:15.920
It's not rationality, it's fascism.

08:15.920 --> 08:18.960
When somebody talks about rationality, they see it as fascist.

08:18.960 --> 08:23.760
Presumed because their ideology is irrational and can be defeated by reasoned thinking.

08:23.760 --> 08:25.440
Lauren Southern was down in the crowd,

08:25.440 --> 08:27.920
recording things on the street as she is known to do.

08:27.920 --> 08:29.520
Things were actually pretty quiet,

08:29.520 --> 08:32.640
with Lauren making quips to her livestream chat room every once in a while,

08:32.640 --> 08:34.400
until she bumped into this woman.

08:34.400 --> 08:38.640
That's Yvette Falarca, and there's enough on her to be its entire fucking video.

08:38.640 --> 08:39.600
Maybe in the future.

08:39.600 --> 08:41.200
But for now, here's what you need to know.

08:41.200 --> 08:45.040
She's a big part of the radical violent left-wing group by any means necessary.

08:45.040 --> 08:46.480
Let's see what she has to say for herself.

08:48.960 --> 09:08.000
Uh oh, she's noticed you, Lauren.

09:08.000 --> 09:10.720
She's noticed that you're half her age and twice as good looking.

09:10.720 --> 09:13.680
She's blaming you for her squandering her amazing Asian genes.

09:18.960 --> 09:28.000
I'm a lot to walk here.

09:28.000 --> 09:50.880
Wait wait wait, what the fuck is on this guy's head?

09:50.880 --> 09:53.520
Did he show up to the protest cosplaying as Emo Toad?

09:58.000 --> 10:24.160
To somebody on the outside, here's what this looks and sounds like.

10:24.160 --> 10:27.760
This guy here, in the camo hat, he's doing his best to talk.

10:27.760 --> 10:29.760
And these people are simply chanting past him.

10:29.760 --> 10:32.320
They're intimidating and united, sure.

10:32.320 --> 10:33.600
But they're also mindless.

10:33.600 --> 10:59.120
Oh jeez, I hope she didn't leave a grease stain, Lauren.

10:59.120 --> 11:02.080
Celeste Paradise was attacked while at the protest as well.

11:02.080 --> 11:28.720
She gave her account of events to Scrabblebag Shooter in a video interview.

11:28.720 --> 11:31.760
This is the first time I've ever seen a girl run off with a sign, and I tried to hold onto

11:31.760 --> 11:32.760
it.

11:32.760 --> 11:37.720
And as I was dragged away holding onto it, two guys just grabbed me, spun me away from

11:37.720 --> 11:41.560
the girl who ran off with the sign, and I was in the middle of the crowd all of a sudden.

11:41.560 --> 11:45.200
And then they slammed me down, and my head hit the pavement twice.

11:45.200 --> 11:46.200
It was awful.

11:46.200 --> 11:48.920
I didn't trip, you know, it was awful.

11:48.920 --> 11:54.000
And then I couldn't see for a minute, I was dizzy, I couldn't get up right away, and by

11:54.000 --> 11:58.480
the time I could even think about it, it was this maelstrom of people.

11:58.480 --> 11:59.480
But it was awful.

11:59.480 --> 12:02.400
I got separated from my friends, everyone was screaming at me.

12:02.400 --> 12:05.800
There were no friendlies, the cops were all around me, and it was a terrible position

12:05.800 --> 12:11.720
because everyone was just yelling at me and taking pictures with their phones and not

12:11.720 --> 12:12.720
trying to help me.

12:12.720 --> 12:13.720
I just wanted to die.

12:13.720 --> 12:14.720
I was so embarrassed.

12:14.720 --> 12:15.720
I understand, but it's not your fault.

12:15.720 --> 12:21.960
You definitely don't need to feel embarrassed without disturbing a victim like that.

12:21.960 --> 12:27.840
And a lot of press came up to me, rather from Channel 4 came up, all kinds of different

12:27.840 --> 12:33.160
bloggers, and they all seemed astonished that I would have a sign that said what it said.

12:33.160 --> 12:37.040
They were astonished that you would have a sign that was welcoming Dan Shapiro, and you

12:37.040 --> 12:39.840
were in the middle of downtown, like a first world American city.

12:39.840 --> 12:45.480
Yeah, like the chancellor of this campus invited this person to speak, and I had a sign saying,

12:45.480 --> 12:47.480
yeah, Shalom Shapiro, we welcome you.

12:47.480 --> 12:48.920
And everyone was like, you're brave.

12:48.920 --> 12:49.920
I'm astonished by this.

12:49.920 --> 12:52.200
Shalom Shapiro is something it takes.

12:52.200 --> 12:56.840
And just so we don't have to take her word for it, Rhea Bhattacharjee of MSNBC managed

12:56.840 --> 12:58.840
to catch part of the event.

12:58.840 --> 13:05.840
So, medical emergency, you guys are taking pictures?

13:05.840 --> 13:06.840
Really?

13:06.840 --> 13:34.880
That's what happens when you're a Nazi.

13:34.880 --> 13:39.100
George Kelly was also on the scene, taking photos during the daytime protests.

13:39.100 --> 13:42.880
He got pictures of violent protesters getting arrested, along with anti-Ben Shapiro chalk

13:42.880 --> 13:44.220
messages on the sidewalk.

13:44.220 --> 13:48.000
You know, guys, if you're going to protest somebody giving a speech at your university,

13:48.000 --> 13:52.040
maybe you should be familiar enough with him that you know how to spell his name.

13:52.040 --> 13:56.140
What is Ben going to try and sell me a libertarian branded Sharpie at this event?

13:56.140 --> 13:59.680
At least the police were actually arresting people this time.

13:59.680 --> 14:03.920
At previous events, somebody higher up prevented the police from stepping in and keeping the

14:03.960 --> 14:08.680
But this time, the police were, as Ben himself put it, unshackled.

14:08.680 --> 14:11.840
Multiple arrests were made for attempting to bring weapons into the protest areas, as

14:11.840 --> 14:15.960
well as battery of a police officer by one very happy hipster girl.

14:15.960 --> 14:18.160
Around dyed hair beware, after all.

14:18.160 --> 14:20.560
Another arrestee was involved in Hillary Clinton's campaign.

14:20.560 --> 14:22.920
I guess she just can't pick a winning side in any fight.

14:22.920 --> 14:26.920
But in the end, the protest was significantly less violent and destructive, largely thanks

14:26.920 --> 14:28.480
to a legitimate police presence.

14:28.480 --> 14:32.040
When it was all said and done, the best the counter protesters got was looking like they're

14:32.040 --> 14:33.860
all having an orgasm in unison.

14:33.860 --> 14:37.980
What actually was it that Ben Shapiro said during his speech that caused such a ridiculous

14:37.980 --> 14:39.900
overreaction from the protesters?

14:39.900 --> 14:43.540
What kind of vile hate speech could he have been spouting to warrant any of this?

14:43.540 --> 14:45.940
Well, let me cut his speech down into an abridged version.

14:45.940 --> 14:49.740
I want to say thank you to the morons who put up that sign across the way.

14:49.740 --> 14:53.140
It says, we say no to your white supremacist bullshit.

14:53.140 --> 14:57.860
Well, I say thank you because I also say no to white supremacist bullshit.

14:57.860 --> 15:05.020
And if you stick around long enough in this speech, you will hear me do exactly that.

15:05.020 --> 15:08.460
The problem is I also say no to your identity politics bullshit.

15:08.460 --> 15:12.120
There's a pathetic new movement arising all over the country, from Sacramento to Berkeley

15:12.120 --> 15:17.420
to Dallas to Charlottesville, and that movement says that speech is violence and must be treated

15:17.420 --> 15:18.420
as such.

15:18.420 --> 15:23.780
Antifa couldn't go anywhere without an ideology that runs broader than Antifa, without a group

15:23.780 --> 15:26.620
of people willing to look the other way.

15:27.140 --> 15:29.940
Well, what is the view that undergirds Antifa?

15:29.940 --> 15:34.020
What's the view that undergirds the hard left, many of whom celebrate Antifa or were doing

15:34.020 --> 15:37.240
so until it became politically unpalatable to do so?

15:37.240 --> 15:41.540
It's a view that America is a terrible, horrible, no good, very bad place.

15:41.540 --> 15:44.360
Now, the truth is that America is an incredible place.

15:44.360 --> 15:45.920
It's the greatest place in the history of the world.

15:45.920 --> 15:49.820
It is the freest, most prosperous country, the most tolerant country in the history of

15:49.820 --> 15:52.840
planet Earth.

15:52.840 --> 15:55.380
This country is an incredible place full of opportunity.

15:55.380 --> 16:00.180
Nobody by and large cares enough about you to stop you from achieving your dreams.

16:00.180 --> 16:03.760
That means in a free country, if you fail, it is probably your own fault.

16:03.760 --> 16:08.060
If it is somebody else's fault, if somebody is actually trying to throw up obstacles in

16:08.060 --> 16:12.960
front of you in a way that is unjust and bigoted, point out the specific instance so we can

16:12.960 --> 16:14.780
all side with you.

16:14.780 --> 16:17.180
We all want to be on the same side.

16:17.180 --> 16:18.380
We all want to help out.

16:18.380 --> 16:22.280
When somebody is a racist and trying to stop you, we all want to sound off and stop that

16:22.280 --> 16:23.280
too.

16:23.280 --> 16:27.440
The idea, however, that America as a whole owns your failure when you can't point to

16:27.440 --> 16:30.240
specific problems does not wash.

16:30.240 --> 16:34.040
Now, listen, you'd be a fool not to acknowledge or a liar not to acknowledge the history of

16:34.040 --> 16:35.440
racism in America.

16:35.440 --> 16:37.620
Everybody acknowledges that if you have half a brain.

16:37.620 --> 16:42.700
Of course, slavery, Jim Crow, awful, evil treatment at the hands of awful, evil people.

16:42.700 --> 16:44.600
We all acknowledge this.

16:44.600 --> 16:48.640
We all acknowledge the collective sin of the United States in promulgating this and the

16:48.640 --> 16:52.960
individual sins, more importantly, of the people who actually promulgated this stuff.

16:52.960 --> 16:53.960
We all get that.

16:53.960 --> 16:55.080
But that's not what we're talking about.

16:55.080 --> 16:59.880
Now we're talking about now because I wasn't born when Jim Crow was in place.

16:59.880 --> 17:01.440
I wasn't an adult when Jim Crow was in place.

17:01.440 --> 17:05.080
I know that I'm not a racist and I know I haven't acted in a racist manner.

17:05.080 --> 17:08.480
And I would bet you money that the people in this room haven't acted in a racist manner,

17:08.480 --> 17:11.760
that they haven't held slaves or voted for Jim Crow.

17:11.760 --> 17:15.000
I will bet you money that is the case.

17:15.000 --> 17:19.200
You cannot fix past injustices with current injustices.

17:19.200 --> 17:23.760
The only way to fix past injustices is with individual freedom.

17:23.760 --> 17:24.760
That's it.

17:24.760 --> 17:25.760
Yeah, that's it.

17:25.760 --> 17:28.900
Just generic conservative and libertarian talking points, all of them qualified with

17:28.900 --> 17:31.240
rebukes of bigotry and valid explanations.

17:31.240 --> 17:35.360
I don't agree with everything Ben Shapiro said during this talk, but not only do I defend

17:35.360 --> 17:38.880
his right to say it, I even think he did a good job at presenting his arguments.

17:38.880 --> 17:42.560
And that's why Ben and people like him are protested so strongly.

17:42.560 --> 17:46.840
Not because he's violent or because he incites violence or because he's racist or sexist

17:46.840 --> 17:48.480
or a white supremacist.

17:48.480 --> 17:51.160
And no, Tariq, he's not faking his Jewishness.

17:51.160 --> 17:54.800
It's because he holds well-reasoned positions that they are ideologically and emotionally

17:54.800 --> 17:59.720
opposed to, and they cannot use appeals to emotion or ideological rhetoric to adequately

17:59.720 --> 18:02.000
combat a position founded in reason.

18:02.000 --> 18:04.560
This doesn't mean that I agree with him, I often don't.

18:04.560 --> 18:09.080
But the only way to argue against his well-reasoned positions are with other well-reasoned positions

18:09.080 --> 18:10.080
of your own.

18:10.080 --> 18:11.580
And these Berkeley protesters?

18:11.580 --> 18:13.880
A lack of reason is probably their biggest failing.

18:13.880 --> 18:20.280
That's why earlier on, this clown said, it's not rationality, it's fascism.

18:20.280 --> 18:24.880
They know that reason is their Achilles heel, so reason must become fascism.

18:24.880 --> 18:26.900
Rational thinkers must become fascists.

18:26.900 --> 18:31.480
And debate between reasonable people holding reasoned yet opposing viewpoints without relying

18:31.480 --> 18:36.380
on ideology must become a hotbed of bigotry, to which the only reaction is violence.

18:36.380 --> 18:38.760
But yeah, Ben's a conservative libertarian.

18:38.760 --> 18:40.600
I'm a left-leaning liberal centrist.

18:40.600 --> 18:42.960
I do agree with him on a few things in his speech.

18:42.960 --> 18:46.760
For example, the current black community situation overwhelmingly being caused by fathers not

18:46.760 --> 18:48.320
sticking around to raise their kids.

18:48.320 --> 18:52.600
Or that the gender pay gap is largely a result of women's choices, not as individuals, but

18:52.600 --> 18:54.140
as a class of millions of people.

18:54.140 --> 18:55.800
Or that free speech must be considered paramount.

18:55.800 --> 18:58.640
However, I disagree with him, for example, on abortion rights.

18:58.640 --> 19:03.160
And it always makes me fucking cringe to watch young lefties go at him over abortion, because

19:03.160 --> 19:06.020
there's always way better arguments than they put forward.

19:06.020 --> 19:07.200
Like this guy, for example.

19:07.200 --> 19:11.480
My question was about abortion, and I just wanted to know, why exactly do you think a

19:11.480 --> 19:15.000
first trimester fetus has moral value?

19:15.000 --> 19:19.200
Okay, so a first trimester fetus has moral value, because whether you consider it a potential

19:19.200 --> 19:24.800
human life or a full-on human life, it has more value than just a cluster of cells.

19:24.800 --> 19:28.520
If left to its natural processes, it will grow into a baby.

19:28.520 --> 19:29.960
So the real question is, where do you draw the line?

19:29.960 --> 19:32.320
So you're gonna draw the line at the heartbeat, because it's very hard to draw the line at

19:32.320 --> 19:33.320
the heartbeat.

19:33.320 --> 19:35.360
There are people who are adults who are alive because of a pacemaker.

19:35.360 --> 19:38.000
They need some sort of outside force generating their heartbeat.

19:38.000 --> 19:39.840
Okay, are you gonna do it based on brain function?

19:39.840 --> 19:41.680
Okay, well, what about people who are in a coma?

19:41.680 --> 19:42.680
Should we just kill them?

19:42.680 --> 19:47.560
Right, the problem is anytime you draw any line other than the inception of the child,

19:47.560 --> 19:51.440
you end up drawing a false line that can also be applied to people who are adults.

19:51.440 --> 19:53.680
So either human life has intrinsic value or it doesn't.

19:53.680 --> 19:56.080
I think we both agree that adult human life has intrinsic value.

19:56.080 --> 19:57.660
Can we start from that premise?

19:57.660 --> 20:05.600
I believe that sentience is what gives something moral value, not necessarily being a human

20:05.600 --> 20:06.600
alone.

20:06.600 --> 20:10.440
Okay, so when you're asleep, can I stab you?

20:10.440 --> 20:13.440
I'm still considered sentient when I'm asleep.

20:13.440 --> 20:17.240
Okay, if you are in a coma from which you may awake, can I stab you?

20:17.240 --> 20:20.240
Well then, no, I guess not.

20:20.240 --> 20:23.560
I'm glad you answered that, because I have no interest in actually murdering you.

20:23.560 --> 20:26.520
But that's still potential sentience and it's still a potential...

20:26.520 --> 20:28.240
I agree, it is potential sentience.

20:28.240 --> 20:29.680
You know what else is potential sentience?

20:29.680 --> 20:30.880
Being a fetus.

20:30.880 --> 20:35.000
He got schooled on the sentient argument, but not because he was wrong, because he conceded

20:35.000 --> 20:36.800
a point that he shouldn't have conceded.

20:36.800 --> 20:39.300
First of all, he wasn't using the term sentience correctly.

20:39.300 --> 20:42.600
Sentience is the capacity to feel, perceive, or experience subjectively.

20:42.600 --> 20:45.780
And this is something that almost every living thing can do on some level.

20:45.780 --> 20:52.200
It's very clear to anybody that, for example, a dog or a cat can feel, perceive, and experience

20:52.200 --> 20:53.200
subjectively.

20:53.200 --> 20:57.400
In fact, an argument from sentience is actually more helpful for the anti-abortion side of

20:57.400 --> 21:00.480
things, because suffering can only exist if sentience exists.

21:00.480 --> 21:04.740
What most normies call sentience, generally due to the common misuse of the term in Star

21:04.740 --> 21:09.600
Trek and other forms of sci-fi pop culture, is actually called sapience, and it's clear

21:09.600 --> 21:12.920
from the context of the debate he was referring to sapience.

21:12.920 --> 21:16.840
Sapience refers to a consciousness that is beyond the practical wisdom of survival, the

21:16.840 --> 21:20.360
stuff that animals have, the stuff that comes from feeling, perceiving, and experiencing

21:20.360 --> 21:21.360
the world.

21:21.360 --> 21:26.760
It also encompasses self-knowledge, interconnectedness, theoretical wisdom, conditioned orientation

21:26.760 --> 21:30.520
to the states of the mind, things like judgment, compassion, and culture.

21:30.520 --> 21:33.520
And this is where he actually has one over Ben Shapiro.

21:33.520 --> 21:37.360
An adult human does not lose sapience when they fall asleep or fall into a coma, and

21:37.360 --> 21:39.560
a fetus clearly doesn't yet have sapience.

21:39.560 --> 21:43.520
But the problem with that argument is that you can also say that, say, a six-month-old

21:43.520 --> 21:45.360
also doesn't have sapience.

21:45.360 --> 21:48.680
If sapience were the judge of when it is no longer acceptable to have an abortion, the

21:48.680 --> 21:51.760
date may very well be set several years after birth.

21:51.760 --> 21:56.320
And even if that makes logical sense, I don't think you're seriously going to find people

21:56.320 --> 21:58.360
willing to accept that benchmark in society.

21:58.360 --> 22:02.760
This is why, for example, we find the McDonald's manager who decided to give birth in the bathroom

22:02.760 --> 22:07.120
and flush the kid down the toilet, claiming the kid was a miscarriage, to be an absolute

22:07.120 --> 22:08.120
monster.

22:08.120 --> 22:10.680
And Ben's arguments for the other guidelines are convincing, too.

22:10.680 --> 22:14.660
If we use the lack of a heartbeat in an underdeveloped fetus, that would remove personhood rights

22:14.660 --> 22:18.120
from the people who naturally lack heartbeats and require pacemakers or other marvels of

22:18.120 --> 22:20.240
medical technology in order to stay alive.

22:20.240 --> 22:24.160
If we use the birthday as a guideline, even though, really, we use the birthday for a

22:24.160 --> 22:27.720
lot of other guidelines in society, that would mean a viable baby in the days leading

22:27.720 --> 22:32.280
up to a natural birth still lacks personhood rights, and can be aborted as a non-person.

22:32.280 --> 22:36.200
And if we take the feminist perspective, that the framing of the question itself is wrong,

22:36.200 --> 22:40.000
that the issue isn't the personhood rights of the baby, but the bodily autonomy of the

22:40.000 --> 22:44.960
mother, while that argument is actually pretty sound, it feels like it's dodging the question.

22:44.960 --> 22:47.880
But there's also a problem with Ben's argument as well, and let me play back where

22:47.880 --> 22:48.880
he brings it up.

22:48.880 --> 22:52.600
Okay, so a first trimester fetus has moral value, because whether you consider it a potential

22:52.600 --> 22:58.200
human life or a full-on human life, it has more value than just a cluster of cells.

22:58.200 --> 23:02.080
If left to its natural processes, it will grow into a baby.

23:02.080 --> 23:06.840
Believe it or not, a fertilized egg, when left to its natural processes, may or may

23:06.840 --> 23:08.300
not become a baby.

23:08.300 --> 23:13.720
In the John Hopkins Manual of Gynecology and Obstetrics, I think it's pronounced obstetrics,

23:13.720 --> 23:20.360
4th edition, on page 438, it states that 30-40% of all conceptions result in miscarriage,

23:20.360 --> 23:24.520
and that 80% of those losses happen before 12 weeks in, before any symptoms of pregnancy

23:24.520 --> 23:25.520
occur.

23:25.520 --> 23:28.840
In the study, Second Trimester Pregnancy Loss, published in the American Family Physician,

23:28.840 --> 23:34.080
it is estimated that as many as half of all fertilized eggs may spontaneously abort themselves

23:34.080 --> 23:36.180
long before the woman knows she is even pregnant.

23:36.180 --> 23:41.760
This chance increases if within the first month of conception, the woman smokes, drinks,

23:41.760 --> 23:45.440
makes hot baths, or uses a hot tub, or exercises.

23:45.440 --> 23:49.920
The honest truth is, and this speaks to a much larger biological and evolutionary conversation

23:49.920 --> 23:54.400
beyond the scope of this video, humans are imperfect creatures, and our stuff doesn't

23:54.400 --> 23:56.300
always work perfectly every time.

23:56.300 --> 24:00.540
When left to our natural processes, our eyes are intended to see at a specific level of

24:00.540 --> 24:02.880
detail and distance, but they often don't.

24:02.880 --> 24:07.080
When left to our natural processes, our digestive system is meant to break down fuel and pass

24:07.080 --> 24:09.440
solid waste, but it often doesn't.

24:09.440 --> 24:13.320
When left to our natural processes, parts of our bodies are clearly intended to perform

24:13.320 --> 24:15.000
specific functions.

24:15.000 --> 24:16.140
Sometimes they do.

24:16.140 --> 24:19.000
Sometimes we're born with a defect, and they don't work properly.

24:19.000 --> 24:21.800
Sometimes we abuse our bodies, and they don't work properly.

24:21.800 --> 24:25.080
Sometimes we unintentionally disable our bodies through innocuous behavior.

24:25.080 --> 24:28.280
And sometimes they just don't do what they're supposed to do.

24:28.280 --> 24:32.440
Ben's argument is that if a fetus is left to its natural processes, Ben's argument

24:32.440 --> 24:36.440
that if a fetus is left to its natural processes, it will become a baby is flawed.

24:36.440 --> 24:41.080
A more accurate statement is that a fetus is designed to grow into a baby, and that

24:41.080 --> 24:45.600
if given the chance, it may well do just that, but that it's not guaranteed, and it may

24:45.600 --> 24:49.840
be just as likely for the zygote to disassemble itself and disperse into a slightly heavier

24:49.840 --> 24:52.520
than average period through no fault of anyone.

24:52.520 --> 24:56.480
It's maddening to think about sometimes, but biology isn't a perfect science like

24:56.480 --> 24:57.480
physics.

24:57.480 --> 25:01.240
It's still clearly a science, of course, but it's not as simple as A leading to B

25:01.240 --> 25:03.080
leading to C all the time.

25:03.080 --> 25:07.280
So when Ben dismisses the argument of the heartbeat or the argument of birth, based

25:07.280 --> 25:11.400
on how it may affect adults who find themselves in similar situations, his conception argument

25:11.400 --> 25:13.560
can also be dismissed on those merits.

25:13.560 --> 25:18.580
If life begins at conception, and we confer personhood rights to an egg fertilized, say,

25:18.580 --> 25:22.880
one hour ago, who is to blame for the murder of that egg when the woman's body rejects

25:22.880 --> 25:24.180
it five days later?

25:24.180 --> 25:25.800
Who would even know that a murder had occurred?

25:25.800 --> 25:29.880
And if you think that this is an unreal scenario, that something like this would just never

25:29.880 --> 25:30.880
happen?

25:30.880 --> 25:33.980
Let's take a look at the court ruling in Alabama that made all women personally to

25:33.980 --> 25:38.320
blame for any harm their actions may cause to a fetus from the moment of conception.

25:38.320 --> 25:43.820
In Alabama, if you're a woman and you smoke, drink, drive above the speed limit, step into

25:43.820 --> 25:49.600
a hot tub, or do anything that may cause a fetus harm, including both harm after birth

25:49.600 --> 25:54.320
and early term miscarriages, even miscarriages unknown to you that they are happening, even

25:54.320 --> 25:58.760
though potentially half of all pregnancies naturally end in such a miscarriage, you are

25:58.760 --> 26:00.040
legally liable.

26:00.040 --> 26:04.300
And because to them life begins at conception, and there is no accurate way of detecting

26:04.300 --> 26:08.880
pregnancy that early, it is simply assumed by the law that all women not currently on

26:08.880 --> 26:13.260
their period are in a classification called potentially pregnant, and may be charged by

26:13.260 --> 26:17.640
police for potentially endangering their unborn child's life for drinking or smoking while

26:17.640 --> 26:18.760
not on the rag.

26:18.760 --> 26:23.140
In my opinion, this is an unacceptable state of affairs, and it stems from accepting the

26:23.140 --> 26:26.140
life begins at conception argument as a legal basis.

26:26.180 --> 26:29.700
As an aside, the libertarian demon sitting on my soldier is telling me as I write this

26:29.700 --> 26:32.620
script that we should take up the Ferengi's position on pregnancy.

26:56.140 --> 27:12.040
Yeah, why not?

27:12.040 --> 27:13.660
Let's treat abortion like an eviction.

27:13.660 --> 27:16.980
A landlord certainly isn't concerned that a tenant may die when they evict them after

27:16.980 --> 27:18.700
nine months of unpaid rent.

27:18.700 --> 27:19.800
Why should a woman be?

27:19.800 --> 27:23.860
I've spent way too much of this video talking about abortion, when it's about Ben Shapiro's

27:23.860 --> 27:24.860
speech.

27:24.900 --> 27:29.040
It's just that this back and forth is probably the most blatant example of Ben's flawed reasoning.

27:29.040 --> 27:32.860
The questioner had great avenues with which to attack Ben's position that he let slip

27:32.860 --> 27:35.540
by, and I was actually pulling my hair out watching this.

27:35.540 --> 27:37.540
Oh well, at least he did better than this woman.

27:54.860 --> 27:57.900
put on trial for a couple of different reasons.

27:57.900 --> 28:02.960
So the first reason is because I don't think that it is effective in deterring abortion

28:02.960 --> 28:06.280
to put women on trial for the killing of the unborn.

28:06.280 --> 28:09.560
The second reason is because I think that we in our society have unfortunately gotten

28:09.560 --> 28:13.760
to such a point that an entire generation have been indoctrinated to believe, particularly

28:13.760 --> 28:16.720
an entire generation of women, since that's what we're talking about here, have been indoctrinated

28:16.720 --> 28:19.880
to believe that a baby is a polyp, and so when they remove it, I'm not sure there's

28:19.880 --> 28:24.540
the actual mens rea necessary, the actual criminal intent necessary for a prosecution.

28:24.540 --> 28:28.420
So when we're talking about, you know, the typical pro-life position here has been that

28:28.420 --> 28:33.580
the woman is a victim in abortion nearly as much as the baby is, that there is an entire

28:33.580 --> 28:39.020
abortion industry that is geared toward teaching women that babies are not babies and that

28:39.020 --> 28:43.220
getting a baby aborted is in fact a betterment of their life.

28:43.220 --> 28:46.940
So no, I'm not in favor of prosecuting women for abortions.

28:46.940 --> 28:50.940
But I mean, you know, there are a lot of women who do have the intent, right?

28:50.940 --> 28:55.500
Like if someone, if a woman goes to an abortion clinic, they are ordering the murder of their

28:55.500 --> 28:59.460
child, in your opinion, like what you would say, so do they not have the mens rea?

28:59.460 --> 29:04.700
So I just gave you, I gave you two reasons, one a public policy one, and one, like, you'd

29:04.700 --> 29:09.460
have to show me, you'd really have to show me the case of a woman who went in there and

29:09.460 --> 29:12.100
said, I know this is a baby, cut its brains out.

29:12.100 --> 29:15.580
I like, if that's happening, then that is infanticide.

29:15.580 --> 29:18.740
I mean, that's like, wouldn't you acknowledge, I mean, if a woman walked in with a baby that

29:18.740 --> 29:22.340
was one day old and said, here's my baby, kill it.

29:22.340 --> 29:23.340
Wouldn't you put her on trial?

29:23.340 --> 29:26.240
But that's, that's not what we're talking about in the vast majority of abortions.

29:26.240 --> 29:29.980
The truth is, unfortunately, that women don't actually believe they are killing a child.

29:29.980 --> 29:33.700
They actually believe they're killing something that is non-human and is the same thing as

29:33.700 --> 29:36.700
removing a tumor or something.

29:36.700 --> 29:40.020
So are you saying that you don't think abortion is murder then?

29:40.020 --> 29:41.540
Because I know I'm not saying that at all.

29:41.540 --> 29:45.100
I'm saying that women who, I'm saying that the vast majority of women who obtain abortions

29:45.100 --> 29:49.700
don't think that abortion is murder and intense is a, is a, is a fundamental element in any

29:49.700 --> 29:50.980
criminal prosecution.

29:50.980 --> 29:52.900
I feel, I feel horrible for women who have abortions.

29:52.900 --> 29:53.980
I think that it's terrible for them.

29:53.980 --> 29:56.420
I think it's, I think it's a lot worse for the baby.

29:56.420 --> 29:57.420
Yes, yes.

29:57.420 --> 29:58.860
Just keep talking past him.

29:58.860 --> 30:00.900
I'm sure that will make your argument more convincing.

30:00.900 --> 30:04.700
I know how it looks when two men have a more productive conversation on abortion than a

30:04.700 --> 30:09.540
man and a woman, but Jesus lady need to have an argument and not just a moral pontification.

30:09.540 --> 30:13.980
In any case, I'd highly recommend you watch Ben's speech and the Q and A section afterward,

30:13.980 --> 30:15.220
even if you disagree with him.

30:15.220 --> 30:20.740
A few days before the event, U of C Berkeley's chancellor, Carol Christ said, call toxic

30:20.740 --> 30:22.240
speech out for what it is.

30:22.240 --> 30:25.980
Don't shout it down for in shouting it down, you collude to the narrative that universities

30:25.980 --> 30:29.860
are not open to all speech, respond to hate speech with more speech.

30:29.860 --> 30:33.320
And this is probably the best response to Ben Shapiro and others like him.

30:33.320 --> 30:37.060
Even if you vehemently disagree with their positions, he's not a hate monger, he's not

30:37.060 --> 30:38.240
a bigot.

30:38.240 --> 30:41.240
He generally doesn't hold positions that aren't ideological in nature.

30:41.240 --> 30:45.400
If you disagree, challenge him, because if you ignore him, then you can't present your

30:45.400 --> 30:46.600
counter arguments.

30:46.600 --> 30:50.000
It may end up being a tradition to include a Game of Thrones quote in every single video

30:50.000 --> 30:53.700
that I do, considering how well they seem to have fit in in the past few.

30:53.700 --> 30:57.120
When you tear out a man's tongue, you are not proving him a liar.

30:57.120 --> 30:59.500
You're only telling the world that you fear what he might say.

30:59.500 --> 31:02.040
I don't fear what Ben Shapiro has to say.

31:02.040 --> 31:04.360
I disagree with it, but I don't fear it.

31:04.360 --> 31:08.400
In fact, my greatest criticism of Ben Shapiro's speech is that he recycled the entire thing

31:08.400 --> 31:10.760
from his appearance on the Joe Rogan podcast.

31:10.760 --> 31:14.600
You'd think for $600,000 in security, he could have written something new.

31:14.600 --> 31:20.440
Alright guys, that does it for me.

31:20.440 --> 31:21.440
Thanks for watching today.

31:21.440 --> 31:26.480
I was actually about two thirds done another video when the Ben Shapiro thing went down,

31:26.480 --> 31:28.720
so I put that on pause and did this one instead.

31:28.720 --> 31:31.760
I'm going to return to that other project and release it in short order.

31:31.760 --> 31:34.120
Special thanks to everybody who supports this show on Patreon.

31:34.120 --> 31:36.220
