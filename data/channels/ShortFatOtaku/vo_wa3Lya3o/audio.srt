1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,240
Berkeley is no stranger to protests.

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:06,800
In the 1960s, U of C Berkeley was the center point of the free speech movement,

3
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:11,440
with iconic photographs emerging from the period of hippie students holding up free speech signs.

4
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:15,760
In the 2010s, U of C Berkeley is also a center point of the free speech movement,

5
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:17,280
though in a different way.

6
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:21,440
Iconic photos now consist of hipster students burning free speech signs.

7
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:26,240
Since Trump's election, U of C Berkeley, like other left-leaning locations in the United States,

8
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:28,240
have collectively lost their minds.

9
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:33,360
On February 1st, when conservative talking head and flamboyantly gay Trump supporter,

10
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:37,040
Milo Yiannopoulos, was scheduled to give a speech on campus,

11
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:41,520
approximately 1500 people showed up to peacefully protest, as is their right to do so.

12
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:46,160
However, approximately 150 members of the Black Bloc, dressed head to toe in black

13
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:48,480
in order to appear threatening and conceal their identities,

14
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:51,680
infiltrated the crowd with weapons and began to incite violence.

15
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:56,000
These individuals, who claimed to be part of either Antifa or BAM,

16
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,240
otherwise known as by any means necessary,

17
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:00,480
attacked both the crowd and the police,

18
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:03,440
threw fireworks and lit the place on fucking fire.

19
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:06,160
After Milo's event was canceled due to the violence,

20
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:09,280
the crowd moved off campus into the city of Berkeley proper,

21
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:11,200
damaging property in the downtown area.

22
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:16,800
On March 4th, the aptly named March for Trump went down at multiple locations across the USA.

23
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:21,360
As expected, the Berkeley protest turned violent even before it began,

24
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,920
with Black Bloc members attacking the pro-Trump camp.

25
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:27,200
This is when Based Stickman first became known to the internet.

26
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:30,160
On April 15th, the battle for Berkeley began,

27
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:34,000
having realized that the reason the Black Bloc had been so effective at turning the

28
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,760
other rallies violent was because they came armed and prepared for a fight.

29
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:41,920
So the right-wing group the Oath Keepers organized a pro-Trump rally

30
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:44,080
and also decided to come prepared for a fight.

31
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:48,720
The ensuing event was a shit show, with both sides repeatedly clashing with weapons,

32
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:52,080
and multiple arrests and confiscations made by the police,

33
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:55,520
most notably a former professor attacking a student with a bike lock.

34
00:01:55,520 --> 00:02:01,200
On August 27th, between 2,000 and 4,000 people attended a rally against hate,

35
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:06,240
which remained largely peaceful until 100 Black Bloc members smuggled in weapons,

36
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:09,200
bypassing the 500-strong police security checks,

37
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:12,560
and began attacking the small number of right-wing counter-protesters.

38
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:16,320
The Berkeley police chief ordered his officers to abandon the park,

39
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:20,480
stating that having the police confront the Black Bloc would have only led to more violence.

40
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:24,960
Antifa members also threatened to attack journalists documenting their actions at this event.

41
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:28,880
If I haven't made it clear yet, Berkeley is a fucking powder keg,

42
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:33,040
and the students would rather restrict free speech in what they'd call extreme cases,

43
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,800
instead of letting it flourish.

44
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:40,640
So when conservative pundit Ben Shapiro decided to give a speech at UFC Berkeley on September 14th,

45
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:44,000
I don't think a single person was surprised that counter-protests sprung up,

46
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
with some of them erupting into violence.

47
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,840
Let's take a look at what went down.

48
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,240
Here's the chant of some of the counter-protesters.

49
00:02:50,240 --> 00:03:01,120
If you couldn't make that out, they were saying,

50
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,440
speech is violent, we will not be silent.

51
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:07,920
Now, I've discussed the slippery slope of problems that come about when speech is equated to violence,

52
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,800
when criticism of idea is equated to attack on a person,

53
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,280
most notably in my video, The Free Speech Problem.

54
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,280
Here's the cliff notes of my criticism.

55
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:18,560
If speech is considered to be violent, then offense is assault.

56
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:22,880
And if a hypothetical right to not be offended is like the right to not be assaulted,

57
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:25,440
or if it is more paramount than the right to free speech,

58
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:28,400
then any person can censor any speech they like,

59
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:31,040
even legitimate criticism on the grounds of offense.

60
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:34,720
But even beyond all that, isn't your chant completely self-defeating?

61
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:38,960
If speech is violent, then the one thing you should be is silent, you idiots.

62
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:42,240
Put your fist in the air with me and repeat after me.

63
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:47,600
In the name of humanity, we refuse.

64
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:56,080
To accept a fascist America, we will not be silent.

65
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:05,360
We will not accommodate, we will not collaborate, we will not normalize it.

66
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:13,840
We will rise up until these fascists are off our streets,

67
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:19,360
out of our campuses, and out of the White House,

68
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,560
November 4th.

69
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:36,960
We come in the streets and stay in the streets until Trump and Pence and their whole regime

70
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:48,560
are gone, night after night, day after day, November 4th, it begins.

71
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,360
I wonder if these fools realize that a fascist regime wouldn't actually

72
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,760
let them say what they're saying or do what they're doing.

73
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:02,080
Oh well, November 4th video coming up.

74
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:05,840
Thank you Antifa for maintaining my burgeoning YouTube career.

75
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:09,120
Here's a U of C Berkeley grad student complaining that first-year students

76
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:12,720
shouldn't have to be exposed to police or security or barricades on campus.

77
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,080
I'm just a poet, okay?

78
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:21,440
But I walk into my classroom with freshmen just now, two hours ago, and they ask me,

79
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,000
why are there barricades on campus?

80
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,480
Why is there a police force on campus?

81
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:29,360
These people don't know, this has nothing to do with them.

82
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:35,440
And the campus is completely being taken away from students who have every right to access.

83
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:43,760
I don't think my students should have to be confronted with a

84
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,600
militarized police force on campus.

85
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:51,280
I don't think they should have to face threats, potential violence, mayhem,

86
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,600
helicopters circling almost every week.

87
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:59,200
Well, sorry sweetheart, but these first-year students are legally adults.

88
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:01,200
And if they can't cope with reality yet,

89
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:03,760
university is probably the best place to start learning that skill.

90
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:07,280
And who's to blame?

91
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,240
I think chancellor.

92
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:17,280
Oh yeah, yeah, it's the university chancellor's fault for allowing Ben Shapiro to give his talk.

93
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:20,400
It's not people who have threatened him and incited violence for the past 10 months

94
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,880
at any high-profile conservative gathering, oh no.

95
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:27,360
I mean, Ben might have given a talk at U of C Berkeley back in 2016

96
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,440
and not needed a single bit of security at all,

97
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,000
while this time the university had to spend $600,000 on security officers,

98
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,120
on bodyguards, on barricades and other defensive measures.

99
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,560
That's all just Ben's fault.

100
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:42,080
If Ben just wasn't there, there would be no need for violence at all.

101
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:46,240
And I just have to ask, what was Ben Shapiro wearing when she was raped?

102
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:52,400
So under the guise of free speech, they're trying to make their events seem legitimate

103
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:56,320
and they're trying to sow doubts about what's the right moral thing to do.

104
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:01,920
And they always invoke John Stuart Mill about their free speech arguments,

105
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:06,720
which means that apparently you're able to say whatever you want,

106
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:10,000
but you can't go to physical violence.

107
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:11,680
Okay, fine.

108
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,760
Free marketplace of ideas.

109
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:15,840
Every idea has equal value.

110
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:16,640
That's bullshit.

111
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:22,080
You don't understand what the free marketplace of ideas is.

112
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,760
And I know you don't understand it,

113
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:27,680
because the free marketplace of ideas is not about every idea having equal value.

114
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:32,080
Free marketplace of ideas is about giving every idea a platform

115
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:33,920
and then allowing the ones with the greatest value

116
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,760
to naturally convince people through their merits.

117
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:40,480
It's about disproving bad ideas, not preventing them from being heard.

118
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:43,280
And I'm really sick of all this faulty reasoning

119
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:46,080
and people trying to pull blinds over other people's eyes

120
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:51,120
and trying to influence naive young students who don't know what any of this is about.

121
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:55,600
Okay, Ben Shapiro might have gone to Harvard Law School

122
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,120
and he can sound reasonable,

123
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:02,720
but it's up to us to teach people how to go past the seeming facades.

124
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:06,080
It's not rationality, it's fascism.

125
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,960
It's irrational and it's dangerous.

126
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:11,520
You heard it here, the bald-faced truth.

127
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,600
This might as well be their fucking slogan.

128
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,920
It's not rationality, it's fascism.

129
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:18,960
When somebody talks about rationality, they see it as fascist.

130
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:23,760
Presumed because their ideology is irrational and can be defeated by reasoned thinking.

131
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:25,440
Lauren Southern was down in the crowd,

132
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,920
recording things on the street as she is known to do.

133
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:29,520
Things were actually pretty quiet,

134
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:32,640
with Lauren making quips to her livestream chat room every once in a while,

135
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,400
until she bumped into this woman.

136
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:38,640
That's Yvette Falarca, and there's enough on her to be its entire fucking video.

137
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:39,600
Maybe in the future.

138
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,200
But for now, here's what you need to know.

139
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:45,040
She's a big part of the radical violent left-wing group by any means necessary.

140
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,480
Let's see what she has to say for herself.

141
00:08:48,960 --> 00:09:08,000
Uh oh, she's noticed you, Lauren.

142
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,720
She's noticed that you're half her age and twice as good looking.

143
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:13,680
She's blaming you for her squandering her amazing Asian genes.

144
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:28,000
I'm a lot to walk here.

145
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:50,880
Wait wait wait, what the fuck is on this guy's head?

146
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:53,520
Did he show up to the protest cosplaying as Emo Toad?

147
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:24,160
To somebody on the outside, here's what this looks and sounds like.

148
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:27,760
This guy here, in the camo hat, he's doing his best to talk.

149
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,760
And these people are simply chanting past him.

150
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:32,320
They're intimidating and united, sure.

151
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,600
But they're also mindless.

152
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:59,120
Oh jeez, I hope she didn't leave a grease stain, Lauren.

153
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:02,080
Celeste Paradise was attacked while at the protest as well.

154
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:28,720
She gave her account of events to Scrabblebag Shooter in a video interview.

155
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:31,760
This is the first time I've ever seen a girl run off with a sign, and I tried to hold onto

156
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:32,760
it.

157
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:37,720
And as I was dragged away holding onto it, two guys just grabbed me, spun me away from

158
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:41,560
the girl who ran off with the sign, and I was in the middle of the crowd all of a sudden.

159
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:45,200
And then they slammed me down, and my head hit the pavement twice.

160
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,200
It was awful.

161
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:48,920
I didn't trip, you know, it was awful.

162
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:54,000
And then I couldn't see for a minute, I was dizzy, I couldn't get up right away, and by

163
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,480
the time I could even think about it, it was this maelstrom of people.

164
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,480
But it was awful.

165
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:02,400
I got separated from my friends, everyone was screaming at me.

166
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:05,800
There were no friendlies, the cops were all around me, and it was a terrible position

167
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:11,720
because everyone was just yelling at me and taking pictures with their phones and not

168
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:12,720
trying to help me.

169
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:13,720
I just wanted to die.

170
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:14,720
I was so embarrassed.

171
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:15,720
I understand, but it's not your fault.

172
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:21,960
You definitely don't need to feel embarrassed without disturbing a victim like that.

173
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:27,840
And a lot of press came up to me, rather from Channel 4 came up, all kinds of different

174
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:33,160
bloggers, and they all seemed astonished that I would have a sign that said what it said.

175
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:37,040
They were astonished that you would have a sign that was welcoming Dan Shapiro, and you

176
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:39,840
were in the middle of downtown, like a first world American city.

177
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:45,480
Yeah, like the chancellor of this campus invited this person to speak, and I had a sign saying,

178
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:47,480
yeah, Shalom Shapiro, we welcome you.

179
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:48,920
And everyone was like, you're brave.

180
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:49,920
I'm astonished by this.

181
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:52,200
Shalom Shapiro is something it takes.

182
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:56,840
And just so we don't have to take her word for it, Rhea Bhattacharjee of MSNBC managed

183
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:58,840
to catch part of the event.

184
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:05,840
So, medical emergency, you guys are taking pictures?

185
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:06,840
Really?

186
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:34,880
That's what happens when you're a Nazi.

187
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:39,100
George Kelly was also on the scene, taking photos during the daytime protests.

188
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:42,880
He got pictures of violent protesters getting arrested, along with anti-Ben Shapiro chalk

189
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,220
messages on the sidewalk.

190
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:48,000
You know, guys, if you're going to protest somebody giving a speech at your university,

191
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,040
maybe you should be familiar enough with him that you know how to spell his name.

192
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:56,140
What is Ben going to try and sell me a libertarian branded Sharpie at this event?

193
00:13:56,140 --> 00:13:59,680
At least the police were actually arresting people this time.

194
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:03,920
At previous events, somebody higher up prevented the police from stepping in and keeping the

195
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:08,680
But this time, the police were, as Ben himself put it, unshackled.

196
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:11,840
Multiple arrests were made for attempting to bring weapons into the protest areas, as

197
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:15,960
well as battery of a police officer by one very happy hipster girl.

198
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:18,160
Around dyed hair beware, after all.

199
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:20,560
Another arrestee was involved in Hillary Clinton's campaign.

200
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:22,920
I guess she just can't pick a winning side in any fight.

201
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:26,920
But in the end, the protest was significantly less violent and destructive, largely thanks

202
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:28,480
to a legitimate police presence.

203
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:32,040
When it was all said and done, the best the counter protesters got was looking like they're

204
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:33,860
all having an orgasm in unison.

205
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:37,980
What actually was it that Ben Shapiro said during his speech that caused such a ridiculous

206
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:39,900
overreaction from the protesters?

207
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:43,540
What kind of vile hate speech could he have been spouting to warrant any of this?

208
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:45,940
Well, let me cut his speech down into an abridged version.

209
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:49,740
I want to say thank you to the morons who put up that sign across the way.

210
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:53,140
It says, we say no to your white supremacist bullshit.

211
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:57,860
Well, I say thank you because I also say no to white supremacist bullshit.

212
00:14:57,860 --> 00:15:05,020
And if you stick around long enough in this speech, you will hear me do exactly that.

213
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:08,460
The problem is I also say no to your identity politics bullshit.

214
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:12,120
There's a pathetic new movement arising all over the country, from Sacramento to Berkeley

215
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:17,420
to Dallas to Charlottesville, and that movement says that speech is violence and must be treated

216
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:18,420
as such.

217
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:23,780
Antifa couldn't go anywhere without an ideology that runs broader than Antifa, without a group

218
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:26,620
of people willing to look the other way.

219
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:29,940
Well, what is the view that undergirds Antifa?

220
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:34,020
What's the view that undergirds the hard left, many of whom celebrate Antifa or were doing

221
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:37,240
so until it became politically unpalatable to do so?

222
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:41,540
It's a view that America is a terrible, horrible, no good, very bad place.

223
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:44,360
Now, the truth is that America is an incredible place.

224
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:45,920
It's the greatest place in the history of the world.

225
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:49,820
It is the freest, most prosperous country, the most tolerant country in the history of

226
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:52,840
planet Earth.

227
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:55,380
This country is an incredible place full of opportunity.

228
00:15:55,380 --> 00:16:00,180
Nobody by and large cares enough about you to stop you from achieving your dreams.

229
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:03,760
That means in a free country, if you fail, it is probably your own fault.

230
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:08,060
If it is somebody else's fault, if somebody is actually trying to throw up obstacles in

231
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:12,960
front of you in a way that is unjust and bigoted, point out the specific instance so we can

232
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:14,780
all side with you.

233
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:17,180
We all want to be on the same side.

234
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:18,380
We all want to help out.

235
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:22,280
When somebody is a racist and trying to stop you, we all want to sound off and stop that

236
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:23,280
too.

237
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:27,440
The idea, however, that America as a whole owns your failure when you can't point to

238
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:30,240
specific problems does not wash.

239
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:34,040
Now, listen, you'd be a fool not to acknowledge or a liar not to acknowledge the history of

240
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:35,440
racism in America.

241
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:37,620
Everybody acknowledges that if you have half a brain.

242
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:42,700
Of course, slavery, Jim Crow, awful, evil treatment at the hands of awful, evil people.

243
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:44,600
We all acknowledge this.

244
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:48,640
We all acknowledge the collective sin of the United States in promulgating this and the

245
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:52,960
individual sins, more importantly, of the people who actually promulgated this stuff.

246
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:53,960
We all get that.

247
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:55,080
But that's not what we're talking about.

248
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:59,880
Now we're talking about now because I wasn't born when Jim Crow was in place.

249
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:01,440
I wasn't an adult when Jim Crow was in place.

250
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:05,080
I know that I'm not a racist and I know I haven't acted in a racist manner.

251
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:08,480
And I would bet you money that the people in this room haven't acted in a racist manner,

252
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:11,760
that they haven't held slaves or voted for Jim Crow.

253
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:15,000
I will bet you money that is the case.

254
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:19,200
You cannot fix past injustices with current injustices.

255
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:23,760
The only way to fix past injustices is with individual freedom.

256
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:24,760
That's it.

257
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:25,760
Yeah, that's it.

258
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:28,900
Just generic conservative and libertarian talking points, all of them qualified with

259
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:31,240
rebukes of bigotry and valid explanations.

260
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:35,360
I don't agree with everything Ben Shapiro said during this talk, but not only do I defend

261
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:38,880
his right to say it, I even think he did a good job at presenting his arguments.

262
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:42,560
And that's why Ben and people like him are protested so strongly.

263
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:46,840
Not because he's violent or because he incites violence or because he's racist or sexist

264
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:48,480
or a white supremacist.

265
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:51,160
And no, Tariq, he's not faking his Jewishness.

266
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:54,800
It's because he holds well-reasoned positions that they are ideologically and emotionally

267
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:59,720
opposed to, and they cannot use appeals to emotion or ideological rhetoric to adequately

268
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:02,000
combat a position founded in reason.

269
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,560
This doesn't mean that I agree with him, I often don't.

270
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:09,080
But the only way to argue against his well-reasoned positions are with other well-reasoned positions

271
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:10,080
of your own.

272
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,580
And these Berkeley protesters?

273
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:13,880
A lack of reason is probably their biggest failing.

274
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:20,280
That's why earlier on, this clown said, it's not rationality, it's fascism.

275
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:24,880
They know that reason is their Achilles heel, so reason must become fascism.

276
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,900
Rational thinkers must become fascists.

277
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:31,480
And debate between reasonable people holding reasoned yet opposing viewpoints without relying

278
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:36,380
on ideology must become a hotbed of bigotry, to which the only reaction is violence.

279
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:38,760
But yeah, Ben's a conservative libertarian.

280
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:40,600
I'm a left-leaning liberal centrist.

281
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:42,960
I do agree with him on a few things in his speech.

282
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:46,760
For example, the current black community situation overwhelmingly being caused by fathers not

283
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:48,320
sticking around to raise their kids.

284
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:52,600
Or that the gender pay gap is largely a result of women's choices, not as individuals, but

285
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:54,140
as a class of millions of people.

286
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:55,800
Or that free speech must be considered paramount.

287
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:58,640
However, I disagree with him, for example, on abortion rights.

288
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:03,160
And it always makes me fucking cringe to watch young lefties go at him over abortion, because

289
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:06,020
there's always way better arguments than they put forward.

290
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:07,200
Like this guy, for example.

291
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:11,480
My question was about abortion, and I just wanted to know, why exactly do you think a

292
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:15,000
first trimester fetus has moral value?

293
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:19,200
Okay, so a first trimester fetus has moral value, because whether you consider it a potential

294
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:24,800
human life or a full-on human life, it has more value than just a cluster of cells.

295
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:28,520
If left to its natural processes, it will grow into a baby.

296
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:29,960
So the real question is, where do you draw the line?

297
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:32,320
So you're gonna draw the line at the heartbeat, because it's very hard to draw the line at

298
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:33,320
the heartbeat.

299
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:35,360
There are people who are adults who are alive because of a pacemaker.

300
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:38,000
They need some sort of outside force generating their heartbeat.

301
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,840
Okay, are you gonna do it based on brain function?

302
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:41,680
Okay, well, what about people who are in a coma?

303
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:42,680
Should we just kill them?

304
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:47,560
Right, the problem is anytime you draw any line other than the inception of the child,

305
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:51,440
you end up drawing a false line that can also be applied to people who are adults.

306
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,680
So either human life has intrinsic value or it doesn't.

307
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:56,080
I think we both agree that adult human life has intrinsic value.

308
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:57,660
Can we start from that premise?

309
00:19:57,660 --> 00:20:05,600
I believe that sentience is what gives something moral value, not necessarily being a human

310
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:06,600
alone.

311
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:10,440
Okay, so when you're asleep, can I stab you?

312
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:13,440
I'm still considered sentient when I'm asleep.

313
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:17,240
Okay, if you are in a coma from which you may awake, can I stab you?

314
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:20,240
Well then, no, I guess not.

315
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:23,560
I'm glad you answered that, because I have no interest in actually murdering you.

316
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:26,520
But that's still potential sentience and it's still a potential...

317
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:28,240
I agree, it is potential sentience.

318
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:29,680
You know what else is potential sentience?

319
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:30,880
Being a fetus.

320
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:35,000
He got schooled on the sentient argument, but not because he was wrong, because he conceded

321
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,800
a point that he shouldn't have conceded.

322
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:39,300
First of all, he wasn't using the term sentience correctly.

323
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:42,600
Sentience is the capacity to feel, perceive, or experience subjectively.

324
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:45,780
And this is something that almost every living thing can do on some level.

325
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:52,200
It's very clear to anybody that, for example, a dog or a cat can feel, perceive, and experience

326
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:53,200
subjectively.

327
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:57,400
In fact, an argument from sentience is actually more helpful for the anti-abortion side of

328
00:20:57,400 --> 00:21:00,480
things, because suffering can only exist if sentience exists.

329
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:04,740
What most normies call sentience, generally due to the common misuse of the term in Star

330
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:09,600
Trek and other forms of sci-fi pop culture, is actually called sapience, and it's clear

331
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:12,920
from the context of the debate he was referring to sapience.

332
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:16,840
Sapience refers to a consciousness that is beyond the practical wisdom of survival, the

333
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:20,360
stuff that animals have, the stuff that comes from feeling, perceiving, and experiencing

334
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:21,360
the world.

335
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:26,760
It also encompasses self-knowledge, interconnectedness, theoretical wisdom, conditioned orientation

336
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:30,520
to the states of the mind, things like judgment, compassion, and culture.

337
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:33,520
And this is where he actually has one over Ben Shapiro.

338
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:37,360
An adult human does not lose sapience when they fall asleep or fall into a coma, and

339
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:39,560
a fetus clearly doesn't yet have sapience.

340
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:43,520
But the problem with that argument is that you can also say that, say, a six-month-old

341
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:45,360
also doesn't have sapience.

342
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:48,680
If sapience were the judge of when it is no longer acceptable to have an abortion, the

343
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:51,760
date may very well be set several years after birth.

344
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:56,320
And even if that makes logical sense, I don't think you're seriously going to find people

345
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:58,360
willing to accept that benchmark in society.

346
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:02,760
This is why, for example, we find the McDonald's manager who decided to give birth in the bathroom

347
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:07,120
and flush the kid down the toilet, claiming the kid was a miscarriage, to be an absolute

348
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:08,120
monster.

349
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:10,680
And Ben's arguments for the other guidelines are convincing, too.

350
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:14,660
If we use the lack of a heartbeat in an underdeveloped fetus, that would remove personhood rights

351
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:18,120
from the people who naturally lack heartbeats and require pacemakers or other marvels of

352
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:20,240
medical technology in order to stay alive.

353
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:24,160
If we use the birthday as a guideline, even though, really, we use the birthday for a

354
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:27,720
lot of other guidelines in society, that would mean a viable baby in the days leading

355
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:32,280
up to a natural birth still lacks personhood rights, and can be aborted as a non-person.

356
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:36,200
And if we take the feminist perspective, that the framing of the question itself is wrong,

357
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:40,000
that the issue isn't the personhood rights of the baby, but the bodily autonomy of the

358
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:44,960
mother, while that argument is actually pretty sound, it feels like it's dodging the question.

359
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:47,880
But there's also a problem with Ben's argument as well, and let me play back where

360
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:48,880
he brings it up.

361
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:52,600
Okay, so a first trimester fetus has moral value, because whether you consider it a potential

362
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:58,200
human life or a full-on human life, it has more value than just a cluster of cells.

363
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:02,080
If left to its natural processes, it will grow into a baby.

364
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:06,840
Believe it or not, a fertilized egg, when left to its natural processes, may or may

365
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:08,300
not become a baby.

366
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:13,720
In the John Hopkins Manual of Gynecology and Obstetrics, I think it's pronounced obstetrics,

367
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:20,360
4th edition, on page 438, it states that 30-40% of all conceptions result in miscarriage,

368
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:24,520
and that 80% of those losses happen before 12 weeks in, before any symptoms of pregnancy

369
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:25,520
occur.

370
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:28,840
In the study, Second Trimester Pregnancy Loss, published in the American Family Physician,

371
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:34,080
it is estimated that as many as half of all fertilized eggs may spontaneously abort themselves

372
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:36,180
long before the woman knows she is even pregnant.

373
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:41,760
This chance increases if within the first month of conception, the woman smokes, drinks,

374
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:45,440
makes hot baths, or uses a hot tub, or exercises.

375
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:49,920
The honest truth is, and this speaks to a much larger biological and evolutionary conversation

376
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:54,400
beyond the scope of this video, humans are imperfect creatures, and our stuff doesn't

377
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,300
always work perfectly every time.

378
00:23:56,300 --> 00:24:00,540
When left to our natural processes, our eyes are intended to see at a specific level of

379
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:02,880
detail and distance, but they often don't.

380
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:07,080
When left to our natural processes, our digestive system is meant to break down fuel and pass

381
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:09,440
solid waste, but it often doesn't.

382
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:13,320
When left to our natural processes, parts of our bodies are clearly intended to perform

383
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:15,000
specific functions.

384
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,140
Sometimes they do.

385
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:19,000
Sometimes we're born with a defect, and they don't work properly.

386
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,800
Sometimes we abuse our bodies, and they don't work properly.

387
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:25,080
Sometimes we unintentionally disable our bodies through innocuous behavior.

388
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:28,280
And sometimes they just don't do what they're supposed to do.

389
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:32,440
Ben's argument is that if a fetus is left to its natural processes, Ben's argument

390
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:36,440
that if a fetus is left to its natural processes, it will become a baby is flawed.

391
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:41,080
A more accurate statement is that a fetus is designed to grow into a baby, and that

392
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:45,600
if given the chance, it may well do just that, but that it's not guaranteed, and it may

393
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:49,840
be just as likely for the zygote to disassemble itself and disperse into a slightly heavier

394
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:52,520
than average period through no fault of anyone.

395
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:56,480
It's maddening to think about sometimes, but biology isn't a perfect science like

396
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:57,480
physics.

397
00:24:57,480 --> 00:25:01,240
It's still clearly a science, of course, but it's not as simple as A leading to B

398
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:03,080
leading to C all the time.

399
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:07,280
So when Ben dismisses the argument of the heartbeat or the argument of birth, based

400
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:11,400
on how it may affect adults who find themselves in similar situations, his conception argument

401
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:13,560
can also be dismissed on those merits.

402
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:18,580
If life begins at conception, and we confer personhood rights to an egg fertilized, say,

403
00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:22,880
one hour ago, who is to blame for the murder of that egg when the woman's body rejects

404
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:24,180
it five days later?

405
00:25:24,180 --> 00:25:25,800
Who would even know that a murder had occurred?

406
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:29,880
And if you think that this is an unreal scenario, that something like this would just never

407
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:30,880
happen?

408
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:33,980
Let's take a look at the court ruling in Alabama that made all women personally to

409
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:38,320
blame for any harm their actions may cause to a fetus from the moment of conception.

410
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:43,820
In Alabama, if you're a woman and you smoke, drink, drive above the speed limit, step into

411
00:25:43,820 --> 00:25:49,600
a hot tub, or do anything that may cause a fetus harm, including both harm after birth

412
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:54,320
and early term miscarriages, even miscarriages unknown to you that they are happening, even

413
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:58,760
though potentially half of all pregnancies naturally end in such a miscarriage, you are

414
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:00,040
legally liable.

415
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:04,300
And because to them life begins at conception, and there is no accurate way of detecting

416
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:08,880
pregnancy that early, it is simply assumed by the law that all women not currently on

417
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:13,260
their period are in a classification called potentially pregnant, and may be charged by

418
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:17,640
police for potentially endangering their unborn child's life for drinking or smoking while

419
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:18,760
not on the rag.

420
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:23,140
In my opinion, this is an unacceptable state of affairs, and it stems from accepting the

421
00:26:23,140 --> 00:26:26,140
life begins at conception argument as a legal basis.

422
00:26:26,180 --> 00:26:29,700
As an aside, the libertarian demon sitting on my soldier is telling me as I write this

423
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:32,620
script that we should take up the Ferengi's position on pregnancy.

424
00:26:56,140 --> 00:27:12,040
Yeah, why not?

425
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:13,660
Let's treat abortion like an eviction.

426
00:27:13,660 --> 00:27:16,980
A landlord certainly isn't concerned that a tenant may die when they evict them after

427
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:18,700
nine months of unpaid rent.

428
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:19,800
Why should a woman be?

429
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:23,860
I've spent way too much of this video talking about abortion, when it's about Ben Shapiro's

430
00:27:23,860 --> 00:27:24,860
speech.

431
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:29,040
It's just that this back and forth is probably the most blatant example of Ben's flawed reasoning.

432
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:32,860
The questioner had great avenues with which to attack Ben's position that he let slip

433
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:35,540
by, and I was actually pulling my hair out watching this.

434
00:27:35,540 --> 00:27:37,540
Oh well, at least he did better than this woman.

435
00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:57,900
put on trial for a couple of different reasons.

436
00:27:57,900 --> 00:28:02,960
So the first reason is because I don't think that it is effective in deterring abortion

437
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:06,280
to put women on trial for the killing of the unborn.

438
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:09,560
The second reason is because I think that we in our society have unfortunately gotten

439
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:13,760
to such a point that an entire generation have been indoctrinated to believe, particularly

440
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:16,720
an entire generation of women, since that's what we're talking about here, have been indoctrinated

441
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:19,880
to believe that a baby is a polyp, and so when they remove it, I'm not sure there's

442
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:24,540
the actual mens rea necessary, the actual criminal intent necessary for a prosecution.

443
00:28:24,540 --> 00:28:28,420
So when we're talking about, you know, the typical pro-life position here has been that

444
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:33,580
the woman is a victim in abortion nearly as much as the baby is, that there is an entire

445
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:39,020
abortion industry that is geared toward teaching women that babies are not babies and that

446
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:43,220
getting a baby aborted is in fact a betterment of their life.

447
00:28:43,220 --> 00:28:46,940
So no, I'm not in favor of prosecuting women for abortions.

448
00:28:46,940 --> 00:28:50,940
But I mean, you know, there are a lot of women who do have the intent, right?

449
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:55,500
Like if someone, if a woman goes to an abortion clinic, they are ordering the murder of their

450
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:59,460
child, in your opinion, like what you would say, so do they not have the mens rea?

451
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:04,700
So I just gave you, I gave you two reasons, one a public policy one, and one, like, you'd

452
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:09,460
have to show me, you'd really have to show me the case of a woman who went in there and

453
00:29:09,460 --> 00:29:12,100
said, I know this is a baby, cut its brains out.

454
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:15,580
I like, if that's happening, then that is infanticide.

455
00:29:15,580 --> 00:29:18,740
I mean, that's like, wouldn't you acknowledge, I mean, if a woman walked in with a baby that

456
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:22,340
was one day old and said, here's my baby, kill it.

457
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:23,340
Wouldn't you put her on trial?

458
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:26,240
But that's, that's not what we're talking about in the vast majority of abortions.

459
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:29,980
The truth is, unfortunately, that women don't actually believe they are killing a child.

460
00:29:29,980 --> 00:29:33,700
They actually believe they're killing something that is non-human and is the same thing as

461
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:36,700
removing a tumor or something.

462
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:40,020
So are you saying that you don't think abortion is murder then?

463
00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:41,540
Because I know I'm not saying that at all.

464
00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:45,100
I'm saying that women who, I'm saying that the vast majority of women who obtain abortions

465
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:49,700
don't think that abortion is murder and intense is a, is a, is a fundamental element in any

466
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:50,980
criminal prosecution.

467
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:52,900
I feel, I feel horrible for women who have abortions.

468
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:53,980
I think that it's terrible for them.

469
00:29:53,980 --> 00:29:56,420
I think it's, I think it's a lot worse for the baby.

470
00:29:56,420 --> 00:29:57,420
Yes, yes.

471
00:29:57,420 --> 00:29:58,860
Just keep talking past him.

472
00:29:58,860 --> 00:30:00,900
I'm sure that will make your argument more convincing.

473
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:04,700
I know how it looks when two men have a more productive conversation on abortion than a

474
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:09,540
man and a woman, but Jesus lady need to have an argument and not just a moral pontification.

475
00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:13,980
In any case, I'd highly recommend you watch Ben's speech and the Q and A section afterward,

476
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:15,220
even if you disagree with him.

477
00:30:15,220 --> 00:30:20,740
A few days before the event, U of C Berkeley's chancellor, Carol Christ said, call toxic

478
00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:22,240
speech out for what it is.

479
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:25,980
Don't shout it down for in shouting it down, you collude to the narrative that universities

480
00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:29,860
are not open to all speech, respond to hate speech with more speech.

481
00:30:29,860 --> 00:30:33,320
And this is probably the best response to Ben Shapiro and others like him.

482
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:37,060
Even if you vehemently disagree with their positions, he's not a hate monger, he's not

483
00:30:37,060 --> 00:30:38,240
a bigot.

484
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:41,240
He generally doesn't hold positions that aren't ideological in nature.

485
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:45,400
If you disagree, challenge him, because if you ignore him, then you can't present your

486
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:46,600
counter arguments.

487
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:50,000
It may end up being a tradition to include a Game of Thrones quote in every single video

488
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,700
that I do, considering how well they seem to have fit in in the past few.

489
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:57,120
When you tear out a man's tongue, you are not proving him a liar.

490
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:59,500
You're only telling the world that you fear what he might say.

491
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:02,040
I don't fear what Ben Shapiro has to say.

492
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:04,360
I disagree with it, but I don't fear it.

493
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:08,400
In fact, my greatest criticism of Ben Shapiro's speech is that he recycled the entire thing

494
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:10,760
from his appearance on the Joe Rogan podcast.

495
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:14,600
You'd think for $600,000 in security, he could have written something new.

496
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:20,440
Alright guys, that does it for me.

497
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:21,440
Thanks for watching today.

498
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:26,480
I was actually about two thirds done another video when the Ben Shapiro thing went down,

499
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:28,720
so I put that on pause and did this one instead.

500
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:31,760
I'm going to return to that other project and release it in short order.

501
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:34,120
Special thanks to everybody who supports this show on Patreon.

502
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:36,220
