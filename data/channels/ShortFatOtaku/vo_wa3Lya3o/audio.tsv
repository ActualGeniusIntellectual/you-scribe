0	2240	Berkeley is no stranger to protests.
2240	6800	In the 1960s, U of C Berkeley was the center point of the free speech movement,
6800	11440	with iconic photographs emerging from the period of hippie students holding up free speech signs.
11440	15760	In the 2010s, U of C Berkeley is also a center point of the free speech movement,
15760	17280	though in a different way.
17280	21440	Iconic photos now consist of hipster students burning free speech signs.
21440	26240	Since Trump's election, U of C Berkeley, like other left-leaning locations in the United States,
26240	28240	have collectively lost their minds.
28240	33360	On February 1st, when conservative talking head and flamboyantly gay Trump supporter,
33360	37040	Milo Yiannopoulos, was scheduled to give a speech on campus,
37040	41520	approximately 1500 people showed up to peacefully protest, as is their right to do so.
41520	46160	However, approximately 150 members of the Black Bloc, dressed head to toe in black
46160	48480	in order to appear threatening and conceal their identities,
48480	51680	infiltrated the crowd with weapons and began to incite violence.
51680	56000	These individuals, who claimed to be part of either Antifa or BAM,
56000	58240	otherwise known as by any means necessary,
58240	60480	attacked both the crowd and the police,
60480	63440	threw fireworks and lit the place on fucking fire.
63440	66160	After Milo's event was canceled due to the violence,
66160	69280	the crowd moved off campus into the city of Berkeley proper,
69280	71200	damaging property in the downtown area.
71200	76800	On March 4th, the aptly named March for Trump went down at multiple locations across the USA.
77520	81360	As expected, the Berkeley protest turned violent even before it began,
81360	83920	with Black Bloc members attacking the pro-Trump camp.
83920	87200	This is when Based Stickman first became known to the internet.
87200	90160	On April 15th, the battle for Berkeley began,
90160	94000	having realized that the reason the Black Bloc had been so effective at turning the
94000	97760	other rallies violent was because they came armed and prepared for a fight.
97760	101920	So the right-wing group the Oath Keepers organized a pro-Trump rally
101920	104080	and also decided to come prepared for a fight.
104080	108720	The ensuing event was a shit show, with both sides repeatedly clashing with weapons,
108720	112080	and multiple arrests and confiscations made by the police,
112080	115520	most notably a former professor attacking a student with a bike lock.
115520	121200	On August 27th, between 2,000 and 4,000 people attended a rally against hate,
121200	126240	which remained largely peaceful until 100 Black Bloc members smuggled in weapons,
126240	129200	bypassing the 500-strong police security checks,
129200	132560	and began attacking the small number of right-wing counter-protesters.
132560	136320	The Berkeley police chief ordered his officers to abandon the park,
136320	140480	stating that having the police confront the Black Bloc would have only led to more violence.
140480	144960	Antifa members also threatened to attack journalists documenting their actions at this event.
144960	148880	If I haven't made it clear yet, Berkeley is a fucking powder keg,
148880	153040	and the students would rather restrict free speech in what they'd call extreme cases,
153040	154800	instead of letting it flourish.
154800	160640	So when conservative pundit Ben Shapiro decided to give a speech at UFC Berkeley on September 14th,
160640	164000	I don't think a single person was surprised that counter-protests sprung up,
164000	166000	with some of them erupting into violence.
166000	167840	Let's take a look at what went down.
167840	170240	Here's the chant of some of the counter-protesters.
170240	181120	If you couldn't make that out, they were saying,
181120	183440	speech is violent, we will not be silent.
183440	187920	Now, I've discussed the slippery slope of problems that come about when speech is equated to violence,
187920	190800	when criticism of idea is equated to attack on a person,
190800	193280	most notably in my video, The Free Speech Problem.
193280	195280	Here's the cliff notes of my criticism.
195280	198560	If speech is considered to be violent, then offense is assault.
198560	202880	And if a hypothetical right to not be offended is like the right to not be assaulted,
202880	205440	or if it is more paramount than the right to free speech,
205440	208400	then any person can censor any speech they like,
208400	211040	even legitimate criticism on the grounds of offense.
211040	214720	But even beyond all that, isn't your chant completely self-defeating?
214720	218960	If speech is violent, then the one thing you should be is silent, you idiots.
219600	222240	Put your fist in the air with me and repeat after me.
222800	227600	In the name of humanity, we refuse.
229200	236080	To accept a fascist America, we will not be silent.
237760	245360	We will not accommodate, we will not collaborate, we will not normalize it.
246880	253840	We will rise up until these fascists are off our streets,
254080	259360	out of our campuses, and out of the White House,
263440	264560	November 4th.
266000	276960	We come in the streets and stay in the streets until Trump and Pence and their whole regime
277840	288560	are gone, night after night, day after day, November 4th, it begins.
294000	297360	I wonder if these fools realize that a fascist regime wouldn't actually
297360	299760	let them say what they're saying or do what they're doing.
299760	302080	Oh well, November 4th video coming up.
302640	305840	Thank you Antifa for maintaining my burgeoning YouTube career.
305840	309120	Here's a U of C Berkeley grad student complaining that first-year students
309120	312720	shouldn't have to be exposed to police or security or barricades on campus.
312720	314080	I'm just a poet, okay?
315120	321440	But I walk into my classroom with freshmen just now, two hours ago, and they ask me,
322080	324000	why are there barricades on campus?
324000	326480	Why is there a police force on campus?
326480	329360	These people don't know, this has nothing to do with them.
330160	335440	And the campus is completely being taken away from students who have every right to access.
335840	343760	I don't think my students should have to be confronted with a
343760	345600	militarized police force on campus.
347680	351280	I don't think they should have to face threats, potential violence, mayhem,
351280	353600	helicopters circling almost every week.
354560	359200	Well, sorry sweetheart, but these first-year students are legally adults.
359200	361200	And if they can't cope with reality yet,
361200	363760	university is probably the best place to start learning that skill.
363760	367280	And who's to blame?
368960	370240	I think chancellor.
372640	377280	Oh yeah, yeah, it's the university chancellor's fault for allowing Ben Shapiro to give his talk.
377280	380400	It's not people who have threatened him and incited violence for the past 10 months
380400	382880	at any high-profile conservative gathering, oh no.
382880	387360	I mean, Ben might have given a talk at U of C Berkeley back in 2016
387360	389440	and not needed a single bit of security at all,
390000	394000	while this time the university had to spend $600,000 on security officers,
394000	397120	on bodyguards, on barricades and other defensive measures.
397120	398560	That's all just Ben's fault.
398560	402080	If Ben just wasn't there, there would be no need for violence at all.
402080	406240	And I just have to ask, what was Ben Shapiro wearing when she was raped?
406880	412400	So under the guise of free speech, they're trying to make their events seem legitimate
412400	416320	and they're trying to sow doubts about what's the right moral thing to do.
417280	421920	And they always invoke John Stuart Mill about their free speech arguments,
422720	426720	which means that apparently you're able to say whatever you want,
427360	430000	but you can't go to physical violence.
430800	431680	Okay, fine.
431680	433760	Free marketplace of ideas.
433760	435840	Every idea has equal value.
435840	436640	That's bullshit.
439440	442080	You don't understand what the free marketplace of ideas is.
442080	443760	And I know you don't understand it,
443840	447680	because the free marketplace of ideas is not about every idea having equal value.
448480	452080	Free marketplace of ideas is about giving every idea a platform
452080	453920	and then allowing the ones with the greatest value
453920	455760	to naturally convince people through their merits.
456560	460480	It's about disproving bad ideas, not preventing them from being heard.
460480	463280	And I'm really sick of all this faulty reasoning
463280	466080	and people trying to pull blinds over other people's eyes
466080	471120	and trying to influence naive young students who don't know what any of this is about.
472080	475600	Okay, Ben Shapiro might have gone to Harvard Law School
475600	477120	and he can sound reasonable,
477760	482720	but it's up to us to teach people how to go past the seeming facades.
483920	486080	It's not rationality, it's fascism.
486080	488960	It's irrational and it's dangerous.
488960	491520	You heard it here, the bald-faced truth.
491520	493600	This might as well be their fucking slogan.
493600	495920	It's not rationality, it's fascism.
495920	498960	When somebody talks about rationality, they see it as fascist.
498960	503760	Presumed because their ideology is irrational and can be defeated by reasoned thinking.
503760	505440	Lauren Southern was down in the crowd,
505440	507920	recording things on the street as she is known to do.
507920	509520	Things were actually pretty quiet,
509520	512640	with Lauren making quips to her livestream chat room every once in a while,
512640	514400	until she bumped into this woman.
514400	518640	That's Yvette Falarca, and there's enough on her to be its entire fucking video.
518640	519600	Maybe in the future.
519600	521200	But for now, here's what you need to know.
521200	525040	She's a big part of the radical violent left-wing group by any means necessary.
525040	526480	Let's see what she has to say for herself.
528960	548000	Uh oh, she's noticed you, Lauren.
548000	550720	She's noticed that you're half her age and twice as good looking.
550720	553680	She's blaming you for her squandering her amazing Asian genes.
558960	568000	I'm a lot to walk here.
568000	590880	Wait wait wait, what the fuck is on this guy's head?
590880	593520	Did he show up to the protest cosplaying as Emo Toad?
598000	624160	To somebody on the outside, here's what this looks and sounds like.
624160	627760	This guy here, in the camo hat, he's doing his best to talk.
627760	629760	And these people are simply chanting past him.
629760	632320	They're intimidating and united, sure.
632320	633600	But they're also mindless.
633600	659120	Oh jeez, I hope she didn't leave a grease stain, Lauren.
659120	662080	Celeste Paradise was attacked while at the protest as well.
662080	688720	She gave her account of events to Scrabblebag Shooter in a video interview.
688720	691760	This is the first time I've ever seen a girl run off with a sign, and I tried to hold onto
691760	692760	it.
692760	697720	And as I was dragged away holding onto it, two guys just grabbed me, spun me away from
697720	701560	the girl who ran off with the sign, and I was in the middle of the crowd all of a sudden.
701560	705200	And then they slammed me down, and my head hit the pavement twice.
705200	706200	It was awful.
706200	708920	I didn't trip, you know, it was awful.
708920	714000	And then I couldn't see for a minute, I was dizzy, I couldn't get up right away, and by
714000	718480	the time I could even think about it, it was this maelstrom of people.
718480	719480	But it was awful.
719480	722400	I got separated from my friends, everyone was screaming at me.
722400	725800	There were no friendlies, the cops were all around me, and it was a terrible position
725800	731720	because everyone was just yelling at me and taking pictures with their phones and not
731720	732720	trying to help me.
732720	733720	I just wanted to die.
733720	734720	I was so embarrassed.
734720	735720	I understand, but it's not your fault.
735720	741960	You definitely don't need to feel embarrassed without disturbing a victim like that.
741960	747840	And a lot of press came up to me, rather from Channel 4 came up, all kinds of different
747840	753160	bloggers, and they all seemed astonished that I would have a sign that said what it said.
753160	757040	They were astonished that you would have a sign that was welcoming Dan Shapiro, and you
757040	759840	were in the middle of downtown, like a first world American city.
759840	765480	Yeah, like the chancellor of this campus invited this person to speak, and I had a sign saying,
765480	767480	yeah, Shalom Shapiro, we welcome you.
767480	768920	And everyone was like, you're brave.
768920	769920	I'm astonished by this.
769920	772200	Shalom Shapiro is something it takes.
772200	776840	And just so we don't have to take her word for it, Rhea Bhattacharjee of MSNBC managed
776840	778840	to catch part of the event.
778840	785840	So, medical emergency, you guys are taking pictures?
785840	786840	Really?
786840	814880	That's what happens when you're a Nazi.
814880	819100	George Kelly was also on the scene, taking photos during the daytime protests.
819100	822880	He got pictures of violent protesters getting arrested, along with anti-Ben Shapiro chalk
822880	824220	messages on the sidewalk.
824220	828000	You know, guys, if you're going to protest somebody giving a speech at your university,
828000	832040	maybe you should be familiar enough with him that you know how to spell his name.
832040	836140	What is Ben going to try and sell me a libertarian branded Sharpie at this event?
836140	839680	At least the police were actually arresting people this time.
839680	843920	At previous events, somebody higher up prevented the police from stepping in and keeping the
843960	848680	But this time, the police were, as Ben himself put it, unshackled.
848680	851840	Multiple arrests were made for attempting to bring weapons into the protest areas, as
851840	855960	well as battery of a police officer by one very happy hipster girl.
855960	858160	Around dyed hair beware, after all.
858160	860560	Another arrestee was involved in Hillary Clinton's campaign.
860560	862920	I guess she just can't pick a winning side in any fight.
862920	866920	But in the end, the protest was significantly less violent and destructive, largely thanks
866920	868480	to a legitimate police presence.
868480	872040	When it was all said and done, the best the counter protesters got was looking like they're
872040	873860	all having an orgasm in unison.
873860	877980	What actually was it that Ben Shapiro said during his speech that caused such a ridiculous
877980	879900	overreaction from the protesters?
879900	883540	What kind of vile hate speech could he have been spouting to warrant any of this?
883540	885940	Well, let me cut his speech down into an abridged version.
885940	889740	I want to say thank you to the morons who put up that sign across the way.
889740	893140	It says, we say no to your white supremacist bullshit.
893140	897860	Well, I say thank you because I also say no to white supremacist bullshit.
897860	905020	And if you stick around long enough in this speech, you will hear me do exactly that.
905020	908460	The problem is I also say no to your identity politics bullshit.
908460	912120	There's a pathetic new movement arising all over the country, from Sacramento to Berkeley
912120	917420	to Dallas to Charlottesville, and that movement says that speech is violence and must be treated
917420	918420	as such.
918420	923780	Antifa couldn't go anywhere without an ideology that runs broader than Antifa, without a group
923780	926620	of people willing to look the other way.
927140	929940	Well, what is the view that undergirds Antifa?
929940	934020	What's the view that undergirds the hard left, many of whom celebrate Antifa or were doing
934020	937240	so until it became politically unpalatable to do so?
937240	941540	It's a view that America is a terrible, horrible, no good, very bad place.
941540	944360	Now, the truth is that America is an incredible place.
944360	945920	It's the greatest place in the history of the world.
945920	949820	It is the freest, most prosperous country, the most tolerant country in the history of
949820	952840	planet Earth.
952840	955380	This country is an incredible place full of opportunity.
955380	960180	Nobody by and large cares enough about you to stop you from achieving your dreams.
960180	963760	That means in a free country, if you fail, it is probably your own fault.
963760	968060	If it is somebody else's fault, if somebody is actually trying to throw up obstacles in
968060	972960	front of you in a way that is unjust and bigoted, point out the specific instance so we can
972960	974780	all side with you.
974780	977180	We all want to be on the same side.
977180	978380	We all want to help out.
978380	982280	When somebody is a racist and trying to stop you, we all want to sound off and stop that
982280	983280	too.
983280	987440	The idea, however, that America as a whole owns your failure when you can't point to
987440	990240	specific problems does not wash.
990240	994040	Now, listen, you'd be a fool not to acknowledge or a liar not to acknowledge the history of
994040	995440	racism in America.
995440	997620	Everybody acknowledges that if you have half a brain.
997620	1002700	Of course, slavery, Jim Crow, awful, evil treatment at the hands of awful, evil people.
1002700	1004600	We all acknowledge this.
1004600	1008640	We all acknowledge the collective sin of the United States in promulgating this and the
1008640	1012960	individual sins, more importantly, of the people who actually promulgated this stuff.
1012960	1013960	We all get that.
1013960	1015080	But that's not what we're talking about.
1015080	1019880	Now we're talking about now because I wasn't born when Jim Crow was in place.
1019880	1021440	I wasn't an adult when Jim Crow was in place.
1021440	1025080	I know that I'm not a racist and I know I haven't acted in a racist manner.
1025080	1028480	And I would bet you money that the people in this room haven't acted in a racist manner,
1028480	1031760	that they haven't held slaves or voted for Jim Crow.
1031760	1035000	I will bet you money that is the case.
1035000	1039200	You cannot fix past injustices with current injustices.
1039200	1043760	The only way to fix past injustices is with individual freedom.
1043760	1044760	That's it.
1044760	1045760	Yeah, that's it.
1045760	1048900	Just generic conservative and libertarian talking points, all of them qualified with
1048900	1051240	rebukes of bigotry and valid explanations.
1051240	1055360	I don't agree with everything Ben Shapiro said during this talk, but not only do I defend
1055360	1058880	his right to say it, I even think he did a good job at presenting his arguments.
1058880	1062560	And that's why Ben and people like him are protested so strongly.
1062560	1066840	Not because he's violent or because he incites violence or because he's racist or sexist
1066840	1068480	or a white supremacist.
1068480	1071160	And no, Tariq, he's not faking his Jewishness.
1071160	1074800	It's because he holds well-reasoned positions that they are ideologically and emotionally
1074800	1079720	opposed to, and they cannot use appeals to emotion or ideological rhetoric to adequately
1079720	1082000	combat a position founded in reason.
1082000	1084560	This doesn't mean that I agree with him, I often don't.
1084560	1089080	But the only way to argue against his well-reasoned positions are with other well-reasoned positions
1089080	1090080	of your own.
1090080	1091580	And these Berkeley protesters?
1091580	1093880	A lack of reason is probably their biggest failing.
1093880	1100280	That's why earlier on, this clown said, it's not rationality, it's fascism.
1100280	1104880	They know that reason is their Achilles heel, so reason must become fascism.
1104880	1106900	Rational thinkers must become fascists.
1106900	1111480	And debate between reasonable people holding reasoned yet opposing viewpoints without relying
1111480	1116380	on ideology must become a hotbed of bigotry, to which the only reaction is violence.
1116380	1118760	But yeah, Ben's a conservative libertarian.
1118760	1120600	I'm a left-leaning liberal centrist.
1120600	1122960	I do agree with him on a few things in his speech.
1122960	1126760	For example, the current black community situation overwhelmingly being caused by fathers not
1126760	1128320	sticking around to raise their kids.
1128320	1132600	Or that the gender pay gap is largely a result of women's choices, not as individuals, but
1132600	1134140	as a class of millions of people.
1134140	1135800	Or that free speech must be considered paramount.
1135800	1138640	However, I disagree with him, for example, on abortion rights.
1138640	1143160	And it always makes me fucking cringe to watch young lefties go at him over abortion, because
1143160	1146020	there's always way better arguments than they put forward.
1146020	1147200	Like this guy, for example.
1147200	1151480	My question was about abortion, and I just wanted to know, why exactly do you think a
1151480	1155000	first trimester fetus has moral value?
1155000	1159200	Okay, so a first trimester fetus has moral value, because whether you consider it a potential
1159200	1164800	human life or a full-on human life, it has more value than just a cluster of cells.
1164800	1168520	If left to its natural processes, it will grow into a baby.
1168520	1169960	So the real question is, where do you draw the line?
1169960	1172320	So you're gonna draw the line at the heartbeat, because it's very hard to draw the line at
1172320	1173320	the heartbeat.
1173320	1175360	There are people who are adults who are alive because of a pacemaker.
1175360	1178000	They need some sort of outside force generating their heartbeat.
1178000	1179840	Okay, are you gonna do it based on brain function?
1179840	1181680	Okay, well, what about people who are in a coma?
1181680	1182680	Should we just kill them?
1182680	1187560	Right, the problem is anytime you draw any line other than the inception of the child,
1187560	1191440	you end up drawing a false line that can also be applied to people who are adults.
1191440	1193680	So either human life has intrinsic value or it doesn't.
1193680	1196080	I think we both agree that adult human life has intrinsic value.
1196080	1197660	Can we start from that premise?
1197660	1205600	I believe that sentience is what gives something moral value, not necessarily being a human
1205600	1206600	alone.
1206600	1210440	Okay, so when you're asleep, can I stab you?
1210440	1213440	I'm still considered sentient when I'm asleep.
1213440	1217240	Okay, if you are in a coma from which you may awake, can I stab you?
1217240	1220240	Well then, no, I guess not.
1220240	1223560	I'm glad you answered that, because I have no interest in actually murdering you.
1223560	1226520	But that's still potential sentience and it's still a potential...
1226520	1228240	I agree, it is potential sentience.
1228240	1229680	You know what else is potential sentience?
1229680	1230880	Being a fetus.
1230880	1235000	He got schooled on the sentient argument, but not because he was wrong, because he conceded
1235000	1236800	a point that he shouldn't have conceded.
1236800	1239300	First of all, he wasn't using the term sentience correctly.
1239300	1242600	Sentience is the capacity to feel, perceive, or experience subjectively.
1242600	1245780	And this is something that almost every living thing can do on some level.
1245780	1252200	It's very clear to anybody that, for example, a dog or a cat can feel, perceive, and experience
1252200	1253200	subjectively.
1253200	1257400	In fact, an argument from sentience is actually more helpful for the anti-abortion side of
1257400	1260480	things, because suffering can only exist if sentience exists.
1260480	1264740	What most normies call sentience, generally due to the common misuse of the term in Star
1264740	1269600	Trek and other forms of sci-fi pop culture, is actually called sapience, and it's clear
1269600	1272920	from the context of the debate he was referring to sapience.
1272920	1276840	Sapience refers to a consciousness that is beyond the practical wisdom of survival, the
1276840	1280360	stuff that animals have, the stuff that comes from feeling, perceiving, and experiencing
1280360	1281360	the world.
1281360	1286760	It also encompasses self-knowledge, interconnectedness, theoretical wisdom, conditioned orientation
1286760	1290520	to the states of the mind, things like judgment, compassion, and culture.
1290520	1293520	And this is where he actually has one over Ben Shapiro.
1293520	1297360	An adult human does not lose sapience when they fall asleep or fall into a coma, and
1297360	1299560	a fetus clearly doesn't yet have sapience.
1299560	1303520	But the problem with that argument is that you can also say that, say, a six-month-old
1303520	1305360	also doesn't have sapience.
1305360	1308680	If sapience were the judge of when it is no longer acceptable to have an abortion, the
1308680	1311760	date may very well be set several years after birth.
1311760	1316320	And even if that makes logical sense, I don't think you're seriously going to find people
1316320	1318360	willing to accept that benchmark in society.
1318360	1322760	This is why, for example, we find the McDonald's manager who decided to give birth in the bathroom
1322760	1327120	and flush the kid down the toilet, claiming the kid was a miscarriage, to be an absolute
1327120	1328120	monster.
1328120	1330680	And Ben's arguments for the other guidelines are convincing, too.
1330680	1334660	If we use the lack of a heartbeat in an underdeveloped fetus, that would remove personhood rights
1334660	1338120	from the people who naturally lack heartbeats and require pacemakers or other marvels of
1338120	1340240	medical technology in order to stay alive.
1340240	1344160	If we use the birthday as a guideline, even though, really, we use the birthday for a
1344160	1347720	lot of other guidelines in society, that would mean a viable baby in the days leading
1347720	1352280	up to a natural birth still lacks personhood rights, and can be aborted as a non-person.
1352280	1356200	And if we take the feminist perspective, that the framing of the question itself is wrong,
1356200	1360000	that the issue isn't the personhood rights of the baby, but the bodily autonomy of the
1360000	1364960	mother, while that argument is actually pretty sound, it feels like it's dodging the question.
1364960	1367880	But there's also a problem with Ben's argument as well, and let me play back where
1367880	1368880	he brings it up.
1368880	1372600	Okay, so a first trimester fetus has moral value, because whether you consider it a potential
1372600	1378200	human life or a full-on human life, it has more value than just a cluster of cells.
1378200	1382080	If left to its natural processes, it will grow into a baby.
1382080	1386840	Believe it or not, a fertilized egg, when left to its natural processes, may or may
1386840	1388300	not become a baby.
1388300	1393720	In the John Hopkins Manual of Gynecology and Obstetrics, I think it's pronounced obstetrics,
1393720	1400360	4th edition, on page 438, it states that 30-40% of all conceptions result in miscarriage,
1400360	1404520	and that 80% of those losses happen before 12 weeks in, before any symptoms of pregnancy
1404520	1405520	occur.
1405520	1408840	In the study, Second Trimester Pregnancy Loss, published in the American Family Physician,
1408840	1414080	it is estimated that as many as half of all fertilized eggs may spontaneously abort themselves
1414080	1416180	long before the woman knows she is even pregnant.
1416180	1421760	This chance increases if within the first month of conception, the woman smokes, drinks,
1421760	1425440	makes hot baths, or uses a hot tub, or exercises.
1425440	1429920	The honest truth is, and this speaks to a much larger biological and evolutionary conversation
1429920	1434400	beyond the scope of this video, humans are imperfect creatures, and our stuff doesn't
1434400	1436300	always work perfectly every time.
1436300	1440540	When left to our natural processes, our eyes are intended to see at a specific level of
1440540	1442880	detail and distance, but they often don't.
1442880	1447080	When left to our natural processes, our digestive system is meant to break down fuel and pass
1447080	1449440	solid waste, but it often doesn't.
1449440	1453320	When left to our natural processes, parts of our bodies are clearly intended to perform
1453320	1455000	specific functions.
1455000	1456140	Sometimes they do.
1456140	1459000	Sometimes we're born with a defect, and they don't work properly.
1459000	1461800	Sometimes we abuse our bodies, and they don't work properly.
1461800	1465080	Sometimes we unintentionally disable our bodies through innocuous behavior.
1465080	1468280	And sometimes they just don't do what they're supposed to do.
1468280	1472440	Ben's argument is that if a fetus is left to its natural processes, Ben's argument
1472440	1476440	that if a fetus is left to its natural processes, it will become a baby is flawed.
1476440	1481080	A more accurate statement is that a fetus is designed to grow into a baby, and that
1481080	1485600	if given the chance, it may well do just that, but that it's not guaranteed, and it may
1485600	1489840	be just as likely for the zygote to disassemble itself and disperse into a slightly heavier
1489840	1492520	than average period through no fault of anyone.
1492520	1496480	It's maddening to think about sometimes, but biology isn't a perfect science like
1496480	1497480	physics.
1497480	1501240	It's still clearly a science, of course, but it's not as simple as A leading to B
1501240	1503080	leading to C all the time.
1503080	1507280	So when Ben dismisses the argument of the heartbeat or the argument of birth, based
1507280	1511400	on how it may affect adults who find themselves in similar situations, his conception argument
1511400	1513560	can also be dismissed on those merits.
1513560	1518580	If life begins at conception, and we confer personhood rights to an egg fertilized, say,
1518580	1522880	one hour ago, who is to blame for the murder of that egg when the woman's body rejects
1522880	1524180	it five days later?
1524180	1525800	Who would even know that a murder had occurred?
1525800	1529880	And if you think that this is an unreal scenario, that something like this would just never
1529880	1530880	happen?
1530880	1533980	Let's take a look at the court ruling in Alabama that made all women personally to
1533980	1538320	blame for any harm their actions may cause to a fetus from the moment of conception.
1538320	1543820	In Alabama, if you're a woman and you smoke, drink, drive above the speed limit, step into
1543820	1549600	a hot tub, or do anything that may cause a fetus harm, including both harm after birth
1549600	1554320	and early term miscarriages, even miscarriages unknown to you that they are happening, even
1554320	1558760	though potentially half of all pregnancies naturally end in such a miscarriage, you are
1558760	1560040	legally liable.
1560040	1564300	And because to them life begins at conception, and there is no accurate way of detecting
1564300	1568880	pregnancy that early, it is simply assumed by the law that all women not currently on
1568880	1573260	their period are in a classification called potentially pregnant, and may be charged by
1573260	1577640	police for potentially endangering their unborn child's life for drinking or smoking while
1577640	1578760	not on the rag.
1578760	1583140	In my opinion, this is an unacceptable state of affairs, and it stems from accepting the
1583140	1586140	life begins at conception argument as a legal basis.
1586180	1589700	As an aside, the libertarian demon sitting on my soldier is telling me as I write this
1589700	1592620	script that we should take up the Ferengi's position on pregnancy.
1616140	1632040	Yeah, why not?
1632040	1633660	Let's treat abortion like an eviction.
1633660	1636980	A landlord certainly isn't concerned that a tenant may die when they evict them after
1636980	1638700	nine months of unpaid rent.
1638700	1639800	Why should a woman be?
1639800	1643860	I've spent way too much of this video talking about abortion, when it's about Ben Shapiro's
1643860	1644860	speech.
1644900	1649040	It's just that this back and forth is probably the most blatant example of Ben's flawed reasoning.
1649040	1652860	The questioner had great avenues with which to attack Ben's position that he let slip
1652860	1655540	by, and I was actually pulling my hair out watching this.
1655540	1657540	Oh well, at least he did better than this woman.
1674860	1677900	put on trial for a couple of different reasons.
1677900	1682960	So the first reason is because I don't think that it is effective in deterring abortion
1682960	1686280	to put women on trial for the killing of the unborn.
1686280	1689560	The second reason is because I think that we in our society have unfortunately gotten
1689560	1693760	to such a point that an entire generation have been indoctrinated to believe, particularly
1693760	1696720	an entire generation of women, since that's what we're talking about here, have been indoctrinated
1696720	1699880	to believe that a baby is a polyp, and so when they remove it, I'm not sure there's
1699880	1704540	the actual mens rea necessary, the actual criminal intent necessary for a prosecution.
1704540	1708420	So when we're talking about, you know, the typical pro-life position here has been that
1708420	1713580	the woman is a victim in abortion nearly as much as the baby is, that there is an entire
1713580	1719020	abortion industry that is geared toward teaching women that babies are not babies and that
1719020	1723220	getting a baby aborted is in fact a betterment of their life.
1723220	1726940	So no, I'm not in favor of prosecuting women for abortions.
1726940	1730940	But I mean, you know, there are a lot of women who do have the intent, right?
1730940	1735500	Like if someone, if a woman goes to an abortion clinic, they are ordering the murder of their
1735500	1739460	child, in your opinion, like what you would say, so do they not have the mens rea?
1739460	1744700	So I just gave you, I gave you two reasons, one a public policy one, and one, like, you'd
1744700	1749460	have to show me, you'd really have to show me the case of a woman who went in there and
1749460	1752100	said, I know this is a baby, cut its brains out.
1752100	1755580	I like, if that's happening, then that is infanticide.
1755580	1758740	I mean, that's like, wouldn't you acknowledge, I mean, if a woman walked in with a baby that
1758740	1762340	was one day old and said, here's my baby, kill it.
1762340	1763340	Wouldn't you put her on trial?
1763340	1766240	But that's, that's not what we're talking about in the vast majority of abortions.
1766240	1769980	The truth is, unfortunately, that women don't actually believe they are killing a child.
1769980	1773700	They actually believe they're killing something that is non-human and is the same thing as
1773700	1776700	removing a tumor or something.
1776700	1780020	So are you saying that you don't think abortion is murder then?
1780020	1781540	Because I know I'm not saying that at all.
1781540	1785100	I'm saying that women who, I'm saying that the vast majority of women who obtain abortions
1785100	1789700	don't think that abortion is murder and intense is a, is a, is a fundamental element in any
1789700	1790980	criminal prosecution.
1790980	1792900	I feel, I feel horrible for women who have abortions.
1792900	1793980	I think that it's terrible for them.
1793980	1796420	I think it's, I think it's a lot worse for the baby.
1796420	1797420	Yes, yes.
1797420	1798860	Just keep talking past him.
1798860	1800900	I'm sure that will make your argument more convincing.
1800900	1804700	I know how it looks when two men have a more productive conversation on abortion than a
1804700	1809540	man and a woman, but Jesus lady need to have an argument and not just a moral pontification.
1809540	1813980	In any case, I'd highly recommend you watch Ben's speech and the Q and A section afterward,
1813980	1815220	even if you disagree with him.
1815220	1820740	A few days before the event, U of C Berkeley's chancellor, Carol Christ said, call toxic
1820740	1822240	speech out for what it is.
1822240	1825980	Don't shout it down for in shouting it down, you collude to the narrative that universities
1825980	1829860	are not open to all speech, respond to hate speech with more speech.
1829860	1833320	And this is probably the best response to Ben Shapiro and others like him.
1833320	1837060	Even if you vehemently disagree with their positions, he's not a hate monger, he's not
1837060	1838240	a bigot.
1838240	1841240	He generally doesn't hold positions that aren't ideological in nature.
1841240	1845400	If you disagree, challenge him, because if you ignore him, then you can't present your
1845400	1846600	counter arguments.
1846600	1850000	It may end up being a tradition to include a Game of Thrones quote in every single video
1850000	1853700	that I do, considering how well they seem to have fit in in the past few.
1853700	1857120	When you tear out a man's tongue, you are not proving him a liar.
1857120	1859500	You're only telling the world that you fear what he might say.
1859500	1862040	I don't fear what Ben Shapiro has to say.
1862040	1864360	I disagree with it, but I don't fear it.
1864360	1868400	In fact, my greatest criticism of Ben Shapiro's speech is that he recycled the entire thing
1868400	1870760	from his appearance on the Joe Rogan podcast.
1870760	1874600	You'd think for $600,000 in security, he could have written something new.
1874600	1880440	Alright guys, that does it for me.
1880440	1881440	Thanks for watching today.
1881440	1886480	I was actually about two thirds done another video when the Ben Shapiro thing went down,
1886480	1888720	so I put that on pause and did this one instead.
1888720	1891760	I'm going to return to that other project and release it in short order.
1891760	1894120	Special thanks to everybody who supports this show on Patreon.
1894120	1896220	You are what make these video releases possible.
