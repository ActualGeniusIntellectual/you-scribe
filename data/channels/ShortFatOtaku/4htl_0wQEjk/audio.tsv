0	5720	John Fetterman
5720	10560	The October 7th terrorist attack in Israel has truly melted people's brains.
10560	15040	I'm not yet prepared to do a deep dive video on that whole thing, and you know me, there's
15040	19100	a decent chance it'll be old news by the time I'm done, but I would like to quickly
19100	22260	talk about one funny quirk that has come out of the whole thing.
22260	24160	This man is John Fetterman.
24160	27940	He represents something very different to you if you're on the American left or the
27940	29140	American right.
29140	33400	If right, he's a sign in a long list of signs showing that American democracy has
33400	38300	failed, that the American people are either so stupid or so ideological that they would
38300	43800	elect a brain-damaged retard just as long as there is a D beside his name.
43800	46900	But if you're on the left, this conversation becomes a lot weirder.
46900	48540	Let's go back to the beginning.
48540	51600	John Fetterman described his upbringing as privileged.
51600	55900	He was born when his parents were both 19, but his dad made a good living working in
55900	56900	insurance.
56900	60560	He was a conservative entrepreneurial type, and Fetterman's life plan was to take over
60560	62360	his dad's startup after school.
62360	66600	However, while getting a Master's of Business Administration from the University of Connecticut
66600	71000	in 1993, Fetterman's best friend died in a car accident.
71000	75460	As a result, he felt compelled to join the charity group Big Brothers Big Sisters of
75460	79800	America, where adults mentor young people who don't have adult role models in their
79800	80800	lives.
80800	84520	He was paired with an eight-year-old boy whose father died of AIDS and whose mother was on
84520	85520	the way out.
85520	89300	It was Fetterman's experience working at the charity that ultimately caused his politics
89300	92880	to drift away from the rugged individualism of his parents.
92880	98200	In his own words, he became preoccupied with the concept of the random lottery of birth.
98200	103100	Fetterman continued his charity work until 2005, when he ran for the mayor of Braddock,
103100	104100	Pennsylvania.
104100	108200	He had moved to Braddock to start a charity in 2001, helping underprivileged youth finish
108200	109200	their schooling.
109200	111520	He won the mayoral race by just one vote.
111520	116480	In 2009's election for the same position, he faced Jamie Cox, who accused Fetterman
116480	121220	of simply bulldozing his opposition and failing to build consensus with the city council.
121220	125180	In response, Fetterman released local police records showing that Cox had been arrested
125180	126820	in 2004.
126820	131140	These records weren't public, and Fetterman abusing his mayoral authority to release them
131140	135560	constituted a violation of Pennsylvania's Criminal History Record Information Act.
135560	140160	Nonetheless, it was enough to tar Cox's image, and Fetterman won the 2009 election.
140160	146040	His popularity only grew after this incident, and he ran unopposed in 2013 and 2017.
146040	150980	It was during his tenure as the mayor of Braddock that Fetterman became a Democrat rising star.
150980	155160	The town only had 2,000 residents, one major employer in the local hospital, and the mayor
155160	157480	job only paid $150 a month.
157480	161920	This was a small pond, all in all, but Fetterman turned the town into his own personal fix-up
161920	164680	project, with both good and bad results.
164680	168480	He used his authority to purchase neglected buildings and fix them up on his dime.
168480	172240	He bought an abandoned church and lived in it himself for several months, while renovating
172240	173660	it into a community center.
173660	178100	He turned vacant lots into parks, public gardens, and in one case, the town's first public
178100	179400	basketball court.
179400	183200	There were no murders in the town for five straight years under his watch.
183200	187120	Before, Braddock had an abnormally high murder rate for its size.
187120	189560	But it wasn't all sunshine and roses.
189560	193400	Fetterman found the city council's perpetual gridlock annoying, so he bypassed them by
193400	196020	rooting all of his initiatives through his charities.
196020	199640	His father foot the bill for some initial plans, and he used his charity connections
199640	202220	to acquire funding for a lot of these projects.
202220	206260	This limited Democratic input from the residents of the town, and among Fetterman's opponents,
206260	210020	there was a feeling that he was bypassing the city council and unilaterally implementing
210020	214820	his plans because he knew he didn't have the political support to do it above board.
214820	218580	Nonetheless, Fetterman had become known in the Democratic party for his Braddock success,
218580	221100	and it was time for him to advance his career.
221100	225740	In 2018, he ran for the Democratic nomination for the lieutenant governor of Pennsylvania.
225740	229400	The Democratic incumbent, Mike Stack, was being investigated at the time for abusing
229400	233540	his staff and mistreating Pennsylvania state troopers, and Pennsylvania Democrats wanted
233540	235540	to be rid of the Stack scandal.
235540	239940	With several high-profile endorsements, most notably Bernie Sanders, he won the Democratic
239940	243980	nomination, and the Wolf-Fetterman ticket beat out the Republicans for the governor
243980	245300	of Pennsylvania.
245300	249860	As lieutenant governor, Fetterman kept what the Associated Press called a light work schedule.
249860	253100	They looked into his official work calendar and discovered that from his inauguration
253100	259300	in January 2019 until May of 2022, his official schedule was blank for one-third of all eligible
259300	260400	work days.
260400	264740	The days that he did work, he tended to only work on average for four to five hours.
264740	269400	In 2020, he presided over only half of the Pennsylvania state senate sessions, an official
269400	270980	duty of lieutenant governor.
270980	274740	In 2021, he was there for only a third of the sessions.
274740	277440	Lieutenant governor also oversees the state parole board.
277440	281980	The Philadelphia Inquirer reported that Fetterman ran the board with the heart of an activist
281980	284220	and at times the force of a bully.
284220	288580	Pardons for criminals serving jail time in Pennsylvania increased under his watch.
288580	292860	The most high-profile event in this regard was when Fetterman implemented a one-time
292860	298060	widespread pardoning project for people who had committed minor, non-violent marijuana-related
298060	299060	offenses.
299060	304540	John Fetterman first received nationwide recognition during the 2020 presidential election.
304540	307940	Fetterman declared that Donald Trump was just an internet troll, and in response to Trump
307940	313060	threatening to sue Pennsylvania for voter fraud, he said that Trump can sue a ham sandwich.
313060	317660	Texas Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick offered a reward of $1 million for anybody who could
317660	321420	prove a case of fraud in the states that Trump had filed lawsuits.
321420	325520	Investigations in Pennsylvania uncovered three fraudulent votes.
325520	329720	Trump needed another $81,000 to win, by the way, and all three of these fraudulent votes
329720	331860	were actually cast for Trump.
331860	336340	Two men had voted in the name of their recently deceased mothers, and a third had voted in
336340	337620	the name of his son.
338300	343920	Fetterman joked online that Pennsylvania deserved $3 million from Texas, as they had indeed
343920	346380	discovered three cases of voter fraud.
346380	348900	This event gave Fetterman a national spotlight.
348900	353340	He had unsuccessfully run for the Democratic nomination of the U.S. Senate before in 2016,
353340	356020	but in 2022 he was high-profile enough to win.
356020	357940	It was an uphill climb, though.
357940	361760	Fetterman was popular with regular people, but he had few friends in politics.
361760	364980	He ran the lieutenant governor's office the same way he ran the Braddock mayor's
364980	369880	office, doing things his way with his people, preferring to re-route around official impediments
369880	372300	to his plans rather than negotiate with them.
372300	376580	Subsequently, despite his popularity on the ground, he had very few official endorsements
376580	378460	from other Democrat party members.
378460	381980	One Pennsylvania House representative was quoted as saying that Fetterman never came
381980	384740	and introduced himself to me or any of my colleagues.
384740	388020	If a lieutenant governor doesn't take the time to get to talk to somebody like me, then
388020	390700	why would we want to send somebody like him to D.C.?
390700	395820	Nevertheless, Fetterman won the Democratic primary in a landslide taking 58% of the vote.
395820	398100	The next closest challenger had only 26%.
398100	402480	However, Fetterman's wife gave his victory speech, because he was hospitalized.
402480	404540	He had a stroke a few days earlier.
404540	409460	Back in 2017, he was diagnosed with arterial fibrillation, an irregular heart rhythm, and
409460	410780	a decreased heart pump.
410780	414260	Basically, his heart wasn't consistently pumping on rhythm, and his blood wasn't
414260	416340	circulating everywhere it needed to go.
416340	420060	Fetterman chose to ignore the diagnosis and took none of his medication, did none of the
420060	423300	exercises, and refused to go to the doctors for five years.
423300	428720	The problem caused his stroke in May of 2022, and left him with an auditory processing disorder.
428720	432020	His brain can't interpret what he hears consistently anymore.
432020	435260	Since then, Fetterman's doctor claims that he's been attending speech therapy, he's
435260	438860	been working out and taking all of his meds, and that the stroke hasn't left him mentally
438860	441100	impaired, he just has disabled hearing.
441100	443700	The 2022 Senate election was pretty brutal.
443700	446260	This is likely what most of you remember about John Fetterman.
446260	450560	He faced off against the celebrity TV star turned Republican nominee, Dr. Oz.
450560	451820	It was a bloody race.
451820	455660	Fetterman's campaign latched onto the narrative that Dr. Oz was a carpetbagger, someone who
455660	459460	moved to a different location in order to capitalize on a vacant political seat, rather
459460	461660	than actually having any ties to that location.
461660	466020	Dr. Oz was from New Jersey, not Pennsylvania, and Fetterman went around recording videos
466020	469300	with Jersey Shore celebrities to troll Dr. Oz.
469300	474620	His campaign also focused on Dr. Oz's tenure as a medical advisor to the Trump administration.
474620	479400	The whole hydroxychloroquine thing for COVID was initially pushed by Dr. Oz on dozens of
479400	482700	TV appearances, influencing Trump's decision to take it.
482700	488540	Dr. Oz owned $630,000 worth of stock in companies that manufactured the drug.
488540	492560	Meanwhile, Dr. Oz's campaign went for just as many low blows.
492560	496780	They publicized an incident from 2013 where Fetterman, back in the Braddock mayor job,
496780	501500	heard a sound he thought was gunfire and followed an unarmed black jogger whom he detained with
501500	502540	his shotgun.
502540	503660	The jogger was innocent.
503700	506220	He thought the gunfire was kids playing with fireworks.
506220	510220	No charges were filed against either party in the end, but the incident was uncovered
510220	512640	to try and paint Fetterman as a racist.
512640	515500	Fetterman stated that this event happened right after the Sandy Hook school shooting,
515500	519140	that the jogger was near the city school, and that he was afraid of a copycat crime.
519140	522960	Dr. Oz's campaign also latched onto the narrative that Fetterman's stroke had not
522960	527220	only left him with a hearing impediment, but also had rendered him mentally disabled.
527220	530980	Fetterman took four months to appear in public again, finally showing up at a rally in August
530980	532480	of 2022.
532500	536320	The school reported that he appeared physically healthy and mostly talk without issue, but
536320	537880	his speech was halted.
537880	541840	In October of 2022, Fetterman gave his first interview since the stroke.
541840	546600	He required real-time closed captioning technology to be able to read the reporter's questions.
546600	550000	And before the interview, the reporter mused that she didn't know if he could understand
550000	551000	her at all.
551000	554680	Eventually, Fetterman and Dr. Oz debated on October 25th.
554680	556160	Fetterman struggled during the debate.
556160	558080	His speech was once again halting.
558080	559120	He was missing words.
559120	561340	He was pausing at awkward spots and sentences.
561340	562660	It was a wreck.
562660	566400	After this event, the mainstream Republican establishment pounced on the narrative that
566400	570860	Fetterman was not fit for office, that it wasn't just speech or hearing impairment,
570860	572400	it was mental impairment.
572400	574540	This narrative still persists to this day.
574540	578000	Right-leaning Americans basically believe that Fetterman is a vegetable whose only purpose
578000	582100	is to be a warm Democrat body in the office, and that his staff are the ones doing most
582100	583100	of the work.
583100	587100	This plays into a larger narrative about Democrats, that even if their candidates and officers
587100	590880	have one foot in the grave, like Biden or Pelosi, who cares?
590920	595320	All that matters is that it's a D in the position instead of an R. Common Republican criticism
595320	599320	about the whole affair is that the Democrats will take corpses, they'll take retards, they'll
599320	601320	take whoever they can as long as they win.
601320	605680	And sometimes, that it's just obvious American votes have to be rigged, because who in their
605680	608800	right mind would vote for a corpse or a retard?
608800	613360	Fetterman's poor, but frankly expected, debate performance actually allowed Dr. Oz to push
613360	615560	ahead slightly in the polls for the first time.
615560	620220	But despite this, Fetterman still ultimately won the election, with 51.3% of the vote.
620220	623380	Leftoids shrieked that it was all rigged, or that Americans were retired enough to have
623380	625140	voted for a retard themselves.
625140	628060	Leftoids declared that Fetterman was perfectly capable of being a senator, that doctors had
628060	631940	cleared him for the job, and that the right-wing response towards Fetterman was simply ableist
631940	632940	bigotry.
632940	635680	And ultimately, the leftoids were correct on this topic.
635680	637740	There's no evidence of voter fraud in this election.
637740	640700	There's no evidence of actual cognitive impairment.
640700	644580	Considering Fetterman's history, especially compared to Dr. Oz's, it shouldn't be surprising
644580	646260	that he won, disabled or not.
646260	647660	Look at it this way.
647660	651880	Dr. Oz is a TV celebrity-turned-politician, and I think the American appetite for that
651880	654780	sort of thing is beginning to run out, especially after Trump.
654780	657560	The hydroxychloroquine thing became a huge meme.
657560	660420	Being the source of that laughing stock isn't a good thing.
660420	663860	Meanwhile, Fetterman's record, for better or worse, actually speaks to him being an
663860	664900	outsider.
664900	667580	He looks and carries himself like a working-class guy.
667580	669760	He has a decent track record working in charity.
669760	670760	He speaks from the heart.
670760	671760	He shoots from the hip.
671760	672760	He embraces memes.
672760	674360	He's not really a politician.
674360	676700	But not being a politician is a double-edged sword.
676740	681260	He's an ideologue, and he's not above subverting the process or bypassing the system if he's
681260	682540	not getting his way.
682540	686260	His go-it-alone attitude means that he's not as corrupted by outside influence, but
686260	690180	it also means that he has few friends and little experience at negotiating.
690180	693180	There are strengths to the Fetterman approach, and they make him appealing to your average
693180	694180	voter.
694180	695860	But there are weaknesses too, and they can't be ignored.
695860	700180	Moreover, now that Fetterman's moved on from Braddock, it's hard to view his stay
700180	702820	there as anything more than a stepping stone in his career.
702820	705980	In Fetterman's absence, Braddock has basically collapsed.
705980	708180	None of his initiatives produced lasting improvements.
708180	712300	The community gardens were all run by Fetterman's charity connections, and when he left, they
712300	714140	left, causing them to fall into decay.
714140	718340	The businesses he brought to town with his outside people, most notably a celebrity chef
718340	720020	restaurant, also left with him.
720020	723900	And while the previous statistic about Braddock's murder rate was accurate, that's not the
723900	724900	whole story.
724900	730420	Robberies, assaults, and burglaries actually rose during Fetterman's term as mayor, despite
730420	732460	a rapidly declining population.
732460	735540	After Fetterman's election, the buzz around him began to quiet down.
735540	739260	He had a second medical problem back in February, which doctors say is unrelated to the stroke,
739260	742220	but which right-wingers claim is just more proof that he's not all there.
742220	746860	He is occasionally insulted by the right and lauded by the left for his lack of decorum,
746860	749500	showing up to official functions in a hoodie and shorts.
749500	752020	To be fair, he really is that working-class type of guy.
752020	754540	Look at him wearing a suit getting sworn in as lieutenant governor.
754540	756540	It just doesn't look right, does it?
756540	760140	Fetterman is definitely this lower-class dude, and I'm not saying that as an insult.
760140	761560	He just fits the aesthetic.
761560	766040	The slow decline of John Fetterman, however, has nothing to do with his health or his election
766040	768280	or any of the things that right-wingers remember him for.
768280	771880	In fact, it has to do with the left, with a delicious bit of irony that I'd like to
771880	773120	now present to you.
773120	777600	We all know that the left purity spirals, it eats its own, and John Fetterman, the once
777600	782820	rising star of the Democratic Party, is now the latest victim of the leftist Ouroboros.
782820	787840	After that October 7th Hamas attack, Fetterman came out in support of Israel, and he immediately
787840	792300	lost all of that grassroots support from the rank-and-file American left.
792300	796000	You know, his only real power base, since he doesn't play the political game nearly
796000	797920	as often as other politicians.
797920	802160	People who once cheered on his lack of decorum, him wearing hoodies to the Senate while rightoids
802160	806640	raging on, they were now flipping on him, saying how awful he looked, or saying he didn't
806640	810200	get that anti-establishment cred anymore if he was going to side with Israel.
810200	813960	People who once called the rightoids bigoted for claiming his stroke left him unfit for
813960	818560	office, are now either mocking him for that stroke, or claiming that the stroke is why
818560	821640	he's pro-Israel, implying he's unfit for office.
821640	825000	Of course, there are some right-wingers being hypocritical too, claiming his current stance
825000	827740	is based when they were calling him a vegetable a year ago.
827740	830700	At the very least, Fetterman himself is rolling with the punches.
830700	834680	He told a pro-Palestine heckler at one of his events that he had a stroke recently and
834680	836960	can't understand him, which is pretty funny.
836960	839880	But some leftoids have even latched on to that, saying that this is proof he's not
839880	843380	fit for office, either because he can't actually understand them, or because brushing
843420	846140	off their comrade like that is just unacceptable.
846140	849620	The decline of John Fetterman is not going to be about his health, or his election, or
849620	850620	his history.
850620	854660	It's going to be due to the fact that he took up an unpopular yet principled stance
854660	858400	that all of his supporters disagree with, and he did it knowing it would damage the
858400	859980	image he's cultivated.
859980	863300	There's a decent chance that this is going to end his political career come next election.
863300	864300	And you know what?
864300	865300	Good for him.
865300	868700	I know what it's like to take an unpopular yet principled stance that my supporters disagree
868700	870540	with, and then suffer for that choice.
870540	874020	Regardless of anything else he's done, I can respect him for sticking to his values
874020	876020	even if they prove to be unpopular.
876020	878180	Plus, the pro-Israel take is the correct one.
878180	878780	Suck it nerds.
