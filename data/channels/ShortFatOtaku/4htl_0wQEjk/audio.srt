1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,720
John Fetterman

2
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:10,560
The October 7th terrorist attack in Israel has truly melted people's brains.

3
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:15,040
I'm not yet prepared to do a deep dive video on that whole thing, and you know me, there's

4
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:19,100
a decent chance it'll be old news by the time I'm done, but I would like to quickly

5
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:22,260
talk about one funny quirk that has come out of the whole thing.

6
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:24,160
This man is John Fetterman.

7
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:27,940
He represents something very different to you if you're on the American left or the

8
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:29,140
American right.

9
00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:33,400
If right, he's a sign in a long list of signs showing that American democracy has

10
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:38,300
failed, that the American people are either so stupid or so ideological that they would

11
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:43,800
elect a brain-damaged retard just as long as there is a D beside his name.

12
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:46,900
But if you're on the left, this conversation becomes a lot weirder.

13
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:48,540
Let's go back to the beginning.

14
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:51,600
John Fetterman described his upbringing as privileged.

15
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:55,900
He was born when his parents were both 19, but his dad made a good living working in

16
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:56,900
insurance.

17
00:00:56,900 --> 00:01:00,560
He was a conservative entrepreneurial type, and Fetterman's life plan was to take over

18
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:02,360
his dad's startup after school.

19
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:06,600
However, while getting a Master's of Business Administration from the University of Connecticut

20
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:11,000
in 1993, Fetterman's best friend died in a car accident.

21
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,460
As a result, he felt compelled to join the charity group Big Brothers Big Sisters of

22
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:19,800
America, where adults mentor young people who don't have adult role models in their

23
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:20,800
lives.

24
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:24,520
He was paired with an eight-year-old boy whose father died of AIDS and whose mother was on

25
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:25,520
the way out.

26
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:29,300
It was Fetterman's experience working at the charity that ultimately caused his politics

27
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:32,880
to drift away from the rugged individualism of his parents.

28
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:38,200
In his own words, he became preoccupied with the concept of the random lottery of birth.

29
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:43,100
Fetterman continued his charity work until 2005, when he ran for the mayor of Braddock,

30
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:44,100
Pennsylvania.

31
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:48,200
He had moved to Braddock to start a charity in 2001, helping underprivileged youth finish

32
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,200
their schooling.

33
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,520
He won the mayoral race by just one vote.

34
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:56,480
In 2009's election for the same position, he faced Jamie Cox, who accused Fetterman

35
00:01:56,480 --> 00:02:01,220
of simply bulldozing his opposition and failing to build consensus with the city council.

36
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:05,180
In response, Fetterman released local police records showing that Cox had been arrested

37
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:06,820
in 2004.

38
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:11,140
These records weren't public, and Fetterman abusing his mayoral authority to release them

39
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:15,560
constituted a violation of Pennsylvania's Criminal History Record Information Act.

40
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:20,160
Nonetheless, it was enough to tar Cox's image, and Fetterman won the 2009 election.

41
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:26,040
His popularity only grew after this incident, and he ran unopposed in 2013 and 2017.

42
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:30,980
It was during his tenure as the mayor of Braddock that Fetterman became a Democrat rising star.

43
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:35,160
The town only had 2,000 residents, one major employer in the local hospital, and the mayor

44
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:37,480
job only paid $150 a month.

45
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:41,920
This was a small pond, all in all, but Fetterman turned the town into his own personal fix-up

46
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:44,680
project, with both good and bad results.

47
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:48,480
He used his authority to purchase neglected buildings and fix them up on his dime.

48
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:52,240
He bought an abandoned church and lived in it himself for several months, while renovating

49
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,660
it into a community center.

50
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:58,100
He turned vacant lots into parks, public gardens, and in one case, the town's first public

51
00:02:58,100 --> 00:02:59,400
basketball court.

52
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:03,200
There were no murders in the town for five straight years under his watch.

53
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:07,120
Before, Braddock had an abnormally high murder rate for its size.

54
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,560
But it wasn't all sunshine and roses.

55
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:13,400
Fetterman found the city council's perpetual gridlock annoying, so he bypassed them by

56
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:16,020
rooting all of his initiatives through his charities.

57
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:19,640
His father foot the bill for some initial plans, and he used his charity connections

58
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:22,220
to acquire funding for a lot of these projects.

59
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:26,260
This limited Democratic input from the residents of the town, and among Fetterman's opponents,

60
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:30,020
there was a feeling that he was bypassing the city council and unilaterally implementing

61
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:34,820
his plans because he knew he didn't have the political support to do it above board.

62
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:38,580
Nonetheless, Fetterman had become known in the Democratic party for his Braddock success,

63
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:41,100
and it was time for him to advance his career.

64
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:45,740
In 2018, he ran for the Democratic nomination for the lieutenant governor of Pennsylvania.

65
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:49,400
The Democratic incumbent, Mike Stack, was being investigated at the time for abusing

66
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:53,540
his staff and mistreating Pennsylvania state troopers, and Pennsylvania Democrats wanted

67
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:55,540
to be rid of the Stack scandal.

68
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:59,940
With several high-profile endorsements, most notably Bernie Sanders, he won the Democratic

69
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:03,980
nomination, and the Wolf-Fetterman ticket beat out the Republicans for the governor

70
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:05,300
of Pennsylvania.

71
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:09,860
As lieutenant governor, Fetterman kept what the Associated Press called a light work schedule.

72
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:13,100
They looked into his official work calendar and discovered that from his inauguration

73
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:19,300
in January 2019 until May of 2022, his official schedule was blank for one-third of all eligible

74
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:20,400
work days.

75
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:24,740
The days that he did work, he tended to only work on average for four to five hours.

76
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:29,400
In 2020, he presided over only half of the Pennsylvania state senate sessions, an official

77
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:30,980
duty of lieutenant governor.

78
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:34,740
In 2021, he was there for only a third of the sessions.

79
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:37,440
Lieutenant governor also oversees the state parole board.

80
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:41,980
The Philadelphia Inquirer reported that Fetterman ran the board with the heart of an activist

81
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:44,220
and at times the force of a bully.

82
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:48,580
Pardons for criminals serving jail time in Pennsylvania increased under his watch.

83
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:52,860
The most high-profile event in this regard was when Fetterman implemented a one-time

84
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:58,060
widespread pardoning project for people who had committed minor, non-violent marijuana-related

85
00:04:58,060 --> 00:04:59,060
offenses.

86
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:04,540
John Fetterman first received nationwide recognition during the 2020 presidential election.

87
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:07,940
Fetterman declared that Donald Trump was just an internet troll, and in response to Trump

88
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:13,060
threatening to sue Pennsylvania for voter fraud, he said that Trump can sue a ham sandwich.

89
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:17,660
Texas Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick offered a reward of $1 million for anybody who could

90
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:21,420
prove a case of fraud in the states that Trump had filed lawsuits.

91
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:25,520
Investigations in Pennsylvania uncovered three fraudulent votes.

92
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:29,720
Trump needed another $81,000 to win, by the way, and all three of these fraudulent votes

93
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,860
were actually cast for Trump.

94
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:36,340
Two men had voted in the name of their recently deceased mothers, and a third had voted in

95
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:37,620
the name of his son.

96
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:43,920
Fetterman joked online that Pennsylvania deserved $3 million from Texas, as they had indeed

97
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:46,380
discovered three cases of voter fraud.

98
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:48,900
This event gave Fetterman a national spotlight.

99
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:53,340
He had unsuccessfully run for the Democratic nomination of the U.S. Senate before in 2016,

100
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:56,020
but in 2022 he was high-profile enough to win.

101
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:57,940
It was an uphill climb, though.

102
00:05:57,940 --> 00:06:01,760
Fetterman was popular with regular people, but he had few friends in politics.

103
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:04,980
He ran the lieutenant governor's office the same way he ran the Braddock mayor's

104
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:09,880
office, doing things his way with his people, preferring to re-route around official impediments

105
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:12,300
to his plans rather than negotiate with them.

106
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:16,580
Subsequently, despite his popularity on the ground, he had very few official endorsements

107
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:18,460
from other Democrat party members.

108
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:21,980
One Pennsylvania House representative was quoted as saying that Fetterman never came

109
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:24,740
and introduced himself to me or any of my colleagues.

110
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:28,020
If a lieutenant governor doesn't take the time to get to talk to somebody like me, then

111
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:30,700
why would we want to send somebody like him to D.C.?

112
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:35,820
Nevertheless, Fetterman won the Democratic primary in a landslide taking 58% of the vote.

113
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:38,100
The next closest challenger had only 26%.

114
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:42,480
However, Fetterman's wife gave his victory speech, because he was hospitalized.

115
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:44,540
He had a stroke a few days earlier.

116
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:49,460
Back in 2017, he was diagnosed with arterial fibrillation, an irregular heart rhythm, and

117
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:50,780
a decreased heart pump.

118
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:54,260
Basically, his heart wasn't consistently pumping on rhythm, and his blood wasn't

119
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:56,340
circulating everywhere it needed to go.

120
00:06:56,340 --> 00:07:00,060
Fetterman chose to ignore the diagnosis and took none of his medication, did none of the

121
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:03,300
exercises, and refused to go to the doctors for five years.

122
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:08,720
The problem caused his stroke in May of 2022, and left him with an auditory processing disorder.

123
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:12,020
His brain can't interpret what he hears consistently anymore.

124
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:15,260
Since then, Fetterman's doctor claims that he's been attending speech therapy, he's

125
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:18,860
been working out and taking all of his meds, and that the stroke hasn't left him mentally

126
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:21,100
impaired, he just has disabled hearing.

127
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:23,700
The 2022 Senate election was pretty brutal.

128
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:26,260
This is likely what most of you remember about John Fetterman.

129
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:30,560
He faced off against the celebrity TV star turned Republican nominee, Dr. Oz.

130
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,820
It was a bloody race.

131
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:35,660
Fetterman's campaign latched onto the narrative that Dr. Oz was a carpetbagger, someone who

132
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:39,460
moved to a different location in order to capitalize on a vacant political seat, rather

133
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:41,660
than actually having any ties to that location.

134
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:46,020
Dr. Oz was from New Jersey, not Pennsylvania, and Fetterman went around recording videos

135
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:49,300
with Jersey Shore celebrities to troll Dr. Oz.

136
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:54,620
His campaign also focused on Dr. Oz's tenure as a medical advisor to the Trump administration.

137
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:59,400
The whole hydroxychloroquine thing for COVID was initially pushed by Dr. Oz on dozens of

138
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:02,700
TV appearances, influencing Trump's decision to take it.

139
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:08,540
Dr. Oz owned $630,000 worth of stock in companies that manufactured the drug.

140
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:12,560
Meanwhile, Dr. Oz's campaign went for just as many low blows.

141
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:16,780
They publicized an incident from 2013 where Fetterman, back in the Braddock mayor job,

142
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:21,500
heard a sound he thought was gunfire and followed an unarmed black jogger whom he detained with

143
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:22,540
his shotgun.

144
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:23,660
The jogger was innocent.

145
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:26,220
He thought the gunfire was kids playing with fireworks.

146
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:30,220
No charges were filed against either party in the end, but the incident was uncovered

147
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:32,640
to try and paint Fetterman as a racist.

148
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:35,500
Fetterman stated that this event happened right after the Sandy Hook school shooting,

149
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:39,140
that the jogger was near the city school, and that he was afraid of a copycat crime.

150
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:42,960
Dr. Oz's campaign also latched onto the narrative that Fetterman's stroke had not

151
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:47,220
only left him with a hearing impediment, but also had rendered him mentally disabled.

152
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:50,980
Fetterman took four months to appear in public again, finally showing up at a rally in August

153
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:52,480
of 2022.

154
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:56,320
The school reported that he appeared physically healthy and mostly talk without issue, but

155
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,880
his speech was halted.

156
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:01,840
In October of 2022, Fetterman gave his first interview since the stroke.

157
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:06,600
He required real-time closed captioning technology to be able to read the reporter's questions.

158
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:10,000
And before the interview, the reporter mused that she didn't know if he could understand

159
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
her at all.

160
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,680
Eventually, Fetterman and Dr. Oz debated on October 25th.

161
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:16,160
Fetterman struggled during the debate.

162
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:18,080
His speech was once again halting.

163
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,120
He was missing words.

164
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:21,340
He was pausing at awkward spots and sentences.

165
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:22,660
It was a wreck.

166
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:26,400
After this event, the mainstream Republican establishment pounced on the narrative that

167
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:30,860
Fetterman was not fit for office, that it wasn't just speech or hearing impairment,

168
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:32,400
it was mental impairment.

169
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:34,540
This narrative still persists to this day.

170
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:38,000
Right-leaning Americans basically believe that Fetterman is a vegetable whose only purpose

171
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,100
is to be a warm Democrat body in the office, and that his staff are the ones doing most

172
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:43,100
of the work.

173
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:47,100
This plays into a larger narrative about Democrats, that even if their candidates and officers

174
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:50,880
have one foot in the grave, like Biden or Pelosi, who cares?

175
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:55,320
All that matters is that it's a D in the position instead of an R. Common Republican criticism

176
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:59,320
about the whole affair is that the Democrats will take corpses, they'll take retards, they'll

177
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:01,320
take whoever they can as long as they win.

178
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:05,680
And sometimes, that it's just obvious American votes have to be rigged, because who in their

179
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:08,800
right mind would vote for a corpse or a retard?

180
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:13,360
Fetterman's poor, but frankly expected, debate performance actually allowed Dr. Oz to push

181
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,560
ahead slightly in the polls for the first time.

182
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:20,220
But despite this, Fetterman still ultimately won the election, with 51.3% of the vote.

183
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:23,380
Leftoids shrieked that it was all rigged, or that Americans were retired enough to have

184
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:25,140
voted for a retard themselves.

185
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:28,060
Leftoids declared that Fetterman was perfectly capable of being a senator, that doctors had

186
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:31,940
cleared him for the job, and that the right-wing response towards Fetterman was simply ableist

187
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:32,940
bigotry.

188
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:35,680
And ultimately, the leftoids were correct on this topic.

189
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,740
There's no evidence of voter fraud in this election.

190
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:40,700
There's no evidence of actual cognitive impairment.

191
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:44,580
Considering Fetterman's history, especially compared to Dr. Oz's, it shouldn't be surprising

192
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:46,260
that he won, disabled or not.

193
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:47,660
Look at it this way.

194
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:51,880
Dr. Oz is a TV celebrity-turned-politician, and I think the American appetite for that

195
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:54,780
sort of thing is beginning to run out, especially after Trump.

196
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:57,560
The hydroxychloroquine thing became a huge meme.

197
00:10:57,560 --> 00:11:00,420
Being the source of that laughing stock isn't a good thing.

198
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:03,860
Meanwhile, Fetterman's record, for better or worse, actually speaks to him being an

199
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:04,900
outsider.

200
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:07,580
He looks and carries himself like a working-class guy.

201
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:09,760
He has a decent track record working in charity.

202
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:10,760
He speaks from the heart.

203
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:11,760
He shoots from the hip.

204
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:12,760
He embraces memes.

205
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:14,360
He's not really a politician.

206
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:16,700
But not being a politician is a double-edged sword.

207
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:21,260
He's an ideologue, and he's not above subverting the process or bypassing the system if he's

208
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:22,540
not getting his way.

209
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:26,260
His go-it-alone attitude means that he's not as corrupted by outside influence, but

210
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:30,180
it also means that he has few friends and little experience at negotiating.

211
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:33,180
There are strengths to the Fetterman approach, and they make him appealing to your average

212
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:34,180
voter.

213
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:35,860
But there are weaknesses too, and they can't be ignored.

214
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:40,180
Moreover, now that Fetterman's moved on from Braddock, it's hard to view his stay

215
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:42,820
there as anything more than a stepping stone in his career.

216
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:45,980
In Fetterman's absence, Braddock has basically collapsed.

217
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:48,180
None of his initiatives produced lasting improvements.

218
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:52,300
The community gardens were all run by Fetterman's charity connections, and when he left, they

219
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:54,140
left, causing them to fall into decay.

220
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:58,340
The businesses he brought to town with his outside people, most notably a celebrity chef

221
00:11:58,340 --> 00:12:00,020
restaurant, also left with him.

222
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:03,900
And while the previous statistic about Braddock's murder rate was accurate, that's not the

223
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:04,900
whole story.

224
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:10,420
Robberies, assaults, and burglaries actually rose during Fetterman's term as mayor, despite

225
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:12,460
a rapidly declining population.

226
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:15,540
After Fetterman's election, the buzz around him began to quiet down.

227
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:19,260
He had a second medical problem back in February, which doctors say is unrelated to the stroke,

228
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:22,220
but which right-wingers claim is just more proof that he's not all there.

229
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:26,860
He is occasionally insulted by the right and lauded by the left for his lack of decorum,

230
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:29,500
showing up to official functions in a hoodie and shorts.

231
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:32,020
To be fair, he really is that working-class type of guy.

232
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:34,540
Look at him wearing a suit getting sworn in as lieutenant governor.

233
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:36,540
It just doesn't look right, does it?

234
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:40,140
Fetterman is definitely this lower-class dude, and I'm not saying that as an insult.

235
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:41,560
He just fits the aesthetic.

236
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:46,040
The slow decline of John Fetterman, however, has nothing to do with his health or his election

237
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:48,280
or any of the things that right-wingers remember him for.

238
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:51,880
In fact, it has to do with the left, with a delicious bit of irony that I'd like to

239
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:53,120
now present to you.

240
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:57,600
We all know that the left purity spirals, it eats its own, and John Fetterman, the once

241
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:02,820
rising star of the Democratic Party, is now the latest victim of the leftist Ouroboros.

242
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:07,840
After that October 7th Hamas attack, Fetterman came out in support of Israel, and he immediately

243
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:12,300
lost all of that grassroots support from the rank-and-file American left.

244
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:16,000
You know, his only real power base, since he doesn't play the political game nearly

245
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,920
as often as other politicians.

246
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:22,160
People who once cheered on his lack of decorum, him wearing hoodies to the Senate while rightoids

247
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:26,640
raging on, they were now flipping on him, saying how awful he looked, or saying he didn't

248
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:30,200
get that anti-establishment cred anymore if he was going to side with Israel.

249
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:33,960
People who once called the rightoids bigoted for claiming his stroke left him unfit for

250
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:38,560
office, are now either mocking him for that stroke, or claiming that the stroke is why

251
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:41,640
he's pro-Israel, implying he's unfit for office.

252
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:45,000
Of course, there are some right-wingers being hypocritical too, claiming his current stance

253
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,740
is based when they were calling him a vegetable a year ago.

254
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:50,700
At the very least, Fetterman himself is rolling with the punches.

255
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:54,680
He told a pro-Palestine heckler at one of his events that he had a stroke recently and

256
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:56,960
can't understand him, which is pretty funny.

257
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:59,880
But some leftoids have even latched on to that, saying that this is proof he's not

258
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:03,380
fit for office, either because he can't actually understand them, or because brushing

259
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:06,140
off their comrade like that is just unacceptable.

260
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:09,620
The decline of John Fetterman is not going to be about his health, or his election, or

261
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:10,620
his history.

262
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:14,660
It's going to be due to the fact that he took up an unpopular yet principled stance

263
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:18,400
that all of his supporters disagree with, and he did it knowing it would damage the

264
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:19,980
image he's cultivated.

265
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:23,300
There's a decent chance that this is going to end his political career come next election.

266
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:24,300
And you know what?

267
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:25,300
Good for him.

268
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:28,700
I know what it's like to take an unpopular yet principled stance that my supporters disagree

269
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:30,540
with, and then suffer for that choice.

270
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:34,020
Regardless of anything else he's done, I can respect him for sticking to his values

271
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:36,020
even if they prove to be unpopular.

272
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:38,180
Plus, the pro-Israel take is the correct one.

273
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:38,780
Suck it nerds.
