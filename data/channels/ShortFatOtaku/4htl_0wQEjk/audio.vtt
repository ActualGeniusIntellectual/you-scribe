00:00.000 --> 00:05.720
John Fetterman

00:05.720 --> 00:10.560
The October 7th terrorist attack in Israel has truly melted people's brains.

00:10.560 --> 00:15.040
I'm not yet prepared to do a deep dive video on that whole thing, and you know me, there's

00:15.040 --> 00:19.100
a decent chance it'll be old news by the time I'm done, but I would like to quickly

00:19.100 --> 00:22.260
talk about one funny quirk that has come out of the whole thing.

00:22.260 --> 00:24.160
This man is John Fetterman.

00:24.160 --> 00:27.940
He represents something very different to you if you're on the American left or the

00:27.940 --> 00:29.140
American right.

00:29.140 --> 00:33.400
If right, he's a sign in a long list of signs showing that American democracy has

00:33.400 --> 00:38.300
failed, that the American people are either so stupid or so ideological that they would

00:38.300 --> 00:43.800
elect a brain-damaged retard just as long as there is a D beside his name.

00:43.800 --> 00:46.900
But if you're on the left, this conversation becomes a lot weirder.

00:46.900 --> 00:48.540
Let's go back to the beginning.

00:48.540 --> 00:51.600
John Fetterman described his upbringing as privileged.

00:51.600 --> 00:55.900
He was born when his parents were both 19, but his dad made a good living working in

00:55.900 --> 00:56.900
insurance.

00:56.900 --> 01:00.560
He was a conservative entrepreneurial type, and Fetterman's life plan was to take over

01:00.560 --> 01:02.360
his dad's startup after school.

01:02.360 --> 01:06.600
However, while getting a Master's of Business Administration from the University of Connecticut

01:06.600 --> 01:11.000
in 1993, Fetterman's best friend died in a car accident.

01:11.000 --> 01:15.460
As a result, he felt compelled to join the charity group Big Brothers Big Sisters of

01:15.460 --> 01:19.800
America, where adults mentor young people who don't have adult role models in their

01:19.800 --> 01:20.800
lives.

01:20.800 --> 01:24.520
He was paired with an eight-year-old boy whose father died of AIDS and whose mother was on

01:24.520 --> 01:25.520
the way out.

01:25.520 --> 01:29.300
It was Fetterman's experience working at the charity that ultimately caused his politics

01:29.300 --> 01:32.880
to drift away from the rugged individualism of his parents.

01:32.880 --> 01:38.200
In his own words, he became preoccupied with the concept of the random lottery of birth.

01:38.200 --> 01:43.100
Fetterman continued his charity work until 2005, when he ran for the mayor of Braddock,

01:43.100 --> 01:44.100
Pennsylvania.

01:44.100 --> 01:48.200
He had moved to Braddock to start a charity in 2001, helping underprivileged youth finish

01:48.200 --> 01:49.200
their schooling.

01:49.200 --> 01:51.520
He won the mayoral race by just one vote.

01:51.520 --> 01:56.480
In 2009's election for the same position, he faced Jamie Cox, who accused Fetterman

01:56.480 --> 02:01.220
of simply bulldozing his opposition and failing to build consensus with the city council.

02:01.220 --> 02:05.180
In response, Fetterman released local police records showing that Cox had been arrested

02:05.180 --> 02:06.820
in 2004.

02:06.820 --> 02:11.140
These records weren't public, and Fetterman abusing his mayoral authority to release them

02:11.140 --> 02:15.560
constituted a violation of Pennsylvania's Criminal History Record Information Act.

02:15.560 --> 02:20.160
Nonetheless, it was enough to tar Cox's image, and Fetterman won the 2009 election.

02:20.160 --> 02:26.040
His popularity only grew after this incident, and he ran unopposed in 2013 and 2017.

02:26.040 --> 02:30.980
It was during his tenure as the mayor of Braddock that Fetterman became a Democrat rising star.

02:30.980 --> 02:35.160
The town only had 2,000 residents, one major employer in the local hospital, and the mayor

02:35.160 --> 02:37.480
job only paid $150 a month.

02:37.480 --> 02:41.920
This was a small pond, all in all, but Fetterman turned the town into his own personal fix-up

02:41.920 --> 02:44.680
project, with both good and bad results.

02:44.680 --> 02:48.480
He used his authority to purchase neglected buildings and fix them up on his dime.

02:48.480 --> 02:52.240
He bought an abandoned church and lived in it himself for several months, while renovating

02:52.240 --> 02:53.660
it into a community center.

02:53.660 --> 02:58.100
He turned vacant lots into parks, public gardens, and in one case, the town's first public

02:58.100 --> 02:59.400
basketball court.

02:59.400 --> 03:03.200
There were no murders in the town for five straight years under his watch.

03:03.200 --> 03:07.120
Before, Braddock had an abnormally high murder rate for its size.

03:07.120 --> 03:09.560
But it wasn't all sunshine and roses.

03:09.560 --> 03:13.400
Fetterman found the city council's perpetual gridlock annoying, so he bypassed them by

03:13.400 --> 03:16.020
rooting all of his initiatives through his charities.

03:16.020 --> 03:19.640
His father foot the bill for some initial plans, and he used his charity connections

03:19.640 --> 03:22.220
to acquire funding for a lot of these projects.

03:22.220 --> 03:26.260
This limited Democratic input from the residents of the town, and among Fetterman's opponents,

03:26.260 --> 03:30.020
there was a feeling that he was bypassing the city council and unilaterally implementing

03:30.020 --> 03:34.820
his plans because he knew he didn't have the political support to do it above board.

03:34.820 --> 03:38.580
Nonetheless, Fetterman had become known in the Democratic party for his Braddock success,

03:38.580 --> 03:41.100
and it was time for him to advance his career.

03:41.100 --> 03:45.740
In 2018, he ran for the Democratic nomination for the lieutenant governor of Pennsylvania.

03:45.740 --> 03:49.400
The Democratic incumbent, Mike Stack, was being investigated at the time for abusing

03:49.400 --> 03:53.540
his staff and mistreating Pennsylvania state troopers, and Pennsylvania Democrats wanted

03:53.540 --> 03:55.540
to be rid of the Stack scandal.

03:55.540 --> 03:59.940
With several high-profile endorsements, most notably Bernie Sanders, he won the Democratic

03:59.940 --> 04:03.980
nomination, and the Wolf-Fetterman ticket beat out the Republicans for the governor

04:03.980 --> 04:05.300
of Pennsylvania.

04:05.300 --> 04:09.860
As lieutenant governor, Fetterman kept what the Associated Press called a light work schedule.

04:09.860 --> 04:13.100
They looked into his official work calendar and discovered that from his inauguration

04:13.100 --> 04:19.300
in January 2019 until May of 2022, his official schedule was blank for one-third of all eligible

04:19.300 --> 04:20.400
work days.

04:20.400 --> 04:24.740
The days that he did work, he tended to only work on average for four to five hours.

04:24.740 --> 04:29.400
In 2020, he presided over only half of the Pennsylvania state senate sessions, an official

04:29.400 --> 04:30.980
duty of lieutenant governor.

04:30.980 --> 04:34.740
In 2021, he was there for only a third of the sessions.

04:34.740 --> 04:37.440
Lieutenant governor also oversees the state parole board.

04:37.440 --> 04:41.980
The Philadelphia Inquirer reported that Fetterman ran the board with the heart of an activist

04:41.980 --> 04:44.220
and at times the force of a bully.

04:44.220 --> 04:48.580
Pardons for criminals serving jail time in Pennsylvania increased under his watch.

04:48.580 --> 04:52.860
The most high-profile event in this regard was when Fetterman implemented a one-time

04:52.860 --> 04:58.060
widespread pardoning project for people who had committed minor, non-violent marijuana-related

04:58.060 --> 04:59.060
offenses.

04:59.060 --> 05:04.540
John Fetterman first received nationwide recognition during the 2020 presidential election.

05:04.540 --> 05:07.940
Fetterman declared that Donald Trump was just an internet troll, and in response to Trump

05:07.940 --> 05:13.060
threatening to sue Pennsylvania for voter fraud, he said that Trump can sue a ham sandwich.

05:13.060 --> 05:17.660
Texas Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick offered a reward of $1 million for anybody who could

05:17.660 --> 05:21.420
prove a case of fraud in the states that Trump had filed lawsuits.

05:21.420 --> 05:25.520
Investigations in Pennsylvania uncovered three fraudulent votes.

05:25.520 --> 05:29.720
Trump needed another $81,000 to win, by the way, and all three of these fraudulent votes

05:29.720 --> 05:31.860
were actually cast for Trump.

05:31.860 --> 05:36.340
Two men had voted in the name of their recently deceased mothers, and a third had voted in

05:36.340 --> 05:37.620
the name of his son.

05:38.300 --> 05:43.920
Fetterman joked online that Pennsylvania deserved $3 million from Texas, as they had indeed

05:43.920 --> 05:46.380
discovered three cases of voter fraud.

05:46.380 --> 05:48.900
This event gave Fetterman a national spotlight.

05:48.900 --> 05:53.340
He had unsuccessfully run for the Democratic nomination of the U.S. Senate before in 2016,

05:53.340 --> 05:56.020
but in 2022 he was high-profile enough to win.

05:56.020 --> 05:57.940
It was an uphill climb, though.

05:57.940 --> 06:01.760
Fetterman was popular with regular people, but he had few friends in politics.

06:01.760 --> 06:04.980
He ran the lieutenant governor's office the same way he ran the Braddock mayor's

06:04.980 --> 06:09.880
office, doing things his way with his people, preferring to re-route around official impediments

06:09.880 --> 06:12.300
to his plans rather than negotiate with them.

06:12.300 --> 06:16.580
Subsequently, despite his popularity on the ground, he had very few official endorsements

06:16.580 --> 06:18.460
from other Democrat party members.

06:18.460 --> 06:21.980
One Pennsylvania House representative was quoted as saying that Fetterman never came

06:21.980 --> 06:24.740
and introduced himself to me or any of my colleagues.

06:24.740 --> 06:28.020
If a lieutenant governor doesn't take the time to get to talk to somebody like me, then

06:28.020 --> 06:30.700
why would we want to send somebody like him to D.C.?

06:30.700 --> 06:35.820
Nevertheless, Fetterman won the Democratic primary in a landslide taking 58% of the vote.

06:35.820 --> 06:38.100
The next closest challenger had only 26%.

06:38.100 --> 06:42.480
However, Fetterman's wife gave his victory speech, because he was hospitalized.

06:42.480 --> 06:44.540
He had a stroke a few days earlier.

06:44.540 --> 06:49.460
Back in 2017, he was diagnosed with arterial fibrillation, an irregular heart rhythm, and

06:49.460 --> 06:50.780
a decreased heart pump.

06:50.780 --> 06:54.260
Basically, his heart wasn't consistently pumping on rhythm, and his blood wasn't

06:54.260 --> 06:56.340
circulating everywhere it needed to go.

06:56.340 --> 07:00.060
Fetterman chose to ignore the diagnosis and took none of his medication, did none of the

07:00.060 --> 07:03.300
exercises, and refused to go to the doctors for five years.

07:03.300 --> 07:08.720
The problem caused his stroke in May of 2022, and left him with an auditory processing disorder.

07:08.720 --> 07:12.020
His brain can't interpret what he hears consistently anymore.

07:12.020 --> 07:15.260
Since then, Fetterman's doctor claims that he's been attending speech therapy, he's

07:15.260 --> 07:18.860
been working out and taking all of his meds, and that the stroke hasn't left him mentally

07:18.860 --> 07:21.100
impaired, he just has disabled hearing.

07:21.100 --> 07:23.700
The 2022 Senate election was pretty brutal.

07:23.700 --> 07:26.260
This is likely what most of you remember about John Fetterman.

07:26.260 --> 07:30.560
He faced off against the celebrity TV star turned Republican nominee, Dr. Oz.

07:30.560 --> 07:31.820
It was a bloody race.

07:31.820 --> 07:35.660
Fetterman's campaign latched onto the narrative that Dr. Oz was a carpetbagger, someone who

07:35.660 --> 07:39.460
moved to a different location in order to capitalize on a vacant political seat, rather

07:39.460 --> 07:41.660
than actually having any ties to that location.

07:41.660 --> 07:46.020
Dr. Oz was from New Jersey, not Pennsylvania, and Fetterman went around recording videos

07:46.020 --> 07:49.300
with Jersey Shore celebrities to troll Dr. Oz.

07:49.300 --> 07:54.620
His campaign also focused on Dr. Oz's tenure as a medical advisor to the Trump administration.

07:54.620 --> 07:59.400
The whole hydroxychloroquine thing for COVID was initially pushed by Dr. Oz on dozens of

07:59.400 --> 08:02.700
TV appearances, influencing Trump's decision to take it.

08:02.700 --> 08:08.540
Dr. Oz owned $630,000 worth of stock in companies that manufactured the drug.

08:08.540 --> 08:12.560
Meanwhile, Dr. Oz's campaign went for just as many low blows.

08:12.560 --> 08:16.780
They publicized an incident from 2013 where Fetterman, back in the Braddock mayor job,

08:16.780 --> 08:21.500
heard a sound he thought was gunfire and followed an unarmed black jogger whom he detained with

08:21.500 --> 08:22.540
his shotgun.

08:22.540 --> 08:23.660
The jogger was innocent.

08:23.700 --> 08:26.220
He thought the gunfire was kids playing with fireworks.

08:26.220 --> 08:30.220
No charges were filed against either party in the end, but the incident was uncovered

08:30.220 --> 08:32.640
to try and paint Fetterman as a racist.

08:32.640 --> 08:35.500
Fetterman stated that this event happened right after the Sandy Hook school shooting,

08:35.500 --> 08:39.140
that the jogger was near the city school, and that he was afraid of a copycat crime.

08:39.140 --> 08:42.960
Dr. Oz's campaign also latched onto the narrative that Fetterman's stroke had not

08:42.960 --> 08:47.220
only left him with a hearing impediment, but also had rendered him mentally disabled.

08:47.220 --> 08:50.980
Fetterman took four months to appear in public again, finally showing up at a rally in August

08:50.980 --> 08:52.480
of 2022.

08:52.500 --> 08:56.320
The school reported that he appeared physically healthy and mostly talk without issue, but

08:56.320 --> 08:57.880
his speech was halted.

08:57.880 --> 09:01.840
In October of 2022, Fetterman gave his first interview since the stroke.

09:01.840 --> 09:06.600
He required real-time closed captioning technology to be able to read the reporter's questions.

09:06.600 --> 09:10.000
And before the interview, the reporter mused that she didn't know if he could understand

09:10.000 --> 09:11.000
her at all.

09:11.000 --> 09:14.680
Eventually, Fetterman and Dr. Oz debated on October 25th.

09:14.680 --> 09:16.160
Fetterman struggled during the debate.

09:16.160 --> 09:18.080
His speech was once again halting.

09:18.080 --> 09:19.120
He was missing words.

09:19.120 --> 09:21.340
He was pausing at awkward spots and sentences.

09:21.340 --> 09:22.660
It was a wreck.

09:22.660 --> 09:26.400
After this event, the mainstream Republican establishment pounced on the narrative that

09:26.400 --> 09:30.860
Fetterman was not fit for office, that it wasn't just speech or hearing impairment,

09:30.860 --> 09:32.400
it was mental impairment.

09:32.400 --> 09:34.540
This narrative still persists to this day.

09:34.540 --> 09:38.000
Right-leaning Americans basically believe that Fetterman is a vegetable whose only purpose

09:38.000 --> 09:42.100
is to be a warm Democrat body in the office, and that his staff are the ones doing most

09:42.100 --> 09:43.100
of the work.

09:43.100 --> 09:47.100
This plays into a larger narrative about Democrats, that even if their candidates and officers

09:47.100 --> 09:50.880
have one foot in the grave, like Biden or Pelosi, who cares?

09:50.920 --> 09:55.320
All that matters is that it's a D in the position instead of an R. Common Republican criticism

09:55.320 --> 09:59.320
about the whole affair is that the Democrats will take corpses, they'll take retards, they'll

09:59.320 --> 10:01.320
take whoever they can as long as they win.

10:01.320 --> 10:05.680
And sometimes, that it's just obvious American votes have to be rigged, because who in their

10:05.680 --> 10:08.800
right mind would vote for a corpse or a retard?

10:08.800 --> 10:13.360
Fetterman's poor, but frankly expected, debate performance actually allowed Dr. Oz to push

10:13.360 --> 10:15.560
ahead slightly in the polls for the first time.

10:15.560 --> 10:20.220
But despite this, Fetterman still ultimately won the election, with 51.3% of the vote.

10:20.220 --> 10:23.380
Leftoids shrieked that it was all rigged, or that Americans were retired enough to have

10:23.380 --> 10:25.140
voted for a retard themselves.

10:25.140 --> 10:28.060
Leftoids declared that Fetterman was perfectly capable of being a senator, that doctors had

10:28.060 --> 10:31.940
cleared him for the job, and that the right-wing response towards Fetterman was simply ableist

10:31.940 --> 10:32.940
bigotry.

10:32.940 --> 10:35.680
And ultimately, the leftoids were correct on this topic.

10:35.680 --> 10:37.740
There's no evidence of voter fraud in this election.

10:37.740 --> 10:40.700
There's no evidence of actual cognitive impairment.

10:40.700 --> 10:44.580
Considering Fetterman's history, especially compared to Dr. Oz's, it shouldn't be surprising

10:44.580 --> 10:46.260
that he won, disabled or not.

10:46.260 --> 10:47.660
Look at it this way.

10:47.660 --> 10:51.880
Dr. Oz is a TV celebrity-turned-politician, and I think the American appetite for that

10:51.880 --> 10:54.780
sort of thing is beginning to run out, especially after Trump.

10:54.780 --> 10:57.560
The hydroxychloroquine thing became a huge meme.

10:57.560 --> 11:00.420
Being the source of that laughing stock isn't a good thing.

11:00.420 --> 11:03.860
Meanwhile, Fetterman's record, for better or worse, actually speaks to him being an

11:03.860 --> 11:04.900
outsider.

11:04.900 --> 11:07.580
He looks and carries himself like a working-class guy.

11:07.580 --> 11:09.760
He has a decent track record working in charity.

11:09.760 --> 11:10.760
He speaks from the heart.

11:10.760 --> 11:11.760
He shoots from the hip.

11:11.760 --> 11:12.760
He embraces memes.

11:12.760 --> 11:14.360
He's not really a politician.

11:14.360 --> 11:16.700
But not being a politician is a double-edged sword.

11:16.740 --> 11:21.260
He's an ideologue, and he's not above subverting the process or bypassing the system if he's

11:21.260 --> 11:22.540
not getting his way.

11:22.540 --> 11:26.260
His go-it-alone attitude means that he's not as corrupted by outside influence, but

11:26.260 --> 11:30.180
it also means that he has few friends and little experience at negotiating.

11:30.180 --> 11:33.180
There are strengths to the Fetterman approach, and they make him appealing to your average

11:33.180 --> 11:34.180
voter.

11:34.180 --> 11:35.860
But there are weaknesses too, and they can't be ignored.

11:35.860 --> 11:40.180
Moreover, now that Fetterman's moved on from Braddock, it's hard to view his stay

11:40.180 --> 11:42.820
there as anything more than a stepping stone in his career.

11:42.820 --> 11:45.980
In Fetterman's absence, Braddock has basically collapsed.

11:45.980 --> 11:48.180
None of his initiatives produced lasting improvements.

11:48.180 --> 11:52.300
The community gardens were all run by Fetterman's charity connections, and when he left, they

11:52.300 --> 11:54.140
left, causing them to fall into decay.

11:54.140 --> 11:58.340
The businesses he brought to town with his outside people, most notably a celebrity chef

11:58.340 --> 12:00.020
restaurant, also left with him.

12:00.020 --> 12:03.900
And while the previous statistic about Braddock's murder rate was accurate, that's not the

12:03.900 --> 12:04.900
whole story.

12:04.900 --> 12:10.420
Robberies, assaults, and burglaries actually rose during Fetterman's term as mayor, despite

12:10.420 --> 12:12.460
a rapidly declining population.

12:12.460 --> 12:15.540
After Fetterman's election, the buzz around him began to quiet down.

12:15.540 --> 12:19.260
He had a second medical problem back in February, which doctors say is unrelated to the stroke,

12:19.260 --> 12:22.220
but which right-wingers claim is just more proof that he's not all there.

12:22.220 --> 12:26.860
He is occasionally insulted by the right and lauded by the left for his lack of decorum,

12:26.860 --> 12:29.500
showing up to official functions in a hoodie and shorts.

12:29.500 --> 12:32.020
To be fair, he really is that working-class type of guy.

12:32.020 --> 12:34.540
Look at him wearing a suit getting sworn in as lieutenant governor.

12:34.540 --> 12:36.540
It just doesn't look right, does it?

12:36.540 --> 12:40.140
Fetterman is definitely this lower-class dude, and I'm not saying that as an insult.

12:40.140 --> 12:41.560
He just fits the aesthetic.

12:41.560 --> 12:46.040
The slow decline of John Fetterman, however, has nothing to do with his health or his election

12:46.040 --> 12:48.280
or any of the things that right-wingers remember him for.

12:48.280 --> 12:51.880
In fact, it has to do with the left, with a delicious bit of irony that I'd like to

12:51.880 --> 12:53.120
now present to you.

12:53.120 --> 12:57.600
We all know that the left purity spirals, it eats its own, and John Fetterman, the once

12:57.600 --> 13:02.820
rising star of the Democratic Party, is now the latest victim of the leftist Ouroboros.

13:02.820 --> 13:07.840
After that October 7th Hamas attack, Fetterman came out in support of Israel, and he immediately

13:07.840 --> 13:12.300
lost all of that grassroots support from the rank-and-file American left.

13:12.300 --> 13:16.000
You know, his only real power base, since he doesn't play the political game nearly

13:16.000 --> 13:17.920
as often as other politicians.

13:17.920 --> 13:22.160
People who once cheered on his lack of decorum, him wearing hoodies to the Senate while rightoids

13:22.160 --> 13:26.640
raging on, they were now flipping on him, saying how awful he looked, or saying he didn't

13:26.640 --> 13:30.200
get that anti-establishment cred anymore if he was going to side with Israel.

13:30.200 --> 13:33.960
People who once called the rightoids bigoted for claiming his stroke left him unfit for

13:33.960 --> 13:38.560
office, are now either mocking him for that stroke, or claiming that the stroke is why

13:38.560 --> 13:41.640
he's pro-Israel, implying he's unfit for office.

13:41.640 --> 13:45.000
Of course, there are some right-wingers being hypocritical too, claiming his current stance

13:45.000 --> 13:47.740
is based when they were calling him a vegetable a year ago.

13:47.740 --> 13:50.700
At the very least, Fetterman himself is rolling with the punches.

13:50.700 --> 13:54.680
He told a pro-Palestine heckler at one of his events that he had a stroke recently and

13:54.680 --> 13:56.960
can't understand him, which is pretty funny.

13:56.960 --> 13:59.880
But some leftoids have even latched on to that, saying that this is proof he's not

13:59.880 --> 14:03.380
fit for office, either because he can't actually understand them, or because brushing

14:03.420 --> 14:06.140
off their comrade like that is just unacceptable.

14:06.140 --> 14:09.620
The decline of John Fetterman is not going to be about his health, or his election, or

14:09.620 --> 14:10.620
his history.

14:10.620 --> 14:14.660
It's going to be due to the fact that he took up an unpopular yet principled stance

14:14.660 --> 14:18.400
that all of his supporters disagree with, and he did it knowing it would damage the

14:18.400 --> 14:19.980
image he's cultivated.

14:19.980 --> 14:23.300
There's a decent chance that this is going to end his political career come next election.

14:23.300 --> 14:24.300
And you know what?

14:24.300 --> 14:25.300
Good for him.

14:25.300 --> 14:28.700
I know what it's like to take an unpopular yet principled stance that my supporters disagree

14:28.700 --> 14:30.540
with, and then suffer for that choice.

14:30.540 --> 14:34.020
Regardless of anything else he's done, I can respect him for sticking to his values

14:34.020 --> 14:36.020
even if they prove to be unpopular.

14:36.020 --> 14:38.180
Plus, the pro-Israel take is the correct one.

14:38.180 --> 14:38.780
Suck it nerds.
