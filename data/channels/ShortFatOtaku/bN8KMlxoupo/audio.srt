1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,120
I just realized something.

2
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:08,440
The Olympics are over, aren't they?

3
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:10,240
I don't even remember when they started.

4
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:13,760
I know they were in China, but I don't know who won the most medals, I don't know if there

5
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:18,500
were any big upsets or gaffes, they barely even register on my radar as a notable event

6
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:19,500
that recently happened.

7
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:23,580
The only thing I do recall is the Big Air Shojang meme, which was when this picture

8
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:25,600
went viral on social media.

9
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:29,320
China had constructed its artificial ski run in an industrial park, and the contrast between

10
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:34,200
the fake white slope and what looks like a brown and bloom post-apocalyptic fallout

11
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:37,640
hellscape in the background blew pretty much everybody away.

12
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:39,520
This is what the Olympics have been reduced to.

13
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:43,040
I remember, not long ago, people actually cared about these games.

14
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:47,520
Even people who didn't like sports too much, people like me for example, might feel a twinge

15
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,520
of national pride when their country claims another medal.

16
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:53,980
And not caring about the Olympics is a relatively new phenomenon, rather than being a product

17
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:56,680
of the cynicism of the 90s, like it usually is.

18
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:59,960
Even up to about a decade ago, I remember the Olympics as an event that had the power

19
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:03,960
to unite people under the banner of sportsmanship, goodwill, and fair play.

20
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:05,440
But now, nobody cares.

21
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:09,020
They are a rusted out husk of their former glory, which is what makes this picture so

22
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:10,020
appropriate.

23
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:13,080
There's no reason for me to go into any of the minor Olympic scandals because it just

24
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:14,080
doesn't matter.

25
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:17,760
The Olympics, now more than ever, are just another avenue where nations can make propaganda

26
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:19,740
moves to advance their interests.

27
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:22,940
During the games though, Twitter fed me this little piece of bullshit.

28
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:26,800
The western powers tried and failed to discredit the Beijing Winter Olympics.

29
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:30,660
In fact, the games were a runaway success, symbolizing peace, international friendship,

30
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:31,660
and solidarity.

31
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:35,520
They were also the greenest Olympics in history, that has to be fake, considering how much

32
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:38,980
fake snow they moved around, and a model of COVID management.

33
00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:43,180
Twitter, what gave you the thought that I would ever want to see something like this?

34
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:46,860
Truthfully, nobody wants to see this, but this tweet was nonetheless promoted to a lot

35
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:47,860
of people.

36
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:50,760
Not as a paid advertisement, which Twitter marks with a promoted tag, but under the much

37
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:53,100
more benign, you might like tag.

38
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:57,300
Of course, there's no reason that I, or anybody else, fed this nonsense would actually

39
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:58,300
like it.

40
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:01,940
We didn't click on Olympic tweets, or Chinese tweets, or controversy tweets.

41
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:05,580
Twitter thought we might like it because Twitter wants us to like it, it's as simple as that.

42
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:10,500
The trending tab on pretty much every single social media platform is absolutely useless.

43
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:15,080
Twitter is most of all, but that's not because it's all just astroturfed pre-purchased garbage.

44
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,520
That is part of it though, of course.

45
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:20,840
If a new movie or TV show comes out, especially if it's Disney or Capeshit, expect it to

46
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:24,460
be right at the top of the trending tab, whether or not it actually deserves it, complete with

47
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:26,500
a special hashtag emoji.

48
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:30,540
These things are emojis that Twitter automatically posts, attached to a given hashtag.

49
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:34,680
Generally, companies will buy hashtags with emojis for promotional purposes, in order

50
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:36,260
to make their product look special.

51
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:38,180
Whenever I see one of these, I just cringe.

52
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:41,660
It makes me think that somebody out there thought it was a good idea to drop a big bag

53
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:44,100
of cash so Twitter can look even more annoying.

54
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:45,780
Oh, and also, guess what?

55
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:49,400
The only hashtag emoji that is permanent is the Black Lives Matter one, and according

56
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:53,320
to Twitter's backend, it's not set to expire until the year 3000.

57
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:56,440
I guess it truly is a thousand-year Reich.

58
00:02:56,440 --> 00:03:01,040
What the trending tab should be is a list of the most common words currently being tweeted,

59
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:05,480
removing of course stuff like the, or a, or I, and sometimes we do actually get that.

60
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:10,320
The recent Destiny drama blew up primarily on Twitter, and so the word Destiny was trending

61
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:11,320
for several days.

62
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:15,160
Vosh trends on Twitter almost weekly at this point, because that's about how often he says

63
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:19,140
something so majorly dumb that it causes an internet kerfuffle.

64
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:23,660
And when there's real news, like the Ukraine-Russia war, that often dominates the trending tab

65
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:24,660
too.

66
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:28,220
But then you start to notice some weird stuff, like okay, right now, Ayato is trending because

67
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:29,780
of a Genshin Impact thing.

68
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:32,960
I don't know, I don't play the Chinese spyware game, you fucking degenerates.

69
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:37,300
But Ayato is trending with 151,000 tweets right now, and at the same time, Roger Stone

70
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:39,460
is trending with only 7,000 tweets.

71
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:43,100
Considering Twitter's size, is 7,000 tweets really trending?

72
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:46,160
Well, if you click on that trend, you'll see why it's being pushed.

73
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:48,460
It's a January 6th Capitol riot thing.

74
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:49,460
Of course.

75
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:54,340
Now I'm not quite saying that Twitter deliberately boosts topics to fit a political bias.

76
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:56,120
I think that's probably actually not the case.

77
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:59,240
Not because Twitter isn't biased, they clearly are, but because I don't think they have the

78
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:01,840
time to manually police every tweet on the platform.

79
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:04,160
If they did, they would have handed all the child porn by now.

80
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:08,240
My guess is, they're flagging certain accounts, maybe those with that verification mark, or

81
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:11,580
maybe not, as having more weight in the what trends algorithm.

82
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:16,160
So let's say 50,000 normies tweet about something, and that might cause a trend, while you only

83
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:19,900
need 5,000 trend-friendly accounts to do the same thing.

84
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:23,880
That seems to explain this behavior more than any kind of centralized push from Twitter.

85
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:27,080
But at the same time, if this is how it works, Twitter knows what they're doing when they're

86
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:28,480
giving certain accounts this power.

87
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:31,760
But that's the only reason I can think of as to why some of these trends are so low.

88
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:34,840
Ron Perlman with 7,000 tweets, did he even do anything recently?

89
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:36,320
Jon Stewart with 4,000.

90
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:40,160
Frankly, the only thing I've seen that old fossil appear on in the last year is adamant

91
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,280
such as Sunday Show.

92
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,620
And Streets of Rage is tweeting without even a number.

93
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:47,660
In fact, when I clicked on this for the video, the term Streets of Rage might have been used

94
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:52,260
100 times on Twitter in the past 12 hours, mostly in reference to the upcoming Streets

95
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:53,340
of Rage 4 game.

96
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:56,180
I don't believe this is an actual trend, it's probably one of those paid spots.

97
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:59,940
Also, just in case you're getting your hopes up, Streets of Rage 4 is a mobile game.

98
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:00,940
Sorry.

99
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:04,380
Yes, I have been deliberately avoiding the elephant in the room sitting on the edges

100
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:06,100
of all these screenshots.

101
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:07,460
It's the Will Smith thing.

102
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:10,220
Alright, just in case you haven't heard, check it out.

103
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:11,760
Jada, I love you.

104
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:13,760
G.I. Jane 2, can't wait to see it.

105
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:14,760
Alright?

106
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:23,480
That was a nice one, okay.

107
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:24,480
I'm out here.

108
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,480
Uh-oh.

109
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:26,480
Richard?

110
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,480
Oh, wow.

111
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,480
Wow.

112
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:37,480
Will Smith just smacked the shit out of me.

113
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:45,460
Wow, dude.

114
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:52,420
It was a G.I. Jane joke.

115
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:55,500
I'm going to, okay?

116
00:05:55,500 --> 00:06:00,400
Oh, okay.

117
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:04,980
That was the greatest night in the history of television.

118
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:05,980
Okay.

119
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:06,980
Okay.

120
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:10,160
I don't want to dwell too much on this because just like the Olympics, I don't actually care

121
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,160
about celeb shit.

122
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,160
I don't care about the Oscars.

123
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:15,080
I didn't even know the Oscars were happening until this event went viral.

124
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:18,280
I don't know anybody else who was following the Oscars either, at least until the How

125
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:19,460
Can He Slap event.

126
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:23,080
The prevailing narrative about it is that Chris Rock told a joke about Will Smith's

127
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:25,240
wife's baldness by referring to G.I.

128
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:26,240
Jane 2.

129
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:29,520
Then Will just Chad walked up, smacked him in the mouth, and then proceeded to yell at

130
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:30,520
him from his seat.

131
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:33,800
Everybody online right now is making this about ableism, about black-on-black violence,

132
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,240
about toxic masculinity.

133
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:37,720
Everybody is filtering this through their own political lens.

134
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:39,380
Everybody's reaching, and it's fucking cringe.

135
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:42,720
I know you retards think that everything is actually political, but it's not.

136
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,540
Stop trying to fit it all into a box.

137
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:49,000
This is 100% a personal situation, and everybody else is wrong about it.

138
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,020
Listen closely again and watch the body language of those involved.

139
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:53,780
Look, Chris Rock makes a bald joke.

140
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:55,840
Will's laughing it off, but Jada looks angry.

141
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,720
Chris sees that she's annoyed and says,

142
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:00,120
That was a nice one, okay.

143
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:03,960
He's clearly insinuating that the bald joke was him pulling punches, and if he wanted

144
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:07,480
to really piss her off, he'd joke about her cucking him, and the resulting shit show

145
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:11,360
around that, and in case you didn't know, that's a thing, too.

146
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:19,320
I think it was about four and a half, four years ago, started a friendship with August,

147
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:25,620
and we actually became really, really good friends, and it all started with him just

148
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:34,360
needing some help, me wanting to help his health, his mental state, and we found all

149
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:39,440
those different resources to help pull him through.

150
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:43,560
As time went on, I got into a different kind of entanglement.

151
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:47,200
I think you need to say clearly what happened.

152
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:51,100
I got into an entanglement with August.

153
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:52,100
That's what I said.

154
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:53,100
An entanglement?

155
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:54,100
Yes.

156
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:55,100
Yes.

157
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:56,100
Of relationship.

158
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:57,100
Yes.

159
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:58,100
It was a relationship.

160
00:07:58,100 --> 00:07:59,100
Absolutely.

161
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:04,320
Now, I gotta be with you at the press conference while you tell the world about your trip.

162
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:10,320
Well, I love my baby, I'm gonna stand by my baby no matter what.

163
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:16,720
No, I definitely understand why it would look that way or feel that way, but I actually

164
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:19,240
don't look at it as a transgression at all.

165
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:25,160
Through that particular journey, I learned so much about myself and was able to really

166
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:34,120
confront a lot of emotional immaturity, emotional insecurity, and I was really able to do some

167
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:36,240
really deep healing.

168
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:39,040
This is why I don't think the event was staged to get more eyes on the Oscars.

169
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:42,640
That's why I don't think it was about the bald thing or the ableism or whatever else.

170
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,080
It's simply a personal matter.

171
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:47,680
But because it's juicy drama, people keep digging up alternate angles or behind the

172
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:51,080
scenes footage or pointing out how hypocritical it is for Hollywood to think about coming

173
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:54,720
down on Will Smith when most of them take regular trips out to Epstein's Island.

174
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:57,400
Like I said, I'm not here to discuss this event specifically.

175
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:58,680
There's no analysis to be had.

176
00:08:58,680 --> 00:08:59,740
There's nothing to talk about.

177
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:29,640
It's simply what the boondocks described years ago.

178
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:34,140
I will say, though, it is damn funny to see that Chris Rock has the fear of God slapped

179
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:35,140
into him.

180
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:38,560
The point I'm making is this event was trending because it was an event that happened, but

181
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,200
not because it's substantive.

182
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,440
Of course it would be trending.

183
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,980
The Oscars are peak establishment.

184
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:46,700
It's the wealthy huffing their own farts and thinking that us plebs actually care to watch

185
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:47,700
them.

186
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:49,240
Any excuse to put them on that trending tab will do.

187
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:54,080
Even if nothing happened at the Oscars, even if it was the most boring show possible, it

188
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,080
would still be there.

189
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:59,140
The last time I cared about any of this was when Ricky Gervais hosted the Golden Globes

190
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:01,220
and told them all to their faces exactly what they were.

191
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:08,540
You know this famous Red Letter Media clip, right?

192
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:10,620
It's been way too overused at this point, as much as I love it.

193
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:13,420
But it applies not only to Marvel and Disney and Star Trek.

194
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:14,900
It applies not only to entertainment.

195
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:17,400
It applies to culture, to politics, to philosophy.

196
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:19,220
That's the point of the NPC meme.

197
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:23,300
That people are receiving their prescribed wisdom from their smartphones or computers

198
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:27,260
and that it's been pre-packaged in just such a way that they don't need to actually think

199
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:28,860
about what positions they're adopting.

200
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:33,260
It's a one-size-fits-all mentality, but for what you believe is true about the world.

201
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:37,460
A Markov Chain is a model of probability that describes a sequence of possible events in

202
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:41,920
which the chance each event happens depends solely on the state of the previous event

203
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:42,920
and no other factors.

204
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:43,920
Here's a great example.

205
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:48,540
A board game that relies solely on dice for moves, like for example Snakes and Ladders,

206
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:49,540
is a Markov Chain.

207
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:52,700
On each turn of Snakes and Ladders, the only thing that matters is the current state of

208
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:54,620
the board and your roll of the dice.

209
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:57,580
Your chances of getting a specific roll are the same every turn.

210
00:10:57,700 --> 00:11:00,720
Compare that to a card game where cards are continuously discarded from the deck, like

211
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:01,720
in Blackjack.

212
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:04,940
In a game like this, as you play through the deck, options within the deck are removed

213
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:08,380
from play, changing the chances that you will get a specific card each turn.

214
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:12,260
In this example, Snakes and Ladders is a Markov Chain, but Blackjack isn't, because previous

215
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:15,640
turns do not affect the probability of the dice roll in Snakes and Ladders, but previous

216
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:19,260
draws do affect the probability of the next draw in Blackjack.

217
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:22,940
Have you ever noticed that when you're talking to somebody who is entirely ideological, the

218
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:24,780
responses coming out of their mouth?

219
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:28,340
Everything that they say, every answer that they give you, is identical to every other

220
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:30,100
person who believes the same thing?

221
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:33,480
This is because their thought patterns move like a Markov Chain.

222
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:38,300
They always give the same output, regardless of reality, because it is being filtered down

223
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:39,720
through the same lens.

224
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:44,040
For example, Jordan Peterson famously demonstrated this effect when being interviewed by a feminist

225
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:45,040
a few years ago.

226
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,040
I'm married.

227
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:47,460
Modern marriage has a lot to recommend it.

228
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:49,580
I do also think it is a patron institution.

229
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:50,580
It is literally...

230
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:52,700
Of course you think that!

231
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:56,700
Because you think virtually everything that occurs in our society is a patriarchal institution.

232
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:59,360
It's easy to think that, because then you only have to think one thing.

233
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:00,360
You could let...

234
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:01,580
If a one thing answer for everything.

235
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:02,580
You could let me...

236
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:04,240
It's part of the patriarchal institution.

237
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:09,380
You know, part of the problem too is, with this sort of discussion, is that it's, and

238
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:16,820
this is why I consider it a manifestation of ideological possession, it's predictable.

239
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:17,820
Well that's what...

240
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:18,820
You know, knowing your stance on...

241
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:22,420
But having a coherent ideology does mean that it is predictable because...

242
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:23,420
You don't need an ideology.

243
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:26,820
It is one logical thing that flows from another, and all those pieces tessellate together.

244
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:29,980
That's what I find very interesting about your thinking, I find it quite slightly baffling,

245
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:32,660
is that I don't really see how all the pieces fit together.

246
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:39,860
And you know, the idea that something should be consistent, you were talking about the

247
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:45,740
necessity for consistency in ideology, it's like, I'm not hearing what you think.

248
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:51,660
I'm hearing how you're able to represent the ideology you were taught.

249
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:54,660
And it's not that interesting, because I don't know anything about you.

250
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:58,460
I could replace you with someone else who thinks the same way, and that means you're

251
00:12:58,460 --> 00:12:59,800
not here.

252
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:01,060
That's what it means.

253
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:03,600
It's not pleasant.

254
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:06,380
So you're not drawing...

255
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:11,100
You're not integrating the specifics of your personal experience with what you've been

256
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:16,580
taught to synthesise something that's genuine and surprising, and engaging in a narrative

257
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:18,180
sense as a consequence.

258
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:21,100
And that's the pathology of ideological possession.

259
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:22,940
It's not good.

260
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:28,300
And it's not good that I know where you stand on things, once I know a few things.

261
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:29,300
Why have a conversation?

262
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:30,940
I already know where you stand on things.

263
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:32,980
I bet you don't know where I stand on all things.

264
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:35,620
I would hope that that was true.

265
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:39,140
Okay, let's talk about transgender issues.

266
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:44,820
What do you think I think about transgender issues?

267
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:54,040
I suspect that you think that gender expression, gender identity, are fundamentally social

268
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:56,260
constructs, but I could be wrong.

269
00:13:56,260 --> 00:14:00,900
No, I believe that there are definitely some biological differences between the sexes.

270
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:01,900
We've observed them.

271
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:06,100
I do believe that gender is a hugely powerful social structure that we've built on top of

272
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:10,260
that, that it is largely but not entirely socially constructed.

273
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:12,620
Notice how he predicted exactly what she would say?

274
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:16,020
She then said, no, I'm not going to say that, and then admitted that everything he said

275
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:17,740
was actually correct about her?

276
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:21,860
Once you understand what lens they are filtering everything through, you can completely predict

277
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:22,860
what they're going to say.

278
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:25,260
You don't even need to ask them the question anymore.

279
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:28,740
Simply run the input through the lens, and you will get the same answer every time.

280
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:30,540
Of course, rightoids do this too.

281
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:34,460
Libertarians and Ancaps and conservatives all have their own Markov chain thoughts.

282
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:38,140
It's not a product of any one ideology, rather it's a product of ideological thinking.

283
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:41,700
A libertarian will always ask their internal processes some key questions.

284
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:43,100
How is the state at fault?

285
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:44,980
How did regulation cause this problem?

286
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:48,420
And then spit out an ideological answer, which may or may not be accurate to reality.

287
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:49,880
A socialist will do the same thing.

288
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:51,360
How does this relate to class conflict?

289
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,220
How are the means of production affected?

290
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:56,700
Talk to enough ideologues, and you'll find that once you've picked up their source code,

291
00:14:56,700 --> 00:15:00,540
you can run any variable through it that you want, and generate the exact same answers

292
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:02,140
that they would give you in a conversation.

293
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:05,380
I made a video a while ago, I think it was an E3 video, I can't remember which year,

294
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:09,460
where I made the point that we build institutions in order to capture and properly express virtues

295
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:10,460
in society.

296
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:12,180
For example, school is a place of higher learning.

297
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:14,180
The Olympics are to display the best of human athleticism.

298
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:15,420
The Oscars, for example, are reacting.

299
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:18,900
But the point I made in that video is that the world is not a fixed place, and that the

300
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:21,340
location of these virtues may shift over time.

301
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:25,660
You can make a decent argument, though not as solid as most rightoids believe, that academia

302
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:26,660
has become corrupted.

303
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:30,000
That doesn't mean that the virtue of learning is gone from the world, but that the virtue

304
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:34,040
of learning must be found in a place outside of that old institution sometimes.

305
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:37,400
An old institution may have had a purpose, but if the location of the virtue shifts,

306
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:41,800
then that institution will also change into a self-perpetuating bureaucracy that only

307
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:45,920
exists on the back of its previous reputation, and that will eventually run out of steam.

308
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:47,480
That's why all this stuff feels hollow.

309
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:51,360
The Olympics, the Oscars, the trending tab that they're in that pushes heaps of worthless

310
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:55,660
nothingness in front of your eyes, every show or movie or video game claiming to have broken

311
00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:59,520
new ground, every event demanding not only your attention, but your public expression

312
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:00,520
of care.

313
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:03,920
Every notable individual who comes out of the closet as a member of this week's Prague

314
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:07,760
protected class, all of it feels like it demands your brain space, and that there's something

315
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:10,200
wrong with you if you don't give it up willingly and publicly.

316
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:12,720
There's something damaged about you if you don't play the game.

317
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:16,400
You are required not only to care, but to emote to others that you do.

318
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:21,200
And yes, although I do think that all sides of politics can do this, right now, it's

319
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:24,020
the left that is co-opting this tendency for their own ends.

320
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:27,400
After all, everything is political, everything is a matter of the public, everything is a

321
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:31,720
virtue signal, every moment is an opportunity to show to wider society that you are on the

322
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:35,360
right side of history, it feels like an entire generation of people have inherited something

323
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:38,720
potentially great, something that they have no idea what to do with or how to continue

324
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:41,960
building on it, and so they've resorted to cannibalizing it in order to further their

325
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:42,960
own ends.

326
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:46,760
Grand plans always come with an obsession with wiping clean the old and reordering things

327
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:50,680
according to a rationalism that those in power fervently believe is objective, even though

328
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:51,680
it's not.

329
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:54,680
And it's not just the culture that gets reordered, but the minds of the people who

330
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:55,680
live within it.

331
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:59,800
I was surprised that when this guy said on reddit a few years back he was tired of being

332
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:03,920
told that he had to care about everything, the replies he got were decrying him for his

333
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:07,240
privilege and saying that he is part of the problem for even feeling fatigued.

334
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:10,520
But you know what, fine, I'll be part of the problem.

335
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:11,520
I don't care.

336
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:14,520
I don't care about any of this, and I'm tired of pretending that I do, or rather

337
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:16,020
I was tired of pretending.

338
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:19,420
I've been open about not caring for years now, why do you think that the terminally

339
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:21,280
invested call me a nazi?

340
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:25,360
Because if everything is political, and if their grand plan requires everyone to be involved,

341
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:30,200
otherwise it's not real socialism, simply saying no means that you are fundamentally

342
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:32,400
on the wrong side of history.

343
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:36,680
Even if that no means that you just want to shut out the noise and the god-awful cancer

344
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:39,660
of the outside world for just a minute, even if it means that you just want to log the

345
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:40,720
fuck off for a while.

346
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:45,080
But like that reddit post shows, the who cares mentality is spreading, and frankly, that's

347
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:46,320
a trend I can get behind.

348
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:50,360
In meditations, Marcus Aurelius wrote about this and a billion other things like 2,000

349
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:51,360
years ago,

350
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:53,400
You always own the option of having no opinion.

351
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:57,160
There is never any need to get worked up or to trouble your soul about things you can't

352
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:58,160
control.

353
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:01,200
These things are not asking to be judged by you, leave them alone.

354
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:06,200
It is tyrants and totalitarians that say everything is political, that want to force you to care,

355
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:10,560
that exclaim that you are not properly buying into society, and therefore are a reactionary

356
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:12,880
if you're not always on and always emoting.

357
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:16,940
To them, everything is political because they view your brain as political, and they want

358
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:20,120
to conquer it like they want to conquer every other domain of politics.

359
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:23,000
I'm not saying don't care about anything like an edgelord.

360
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,920
I'm saying reserve your care for things that you genuinely care about.

361
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:28,200
Quit the performative garbage.

362
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:31,640
You don't have to agree with me politically, in fact, it probably works better if you don't,

363
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:34,800
because I'm not asking you to regurgitate what I say, like you're going down a Markov

364
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:35,800
chain.

365
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:39,120
I'm saying your conscience knows what to focus on, and that's going to be unique to each

366
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:40,600
person, so focus on it.

367
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:42,100
Forget about all this other junk.

368
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:43,720
Do what actually matters.
