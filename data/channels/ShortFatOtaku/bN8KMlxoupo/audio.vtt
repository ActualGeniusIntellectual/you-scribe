WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:07.120
I just realized something.

00:07.120 --> 00:08.440
The Olympics are over, aren't they?

00:08.440 --> 00:10.240
I don't even remember when they started.

00:10.240 --> 00:13.760
I know they were in China, but I don't know who won the most medals, I don't know if there

00:13.760 --> 00:18.500
were any big upsets or gaffes, they barely even register on my radar as a notable event

00:18.500 --> 00:19.500
that recently happened.

00:19.500 --> 00:23.580
The only thing I do recall is the Big Air Shojang meme, which was when this picture

00:23.580 --> 00:25.600
went viral on social media.

00:25.600 --> 00:29.320
China had constructed its artificial ski run in an industrial park, and the contrast between

00:29.320 --> 00:34.200
the fake white slope and what looks like a brown and bloom post-apocalyptic fallout

00:34.200 --> 00:37.640
hellscape in the background blew pretty much everybody away.

00:37.640 --> 00:39.520
This is what the Olympics have been reduced to.

00:39.520 --> 00:43.040
I remember, not long ago, people actually cared about these games.

00:43.040 --> 00:47.520
Even people who didn't like sports too much, people like me for example, might feel a twinge

00:47.520 --> 00:50.520
of national pride when their country claims another medal.

00:50.520 --> 00:53.980
And not caring about the Olympics is a relatively new phenomenon, rather than being a product

00:53.980 --> 00:56.680
of the cynicism of the 90s, like it usually is.

00:56.680 --> 00:59.960
Even up to about a decade ago, I remember the Olympics as an event that had the power

00:59.960 --> 01:03.960
to unite people under the banner of sportsmanship, goodwill, and fair play.

01:03.960 --> 01:05.440
But now, nobody cares.

01:05.440 --> 01:09.020
They are a rusted out husk of their former glory, which is what makes this picture so

01:09.020 --> 01:10.020
appropriate.

01:10.020 --> 01:13.080
There's no reason for me to go into any of the minor Olympic scandals because it just

01:13.080 --> 01:14.080
doesn't matter.

01:14.080 --> 01:17.760
The Olympics, now more than ever, are just another avenue where nations can make propaganda

01:17.760 --> 01:19.740
moves to advance their interests.

01:19.740 --> 01:22.940
During the games though, Twitter fed me this little piece of bullshit.

01:22.940 --> 01:26.800
The western powers tried and failed to discredit the Beijing Winter Olympics.

01:26.800 --> 01:30.660
In fact, the games were a runaway success, symbolizing peace, international friendship,

01:30.660 --> 01:31.660
and solidarity.

01:31.660 --> 01:35.520
They were also the greenest Olympics in history, that has to be fake, considering how much

01:35.520 --> 01:38.980
fake snow they moved around, and a model of COVID management.

01:38.980 --> 01:43.180
Twitter, what gave you the thought that I would ever want to see something like this?

01:43.180 --> 01:46.860
Truthfully, nobody wants to see this, but this tweet was nonetheless promoted to a lot

01:46.860 --> 01:47.860
of people.

01:47.860 --> 01:50.760
Not as a paid advertisement, which Twitter marks with a promoted tag, but under the much

01:50.760 --> 01:53.100
more benign, you might like tag.

01:53.100 --> 01:57.300
Of course, there's no reason that I, or anybody else, fed this nonsense would actually

01:57.300 --> 01:58.300
like it.

01:58.300 --> 02:01.940
We didn't click on Olympic tweets, or Chinese tweets, or controversy tweets.

02:01.940 --> 02:05.580
Twitter thought we might like it because Twitter wants us to like it, it's as simple as that.

02:05.580 --> 02:10.500
The trending tab on pretty much every single social media platform is absolutely useless.

02:10.500 --> 02:15.080
Twitter is most of all, but that's not because it's all just astroturfed pre-purchased garbage.

02:15.080 --> 02:16.520
That is part of it though, of course.

02:16.520 --> 02:20.840
If a new movie or TV show comes out, especially if it's Disney or Capeshit, expect it to

02:20.840 --> 02:24.460
be right at the top of the trending tab, whether or not it actually deserves it, complete with

02:24.460 --> 02:26.500
a special hashtag emoji.

02:26.500 --> 02:30.540
These things are emojis that Twitter automatically posts, attached to a given hashtag.

02:30.540 --> 02:34.680
Generally, companies will buy hashtags with emojis for promotional purposes, in order

02:34.680 --> 02:36.260
to make their product look special.

02:36.260 --> 02:38.180
Whenever I see one of these, I just cringe.

02:38.180 --> 02:41.660
It makes me think that somebody out there thought it was a good idea to drop a big bag

02:41.660 --> 02:44.100
of cash so Twitter can look even more annoying.

02:44.100 --> 02:45.780
Oh, and also, guess what?

02:45.780 --> 02:49.400
The only hashtag emoji that is permanent is the Black Lives Matter one, and according

02:49.400 --> 02:53.320
to Twitter's backend, it's not set to expire until the year 3000.

02:53.320 --> 02:56.440
I guess it truly is a thousand-year Reich.

02:56.440 --> 03:01.040
What the trending tab should be is a list of the most common words currently being tweeted,

03:01.040 --> 03:05.480
removing of course stuff like the, or a, or I, and sometimes we do actually get that.

03:05.480 --> 03:10.320
The recent Destiny drama blew up primarily on Twitter, and so the word Destiny was trending

03:10.320 --> 03:11.320
for several days.

03:11.320 --> 03:15.160
Vosh trends on Twitter almost weekly at this point, because that's about how often he says

03:15.160 --> 03:19.140
something so majorly dumb that it causes an internet kerfuffle.

03:19.140 --> 03:23.660
And when there's real news, like the Ukraine-Russia war, that often dominates the trending tab

03:23.660 --> 03:24.660
too.

03:24.660 --> 03:28.220
But then you start to notice some weird stuff, like okay, right now, Ayato is trending because

03:28.220 --> 03:29.780
of a Genshin Impact thing.

03:29.780 --> 03:32.960
I don't know, I don't play the Chinese spyware game, you fucking degenerates.

03:32.960 --> 03:37.300
But Ayato is trending with 151,000 tweets right now, and at the same time, Roger Stone

03:37.300 --> 03:39.460
is trending with only 7,000 tweets.

03:39.460 --> 03:43.100
Considering Twitter's size, is 7,000 tweets really trending?

03:43.100 --> 03:46.160
Well, if you click on that trend, you'll see why it's being pushed.

03:46.160 --> 03:48.460
It's a January 6th Capitol riot thing.

03:48.460 --> 03:49.460
Of course.

03:49.460 --> 03:54.340
Now I'm not quite saying that Twitter deliberately boosts topics to fit a political bias.

03:54.340 --> 03:56.120
I think that's probably actually not the case.

03:56.120 --> 03:59.240
Not because Twitter isn't biased, they clearly are, but because I don't think they have the

03:59.240 --> 04:01.840
time to manually police every tweet on the platform.

04:01.840 --> 04:04.160
If they did, they would have handed all the child porn by now.

04:04.160 --> 04:08.240
My guess is, they're flagging certain accounts, maybe those with that verification mark, or

04:08.240 --> 04:11.580
maybe not, as having more weight in the what trends algorithm.

04:11.580 --> 04:16.160
So let's say 50,000 normies tweet about something, and that might cause a trend, while you only

04:16.160 --> 04:19.900
need 5,000 trend-friendly accounts to do the same thing.

04:19.900 --> 04:23.880
That seems to explain this behavior more than any kind of centralized push from Twitter.

04:23.880 --> 04:27.080
But at the same time, if this is how it works, Twitter knows what they're doing when they're

04:27.080 --> 04:28.480
giving certain accounts this power.

04:28.480 --> 04:31.760
But that's the only reason I can think of as to why some of these trends are so low.

04:31.760 --> 04:34.840
Ron Perlman with 7,000 tweets, did he even do anything recently?

04:34.840 --> 04:36.320
Jon Stewart with 4,000.

04:36.320 --> 04:40.160
Frankly, the only thing I've seen that old fossil appear on in the last year is adamant

04:40.160 --> 04:41.280
such as Sunday Show.

04:41.280 --> 04:43.620
And Streets of Rage is tweeting without even a number.

04:43.620 --> 04:47.660
In fact, when I clicked on this for the video, the term Streets of Rage might have been used

04:47.660 --> 04:52.260
100 times on Twitter in the past 12 hours, mostly in reference to the upcoming Streets

04:52.260 --> 04:53.340
of Rage 4 game.

04:53.340 --> 04:56.180
I don't believe this is an actual trend, it's probably one of those paid spots.

04:56.180 --> 04:59.940
Also, just in case you're getting your hopes up, Streets of Rage 4 is a mobile game.

04:59.940 --> 05:00.940
Sorry.

05:00.940 --> 05:04.380
Yes, I have been deliberately avoiding the elephant in the room sitting on the edges

05:04.380 --> 05:06.100
of all these screenshots.

05:06.100 --> 05:07.460
It's the Will Smith thing.

05:07.460 --> 05:10.220
Alright, just in case you haven't heard, check it out.

05:10.280 --> 05:11.760
Jada, I love you.

05:11.760 --> 05:13.760
G.I. Jane 2, can't wait to see it.

05:13.760 --> 05:14.760
Alright?

05:14.760 --> 05:23.480
That was a nice one, okay.

05:23.480 --> 05:24.480
I'm out here.

05:24.480 --> 05:25.480
Uh-oh.

05:25.480 --> 05:26.480
Richard?

05:26.480 --> 05:27.480
Oh, wow.

05:27.480 --> 05:28.480
Wow.

05:28.480 --> 05:37.480
Will Smith just smacked the shit out of me.

05:37.480 --> 05:45.460
Wow, dude.

05:45.460 --> 05:52.420
It was a G.I. Jane joke.

05:52.420 --> 05:55.500
I'm going to, okay?

05:55.500 --> 06:00.400
Oh, okay.

06:00.400 --> 06:04.980
That was the greatest night in the history of television.

06:04.980 --> 06:05.980
Okay.

06:05.980 --> 06:06.980
Okay.

06:07.480 --> 06:10.160
I don't want to dwell too much on this because just like the Olympics, I don't actually care

06:10.160 --> 06:11.160
about celeb shit.

06:11.160 --> 06:12.160
I don't care about the Oscars.

06:12.160 --> 06:15.080
I didn't even know the Oscars were happening until this event went viral.

06:15.080 --> 06:18.280
I don't know anybody else who was following the Oscars either, at least until the How

06:18.280 --> 06:19.460
Can He Slap event.

06:19.460 --> 06:23.080
The prevailing narrative about it is that Chris Rock told a joke about Will Smith's

06:23.080 --> 06:25.240
wife's baldness by referring to G.I.

06:25.240 --> 06:26.240
Jane 2.

06:26.240 --> 06:29.520
Then Will just Chad walked up, smacked him in the mouth, and then proceeded to yell at

06:29.520 --> 06:30.520
him from his seat.

06:30.520 --> 06:33.800
Everybody online right now is making this about ableism, about black-on-black violence,

06:33.800 --> 06:35.240
about toxic masculinity.

06:35.240 --> 06:37.720
Everybody is filtering this through their own political lens.

06:37.720 --> 06:39.380
Everybody's reaching, and it's fucking cringe.

06:39.380 --> 06:42.720
I know you retards think that everything is actually political, but it's not.

06:42.720 --> 06:44.540
Stop trying to fit it all into a box.

06:44.540 --> 06:49.000
This is 100% a personal situation, and everybody else is wrong about it.

06:49.000 --> 06:52.020
Listen closely again and watch the body language of those involved.

06:52.020 --> 06:53.780
Look, Chris Rock makes a bald joke.

06:53.780 --> 06:55.840
Will's laughing it off, but Jada looks angry.

06:55.840 --> 06:57.720
Chris sees that she's annoyed and says,

06:57.720 --> 07:00.120
That was a nice one, okay.

07:00.120 --> 07:03.960
He's clearly insinuating that the bald joke was him pulling punches, and if he wanted

07:03.960 --> 07:07.480
to really piss her off, he'd joke about her cucking him, and the resulting shit show

07:07.480 --> 07:11.360
around that, and in case you didn't know, that's a thing, too.

07:11.360 --> 07:19.320
I think it was about four and a half, four years ago, started a friendship with August,

07:19.320 --> 07:25.620
and we actually became really, really good friends, and it all started with him just

07:25.620 --> 07:34.360
needing some help, me wanting to help his health, his mental state, and we found all

07:34.360 --> 07:39.440
those different resources to help pull him through.

07:39.440 --> 07:43.560
As time went on, I got into a different kind of entanglement.

07:43.560 --> 07:47.200
I think you need to say clearly what happened.

07:47.200 --> 07:51.100
I got into an entanglement with August.

07:51.100 --> 07:52.100
That's what I said.

07:52.100 --> 07:53.100
An entanglement?

07:53.100 --> 07:54.100
Yes.

07:54.100 --> 07:55.100
Yes.

07:55.100 --> 07:56.100
Of relationship.

07:56.100 --> 07:57.100
Yes.

07:57.100 --> 07:58.100
It was a relationship.

07:58.100 --> 07:59.100
Absolutely.

07:59.100 --> 08:04.320
Now, I gotta be with you at the press conference while you tell the world about your trip.

08:04.320 --> 08:10.320
Well, I love my baby, I'm gonna stand by my baby no matter what.

08:10.320 --> 08:16.720
No, I definitely understand why it would look that way or feel that way, but I actually

08:16.720 --> 08:19.240
don't look at it as a transgression at all.

08:19.240 --> 08:25.160
Through that particular journey, I learned so much about myself and was able to really

08:25.160 --> 08:34.120
confront a lot of emotional immaturity, emotional insecurity, and I was really able to do some

08:34.120 --> 08:36.240
really deep healing.

08:36.240 --> 08:39.040
This is why I don't think the event was staged to get more eyes on the Oscars.

08:39.040 --> 08:42.640
That's why I don't think it was about the bald thing or the ableism or whatever else.

08:42.640 --> 08:44.080
It's simply a personal matter.

08:44.080 --> 08:47.680
But because it's juicy drama, people keep digging up alternate angles or behind the

08:47.680 --> 08:51.080
scenes footage or pointing out how hypocritical it is for Hollywood to think about coming

08:51.080 --> 08:54.720
down on Will Smith when most of them take regular trips out to Epstein's Island.

08:54.720 --> 08:57.400
Like I said, I'm not here to discuss this event specifically.

08:57.400 --> 08:58.680
There's no analysis to be had.

08:58.680 --> 08:59.740
There's nothing to talk about.

08:59.740 --> 09:29.640
It's simply what the boondocks described years ago.

09:29.640 --> 09:34.140
I will say, though, it is damn funny to see that Chris Rock has the fear of God slapped

09:34.140 --> 09:35.140
into him.

09:35.140 --> 09:38.560
The point I'm making is this event was trending because it was an event that happened, but

09:38.560 --> 09:40.200
not because it's substantive.

09:40.200 --> 09:41.440
Of course it would be trending.

09:41.440 --> 09:42.980
The Oscars are peak establishment.

09:42.980 --> 09:46.700
It's the wealthy huffing their own farts and thinking that us plebs actually care to watch

09:46.700 --> 09:47.700
them.

09:47.700 --> 09:49.240
Any excuse to put them on that trending tab will do.

09:49.240 --> 09:54.080
Even if nothing happened at the Oscars, even if it was the most boring show possible, it

09:54.080 --> 09:55.080
would still be there.

09:55.080 --> 09:59.140
The last time I cared about any of this was when Ricky Gervais hosted the Golden Globes

09:59.140 --> 10:01.220
and told them all to their faces exactly what they were.

10:01.220 --> 10:08.540
You know this famous Red Letter Media clip, right?

10:08.540 --> 10:10.620
It's been way too overused at this point, as much as I love it.

10:10.620 --> 10:13.420
But it applies not only to Marvel and Disney and Star Trek.

10:13.420 --> 10:14.900
It applies not only to entertainment.

10:14.900 --> 10:17.400
It applies to culture, to politics, to philosophy.

10:17.400 --> 10:19.220
That's the point of the NPC meme.

10:19.220 --> 10:23.300
That people are receiving their prescribed wisdom from their smartphones or computers

10:23.300 --> 10:27.260
and that it's been pre-packaged in just such a way that they don't need to actually think

10:27.260 --> 10:28.860
about what positions they're adopting.

10:28.860 --> 10:33.260
It's a one-size-fits-all mentality, but for what you believe is true about the world.

10:33.260 --> 10:37.460
A Markov Chain is a model of probability that describes a sequence of possible events in

10:37.460 --> 10:41.920
which the chance each event happens depends solely on the state of the previous event

10:41.920 --> 10:42.920
and no other factors.

10:42.920 --> 10:43.920
Here's a great example.

10:43.920 --> 10:48.540
A board game that relies solely on dice for moves, like for example Snakes and Ladders,

10:48.540 --> 10:49.540
is a Markov Chain.

10:49.540 --> 10:52.700
On each turn of Snakes and Ladders, the only thing that matters is the current state of

10:52.700 --> 10:54.620
the board and your roll of the dice.

10:54.620 --> 10:57.580
Your chances of getting a specific roll are the same every turn.

10:57.700 --> 11:00.720
Compare that to a card game where cards are continuously discarded from the deck, like

11:00.720 --> 11:01.720
in Blackjack.

11:01.720 --> 11:04.940
In a game like this, as you play through the deck, options within the deck are removed

11:04.940 --> 11:08.380
from play, changing the chances that you will get a specific card each turn.

11:08.380 --> 11:12.260
In this example, Snakes and Ladders is a Markov Chain, but Blackjack isn't, because previous

11:12.260 --> 11:15.640
turns do not affect the probability of the dice roll in Snakes and Ladders, but previous

11:15.640 --> 11:19.260
draws do affect the probability of the next draw in Blackjack.

11:19.260 --> 11:22.940
Have you ever noticed that when you're talking to somebody who is entirely ideological, the

11:22.940 --> 11:24.780
responses coming out of their mouth?

11:24.780 --> 11:28.340
Everything that they say, every answer that they give you, is identical to every other

11:28.340 --> 11:30.100
person who believes the same thing?

11:30.100 --> 11:33.480
This is because their thought patterns move like a Markov Chain.

11:33.480 --> 11:38.300
They always give the same output, regardless of reality, because it is being filtered down

11:38.300 --> 11:39.720
through the same lens.

11:39.720 --> 11:44.040
For example, Jordan Peterson famously demonstrated this effect when being interviewed by a feminist

11:44.040 --> 11:45.040
a few years ago.

11:45.040 --> 11:46.040
I'm married.

11:46.040 --> 11:47.460
Modern marriage has a lot to recommend it.

11:47.460 --> 11:49.580
I do also think it is a patron institution.

11:49.580 --> 11:50.580
It is literally...

11:50.580 --> 11:52.700
Of course you think that!

11:52.700 --> 11:56.700
Because you think virtually everything that occurs in our society is a patriarchal institution.

11:56.700 --> 11:59.360
It's easy to think that, because then you only have to think one thing.

11:59.360 --> 12:00.360
You could let...

12:00.360 --> 12:01.580
If a one thing answer for everything.

12:01.580 --> 12:02.580
You could let me...

12:02.580 --> 12:04.240
It's part of the patriarchal institution.

12:04.240 --> 12:09.380
You know, part of the problem too is, with this sort of discussion, is that it's, and

12:09.380 --> 12:16.820
this is why I consider it a manifestation of ideological possession, it's predictable.

12:16.820 --> 12:17.820
Well that's what...

12:17.820 --> 12:18.820
You know, knowing your stance on...

12:18.820 --> 12:22.420
But having a coherent ideology does mean that it is predictable because...

12:22.420 --> 12:23.420
You don't need an ideology.

12:23.420 --> 12:26.820
It is one logical thing that flows from another, and all those pieces tessellate together.

12:26.820 --> 12:29.980
That's what I find very interesting about your thinking, I find it quite slightly baffling,

12:29.980 --> 12:32.660
is that I don't really see how all the pieces fit together.

12:32.660 --> 12:39.860
And you know, the idea that something should be consistent, you were talking about the

12:39.860 --> 12:45.740
necessity for consistency in ideology, it's like, I'm not hearing what you think.

12:45.740 --> 12:51.660
I'm hearing how you're able to represent the ideology you were taught.

12:51.660 --> 12:54.660
And it's not that interesting, because I don't know anything about you.

12:54.660 --> 12:58.460
I could replace you with someone else who thinks the same way, and that means you're

12:58.460 --> 12:59.800
not here.

12:59.800 --> 13:01.060
That's what it means.

13:01.060 --> 13:03.600
It's not pleasant.

13:03.600 --> 13:06.380
So you're not drawing...

13:06.380 --> 13:11.100
You're not integrating the specifics of your personal experience with what you've been

13:11.100 --> 13:16.580
taught to synthesise something that's genuine and surprising, and engaging in a narrative

13:16.580 --> 13:18.180
sense as a consequence.

13:18.180 --> 13:21.100
And that's the pathology of ideological possession.

13:21.100 --> 13:22.940
It's not good.

13:22.940 --> 13:28.300
And it's not good that I know where you stand on things, once I know a few things.

13:28.300 --> 13:29.300
Why have a conversation?

13:29.300 --> 13:30.940
I already know where you stand on things.

13:30.940 --> 13:32.980
I bet you don't know where I stand on all things.

13:32.980 --> 13:35.620
I would hope that that was true.

13:35.620 --> 13:39.140
Okay, let's talk about transgender issues.

13:39.620 --> 13:44.820
What do you think I think about transgender issues?

13:44.820 --> 13:54.040
I suspect that you think that gender expression, gender identity, are fundamentally social

13:54.040 --> 13:56.260
constructs, but I could be wrong.

13:56.260 --> 14:00.900
No, I believe that there are definitely some biological differences between the sexes.

14:00.900 --> 14:01.900
We've observed them.

14:01.900 --> 14:06.100
I do believe that gender is a hugely powerful social structure that we've built on top of

14:06.100 --> 14:10.260
that, that it is largely but not entirely socially constructed.

14:10.260 --> 14:12.620
Notice how he predicted exactly what she would say?

14:12.620 --> 14:16.020
She then said, no, I'm not going to say that, and then admitted that everything he said

14:16.020 --> 14:17.740
was actually correct about her?

14:17.740 --> 14:21.860
Once you understand what lens they are filtering everything through, you can completely predict

14:21.860 --> 14:22.860
what they're going to say.

14:22.860 --> 14:25.260
You don't even need to ask them the question anymore.

14:25.260 --> 14:28.740
Simply run the input through the lens, and you will get the same answer every time.

14:28.740 --> 14:30.540
Of course, rightoids do this too.

14:30.540 --> 14:34.460
Libertarians and Ancaps and conservatives all have their own Markov chain thoughts.

14:34.460 --> 14:38.140
It's not a product of any one ideology, rather it's a product of ideological thinking.

14:38.140 --> 14:41.700
A libertarian will always ask their internal processes some key questions.

14:41.700 --> 14:43.100
How is the state at fault?

14:43.100 --> 14:44.980
How did regulation cause this problem?

14:44.980 --> 14:48.420
And then spit out an ideological answer, which may or may not be accurate to reality.

14:48.420 --> 14:49.880
A socialist will do the same thing.

14:49.880 --> 14:51.360
How does this relate to class conflict?

14:51.360 --> 14:53.220
How are the means of production affected?

14:53.220 --> 14:56.700
Talk to enough ideologues, and you'll find that once you've picked up their source code,

14:56.700 --> 15:00.540
you can run any variable through it that you want, and generate the exact same answers

15:00.540 --> 15:02.140
that they would give you in a conversation.

15:02.140 --> 15:05.380
I made a video a while ago, I think it was an E3 video, I can't remember which year,

15:05.380 --> 15:09.460
where I made the point that we build institutions in order to capture and properly express virtues

15:09.460 --> 15:10.460
in society.

15:10.460 --> 15:12.180
For example, school is a place of higher learning.

15:12.180 --> 15:14.180
The Olympics are to display the best of human athleticism.

15:14.180 --> 15:15.420
The Oscars, for example, are reacting.

15:15.420 --> 15:18.900
But the point I made in that video is that the world is not a fixed place, and that the

15:18.900 --> 15:21.340
location of these virtues may shift over time.

15:21.340 --> 15:25.660
You can make a decent argument, though not as solid as most rightoids believe, that academia

15:25.660 --> 15:26.660
has become corrupted.

15:26.660 --> 15:30.000
That doesn't mean that the virtue of learning is gone from the world, but that the virtue

15:30.000 --> 15:34.040
of learning must be found in a place outside of that old institution sometimes.

15:34.040 --> 15:37.400
An old institution may have had a purpose, but if the location of the virtue shifts,

15:37.400 --> 15:41.800
then that institution will also change into a self-perpetuating bureaucracy that only

15:41.800 --> 15:45.920
exists on the back of its previous reputation, and that will eventually run out of steam.

15:45.920 --> 15:47.480
That's why all this stuff feels hollow.

15:47.480 --> 15:51.360
The Olympics, the Oscars, the trending tab that they're in that pushes heaps of worthless

15:51.360 --> 15:55.660
nothingness in front of your eyes, every show or movie or video game claiming to have broken

15:55.660 --> 15:59.520
new ground, every event demanding not only your attention, but your public expression

15:59.520 --> 16:00.520
of care.

16:00.520 --> 16:03.920
Every notable individual who comes out of the closet as a member of this week's Prague

16:03.920 --> 16:07.760
protected class, all of it feels like it demands your brain space, and that there's something

16:07.760 --> 16:10.200
wrong with you if you don't give it up willingly and publicly.

16:10.200 --> 16:12.720
There's something damaged about you if you don't play the game.

16:12.720 --> 16:16.400
You are required not only to care, but to emote to others that you do.

16:16.400 --> 16:21.200
And yes, although I do think that all sides of politics can do this, right now, it's

16:21.200 --> 16:24.020
the left that is co-opting this tendency for their own ends.

16:24.020 --> 16:27.400
After all, everything is political, everything is a matter of the public, everything is a

16:27.400 --> 16:31.720
virtue signal, every moment is an opportunity to show to wider society that you are on the

16:31.720 --> 16:35.360
right side of history, it feels like an entire generation of people have inherited something

16:35.360 --> 16:38.720
potentially great, something that they have no idea what to do with or how to continue

16:38.720 --> 16:41.960
building on it, and so they've resorted to cannibalizing it in order to further their

16:41.960 --> 16:42.960
own ends.

16:42.960 --> 16:46.760
Grand plans always come with an obsession with wiping clean the old and reordering things

16:46.760 --> 16:50.680
according to a rationalism that those in power fervently believe is objective, even though

16:50.680 --> 16:51.680
it's not.

16:51.680 --> 16:54.680
And it's not just the culture that gets reordered, but the minds of the people who

16:54.680 --> 16:55.680
live within it.

16:55.680 --> 16:59.800
I was surprised that when this guy said on reddit a few years back he was tired of being

16:59.800 --> 17:03.920
told that he had to care about everything, the replies he got were decrying him for his

17:03.920 --> 17:07.240
privilege and saying that he is part of the problem for even feeling fatigued.

17:07.240 --> 17:10.520
But you know what, fine, I'll be part of the problem.

17:10.520 --> 17:11.520
I don't care.

17:11.520 --> 17:14.520
I don't care about any of this, and I'm tired of pretending that I do, or rather

17:14.520 --> 17:16.020
I was tired of pretending.

17:16.020 --> 17:19.420
I've been open about not caring for years now, why do you think that the terminally

17:19.420 --> 17:21.280
invested call me a nazi?

17:21.280 --> 17:25.360
Because if everything is political, and if their grand plan requires everyone to be involved,

17:25.360 --> 17:30.200
otherwise it's not real socialism, simply saying no means that you are fundamentally

17:30.200 --> 17:32.400
on the wrong side of history.

17:32.400 --> 17:36.680
Even if that no means that you just want to shut out the noise and the god-awful cancer

17:36.680 --> 17:39.660
of the outside world for just a minute, even if it means that you just want to log the

17:39.660 --> 17:40.720
fuck off for a while.

17:40.720 --> 17:45.080
But like that reddit post shows, the who cares mentality is spreading, and frankly, that's

17:45.080 --> 17:46.320
a trend I can get behind.

17:46.320 --> 17:50.360
In meditations, Marcus Aurelius wrote about this and a billion other things like 2,000

17:50.360 --> 17:51.360
years ago,

17:51.360 --> 17:53.400
You always own the option of having no opinion.

17:53.400 --> 17:57.160
There is never any need to get worked up or to trouble your soul about things you can't

17:57.160 --> 17:58.160
control.

17:58.160 --> 18:01.200
These things are not asking to be judged by you, leave them alone.

18:01.200 --> 18:06.200
It is tyrants and totalitarians that say everything is political, that want to force you to care,

18:06.200 --> 18:10.560
that exclaim that you are not properly buying into society, and therefore are a reactionary

18:10.560 --> 18:12.880
if you're not always on and always emoting.

18:12.880 --> 18:16.940
To them, everything is political because they view your brain as political, and they want

18:16.940 --> 18:20.120
to conquer it like they want to conquer every other domain of politics.

18:20.120 --> 18:23.000
I'm not saying don't care about anything like an edgelord.

18:23.000 --> 18:26.920
I'm saying reserve your care for things that you genuinely care about.

18:26.920 --> 18:28.200
Quit the performative garbage.

18:28.200 --> 18:31.640
You don't have to agree with me politically, in fact, it probably works better if you don't,

18:31.640 --> 18:34.800
because I'm not asking you to regurgitate what I say, like you're going down a Markov

18:34.800 --> 18:35.800
chain.

18:35.800 --> 18:39.120
I'm saying your conscience knows what to focus on, and that's going to be unique to each

18:39.120 --> 18:40.600
person, so focus on it.

18:40.600 --> 18:42.100
Forget about all this other junk.

18:42.100 --> 18:43.720
Do what actually matters.
