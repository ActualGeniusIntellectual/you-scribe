0	7120	I just realized something.
7120	8440	The Olympics are over, aren't they?
8440	10240	I don't even remember when they started.
10240	13760	I know they were in China, but I don't know who won the most medals, I don't know if there
13760	18500	were any big upsets or gaffes, they barely even register on my radar as a notable event
18500	19500	that recently happened.
19500	23580	The only thing I do recall is the Big Air Shojang meme, which was when this picture
23580	25600	went viral on social media.
25600	29320	China had constructed its artificial ski run in an industrial park, and the contrast between
29320	34200	the fake white slope and what looks like a brown and bloom post-apocalyptic fallout
34200	37640	hellscape in the background blew pretty much everybody away.
37640	39520	This is what the Olympics have been reduced to.
39520	43040	I remember, not long ago, people actually cared about these games.
43040	47520	Even people who didn't like sports too much, people like me for example, might feel a twinge
47520	50520	of national pride when their country claims another medal.
50520	53980	And not caring about the Olympics is a relatively new phenomenon, rather than being a product
53980	56680	of the cynicism of the 90s, like it usually is.
56680	59960	Even up to about a decade ago, I remember the Olympics as an event that had the power
59960	63960	to unite people under the banner of sportsmanship, goodwill, and fair play.
63960	65440	But now, nobody cares.
65440	69020	They are a rusted out husk of their former glory, which is what makes this picture so
69020	70020	appropriate.
70020	73080	There's no reason for me to go into any of the minor Olympic scandals because it just
73080	74080	doesn't matter.
74080	77760	The Olympics, now more than ever, are just another avenue where nations can make propaganda
77760	79740	moves to advance their interests.
79740	82940	During the games though, Twitter fed me this little piece of bullshit.
82940	86800	The western powers tried and failed to discredit the Beijing Winter Olympics.
86800	90660	In fact, the games were a runaway success, symbolizing peace, international friendship,
90660	91660	and solidarity.
91660	95520	They were also the greenest Olympics in history, that has to be fake, considering how much
95520	98980	fake snow they moved around, and a model of COVID management.
98980	103180	Twitter, what gave you the thought that I would ever want to see something like this?
103180	106860	Truthfully, nobody wants to see this, but this tweet was nonetheless promoted to a lot
106860	107860	of people.
107860	110760	Not as a paid advertisement, which Twitter marks with a promoted tag, but under the much
110760	113100	more benign, you might like tag.
113100	117300	Of course, there's no reason that I, or anybody else, fed this nonsense would actually
117300	118300	like it.
118300	121940	We didn't click on Olympic tweets, or Chinese tweets, or controversy tweets.
121940	125580	Twitter thought we might like it because Twitter wants us to like it, it's as simple as that.
125580	130500	The trending tab on pretty much every single social media platform is absolutely useless.
130500	135080	Twitter is most of all, but that's not because it's all just astroturfed pre-purchased garbage.
135080	136520	That is part of it though, of course.
136520	140840	If a new movie or TV show comes out, especially if it's Disney or Capeshit, expect it to
140840	144460	be right at the top of the trending tab, whether or not it actually deserves it, complete with
144460	146500	a special hashtag emoji.
146500	150540	These things are emojis that Twitter automatically posts, attached to a given hashtag.
150540	154680	Generally, companies will buy hashtags with emojis for promotional purposes, in order
154680	156260	to make their product look special.
156260	158180	Whenever I see one of these, I just cringe.
158180	161660	It makes me think that somebody out there thought it was a good idea to drop a big bag
161660	164100	of cash so Twitter can look even more annoying.
164100	165780	Oh, and also, guess what?
165780	169400	The only hashtag emoji that is permanent is the Black Lives Matter one, and according
169400	173320	to Twitter's backend, it's not set to expire until the year 3000.
173320	176440	I guess it truly is a thousand-year Reich.
176440	181040	What the trending tab should be is a list of the most common words currently being tweeted,
181040	185480	removing of course stuff like the, or a, or I, and sometimes we do actually get that.
185480	190320	The recent Destiny drama blew up primarily on Twitter, and so the word Destiny was trending
190320	191320	for several days.
191320	195160	Vosh trends on Twitter almost weekly at this point, because that's about how often he says
195160	199140	something so majorly dumb that it causes an internet kerfuffle.
199140	203660	And when there's real news, like the Ukraine-Russia war, that often dominates the trending tab
203660	204660	too.
204660	208220	But then you start to notice some weird stuff, like okay, right now, Ayato is trending because
208220	209780	of a Genshin Impact thing.
209780	212960	I don't know, I don't play the Chinese spyware game, you fucking degenerates.
212960	217300	But Ayato is trending with 151,000 tweets right now, and at the same time, Roger Stone
217300	219460	is trending with only 7,000 tweets.
219460	223100	Considering Twitter's size, is 7,000 tweets really trending?
223100	226160	Well, if you click on that trend, you'll see why it's being pushed.
226160	228460	It's a January 6th Capitol riot thing.
228460	229460	Of course.
229460	234340	Now I'm not quite saying that Twitter deliberately boosts topics to fit a political bias.
234340	236120	I think that's probably actually not the case.
236120	239240	Not because Twitter isn't biased, they clearly are, but because I don't think they have the
239240	241840	time to manually police every tweet on the platform.
241840	244160	If they did, they would have handed all the child porn by now.
244160	248240	My guess is, they're flagging certain accounts, maybe those with that verification mark, or
248240	251580	maybe not, as having more weight in the what trends algorithm.
251580	256160	So let's say 50,000 normies tweet about something, and that might cause a trend, while you only
256160	259900	need 5,000 trend-friendly accounts to do the same thing.
259900	263880	That seems to explain this behavior more than any kind of centralized push from Twitter.
263880	267080	But at the same time, if this is how it works, Twitter knows what they're doing when they're
267080	268480	giving certain accounts this power.
268480	271760	But that's the only reason I can think of as to why some of these trends are so low.
271760	274840	Ron Perlman with 7,000 tweets, did he even do anything recently?
274840	276320	Jon Stewart with 4,000.
276320	280160	Frankly, the only thing I've seen that old fossil appear on in the last year is adamant
280160	281280	such as Sunday Show.
281280	283620	And Streets of Rage is tweeting without even a number.
283620	287660	In fact, when I clicked on this for the video, the term Streets of Rage might have been used
287660	292260	100 times on Twitter in the past 12 hours, mostly in reference to the upcoming Streets
292260	293340	of Rage 4 game.
293340	296180	I don't believe this is an actual trend, it's probably one of those paid spots.
296180	299940	Also, just in case you're getting your hopes up, Streets of Rage 4 is a mobile game.
299940	300940	Sorry.
300940	304380	Yes, I have been deliberately avoiding the elephant in the room sitting on the edges
304380	306100	of all these screenshots.
306100	307460	It's the Will Smith thing.
307460	310220	Alright, just in case you haven't heard, check it out.
310280	311760	Jada, I love you.
311760	313760	G.I. Jane 2, can't wait to see it.
313760	314760	Alright?
314760	323480	That was a nice one, okay.
323480	324480	I'm out here.
324480	325480	Uh-oh.
325480	326480	Richard?
326480	327480	Oh, wow.
327480	328480	Wow.
328480	337480	Will Smith just smacked the shit out of me.
337480	345460	Wow, dude.
345460	352420	It was a G.I. Jane joke.
352420	355500	I'm going to, okay?
355500	360400	Oh, okay.
360400	364980	That was the greatest night in the history of television.
364980	365980	Okay.
365980	366980	Okay.
367480	370160	I don't want to dwell too much on this because just like the Olympics, I don't actually care
370160	371160	about celeb shit.
371160	372160	I don't care about the Oscars.
372160	375080	I didn't even know the Oscars were happening until this event went viral.
375080	378280	I don't know anybody else who was following the Oscars either, at least until the How
378280	379460	Can He Slap event.
379460	383080	The prevailing narrative about it is that Chris Rock told a joke about Will Smith's
383080	385240	wife's baldness by referring to G.I.
385240	386240	Jane 2.
386240	389520	Then Will just Chad walked up, smacked him in the mouth, and then proceeded to yell at
389520	390520	him from his seat.
390520	393800	Everybody online right now is making this about ableism, about black-on-black violence,
393800	395240	about toxic masculinity.
395240	397720	Everybody is filtering this through their own political lens.
397720	399380	Everybody's reaching, and it's fucking cringe.
399380	402720	I know you retards think that everything is actually political, but it's not.
402720	404540	Stop trying to fit it all into a box.
404540	409000	This is 100% a personal situation, and everybody else is wrong about it.
409000	412020	Listen closely again and watch the body language of those involved.
412020	413780	Look, Chris Rock makes a bald joke.
413780	415840	Will's laughing it off, but Jada looks angry.
415840	417720	Chris sees that she's annoyed and says,
417720	420120	That was a nice one, okay.
420120	423960	He's clearly insinuating that the bald joke was him pulling punches, and if he wanted
423960	427480	to really piss her off, he'd joke about her cucking him, and the resulting shit show
427480	431360	around that, and in case you didn't know, that's a thing, too.
431360	439320	I think it was about four and a half, four years ago, started a friendship with August,
439320	445620	and we actually became really, really good friends, and it all started with him just
445620	454360	needing some help, me wanting to help his health, his mental state, and we found all
454360	459440	those different resources to help pull him through.
459440	463560	As time went on, I got into a different kind of entanglement.
463560	467200	I think you need to say clearly what happened.
467200	471100	I got into an entanglement with August.
471100	472100	That's what I said.
472100	473100	An entanglement?
473100	474100	Yes.
474100	475100	Yes.
475100	476100	Of relationship.
476100	477100	Yes.
477100	478100	It was a relationship.
478100	479100	Absolutely.
479100	484320	Now, I gotta be with you at the press conference while you tell the world about your trip.
484320	490320	Well, I love my baby, I'm gonna stand by my baby no matter what.
490320	496720	No, I definitely understand why it would look that way or feel that way, but I actually
496720	499240	don't look at it as a transgression at all.
499240	505160	Through that particular journey, I learned so much about myself and was able to really
505160	514120	confront a lot of emotional immaturity, emotional insecurity, and I was really able to do some
514120	516240	really deep healing.
516240	519040	This is why I don't think the event was staged to get more eyes on the Oscars.
519040	522640	That's why I don't think it was about the bald thing or the ableism or whatever else.
522640	524080	It's simply a personal matter.
524080	527680	But because it's juicy drama, people keep digging up alternate angles or behind the
527680	531080	scenes footage or pointing out how hypocritical it is for Hollywood to think about coming
531080	534720	down on Will Smith when most of them take regular trips out to Epstein's Island.
534720	537400	Like I said, I'm not here to discuss this event specifically.
537400	538680	There's no analysis to be had.
538680	539740	There's nothing to talk about.
539740	569640	It's simply what the boondocks described years ago.
569640	574140	I will say, though, it is damn funny to see that Chris Rock has the fear of God slapped
574140	575140	into him.
575140	578560	The point I'm making is this event was trending because it was an event that happened, but
578560	580200	not because it's substantive.
580200	581440	Of course it would be trending.
581440	582980	The Oscars are peak establishment.
582980	586700	It's the wealthy huffing their own farts and thinking that us plebs actually care to watch
586700	587700	them.
587700	589240	Any excuse to put them on that trending tab will do.
589240	594080	Even if nothing happened at the Oscars, even if it was the most boring show possible, it
594080	595080	would still be there.
595080	599140	The last time I cared about any of this was when Ricky Gervais hosted the Golden Globes
599140	601220	and told them all to their faces exactly what they were.
601220	608540	You know this famous Red Letter Media clip, right?
608540	610620	It's been way too overused at this point, as much as I love it.
610620	613420	But it applies not only to Marvel and Disney and Star Trek.
613420	614900	It applies not only to entertainment.
614900	617400	It applies to culture, to politics, to philosophy.
617400	619220	That's the point of the NPC meme.
619220	623300	That people are receiving their prescribed wisdom from their smartphones or computers
623300	627260	and that it's been pre-packaged in just such a way that they don't need to actually think
627260	628860	about what positions they're adopting.
628860	633260	It's a one-size-fits-all mentality, but for what you believe is true about the world.
633260	637460	A Markov Chain is a model of probability that describes a sequence of possible events in
637460	641920	which the chance each event happens depends solely on the state of the previous event
641920	642920	and no other factors.
642920	643920	Here's a great example.
643920	648540	A board game that relies solely on dice for moves, like for example Snakes and Ladders,
648540	649540	is a Markov Chain.
649540	652700	On each turn of Snakes and Ladders, the only thing that matters is the current state of
652700	654620	the board and your roll of the dice.
654620	657580	Your chances of getting a specific roll are the same every turn.
657700	660720	Compare that to a card game where cards are continuously discarded from the deck, like
660720	661720	in Blackjack.
661720	664940	In a game like this, as you play through the deck, options within the deck are removed
664940	668380	from play, changing the chances that you will get a specific card each turn.
668380	672260	In this example, Snakes and Ladders is a Markov Chain, but Blackjack isn't, because previous
672260	675640	turns do not affect the probability of the dice roll in Snakes and Ladders, but previous
675640	679260	draws do affect the probability of the next draw in Blackjack.
679260	682940	Have you ever noticed that when you're talking to somebody who is entirely ideological, the
682940	684780	responses coming out of their mouth?
684780	688340	Everything that they say, every answer that they give you, is identical to every other
688340	690100	person who believes the same thing?
690100	693480	This is because their thought patterns move like a Markov Chain.
693480	698300	They always give the same output, regardless of reality, because it is being filtered down
698300	699720	through the same lens.
699720	704040	For example, Jordan Peterson famously demonstrated this effect when being interviewed by a feminist
704040	705040	a few years ago.
705040	706040	I'm married.
706040	707460	Modern marriage has a lot to recommend it.
707460	709580	I do also think it is a patron institution.
709580	710580	It is literally...
710580	712700	Of course you think that!
712700	716700	Because you think virtually everything that occurs in our society is a patriarchal institution.
716700	719360	It's easy to think that, because then you only have to think one thing.
719360	720360	You could let...
720360	721580	If a one thing answer for everything.
721580	722580	You could let me...
722580	724240	It's part of the patriarchal institution.
724240	729380	You know, part of the problem too is, with this sort of discussion, is that it's, and
729380	736820	this is why I consider it a manifestation of ideological possession, it's predictable.
736820	737820	Well that's what...
737820	738820	You know, knowing your stance on...
738820	742420	But having a coherent ideology does mean that it is predictable because...
742420	743420	You don't need an ideology.
743420	746820	It is one logical thing that flows from another, and all those pieces tessellate together.
746820	749980	That's what I find very interesting about your thinking, I find it quite slightly baffling,
749980	752660	is that I don't really see how all the pieces fit together.
752660	759860	And you know, the idea that something should be consistent, you were talking about the
759860	765740	necessity for consistency in ideology, it's like, I'm not hearing what you think.
765740	771660	I'm hearing how you're able to represent the ideology you were taught.
771660	774660	And it's not that interesting, because I don't know anything about you.
774660	778460	I could replace you with someone else who thinks the same way, and that means you're
778460	779800	not here.
779800	781060	That's what it means.
781060	783600	It's not pleasant.
783600	786380	So you're not drawing...
786380	791100	You're not integrating the specifics of your personal experience with what you've been
791100	796580	taught to synthesise something that's genuine and surprising, and engaging in a narrative
796580	798180	sense as a consequence.
798180	801100	And that's the pathology of ideological possession.
801100	802940	It's not good.
802940	808300	And it's not good that I know where you stand on things, once I know a few things.
808300	809300	Why have a conversation?
809300	810940	I already know where you stand on things.
810940	812980	I bet you don't know where I stand on all things.
812980	815620	I would hope that that was true.
815620	819140	Okay, let's talk about transgender issues.
819620	824820	What do you think I think about transgender issues?
824820	834040	I suspect that you think that gender expression, gender identity, are fundamentally social
834040	836260	constructs, but I could be wrong.
836260	840900	No, I believe that there are definitely some biological differences between the sexes.
840900	841900	We've observed them.
841900	846100	I do believe that gender is a hugely powerful social structure that we've built on top of
846100	850260	that, that it is largely but not entirely socially constructed.
850260	852620	Notice how he predicted exactly what she would say?
852620	856020	She then said, no, I'm not going to say that, and then admitted that everything he said
856020	857740	was actually correct about her?
857740	861860	Once you understand what lens they are filtering everything through, you can completely predict
861860	862860	what they're going to say.
862860	865260	You don't even need to ask them the question anymore.
865260	868740	Simply run the input through the lens, and you will get the same answer every time.
868740	870540	Of course, rightoids do this too.
870540	874460	Libertarians and Ancaps and conservatives all have their own Markov chain thoughts.
874460	878140	It's not a product of any one ideology, rather it's a product of ideological thinking.
878140	881700	A libertarian will always ask their internal processes some key questions.
881700	883100	How is the state at fault?
883100	884980	How did regulation cause this problem?
884980	888420	And then spit out an ideological answer, which may or may not be accurate to reality.
888420	889880	A socialist will do the same thing.
889880	891360	How does this relate to class conflict?
891360	893220	How are the means of production affected?
893220	896700	Talk to enough ideologues, and you'll find that once you've picked up their source code,
896700	900540	you can run any variable through it that you want, and generate the exact same answers
900540	902140	that they would give you in a conversation.
902140	905380	I made a video a while ago, I think it was an E3 video, I can't remember which year,
905380	909460	where I made the point that we build institutions in order to capture and properly express virtues
909460	910460	in society.
910460	912180	For example, school is a place of higher learning.
912180	914180	The Olympics are to display the best of human athleticism.
914180	915420	The Oscars, for example, are reacting.
915420	918900	But the point I made in that video is that the world is not a fixed place, and that the
918900	921340	location of these virtues may shift over time.
921340	925660	You can make a decent argument, though not as solid as most rightoids believe, that academia
925660	926660	has become corrupted.
926660	930000	That doesn't mean that the virtue of learning is gone from the world, but that the virtue
930000	934040	of learning must be found in a place outside of that old institution sometimes.
934040	937400	An old institution may have had a purpose, but if the location of the virtue shifts,
937400	941800	then that institution will also change into a self-perpetuating bureaucracy that only
941800	945920	exists on the back of its previous reputation, and that will eventually run out of steam.
945920	947480	That's why all this stuff feels hollow.
947480	951360	The Olympics, the Oscars, the trending tab that they're in that pushes heaps of worthless
951360	955660	nothingness in front of your eyes, every show or movie or video game claiming to have broken
955660	959520	new ground, every event demanding not only your attention, but your public expression
959520	960520	of care.
960520	963920	Every notable individual who comes out of the closet as a member of this week's Prague
963920	967760	protected class, all of it feels like it demands your brain space, and that there's something
967760	970200	wrong with you if you don't give it up willingly and publicly.
970200	972720	There's something damaged about you if you don't play the game.
972720	976400	You are required not only to care, but to emote to others that you do.
976400	981200	And yes, although I do think that all sides of politics can do this, right now, it's
981200	984020	the left that is co-opting this tendency for their own ends.
984020	987400	After all, everything is political, everything is a matter of the public, everything is a
987400	991720	virtue signal, every moment is an opportunity to show to wider society that you are on the
991720	995360	right side of history, it feels like an entire generation of people have inherited something
995360	998720	potentially great, something that they have no idea what to do with or how to continue
998720	1001960	building on it, and so they've resorted to cannibalizing it in order to further their
1001960	1002960	own ends.
1002960	1006760	Grand plans always come with an obsession with wiping clean the old and reordering things
1006760	1010680	according to a rationalism that those in power fervently believe is objective, even though
1010680	1011680	it's not.
1011680	1014680	And it's not just the culture that gets reordered, but the minds of the people who
1014680	1015680	live within it.
1015680	1019800	I was surprised that when this guy said on reddit a few years back he was tired of being
1019800	1023920	told that he had to care about everything, the replies he got were decrying him for his
1023920	1027240	privilege and saying that he is part of the problem for even feeling fatigued.
1027240	1030520	But you know what, fine, I'll be part of the problem.
1030520	1031520	I don't care.
1031520	1034520	I don't care about any of this, and I'm tired of pretending that I do, or rather
1034520	1036020	I was tired of pretending.
1036020	1039420	I've been open about not caring for years now, why do you think that the terminally
1039420	1041280	invested call me a nazi?
1041280	1045360	Because if everything is political, and if their grand plan requires everyone to be involved,
1045360	1050200	otherwise it's not real socialism, simply saying no means that you are fundamentally
1050200	1052400	on the wrong side of history.
1052400	1056680	Even if that no means that you just want to shut out the noise and the god-awful cancer
1056680	1059660	of the outside world for just a minute, even if it means that you just want to log the
1059660	1060720	fuck off for a while.
1060720	1065080	But like that reddit post shows, the who cares mentality is spreading, and frankly, that's
1065080	1066320	a trend I can get behind.
1066320	1070360	In meditations, Marcus Aurelius wrote about this and a billion other things like 2,000
1070360	1071360	years ago,
1071360	1073400	You always own the option of having no opinion.
1073400	1077160	There is never any need to get worked up or to trouble your soul about things you can't
1077160	1078160	control.
1078160	1081200	These things are not asking to be judged by you, leave them alone.
1081200	1086200	It is tyrants and totalitarians that say everything is political, that want to force you to care,
1086200	1090560	that exclaim that you are not properly buying into society, and therefore are a reactionary
1090560	1092880	if you're not always on and always emoting.
1092880	1096940	To them, everything is political because they view your brain as political, and they want
1096940	1100120	to conquer it like they want to conquer every other domain of politics.
1100120	1103000	I'm not saying don't care about anything like an edgelord.
1103000	1106920	I'm saying reserve your care for things that you genuinely care about.
1106920	1108200	Quit the performative garbage.
1108200	1111640	You don't have to agree with me politically, in fact, it probably works better if you don't,
1111640	1114800	because I'm not asking you to regurgitate what I say, like you're going down a Markov
1114800	1115800	chain.
1115800	1119120	I'm saying your conscience knows what to focus on, and that's going to be unique to each
1119120	1120600	person, so focus on it.
1120600	1122100	Forget about all this other junk.
1122100	1123720	Do what actually matters.
