WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:08.080
good morning everyone it's time for the garden video 2021 this is early may and i have some

00:08.080 --> 00:12.960
plants here only four right now there'll be more here soon these are spinach by the way and i'm

00:12.960 --> 00:20.640
just gonna use a small dish to give them some water here in the early morning oops

00:23.760 --> 00:29.520
and there we go but the big thing happening at the moment is that we have to go and fix the garden

00:29.600 --> 00:35.760
from last year's damage i don't know if you saw last year's video but uh so there's there's

00:35.760 --> 00:39.760
some stuff that needs to be done so before we put any plants in that'll be the first thing that we

00:39.760 --> 00:47.600
do with the garden this year and here's the state of the garden yeah it's kind of no good eh this

00:47.600 --> 00:53.920
is from when last year naomi broke the door that was here she kicked it in while she was watering

00:53.920 --> 00:58.720
the plants but that's fine so what i have to do is i have some more used doors that are you know

00:58.720 --> 01:03.680
they're no good for inside the house i'm going to use them for this um i'll shovel all this earth

01:03.680 --> 01:10.160
back i'll uh maybe even reuse some of the screws there to attach the new door and then the new

01:10.160 --> 01:17.440
plants come tomorrow so naomi and i will uh will weed plant and water and guess what using the

01:17.440 --> 01:26.960
power of movie magic all i have to do is snap my fingers and it'll be done well it's uh it's a bit

01:26.960 --> 01:29.600
bigger than i would have liked it's a lot taller than the last door

01:32.480 --> 01:37.840
oops but you know what it'll be fine it'll be fine uh but definitely naomi can't go over this

01:37.840 --> 01:46.480
side anymore geez like it's it's like almost up to my waist all right guys the plants are here

01:46.480 --> 01:52.320
look at them look at them that was a little bit yellow but it'll be fine it's time these guys

01:52.320 --> 01:57.120
got to go outside and they got to go outside today so as naomi does all the weeding right

01:57.120 --> 02:05.680
there hi naomi hey guys this all has to also be smoothed out and i'm going to grab all the

02:05.680 --> 02:12.160
compost from the composter back there and shove it in the garden that's going to be a lot of fun

02:15.440 --> 02:18.320
composting is good for the earth but it sure is gross

02:19.200 --> 02:27.840
basically for a good compost you need uh you need greens which are you know vegetables including the

02:27.840 --> 02:33.760
orange carrots but generally just like vegetables and you need browns which are egg cartons and

02:33.760 --> 02:38.800
toilet paper rolls and that'll mix together and give you a good compost so that's the top of it

02:38.800 --> 02:44.080
where it's this is all new stuff oh my god what i just pulled out a clump of dirt that wasn't

02:44.160 --> 02:51.760
didn't have anything attached to it it was just roots yep this stuff at the top here will become

02:51.760 --> 02:59.840
compost in like a year or two it's the stuff at the bottom that's going to be very fully composted

03:00.640 --> 03:09.920
come on come on come on it's you look at that at the bottom there look at that

03:10.720 --> 03:16.720
hold on that's that's all vegetables that have been turned into compost

03:17.680 --> 03:22.400
good stuff dude this giant worm just came crawling out of the compost

03:25.120 --> 03:30.480
when he stretches he's like 10 centimeters long actually no it's more like 20 look at him go

03:32.080 --> 03:38.800
he's actually like beeline towards naomi who has who has the bug phobia there's a lot of

03:39.600 --> 03:44.640
wigglies in here already a lot of wigglies in here that's how you know it's a good compost

03:45.440 --> 03:48.400
is if you get big fat worms who are enjoying life in there

03:49.040 --> 03:55.280
it's a spider it's so many ants i hate this so much it's terrifying so so naomi how do you

03:55.280 --> 03:59.360
feel about like the next mass effect show that we do which will actually be very soon

03:59.360 --> 04:04.880
being all about the rachni oh god i forgot about them can we just skip that part

04:05.200 --> 04:12.880
so as naomi rakes and levels the earth i'm gonna do a few things i've gotta basically repair this

04:12.880 --> 04:17.360
trellis from the winter and clear off of those old cucumber vines they actually stayed there

04:17.360 --> 04:23.440
all winter any more bugs oh there's always bugs i just they're all under the dirt there we go

04:24.320 --> 04:30.720
the garden looks uh done for now we're gonna go put some plants in now we've got this bag of manure

04:30.720 --> 04:43.680
we have to cut open you'll see naomi has to figure it out so i'll just take these uh scissors

04:44.800 --> 04:50.080
from ye old kitchen that naomi's gonna get mad about using on poop yeah what are you doing we

04:50.080 --> 04:58.880
have other scissors and you cut open the bag of manure and there it is there's our manure

05:00.720 --> 05:04.960
no one wants you to film and what we'll do is we'll just like dig a little hole and put the

05:04.960 --> 05:12.320
poop in and then put the plant in the hole and then bury it up and there we go let me show you

05:12.320 --> 05:19.680
how it's done here is how to plant a plant 101 dig down a whole bunch okay and then you take

05:19.680 --> 05:25.280
yourself a handful of poop why aren't you using gloves for the poop take yourself this handful

05:25.280 --> 05:30.960
of poop here it is i'm gonna just put it in the bottom of the hole there's the poop

05:32.400 --> 05:39.280
and you lick your fingers you have your pepper plants right you just kind of pop them out

05:40.960 --> 05:50.000
oh from the bottom yeah okay come on pepper plant i'm losing breaking it jesus pop it out

05:50.000 --> 06:02.400
come on and then you like put it with the poop and you put it like in the ground like so see

06:02.400 --> 06:07.360
and don't cover up the plant obviously and there's your plant hooray and now when the roots go down

06:07.920 --> 06:15.840
and impact that poop it'll take off real quick and everything's in it a little bit dirty but

06:15.840 --> 06:22.640
it's fine it's fine it's just me now Naomi uh saw a big bug and left but we uh we pretty much

06:22.640 --> 06:28.480
finished up anyway she just she's cleaning up the tomatoes are in the back there by the deck

06:28.480 --> 06:32.960
as are the cucumbers the cucumbers are a little bit bunched together but that's okay because

06:32.960 --> 06:37.120
they're gonna they're gonna grow up that trellis and over onto the deck so that's fine peppers

06:37.120 --> 06:44.480
are here same as last year along with the snap peas along the side of the shed here here there's

06:44.480 --> 06:49.760
kale and spinach a row of each and i didn't mind playing them a little bit closer together than

06:49.760 --> 06:55.040
normal because i'll be cutting them regularly so they before they actually start growing in on each

06:55.040 --> 07:00.000
other i'll be snipping them and then eating them it was a hard couple hours work but you know now

07:00.000 --> 07:09.040
that it's done it's it's not that big of a deal you know like that first initial round of work

07:09.040 --> 07:14.560
is pretty tough look at that look at that bug i'm gonna get him ha i soaked him so that first

07:14.560 --> 07:21.680
initial round of um of planting is kind of tough but after you're set you're pretty much set you

07:21.680 --> 07:27.440
just gotta and you just gotta water every day and kind of wait basically as long as you put

07:27.440 --> 07:32.880
that that manure in there you'll be fine good morning guys it's the first week of june about

07:32.880 --> 07:39.280
5 45 in the morning and check it out the spinach is at the point i'm gonna have to harvest it soon

07:39.280 --> 07:43.360
there's actually a few dead leaves there from some frost a couple weeks ago but i can start

07:43.360 --> 07:49.040
cutting this spinach off and eating it um the beans are all going good except for that last

07:49.040 --> 07:55.120
one back there you can see it's bent a bit the uh the frost killed that one one of the cucumbers

07:55.120 --> 07:59.200
died it used to go in red that spot right there that's gone and the rest of them are kind of

07:59.200 --> 08:04.720
wilted um and a few leaves fell off this kale so there's only one leaf left in the kale plant

08:05.440 --> 08:11.120
i don't know if that's going to make it but like aside from those those problems everything is

08:11.120 --> 08:18.400
bright and green and growing yeah man even the basil is pretty good though i might start cutting

08:18.400 --> 08:24.480
that soon too so it's the middle of june and check out how it looks tomatoes coming in nicely

08:24.480 --> 08:33.920
the cucumbers perked right up kale's growing in peppers they always take a while and look at look

08:33.920 --> 08:39.360
at how high some of these beans are climbing man so with the kale you just kind of take your

08:39.360 --> 08:52.480
scissors here like this and go in you snip snip off all the lower leaves and those will be the

08:52.480 --> 09:04.320
ones that you eat and the higher leaves will help stimulate some new growth like so you can

09:04.320 --> 09:09.600
leave about two or three leaves on there leave the smaller ones in the middle all these i'll

09:09.600 --> 09:13.520
freeze them away and i'll eat them over the course of the year and then that's the plant

09:15.120 --> 09:20.480
i'm gonna do that for all of these guys and good morning everyone the garden's looking very good

09:20.480 --> 09:29.520
there's naomi going to get water and the tomatoes are actually taking off quite a bit peppers are

09:29.520 --> 09:33.840
doing okay this is actually the earliest growth we've seen on a lot of these plants in this

09:33.840 --> 09:40.320
location the cucumbers are going there's the spinach now i picked off a bunch of the seeds

09:40.320 --> 09:44.880
of the spinach and the leaves and i'm hoping they'll return because i know with spinach

09:44.880 --> 09:48.720
if you let them go too long they will go to seed which is no good because they stop growing leaves

09:49.360 --> 09:54.560
well i picked all the seed shoots off and i cut all the leaves and it looks like the leaves are

09:54.560 --> 10:00.480
starting to regrow again so maybe we'll get more spinach out of it there's the pea vines they're

10:00.480 --> 10:08.720
going up no peas yet i don't think anyway let's take a closer look maybe some coming in here

10:11.920 --> 10:18.160
the peas are going very well this time this one broke this one broke back at the start of the year

10:18.160 --> 10:24.400
and it's just it's done look at how floppy it is it's done yeah see there's like new shoots coming

10:24.400 --> 10:28.320
out of the spinach with with new leaves and new seeds so we'll get a bit more spinach out of it

10:28.320 --> 10:34.560
these cucumbers contrary to every other cucumber i've had they're growing straight up so i will

10:34.560 --> 10:41.600
have to like move them towards the various bits of mesh that i have here set up can you even reach it

10:42.160 --> 10:48.400
good so i'm going to cut some of this uh this kale because the kale is due from your trim

10:48.960 --> 10:54.320
and i'll see you in a few more weeks so i just pulled two bags of kale out of the garden these

10:54.320 --> 10:58.240
will go into the freezer and we'll eat them over the course of the winter and there's all the kale

10:58.240 --> 11:04.640
plants now that they've been trimmed down they're a lot smaller however Naomi sniffle up a storm

11:04.640 --> 11:13.200
pollen so one thing of note though is that this plant it lost all of its leaves early

11:13.200 --> 11:18.320
and like i didn't cut them they just kind of fell off but there's one leaf left that i've left there

11:18.320 --> 11:22.880
just so it has some way to get sun and it's been growing a bunch of shoots

11:24.000 --> 11:27.120
do you think it's time to cut this leaf off i don't want to kill them i want those shoots to

11:27.120 --> 11:32.480
come in before i cut this thing off well maybe you should wait till it's like more leafy then

11:32.480 --> 11:38.240
yeah once these shoots become leaves like even small leaves like like this one then i'll cut

11:38.240 --> 11:43.120
this giant leaf off hey Naomi does it bother you that i use the kitchen scissors in the garden

11:43.120 --> 11:53.120
i've given up caring it's early july and here's the garden it's it's grown quite a bit so those

11:53.120 --> 11:58.640
tomatoes are just going nuts over there and into a big jungle peppers are doing okay there's a few

11:58.640 --> 12:02.880
coming in you've harvested the kale a few times it's time for another harvest pretty much

12:04.400 --> 12:13.840
the spinach was only so so the peas have taken off all the way up

12:15.840 --> 12:20.400
it'll be on the roof soon there's actually a lot of peas this guy here for example

12:20.400 --> 12:26.720
yeah there's a pea i'm gonna eat it

12:30.160 --> 12:37.120
and it's pretty good the cucumbers are also climbing quite nicely too this is like this

12:37.120 --> 12:42.240
is a better garden than last year so things are looking pretty good out here this morning it's

12:42.320 --> 12:52.480
for one exception this vine has died it it feels very hollow i have no idea why

12:53.200 --> 12:56.240
i got most of the peas off for this tiny one before it died

12:58.080 --> 13:04.640
you can follow it all the way down and at its roots another vine has come up

13:04.640 --> 13:12.080
and that's one of these two so the roots still seem to be good but for some reason this branch

13:12.800 --> 13:19.520
died no idea why but here it is there are a lot of peas now though i'm gonna have to

13:21.360 --> 13:28.240
start taking these off and eating them also look at this that is the first tomato welcome

13:28.240 --> 13:34.400
to august 1st everybody and the garden's going isn't it look at it so let's let's go over it

13:36.000 --> 13:39.680
tomatoes are all coming in there's a bunch of them about this size they'll be

13:39.680 --> 13:46.640
good to pick in a few weeks peppers same thing okay get in there

13:47.600 --> 13:54.480
yeah look at those they'll be good soon too the peas we ate a lot of peas and then they started

13:54.480 --> 14:00.320
dying off um there's still a few coming in here but there's a few we have a few more just made it

14:00.320 --> 14:08.160
too but same problem as last year a bunch of the roots just started dying something is happening

14:08.160 --> 14:13.120
with my peas every year that's causing them to die halfway through the season now i'm still

14:13.120 --> 14:17.120
getting growth and i'm still getting new peas but as you can see a lot of the vines are just not

14:17.120 --> 14:21.920
doing very well the spinach all died so i just pulled them out kale is going very good i've

14:21.920 --> 14:27.760
harvested five or six bags of kale and frozen it and now we have to talk about the cucumbers

14:27.760 --> 14:34.960
because the cucumbers are going crazy look at this guy cucumbers are ready man there's a few

14:34.960 --> 14:40.000
more hanging there this one i think is too big actually oops i didn't see it behind here so the

14:40.000 --> 14:46.320
garden overall is not going as well as it did last year but it's still going very well i'm pretty

14:46.320 --> 14:50.800
happy for that see just a contrast this is a picture of my neighbor's garden and her peas

14:51.520 --> 14:57.680
and as you can see hers are going a lot better than mine um they're a lot more densely packed

14:57.680 --> 15:01.040
they had a lot more peas that were growing in there densely packed you can see them up at the

15:01.040 --> 15:08.480
top there and also even even back in there too and also the roots aren't nearly as uh

15:10.160 --> 15:18.720
as like crinkled and brittle as mine are and additionally her support is a lot less tall than

15:18.720 --> 15:24.320
mine too okay so i was gone for about five days and it rained a bunch during those five days so

15:24.320 --> 15:33.840
this garden has gone completely um unattended and it's going peppers are pretty good tomatoes are

15:33.840 --> 15:41.280
huge um and we have a problem with cucumbers because i was gone so long now they're almost

15:41.280 --> 15:45.920
too big to eat look how big this is oh my god there's two huge ones look how big this is dude

15:45.920 --> 15:57.920
okay well i'll see if we can eat them so here's today's harvest we got seven peppers

15:59.600 --> 16:04.240
uh three cucumbers only two here right now because we ate some and three more bags of

16:04.240 --> 16:08.800
kale to be frozen over the winter now if you're looking at these cucumbers and thinking they're

16:08.800 --> 16:13.600
too big and grow too long um and they'll get they're gonna be woody and full of seeds

16:13.600 --> 16:18.320
it's actually not the case we have a cucumber plant that just produces naturally very long

16:18.320 --> 16:23.520
cucumbers here's the one that we've been eating we had some for lunch today here it is and you

16:23.520 --> 16:31.040
can see even though it's huge it's actually just a regular amount of seed inside so this year my

16:31.040 --> 16:37.840
garden lesson is don't travel so much in the summer because all of those cucumbers got really

16:37.840 --> 16:46.880
big again these are almost too big to eat even geez but during the perfect time it was to pick

16:46.880 --> 16:54.560
them i was i was not around there as well oh my god there's too many the tomatoes are getting

16:54.560 --> 16:59.920
really big i'll probably start picking those as soon as they start turning uh turning red

17:02.160 --> 17:07.040
peppers also very big too but i'll just wait a little bit longer until they uh they start

17:07.040 --> 17:11.200
turning um yellow i guess they go yellow then orange then red eh and it's time for the kale

17:11.200 --> 17:18.480
harvest everybody kale and here we are it is the last week of august i don't know if you can tell

17:18.480 --> 17:24.000
but it's starting to rain and i actually have some pretty bad allergies right now so i'm going

17:24.000 --> 17:32.480
to do this quick um here's the garden a lot of the tomatoes are coming in there are still some

17:32.480 --> 17:40.240
more peppers that are growing down there as well the kale is doing okay and the cucumbers are

17:40.240 --> 17:45.920
pretty much done but there's like five good cucumbers that need to be harvested the peas

17:45.920 --> 17:52.000
of course are over we ate a lot of peas this year but they're done at this point i'm going to pull

17:52.000 --> 17:57.040
a lot of the red tomatoes off and then we'll probably uh figure out what to do with them

17:57.040 --> 18:01.920
maybe make sauce maybe make salsa and i have too many cucumbers i can't eat them fast enough

18:02.480 --> 18:09.040
but i'm sure it'll be okay what is this this is a giant weed

18:12.480 --> 18:16.560
yeah right here it's just it's not even part of the tomato it's just a giant

18:17.200 --> 18:19.440
weed i didn't even notice it

18:23.120 --> 18:24.240
oh my god

18:24.240 --> 18:29.600
hold on i'm trying to

18:36.000 --> 18:37.040
that's actually really big

18:40.400 --> 18:45.360
i didn't even notice it this whole time so because there's still at least two to three more weeks of

18:45.360 --> 18:50.560
decent weather left i didn't pull everything off these cucumbers are a bit yellow i think

18:50.560 --> 18:55.600
i might have left them on there too long so i guess we'll we'll eat them and see how they are

18:55.600 --> 18:59.680
here's all the tomatoes that had to come off there's maybe four times the amount still on

18:59.680 --> 19:04.000
the bushes that are still kind of green so we'll give it a few more weeks for it to pull the garden

19:04.000 --> 19:09.600
out and i also brought the basil plant upstairs it's time to to pull the leaves off this as well

19:10.480 --> 19:16.480
the only thing is i still don't know how to make dried basil i don't really have access to like a

19:16.480 --> 19:24.000
dry basement or anything so i don't know all right it is september 2nd and uh i'm quite sick

19:24.000 --> 19:30.720
right now but i'm doing this anyway because the uh the growing season here in ontario is pretty

19:30.720 --> 19:35.360
much over a lot of those tomatoes are good to go but a lot of them aren't a lot see there's still

19:35.360 --> 19:42.000
a pretty big green one right there but basically it's time to pull everything off let them ripen

19:42.000 --> 19:46.160
up in the house there's a few more cucumbers over there they got to be harvested the cucumbers did

19:46.160 --> 19:52.320
not grow as well as last year's the tomatoes are about on par the peppers are about on par so i

19:52.320 --> 19:57.840
guess i'll collect them all and we'll see what we have so here's a big pile of red tomatoes and i'm

19:57.840 --> 20:04.240
going to gamble with the ones that i left on the vine like this one for example or this one maybe

20:04.240 --> 20:11.120
they'll keep growing the problem is that yeah and these guys here they're still pretty small

20:12.080 --> 20:15.440
the problem is we're getting into the part of the uh of the canadian

20:16.000 --> 20:22.160
summer and fall where we sometimes get freak frost early in the year and if we do these will

20:22.160 --> 20:26.320
all be gone but it might be worth a gamble just to leave them up for a couple weeks

20:26.960 --> 20:32.640
and see if we get anything else out of it so just like last year basically as soon as we hit

20:32.640 --> 20:37.280
september i kind of let the garden go things really weren't growing anymore and we had some

20:37.280 --> 20:41.920
early frost so basically the idea was i'm not going to water it i'm not going to invest any

20:41.920 --> 20:48.000
more time in it but whatever i happen to get out of it i will take down before it's all finally

20:48.000 --> 20:51.920
dead so for example there's some pretty big peppers here you see like that one right there

20:52.480 --> 20:57.600
and there's a few new like pepper flowers that probably aren't going to go anywhere

20:57.600 --> 21:02.240
there's still a whole bunch of tomatoes that manage to grow to at least a half decent size

21:02.240 --> 21:06.320
i know they're green and they're they're not fully grown yet but they're not gonna because

21:06.320 --> 21:11.680
in the next few weeks it is going to be too cold so i will pull off pretty much everything that

21:11.680 --> 21:16.080
can still be eaten there's actually a red one in there i can pull off everything that can still be

21:16.080 --> 21:23.680
eaten there's a few small uh cucumbers over there too and that is it for the 2021 garden that's the

21:23.680 --> 21:29.280
last of it for this year now time to get my girlfriend to do all the hard work of putting

21:29.280 --> 21:40.240
it all away and cleaning it

21:59.280 --> 22:10.240
so
