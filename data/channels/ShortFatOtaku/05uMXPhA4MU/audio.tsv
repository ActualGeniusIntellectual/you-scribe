0	8080	good morning everyone it's time for the garden video 2021 this is early may and i have some
8080	12960	plants here only four right now there'll be more here soon these are spinach by the way and i'm
12960	20640	just gonna use a small dish to give them some water here in the early morning oops
23760	29520	and there we go but the big thing happening at the moment is that we have to go and fix the garden
29600	35760	from last year's damage i don't know if you saw last year's video but uh so there's there's
35760	39760	some stuff that needs to be done so before we put any plants in that'll be the first thing that we
39760	47600	do with the garden this year and here's the state of the garden yeah it's kind of no good eh this
47600	53920	is from when last year naomi broke the door that was here she kicked it in while she was watering
53920	58720	the plants but that's fine so what i have to do is i have some more used doors that are you know
58720	63680	they're no good for inside the house i'm going to use them for this um i'll shovel all this earth
63680	70160	back i'll uh maybe even reuse some of the screws there to attach the new door and then the new
70160	77440	plants come tomorrow so naomi and i will uh will weed plant and water and guess what using the
77440	86960	power of movie magic all i have to do is snap my fingers and it'll be done well it's uh it's a bit
86960	89600	bigger than i would have liked it's a lot taller than the last door
92480	97840	oops but you know what it'll be fine it'll be fine uh but definitely naomi can't go over this
97840	106480	side anymore geez like it's it's like almost up to my waist all right guys the plants are here
106480	112320	look at them look at them that was a little bit yellow but it'll be fine it's time these guys
112320	117120	got to go outside and they got to go outside today so as naomi does all the weeding right
117120	125680	there hi naomi hey guys this all has to also be smoothed out and i'm going to grab all the
125680	132160	compost from the composter back there and shove it in the garden that's going to be a lot of fun
135440	138320	composting is good for the earth but it sure is gross
139200	147840	basically for a good compost you need uh you need greens which are you know vegetables including the
147840	153760	orange carrots but generally just like vegetables and you need browns which are egg cartons and
153760	158800	toilet paper rolls and that'll mix together and give you a good compost so that's the top of it
158800	164080	where it's this is all new stuff oh my god what i just pulled out a clump of dirt that wasn't
164160	171760	didn't have anything attached to it it was just roots yep this stuff at the top here will become
171760	179840	compost in like a year or two it's the stuff at the bottom that's going to be very fully composted
180640	189920	come on come on come on it's you look at that at the bottom there look at that
190720	196720	hold on that's that's all vegetables that have been turned into compost
197680	202400	good stuff dude this giant worm just came crawling out of the compost
205120	210480	when he stretches he's like 10 centimeters long actually no it's more like 20 look at him go
212080	218800	he's actually like beeline towards naomi who has who has the bug phobia there's a lot of
219600	224640	wigglies in here already a lot of wigglies in here that's how you know it's a good compost
225440	228400	is if you get big fat worms who are enjoying life in there
229040	235280	it's a spider it's so many ants i hate this so much it's terrifying so so naomi how do you
235280	239360	feel about like the next mass effect show that we do which will actually be very soon
239360	244880	being all about the rachni oh god i forgot about them can we just skip that part
245200	252880	so as naomi rakes and levels the earth i'm gonna do a few things i've gotta basically repair this
252880	257360	trellis from the winter and clear off of those old cucumber vines they actually stayed there
257360	263440	all winter any more bugs oh there's always bugs i just they're all under the dirt there we go
264320	270720	the garden looks uh done for now we're gonna go put some plants in now we've got this bag of manure
270720	283680	we have to cut open you'll see naomi has to figure it out so i'll just take these uh scissors
284800	290080	from ye old kitchen that naomi's gonna get mad about using on poop yeah what are you doing we
290080	298880	have other scissors and you cut open the bag of manure and there it is there's our manure
300720	304960	no one wants you to film and what we'll do is we'll just like dig a little hole and put the
304960	312320	poop in and then put the plant in the hole and then bury it up and there we go let me show you
312320	319680	how it's done here is how to plant a plant 101 dig down a whole bunch okay and then you take
319680	325280	yourself a handful of poop why aren't you using gloves for the poop take yourself this handful
325280	330960	of poop here it is i'm gonna just put it in the bottom of the hole there's the poop
332400	339280	and you lick your fingers you have your pepper plants right you just kind of pop them out
340960	350000	oh from the bottom yeah okay come on pepper plant i'm losing breaking it jesus pop it out
350000	362400	come on and then you like put it with the poop and you put it like in the ground like so see
362400	367360	and don't cover up the plant obviously and there's your plant hooray and now when the roots go down
367920	375840	and impact that poop it'll take off real quick and everything's in it a little bit dirty but
375840	382640	it's fine it's fine it's just me now Naomi uh saw a big bug and left but we uh we pretty much
382640	388480	finished up anyway she just she's cleaning up the tomatoes are in the back there by the deck
388480	392960	as are the cucumbers the cucumbers are a little bit bunched together but that's okay because
392960	397120	they're gonna they're gonna grow up that trellis and over onto the deck so that's fine peppers
397120	404480	are here same as last year along with the snap peas along the side of the shed here here there's
404480	409760	kale and spinach a row of each and i didn't mind playing them a little bit closer together than
409760	415040	normal because i'll be cutting them regularly so they before they actually start growing in on each
415040	420000	other i'll be snipping them and then eating them it was a hard couple hours work but you know now
420000	429040	that it's done it's it's not that big of a deal you know like that first initial round of work
429040	434560	is pretty tough look at that look at that bug i'm gonna get him ha i soaked him so that first
434560	441680	initial round of um of planting is kind of tough but after you're set you're pretty much set you
441680	447440	just gotta and you just gotta water every day and kind of wait basically as long as you put
447440	452880	that that manure in there you'll be fine good morning guys it's the first week of june about
452880	459280	5 45 in the morning and check it out the spinach is at the point i'm gonna have to harvest it soon
459280	463360	there's actually a few dead leaves there from some frost a couple weeks ago but i can start
463360	469040	cutting this spinach off and eating it um the beans are all going good except for that last
469040	475120	one back there you can see it's bent a bit the uh the frost killed that one one of the cucumbers
475120	479200	died it used to go in red that spot right there that's gone and the rest of them are kind of
479200	484720	wilted um and a few leaves fell off this kale so there's only one leaf left in the kale plant
485440	491120	i don't know if that's going to make it but like aside from those those problems everything is
491120	498400	bright and green and growing yeah man even the basil is pretty good though i might start cutting
498400	504480	that soon too so it's the middle of june and check out how it looks tomatoes coming in nicely
504480	513920	the cucumbers perked right up kale's growing in peppers they always take a while and look at look
513920	519360	at how high some of these beans are climbing man so with the kale you just kind of take your
519360	532480	scissors here like this and go in you snip snip off all the lower leaves and those will be the
532480	544320	ones that you eat and the higher leaves will help stimulate some new growth like so you can
544320	549600	leave about two or three leaves on there leave the smaller ones in the middle all these i'll
549600	553520	freeze them away and i'll eat them over the course of the year and then that's the plant
555120	560480	i'm gonna do that for all of these guys and good morning everyone the garden's looking very good
560480	569520	there's naomi going to get water and the tomatoes are actually taking off quite a bit peppers are
569520	573840	doing okay this is actually the earliest growth we've seen on a lot of these plants in this
573840	580320	location the cucumbers are going there's the spinach now i picked off a bunch of the seeds
580320	584880	of the spinach and the leaves and i'm hoping they'll return because i know with spinach
584880	588720	if you let them go too long they will go to seed which is no good because they stop growing leaves
589360	594560	well i picked all the seed shoots off and i cut all the leaves and it looks like the leaves are
594560	600480	starting to regrow again so maybe we'll get more spinach out of it there's the pea vines they're
600480	608720	going up no peas yet i don't think anyway let's take a closer look maybe some coming in here
611920	618160	the peas are going very well this time this one broke this one broke back at the start of the year
618160	624400	and it's just it's done look at how floppy it is it's done yeah see there's like new shoots coming
624400	628320	out of the spinach with with new leaves and new seeds so we'll get a bit more spinach out of it
628320	634560	these cucumbers contrary to every other cucumber i've had they're growing straight up so i will
634560	641600	have to like move them towards the various bits of mesh that i have here set up can you even reach it
642160	648400	good so i'm going to cut some of this uh this kale because the kale is due from your trim
648960	654320	and i'll see you in a few more weeks so i just pulled two bags of kale out of the garden these
654320	658240	will go into the freezer and we'll eat them over the course of the winter and there's all the kale
658240	664640	plants now that they've been trimmed down they're a lot smaller however Naomi sniffle up a storm
664640	673200	pollen so one thing of note though is that this plant it lost all of its leaves early
673200	678320	and like i didn't cut them they just kind of fell off but there's one leaf left that i've left there
678320	682880	just so it has some way to get sun and it's been growing a bunch of shoots
684000	687120	do you think it's time to cut this leaf off i don't want to kill them i want those shoots to
687120	692480	come in before i cut this thing off well maybe you should wait till it's like more leafy then
692480	698240	yeah once these shoots become leaves like even small leaves like like this one then i'll cut
698240	703120	this giant leaf off hey Naomi does it bother you that i use the kitchen scissors in the garden
703120	713120	i've given up caring it's early july and here's the garden it's it's grown quite a bit so those
713120	718640	tomatoes are just going nuts over there and into a big jungle peppers are doing okay there's a few
718640	722880	coming in you've harvested the kale a few times it's time for another harvest pretty much
724400	733840	the spinach was only so so the peas have taken off all the way up
735840	740400	it'll be on the roof soon there's actually a lot of peas this guy here for example
740400	746720	yeah there's a pea i'm gonna eat it
750160	757120	and it's pretty good the cucumbers are also climbing quite nicely too this is like this
757120	762240	is a better garden than last year so things are looking pretty good out here this morning it's
762320	772480	for one exception this vine has died it it feels very hollow i have no idea why
773200	776240	i got most of the peas off for this tiny one before it died
778080	784640	you can follow it all the way down and at its roots another vine has come up
784640	792080	and that's one of these two so the roots still seem to be good but for some reason this branch
792800	799520	died no idea why but here it is there are a lot of peas now though i'm gonna have to
801360	808240	start taking these off and eating them also look at this that is the first tomato welcome
808240	814400	to august 1st everybody and the garden's going isn't it look at it so let's let's go over it
816000	819680	tomatoes are all coming in there's a bunch of them about this size they'll be
819680	826640	good to pick in a few weeks peppers same thing okay get in there
827600	834480	yeah look at those they'll be good soon too the peas we ate a lot of peas and then they started
834480	840320	dying off um there's still a few coming in here but there's a few we have a few more just made it
840320	848160	too but same problem as last year a bunch of the roots just started dying something is happening
848160	853120	with my peas every year that's causing them to die halfway through the season now i'm still
853120	857120	getting growth and i'm still getting new peas but as you can see a lot of the vines are just not
857120	861920	doing very well the spinach all died so i just pulled them out kale is going very good i've
861920	867760	harvested five or six bags of kale and frozen it and now we have to talk about the cucumbers
867760	874960	because the cucumbers are going crazy look at this guy cucumbers are ready man there's a few
874960	880000	more hanging there this one i think is too big actually oops i didn't see it behind here so the
880000	886320	garden overall is not going as well as it did last year but it's still going very well i'm pretty
886320	890800	happy for that see just a contrast this is a picture of my neighbor's garden and her peas
891520	897680	and as you can see hers are going a lot better than mine um they're a lot more densely packed
897680	901040	they had a lot more peas that were growing in there densely packed you can see them up at the
901040	908480	top there and also even even back in there too and also the roots aren't nearly as uh
910160	918720	as like crinkled and brittle as mine are and additionally her support is a lot less tall than
918720	924320	mine too okay so i was gone for about five days and it rained a bunch during those five days so
924320	933840	this garden has gone completely um unattended and it's going peppers are pretty good tomatoes are
933840	941280	huge um and we have a problem with cucumbers because i was gone so long now they're almost
941280	945920	too big to eat look how big this is oh my god there's two huge ones look how big this is dude
945920	957920	okay well i'll see if we can eat them so here's today's harvest we got seven peppers
959600	964240	uh three cucumbers only two here right now because we ate some and three more bags of
964240	968800	kale to be frozen over the winter now if you're looking at these cucumbers and thinking they're
968800	973600	too big and grow too long um and they'll get they're gonna be woody and full of seeds
973600	978320	it's actually not the case we have a cucumber plant that just produces naturally very long
978320	983520	cucumbers here's the one that we've been eating we had some for lunch today here it is and you
983520	991040	can see even though it's huge it's actually just a regular amount of seed inside so this year my
991040	997840	garden lesson is don't travel so much in the summer because all of those cucumbers got really
997840	1006880	big again these are almost too big to eat even geez but during the perfect time it was to pick
1006880	1014560	them i was i was not around there as well oh my god there's too many the tomatoes are getting
1014560	1019920	really big i'll probably start picking those as soon as they start turning uh turning red
1022160	1027040	peppers also very big too but i'll just wait a little bit longer until they uh they start
1027040	1031200	turning um yellow i guess they go yellow then orange then red eh and it's time for the kale
1031200	1038480	harvest everybody kale and here we are it is the last week of august i don't know if you can tell
1038480	1044000	but it's starting to rain and i actually have some pretty bad allergies right now so i'm going
1044000	1052480	to do this quick um here's the garden a lot of the tomatoes are coming in there are still some
1052480	1060240	more peppers that are growing down there as well the kale is doing okay and the cucumbers are
1060240	1065920	pretty much done but there's like five good cucumbers that need to be harvested the peas
1065920	1072000	of course are over we ate a lot of peas this year but they're done at this point i'm going to pull
1072000	1077040	a lot of the red tomatoes off and then we'll probably uh figure out what to do with them
1077040	1081920	maybe make sauce maybe make salsa and i have too many cucumbers i can't eat them fast enough
1082480	1089040	but i'm sure it'll be okay what is this this is a giant weed
1092480	1096560	yeah right here it's just it's not even part of the tomato it's just a giant
1097200	1099440	weed i didn't even notice it
1103120	1104240	oh my god
1104240	1109600	hold on i'm trying to
1116000	1117040	that's actually really big
1120400	1125360	i didn't even notice it this whole time so because there's still at least two to three more weeks of
1125360	1130560	decent weather left i didn't pull everything off these cucumbers are a bit yellow i think
1130560	1135600	i might have left them on there too long so i guess we'll we'll eat them and see how they are
1135600	1139680	here's all the tomatoes that had to come off there's maybe four times the amount still on
1139680	1144000	the bushes that are still kind of green so we'll give it a few more weeks for it to pull the garden
1144000	1149600	out and i also brought the basil plant upstairs it's time to to pull the leaves off this as well
1150480	1156480	the only thing is i still don't know how to make dried basil i don't really have access to like a
1156480	1164000	dry basement or anything so i don't know all right it is september 2nd and uh i'm quite sick
1164000	1170720	right now but i'm doing this anyway because the uh the growing season here in ontario is pretty
1170720	1175360	much over a lot of those tomatoes are good to go but a lot of them aren't a lot see there's still
1175360	1182000	a pretty big green one right there but basically it's time to pull everything off let them ripen
1182000	1186160	up in the house there's a few more cucumbers over there they got to be harvested the cucumbers did
1186160	1192320	not grow as well as last year's the tomatoes are about on par the peppers are about on par so i
1192320	1197840	guess i'll collect them all and we'll see what we have so here's a big pile of red tomatoes and i'm
1197840	1204240	going to gamble with the ones that i left on the vine like this one for example or this one maybe
1204240	1211120	they'll keep growing the problem is that yeah and these guys here they're still pretty small
1212080	1215440	the problem is we're getting into the part of the uh of the canadian
1216000	1222160	summer and fall where we sometimes get freak frost early in the year and if we do these will
1222160	1226320	all be gone but it might be worth a gamble just to leave them up for a couple weeks
1226960	1232640	and see if we get anything else out of it so just like last year basically as soon as we hit
1232640	1237280	september i kind of let the garden go things really weren't growing anymore and we had some
1237280	1241920	early frost so basically the idea was i'm not going to water it i'm not going to invest any
1241920	1248000	more time in it but whatever i happen to get out of it i will take down before it's all finally
1248000	1251920	dead so for example there's some pretty big peppers here you see like that one right there
1252480	1257600	and there's a few new like pepper flowers that probably aren't going to go anywhere
1257600	1262240	there's still a whole bunch of tomatoes that manage to grow to at least a half decent size
1262240	1266320	i know they're green and they're they're not fully grown yet but they're not gonna because
1266320	1271680	in the next few weeks it is going to be too cold so i will pull off pretty much everything that
1271680	1276080	can still be eaten there's actually a red one in there i can pull off everything that can still be
1276080	1283680	eaten there's a few small uh cucumbers over there too and that is it for the 2021 garden that's the
1283680	1289280	last of it for this year now time to get my girlfriend to do all the hard work of putting
1289280	1300240	it all away and cleaning it
1319280	1330240	so
