0	3680	Eat the rich! Eat the rich! Oh my god guys we have to eat the rich!
3680	9040	This is a ridiculously prolific saying. We don't need a handful of people doing zero waste
9040	14160	perfectly. We need millions of people eating the rich. I have a feeling that this was supposed to
14160	19520	be a climate change thing and it was co-opted to be eat the rich. The font's not quite right
19520	25120	here but still it is definitely how they feel. If there's one thing the left gets consistently right
25120	29120	it's that there are elements of the rich that actually hate the poor. They actually view
29120	34240	their accumulation of wealth as a signal that they are worthy to run the entirety of society
34240	39680	and the world. And they absolutely equate populist objections to their ideas as extremist
39680	44080	attacks against them. And if it's against them well then it's against all of society isn't it?
44080	48560	That is how these people think. That's why you get such bizarre headlines as this.
48560	55520	Charles Koch teams up with George Soros, Patreon, and Airbnb to fight online extremism. Because it
55520	59440	doesn't matter if you're on the extreme left like George Soros or the extreme right like the
59440	63760	Koch brothers. The rich have a grand vision for society and they're not going to let something
63760	68960	as pesky as the working class get in the way. This article by the way talks about the after
68960	73760	Charlottesville project and it's basically the headline billionaire philanthropists teaming up
73760	78960	with big tech in order to censor what they subjectively view as extremist content on the
78960	83680	internet. But it's not just that. All the shady stuff that the left thinks the stereotypical fat
83680	89040	cat does probably actually happens. Funneling money into offshore accounts? Absolutely.
89040	94480	Exploiting third world labor to drive down costs and bending over backwards to authoritarian regimes
94480	99280	while doing so? Absolutely. You must have all heard about this right? Apple, Samsung, and Sony
99280	105760	among 83 global brands using Uyghur Muslim forced labor in factories. This is a case of multinational
105760	110160	corporations actually using slavery and we can definitely call it slavery. Uyghur Muslims are
110160	114480	currently being genocided by China. What they do is they arrest them on a trumped up charge.
114480	119200	The charge usually being something like being too Muslim or not being communist enough. Some BS like
119200	124320	that. Resisting cynicism maybe. And then once they're in the prison system they're put to work.
124320	128880	So everyone seems to be okay with forced labor since they're technically criminals even though
128880	134080	they haven't done anything wrong. Here's the list of all 83 companies currently exploiting Uyghur
134080	136080	slave labor in China.
164080	173680	Heart, Schaffner, Marx, Hisense, Hitachi, HP, HTC, Huawei, iFlyTech, Jack & Jones, Jaguar, Japan Display,
173680	183120	L.L.Bean, Lacoste, Land Rover, Lenovo, LG, Li Ning, Marks & Spencer, Mayor, Mizzou, Mercedes-Benz, MG,
183120	191440	Microsoft, Mitsubishi, Mitsumi, Nike, Nintendo, Nokia, The North Face, Oculus, Oppo, Panasonic,
191440	200080	Polo Ralph Lauren, Puma, Roe, Psych Motor? Is this related to bike motor? Samsung, S.G.M.W, Sharp,
200080	208400	Siemens, Skechers, Sony, TDK, Tommy Hilfiger, Toshiba, Tsinghua Tongfang, Uniqlo, Victoria's Secret,
208400	215040	Vivo, Volkswagen, Xiaomi, Zara, Zenga, and ZTE. So whenever the right wing of politics says that
215040	219280	there's nothing wrong with the uber rich I don't want to hear it. Everyone is capable of absolute
219360	224320	evil, and that includes people with money. And the CEOs of each and every single one of these
224320	229120	companies is currently profiting off of slavery. So I get it when some people say eat the rich,
229120	235280	but at the same time I do have to say, uh, hashtag not all rich people? Pewdiepie exposed an entire
235280	240560	generation to anti-semitism and racism, and he's a multi-millionaire. Sorry if I don't cry when he
240560	244800	gets robbed. I can't believe this is a controversy on the left. How exactly do you think the
244800	248720	revolution is going to go down? We ask them nicely? And here's the fundamental problem with
248720	253280	the left's view on this topic. Pewdiepie is a multi-millionaire. However from what I've seen
253280	257360	he definitely takes care to make sure he's not exploiting anybody. All this merch isn't made in
257360	262480	a Chinese sweatshop somewhere, it's made in Canada by a company that actually pays their workers a
262480	267360	fair wage. And then you get people who go mask off this hard. This is over somebody protesting
267360	272560	booty judge by promoting his hanging. Jesus. Can you let me know why there's a screenshot
272560	276400	floating around of you promoting the hang of the first major LGBTQ candidate for president?
277040	281680	Please tell me this is fake, because if it's not that's going to be an issue. The DNC would truly
281680	287520	need to get involved. If it's not true please advise now. One, I'm gay so okay. Two, I didn't
287520	291760	threaten him. I said he deserves the same as billionaires. You're gay so you can promote the
291760	296240	hanging of gay people? That doesn't make any sense. I'm so upset that this is true. To promote
296240	300080	the hanging of those you disagree with is just wrong on so many levels. I'll be contacting the
300080	304480	Texas Democrats, this is unacceptable. Only billionaires and those who serve them. I never
304480	309840	said anything actionable so whatever. I think Pete is a ladder climbing sociopath. I couldn't
309840	314080	give a fuck if he's gay. He's a shitty self-serving asshole who works for billionaires.
314640	318480	That's your opinion. One of you advocates the hanging of political enemies, the other debates
318480	323040	them. Seems to me he's not the sociopath between the two of you. Anyways, I'll leave you alone.
323040	327520	Wouldn't want you to be late to that lynching you have planned later. Frankly, I prefer guillotines
327520	332160	anyway. I'm sure you do. These are the radicals that the left has courted over the past decade or
332160	336640	so, and they're finally beginning to reap what they've sown. Simply being rich is enough to get
336640	340720	you on their hit list, even if you actually got that money fair and square. Of course,
340720	344640	their counterargument will always be that there is no ethical way to get rich. And whenever you
344640	349680	ask them to explain that, they fundamentally fall back on the idea that all employment is inherently
349680	354160	exploitative, because the worker has no choice. He needs the money so that he doesn't starve.
354160	358800	So even though he's consenting to work there, and he's agreeing to exchange his labor for money,
358800	363360	because he's being coerced into it by the threat of starvation or loss of shelter if he doesn't
363360	368400	work, then it's not a real choice. And maybe it's just me. But this sounds like very similar logic
368400	373040	to what those lesbian incels like to say about straight women having sex with straight men.
373040	377120	That the woman's consent isn't actually real because men hold all the institutional power.
377120	381840	In any case, the fundamental flaw with their argument is that it's not a function of capitalism
381840	387200	that people need food and shelter. It's a function of reality. Even if you lived in the communist
387200	391360	utopia, somebody somewhere would have to labor to create your food and your shelter.
391360	396240	Capitalism simply says it might as well be you who does it, since you're responsible for yourself.
396240	400640	This complete lack of understanding has created a group of people that are basically like this
400640	405520	person here. If I can't even afford ramen, I'll eat the rich. A packet of ramen is what,
405520	410560	50 cents or something? Meanwhile, she's spent probably $200 or so on these boots.
410560	415280	And where is she? Looks like a university? How much did that cost to attend? How about
415280	418960	the rest of your clothes? Was that expensive? That's a pretty good looking backpack there.
419600	424400	And wait, are those car keys? I don't think this woman's been poor a day in her life.
424400	428560	And that is the fundamental rule here. Whenever somebody on the radical left says,
428560	433920	eat the rich, what they define as the rich is anyone who has more money than them. And they
433920	438160	want to eat them not because they're starving, but because they're jealous of their success.
438160	442640	I mean, what does your average university professor make? Sometimes six figures a year,
442640	447520	definitely at least five. Probably pretty high up there in the five as well. That's like solidly
447520	452160	middle class. And yet they're the ones who are indoctrinating year after year of students into
452160	458080	bougie communists. And why? I know there's that banned video from Yuri whatever his name is from
458080	462480	the KGB. It was taken down off YouTube stupidly a little while ago, where he basically admitted
462480	465760	that the Russians had infiltrated the West's academic sphere, and they were going to use
465760	470160	the universities to spread communism. Theory checks out. But I'm not sure if it's that.
470160	474720	I bet if you added a zero to the end of the salary of every single arts and humanities
474720	479680	university professor, all of this eat the rich nonsense would stop because we're talking about
479680	484800	extremely intelligent people who were led to believe that their intelligence would open doors
484800	489120	for them in life. And to some extent it did. But you can't just be intelligent to be in the 1%.
489120	493600	You have to be intelligent and hardworking. And a bunch of people who skipped over higher education
493600	498000	and who became entrepreneurs and who built their own businesses and became rich that way.
498000	501920	I could definitely see a lot of these ivory tower grifters being really resentful about
501920	504880	their success. In any case, when you're talking about eating the rich,
504880	508640	the rich is whoever's richer than you. Let's take that to its logical conclusion.
508640	514000	Mark Ruffalo, the million dollar actor. It's time for an economic revolution.
514000	517920	Capitalism today is failing us, killing us and robbing from our children's future.
518960	523680	Oh, holy dude, you do realize that you are going to be the one who gets guillotined, right?
523680	529440	Like you are the 1%? The Young Turks' progressive founder urged his staff not to unionize.
529440	534240	At a tense meeting with employees, Cenk Uygur argued that a union doesn't belong at a small
534240	537920	news network struggling to make profits. I thought you were the biggest independent news network,
537920	541600	dude. What do you mean small network? The best passage in the article is this one.
541600	545600	Uygur said he was caught off guard by the union effort that appeared on Twitter the day of the
545600	549600	meeting, and that it was so early in the process he wasn't sure if it was real that he was being
549600	553680	punked. He acknowledged that he threw papers in the meeting, in a downward direction,
553680	558320	not towards anyone, and that he reprimanded an employee whom he believed to be smiling.
558320	562480	According to staffers, Uygur said it would be funny later. An anonymous statement they
562480	565600	found unsettling. He told HuffPost it wasn't meant to be a threat.
565600	569680	The person smiling seemed to be openly mocking the idea that the company might not survive
569680	574880	after 18 years. And we put all this blood, sweat, and tears into it. I don't find the
574880	578800	idea of us going down funny. Well, that's the difference between a worker and an entrepreneur,
578800	582400	isn't it? Somebody who owns a business and somebody who's just punching time.
582400	588080	They don't care about your dream, Chenk. This is why business owners always object to the idea of
588080	592560	the collective ownership of their business, the collectivization of the means of production.
592560	596560	It's because some people just don't give a shit. They will destroy your business,
596560	599920	destroy your livelihood, and then go get a job somewhere else. They don't care.
599920	603200	They haven't put into it what you've put into it. They weren't there like you were,
603200	606880	working all by yourself trying to make the thing get off the ground. They don't give a shit.
606880	611200	Why should some socialist government force you to co-own with them? They're obviously not on your
611200	616320	level. But this is the environment that the left has made for themselves. Chenk Uygur doesn't view
616320	620480	himself as one of the rich that needs to be eaten, but his employees certainly view him that way.
620480	624160	And they're all too happy to destroy the Young Turks in the name of social justice.
624160	628640	And speaking of governments forcing businesses to be co-ops, remember when Vosch the brainlet
628640	633120	in his debate with Sargon said that that's exactly what should happen? That businesses should be
633120	637280	forced to be co-ops because they're more just, they're more moral, they're more productive,
637280	641360	they're better for everyone? Well, let's listen to Vosch talk about why
641360	648240	his business shouldn't be a co-op. So you are a monopolist owner of a means of production called
648240	652480	the Vosch channel. I had to look through your channel. Again, it's not a gotcha thing. I'm
652480	658320	genuinely curious. And you seem to be the host of every show. And so I'm kind of curious why the
658320	662080	people who work with you don't get to host your show. In other words, why don't you take your
662080	668560	channel and do what you suggest is the best thing to do? Have other people host your channel, share
668560	673120	your profits with them, get them involved rather than paying them in this cold, dry calculations
673120	678400	of mutual utility stuff. Why don't you put your theories into practice?
678400	685840	Yeah, I do think there are reasonable thresholds of worker participation behind which it's not
685840	691120	reasonably expected that you should adopt a cooperative model. For my case, an example,
691120	695520	I probably do about 95% of the work to keep the channel afloat.
695520	697680	But you wouldn't if you let other people host, right?
698240	702960	Well, that is true. I could spread the work around more. But the main reason why I think
702960	709600	the co-op model is essential and, you know, broadly speaking, is because it is a solution
709600	716080	to this very particular type of wage exploitation that we see in the traditionally run firm.
716080	719120	And I'm sorry, but that's what you were talking about with the people you pay.
719120	722160	Why don't you invite them in to collectively own
722160	726000	your channel rather than pay them if the wage paying is exploitive?
726560	733840	Because I do not think that the exploitation model is descriptive when we're talking about
733840	740960	people who aren't expected to supply consistent wage labor to whatever firm it is they participate
740960	745440	in. So just because a person, for example, like I might shoot them a message on Discord,
745440	749360	like once or twice a month or something, it'd be like, hey, can you cut down this video from
749360	753280	the DNC debates? I'll give you two hundred or three hundred dollars just because they have
753280	758320	that level of engagement. Well, I do agree there is a fundamental level of inequality
758320	764400	in the relationship between us in that bargaining system. I don't believe that type of exploitation
764400	768720	is one which should be ameliorated with a worker owned collective. Now, I will say.
768720	771600	Wait, so it's for other people, not for you, right?
771600	776880	Well, no, I mean, I hardly think the way I run my channel is in any way comparable to like a
776880	781520	business. His fundamental argument here is that I'm not rich enough. It wouldn't work for me.
781520	786000	I'm not the rich you should be eating. And then, of course, there's Bernie Sanders saying
786000	791680	millionaires a lot less often. In 2016, he was all about taking on the millionaires and billionaires.
791680	794240	This time around, though, he only talks about the billionaires.
794640	804480	Oh, Sanders himself became a millionaire in 2016 as he vaulted into the national consciousness.
804480	807520	Book deals drove more money into his pockets. I see.
815440	820080	I wrote a best selling book. If you write a best selling book, you can be a millionaire, too.
820160	824480	With those words, Bernie Sanders acknowledged on Tuesday that he has joined the ranks of
824480	827920	the millionaires and billionaires he has vilified for most of his career.
827920	831440	It's just that simple, isn't it? Hey, all you poor people out there,
831440	835280	all you people saying eat the rich, just write a book. You can be a millionaire. It's OK.
835280	840160	Bernie Sanders says so. What's going on here is that it becomes harder and harder to advocate
840160	844560	for socialism, for high taxation, for the redistribution of wealth, for collective
844560	848720	ownership of the means of production, any of this nonsense. It becomes harder to advocate for it,
848720	852640	the richer you get, because the richer you get, the more work that you've put in.
852640	856400	And as soon as you start putting in work, one, you don't want the rewards of that work taken
856400	861520	away from you by the state. And two, you start to care a whole lot more where your tax dollars go.
861520	865840	But people at the bottom, a lot of them just don't care. They don't give a shit. It's Obama
865840	870560	phones to them, man. It's the government giving them stuff. Now, this isn't universal. Obviously,
870560	875040	there are some poor people out there who just can't catch a break. And not only would their
875040	879280	lives be better if they had some kind of assistance program to lift them out of poverty,
879280	882640	but they would make the lives of those around them better as well through their own work.
882640	886960	If they were just given a chance, those people exist. But we can't pretend that's everyone at
886960	890160	the bottom. And in much the same way, we can't pretend that everyone at the top, they're all
890160	895360	just saints as well. People who started businesses solely to create jobs and make the world a better
895360	900080	place. No, they can be just as evil and exploitative as everyone else. In much the same way,
900080	904800	the working class is not this group of completely pure hearted people. And this whole eat the
904800	908800	rich thing, it really does just boil down to people being jealous of those more successful
908800	913600	than they are. There may be good reasons to hate what some people do with all of their wealth,
913600	918880	but there is absolutely no reason to believe that if that wealth were redistributed and given to
918880	924480	those in the bottom rungs of society, that they wouldn't do the exact same thing if they could.
924480	932080	Nonetheless, the attitude to eat the rich still persists. So who are the rich anyway? And I don't
932080	937200	mean somebody who makes more money than you. Who are the actual rich? Are you in the world's top
937200	945680	1%? A $32,400 annual income will easily place American school teachers, registered nurses,
945680	952160	and other modestly salaried individuals among the global 1% of earners. What these activists claim
952160	958080	to be working class or lower middle class or whatever, they are the rich. There are of course
958080	962720	people much richer than that. There are the hyper rich. There are the 1% of the 1% of the 1%.
963280	968160	But the entire rest of the world is looking at the West with envy, including all of those rich kids
968160	972800	who are too dumb to understand that they're calling for their own heads. Should there ever
972800	977280	actually be any kind of worldwide communist revolution? And let's be honest, there's never
977280	981840	going to be. But let's say that there was one. And let's say that it stuck to the values of communism.
982400	987920	Every single person who has said eat the rich is going to find themselves on a chopping block.
987920	993920	And the only thing standing between privileged Marxist college kids and the abyss is capitalism.
994720	995920	You're welcome.
