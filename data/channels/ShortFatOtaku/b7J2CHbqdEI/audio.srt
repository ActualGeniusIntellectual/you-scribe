1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,680
Eat the rich! Eat the rich! Oh my god guys we have to eat the rich!

2
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:09,040
This is a ridiculously prolific saying. We don't need a handful of people doing zero waste

3
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:14,160
perfectly. We need millions of people eating the rich. I have a feeling that this was supposed to

4
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:19,520
be a climate change thing and it was co-opted to be eat the rich. The font's not quite right

5
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:25,120
here but still it is definitely how they feel. If there's one thing the left gets consistently right

6
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:29,120
it's that there are elements of the rich that actually hate the poor. They actually view

7
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:34,240
their accumulation of wealth as a signal that they are worthy to run the entirety of society

8
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:39,680
and the world. And they absolutely equate populist objections to their ideas as extremist

9
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:44,080
attacks against them. And if it's against them well then it's against all of society isn't it?

10
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:48,560
That is how these people think. That's why you get such bizarre headlines as this.

11
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:55,520
Charles Koch teams up with George Soros, Patreon, and Airbnb to fight online extremism. Because it

12
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:59,440
doesn't matter if you're on the extreme left like George Soros or the extreme right like the

13
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:03,760
Koch brothers. The rich have a grand vision for society and they're not going to let something

14
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:08,960
as pesky as the working class get in the way. This article by the way talks about the after

15
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:13,760
Charlottesville project and it's basically the headline billionaire philanthropists teaming up

16
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:18,960
with big tech in order to censor what they subjectively view as extremist content on the

17
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:23,680
internet. But it's not just that. All the shady stuff that the left thinks the stereotypical fat

18
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:29,040
cat does probably actually happens. Funneling money into offshore accounts? Absolutely.

19
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:34,480
Exploiting third world labor to drive down costs and bending over backwards to authoritarian regimes

20
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:39,280
while doing so? Absolutely. You must have all heard about this right? Apple, Samsung, and Sony

21
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:45,760
among 83 global brands using Uyghur Muslim forced labor in factories. This is a case of multinational

22
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:50,160
corporations actually using slavery and we can definitely call it slavery. Uyghur Muslims are

23
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:54,480
currently being genocided by China. What they do is they arrest them on a trumped up charge.

24
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:59,200
The charge usually being something like being too Muslim or not being communist enough. Some BS like

25
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:04,320
that. Resisting cynicism maybe. And then once they're in the prison system they're put to work.

26
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:08,880
So everyone seems to be okay with forced labor since they're technically criminals even though

27
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:14,080
they haven't done anything wrong. Here's the list of all 83 companies currently exploiting Uyghur

28
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,080
slave labor in China.

29
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:53,680
Heart, Schaffner, Marx, Hisense, Hitachi, HP, HTC, Huawei, iFlyTech, Jack & Jones, Jaguar, Japan Display,

30
00:02:53,680 --> 00:03:03,120
L.L.Bean, Lacoste, Land Rover, Lenovo, LG, Li Ning, Marks & Spencer, Mayor, Mizzou, Mercedes-Benz, MG,

31
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:11,440
Microsoft, Mitsubishi, Mitsumi, Nike, Nintendo, Nokia, The North Face, Oculus, Oppo, Panasonic,

32
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:20,080
Polo Ralph Lauren, Puma, Roe, Psych Motor? Is this related to bike motor? Samsung, S.G.M.W, Sharp,

33
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:28,400
Siemens, Skechers, Sony, TDK, Tommy Hilfiger, Toshiba, Tsinghua Tongfang, Uniqlo, Victoria's Secret,

34
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:35,040
Vivo, Volkswagen, Xiaomi, Zara, Zenga, and ZTE. So whenever the right wing of politics says that

35
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:39,280
there's nothing wrong with the uber rich I don't want to hear it. Everyone is capable of absolute

36
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:44,320
evil, and that includes people with money. And the CEOs of each and every single one of these

37
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:49,120
companies is currently profiting off of slavery. So I get it when some people say eat the rich,

38
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:55,280
but at the same time I do have to say, uh, hashtag not all rich people? Pewdiepie exposed an entire

39
00:03:55,280 --> 00:04:00,560
generation to anti-semitism and racism, and he's a multi-millionaire. Sorry if I don't cry when he

40
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:04,800
gets robbed. I can't believe this is a controversy on the left. How exactly do you think the

41
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:08,720
revolution is going to go down? We ask them nicely? And here's the fundamental problem with

42
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:13,280
the left's view on this topic. Pewdiepie is a multi-millionaire. However from what I've seen

43
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:17,360
he definitely takes care to make sure he's not exploiting anybody. All this merch isn't made in

44
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:22,480
a Chinese sweatshop somewhere, it's made in Canada by a company that actually pays their workers a

45
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:27,360
fair wage. And then you get people who go mask off this hard. This is over somebody protesting

46
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:32,560
booty judge by promoting his hanging. Jesus. Can you let me know why there's a screenshot

47
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:36,400
floating around of you promoting the hang of the first major LGBTQ candidate for president?

48
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:41,680
Please tell me this is fake, because if it's not that's going to be an issue. The DNC would truly

49
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:47,520
need to get involved. If it's not true please advise now. One, I'm gay so okay. Two, I didn't

50
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:51,760
threaten him. I said he deserves the same as billionaires. You're gay so you can promote the

51
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:56,240
hanging of gay people? That doesn't make any sense. I'm so upset that this is true. To promote

52
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:00,080
the hanging of those you disagree with is just wrong on so many levels. I'll be contacting the

53
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:04,480
Texas Democrats, this is unacceptable. Only billionaires and those who serve them. I never

54
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:09,840
said anything actionable so whatever. I think Pete is a ladder climbing sociopath. I couldn't

55
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:14,080
give a fuck if he's gay. He's a shitty self-serving asshole who works for billionaires.

56
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:18,480
That's your opinion. One of you advocates the hanging of political enemies, the other debates

57
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:23,040
them. Seems to me he's not the sociopath between the two of you. Anyways, I'll leave you alone.

58
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:27,520
Wouldn't want you to be late to that lynching you have planned later. Frankly, I prefer guillotines

59
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:32,160
anyway. I'm sure you do. These are the radicals that the left has courted over the past decade or

60
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:36,640
so, and they're finally beginning to reap what they've sown. Simply being rich is enough to get

61
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:40,720
you on their hit list, even if you actually got that money fair and square. Of course,

62
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:44,640
their counterargument will always be that there is no ethical way to get rich. And whenever you

63
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:49,680
ask them to explain that, they fundamentally fall back on the idea that all employment is inherently

64
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:54,160
exploitative, because the worker has no choice. He needs the money so that he doesn't starve.

65
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:58,800
So even though he's consenting to work there, and he's agreeing to exchange his labor for money,

66
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:03,360
because he's being coerced into it by the threat of starvation or loss of shelter if he doesn't

67
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:08,400
work, then it's not a real choice. And maybe it's just me. But this sounds like very similar logic

68
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:13,040
to what those lesbian incels like to say about straight women having sex with straight men.

69
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:17,120
That the woman's consent isn't actually real because men hold all the institutional power.

70
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:21,840
In any case, the fundamental flaw with their argument is that it's not a function of capitalism

71
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:27,200
that people need food and shelter. It's a function of reality. Even if you lived in the communist

72
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:31,360
utopia, somebody somewhere would have to labor to create your food and your shelter.

73
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:36,240
Capitalism simply says it might as well be you who does it, since you're responsible for yourself.

74
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:40,640
This complete lack of understanding has created a group of people that are basically like this

75
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:45,520
person here. If I can't even afford ramen, I'll eat the rich. A packet of ramen is what,

76
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:50,560
50 cents or something? Meanwhile, she's spent probably $200 or so on these boots.

77
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:55,280
And where is she? Looks like a university? How much did that cost to attend? How about

78
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:58,960
the rest of your clothes? Was that expensive? That's a pretty good looking backpack there.

79
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:04,400
And wait, are those car keys? I don't think this woman's been poor a day in her life.

80
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:08,560
And that is the fundamental rule here. Whenever somebody on the radical left says,

81
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:13,920
eat the rich, what they define as the rich is anyone who has more money than them. And they

82
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:18,160
want to eat them not because they're starving, but because they're jealous of their success.

83
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:22,640
I mean, what does your average university professor make? Sometimes six figures a year,

84
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:27,520
definitely at least five. Probably pretty high up there in the five as well. That's like solidly

85
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:32,160
middle class. And yet they're the ones who are indoctrinating year after year of students into

86
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:38,080
bougie communists. And why? I know there's that banned video from Yuri whatever his name is from

87
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:42,480
the KGB. It was taken down off YouTube stupidly a little while ago, where he basically admitted

88
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:45,760
that the Russians had infiltrated the West's academic sphere, and they were going to use

89
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:50,160
the universities to spread communism. Theory checks out. But I'm not sure if it's that.

90
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:54,720
I bet if you added a zero to the end of the salary of every single arts and humanities

91
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:59,680
university professor, all of this eat the rich nonsense would stop because we're talking about

92
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:04,800
extremely intelligent people who were led to believe that their intelligence would open doors

93
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:09,120
for them in life. And to some extent it did. But you can't just be intelligent to be in the 1%.

94
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:13,600
You have to be intelligent and hardworking. And a bunch of people who skipped over higher education

95
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:18,000
and who became entrepreneurs and who built their own businesses and became rich that way.

96
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,920
I could definitely see a lot of these ivory tower grifters being really resentful about

97
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:24,880
their success. In any case, when you're talking about eating the rich,

98
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:28,640
the rich is whoever's richer than you. Let's take that to its logical conclusion.

99
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:34,000
Mark Ruffalo, the million dollar actor. It's time for an economic revolution.

100
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,920
Capitalism today is failing us, killing us and robbing from our children's future.

101
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:43,680
Oh, holy dude, you do realize that you are going to be the one who gets guillotined, right?

102
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:49,440
Like you are the 1%? The Young Turks' progressive founder urged his staff not to unionize.

103
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:54,240
At a tense meeting with employees, Cenk Uygur argued that a union doesn't belong at a small

104
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:57,920
news network struggling to make profits. I thought you were the biggest independent news network,

105
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:01,600
dude. What do you mean small network? The best passage in the article is this one.

106
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:05,600
Uygur said he was caught off guard by the union effort that appeared on Twitter the day of the

107
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:09,600
meeting, and that it was so early in the process he wasn't sure if it was real that he was being

108
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:13,680
punked. He acknowledged that he threw papers in the meeting, in a downward direction,

109
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:18,320
not towards anyone, and that he reprimanded an employee whom he believed to be smiling.

110
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:22,480
According to staffers, Uygur said it would be funny later. An anonymous statement they

111
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:25,600
found unsettling. He told HuffPost it wasn't meant to be a threat.

112
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:29,680
The person smiling seemed to be openly mocking the idea that the company might not survive

113
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:34,880
after 18 years. And we put all this blood, sweat, and tears into it. I don't find the

114
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:38,800
idea of us going down funny. Well, that's the difference between a worker and an entrepreneur,

115
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:42,400
isn't it? Somebody who owns a business and somebody who's just punching time.

116
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:48,080
They don't care about your dream, Chenk. This is why business owners always object to the idea of

117
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:52,560
the collective ownership of their business, the collectivization of the means of production.

118
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:56,560
It's because some people just don't give a shit. They will destroy your business,

119
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:59,920
destroy your livelihood, and then go get a job somewhere else. They don't care.

120
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:03,200
They haven't put into it what you've put into it. They weren't there like you were,

121
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:06,880
working all by yourself trying to make the thing get off the ground. They don't give a shit.

122
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:11,200
Why should some socialist government force you to co-own with them? They're obviously not on your

123
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:16,320
level. But this is the environment that the left has made for themselves. Chenk Uygur doesn't view

124
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:20,480
himself as one of the rich that needs to be eaten, but his employees certainly view him that way.

125
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:24,160
And they're all too happy to destroy the Young Turks in the name of social justice.

126
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:28,640
And speaking of governments forcing businesses to be co-ops, remember when Vosch the brainlet

127
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:33,120
in his debate with Sargon said that that's exactly what should happen? That businesses should be

128
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:37,280
forced to be co-ops because they're more just, they're more moral, they're more productive,

129
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:41,360
they're better for everyone? Well, let's listen to Vosch talk about why

130
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:48,240
his business shouldn't be a co-op. So you are a monopolist owner of a means of production called

131
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:52,480
the Vosch channel. I had to look through your channel. Again, it's not a gotcha thing. I'm

132
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:58,320
genuinely curious. And you seem to be the host of every show. And so I'm kind of curious why the

133
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:02,080
people who work with you don't get to host your show. In other words, why don't you take your

134
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:08,560
channel and do what you suggest is the best thing to do? Have other people host your channel, share

135
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:13,120
your profits with them, get them involved rather than paying them in this cold, dry calculations

136
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:18,400
of mutual utility stuff. Why don't you put your theories into practice?

137
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:25,840
Yeah, I do think there are reasonable thresholds of worker participation behind which it's not

138
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:31,120
reasonably expected that you should adopt a cooperative model. For my case, an example,

139
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:35,520
I probably do about 95% of the work to keep the channel afloat.

140
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:37,680
But you wouldn't if you let other people host, right?

141
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:42,960
Well, that is true. I could spread the work around more. But the main reason why I think

142
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:49,600
the co-op model is essential and, you know, broadly speaking, is because it is a solution

143
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:56,080
to this very particular type of wage exploitation that we see in the traditionally run firm.

144
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:59,120
And I'm sorry, but that's what you were talking about with the people you pay.

145
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:02,160
Why don't you invite them in to collectively own

146
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:06,000
your channel rather than pay them if the wage paying is exploitive?

147
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:13,840
Because I do not think that the exploitation model is descriptive when we're talking about

148
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:20,960
people who aren't expected to supply consistent wage labor to whatever firm it is they participate

149
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:25,440
in. So just because a person, for example, like I might shoot them a message on Discord,

150
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:29,360
like once or twice a month or something, it'd be like, hey, can you cut down this video from

151
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:33,280
the DNC debates? I'll give you two hundred or three hundred dollars just because they have

152
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:38,320
that level of engagement. Well, I do agree there is a fundamental level of inequality

153
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:44,400
in the relationship between us in that bargaining system. I don't believe that type of exploitation

154
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:48,720
is one which should be ameliorated with a worker owned collective. Now, I will say.

155
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:51,600
Wait, so it's for other people, not for you, right?

156
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:56,880
Well, no, I mean, I hardly think the way I run my channel is in any way comparable to like a

157
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:01,520
business. His fundamental argument here is that I'm not rich enough. It wouldn't work for me.

158
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:06,000
I'm not the rich you should be eating. And then, of course, there's Bernie Sanders saying

159
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:11,680
millionaires a lot less often. In 2016, he was all about taking on the millionaires and billionaires.

160
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:14,240
This time around, though, he only talks about the billionaires.

161
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:24,480
Oh, Sanders himself became a millionaire in 2016 as he vaulted into the national consciousness.

162
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:27,520
Book deals drove more money into his pockets. I see.

163
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:40,080
I wrote a best selling book. If you write a best selling book, you can be a millionaire, too.

164
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:44,480
With those words, Bernie Sanders acknowledged on Tuesday that he has joined the ranks of

165
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:47,920
the millionaires and billionaires he has vilified for most of his career.

166
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:51,440
It's just that simple, isn't it? Hey, all you poor people out there,

167
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:55,280
all you people saying eat the rich, just write a book. You can be a millionaire. It's OK.

168
00:13:55,280 --> 00:14:00,160
Bernie Sanders says so. What's going on here is that it becomes harder and harder to advocate

169
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:04,560
for socialism, for high taxation, for the redistribution of wealth, for collective

170
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:08,720
ownership of the means of production, any of this nonsense. It becomes harder to advocate for it,

171
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:12,640
the richer you get, because the richer you get, the more work that you've put in.

172
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:16,400
And as soon as you start putting in work, one, you don't want the rewards of that work taken

173
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:21,520
away from you by the state. And two, you start to care a whole lot more where your tax dollars go.

174
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:25,840
But people at the bottom, a lot of them just don't care. They don't give a shit. It's Obama

175
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:30,560
phones to them, man. It's the government giving them stuff. Now, this isn't universal. Obviously,

176
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:35,040
there are some poor people out there who just can't catch a break. And not only would their

177
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:39,280
lives be better if they had some kind of assistance program to lift them out of poverty,

178
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:42,640
but they would make the lives of those around them better as well through their own work.

179
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:46,960
If they were just given a chance, those people exist. But we can't pretend that's everyone at

180
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:50,160
the bottom. And in much the same way, we can't pretend that everyone at the top, they're all

181
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:55,360
just saints as well. People who started businesses solely to create jobs and make the world a better

182
00:14:55,360 --> 00:15:00,080
place. No, they can be just as evil and exploitative as everyone else. In much the same way,

183
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:04,800
the working class is not this group of completely pure hearted people. And this whole eat the

184
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:08,800
rich thing, it really does just boil down to people being jealous of those more successful

185
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:13,600
than they are. There may be good reasons to hate what some people do with all of their wealth,

186
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:18,880
but there is absolutely no reason to believe that if that wealth were redistributed and given to

187
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:24,480
those in the bottom rungs of society, that they wouldn't do the exact same thing if they could.

188
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:32,080
Nonetheless, the attitude to eat the rich still persists. So who are the rich anyway? And I don't

189
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:37,200
mean somebody who makes more money than you. Who are the actual rich? Are you in the world's top

190
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:45,680
1%? A $32,400 annual income will easily place American school teachers, registered nurses,

191
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:52,160
and other modestly salaried individuals among the global 1% of earners. What these activists claim

192
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:58,080
to be working class or lower middle class or whatever, they are the rich. There are of course

193
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:02,720
people much richer than that. There are the hyper rich. There are the 1% of the 1% of the 1%.

194
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:08,160
But the entire rest of the world is looking at the West with envy, including all of those rich kids

195
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:12,800
who are too dumb to understand that they're calling for their own heads. Should there ever

196
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:17,280
actually be any kind of worldwide communist revolution? And let's be honest, there's never

197
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:21,840
going to be. But let's say that there was one. And let's say that it stuck to the values of communism.

198
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:27,920
Every single person who has said eat the rich is going to find themselves on a chopping block.

199
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:33,920
And the only thing standing between privileged Marxist college kids and the abyss is capitalism.

200
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:35,920
You're welcome.
