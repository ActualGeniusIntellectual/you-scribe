00:00.000 --> 00:04.880
On January 4th, 2018, the Federal Communications Commission, or FCC,

00:04.880 --> 00:09.840
released its final net neutrality repeal order. This capped off months of discussion on the topic

00:09.840 --> 00:15.520
of net neutrality, which had previously come to a head on December 14th, 2017. But even before that,

00:15.520 --> 00:18.560
net neutrality had been floating around the political discourse for several years,

00:18.560 --> 00:24.080
in one form or another. What exactly is net neutrality? Well, here's Wikipedia's definition.

00:24.080 --> 00:27.920
Net neutrality is the principle that internet service providers must treat all data on the

00:27.920 --> 00:33.840
internet the same, and not discriminate or charge differently by user, content, website, platform,

00:33.840 --> 00:38.320
application, type of attached equipment, or method of communication. For instance,

00:38.320 --> 00:42.560
under these principles, internet service providers are unable to intentionally block,

00:42.560 --> 00:47.600
slow down, or charge money for specific websites and online content. That sounds like a reasonable

00:47.600 --> 00:52.480
description of net neutrality to me, and at first glance it would seem unthinkable that somebody

00:52.480 --> 00:56.800
would oppose these principles. In fact, if you were to take a good hard look at the history of

00:56.800 --> 01:01.360
ISP behaviors and FCC actions against these behaviors since the beginning of the publicly

01:01.360 --> 01:06.720
available internet in the mid 1990s, it's not hard to see why so many people are supporters of net

01:06.720 --> 01:13.120
neutrality. In 1996, Congress passed the Telecommunications Act. In section 230, titled

01:13.120 --> 01:16.960
Protection for Private Blocking and Screening of Offensive Material, the legal status of the

01:16.960 --> 01:21.040
internet is brought up, with Congress taking an entirely hands-off approach regarding the

01:21.040 --> 01:25.440
regulation of the internet. A myriad of private lawsuits involving internet and tech companies

01:25.440 --> 01:29.680
began to build up, and when it became clear that the Telecommunications Act was providing no help,

01:29.680 --> 01:34.560
the FCC decided to commission a study of the internet in 1998. This study, titled the Cable

01:34.560 --> 01:40.080
Modem Order, released in 2002. In section 3, a basic framework for the regulation of the internet

01:40.080 --> 01:45.120
was introduced, alongside a criticism of Congress and its 1996 Telecommunications Act for not

01:45.120 --> 01:49.440
properly handling the issue. The Communications Act does not clearly indicate how cable modem

01:49.440 --> 01:53.200
service should be classified or regulated. The relevant statutory provisions do not yield

01:53.200 --> 01:57.520
easy or obvious answers to the questions at hand, and the case law interpreting those provisions is

01:57.520 --> 02:01.840
extensive and complex. The technologies and business models used to provide cable modem

02:01.840 --> 02:06.480
service are also complex and are still evolving. As the Supreme Court recently observed in its

02:06.480 --> 02:10.240
connection with the Commission's interpretation of the Poll Attachment Act and its application

02:10.240 --> 02:15.680
to cable modem service, the subject matter here is technical, complex, and dynamic. And as a general

02:15.680 --> 02:20.800
rule, agencies have the authority to fill gaps where statutes are silent. As a follow-up to this,

02:20.800 --> 02:26.320
in 2005, the FCC released the Internet Policy Statement. Section 2 of this statement reads

02:26.320 --> 02:31.440
as follows. The Communications Act, passed in 1934, charges the Commission with regulating

02:31.440 --> 02:36.560
interstate and foreign commerce in communication by wire and radio. The Communications Act regulates

02:36.560 --> 02:41.680
telecommunications carriers as common carriers under Title II. Information service providers,

02:41.680 --> 02:46.400
by contrast, are not subject to mandatory common carrier regulation under Title II. The Commission,

02:46.480 --> 02:51.680
however, has jurisdiction to impose additional regulatory obligations under its Title I

02:51.680 --> 02:56.240
ancillary jurisdiction to regulate interstate and foreign communications. As a result,

02:56.240 --> 03:00.240
the Commission has jurisdiction necessary to ensure that providers of telecommunications

03:00.240 --> 03:05.840
for Internet access or Internet Protocol-enabled, IP-enabled services are operated in a neutral

03:05.840 --> 03:10.720
manner. Moreover, to ensure that broadband networks are widely deployed, open, affordable,

03:10.720 --> 03:15.120
and accessible to all consumers, the Commission adopts the following principles. To encourage

03:15.120 --> 03:18.960
broadband deployment and preserve and promote the open and interconnected nature of the public

03:18.960 --> 03:23.040
Internet, consumers are entitled to access the lawful Internet content of their choice.

03:23.040 --> 03:27.280
Consumers are entitled to run applications and use services of their choice, subject to the needs

03:27.280 --> 03:31.200
of law enforcement. Consumers are entitled to connect their choice of legal devices that do not

03:31.200 --> 03:36.480
harm the network. And consumers are entitled to competition among network providers, application

03:36.480 --> 03:41.280
and service providers, and content providers. This is all nicely summed up in Section III.

03:41.280 --> 03:46.240
The Commission has a duty to preserve and promote the vibrant and open character of the Internet

03:46.240 --> 03:50.480
as the telecommunications marketplace enters the broadband age. And just so we're clear,

03:50.480 --> 03:55.680
services classified under Title I are information services and subject to regulation by the Federal

03:55.680 --> 04:01.280
Trade Commission or FTC, while services classified under Title II are telecommunications services

04:01.280 --> 04:06.720
or common carriers and instead subject to FCC regulation. Title III refers to the regulation

04:06.720 --> 04:11.440
of signals to Earth-orbiting satellites, and Titles IV through VI discuss implementation of

04:11.440 --> 04:16.160
the law and special case scenarios. Title I information services are lightly regulated,

04:16.160 --> 04:21.200
while Title II common carriers are heavily regulated. A common carrier refers to a service

04:21.200 --> 04:24.560
provider to the general public without discrimination for the greater public good,

04:24.560 --> 04:29.280
in contrast with private carriers which have more freedom regarding who they serve and for what

04:29.280 --> 04:35.360
price. In 2010, during a lawsuit between Comcast and the FCC, the judge ruled that the FCC had

04:35.360 --> 04:39.120
overstepped its bounds in attempting to regulate Comcast's shitty business practices, because

04:39.120 --> 04:45.200
Internet Service Providers, or ISPs, were regulated by the FTC under Title I, not the FCC under Title

04:45.200 --> 04:50.160
II. In response, the FCC released the Open Internet Order, and while it can be somewhat

04:50.160 --> 04:54.160
technical, a basic layman's description is provided in the preamble. To provide greater

04:54.160 --> 04:58.240
clarity and certainty regarding the continued freedom and openness of the Internet, we adopt

04:58.240 --> 05:02.800
three basic rules that are grounded in broadly accepted Internet norms, as well as our own prior

05:02.800 --> 05:08.320
decisions. 1. Transparency. Fixed and mobile broadband providers must disclose the network

05:08.320 --> 05:12.800
management practices, performance characteristics, and terms and conditions of their broadband

05:12.800 --> 05:18.880
services. 2. No blocking. Fixed broadband providers may not block lawful content, applications,

05:18.880 --> 05:24.560
services, or non-harmful devices. Mobile broadband providers may not block lawful websites or block

05:24.560 --> 05:29.760
applications that compete with their voice or video telephony services. 3. No unreasonable

05:29.760 --> 05:34.160
discrimination. Fixed broadband providers may not unreasonably discriminate in transmitting

05:34.160 --> 05:38.720
lawful network traffic. We believe these rules, applied with the contemporary principle of

05:38.720 --> 05:43.200
reasonable network management, will empower and protect consumers and innovators, while helping

05:43.200 --> 05:47.520
ensure that the Internet continues to flourish with robust private investment and rapid innovation

05:47.520 --> 05:53.120
at both the core and the edge of the network. Soon after, Verizon sued the FCC under the same logic

05:53.120 --> 05:57.440
that they didn't have the right to regulate ISPs under Title II, as ISPs were designated Title I

05:57.440 --> 06:01.600
information services and not Title II common carriers. The judge would eventually rule in

06:01.600 --> 06:07.040
2014 that while the court agreed that ISPs needed to be regulated in the manner that the FCC

06:07.040 --> 06:12.960
described, the FCC still didn't have the authority to do so, which would lead, in 2015, to the FCC

06:12.960 --> 06:18.560
reclassifying ISPs as common carriers under Title II with the support of President Obama. In 2015,

06:18.560 --> 06:23.200
the FCC released the Net Neutrality Order outlining three specific practices that ISPs

06:23.200 --> 06:27.840
would need to follow going forward. 1. No blocking. A person engaged in the provision

06:27.840 --> 06:32.400
of broadband Internet access service, insofar as such a person is so engaged, shall not block

06:32.400 --> 06:37.120
lawful content, applications, services, or non-harmful devices subject to reasonable

06:37.120 --> 06:41.760
network management. 2. No throttling. A person engaged in the provision of broadband Internet

06:41.760 --> 06:46.080
access service, insofar as such a person is so engaged, shall not impair or degrade lawful

06:46.080 --> 06:50.560
Internet traffic on the basis of Internet content, application, or service, or use of a non-harmful

06:50.560 --> 06:55.920
device subject to reasonable network management. 3. No paid prioritization. A person engaged in

06:55.920 --> 06:59.920
the provision of broadband Internet access service, insofar as such a person is so engaged,

06:59.920 --> 07:04.560
shall not engage in paid prioritization. The logic of the first rule is self-evident. People

07:04.560 --> 07:08.960
expect to be able to access the whole Internet when they pay their ISP for Internet access.

07:08.960 --> 07:14.240
Rules 2 and 3 are built on the premise of Rule 1, that an extreme amount of throttling or paid

07:14.240 --> 07:19.200
prioritization would in practice violate Rule 1, and so to avoid a slippery slope situation,

07:19.200 --> 07:23.200
they simply axe those possibilities. And most recently in the timeline of events,

07:23.200 --> 07:29.600
in 2017, the FCC's current chairman, Ajit Pai, released an order putting ISPs back under Title

07:29.600 --> 07:34.080
1 as information services and out from under Title 2 as common carriers, effectively reversing

07:34.080 --> 07:38.640
the 2015 net neutrality order. And it's this action that has made the Internet lose its

07:38.640 --> 07:42.640
collective fucking minds. Now, a lot of net neutrality opponents make the argument that

07:42.640 --> 07:48.240
the Internet was just fine before 2015, and that 2017's repeal is not going to bring humanity back

07:48.240 --> 07:52.240
into the Dark Ages. And that argument does have some weight to it. I'm sure we can all remember

07:52.240 --> 07:57.680
the Internet pre-2015, and it was basically the same thing as it was after 2015. But at the same

07:57.680 --> 08:03.360
time, the pre-2015 Internet wasn't a paradise either. In 2014, The Huffington Post released

08:03.360 --> 08:08.000
an article titled Net Blocking, a Problem in Need of a Solution. And in this article is a timeline

08:08.000 --> 08:13.280
of the many instances of ISPs not only blocking, throttling, or offering paid prioritization,

08:13.280 --> 08:18.080
but refusing to tell their customers about it. In 2005, a local Madison River ISP blocked

08:18.080 --> 08:22.640
the VoIP service Vonage, Comcast blocked all peer-to-peer applications, and Telus blocked

08:22.640 --> 08:27.520
access to 766 individual websites that exposed political opinions that the management of Telus

08:27.520 --> 08:32.720
personally disagreed with, including a website supporting a labor strike against Telus. In 2007,

08:32.720 --> 08:37.680
AT&T forced Apple to block all VoIP applications on the iPhone, wanting people to use their phone

08:37.680 --> 08:42.640
services instead. In 2010, Windstream Communications began redirecting Google searches into their own

08:42.640 --> 08:48.160
proprietary search engine. In 2011, Metro PC's blockstreaming video from all sources except

08:48.160 --> 08:55.920
YouTube. The ISP's Cavalier, Cogent, Frontier, Fuse, DirectPC, RCN, and WideOpenWest were found

08:55.920 --> 09:01.120
to be redirecting search queries through the proprietary search engine Paxfire. And AT&T,

09:01.120 --> 09:06.080
Sprint, and Verizon blocked access to Google Wallet in favor of their own online payment

09:06.080 --> 09:12.560
service, unfortunately named ISIS. In 2012, Verizon blocked free tethering applications

09:12.560 --> 09:17.840
in favor of its own $20 tethering service. And AT&T blocked access to FaceTime unless

09:17.840 --> 09:22.800
customers subscribed to a specific, more expensive payment plan. Oh yeah, and in 2013,

09:22.800 --> 09:27.520
Verizon explicitly admitted in court that the only reason they weren't just charging a whole

09:27.520 --> 09:32.400
whack of money for piecemeal, downgraded internet services is due to the FCC's attempts to regulate

09:32.400 --> 09:36.400
it. Admittedly, some of these instances are from the mobile services of these companies,

09:36.400 --> 09:41.680
and not their ISP division. However, even as their shitty internet practices were regulated from 2015

09:41.680 --> 09:47.280
to 2017, their shitty mobile practices continued to degrade in quality. In this time, Verizon

09:47.280 --> 09:51.680
prevented third-party SIM cards from working, they blocked the Pay with PayPal app, the Whitepages

09:51.680 --> 09:56.720
free caller ID app, and all Radio FM apps. T-Mobile throttled speed on all unlimited plans,

09:56.720 --> 10:01.600
and a formal investigation into AT&T's business practices began. You would be a fool to think

10:01.600 --> 10:05.280
that these companies wouldn't do the same thing with their internet services if they could.

10:05.280 --> 10:10.800
So this is, as far as I can tell, the bulk of the pro-net neutrality argument. ISPs have a history

10:10.800 --> 10:14.960
of duplicitous business practices, and the FCC has been attempting to rein them in at every turn.

10:14.960 --> 10:19.760
The net neutrality principles of no blocking, no throttling, and no paid prioritization are

10:19.760 --> 10:24.000
ultimately in the public good, because they ensure that everyone gets access to the same internet.

10:24.000 --> 10:28.000
Net neutrality proponents often explain these principles with the highway analogy.

10:28.000 --> 10:32.480
With speed bumps in the slow lane, and fast lanes open only for those who can afford to pay.

10:32.480 --> 10:36.320
But let's give the devil his due here, let's take a look at what the opponents of net neutrality

10:36.320 --> 10:41.200
have to say. Well, first of all, the phrase opponents of net neutrality doesn't necessarily

10:41.200 --> 10:45.680
work in this context. There are a lot of people who are pro-net neutrality's principles,

10:45.680 --> 10:51.120
and still believe that a JIT Pai's action to return ISPs to their pre-2015 Title I state was

10:51.120 --> 10:54.880
ultimately a good thing. These people still believe in the values of net neutrality,

10:54.880 --> 11:00.720
but ultimately believe that FTC regulation under Title I, and not FCC regulation under Title II,

11:00.720 --> 11:05.520
is the best way to get us there. Unfortunately, both the mainstream media and the new internet

11:05.520 --> 11:09.760
media, in a rare instance of cooperation between the two, has tarred and feathered anybody who

11:09.760 --> 11:14.880
dislikes Title II regulation of ISPs as an anti-net neutrality totalitarian dictator that simply wants

11:14.880 --> 11:18.560
to regulate the free and open internet into non-existence. While the actual situation is

11:18.560 --> 11:22.800
more nuanced than that. So let's take a look at the point of view of the Title I proponents.

11:22.800 --> 11:26.800
You know that long list in the Huffington Post listing the various misdeeds of the ISPs?

11:26.800 --> 11:32.080
Well, all of those cases prior to 2015 were actually successfully resolved using Title I

11:32.080 --> 11:36.800
regulation, and almost all of them in favour of the consumer. Title I seemed to be working

11:36.800 --> 11:41.280
just fine. Sure, the ISPs were trying some shady shit, but they weren't really getting away with

11:41.280 --> 11:46.480
it. And if the Title II argument is that Title II classification would prevent ISPs from even trying

11:46.480 --> 11:50.560
the shady shit in the first place, well that's a pretty slippery slope to go down. I don't know

11:50.560 --> 11:56.080
about you, but insofar as government regulation is concerned in general, I would rather governments

11:56.080 --> 12:02.000
create a blacklist of grossly unethical practices, instead of a whitelist of pre-approved practices.

12:02.000 --> 12:05.680
Additionally, Title II proponents seem to believe that paid prioritization is a taboo,

12:05.680 --> 12:10.880
that all packets of data must be treated equally. But why? I mean, loading an email or a Reddit

12:10.880 --> 12:15.840
thread certainly doesn't require the same latency as playing video games online or watching Netflix

12:15.840 --> 12:20.800
or streaming to your audience. In any other industry, prioritizing resources based on need

12:20.800 --> 12:25.120
is a no-brainer. And then there's that famous Portugal internet package image, where Title II

12:25.120 --> 12:29.440
proponents say that this excessive bundling with restrictive data caps is where American ISPs will

12:29.440 --> 12:34.560
end up without regulation. Well, notwithstanding the fact that this Portuguese plan doesn't block

12:34.560 --> 12:39.360
access to specific types of content if you don't buy their specialized plans, but instead offers

12:39.360 --> 12:43.040
a faster connection for those types while still maintaining a basic minimum access that is

12:43.040 --> 12:47.600
reasonable, why do you think that this would happen? It didn't happen before 2015, when ISPs

12:47.600 --> 12:51.920
were under Title I. And do you think that an ISP would actually survive in the marketplace if it

12:51.920 --> 12:56.240
attempted to do this sort of thing? Its competitors would eat it alive. So with Title I out of the

12:56.240 --> 13:01.440
way, let's talk about the actual opponents of net neutrality. Not people who want FDC regulation

13:01.440 --> 13:06.080
under Title I. You know, the people who believe that a fully deregulated internet where ISPs can

13:06.080 --> 13:10.000
just do whatever the fuck the market will let them get away with is the best possible way forward.

13:10.000 --> 13:14.800
What's their reasoning? Well, a big one is that net neutrality stifles investment in innovation.

13:14.800 --> 13:19.840
This is a common free market capitalist argument that excessive taxation, strict adherence to

13:19.840 --> 13:24.400
regulation, and large amounts of red tape all contribute to diminished returns on investments,

13:24.400 --> 13:28.480
and that eventually it becomes a net loss for a company to invest in its own business.

13:28.480 --> 13:32.960
Mark Anderson, the inventor of the world's first web browser software, said in an interview with

13:32.960 --> 13:37.680
the Washington Post that, I think that a pure net neutrality view is difficult to sustain if you

13:37.680 --> 13:41.040
also want to have continued investment in broadband networks. If you're a large

13:41.040 --> 13:45.280
telecommunications company right now, you're spending on the order of 20 billion dollars

13:45.280 --> 13:49.120
a year on capital expenditure. You need to know how you're going to get a return on that investment.

13:49.120 --> 13:53.120
If you have these pure net neutrality rules where you can never charge a company like Netflix

13:53.120 --> 13:56.640
anything, you're not ever going to get a return on continued network investment, which means you'll

13:56.640 --> 14:00.400
stop investing in the network. And I would not want to be sitting here 10 or 20 years from now

14:00.400 --> 14:04.960
with the same broadband speeds we're getting today. Additionally, the ability for new competitors to

14:04.960 --> 14:09.360
enter the market also becomes non-existent under net neutrality. The same costs that restrict

14:09.360 --> 14:13.040
larger ISP's ability to invest in their own business prevent smaller competitors from

14:13.040 --> 14:17.440
springing up at all. They simply don't have the ability to start up a new business. In reality,

14:17.440 --> 14:22.560
net neutrality can actually promote monopolies and pricing cabals within the ISP market by making the

14:22.560 --> 14:27.040
cost of new competitors entering the market prohibitively high. The honest reality is,

14:27.040 --> 14:30.880
the physical infrastructure of the internet requires a lot of money to build and maintain,

14:30.880 --> 14:35.280
and somebody has to foot the bill for that. We've got four choices as to who. The ISP's,

14:35.280 --> 14:39.520
the consumer's, the content provider's, or the government. Having the government foot the bill

14:39.520 --> 14:44.000
would effectively nationalize the internet, and I don't think anybody wants that. Under Title II

14:44.000 --> 14:49.120
regulation, the ISP's are forced to foot the bill themselves. Net neutrality demands that all users,

14:49.120 --> 14:53.280
both the consumer and the content provider's, pay the same rate no matter how much data they

14:53.280 --> 14:57.600
actually use. If consumers foot the bill, that means changing the internet package to something

14:57.600 --> 15:02.800
more like mobile packages, with data caps and speed regulations, and even at their worst,

15:02.800 --> 15:07.600
content regulations. It's obvious that consumers don't want this, hell, I don't want this,

15:07.600 --> 15:12.320
but it's not inherently unfair. Imagine if electricity companies did away with the

15:12.320 --> 15:15.840
electricity meters on the side of everyone's houses and just charged us all a flat fee.

15:15.840 --> 15:19.600
Well hey, that sounds good, right? Maybe in the short term it would be, at least for us.

15:19.600 --> 15:24.560
But eventually, the cost of providing simplistic on-off, unmeasured access to everybody would

15:24.560 --> 15:28.400
become so high that either the system would collapse, or the electricity companies would

15:28.400 --> 15:33.280
massively jack everyone's prices up regardless of usage just to cover their expenses. But what

15:33.280 --> 15:37.200
about that fourth option? Charging the content providers for the bandwidth that their consumers

15:37.200 --> 15:42.160
demand. I mean, sites like YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, and Netflix all gobble up way more

15:42.160 --> 15:47.200
bandwidth than email servers or personal websites or blogs. If we don't want to pass the cost onto

15:47.200 --> 15:52.240
the customers, and passing the cost onto the ISP's is untenable in the long term, why don't these

15:52.240 --> 15:56.320
large tech companies pay their way? Why don't they invest in the infrastructure that makes

15:56.320 --> 16:01.040
their businesses viable in the first place? Maybe this is why every single time the topic

16:01.040 --> 16:05.680
of net neutrality comes up, every single tech giant speaks out in favor of it. Maybe it's

16:05.680 --> 16:10.640
because one of the more viable alternatives to a pure net neutrality is one that allows the ISPs

16:10.640 --> 16:15.280
to recoup their investment costs, but places the burden of cost on these tech giants instead of on

16:15.280 --> 16:20.000
the consumers. I mean, these companies certainly are not pro-net neutrality out of some ideological

16:20.000 --> 16:23.920
stance regarding the free and open nature of the internet. All the big social network platforms

16:23.920 --> 16:27.840
are just fine with regulating the internet as long as they are the ones doing the regulating.

16:27.840 --> 16:31.920
We already know from Project Veritas that YouTube manipulates search algorithms so that

16:31.920 --> 16:36.720
pre-approved curated content reaches the front page, the trending list, and so on. We already

16:36.720 --> 16:41.120
know the debacle that YouTube's yellow monetization sign limited state bullshit has become. We

16:41.120 --> 16:45.840
already know that Google uses its power to quash ideas it doesn't like. Here's some excerpts from

16:45.840 --> 16:50.320
an article of the same name. The Google salespeople were encouraging Forbes to add Google Plus's

16:50.320 --> 16:54.480
social buttons to articles on the site alongside the Facebook light button and the Reddit share

16:54.480 --> 16:58.880
button. They said it was important to do so because the Plus recommendations would be a

16:58.880 --> 17:03.520
factor in search results, a crucial source of traffic to publishers. This sounded like a news

17:03.520 --> 17:08.320
story to me. Google's dominance in search and news gave it tremendous power over publishers.

17:08.320 --> 17:13.360
By tying search results to the use of Google Plus, Google was using that muscle to force people to

17:13.360 --> 17:17.840
promote its social network. I asked the Google people if I understood correctly. If a publisher

17:17.840 --> 17:22.960
didn't want a plus one button on the page, its search results would suffer? The answer was yes.

17:22.960 --> 17:27.200
With that, I published a story headlined stick Google Plus buttons on your pages or your surf

17:27.200 --> 17:31.520
traffic suffers that included bits of conversation from the meeting. Google promptly flipped out.

17:31.520 --> 17:35.520
They never challenged the accuracy of the reporting. Instead, a Google spokesperson told

17:35.520 --> 17:39.200
me that I needed to unpublish the story because the meeting had been confidential and that the

17:39.200 --> 17:43.280
information discussed there had been subject to a non-disclosure agreement between Google and Forbes.

17:43.360 --> 17:47.280
I had signed no such agreement, hadn't been told the meeting was confidential, and I had identified

17:47.280 --> 17:52.160
myself as a journalist. It escalated quickly from there. I was told by my higher-ups at Forbes that

17:52.160 --> 17:56.000
Google representatives called them saying that the article was problematic and had to come down.

17:56.000 --> 17:59.840
The implication was that it might have consequences for Forbes, a troubling possibility

17:59.840 --> 18:04.000
given how much traffic came through Google searches and Google News. We already know that

18:04.000 --> 18:07.920
Google AdSense has threatened to remove all ad revenue from and disable the account of

18:07.920 --> 18:12.800
thelibertyconservative.com if they do not censor their content to Google standards. We already know

18:12.800 --> 18:17.200
that YouTube has demonetized all content on its platform regarding the Mandalay Bay shooting,

18:17.200 --> 18:21.440
even content where their ad revenue was meant to go to charity, with the official response of

18:21.440 --> 18:26.080
no matter the intent, our policy is to not run ads on videos about tragedies. Except when Jimmy

18:26.080 --> 18:30.720
Kimmel's video on that same shooting has ads on it. And though this is anecdotal and entirely my

18:30.720 --> 18:35.120
own subjective experience, I've noticed that YouTube is far more likely to approve a request

18:35.120 --> 18:40.400
to remove the limited monetization state if the video in question has non-skippable ads enabled.

18:40.400 --> 18:44.240
I might do a full video on YouTube's shitty practices sometime, there's actually some depth

18:44.240 --> 18:49.680
to the topic. We already know Facebook and Twitter are both extremely one-sided in who they ban,

18:49.680 --> 18:53.760
what content they allow, what content they promote, and which creators they curate. And

18:53.760 --> 18:58.080
what I stated would happen in one of my previous videos, the balkanization of technology, is coming

18:58.080 --> 19:02.320
to pass. Free speech alternatives to the big names and internet services are cropping up,

19:02.320 --> 19:06.880
they're fighting an uphill battle to be sure, but people are honestly just tired of being censored

19:06.880 --> 19:11.200
by the Reddits and Twitters and Facebooks of the world. So yeah, any time a big tech

19:11.200 --> 19:15.520
giant makes a post about net neutrality, just tell them to fuck off. They don't want net neutrality,

19:15.520 --> 19:20.320
they want to hold the reins instead of the government or the ISPs. And maybe, just maybe

19:20.320 --> 19:25.200
there's another reason why. Maybe it's because under Title I, the FTC has the jurisdiction to

19:25.200 --> 19:30.400
enforce antitrust and other anti-monopoly laws on these tech giants, not just the ISPs but the

19:30.400 --> 19:34.240
Twitters and YouTubes and Facebooks of the world. Yeah, that would be a pretty big reason for these

19:34.240 --> 19:38.960
companies to fear Title I regulation, wouldn't it? Can the case be made that Apple or Google

19:38.960 --> 19:43.200
or Facebook hold monopolies in their specific markets? Maybe. And there's other arguments as

19:43.200 --> 19:49.360
well. Let's take a look at Marsh v. Alabama, a 1946 U.S. Supreme Court case. In the case,

19:49.360 --> 19:53.360
the town of Chickasaw was entirely privately owned by the Gulf Shipbuilding Corporation.

19:53.360 --> 19:57.040
Though all buildings and roads within the town were company-owned, the roads connected to the

19:57.040 --> 20:02.000
state-owned highway and allowed non-employees to pass through the town and use civil services.

20:02.000 --> 20:07.120
Ms. Marsh, a Jehovah's Witness, attempted to distribute religious material on the sidewalk

20:07.120 --> 20:11.280
in Chickasaw and was arrested on the grounds that because the entire town was privately owned,

20:11.280 --> 20:15.360
free speech rights did not apply. The case went to the Supreme Court, where it was ruled that because

20:15.360 --> 20:20.000
the Gulf Shipbuilding Corporation held an absolute monopoly on what was colloquially referred to as

20:20.000 --> 20:25.040
the town square, that it in function took the role of a municipality. The claim of private property

20:25.040 --> 20:29.280
was rejected on the grounds that the Gulf Shipbuilding Corporation had provided access

20:29.280 --> 20:33.840
to the town and its infrastructure to any passerby in the past like a municipality would,

20:33.840 --> 20:36.960
and as a municipality they were bound to uphold the constitution.

20:36.960 --> 20:43.280
In 1996, the Marsh v. Alabama case was raised during the Cyber Promotions v. America Online

20:43.280 --> 20:48.160
case. Cyber Promotions wanted to send spam email to all email addresses that ended in

20:48.160 --> 20:53.680
at AOL.com. America Online decided to block all emails from Cyber Promotions at the ISP level.

20:53.680 --> 20:57.520
Cyber Promotions argued that Marsh v. Alabama set a precedent that private property,

20:57.520 --> 21:01.680
if sufficiently opened up to the public to the point that a monopoly on communication existed,

21:01.680 --> 21:06.400
must allow for free speech under the previous town square principle. The court disagreed,

21:06.400 --> 21:10.960
because AOL servers were only open to the public insofar as they were AOL customers,

21:10.960 --> 21:14.400
and this decision paved the way for the legality of the spam filter.

21:14.400 --> 21:18.800
But can that same case be made for Facebook or Twitter? Sure, these services are only available

21:18.800 --> 21:23.360
to people if they log into their accounts, but unlike AOL servers, it costs nothing to

21:23.360 --> 21:28.320
create these accounts. Unlike Netflix, which is a paid service, Facebook, Twitter, Reddit,

21:28.320 --> 21:33.120
and YouTube are all caught in the Marsh v. Alabama bind. They're all private entities that hold an

21:33.120 --> 21:37.120
absolute monopoly on free speech within their jurisdiction, and they're entirely open to the

21:37.120 --> 21:41.440
public, just like Chickasaw was. Maybe the way forward for net neutrality's principles isn't

21:41.440 --> 21:46.240
Title II. Maybe it's recognizing the internet as a town square and forcing all of its constituent

21:46.240 --> 21:51.200
parts, not just one slice of them, to conform to constitutional law. Of course, if you were to talk

21:51.200 --> 21:55.360
to any Title II diehard about any point I've brought up in this video, even the pro-net

21:55.360 --> 21:58.800
neutrality points that are anti-Title II, they would treat you like the neo-Nazi,

21:58.800 --> 22:02.960
Trump-supporting piece of bigoted capitalist scum that you obviously are. Oh yeah, guys,

22:02.960 --> 22:07.680
net neutrality is a race issue, right? Communities of color disproportionately affected? Even if the

22:07.680 --> 22:12.480
only change to the internet under Title I is that ISPs offer people even better internet if they can

22:12.480 --> 22:16.640
afford it? Well, of course. Internet communism demands that everyone has dial-up in order to

22:16.640 --> 22:21.840
avoid inequality. The repeal of net neutrality is an attack on the LGBTQ community? Don't worry,

22:21.840 --> 22:27.600
guys, you can still access Grindr on your mobile plan. Docs, Ajit Pai's kids? Yeah, sure, why the

22:27.600 --> 22:32.800
fuck not? I wonder if all these people who are irrationally pro-Title II net neutrality remember

22:32.800 --> 22:37.280
SOPA and PIPA. Yeah, yeah, remember that shit? Remember when the government tried to regulate

22:37.280 --> 22:41.360
the internet and everyone lost their minds over it? Remember the outcry against the NSA? What

22:41.360 --> 22:45.520
happened that made you guys suddenly beg and kick and scream for government regulation of the

22:45.520 --> 22:48.720
internet? And you know, now that we're on the topic of going completely off the rails into

22:48.720 --> 22:52.640
insanity land, I'd like to present you with a crackpot conspiracy theory and let you make up

22:52.640 --> 22:57.120
your own mind about it. Title II regulation allows the government to force ISPs into obtaining

22:57.120 --> 23:02.560
broadcasting licenses, like with radio and TV. Obama pushes for this classification in 2015,

23:02.560 --> 23:06.480
along with other SOPA and PIPA provisions that were rejected by the electorate. This package

23:06.480 --> 23:11.200
of shit is rebranded as net neutrality, and ISPs get placed under the Title II umbrella.

23:11.200 --> 23:17.680
On December 23rd, 2016, Obama signs the 2017 National Defense Authorization Act into law.

23:17.680 --> 23:21.440
As a bundle, this act also contains the Countering Information Warfare Act,

23:21.440 --> 23:25.280
introduced by Congress on May 10th, 2016. Let's take a peek at it.

23:25.280 --> 23:28.560
The Secretary of State, in coordination with the Secretary of Defense and the heads of other

23:28.560 --> 23:32.720
relevant federal departments and agencies, shall establish within the Department of State a Global

23:32.720 --> 23:38.000
Engagement Center, in this section referred to as The Center. The purpose of The Center

23:38.000 --> 23:43.040
shall be to analyze relevant information, data, analysis, and analytics from United States

23:43.040 --> 23:48.000
government agencies, United States allies and partner nations, think tanks, academic

23:48.000 --> 23:54.320
institutions, civil society groups, and other non-governmental organizations, in order to lead,

23:54.320 --> 23:58.560
synchronize, and coordinate efforts of the federal government to recognize, understand,

23:58.560 --> 24:04.400
expose, and counter foreign state and non-state propaganda and disinformation efforts aimed at

24:04.400 --> 24:07.920
undermining United States national security interests. The legislation declares that the

24:07.920 --> 24:12.720
head of The Center will be housed within the White House instead of being independent like most other

24:12.720 --> 24:16.720
centers created in this way, that the head will answer directly to the president, and that The

24:16.720 --> 24:21.760
Center will allow the president to use whole-of-government approaches to combat what it labels

24:21.760 --> 24:27.520
as basically fake news. Maybe this is a bit of a stretch, but just think about it for a minute.

24:27.520 --> 24:32.880
ISPs are required to have broadcast licenses under Title II. ISPs become legally required to take

24:32.880 --> 24:39.600
down whatever the Global Engagement Center, or The Center, deems as state or non-state propaganda,

24:39.600 --> 24:44.400
meaning not just Russian or Chinese propaganda efforts, but your posts to The Donald, the

24:44.400 --> 24:50.560
Breitbart articles you read, the 4chan boards you lurk. If the ISP refuses to do so, the FCC revokes

24:50.560 --> 24:54.240
their broadcasting license. And around the same time all this stuff is being pushed through

24:54.240 --> 24:59.120
Congress, social media companies start revving up their internal policing like Twitter partnering

24:59.120 --> 25:05.120
with Crash Override, or the Google Ideas team being full of SJWs, and others, and these groups

25:05.120 --> 25:09.120
are getting played under this legislation as well. The Center can declare those groups as

25:09.120 --> 25:13.680
third-party fact-checkers because business considers them to be, and The Center can use

25:13.680 --> 25:18.560
their standards to force ISPs under Title II to remove content and restrict access based on the

25:18.560 --> 25:23.520
individual being a propagandist. And over the past five years, the internet-using public has largely

25:23.520 --> 25:28.320
become acclimatized to this idea. We find social media platforms having third-party fact-checking

25:28.320 --> 25:33.360
teams, fake news combatants, and hate speech provisions as silly, but not silly enough for

25:33.360 --> 25:38.480
a large-scale boycott. The idea of regulating the internet has shifted from unpopular to necessary,

25:38.480 --> 25:43.120
SOPA to net neutrality. And just like I said in a previous video, the free speech problem,

25:43.120 --> 25:47.680
blocking hate speech is now considered a more primary right than allowing free speech. To make

25:47.680 --> 25:51.760
this go fully into tinfoil hat territory, let me present one more quote from this piece of

25:51.760 --> 25:56.480
legislation. The Center shall terminate on the date that is eight years after the date of the

25:56.480 --> 26:03.360
enactment of this act. Obama thought Hillary would win, so much so that he entrusted her

26:03.360 --> 26:07.520
upcoming presidency with the power to declare anything on the internet or in the media as fake

26:07.520 --> 26:12.800
news, and not only censor it, but revoke internet access to both individuals and organizations,

26:12.800 --> 26:17.920
because The Center is legally obligated to listen to the radical left-leaning fact-checking teams

26:17.920 --> 26:22.720
within tech giants that label anything against their views as fascism and nazism. And they can

26:22.720 --> 26:27.760
do all of this without a court order. Now I know this is all just tinfoil hat conspiracy theory,

26:27.760 --> 26:31.120
but there's just enough actual legislation to make you think about it for a minute.

26:31.120 --> 26:36.400
And on this issue, I am actually glad Donald Trump won the election. Under his direction,

26:36.400 --> 26:42.240
Ajit Pai has reclassified ISPs as Title I, and the only mention of fake news from his administration

26:42.240 --> 26:46.400
has been him shitposting about it on Twitter. Ultimately, I believe that the internet does

26:46.400 --> 26:51.280
need some common-sense regulation, but I don't think that Title II is the way to go. Personally,

26:51.280 --> 26:55.440
I believe that two of the three net neutrality principles are ultimately good for consumers

26:55.920 --> 27:00.640
— no blocking and no throttling — while the third, no paid prioritization, is probably bad

27:00.640 --> 27:04.240
for consumers in the long run. I personally like the idea of being able to pay more for

27:04.240 --> 27:08.960
hyperfast internet or specialized usage packages that provide good specific benefits while still

27:08.960 --> 27:13.840
maintaining a solid minimum level of quality. And hey, while I was recording this script,

27:13.840 --> 27:17.360
it came out that the US Senate is trying a last-ditch attempt to keep the Title II

27:17.360 --> 27:21.520
regulation on the books. Though of course, the media bills this not as Title II but as net

27:21.520 --> 27:26.160
neutrality, I guess you can see what side they've chosen. In any case, it's not over yet, but I hope

27:26.160 --> 27:30.320
I've done an accurate enough job at presenting the case for Title II regulation, Title I regulation,

27:30.320 --> 27:34.800
and no regulation at all, and I recommend you all come to your own conclusions. I just personally

27:34.800 --> 27:37.840
think that none of these options are going to be good enough for the health of the internet.

27:37.840 --> 27:40.160
Not in the long term. We need something new.
