0	4880	On January 4th, 2018, the Federal Communications Commission, or FCC,
4880	9840	released its final net neutrality repeal order. This capped off months of discussion on the topic
9840	15520	of net neutrality, which had previously come to a head on December 14th, 2017. But even before that,
15520	18560	net neutrality had been floating around the political discourse for several years,
18560	24080	in one form or another. What exactly is net neutrality? Well, here's Wikipedia's definition.
24080	27920	Net neutrality is the principle that internet service providers must treat all data on the
27920	33840	internet the same, and not discriminate or charge differently by user, content, website, platform,
33840	38320	application, type of attached equipment, or method of communication. For instance,
38320	42560	under these principles, internet service providers are unable to intentionally block,
42560	47600	slow down, or charge money for specific websites and online content. That sounds like a reasonable
47600	52480	description of net neutrality to me, and at first glance it would seem unthinkable that somebody
52480	56800	would oppose these principles. In fact, if you were to take a good hard look at the history of
56800	61360	ISP behaviors and FCC actions against these behaviors since the beginning of the publicly
61360	66720	available internet in the mid 1990s, it's not hard to see why so many people are supporters of net
66720	73120	neutrality. In 1996, Congress passed the Telecommunications Act. In section 230, titled
73120	76960	Protection for Private Blocking and Screening of Offensive Material, the legal status of the
76960	81040	internet is brought up, with Congress taking an entirely hands-off approach regarding the
81040	85440	regulation of the internet. A myriad of private lawsuits involving internet and tech companies
85440	89680	began to build up, and when it became clear that the Telecommunications Act was providing no help,
89680	94560	the FCC decided to commission a study of the internet in 1998. This study, titled the Cable
94560	100080	Modem Order, released in 2002. In section 3, a basic framework for the regulation of the internet
100080	105120	was introduced, alongside a criticism of Congress and its 1996 Telecommunications Act for not
105120	109440	properly handling the issue. The Communications Act does not clearly indicate how cable modem
109440	113200	service should be classified or regulated. The relevant statutory provisions do not yield
113200	117520	easy or obvious answers to the questions at hand, and the case law interpreting those provisions is
117520	121840	extensive and complex. The technologies and business models used to provide cable modem
121840	126480	service are also complex and are still evolving. As the Supreme Court recently observed in its
126480	130240	connection with the Commission's interpretation of the Poll Attachment Act and its application
130240	135680	to cable modem service, the subject matter here is technical, complex, and dynamic. And as a general
135680	140800	rule, agencies have the authority to fill gaps where statutes are silent. As a follow-up to this,
140800	146320	in 2005, the FCC released the Internet Policy Statement. Section 2 of this statement reads
146320	151440	as follows. The Communications Act, passed in 1934, charges the Commission with regulating
151440	156560	interstate and foreign commerce in communication by wire and radio. The Communications Act regulates
156560	161680	telecommunications carriers as common carriers under Title II. Information service providers,
161680	166400	by contrast, are not subject to mandatory common carrier regulation under Title II. The Commission,
166480	171680	however, has jurisdiction to impose additional regulatory obligations under its Title I
171680	176240	ancillary jurisdiction to regulate interstate and foreign communications. As a result,
176240	180240	the Commission has jurisdiction necessary to ensure that providers of telecommunications
180240	185840	for Internet access or Internet Protocol-enabled, IP-enabled services are operated in a neutral
185840	190720	manner. Moreover, to ensure that broadband networks are widely deployed, open, affordable,
190720	195120	and accessible to all consumers, the Commission adopts the following principles. To encourage
195120	198960	broadband deployment and preserve and promote the open and interconnected nature of the public
198960	203040	Internet, consumers are entitled to access the lawful Internet content of their choice.
203040	207280	Consumers are entitled to run applications and use services of their choice, subject to the needs
207280	211200	of law enforcement. Consumers are entitled to connect their choice of legal devices that do not
211200	216480	harm the network. And consumers are entitled to competition among network providers, application
216480	221280	and service providers, and content providers. This is all nicely summed up in Section III.
221280	226240	The Commission has a duty to preserve and promote the vibrant and open character of the Internet
226240	230480	as the telecommunications marketplace enters the broadband age. And just so we're clear,
230480	235680	services classified under Title I are information services and subject to regulation by the Federal
235680	241280	Trade Commission or FTC, while services classified under Title II are telecommunications services
241280	246720	or common carriers and instead subject to FCC regulation. Title III refers to the regulation
246720	251440	of signals to Earth-orbiting satellites, and Titles IV through VI discuss implementation of
251440	256160	the law and special case scenarios. Title I information services are lightly regulated,
256160	261200	while Title II common carriers are heavily regulated. A common carrier refers to a service
261200	264560	provider to the general public without discrimination for the greater public good,
264560	269280	in contrast with private carriers which have more freedom regarding who they serve and for what
269280	275360	price. In 2010, during a lawsuit between Comcast and the FCC, the judge ruled that the FCC had
275360	279120	overstepped its bounds in attempting to regulate Comcast's shitty business practices, because
279120	285200	Internet Service Providers, or ISPs, were regulated by the FTC under Title I, not the FCC under Title
285200	290160	II. In response, the FCC released the Open Internet Order, and while it can be somewhat
290160	294160	technical, a basic layman's description is provided in the preamble. To provide greater
294160	298240	clarity and certainty regarding the continued freedom and openness of the Internet, we adopt
298240	302800	three basic rules that are grounded in broadly accepted Internet norms, as well as our own prior
302800	308320	decisions. 1. Transparency. Fixed and mobile broadband providers must disclose the network
308320	312800	management practices, performance characteristics, and terms and conditions of their broadband
312800	318880	services. 2. No blocking. Fixed broadband providers may not block lawful content, applications,
318880	324560	services, or non-harmful devices. Mobile broadband providers may not block lawful websites or block
324560	329760	applications that compete with their voice or video telephony services. 3. No unreasonable
329760	334160	discrimination. Fixed broadband providers may not unreasonably discriminate in transmitting
334160	338720	lawful network traffic. We believe these rules, applied with the contemporary principle of
338720	343200	reasonable network management, will empower and protect consumers and innovators, while helping
343200	347520	ensure that the Internet continues to flourish with robust private investment and rapid innovation
347520	353120	at both the core and the edge of the network. Soon after, Verizon sued the FCC under the same logic
353120	357440	that they didn't have the right to regulate ISPs under Title II, as ISPs were designated Title I
357440	361600	information services and not Title II common carriers. The judge would eventually rule in
361600	367040	2014 that while the court agreed that ISPs needed to be regulated in the manner that the FCC
367040	372960	described, the FCC still didn't have the authority to do so, which would lead, in 2015, to the FCC
372960	378560	reclassifying ISPs as common carriers under Title II with the support of President Obama. In 2015,
378560	383200	the FCC released the Net Neutrality Order outlining three specific practices that ISPs
383200	387840	would need to follow going forward. 1. No blocking. A person engaged in the provision
387840	392400	of broadband Internet access service, insofar as such a person is so engaged, shall not block
392400	397120	lawful content, applications, services, or non-harmful devices subject to reasonable
397120	401760	network management. 2. No throttling. A person engaged in the provision of broadband Internet
401760	406080	access service, insofar as such a person is so engaged, shall not impair or degrade lawful
406080	410560	Internet traffic on the basis of Internet content, application, or service, or use of a non-harmful
410560	415920	device subject to reasonable network management. 3. No paid prioritization. A person engaged in
415920	419920	the provision of broadband Internet access service, insofar as such a person is so engaged,
419920	424560	shall not engage in paid prioritization. The logic of the first rule is self-evident. People
424560	428960	expect to be able to access the whole Internet when they pay their ISP for Internet access.
428960	434240	Rules 2 and 3 are built on the premise of Rule 1, that an extreme amount of throttling or paid
434240	439200	prioritization would in practice violate Rule 1, and so to avoid a slippery slope situation,
439200	443200	they simply axe those possibilities. And most recently in the timeline of events,
443200	449600	in 2017, the FCC's current chairman, Ajit Pai, released an order putting ISPs back under Title
449600	454080	1 as information services and out from under Title 2 as common carriers, effectively reversing
454080	458640	the 2015 net neutrality order. And it's this action that has made the Internet lose its
458640	462640	collective fucking minds. Now, a lot of net neutrality opponents make the argument that
462640	468240	the Internet was just fine before 2015, and that 2017's repeal is not going to bring humanity back
468240	472240	into the Dark Ages. And that argument does have some weight to it. I'm sure we can all remember
472240	477680	the Internet pre-2015, and it was basically the same thing as it was after 2015. But at the same
477680	483360	time, the pre-2015 Internet wasn't a paradise either. In 2014, The Huffington Post released
483360	488000	an article titled Net Blocking, a Problem in Need of a Solution. And in this article is a timeline
488000	493280	of the many instances of ISPs not only blocking, throttling, or offering paid prioritization,
493280	498080	but refusing to tell their customers about it. In 2005, a local Madison River ISP blocked
498080	502640	the VoIP service Vonage, Comcast blocked all peer-to-peer applications, and Telus blocked
502640	507520	access to 766 individual websites that exposed political opinions that the management of Telus
507520	512720	personally disagreed with, including a website supporting a labor strike against Telus. In 2007,
512720	517680	AT&T forced Apple to block all VoIP applications on the iPhone, wanting people to use their phone
517680	522640	services instead. In 2010, Windstream Communications began redirecting Google searches into their own
522640	528160	proprietary search engine. In 2011, Metro PC's blockstreaming video from all sources except
528160	535920	YouTube. The ISP's Cavalier, Cogent, Frontier, Fuse, DirectPC, RCN, and WideOpenWest were found
535920	541120	to be redirecting search queries through the proprietary search engine Paxfire. And AT&T,
541120	546080	Sprint, and Verizon blocked access to Google Wallet in favor of their own online payment
546080	552560	service, unfortunately named ISIS. In 2012, Verizon blocked free tethering applications
552560	557840	in favor of its own $20 tethering service. And AT&T blocked access to FaceTime unless
557840	562800	customers subscribed to a specific, more expensive payment plan. Oh yeah, and in 2013,
562800	567520	Verizon explicitly admitted in court that the only reason they weren't just charging a whole
567520	572400	whack of money for piecemeal, downgraded internet services is due to the FCC's attempts to regulate
572400	576400	it. Admittedly, some of these instances are from the mobile services of these companies,
576400	581680	and not their ISP division. However, even as their shitty internet practices were regulated from 2015
581680	587280	to 2017, their shitty mobile practices continued to degrade in quality. In this time, Verizon
587280	591680	prevented third-party SIM cards from working, they blocked the Pay with PayPal app, the Whitepages
591680	596720	free caller ID app, and all Radio FM apps. T-Mobile throttled speed on all unlimited plans,
596720	601600	and a formal investigation into AT&T's business practices began. You would be a fool to think
601600	605280	that these companies wouldn't do the same thing with their internet services if they could.
605280	610800	So this is, as far as I can tell, the bulk of the pro-net neutrality argument. ISPs have a history
610800	614960	of duplicitous business practices, and the FCC has been attempting to rein them in at every turn.
614960	619760	The net neutrality principles of no blocking, no throttling, and no paid prioritization are
619760	624000	ultimately in the public good, because they ensure that everyone gets access to the same internet.
624000	628000	Net neutrality proponents often explain these principles with the highway analogy.
628000	632480	With speed bumps in the slow lane, and fast lanes open only for those who can afford to pay.
632480	636320	But let's give the devil his due here, let's take a look at what the opponents of net neutrality
636320	641200	have to say. Well, first of all, the phrase opponents of net neutrality doesn't necessarily
641200	645680	work in this context. There are a lot of people who are pro-net neutrality's principles,
645680	651120	and still believe that a JIT Pai's action to return ISPs to their pre-2015 Title I state was
651120	654880	ultimately a good thing. These people still believe in the values of net neutrality,
654880	660720	but ultimately believe that FTC regulation under Title I, and not FCC regulation under Title II,
660720	665520	is the best way to get us there. Unfortunately, both the mainstream media and the new internet
665520	669760	media, in a rare instance of cooperation between the two, has tarred and feathered anybody who
669760	674880	dislikes Title II regulation of ISPs as an anti-net neutrality totalitarian dictator that simply wants
674880	678560	to regulate the free and open internet into non-existence. While the actual situation is
678560	682800	more nuanced than that. So let's take a look at the point of view of the Title I proponents.
682800	686800	You know that long list in the Huffington Post listing the various misdeeds of the ISPs?
686800	692080	Well, all of those cases prior to 2015 were actually successfully resolved using Title I
692080	696800	regulation, and almost all of them in favour of the consumer. Title I seemed to be working
696800	701280	just fine. Sure, the ISPs were trying some shady shit, but they weren't really getting away with
701280	706480	it. And if the Title II argument is that Title II classification would prevent ISPs from even trying
706480	710560	the shady shit in the first place, well that's a pretty slippery slope to go down. I don't know
710560	716080	about you, but insofar as government regulation is concerned in general, I would rather governments
716080	722000	create a blacklist of grossly unethical practices, instead of a whitelist of pre-approved practices.
722000	725680	Additionally, Title II proponents seem to believe that paid prioritization is a taboo,
725680	730880	that all packets of data must be treated equally. But why? I mean, loading an email or a Reddit
730880	735840	thread certainly doesn't require the same latency as playing video games online or watching Netflix
735840	740800	or streaming to your audience. In any other industry, prioritizing resources based on need
740800	745120	is a no-brainer. And then there's that famous Portugal internet package image, where Title II
745120	749440	proponents say that this excessive bundling with restrictive data caps is where American ISPs will
749440	754560	end up without regulation. Well, notwithstanding the fact that this Portuguese plan doesn't block
754560	759360	access to specific types of content if you don't buy their specialized plans, but instead offers
759360	763040	a faster connection for those types while still maintaining a basic minimum access that is
763040	767600	reasonable, why do you think that this would happen? It didn't happen before 2015, when ISPs
767600	771920	were under Title I. And do you think that an ISP would actually survive in the marketplace if it
771920	776240	attempted to do this sort of thing? Its competitors would eat it alive. So with Title I out of the
776240	781440	way, let's talk about the actual opponents of net neutrality. Not people who want FDC regulation
781440	786080	under Title I. You know, the people who believe that a fully deregulated internet where ISPs can
786080	790000	just do whatever the fuck the market will let them get away with is the best possible way forward.
790000	794800	What's their reasoning? Well, a big one is that net neutrality stifles investment in innovation.
794800	799840	This is a common free market capitalist argument that excessive taxation, strict adherence to
799840	804400	regulation, and large amounts of red tape all contribute to diminished returns on investments,
804400	808480	and that eventually it becomes a net loss for a company to invest in its own business.
808480	812960	Mark Anderson, the inventor of the world's first web browser software, said in an interview with
812960	817680	the Washington Post that, I think that a pure net neutrality view is difficult to sustain if you
817680	821040	also want to have continued investment in broadband networks. If you're a large
821040	825280	telecommunications company right now, you're spending on the order of 20 billion dollars
825280	829120	a year on capital expenditure. You need to know how you're going to get a return on that investment.
829120	833120	If you have these pure net neutrality rules where you can never charge a company like Netflix
833120	836640	anything, you're not ever going to get a return on continued network investment, which means you'll
836640	840400	stop investing in the network. And I would not want to be sitting here 10 or 20 years from now
840400	844960	with the same broadband speeds we're getting today. Additionally, the ability for new competitors to
844960	849360	enter the market also becomes non-existent under net neutrality. The same costs that restrict
849360	853040	larger ISP's ability to invest in their own business prevent smaller competitors from
853040	857440	springing up at all. They simply don't have the ability to start up a new business. In reality,
857440	862560	net neutrality can actually promote monopolies and pricing cabals within the ISP market by making the
862560	867040	cost of new competitors entering the market prohibitively high. The honest reality is,
867040	870880	the physical infrastructure of the internet requires a lot of money to build and maintain,
870880	875280	and somebody has to foot the bill for that. We've got four choices as to who. The ISP's,
875280	879520	the consumer's, the content provider's, or the government. Having the government foot the bill
879520	884000	would effectively nationalize the internet, and I don't think anybody wants that. Under Title II
884000	889120	regulation, the ISP's are forced to foot the bill themselves. Net neutrality demands that all users,
889120	893280	both the consumer and the content provider's, pay the same rate no matter how much data they
893280	897600	actually use. If consumers foot the bill, that means changing the internet package to something
897600	902800	more like mobile packages, with data caps and speed regulations, and even at their worst,
902800	907600	content regulations. It's obvious that consumers don't want this, hell, I don't want this,
907600	912320	but it's not inherently unfair. Imagine if electricity companies did away with the
912320	915840	electricity meters on the side of everyone's houses and just charged us all a flat fee.
915840	919600	Well hey, that sounds good, right? Maybe in the short term it would be, at least for us.
919600	924560	But eventually, the cost of providing simplistic on-off, unmeasured access to everybody would
924560	928400	become so high that either the system would collapse, or the electricity companies would
928400	933280	massively jack everyone's prices up regardless of usage just to cover their expenses. But what
933280	937200	about that fourth option? Charging the content providers for the bandwidth that their consumers
937200	942160	demand. I mean, sites like YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, and Netflix all gobble up way more
942160	947200	bandwidth than email servers or personal websites or blogs. If we don't want to pass the cost onto
947200	952240	the customers, and passing the cost onto the ISP's is untenable in the long term, why don't these
952240	956320	large tech companies pay their way? Why don't they invest in the infrastructure that makes
956320	961040	their businesses viable in the first place? Maybe this is why every single time the topic
961040	965680	of net neutrality comes up, every single tech giant speaks out in favor of it. Maybe it's
965680	970640	because one of the more viable alternatives to a pure net neutrality is one that allows the ISPs
970640	975280	to recoup their investment costs, but places the burden of cost on these tech giants instead of on
975280	980000	the consumers. I mean, these companies certainly are not pro-net neutrality out of some ideological
980000	983920	stance regarding the free and open nature of the internet. All the big social network platforms
983920	987840	are just fine with regulating the internet as long as they are the ones doing the regulating.
987840	991920	We already know from Project Veritas that YouTube manipulates search algorithms so that
991920	996720	pre-approved curated content reaches the front page, the trending list, and so on. We already
996720	1001120	know the debacle that YouTube's yellow monetization sign limited state bullshit has become. We
1001120	1005840	already know that Google uses its power to quash ideas it doesn't like. Here's some excerpts from
1005840	1010320	an article of the same name. The Google salespeople were encouraging Forbes to add Google Plus's
1010320	1014480	social buttons to articles on the site alongside the Facebook light button and the Reddit share
1014480	1018880	button. They said it was important to do so because the Plus recommendations would be a
1018880	1023520	factor in search results, a crucial source of traffic to publishers. This sounded like a news
1023520	1028320	story to me. Google's dominance in search and news gave it tremendous power over publishers.
1028320	1033360	By tying search results to the use of Google Plus, Google was using that muscle to force people to
1033360	1037840	promote its social network. I asked the Google people if I understood correctly. If a publisher
1037840	1042960	didn't want a plus one button on the page, its search results would suffer? The answer was yes.
1042960	1047200	With that, I published a story headlined stick Google Plus buttons on your pages or your surf
1047200	1051520	traffic suffers that included bits of conversation from the meeting. Google promptly flipped out.
1051520	1055520	They never challenged the accuracy of the reporting. Instead, a Google spokesperson told
1055520	1059200	me that I needed to unpublish the story because the meeting had been confidential and that the
1059200	1063280	information discussed there had been subject to a non-disclosure agreement between Google and Forbes.
1063360	1067280	I had signed no such agreement, hadn't been told the meeting was confidential, and I had identified
1067280	1072160	myself as a journalist. It escalated quickly from there. I was told by my higher-ups at Forbes that
1072160	1076000	Google representatives called them saying that the article was problematic and had to come down.
1076000	1079840	The implication was that it might have consequences for Forbes, a troubling possibility
1079840	1084000	given how much traffic came through Google searches and Google News. We already know that
1084000	1087920	Google AdSense has threatened to remove all ad revenue from and disable the account of
1087920	1092800	thelibertyconservative.com if they do not censor their content to Google standards. We already know
1092800	1097200	that YouTube has demonetized all content on its platform regarding the Mandalay Bay shooting,
1097200	1101440	even content where their ad revenue was meant to go to charity, with the official response of
1101440	1106080	no matter the intent, our policy is to not run ads on videos about tragedies. Except when Jimmy
1106080	1110720	Kimmel's video on that same shooting has ads on it. And though this is anecdotal and entirely my
1110720	1115120	own subjective experience, I've noticed that YouTube is far more likely to approve a request
1115120	1120400	to remove the limited monetization state if the video in question has non-skippable ads enabled.
1120400	1124240	I might do a full video on YouTube's shitty practices sometime, there's actually some depth
1124240	1129680	to the topic. We already know Facebook and Twitter are both extremely one-sided in who they ban,
1129680	1133760	what content they allow, what content they promote, and which creators they curate. And
1133760	1138080	what I stated would happen in one of my previous videos, the balkanization of technology, is coming
1138080	1142320	to pass. Free speech alternatives to the big names and internet services are cropping up,
1142320	1146880	they're fighting an uphill battle to be sure, but people are honestly just tired of being censored
1146880	1151200	by the Reddits and Twitters and Facebooks of the world. So yeah, any time a big tech
1151200	1155520	giant makes a post about net neutrality, just tell them to fuck off. They don't want net neutrality,
1155520	1160320	they want to hold the reins instead of the government or the ISPs. And maybe, just maybe
1160320	1165200	there's another reason why. Maybe it's because under Title I, the FTC has the jurisdiction to
1165200	1170400	enforce antitrust and other anti-monopoly laws on these tech giants, not just the ISPs but the
1170400	1174240	Twitters and YouTubes and Facebooks of the world. Yeah, that would be a pretty big reason for these
1174240	1178960	companies to fear Title I regulation, wouldn't it? Can the case be made that Apple or Google
1178960	1183200	or Facebook hold monopolies in their specific markets? Maybe. And there's other arguments as
1183200	1189360	well. Let's take a look at Marsh v. Alabama, a 1946 U.S. Supreme Court case. In the case,
1189360	1193360	the town of Chickasaw was entirely privately owned by the Gulf Shipbuilding Corporation.
1193360	1197040	Though all buildings and roads within the town were company-owned, the roads connected to the
1197040	1202000	state-owned highway and allowed non-employees to pass through the town and use civil services.
1202000	1207120	Ms. Marsh, a Jehovah's Witness, attempted to distribute religious material on the sidewalk
1207120	1211280	in Chickasaw and was arrested on the grounds that because the entire town was privately owned,
1211280	1215360	free speech rights did not apply. The case went to the Supreme Court, where it was ruled that because
1215360	1220000	the Gulf Shipbuilding Corporation held an absolute monopoly on what was colloquially referred to as
1220000	1225040	the town square, that it in function took the role of a municipality. The claim of private property
1225040	1229280	was rejected on the grounds that the Gulf Shipbuilding Corporation had provided access
1229280	1233840	to the town and its infrastructure to any passerby in the past like a municipality would,
1233840	1236960	and as a municipality they were bound to uphold the constitution.
1236960	1243280	In 1996, the Marsh v. Alabama case was raised during the Cyber Promotions v. America Online
1243280	1248160	case. Cyber Promotions wanted to send spam email to all email addresses that ended in
1248160	1253680	at AOL.com. America Online decided to block all emails from Cyber Promotions at the ISP level.
1253680	1257520	Cyber Promotions argued that Marsh v. Alabama set a precedent that private property,
1257520	1261680	if sufficiently opened up to the public to the point that a monopoly on communication existed,
1261680	1266400	must allow for free speech under the previous town square principle. The court disagreed,
1266400	1270960	because AOL servers were only open to the public insofar as they were AOL customers,
1270960	1274400	and this decision paved the way for the legality of the spam filter.
1274400	1278800	But can that same case be made for Facebook or Twitter? Sure, these services are only available
1278800	1283360	to people if they log into their accounts, but unlike AOL servers, it costs nothing to
1283360	1288320	create these accounts. Unlike Netflix, which is a paid service, Facebook, Twitter, Reddit,
1288320	1293120	and YouTube are all caught in the Marsh v. Alabama bind. They're all private entities that hold an
1293120	1297120	absolute monopoly on free speech within their jurisdiction, and they're entirely open to the
1297120	1301440	public, just like Chickasaw was. Maybe the way forward for net neutrality's principles isn't
1301440	1306240	Title II. Maybe it's recognizing the internet as a town square and forcing all of its constituent
1306240	1311200	parts, not just one slice of them, to conform to constitutional law. Of course, if you were to talk
1311200	1315360	to any Title II diehard about any point I've brought up in this video, even the pro-net
1315360	1318800	neutrality points that are anti-Title II, they would treat you like the neo-Nazi,
1318800	1322960	Trump-supporting piece of bigoted capitalist scum that you obviously are. Oh yeah, guys,
1322960	1327680	net neutrality is a race issue, right? Communities of color disproportionately affected? Even if the
1327680	1332480	only change to the internet under Title I is that ISPs offer people even better internet if they can
1332480	1336640	afford it? Well, of course. Internet communism demands that everyone has dial-up in order to
1336640	1341840	avoid inequality. The repeal of net neutrality is an attack on the LGBTQ community? Don't worry,
1341840	1347600	guys, you can still access Grindr on your mobile plan. Docs, Ajit Pai's kids? Yeah, sure, why the
1347600	1352800	fuck not? I wonder if all these people who are irrationally pro-Title II net neutrality remember
1352800	1357280	SOPA and PIPA. Yeah, yeah, remember that shit? Remember when the government tried to regulate
1357280	1361360	the internet and everyone lost their minds over it? Remember the outcry against the NSA? What
1361360	1365520	happened that made you guys suddenly beg and kick and scream for government regulation of the
1365520	1368720	internet? And you know, now that we're on the topic of going completely off the rails into
1368720	1372640	insanity land, I'd like to present you with a crackpot conspiracy theory and let you make up
1372640	1377120	your own mind about it. Title II regulation allows the government to force ISPs into obtaining
1377120	1382560	broadcasting licenses, like with radio and TV. Obama pushes for this classification in 2015,
1382560	1386480	along with other SOPA and PIPA provisions that were rejected by the electorate. This package
1386480	1391200	of shit is rebranded as net neutrality, and ISPs get placed under the Title II umbrella.
1391200	1397680	On December 23rd, 2016, Obama signs the 2017 National Defense Authorization Act into law.
1397680	1401440	As a bundle, this act also contains the Countering Information Warfare Act,
1401440	1405280	introduced by Congress on May 10th, 2016. Let's take a peek at it.
1405280	1408560	The Secretary of State, in coordination with the Secretary of Defense and the heads of other
1408560	1412720	relevant federal departments and agencies, shall establish within the Department of State a Global
1412720	1418000	Engagement Center, in this section referred to as The Center. The purpose of The Center
1418000	1423040	shall be to analyze relevant information, data, analysis, and analytics from United States
1423040	1428000	government agencies, United States allies and partner nations, think tanks, academic
1428000	1434320	institutions, civil society groups, and other non-governmental organizations, in order to lead,
1434320	1438560	synchronize, and coordinate efforts of the federal government to recognize, understand,
1438560	1444400	expose, and counter foreign state and non-state propaganda and disinformation efforts aimed at
1444400	1447920	undermining United States national security interests. The legislation declares that the
1447920	1452720	head of The Center will be housed within the White House instead of being independent like most other
1452720	1456720	centers created in this way, that the head will answer directly to the president, and that The
1456720	1461760	Center will allow the president to use whole-of-government approaches to combat what it labels
1461760	1467520	as basically fake news. Maybe this is a bit of a stretch, but just think about it for a minute.
1467520	1472880	ISPs are required to have broadcast licenses under Title II. ISPs become legally required to take
1472880	1479600	down whatever the Global Engagement Center, or The Center, deems as state or non-state propaganda,
1479600	1484400	meaning not just Russian or Chinese propaganda efforts, but your posts to The Donald, the
1484400	1490560	Breitbart articles you read, the 4chan boards you lurk. If the ISP refuses to do so, the FCC revokes
1490560	1494240	their broadcasting license. And around the same time all this stuff is being pushed through
1494240	1499120	Congress, social media companies start revving up their internal policing like Twitter partnering
1499120	1505120	with Crash Override, or the Google Ideas team being full of SJWs, and others, and these groups
1505120	1509120	are getting played under this legislation as well. The Center can declare those groups as
1509120	1513680	third-party fact-checkers because business considers them to be, and The Center can use
1513680	1518560	their standards to force ISPs under Title II to remove content and restrict access based on the
1518560	1523520	individual being a propagandist. And over the past five years, the internet-using public has largely
1523520	1528320	become acclimatized to this idea. We find social media platforms having third-party fact-checking
1528320	1533360	teams, fake news combatants, and hate speech provisions as silly, but not silly enough for
1533360	1538480	a large-scale boycott. The idea of regulating the internet has shifted from unpopular to necessary,
1538480	1543120	SOPA to net neutrality. And just like I said in a previous video, the free speech problem,
1543120	1547680	blocking hate speech is now considered a more primary right than allowing free speech. To make
1547680	1551760	this go fully into tinfoil hat territory, let me present one more quote from this piece of
1551760	1556480	legislation. The Center shall terminate on the date that is eight years after the date of the
1556480	1563360	enactment of this act. Obama thought Hillary would win, so much so that he entrusted her
1563360	1567520	upcoming presidency with the power to declare anything on the internet or in the media as fake
1567520	1572800	news, and not only censor it, but revoke internet access to both individuals and organizations,
1572800	1577920	because The Center is legally obligated to listen to the radical left-leaning fact-checking teams
1577920	1582720	within tech giants that label anything against their views as fascism and nazism. And they can
1582720	1587760	do all of this without a court order. Now I know this is all just tinfoil hat conspiracy theory,
1587760	1591120	but there's just enough actual legislation to make you think about it for a minute.
1591120	1596400	And on this issue, I am actually glad Donald Trump won the election. Under his direction,
1596400	1602240	Ajit Pai has reclassified ISPs as Title I, and the only mention of fake news from his administration
1602240	1606400	has been him shitposting about it on Twitter. Ultimately, I believe that the internet does
1606400	1611280	need some common-sense regulation, but I don't think that Title II is the way to go. Personally,
1611280	1615440	I believe that two of the three net neutrality principles are ultimately good for consumers
1615920	1620640	— no blocking and no throttling — while the third, no paid prioritization, is probably bad
1620640	1624240	for consumers in the long run. I personally like the idea of being able to pay more for
1624240	1628960	hyperfast internet or specialized usage packages that provide good specific benefits while still
1628960	1633840	maintaining a solid minimum level of quality. And hey, while I was recording this script,
1633840	1637360	it came out that the US Senate is trying a last-ditch attempt to keep the Title II
1637360	1641520	regulation on the books. Though of course, the media bills this not as Title II but as net
1641520	1646160	neutrality, I guess you can see what side they've chosen. In any case, it's not over yet, but I hope
1646160	1650320	I've done an accurate enough job at presenting the case for Title II regulation, Title I regulation,
1650320	1654800	and no regulation at all, and I recommend you all come to your own conclusions. I just personally
1654800	1657840	think that none of these options are going to be good enough for the health of the internet.
1657840	1660160	Not in the long term. We need something new.
