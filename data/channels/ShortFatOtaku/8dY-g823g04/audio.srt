1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,880
On January 4th, 2018, the Federal Communications Commission, or FCC,

2
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:09,840
released its final net neutrality repeal order. This capped off months of discussion on the topic

3
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:15,520
of net neutrality, which had previously come to a head on December 14th, 2017. But even before that,

4
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:18,560
net neutrality had been floating around the political discourse for several years,

5
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:24,080
in one form or another. What exactly is net neutrality? Well, here's Wikipedia's definition.

6
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:27,920
Net neutrality is the principle that internet service providers must treat all data on the

7
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:33,840
internet the same, and not discriminate or charge differently by user, content, website, platform,

8
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:38,320
application, type of attached equipment, or method of communication. For instance,

9
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:42,560
under these principles, internet service providers are unable to intentionally block,

10
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:47,600
slow down, or charge money for specific websites and online content. That sounds like a reasonable

11
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:52,480
description of net neutrality to me, and at first glance it would seem unthinkable that somebody

12
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:56,800
would oppose these principles. In fact, if you were to take a good hard look at the history of

13
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:01,360
ISP behaviors and FCC actions against these behaviors since the beginning of the publicly

14
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:06,720
available internet in the mid 1990s, it's not hard to see why so many people are supporters of net

15
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:13,120
neutrality. In 1996, Congress passed the Telecommunications Act. In section 230, titled

16
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:16,960
Protection for Private Blocking and Screening of Offensive Material, the legal status of the

17
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:21,040
internet is brought up, with Congress taking an entirely hands-off approach regarding the

18
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:25,440
regulation of the internet. A myriad of private lawsuits involving internet and tech companies

19
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:29,680
began to build up, and when it became clear that the Telecommunications Act was providing no help,

20
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:34,560
the FCC decided to commission a study of the internet in 1998. This study, titled the Cable

21
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:40,080
Modem Order, released in 2002. In section 3, a basic framework for the regulation of the internet

22
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:45,120
was introduced, alongside a criticism of Congress and its 1996 Telecommunications Act for not

23
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:49,440
properly handling the issue. The Communications Act does not clearly indicate how cable modem

24
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:53,200
service should be classified or regulated. The relevant statutory provisions do not yield

25
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:57,520
easy or obvious answers to the questions at hand, and the case law interpreting those provisions is

26
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:01,840
extensive and complex. The technologies and business models used to provide cable modem

27
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:06,480
service are also complex and are still evolving. As the Supreme Court recently observed in its

28
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:10,240
connection with the Commission's interpretation of the Poll Attachment Act and its application

29
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:15,680
to cable modem service, the subject matter here is technical, complex, and dynamic. And as a general

30
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:20,800
rule, agencies have the authority to fill gaps where statutes are silent. As a follow-up to this,

31
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:26,320
in 2005, the FCC released the Internet Policy Statement. Section 2 of this statement reads

32
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:31,440
as follows. The Communications Act, passed in 1934, charges the Commission with regulating

33
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:36,560
interstate and foreign commerce in communication by wire and radio. The Communications Act regulates

34
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:41,680
telecommunications carriers as common carriers under Title II. Information service providers,

35
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:46,400
by contrast, are not subject to mandatory common carrier regulation under Title II. The Commission,

36
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:51,680
however, has jurisdiction to impose additional regulatory obligations under its Title I

37
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:56,240
ancillary jurisdiction to regulate interstate and foreign communications. As a result,

38
00:02:56,240 --> 00:03:00,240
the Commission has jurisdiction necessary to ensure that providers of telecommunications

39
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:05,840
for Internet access or Internet Protocol-enabled, IP-enabled services are operated in a neutral

40
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:10,720
manner. Moreover, to ensure that broadband networks are widely deployed, open, affordable,

41
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:15,120
and accessible to all consumers, the Commission adopts the following principles. To encourage

42
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:18,960
broadband deployment and preserve and promote the open and interconnected nature of the public

43
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:23,040
Internet, consumers are entitled to access the lawful Internet content of their choice.

44
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:27,280
Consumers are entitled to run applications and use services of their choice, subject to the needs

45
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:31,200
of law enforcement. Consumers are entitled to connect their choice of legal devices that do not

46
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:36,480
harm the network. And consumers are entitled to competition among network providers, application

47
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:41,280
and service providers, and content providers. This is all nicely summed up in Section III.

48
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:46,240
The Commission has a duty to preserve and promote the vibrant and open character of the Internet

49
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:50,480
as the telecommunications marketplace enters the broadband age. And just so we're clear,

50
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:55,680
services classified under Title I are information services and subject to regulation by the Federal

51
00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:01,280
Trade Commission or FTC, while services classified under Title II are telecommunications services

52
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:06,720
or common carriers and instead subject to FCC regulation. Title III refers to the regulation

53
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:11,440
of signals to Earth-orbiting satellites, and Titles IV through VI discuss implementation of

54
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:16,160
the law and special case scenarios. Title I information services are lightly regulated,

55
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:21,200
while Title II common carriers are heavily regulated. A common carrier refers to a service

56
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:24,560
provider to the general public without discrimination for the greater public good,

57
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:29,280
in contrast with private carriers which have more freedom regarding who they serve and for what

58
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:35,360
price. In 2010, during a lawsuit between Comcast and the FCC, the judge ruled that the FCC had

59
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:39,120
overstepped its bounds in attempting to regulate Comcast's shitty business practices, because

60
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:45,200
Internet Service Providers, or ISPs, were regulated by the FTC under Title I, not the FCC under Title

61
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:50,160
II. In response, the FCC released the Open Internet Order, and while it can be somewhat

62
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:54,160
technical, a basic layman's description is provided in the preamble. To provide greater

63
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:58,240
clarity and certainty regarding the continued freedom and openness of the Internet, we adopt

64
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:02,800
three basic rules that are grounded in broadly accepted Internet norms, as well as our own prior

65
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:08,320
decisions. 1. Transparency. Fixed and mobile broadband providers must disclose the network

66
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:12,800
management practices, performance characteristics, and terms and conditions of their broadband

67
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:18,880
services. 2. No blocking. Fixed broadband providers may not block lawful content, applications,

68
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:24,560
services, or non-harmful devices. Mobile broadband providers may not block lawful websites or block

69
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:29,760
applications that compete with their voice or video telephony services. 3. No unreasonable

70
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:34,160
discrimination. Fixed broadband providers may not unreasonably discriminate in transmitting

71
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:38,720
lawful network traffic. We believe these rules, applied with the contemporary principle of

72
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:43,200
reasonable network management, will empower and protect consumers and innovators, while helping

73
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:47,520
ensure that the Internet continues to flourish with robust private investment and rapid innovation

74
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:53,120
at both the core and the edge of the network. Soon after, Verizon sued the FCC under the same logic

75
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:57,440
that they didn't have the right to regulate ISPs under Title II, as ISPs were designated Title I

76
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:01,600
information services and not Title II common carriers. The judge would eventually rule in

77
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:07,040
2014 that while the court agreed that ISPs needed to be regulated in the manner that the FCC

78
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:12,960
described, the FCC still didn't have the authority to do so, which would lead, in 2015, to the FCC

79
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:18,560
reclassifying ISPs as common carriers under Title II with the support of President Obama. In 2015,

80
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:23,200
the FCC released the Net Neutrality Order outlining three specific practices that ISPs

81
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:27,840
would need to follow going forward. 1. No blocking. A person engaged in the provision

82
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:32,400
of broadband Internet access service, insofar as such a person is so engaged, shall not block

83
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:37,120
lawful content, applications, services, or non-harmful devices subject to reasonable

84
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:41,760
network management. 2. No throttling. A person engaged in the provision of broadband Internet

85
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:46,080
access service, insofar as such a person is so engaged, shall not impair or degrade lawful

86
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:50,560
Internet traffic on the basis of Internet content, application, or service, or use of a non-harmful

87
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:55,920
device subject to reasonable network management. 3. No paid prioritization. A person engaged in

88
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:59,920
the provision of broadband Internet access service, insofar as such a person is so engaged,

89
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:04,560
shall not engage in paid prioritization. The logic of the first rule is self-evident. People

90
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:08,960
expect to be able to access the whole Internet when they pay their ISP for Internet access.

91
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:14,240
Rules 2 and 3 are built on the premise of Rule 1, that an extreme amount of throttling or paid

92
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:19,200
prioritization would in practice violate Rule 1, and so to avoid a slippery slope situation,

93
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:23,200
they simply axe those possibilities. And most recently in the timeline of events,

94
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:29,600
in 2017, the FCC's current chairman, Ajit Pai, released an order putting ISPs back under Title

95
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:34,080
1 as information services and out from under Title 2 as common carriers, effectively reversing

96
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:38,640
the 2015 net neutrality order. And it's this action that has made the Internet lose its

97
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:42,640
collective fucking minds. Now, a lot of net neutrality opponents make the argument that

98
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:48,240
the Internet was just fine before 2015, and that 2017's repeal is not going to bring humanity back

99
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:52,240
into the Dark Ages. And that argument does have some weight to it. I'm sure we can all remember

100
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:57,680
the Internet pre-2015, and it was basically the same thing as it was after 2015. But at the same

101
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:03,360
time, the pre-2015 Internet wasn't a paradise either. In 2014, The Huffington Post released

102
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:08,000
an article titled Net Blocking, a Problem in Need of a Solution. And in this article is a timeline

103
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:13,280
of the many instances of ISPs not only blocking, throttling, or offering paid prioritization,

104
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:18,080
but refusing to tell their customers about it. In 2005, a local Madison River ISP blocked

105
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:22,640
the VoIP service Vonage, Comcast blocked all peer-to-peer applications, and Telus blocked

106
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:27,520
access to 766 individual websites that exposed political opinions that the management of Telus

107
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:32,720
personally disagreed with, including a website supporting a labor strike against Telus. In 2007,

108
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:37,680
AT&T forced Apple to block all VoIP applications on the iPhone, wanting people to use their phone

109
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:42,640
services instead. In 2010, Windstream Communications began redirecting Google searches into their own

110
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:48,160
proprietary search engine. In 2011, Metro PC's blockstreaming video from all sources except

111
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:55,920
YouTube. The ISP's Cavalier, Cogent, Frontier, Fuse, DirectPC, RCN, and WideOpenWest were found

112
00:08:55,920 --> 00:09:01,120
to be redirecting search queries through the proprietary search engine Paxfire. And AT&T,

113
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:06,080
Sprint, and Verizon blocked access to Google Wallet in favor of their own online payment

114
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:12,560
service, unfortunately named ISIS. In 2012, Verizon blocked free tethering applications

115
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:17,840
in favor of its own $20 tethering service. And AT&T blocked access to FaceTime unless

116
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:22,800
customers subscribed to a specific, more expensive payment plan. Oh yeah, and in 2013,

117
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:27,520
Verizon explicitly admitted in court that the only reason they weren't just charging a whole

118
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:32,400
whack of money for piecemeal, downgraded internet services is due to the FCC's attempts to regulate

119
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:36,400
it. Admittedly, some of these instances are from the mobile services of these companies,

120
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:41,680
and not their ISP division. However, even as their shitty internet practices were regulated from 2015

121
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:47,280
to 2017, their shitty mobile practices continued to degrade in quality. In this time, Verizon

122
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:51,680
prevented third-party SIM cards from working, they blocked the Pay with PayPal app, the Whitepages

123
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:56,720
free caller ID app, and all Radio FM apps. T-Mobile throttled speed on all unlimited plans,

124
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:01,600
and a formal investigation into AT&T's business practices began. You would be a fool to think

125
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:05,280
that these companies wouldn't do the same thing with their internet services if they could.

126
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:10,800
So this is, as far as I can tell, the bulk of the pro-net neutrality argument. ISPs have a history

127
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:14,960
of duplicitous business practices, and the FCC has been attempting to rein them in at every turn.

128
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:19,760
The net neutrality principles of no blocking, no throttling, and no paid prioritization are

129
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:24,000
ultimately in the public good, because they ensure that everyone gets access to the same internet.

130
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Net neutrality proponents often explain these principles with the highway analogy.

131
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,480
With speed bumps in the slow lane, and fast lanes open only for those who can afford to pay.

132
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:36,320
But let's give the devil his due here, let's take a look at what the opponents of net neutrality

133
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:41,200
have to say. Well, first of all, the phrase opponents of net neutrality doesn't necessarily

134
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:45,680
work in this context. There are a lot of people who are pro-net neutrality's principles,

135
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:51,120
and still believe that a JIT Pai's action to return ISPs to their pre-2015 Title I state was

136
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:54,880
ultimately a good thing. These people still believe in the values of net neutrality,

137
00:10:54,880 --> 00:11:00,720
but ultimately believe that FTC regulation under Title I, and not FCC regulation under Title II,

138
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:05,520
is the best way to get us there. Unfortunately, both the mainstream media and the new internet

139
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:09,760
media, in a rare instance of cooperation between the two, has tarred and feathered anybody who

140
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:14,880
dislikes Title II regulation of ISPs as an anti-net neutrality totalitarian dictator that simply wants

141
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:18,560
to regulate the free and open internet into non-existence. While the actual situation is

142
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:22,800
more nuanced than that. So let's take a look at the point of view of the Title I proponents.

143
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:26,800
You know that long list in the Huffington Post listing the various misdeeds of the ISPs?

144
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:32,080
Well, all of those cases prior to 2015 were actually successfully resolved using Title I

145
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:36,800
regulation, and almost all of them in favour of the consumer. Title I seemed to be working

146
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:41,280
just fine. Sure, the ISPs were trying some shady shit, but they weren't really getting away with

147
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:46,480
it. And if the Title II argument is that Title II classification would prevent ISPs from even trying

148
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:50,560
the shady shit in the first place, well that's a pretty slippery slope to go down. I don't know

149
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:56,080
about you, but insofar as government regulation is concerned in general, I would rather governments

150
00:11:56,080 --> 00:12:02,000
create a blacklist of grossly unethical practices, instead of a whitelist of pre-approved practices.

151
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,680
Additionally, Title II proponents seem to believe that paid prioritization is a taboo,

152
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:10,880
that all packets of data must be treated equally. But why? I mean, loading an email or a Reddit

153
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:15,840
thread certainly doesn't require the same latency as playing video games online or watching Netflix

154
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:20,800
or streaming to your audience. In any other industry, prioritizing resources based on need

155
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:25,120
is a no-brainer. And then there's that famous Portugal internet package image, where Title II

156
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:29,440
proponents say that this excessive bundling with restrictive data caps is where American ISPs will

157
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:34,560
end up without regulation. Well, notwithstanding the fact that this Portuguese plan doesn't block

158
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:39,360
access to specific types of content if you don't buy their specialized plans, but instead offers

159
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:43,040
a faster connection for those types while still maintaining a basic minimum access that is

160
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:47,600
reasonable, why do you think that this would happen? It didn't happen before 2015, when ISPs

161
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:51,920
were under Title I. And do you think that an ISP would actually survive in the marketplace if it

162
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:56,240
attempted to do this sort of thing? Its competitors would eat it alive. So with Title I out of the

163
00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:01,440
way, let's talk about the actual opponents of net neutrality. Not people who want FDC regulation

164
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:06,080
under Title I. You know, the people who believe that a fully deregulated internet where ISPs can

165
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:10,000
just do whatever the fuck the market will let them get away with is the best possible way forward.

166
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,800
What's their reasoning? Well, a big one is that net neutrality stifles investment in innovation.

167
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:19,840
This is a common free market capitalist argument that excessive taxation, strict adherence to

168
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:24,400
regulation, and large amounts of red tape all contribute to diminished returns on investments,

169
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:28,480
and that eventually it becomes a net loss for a company to invest in its own business.

170
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:32,960
Mark Anderson, the inventor of the world's first web browser software, said in an interview with

171
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:37,680
the Washington Post that, I think that a pure net neutrality view is difficult to sustain if you

172
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:41,040
also want to have continued investment in broadband networks. If you're a large

173
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:45,280
telecommunications company right now, you're spending on the order of 20 billion dollars

174
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:49,120
a year on capital expenditure. You need to know how you're going to get a return on that investment.

175
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:53,120
If you have these pure net neutrality rules where you can never charge a company like Netflix

176
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:56,640
anything, you're not ever going to get a return on continued network investment, which means you'll

177
00:13:56,640 --> 00:14:00,400
stop investing in the network. And I would not want to be sitting here 10 or 20 years from now

178
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:04,960
with the same broadband speeds we're getting today. Additionally, the ability for new competitors to

179
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:09,360
enter the market also becomes non-existent under net neutrality. The same costs that restrict

180
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:13,040
larger ISP's ability to invest in their own business prevent smaller competitors from

181
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:17,440
springing up at all. They simply don't have the ability to start up a new business. In reality,

182
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:22,560
net neutrality can actually promote monopolies and pricing cabals within the ISP market by making the

183
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:27,040
cost of new competitors entering the market prohibitively high. The honest reality is,

184
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:30,880
the physical infrastructure of the internet requires a lot of money to build and maintain,

185
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:35,280
and somebody has to foot the bill for that. We've got four choices as to who. The ISP's,

186
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:39,520
the consumer's, the content provider's, or the government. Having the government foot the bill

187
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:44,000
would effectively nationalize the internet, and I don't think anybody wants that. Under Title II

188
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:49,120
regulation, the ISP's are forced to foot the bill themselves. Net neutrality demands that all users,

189
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:53,280
both the consumer and the content provider's, pay the same rate no matter how much data they

190
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:57,600
actually use. If consumers foot the bill, that means changing the internet package to something

191
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:02,800
more like mobile packages, with data caps and speed regulations, and even at their worst,

192
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:07,600
content regulations. It's obvious that consumers don't want this, hell, I don't want this,

193
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:12,320
but it's not inherently unfair. Imagine if electricity companies did away with the

194
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:15,840
electricity meters on the side of everyone's houses and just charged us all a flat fee.

195
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:19,600
Well hey, that sounds good, right? Maybe in the short term it would be, at least for us.

196
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:24,560
But eventually, the cost of providing simplistic on-off, unmeasured access to everybody would

197
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:28,400
become so high that either the system would collapse, or the electricity companies would

198
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:33,280
massively jack everyone's prices up regardless of usage just to cover their expenses. But what

199
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:37,200
about that fourth option? Charging the content providers for the bandwidth that their consumers

200
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:42,160
demand. I mean, sites like YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, and Netflix all gobble up way more

201
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:47,200
bandwidth than email servers or personal websites or blogs. If we don't want to pass the cost onto

202
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:52,240
the customers, and passing the cost onto the ISP's is untenable in the long term, why don't these

203
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:56,320
large tech companies pay their way? Why don't they invest in the infrastructure that makes

204
00:15:56,320 --> 00:16:01,040
their businesses viable in the first place? Maybe this is why every single time the topic

205
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:05,680
of net neutrality comes up, every single tech giant speaks out in favor of it. Maybe it's

206
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:10,640
because one of the more viable alternatives to a pure net neutrality is one that allows the ISPs

207
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:15,280
to recoup their investment costs, but places the burden of cost on these tech giants instead of on

208
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:20,000
the consumers. I mean, these companies certainly are not pro-net neutrality out of some ideological

209
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,920
stance regarding the free and open nature of the internet. All the big social network platforms

210
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:27,840
are just fine with regulating the internet as long as they are the ones doing the regulating.

211
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:31,920
We already know from Project Veritas that YouTube manipulates search algorithms so that

212
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:36,720
pre-approved curated content reaches the front page, the trending list, and so on. We already

213
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:41,120
know the debacle that YouTube's yellow monetization sign limited state bullshit has become. We

214
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:45,840
already know that Google uses its power to quash ideas it doesn't like. Here's some excerpts from

215
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:50,320
an article of the same name. The Google salespeople were encouraging Forbes to add Google Plus's

216
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:54,480
social buttons to articles on the site alongside the Facebook light button and the Reddit share

217
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:58,880
button. They said it was important to do so because the Plus recommendations would be a

218
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:03,520
factor in search results, a crucial source of traffic to publishers. This sounded like a news

219
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:08,320
story to me. Google's dominance in search and news gave it tremendous power over publishers.

220
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:13,360
By tying search results to the use of Google Plus, Google was using that muscle to force people to

221
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:17,840
promote its social network. I asked the Google people if I understood correctly. If a publisher

222
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:22,960
didn't want a plus one button on the page, its search results would suffer? The answer was yes.

223
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:27,200
With that, I published a story headlined stick Google Plus buttons on your pages or your surf

224
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:31,520
traffic suffers that included bits of conversation from the meeting. Google promptly flipped out.

225
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:35,520
They never challenged the accuracy of the reporting. Instead, a Google spokesperson told

226
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:39,200
me that I needed to unpublish the story because the meeting had been confidential and that the

227
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:43,280
information discussed there had been subject to a non-disclosure agreement between Google and Forbes.

228
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:47,280
I had signed no such agreement, hadn't been told the meeting was confidential, and I had identified

229
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:52,160
myself as a journalist. It escalated quickly from there. I was told by my higher-ups at Forbes that

230
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:56,000
Google representatives called them saying that the article was problematic and had to come down.

231
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,840
The implication was that it might have consequences for Forbes, a troubling possibility

232
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:04,000
given how much traffic came through Google searches and Google News. We already know that

233
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,920
Google AdSense has threatened to remove all ad revenue from and disable the account of

234
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:12,800
thelibertyconservative.com if they do not censor their content to Google standards. We already know

235
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:17,200
that YouTube has demonetized all content on its platform regarding the Mandalay Bay shooting,

236
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:21,440
even content where their ad revenue was meant to go to charity, with the official response of

237
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:26,080
no matter the intent, our policy is to not run ads on videos about tragedies. Except when Jimmy

238
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:30,720
Kimmel's video on that same shooting has ads on it. And though this is anecdotal and entirely my

239
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:35,120
own subjective experience, I've noticed that YouTube is far more likely to approve a request

240
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:40,400
to remove the limited monetization state if the video in question has non-skippable ads enabled.

241
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:44,240
I might do a full video on YouTube's shitty practices sometime, there's actually some depth

242
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:49,680
to the topic. We already know Facebook and Twitter are both extremely one-sided in who they ban,

243
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:53,760
what content they allow, what content they promote, and which creators they curate. And

244
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:58,080
what I stated would happen in one of my previous videos, the balkanization of technology, is coming

245
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:02,320
to pass. Free speech alternatives to the big names and internet services are cropping up,

246
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:06,880
they're fighting an uphill battle to be sure, but people are honestly just tired of being censored

247
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:11,200
by the Reddits and Twitters and Facebooks of the world. So yeah, any time a big tech

248
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:15,520
giant makes a post about net neutrality, just tell them to fuck off. They don't want net neutrality,

249
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:20,320
they want to hold the reins instead of the government or the ISPs. And maybe, just maybe

250
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:25,200
there's another reason why. Maybe it's because under Title I, the FTC has the jurisdiction to

251
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:30,400
enforce antitrust and other anti-monopoly laws on these tech giants, not just the ISPs but the

252
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:34,240
Twitters and YouTubes and Facebooks of the world. Yeah, that would be a pretty big reason for these

253
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:38,960
companies to fear Title I regulation, wouldn't it? Can the case be made that Apple or Google

254
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:43,200
or Facebook hold monopolies in their specific markets? Maybe. And there's other arguments as

255
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:49,360
well. Let's take a look at Marsh v. Alabama, a 1946 U.S. Supreme Court case. In the case,

256
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:53,360
the town of Chickasaw was entirely privately owned by the Gulf Shipbuilding Corporation.

257
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:57,040
Though all buildings and roads within the town were company-owned, the roads connected to the

258
00:19:57,040 --> 00:20:02,000
state-owned highway and allowed non-employees to pass through the town and use civil services.

259
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:07,120
Ms. Marsh, a Jehovah's Witness, attempted to distribute religious material on the sidewalk

260
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:11,280
in Chickasaw and was arrested on the grounds that because the entire town was privately owned,

261
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:15,360
free speech rights did not apply. The case went to the Supreme Court, where it was ruled that because

262
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:20,000
the Gulf Shipbuilding Corporation held an absolute monopoly on what was colloquially referred to as

263
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:25,040
the town square, that it in function took the role of a municipality. The claim of private property

264
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:29,280
was rejected on the grounds that the Gulf Shipbuilding Corporation had provided access

265
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:33,840
to the town and its infrastructure to any passerby in the past like a municipality would,

266
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:36,960
and as a municipality they were bound to uphold the constitution.

267
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:43,280
In 1996, the Marsh v. Alabama case was raised during the Cyber Promotions v. America Online

268
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:48,160
case. Cyber Promotions wanted to send spam email to all email addresses that ended in

269
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:53,680
at AOL.com. America Online decided to block all emails from Cyber Promotions at the ISP level.

270
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:57,520
Cyber Promotions argued that Marsh v. Alabama set a precedent that private property,

271
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:01,680
if sufficiently opened up to the public to the point that a monopoly on communication existed,

272
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:06,400
must allow for free speech under the previous town square principle. The court disagreed,

273
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:10,960
because AOL servers were only open to the public insofar as they were AOL customers,

274
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:14,400
and this decision paved the way for the legality of the spam filter.

275
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:18,800
But can that same case be made for Facebook or Twitter? Sure, these services are only available

276
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:23,360
to people if they log into their accounts, but unlike AOL servers, it costs nothing to

277
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:28,320
create these accounts. Unlike Netflix, which is a paid service, Facebook, Twitter, Reddit,

278
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:33,120
and YouTube are all caught in the Marsh v. Alabama bind. They're all private entities that hold an

279
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:37,120
absolute monopoly on free speech within their jurisdiction, and they're entirely open to the

280
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:41,440
public, just like Chickasaw was. Maybe the way forward for net neutrality's principles isn't

281
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:46,240
Title II. Maybe it's recognizing the internet as a town square and forcing all of its constituent

282
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:51,200
parts, not just one slice of them, to conform to constitutional law. Of course, if you were to talk

283
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:55,360
to any Title II diehard about any point I've brought up in this video, even the pro-net

284
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:58,800
neutrality points that are anti-Title II, they would treat you like the neo-Nazi,

285
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:02,960
Trump-supporting piece of bigoted capitalist scum that you obviously are. Oh yeah, guys,

286
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:07,680
net neutrality is a race issue, right? Communities of color disproportionately affected? Even if the

287
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:12,480
only change to the internet under Title I is that ISPs offer people even better internet if they can

288
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:16,640
afford it? Well, of course. Internet communism demands that everyone has dial-up in order to

289
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:21,840
avoid inequality. The repeal of net neutrality is an attack on the LGBTQ community? Don't worry,

290
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:27,600
guys, you can still access Grindr on your mobile plan. Docs, Ajit Pai's kids? Yeah, sure, why the

291
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:32,800
fuck not? I wonder if all these people who are irrationally pro-Title II net neutrality remember

292
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:37,280
SOPA and PIPA. Yeah, yeah, remember that shit? Remember when the government tried to regulate

293
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:41,360
the internet and everyone lost their minds over it? Remember the outcry against the NSA? What

294
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:45,520
happened that made you guys suddenly beg and kick and scream for government regulation of the

295
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:48,720
internet? And you know, now that we're on the topic of going completely off the rails into

296
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:52,640
insanity land, I'd like to present you with a crackpot conspiracy theory and let you make up

297
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:57,120
your own mind about it. Title II regulation allows the government to force ISPs into obtaining

298
00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:02,560
broadcasting licenses, like with radio and TV. Obama pushes for this classification in 2015,

299
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:06,480
along with other SOPA and PIPA provisions that were rejected by the electorate. This package

300
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:11,200
of shit is rebranded as net neutrality, and ISPs get placed under the Title II umbrella.

301
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:17,680
On December 23rd, 2016, Obama signs the 2017 National Defense Authorization Act into law.

302
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:21,440
As a bundle, this act also contains the Countering Information Warfare Act,

303
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:25,280
introduced by Congress on May 10th, 2016. Let's take a peek at it.

304
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:28,560
The Secretary of State, in coordination with the Secretary of Defense and the heads of other

305
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:32,720
relevant federal departments and agencies, shall establish within the Department of State a Global

306
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:38,000
Engagement Center, in this section referred to as The Center. The purpose of The Center

307
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:43,040
shall be to analyze relevant information, data, analysis, and analytics from United States

308
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:48,000
government agencies, United States allies and partner nations, think tanks, academic

309
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:54,320
institutions, civil society groups, and other non-governmental organizations, in order to lead,

310
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:58,560
synchronize, and coordinate efforts of the federal government to recognize, understand,

311
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:04,400
expose, and counter foreign state and non-state propaganda and disinformation efforts aimed at

312
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:07,920
undermining United States national security interests. The legislation declares that the

313
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:12,720
head of The Center will be housed within the White House instead of being independent like most other

314
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:16,720
centers created in this way, that the head will answer directly to the president, and that The

315
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:21,760
Center will allow the president to use whole-of-government approaches to combat what it labels

316
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:27,520
as basically fake news. Maybe this is a bit of a stretch, but just think about it for a minute.

317
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:32,880
ISPs are required to have broadcast licenses under Title II. ISPs become legally required to take

318
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:39,600
down whatever the Global Engagement Center, or The Center, deems as state or non-state propaganda,

319
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:44,400
meaning not just Russian or Chinese propaganda efforts, but your posts to The Donald, the

320
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:50,560
Breitbart articles you read, the 4chan boards you lurk. If the ISP refuses to do so, the FCC revokes

321
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:54,240
their broadcasting license. And around the same time all this stuff is being pushed through

322
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:59,120
Congress, social media companies start revving up their internal policing like Twitter partnering

323
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:05,120
with Crash Override, or the Google Ideas team being full of SJWs, and others, and these groups

324
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:09,120
are getting played under this legislation as well. The Center can declare those groups as

325
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:13,680
third-party fact-checkers because business considers them to be, and The Center can use

326
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:18,560
their standards to force ISPs under Title II to remove content and restrict access based on the

327
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:23,520
individual being a propagandist. And over the past five years, the internet-using public has largely

328
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:28,320
become acclimatized to this idea. We find social media platforms having third-party fact-checking

329
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:33,360
teams, fake news combatants, and hate speech provisions as silly, but not silly enough for

330
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:38,480
a large-scale boycott. The idea of regulating the internet has shifted from unpopular to necessary,

331
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:43,120
SOPA to net neutrality. And just like I said in a previous video, the free speech problem,

332
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:47,680
blocking hate speech is now considered a more primary right than allowing free speech. To make

333
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:51,760
this go fully into tinfoil hat territory, let me present one more quote from this piece of

334
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:56,480
legislation. The Center shall terminate on the date that is eight years after the date of the

335
00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:03,360
enactment of this act. Obama thought Hillary would win, so much so that he entrusted her

336
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:07,520
upcoming presidency with the power to declare anything on the internet or in the media as fake

337
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:12,800
news, and not only censor it, but revoke internet access to both individuals and organizations,

338
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:17,920
because The Center is legally obligated to listen to the radical left-leaning fact-checking teams

339
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:22,720
within tech giants that label anything against their views as fascism and nazism. And they can

340
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:27,760
do all of this without a court order. Now I know this is all just tinfoil hat conspiracy theory,

341
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:31,120
but there's just enough actual legislation to make you think about it for a minute.

342
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:36,400
And on this issue, I am actually glad Donald Trump won the election. Under his direction,

343
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:42,240
Ajit Pai has reclassified ISPs as Title I, and the only mention of fake news from his administration

344
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:46,400
has been him shitposting about it on Twitter. Ultimately, I believe that the internet does

345
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:51,280
need some common-sense regulation, but I don't think that Title II is the way to go. Personally,

346
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:55,440
I believe that two of the three net neutrality principles are ultimately good for consumers

347
00:26:55,920 --> 00:27:00,640
— no blocking and no throttling — while the third, no paid prioritization, is probably bad

348
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:04,240
for consumers in the long run. I personally like the idea of being able to pay more for

349
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:08,960
hyperfast internet or specialized usage packages that provide good specific benefits while still

350
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:13,840
maintaining a solid minimum level of quality. And hey, while I was recording this script,

351
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:17,360
it came out that the US Senate is trying a last-ditch attempt to keep the Title II

352
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:21,520
regulation on the books. Though of course, the media bills this not as Title II but as net

353
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:26,160
neutrality, I guess you can see what side they've chosen. In any case, it's not over yet, but I hope

354
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:30,320
I've done an accurate enough job at presenting the case for Title II regulation, Title I regulation,

355
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:34,800
and no regulation at all, and I recommend you all come to your own conclusions. I just personally

356
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:37,840
think that none of these options are going to be good enough for the health of the internet.

357
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:40,160
Not in the long term. We need something new.
