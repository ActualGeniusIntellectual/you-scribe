1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,760
So Naomi, what are we doing right now?

2
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:10,760
We are looking for seedlings.

3
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:15,080
For the 2022 garden.

4
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:20,200
There's a, it's a little bit low slim pickings right now, but it'll...

5
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:22,840
When we cut back to it, you'll see a whole bunch of seedlings.

6
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:26,960
Man, it's nice to have, it's like the first nice weekend in a long time, eh?

7
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:27,960
Yep.

8
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:28,960
In like six months.

9
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:29,960
Yeah.

10
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:30,960
Hold on.

11
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:31,960
They're Americans.

12
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:32,960
They don't know what Celsius is.

13
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:37,120
Well, the units that make sense, not braided units.

14
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,560
And here's all the plants.

15
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:39,740
It's the next day.

16
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:43,320
We got everything but cucumbers, because they just weren't there.

17
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:45,880
Maybe it's a little bit too early, because right now it's early May.

18
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:47,240
We have a bunch of lettuce.

19
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:48,240
That's going to be new.

20
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:49,240
It's red leaf lettuce.

21
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:50,520
We have peppers that are going in.

22
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:57,600
There's the kale, there's the tomatoes, and there's the peas, and there's the spinach.

23
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:59,280
Wait, we only got like two kale?

24
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,280
No, that's four kale.

25
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:01,280
That's eight kale, actually.

26
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:02,280
Really?

27
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:03,280
Yeah.

28
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:04,280
They're just tinier plants.

29
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:05,280
All right.

30
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,280
So we're going to be setting all this up.

31
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:08,960
Well, actually, first of all, we have to weed the garden.

32
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:10,280
The year always starts with weeding.

33
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:11,280
Oh my God, you see that?

34
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,280
That's like caving in.

35
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:13,280
Yes.

36
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:15,280
We need to fix that.

37
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:16,280
Probably.

38
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:18,280
I guess we're doing that too.

39
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:19,280
Okay.

40
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:20,280
There's things to do.

41
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:23,280
And it already feels like the sun's trying to eat my skin.

42
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:25,280
You had a sunburn a couple days ago.

43
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,280
I already had a sunburn.

44
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:29,960
It's not even officially summer and I've already had a sunburn.

45
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:30,960
It's fine.

46
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:36,960
I'm going to head into the shed and get what we need.

47
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:37,960
Come on.

48
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:40,960
Got the shovel.

49
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:45,360
It's actually new because our other shovel had disappeared randomly.

50
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:49,280
We also need my bags of manure.

51
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,400
This is last year's manure.

52
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,400
It's probably...

53
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,960
I only used half of it.

54
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:56,440
It's probably just basically turned to earth at this point.

55
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:57,600
And this is the fresh one.

56
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:09,200
I don't know if you guys heard those nurses walking down the street just now.

57
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:10,200
We live pretty close to a hospital.

58
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:13,960
They were talking about how the hospital's filled up with heart failures and they're

59
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:17,320
wondering if it's the coronavirus vaccine.

60
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:20,600
The average people working in these places, they're saying this all the time.

61
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:24,680
Anyway, we also need a rake.

62
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:25,680
Here we are.

63
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:31,120
So while Naomi does some weeding there, I am going to do some trimming.

64
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,120
I have these...

65
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,120
What are these?

66
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,120
Snips, I guess?

67
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,120
Pliers?

68
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,120
No.

69
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,120
Not pliers.

70
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,120
What are they called again?

71
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:40,120
Giant scooters.

72
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:42,360
Giant scooters.

73
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:46,440
There's basically along the property line here in the back some trees like to grow in

74
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:48,440
and so I just snip a little bit.

75
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:54,440
There we go.

76
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,200
Almost fell on my head.

77
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:57,200
Wow, guys.

78
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:02,680
So while I was doing this trimming, I actually found my old keys that I lost like two years

79
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:03,680
ago.

80
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,760
I guess that's where they went.

81
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:11,400
So that derelict door from last year is already starting to bend inward.

82
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,400
Doesn't matter too much.

83
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,340
It's probably going to be a problem next year though.

84
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:19,600
The issue is when I first built this garden years ago, along the side of the deck I put

85
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:22,160
a piece of wood in there and it's all rotted away at this point.

86
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:27,840
So I probably need to shovel that out, put a new piece in there and then shovel it back

87
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:28,840
in.

88
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:30,840
This is going to kind of suck.

89
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:36,240
Yep, that was once a full piece of wood but it just disintegrated over the years.

90
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:39,980
It's been I think six years or so, six or seven, since I put it in there.

91
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:46,520
This entire garden is basically just scraps of wood so I guess I'll just get another scrap.

92
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:50,720
So to replace that hole, I pulled this thing out.

93
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:57,080
This is an old curtain rod holder that I yanked out of the living room years ago.

94
00:03:57,080 --> 00:04:00,680
And so that's going to be your purpose to go in that hole underneath the deck so all

95
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:02,840
the earth doesn't keep spilling underneath the deck.

96
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:07,760
This is why you pack rat things guys, this is why it's good to always hold on to whatever

97
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:10,480
it is that you happen to be getting rid of anyway.

98
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:13,040
Press X to doubt.

99
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:17,520
Well that was a botched job if I ever did one but you know what, it's in and by the

100
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:21,040
time it becomes a problem, we will have moved out.

101
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,040
Hopefully.

102
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:26,000
Yeah, I'll give it a couple of years, it'll be gone by then for sure.

103
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,920
So while Naomi rakes all that up and flattens the garden out, I'm going to shovel in a bunch

104
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:35,480
of the compost that we've accumulated over the year.

105
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:39,480
I'm going to shovel in the compost into this thing, not into the garden.

106
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:44,040
This is just a little planter that was left here by a former tenant years ago.

107
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:46,920
It's just been collecting dust in the back of the shed.

108
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:52,840
I'm going to put the lettuce in this because it's like a baby lettuce, you can just snip

109
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:54,480
and it'll grow like grass.

110
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:56,160
So we're going to try to do that this year.

111
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:02,480
Yeah, compost just like last year is pretty gross, but that's okay.

112
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:03,880
This was hard to open last year too.

113
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:07,960
Oh no, I knocked the top off.

114
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:14,080
Yep, that's all pretty good earth in there.

115
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,920
A year's worth of compost.

116
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:19,840
There's some stuff in there, but it's all pretty much quality earth.

117
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,840
Yeah.

118
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:25,000
So it was pretty full before and now it's about halfway full.

119
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:31,320
I shoveled the bottom half out and I pushed the rest of it down with the shovel and what

120
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:37,280
will end up happening next is this stuff by next year will become that year's compost.

121
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:40,880
It's the circle of life, Naomi.

122
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:52,880
I'm going to grab some water here.

123
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,640
And Naomi's pretty much done raking the garden.

124
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:55,640
It looks great.

125
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:56,880
It looked awful before.

126
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:57,880
Wait, what is that thing?

127
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:00,880
It looks like a peach pit.

128
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:01,880
Avocado pit maybe?

129
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:02,880
I don't think it's an avocado pit.

130
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:03,880
It's too red.

131
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:04,880
It can probably go.

132
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:07,960
We're not going to grow a tree in here, are we?

133
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:08,960
Yes.

134
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:14,840
So there's the planter full up with the compost and last year's manure, which we just kind

135
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:17,180
of had sitting around the shed over the winter.

136
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:21,320
I'm going to put, where is it, Naomi's, here's Naomi drinking more water.

137
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:26,720
I'm going to put this tray of red leaf lettuce in there.

138
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:30,320
Now if you leave red leaf lettuce, I think any lettuce alone long enough, it will eventually

139
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:32,360
become heads of lettuce.

140
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:36,120
If you plant it like a lawn and just trim it, you can just keep getting new leaves out

141
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:39,280
the way that you cut a lawn with grass.

142
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,280
So that's the plan.

143
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:44,400
We're going to stay on top of this this summer and not be losers.

144
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:48,520
And that whole tray will go in there.

145
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:53,220
So just like the last few years, I'm behind the mesh right now, but the peas are going

146
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:54,220
to grow up.

147
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:56,060
They've done that for the last little bit.

148
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:59,640
So what I'll do is right here at the corner, I'll dig a hole.

149
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:01,640
It's got to be deep enough.

150
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:04,000
We'll dig it down.

151
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:09,560
And then just like last year, at the bottom, I put a handful of manure.

152
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:11,760
You didn't want to grow a basil plant this year, did you?

153
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:12,760
No.

154
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:14,360
Yeah, we had too much basil last year.

155
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:16,320
We didn't use half of it.

156
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:20,340
We dried it and froze it and we still haven't used all of it.

157
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:24,360
So because Naomi got so angry at me about using the kitchen scissors for the manure

158
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:27,280
bag, this time I got my produce knife.

159
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:33,240
A long time ago when I used to work in retail, they gave us one of these knives if you worked

160
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,400
in the produce department for free.

161
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:37,760
It is the sharpest nice knife I've ever had.

162
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:39,040
It's sharper than anything.

163
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,760
To be fair, Naomi, we also use this knife in the kitchen.

164
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:41,760
Do you care that much?

165
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:44,760
I don't use that knife in the kitchen, so I don't care.

166
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:45,760
Oh, okay.

167
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:47,760
If you want to use the kitchen knife, that's fine.

168
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:51,760
There we go.

169
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:55,760
I can tell it's fresh manure and not one year old manure because it's still wet.

170
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,240
So you take...

171
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,240
Say moo.

172
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,240
Moo.

173
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,240
Moo.

174
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:03,240
Just put your hand right in it, dude.

175
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:04,240
Like, don't got to worry.

176
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,240
Oh my god, it's gross.

177
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:07,240
Got a clump of that stuff.

178
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:08,440
Peas eggs.

179
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:11,080
You put it right in the hole.

180
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:12,080
That's all you need.

181
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,560
I had to take the peas out with two hands, guys.

182
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:20,240
You couldn't see it, but there's the peas and the peas go right in the hole.

183
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,040
There they are.

184
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:23,040
Put the earth in.

185
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,240
Make sure not to cover them up.

186
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:29,240
And there we go.

187
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:30,240
One pea plant.

188
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,000
Six more to go.

189
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,040
So with the peas in place, since they have to go there every single year, because of

190
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:40,240
the mesh, I'm now thinking about where to put the rest of the stuff because we're only

191
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:43,280
going to get four cucumber plants this time because there's always the complaint that

192
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:44,280
there's...

193
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:45,280
There's always too many.

194
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:46,280
There's always too many cucumbers.

195
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:48,800
So we're going to put those four cucumber plants on the far side of the gardens and

196
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,520
grow up that mesh.

197
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:51,520
Okay.

198
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:52,520
We had tomatoes.

199
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:55,320
I'll just zoom out a bit.

200
00:08:55,360 --> 00:09:03,640
So we had tomatoes over there last, peppers here, and kale back there.

201
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:08,400
And with cucumbers having to always be there and peas having to always be there, we can

202
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:10,740
rotate those three.

203
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:14,120
But also there's the fact that we bought four spinach plants because there's currently a

204
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:16,700
shortage of cucumber plants.

205
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:28,180
So what I might do is I might put those in rows here at the front and then put the tomatoes

206
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:30,540
and peppers in the back.

207
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:31,940
Maybe that's the plan.

208
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:35,500
And the garden is put in right there.

209
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:38,300
Naomi is watering some kale.

210
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:40,220
Eight kale plants.

211
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:42,380
There's four spinach right here.

212
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:45,180
If the sun will cooperate.

213
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:47,780
There's the six peppers.

214
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:48,780
There's the six tomatoes.

215
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:51,300
A little bit of extra lettuce back there.

216
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:56,560
Maybe we'll give it to my parents or something, but that's where the cucumbers will go once

217
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:57,560
we get them.

218
00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:01,100
And of course the peas along the side here.

219
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,100
And the bed of lettuce.

220
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:06,380
That's a lot of lettuce, but it'll probably be okay, actually, if we just keep cutting

221
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:07,560
it regularly.

222
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:09,660
There's Naomi's dirty legs.

223
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:12,420
That's okay because my legs are pretty dirty too.

224
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:14,240
And that is the garden.

225
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:18,320
Welcome back once we have the cucumbers ready to go.

226
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:21,000
But it looks pretty good for, you know, this is actually a little bit early.

227
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,480
Usually we put it in a couple of weeks later than this, but it's been very hot in May.

228
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:28,000
It's already 30 degrees today and it's May, it's early May.

229
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,200
Welcome to global warming guys.

230
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,200
Yeah.

231
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:34,440
Ready for Canada to become a jungle.

232
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,120
Thank you.
