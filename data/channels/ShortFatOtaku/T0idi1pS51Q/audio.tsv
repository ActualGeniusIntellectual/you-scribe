0	7760	So Naomi, what are we doing right now?
7760	10760	We are looking for seedlings.
10760	15080	For the 2022 garden.
15080	20200	There's a, it's a little bit low slim pickings right now, but it'll...
20200	22840	When we cut back to it, you'll see a whole bunch of seedlings.
22840	26960	Man, it's nice to have, it's like the first nice weekend in a long time, eh?
26960	27960	Yep.
27960	28960	In like six months.
28960	29960	Yeah.
29960	30960	Hold on.
30960	31960	They're Americans.
31960	32960	They don't know what Celsius is.
32960	37120	Well, the units that make sense, not braided units.
37120	38560	And here's all the plants.
38560	39740	It's the next day.
39740	43320	We got everything but cucumbers, because they just weren't there.
43320	45880	Maybe it's a little bit too early, because right now it's early May.
45880	47240	We have a bunch of lettuce.
47240	48240	That's going to be new.
48240	49240	It's red leaf lettuce.
49240	50520	We have peppers that are going in.
50520	57600	There's the kale, there's the tomatoes, and there's the peas, and there's the spinach.
57640	59280	Wait, we only got like two kale?
59280	60280	No, that's four kale.
60280	61280	That's eight kale, actually.
61280	62280	Really?
62280	63280	Yeah.
63280	64280	They're just tinier plants.
64280	65280	All right.
65280	66280	So we're going to be setting all this up.
66280	68960	Well, actually, first of all, we have to weed the garden.
68960	70280	The year always starts with weeding.
70280	71280	Oh my God, you see that?
71280	72280	That's like caving in.
72280	73280	Yes.
73280	75280	We need to fix that.
75280	76280	Probably.
76280	78280	I guess we're doing that too.
78280	79280	Okay.
79280	80280	There's things to do.
80280	83280	And it already feels like the sun's trying to eat my skin.
83280	85280	You had a sunburn a couple days ago.
85280	87280	I already had a sunburn.
87960	89960	It's not even officially summer and I've already had a sunburn.
89960	90960	It's fine.
90960	96960	I'm going to head into the shed and get what we need.
96960	97960	Come on.
97960	100960	Got the shovel.
100960	105360	It's actually new because our other shovel had disappeared randomly.
105360	109280	We also need my bags of manure.
109280	110400	This is last year's manure.
110400	111400	It's probably...
111400	112960	I only used half of it.
112960	116440	It's probably just basically turned to earth at this point.
116600	117600	And this is the fresh one.
126600	129200	I don't know if you guys heard those nurses walking down the street just now.
129200	130200	We live pretty close to a hospital.
130200	133960	They were talking about how the hospital's filled up with heart failures and they're
133960	137320	wondering if it's the coronavirus vaccine.
137320	140600	The average people working in these places, they're saying this all the time.
140600	144680	Anyway, we also need a rake.
144680	145680	Here we are.
145920	151120	So while Naomi does some weeding there, I am going to do some trimming.
151120	152120	I have these...
152120	153120	What are these?
153120	154120	Snips, I guess?
154120	155120	Pliers?
155120	156120	No.
156120	157120	Not pliers.
157120	158120	What are they called again?
158120	160120	Giant scooters.
160120	162360	Giant scooters.
162360	166440	There's basically along the property line here in the back some trees like to grow in
166440	168440	and so I just snip a little bit.
172440	174440	There we go.
175200	176200	Almost fell on my head.
176200	177200	Wow, guys.
177200	182680	So while I was doing this trimming, I actually found my old keys that I lost like two years
182680	183680	ago.
183680	185760	I guess that's where they went.
185760	191400	So that derelict door from last year is already starting to bend inward.
191400	192400	Doesn't matter too much.
192400	194340	It's probably going to be a problem next year though.
194340	199600	The issue is when I first built this garden years ago, along the side of the deck I put
199600	202160	a piece of wood in there and it's all rotted away at this point.
202880	207840	So I probably need to shovel that out, put a new piece in there and then shovel it back
207840	208840	in.
208840	210840	This is going to kind of suck.
210840	216240	Yep, that was once a full piece of wood but it just disintegrated over the years.
216240	219980	It's been I think six years or so, six or seven, since I put it in there.
219980	226520	This entire garden is basically just scraps of wood so I guess I'll just get another scrap.
226520	230720	So to replace that hole, I pulled this thing out.
230720	237080	This is an old curtain rod holder that I yanked out of the living room years ago.
237080	240680	And so that's going to be your purpose to go in that hole underneath the deck so all
240680	242840	the earth doesn't keep spilling underneath the deck.
242840	247760	This is why you pack rat things guys, this is why it's good to always hold on to whatever
247760	250480	it is that you happen to be getting rid of anyway.
250480	253040	Press X to doubt.
253040	257520	Well that was a botched job if I ever did one but you know what, it's in and by the
257520	261040	time it becomes a problem, we will have moved out.
261040	262040	Hopefully.
262040	266000	Yeah, I'll give it a couple of years, it'll be gone by then for sure.
266000	270920	So while Naomi rakes all that up and flattens the garden out, I'm going to shovel in a bunch
270920	275480	of the compost that we've accumulated over the year.
275480	279480	I'm going to shovel in the compost into this thing, not into the garden.
279480	284040	This is just a little planter that was left here by a former tenant years ago.
284040	286920	It's just been collecting dust in the back of the shed.
286920	292840	I'm going to put the lettuce in this because it's like a baby lettuce, you can just snip
292840	294480	and it'll grow like grass.
294480	296160	So we're going to try to do that this year.
296160	302480	Yeah, compost just like last year is pretty gross, but that's okay.
302480	303880	This was hard to open last year too.
303880	307960	Oh no, I knocked the top off.
307960	314080	Yep, that's all pretty good earth in there.
314080	315920	A year's worth of compost.
315920	319840	There's some stuff in there, but it's all pretty much quality earth.
319840	321840	Yeah.
321840	325000	So it was pretty full before and now it's about halfway full.
325000	331320	I shoveled the bottom half out and I pushed the rest of it down with the shovel and what
331320	337280	will end up happening next is this stuff by next year will become that year's compost.
337280	340880	It's the circle of life, Naomi.
340880	352880	I'm going to grab some water here.
352880	354640	And Naomi's pretty much done raking the garden.
354640	355640	It looks great.
355640	356880	It looked awful before.
356880	357880	Wait, what is that thing?
357880	360880	It looks like a peach pit.
360880	361880	Avocado pit maybe?
361880	362880	I don't think it's an avocado pit.
362880	363880	It's too red.
363880	364880	It can probably go.
364880	367960	We're not going to grow a tree in here, are we?
367960	368960	Yes.
369040	374840	So there's the planter full up with the compost and last year's manure, which we just kind
374840	377180	of had sitting around the shed over the winter.
377180	381320	I'm going to put, where is it, Naomi's, here's Naomi drinking more water.
381320	386720	I'm going to put this tray of red leaf lettuce in there.
386720	390320	Now if you leave red leaf lettuce, I think any lettuce alone long enough, it will eventually
390320	392360	become heads of lettuce.
392360	396120	If you plant it like a lawn and just trim it, you can just keep getting new leaves out
396280	399280	the way that you cut a lawn with grass.
399280	400280	So that's the plan.
400280	404400	We're going to stay on top of this this summer and not be losers.
404400	408520	And that whole tray will go in there.
408520	413220	So just like the last few years, I'm behind the mesh right now, but the peas are going
413220	414220	to grow up.
414220	416060	They've done that for the last little bit.
416060	419640	So what I'll do is right here at the corner, I'll dig a hole.
419640	421640	It's got to be deep enough.
422640	424000	We'll dig it down.
424000	429560	And then just like last year, at the bottom, I put a handful of manure.
429560	431760	You didn't want to grow a basil plant this year, did you?
431760	432760	No.
432760	434360	Yeah, we had too much basil last year.
434360	436320	We didn't use half of it.
436320	440340	We dried it and froze it and we still haven't used all of it.
440340	444360	So because Naomi got so angry at me about using the kitchen scissors for the manure
444360	447280	bag, this time I got my produce knife.
447280	453240	A long time ago when I used to work in retail, they gave us one of these knives if you worked
453240	454400	in the produce department for free.
454400	457760	It is the sharpest nice knife I've ever had.
457760	459040	It's sharper than anything.
459040	460760	To be fair, Naomi, we also use this knife in the kitchen.
460760	461760	Do you care that much?
461760	464760	I don't use that knife in the kitchen, so I don't care.
464760	465760	Oh, okay.
465760	467760	If you want to use the kitchen knife, that's fine.
470760	471760	There we go.
471760	475760	I can tell it's fresh manure and not one year old manure because it's still wet.
476240	478240	So you take...
478240	479240	Say moo.
479240	480240	Moo.
480240	481240	Moo.
481240	483240	Just put your hand right in it, dude.
483240	484240	Like, don't got to worry.
484240	485240	Oh my god, it's gross.
485240	487240	Got a clump of that stuff.
487240	488440	Peas eggs.
488440	491080	You put it right in the hole.
491080	492080	That's all you need.
492080	493560	I had to take the peas out with two hands, guys.
493560	500240	You couldn't see it, but there's the peas and the peas go right in the hole.
500240	502040	There they are.
502040	503040	Put the earth in.
506240	507240	Make sure not to cover them up.
507240	509240	And there we go.
509240	510240	One pea plant.
510240	512000	Six more to go.
512000	516040	So with the peas in place, since they have to go there every single year, because of
516040	520240	the mesh, I'm now thinking about where to put the rest of the stuff because we're only
520240	523280	going to get four cucumber plants this time because there's always the complaint that
523280	524280	there's...
524280	525280	There's always too many.
525280	526280	There's always too many cucumbers.
526280	528800	So we're going to put those four cucumber plants on the far side of the gardens and
528800	530520	grow up that mesh.
530520	531520	Okay.
531520	532520	We had tomatoes.
532520	535320	I'll just zoom out a bit.
535360	543640	So we had tomatoes over there last, peppers here, and kale back there.
543640	548400	And with cucumbers having to always be there and peas having to always be there, we can
548400	550740	rotate those three.
550740	554120	But also there's the fact that we bought four spinach plants because there's currently a
554120	556700	shortage of cucumber plants.
556700	568180	So what I might do is I might put those in rows here at the front and then put the tomatoes
568180	570540	and peppers in the back.
570540	571940	Maybe that's the plan.
571940	575500	And the garden is put in right there.
575500	578300	Naomi is watering some kale.
578300	580220	Eight kale plants.
580220	582380	There's four spinach right here.
582380	585180	If the sun will cooperate.
585180	587780	There's the six peppers.
587780	588780	There's the six tomatoes.
588780	591300	A little bit of extra lettuce back there.
591300	596560	Maybe we'll give it to my parents or something, but that's where the cucumbers will go once
596560	597560	we get them.
597560	601100	And of course the peas along the side here.
601100	602100	And the bed of lettuce.
602100	606380	That's a lot of lettuce, but it'll probably be okay, actually, if we just keep cutting
606380	607560	it regularly.
607560	609660	There's Naomi's dirty legs.
609660	612420	That's okay because my legs are pretty dirty too.
612420	614240	And that is the garden.
614240	618320	Welcome back once we have the cucumbers ready to go.
618320	621000	But it looks pretty good for, you know, this is actually a little bit early.
621000	624480	Usually we put it in a couple of weeks later than this, but it's been very hot in May.
624480	628000	It's already 30 degrees today and it's May, it's early May.
628000	630200	Welcome to global warming guys.
630200	631200	Yeah.
631200	634440	Ready for Canada to become a jungle.
644240	645120	Thank you.
