WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:07.760
So Naomi, what are we doing right now?

00:07.760 --> 00:10.760
We are looking for seedlings.

00:10.760 --> 00:15.080
For the 2022 garden.

00:15.080 --> 00:20.200
There's a, it's a little bit low slim pickings right now, but it'll...

00:20.200 --> 00:22.840
When we cut back to it, you'll see a whole bunch of seedlings.

00:22.840 --> 00:26.960
Man, it's nice to have, it's like the first nice weekend in a long time, eh?

00:26.960 --> 00:27.960
Yep.

00:27.960 --> 00:28.960
In like six months.

00:28.960 --> 00:29.960
Yeah.

00:29.960 --> 00:30.960
Hold on.

00:30.960 --> 00:31.960
They're Americans.

00:31.960 --> 00:32.960
They don't know what Celsius is.

00:32.960 --> 00:37.120
Well, the units that make sense, not braided units.

00:37.120 --> 00:38.560
And here's all the plants.

00:38.560 --> 00:39.740
It's the next day.

00:39.740 --> 00:43.320
We got everything but cucumbers, because they just weren't there.

00:43.320 --> 00:45.880
Maybe it's a little bit too early, because right now it's early May.

00:45.880 --> 00:47.240
We have a bunch of lettuce.

00:47.240 --> 00:48.240
That's going to be new.

00:48.240 --> 00:49.240
It's red leaf lettuce.

00:49.240 --> 00:50.520
We have peppers that are going in.

00:50.520 --> 00:57.600
There's the kale, there's the tomatoes, and there's the peas, and there's the spinach.

00:57.640 --> 00:59.280
Wait, we only got like two kale?

00:59.280 --> 01:00.280
No, that's four kale.

01:00.280 --> 01:01.280
That's eight kale, actually.

01:01.280 --> 01:02.280
Really?

01:02.280 --> 01:03.280
Yeah.

01:03.280 --> 01:04.280
They're just tinier plants.

01:04.280 --> 01:05.280
All right.

01:05.280 --> 01:06.280
So we're going to be setting all this up.

01:06.280 --> 01:08.960
Well, actually, first of all, we have to weed the garden.

01:08.960 --> 01:10.280
The year always starts with weeding.

01:10.280 --> 01:11.280
Oh my God, you see that?

01:11.280 --> 01:12.280
That's like caving in.

01:12.280 --> 01:13.280
Yes.

01:13.280 --> 01:15.280
We need to fix that.

01:15.280 --> 01:16.280
Probably.

01:16.280 --> 01:18.280
I guess we're doing that too.

01:18.280 --> 01:19.280
Okay.

01:19.280 --> 01:20.280
There's things to do.

01:20.280 --> 01:23.280
And it already feels like the sun's trying to eat my skin.

01:23.280 --> 01:25.280
You had a sunburn a couple days ago.

01:25.280 --> 01:27.280
I already had a sunburn.

01:27.960 --> 01:29.960
It's not even officially summer and I've already had a sunburn.

01:29.960 --> 01:30.960
It's fine.

01:30.960 --> 01:36.960
I'm going to head into the shed and get what we need.

01:36.960 --> 01:37.960
Come on.

01:37.960 --> 01:40.960
Got the shovel.

01:40.960 --> 01:45.360
It's actually new because our other shovel had disappeared randomly.

01:45.360 --> 01:49.280
We also need my bags of manure.

01:49.280 --> 01:50.400
This is last year's manure.

01:50.400 --> 01:51.400
It's probably...

01:51.400 --> 01:52.960
I only used half of it.

01:52.960 --> 01:56.440
It's probably just basically turned to earth at this point.

01:56.600 --> 01:57.600
And this is the fresh one.

02:06.600 --> 02:09.200
I don't know if you guys heard those nurses walking down the street just now.

02:09.200 --> 02:10.200
We live pretty close to a hospital.

02:10.200 --> 02:13.960
They were talking about how the hospital's filled up with heart failures and they're

02:13.960 --> 02:17.320
wondering if it's the coronavirus vaccine.

02:17.320 --> 02:20.600
The average people working in these places, they're saying this all the time.

02:20.600 --> 02:24.680
Anyway, we also need a rake.

02:24.680 --> 02:25.680
Here we are.

02:25.920 --> 02:31.120
So while Naomi does some weeding there, I am going to do some trimming.

02:31.120 --> 02:32.120
I have these...

02:32.120 --> 02:33.120
What are these?

02:33.120 --> 02:34.120
Snips, I guess?

02:34.120 --> 02:35.120
Pliers?

02:35.120 --> 02:36.120
No.

02:36.120 --> 02:37.120
Not pliers.

02:37.120 --> 02:38.120
What are they called again?

02:38.120 --> 02:40.120
Giant scooters.

02:40.120 --> 02:42.360
Giant scooters.

02:42.360 --> 02:46.440
There's basically along the property line here in the back some trees like to grow in

02:46.440 --> 02:48.440
and so I just snip a little bit.

02:52.440 --> 02:54.440
There we go.

02:55.200 --> 02:56.200
Almost fell on my head.

02:56.200 --> 02:57.200
Wow, guys.

02:57.200 --> 03:02.680
So while I was doing this trimming, I actually found my old keys that I lost like two years

03:02.680 --> 03:03.680
ago.

03:03.680 --> 03:05.760
I guess that's where they went.

03:05.760 --> 03:11.400
So that derelict door from last year is already starting to bend inward.

03:11.400 --> 03:12.400
Doesn't matter too much.

03:12.400 --> 03:14.340
It's probably going to be a problem next year though.

03:14.340 --> 03:19.600
The issue is when I first built this garden years ago, along the side of the deck I put

03:19.600 --> 03:22.160
a piece of wood in there and it's all rotted away at this point.

03:22.880 --> 03:27.840
So I probably need to shovel that out, put a new piece in there and then shovel it back

03:27.840 --> 03:28.840
in.

03:28.840 --> 03:30.840
This is going to kind of suck.

03:30.840 --> 03:36.240
Yep, that was once a full piece of wood but it just disintegrated over the years.

03:36.240 --> 03:39.980
It's been I think six years or so, six or seven, since I put it in there.

03:39.980 --> 03:46.520
This entire garden is basically just scraps of wood so I guess I'll just get another scrap.

03:46.520 --> 03:50.720
So to replace that hole, I pulled this thing out.

03:50.720 --> 03:57.080
This is an old curtain rod holder that I yanked out of the living room years ago.

03:57.080 --> 04:00.680
And so that's going to be your purpose to go in that hole underneath the deck so all

04:00.680 --> 04:02.840
the earth doesn't keep spilling underneath the deck.

04:02.840 --> 04:07.760
This is why you pack rat things guys, this is why it's good to always hold on to whatever

04:07.760 --> 04:10.480
it is that you happen to be getting rid of anyway.

04:10.480 --> 04:13.040
Press X to doubt.

04:13.040 --> 04:17.520
Well that was a botched job if I ever did one but you know what, it's in and by the

04:17.520 --> 04:21.040
time it becomes a problem, we will have moved out.

04:21.040 --> 04:22.040
Hopefully.

04:22.040 --> 04:26.000
Yeah, I'll give it a couple of years, it'll be gone by then for sure.

04:26.000 --> 04:30.920
So while Naomi rakes all that up and flattens the garden out, I'm going to shovel in a bunch

04:30.920 --> 04:35.480
of the compost that we've accumulated over the year.

04:35.480 --> 04:39.480
I'm going to shovel in the compost into this thing, not into the garden.

04:39.480 --> 04:44.040
This is just a little planter that was left here by a former tenant years ago.

04:44.040 --> 04:46.920
It's just been collecting dust in the back of the shed.

04:46.920 --> 04:52.840
I'm going to put the lettuce in this because it's like a baby lettuce, you can just snip

04:52.840 --> 04:54.480
and it'll grow like grass.

04:54.480 --> 04:56.160
So we're going to try to do that this year.

04:56.160 --> 05:02.480
Yeah, compost just like last year is pretty gross, but that's okay.

05:02.480 --> 05:03.880
This was hard to open last year too.

05:03.880 --> 05:07.960
Oh no, I knocked the top off.

05:07.960 --> 05:14.080
Yep, that's all pretty good earth in there.

05:14.080 --> 05:15.920
A year's worth of compost.

05:15.920 --> 05:19.840
There's some stuff in there, but it's all pretty much quality earth.

05:19.840 --> 05:21.840
Yeah.

05:21.840 --> 05:25.000
So it was pretty full before and now it's about halfway full.

05:25.000 --> 05:31.320
I shoveled the bottom half out and I pushed the rest of it down with the shovel and what

05:31.320 --> 05:37.280
will end up happening next is this stuff by next year will become that year's compost.

05:37.280 --> 05:40.880
It's the circle of life, Naomi.

05:40.880 --> 05:52.880
I'm going to grab some water here.

05:52.880 --> 05:54.640
And Naomi's pretty much done raking the garden.

05:54.640 --> 05:55.640
It looks great.

05:55.640 --> 05:56.880
It looked awful before.

05:56.880 --> 05:57.880
Wait, what is that thing?

05:57.880 --> 06:00.880
It looks like a peach pit.

06:00.880 --> 06:01.880
Avocado pit maybe?

06:01.880 --> 06:02.880
I don't think it's an avocado pit.

06:02.880 --> 06:03.880
It's too red.

06:03.880 --> 06:04.880
It can probably go.

06:04.880 --> 06:07.960
We're not going to grow a tree in here, are we?

06:07.960 --> 06:08.960
Yes.

06:09.040 --> 06:14.840
So there's the planter full up with the compost and last year's manure, which we just kind

06:14.840 --> 06:17.180
of had sitting around the shed over the winter.

06:17.180 --> 06:21.320
I'm going to put, where is it, Naomi's, here's Naomi drinking more water.

06:21.320 --> 06:26.720
I'm going to put this tray of red leaf lettuce in there.

06:26.720 --> 06:30.320
Now if you leave red leaf lettuce, I think any lettuce alone long enough, it will eventually

06:30.320 --> 06:32.360
become heads of lettuce.

06:32.360 --> 06:36.120
If you plant it like a lawn and just trim it, you can just keep getting new leaves out

06:36.280 --> 06:39.280
the way that you cut a lawn with grass.

06:39.280 --> 06:40.280
So that's the plan.

06:40.280 --> 06:44.400
We're going to stay on top of this this summer and not be losers.

06:44.400 --> 06:48.520
And that whole tray will go in there.

06:48.520 --> 06:53.220
So just like the last few years, I'm behind the mesh right now, but the peas are going

06:53.220 --> 06:54.220
to grow up.

06:54.220 --> 06:56.060
They've done that for the last little bit.

06:56.060 --> 06:59.640
So what I'll do is right here at the corner, I'll dig a hole.

06:59.640 --> 07:01.640
It's got to be deep enough.

07:02.640 --> 07:04.000
We'll dig it down.

07:04.000 --> 07:09.560
And then just like last year, at the bottom, I put a handful of manure.

07:09.560 --> 07:11.760
You didn't want to grow a basil plant this year, did you?

07:11.760 --> 07:12.760
No.

07:12.760 --> 07:14.360
Yeah, we had too much basil last year.

07:14.360 --> 07:16.320
We didn't use half of it.

07:16.320 --> 07:20.340
We dried it and froze it and we still haven't used all of it.

07:20.340 --> 07:24.360
So because Naomi got so angry at me about using the kitchen scissors for the manure

07:24.360 --> 07:27.280
bag, this time I got my produce knife.

07:27.280 --> 07:33.240
A long time ago when I used to work in retail, they gave us one of these knives if you worked

07:33.240 --> 07:34.400
in the produce department for free.

07:34.400 --> 07:37.760
It is the sharpest nice knife I've ever had.

07:37.760 --> 07:39.040
It's sharper than anything.

07:39.040 --> 07:40.760
To be fair, Naomi, we also use this knife in the kitchen.

07:40.760 --> 07:41.760
Do you care that much?

07:41.760 --> 07:44.760
I don't use that knife in the kitchen, so I don't care.

07:44.760 --> 07:45.760
Oh, okay.

07:45.760 --> 07:47.760
If you want to use the kitchen knife, that's fine.

07:50.760 --> 07:51.760
There we go.

07:51.760 --> 07:55.760
I can tell it's fresh manure and not one year old manure because it's still wet.

07:56.240 --> 07:58.240
So you take...

07:58.240 --> 07:59.240
Say moo.

07:59.240 --> 08:00.240
Moo.

08:00.240 --> 08:01.240
Moo.

08:01.240 --> 08:03.240
Just put your hand right in it, dude.

08:03.240 --> 08:04.240
Like, don't got to worry.

08:04.240 --> 08:05.240
Oh my god, it's gross.

08:05.240 --> 08:07.240
Got a clump of that stuff.

08:07.240 --> 08:08.440
Peas eggs.

08:08.440 --> 08:11.080
You put it right in the hole.

08:11.080 --> 08:12.080
That's all you need.

08:12.080 --> 08:13.560
I had to take the peas out with two hands, guys.

08:13.560 --> 08:20.240
You couldn't see it, but there's the peas and the peas go right in the hole.

08:20.240 --> 08:22.040
There they are.

08:22.040 --> 08:23.040
Put the earth in.

08:26.240 --> 08:27.240
Make sure not to cover them up.

08:27.240 --> 08:29.240
And there we go.

08:29.240 --> 08:30.240
One pea plant.

08:30.240 --> 08:32.000
Six more to go.

08:32.000 --> 08:36.040
So with the peas in place, since they have to go there every single year, because of

08:36.040 --> 08:40.240
the mesh, I'm now thinking about where to put the rest of the stuff because we're only

08:40.240 --> 08:43.280
going to get four cucumber plants this time because there's always the complaint that

08:43.280 --> 08:44.280
there's...

08:44.280 --> 08:45.280
There's always too many.

08:45.280 --> 08:46.280
There's always too many cucumbers.

08:46.280 --> 08:48.800
So we're going to put those four cucumber plants on the far side of the gardens and

08:48.800 --> 08:50.520
grow up that mesh.

08:50.520 --> 08:51.520
Okay.

08:51.520 --> 08:52.520
We had tomatoes.

08:52.520 --> 08:55.320
I'll just zoom out a bit.

08:55.360 --> 09:03.640
So we had tomatoes over there last, peppers here, and kale back there.

09:03.640 --> 09:08.400
And with cucumbers having to always be there and peas having to always be there, we can

09:08.400 --> 09:10.740
rotate those three.

09:10.740 --> 09:14.120
But also there's the fact that we bought four spinach plants because there's currently a

09:14.120 --> 09:16.700
shortage of cucumber plants.

09:16.700 --> 09:28.180
So what I might do is I might put those in rows here at the front and then put the tomatoes

09:28.180 --> 09:30.540
and peppers in the back.

09:30.540 --> 09:31.940
Maybe that's the plan.

09:31.940 --> 09:35.500
And the garden is put in right there.

09:35.500 --> 09:38.300
Naomi is watering some kale.

09:38.300 --> 09:40.220
Eight kale plants.

09:40.220 --> 09:42.380
There's four spinach right here.

09:42.380 --> 09:45.180
If the sun will cooperate.

09:45.180 --> 09:47.780
There's the six peppers.

09:47.780 --> 09:48.780
There's the six tomatoes.

09:48.780 --> 09:51.300
A little bit of extra lettuce back there.

09:51.300 --> 09:56.560
Maybe we'll give it to my parents or something, but that's where the cucumbers will go once

09:56.560 --> 09:57.560
we get them.

09:57.560 --> 10:01.100
And of course the peas along the side here.

10:01.100 --> 10:02.100
And the bed of lettuce.

10:02.100 --> 10:06.380
That's a lot of lettuce, but it'll probably be okay, actually, if we just keep cutting

10:06.380 --> 10:07.560
it regularly.

10:07.560 --> 10:09.660
There's Naomi's dirty legs.

10:09.660 --> 10:12.420
That's okay because my legs are pretty dirty too.

10:12.420 --> 10:14.240
And that is the garden.

10:14.240 --> 10:18.320
Welcome back once we have the cucumbers ready to go.

10:18.320 --> 10:21.000
But it looks pretty good for, you know, this is actually a little bit early.

10:21.000 --> 10:24.480
Usually we put it in a couple of weeks later than this, but it's been very hot in May.

10:24.480 --> 10:28.000
It's already 30 degrees today and it's May, it's early May.

10:28.000 --> 10:30.200
Welcome to global warming guys.

10:30.200 --> 10:31.200
Yeah.
